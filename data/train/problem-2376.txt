Sam made a soft sound of hurt. He started to reach out for Dean again, but Dean felt somehow that he couldn’t, didn’t want, to be touched. The last person who had touched him was Cas; his blood was still on Dean’s jacket. He must have pulled back, because Sam’s hand hung by his side, his expression equal parts sorrowful and confused.
“You two keep in touch pretty often?” Dean says around a mouthful of French fries at the diner where they’ve stopped for lunch. He’s starting to suspect that the sodium is having a much more real impact on him now that Chuck isn’t keeping his protagonists in top physical condition, but he’s trying not to think about it too hard.
Anyway, it’s one of Dean’s best memories of spending his childhood on the road, the time he’d gone with Sam and their dad when they were kids. It was nothing they would’ve done except for the fact that there happened to be a case nearby, but they spent the whole day there, and Dean still remembers the look of awe on Sam’s face when he saw it for the first time, like he couldn’t believe something like that was real.
She smiles a bitter kind of smile. “I got divorced,” she says. “Been dragging on for a year, and I promised myself that when he finally signed the papers I’d come out to Vegas. But when it happened I couldn’t get any of my girlfriends to take the time off work to come with me.” She shrugs. “So I came by myself.”
“It’s alright with who?” Dean demands. “Not with me. I don’t remember getting a vote on that. In fact, Cas, I don’t remember you telling me a damn thing about it.”
“No.” Cas’ voice is flat, like he’s trying to keep any emotion out of it. “She realized I would be more useful to her as a vessel than as a traveling companion. I had to kill her.”
“So now you don’t have your grace, and that sucks, but you can just — be a person,” .Dean said. “ You know, if you like your job, that’s great. If you don’t, you can get a different one. You can meet someone and do human stuff with them, I don’t know, and just know that you made your own choices.”
Jody was quiet for a long moment. “World’s a lot safer place right now because of you,” she’d said then, soft and sincere. Dean could hear tears in her voice. “Bobby would be so proud of you.”
The longest stretch of time Dean and Cas ever spent together, uninterrupted, was in Purgatory. It’s strange to think about now, because the place feels so much like a dream, but for months Dean saw him every day. The three of them operated as a unit, Dean, Castiel, and Benny, watching each other’s backs, barely scraping through surviving in that place, and sometimes Dean was happier there than he should’ve been.
He can do this. He’s faced down monsters, and demons, and God. He can knock on Cas’ door and tell him exactly what he came here to say.
things, as such. Angels didn’t. But there was a sense of wrongness about it, like an error that needed to be corrected.
“They’re weak,” the serpent said to the angel of Thursday. He was trying to turn as many to his side as he could. Castiel was nothing special among the angels, nothing extraordinary, but still, he was the guardian of one of the seven days, and that counted for something in a power struggle. “They’re already defying His will, and still He loves them more than He loves us. Doesn’t that bother you?”
It’s not an unimpressive little speech, Dean thinks, although he hardly knew what he was saying for half of it, too busy suppressing the fight-or-flight urge to run. And as soon as he’s finished it, Cas stands up in one quick, fluid motion, chair scraping roughly across the floor as he pushes it aside.
When Cas wakes up, he is lying in a motel bed and Dean is stilling next to him, eyes red, holding his hand.
He watched Jack’s face crumble, tears beginning to fall. “No,” Jack said, and his voice was very small. “No, he
“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now,” Sam says. “I’ve been cataloging all this stuff, but I know it’s not gonna be any use to anybody. I can’t exactly go to law school, if I even wanted to. I mean, I never even
It doesn’t add up, Dean thinks. Claire’s smart, she knows how to defuse a situation without throwing punches at some loser at a bar. It’s — well, it’s the kind of stupid thing Dean would’ve done when he was her age, more looking for a fight than he was seriously intending to protect anyone’s honor. The place looked shady and out-of-the-way anyway, not like somewhere you’d go intending to have a nice night in a new city.
The first thing he does when he wakes up is stagger out of bed and just about make it to the toilet in the hotel bathroom before vomiting. He almost immediately slumps back over onto the tiled floor, sitting there and letting a wave of self-loathing wash over him. The towel sitting on the counter neatly folded into the shape of a swan feels like a cruel mockery. Groaning, Dean pushes himself to his feet and washes the taste out of his mouth with tap water in one of those paper cups you have to tear the plastic wrap off before you can use.
They’re eating breakfast together, each of them having helped themselves to a bowl of Jack’s sugary cereal. Dean’s just starting to feel aware after drinking his first cup of coffee when she says it. Something about the thought of her catching a Greyhound back to Sioux Falls bothers Dean, picturing her surrounded by strangers, arriving back at a crowded bus depot.
Jesus, Dean still doesn’t even know how to talk to him like this. It was easier before, when he could think of Jack as more or less an equal in some ways — but that was never true, and he can’t ignore it now that Jack is four feet tall and in elementary school. When Sam talked about girls he met at school as a kid, Dean would tease him about having a girlfriend, but you’re probably not supposed to do that anymore, right? Who knows if Jack will even like girls, when he grows up. You’re not supposed to assume.
this time. Finality was something Dean had been dwelling on recently. There was a lot of it going around.
me. Only spent weekends with the kid, but that was bad enough. I wanted her to love me so bad. But I realized there was nothing I could do to make up for the fact that I wasn’t her mom. Eventually realized her mom had the right idea about her cheating ex, too.”
Dean laughs in a surprised burst, and he knocks his knee lightly against Cas’. “Don’t Han Solo me, man. You
Dean stared, mouth open, at the space where Castiel had just appeared. “You,” he started to say. “Cas, are you—“
Every night, Cas had taken to reading Jack stories from an illustrated children’s Bible, which was also fucking weird, especially because he added his own commentary and fact-checking, and it made Dean feel almost dizzy to think that there were two entities sitting in his living room who once had had godlike powers and didn’t anymore, Jack tucked under Cas’ arm and listening to him talk about Noah’s ark.
When Cas and Jack left the following day, Dean and Sam stood in the driveway to see them off. It reminded Dean of the day Sam had left for Stanford: there was no screaming match like the one for the ages Sam had with their father, but there was that same sense of finality.
He’s had hangovers before, but in comparison those were like a splinter compared with some of the torture in Hell that featured needles being shoved into sensitive places.
“Oh, was that a pop culture reference?” Cas says innocently. Happiness is so warm, heating his human body from the inside out, and Dean gives him a kiss that makes them both laugh.
He looks at Dean with eyes slightly dazed, mouth slightly open, and Dean raises a hand to trace his thumb along Cas’ jaw. Still Cas, still the same face it’s always been, but so different now too, shining with something both reminiscent of and completely unlike how he’d looked that night at the bunker, before Dean lost him. And here he is now, found again, and Dean won’t make the same mistake twice. Won’t run from this anymore.
“What are you thinking about?” Cas asks him, and it’s funny how that phrase could feel like a tease or a request for compliments or even an accusation, but from Cas, of course, it’s just a genuine question, a real desire to know what’s on Dean’s mind. It makes him smile, even though what’s on his mind is weighing heavily.
He closes his eyes. He doesn’t want to look at the Empty wearing Dean’s face anymore, twisted into that expression of contempt.
And then he sees her, springing to her feet from where she’d been sitting on the curb. There’s blood on her face.
No matter how many times the Empty runs through it, he always makes the same choice. He always cuts his arm open with his own blade, smears his grace-infected human blood on the wall. He always chooses Dean Winchester.
He looks at Cas with so much feeling in those eyes, so much sincerity, and it feels like a shock to Cas’ system, to try and process it. He wants nothing more than to throw himself forward and kiss Dean again, wrap himself around him and never let go, but he stands still and wide-eyed, watching. This is not the place for it, not here where they are not safe, where they would be seen.
Jody sighs. “It’s fine. Sam already promised to get it back to us. But Dean — she hasn’t been doing well, you know. She’s an adult, but I don’t want her just self-destructing because she doesn’t have any vampires to kill. Okay, Winchester?”
Sam prays to him often. His prayers have the hollow and insincere ring of the soulless; Castiel ignores them. If Dean prays, he does not pray to Castiel. Castiel doesn’t think he would be able to resist responding, if he heard that call.
He watches Cas shake himself a little, like he too had forgotten temporarily they were just standing on opposite sides of a doorway. “Yes, of course,” he says, and steps aside.
“I mean it, okay? What you learned as a hunter doesn’t make you immortal. You got to keep that in mind.”
Now, though, he gets to wonder about that like he does about everything else, wonder how much of it was just Chuck’s plan. Did Chuck write him going to Lisa and Ben, or leaving them, or both? Was it just a little tragedy that was fun for him to play out?
Cas can’t stop looking at him, but there’s nothing he can say that seems adequate. “You came here, where no human has ever been, for me.”
And even deeper down, maybe, the truth was that he couldn’t imagine Cas looking at him from behind another pair of eyes any more than he could imagine how his life would have turned out if he’d never met Cas at all.
Claire doesn’t say anything about when she’ll be getting back on the road, but Cas offers her use of the guest room for as long as she needs it. Jack takes an instant shine to her, listening with wide eyes to her stories about hunts and wanting to hear everything about their road trip.
“Yeah,” Dean says, “you did exactly the right thing. You made the world so much better, Jack. And then you came home. That was the right thing.”
Dean turns toward him, looking away from the road. Cas opens his mouth to scold him for being an irresponsible driver. “No, it’s not, Cas,” he says. “I need you to listen to me—“
“You can see me,” Cas says dumbly, unable to think of anything else to say. It shouldn’t be possible.
“Well, we have to,” Sam says, his voice steely. “So Eileen and I are figuring it out. You better figure out what you want to do too.”
Abruptly, there’s a hand on his collar pulling him to his feet, and Cas doesn’t have his former, angelic strength but it’s not like Dean is putting up any resistance, his chair clattering to the floor in his haste to get to his feet.
Dean’s soul is brilliant and burning. It couldn’t be said to have a color, but Cas always remembers it as gold, resplendent like nothing else, the most pure essence of humanity he can imagine. In the handful of vessels he’s possessed, Castiel’s angelic essence has always sat uneasily alongside the human soul they belong to, but this is different. He touches Dean’s soul and there is, instantly, an overwhelming sense of peace.
“Hey,” Sam says when Dean makes that joke over the phone, after he explains everything. “We’ve the ones who decide what being a Winchester means now, I think.”
“Thanks.” Dean feels the surrealism of it, of being in bed with Cas after all these years, skin to skin, but he’s not freaking out like he might’ve thought he would. This makes sense, what they’re doing. Feels right.
“I think so,” she says. “It’s been good staying with you guys, but I really think I need to get home.” She smiles sheepishly. “I really freaked out Jody, I think. And Kaia.”
The feeling washes over him, and he tries to process it, to hold this new knowledge without it overwhelming him. It’s hidden so deep and guarded so well that Cas could never have seen it any other way than this direct touch.
The Empty shouldn’t be calling him that, not in Dean’s voice. The hatred it wears on Dean’s face is personal, when it bends down to his level. “Was that all you ever wanted? Just to die for him?”
“It was?” Cas tries to remember, tries to envision what might happen after this. It isn’t difficult to believe this is an illusion — there is clearly something off about it — but what Dean’s saying can’t be true, it doesn’t make sense.
“Don’t tell me about me and Cas,” Dean says sharply. “And excuse me, Mr. Well-Adjusted, for needing some time to figure things out after the only thing I was good at just got fucking, deleted from the universe!”
Dean looks — oddly unaffected, Cas realizes, by what should be a wholly unnatural invasion of self. Cas stares at him, breathless, and feels new and strange. The world is a different place now, fundamentally changed.
The truth is that as much as he wishes he could. Dean can only sort of remember what Claire looked like the first time they met, when she was just a little kid living with her mom in a normal, suburban house. He just has this faint, blurry impression of a girl with blonde hair. Cas fucked that girl’s life up pretty good, he thinks, and all these years later, Claire is still hurting.
Dean tried, and failed, to catch his eye. If Cas just asked him to go with them, Dean thought, he would go. If Cas would just ask, would just tell him that he needed Dean there, he could say yes.
“Yeah,” Dean says bitterly, “And I didn’t save you. I didn’t make up for anything. So I — I just wanted to let you go live your life. You and Jack. Figured it’d be better.” He’s got his hands back to himself again now, but Cas is still just the smallest distance away.
In the kitchen, Claire helps herself to a beer from the fridge and pops the tab with a bottle opener she keeps on a keychain. Dean almost objects before remembering she’s old enough to drink now.
Jack nods. “Cas says I have to remember that most kids don’t have the advantage of cosmic knowledge and it isn’t their fault if they know less than me.”
He’s angry. Cas knows Dean well enough to understand that this is one of the surest ways to draw Dean’s ire — to keep a problem from him, even if it’s one he would never be able to solve.
Jack’s latest thing was watching  family sitcoms. He still liked his Star Wars, and the cartoon he watched about alien rocks or something, but he’d developed a taste for the old-fashioned. He liked “The Brady Bunch,” “Family Matters,” anything with a laugh track and everyone learning a lesson at the end of the episode. Sometimes Cas would watch with him, but the kid would sit by himself in front of the TV staring at nothing else for hours if nobody intervened.
Dean laughs. “I think they said Melissa Etheridge,” he said. “Why do you know Melissa Etheridge, anyway?”
Cas raises Dean’s hand to his mouth and presses his lips to it. He hears Dean’s quick intake of breath, but he doesn’t move. This is not quite a kiss; it is a point of contact. Cas summons all of his remaining angelic grace and, as he has so many times before, uses it to heal.
Outside the windows of the Impala, America’s highways haven’t changed. The billboards for churches and sex shops are the same. The little towns, which seem to come into existence only as dots for the highway to connect, are as identical as they always were, each one a neon oasis with a truck stop, a McDonald’s, and a motel at the first turn off the interstate. And beyond that, the cities and the suburbs, full of people going about the normal lives unaware of how much safer they are today than they were just months before.
When he’d pictured this, it was him and Sam and Cas — plus Jack, later, once he’d come along and Dean had eventually started thinking of him as part of the unit. Someday, he’d let himself hope, there’d be a day when they didn’t have to do any of it anymore, and they’d sit on a beach somewhere, watching waves break on the shore, probably wearing matching fucking Hawaiian shirts.
“Did you, uh, make any friends yet?” Dean says, awkwardly. They’ve been allowed to pull out of the parking lot by now. It’s a short drive back to the house, only a couple minutes, but Cas apparently doesn’t like Jack to take the bus. Dean gets it; he probably doesn’t want to let the kid out of his sight anymore than he has to.
“Yeah, put him on,” Dean says. There’s the faint sound of Cas saying something to Jack and passing the phone over, and then the kid’s bright, cheerful voice says, “Hello, Dean!”
“So do you think he made it himself?” Claire says a minute later. She’s sprawled out across the bed, looking at the ceiling, and she shoves a handful of Reese’s Pieces into her mouth. “Like, was he spending the time crafting every individual rock, or is it just starting a process and like —“ She spreads her hands out in a gesture that’s probably meant to represent an explosion.
It takes him longer to get downtown than it should; he’s not used to driving in cities, and the Impala isn’t made for it like she is for open highways, and at one point he almost turns the wrong way down a one-way street. He curses under his breath, swerving back into the right lane.
Maybe Cas is the closest thing to a real choice Dean has ever made, and he just didn’t know he was making it at the time. Because he did choose, didn’t he? To believe Cas could be more than some soldier of Heaven, to forgive him and follow him and all the rest of it, and god knows — literally, when there still was a god — that Cas kept choosing him too.
Dean clears his throat, makes himself look over at Jack. He’s not quite meeting his eye, looking at a point right over his head so that he doesn’t tear up. “But I realized, these past few weeks, that I don’t… I can’t do that anymore. Obviously. But it’s more than that. I don’t want to.”
They’re in a diner somewhere in the Midwest — Iowa, maybe, Cas thinks. Now that he’s human, his mind doesn’t have a good grasp of American geography, not like when he was in possession of all his powers and could pinpoint exactly where on the Earth’s surface he was at any time. They’re on their way somewhere, but he’s a little fuzzy on the details of that too, remembers that Sam was talking about the case involving ghouls.
When he turns around, of course, it isn’t Lisa Braeden. That kind of plot contrivance, he assumes, died with Chuck. Instead, it’s a stranger, a woman about his age with short, spiky blonde hair, wearing a white dress.
Dean doesn’t see Claire for the rest of the night, and he doesn’t knock on the door of the hotel room next to his and demand that she explain herself. Instead, he stays up half the night wallowing, feeling sorry for himself and feeling like shit about it.
And without grace, what is he? What is an angel who falls? Just human, that’s all. That’s all that would be left.
When Castiel pulled Dean out of Hell all those years ago, he healed decades worth of wear and tear, breaks and bruises. He was careful and precise, and he rebuilt the man he had rescued in the best condition he could manage. The touch of grace was left in every cell of Dean Winchester’s body, washing away the accumulated damage of a life on the road, of fighting and drinking and sleeping at odd angles in cars. It was only what he had been ordered to do, but Cas thinks now that it was perhaps his first act of love.
“I guess there’s private investigator,” Claire says, sounding bored by it. “Or bounty hunter. Or—“ she flashes Dean a smile “—a life of crime.”
Their waitress sidles up to the table in boots and a hat and gives them that smile that Dean’s seen about a thousand times before. “Heya,” she says, in what may or may be a fake Southern accent. “Can I get y’all something to drink? Maybe start you off with a couple of cocktails?”
Cas knows it is only a dream, but he intervenes anyway, plants himself in front of Jack and shields him with his body, standing between the two people he loves most in the world.
Cas smiled at him. “Dean, if I can be blunt, the time before I met you wasn’t much of a life at all.” He paused, just for a moment, not giving Dean much of a chance to cut it and say anything — and what
Well, maybe they got more right than any of them knew. Dean doesn’t like that he has an automatic, defensive reaction to it, even coming from Claire. But she’s young, it’s different for her, he figures.
Cas thinks of the kiss in the Impala, his memory of that long-ago night. It had been his subconscious rewriting the past, filling in what he had wanted — if not consciously — even then. But if this version of Dean is real, was he in the other dreams as well?
Cas, graceless, wasn’t all that much different. He hovered around corners of the bunker and appeared suddenly and soundlessly in rooms the same way he always had. In the mornings, he drank coffee and made faces at the bitter taste, and he ate ravenously, the way Dean supposed you would if you hadn’t really tasted food in years. Sam took him shopping for other clothes and he came back with sweaters and jeans, which looked strange on him, but he almost always still wore the trenchcoat. “At this point, I wouldn’t feel right without it,” he said.
“That’d be good, yeah. I drank one of those Monster energy drinks Claire bought me. Think if I stop with the caffeine I might die.” He’s rambling, he knows, and makes himself stop as he follows Cas into the kitchen.
He should; Dean would not want this information withheld from him. But then he sees Dean at a moment when he looks
He smiles back at her. “Anyway, if there’s anything I wish this place had,” he says, “it’s not ghosts. It’s some decent fucking coffee.”
“Claire, it wasn’t — it wasn’t your fault, you know?” he says. “And I know Kaia isn’t thinking about it that way. She was just happy she was going to see you again.”
But when Claire comes back with tacos and chips and queso, looking triumphant and happy to be there in this little roadside motel with him, and — it makes him think about Jack, and how happy he’d been when Dean let him drive the Impala, and that wasn’t something he wanted to dwell on, right now.
Dean extends a hand across the table to fist-bump her, and after rolling her eyes, she taps her knuckles against his. “You got yourself a deal,” Dean says. “Text Jody so she knows where you’re going to be, okay? And get some sleep, I’ll show you the route I have plotted out in the morning.”
“It means I’m glad to be here. To be human, even. To have the chance to give Jack something like a normal childhood. And I’m glad I told you what I did.” Dean can hear the hesitancy in Cas’ voice as he says that. He imagines Cas’ downcast eyes avoiding his.
Later, he understands. Doubt is a difficult thing to speak aloud. It gets under your skin of quickly, changing you completely while you are still afraid to speak it aloud. And then it is only a matter of time until you fall.
“Well, shit,” she’d said. “You boys really did it this time, huh? I guess that means the world is... permanently saved.”
He gets what she’s implying, what she assumes. It’s not like she’s the first; Dean doesn’t even think he could count on two hands the number of angels and demons that implied he and Cas were, well, an item. Not to mention some of the Supernatural fanfic that has been, thankfully, wiped from the Internet by divine intervention so he and Sam no longer have the worst imaginable Google results.
“Guess so,” Dean says, and for a moment his mind strays to his father, what he would think. He pushes the thought down immediately, doesn’t want to go down that road, but like he’s read his mind Sam says immediately, laughing a little, “What do you think Dad would say?”
“When you asked me to take away Lisa and her son’s memories, I did that because I knew it would hurt you if they were harmed,” he said. “But it was also because I imagined how she would feel, knowing that she had you and then lost you. I thought it would be kinder for her not to remember at all.”
Cas’ eyes flash with something Dean can’t quite place, worryingly close to anger. “I don’t understand,” he says.
“Dude, you need some coffee,” Dean says to him. He pushes Cas his own cup, freshly refilled, and Cas just looks at it. After a minute, Dean sighs and rips open two packets of sugar, stirs them into the coffee with a long-suffering look.
The Empty laughs at him, and it’s so unfair, Cas thinks, that this is the last memory he will have of Dean’s face, and not the reality of it.
Okay. He’s not just tired. He’s definitely drunk, too. Goddamn Chuck, he used to have better goddamn tolerance.
If Cas thinks Dean looks dead on his feet — which he must — he doesn’t comment on it. Cas just looks at him and eventually says in an impartial voice, “What are you doing here?”
“Don’t you say you’re sorry to me again, okay? Don’t say that.” His voice comes out soft and pleading instead of angry. It sounds, at least to him, like a prayer.
Cas looks at Dean, his face open and sincere. Cas wants to tell him the truth. “You,” he says. “I love you more than they wanted me to hurt you.”
Dean couldn’t speak, couldn’t make himself say the words. He’d tried so hard not to, the last time he lost Cas, as if not saying it could mean he’d come back.
“Full House” was Jack’s favorite, and it wasn’t too hard for Dean to guess why. It’s what he was watching when Dean tried to talk to him about moving out.
“It’s a special group for kids who are smarter than the other kids in our grade,” Jack says matter-of-factly, “but Mindy says we’re not supposed to talk about that.”
Cas thinks he should have said something, before. Should have told Dean to look after Jack, reminded him that whatever he looks like, whatever he says, he is only a child.
Jack — this younger, more human Jack — prints his name carefully in the corner of the drawing and hands it back to Cas, waiting for his approval.
He finds Dean and the other human man with him in the warehouse in Sioux Falls. Bullets pierce through him, painlessly, as he advances toward him.
“We grew up on the road, me and Sam. Goin’ from place to place because our dad was always chasing something. He thought every damn ghoul he could get his hands on was his responsibility to kill. And I guess I thought I’d always be the same way.”
It must have been a Chuck plot twist, Dean thought, the angel healing Sam who didn’t want Cas around. The pathos of Castiel, fallen angel, sleeping on the floor of a convenience store. It wasn’t fair, but Dean had still let it happen. And now Cas had given up his grace to save the world, again, and Dean had just let him go, again.
The examination of a soul is something Cas hasn’t done in a long time. Generally, there are much easier ways to tell if something that looks human is only an impersonator, but here…
But how can he know, when he’s never seen it? What would it be like, the two of them? There was no space for it, across all the years they’ve known each other. It wouldn’t have fit; try to get something as tender as the words Cas had said into their lives and you’d just scrape it and tear it on all the rough edges.
There’s an awful silence between them then, and Dean can hear the sounds of footsteps in the hallway, of the ice maker down the hall, of a sharp knock on a nearby door, and he hates it, all of it, wishes for the world to be as quiet and empty as he feels.
“You don’t have to ask my permission, Cas,” Dean said. “It’s your life. He’s your kid.” It came out more harshly, more matter-of-fact, than he meant it to. What he meant is that he didn’t have any right to claim to be a parent to Jack, not after the things he’d said.
He looks over at Claire, and she’s got her head propped up on one hand, gazing out the window. She still looks like a kid to him, still with a childish roundness to her face.
Back in his hotel room, alone, Dean fumbles for his phone. In the process of digging through his jacket pockets, he realizes how tired he is. He falls backward onto the bed, kicking his shoes off, and stares at the ceiling swimming slightly above him.
Claire Novak looks out at the expanse of the Grand Canyon like she’s evaluating it to decide whether it’s allowed to stay on the face of the earth. She’s been sitting there motionless for a good few minutes, knees hugged to her chest like she might outlast the rock.
“It’s true. I couldn’t see past it, couldn’t think about anything else but Chuck controlling me,” he says. “And I did exactly what he always wanted. I got angry and I pushed people away. And you, Cas —“ Dean’s distantly award that he’s breathing harder now, like he’s been running. “You left me, man. You told me those things and you just left, and then before I could even think…” He makes a slashing gesture in the air with his hand, wildly. “Just like that you’re back!”
When Dean found out Claire had never been to the Grand Canyon, either, he decided they had to change their route. It’s an addition of a few days onto their trip, but Dean doesn’t mind. It’s not like he has anywhere in particular to be.
The kid is pretty obvious when she’s hoping for something. And the idea of not heading out onto the open road alone — well, it’s appealing. “You could come with, if you wanted to,” Dean says. “I’ve got the whole route mapped out. Leisurely, you know? Stop for all the landmarks, then finally hit the beach.”
“I’ve been working on a few things,” Sam says. “Cataloguing the artifacts and books here, mostly. There’s a lot I never had the time to go through.”
“Of course.” Cas was sitting on the bed; he nodded at the desk chair across from him and Dean sat down, feeling awkward and sort of at a loss for where to put his hands.
“Hey,” Dean says sharply. “You tried, okay? You did what you could to help. You know, it’s not your job to clean up every mess for Heaven’s misfit toys like Metatron.”
“Dean,” he says. And then all the lights in the room explode, and the Empty screams as Cas falls forward into Dean’s arms.
“Yes,” Jack said then, abruptly. “It’s too much power for anyone, I think. It’s wrong.” He looked between the three of them, and for a moment he looked so much like a child, waiting for guidance. “It’ll take away
Dean laughs. “You’re coping well with mortality,” he says, and raises the hand that isn’t holding Cas’ to wipe tears from his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt.
Dean could reach out for him, take his hand across the table. Assuming that Cas would let him, would allow Dean to pry his fingers apart and fold Cas’ hand into his own. He doesn’t make a move to do it, though. They just look at each other, eye contact too intense, but Dean’s not looking away.
Sam just shakes his head and gets up, setting his beer bottle down next to the sink with an unpleasant little thud and leaving the room.
In the light of the early morning, the street is empty and pretty much silent. There’s no one around walking a dog or anything, and all the kids are probably at school this early on a weekday. Jack is probably at school too, he realizes. To Dean it feels like the street is doing what he’s been doing since they left Vegas the previous day — standing in suspense, holding his breath.
“It’s a museum for children featuring exhibits on scientific topics. Jack wanted to see the exhibit on dinosaurs. He’s interested in life from earlier eras of creation.”
The past dozen years have far more than their share of regrets. He sees them all again, clearer than ordinary memory: his betrayal of the Winchesters, the Leviathan and his mad grab for the throne of Heaven, the bargain he’d struck with Lucifer. All the lives he’d failed to save and the ones he’d shattered — Jimmy Novak, especially, and Claire left behind in his wake.
“Well, you still can. Hand over the card,” Claire says. She pulls out her phone and starts typing something.
“I’m considering it,” Cas said carefully. “If that is… if that’s something you’d…” He didn’t seem to know how to finish.
Dean remembers how it felt, the protectiveness and affection that rose in his throat, the urge to get close enough to Cas to comfort him, the way he said nothing but, “Try to get some sleep, buddy.”
“Hey,” a voice says behind him, and for a moment Dean thinks he recognizes it. “Is this seat taken?”
Dean loves his voice, too, so unlike anyone else’s. “Yeah,” he says. He’s still standing on the doorstep, Cas making no move to let him in. “I was in Vegas, but we decided to cut the trip short, come back a little early.”
Dean shrugs, sort of sheepishly. “I was gonna speak to the Empty,” he says. “Make a deal of some kind. There’s gotta be something I can offer.”
“There are a lot of places on Earth I’d like to see,” Cas says. “Like Madagascar.” He pauses for a moment, then adds, “It has some of the greatest species diversity of Earth.”
It’s not a great sign. Dean helps himself to his own buffet breakfast. They’ve got scrambled eggs, so he goes with that and one of the tiny little blueberry muffins. Loathe as he is to admit to it, eating bacon or sausage every morning hasn’t been working out well lately.
He can tell that Melissa is getting a little tired of this chain of conversation, that it’s not the celebration of free and easy single life she was hoping for. And it’s not that he isn’t happy for her, he’s sure she’s better off, that her husband sucked and maybe her stepdaughter did too. It’s just — he knows why she’s sitting next to him, why she picked him out of all the guys drinking alone, and it’s not something he wants anymore.
She pulls out a magazine she picked up at some convenience store and starts flipping through it, not waiting for a response.
He takes stock of his physical condition. He is slightly hungry and more than a little thirsty, but otherwise, his body appears to be no worse for wear. It contains everything that he is now, no grace left over, no trace of the being he was. No wings, no special strength or power.
He fixes her with a level gaze, trying his best to imitate how he imagines Jody looks at her when she’s doing something stupid. He even tries putting his hands on his hips, but feels ridiculous and lets them drop. “You gonna tell me what happened?”
After the first eight hours he lets her drive the car, an honor he’s conveyed on such a limited number of people that handing over the keys feels like it has some kind of ritual significance.
“I guess the Winchester line really does end with us, huh,” Dean says. Winchester and Campbell too, the whole sorry lot of them. “I mean, unless Adam has kids. I’m guessing we wouldn’t be invited to the christening.”
When Cas first went looking for her, trying to mend that past harm, Dean didn’t get it. He figured there was nothing good people like them had to offer a teenager. But more than that, he thinks, it didn’t sit right with him to think about what Cas had done as a mistake or something he should apologize for. Cas was only, always, trying to do the right thing. Jimmy was the one who’d made the choice to be an angel’s vessel instead of being there for his kid.
Some time after Dean thought Cas had fallen asleep, he spoke up suddenly, in a voice quiet enough that he was clearly testing whether Dean was awake too. “Dean?” he said.
When there’s no response except that blank blue stare, Dean just keeps talking, needing desperately, more than anything, for him to understand.
“It’s not broken,” he tells her. “Just needs some ice, probably. Whoever it was must not‘ve known how to throw a punch.”
“Melissa. And what’s your occasion?” Dean can’t quite place her accent — something from up east. “Forgive me, but you look like you and I might be going through something similar.”
Cas smiles. There’s no way to convey it, the way he feels, freer and lighter than he ever has. “If you don’t mind,” he says, “let’s consider it even.”
. Besides, if he tried it he’d probably just end up trying to explain to Cas about why flowers are a common indicator of romantic intent, as if Dean actually knows
Distantly, on the streets outside, there are the sounds of cars passing by. There are footsteps in the hall outside and the faint murmur of conversation a few doors down. The world is, once again, filled with humanity.
kind of otherworldly being — if there was, he’d know about it. But he wonders about the rest of the universe. It’s a pretty damn big place, and he doesn’t know if Chuck put any life on the other planets up there, or if maybe it sprung up while he wasn’t looking. It makes Dean’s head hurt to think about galaxies full of stars being created just to be the backdrop of Chuck’s little stories, especially since he was one of them. It doesn’t feel right that he was ever that important.
It’s pretty much the same as the living room, white walls and white tile. Cas goes for the counter to turn on the coffee machine, and Dean hovers, until Cas gives him a look and says, “You can sit down.”
“It’s good.” Claire is smiling, angling her body toward Dean like she’s trying to include him in the conversation. Dean’s eyes flicker, nervously, between her and the sharks circling on the TV screen. “Hey, we’re at the Grand Canyon and I wanted to ask you. Do you know who made it?”
It was hard to talk to him — it had been hard last time he lost his grace, too, but this was worse, because Dean couldn’t stop thinking about what Cas said and he how he felt, after, and how strange it felt that Cas was back, again, and once again Dean hadn't done anything to save him. He hardly did any work to stop Chuck at all.
Cas hasn’t laid a hand on Dean’s soul in more than ten years. It is familiar, when his grace touches it. The core of a soul is always the same. Dean was easy to find in Hell, a shining beacon that Castiel, when he possessed full angelic power, could have found anywhere. It is so bright here, too, so real.
Cas’ eyes were sad. They always were, a little, but especially right now, and Dean just wished he could take that away, that Cas would say
Then he realizes Dean isn’t shooting. He’s looking at Castiel with a strange expression, almost as if he’s seen him before. Maybe, Castiel thinks, Dean does recognize his grace after all.
The four of them eat dinner together that night, and that’s — surreal, really, in how normal it is. All things considered. Dean, who’s spent his whole life fighting monsters, sitting down to eat spaghetti with a former angel of the lord, and the angel’s vessel’s kid, and the biological son of Lucifer, who is filling in a crossword puzzle in a Star Wars activity book.
He remembers watching E.T. on one of the bunker’s movie nights — Sam’s pick, but Cas and Jack had both gotten really invested in it, and Dean remembers that Cas, in particular, hadn’t liked the ending.
“Cas, I want you to know,” Dean says. He pauses for a moment, taking a deep breath. “I want you to know that if I hadn’t — if we hadn’t been able to get you back, if we’d tried everything. I would’ve. I would’ve taken care of Jack, I wouldn’t have let anything happen to him.” He smiles ruefully. “The kid deserves better than me, but I would have — I would have tried.”
Dean laughs at him. He can tell that Dean knows, at once, that he remembers. “Classic Cas,” he says. “Blaming me for coming to rescue you. Jack gave me a way in.”
“If there’s anything I can help you with, you can always call me,” Cas said softly. “It feels — wrong, sometimes, to be here. Heaven is in disarray, and my brothers and sisters… Well, most likely they wouldn’t want my help. But still, if I could do more for them —“
“But you didn’t stay with her,” Cas continued. “And I understood them that it wasn’t what you really wanted. You thought you did, maybe, but what you wanted was — freedom. Not peace.”
In an earlier life, it had meant nothing to him — the crunch of a broken bone, the spray of blood from a puncture wound. He had never understood the attachment to the physical form. For angels, even if it was impolite to say so explicitly, humans were divided into two categories: those who would be better off in Heaven, and those who deserved the punishment they would receive in Hell.
Sam had flatly turned down the idea of coming along with Dean on the trip. He’d seemed offended that Dean had even asked.
“He needs to be around children who are — well, his own physical age,” Cas said. “It will be good for him to socialize. And there’s only so much I can teach him — I mean, he’ll want to go to college one day. Potentially.”
“It’s a road trip,” he says. “It’ll be good for her.” Silence. “I think Claire’s old enough to decide if she wants to go to California,” he adds, defensively.
He sets his hand against the car’s hood, thinking of the initials he and Sam had carved as children, thinking of how for years this had seemed like the only thing he could claim as his own. “You go back to South Dakota and get your girl and you can take her down to the beach. Go out to California.”
“There you are,” the Empty says, in Dean’s voice. It’s cold, like Dean’s eyes are cold, his expression set in contempt. It’s the expression Cas feared, he realizes, all the times he thought about saying it. Revulsion. It makes him feel sick in the way that goes beyond physical, here where there is nothing physical left.
He’s been putting it off for long enough, since before he got here, and he doesn’t exactly know why. Maybe it’s some petty reluctance not to want to admit to Sam that he was right all along about what Dean should’ve been doing. Maybe it’s just that this whole thing has felt so removed from the way he lived the rest of his life, and talking to Sam, the person who lived that life along with him, reminds him — this is a very un-Winchester thing, that he’s doing.
Claire shakes her head. “Just me,” she says. She takes a long sip of the beer. “So, what’ve you guys been up to? Apart from killing God.”
No. This isn’t right. Castiel looks around at the other man to find that he is perfectly still and unmoving, and then he abruptly remembers his name: Bobby Singer. It isn’t
Claire smiles at him, a genuine smile, and it pulls at some heartstring, untangles some knot in his chest. “Yeah,” she says softly. “Thanks, Dean.”
Dean doesn’t get it, until Claire raises an eyebrow at him, and then he does. Claire, who is much closer to their server’s age than he is, is wearing a shirt that shows off her new tattoo. She’s got a certain air of confidence, with her short hair swept carelessly to the side. “Oh,” he says. “So she was, uh, she was flirting. With you.”
“I think it would be better, though,” Jack said  hesitantly, “if you and Sam came with us.” He paused for a second, then rushed on too quickly for Dean to response. “Castiel says that just because you’re family doesn’t mean you always stay together, but now that you’re not going to be hunters anymore — I mean —“
“It was easy to do,” Jack said, a little defensively. “It wasn’t anything bad. I just think people should have more of a chance to do the right thing.”
“It’s alright,” Cas says. “I’m always happy to hear from you,” and he means that, doesn’t he. It stabs at Dean a little, like the prick of a knife.
Cas looked down at the bloody grass beneath them, his eyes tired. “That’s not the way Heaven does things.”
Claire has no trouble navigating out of the gas station and pointing the car toward the freeway. “Don’t worry about me,” she says. “You should get some beauty sleep.”
Dean doesn’t pray, but Castiel watches over him. He feels responsible for both of the Winchesters; Sam, tearing across the country hunting monsters in search of adrenaline, and Dean, firmly ensconced in suburbia.
The street Dean turns on to, where Cas has been living, isn’t anything remarkable. It’s set some distance back from the main road, quieter. The houses aren’t huge but they’re got space in between them, yard space where trees are growing. It’s really not all that different from the street where the Winchester family home was located for the first four years of Dean’s life.
There’s no way, in between world-ending crises and their various deaths and their various fights, that they ever would have made it out to see the Grand Canyon. Dean doesn’t know why he said it, except that he wishes they had. He wishes Cas was here now, really, that Dean was showing him something good about this world that he’s stuck in now the same as the rest of them.
, Dean tried to tell himself, but it felt dishonest to even attempt to deny it. Of course he meant it that way. It was Cas, and he said what he meant.
He decides, though, that he’s not going to let Jody down. They’re going to talk, even if Claire doesn’t want to hear it.
Cas nods, smiling a little. After unpacking the groceries, he returns with a glass of water for both of them and sits on the steps leading up to the garage door, watching in silence. It gives Dean a weird kind of satisfaction, knowing that Cas is watching him do something that he’s good at.
He hands over the keys. Claire hasn’t remarked on the keychain, and she doesn’t now, just gets out of the passenger side door and waits by the side of the car until Dean does the same on the driver’s side. “Where are you gonna go?” he asks.
“What do you mean by that?” Cas says, like he doesn’t know, and Dean wishes he were here in person, wishes he could just grab Cas by the collar and — make him understand.
“Right.” Dean’s smiling at him. He seems — well, seems happy to see him. And Cas supposes he often does, when they’ve been separated, but. Circumstances have changed.
“Dean.” Cas did move toward him then, for the first time. He set his hand gently on top of Dean’s, where it was still lying uselessly on his knee, and he pressed firmly down for just a moment before pulling away. The gesture was clearly meant as comforting, but it made Dean’s heart race with nerves that he hoped weren’t appearing on his face as sheer panic.
Later, a serpent wound itself around Eve’s feet, and it told her about the forbidden fruit and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Eve listened. She took a bite of the fruit and she tempted her husband to do the same.
God. Dean grips the edge of the sink, trying to steady himself. Cas must be so pissed at him for this. Or worse, just —
“You know,” Claire says, “it’s ironic or whatever, but Castiel is… a pretty great dad. Whenever he talks to me, he’s talking about Jack, and I can tell he’s just… really proud of him.”
“I know you would have,” Cas says softly. “I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t think you would be there for him, Dean.”
She shrugs. “Everyone’s different, I guess. You gotta find what works for you. I just think — humans are nomadic people, you know? Not meant to stay in one place too long.”
Maybe a year after Sam’s Stephen King phase, he and Dean stayed for a week or so at some little hotel in Montana that Sam became convinced was haunted. There was this room down the hallway with weird sounds and smells that he was convinced betrayed supernatural energy. Dean, who at eleven had seen more than a few ghosts, wasn’t as convinced, but in a way it was fun to play along. To creep down the hall with Sam looking for evidence, playing at being hunters. They’d drawn a line of salt outside the room’s door, but all it had done was piss off housekeeping.
“I was always asking my dad if we could go to Disney, when I was a kid. But we never went.” She looks sorry she’s said it, eyes darting from him back to the highway outside the window.
Cas freezes in shock for about half a second before he kisses back, an urgent crush of contact that doesn’t limit itself to the lips — he pulls Dean in by the collar, draws their bodies together. It’s a wild kind of kiss, Dean nearly stumbling backwards again and Cas pressing forward.
From the passenger seat, Claire chooses among Dean’s collection of tapes. She likes Simon and Springsteen, Heart and Janis Joplin. When she plays Dean a song from one of her own favorite bands through her phone, the sound of it angry and discordant, he decides the kid has pretty decent taste in music.
The words hang heavy in that lonely hotel room. The kind of words that are powerful in a way that’s got nothing to do with exorcisms or incantations. For a moment he thinks of backtracking, trying to snatch back what he’s said, but he says quiet, waiting for the reply.
Dean laughs, his head bowing low over their joined hands. “He missed you,” he says. “We both really, really missed you, Cas.”
When an angel falls, that form burns out, streaking to Earth in a bright star of pure creation. Angels who fall traditionally do not retain their memories of being something else — it’s too difficult, to tether that long memory and cosmic knowledge to a human form. But for Castiel, the line is easier to cross.
Dean says it so gently, and Cas’ heart beats too loudly in his chest. It doesn’t, usually, and then he remembers — he is human now, all of him fully contained in this small body.
He pats Jack on the shoulder again, and Jack nods, looking too serious, too knowing, but at least like he might believe it.
He’s so busy thinking it that he forgets to say anything by way of introduction until Cas speaks to him first.
, and because of what he’d said. Those words felt like a hole torn through Dean’s chest, a gunshot wound with the bullet still lodged in. They made the past twelve years incomprehensible.
She sounds convinced in her words, and he can picture her speeding down the highway, wind in her hair. Free as a bird. So many songs about that have played from the tape deck of the Impala, songs about the freedom of the open road.
“I meant it,” Dean says. “Don’t tell me you don’t remember or you don’t know what I meant.” He unwinds one hand from around his mug and then, when Cas doesn’t move at all, curls it back in on itself, fingernails cutting into his skin. “I remembered the next morning. I know I did it the wrong way. But I drove all night — well, me and Claire drove. To see you. Because I couldn’t stand talking to you on the phone again. I just wanted to look at you, I guess.”
“There’s some things I still need to say,” Dean says. Cas opens his mouth to speak, but Dean cuts him off. “No, don’t — I need to, I need to say it my way, and I think you should hear it.”
“Are you happy, Cas?” he asks. He doesn’t think about it before he says it. It just suddenly seems urgently important to know.
It does hurt, giving up his grace. It bleeds through his skin into Dean’s, finding the damage in his body and setting it right. It illuminates both of them. It’s not like dying, and Cas has done it often enough to know. Dean says his name again, frightened, and Cas holds his hand in place.
It’s bad enough how Cas looks at him sometimes with all that trust in his eyes, bad enough how much he knows Cas believes in him. Jack is a kid, and when you’re a kid your parents are your whole world. You don’t know enough to judge if what they’re doing is wrong.
That night years ago, in another dark and unremarkable hotel room, Dean hadn’t been able to sleep either. It felt like he was getting away with something, doing something wrong, to be sleeping just a few feet away from Cas in this little nowhere town.
He sounds angry, and as much as Dean wants to call him ungrateful, tell him off for not having any clue how lucky he is, he finds he can’t do it.
Maybe it’s Cas’ humanity that makes him seem so much closer, more touchable, than he ever had been before, or maybe not, maybe Dean is the one who’s changed in the way that matters. Either way, he doesn’t want to let go of Cas now that he has him. Dean wraps an arm around his waist to steady them, under the trenchcoat, which is itself a kind of thrilling new territory, and Cas shivers slightly at the contact, crowding closer even as he breaks the kiss to take a long, sharp intake of breath.
“You gave up everything to save him,” the Empty says with Chuck’s voice. “‘Now the Winchesters are going to turn your little boy into a smoking crater.”
“Nope,” Dean says cheerfully. “You can try the radio, but it’s all pop country or NPR out here. Oh, or K-TRU, Kansas’ home for Christian inspirational music.”
Sam isn’t there, Cas realizes, looking over his shoulder. He should remember the reason for that. Is Sam in danger? Cas should be doing something about it, if he is. He shouldn’t enjoy being here, in the passengers’ seat, if Sam isn’t safe. It’s his job to keep both of the Winchesters safe.
Cas raises an eyebrow. “What do you expect me to do?” he says. “Use iron and holy water? None of that would work in the Empty.”
He turns his music off self-consciously, avoiding the glare of someone who’s shepherding kids onto a bus. Did he park in the wrong place? He’d tried to follow Cas’ instructions to the letter. Scanning the crowd of children, Jack’s little blond head isn’t immediately visible, and Dean grips the steering wheel.
Cas told Dean once that he didn’t know why God had brought him back, when he’d died during the apocalypse and when he’d walked into that river with the Leviathans. It must have been some part of the game Chuck was playing with them, but Dean knew Chuck wouldn’t be bringing Cas back to him this time. He wanted it all down to the Winchesters, as destroyed as they could be.
? No one has ever called him that before, and yet it feels familiar. “Let’s get it over with quickly this time. You’re dreaming, okay? We’re in the Empty. But I’m gonna get you out. Just stick with me, man, keep up here.”
It was stupid, a kid’s fantasy, and Sam doesn’t want that — and apparently, Cas doesn’t either, or not in the same way.
“No,” Dean says, “not by blood. Or legally. Just — looks up to me, I guess. I feel responsible.” It doesn’t feel quite right to say it, doesn’t feel true, and he finishes his drink, waves down the bartender for another one.
He doesn’t think the place was ever really haunted, or at least it must’ve been taken care of before his time if it was. He remembers, though, that Sam read the book mostly in the backseat of the Impala when he was seven or eight and had a Stephen King phase. That kid must’ve had unpaid library fines all over the country; Dean always told him it was fine to just get a card when they stopped somewhere and drop the books off in the next town, or the next state. They’d get back to where they were supposed to be eventually.
So he straightens up. He looks into his own eyes again, and for the first time in months Dean Winchester feels a goddamn sense of purpose.
The thing is, if there’s a choice between peace and freedom, Dean is going to choose freedom ten times out of ten. It had never really occurred to him that there was a possibility of having both.
Dean didn’t want to let go, not really, but he had to. He pulled back to look at him, and Cas looked back, waiting for him to say something. He couldn’t ask Cas not to go. Cas said nothing, just looked at him with those big sad eyes. Angel of the lord, that’s what Cas was when they met, all pure blazing power wrapped up in a trenchcoat, knocking the lights out when he walked into a room, and Dean made him
“Oh,” Jack says, and then his backpack slides to the floor of the car as he throws his arms around Dean to hug him. Dean can feel himself breathe a sigh of relief as he wraps his arm around the kid — his kid. Jack somehow, for all he’s done, doesn’t hate him. Still wants him around.
“For god’s sake, Dean.” For the first time since Chuck died, Dean doesn’t cut in to point out the irony.
“I wish I had known,” Dean says. “I just wish — if I had any idea, when you walked into this place and told me you just pulled me outta Hell.” He shakes his head. “There’s a lot of things I would do differently.”
The one they’re looking for the little white house at the end of the street. The door has been painted green and the lawn is growing wild, grass clearly untrimmed probably since before Cas bought the place. There’s an air of strangeness to it even on this ordinary suburban street, surrounded by houses without that flash of color or look of wildness.
Dean sighs. “Claire, I get what you’re saying, but it’s just… it’s a little more complicated than that, okay?”
Claire sighs. “I don’t know,” she says. “I mean, there’s not exactly a lot of career options open to people with my skills. And no offense to Jody and Donna, but I am
When they get out of the car, Claire starts to head for the hotel’s door, but Dean throws out an arm to stop her. “You’re not going in there looking like that,” he says. “Let me look at it.”
“Well, I just thought there would be something,” Dean says. His voice is rough, a sudden outburst of emotion that sounds almost angry. “I don’t
Cas asked him what he wanted, Dean remembers. And maybe he can’t answer that quite yet, not totally, but he can tell him what he doesn’t want. “I don’t want to be the guy who let you down,” he says. “I don’t want to be the guy who shows up here once or twice a year to take Jack to baseball games, who he doesn’t really know. I wanna do better than that.”
No, it is not all Cas has wanted. But then, everything he has known he wanted from Dean has come with the accompanying realization that he couldn’t have it. And really, what they had is more than Cas ever thought he would get. There were times, in the past few years, when it has felt like everything. When Dean would make dinner and the four of them would gather around the kitchen table, and Cas would eat something even though in his mouth, it only tasted of its component elements. They would raise a toast to a job well done at the end of a hard day, and Cas would feel as close as he had ever been to belonging.
But this life, in this world. Is there room in that for the two of them? For Dean to be the kind of guy who goes home every day to someone he loves, gathers his family around the table for dinner every night? Someone who pulls Cas close by the hips in an ordinary little kitchen, a firefly caught in his hand that he somehow gets to keep, and dances with him across the tile floor, like ordinary people do every day.
“It’s our family!” Jack says, delighted, brandishing his clumsy, childish drawing. There are five figures in the picture; one with long blonde hair which is clearly Mary, two somewhat generic stick figures — the taller is presumably Sam, the other Dean — a smaller one meant to represent Jack, and Cas, complete with his tie and scribbled, brightly colored wings.
Claire nods like she’s agreeing, and then Dean realizes — “Should I fly? I hate flying. But I wanna get there as soon as I can. Shit, I can’t leave the car here—“
“How could you ever think I’d be better off without you?” Cas says softly, and Dean kisses him then, figuring he’s waited just about long enough.
“Heads up,” Claire says, and tosses him one of the grease-stained paper bags of food. “What the hell are you watching?”
““You didn’t have to come looking for me,” Cas says. “I can’t leave the Empty this time. I chose that, Dean. It’s alright.”
He stands frozen to the spot as Dean looks back to him, raising an eyebrow in acknowledgment. While Ben and Lisa appear to notice nothing, he stands up and walks over to Cas. “Hey,” Dean says. “Don’t teleport away, okay?”
All those years, Cas never really let himself think about what this would feel like, to be wanted — to be loved — in return. It was a solitary thing for him, being in love. When he thought of what he wanted, it was just to say it out loud. He wanted Dean to know, to accept it and to see it, to see himself the way Cas has always seen him. It hadn't been bad, that kind of love. He’d felt blessed to have it. But this, this thing he couldn’t even imagine properly…
“Was that it?” the Empty asks him, raising one of Dean’s eyebrows in amusement. “Not exactly the most impressive moment of happiness, was it?”
He needed Cas to understand that it wasn’t about that, it wasn’t about owing Cas anything. It was about not being able to ask, himself. He’d been so goddamn selfish with Cas for so long, and what he wanted — well, he barely knew what he wanted, but it wasn’t relevant.
Dean pulls away from him after a few moments, but he doesn’t go far. His hand strokes the side of Cas’ face slowly, like he’s memorizing how it feels under his fingertips. He’s beautiful, and he’s smiling, and Cas wants a thousand things at once.
“Oh,” Claire says, “actually, I think it would be a good idea for me to go back to Sioux Falls. Kansas is pretty much on my way.”
. It hurt to look at him, and Dean thought of the eyes Cas had burned out in his true form. He thought of Cas years ago after his purgatory soul power-up, pure good intentions and pure crazy with power, and he wondered if this had been a horrible mistake.
Claire looks at him skeptically out of the corner of her eye before returning her gaze to the car window. “Uh, okay,” she says. “Shoot.”
want them, but Dean’s always thought he would be better at it, of the two of them. He was better with Jack, when Cas wasn’t around. Sam could be a regular Ward Cleaver if he wanted to be.
There’s one moment the Empty replays for him more than any other. It’s a pivotal point in Castiel’s life, he supposes. A breaking point, or a moment of truth.
Castiel has lived the past twelve years in a body that first was not his and then was rebuilt, for him alone, in someone else’s image. He has been human and angelic, possessor and possessed. His true form was once something great and terrifying, but now his true form is this — an unremarkable man in a beige overcoat.
The right thing to do, Dean knew, would be to comfort him, to put his arms around Jack and tell him everything was going to be okay. But Dean knew he didn’t have the right to do that, and anyway it would feel like a lie.
Slowly, Dean lets the phone drop from his hand, and burrows as best he can under the covers. Cas is right, he should sleep, but his mind is still spinning itself in circles.
“I’m actually heading out on the road tomorrow,” he says. “Road trip out to California. Gonna see some of the sights I missed over the years.”
“Wow!” Jack enthuses as soon as he throws open the door of the car. “This is so cool! You brought your car to school!”
