Rhodey veered to the left without hesitation, his chiton beating painfully against his legs as he flew. Lowering himself to the ground where he’d seen the reflection, he made sure to land beside the suit and not on top of it. Rhodey’s hands hovered over the cold metal helplessly, unsure of what to do next. He pulled at the face mask with caution at first—he didn’t even know if he would be able to remove it without Tony’s help. But the suit creaked under the pressure, and Rhodey pulled harder at the mask, his fingers finding a grip and refusing to give until he’d succeeded in ripping the faceplate clean off.
Steve threw the doors to the throne room open, and he was taken aback by the scene there. Every one of the gods had gathered in the great hall, each of them in their respective thrones. He took the few steps to the threshold, and Fury was watching Steve, a smug look on his face. Steve knew that Fury expected him to bend in the presence of all of the Olympians, to give them all the information that he wanted. Steve met the eyes of each of the gods as he walked towards Fury at the head of them. Maria Hill was seated at his right hand, her face a reflection of Fury’s self-satisfied look. On Fury’s left side was Rhodey, who was poised proudly in his seat. The only way that Steve knew that they were of the same mind where Tony was concerned was the miniscule nod that Rhodey sent his direction, so small that Steve would have missed it had he not been looking for it. He let out a deep breath through his nose as he came to a halt before Fury, standing tall, his jaw set as he did his best to maintain his temper. He knew that this setup was supposed to intimidate him into submission, but he refused to be swayed.
He did his best not to fly too fast; he didn’t want to miss Tony if he was somewhere in the wooded area—but if he
Natasha raised an eyebrow, amusement evident on her face, but she didn’t say anything about it. “I just came to check on you,” she said, and Steve couldn’t keep the confused look off of his face. “I may not be the god of love, but I’m observant. You’re worried about him. You care about him.”
“It’s been six weeks, but who’s counting?” Tony asked, sounding sharper than he meant to. Standing up, he wiped his hands on his chiton, the harsh black of the grease staining the fabric. He knew it wasn’t Rhodey’s fault that he was alone. It was Fury’s, and Rhodey was only allowed to visit when the Big Man needed something from Tony.
do it.  But in the end, would it be worth it? The only thing he would gain would be a new location. Every one of the Olympians would hate him more than they already did, and he would still be alone; he would just be at the top of the Mountain, instead of at the bottom of Pyra. And he quite liked Pyra.
Steve shot up, his eyes scanning the dark room, searching for the source of the voice. Natasha stepped out of the shadows, and Steve scrambled to pull the sheets to keep more of his bare chest covered. He had to figure out a way to keep the other Olympians out of his corners.
“That will teach Stark to leave his own personal hell,” Fury boomed, and the fear that had been gripping Steve turned from ice to fire, his body fuming with hatred as he watched the god. Rhodey gripped Steve’s forearm with a strength that Steve was unaware he had, but he was grateful for it in that moment.
Attached was a picture of Steve standing in front of his bathroom mirror—the bathroom that Tony designed for him—but that was something that only registered for the briefest of moments in the back of his mind. Suddenly, his attention was pulled directly to the man in the photo.  He was wearing nothing but his gray underwear, the briefs straining against the muscles in the super soldier’s legs. He held his Stark phone in front of him and Tony cursed his own technology, because he wanted to see the rest of Steve’s chest. It surprised him how badly he wanted to see the rest of Steve’s chest. Suddenly, he didn’t remember who he was originally trying to text.
The Olympian’s dining hall was extravagant, with a courtyard of the gods leading to the open area where everyone ate. The courtyard was filled with statues of the gods, busts of each of the Olympians lining the walkway through the greenery. There were fig trees and wildflowers spread throughout, despite the fact that they were living above the clouds, and Steve was momentarily distracted by the beauty of it. He strolled through the plants, eyes lingering on each of the marble figures. He took his time on the pathway, in no hurry to join the gods at the dining table, but he couldn’t deny his need for food. Steve grabbed breakfast, but he dodged the other Olympians, who were all seated around the long dining table in the clouds. He helped himself to the barley bread and figs that were set out for them, and picked at his food, uninterested in what he was eating as he slipped away from the gathering.
“Oh yeah?” Tony raised an eyebrow, amused. “What did you do to get yourself put on Fury’s shit list?”
He couldn’t avoid Fury all day; he knew that the god of gods was planning some sort of welcoming party, and that he would expect Steve to introduce himself before the big event. Steve started a third lap around the mountain, and before he knew it he was once again standing in front of the estate that was now his. He crossed the threshold and stared in wonder at the elegant entryway surrounding him- the walls were a pristine white marble from top to bottom. Even the stairs in front of him were carved from the luxurious stone. The sight of it made Steve long for his humble home in Athens, surrounded by a community that cared for one another. But the battle being fought between the Athenians and the invading Spartans had left his once beautiful city war-torn. He had no choice but to flee to Olympus where the gods were enthralled by any newcomer.
of the most powerful. And even if he was the most powerful… Well, Steve couldn’t help but think that there was still power in numbers. “So how does he...—why are you guys loyal to him?”
Steve tensed up at that, but kept his gaze straight ahead. “Not really in the mood,” he answered, his tone clipped.
Steve watched Natasha carefully, turning her words over in his head. “You said ‘most of us.’ Are there some that aren’t loyal to him? Are
,” Tony interrupted, going on as if Rhodey hadn’t even spoken. “The only thing I have left to do is bring the weapons system online. Then we can—”
He knew that in the suit, Steve wouldn’t recognize him, and he used that to what he thought was his advantage. But as he got closer and moved to hook his metal-clad arms under Steve’s and lift them both into the sky, Steve made flight increasingly difficult.
“Better now that I’ve left him alone, I’m sure” Steve said, feigning disinterest. He wasn’t sure that he was doing such a good job at it, but Fury needed to think that Steve wasn’t planning on returning to see Tony. He needed to think that Tony wasn’t interested in seeing
made it back home, Rhodey didn’t want to take too long to get there either. He slowed down only a fraction, training his eyes on the ground below him. If he hadn’t been looking for it, he would have missed the familiar gleam of Tony’s suit out of the corner of his eye.
“I told you I would help you with this, Tones. Let me help,” he’d argued, but Tony shook his head, vehemently.
Steve turned to leave the dining hall before any of them could give him a response, and he let out a grateful sigh when he realized that no one was following him. He finished what was left of the barley bread in his hand, and he ate his last couple of figs in a few quick bites. Steve kept walking, but instead of wandering among the clouds of Olympus as he had done the night before, he began to make his way down the side of the mountain. He was headed back towards earth.
He gave Steve a solemn look, and Steve was automatically apologetic. “I know, you’re right. I just. . . wish I could have stayed there. I’ll never get to leave this place now.”
“Talk, Pete,” he said, adamantly. “Just keep talking to me.” Of course it was nice to have another voice in the volcano, but Tony’s concern was for Peter, not for himself. If he could keep him talking, it would give him something to focus on other than the emotions that were warring within him, dangerously close to spilling over.
“How is Tony doing?” Fury asked, aiming for a casual tone, but his voice was strained. His dislike for Tony was so severe that he couldn’t even say his name without the veins in his head pulsing with barely-concealed rage. Steve was almost taken aback. He couldn’t imagine ever hating a person that much, especially not Tony. His thoughts lingered on the god of the forge for a moment longer, remembering his small smile as Steve and Rhodey left Pyra earlier that day.
Fury turned to leave, already losing interest in the exchange. “You will be there,” he told him, already halfway to the door. He hesitated for a second before leaving altogether, then turned around to face Steve once more. “I did come to set a couple of the ground rules. There is only one rule that I forbid anyone from breaking. Tony Stark is not to set foot on Olympus, and the punishment for breaking that rule is banishment to Tartarus. No exceptions.”
Tony flinched at that, and Steve didn’t miss it—he instantly regretted his words. Tony stood and began to take the rest of the suit off. “No one is supposed to be here. Except me. Sometimes Rhodey.” He pulled the rest of the armor off of his body, revealing clothing similar to that of Steve’s chiton. The only difference was that his was covered in burns and grease from his earlier efforts constructing the new suit. He threw the damaged suit back into the corner of his workshop. There went his backup—Mark III would just have to be that much better. He turned to face Steve. “Fury is going to be livid.”
Natasha reached out and put her hand firmly on Thor’s chest, trying to put some distance between him and the god of love. Steve was aware that Rhodey had tensed beside him, but he made no move to defend him, and Steve understood that. Even if Steve had his suspicions about how Rhodey actually felt about Fury, the truth was that he still appeared to everyone else as their leader’s right-hand man. If anyone had overheard the conversation and saw Rhodey come to Steve’s defense, the consequences would be unimaginable.
Fury watched Steve skeptically, and Steve didn’t flinch under his gaze this time. He was growing tired of Fury’s “intimidate into submission” attitude, and he stood tall under the god’s gaze. “So why did he bring you back to the volcano? Mortals would have been returned to the city.”
Fury reached up and scratched the back of his head, thinking about the Messenger God’s words. “We’ll see,” he said. “I believe you, Rhodes, but he was inside Pyra for longer than you ever have been.” Fury turned his angry eyes back towards Steve. “New rule: you are not allowed to leave Olympus without an escort. I don’t trust you, but I trust them.”
He swooped downward, making to grab the man from behind and carry him through the sky to the entrance that he’d come from. “Hey!” he shouted from behind the mask of his suit, and the man swiveled to look at him. It was at this point that Tony realized that he wasn’t looking at just any man. He was fly full speed toward Steve Rogers, the god of love, beauty, desire—all of that. He felt his eyes widen in surprise as he recognized him, but it was too late for him to abandon his original plan of flying them both to safety.
i just wanted to put this disclaimer at the beginning in case it makes anyone uncomfortable, but like i said, it has since been reworked and the only warning that i really think is necessary is the character's struggle with anxiety, and i will tag this chapter and the fic accordingly.
Hello! Here is the first official chapter! I meant to post sooner, but between work and school starting, it's been hard to really nail down a schedule. For now, post days are Wednesdays! Today I'm posting early because my class was canceled, but typically I will post around 3:00 CT. If that ever changes, I'll let everyone know on twitter, which is @tonyscaps, and you can follow me there if you feel like keeping up with my regular shit posting. I don't know what else to put here other than thank you so much for reading. That alone is enough to make my heart swell. And thank you for your comments! They encourage me more than you know. Leave some more, if you'd like! With that, welcome to the dysfunction that is the Olympians. Welcome to Pyra. And welcome back to Olympus.
Peter looked from the armor to Tony and back to the armor again, and the god gave him a nod of encouragement as he reached out to touch it. He ran his hands over the flawed metal surface carefully, hardly believing what he was looking at. Tony watched him closely, his head cocked to one side as he did, studying the way that Peter reacted to the new technology. Not only should mortals be unable to make it to the
“Having a son should be reason enough to stay,” Tony said, still digging around in the chest piece of the armor.
He was pounding away at the warm metal in front of him, his bots at his feet ready to help with anything he may need. He needed the shape of this new suit to be perfect; Tony had made his last one a little bit too bulky, throwing the aerodynamics off. Flight had been possible in Mark II, but too difficult. He couldn’t keep too much weight in the air at one time, and being a god meant Tony had plenty of muscle mass that made him the definition of “too much weight.” Not only had the design been slightly imperfect, but Tony had used the suit to come to the defense of the Athenians upon Sparta’s attack. The opposing city-state’s army had been merciless, and without the other Olympians holding off the attack with them, the Athenian’s defense had given way in the first couple of days. Tony had tried to be of more use to them; he lived among them after all. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that had he not been there fighting, the Olympians would have been more inclined to help the mortals in battle.
Thor shushed Steve before he could say anything else, stepping closer and into his space. Thor’s tone was menacing as he spoke through clenched teeth, his voice low enough to avoid drawing attention to them, but loud enough to make sure that Steve understood. “You’re talking about an all out war. A war that would affect more than just us. Think of the city, of the Athenians. There would be chaos and disaster in every corner of the earth. Fury would make sure of it.”
Steve shifted on his feet, unsure of what to say next. He didn’t agree with Natasha—that once Fury made up his mind, no one could fight back. They
Tony pulled his feet up under him, sitting on his couch and studying the image on his phone. Steve’s blonde hair was almost brunette with moisture, and he had probably just gotten out of the shower. His mouth was shaped into a small smirk; it was obvious that asshole knew how good he looked. His stomach muscles were rigid, and Tony couldn’t tell if Steve was flexing or if the serum had truly pulled the skin that
bow and arrows, even Fury’s lightning bolts were designed by him. It wasn’t until he started creating things that could be a problem for Fury the he exiled him.”
The next day on Olympus was for Steve’s welcoming celebration, and apparently it was to be an all day event, something that Steve himself was very disgruntled with. Fury had made it clear that, since the party was in his honor, he was expected to be present all day. At an sort of social gathering was the last place that Steve wanted to be, but after angering Fury as much as he had yesterday, Steve wouldn’t risk pissing him off any more today. Early that morning, the minor gods from all over Greece had begun arriving, and before lunch time, the top of Mount Olympus was filled with more immortal beings that Steve had ever seen in one place.
Tony stood on shaky, metal-clad legs, and began to tug at the suit, pulling the dead metal off of his body. The suit had powered down in the fall, and at this point, the only way to get it off was to pry it off.  “Look, I know—I
Peter shrugged, finally done unravelling the mess of wires in front of him. He set them on the table, making his way back to where he had been sitting before. “Sure, maybe he was,” he began, his sad eyes watching Tony as he spoke. “But where is he now?”
“I’ve had a couple of run-ins with him already,” Steve told the gods, and though none of them seemed surprised, they weren’t relieved at the news either.
Fury left without another word, leaving Steve to stand alone in his new bathroom. His hands were still clutching his tunic around his waist, and, finally alone, he dropped his clothes to the floor. He turned the faucet and found that the bathtub was charmed, and it was filled to the rim with steaming water before he could turn the nozzle the whole way. He cut the water and slid into the tub, his eyes drifting shut as the hot water caressed his bare skin. His thoughts lingered on Fury’s final instructions: No Tony Stark, no matter what.
Less than a second later, something clicked. Tony was speeding towards the clouds, higher than he’d ever flown before.
Going up through the top of the volcano was out of the question, seeing as the volcano had already started spewing lava and ash with Tony’s earlier work. It was like instead of Tony’s body tiring with the labor of forging new creations, his home tired instead, groaning on protest and spraying ash to dissuade him from creating. Rather than going up, Tony headed through the cavern that was his side entrance, flying at highest speed that his old suit would allow. Once outside, he circled the top of the volcano once before he spotted who had tripped the alarm.
Steve sat up a little straighter in his bed, the sheets pooled at his waist, but he couldn’t be bothered with them this time. This new information gave him a glimmer of hope that he wanted so badly to grasp on to and run with—the hope that there could be some sort of  unity among the gods, something to persuade them to rise up against Fury. “So what did you come here to tell me?” Steve persisted, looking at the goddess in front of him with an unspoken challenge in his eyes.
Tony weighed his next words carefully. He knew that nothing that he could say would alleviate the anxiety Peter was feeling right now, but he wanted to ease his mind a little bit. “This—” he began, leaning forward and running his hand over the suit, “is the Mark III. It’s a work in progress again, but I had it up and running yesterday. It’s a weapon. When it needs to be.”
Tony shifted in his seat, leaning away from the suit, and folding his hands in his lap. He was uncomfortable, too—unsure of the way he should talk to the boy in front of him. “There’s nothing to apologize for,” he said, finally. There wasn’t—not really. He had fallen in, and Tony had caught him. He wouldn’t have let any harm come to the kid, anyway; that wasn’t the kind of god Tony was.
“No clue,” Rhodey shrugged again. “But I can tell you that the new god is there already. Well, he’s not a new god, but it’s his first time on Olympus. Steven, god of beauty, love, and desire. He’s an older, major god, but he’s been living in his temple in Athens among the people. Been there for thousands of years, but it was getting harder for him to live in the city, what with him being the most beautiful man on the planet and all.” Rhodey shook his head, scoffing at the thought; he had seen Steve himself, he wasn’t
Tony was making progress with the Mark III—and he was more scared by that fact than he should have been. After all the time he had put into perfecting it, he should have been thrilled to be this close to being done, but his nearly-completed suit made the impending threat more real. Flying outside of Pyra, as Rhodey had said, meant infuriating Fury—and infuriating Fury meant unimaginable danger. But Tony needed to test the suit’s flight before he could progress any further.
Steven jogged through the clouds at the top of Mount Olympus, trying his best to steer clear of the other gods under the guise of exercise. He had already been welcomed warmly by Clint and Natasha, who had shown him to his new house in the sky. He had already decided that everything on Olympus was a little excessive, including his new place. Most people expected the god of beauty to bask in the attention and adoration of the people, and even of the other gods, but he wasn’t inclined to do so. He preferred his privacy. He knew how everyone saw him, and he loathed the idea of people flocking to him just to merely
Finally, Rhodey had finished the reconstruction of the arms just as Tony was pounding the craters out of the helmet. “It should be ready,” Tony breathed, but his hands shook as he lifted the iron mask away from the rest of the armor. He moved  it to the opposite of the table the stood, arms spread wide in the center of the workshop. “Give me some space,” he said, and Rhodey rose from his seat on workbench, crossing the cavern and standing as close to the wall as he could.
Clint looked at him, his eyes alight with curiosity. “Better days than your first day on Olympus?” he asked, intrigued. He twisted his arrow between his fingers in one hand, swinging his bow with the other.
Fury sat forward on his throne, no longer in the relaxed position that he’d begun the conversation in. “You’re telling me,” he huffed, “that the god of the forge, fire, and
Before they could talk about anything else, Thor approached the two of them in the great hall, with none other than Natasha Romanoff following shortly behind him. Steve tensed automatically, preparing for something similar to his earlier interaction with Clint, but Rhodey nudged him discreetly. “They’re cool. No trouble.” Steve didn’t relax completely, but Rhodey was a better judge of the Olympians than he was, and he was reassured at his words.
Tony struggled to keep his grip on Steve’s shoulders, and he could already feel his old suit starting to give under the weight of
Steve is far from comfortable in his new home, and he's already wary of Nick Fury. What happens when he comes face to face with the rest of the Olympians?
Tony looked away from him, the laughter disappearing from his eyes. “Preparations,” he said, his voice tight with apprehension. “Something big is coming. But that’s a story for another day.”
sorry to keep everybody waiting, but this chapter is special to me. if you've read the tags, then you know what's (or who's) coming. if not, get ready for a little surprise!
at him. Steve knew that he had more to offer than just his outward appearance, but it seemed that no one around him was interested.
Peter took closed his eyes tightly, and when he spoke again, there was no trace of the tremor it had held moments before. Instead, he spoke with a ferocity that Tony didn’t think him capable of. “My mom was killed in the streets, right in front of me. They didn’t even do it on purpose—I don’t know if that makes it better or worse. The Spartans were riding through the city, slinging swords, and one of them caught her across the chest on accident. And he
Clint and Natasha had warned him about Tony before they’d even reached the gates of Olympus, but most of what he knew about the god had come from the townspeople in Athens. He was rumored to be a recluse, hiding away in his volcanic workshop all hours of the day. He’d heard stories of people getting too close to the mountain and being escorted away by Tony’s automatons, and Steve had always recoiled from the thought of the god alone in the bottom of a volcano for eternity.
He studied the god in front of him; he’d seen statues and heard stories, but none of that could do the man justice. When they called him the most beautiful man on the planet, they weren’t kidding. Steve had a thin white linen draped over his left shoulder, leaving the right side if his chest exposed, and the skin was pulled taught over the muscles there. His blonde hair was longer than Tony had seen it on the statues in the city, and his eyes were a startling blue, even in the dim light of the cavern. Tony was, for the first time in a long time, stunned speechless.
Tony was working furiously in the bottom of his volcano, intent of finishing the prototype of his new suit. He knew that he would have to bring the weapons online eventually, but first he wanted to perfect the suit’s flight. Any of the other gods would simply charm the ability to fly onto an inanimate object, but not Tony. He had the ability to create something with his
was the last thought that crossed Tony’s mind. Before he could linger on it, let it overwhelm him, let the thought swallow him completely—he blacked out.
Fury didn’t miss the challenge in the man’s voice, and he quirked an eyebrow up at him in response. He wasn’t enraged by Steve’s words, but amused, and Steve didn’t like that at all. “I came to tell you that the other Olympians have insisted on a welcoming party for you, tomorrow night. I expect you’ll be there?”
He ascended the stairs to find his bathroom, intent on soaking away the stress of this never-ending day. He began to untie the sash holding his tunic around his waist, and as the linen fell from his shoulder, he heard someone clear their throats behind him.
“And beauty, and desire,” Tony interrupted. “I know who you are. I’m Tony, god of…this” he said, gesturing at the contents of the volcano, his bots and inventions scattered everywhere. He crossed the workshop, righting the bots that had been overturned in the confusion. “Welcome to Pyra.”
Tony scolded himself for not answering, but he made a mental note—he would call him tomorrow. He had four text messages from Steve and he couldn’t help but roll his eyes. It was probably something about that stupid new team building exercise that Captain Handsome wanted to try. He scrolled and scrolled, looking for something, anything from Pepper: a missed call, text message, email. Hell, he would take a business email if it meant that he could talk to her, but it didn’t look like anything at Stark Industries required his immediate attention. Go fucking figure.
Steve gaped at Thor, his mouth hanging open. He cleared his throat, hoping that a blush wasn’t already working it’s way up his neck. “He’s not
I haven't said any of my thank you's, mainly because there's so many people to thank for encouraging me to keep going with this fic. Honestly I have a list going and I was going to do one big thank you at the end, but there are a couple of people that I have to say thank you to like
“Hello, Steve,” Thor greeted, his voice rumbling deep in his chest and a grin spreading from ear to ear with genuine excitement. Steve couldn’t help but notice that this Thor was very different from the Thor he’d seen in the throne room last night—with sad eyes and a somber face. Steve returned a hesitant smile, not because he was nervous, but because he didn’t know whether or not to trust Thor yet.
“Already wishing you were back at Pyra, huh?” Rhodey asked, lowering his voice at the mention of Tony’s volcano. He gave Steve a knowing look, a smirk playing at his lips.
Steve stepped into his new home, his eyes absorbing the details that he had missed upon his earlier arrival: the invaluable art hanging on the walls, the lavish furniture throughout, the oversize windows allowing natural light to pour in from all sides. He moved slowly through the halls, familiarizing himself with the building once again. He would be living here for the rest of his immortal life, after all.
By the time he’d made it to the familiar cavern entrance, Rhodey had sweat running down the side of his face and he was nearly dead on his feet. He pulled Tony through the cave, walking steadily toward the workshop itself. As soon as he made it to the bed on the opposite side of Tony’s workspace, he laid Tony down as gently as he could manage with the suit still confining his body. Rhodey moved to the other side of the room, sitting heavily on the workbench, his head resting in his hands.
He wasn’t prepared for how quickly he plummeted to the ground. In his recklessness, his only thought was ‘What could go wrong?’ —even as he rapidly approached the earth.
“Why do you need this?” Peter asked, rolling the helmet in his hands just to keep them moving as he spoke.
Steve shifted on his feet uncomfortably. “I, um—I broke your statue in the courtyard on Olympus. It was an accident, but it was… it was already in pretty bad shape. Clint likes to use it for target practice apparently. He wasn’t happy.”
Steve gets comfortable in the hearth that is Pyra, but his absence on Olympus does not go unnoticed.
The thunder shook the volcano around him and Tony distracted himself from his worries by pacing the length of his workshop. His bots were in their charging ports, but upon sensing his sudden movement, they whirred to life and followed him as he walked. He glanced down and smiled at them for a moment. Even if they were robots, they were able to provide more comfort than he’d ever imagined. Every now and then they got on his nerves, but at times like this he was grateful to have them around. It was as if they could pick up on his emotions through some connection that they’d formed when he’d activated them.
Before he could deny Clint’s request again, he felt a large hand clasp him on the back. He turned the slightest bit to see Thor at his left side, his ever-present trident in his hand, and Natasha at his flank. “Yes! We should all go together,” he insisted, urging Steve forward with the firm grip on his shoulder.
Tony’s body relaxed as he listened; he knew Natasha and Thor both very briefly before he’d been exiled, but it was what he’d heard about them through the city that comforted him. Natasha was a protector; that was just who  she was. Anyone who could not protect themselves, she was there to help. Tony knew Thor’s history, too—his brother had enraged Fury, and the god had been thrown to the Underworld. Not far off from Tony’s own situation, he thought, laughing bitterly to himself. Natasha and Thor—they would do right by Steve.
Tony moved to lay down on the couch, the days without sleep, the alcohol, and the vigorous orgasm catching up with him. He laid on his back with his phone resting over the arc reactor’s scar on his chest. The phone buzzed one final time and Tony read the text, a hesitant, disbelieving grin covering his face before he finally passed out.
Steve was still looking at Fury, but he arched an eyebrow, testing just how far Fury’s patience was willing to go. “I’ve yet to hear him ask a question.”
“Yes, there’s Steve,” Rhodey sighed, but he couldn’t keep the smile off his face entirely. “You guys and your plotting. You’re fucking perfect for each other.”
Natasha recognized the taunt in his voice and on his face, but she didn’t react. She stood to leave his room with ease, headed towards the french doors on the opposite side of the bed. With one hand on the door, she looked over her shoulder before opening it, her red hair framing her face, preventing Steve from reading any of the emotions there. “Not everyone here is his enemy, Steve. Or yours. When we have a plan, when there is a way to
over his muscles. It wasn’t until the phone buzzed again that he realized he’d gotten so caught up staring, he never responded to Steve’s message.
“Now look what you’ve done,” he laughed. “I’ve got to go find something else to shoot at now. You’re coming with me.”
“No dad,” Peter confirmed, and his tone turned sad, but it wasn’t for his dad that he mourned. It was for his mother. “Mom said he left before I was born. The only thing I know about him came from her stories.”
“I guess I will be,” Steve sighed, unable to hide his irritation. He knew what the party would turn into—a competition for his affection. It was one of the disadvantages of being the god of desire, everyone wanted to be friends with the prettiest guy in the room. Fury watched him carefully, still gauging the attitude of the newcomer. Steve could tell that if he wasn’t there already, he’d just made it to the top of the god of gods’ shit list.
Tony’s face softened a tiny bit, and even though it was only a little change, Rhodey caught it. “You’re right. I know you are. I just—I don’t know. When people take my side, or when I take their side—terrible things happen. I’m just preparing for the worst to happen.”
the only other thing i wanted to say is that this chapter was originally written when i was struggling with something pretty personal, so it has the potential to be interpreted rather darkly. i rewrote it a couple of weeks ago, because it just didn't feel right to subject this guy to what i was going through. but obviously if you read it a different way, you can probably guess where i was coming from.
Steve made fairly good time on his way back to Olympus. He walked steadily up the side of the mountain, and the sun sat on the other side of the city as he traveled. The red-orange hue cast over the city left a twinge of sadness  in his chest; Steve’s Athens was no longer the same as it once was. It was bruised and battered and dirty--torn to pieces by war. He looked away from the city, focusing on the path ahead of him. Steve watched his feet as he walked so as not to trip over any loose branches that had fallen from the trees, and before he knew it, he had made it to the grand entry in the clouds. The peak of Olympus.
He heard an amused laugh come from the direction of the breakfast table, and he glanced up cautiously. Steve knew that Fury had been watching him, but he wasn’t sure how he would react to the shattered effigy. Fury stood from the table, his eyes squinted in Steve’s direction, but his mouth was pulled in a tight-lipped smile. “Don’t worry about it,” his voice carried across the dining table and through the courtyard. “It was bound to happen sooner or later.”
“Trust me, friend,” Thor cut in. “My brother has been thrown from Olympus, just as your Tony Stark has been.”
Tony’s workshop kept him busy anyway. Between the updates on his automatons and his new project—flight—he never really had time to leave his volcano. The only time he ventured outside was when any of the surrounding mortals wandered a little too close to the base of the mountain. Sometimes the strength of a god inside a volcano brought unintended eruptions.  He didn’t want to get too ensnared in his work and overlook an unsuspecting mortal—he quite liked the fragile beings. The other gods thought he kept the mortals away because of his recluse status, but he never bothered to correct them. People that stayed too close to Tony tended to get hurt.
Tony went back to work, watching Peter out of the corner of his eye; he wouldn’t stop worrying about the kid any time soon. His mind was reeling at a pace that he couldn’t keep up with. How did Peter get into Pyra? Why could Peter touch the suit? Why didn’t it seem to hurt him? Mortals couldn’t touch anything constructed by a god, much less the Mark III. The results were deadly—skin burning bright red, flesh melting off of bones. He’d seen it happen before, but Peter hadn’t so much as flinched when he’d brushed his hands over the armor.
Rhodey flashed a smile at him, but it was tainted with the bitterness of his departure. He kicked his feet up and flew through the volcano, turning his body to fly though the opening at the top.
of Fury, but there was something disconcerting about the way the man was looking at him—it was more like he was looking through him.
of us are loyal to him, but most of us only abide because we have to. He has power over us—people we love that would be in danger if we were to fight back.”
“Okay,” Steve mumbled around a mouth full of food. He looked away from Clint, setting his eyes straight ahead as he walked. He was certain that Clint got the message—that he wanted to be left alone—but he ignored it regardless. “I’ve had better days.”
“Right,” Steve murmured. “I knew that.” He really did know what the Olympians were gods of, but matching names and faces to people he’d only ever seen in statues before was more difficult than he’d care to admit.
Steve chuckled weakly, and as he turned to walk back towards, he saw Thor and Natasha rise from their seats out of the corner of his eye. He turned his attention back to Clint, who was staring open mouthed at the pile of marble on the ground. Once he noticed that Steve was looking at him, he beamed at the man.
“That you knew of,” Steve was quick to interrupt her. He didn’t believe for a second that Tony would leave Rhodey on Pyra without some serious threat to their safety.
Now, Steve was walking aimlessly, pushing through the crowds of gods on Olympus. He made his way to the throne room, scenes from the Olympians’ meeting the night before playing in his mind. All of the other Olympians had gathered in the great hall, and the minor gods that were visiting had dispersed throughout the dining hall, courtyards, and the rest of the mountain, exploring the place as they pleased. Everyone in the throne room were talking and laughing amongst themselves, glasses in their hands always filled with drinks to their likings. The glasses were charmed to refill as soon as they were emptied of their contents, so the gods drank freely, the alcohol taking effect on their immortal bodies—and the day was only halfway through. Despite there being a party going on, Fury was seated in his throne and everyone gathered around him in a loose circle. Steve scoffed to himself, the obvious power move of the god annoying him. It was as if Fury was saying, ‘Yes, I’m the leader. If you want to see me, you have to come
“No, he never did.” Peter let the necklace hang, the charm glinting in the dim light of Pyra once more. “But my mom never spoke a bad word against him. She always said that he was a good man. I started to, once…—to ask her why she still loved him. You know, even after he left us.” The boy went back to work on the wires, slowly unraveling them without really realizing what he was doing. “I remember she got really quiet. All she said was that he wouldn’t have left without a good reason.”
A small smile graced Peter’s lips and he kicked at Tony’s hand with his sandaled feet. He reached up to tuck the small pendant at his neck back into the linen of his tunic. “Thank you. Really. I mean,
about it. He kept riding. She crumpled right in front of me, and I was able to pull her into an alley. But I...—I couldn’t get her home, and she died in the street. Like an animal—my mom. She left me alone.”
“She died when the Spartans attacked.” Peter sat forward, propping his elbows on his knees and resting his head in his hands. Tony tensed—Peter had only just barely subdued a panic attack, and talking about his mother’s death couldn’t be easy for him. Still, he was visibly much calmer. The anxiety no longer wracked his body, and he took slow, even breaths as he spoke, so Tony didn’t protest. “We were trying to get back home, but they were riding through the city, swinging blades on all sides. We were almost home, but there were people running in every direction, and the streets were crowded. She had me on the opposite side of her, closest to the buildings. She was trying to protect me, and I heard the horse coming before I knew what was happening. I mean I knew...—I had to know what was happening. I knew, but I couldn’t stop it. She pushed me into amwall, out of the way, and I was tripping trying to keep up with her. God, she was so scared, and I remember all I wanted was to be home.”
“He’s telling the truth,” Rhodey finally spoke, lifting his head to meet Fury’s startled gaze. “Nick, I go to and from there all the time when you ask me to. I haven’t seen him working on anything; you know I would’ve told you if I had.”
Tony gasped audibly; he never expected something like this from the Good Captain. But suddenly all he could think about was what it would feel like for Steve to suck him off—how it would feel to have his tongue pressed flat against the underside of Tony’s dick, for Steve to flick his tongue against the slit on the head. In a split second, Tony had stripped completely, his boxers joining the rest of his clothes on the living room floor. He started to stroke himself lazily, his other hand still holding his phone as he tried to think of something to say to Steve.
this?” he mused  aloud, his voice barely above a whisper yet filled with awe. Tony pretended not to hear him and he schooled his face into a neutral expression. He was proud of his suit; it was his best yet. To have someone recognize the magnitude of his work gave made him a sense of fulfillment that he never knew he needed.
fly him alone. Fortunately, they only had a short distance to go, but Steve wasn’t making this easy. Tony sighed, frustrated with the man that he had in his arms. “If you could please—just be still. I will put you down as soon as I can.”
again. Tony swelled with pride at the thought of Steve, on Olympus, conversing with the other gods and speaking in hushed tones about Fury. He knew that the thought should worry him more than anything—Steve being so reckless. But he couldn’t help the flush that crept up his neck at the idea—someone else was on Olympus looking out for him.
Natasha nodded solemnly. “Yes, that we knew of,” she allowed. “But after he left, there were whispers around Olympus, and people were saying nasty things about Tony. This was centuries ago, and the whispers haven’t stopped. Whatever rumors Fury started about Tony—they’ve just kept spreading for hundreds of years. Whether they’re true or not, he’s been feeding them to all of the Olympians, and with Tony unable to defend himself—who do you think they’re going to believe?”
Before they could make it any further down the courtyard’s pathway, Steve ducked out of Thor’s grip and sidestepped the three gods. “I really don’t feel up for it,” he told them, a feigned apologetic look gracing his features. “Maybe some other time. I just want to go back to my quarters.”
“You can only climb so high kid,” Rhodey said, crossing his arms in front of his chest. Peter glanced at him, but he immediately withdrew at the god’s words.
“He’ll do the same for you,” Natasha told Steve, holding his gaze as she spoke, her voice lower than it had been. “He knows your weakness now, or at least has a guess. He’ll hold that over you. Be careful. There are no lengths he won’t go to.”
okay,” he said, his voice still weak and bordering on pleading. “It’s just—you’re up there, and now—now Steve is up there. Anything could go wrong at any moment. At
of his volcanic workshop, but no human would be able to wield the weapon of a god—and Mark III was perhaps the deadliest of them. But Peter ran his hands almost lovingly over the chipped red paint, and his eyes glazed over in wonder.
Peter shifted closer to the work table, using both hands to pull up the metal arm, looking at it closely and tugging at a couple of  loose wires. Tony reached out involuntarily to stop him, still wary of any harm that the suit may cause the kid. But Peter looked at him, his face showing nothing but innocence and confusion, and Tony sat back, raising his hands in surrender.
Tony shrugged again, looking up at Rhodey. “I didn’t give him that idea. You know I didn’t,” he argued. “Fury already hates the guy; maybe it’s just time that the Fury Regime comes to an end. Fucking finally.” Tony looked away from Rhodey, but the anxiousness rippling through his body was making it hard for him to appear so nonchalant.
He twisted and turned in Tony’s grip, shouting in surprise. “Who are you? Let me go!” he roared, looking up towards Tony’s masked face as they flew towards Pyra. “Put me down!”
Tony stood abruptly, walking with purpose around the workshop and picking up pieces of metal as he went. “The faster we get this fixed, the better,” he said, bending with difficulty to gather some of the scraps. The bruising on his body had started to heal already, but Tony knew it would take a couple of days to get back to normal all together.
Almost halfway through his bottle, Tony couldn’t bring himself to tinker with any of the projects that surrounded him. Dum-E nudged his foot lovingly, trying to bring Tony back out of his downward spiral, but all the bot got in return was a frustrated grunt as Tony sent him back to his charging station.
He walked to the cavern exit on the wall to the side of him, and the bots started to follow him, but once they realized he was leaving, they fell back to their charging ports. If Dum-E was able, he would have whined nervously. They could sense the anxiety rolling off of Tony’s body, even through the new suit. Tony knew that Fury was pissed, and Rhodey would kill him if he knew that Tony was stepping outside of the volcano. But he had to know if the suit flew, and he couldn’t afford to wait. He needed to know
“Tony,” he tried again, his voice still hesitant. “Look, I’m sorry. For everything earlier. I didn’t know what this place was. Well—” he stuttered. “I’ve heard stories about the god in exile. But I didn’t know—I didn’t realize this was where you lived.”
. If he had a godly father, it would make sense that he’d never met him. Fury strictly forbade interaction between godly parents and their demigod children.
Steve returns to Olympus reluctantly, and he has to deal with the Olympians' questions about their enemy in the volcano, but Steve doesn't know who to trust quite yet. Tony makes progress on his work.
Instead, he walked slowly back to his empty room, his sandaled feet dragging as he went. He walked through the cold, white stone house, and the stark contrast that it stood to Prya was overwhelming.  He crawled into his bed, the satin of the blush pink sliding against his skin easily. The bed was cold, and Steve sighed heavily, closing his eyes as his head hit the pillow.
Steve corrected her mentally. But he wouldn’t argue this any further in front of the rest of them. All he would do is infuriate Fury and Hill further, and none of the other gods would come to his defense. Steve wasn’t naive enough to expect that. “I don’t think that he does,” he muttered, “but I’m telling you, I couldn’t see anything that he was working on.”
Steve’s eyes widened minutely before he shushed Rhodey, looking around with subtlety to make sure that Fury wasn’t listening in on their conversation. “Maybe a little bit,” Steve told him, his voice just above a whisper. “Olympus is exhausting.”
Tony came back around to sit at his workbench and Dum-E and You sat patiently at his feet, while Butterfingers whirred back around to his charging base. Tony toyed the wires that he had been working on, hardly attempting to finish the hardwiring of the suit. He knew that he needed to be ready in case Fury’s anger took a turn for the worst tonight, but he couldn’t think about anything other than the god of love.
Tony grinned, handing some of the scraps to his friend, who returned the gesture. “Don’t worry,” Rhodey insisted. “We’re gonna get you out of here.”
Before he could disappear completely, he heard his name being called from behind him. Steve looked over his shoulder and saw Clint rise from the table to catch up to him. He slowed his pace, but Steve didn’t stop walking altogether, and the other god took this as an invitation to join him. He resisted the urge to sigh aloud as Clint jogged over to him, matching his pace once he caught up.
Fury stepped closer to Steve, daring him to move backwards again. Steve stood in place this time, anticipating Fury’s power move before he had even made it. “I hope your new quarters are to your liking,” he began, eyeing the bathtub behind Steve. “The Olympians have been looking forward to your arrival.”
Rhodey would take his side, but even then, they would be going up against everyone else on Olympus. That was the power of seven major gods, and no doubt Fury would rope in the minor gods to fight his battles alongside him. The only army Tony would have would be an army that he built for himself. All things considered, he
Steve couldn’t find it in himself to be surprised, but he caught his clothes before they could hit the ground entirely. Turning to face the offender, he was calm as he met Nick Fury’s gaze. He held his tunic at his hips, careful not to expose anymore of his body to the god of gods.
Steve simply shrugged in response; he didn’t feel the need to explain himself to Clint. An awkward silence hung in the air as Steve refused to answer Clint’s question, but Clint persisted anyway. He was determined to make friends with the god of love, and this was something that Steve had grown accustomed to.
“She used to tell me stories to calm me down,” Peter began. He pulled his necklace out from the collar of his tunic once more, holding it where Tony could see it. “I’ve had this since I was old enough to walk; she said it was a gift from my dad. Not...—Not for me. For my mom. She said it was his promise that he would come back, but...–”
Thor nodded solemnly, “My brother—he may not have been the best, but he was still my brother—he’s been trapped in the Underworld for centuries, given the task of overseeing the souls of the dead. He and Fury had a disagreement, we’ll say. That was his punishment; he’s trapped there. I tried to defend him, but Fury . . . he wouldn’t hear any other sides. His mind was made up, and the consequences for insubordination are always disastrous.”
Rhodey shrugged with nonchalance,  a motion telling Steve that Rhodey knew exactly what he was talking about. “Olympus stays exhausting, man,” he said. “Imagine having to carry all of Fury’s over-dramatic messages to people all over the world who couldn’t care less. Also exhausting.”
This was the best idea he had ever had, and he had created his first bot before he’d even hit puberty. He swung his legs around and sat up straight on the couch, suddenly in a hurry to get his pants off. He shimmied his pants down around his ankles and to the floor, and his dirty band tee wasn’t far behind. In less than a minute, Tony sat in his big, empty living room in nothing but his small, black boxer-briefs. He clutched his phone, opening the camera and repositioning himself on the couch. He had his back to the massive windows behind him, setting a backdrop for his picture. Pepper would like that, he thought drunkenly, the New York City skyline in the background of his nudes. He kneeled on the couch and put his phone out in front of him, hesitating only a split second before deciding to grab himself with his free hand and taking the picture. He looked at it long enough to make sure he looked good and sent it without a second thought. The lower half of his face was in frame, showing off his trademark half-assed smirk and messy beard.
Without thinking about where he was going, Steve’s feet seemed to carry him to Athens on impulse. He traveled down the side of Mount Olympus with ease, and trekked through the wooded area surrounding the base of it. In nothing but his light tunic and sandals, he wasn’t dressed for a hike, but it didn’t really matter. Being an immortal deity meant being unaffected by things like weather and walking conditions. He could walk for days without breaking so much as a sweat, and he’d done it before. This was nothing new for him.
“Don’t. Move,” Rhodey hissed under his breath. All of the attention was on Fury, and he turned to look over the crowd that had begun to gather in the throne room. Rhodey dug his fingers into Steve’s arm, making sure that he was listening before he continued. “You don’t leave Olympus. I’ll go check on him after everyone goes to bed, and I’ll tell you what I know. If Fury knows that I left, I can tell him that it was to warn Tony again. If you go with me, he’ll know that’s a lie. Do. Not. Leave. This. Mountain.”
Instead of a text, Steve sent a picture next, his cock standing straight up and a hand wrapped firmly around it. Tony squeezed his eyes shut and stroked himself faster, precum starting to leak from the tip of his penis. He sent one last picture to Steve before throwing the phone onto the couch beside him and turning his full attention to the throbbing between his legs. He whimpered to himself as he used both hands, one at the base and his hips bucking up into the other. It was amazing how close he already was after only a few rough pumps, his calloused hands running over his slick cock with ease. The pressure began to build in his lower abdomen and his hips started to move sporadically; he only slowed down long enough to check the phone after it buzzed on the couch next to him. He opened the message from Steve.
“I needed to be ready,” Tony answered, his voice just above a whisper. “I needed to be ready, and now I’m not. I’ll have to rebuild.”
“I’ve told you, please call me Steve,” the oher god replied, sending a tight lipped smile in Fury’s direction. He looked around at the other gods once more, though each of them had their eyes on Fury. They were all here though: Hill, Rhodey, Natasha, Clint, Thor, and Hulk. Everyone of them had their eyes locked on their leader as they awaited the beginning of the interrogation, save for Thor, who glanced in Steve’s direction. Steve wasn’t sure if he’d imagined it, but Thor’s eyes almost looked... sad. As if he’d been in Steve’s position before. Without lingering on that thought too much, Steve turned to face Fury once again.
“Tell me about yourself, kid,” Tony spoke abruptly, not looking up from the suit. “I like to talk while I work. It’ll be nice to have someone to talk to that’s not the fucking walls.”
“I’m sure Steve has become acquainted enough with Fury already to know that he should be taken seriously,” Rhodey cut in, and Steve was thankful for him filling the silence.
Rhodey walked with purpose to the edge of the mountain, and Steve followed at a short distance behind him. Turning on his heel at the exit, Rhodey sent Steve a heated glare. “You’re not coming with me, Rogers,” he said with finality.
Steve nodded once, still appraising the situation. He may have been new to Olympus, but he’d heard what the mortals said about Fury on Earth: a man whose anger was matched only by his own power. He’d kill for something as insignificant as a disagreement at the dinner table. “Yes, it’s very different from Athens,” Steve answered. “Clint and Natasha showed me to the house earlier, but I haven’t met the other gods yet. So far, everyone has been cordial.” Steve leveled his stare at Fury in silent defiance, as if to say, “go ahead, prove me wrong.”
Tony went back to his work, fiddling with the metal armor in front of him He had created one suit before, and it sat, barely used in the corner of his workshop. He stared longingly at it, knowing that all he needed to do was put it on to fly after Rhodey and out into the world. But it wouldn’t last a second against the wrath of Fury if he disobeyed direct orders, and in the end, it wouldn’t be worth the risk. The old suit worked, but it wasn’t
His phone buzzed with a reply in less than a minute, and Tony’s heart could have leapt out of his chest.
. Thank you to Victoria for being the first person to let me rant to about this fic, and for reading every chapter for me, you're an angel, a saint. Thank you Tiger for also listening to me rant about this fic, even when I have literally no idea what the fuck I'm talking about. Thank you for letting me bounce ideas off of you, you're the absolute best writing buddy. (To anyone reading these notes, read String Theory cowards. Tiger is amazing.) There are so many more people that I need to thank, but these two are so very important to me. Love you guys.
Tony was a little more than halfway there, and he was gaining momentum steadily, but it wasn’t enough. Thunder clapped threateningly close, and without warning, a shock ran through the suit. A bolt had made contact, and Tony’s whole body felt as it was on fire, a current setting every nerve ending aflame. He went down, spinning out of control, his head hitting the side inside of the suit ruthlessly. Tony squeezed his eyes shut, bracing for impact, and he’d hit the ground at top speed in no time. The metal shielded his body from considerable damage, but a sickening screech filled the air as he slid through the dirt. He came to a halt, his head just shy of a boulder in the area surrounding Pyra.
“Rise and shine, buddy,” Rhodey gave his friend a half-hearted smile. “I told you not to do anything stupid.”
She left without another word, the gold linen of her dress flowing behind her as she left, and Steve hopped up to slam the door shut. He stood with his back to the window, his brain racing and his chest heaving as he tried to wrap his brain around his encounter with the huntress of Olympus. He wanted nothing more than to run to Pyra—to give Tony some of the hope that had his own heart in a frenzied state. But he knew that all he could do was wait for Rhodey to return and tell him what Natasha had said. Maybe then, they could begin constructing a plan. Steve didn’t care who he made enemies out of. He would free Tony from his exile. He would bring him home.
Peter shifted his weight, moving one hand to rub his chest, and Tony couldn’t tell if the kid even knew he was doing it. His red eyes focused on the wall ahead of him, and the resolve to stay calm was apparent on his face, though Tony was familiar with that as well. It’s so much easier said than done.
Hello! Welcome back! I was nervous I wouldn't make my deadline today with my schoolwork, but we're doing it! And chapter 3 is here!
Steve withheld another smartass comment; he thought for sure that Fury would strike him down then and there. Instead of providing him with an answer, Steve stared at him in silent defiance. Fury didn’t break the eye contact, but Hill shifted at his right side, growing impatient. Steve’s gaze flicked to her for a moment as she readjusted in her seat, resting her elbow on the arm of her throne and her head in her hand. She huffed to herself before breaking the silence. “It would be better for you,” she began, drawing out her words as if she was talking to a child, “if you told him what he wanted to know.”
“What do you know about where I’m supposed to be?” he asked, his voice halfway between incredulous and furious. “Aren’t you Olympus’s favorite hermit?”
fight back, but there was no way to stand a chance unless they were all unified against Fury. “What if—” he cut himself off, hesitating for a moment longer. He took a deep breath before continuing. Everyone in the group was staring at him, confused looks on their faces as he whispered the question that no one had ever asked before. “He can’t banish everyone from Olympus. What if we all stood up to him?”
“No dad?” Tony asked, nonchalantly, but the gears in his brain were turning quickly, clicking all of the information into place.
Steve made it to in Athens without any difficulties, but what he saw on his journey left a sinking feeling in his chest. His once beloved city had been almost completely destroyed, some buildings still smoking with the damage the Spartans had done. He wandered aimlessly until he came across his own temple, and his chest heaved with loss. The temple had been demolished almost beyond repair, the fire pits that stood on each side of what was left of his statue were the only things left. They were the only things that survived because they were the only things that weren’t made of stone; they had been constructed of bronze to reflect light up onto the statue of the god of love when they were lit. Steve felt tears form in his eyes, but he didn’t let them fall. He shook his head to himself and made to leave the city, and it looked like he wasn’t the only one. What few Athenians were left were gathering up their belongings, heading out of the city with wooden carts piled high, pulled by mules.
Before he had a chance to come up with some sort of explanation, his phone buzzed again. This time with a picture message.
most powerful of all of us. I know you don’t like him, but there’s no way to fight him and win, Steve. It can’t be done. If there was a way, we would have tried it.”
Tony tested the joints in the suit, walking carefully from his work table the large bed across the room where he slept. His bots whirred to life at the sound of the machinery working, circling his feet anxiously. Tony couldn’t help the smile behind the new mask, looking down at his creations through a computerized lens. He stretched his arms and rolled his shoulders, the suit following his every move with ease. Tony could have burst with the pride that filled his chest, and his small smile turned into to full-fledged girn. He’d done it; he’d perfected the suit. Now all that was left to do was fly it.
Thor glanced at her, his easy going nature dissipating with the conversation. “Fury has a way of. . . making sure that we all do as he says,” he said, a darkness in his tone. Steve was sure there was more to that story, but he didn’t push the subject.
“No,” Steve retorted, and there was no room for debate in his answer. He would not give on this; he could at least do that for Tony. Rhodey sat stiffly to the left of Fury, and though his head was bowed, his eyes searched out Steve. He offered him a sly smile in support. Steve uncrossed his arms from his chest, aware that he looked defensive, and spoke again. “You tossed him in that volcano, forbade everyone from seeing him, and forbade him from ever leaving. Where would he find the supplies to build something? He’s got his automaton that he left Olympus with--that’s it. He’s
“Your boy is up on Olympus talking to the other gods. About rebellion.” Rhodey cocked an eyebrow in Tony’s direction, and Tony shrugged helplessly. He hadn’t said anything to Steve about rebellion. Hell, his main goal for Mark III was protection, not
them. That was the god of love’s power, so to speak; everyone would do everything in their power to please him, even complete strangers. Steve could end wars that way if he chose to, but Tony didn’t imagine that the man he’d met earlier was fond of his gift. Steve didn’t seem like the type that enjoyed forcing people into things, and that’s essentially what his gift was—coercion.
Tony is greeted in Pyra by an unwelcome surprise, and he has to play the hero--something that comes far easier to him than he ever expected.
Tony knew this, and he may not care what Fury had to say, but he never disobeyed for the sake of his only friend. He could never forgive himself if something happened to Rhodey because of his reckless aversion to authority. “Did he say when?” Tony asked, and Rhodey knew then that Tony would respect Fury’s demand. Even if only to protect him.
a father. Never knew him though.” Tony glanced up at him, his eyebrow raised both in concentration and in affirmation that he was paying attention.
Without hesitation, Steve headed straight for the throne room. He knew that Rhodey had flown ahead of him, and that Fury was awaiting his arrival. He walked down the pathway with steady, sure feet. He would go into the grandroom to meet Fury, and he wouldn’t tell him anything about Tony’s haven that he’d built in the bottom of Pyra. Steve couldn’t explain the urge that he felt to protect Tony, but it was an urge that was stronger than he’d imagined. He could protect Tony this way, by keeping his secrets of the volcano.
“Dum-E...” Steve muttered under his breath. Tony had told him as much already—Fury had seen what he could do. And he didn’t like it.
. The panic tightening its grip on his stomach was something that Tony was familiar with, and he struggled to keep his breathing steady.
“So, what does the Big Guy have to say that’s so important?” Tony asked rolling his eyes, his words dripping with apathy. He really didn’t care what Fury had to say to him, and he could guess that this fact had something to do with his expulsion from Olympus.
Steve gave him a firm nod, his eyes shut tightly as he tried to control his breathing. He turned to Thor and Natasha, who had been watching Fury, but turned at the sound of the hurried conversation behind them. Nat watched them with dejected eyes, and Steve was sure that Fury’s leadership was not something that she approved of. Thor didn’t look surprised either, but his jaw was set in a hard line as he turned back to them. Steve met their gazes with a daunting look, and he regained his composure, suddenly more sure of himself. “You still think we shouldn’t do anything?”
Tony watched Peter carefully as he spoke, listening closely for any sign of shallow breathing or panicked words. He hadn’t meant for Peter to talk about this—to remember this—but sometimes it did help, and if he needed him to, Tony would listen.
At the edge of the cave’s opening, Tony stood for a moment, seeing the city below him and the mountain on the other side of it. He glanced at the skies, wary of any weather change that could take place as quickly as Fury could change moods. For now, there wasn’t a cloud in sight, and Tony didn’t hesitate any longer before throwing his body from the ledge.
Rhodey glared at his friend, not amused by Tony’s indifference. “He said ‘We’re welcoming a new god to Olympus. You’re not invited.’” Rhodey hated seeing Tony living on the outskirt of society, separate from the only people who could understand him. He detested coming to Pyra with hateful messages from Fury, but Fury knew all. If Rhodey so much as though about delivering anything other than Fury’s exact words, nothing but suffering would await him on the Mountain.
She shook her head slowly. “Fury threw Tony out centuries ago because he saw Tony as a threat. We all liked Tony. He built things constantly, and a lot of his creations are still here on Olympus—Rhodey’s shoes, Clint’s bow and arrows,
Rather than moving to put the suit on, he tinkered with some of the metal in front of him mindlessly. His thoughts were far away, up on Olympus with Steve and Rhodey. It was dark out, the sun had long since gone down, but Tony could hear the thunder rolling outside of the volcano. He was far too familiar with that sound; it meant that Fury was angry. A storm was guaranteed to brew when Fury was angry. Tony only hoped that Steve and Rhodey were looking out for each other at the top of the mountain.
“Back to Olympus . . .” Tony trailed off, and in an instant, the only thing that mattered to him was being around actual
“I’m observant,” she repeated, and Steve grew frustrated with her. She put a hand up to stop any sort of retort from him, companied with a warning glance, and he watched her, waiting for an explanation. “Nothing that I know about Tony from his time on the Mountain has ever lined up with what everyone was saying about him. That he’s a threat, that he wants to bring about the
“Thank you, Jarvis,” Tony cut him off, sending a glare upward. He didn’t need a reminder of that night thank you very much. He stood slowly from his workbench and stumbled to the stairs, the scotch taking its effect. He hadn’t meant to drink as much as he did, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. He was going to win his Pepper back, and he had his liquid courage to thank for that. He made his way up the stairs as quickly as he could in his inebriated state, using the wall as both a balance and leverage to pull himself upwards.
