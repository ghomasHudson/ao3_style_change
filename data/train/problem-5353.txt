He had a good heart, against what Steve's prior judgy self or magic-stick-affected self had said. Also Tony was strikingly good-looking, attractive moreso.
Tony's fingers were busy adjusting Steve's medals but Tony could barely string a thought together being held this close, this good. All he wanted to do was hang onto Steve and wish he would whisk Tony away.
His only grief would be leaving his little family of his best friends and robots and his AI. But he wouldn't feel it if he was fighting for his last breaths of air, would he?
"Preposterous? I know. I'm still the stuttering idiot in love around you.", Steve had sarcastically said, which didn't feel a whole lot sarcastic. Tony's hand slipped in Steve's, being led to where people were slow dancing in their own worlds.
For once he wanted to cower behind Pepper as Bucky took long strides ending up right in front of him. A flash of metal struck out and he was suddenly completely encompassed in a familiar warm hug.
The feeling of the cold metal on his ring finger was probably what kick-started his brain again. He flung himself on Steve, being caught mid-air as he laughed, "You had to take help from DUM-E?"
He heard when Tony offered a car to drop them back to SHIELD, but he stayed quiet letting others take the decision. Turning towards both the agents, he fully expected them to decline but instead got tired nods.
"Will you draw me a daisy?", Steve's lips quirked up in amusement at Tony's question but he didn't open his eyes. He just hummed again.
Bucky's voice softened and Tony could somehow imagine how soft his face might have gone, "Credit? If you make it out alive, sure. Just come back home tonight soon. Pepper will be here but Rhodey is stuck with his asshole superiors and Happy has to go check on someone later. I'll make sure my girlfriend doesn't stab you with her stilettos."
Steve Rogers is the sweetest human ever. And if I couldn't resist writing a fuck ton of fluff and angst over him, I'm only human.
Tony surely took his time mulling over everything. He took a deep breath again feeling the car stop, "He won't." Pepper looked at him in hope. "Bucky's here for good. I am still betting that he'll fall down, if not faint, when you tell him. Which I'm hoping is today because I don't think I can keep my mouth shut for long. And we also need to find a way to not give the Captain aneurysms, he seems kinda nice"
Some things are seared in my brain and I need to sit back and analyse it. Calculate the extent of damage that has happened and preparation I need to do to not let this happen again. I can't now, though.", Tony felt as if his heart had shriveled over those shrapnels.
"Yeah. That's exactly what you should talk about when old curious ears are trying to listen in.", Steve bit back, turning Tony amidst sway and muttering a soft '
Also, maybe I just take too much fun in making him and Tony fall for each other and then pine beyond belief.
He turned and glared at the agents dismissively, "So you need to start devising your witchy masterplan about how you're gonna get them here without suspicions, scary lady. Pirate-boss should not know, I need confirmation he's good. I am not gonna let Bruce get away at all though. So do something to get them all out."
Rose-coloured being pink is a colour that shows easy happiness. It's like seeing life through a happy filter where everything feels good, the people you love feel wonderful.
Tony just shrugged innocently and kept prodding at Steve, making noises of curiosity until Steve gave in.
"Punishing me, huh?", Tony grinned back at them still teasing, hoping he had not overpressured them into doing this. He can be impulsive, at times.
drawing you made me.", Tony whispered with a grin because he knew Steve wouldn't question that, instead flushing red like he was now.
of Thor taking Loki and the sceptre and the tesseract back to Asgard, they all finally escaped to the Shawarma joint.
Tony gave up, resting his head back on Steve's chest letting the river of thoughts finally flood his brain at once. He ran his fingers over Steve's nape as he delicately looked at Steve, "Steve?"
"I'm hoping those shoes aren't your favourite.", Steve winced as he looked at them and his gaze flitted back soon to Tony's amused face, fixing on the warm brown eyes.
Tony could feel the knot in his throat, "We have worked our asses off collecting everything we will need to prove his innocence. Moreover his recent trek of destroying some of their bases alongside the same law swings in his favour. You know the judge, who me and Rhodey were pestering, she said he's safe as long as all the cards are played well. And play them good, we will."
They are superheroes, they won't ever reach a point where everything will be stable. But they can reach a point where they are better versions of themselves because they want to be, not because they have to be there for someone.  That's when they will know how to click together in place beside each other.
He was graced with one of Steve's daisy smiles as a warm hand wiped the corners of Tony's eyes, the ring box eased out of his fingers.
She looked up at him with a wet laugh which sounded more miserable, "How many times? Do you even have the slightest idea how scared I was? Just watching the news of aliens on the top of our building I panicked so hard that JARVIS had to call James and god, if it wasn't for him. I just wish that that man didn't watch you fly that nuke into that hellhole himself because I did and I'm going to get a fuck-ton of nightmares over this."
Tony felt like he was on drugs. Or maybe just adrenaline. Or 'back-from-the-dead-but-not-really' thrill. Whomsoever was responsible for naming it but he felt high.
Nodding off, Natasha was the first to walk out perfectly like she hadn't just fought off an alien army with Clint in tandem who seemed like he could draw an arrow the next second but still was blank faced in exhaustion. They both stopped midway looking at Steve in expectancy.
"Stop disturbing me. I've been trying to channel my inner Tony Stark all night.", Steve took a deep breath, trying to suppress his grin into a mocking smirk and failing very successfully.
“Fine, he’s more of an acquaintance you can say, but if you can complete this job for him,” Hammer pauses dramatically and Natasha resists the urge to hang up on him, “we’re going to become the best of friends.”
He weaves through the crowd and slips into the first tent he finds. He sees various costume pieces scattered throughout the small space and grabs the most inconspicuous coat he can find – it ends up being a dark purple long coat, but he thinks he can make it work.
“Oh. Thanks.” Sam manages a weak smile at the waitress and hands her a twenty. “Please thank the lady for me too.”
Tony leaned forward and gave him a chaste kiss. “Mmm, that sounds great, but I’ll probably be stuck at SI most of the day. How about we make that dinner instead?”
“Just the check, thank you.” Steve tells her and watches as she walks away. She turns back to look at him and smirks when she sees him staring. “What just happened?”
“We always miss all the action.” Clint groaned from where he and Tasha were looking over the Intel they had received on a Dr. Samuel Beckett.
He shows team the picture of Clint and his rap sheet, sharing various locations where he is likely heading.
Steve came with a harsh moan on Tony’s hand and their chests while the smaller man continued pounding into him.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., any word from Pepper yet about the SI servers?” Tony asks, pulling the last of his father’s crates out from storage.
Steve went up to his room after their little breakfast meeting. He needed a little time alone to process everything that had happened since last night. His feelings for Tony were a surprise to him, yet Thor seemed to know about them. He couldn’t help but wonder exactly how oblivious he had actually been about his own feelings all this time. Was his secret even a secret anymore? What if the whole team already knew?  Or worse, what if Tony –
“Enough!” Odin seems angry now. All the amusement gone from his voice and his body is tense, as if ready to strike at a moment’s notice. “Now, here is what is going to happen. I am going to pretend that you are simply tired. I will choose to believe my son, the heir to all of Asgard and the nine realms, is not losing his mind.
A scream brings her out of her musings and she turns around to see people running. They found her mark.
“Looks like we got a job, boys.” The burley one with the crowbar announced as he entered the warehouse.
They had been dancing around each other since the night Tony taught Steve how to dance, that was almost two months ago. For even longer than that, if he was being honest with himself.
Judging by the look on Tony’s face, the gesture hadn’t gone unnoticed and the man gave him another one of those smiles that Steve loved so much. “Great, we’ll meet you out front in 15.”
“Right. Regardless, Barton needs to be brought in.” Coulson lifts an eyebrow at May, she backs down. Though he can tell they will have words later. “Any more questions?”
“Amazing? Incredible? Fantastic?” Tony finished for Steve, looking up from where he was spread over him and grinning at the super soldier.
Tony groaned when he pushed the fabric down enough to release his erection and gave Steve a pointed look. “Like what you see soldier?”
Tony was relieved that neither Pepper nor Rhodey had said anything in front of Obie – distrusting the man whom he had once thought of as a father figure.
“Thank you, Jarvis.” Pepper answered before Tony had a chance to argue then turned her attention to Tony. “Share holders meeting, now.” She glared as Tony called Jarvis a traitor and ended the call.
Bruce sighed and started the quinjet, as his team went to suit up, preparing for takeoff. Looks like his quiet morning was going to end with a bang.
“Thanks Cap.” Tony smiled then spoke to Clint. “If you must know, ever since the New Years incident, we are not allowed to do much of anything without both Fury and Pepper knowing about it.”
Natasha looked at the archer and he gave her a reluctant shrug. “’Bout a nine, but what else is new.” Clint was quiet for a few seconds then sighed loudly and sat on the floor with a conflicted look on his face. He took a deep breath before looking up at her from his place on the floor. “Tasha, what happens if it’s a time machine? I mean like one that actually works.” He asked in a low voice.
“You know, you make it really hard for me to love you sometimes.” Pepper hangs up before Tony finishes his sentence. He really should be more offended that his personal assistant keeps cutting him and hanging up on him. “J.A.R.V.I.S. remind me to change Pepper’s ringtone on my phone,” he laughs, “and to buy her something really nice for her birthday.”
Tony got up, putting on a pair of sweatpants before making his way to the kitchen. He may not know what was going on but Pepper would, she always did.
“Tony.” Steve groaned and pulled the man into another kiss as the other man returned to working them to completion, taking their throbbing erections into his hand once more. Steve came with a shout first, vision whiting out until he felt Tony slump against him.
Steve whimpered as Tony pulled away. He wanted the man naked but he couldn’t help but feel disappointed at the loss of contact. It was irrational, he knew, but Steve wanted nothing more than for the man to keep kissing him, touching him, anything. Tony stood at the foot of the bed and began to remove his shorts slowly, making a show of it. Steve glared at him from his position on the bed, wanting the man to get naked faster.
“Yeah, I’m with hard-head over here. Besides I thought the fact that Thor is still on earth was a mighty good reason not to mess with the Avengers.” This time the one without a weapon spoke up.
“Here’s your check.” The waitress says, handing Steve the bill and staring at where Steve and Peggy are holding hands. She blushes. “You can pay at the front. Take your time.”
Natasha sent off the text before she made the conscious decision to do so. She normally only sent her employers two texts one before and another after the job was completed but something told her she wasn’t going to be completing this job.
“You’re ridiculous you know that?” Steve uttered when their lips parted, “Besides, I’d much rather wake up next to a gorgeous, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist any day.”
Tony sat up suddenly. He had been on the field with- He couldn’t remember. He was in bed, in Malibu-
“Don’t you dare.” Pepper warned Tony as he took out his phone and asked Jarvis for a status report. Internally celebrating the fact that he would miss the share holders meeting, by the look on Pepper’s face, she was not happy about it.
A knock on the door brought him out of his thoughts and made Steve freeze for a moment, reminding him of the previous knock on his door.
And that is nothing compared to the utter and immediate fear he feels when he gets angry. By all accounts, it makes no sense.
“Shall we get going then or are you boys going to start again?” She inquired and Bruce visibly stirred at the threat in her words.
All three men looked at Steve as if waiting for his approval and he caved. “Fine, but just one glass.”
“Right.” Natasha answers as she forces herself to walk toward the parking lot. “I’d get to the point if I were you. Since I am about 10 seconds away from hanging up on you.”
Natasha drove off, throwing the disposable phone out the window. This wasn’t what she signed on for. She knew it didn’t make sense. She wasn’t proud of it, but she had killed children before, whole families even. This wouldn’t be anything new but she just couldn’t do it.
Steve blushed furiously while Tony just chuckled and squeezed his shoulder before letting go. “He’s just jealous that all he gets is Jarvis and I get you.”
Clint grunted something Steve chose to interpret as a greeting, while Natasha and Thor acknowledged his presence with a nod.
The look of sincerity in Tony’s eyes made something in Steve’s chest soften. The simple fact that he wasn’t pushing him into anything was more than he had ever asked of his team mate.
He grabbed the phone lying in a corner and stuffed it in his pocket just as he heard Nat speaking again, "Coulson's gone. We'll have to do it alone. Clint's not safe there. If you're gonna snatch Cap, then snatch Clint too. And Dr. Banner. I'll play along."
He closed his eyes and he let himself drift off. It felt like as if a second later he was choking on air,
"Save the rest for the turn, J.", Tony commanded, his mind gushing with various possibilities which frustratingly gave one outcome.
A part of him knew this memory will be ingrained in his mind, drawn and painted over a hundred times till it becomes muscle memory because that's the only way he knew how to cope with this.
So yes, when I say that when I wrote this chapter, I fully intended for them to be this angry at Mr. Eyepatch or even despise him. It's not wrong because they're still recovering and it's been half a year. A war is not something one recovers from easily. I am trying my level best to keep that angst to a minimum.
"I'm not called Hawkeye for nothing. Just things around your living room. And connecting dots.", Clint replied smugly. Tony pushed past him muttering
"And then shawarma after.", came Tony's voice. And if his smile slipped back on his face again, no one had to know.
"Thank you.", Tasha said, handing him a sweet drink as she took the whiskey away from his line of vision. She was scarily intuitive but Tony was grateful for that.
that seemed too familiar to the time they were waterboarding him but this time it was in space, looking at the wormhole close below him and falling into an infinite something. And no one would ever find him ever again. It would be fitting.
"Okay, shut up. I'm trying to act cool, gathering courage and all. And I'm saying that out loud. I should stop staying around you two and ditch you both for Nat."
He just felt a bit stupid that he ever doubted Steve wouldn't want to take him to dancing wearing fancy clothes under the gazes of the people who had seen him fight the world war themselves.
Tony wanted to snort and poke fun at Bucky but he knew better than to interrupt their moment. He just happens to be the third wheel, every fucking time, including the time his best friend tells her man, who is his other best friend, about them making
Also yes, Steve and Tony know they like each other and yet they won't take a step now because it isn't their right time yet.
The pang of pain spread through him again seeing Stark's still face. He looked up seeing Hulk back away and flinched as Hulk roared deafeningly loud. A sound made his head snap back towards the man lying down to see him looking around frantically saying
"You are not allowed to joke about this so soon. In fact, you are not allowed to joke about it ever."
But this was it, he thought. Not content, like the time Jarvis and Ana smiled at him like he was the best thing ever or breathing his Mama's perfume, that he had loved all his life, that night before he was going to lose her or the cocoon of love and warmth Pepper and Bucky radiate or the ever-assuring presence of Rhodey all his life or the jovial pride he felt midst his creations, his children.
Also, I am not stupid enough to think that a powerful woman like Pepper will mind her own business when the world rushes to chaos. Especially when it's her family at stake. She's a mama bear.
"Which one is the good part? Me not being pregnant?", Tony nudged her as she smacked his hand away. He could sense that something was nagging her. "Okay. What are you worrying over? Bucky's gonna die in happiness."
There was this faded undercurrent of a memory of Steve finally getting his dance, holding Aunt Peggy in his arms in that old age home as both of them swayed slowly with wet eyes. Tony's fingers tapping a rhythm to Harry James' voice singing
Tony laughed along in disbelief and agreement that they were definitely hyphenating their last names as Steve carried him out of the workshop.
With a nod, they both walked out casually as Steve slipped the phone in one of the subtle pockets in his suit, patting it in assurance. The slight eye contact between Natasha and Tony didn't go unnoticed by Steve and, as it seemed, Barton.
This is one big mess of fluff from all ends. Seriously though. I needed a 'Steve getting to a point where he tests life through texting' and 'Bucky being all melted cheese over Pepper' so I wrote it.
He raised his heavy head, ignoring everything that happened to glare at Pepper, "You can't wear those pajamas when you aren't on periods. It's cheating. You literally can't wear them for a long long time."
Tony turned back just in time to catch the Captain's eyes. Another worry of how he was going to explain this insanity of a new world and Bucky being alive and everything to the Captain coursed through him. That was for him to worry on another day.
Tony's face broke out in a smile again at the claim. Well, his super-soldier wasn't wrong. But still Tony being Tony rather replied suggestively, "Your ass is mighty fine."
I needed him to understand that it was a priority, especially when he knows how mental health of family affects a child. He was a prime victim of that diabolical behaviour. Except Jarvis and Ana, they were the gems.
Tony felt his eyes burn as he chimed back, "Pepper just might. That was the second time she thought I was dying on her. I need to go though. Love you, Barnes." He felt this overwhelming need to gather everyone he loved in a pile and sleep on them like a dragon on its hoard.
"When you're finished, you'll come back to the tower where I'll pummel some sense into you. Got it?" Bucky's deadly monotonic voice filled his ear.
A weird chuckle left his throat as he threw a pillow on Bucky and gathered all his energy to whine at both of them so they would bring the food over to him rather than Pepper dragging them both to the dining table. Well, that was exactly what he was gonna do
He nodded towards Romanoff, taking off towards the minibar after seeing her following him. "The Captain's not safe there.", Tasha muttered under her breath.
"So? Will you marry me?", Steve sauntered towards him, his grin proof enough that he already knew the answer. Instead of trying a word more, Tony just nodded as he let those tears leak out.
"We're not finished yet.", Thor said. They all turned to look at him. Steve felt tired. His bones ached. All he wanted to do was get out of here. Or get onto that shawarma offer. But he knew they had to finish this.
Steve could see Natasha gesture something to Tony out of the corner of his eye before she walked away but Tony held on, tightening his fingers and loosening them rhythmically.
Bucky interrupted Tony, standing up and glancing at Pepper, "Okay. That's it, I'm done. If you do not start spilling whatever it's bothering you since you stepped in here, I'm gonna leave you both here, take away all the leftovers, switch on a disgusting reality TV show on the highest volume and ignore you both all night."
Tony waited for her to scold him, scream at him, anything. That was what he was expecting after the unnaturally silent phone call asking him to pick her up.
He shrugged at Steve, his heart-eyes probably evident as Steve bent him backwards kissing him until Tony's eyes shut close, his body went lax and his toes curled.
If Tony had JARVIS already record all of this, sending it to Natashalie and Rhodey-bear in the morning and saving it up for
A fresh wave of pain rippled through him as he realised he lost one of his own again. Yes, they met and they clashed and he said some things that he'd never say, misjudging this complex man but still, he was one of Steve's. His team.
His feet slowly took him to the painting, his hands outstretched craving to touch it when he saw the ring. Nestled in the open box, it glinted off the holographic blue as Tony slowly picked it up. His mind clicking the pieces together as his eyes felt wet and his heart heavy with love.
His eyes ran over all of Tony's face and he felt a tug inside him as he responded with an equally soft
I know he is always shown as this focused, strong leader, so the fact that he is a big old softie gets overshadowed. His grief was shown, in suppressed ways, but his fascination was not. That's probably why I wanted to write this.
Bucky pulled away, holding Tony at arm's length scanning him all over when suddenly Bucky got an armful of Pepper apologising for interrupting but folding herself in his body with her face tucked in the curve of his neck. And that was all Tony saw before he stepped back letting them have comfort in each other's presence.
She sighed, "I'll look into it. Keep the channel open. I'll talk to you later. Also I call dibs on Godmother. And tell JARVIS that I need a reaction video of Pepper telling Barnes about it.", a genuine smile popped on Natashalie's face for a fraction of a second. With that she took off towards Barton who was cautiously eyeing them.
on the roof. Then he exploded. Oh my god, that man and his stories! I love them both so much. I was so goddamn relieved though."
The stars twinkled and the thought of how he was just a man in a tin can unaware of the danger looming over them in this large universe, in which they were apparently not alone as he believed just hours ago, pierced through him.
"Okay. Stay safe.", Tony whispered as the once sharp brown eyes turned into soft brown doe eyes right in front of Steve sending a shiver through him.
This would've been a good way to die but it didn't feel that way. Ignoring the throbbing in every fibre of his body, he let loose and closed his eyes, giving up.
His head felt filled with blurry memories of the stars and the heat of the blast that he knew he had imagined because there was no way he felt it. He felt shivers wrack through his body as he made his way to the couch on shaky legs to sit down before he crashed.
“Most likely. It’s too big of a coincidence for it to be anything else.” Natasha answered taking out photographs from their surveillance and pushing them toward Steve. “This man was also present in DC which leads us to believe that there is something bigger at play.”
Coulson picks a team of four agents to help him follow Clint. Three are new recruits but he has known Agent May for a couple of years and he knows her reputation. If you need a job done, she is who you go to.
Natasha doesn’t think she has ever truly relaxed before, taken time for herself, she isn’t even sure it’s possible. She thinks it would be nice to finally do it, go to the mountains and commune with nature, maybe go over to Europe and get lost among tourist, disappear in the crowds and be invisible for more than just necessity. Maybe she can go to the beach, stick her toes in the sand and enjoy the calm waters.
“It’s a secret recipe.” Clint grinned, which normally wouldn’t be worrisome except for the fact that they all knew how much Clint loved to pull practical jokes.
Tony, however, seemed to take Steve’s frown as a rejection. “Sorry, I don’t mean to be pushy, if you don’t want to do this, you don’t have to. We’ll blow the event off and do something else. If you’re not ready, you’re not ready. Fury will have to understand.”
Bruce chuckled and went back to making breakfast while Pepper filled up two mugs of coffee, one for herself, the other for Tony no doubt.
“Peggy.” Steve couldn’t help the smile that spread over his face as he looked at the woman he had once lost. He had never been so happy to see anyone-
“Tony.” Steve whimpered as the other man kissed down his neck and started nipping at his collarbone. “Please.”
Tony leaned up into the kiss and wrapped his arms around the blond, pulling him closer. He had waited a long time for this kiss, to have Steve in his arms and he wasn’t planning on letting go.
** Sometimes a bitch be petty, but reasonable. Other times, a bitch is slightly hungover and you really caught her at a bad time.
Steve was sitting next to Tony absently holding his hand as he and Bruce were looking over the schematics to Beckett’s machine, throwing theories around on what it could be, and Natasha’s heart ached at the sight. Would this be the last time they were happy together? Would Steve leave Tony, the Avengers, to go back to a simpler time?
Tony huffed and glared half-heartedly and won another chuckle from Steve. “Captain America being smug, what has this world come to?” Tony mumbled as he got out of bed.
“What if this guy is building an actual working time machine? Do you think- I don’t know, that maybe Cap will want to go back?” Clint asked looking more troubled than Natasha had seen him in a long time.
Sam’s days are… boring. He isn’t doing anything different at all but everything feels off. His morning runs seem tedious. His meals are too quiet, his workouts are easy, even his downtime is unfulfilling. He’s bored.
“Ok that’s it. I’m calling Obie and cancelling the meeting. You are clearly in no condition to be doing anything right now.” Pepper told him as she took out her phone.
“Well, now that we got the destination sorted out, we are going out to buy some things for the trip. Wanna come?” Tony asked with a strange expression on his face, somewhere between hopeful and anxious.
“Morning.” Clint and Natasha greeted from their seats at the kitchen island, where they were already having breakfast. Bruce turned to greet her as she strode over to the coffee machine as she usually did every morning. “Good morning. Would you care for some pancakes,
“Come on, let’s go for a walk.” Tony said, getting up from his seat and slightly stumbling toward the door.
“Tony?” He looked up to see her approaching him with a worried look on her face. “Are you alright? You’re looking a little pale, come sit down.” She pulled him over to the kitchen table and placed her hand on his forehead. “Tony, what’s wrong?”
Thor chuckles and shakes his head. “Last time we won the good couch, Tony practically locked us out of the Tower for a good three days.”
Steve groans as Tony moves to sit next to him. Tony reaches for his hand and pries it open, pulling the shards of broken cup from his hands.
Bruce squeezed Clint’s shoulder. “Would you rather have Cap bench you?” Bruce asked from Clint’s side, causing the other man to grunt and shrug Bruce’s hand off his shoulder.
“Listen up!” Clint yells out and instantly the eyes of the entire group are on him again. “Yes, there are clearly two very hot people sparring not 20 feet away from you. However, none of you will move on to your next level of training until ALL of you complete the course.”
Natasha had arrived in Denver before her previous mark – some well-known business man - had even been reported as missing. She usually liked to take time off between jobs, traveling the world or keeping close tabs on those that may be a threat, but her current employer was adamant that she get rid of his competition before some expo at the end of the month.
“Did you start early in anticipation for this? You are kind of making me nervous.” Bruce informs her but accepts the champagne flute and the punch his words earned him.
have landed on their ass. It’s not my fault if they didn’t move out of the way in time. If they had been paying attention they would have seen it coming.” Clint defended himself, sounding more than a little pleased.
“Yeah.” Steve nods, and Sam resists the urge to point out the light blush coloring his face. Steve laughs and reaching for small package hidden inside his pocket. “Natasha was a god send during the process.”
“I beg your pardon, sir, but how does a super soldier lose control of their limbs?” Jarvis is standing between the two men. This is the man that raised Tony. I can see how he turned out so brave.
“Fine, but you’re also coming in tomorrow, by the way.” Pepper says and Tony can almost see the pout she is almost certainly sporting from her tone alone. “I cannot- no, actually, I refuse to deal with the damn board of directors again. They are so obnoxious and entitled and, I can’t believe I am about to say this, but you were right, they suck!”
“Us? Nope. This is on you.” The first voice responds candidly and Clint breathes a sigh of relief. These must be new agents. “Were you really that stupid to walk right into his line of sight?”
She is always nagging him to come out of his workshop to take care of SI business - read: paperwork. Or she’s monitoring his eating habits – read: limiting Tony’s coffee intake. She also makes him wake him up at ungodly hours just to attend board of directors’ meetings - even though he was the majority shareholder and what he says goes. Hell, once she kicked everyone out of his house during one of his parties because he was too drunk. Seriously, she kicked all his guests out. She is always there to “take care” of him and making sure “he doesn’t kill himself” – yes, those are direct quotes. It’s annoying and unnecessary, Tony is a grown up. He can take care of himself.
Clint shakes his arm out, feeling a small prickle of electricity where he collided with that red- Oh hell. Clint ran toward the closest train, he knew that red head looked familiar. She was fucking a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. He needed to get the fuck out of dodge.
“What? NO, no no no. You said it yourself, we are on vacation. You need to loosen up and drink with the rest of us!”
Sif smiled back and invited him to spar, which he accepted. Surely it was what his body needed to stop his mind from wondering.
Listening to the radio in bed, taking a stroll in the park, drawing the landscape, catching the latest feature picture. It amazes Steve that he is able to do all that again and much more now that he is back. There is the bigger stuff too, he supposes, he can buy a house, get a job, properly court Peggy, settle down, even have kids.
“Hey, Cap.” Tony answered without looking at the man. “What are you doing out here? I thought you’d be dancing with that- blonde.”
“Well yes,” Bruce admitted, “but it’s my job to help you with any questions you may have. Please continue and I will help you in any way I can.”
“Anything. Everything. I just -” Steve tried to swallow back the words that threatened to come out and pulled Tony down for a kiss. “You. I just want you.” He finally confessed when they parted for air.
To be honest, Natasha wasn’t sure. She knew – they all knew – that Steve was happy, being with Tony had certainly helped but she also knew how miserable this time had made him when he first woke up. Maybe he had just accepted his fate. Accepting the fact that he was here was not the same thing as wanting to be here. An opportunity to go back to his time was probably too big of a temptation to pass.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to- I just- I don’t know what happened.” The two men freeze at Steve’s declaration.
“No, thank you. Just the check, please.” Sam is sitting in a corner booth at a small café. His eyes keep straying to the door, half expecting someone to walk in looking for him. He feels his heart start racing every time the little bell above the bell rings. Every time he looks up, he is filled with disappointment.
“Why do I feel like coming here is going to come back and bite us in the ass?” Natasha asked Tony with a raised eyebrow and an easy smile.
Tony cleared his throat as soon as the other three were gone. “They really don’t look bad Steve.” He gave Steve an encouraging smile. “Trust me. I have excellent taste.” He added with a wink.
Somehow the Wrecking Crew managed to rig a bomb to explode when the authorities made their way into the bank to rescue hostages which resulted in Bruce accidentally hulking out. From then on, it all went downhill. Cap made a tactical decision that civilian lives were more important than capturing the Crew so he and Thor focused their efforts on de-hulking Bruce and saving those caught in the explosion rather than going after the Wrecking Crew.
“But you’ll have to do it in the next 30 seconds because Coulson is on his way up.” Natasha supplied from where she was leaning on the counter. “
“So, what group activity do you have planned for us tomorrow?” Tony asked, startling Steve out of his thoughts. His eyes were still closed when he started talking – which Steve was thankful for – but they promptly opened when Steve didn’t answer. “Cap?”
“Correct, Ms Potts. Captain Rogers has not requested Iron Man’s presence but has instructed that he have the suit on standby.”
“What else could they be then son? Do you really expect me to believe that the Gods have granted you the power of knowledge and comradery with unknown aliens?”
There is an itch under her skin that Natasha just can’t shake and it has nothing to do with the weather in Phoenix.
Tony lingered at the doorway for a few seconds, looking at Steve curiously, before he turned to walk down the hall.
“This, my dear Captain, is Asgardian mead. The drink of warriors!” Thor told Steve, grinning wildly.
Bruce remembered life with Betty. She was smart, strong, and beautiful. She was everything Bruce wanted and of course she had his heart. He could still remember the last time he held her hand, looked into her eyes, and the last breath she took.
“It’s okay baby, I got you.” Tony murmured as Steve rode out his orgasm, kissing along his jaw. “You are incredible, so gorgeous.”
A carnival was a little too on the nose for Clint- No, Barton. I have to stop doing that. Then again, hiding in plain sight was almost always the best course of action, every agent worth a lick knew that.
Tony felt a wave of relief hit him. He wasn’t sure why but he was sure that it had something to do with Obie and the weapons contract. Nothing made sense. He’s known Obie all his life, he was always happy to see him yet he found himself dreading the idea of being face to face with the man. He also knew Stark Industries was in the weapons business, but something told him it wasn’t right. He just wished he could remember what it was.
“Yes, Rhodey, I am and that is why I’m doing what I’m doing. That’s why I won’t be signing the contract with the US military.”
Steve grinned and followed Tony. They still had a couple more days here in paradise and Steve wasn’t going to waste them anymore. They were together and that was all that mattered. They had each other and that was all they needed.
“Tony.” Steve whined and wrapped his legs around Tony’s waist when he felt the man begin to pull out. “Don’t. Please don’t stop, it feels amazing.”
Betty is too busy laughing to seem to care about the words coming out of Bruce’s mouth. He can’t stay mad at her.
“Fuck. This is nice.” Sam finally comments when he unwraps the thing. “Like really nice. I can’t believe you’re-”
“Fine, I can take a hint. I’ll see you Monday, Tony.” Obie gave him on last smirk and walked out the door.
“Steven, if it is your wish, we shall forget about it.” Thor spoke in a soft tone. “But do not let the fear of breaking up the team stop you from going after that which your heart desires.”
That on the other hand interested her. She turned toward him and raised her brow as she strode over to sit on his lap.
Bruce, who was a great deal sober than the rest, repeated the sentiment and waved goodnight, rushing over to help Natasha put Clint to bed.
“I- sorry, no, I didn’t mean.” Steve blew out a breath. “I didn’t mean, I lost control. Although, yes that is kind of what happened. I meant that- I zoned out for a minute.”
“You are all a bunch of children.” Tony’s voice emanates from the media room, followed by Steve’s laughter.
Tony released a ragged breath and pulled Steve into a soft kiss before he nuzzled into Steve’s neck. Drifting off to sleep holding each other. There were still a lot of things they needed to talk about but for the time being everything was alright, Tony loved him and he loved Tony. Nothing else mattered.
Clint squeezed her arm and she looked up to see the man frowning at her in concern. She unclenched the fists she was unaware she had made and relaxed, nodding at the man that she was alright. Clint released her arm and she gave him a small smile before going over to sit next to Steve.
Bruce shook his head and took a deep breath, suppressing a shudder at the thought of hulking out with so many of his friends in close quarters. It has been a while since the last time he accidentally hulked out and he would hate to break that streak let alone hurt his friends in the process, again.
“Fuck. Coulson is going to murder us.” A male voice answers, by the sound of his accent the dude is Scottish.
“According to some of the texts, Black Widow wasn’t expecting the family to be home. Initially we assumed it spooked her somehow, maybe she got caught and ran. But everything was in place for the house to go up in smoke. She just didn’t do it.”
Tonight was different though. They had been at another charity function Pepper and Fury had forced them to attend, stealing small glances from across the room, when a curvy blonde approached the soldier and requested a dance. Tony knew he had no right to feel jealous, he and Steve were just friends but he couldn’t help the wave of possessiveness that went over him.
He had followed some kids into the parking lot, hoping to lose the agents on his trail when he found his ride. As soon as he had seen the two students stoking up on junk food he knew they would be his best bet to get out of town, and he didn’t waste any time charming his way into joining them. He was on the road before the agents probably realized they had lost him.
“I need to speak to you, father. In private.” Where Thor would normally share every thing with Loki, he can’t share this.
Steve looked up to see the curious stares of the rest of the team. Thor shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat, finally getting his attention. He resisted the urge to shy away.
“Someone woke up in a good mood.” Steve kissed the top of Tony’s head, holding on to him tightly, as if afraid that Tony would move away.
She is sitting in a stolen car, watching as the world moves around her, wondering when she will be done with all of this. She has added a few more kills to her list and it has done nothing to fill the void inside her.
Clint snickered while Bruce and Pepper laughed from their place in the kitchen, Pepper handing Tony his coffee before focusing her attention to her phone and berating Tony for being late.
Steve still felt incredibly guilty for that night - it hadn’t been one of his greatest moments - but he could live with it if it meant he could have Tony.
“Captain Rogers, I need you and all the available Avengers down at the Federal Reserve Bank at Liberty and Williams immediately. Coronel Rhodes, and Agents Barton and Romanoff are otherwise engaged so you will have to make do with whoever is on hand.”
“I – um – still you are a team member and we never should have –” Steve clears his throat, “I don’t want things to be weird with the team.”
under her breath. There was this momentary silence in which she tried to comfort him in her own way without words.
Yep, this officially ranges in the 6K words area and I'm posting this after an eon ie.barely 5 days. But boy, this chapter needed it.
Tony also suspected the event being focused on this particular cause because some certain redhead was eavesdropping when that happened. There were numerous people who had survived the war or their children and grandchildren surrounding him when the redhead dropped in beside him.
"Suave, Captain Rogers. That was a good one.", Tony stuttered out, finishing his drink in a go. He looked back at a relieved Steve, slowly standing up and offering a hand.
"Oh, you've seen the inner Tony Stark.", Tony smirked, turning his charms blindingly on as he flirted shamelessly with Steve.
"Nobody's asking you to.", Pepper whispered, letting her fingers trace weird circles on her pant-clad leg. "I'm so sentimental, these hormones. Well, it's not you who had to rush to a hospital in LA to find out you're pregnant? That's a good part in your life.", she sighed and slumped back in her place.
Tony, somehow that night, didn't have it in him to move his eyes away even for a second, reluctant of missing out on anything. His eyes had been trained on the Captain, decked in his military regalia, happily mixing with the people. Steve was comfortable here, more than he had ever been at the other galas.
She's just an old woman who lets her Mama plot with sarcastic genius billionaires to poke fun at herself, helps recovering assassins by pulling them to the kitchen, makes celestial cannolis and reminds Steve of his Ma. Just a wholesome angel here to make lives better.
Steve stared at him unabashed, "He insisted. I mean JARVIS, Pepper and Rhodey knew. Butterfingers and U did, too. But DUM-E wanted to help so bad."
He shook his head, strolling there in search of his chip. What he hadn't expected to find was a painting. A beautiful mess of colours with little stars and the black space, the little Iron Man post-it stuck on the table besides it.
It was as if waves of worry were coming off of her, "That I am sure of. I'm not letting him go for the rest of his goddamn life. I'm afraid he will. In fear. Or feeling that he should protect me and our kid. I don't want him to do that. The last thing I need is for James to disappear. Or not get to be a part of my life. Our life."
Steve had sat there looking at Tony stretching and curling up in the blankets, reluctant to go for today's run. Tony had kept looking at the love of his life, still wondering how he got to wake up to this.
I absolutely needed Pepper and Steve's friendship. The compatibility they have was something never mentioned in the movies. God, they could've been the bestest of friends, but still.. tHANks MaRveL, anyway.
"You think I'm any different?", Tony had mumbled under the next hitch of his breath as Steve pulled him closer, moving them in gentle sways and twirling Tony with mischievous glee.
The Chitauria falling around him in varying thuds felt like a background buzz. He heard Romanoff's soft
It was quickly followed by another burst, "Holy shit. I'm gonna be a dad. Shut up. What? No. What?" as he laughed crazily looking up at Pepper in wonder, his eyes manic and his hands hovering close over her in disbelief before he wrapped both of them around her, pulling her into his chest.
Tony broke away, whispering again as his eyes burnt, "Can you also draw me a cosmos?" Steve gave a shaky laugh as he pecked Tony's lip sweetly again, "I'll draw you anything you want, sweetheart. Forever."
Except if Pepper did tell Bucky tonight that she was pregnant with their child. And then another amusing worry of how he'll have one more competitor for the godfather part because he sure as hell wasn't giving it up to Rhodes. If Cap even handled it before having an aneurysm.
"I don't even know.", Tony shrugged. "I can't promise this won't happen again. After what I saw, I can't promise anything except I'll try to not give you anymore heart attacks. But we both know that's not true." He said just as Pepper scoffed with an
Pepper glared back at him knowing what was coming as Bucky let out a confused noise. "You had a nightmare on the couch, please don't make me punch you for opening your mouth at the wrong time.", Pepper threatened him.
He gave a small smile to Cap. But what surprised him was seeing Steve smile back. For a moment, he felt like he could handle that aneurysm and much more. And with that Steve Rogers turned back to help those shady agents as Tony walked back to see Barton and Natasha nursing some drinks.
Smacking him on the head and getting out of the car, she smoothed the creases on her pants and looked at Tony, "I'm gonna go take a shower. And you're gonna tell him all about what you're planning to do with your team of super-people. And then I'm gonna cling all over him right in your presence."
"I don't ever doubt the extents I'd go for Steve. Honestly? It's not like I can run from my dead father.", Tony reasoned with a small twitch of his lips as Natasha reflected back his hesitant smile.
It was scary how the sight of that tower just hours ago felt like one of the best things happening to him and now it was probably one of the last things Tony Stark saw.
He looked back at Stark to find him staring back at him. He could feel himself heating up but he pointedly ignored his possibly flushed skin. Because by then had begun the babbling.
The familiar soft noises of Bucky talking Pepper through her exhaustion and assuring her that she was safe all the while cocooning her in warm hugs and equally warm kisses seemed to calm a part inside Tony. Atleast something felt normal for once.
"It's a phone. Make sure you're alone when you switch it on. JARVIS will tell you everything but still be careful, alright?", Tony said looking at him in the eye with intensity as if to make sure that he will follow through without mistakes. Steve nodded weakly, unsure of what even was going on around him.
Tony winced internally but didn't show it at all, continuing walking nonchalantly. "How'd you know?", he murmured.
He looked at Natasha questioningly whose lips had quirked up in a corner. "That's Ms.Potts.", she responded with mischievous amusement.
His eyes glazed as the missile hit the Chitauri mother ship and he could swear that he could feel the waves of the explosion as he fell down and down and down.
I guess I wanted to not let go of the fact that yes, people who are depressed or have PTSD can be happy even if it feels like it can slip sooner than they can blink.
I wanted to make sure that they didn't. That they take their time to fit in together like pieces of puzzles even if the ends take longer to fit, that they consider the fact that loving and living together comes with responsibility.
It actually hurts when I see that Bucky/Pepper fics are so less, even if it's a bit unusual to some. There's also this risk that people won't read this fic because that ship is listed as the one of the main ones after Steve/Tony and I also couldn't care less about it. They are the loves of my life for a reason and boy, am I gonna keep writing a fuck ton about them. I'll also write other fics about them soon. And the others. Loads of others. Nvm.
“You know how Thor is mother. Brute and arrogant, he is probably just upset about seating arrangements.” Loki said not without resentment. “What, did I take the seat you wanted beside Sif?”
Bruce resisted the urge to sigh once more but turned to walk into his office. If he was going to do this he might as well be comfortable while he was bombarded with questions that could be answered by looking in the book.
“Do you ever talk to him about it?” Natasha asks, taking a seat at one of the work benches. She faces away from Tony, not wanting to pressure him. “Steve, I mean, about the whole Obie incident?”
“Sir, if you don’t mind me saying, by the sounds of things, this mission is personal.” Mack, one of the new recruits, states staring at Coulson asking him to defy him.
“You are all here because you are the best. But make no mistake, Barton is not to be underestimated. We are only going to have one opportunity to catch him. Don’t fuck this up.”
“Yeah we’ll see if that’s still funny when you don’t get any vodka.” Clint looked at Natasha over his shoulder as he walked over to the bar.
Fun Fact: This is a spite post. Hope you enjoy this update as much I enjoyed writing an upcoming death scene (not anyone important) and a not so subtle name drop.
“He passed away a few years back, didn’t he?” May continues as the team begins to stir behind her. A small twitch in her jaw, the only thing to give away her worry.
Steve couldn’t help but smile at the eccentric man in front of him, brain always running and changing direction faster than the words that came out of his mouth.
Tony still wasn’t exactly sure why he didn’t want to see Obie, but Pepper didn’t ask any questions. She simply kept Obie out of Tony’s workshop, for which he was grateful. She deserved a raise really. The military contract still hadn’t been signed and their current contract expired in two weeks so he knew he wouldn’t be able to avoid him for much longer but all he needed were a few days to sort out what was happening.
“Right, what he said.” Tony agreed and patted Bruce on the back once before turning toward Steve. “So what’s our play Cap?”
They walked toward the water in a comfortable silence, the moonlight lighting their way. Every few steps Steve would sneak a look at the smaller man and more often than not, he would catch the other man staring back. It made him strangely giddy to think that the slight flush on the other man’s cheeks wasn’t all due to his intoxication level but something else entirely.
“Coulson.” Agent Hill greets him, her lips pulling into a smirk. “That was quite the little pep talk you just gave those agents.”
Maybe she knows about the dreams he’s been having, the almost memory like scenes that play out in his head. The visions in which Steve goes on both fantastic and mundane adventures that make no sense. Visions that, more often than not, star a man Steve has never met.
It was late when they arrived back at the tower. Clint believed it was smarter that the files and schematics they acquired be in the hands of the Avengers rather than S.H.I.E.L.D. and she agreed. If anyone could figure out what was on those papers it would be Bruce, Tony, and Jane. It was just past 3 in the morning and given the Avengers call earlier both men – if not every member in the tower – were probably still awake.
Steve chuckled and made his way over to the bar just as Thor came in carrying what looked like a miniature wooden keg.
Steve was stunned. Tony thought he was avoiding him, the last thing he ever wanted to do was hurt him. “Tony, I’m not avoiding anybody.”
“I was having trouble understanding how to use the Hamiltonian equation to solve for an unknown dissipative system. I know you said we have to integrate the force to get a potential-”
“You know, since you already know most of the new interns, its only makes sense that-” Tony is about to suggest Pepper take over for him for the week when she cuts him off.
Pepper smirked at Tony and pushed him toward the door, already knowing she won when Tony didn’t struggle. Sometimes Tony really hated Pepper.
“Well I guess, both my friend, Obie, and I will benefit from this particular target being taken out. Trust me, sweetheart, when I say you will be considerably rewarded, I mean considerably rewarded.”
“Yeah, I guess I should. I mean I don’t really have any swim trunks or any beach wear at all for that matter.” Steve sheepishly replied, reaching to scratch behind his neck, a nervous habit he picked up from Tony himself.
Bucky smiled fondly at that. Peggy and Steve had been together for a short time, but they realized they were better off as friends. Something had happened there, Bucky knew, but neither of them wanted to tell him and he wasn’t inclined to push. Whatever happened, that was their business. He didn’t much need to know about Stevie’s sex and romantic life anyways. Unless, miraculously, it somehow involved him. Which wasn’t likely to happen, considering his Stevie was about as straight as they come, and awkward as a foal learning to walk.
Over the time Clint had been working with Bucky, they had bonded. Clint was loud, obnoxious, and a little unreliable, but that was to expected from a guy who worked three jobs, one of which he wasn’t even paying paid to do. Bucky actually felt bad for not being able to pay him, so he provided Clint meals while he was there.
Before Steve headed off to work at the gym, which was a five minute walk from the shop, he would help Bucky make the flower arrangements they always had on hand. The custom arrangements, though, Bucky had to make those as they came in. Which was a struggle, everyday, for the past six months that Bucky had been open. Semper Fi Blooms was popular among active and retired service members. Something about knowing they were supporting a local veteran really seemed to make people happy. Bucky didn’t have a problem with that. He loved his community, and business was always needed. What wasn’t so appreciated, was the women who come in and out of his store, flirting non-stop, and getting petty when he didn’t reciprocate. That just wasn’t his thing, dating customers.
Apparently sensing his presence, the man started speaking. “These colors clash, the way you have them set up. I took the liberty of rearranging. Much more aesthetically pleasing.”
And Bucky, against his will, had to agree. Steve had set up the display this morning, and for an artist, he couldn’t color scheme to save his life. Not when it came to clothes or flowers. Give him a canvas, and the man could work magic. Anywhere else? Steve Rogers was a tragedy.
His face must have done something funny as he was thinking, because Peggy gave him a knowing smile. He really, really hated that smile. It meant she knew something he didn’t. Before he could ask about it, though, she patted his cheek and kissed his nose.
Steve had gone through a slew of medical exams when he was a child and prone to every sickness known to man, then again when he first became Captain America. Waking up from the ice wasn’t much different.
“Tony.” Steve cut him off before he really took off into one of those rants that Steve loved to hear but frankly tired him out.
At Tony’s question the four of them took defensive stands and Thunderball wielded his demolition ball in a circle above his own head before throwing it straight at Iron Man’s head.
“You are such a sap.” Tony answered in a mocking tone but he was smiling and there was a slight flush to his cheeks so Steve took it as a win. “Come on.”
“No. These interns, where the hell did Obie get them from? Are they even here for educational purposes? Why is Obie even in charge of the interns?” Tony asks, aware that he is getting louder and he should keep his voice in check.
Thor could see Frigga and Odin at the head of the table, Sif and the warriors three were also there already seated as was Loki-
"Moreover, the inner Tony Stark is also a stuttering idiot as much as I have seen. And I've seen loads. Suave, my ass.", Steve's voice drew Tony back from his haze.
Tony wasn't surprised as he turned towards Steve. He was used to not noticing people being there besides him when he was in his zone. Tony tried using his words but he couldn't, his head felt light in happiness.
A roar sounded as Hulk caught the suit of armor and landed on the road in a blink of an eye. Abandoning his shield, he ran behind Thor towards them.
but he felt too blinded by the light of the blast which shone through the dark hole contrasting with the blue cloudy sky around it.
He latched onto the missile, maneuvering it to the angles displayed on his HUD. His eyes scanned the rest of the calculations as Cap's voice echoed in his ear, "Stark, you know that's a one way trip." And somehow he didn't have neither the strength nor the time to analyse the tone in the Captain's voice.
He broke into a jog to catch up with Pepper, being the last in the elevator but somehow being the first fucking person to come face-to-face with Bucky
Tony did take a very discreet peep to find a very dreamy Martha gossiping loudly as she stared at them in happiness. Tony gave a slight giggle as he ducked his head back in, resting it on Steve's chest.
The world had moved on and so had she. So will Steve. She just hoped it'll be with Tony. She had held her godson lovingly telling him that a man didn't look at someone else the way Steve looked at Tony if he wasn't soul deep in love.
When everybody was heading towards the table ready to drop and scarf down anything that appeared before them, Clint lightly tapped on Tony's arm, carefully not touching enough to alert him. "You should hide him better."
It hadn't been easy to open up when Tony despised the thought of just opening his mouth and not blab his usual masks to a shrink. He didn't think he knew how to do that, open up that is.
She had soon stepped back in fatigue and content, pulling Tony in and kissing his head in gratefulness before pushing Tony gently in Steve's arms to continue that dance. Steve's arm tightening around his waist without a second amiss.
That being said, I cannot for the life of me brush off Fury lying about Coulson. Or even if he did for some greater good, not revealing it later to the people who avenged his 'death' doesn't seem easily forgivable to me.
There was a stretch of silence on the other side with an undertone of shaky breaths but he could hear the hurried words clearly, "I love you too. Come back soon." just as a click ending the call sounded back.
He dreaded knowing that Stark would just disappear, not even leaving a body behind, just like Bucky. No closure of seeing them one last time, even if they were just still faces and cold bodies. He jolted out of his thoughts and looked at Thor who was looking at him in dreadful anticipation.
Steve stared at the wormhole with bated breath not knowing what he was painfully hoping for but completely aware that he'd have to call it.
All I do is keep studying or take a break to write fics which has been so good for me. It won't be a lie when I say this is keeping me sane so thank you very much for all the reads, kudos, comments, bookmarks, subscriptions and just anything.
"Incoming.", she warned with a whisper and loving smile as she walked away from him, hooking her arms with Bruce who was trying to blend in again. Seconds later, Steve took that place beside him.
Steve wished he could hear his Ma tell him once more that he was strong enough and she'd love him no matter what. He wished he could see Bucky clap his back and say that he would stay till the end of the line one more time.
It took a whole of embarrassing ten seconds for Tony to realise what was happening. He knew how much dancing had always meant for Steve, he knew what Steve was offering.
Tony woke up to a soft kiss on his forehead like he always did. Usually it was just Steve giving him one last peck before he went for his run. It felt different when he woke up to warm arms and the smell of coffee wafting all around him.
He wished he knew Stark more, wished he had apologized or just done anything. Anything so he would've gotten to talk to him because it felt too big of a loss losing Stark when he barely knew him.
hung on the wall. This time, though, there was also a painting of a daisy besides it. Sprinkled with sunshine. Just like Tony had imagined Steve last night. Exactly the way Steve had now put Tony's thoughts in a single painting.
"Alright, hey. Alright, good job guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is but I wanna try it." Tony went on.
Pepper gave him a mocking smile as she took off towards the private elevator leaving Tony to traipse behind her like a lost duckling. He turned back to see Happy in assurance but the man all but shooed him away muttering about how he needed to check up on some woman's kid.
Pepper tugged on his arm, "Nice, huh? C'mon, I'll even talk to James to let you be the godfather. I miss him too much and I need to crawl in his lap as fast as I can. Probably after a shower."
"I don't have it in me to reprimand you right now. Can we just all curl up in a place together and never get up? Or atleast get up when I remember everything I wanted to pummel you over?" Bucky mumbled as Tony nodded feeling the vibrations where his head was resting near the supersoldier's throat.
