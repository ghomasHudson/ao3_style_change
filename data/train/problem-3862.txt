“Later Cass, but not too much we both know I do a better job of grooming them, then you using Grace.” He said seriously, Cass using his Grace while it worked, didn’t do as good a job as a loving mate’s fingers did.
He also noticed how Cass would smirk every once in a while as he rubbed his head against his dick. He couldn’t deny he was doing it on purpose, not when his wings kept changing to flirty colors of peach, perky lavender and cheeky greens.
Placing the bowl back on the table, he stiffened when he felt a hand groping him in a certain location between his legs. He gave Gabriel a sharp glance, taking note of the innocent gleam in his smokey eyes. Pursing his lips in conflict, wondering if Gabe knew what he was doing to him. Deciding the best way to deal with a warm hand squeezing him in a manner he was honestly reluctant to stop, was to move said hand to his knee. He wasn’t about to take advantage of Gabriel, one it wasn’t right and two if Dean and Cass found out they would have his head. Returning to safer topics with the man,  “Okay buddy you can sleep in another moment, I want you to take one last sip of water then you can close your eyes for a few more hours.”
“Yes Sire, the last words I heard from her, was that she would protect his Grace till the Sons and Consorts came to retrieve it. She would not allow it to fall into evil hands.”
Sam pursed his lips, scowling till he sighed in understanding. “Yeah I get it, okay I’ll give you daily updates, he’s okay with those at least right?”
Sam keeping his eyes very firmly pointed in the direction Cass’s hand was pointing, “Finally, and NEVER EVER tell Dean we had this conversation.”
Then again this was Gabriel, the weakest of the Archangels and the one most likely to depend on it the most. He would come for it or at least revenge in time, so he would make his own plans to capture him once and for all.
“Garth what’s up?” Dean seeing what the Sheriff was doing stood and wandered off to an empty corner.
‘Well, let’s hope they don’t cause problems between now and then.’ Still Dean shifted so he could move fast if they decided to attack.
Dean was still listening to the words the Angel was quietly whispering in his ear. This was why he couldn’t be with him? Because he thought he wasn’t worthy of HIM. Reaching out he grabbed Cass, holding him close. “Cass, you are worthy, more than worthy. It’s me…” He didn’t finish as the other man put a finger on his lips.
‘Dean, it’s not your fault. I was hiding myself again, but to be fair, I was and am still focused on you being so close to Gabriel.’ His mind voice took on a plaintive tone. ‘Why Dean? Why can’t I stand to be so close to him? Why can’t I let you get close to him? I’m sick of this, really sick of this. I want to go back to before I started feeling like this. I don’t even like being near Sam now, all I want to do is take you far away and hide.’
“Here you go boys, let me know if you need anything else.” She patted Gabriel on the shoulder, the same as a mother would to her kids, then headed to her next table. Oh yeah she would be getting a big tip if Gabe has his way about it.
If Dean had been around watching the way Sam and Gabriel were behaving, he would have a hard time breathing from how much laughing he would do. It had taken all of a day for Sam to have figured out, that Gabriel had figured out, that Sam had figured out Gabe had recovered more than he had been letting on. Dean if he could see would be chuckling, grinning, laughing and needling the both of them as their pig headed stubbornness rose to the occasion. Even Castiel would join in on the teasing in his own subtle way. Off hand comments which seemed innocent but was loaded with innuendo.
Robin nodded just as alarmed. “Yes, I sent the Fifth when I learned just the one messenger disappeared, but after learning of the other two I felt it imperative to have them continue with the duty I gave them.”
The spies placed around the clearing snapped and hissed at each other. They had been tasked with watching the two, and if possible snacking on their energy to weaken them. Unfortunately the human had been warded, and the Angel was watching closely for any changes to himself and his mate. So they had only been able to watch. To top it off they would not be able to follow them into the tunnel and cause havoc there. They could not cross the holy wards, not without vaporizing themselves into oblivion, which their sister and brother would not be pleased with.
Returning to his mate’s cock, he didn’t hesitate as he swallowed it in one go. Dean shouted as he was suddenly enveloped by wet heat. He tried to slam himself into Cass’s mouth seeking the release denied to him. His Angel bobbing his head up and down while using powerful suction to bring him to the brink over and over again. His hunter writhed under him, crying tears as he was forced to endure vibrations as Cass growled possessively over his shaft. Reinforcing that everything of Dean’s belonged to him and he wasn’t about to give it up. Dean’s health and safety being at the top of his list.
Munching on his apple, he wandered the halls, coughing every once in a while from dead fairy dust, he started his search. Honestly he couldn’t wait to get rid of his wings in some respects, one being he could actually crawl into the ventilation system and start vacuuming out all the gunk. Sam couldn’t crawl in there the big moose was to large to squeeze through. Don’t even get him started on Castiel either, because he was sure the man would get lost, and he would end up having to crawl in looking for him anyway.
“Is this why no message was given to me? One should have been sent and I should have been informed immediately.” He wouldn’t be pleased he wasn’t informed but he would understand. Rescuing the Consort was more important then him knowing that second something had gone wrong. But he should have been informed within 10 minutes of the incident happening.
“YOU DID WHAT?” The younger brother shouted trying to find his brother, before he realized how futile it was.
Placing a hand on his shoulder, Dean squeezed comfortably, “Don’t worry about it buddy, Sam understands and we will figure out what is going on. I promise you, we’ll figure this out, someone, somewhere out there knows what is going on. We just have to keep digging.” Happiness and trust flowed towards him, filling him with satisfaction that Castiel trusted his word. It sucked what was going on, but eventually they would find a solution as to what was causing Cass to be so out of character. “Now let’s talk about this forest.”
“Oh hell yes I do.” Seeing Cass like this, happy and willing to be used, always made him horny and both knew it wouldn’t take much to get him off. Gripping his Angel’s head in his hands, he thrust in all the way, his balls knocking against his chin as he raced for his own climax. “Christ your mouth is sinful Cass, god I love it.” He threw his head back as he felt himself approaching.
The midnight furred feline rolled his moonlight shining eyes, hissed at them, whacked Dean in the knees as he passed him, and trotted into the tunnel.
Only when he was scraping the last bite did he come back to the present. Could see Sam watching him with a pleased, happy and content smile on his face. A feeling which he could sense in his own soul, and he accepted whole heartedly. His hunter was enjoying watching him enjoy himself, seeing how happy a simple slice of cake could make him. But it was more than that, there was some deeper connection between the two. He could feel it which he would need to think about, try and discover what was causing it and deciding what to do with it. If it was what he was thinking, that Sam was actually his true mate as all evidence was pointing too, that would be very good.
‘Cass torch the place we can’t let any trolls escape, so you’ll have to make it big. I’m clear and so is Sam,’ His tone then turned darker, promising something much worse then death if it came true.  ‘But if you scratch my car I won’t blow you for a week.’ He knew what was coming and though his car was probably a good 20 miles away through rough timber and trails, Cass had the range on him when he was pissed. And boy was his mate pissed.
“Indeed.” Course the Winchester luck was now his luck. The idea both pleased and exasperated him. Still he couldn’t help the silly smile which grew on his face. Being a Winchester was a great honor and he was proud to be part of the family.
“Dean come on it wasn’t that bad.” Sam followed behind him, carrying their duffels. Dean refused to let Cass carry them. Not when he was pissed off at his brother and wanted to inconvenience him in some manner. Cass wisely kept his mouth shut while the brothers verbally dueled.
Dean dropped the book to the ground, forgotten in favor of racing to his mate’s side. Then grunted as he was pushed aside as Castiel released his own wings in an effort to do something. He wasn’t sure what, he just didn’t like all the danger signals his senses were screeching deep in his own soul.
Dean would rather have a beer or something even stronger, but water would work for now. Inhaling the food, it didn’t take long before Dean was finished, his hunger reduced to something manageable but still there. First chance he got though he was going to find a diner and try and eat them out of their stock. Feeling eyes on him, he glanced to his right to see Cass pursing his lips at him. “Something wrong Cass?”
And Gabriel was still suffering listening to the man droning on for hours a day. Though Sam in a bit of true sadistic revenge had also found another channel just as boring and mind numbing. It was a YouTube channel dedicated to the suffering of those waiting on hold. People just filming themselves as they waited on hold. Sometimes there was music, but only the kind which repeated itself constantly in the most horrendous tones. And when the other line connected and the person waiting on hold started to speak, the video changed to a new person waiting on hold. Where Sam found this channel he hadn’t a clue but he cursed him for it.
Dean returned the grin as he took the takeout box and opened it, revealing a large taco salad, loaded with ground beef, spicy peppers, salsa, sour cream, fresh tomatoes, olives and very little lettuce. “Thanks Cass, this is perfect, what did you get?”
Puck pursed his lips but once again she was correct, if they had brought him here with his power depleted, the shock of this realm’s magic could have killed him. He needed to be with his mate, to start the bonding process and he couldn’t do that here. Plus an Archangel in their world without the steady control of a human to balance him, could tear apart this dimension easily. No matter what choice was made there would be some bad with the good. “Again she is wise beyond her years. Tell me the rest.”
Whirling with a startled yelp, Dean almost reached for his blade. Stopping only when he took a good look at the man looking up at him. He looked to in his late 60’s or early 70’s maybe, stood just at five foot, was skinny as a sapling and had a deep chestnut cast to his skin. Hair white as snow, deep brown eyes filled with knowledge known only to him. A razor blade for a nose of which was a pair of wired speckles were clinging with all their might to. His hands had the look of a person who was used to thumbing through all manner of text and enjoying it all. Dressed in   a neat white button down with a green twill sweater, comfortable looking tan slacks and brown loafers, he was the picture of an old grandfather.
It would be nice to spend his money on fun things for the guy, using it for something other than his own amusement. Spoiling his hunter with what he deserved, making his life easier, allowing him to help more people in the long run. Course he would have to wait till his Grace regenerated itself which shouldn’t take too long, maybe around 30-40 years to be at a level which was tolerable. It would probably be at least another 100-200 years before he was at full strength…
“No Dean stop, one of us has to stop this cycle and I have a feeling it will have to be me. I was wrong, so wrong about so many things. Thing we can talk about alter if you wish. I realize now you feel unworthy, I feel unworthy boy do I feel unworthy, especially with how I’ve treated you. How about this one time, we put all that stuff aside and agree to be unworthy together? Because I want you, I want you so bad, and if you want me, then you can have me. You can have me for the rest of your life, for I’ll be yours forever.” He trailed off into silence, letting Dean consider for himself. He hoped Dean would allow him to stay by his side. It would be everything he wanted, everything he dreamed to know he belonged to this most desirable of all men.
‘Of course I do. Cause I’m awesome.’ Standing Dean held an arm out for Cass, who took it and stood. “Come on let’s go find something to eat. I’m starving and you could do with a bite too.”
But taking a shower could wait, instead what was more important was trying to figure out why there was glitter everywhere to start with.
Deep in the ninth level of Hell, spells were about to take place meant to change the course of time and history. In a room built from the bones of humans who had died meaningless deaths, a creature paced confidently. The room was its lab, filled with beakers, braziers, jars of substances best never named. The smell of blood and decay floated throughout the room. In one corner, the freshly drained corpse of some irrelevant lackey twitched in a final death throe. Black ichor running through the gutters arranged in a precise pattern throughout the floor. Lighting from a dozen spell lights provided enough light to bring a lost titanic home.
“GOD DAMN IT DEAN!” He shouted at the top of his lungs, frustration, aggravation, and embarrassment coating every word.
“Hey easy now, it’s okay Cass…” he spoke in soothing quiet tones, feeling how much pain his Angel was now in. Honestly he hated to do this to him, he could have picked another time, but with the way their lives ran, now was all the time they had.
“Sure Cass, I’ll make you something to eat.” Turning he addressed the other man in the room. “Sammy you want something?”
“Yes Dean.” Castiel sighed, he had kinda been hoping to get Dean to take him again. He loved it when he was filled with his mate. But he also understood where Dean was coming from. He also was thinking the hungrier he became the hornier as well. Or maybe it was the other way around. Either way he knew he needed to eat, it would make Dean happy and he would do anything to please his man.
Meanwhile, Dean whirled around, glaring as he did a through top to bottom exam of the celestial being’s vessel. Taking in every single detail, from the way his hair wasn’t his normal disaster but leaning towards rats nest instead. How his face was pinched like he wasn’t eating enough, and yes he knew his friend didn’t have to eat. But he had also noticed how after fixing him a good breakfast or a simple dinner Cass seemed to have more energy. He had also noticed that while he would have once protested the waste of food, he didn’t do so any longer. In fact, he seemed to show up at meal times more often now, hoping for something. Dean decided then and there, he would be getting three squares for the foreseeable future, till Cass was back on his feet. He noticed his tight shoulders, the way he slouched more, or found something to lean on casually. Why he hadn’t picked up on any of this he didn’t know, but he sure as shit would be keeping a better eye on the guy from this moment on. “Cass what have I said about keeping things from me? Especially when you’re hurting man. You know that isn’t cool.”
Ignoring Dean’s glare, and the way his wings changed to reflect his own uncertainty. “Sure Charlie, we’ll do our best. We have to get going. We’ll talk when we get there.”
“Come on Sam do your fucking job, find the bitch and let’s finish this.” Castiel kept a sharp eye on the monster, wishing he could just blast her, but if she was impervious to angel blades and silver, if he hit her with his Grace she might regenerate. She would then be free to start her reign of death and feeding once more. It could not be tolerated, she must be killed absolutely with no recourse for her to ever return.
Quickly bottoming out he took a moment to savor the feeling of being within his love, to know they were so deeply connected. He almost came just from the thought, to know the man below him belonged to him alone and always would.
Castiel was leaning heavily against the door frame, entire body showing how exhausted he was from the emotional upheaval he had to endure thanks to the Fae. Looking at his brother he was in much the same boat. Dean hadn’t moved since had had crawled in, angled himself into the most comfortable position he could in the cramped space and just about died. Not even when he stopped to get his own 2 hours of sleep did they wake.
Looking around himself, he went over the map he had memorized. They were completely defenseless in this area, what they needed was to put something solid behind their backs. The trees were thick in this area, in fact it reminded him a lot of the forest where he and Cass ended up fighting that Manananggal, but a small break in the canopy allowed him to see the mountains rising thousands of feet above them. Which sparked the memory of the rock shelfs and even a couple caves in the area. Mostly bear dens but it might just work. ‘Cass can you grab Sam? Ask him if he remembers where those hunters he met in the library told him about large caves around here.’
Once the fire was going to the point he could leave it for a few minutes unattended, he headed back to the little stream and started his hunt. Looking up and down the banks he found what he was looking for. A small pool filled with fish, about a foot long, rainbow colored with small mouths, large eyes and a lazy demeanor. He managed to catch four with his hands, throwing each on the bank before going for the next one. When he had his catches, he carried them back to the fire, pulled out his Angel blade and began to prepare the fish. Dean was the one to show him how to do this, as Sam had been busy picking flowers according to his mate. Aka gathering plants they could eat.
Dean looked over his shoulder, raising an eyebrow at his mate asking him to groom them. While he knew Cass loved his wings being groomed, he rarely allowed it while on a job. Dean knew why, it was cause grooming was too great a distraction as he really lost himself in the feeling. The love and care Dean took to make sure each feather was in perfect order had him shuddering with love and pride. “Sure of course Cass.”
Keeping his ministrations to his back, Dean relaxed himself as he felt Cass relax, he still wondered what had caused him to lose himself but he would deal with it once his Cass was back. Instead he whispered quietly in his mate’s ear. “Cass wings.” Instantly Cass deployed his dark wings, feathers still in disarray and in serious need of a good grooming. And he planned on doing exactly that. Starting from the top he slowly worked each feather, straightening, brushing and oiling the feathers. Being very gentle and taking oil carefully so he would not arose his nearly asleep lover. After he groomed each feather he would give it a gentle kiss for the finishing touch, then start the process all over again. And the more he groomed the more Castiel relaxed, slowly going from thinking of the pleasure he wanted, to the comfort he needed. His mind relaxed as each ruffled feather was put back in its place, how each tendon was massaged, each muscle maneuvered to relax fully.
“I do not know Sire, I was racing to get to the portal before it closed along with the other companies. I do know I heard someone shouting for you to be informed, but I was through and already engaging in battle. I should have made sure of your notice, I am sorry my Lord.”
Cass knew it would be best to leave, but honestly his hunter didn’t have the strength for the long ride home yet. Not if the dangerously low energy levels he had discovered was any indication. “Dean isn’t up for traveling. The ride up, then the fight took everything he had. He hasn’t even had a good meal yet. Just the few snacks as we looked for clues to the monster.”
“Just what the hell is going on Scout Master? Why were my orders ignored? Heads will roll for this insult!” His entire body was quivering in rage.
Then the Jungle God rose back into the sky shooting towards his den and a well deserved nap and beer.
Swiftly he moved to hide behind the only cover near him, a sweltering pile of rotting cloth, covering things best left to the imagination. He prepared his fire his gun, not wanting to take a chance that this was a possible troll. When the thing didn’t move again, Sam slowly came out from his hiding place, curiosity getting to him as it was wont to do. On unsteady footing, listening to how the mud squelched under his weight, he approached the fermenting pile of rot.
“How far is the range on your uh copter thing?” Dean asked fascinated as he watched the machine move through the woods.
The humans plus one Angel had shuffled in, looking at the cave in a mixture of dismay and relief. It was very small for the large men, but it was protection which they needed. Charlie had dropped her pack, pulling the mattress out to use for later. She had plans for that mattress and she wasn’t going to be thwarted in them. She glanced over at Dean, pursing her lips at the paleness of his features. She was starting to think maybe they should have carried the man all the way down. He was leaning heavily against the wall, holding himself up with both arms as his body shook. The wings he was sporting on his back, shook just as much as the rest of his frame, dull colors of granite, murky greens and dull yellows displayed. She had tried to think happy, perky thoughts at the wings and they hadn’t changed. But when she looked at Cass, seeing the naked worry and even fear, she knew who was overriding her feelings.
“I know so cleaning it will be a real bitch. Now go, but come back alive.” Dean slid down the wall, giving up trying to stand any more, he was simply to tired.
“Dean…” He paused to blast a troll which tried to send a boulder their way. He blasted the boulder and sent the shrapnel back towards them. They grunted as their thick skin registered more the spikes of holy energy than the rock itself. “This is getting tedious, we should just destroy them, I could do it in one strike.”
“HAHAHAHAHA Can’t catch me bitches.” Dean chortled before shooting up into the sky once more, turning and making another pass.
The mud pit found along the bank of a river which was a few hundred feet away. It gave them plenty of room to play without worrying about being dragged into the river proper. Rocks kept large trees from taking root directly on the bank but a few were fighting regardless. Their leaves falling each year adding to the mucky depression the two men were laying in. Water could be heard further off as it splashed over river rock and sunken logs. Birds sang cheerfully along with bullfrogs and insects as they went about their business. The men paid no mind to any of it as they were focused only on each other.
Turning his fall into a roll, he grunted as his body came in contact with all the debris along the stone path, cutting his arms, his cheek and his hand. Coming out of his roll, he reached for a weapon he didn’t have, cursing when he realized he was unarmed. He knew if Dean ever found out he would give him hell over it. Dean was never without a weapon, not even in his dreams was he weaponless, for he had been messed with to much by Angels, Demons and other manner of monsters. Growling at his nightmare really, he faced what he had tripped over. It was humanoid in form, he could see that and not much else.
“In some ways worse, and he knows it and hates it. I need to build his self confidence up again. He is freaking out over needing to run away. He doesn’t normally run from his problems so to be running now, to have his instincts screaming at him to get away so loudly, it’s a real blow to his ego.”
He raised his Grace covered hands once more, fingers splayed out as electric sparks flickered from the tips. Ruined vehicles following his direction lifted and launched themselves at the buildings which had served as a fun camp ground just yesterday evening. More destruction happened as the buildings exploded in a spray of wood and glass when meeting with the chunks of cold iron. Fluid rained down onto the helpless officers trying to contain a danger they had no hope of understanding.
“I’ll stay with him Sam, go check on what you need to, I can keep track via Dean. Get some sleep in your own bed, I have Gabriel.”
It has a lot of adult innuendo, and vague yet perverted wording to allow your imaginations to run wild.
Sure Dean might not get his pleasure this night, his Angel wishing him to think about just how much worry and fear he had subjected him to. But tomorrow in the morning Cass would be there to give him everything he had been denied this night. And he loved it, to feel how much Cass cared and loved him to do this for him. To show him just how special and needed he was. That Cass couldn’t live without him but had a hard time expressing himself when worry overwhelmed him. Knowing the only way he could really show Dean how his actions had affected him, terrified him was more like it, was to express himself using his body, his mind and their bond to drive home the point.
Castiel woke slowly, shivering with pleasure as he smelled his mate surrounding him. He always loved it when Dean slept with his wings out. It made him feel safe and loved like nothing else he had ever experienced did. To know he was surrounded by the man who had saved his life in so many ways. Dean was the best of everything Cass was sure, even with his flaws or he should say because of his flaws, his mate was perfect for him. Cass was just as screwed up in his way and Dean didn’t care, in fact he didn’t see his screw ups as negatives, just saw it as part of being human and accepted him. It had been a long time since anyone had accepted him, honestly he couldn’t remember the last time someone had accepted him, just for him. Not wanting anything from him in return, so it felt nice to be accepted.
Settling back to recover its strength, Gabriel’s Grace released its hold over its Master’s body. It would be up to him now to help the younger man. To learn just how important he would be for the rest of their lives.
Cass led Dean over to the bed, pausing to hold him at the edge of it. “Dean whatever you want to do with me, to me, is fine by me. I’m here for you, I belong to you, take what you want.”
‘Dean? Were you reading my mind again?’ While he didn’t normally mind, when he started getting depressed he preferred he didn’t. He didn’t want to upset his mate with his own problems.
Nodding then even if Cass couldn’t see him, ’Fine then I’m going to lead these guys on a merry chase, let me know when you’re clear.’ He gave another flap of his wings, the wind blowing by his ears and causing his eyes to water. He really need to figure out a way to protect them when he forgot his flying glasses which was all the time.
“Then may I ask what you are doing here?” He asked Dean, but kept an eye on Cass from the corner of his eye. The Angel was still glaring at him silently.
She shook her head. “Silly boy, I’ll fix you something to eat, you go and shower and change.” She patted his shoulder before leaving to head to the kitchen.
“Right so there are some weird foot prints, and every once in a while we hear screaming out in the woods. No one wants to set up out there and at least two factions are based in the woods. I called you to come check it out.”
Raising his own eyebrow in question the man narrowed his eyes in suspicion, but decided to let it slide. “History huh? Well, history is over against the wall that way.” He pointed over behind him. “Maps are over there next to regional territories from around the world. Languages, have their own row, if you are into reading other ones anyway. So many kids nowadays aren’t and are missing out on a lot. If your tastes run to stranger stuff there are some old collections in the back corner, really hard to read bizarre stuff people had traded with me over the years.” He pointed to the various rows as he described his shop. “Feel free to look around I’ll be behind the counter.” Shuffling off he left Dean to explore as he wished.
“Just remember Sam, he’s my mate so while making up is good, don’t try kissing.” Dean grinned as he punched Sam on his way out the door.
Castiel growled at him, Grace rising as he responded to what he considered a threat to his mate. Dean placed a hand on his forearm calming him, even as he worked at settling his better half. “Listen we’re not here for trouble, we wouldn’t have come in other then we needed to eat and pick up a few groceries. We’ll be leaving town in a couple hours…” Before he could say anything more his phone rang. Looking at the caller ID, he huffed as he had to take the call. “I need to take this so if you wouldn’t mind.”
The elder brother deciding not to listen to the nerds speaking, was watching the parking lot. “What the hell? I thought this was going to be one of their normal events?” Dean exclaimed even as he saw two more semi’s pulling in, along with another horse trailer, four more cars following behind them.
“Do you have any news which might redeem your failure.” Puck turned his Celtic gold eyes on his disgraced officer.
Sam shook his head. “Nah they’ll be fine. Dean and Cass needed to get out of the bunker and I wanted to take a break from hunting. Since someone had to watch you, I stayed here researching things, while they went off to have some fun.”
Nuzzling further down he sucked on balls, first one then the other, before taking both in his mouth and pulling gently. Dean moaned wantonly needing more of the talented mouth with a tongue, which was outlining every wrinkle and fold of his sack. Grazing the sensitive skin with his teeth, he felt Dean still at the presumed danger to his balls, even if they both knew there was none. Pulling, he took his time letting those love stones leave his mouth. Once they were out he followed up with another long lick to his shaft, swirling his tongue around the head before retreating down it once more.
Stabbing an armed bastard in the chest, ignoring how he exploded in a rain of molten blood and death, he finally arrived at the side of his love. Picking him up as if he only weight as much as a downy feather, ignoring how Cass cried out in pain, he threw him over his shoulder. Squatting down he launched himself into the air, pumping his wings of Celestial might fast and deep, trying to get distance between him and the enemy. Glancing below him he could see the braver, more dedicated of infernal beings deploy their own ripped and torn, bat like wings. They followed him into the air, snarls on their faces, all intent on bringing him down.
“Dean this is not up for negotiation, you will go I will take care of…” His head whipped around as a new flash of power shrieked against his senses. “What the hell?”
“I’m ready to go now Dean.” Castiel stated as he finished the last few bites of his sandwich, soup already long gone. He knew better than to leave anything behind, not when Dean was making sure he ate.
Looking around he spotted a likely looking area to land, it wasn’t to far from the car either. Probably only a mile away, considering he had parked under heavily wooded conditions so no pesky law enforcement people would stumble upon it. Flapping his wings rapidly he brought them in for a landing.
Dean was breathing hard, wings flared behind him, deep honey colored with the tips of flames burning brightly. His mate’s wings also were displayed, pure black menace with crimson edges.  They probably should put them away, they had been hit quite a few times, but they provided much needed protection and more than once Dean had to launch himself to avoid being pounded into human burger. Cass was holding back, but his rage was growing, his instincts demanding he destroy those who were threatening his mate once and for all.
“Thanks Sam, I’m okay now, just walk slow.” Gabe leaned heavily into Sam’s side for a few moments as he recovered his balance. He felt drained yet oddly complete for the first time in his life, hmmm maybe sleeping with Sam did more for his recovery than he realized. But for the moment the boy was pretty freaked out about the whole thing so he wasn’t going to push him.
Cass wanted to want to say something, but honestly what would he say other than he loved Dean. That HE was an idiot for denying Dean the right to claim him? Dean was right to put off talking, neither were up to the heavy conversation ahead of them. The multiple battles, the fairies, the long ride home all adding up to needing to recover not discover. “Of course Dean, I’ll take the floor…”
Dean grabbing a fork, started digging into his food, Sam already munching on his. “True but we don’t know how many are out there, trolls travel in family units and I have a feeling we are probably looking at a large family. I don’t want you getting burned out if there are too many.”
Dragging his eyes away from the feathered silk with reluctance, he took a good look around. He couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary, not till he called on his Grace, giving it the typical twist he had always ended up having to do in order to see the fae. “Oh my!” He stated startled as he looked around the room. He seriously was surprised he hadn’t even thought of twisting his Grace to look for the fairies. Must have been the distraction of possibly healing his wings.
Dean rose up from where he was sitting behind Cass, wrapping his arms around his Angel. He could feel just how overwhelmed his mate was. It wasn’t fair for Castiel, wasn’t fair to them, wasn’t fair to Sam either, that they were all struggling to deal with feelings they had no explanation for. His mate was doing the best he could, but each day the struggle grew, the need to take Dean away, to hide. And Dean was starting to think it might be best to do exactly that. He would hate to give Sam up, but what was happening to Cass was breaking him. Slowly each day he was struggling with himself, to ignore instincts which were screaming more and more at him.
Sighing Dean understood it wasn’t meant to be, he wasn’t meant to have what others were entitled too. And so like normal he buried his feelings, knowing it was for the best, it was what was expected of him. He just wasn’t destined to be loved the way he secretly craved.
Dean watched as the largest god damn snake he had ever seen, exploded with a raged filled roar towards the thunderous sky. His sleek and supple body growing larger and larger, as he prepared to take his fury out on those who had trapped him. Wings the color of summer sunsets spread, spanning over 500 feet in either direction, casting the entire valley into shadow. More feathers sprouted around his square head like a lion’s mane, matching his shimmering wings, light billowing forth as they beat against the wind, to combat the darkness coming from the still open portal. His body grew to the length of a dozen football fields, thick muscles contracting and expanding as he showed himself, more feathers growing down his spine, till they branched out at the base of his tail.
Snapping broken and cracked beaks, the diseased and decaying soulless ones stretched their broken wings. Giving powerful sweeps as they launched into the air to report what they had seen. It was all they could do for the moment. At least till the two arrived at the place where they would be trapped and used as bait for the ones they really wanted. So minus a few minor problems everything was going according to plan.
Sam let loose his own breath he was holding. He hadn’t wanted to leave Dean behind either, knowing even with wings, his elder wouldn’t let it stop him from kicking ass. “Great, Cass, why don’t you and Dean go pack? I’ll go and check my laptop, download what I think might be useful.”
“I’ll be honest with you, he’s still very weak and sickness is starting to claim him. I’ve burned it out but it was odd, like it wasn’t done with him.” He would have to hit the books tomorrow to find out what could be causing it. Not to mention they would have to figure out why Gabriel was out there in the first place.
The less said about the last few hours of travel the better. Dean was sore, he was tired and holy shit he was going to be topping Castiel for at least a month. One because just the idea of anything large, hard and thick getting near his ass was down right frightening at the moment, and two Cass deserved it as a reward for saving him. Christ he had no idea snakes could get that large, or that they had an anal fixation. He also vowed to stop watching all that tentacle porn Sammy kept hidden on his computer. Course Sam thought he was being so clever, hiding it under the name ocean environments, aquatic life research.
“Now we need to find a way in. If he sends reinforcements they would appreciate being able to reach the Second Son and Consort.” Leading the way the orange haired fae went around to the back of the building, her partner following as they searched for a way in for those who could handle cold iron.
Deep in the Eastern lands far from the Fae empire another race rose up in response to all the changes taking place. Much debate had been taking place for months on end as the benefits vs the consequences were discussed. A debt had been incurred by them, though the ones they owed knew it not. Like the Fae they paid their debts and would see to it that the payment was done in full and in perpetuity, The only problem they had, was how it was to come to be. For they couldn’t just present themselves and state they were here to serve the brothers. They would be rightly suspicious of their actions, though they were of the utmost honor and integrity. Their breed was known for their honesty and fierce devotion to doing what was right.
Because he had lost that freedom, he was determined for Dean to feel it in his place. He knew his hunter would love it, once he got the hang of it. All he had to do was get the stubborn bastard to work with him on it!
He could feel his mind going to mush, ‘Dean…’ he sighed feeling soft and warm and like he was worth something.
Supporting Dean once more wrapping an arm around his waist, he led him to the bed once again. “Sleep Dean, you need to rest.” The Angel lowered him gently, pushing his down when he struggled to rise, he placed his fingers on his forehead.
His Grace, fueled by the knowledge that it had at last found its Master’s mate, held nothing back. It attacked the being with as much holy power as it could collect and it was surprising just how much it could collect when protecting what belong to it. With blasts of holy fire, Gabe’s Grace raced down the bond like raging ocean waves fueled by tropical storms. Smiting the evil before it could do anything more, forcing it to withdraw with vast amounts of pain as the power of an Archangel taught it the error of its ways.
Reaching over to the side table, he pulled out the lube, dribbling a generous amount into his hand and over their cocks. Gripping them in one hand he set to work jerking them off. ‘Don’t come Cass not till I’m in you, I want to come inside you.’
Running his hand down his hunter’s face, Cass shook his own head even if Dean couldn’t see it. “No, it doesn’t feel like someone is draining me. I have a feeling its the magic of this place. Whoever created it didn’t wish for any but their own kind to use it. The fact we are walking, being led through it, leads me to think a being other than the ones who created it, absconded with the tunnel.”
Running a hand through his hair, he heaved a deep breath. “Cass has been acting more erratic in the last few months. Small things at first but it's accelerated in the last month.”
“Dean?” Cass asked as he continued to work. Though his fingers did slow as Dean ran his fingers gently up and down his leg. He couldn’t help himself as his cock slowly filled of its own accord. Not like he would try and stop Dean from teasing him, whatever his mate desired with him was okay in his book.
Sam cursing himself for being an idiot, there was one way to find Dean, now to get the Angel on board with it. “Cass I need you to think of Dean, and what he means to you.”
They had just come out of a doorway and were about to head to the Ninth Gate of Hell. One they had locked down centuries before.
He wanted to runaway, to steal Dean away from this room and everyone in it. But he also wanted what Dean was offering him. He wanted his older brother back in his life, maybe talk to him about all the strangeness which was happening to him. Maybe Gabriel could explain just why he was feeling this way? Tell him it was normal or not normal or something, anything really. Gabriel was much older than him, he had to know why he was acting this way. Then again probably not, Gabriel had run away long ago and probably had never come across another bonded Angel. He was so tired of feeling like crap and he wanted it all to stop, one way or another. So they had to bring Gabriel around and at least get rid of one problem. No doubt more would be added once he woke and could explain what the hell happened to him.
Once again ignoring the unspoken question, which when he thought about it was getting kinda old. Changing the subject to something more benign, “It’s complicated. Listen how is the acting going? Did you get the part you were looking for?”
“Nothing Sam, I just realized something I had been missing for a hell of a long time.” He waved away the concern he could see growing in his hunter’s eyes. “Nothing you can or need to do. But next time I meet a certain person, I plan on ripping his little pointy ears off.”
Behind her Puck stepped through then stopped suddenly at the sight before him. “Oh Mother Aerdrie Faenya what the hell happened here?” He exclaimed shocked at the sight before him.
Cass coughed beside Sam, arm hanging limply for a few minutes while he got his bearings back. “Cass you okay?” Sam shouted over the wind.
How in the hell did he end up in bed with Sam wrapped around him? And what was he going to do about it? Did he want to do anything about it? Being cuddled like this felt pretty damn good actually. Maybe he could just relax here for a little longer, not like he had any place to be?
“And how do you expect to help? The Prince and his Consort are facing creatures of true evil they have no understanding of!”
As he mouthed the word “Gabriel.” He was slammed by memories not his own, the hellish landscape disappearing in a blaze of whiskey colored illumination.
“Yeah, wish we had more, but everything we have is here.” The items in question was a two guns, enough ammo for three clips each, salt and holy water, Angel blades and rope.
“I could tell, so want to head out? Lines at the bank are probably shorter now that lunch hour is mostly over. Or do you want to head back to the bunker? Or go somewhere else entirely?” He smiled at the frown Gabe gave him at the idea of going back to the bunker.
Trent sympathized with Jason knowing the job just got more complicated. “Want me to call them in? Let you organized the search parties?”
Following Dean into the bunker proper they headed down the halls toward the kitchen. Entering  the room Cass placed the books on the dinning table, while Dean placed the bags on the counter. “I’m going to put these away, what do you want for lunch?”
Hey all sorry for the extremely long time between updates. I got hit with a massive case of writers block and needed to let my mind stew for a bit to clear things up.
Dean was snappish for the trip back to the camp grounds after he woke up. He didn’t blame Cass in the least for what happened, Charlie was a manipulative bitch at times and this was one of them. Waking up with his Angel in his arms had been everything he had ever dreamed of, and it hurt. It hurt a lot to realize what it really felt like to feel the man he loved in his arms, knowing as soon as Castiel woke he would pull away from him.
Dean looked over at the destruction, the fear in the other people’s eyes as they looked at the still glowing being. He turned back to his Angel, gazing into his glowing blue eyes, seeing stars, moons, and new born suns shining back at him. Looking even deeper he could see something else which he couldn’t explain, but was sure in time he would be able to. The bond they shared had alerted him to the danger his love was experiencing, forcing him to do things against the nature Castiel preferred to keep. There was some foreign entity circling around his Angel, changing things, doing things to Cass he didn’t like, couldn’t understand. What their reasonings were in trying to change his friend he didn’t know, but he would find out. For too long the Fae had been involved and it was time they left them alone. Even if he had to hunt down and murder all of them.
He then paused as he realized the stupidity of his wish. Of course Dean and Cass were busy with each other this morning. They were busy with each other EVERY morning. Throwing his head back he snarled “God damn it!”
Shaking his head, his shoulders drooped. “I may have my full powers, but the evil and corruption radiating from this place, no it’s much stronger than what a single Angel can cleanse. An Archangel could do so probably, but for one of my rank no I would need help.”
Lounging in a throne made from the blood and bones of those he had tortured for pleasure, covered in the canvas of their skins. Skulls facing out in grotesque images of pain and brutally at the end of the arms. Located in an open amphitheater style area made of blood red stone and oozing black liquid dripping from the gutter holes. The walls were decorated with images of past battles, past orgies of the most corrupt and despicable acts. Heads, broken, scalped and stripped bare of all flesh dotted the space as well. Screams were easily over heard as more souls were subjected to their endless torture.  There were only a few places one could enter into the nearly 1000 foot death room, each blocked by double doors and guarded by creatures born from the nightmares of demons themselves.
Castiel ignored the gasp of pain Dean released as he went through his system. “Hold on Dean, I know it hurts, but I have to get that wretched creature out of you.” He followed the creature down, surrounding it with his power and burning it alive within his hunter. Touching parts of Dean he was sure Dean would never want anyone touching.
He could see his mate distress, it was heart breaking and Cass wished he was in his place, he watched how Dean’s wings changed to a dark smokey gray with flashes of abyssal black and electric blue. The blue the same color of his own eyes as he watched the creature swoop down with a gleeful shriek before digging her razor sharp talons deep into his mate’s shoulder. She gave such a massive backward jolt to his joint, everyone could hear it clearly as it shattered instantly.
He shook his head as he listened before finishing his conversation. “Yeah sure, just remember don’t tell Sam, he’s still busy with Gabriel.”
Looking at him as if he had grown horns out of his nose. “Dude I do hold down a job, I have an apartment, I do need to buy groceries like everyone else. Kinda hard to hide in humanity if I didn’t act like a human. Which means I need money, which means I need a job.” He rolled his eyes as he slid deeper into the seat. “Besides I like working, it’s fun to see how real humans behave around each other.”
Dean, starting to sweat and needing to put a bit of distance between him and his mate, so he headed towards the trunk and made sure everything of his was in it. “Sam you have everything?” He asked more to distract his mate from murdering him where he stood.
“Dear Goddess what happened next.” Already he was redoing plans in his head, trying to decide how they would rescue the Prince’s Consort.
“He says you need to put your hand on the wall. Where the moon is shining and do it quickly, the light only stays for a few moments.”
Happily pleased smile on his face, showing all his gums, “Yes, my mate.” Castiel obediently made himself comfortable in his nest, spreading his legs in open and wanton invitation for Dean to take what was rightfully his.
Continuing to hold his shoulders, Dean looked deeply into his mate’s eyes, willing him to see everything he was showing him. “Hey now, none of that, you made a mistake. But it could so have easily been me who made it in some other fashion. Castiel I’m not blaming you for wanting to heal me, I needed it, I really did, but just as you worry for me I worry for you. I need you to know and accept we’ll both make mistakes. This was a big one but nothing bad happened and some good actually came from it.”
“Six in the last two months including those hunters who never came back, so not even they are being spared.”
Leaning back on his knees the Angel debated what he wanted to do first, there were so many possibilities. Making up his mind he arched over his mate, reaching to the back of his head and began to slowly kiss and lick his way down Dean’s back. Rubbing his slack clad cock in the crack of his mate’s ass while placing gentle kisses everywhere. His shoulders, spine, neck, hands rubbing his skin sensually as he peppered him with kitten licks between kisses. Delighted at the hiccups and groans his hunter was making as he pleased himself with his love’s body. Cass could feel Dean’s frustration as he ground against the pillow for friction, which he received but it didn’t do any good. His cock was thoroughly locked down and his own pleasure would have to wait till the morning.
“No you didn’t, you made a mistake, we all do, it just shows you’re as human as a Celestial being can be. Castiel, it will be alright, I’m alright, you’re alright, and we are both still learning about each other. Learning about how much we care and how far we will go to protect each other.” He chuckled now as he relaxed his grip on his Angel’s shoulders and rested his forehead against Cass’s. “Just we kinda have to remember to temper our protection with common sense. We love each other so much we can be blind to many things. Let’s try and see things clearer from now on.”
When Cass felt Dean slotting between his ass he hummed his approval but didn’t do much to encourage Dean to take him yet. He was enjoying the attention as Dean intended and hoped for. The more he relaxed his Angel the more likely it was Cass would forget all about Dean taking him. Which is what he wanted, which he was working for.
Dean cocked his head wondering what had Cass feeling so thrilled and jubilant. “Cass? What has you in such a good mood?”
“You better not be interested in bar wenches Dean. I don’t share and if you think I would, I’ll quickly show you the error of your ways.” Tone deep and possessively feral, as the Angel quickly responded to his mate’s inappropriate thoughts.
It only took a few minutes, but in that time, Dean was bent over backwards, feeling as if his entire body was on electric fire. And yet at the same time, he never wanted it to end. He could feel Cass moving through him, touching every part of what made him, him. Accepting all of him, wanting him, yet still holding himself back. It frustrated him so much. Why did the Angel say he wanted him but wasn’t allowed to have him? The only thing he could think of was it had something to do with how dark and twisted his soul was. Cass was a pure perfect being, made from the light of creation itself. It had to be the reason he wouldn’t take him, it would stain his own Grace if he accepted what Dean was offering. So be it, Dean wouldn’t push him any more, he knew his own self worth, which wasn’t much. How much was nothing actually worth to a wonderful creature like his Angel?
“What why?” Still he took the device and slipped it on his arm. He felt the tingle which meant it was working, now only those standing within a couple feet of him would see him. Eyes focusing on the serious face of his brother, “What’s going on Sammy?”
“NOT now Sammy.” He snarled, wings pumping furiously as he zipped between the trees in such a way Sam thought they were going to end up dead. A few moments later he came to where Cass was even now pinned to the ground by a pack of the ugliest creatures he had ever seen. They were warthog like in appearance, but had many differences, their feet had five toes, each equipped with a razor sharp talon. Four tusks not unlike the trolls twisted out from their lower jaws, while their upper sported a pair of retractable fangs like a snake. Glowing diseased flesh colored eyes tracked the Angel’s every movement as Cass tried to break free.
The beast had been pouring everything into staying ahead of him and Naoko, jerking Dean around as she flew. Now it would all stop.
Course with Gabriel it might mean four if he decided to stick around. Something he would be very much in favor of if he was being honest with himself. Over the last few days, pretty much since he woke up and found himself in Gabe’s bed, he wanted to be closer to the Archangel. Learn more about him, because he was fascinating as not only an Angel but as a person. He knew so much history, had traveled the cosmos and seen the stars being born. He wanted to hear about all of it. He wanted to hear about the things which were history in books for him, but was real life experiences for Gabriel.
“Lock them in a room together? Look up some sort of speak only truth spell? Get in their face, tell them they’re idiots in love and need to just get on with the shagging?”
The man tilted his head to the side, contemplating his request before nodding. “Yeah follow me, do you need help picking him up? We can take him to my office, I have a couch in there.”
“Lets go Dean.” Cass called out as he opened the door. Stepping through he finished up with. “And if you like once done with breakfast we can see about sharing a morning flight together.”
She stepped back behind the counter, eyes large as she looked between the two men. Reaching for a set of keys she shakily held it out to him. Carrying Dean he awkwardly took them in his hand, glancing at the room number which said room 2. “Gracias a ti.” (Thank you)
“One ham and pepper omelet coming up then.” Dean was pleased with the decision, at one point Cass would have simply said whatever you want to fix. But he was now starting to assert himself more, choose things which would make him happy. And by doing so he made Dean happy, he wanted his mate to be comfortable with knowing his choices would be listened to and accepted.
“I’m seeing how fast his heart is racing. Okay its good.” He moved so he could kneel behind his brother. “Help me with him Cass, we need to see how badly he is hurt.” Together they managed to sit him up. Sam was going to prop him against the tree truck, instead Cass kept going and leaned him against his own chest. “Cass?” Sam asked both puzzled and worried.
“You’re pretty quiet Sammy, everything alright?” Gabriel asked, looking over at him rather than making faces at people they passed.
“Good, I’m going to step back. See if you can move them yourself now.” Doing as he said he would, he returned to facing Dean, carefully keeping his hands to himself. He really didn’t need to flex them again, no matter how much he wanted to run them through all that softness.
Which it did as a flood of light racing towards his own soul, striking him with such force he cried out in surprise and amazement for just the few moments he was awake. Then he was falling, falling into his own darkness as unconsciousness took him.
“Fine, but don’t blame me when I get all hot and bothered.” Cass groused with very little heat really. He continued working Dean’s feathers, feeling how Dean relaxed as his feathers were coated in oil. He honestly wished Dean could naturally produce the oil he needed to keep them healthy. He loved it that Dean smelled like him due to using his own oil, but wing oil was important for proper feather health. His own wings he could keep healthy with his Grace if needed. But for true wing health, having a mate inspect and spread the oil was a heavenly experience. One he had never expected to have before he met Dean.
Dean felt it arrive and begin its own exploration of his mouth. He welcomed him with joy, loving how Cass was taking part, being active rather than passive. For that is what he wanted, he wanted an active partner in his life. He wanted Cass as his lover and only him. Running his hands down Cass’s sides, he slowly worked on feeling every part of him. They still wore clothes, way to many clothes, but for now this would work, being together, growing together.
Gabriel meeped forlornly, needing something to wet his throat from how suddenly dry it became in the room. “Here you go buddy, listen I think it will be good for you to hear some voices beside my own all day. So I’m going to leave it on this station. It will be good for you.” He hid his smirk again as he felt the Archangel shudder once more against him.
Standing as his anger grew fed by worried frustration he glared at his brother in law. “I think Dean should decide if he is going to take a shift Castiel. We need his help because you need rest too, he won’t be happy if you push yourself. Plus you are the only one who can tell what is going on with him. If you are down due to overwork it does no one any good.”
“Good make me come on your cock, make me come from your cock alone.” His eyes were closed tightly as he concentrated on how hard he was being fucked. How he was feeling everything within his very soul as their bodies connected their spirits. He loved this feeling, this deep connection to the one person who had saved him from everlasting loneliness.
Rolling his eyes while chuckling, Cass nevertheless did as he was asked. Moving his body off the very comfortable location of his cock nestled between Deans cheeks, he rolled his man over. “You are one demanding bastard Dean, you know that right?” But his eyes were so filled with joy and humor Dean couldn’t take offense.
“Dean?” Cass asked softly, wondering what Dean was doing, why he was so stiff. He wasn’t surprised when Dean’s wings changed from a confident blue to a shy yellow.
I will say that I have used Balthazar in the way most appropriate for him. AKA he is shameless Angel/man whore who likes to corrupt and indulge in all manner of adventurous well adventures.
The lance flew straight and true glowing in time with the runes as Power shrieked against the war torn air, hitting the pulsing red gem in the center, shattering in a spray of prismatic crystals. The infernal ward made of death and hatred, stood no chance against holy light fueled by love and life, wielded by a truly righteous man defending his heart. The wards which were keyed to the lode stone, followed the first as they too shattered freeing the God they had trapped.
Not sure how good their hearing was, Dean whispered in his mate’s head. ‘How long do you think we can hold out here?’
“We also noticed you had about 7 beers back at the dinner.” This Dean kept quiet about, if he didn’t confirm he wasn’t incriminating himself. The cop noticed and narrowed his eyes. “How about you step out of the car and run a few quick tests huh?”
He kept his eyes firmly on his Angel’s face, what he could see of it at least, watching his every move as he sucked firmly. Burying his nose all the way to his wild pubic hair, to almost pulling off, nibbling at his tip. Cass shuddering each time he did so, for he was extremely sensitive at his head. He sharpened his tongue and probed the slit for a few moments, listening to his mate’s broken breath as he tried to contain himself till he was given permission. Dean grinned to himself before he started to hum.
“Come on please? Please, please, please, huh, huh, huh, huh, please, can we go out. Let’s go out Sammy-kins. I want to go out, we can go see a movie, or take a walk in the park. Or even find a quick job. But let’s do something besides sitting in the bunker.” He used his best cajoling whine voice. The voice which had annoyed his older brothers for eons and always worked on getting him what he wanted. He was just pissed it didn’t work nearly as well on Winchesters.
Dean glaring at his brother, huffed before following his sight line to whatever was behind him. What he saw had him cocking his head in confusion, for all he could see was feathers, many feathers, many feathers which were fluttering. Blinking because he didn’t recall having any type of feathered art on his wall. He was pretty sure if someone had put some up he would have tossed it. He moved his head further to get a better look, only to see the entire collection of feathers move. Stilling, as his mind tried to catch up to what he was seeing, the only thing he could process was the wide variety of yellow feathers he was viewing. Lemon yellow, banana yellow, Canary yellow, both dark and light variations. All he could do, all his mind was allowing him to do, was stare as best he could at what was behind him.
“However way you want.” Dean moaned breathlessly, he didn’t care just as long as Cass kept playing with him. Kept touching him, smoothing the cool clay over his over heated skin.
Dean’s mood was the foulest it had been in years when they arrived, he was cold, wind burned, and his wings were a fucking mess. Seriously they needed some serious grooming, the feathers were ruffled, crooked, or folded over each other. He knew it couldn’t be normal, weren’t wings meant to be smooth during flights? So why did they get all bent out of shape during a simple car ride? Plus because they were all fucked up they itched like mad, made him want to just scratch his hands constantly down the damn things to get them to stop.
“Yeah right, you’ve been hanging around Sammy too long.” Dean took a swipe at Castiel, not really believing it would connect and wasn’t surprised when it didn’t. The fact Cass was pulling pranks was actually pleasing to him. His mate was far to serious most times so when he was feeling playful he wasn’t about to discourage him.
“You mentioned someone named Puck. Who is he? I’ve heard the name but I always thought he was just a character in a play.” He sat back down, pushing his laptop and books to the side to simply listen to Gabe.
Licking his lips, letting his passion and his delight carry through their joined souls,“Oh yes, now it’s time to play.” He grinned when he felt Dean’s entire system shudder in involuntary excitement. While his mate’s mind didn’t like the idea of not being allowed to come, his senses were all for Cass doing what he wished with him. His hunter was such a lovable assbutt.
Dean’s mind was gone, the pain still made up of thundering herds of war horses and B-17 bombers, reverberating in his skull in a never ending loop. “SAMMY WHAT THE HELL? SAMMY WHY DO I HAVE WINGS? I HAVE WINGS, WHY DO I HAVE WINGS?” He kept spinning, his wings spreading though centrifugal force, knocking into lamps, the tv and the book case. Pain radiating down the wing arms to his back which screamed at the added stimulation.
Finished stretching, Dean could feel his eyes wanting to close and with a growl decided he should go and explore instead, figure out a way to stay awake. Cass tilted his head to the side before coming to a decision. Returning back to the cave, he sent out the one person Dean would listen to if nagged at enough. It took a while but Sam managed to persuade Dean he needed to rest more than he needed to explore. They had several hours before sundown and they would all need to be fresh if they were to find the Manananggal and kill it. Sighing Dean had relented and returned to the cave, Charlie already setting up the air mattress to sleep on.
“Because I’m not allowed to be. He deserves so much more, I have nothing to offer him…” Cass admitted softly.
‘Yes dear.’ Dean said cause he couldn’t help himself, he knew it would rile his mate up even more in his falsely sweet tone.
“Heard there was a good bar around here. Great food and good beer, wanted to check the place out.” He kept his eyes peeled for the place he wanted to stop at, hoping it was still open.
“Yes Sir.” The Captain said with as much calm as he could muster given his excitement at finally have duties which would test his company and himself.
“Come on I’m hungry and I heard good things about this place.” Dean said in lieu of answering as he opened and closed his door, making sure his .45 was tucked securely in his back holster.
And as was always the case, when it came to the man who he raised from hell itself, so many years ago, he surrendered. Closing the distance between them, he leaned in whispering his own words. “I’m sorry Dean.”
“Yes Sir.” Dean watched as he shoved them in an old box he had laying around pushing them over when done. “Thank you.”
Cass stuttered trying to find something to say, but the wings gave him away, multiple shades of deep slate, manatee and pastel lemon all blossoming.
(Hissing deeply, beating his sunrise wings to keep all save Robin pinned to the ground, as he reminded them of the power he wielded. He swiped his tail across the landscape, crashing it into the rock side and where the portal they had just come out of had been located. It was now a ruin of stone, meaning they would have to find another doorway to open and return with.)
And where the hell did those thoughts come from? He thought for sure he had buried them so deep, they would never bother him again. He knew Cass would never be interested in a person like him, not someone as pure as an Angel of the Lord. Even a fallen Angel was better than whatever it was he was. He had nothing to offer Cass, which wasn’t difficult to realize, since he was nothing in the great scheme of life.
Eyes softening with pleasure and love, Dean leaned back in and kissed him again. Hands moving to remove what few clothes Castiel wore. How Sammy managed to dress him or why after taking him to the workroom he wouldn’t worry about. He slowly removed the blue tie which for so long had driven him nuts. First in annoyance then in fondness as he grew used to seeing it on him. He had daydreamed about the things he would do to Cass while only wearing that tie. Dropping in on the side table, the elder Winchester slowly unbuttoned his shirt, laying his hand underneath, right over his heart.
About to step forward to challenge the ghost to bring it, a hand on his shoulder stopped him. Glancing back he could see Sam staring at the three, face concentrating hard on whatever details he was taking in. The Archangel wanted to say something but when he tried, Sam squeezed him even harder, signaling him to be quiet. Instantly he obeyed, surprised at his reaction but accepting it.
In a moment of clarity, he felt all his Grace disappear, how or why he had no clue. But he knew this would be the end of him. He couldn’t even feel Dean, the agony his vessel was in overwhelming any other thoughts he might have had.
‘Dean, Sam, we are slowly being surrounded.’ Castiel’s voice whispered in his mind, the use of his brother’s name informing him Cass was speaking to both of them. Which rarely happened if he could avoid it. The Angel said it didn’t feel right and he felt strange and a bit sick when he did talk. Since he was doing it now, meant they were in big trouble and they had to think of something fast.
Instantly uncomfortable, he shifted closer to the door. Rubbing the back of his neck he hesitated with saying what he had to say.
“Good, Sammy, Charlie climb on. We are getting out of here.” He waved at his brother to go to the cat.
“Yeah I mean not great, but yeah I can do it.” She couldn’t stop staring at the destruction before her. Never had she seen such wreckage up close and involving people she knew intimately. She had seen the Angel lose control of himself as he set about protecting them from the police and other authorities present. She had borne witness to a true Heavenly Warrior fighting to defend what he claimed as his own. It was both awe inspiring and terrifying.
Dean ignored the behavior for the most part, his reasoning being they didn’t know why he was acting this way and they had other things to do. Cass didn’t push it beyond being in the same room and between them at times, so for the moment it was better to live with it. Still he spent a few hours a week looking at books which might explain why he was doing so, when he thought no one was looking.
“Don’t even BREATHE the word acid near my baby.” Shaking his head at the mere thought, “We’ll have to use fire. Which will be interesting since the locals probably won’t want us burning down their forest.”
Here is another chapter. I know it took a while to get posted. It's actually in two parts as the full chapter was a whooping 25K.
The pull was growing stronger, so strong in fact he found himself slipping the ring onto his right hand before he could stop himself. He felt a very slight tingle then a warmth which reminded him of coming home to fresh baked cookies, sunlight and whole hearted love. Then the ring faded from sight and his mind, hiding itself as decreed to keep him safe from those who would do him harm. When the time was right, it would once again reveal itself and Dean’s standing in his new House.
Grunting he raised his arms, prepared to lay waste to whatever might be coming for them when he sensed movement from the opening he had ripped in the side of the rock. A being came flying out, the source of what was alarming his instincts to the deepest part of his soul.
Finally Cass collapsed into his mate’s arms, exhausted from his emotional upheaval, Dean catching him as he always would. ‘Cass?’ Dean whispered feather light in his mind.
The noises both men were creating would do any porn studio proud. Slurping, sucking, lightly chewing on one end, while the other was muffled by the ball gag. Having to moan and groan while shuddering as he was eaten out so deeply. His cock straining under him, wanting to come and unable to. Cursing Cass at times only to be spanked firmly for his cursing troubles.
Deciding for the sake of his people’s souls he needed to know if they were holy or fallen, he challenged them once more, abet much more respectively. “Ya veo, por favor perdóname. (I see, please forgive me.”
Gathering their things they started their way back to where the First Prince and his Consort slept. What the future would hold they didn’t know but would do everything they could to prepare for it.
Sam bitch face instantly on, “Two Dean, two rooms, I do not want to be anywhere near you and Cass tonight.”
Since they were unable to cross the room, the iron and was that a line of salt rock, outlining the room? They decided to see how good of a target he would make. Firing their six shooters, they were pleased when the bullets met their target. Sam collapsed in a pool of his own blood. Lungs sucking air and moving none of it to his dwindling blood supply. Gloating delightedly, their congratulations with each other was short lived as a new light entered the room. Blasting the three with such power they disappeared, all shock at seeing someone they had been vowing revenge on for centuries.
“Great they are going to be those types of ghosts.” Dean would totally be bitching and moaning at those ghosts, he hated the ones which didn’t show themselves, made them twice as hard to kill. Castiel would roll his eyes and try and help in his own awkward way. Which made him think, how would Gabriel try and help? He didn’t deal with this crap to often, would he enjoy it? Sam knew he wouldn’t want to live any other life now, but if his Angel didn’t like the life where would that leave them?
Wishing them luck he disappeared into the foliage, while Cass turned his footsteps towards the area the cat had described. Dean was sleeping in his arms, it would take him some time to recover. Time he wasn’t sure they had or could afford, but would have to do so anyway. The woods here were swaying in the breeze, the humidity rising fast in anticipation of the next storm getting ready to break over their heads. He wanted to get Dean under cover before it hit, though his wings would keep him dry enough. Sighing at how complicated things were becoming he kept moving, worry over so many things dogging his every step.
They were placed on a bench, shackled to the arms and legs and left there with two guards. The rest of the squad left to report in what they had learned. Sam kept looking skyward wondering if the Manananggal would head this way. God he hoped Cass and Dean could take care of her. If they couldn’t, if they didn’t find her body he wasn’t sure what they would do.
He returned his attention to the conversation when Dean slammed down into one of the library chairs, causing it to groan.
Dusk was settling, but that didn’t stop Dean’s wings from changing hues. No they continued to grow brighter as more people wished for light. People were starting to make camp fires, fix dinners and as was expected, a few getting drunk. Dean and Cass had decided they would do one last circuit of the camp, keeping their eyes open and weapons ready in case some monster decided to attack. They had found a few signs but not enough yet to act on it. They would go out in the morning to hunt whatever it was.
The shortest of the lot, and there were a lot, looked to be around eight feet tall, shoulders built like a linebacker on steroids, powerful chest with pierced bleeding nipples. His arms long but hanging at different lengths, ending in seven fingered hands holding primitive clubs. Wide hips, which looked like they had broken and healed wrong, giving him a lopsided gate, legs thick enough to crush skulls with, tapering to hardened feet ending in long unkept nails which had something oozing from under them.
“Should we try doing this tomorrow? Maybe if we give him some time to get used to the idea it will help him?” She was honestly worried about the two.
“Sounds good, now see anything else to eat around here?” She was enjoying the lesson in finding plants to eat. She would never give up her coffee houses and bistros but there was something to be said for walking in the woods and picking a few berries every now and then.
She cackled delightedly at the thought, she was looking forward to the pain she was about to suffer, as she gave herself to her brother till she was full of his offspring. Standing he smiled evilly as he started to harden. Stroking himself he watched as his sister looked at him over her feathered shoulder. Her beak open as she panted in anticipation of her first breeding. She would carry her brother’s offspring with pride and honor, protect them with her life and raise them to be loyal to him and their parents. Her Mother would be so proud of what was about to happen to her. She couldn’t wait to tell her next time she saw her. Father would be ecstatic to finally have grandchildren to teach the fine art of corrupting innocent souls.
Which led to the other Angel who had come into his life at the same time. The one he really considered his brother and loved more than he thought was possible.
Dean continued to rub his mate’s back while Cass shuddered within his arms. He hated this, hated the idea of letting his hunter anywhere near Gabriel. But Dean was right, Gabriel was family, his family and the only one of his elder brothers who had always looked out for him. The only one of the four Archangels who had shown any love and affection towards him surprisingly  and he deserved to be saved. Dean wanted to give him the gift of a brother, as Cass had done for Dean many times over when he had saved Sam’s life. Now it was Dean’s turn to repay those deeds, but he couldn’t not without his permission. Dean needed him on board with what he wanted to do.
“Well, mine are dirty, and I didn’t feel like wearing them. So decided to change into something different.” He threw clothes at Dean, smirking when they hit him in the face. “Get dressed I need to feed you.”
Turning back to the Commander who had thrown the Consort out like so much garbage. “Where is she? I will explain to her what true honor is, it is not acceptable to simply toss our ward.”
Coughing blood, wiping his chin as best he could, the Archangel shook his head. “No, but I sent them away.” He rested his head on the strong chest he was getting way to used to leaning on. “Look Sam. I bought you some time, banished them, don’t know for how long. Solve the case.” His eyes closed and with a dramatic sigh passed out.
“I’m not sure, he’s been complaining a lot more lately about us being together. When we first mated, he was all over us being over each other. Now he seems more annoyed.” He looked at the door as if he could see his brother on the other side.
He easily found the old trail the panther told him about, how it would lead to an old den of his. There was fresh water and plenty of hunting in the area, they would supply his human with what he needed. While he hadn’t been pleased to be a messenger and trail guide, he realized he might have been harder on the man than he intended. The human had kept up despite his very physical needs, at least till the end. So he offered his apologies in the form of a place to rest and recover for both of them. Only he couldn’t go with them, the jungle was filled with a presence which made his fur crawl. It was driving out all the predators of the area, and only through the one who had sent him, was he able to come this far. If he went any further he would actually bring attention to the men. They were under another being’s protection, wouldn’t be detected for some time, for the pathway they had followed cloaked those who traveled through it. And there were multiple openings one could come out of from the main passage. So while they were anticipated from those who would do them ill, they didn’t know exactly where they would be coming out.
He took the room temperature water waiting in the glass, not wanting to shock his system after the warm soup with cold, and let him sip once more. Gabe managed twice then he was done for good. Sam helped resettle Gabriel in bed, tucking him in warmly, as he gazed down at his already closed eyes. The smile he sported mirrored the one the sick man was displaying slightly. Course the younger hunter did miss the part when he stroked his hand through Gabriel’s hair absently, concentrating so much on how just a few spoonfuls of soup and a bit of juice had done wonders for him. After making sure he was deeply asleep,  Sam took the dishes back to the kitchen to deal with later. Serving up another bowl of soup, grabbing another juice box, he made a side trip to the library to pick up another book. Supplies in hand he returned to Gabriel’s side, supremely content with how things were going so far.
Eyes still that odd shade of vibrating cobalt, “Hmm well I would like to order the Widower platter to begin with, the buffalo wings with DEATH Valley sauce, the ultimate heart attack burger and for desert…” he growled up at the man, making sure his message came across clearly. “An extra large slice for two of the chocolate mudslide cake.” He put his menu down, folding his hands neatly together and never broke eye contact with the now visibly shaking man. “Do you have ALL that?”
“No doubt little brother he will fail. For we are not able to be killed twice.” The Irish accent one assured him. His bright red eyes glowing with hell fire.
The priest cocked his head as he looked between the two, hearing the difference in accents and pronunciation. “¿Me das tu palabra de que estás aquí para ayudarnos?” (You give me your word you are here to help us?)
“We know Dean has self worth issues, I’ve tried to help him but you know him. Doesn’t talk about anything important. Cass though I think he is operating under the same premise. I heard him saying something about not being worthy of Dean.”
Standing where he was, he tried to argue with him, “Ah Dean we probably shouldn’t be flying, I’ve heard helicopters flying around the woods.”
Giving him a bitch face over his stating the obvious over and over and expecting a different answer. “I don’t know Dean. We will look into it. I promise.” Sam assured him, texting the witch to let her know the latest developments. And also to possibly not show up for a few days if she wanted to keep her skin intact.
Just as Dean was about to cut a line on his forearm, one pissed off Angel of the Lord howled his rage. Shocked Dean turned as he felt nothing but mindless rage and fear radiating from his mate. Castiel’s mind was buried in instincts so deep there was no conscious personality present. Dean staggered as he was overwhelmed as strong arms surrounded him, pinning his wings to his back. Dean only had about three-seconds before Castiel ran and he had to go to plan M and hope to hell it would work. Shouting as he tried to stall a frantic Angel for a few more precious moments. “Sam you’ll have have to finish it.” Then they were both gone, disappearing as Castiel teleported them far from the threat to his mate and own happiness.
“I’m sure he isn’t.” He pulled out his phone pretending to see if they had any service. Lifting it up he made sure to get the perfect shots and snapped off a few.
While he didn’t have much Grace left, he had enough within him for it to recognize many things. One that whatever was attacking Sam was the same being which had drained most of itself away from its Master. Two that there was a bond between its Master and the younger man, formed by his blood and soul. Three the creature was attacking the other man’s soul trying to break that bond and slowly succeeding. Four that this young man was very significant for its Master’s wellbeing, he was the other half of its Master’s own heart. Five the bond between them was not now, not ever going to be broken.
Sam eyebrows rising to his hairline, hair on his neck trying to reach the same place, was growing more alarmed. Mind working furiously as theories started to formulate. “What happened to them? Did they eventually get caught?”
When the light show died down, Sam opened his eyes once more. Spots danced in front of him, letting him know just how bright the colors truly had been. He rubbed at them, trying to get his eyes to focus once more. Finally getting them to behave, he directed his gaze to the Angel who still had his eyes closed. His face was, no his whole stance seemed to indicate he was busy absorbing something. What it was he was absorbing the younger Winchester wasn’t sure, probably the energy which had burst forth at his words of a week or two. Either way, Cass was looking so much better, so much more alive. As if he had been drained of all he was, and only just now as he being refilled.
“Get rid of them? How the hell do you get rid of them? Can you shoot them? How?” The people in the lobby, the staff were all surrounding him. Eyes desperate and scared over facing circumstances they had never had to face or even thought was real.
Afterward he had woken in a sweat, heart still beating quickly and the images of the dream quickly fading. The sensations though and the aftermath of those sensations had stayed, and he found himself getting up from the spare bed in Gabriel’s room to go get changed. Gathering up the clothes he made a pit stop to the laundry, threw what he needed in and started it up. He tried to remember what his dream had been about or even who, but nothing would come forth. Frowning, knowing it might be important where his dream came from, he stomped from the laundry towards the kitchen. Making breakfast he returned to Gabe’s room just as he was waking to feed him.
Shooting to his feet, he followed his hunter excitedly as he was led towards the garage. Finally they were going to do something interesting. He couldn’t wait to see what the outside looked liked and maybe could then persuade Sam to take him to a grocery store. He was completely out of candy and Sam had totally refused to buy him any. All he needed was money…
Trying to get in again, Dean failed once more as the tops of the wings prevented him from achieving his goal. Eyes growing as he realized what the problem was, he cursed out his anger. “Oh hell no, this is not happening.” Turning to Cass who was standing behind him, looking at him calmly. “Cass what the fuck? Tell me what to do here, cause I know you have wings and can get into the car just fine. Tell me how you do it so I can drive.” His eyes pleaded with Cass to give him the answer.
He did his best to keep the confusion out of his voice. “That the robbery appears to have started in the 1800s sir.” How in the hell that was possible he wasn’t sure. He was very new to the ranks and had never dealt with the Winchesters. He would soon learn how they seemed to attract the really weird shit in the world.
“More power now Dean, put some actual strength into your down sweeps.” Cass told him firmly, eyeing his wings critically. Already they had morphed to a more industrialist, steady, beaver dam tan.
Taking a deep breath, expelling it through his nose, the elder hunter tried to calm himself. Relaxing his shoulders, his wings dropped to a more normal position, instead of the mantling they wanted to do. “Yes, they’re real, no I don’t want to talk about it…”
Laughing Cass pulled Dean closer to finish hugging him before letting him go. “Sounds like a plan Dean. Come on we’ll get cleaned up and go find something to eat.” Standing he pulled out of his mate, touching his shoulder and healing him in a moment when he hissed in pain. Reaching his hand down he helped his hunter to stand. “Let’s go for a quick swim and get this muck off, then we need to find your pants.”
When the hell did he start thinking of Gabriel as HIS Angel? Hell he had just resolved to give him a chance. To simply get to know him and see if they could make a go of it. What had changed in the last 10 minutes to make him want to claim the little shit? Watching the road as he drove he thought hard, what had changed?
Well, that propelled everyone into moving. Dean grabbing his gun from the pack on the ground, Sam pulling a knife, while Cass pushed Charlie behind him, dropping his own Angel blade to his hand. Dean pulled his wings in tight, wanting to be able to move fast in case they were about to be attacked. The scratching came again, along with a very soft sound, almost like a cat’s meow.
As an Angel he could see things like this, though at the moment it was pretty foggy, being low on Grace tended to make it hard to read things. Still he could see that there was a lot of potential with Sam, potential he was very interested in pursing. He had multiple occasions to see how his mind worked over time, both recent and in the past. His soul was strong, which was good, but he could also tell it had been through a lot. And he hated to think of it this way, but he also couldn’t ignore it had seen its own share of corruption. It was pure now, but there was still shadows of ordeals experienced over the years. In this area he differed from Dean who as far as he had ever been able to tell, had never had his soul corrupted. Oh demons had tried, it had been close but Dean’s stubborn nature as a righteous man had protected it.
Pursing his lips, displeased with what he was seeing so far. “Go ahead and touch your nose with your eyes closed.” Frown deepening when he had no problem doing so.
Sam disconnected before falling back onto his pillow. Just what he needed right now. To be the sole babysitter to one sugar addicted annoying ass clown who hadn’t even woken yet. Still could be worse, he wasn’t exactly sure how, but he was sure it could be worse.
And everything would have been fine Dean was sure (yeah right), he would have gone on his way (no way in hell), and the creature would have gone it’s way (bullshit) if not for one thing.
Not giving them a chance to protest, he poured a salt line across the door way, closing the door behind him. Taking a deep breath he straightened his shoulders as what he was about to do settled within him. Taking on three vengeful spirits with a serious grudge against their older brother who imprisoned them. He wished Dean and Cass were here, It would make it so much easier to have back up. Pushing off from the wall, he headed down the hallway to look for the basement areas.
“I can’t stand it any more. I need to have you Dean, I need to feel you in me.” Before Dean could say anything more, his clothes were removed with a flick of the Angel’s wrist. He blinked as he found himself flat on his back, wings which he had forgotten all about, crushed under him. “Let me show you what it's like when an Angel makes love to his mate, Dean.” And oh how his heart sang as he finally was able to say those words out loud. The joy exploding in a rush of power and love as it prepared to claim and be claimed.
“It’s what we’ve noticed, though a few times when on jobs, Cass will go bonkers if Dean was hurt. Really blows shit up, exacting revenge, this last job when we found Gabriel was the worst. He was ready to take out an entire mountain range, luckily Dean managed to keep him contained. But since we found Gabe, Cass has really begun acting weird.” He opened the door trying to determine if the other two were on their way. Closing it he returned to his conversation. “Once Gabe was here, he refused to allow Dean to touch him, be near him, or have anything to do with him. He gets really agitated whenever the two are together and they haven’t been together more then maybe a couple times all told.”
“Hurry come with us, the Second Son and his Consort have entered their financial house. We need to get a quick report and then you must find Lord Good-fellow and report.”
“Ectoplasm, and a lot of it. These guys are super pissed off spirits. Damn it I wish Dean and Cass was here. Three at once is going to be a bitch to deal with.”
The manager came to his door and opened it quickly, stepping out of the way. “You can place him on the couch, then if you would be so kind as to tell us just what the hell is going on?” He demanded even as he pointed to his large leather couch.
Finally dick soft and behaving itself once more, Dean was able to respond. “Yeah Cass, I feel what you’re trying to show me.” And he did, he could feel how his chest, back, neck, shoulders and thighs were all engaging at different points on him.
Quick note aftermath of torture is mentioned here. I think its graphic description but others might not think of it as much. But its just what happened to Gabriel physically. It should only really happen in this chapter. But I'll warn for other chapters as they come up.
“Right.” Turning he strode out of the cave, looking down into Cass’s thankful eyes. Patting his shoulder he left to go find some much needed food for his brother.
‘Maybe I should so you can punish me later…’ Dean grinned as he felt the snarl come over their bond.
Naoko stopped suddenly, ears perked up growl rumbling from her throat. The men fanned out, reading weapons, holy water and salt for her lower half if they found it, or silver knives if they found the top half. Straining their ears, they just managed to make out the sounds of dogs in the distance.
‘Not now Cass we really don’t have time to deal with worth issues.’ Still he sent him a mix of love, devotion and lust towards his mate. Flying behind Castiel after all gave him a really great view of his ass.
He continued moving, blood still dripping from his deep laceration, but he ignored it in favor of finding the basement area. When he came across signs of the remodel he knew he was going to have to be more careful. These areas would be the ones to house the three brothers and the mayhem they were determined to cause.Turning the corner he stopped at the sight of all three waiting for him with malice glee.
Snapping his mouth shut, reassured of his place in their odd little family, he raised his hands to cover his head as Cass gave a shout and the mountain trembled. A flash of light and there was a large scraggly fissure being ripped open. When it was wide enough for a man to pass through Cass lowered his arm, swaying in place before Dean steadied him with a hand to his shoulder.
He held his palm out, concentrating his power in the center of it, he would have to aim carefully, for if he hit Dean it would kill him. But he would take no chance this beast would ever darken their lives again. Would take no chance the fiend would find some way of merging with another person’s lower half when she discovered her own was gone. He shook his head clearing his mind of all thoughts save one, the total and complete destruction of the monster. He would save his mate, take him home and make sure they didn’t leave till he had been properly claimed by his man.
The panther turned to look at them, ears perked forward, head cocked to the side as he studied the man slumped in Castiel’s arms. With a huff he lowered his head, stepped forward and rubbed himself against the Angel’s leg. He purred, chittered and gently growled a few last words before stepping away and melting into the jungle. Castiel called back to him, thanking him for what he had done for them. Then started walking, being careful of his steps as he carried his now sleeping mate through the heart of the jungle.
Dean had wrenched the door open, glaring at the 12 year old boy who could just barely reach the pedals AND see over the steering wheel. He threw the car into park, then let them have it. Chewing them out for a good 10 minutes about how uncool it was to steal another person’s car, (never-mind the fact he had no problem stealing cars), to possibly wrecking it by losing control of it, (ignoring the fact he had done that exact thing on more than one occasion) to possibly dying because they crashed it, (he had managed to steer clear of that one for the most part at least).
The Angel froze, trying to rein in his suddenly interested dick. He hadn’t expected to go from wishful thinking in the back of his mind, to practically weeping with despair, at not being allowed what he most wanted. Those feathers were even more luxurious than he had anticipated, some so soft he wanted to just rub his face in them. Others harder, stronger, ready to perform any type of maneuver in the air they might be called to execute. It figured the hunter’s feathers would reflect Dean’s personality so perfectly, he should have realized this sooner, before he touched those examples of truth. Hard on the outside, yet as you moved closer to the center, they became softer, gentler as if they knew the outer feathers would protect them from all harm.
The Angel was by his side in an instant, steadying him, even as he started sporting a wide gummy smile. “You did it Dean, you flew.” His wings were a jubilant tangelo orange.
Still some men, some brave souls dared to turn their weapons still on the menace before them. Unloading clip after clip to try and if not kill the enemy, at least slow him down so the others could retreat. Those National Guardsmen who had first showed up, shouted well ordered orders to each other, passing ammunition in well trained memory. Working to surround the being who even still was blowing away those trying to resist him. Helplessly ignoring how their fellow brothers and sisters were falling as a strange light or ruined metal disabled them. They had no time to call for back up, their duty was clear, protect their people from all enemies both foreign and domestic. The question was which did this Creature fall into?
To bad reality had to shoehorn itself into his mind, reminding him Dean wanted to get rid of those perfect attachments, to once again lock him to a life of being bound to the earth.
“I don’t know, it’s up to Dean and what he wants to do. If Cass is really stressed he might think of something else to try.”
Squeezing once more eyes growing devilish in the way which only turned Castiel on more. “No buddy, you're IN my ass, now start moving, you woke me up and you feel good.” Pushing back he encouraged his mate to take what was rightfully his.
Continuing down his broken and abused body, his shoulders were both dislocated and broken in multiple places. In fact as they took careful inventory they found each bone had been broken  multiple times. The noise the bones made while they ground against each other, as Sam tried to find Gabriel a more comfortable position, was like nails on a chalkboard. His arms and torso appeared to be ripped to shreds as if a hellhound had been using him for a chew toy. Even some of his fingers were missing.
The ventilation system decided to belch out another ball of rainbow dust. Blowing all sorts of fairy guts through the room. Which was another annoying disaster he would have to deal with. The way the breeze just spread the shit all over, coating every surface, including himself. He always ended up sneezing at least twice, coughing a dozen times as he breathed it all in. Dean figured it couldn’t possibly be healthy, just how much of those big nipple freaks remains he was taking into his lungs. And they still hadn’t figured out about those god damn fairies at the larping event. They had disappeared their first night there, their horses included much to the dismay of many of the people. They had liked seeing the pretty creatures around.
“Sam if you wish I could try and keep my volume low as we have intercourse…” The Angel offered with reasonable tones, his face calm and quiet.
Sam looked at the old highway sign which stated they were about 10 miles from Magnificent Michigan, population 2137. Another town wishing to be bigger and more impressive than it ever would be, but hey it was the thought that counted. Checking the rear view mirror he could see Dean still sleeping in the back, tan overcoat laid over him for a blanket. Cass had placed it over him once he was down and out, before following his example with his own nap. Who knew how busy they would be once they started working, so it wasn’t hard to take over the driving so the other two could get some shut eye. He had slept a good portion of the way here once they had left the cops behind.
“Now, now little one, you won’t be getting off that easily. There are so many more things we will do to you before we kill you. Now come, it’s getting late and I have much to plan.” Snapping his fingers again, he yanked the creature with his power, heading down to the play rooms. He was looking forward to some quality time as he waited for his sister and other siblings to return.
Sam gripping his wrist and hauling him up. “We’re going to the cave Naoko is showing us to. From there we stay put while we form up a plan.” As if they hadn’t just said this.
Cass was standing at the entrance to the cave, just out of sight of anyone who might come by. Senses alert and ready to subtly try and push them away. Not that he actually thought anyone would come out here. It had been a massive chore to reach this remote location, and it would be an even bigger chore when they returned in a few hours. The place afforded them some much needed recovery time for which he was grateful, because Dean needed it. He wasn’t in good shape no matter how much he said he was fine. Castiel could feel how the man was struggling to maintain his composure considering how hungry he was. His hunter needed food, all the food he had eaten earlier had gone to the damn chick growing in his belly, when he burned the creature out of his system it had taken the food with it. But he would not let any part of that tainted monster to stay in Dean’s system.
Shutting off the water, he opened the curtain and grabbed the blue towel wrapping his hair in it, he took the other, a green one, and wrapped it around his waist. Going to the sink he brushed his teeth, gargled before finally tackling his hair. Taking the towel off, he hung it up, then reached for the complimentary hair dryer. He spent a good 15 minutes drying and brushing it out before he was satisfied it was dry enough. Leaving the bathroom he frowned as he still hadn’t heard anything from the other room and he should have by now. Worried he quickly dressed in jeans, button down with over jacket and his heavy duty hiking boots.
Giving three final pumps of his straining wings, he flipped himself upside down, Angel blade held before him to cut the air stream. He dived towards the bitch who was struggling to reach him, mouth filled with sharpened teeth screeching at him. Dean closed his wings tight to his body, making himself more streamlined, increasing his acceleration till the very wind screamed by his ears. He aimed for the half woman, eyes watering from the speed he was achieving, bracing himself for impact.
“They showed up soon after we left to chase the monster Dean. You had taken to the sky to battle it, so Sam had to borrow a motorbike to follow you. Someone called them in regard to the lady you saved.”
Cass rotating his shoulders, flinched as he realized Dean was right. He must have seriously been fighting the storm to have pulled muscles like he evidently had. He could feel his wings were not pleased and the idea of Dean grooming and massaging them was sounding really good.
Charlie scratching her friend, cocked her head, “They’re still going after you, and people are leaving. I seriously doubt they won’t find you if you stay here. This tent is hidden but won’t be in the daylight. And it wasn’t here when they looked the first time. I’m sure they would check it out again.”
Before Cass could say anything, Sam spoke up. “We were trying to reduce the pain he was in. Last few weeks, with all the crap we’ve been asking of him, he’s been using what mobility is left in his wings, to come to us. Found him shaking in his room a week ago, sweating and groaning in pain. I dragged it out of him when I caught him trying to hide it.” Sam explained carefully keeping his eyes away from Cass, who was now glaring at him. Secretly Sam was very pleased with himself. Nothing got Dean riled up more then finding out Cass got hurt or was in pain and hadn’t told him. Very protective of his Angel, even if he didn’t want to admit it. The younger Winchester smirked to himself, pleased to goad his brother into growing closer to Cass.
Nope the seating situation was better this way, less dangerous all around in the long run. What was nice was having a third driver for those times when Sam was to tired to drive and Dean exhausted to the point he couldn’t keep his eyes open. Cass could take over and drive till there was no gas in the car, needing little sleep if he had to. He would pay for it later, but he could make do with no sleep for days if pushed. Course Dean would never allow him to push himself that hard just for a drive.
The cops this time had their weapons out and were taking aim. But he wasn’t built like a falcon for nothing. Closing his wings in tight he came in low, skimming just above their heads, grinning as he snatched a few hats and blew others off heads. A few managed to get shots off but his speed saved him, missing him and his cinnamon wings. Rising up once more he spun to make another pass.
It was a nightmare and for roughly 18 hours they drove straight through, if he could have flown he would have. But he didn’t know how to yet, hadn’t managed to do much more than hover for a few minutes. Which took a hell of a lot of energy out of him, the speed of the wing beats insane. But he was getting his exercise at least, his pudge in his middle was mostly gone. Replaced with full body aches as he became used to working new muscles. Cass had been an asshole too when teaching him, not allowing him to rest till he had accomplished whatever task he had decided Dean needed to.
He surveyed the area as he walked, senses open wide and alert to danger. He would not fail his mate again, not where it came to his safety. But he found the area clean and clear of danger. He could hear birds singing, unseen around him. Insects going about their business as larger predators snacked on them with pleasure. Finding the rocks he wished, he collected a couple dozen before returning to the den. Thanks to Dean and Sam’s teachings he was very good at starting campfires now, without having to use his Grace constantly to keep warm. Placing them in a circle near the entrance, he then went out and collected as much dry brush and branches that he could. He wanted his mate to be warm and Dean would be pleased to know he used fire instead of power to do so.
