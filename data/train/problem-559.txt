“What?” Sherlock frowns. Did he miss a clue?
‘Let Her Go’ by Passenger.
“Your roomie is out, I suppose?”
“I never sleep in pajamas.”
Sherlock starts pacing across the hotel room.
John moves to the side of the table, gently pressing his thumbs into Sherlock’s shoulders. Seeing those scars makes his heart ache, makes him want to go punch a wall. But he channels that energy into soft, circular motions instead. He localises knotted areas, like reading a book written in braille. God, Sherlock really is very stressed.
John, meanwhile, has been feeling the desire to stab people himself. He’s been dressed and redressed by noisy costume designers firing off comments like “we want your boots to fit your personality”, “just be you but with a V-shaped neckline” and “seriously you were in the closet for ages and these are the clothes you pick?”
“Wiggins... was your inside man?”
. A tiny, black, shiny gun, in Irene Adler’s hand.
what John sees?
Next to the insulted queen, a man starts moving - about as botoxed as Sharon, but most of it in the lips.
"Miss A'Keria is the body" is a lyric from the RuPaul song 'Queens Everywhere' (s11 version) :)
“Jinkx, you shock me,” Dimmock says.
If there are guns, however, they’re equally helpless.
“How’s your French, brother mine?”
“I wouldn’t! Literally. I’m a new man,” Alaska says.
“Come off it! That sounds like our everyday life!” John unclenches his fist. He doesn’t mean to shout. “I… could have helped you.”
“You’ll need more than a cock laser,” Sherlock says. But he can’t fully hide the fear in his eyes, the wriggle of his hands in the ropes.
“A mannequin.”
The 'Bond case' really gets started, it's glorious and fun, and John can't believe his luck. Or are the cards stacked against them?
“Shut up,” Moriarty sings. “Please, sit down and enjoy the show.”
He can’t -
No - he’d long abandoned the silly fantasies that Sherlock had faked his death. John had seen the blood, felt his pulse.
Then, he looks behind him, and startles. Where Moriarty’s body should be lying, there’s only a pool of blood left.
Now though, he didn’t want to disturb his slumbering mate, sleep was a rare commodity for his detective and now that things had settled and John had made it clear he was to catch up on some much needed sleep, but John was in need himself.  In
Sherlock had flipped through the sizable notebook trying to think of one reason to read.  He wasn’t even looking at the words, rather the dates and the further back the journal he got, the worst thing happened, for 3 weeks nothing, the fourth was
John took the coat as Sherlock stood and rose with him.  He helped the taller man slip into the coat and the smile that lit up Sherlock’s face had been well worth the wait.
Sherlock had spent the longest time fretting over what to wear.  This was the first time they’d be dining out together since John’s return to Baker Street now that the media fascination surrounding them had finally died down.  Early on they had been out several times and it had been terrible, reporters asking intrusive questions about the Reichenbach Fall and Sherlock’s miraculous return from the grave and John’s willingness to forgive him, all while shoving cameras in their faces but what surprised Sherlock is that while John had been livid, he just took Sherlock by the hand and removed them from the situation before things got uglier.  They still hadn’t discussed anything regarding that time spent apart and Sherlock had thought for sure this was it, but when they had finally gotten back to Baker Street and Sherlock waited for John’s wrath to rain down on him, John pulled him into a hug and apologised for having to go through that.  They ordered take away from that point on.  It was that day that Sherlock had realised John really had forgiven him and that he wasn’t going to leave and he liked this new facet of their relationship that was forming.  They rarely fought anymore, when they did disagree, eventually at some point they would talk things out.  He finally chose the deep purple dress shirt (John’s favourite) and his best black suit and quietly waited in the sitting room for John to join him.
“I’ve known for a while now John, I’ve just been waiting for you to make the first move because I didn’t want to push you or rush you into anything.  I want this to be forever, seeing as how I’ve loved you for quite some time.”
Sherlock paused, “Too much?”
“W-w-wanted to see if it was w-w-worth it before wasting our t-t-time.” He stuttered.
Sherlock smiled, “I’ve already ordered us dinner, now why don’t you pick some crap telly we can watch and tomorrow we can work on your flat.  We’ve made enough strides for one day, don’t want to overdo it.”
John groaned as his eyes slid shut, hand running down his stomach to his groin, palming himself through his pyjama bottoms.  He shivered at the contact, he really shouldn’t. He should wait for Sherlock, but that could be God knows how long and he was so hard.
“Yes, everything’s fine.  More than fine actually.” John announced.
“Tell me what to do, watch me…” John whimpered
“John, I have a confession, I did that on purpose.  Nothing bad is going to happen I just wanted to move things along a little faster.”
John cleared his throat, “does that mean you’re done with us now?”
Sherlock watched as John tore the paper off the box and pulled the lid off, revealing a gorgeous light blue cashmere jumper.  Much nicer than the plain woolen ones John usually wore.  John was speechless.
“I promise John.” Sherlock murmured, arranging his arms to comfortably hold John.  Now that he had him in his arms, he didn’t plan on leaving him go ever.
She apologised for having the party against my wishes, that she should have listened to me.  She hadn’t realised how cruel other children actually were, not when she had been blessed with two brilliant children herself.  She went on to explain that she thought by inviting the children into our home for a celebration, it would help them see how we actually were, she didn’t realise that these were not the type of people you could reason with.  She was only trying to help because she thought I was lonely which is why we were now headed to her friend’s estate.  I remember groaning because I thought this meant she was going to try and get me to socialise with other children but was shocked to see that when we arrived at the estate, there was a large kennel on the grounds. Her friend was a well-known dog breeder and apparently there were several litters that had puppies available.  When we walked into the kennel she leaned down and told me to go choose a puppy as my birthday present, that I had needed a friend and this seemed the most logical solution because she knew I adored the neighbour’s dog.
“Oh God yes. Yours or mine.”
“I can hear you thinking,” came the voice, still thick with sleep.
“John, you did seem happy, but why did you hide it?  I noticed the change at the reception when I told you Mary was pregnant, you didn’t even look at her, you fixed your eyes on me and that’s when I knew, but you still can’t admit it.”
When they reached the bedroom, Sherlock asked John to strip down to what he was comfortable with but explained he was going to be using some oil and didn’t want to accidentally ruin any of his clothes.  I am going to get some towels and the warming oil and use that.
“Sherlock,” she put his hand on his arm, “you’ve no reason to butter me up.  Of course, I’ll sit with Rosie so you and John can get things sorted more quickly.  Besides moving and packing is no place for a baby.  It will render one of you useless as you’d have to hold her the entire time.”
Sherlock turned on his side and looked at John. “What’s bothering you?”
As soon as Sherlock was out of earshot, Lestrade turned to the pair, “Who’s up for a beer?”
And it continued that way for the next five months, but as things were wont to do, eventually it did start to wear on John and he did find himself missing Sherlock.  John found himself sitting in the small café one dreary Wednesday midday in March.  It had been slow and Sarah told him to take the rest of the day to go home and rest up, he had looked like he needed it.  Truth was, he did – not that he would admit to it, but the last five months had been a bit of mind fuck.  Also there was the small fact that where he lived now, a small bedsit (still) was not the home he desired to retreat to even though he swore he was not going to give in that easily to one Sherlock Holmes.
John noticed Sherlock’s pace becoming more erratic. He knew what to expect, he waited, 5,4,3,2,1…(almost as if on cue)
Sherlock opened his eyes, catching John’s deep blue ones, his own sparkling with curiosity and the realization of wasted time.  “You wouldn’t have been mad?”
He closed his eyes and sighed as John’s almost illegible scrawl invaded his thoughts, John’s voice whispering in his ear as though he was sitting there lamenting over the choices he had made.
It had taken the half hour John had endured to arrive home for Sherlock to slip bead nine and ten in and when John called as he walked through the door, he was surprised at the undignified squeak Sherlock answered him with.  John raced back to the bed room.
Sherlock had left them to instruct the workers what to do next, he had them pack John’s things and then had them pack all of Mary’s things separately and the kitchen cleaned out, ready to go to the consignment.
Thank you for reading and as always comments and kudos are appreciated.
“John, focus on the head, short strokes,” Sherlock ordered.  John obeyed, letting his eyes slide shut again, listening to Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock’s eyes slid shut and he groaned as he began to come all over his stomach and John’s hand.
“John, four days now! Ninety-six hours and counting. I NEED a case John. Something, anything. I don’t even care how mundane. I can feel my brain decaying.” Sherlock wailed. “I’m BORED!”
He didn’t bother being gentle, he knew exactly what Sherlock wanted.  He started out fast and hard and was pleased at the response of Sherlock’s moans and begs. He pulled his hips up and brushed across his prostate twice and Sherlock’s body was jerking, strings of come pulsing from his untouched cock.
Well this is a complete change. John thought. Ten minutes ago he was bouncing off the walls and now he’s almost completely shut down and drawing into himself. Well not now if I have anything to say about it.
He deepened their kiss as his fingers trailed across Sherlock's plush arse and between his cheeks, teasing gently. He made several light passes across Sherlock's hole, letting him get used to the feeling, while getting used to the feel himself.
This was not the answer John thought he would get back so he decided to be open and honest as well.  “Sherlock, I have a confession to make, for a long time now, so have I.”
Okay, so maybe it wasn’t an accident.
“Mmmm, really?”  John asked, not buying that Sherlock hadn’t been asleep.  “And why were you waiting for me to wake?  Normally, you have no problems making your desires known.”
“Would you like some tea and toast?”
He was ready, he grabbed the lube and smeared a good bit across the first few beads and his fingers.  He began with his fingers, teasing himself open while taking deep breaths and imaging it was John. Once he felt lose enough, the first three of the ten beads popped in easily.  They weren’t uncomfortable, they just felt weird and it took a bit of getting used to.  The fourth and fifth bead took longer to ease in and a considerable amount of lube.
“I should certainly think so.” John said as he turned and put his coat on then retrieving Sherlock’s and holding it out for him to slip into.  John then did something unexpected, he took Sherlock’s hand, laced their fingers together and led them down the stairs and outside into the evening.
Sherlock could barely talk as John’s fingers ran down the entire length of the underside his cock until he reached his balls and he began to roll and massage each one.
“You really were serious.”
He advised Lestrade and the team he was bringing – Anderson and Donovon - to do the same and Lestrade laughed and said, “Come on Sherlock, there will be rooms open in some of the hotels, I’m sure of it.”
John smiled wickedly, “I like the way you think,” John kissed his neck and searched the bed for the lube, in the end Sherlock found it and John kept it close by because he was going to take his time getting Sherlock ready.
John coughed; she was right it was barely used in the scheme of things.  After Mary’s death, after he forgave Sherlock, he had spent nearly every moment at Baker Street that he could.  He couldn’t bear being away from Sherlock.
“Shut up Sherlock!” John cut him off before he could finish that thought. What the hell was going on here? Sherlock
“And if he says no?”
Sherlock rumbled, “please John. I need more.”
“Yes John, faster.  Come on, show me what you’d do to me if I was on top of you, how you’d make me beg, plead for it.  God John I want it. Come for me.”
“Please what John?” Sherlock demanded.
“John, don’t worry, I think everything will be fine. For Christ’s sake, you’re a doctor so I would imagine you have some practical knowledge of what you’re about to do.”
John pulled his lips back, looked up and smirked at Sherlock. “Oh you haven’t seen anything yet.”  As he journeyed downward, licking and nipping wherever he pleased, until he reached Sherlock’s hips placing a reverent kiss on each hip bone and spreading Sherlock’s legs apart further.  He moved the lube closer but made no move to open it yet, instead he placed his lips around the tip of Sherlock’s cock and tongued at the slit.
“Shh, go back to sleep,” John whispered.
‘My John,’ another soft kiss to his lips, ‘my entire world.’
Sherlock had to try and keep from smirking but he was tired of waiting for things to progress.  Since that night they had slept together in Sherlock’s bed, it had happened a few more times and Sherlock knew how he felt and he was sure he knew how John felt, he just needed to help things progress along to the next step.
It wasn’t long until they were going over the list of what to do in an emergency with Rosie when Mrs. Hudson practically shoed them out the door.  “Really boys, I’ve taken care of babies before and everything turned out fine.  Now off you get and have a good time.  Rosie and I will be fine and I promise to call if we aren’t.”
He smiled his sleepy smile, the one that melts Sherlock’s heart and answers, “I wouldn’t have ask if I didn’t mean it.  Please.”
“Why’s that Sherlock?”
Sherlock thought this was a crazy idea, but then he did like crazy although he didn’t know if after he could go back to normal after something like this.
“Take your time,” John whispered, “I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”
“Fucking hell John!  This might be over before it begins.”
, he wanted to come home, he wanted to find out, he wanted to throw caution to the wind and find out once and for all.
The case started in an antique bookshop and appeared to be a robbery/murder.  Of course it’s never that simple when Lestrade resorted to calling Sherlock in and soon John and Sherlock were traipsing all over London like old times, though something seemed to be off.  Sherlock seemed to be having trouble concentrating and John chalked it up to the four months without participating in any cases.
“I know.” John smirked.
As luck would have it John Watson was standing on the stoop of 221b with his key out, deciding whether to go in.  Maybe Sherlock wasn’t home.  Maybe he was doing some shopping at Tesco’s, or out on a case with Lestrade – working would be good for him, or worst case scenario – maybe he had moved on and there was no room for John Watson in his life.  It had been four months and just as Sherlock had promised, no calls, no texts, no letters and to be honest that hurt John the most out of everything.  He forgave him for missing the clues about Mary, he had just come back from Serbia and was suffering through shock and John’s anger and Mary seeming to be an ally to Sherlock.
“It was coincidence really, well maybe a subconscious choice when I ordered them a week ago, but as far as the case goes, it’s simple, the girl, being the only one had the key, removed it and took it with her. I texted Lestrade its most likely whereabouts and thought I’d try these out instead of shooting the wall.”
John met his eyes, “you have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.  He leaned in again, this time sliding their lips together, keeping the kiss relatively chaste, but more than just a brush.  He heard Sherlock whimper and smiled against those irresistible lips.
It wasn’t often he’d gotten like this but when he saw the picture of the jewel today, it made him remember the set of beads he purchased and he couldn’t think of a better time now than to try them.
“What?” Sherlock asked when he finally realised something important had occurred to John.
“Ah, John, more.”
“John, John, if you… if… oh Jooohhhhnnn,” Sherlock couldn’t even string together what he was trying to say. All he could do was buck his hips erratically so John moved one hand to Sherlock's hip to still him and the other hand he maneuvered to massage Sherlock’s tightening ball sack while he continued suck for all he was worth. John eventually let his fingers drop back to tease Sherlock’s perineum.  He began massaging in a circular motion at first and when he noticed Sherlock arching his back and moaning a little louder, he swallowed him whole, and pressed hard on the skin. Sherlock could no longer contain it, he bucked his hips one last time and stilled. John felt the warm spurts coating his throat. When he was sure he’d swallowed every last drop, he found Sherlock’s lips again and licked at them playful and then kissed him. Sherlock was lying there still dazed from his orgasm. John lay on his side now brushing the errant curls off Sherlock’s forehead.
As always kudos and comments are very much appreciated and welcomed.
John did the only thing he could think of. He put his finger over Sherlock’s lips and shushed him. “Shh...Now look you. I am not going anywhere. I think that would be quite obvious after the way I just kissed you. And no I am not having a midlife crisis or any other bloody scenario you could come up with to counter what that kiss meant. The truth is Sherlock, I have been in love with you for quite sometime now.”
Yes, John had been hurt.  Hurt to the core of his existence and the day Sherlock returned, he stood there thinking this was some sort of sick joke.  Sherlock had come to the clinic hoping there wouldn’t be a scene and there wasn’t one.  John had just looked at him astounded and said very little.  What he did say shook Sherlock badly, John told him in no uncertain terms to stay away from him, he was done with him forever and then John simply walked out of the clinic and back to his bedsit without another word.  He was amazed he hadn’t reached out to strangle or punch Sherlock, he couldn’t do that to Sarah, not in the place he worked, not if he expected to keep the job he so desperately needed.
“Sherlock I’m sorry for everything.  I want to come home.  Do you think that’s possible?”
“Certainly boys,” and with that Angelo was heading back to the kitchen to place their order.
John thrust three more times erratically until he stilled and spilled deep into Sherlock and slumping on top of him.  He chuckled.  “Do not think it eludes me that those beads happen to be the same colour of that damn gem you were asked about this morning,”
John looked at Mycroft in disbelief, he clenched his fist which was sitting in his lap.  He could feel the anger boiling right below the surface.  It was smart of Mycroft to corner him here in this café.  He took several grounding breathes before he spoke and when he did, his tone was clipped and words concise.
The boys go on their dinner date, what do they figure out?
“You’re quite right…Oh god, please more.”
Sherlock sighed and John rolled his eyes thinking here we go.
“How long?” John managed to stutter.
“How did you know?”
“John scooted down in the bed so it was more comfortable for them both and he replied “Deal, as long as I get to was your body.”
John thought, causing him to chuckle. John kept his mouth shut though. He knew anything he could offer right now would only exacerbate the situation. As long as John had known Sherlock, this should not surprise him. When things got slow, Sherlock would become increasingly mad. If he was
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock let his head drop to rest on John’s forehead. “This is so much better than I ever dreamed, you’re so big and you fill me up, I’ve never felt anything like this before.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He then slipped out of the restaurant and wondered aimlessly.  He didn’t feel like going back to Baker Street, he didn’t really want to see Sherlock or be reminded of how lonely and foolish he was if Sherlock wasn’t there so he just walked.  He had no one to call either as it was New Year’s Eve and everyone was most likely involved in their own festivities and John didn’t want to intrude.  So he kept walking.  When he finally got too cold he decided it was time to call it a night and he took a cab back to Baker Street.  It had been over three hours and the new year had come and gone already and he was alone yet again.  Maybe this is how it was always destined to be for him.
“You can move into my room,” Sherlock blurted out without any pretense of warning.
“You think she’ll agree, she just did have Rosie last night?” John asked skeptically.
“Then it’s ok, with me,” he said smiling.   “Tea’s done, back in a sec.”
She clapped her hands together and gurgled happily at Sherlock and John was struck at the change in the pair of them, Sherlock being so helpful with Rosie and Rosie, not the cranky infant she used to be.  Things had definitely changed for the better in the last two months.  He continued pretending he was sleeping and it wasn’t until Sherlock sat down on the sofa with Rosie feeding her, that he finally stirred, pretending to wake for the first time.
“I couldn’t, it was yours, private and I made promises to myself about snooping on you anymore which is why I’ve not texted or called you all these months.”
“How can I refuse that?” he asked, crawling onto the bed and mouthing at Sherlock’s flushed cock while pulling at the ring simultaneously.
There had been moments here of late where a lingering touch lasted a bit too long or he’d catch John staring at him, but he was usually holding Rosie.  He was just unsure and it was like Mrs. Hudson said, John was here every single day when the time afforded, why would he do that if something wasn’t happening between them?  He would have to think about this some more and rationalize if the risk was worth taking.
The next time was when they were sitting in a tea room chatting with the prime suspect on the case they were working.  John had thought maybe Sherlock had added the touch of silver to make himself more endearing to the older lady they were now chatting up.
He put his key in the lock and opened the door.  Sherlock, too lost in his misery never heard the steps on the stairs and when John opened the door to the flat, his heart fell to his stomach.
John began clearing the table as Sherlock knocked on Mrs. Hudson’s door.  She greeted him and asked him if he’d like a cup of coffee and was glad to see that Rosie and John spending the night worked out splendidly.
You and I together had been something I had always dreamed of happening and it felt good.  Ever since Christmas, I felt things change, if I am honest, it was before that though I didn’t know that’s what was happening at the time.  It felt right and it felt natural and then you got personal and I was reminded by past events why this could never work and why you are so much better off without me.  I should have never returned or more importantly, I should have respected your first wishes of leaving you alone forever, than to put you in this position where I have once again hurt you.
Sherlock grinned, “Doctor Watson, are you asking me to bed?” Sherlock said teasingly.
It was dark when John’s eyes blinked open, he’d been having the most sensual dream about Sherlock and was a bit disoriented and very aroused when he awoke.  He was definitely naked, on his back and there was one consulting detective draped over him.  Then everything that had taken place earlier came flooding back and John realized this wasn’t a dream, this was real.  John was now wide awake and couldn’t help but gently rub his fingertips along Sherlock’s arm.  Sherlock shifted a bit and John hushed him, trying to let him sleep since it was something Sherlock rarely seemed to do lately.  Even though they’d been sharing a bed now for a few nights, John would blink his eyes open only to find Sherlock gazing at him in awe, memorising every detail.
Sherlock had packed their SUV with all kind of camping gear and enough food for up to a week.  He knew what they could possibly be in for heading up to the new case they had in Grantchester, Cambridge.
Rosie finished her bottle and Sherlock burped her and then set her in her play pen and surrounded her with her favourite toys.  Satisfied that she was settled, he moved to the kitchen and got out the eggs and the rest of the ingredients for a fry up.  Sherlock was in the middle of cooking when he felt arms around his waist.
John had known from the moment he suggested dinner what he was going to wear, the jumper Sherlock had gifted him for Christmas.  The very jumper he told Sherlock he would save for special occasions and this definitely qualified as that.  He was hoping tonight could be the moment that took their evolving relationship to the next level.  He wanted it all and he was certain Sherlock felt the same now.  He was no longer haunted by dreams where Sherlock rebuffed his advances or threw him out of the flat when he finally admitted his love for Sherlock.  John was sure things were different now and it was that text that Sherlock had sent him right after he jumped – the one that John was never meant to read - that allowed John to see how he really felt.  But This was important and could not be rushed because he needed to show Sherlock he was serious about this – about them, that this was not just a relationship born out of need or convenience.
By this time, John had returned with their tea and set it on the coffee table and took Rosie from Sherlock, giving her a great big hug and kiss.  “What time did you want to go?”
The first time they slept in the same bed wasn’t quite an accident…
"Can you..." John was asking as he heard the wrapper of the condom ripping. One of the good things about your boyfriend being a genius, he could be one step ahead of you and this was one time John really didn't mind.
John almost loses it right then and there, Sherlock’s pleading with him, asking him for the most intimate of things and John doesn’t intend on disappointing. He leans down kissing the inside of Sherlock’s left knee and the licks all the way up the inside of his thigh to where his leg joins his body. He nuzzles the skin there momentarily with his nose before tentatively licking the soft skin behind his sack, pulling the most lurid moan he’s heard from Sherlock yet, but he doesn’t stop there. No. He licks upward and draws one ball into his mouth, gently rolling it on his tongue and then he does the same to the other before licking him from the base of his cock to the very tip with the broad of his tongue.
He poured some liquid on his hands and warmed it in his fingers and began to earnestly knead his back muscles, staying away for the gunshot wound on his shoulder, he’d always wanted to expect it closer but now was not the time.  He worked slowly on his neck, on each vertebrae and then along each shoulder and down John's back being ever so gentle and reveling in the sighs and the little moans that escaped John’s mouth when he worked through a particularly rough patch of tension.
They’d been playing this cat and mouse game for weeks now. John was attracted to Sherlock, but was still in denial about it. Sherlock, well that was a different story. Sherlock had realised his feelings for his flatmate after their encounter at the pool with Moriarty. At first he was having trouble coming to terms with them, but now, all he wanted was John. John was becoming his everything, intruding his every thought. That was disturbing. He spent years banishing the need for any kind of emotions. Emotions and feelings made you weak - vulnerable. However with John, that wasn’t the case. It didn’t make him feel weak. In fact, just the opposite. It made him feel even more capable and strong. He also became very protective of John. If only he could convey this to John, maybe that would make John see that… well that was absurd really, seeing as how John like to constantly remind everyone and anyone who would listen that he was most certainly
When John closed the door, Sherlock asked if he’d like some tea since it was still rather early.
Sherlock’s hands clutched at his forearms, pulling him back close.  “Don’t go.” Sherlock all but begged as he wrapped his long, lean legs around John’s waist, locking him there on top of him.  He took and guided John’s right hand back to his hair. “I want you to do whatever you like to me.  I don’t want you to be gentle.  I want you to pull my hair, make me beg, push me to the edge again and again until I
“Good God, you amazing man.” Sherlock breathed out in a state of bliss as he came down.
“Yes, I don’t quite feel like cooking, do you?”
“Six sounds good to me.  Would you mind if I went home and showered and changed too?’
“It doesn’t bother you?” Sherlock whispered?
“God Sherlock, you feel so tight and hot.”
“Because I didn’t want to be rude and wake you last night when I finally came to bed.  I wanted you, but you were fast asleep and well… I do recall you telling me not to wake you and to go straight to bed because I needed to catch up on my sleep as well.” Sherlock’s voice trailed off as John inched closer.
of Sherlock.  He had never really quite understood how or why Sherlock found the addition of the silver in his own blond strands, but now he was beginning to comprehend it.  Sherlock’s hair had been slicked back and the curls tamed, must have been a fancy dinner then, he lifted his head and saw the tux draped over the back or the chair, Sherlock must have been too tired to even put it away.  Shame John hadn’t seen him all dressed up, on second thought, it was probably a good idea, neither of them would have made it to their intended destinations.
John swiped his tongue over the shell of Sherlock’s ear, “oh, I’m quite impressed then. Not a peep from Mycroft all night. That must mean you were a perfect angel, a reward is order then I do believe.”
Sherlock turned back to the stove top and picked up the spatula and finished cooking their breakfast.  He evenly dished out the food onto two plates and placed them on the table.
Just as their lips were about to meet, they paused, catching each other’s eye and staring. They both felt nervous and they could read it off each other, but they both felt safe because they were together, they were with each other and they knew nothing would happen that the other didn’t want.
At this point, John was half tempted to text Lestrade and curse at him for the lack of cases. However, that would be bad manners on John’s part because he knew it was not Lestrade’s fault. He grimaced and shut his laptop, pinching the bridge of his nose. He knew he was going to regret this.
Sherlock claimed John’s mouth and murmured “yes, yes, yes.” Over and over again before he started moving to his earlobe and licked the shell, “I’m going to make you feel so good, make all of our fantasies come true.”
” Sherlock mouthed in the way that always turned John on.
“Lovely!” he said clapping his hands together bit as he turned, he noticed John frowning.
“Now John, I need it and so do you.” Sherlock panted.
John stuck his head around the corner and looked at Sherlock.  “That sounds like a fine idea, as long as Mrs. Hudson doesn’t mind.”
He rummaged for the lube in the night stand, then exhaled slowly as he poured some in his palm warming it before lifting his hips and tugging his bottoms and pants off in one go.
John made Rosie’s bottle while Sherlock got her dressed for bed.  John brought the bottle upstairs and Sherlock sat in her rocking chair and began to feed her and gently rock the chair.  John stood by the door watching them, the sight made his heart swell.  He wondered how he got so lucky.
, just please!”
“Oh God,” was the first rumble out of Sherlock’s mouth, low and needy, as his back arched.
John had heard enough. He led Sherlock over to his chair and made him sit, so he could not escape the conversation that needed to take place before this went any further. He needed to be sure. He knelt in front of Sherlock whose head was hanging to avoid eye contact at any cost.
“Indeed not.” He put his hand behind John’s neck and pulled him forward and whispered in his ear with that velvet voice, “I do believe it is time to take proper care of my doctor.”
“There was even enough left over to start a bank account for Rosie.”
“Even though we haven’t done much more than hold hands, hug, and share the same bed at night?”
When Sherlock had returned home to Baker Street at the end of October 2015, almost two and a half years after jumping from the roof of St Bart’s, he expected to find John.  Instead what he found was an empty flat, basically the same as they had left it that day minus some of John’s personal belongings – his favourite coffee mug, his clothing and his laptop.  Everything else had remained as it had been that day in June.  At first it had puzzled Sherlock, why would John leave his home?  Perhaps Mycroft had been right all along.  Sherlock had gone too far this time by not trusting John or confiding in him his plans on dealing with Moriarty.
“Long enough to know this is where we both belong, now kiss me and let’s rest before that shower.”
“Of course I’m sure. What part of me trying to get you out of your clothing indicates that I don’t want this? I realise things are going to change, but most things will stay the same I imagine.”
The simplest, truest statement Sherlock had ever spoken, because they belonged together, no matter what else in the world was happening, John and Sherlock belonged together.
They both raised their hand as Lestrade went over and grabbed a bag and one of the cases of beer.  It didn’t take long before they became loud and raucous recounting stories of murder scenes that Sherlock had never been a part of. This went on for almost an hour.
John blushed again and said thank you, he knew it would be useless to argue this point.  Sherlock adored Rosie and John was glad for it.
John craned his neck and looked up from his current position which was right above Sherlock’s left nipple and chuckled, “Sherlock, is that all you have because I can stop?  Go have a shower and then breakfast,” and he began to push himself up off the bed.
“Is everything ok John?”
John blushed, “kissing you.”
“No, why should it?  I’m quite confident and secure in my relationship with you.”
John couldn’t believe his ears, Sherlock had changed over these four months, some bad and some good.  He was impressed that Sherlock would rather talk than just read his journal, but he was upset to see that he went back to his old habit of barely eating enough.  He would work on changing that when he moved back in.  There was a lot he had to do, break the lease to his flat, but that wouldn’t be a problem and it wouldn’t take long to pack because he only had what he owned when he used to live at 221b.
John loved it when Sherlock played coy. “Oh the possibilities are endless, maybe I should make you deduce it?”
.” Sherlock barely managed before John’s mouth claimed his and their tongues met.
and John thanked Mrs. Hudson yet again while Sherlock let Rosie grasp his finger and coo her good bye to him.
“I said minimal, I can stop,” he murmured in his ear, I just thought this might ease the tension, make it more relaxing for you, believable to them. I promise no touching anywhere else, unless you want to?”
Sherlock chuckled, “not really, I already cooked once today.  What are you in the mood for?”
He then came back in and reached for John’s hand, “come off to bed with me.”
“Take your time, it will take me a day or so to get everything ready for the listing.”
Sherlock reached across the table and took John’s hand, “sounds perfect, I’ll call Mycroft as soon as I’m finished eating.”  He said taking a heaping forkful of egg.
“We’ve seen this one before, haven’t we?” John asked.
“All I need you to do is pour this vial in the beaker when I tell you to.”
Sherlock huffed and turned his back to the coffee table now.  Out of sight but not out of mind.  What he read was stuck in his mind and this he could not delete.  No matter how hard he tried, the words were seared in his brain and he could not stop himself from dissecting their meaning.  He tried to think of other things, but he couldn’t, every thought came back to John.  Back to what he had written so long ago and Sherlock could not stop himself from thinking that from these words lie the answer he didn’t want to accept.  That John could not forgive him, that he had crossed one too many lines, told one too many lies and that John would never again be part of his life.  That all Sherlock would have now were memories, memories that he could never escape.
“Shhhh, Sherlock I want you so bad, will you please have me.”
“Boys! It has been far too long!  May I bring you your usual meals?”
“You’re wearing the jumper,” he finally managed to whisper in awe.
Sherlock hummed and shook his head.  “No, I’m fine and Rosie’s comfortable, did you enjoy your nap?”
(See the end of the chapter for
I know you must be sorely disappointed in my earlier actions and spent a good amount of time debating whether to even open this and read it for an explanation and since it seems that you are allowing me the chance to explain, I want to say I am deeply sorry but thank you for at least reading this.  I assume you are most likely ready to leave Baker Street for good, this being a wakeup call and I cannot say that I blame you in the least bit.
“You first,” Sherlock said.
John smiled.  “Not quite what I expected to come home to, but I could get used to it,”
“Because you’re always so in charge of everything outside of the bedroom and I just…”
Sherlock smiled, “I see, well I’m sure we can make that arrangement,” and he leaned closer towards John.  John leaned in towards him, his heart fluttering, when he heard Rosie’s cry come cross the monitor.  He frowned; he knew that this wasn’t only a one-time chance, but the opportunity had been so ripe for the taking.
“This is really good, thank you.”
“And that’s all there is to it, now if you’ll excuse us, John and I have dinner reservations.”
“John, it’s barely been four months since Mary has died and everything happened.  Everything that has led up to this has been a whirlwind.  Of course, you’ve barely had time to think about it or wrap your head around it.”
It was really over, all that business with Mary.  She was now nothing more than a memory.  In fact, that’s how it should have been, but it was far from it if he was honest with himself.  He was still hurt by her loss, her deception.  He had to deal with it, but he didn’t know where to begin.  It was too much.  He just wanted his life with Sherlock to begin smoothly, which so far it has been.  They’ve gotten a set schedule around Rosie and go to bed together at night.  Still there’s a silence there that needs to be acknowledged.  It’s more than just Mary too, it’s how he treated Sherlock for a while.  He had been an absolute nightmare to the man, telling him he’d rather have anyone in the world over him.  And all for what?  Because he had been hurt.  Deceived not only by his best friend, but by his wife too. But that was in the past now.  He could let go of Mary because she was dead, and he had long since forgiven Sherlock, so why did it feel like more needed to be said.  He must have been sitting there lost in his thoughts for some time when Sherlock walked in.
Sherlock turned his back and smiled as John turned the telly off and proceeded to the kitchen.
John pressed a light kiss to his lips. ‘Anything you want, anything for you Sherlock.'
“Sherlock…” he growled through gritted teeth, he was becoming impatient now and he could see the glint of mischievousness in those iridescent eyes as Sherlock smirked and licked his lips before drawing closer to lick around the crown of John’s cock.
They continued walking and talking about some of the changes they’d have to make at the flat and before they knew it they found themselves on the stoop of 221b and John stepped up on his tip toes and pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips.  “Shall we go tell Mrs. Hudson the good news?
“Yes we did.” John agreed and yawned.
“Are you kidding?  I’ve been waiting for this.  Should I bring my gun?”
Some cases were tough to crack, some required trips into the mind palace. John never questioned Sherlock’s methods usually, that is until they interrupted their regular dynamic.  A blue jewel had been stolen from a private family collection and the entire thing had vexed Sherlock.  The young girl had called the jewel the Blue Carbuncle and it was just absurd as the history she had told about it. Sherlock had almost dismissed the case entirely until he had seen a picture of the jewel and learned it had been stolen from a locked room with only one key and the key had been out of the country when the theft had occurred.  It was barely a four, but the family went way back with the Holmes’ and both mummy and Mycroft insisted.  In fact, it wasn’t until he had seen the picture that he’d become more intrigued, because he remembered actually seeing the jewel in person when he was a teenager when his mother was trying to get him to court the young lady that now sat in front of him.  He hadn’t said much, just nodded and hummed here and there, but John had assured the young lady they would look into the case for her.
About an hour and a half after John had left the flat, a grin spread across Sherlock’s lips as he sat at the kitchen table peering at a slide through his microscope as he heard John ascend the stairs to his old bedroom.  After John had left, he had raced up the stairs and dusted and fluffed the bed, he knew John would be back.
John could see the variations running through Sherlock’s mind and he’s known Sherlock’s wanted this for quite a while and to be honest, so did he. It was just a matter of getting him to agree.
“Alright, so what I’m going to do is take a walk through and get measurements and start to get the paperwork ready for listing.  Then after you have all your things out, I’ll take pictures and we’ll get it listed.” Miss Whitson said, and she winked at John and smiled.  “How does that sound?”
“John, nearly all of it was as much my fault as it was yours.  I could have seen past Mary’s facade, if I hadn’t been too preoccupied in thinking that’s who you wanted.  And you beating me, well I deserved that, have for some time so don’t be too harsh on yourself.  Besides, we caught ourselves a killer in the endgame.  And as for Eurus, nobody, not even my brother had the foresight to see her coming, but we survived it.”
“Good point but please don’t say I told you so.” Lestrade insisted.
Sherlock sat staring at the notebook.  He’d stopped at the first page even though he wanted to read on.  He couldn’t.  He had made a promise to himself and more importantly he had made a promise to John.  He’d give John time and in return, hopefully John could find a way to forgive him and come back to him.  But it had been four months now.  Four long months that Sherlock had occupied 221b all to himself and the walls were closing in. It was getting harder to resist the temptation, the itch of drugs calling to him or picking up the phone and calling him – he didn’t know which was worse, but he had promised.  Now the notebook lies there on the coffee table taunting him.  He could use it as an excuse to text John, tell him that he had found some of his things and that he would leave them downstairs with Mrs. Hudson and he could pick them up at his convenience.  He didn’t have to go into detail as to what items they were but the sooner he got rid of that notebook, the easier it would be to keep his promise.
Sherlock both smiled and crinkled his nose and tried not to let his displeasure show.  Special occasions meant date and Sherlock couldn’t bear the thought of that, not now.  The mention also made Sherlock realise that John hadn’t been on any dates since Sherlock’s return (and none while Sherlock had been ‘dead’ either according to Mycroft) and Sherlock had been perfectly happy with that.  In fact, it suited John much better.  He was happier than Sherlock had ever seen him before making it quite apparent that John Watson didn’t need a woman for that.  Sherlock was doing fine in that area all on his own.  The only thing John could possibly need a woman for was his sexual needs or desires and if John could just look past his own narrow mindedness when it came to the subject, he would realise Sherlock could fulfill that bit as well, thus entirely removing the need for a woman at all.
“Anything for you Sherlock, you should know that by know.”
He’d tease him and ride him hard and then a slow rock and when Sherlock couldn’t take it anymore, he would lace his fingers into John’s hair and planted his feet into the floor and began to meet John’s every thrust.
John reached across the table and took Sherlock’s hand.  “Sherlock, Baker Street is and always will be home for me.  I just didn’t know if a baby figured into the equation.”
“And I’ll clean up breakfast, which was excellent by the way.  We need you to do more of the cooking around here.”
Sherlock showered quickly and he was just buttoning his shirt when he heard Rosie babbling over the monitor.  He switched the monitor off and set off up the stairs to get her.
John chuckled, knowing Sherlock didn’t want to acknowledge what John was referring to.  He leaned forward placing a kiss to his temple then brushing his fingers through the silver streaks, letting them get caught just enough to pull a small moan from Sherlock.
He cleared his throat, “I’m sorry John. I have over stepped a boundary and completely understand if you wish to leave…” he was going to continue on and that’s when John stood, stepped around the desk, grabbed Sherlock’s collar and pulled him down into a kiss.
John keeps his promise.
Sherlock had never considered this and as he went over all the indications that had been there, he cursed himself for not taking this possibility into account.  He was so lost in his thought that he hadn’t even noticed John preparing his fingers with the lube.  John circled his hole several times, relaxing him, making him forget how to breath.  As he slid the first finger in, Sherlock winced slightly, scrunching his nose.
Sherlock frowned, “John, I told you presents weren’t necessary.”
John chuckled as Sherlock laced his gloved hand into John’s, “Only the pair of us could take this long to figure out our attraction to each other.”
He starts by continuing down his neck, worshiping every centimeter of skin with his lips and tongue, leaving no patch unexplored. He glances back up, catching Sherlock’s gaze as his trail of kisses comes to the waistband of his pants where he licks from one hip to the other. Still holding his gaze, he quirks an eyebrow, silently asking permission as he slides his finger across the path his tongue just left and Sherlock barely manages to nod yes. John snakes his fingers under the band, teasing the skin and gently pulling his pants down while mouthing at the newly exposed skin and inhaling his scent. And God if John doesn’t think this is heaven on Earth because nothing can compare to this feeling right now. All his senses are on the verge of being overwhelmed, but he pauses for a moment and inhales again before tugging Sherlock’s pants all the way off.
This was Sherlock reaching out to him, the only way he knew how.  It was like all those texts he’d sent the years he was away.  The ones John had burnt without reading.  And Mycroft’s words echoed in his ear, ‘you owe him this, to hear his explanation, it’s not what you think, it never is, not with Sherlock.’
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
After they had said their farewells to everyone John had found Sherlock in the kitchen, humming while making their tea.  It was their own special blend and it had become a ritual for them both before they could turn in for the evening.  When John had returned to Baker Street, it hadn’t even been a full week when he woke to one of Sherlock’s horrific night terrors.  By the time John had made it down the steps and to Sherlock’s side, the man had already come out of it, but he was paler was usual and his pyjamas were stuck to his skin from the night sweats, but the worst, where the tears that streaked those magnificent cheekbones and even more heartbreaking was the way Sherlock had grabbed John and clung to him, sobbing that he was sorry for leaving him and causing him the pain he did.  At first John hadn’t understood, this had to be more than just guilt for leaving, and he soon realised that the answers were probably held in the file that he had burnt, but then as John put his arms around Sherlock and rubbed his back to soothe him, he quickly put it together.  Through the thin fabric, he could feel the raised and gnarled welts that spanned the length of Sherlock’s back.  This man had been extensively beaten and tortured and God only knew what else.  Sherlock froze as it became clear John had discovered the scars, but John never backed away.  John pulled him closer and hushed him, murmuring that he was there now and that everything was ok.  He never asked, it wasn’t important, all that mattered was that they were both where they belonged.  What John couldn’t wrap his head around though was why Sherlock was apologising to John for leaving when the man clearly suffered at great length to ensure John’s safety.  By the time he had hushed Sherlock enough for him to back to sleep though, he realised something, that the answer was staring him right in the face, it had always been staring him right in the face.  Sherlock Holmes loved him.  That was the only possible explanation.  And it didn’t frighten John or freak him out, no – it gave him hope for the first time in so long.  He just needed to approach it with care and thought and maybe just maybe someday they could move beyond what they were, but for now, this was a good start.
Six, seven and eight took is breath away and required patience and measured amounts of deep breaths.  He had shifted and OH the sparks that flew through him, that was unexpected, but he still had two more.
Sherlock and John finally fall into bed together and don't hold back this time.
He sighed and sipped his tea and stared at the untouched muffin that sat before him.  He hadn’t wanted it, but he thought he should eat something as he hadn’t eaten yet today.  He was so preoccupied with his thoughts, he never heard the bell over the door announce its newest customer which is why he was caught off guard when the man with the umbrella joined him at his table.
“Can we please not talk about her, at least not yet.”
“John, I’m not so sure…” he rasped as John scooted closer in his bag and inched up to Sherlock’s ear, “Please Sherlock, for me.”
John grasps his hips lightly as he slides his lips further down Sherlock’s length, massaging his shaft with his tongue as he does.
Sherlock held her over his head and blew raspberries on her belly.  “How wonderful little bee, you get to try new foods.”
“Yes Sherlock, I do remember how you take your tea,” John said teasingly.
He slid half way down Sherlock’s length and then slowly back up to the all the way until he set up a pleasing pace and Sherlock’s fingertips had found their way into John’s short hair scaping his nails lightly over his scalp, causing John to slide down further and spur him on.  Sherlock’s legs dropped open further and John began to play with his balls, massaging them before reaching for the lube and slicking up two of his fingers, rubbing them together until the liquid was warm.
“Patience, don’t want to rush this part,” John whispered as he slowly pumped his finger in and out soon adding a second then third finger.
Sherlock grabbed him and pulled him down into his arms. “Don’t think you are leaving me to go work on that blog of yours.” Sherlock mused as he wrapped his arms and legs around his doctor.
He reached out and took John’s hand, laced their fingers together.
“I’ll go get ready, meet you back down here in ten minutes.”
He’d been woken very early by our housekeeper, she was in tears, had trouble recounting the story.  She had been to the market and been bringing in the bags when Redbeard slipped outside and took off after a squirrel.  As many times as she called him, he just wouldn’t return, he loved squirrels and he loved the snow.  The grounds keeper was out, clearing the snow with a small plow from the driveway and never saw Redbeard run in front of him until it was too late.
“I assure you,” John whispered, “this is not a dream.”
He leaned in and captured Sherlock's lips again, distracting him while he slicked his fingers and rubbed them together warming them. He was trying to remember everything he'd read to make first times enjoyable because the last thing he wanted to do was make this a terrible experience for either of them.
Sherlock added more with his other hand and John shivered but Sherlock once again engulfed him with his mouth all the way to the base and John cursed again, “More.”
“I see congratulations are finally in order for you and Doctor Watson.” Mycroft snipped.  That couldn’t even pull the happiness out of Sherlock, he was in such a euphoric state.
“It’s gorgeous Sherlock.”  Thank you.  But this is too nice to wear just any old time so I think I’ll save it for special occasions.”
Sherlock all but yelled, “Dear God John, stop teasing
“Oh John,” she said waving her arm at him, “we’ll be fine. Now go on the two of you, you don’t want to keep the movers waiting.”
John lets his grip on Sherlock’s waist loosen some and he gazes up at Sherlock, raising one hand to caress his cheek, ‘Sherlock,’ his voice barely above a whisper, ‘We don’t have to do anything, I don’t expect…’
“Fuck, Sherlock!” John groaned.
John let his hand drift further and was surprised to feel silk boxers, wetness already soaking the top of the fabric where Sherlock’s erection resided.
It had taken John Watson six months to forget him and it took Sherlock almost a year and a half when he got home (coincidently almost the same length of time he was gone, right after John had forgotten about him) to destroy all the good doctor ever wanted, a wife and a family and ironically, that turned out to be a façade as well.  A baby that wasn’t his and a woman whose proper name he didn’t even know.
Sherlock could only shake his his head yes.
‘Don’t care,’ John breathed as he reached out and brushed Sherlock’s cheek with his thumb, then running it over his full bottom lip all while inching closer. Their legs beginning to twine around each other and they felt the warmth of each other’s breath as they gravitated closer together, their bodies inexorably drawn to each other.
‘Come on, we should get out of our clothes before we catch cold,’ John said as he began stripping, dropping his clothes on the floor starting with his coat, then his shirt and his jeans.
Same for the next pages until about six months later.
John dropped back to the mattress, following all of Sherlock’s orders, drawing his knees up, planting his feet against the bed, and letting go.
"Now John, I've been thinking," his voice low and rumbly, "it's been quite some time since we've switched things up," he whispered as he ghosted over John's lips and licked them. Sherlock loved the effect it had on John. His pupils immediately widened and he licked his lips.
John scooted back and allowed Sherlock to take his favourite spot on the sofa when they did this – the middle. Sherlock took the lube and generously applied it to his cock and hissed at the coldness but that would be gone in seconds. He threw the bottle aside.
Sherlock snorted, “Fine, have it your way but don’t get angry when I told you so.”
She had texted him later that afternoon and told him he could take the rest of the week off to get things sorted, but ultimately he decided he didn’t need it.  He had surprised everyone by showing up early the next morning for his shift with a variety of pastries and going on like nothing had happened the previous day.
Comments and kudos are greatly appreciated.
“That would be nice, thank you John,” he looked down at Rosie who had finished half of her bottle and winked, it was now or never.  “John…” He waited for John to answer him back so he knew he was listening.
“And here I was thinking we could also have Mycroft hire us some movers to help pack up your place and move everything here.  It would be much easier than trying to do it by taxi or renting a van and making a dozen trips.  And whatever you don’t want, you can sell with the flat.”
“Well then brother mine, shall I ring Mrs. Hudson, she’ll be delighted to come up and take care of you.”
“Lead the way,” was all John had to say.
“Want me to do what?” It couldn’t mean what John hoped it meant. He was just deflecting now and trying to change the subject. Obviously this must be some kind of joke. Things like this did not happen where it concerned Sherlock.
John rolled off Sherlock and Sherlock took it upon himself to arrange the pillows against the head board so John could sit up, he wanted to be close as possible.  He found the lube and squirted a generous amount on his hands, rubbing them together to warm the liquid up and then he wrapped one hand around the base of John’s cock and began to slowly stroke him as he used his other hand to play with his balls which prompted John to spread his legs.
“Mmmm, I’m so glad for that.”
Sherlock wanted to scream, he didn’t know what to do.  He should have seen beyond the carefully constructed façade John had had in place, but he had been too worried about not letting his own mask slip that he completely missed that there was so much more to John Watson.  Sure he had seen through the most obvious parts of the façade, but John was cleverer.  John had hidden much from Sherlock, from everyone really and now it may be too late to fix all that was broken between them.
John shivered, his back arching off the mattress at the sudden contact of his thumb over his slit, smearing precome over the tip.  "Oh God,“ John moaned.
“They have a key and cursory instructions on what to start on, don’t worry, I’ve got it all worked out.”
John’s thrusts were becoming erratic and he was so close “Sherlock I’m gonna come..” John gave him three more deep thrusts hitting that sensitive gland and that’s all it took. Sherlock momentarily stopped stroking himself as he came, white ribbons coating his chest. John felt Sherlock tighten around him and it took only two more strokes until he exploded in Sherlock. John collapsed on top of Sherlock, but only stayed there momentarily before rolling off to the side. He removed the condom and binned it then turned back to Sherlock.
XXXXX
“Yes,” John piped up, “She’s at home enjoying a nice quiet evening with Mrs. Hudson while the two of us get out for a nice quiet evening.”
Meanwhile Sherlock was growing impatient, “John I’m ready now, please let me ride you.”
A thousand thoughts ran through Sherlock’s mind at lightning speed, he couldn’t decide, he had John’s lips and hands roaming his body, the only thing missing was having John inside him.  “Want you… want you inside me…
“But how? It was lost to me in Serbia…” and no more words came after that.  Serbia had been the end of the line.  Sherlock would have died there if it wouldn’t have been for Mycroft’s intervention.  Tears began to fall. “Mycroft said…”
John looked up at Sherlock and took a sip of his wine, he needed some liquid courage.  “So, a nice dinner out on the town at Mrs. Hudson’s suggestion?”
“Seriously John, that sounds like it could be fun, interesting even.” Sherlock teased as he tilted his head and raised his eyebrow. “Would you use rope or handcuffs? And just my hands or would you also bind my legs? It would definitely help alleviate my boredom.”
John’s eyes shot open, consumed with lust. Had he heard Sherlock right?
John hushed him, “I know but I want to.”
The words almost didn't register because he had assumed he would be John’s first and John would be his, but now he thought that wasn’t the case and when John’s words finally reached his brain, his lips formed a perfect ‘O’ and John smiled warmly.
Sherlock frowned, but covered it quickly, “Didn’t you leave an extra outfit or two here for emergencies?  Just use the shower here and use one of those, it will save you the hassle of running across town and possibly getting stuck in traffic.”
Lestrade nodded, “Sure, why don’t the two of you go home and get some rest and I’ll call you later if I need anything.”
John reached out and stroked his cheek. “Pity, but then I suppose those people aren’t as fortunate as I am.
It was the please and the way John’s voice cracked that finally made Sherlock lock eyes with John.  He couldn’t ignore John any longer or any of his pleas and while John hadn’t gone on a long tirade like he was usually apt to do, what he said was more than enough.  It sunk in, all the way to Sherlock’s heart.
and dropping forward one hand supporting him, still groaning Sherlock’s name and panting.
“I realise that but, it’s not been like that since I came back. Sure sometimes I have to remind you of certain things, but we’ve both changed and I want it this way first. I want to feel you inside me. I want you to have that first.”
gay and that he and Sherlock were just flatmates.
Sherlock was using this method, because it was the only way he knew how to reach John, through words.  He wrote it all down and waited for John to read it on his own.  John turned and walked back to his bed and settled on it.  He flipped the envelope over and slid his finger under the seal and pulled out the beautifully scripted pages and began to read.
He looked up at John. He had under estimated the good doctor. “Well, one thing. I don’t care who knows about us. I have no problem showing the world how I feel about you. That is unless you object to it.”
“Sherlock, we don’t have to now, it can wait.” John whispered as Sherlock began to nip at his neck and crawled over John and bracketed John’s body with his legs and hands.  Sherlock brushed his nose against John’s lips, “Please I want you.”  He lowered his hips, rocking himself against John, “Please John.”
Sherlock looked down at the box.  It was oversized and had a good bit of heft to it and he had no idea what it could possibly be.  John had truly gone out of his way to make sure whatever was in this box had stayed secret and as he finished tearing the paper away and removed the lid, he understood why.  In the box was something he thought lost to him forever, his beloved Belstaff, repaired to almost mint condition.
“Ah, but John I would like to.”
Mycroft had been home that holiday, first time in several years and had found me frantic upon his return from a trip into town.  He’d taken me into the house and set me down by the fire to warm me, I had been running around outside for quite some time inadequately dressed.  He then told me he needed to talk to me about Redbeard and I knew he was gone forever.  He needn’t say the words, I knew, but he went on to tell me the story anyway.
“You berk, LISTEN, it wasn’t like that.  It’s not like on that day I had asked her to marry me.  That’s the day I decided to live because that’s what you would want of me.  My days still continued to be dark and dreary, but they were a little easier to bear knowing that I was hopefully doing what you would want of me.  Mary had then started working at the clinic and took an interest in me, but I kept turning her down whenever she asked me for coffee or lunch.  Eventually she caught me on a day when I said yes to coffee and at the beginning, being with her was a bit of an escape from the loneliness.  I won’t go into detail, but it just became like everything else, something that helped to keep my mind off you and how much I missed you.  If I kept myself and my mind occupied, then I wasn’t thinking of you and that day at Bart’s and how I failed you because that’s what it had felt like to me Sherlock.  That I failed because you jumped and I regretted all the things that I had said to you before I left you at Bart’s that day.  It still haunts me.  If I had known, I would have waited for you.”
The next pass, he takes John further into mouth and he presses against his perineum and then trails back to his tightly clenched hole. Yes, it has been a long time since Sherlock’s taken him, way too long. This brought a smile to his face though, that means he would get to tease the good doctor longer.
New Year’s Eve arrived quickly and John had suggested they go to Angelo’s for dinner.  Sherlock had been delighted by the idea and called to make the arrangements.  The day had gone by quickly and around five, they both retired to their rooms to get ready for their seven o’clock dinner date.
“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.”  He picked up the lube and squeezed some onto his fingers and then liked down the length of Sherlock’s cock and then decided to pay special attention to his balls, kissing and sucking them while he continued to warm the lube on his fingers.
Sherlock raised his eyebrow to question, intrigued by this admission.
John kissed Mrs. Hudson on the cheek and Rosie on the head and told her to be good.  Rosie just cooed and laughed and then he and Sherlock bid their farewells and headed down the stairs to hail a taxi.
“So where do we stay?”
John slowly kissed down his body, sucking at the soft spot between his collar bone and neck and Sherlock let lose, he moaned and begged John not to tease.  He ran his nails lightly up and down John’s back as John travelled down further, stopping to suck and lave at each nipple through his soft vest.  Sherlock once again arched his back off the ground as John proceeded down even further, kissing one hip bone at a time, sucking marks there where no one would be able to see them.
“Christ Sherlock, you will be the death of me,” John panted and Sherlock sat back and increased the pressure on his finger just enough to dip the tip in, the lube helping his fingertip slip right past the tight ring of muscles.
With that Sherlock rolled John onto his back and began to undo his jeans, he made quick work of removing the offending clothing and got right down to business, after pausing a moment to admire the sight before him. John stretched out before him, never in a million years did he think this would have been possible.
“It’s not that,” he said reaching across the table to take Sherlock’s hand to reassure him, “the usual is fine.  It’s just I was wondering…” He looked at Sherlock and smiled bashfully, “I was um, hoping, maybe we could get a candle?”
“Agreed, but I’m sure I can have this case solved by tomorrow and we can be home by mid evening.  We can celebrate with a dinner at Angelo’s and then go home and have sex for dessert.”
John stood up and wandered over to where Sherlock stood and put his hand on Rosie’s back.  “So what shall we have for dinner?  Miss Rosie is going to have some cereal and bananas for dinner.”
John was taken aback, “you don’t have to do that.”
“Yes, but people will talk.”
A flood of relief washed over Sherlock’s face. “John, I...” his voice cracked.
John shiver and swallowed, “Get on with it then.”
With that, John stood and grabbed Sherlock’s hand and headed for the room. Once there, he pushed Sherlock onto the bed and crawled on top of him and began to ravish every part of exposed skin. When he made his way to the waistband of those ridiculously beautifully tailored trousers, he undid the belt and popped the button. He could already see Sherlock’s erection straining under the fabric. Well he was about to fix that. He pulled the zip. Sherlock lifted his hips a bit so John could remove his trousers, socks, and shoes. John’s eyes widened in amazement. Sherlock wasn’t wearing any pants, of course he wasn’t. He heard Sherlock try to stifle a laugh. “You know that really shouldn’t surprise me, in fact it makes things easier.”
Sherlock’s fingers find their way into John’s short hair and tugs him closer. He wants more. He needs more. He needs John. All of him. Everything,
“We’ll go slow and take our time, there’s no reason to rush any of this, not now that we’re together.”
Sherlock’s eyes went wide, “John, you had every reason to be angry with me.  I betrayed your trust by pretending to be dead for two years and then pushed you into a marriage you didn’t really want when I got back because I was an arrogant arse and I thought that’s what you really wanted.  I misread or ignored, still not quite sure which, all the tells that should have told me who and what Mary was, but did so because I thought you were happy and that’s all I wanted and you still were letting me be part of your life.”  He stopped and took a sip of his tea.
Sherlock dug in his pocket for the lube he had grabbed when he snuck in the room to undress himself only to return in the dressing gown. He inched down further on John’s cock setting up a teasing rhythm of a slight bob while sucking ever so slightly. This way John wouldn’t notice the bottle being clicked open and Sherlock applying a generous amount of lube to his fingers so he could warm it before teasing his doctor open.
Sherlock checked the time, it was half four.  “Does six work for you?  I need a shower and Mrs. Hudson said she was available all evening and we always have a table waiting for us at Angelo’s as you’re well aware so no need to call ahead.”
“Oh John, I don’t think it took us that long to figure that out, it took us this long to act on it and you know, I don’t think I would want it any other way.”
And with those three little words, John let go, thrusting frantically, shouting as his balls drew up, come pulsing over his stomach as his hand stilled.
As always comments and kudos are appreciated.  Thank you.
Sherlock giggled and pushed his thigh against John’s erection, “I have news for you my doctor, I am already well aware of how much it does.”
“Whatever you want the answer is already no.”
Twenty minutes later Sherlock was sitting on the couch with plates in front of him when John had returned to the main floor.
‘We should have really toweled off first,’ Sherlock giggled, ‘we’re going to make everything wet, my hair alone will soak your pillow through.’
“Oh nothing, but I do think I have found a way to stave off your boredom in the future.”
John cleared his throat and nodded, trying not to let the tears fall, “But how can you forgive what I’ve done?  I called you a right bastard and worse, told you I’d rather have anyone in the world other than you and beat you enough to hospitalise you.”
“Yes, it would seem so John.”
Sherlock spun around to face the desk. He put his hands on the edge of the desk and leaned down to capture John’s gaze. “Please John, don’t let me keep you from your blog, as you assured me you are able to do more than one thing at a time.” He finished with one of those grins that he knew drove John wild.
“John”
She reached out and placed a hand over his, “he didn’t say no the first time, I doubt he’ll say no a second time.  Baker Street is his home and he misses it.  Why do you think he comes every day when he can?”
Sherlock smiled as John rolled to his side, Sherlock wrapping his arm around John. “Mmm, indeed though the next time I request we leave the lights on so I can see every bit of you.”
“I’ve been known to have one once in a while. Now at any time this is too much tell me and we can stop.”
This time though Sherlock could see something different as he made his way towards John.  He could see a great deal of tension in John’s neck and shoulders, leading him to conclude that he must have had a near sleepless night and not so good day with the double shift of work he had put in to help out Sarah after one of the other doctors had called in with a family emergency.  This time he was reading the paper but kept sighing and shifting in his chair.  Sherlock silently rose form his chair at the table leaving his experiment behind and padding up quietly behind John.  This would take more than just a kiss.
He started at John's neck and lightly traced his fingers down over each nipple and then continued down John’s abdomen until he reached John’s swollen cock that was begging for attention, for release. He wrapped those magnificent long fingers around John and slowly started stroking him. John closed his eyes and got lost in the feeling, every once in a while letting out a small groan. Sherlock leaned forward and started sucking on his neck, never increasing the stroking though sometimes increasing the pressure. He kissed John’s lips again and then along his cheek and over to his ear. “John…”
Sherlock looked at him a moment as if he didn’t understand.
“Well dear, you look like you have some thinking to do, I’ll leave you to it.”  She stood to take here leave.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock leaned forward, planting a soft kiss to John’s lips before he murmured, ‘John you are so far from ordinary, you are my everything, my conductor of light.’
“About a year and a half,” John said shakily.
“Tea?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good afternoon little one.” He greeted her as he pulled her from her cot and laid her on the changing table.  “Let’s get you sorted and then we can go downstairs and wake your daddy.”  Rosie clapped her hands and cooed.
He went back to unbuttoning the shirt. He pulled Sherlock forward a bit so he could remove it and let it fall to the floor. Not to be out done, Sherlock grabbed the hem of John’s jumper pulling it and the shirt underneath over his head and tossing them so they joined his shirt on the floor. They met for another kiss, this time John’s fingers found their way to Sherlock’s curls eliciting a deep moan. Meanwhile Sherlock’s finger’s explored John’s chest, lightly brushing over the scar on his shoulder though not lingering because he knew it made John uncomfortable. Maybe someday he could further explore it, but not now, there was so much he wanted to do. His fingers eventually found John’s nipples and gave them a pinch, not enough to cause pain, just enough to get them to harden. He leaned up and licked down John’s neck and chest until he found one nipple and took it between his lips, gently sucking and nipping while still rolling the other between his thumb and forefinger, pulling the sweetest moan from John's throat.
“Yeah mate, I’m sorry for how that all turned out, messy business and all.  Thank goodness you had Mycroft to take care of all of it.”
John stood there tapping his foot.  “After everything, you expect me to accept that as a reason to let you go?  To give up and turn my back on you?  Sherlock, THIS is exactly what a relationship is.  Yea, they can hurt, it’s unavoidable but if you do it right, if you’re lucky to find someone you love you half as much as you love them or more, the hurt is outweighed by all the good you share.  And damn it we are due our fair share of good after all of the suffering we’ve endured.  And the fact that you chose to come home and write me a letter explaining everything instead of just disappearing tells me more than that letter ever could.”
“John,” he whispered “I thought you said this was pretend, no touching.”
“I’d like that very much John.  Just the two of us together against the rest of the world.”
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Please know that it has always and only ever been you John.
“No, we will waste too much water and we will need to make sure we get all this stuff off of us.”
John nodded and slowly pulled his finger back then inched it in a bit further this time. He could happily spend hours doing this, exploring Sherlock's body like this, now that he was focused again.
Sherlock handed the vial to John, “now when I tell I want you to put this in, but pour it slowly.”
They stepped out of the tub and John took a towel and hastily patted them down and took Sherlock’s hand and walked into the bedroom.  He pushed him onto he bed and crawled on top of him. He pressed their groins together slowly rocking there into him.
“Just a moment, I want to remember this feeling forever.”  After a few moments Sherlock began to slowly rock his hips back and forth and John began to match his pace.
And John smiles to himself and thinks how can he deny Sherlock anything? He finds himself gazing down into Sherlock’s cerulean eyes and he can see how open Sherlock is right now in this moment. He’s never seen Sherlock like this before, so vulnerable and John feels like the most important person in the universe right now because Sherlock has trusted HIM of all people with this. For Sherlock to let himself be laid out bare and raw like this, John knows without a doubt that this is real, not just some passing fixation or fling or worse yet – experiment. This between them, will stand the test of time and he knows it won’t be easy, but oh how he wants it. There’s so many words John wants to tell Sherlock right now but he knows how he despises the sentiment so instead he decides to show him.
How could he resist?
“I think we both just needed time to get ourselves right, get things in perspective.  I couldn’t exactly move back into Baker Street right away, plus I needed time to deal with things.”
“But I know that’s not what you want, you just want the cases and the adrenaline they provide and I’m not sure I can live like that anymore, not with how I feel.”
John was overjoyed, but there were still things that needed to be resolved.
“So, Doctor…” Sherlock paused then grinned, “Mmmm, excuse me, Captain Watson wants to see how filthy my pretty little mouth is, doesn’t he?”
He began working on Sherlock’s hole and soon enough he had both fingers buried inside Sherlock, massaging his prostate, Sherlock now begging and pleading with him, John sped up his rhythm and sucked him down further, Sherlock moaning as he felt the tip of cock brush the back of John’s throat and he was surprised to find John had no gag reflex, he cursed as John swallowed down around him and began to massage his prostate faster.
A shaky breath escaped his lips at the first contact of cool hands on his heated skin.  A sigh of relief as he wrapped his hand around the base of his cock and started with several long pulls.
John couldn’t help but gasp when he saw Sherlock’s bare arse, he had dreamed of it so often and now here it was and he so wanted to reach out and touch it, but he wasn’t sure how Sherlock would take that.
‘Oh my God Sherlock, this is...’
“Please stay.”
“God yes,” John moaned and Sherlock leaned in and began to push the tip of his cock against John’s loosened hole.
“I suppose you’re right.” John agreed and he finished his tea.  Sherlock had already finished his.
That’s when John smirked and softly pushed Sherlock on his back and crawled on top of Sherlock straddling him, pushing their groins together and thrusting slowly.  When Sherlock felt John’s cock through his pants he groaned.   John smiled lacing their fingers together, pulling Sherlock’s arms above his head.  “Tell me what you want gorgeous.”
“Heavens no.  I was just about to sneak off to the loo and take care of myself because I thought you were asleep and the way you look was really turning me on, I can only imagine what you must have looked like in that tux.”
“Sherlock, oh God, that’s bloody brilliant. Keep doing that. I want to see you cum for me again.”
“Well I think we should fight fire with fire.”
Seemed easy enough, he took them into the loo for a thorough washing and grabbed a few flannels just in case he made a mess.  He grabbed the lube and returned the bedroom and silently stripped, dropping his clothes to the floor and crawling onto the bed. He cupped the beads in his hands to warm them and placed the tube of lube under his thigh to warm it, body heat always did the trick and he was getting excited.
“I think we need to wash down.”
It was like nothing either of them had ever experienced before as Sherlock pulled John into him, controlling things now, which John was thankful for because he was fairly certain he wouldn't be able to it if it were left to him.
Sherlock smiled, leaning down and licking the come that had pooled on John’s stomach, all the way up his chest until their lips met.  John groaning as he tasted himself on Sherlock’s lips and tongue.
Little did he know, that’s exactly what was happening.  He had never heard the detective enter the flat nor make his way down the hall. Sherlock was tired and just wanted to crawl into bed next to John and rest so he was as quiet as he could be as he entered the flat since it was still early.  He expected John to be sleeping but was quite shocked (and pleased) to see the spectacle before him as he reached the threshold of their bedroom.
John lifted his head to capture Sherlock’s lips again, who had backed away a bit and in the process hooked his leg around Sherlock's and rolled them, reversing their positions.
He turned his head and tried to find John’s eyes, but it was too dark, but they were that close that their breath mingled and the tension was ten times more than it had been just a few moments ago.  Sherlock swallowed and tried to speak, “I had hoped but…” With that, John leaned in closer and tried to find Sherlock’s lips in the dark, fumbling a bit, noses in the way till, John finally moved his head a bit to the left and their lips finally slotted together and they both moaned.  Apparently they had both needed this. The only thing that mattered was the two of them right here in this moment now.  They moaned into each other’s mouths and pulled each other closer, things were heating up fast and Sherlock moved John’s hand back to his chest. “Please, I want more.”
“Of course you can,” John chuckles lightly, “go back to sleep, it wasn’t my intention to wake you.” John murmured reaching out and brushing his fingertips across the silver strands.
"Sherlock…please…”
“I have never been more sure of anything in my life.” And with that he turned to his bedside table and fished out a condom and bottle of lube.
“Certainly, but John, you know there is never a charge for you or Sherlock.  Are you sure everything is ok?”
“Mmmm, don’t want to now,” Sherlock mumbled, lifting his head and nuzzling into John’s neck.  “John, I want you to have me now.”
“This was your idea; I’m just giving you what you wanted.”  He smirked, tugging on the ring again lightly.  “Now the question is, do I drag this out or pull them out swiftly?”
John chuckled, “why am I not surprised?”
John pulled him closer and their lips part, tongues exploring the insides of each other’s mouths, and Sherlock whimpers, his hips automatically begin to roll on their own. John moans and shivers at the contact and now Sherlock begins rocking back and forth, rubbing their groins together and smirking because he did that. He made John tremble from his touch, his movements against John’s body.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock and enjoyed the warmth of his arms and wished that this moment could last forever.  Something had changed between them and they could both feel it in the air, but neither of them commented on it, they were too afraid of ruining the moment and everything between them that had taken so long to recover.
John agreed and looked quizzically at Sherlock.  He was up to something.  He followed Sherlock into the kitchen and watched as he clicked the kettle on and got the mugs ready.
Rosie just giggled and burped as Sherlock sat her up and rubbed her back.
Sherlock glanced at the clock, it was half eleven, an hour had already past, no matter, he could finish the other five no problem and be finished and cleaned up before John returned home.
The first time they slept naked together began wit a shower and then they ended up in the same bed, well Sherlock may have planned it.
And then years later, you came along and you were so unlike anyone I had ever met before.  God how I had longed for you after that first brief meeting, amazed when you showed up the next day to look at the flat with me.  And there were so many possibilities opening up in front of me, but all I could think about is how much it hurt to lose something and I was never going to risk that again, because no one ever stayed.  And then you managed so much in the first forty-eight hours of our meeting that I could see hope and it scared me so I kept the walls up.  At least I tried to, but you kept chipping them down slowly over the next year and a half and then Moriarty threatened your life and I had to give back what you had given me.  I had to save your life.  I just didn’t realise the impact of what it would do to me or how it would really effect you.
John was sitting in his chair thinking about things and Rosie was upstairs taking her afternoon nap and Sherlock was at Bart’s working on a case.
“And what did you discover?” John asked leaning against the door frame.
“When am I not?” Sherlock replied.
“And neither did you but you did and I love it.  So go on then.”  John said excitedly.  He was practically vibrating out of his skin.
As John was distracted by pleading, Sherlock pushed forward and slowly slipped inside until he was buried all the way into the hilt.  John lifted his legs and wrapped them around Sherlock’s waist and wanted more.
“That’s a pretty lame reason,” Donovan said.
It’s been two weeks and the transition of moving from the flat to Baker Street had been relatively easy.  Rosie took to her new home like it had been her home her whole life.  Of course, there were days where she was fussy, but that was due to her teething.  She had just had her six month checkup when the
“Right,” said Lestrade and radioed back to the officers working the tapes what to look for.
“I’ve never….”
Exactly what it says
John cleaned the dinner from the table and did the dishes while Sherlock entertained Rosie with a book.  When he finished, he suggested they give Rosie her bath and get her ready for bed.  Sherlock agreed, it was nearing eight and it usually took an hour to give her bath and bottle.
“No, listen, I wasn’t finished.  Sherlock, I hadn’t forgotten you but I thought you were dead.  You had been my whole life, the one thing good I had going for me and when you ‘
Sherlock plans for a dinner away from Baker Street without Rosie.  Will John say yes?
“For us,” John said, reaching for his glass and holding it out to toast Sherlock.  Sherlock obliged and held his glass up and tinked the side of John’s glass and then took a sip.
“Fuck yea, John just like that I love that little trick you…
John looked up at him amazed, because he could not fathom that someone like Sherlock –brilliant, amazing, incredible Sherlock – would want someone as ordinary as him.
John’s girth and length were amazing but Sherlock was most pleased at John’s reaction while he hummed and pushed himself further down John’s cock.
“Besides, maybe I can get you to get some real rest now, that you’re home.  Come, grab the monitor and let’s get some sleep, it’s been a few long weeks and I honestly don’t know how you’ve been doing it.”
John gave one last kiss to Rosie’s forehead and told her to behave for Mrs. Hudson to which she babbled and gurgled
Things aren't going to be a smooth transition, the boys still have some issues to work through.
“Seems like everything is back to normal here.” She said quietly.
Sherlock grinned as he nipped at John’s fingertips and let his legs fall away from his waist.  He backed up and got on his own knees now and faced John, skimming his fingertips from his waist to the slight layer of pudge that covered powerful abdominal muscles.  Sherlock traced circles around his nipples and pinched them slightly before moving his hands upwards and cupping John’s face and pulling him in for a slow luxurious kiss where their lips slid together perfectly, their tongues mingling together, drawing out the softest of moans from John.  Sherlock pulled back and John followed, eyes half lidded, and Sherlock placed a hand on John’s chest and replied, “I believe you wanted me to show you what I can do with my mouth?”  He teased devilishly tilting his head a bit to the side with a wicked grin.
