He can’t make himself go through the motions of the morning after, because he knows he’s going to keep on falling for Dean, and he’ll be unable to let go.
— half awake, half asleep, and his brain is merely trying to start dreaming. However, when Castiel’s under stress beyond his capabilities, he mostly sees things getting out of proportion. A foolish way for his brain to address how things are getting out of hand, maybe, but he can’t help his rising anxiety levels whenever this happens.
“I’ve got a therapist,” Castiel starts. “I talk to him twice a week through Skype. It’s the most convenient way; I wasn’t ready to leave home to talk to him.”
Castiel shakes his head. “No, it wasn’t uncomfortable. I’ve never been good with small talk anyway. Besides, you were trying to help me out.”
“By staring into some of the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen, for starters. It’s hard to think a lot while doing that.”
Castiel had loads of things to think about right now and none of those things should leave him time to swoon. Instead, his eyes rested easily on Dean’s face as he closed his eyes to bask in the sunlight. Eventually, though, his gaze dropped to Castiel with a frown.
Castiel doesn’t even care what’s coming next, because the guy is obviously asking for something again. He turns on his heels and walks.
”It’s 23 hours, Dean. No, I don’t need you to drive right now. Just have dinner. I’m sorry I called.”
Anna. Dean felt a slight buzz in his chest. He'd thought his encounters with his New York acquaintances were over, but apparently he could think again.
“Don’t know if you have it in you, Castiel, but I salute you for even considering it. Drag queens are the heroes of our lifetime.”
His gaze turns back to Castiel, who feels those eyes are peering straight into his soul. What are they seeing? All the desire he feels, or how reluctant he is to get closer to Dean, for ear of not being able to pull back before the heartbreak?
Everyone’s instantly on board with the idea of a 4th of July Winchester, Inc., party. Sam promises Castiel to force an opening for next Tuesday, since finding an open slot in any day is nearly impossible for the Winchesters. Castiel asks both Meg and Balthazar to join him for the meeting, and briefs them of the conversation at the club. While Balthazar reprimands him for not telling his friends about there being a Winchester talent scout attack, Meg says she’s never doubted Castiel’s charisma. They’re happy to see where this road leads, even though they’d never get further than the first meeting.
“Generally, this would be,” he admits, “since you are my customers tonight. That being said, I really should get backstage. It’s time to perform soon and I know a colleague or two who wouldn’t love it if I weren’t there to prepare.”
She asks, the movement of her hands both soft and almost frantic. It makes Castiel feel warm, and he nods.
“We didn’t discuss the morning, yeah,” Dean sounds preoccupied, “we should’ve. I would have wanted to drink coffee with you.”
“Your guess is as good as mine. I could just… Ask him, I guess, but I want to respect the space he wants.”
There’s something in Dean that has Castiel completely captivated, no matter how much he thinks  that it’s over -- especially since he hasn’t heard anything from him since they separated on Sunday evening. He hasn’t forgotten how he realized he was in love while walking home through town, nor has he forgotten how easy it was being with him all day  just holding each other. The more he thinks of Dean, the more he realizes he could give him the Stardust speech. His heart feels too big for his chest to contain, and whatever his gut is telling him about not deserving… Dean makes him want to give it a try anyway. The possibility of their relationship is what Castiel has dreams about; simple things, such as waking up to each other every morning, making coffee and sitting on his balcony.
“I know what initially made you stay at home. But what I have no clue of,” she gives him a once-over, “is why you never left.”
“Okay, gather around then, wee ones. Take your seats and let’s have a round of introductions. Do you remember names at one go, Castiel, or do we have to do an embarrassing play date game?”
It’s not like Castiel is jealous. It’s not a surprise that he wasn’t anything particular to Dean, that he had his moment and it passed and there’s nothing he could’ve done differently to make Dean stay. He has no rights to him, so he doesn’t get to decide who he does or or doesn’t touch; but more than that, Bela Talbot seems like a really cool woman and he doesn’t want to think badly of her.
Castiel hums, and for a while, Dean fears that he’s been reading his all this time. He’s not even sure what he’s been thinking about – but the thought of someone invading his privacy in such a profound manner doesn’t strike as nice to him.
”I’ll accept your apology,” Castiel said, ”I know the things I said are not what you’d wish to hear after you left your life in Kansas to come meet up with a friend.”
“Okay, so I wasn’t. But I’ve got a shift tomorrow, and if we’re going to have a sharing circle it’ll be a long one.”
“Don’t be so patient with me,” Castiel huffs and shoves Dean a little. Dean only smiles and leans back in for a quick peck on Castiel’s lips.
“If I feel like it. One of the pros of freelancing is that you can actually do what you want every now and then.”
“I don’t… Nothing points to that. You were found by a dude who ran after you for a while and then wondered where you went. He was coming for you because his boyfriend got shit-faced and passed out. He wanted to see if you had a phone that he could borrow. According to him, you were alone.”
Castiel heard the Impala wheels crunch, but before he could fully panic at Dean leaving him here, the engine stopped. Dean had parked the car across the road and got to his feet, too – or at least Castiel thought he did, he was way too… Scared? Confused? Stubborn? to look at the man.
“A perfect house for both tag and hide and seek,” he said, and nodded to himself, “and any kind of other activities, I bet.”
Dean wraps his arms casually around Castiel, locking him in place. Hands down, this is the best feeling in the universe. He can hear Dean’s heartbeat, and it’s in time with the ring.
That felt like a punch in the gut, and Castiel’s hands balled into fists around a tree garland he had just unboxed.
“Anyway, I don’t think you stepped over any lines. I asked you, and you talked. I’m glad you did. Now I know you a little better, and I also know it wasn’t anything we did that caused you to have second thoughts about this party.”
“You need a safety net,” Charlie says, frowning, “and I think this could be it. I will always, always be there for you, but when I’m not around… I need to know you’ve got people that you can rely on.”
“Hell yes, that is a yes, angel. Unless your brains are overwhelmed by kittens and you don’t know what you’re asking.”
“It’s not nothing if that’s your tone right now. You sound like you did back when you needed to exit the meeting. Did I say something wrong?”
For the first couple of hours after Mills’ call, Castiel feels like he’s floating. He’s relieved beyond measure, and would really want to forget the stalker altogether, but soon enough his mind starts wandering back to the name. He’s sure he’s heard it somewhere — in the same way he’s sure he’s heard the voice before — but being unable to place it really drives him out of his mind. During their planning, which mostly consists of hanging lanterns and light bulbs under the gazebo ceiling and hiding from the rain, he lets his colleagues in on the call but isn’t willing to talk more.
”No, just tell me what you’re afraid of. I sensed you were a bit off from your texts earlier, so don’t try to-”
As Castiel is briefly distracted by kissing Dean’s inner thighs, Dean reaches out, grabs his forearms and pulls him on top of him and in for a kiss, and another one, then wraps his legs around Castiel’s hips and pulls him closer.
“You’re putting us on a tight timeframe, that’s for sure,” Castiel mutters, and upon Rowena’s angry glance, he raises his hands in consolation. “I’m not complaining. I’m ready to get back into something bigger.”
Before Dean can notice Castiel smiling and blushing at the memory, he turns around and stretches out to get a grip on one of the bags. It makes a screeching sound against the floor as he pulls it closer.
A clerk from the nearby stall hollered for Castiel to come over to taste their new hot chocolate with peppermint and chili, and since he had nothing better to do, he obliged. As soon as he had his hands on the cup, his phone vibrated with a message.
“Yeah, the attack was bad. I couldn’t hear shit for a while. After I was done, he drove me home. It was embarrassing.”
“Well, obviously. Fireworks going off, you flaunting your wings, National Anthem playing in the background…” Balthazar trails off. Castiel feels a pang of panic, but doesn’t have time for that, because they’re getting company.
“What do you mean?” Castiel asks, but his words come out slow and warped — he can only voice out syllables of the words he needs to ask.
Dean adjusts his crossed legs under him and sips the blend Castiel put in his mug. His expression gives nothing away, but this is far from Castiel’s best blend. He wants to blame the materials he had, but that seems petty.
“This is a little too deep, man,” Dean says, clearing his throat. “What I meant was just that you don’t need to take me seriously, because as you know, I quite possibly can’t deliver sex. And that’s kind of an important thing that people usually expect after kisses.”
Dean was having none of it, though – instantly, he walked over to the knitted beanies and put one on. It had antlers on it, soft brown ones that looked a bit like…
“First of all, I’d be taking you home to continue where we left off. Definitely, definitely interested in that. Second of all, I need you to know that… That if you come home with me, I can’t promise you anything but this. I am not… Available, romantically.”
“Then I'm fine with it too,” Castiel says, nodding solemnly. How in the hell did they end up here? Seriously, they were just eating tacos for lunch. Dean frees one of his hands from Castiel's waist and cups his cheek. Castiel kisses his hand almost instinctively, making Dean's eyes soften. Then, Dean leans impossibly close, and presses his lips against Castiel's.
Ruby lifts her eyebrows in a gesture that says nothing about the situation is lost on her. Castiel scoffs and turns away, sliding his gaze across the tables filled to the brim with various treats and mild alcohol drinks to go with the food. People are chattering all around him, and everyone seems to have the most important opinion of the evening. It’s a bit pretentious — but then again, it’s all relative. For some of these people Castiel could seem pretentious, and since that’s not a thing he wants to be called, he should keep the condescending observations to a minimum.
Dean could only make it along two more blocks before it fell down as a steel wall of what could only be described as despair. It made him uncertain whether it was merely caused by the weather or if his high spirits were finally running out.
“A friend would be nice, please,” Sam says, forcing half a grin on his face. “I don’t know why I’m so nervous tonight.”
Of course, the thoughts returned soon enough. When would Bartholomew want him out of here? Would he make him go back if he disagreed with the time Castiel deserved to lie in here? Castiel appreciated that the choice of when to leave washis, but it was already turning against him. What if he was a disappointment by thinking what he’d done wasn’t that wrong? How much time had passed since he was left here anyway? Would it be dangerous to stay here too long?
I mean you could throw me in an aquarium for all I know. I've got no reason to trust you, no reason to be here and absolutely no reason to go see fishes.
He spins around and is met by Dean’s gaze trying to drill into his core. He tries to exhale casually, but all that comes out is a screeching whine.
“Could you come here?” he eventually asks. Castiel turns to look at him, and Dean smiles, extending his whiskey-free arm. Castiel slides across the couch to press himself against Dean’s warm side. Dean wraps his arm around Castiel, and kisses the top of his head. Castiel hums happily, and this is so cozy it’s almost dangerous. He loves to be this close to Dean — close enough to hear his heartbeat.
Castiel notices he’s been biting his nails for a while now. He’s frustrated that he can’t just make a telepathic link with James and let him know, once and for all, what exactly has happened and where he’s at now without having to talk it out. But what would he want from him in a situation of distress?
Castiel mouths Jody to Charlie, who’s looking at him questioningly. She gives a thumbs up and heads back to the living room.
Castiel stood up, making Dean follow him immediately. He unwrapped the brass chains off himself and threw one loop around Dean's neck, leaving his hands linger on the other man's shoulders. Looking in Dean's eyes, there was no doubt in Castiel's mind that this wouldn't be mutual, these ridiculous internal fireworks caused by the touch.
“You could just make a setlist out of songs you've performed before. It doesn't need to be anything new, right?” she asks.
“Hey?” Castiel said, letting out a light chuckle that he hoped would ease the sudden tension. “What are y—”
Castiel rolls his eyes and releases his seatbelt. Balthazar yells his thanks as he slams the door closed.
Dean looks almost offended, but his expression melts quickly, as if he never thought it through in the first place.
Castiel’s voice is worried. He places his hand on Dean’s upper arm and squeezes it firmly. Dean wants to open his eyes, but he can’t. Instead, he slowly moves his hand on top of Castiel’s.
He makes good progress during the afternoon, even though he’s distracted by the tiny origami pieces that keep on appearing on his path. To make sure they’ve all learned what the new law means, Amanda came up with a task for them; they all needed to build a simple webpage with additions that accommodate the changes. She said it was a clever idea, and that it’d be fun for them to think about something else than mundane B2B programming.
“I can’t leave,” Castiel whispers. The officer scrutinizes him for a moment. Castiel scrutinizes right back. Mills, her badge says.
“Alright, whether they’re judged later or not, these people can now actually let go of their restrictions and social facades a little. They’re free to act as individuals instead of merely workers. People like us don’t have that many opportunities to do so.”
“You're the best friend I've ever had. And even that doesn't cut it. I don't know if I've ever believed in the whole soulmate thing, because that's sappy as fuck and I'm still trying to cling to the shreds of my ego here – but that's what I feel when I'm around you. Nobody just gets me like you do.”
But there it is again. Castiel squints against the sun, trying to both dig deeper into his thoughts and distract himself. This isn’t going to work. He needs to have a conversation with someone about Bartholomew, and since James already knows something, he might want to tell him more… But that feels wrong, because if he were to figure out Castiel no longer wanted Bart, it would probably be James he would run after next.
Castiel let his gaze slide out the window, filled his lungs so full it hurt and exhaled with a long, pathetic groan. This was it.
“Is there something that’s changed? Of course, you don’t owe me an explanation,” Castiel says, running a hand through his messy hair, “but your soul is the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard, and I wonder why it’s getting harder for me to tune it out.”
thing is kind of obscure. If you want something, you deserve it. There’s nobody there to judge your previous behavior and decide for you. In cases like this, who cares what you do or what you don’t deserve? Is someone gonna come up to you and tell you ‘hey, by the way, you don’t deserve what you have right now’? And so what if someone is? Does that make your opinion of deserving less valid?”
“Happy Fourth of July,” Castiel echoes. He watches a piece of the first waffle meet Dean’s lips and enter his mouth, and he swears he’s never been this interested in anyone’s eating.
Dean looks around, trying to place the table he left before realizing it’s filled with strangers now. He does a customary glance around, but it’s pretty clear that Benny left with the angels. Instead of getting angry (which would mean being a hypocrite, he’s abandoned Benny in multiple locations because he just wanted to go home and the guy never held it against him), he feels defeated.
— and although his feet are unwilling to move, he starts pacing along the shoreline. It’s possible the person in the bushes is James, trying to see if Castiel is someone worth meeting. That would imply that James knows the shore already, though, and where to stalk him without being seen.
“Do you want to keep on driving for a while? I mean, uh, obviously I would do the driving. You would… Pretty much just sit there. I don’t know why you’d like that, but-”
He loves that it was him, out of all the attractive people around them tonight, that Dean chose to circle around. That instead of playing tactical games and taking some possible client home, he decided to end the long game of flirting and choose Castiel.
“This,” he whispers, “this is one of the reasons I’m so glad I’m finally here. I can take care of you. I can hold you when you’re afraid. You don’t know how honored I am simply to be able to do that. Of course I’ll only be here for you if you allow me, but at least know that it’d be an absolute pleasure.”
They get back inside. While waiting for Kevin to come, Castiel tries to find weatherproof clothes and ends up wearing a leaf-patterned raincoat with plaid boots. Well, it’s a good thing he doesn’t need to look romantic. He rummages through his drawers to find a couple of tasteful bracelets, and when he’s in his bedroom looking for a necklace, he hears Charlie’s voice.
“This is nice. Books and coffee. My angel friends usually only go out at night, so it’s nice to have someone to visit these places with.”
At that point Castiel had taken it as a compliment, but the next morning he remembered the words as he was putting on the bead bracelets, and decided against them from that point on.
he? Why can’t Castiel remember? He’s heard the voice before, knew it instantly on the phone on that morning he received the call --ut who does he have in his life that he wouldn’t recognize easily? Sure, he met a lot of people when he was with Bartholomew, but that seems like such a long time ago now that he doubts he would know any of those voices anymore. What reason would any of those people have to try to drive him away from the Winchesters?
“The night we met, I was at the bar to hook up with an angel. You know, for the reputation y’all have about being good in bed, whatever. I thought that was what I needed because I haven’t been able to enjoy sex since I was a teen. I get crushes, sure, but,” Dean rubs his face with his palms to hide the blush of embarrassment, “the second I think about acting on it, I get freaked out because there’s just sweat, and there’s other fluids, and there’s me wishing it was over already. I’m a guy a bit over my thirties and I can’t fucking… Well, fuck. So yeah, like I said, I’m broken.”
“As I was saying,” Rowena says, “if you can make it four months rent in advance, you've got yourself an apartment.”
He steps down from the stage and walks to her, offering her a hand to shake. Rowena looks at him, feigning being appalled, and he leans in to kiss her hand instead.
“Tea it is,” he says, blushing vigorously. Dean nods, walks to the kitchenette and hops up on the bar table.
Screw these people. Castiel wants to clean this place, from the ceiling to the floorboards, rearrange all the teas, and sleep for a week.
“No, no,” Dean says, almost frantically. He moves his other hands slowly towards Castiel, but stops short just before touching his face.
As Castiel shuffles to the shelf to grab some tung oil, he feels a pang in his chest. He exhales sharply and lets the bottle drop on the table before placing a palm on his ribs. Now, what’s this about? He’d just been happy, thinking about family, and-
in Dean’s expression as he listens to Castiel talk. No — instead, he seems like he’s enjoying himself more than he originally thought he would.
Charlie takes another sip of her drink, and then another. She looks out the window, obviously deep in thought.
Castiel groans and starts pushing their cart out the door. Alfie shouts about having a nice day for the second time, but he apparently decided it’s better not to welcome them back later.
“I want to talk to him alone,” Bartholomew says, and his voice sends shivers of disgust all over Castiel’s body. “Either I talk to him, or I don’t talk.”
But the most breathtaking of all is the couple that’s last on the delivery round. It seems like Gabriel has chosen them specially for this place; there’s a little work to be done here and there each day, such as hanging the clothes out to dry and doing the dishes, and that’s why Castiel spends extra time with these customers. It isn’t particularly included in Castiel or Gabriel’s line of work to do chores, but Gabriel had specifically asked him to help out around the house a little, so he isn’t going to argue. Besides, the stories the couple shared are some of the greatest love stories he’d ever heard.
After Stardust is over and Charlie is browsing Netflix for the hundredth time, Castiel hears his phone beep in his room. He tries to get up lazily, as if he really doesn’t mind what James’ reply will be, but then he realizes his feet automatically turn on for a power walk mode, making Charlie yelp something after him.
He can’t lie; the fact that his heart beats faster each time he thinks about Dean doesn’t exactly make him want to meet James right now. He can’t bring himself to think anything like
“Cas, no,” Dean says. His voice has gone from threatening to broken in less than a second. Castiel turns to him, and takes both his hands.
There was a part of Dean that felt like a child right now. He wanted to know what it felt like to have Castiel wrap that trenchcoat around him. He wanted to feel safe and get lost in the warmth of someone who was this intriguing to him.
Obviously, Charlie and Gilda wanted to take this opportunity to meet up with some new people, so along with a hesitant Chuck, they headed towards the address Anna had given them. She'd said she was not home tonight, but at a cottage they owned about an hour drive away. It was already dark as they started driving uphill towards the only lights to be seen around, and stars were getting brighter by the minute. With the current atmosphere, it was almost as if something was destined to happen. Silently, Dean scoffed at himself for this.
Eventually, he can leave. Sam finds him the best physical therapist in town in hopes of cheering him up. The physical therapist, a determined woman called Jody Mills, pushes him towards his limits every day until another month passes and it’s enough for them to meet twice a week.
He tries to think about nice things, or about tomorrow, but if it’s not fractals his head takes him in, it’s Bartholomew.
The silence is tense with anticipation, and Castiel decides to ease it by rolling the window all the way open. The breeze is warm, but cools down the stagnant air inside the car. Castiel leans out a bit, inhales through his nose, catching the scent of the ocean, and wild flowers, and birch trees. It’s good, but it makes him long for something he can’t remember.
“Sure, I can see if I can get a hold of our psychiatrist. You can talk with her about how to go on with this.”
Dean is standing in the middle of the room. He turns towards Castiel the second he steps over the threshold and takes a hesitant step towards him. Castiel fixes him the most murderous gaze he can gather right now, stopping Dean in his tracks.
“It’s okay. Actually, there’s a thing you could help me with. Is there someone who could help me find a psychiatrist? I’m… I’m really going through something here, and I’m barely holding on. My kettle will boil over any second now, so it’s really important for me to talk to someone.”
“I’m talking about James, of course. Don’t get me wrong, I still hate his guts and will kill him on sight, but,” Balthazar huffs and shrugs. It’s the most blessing Castiel is ever going to get out of Balthazar, so he squeezes his shoulder reassuringly.
Castiel scoffs at the nonsense James is talking, but his chest is already radiating warmth. This is what he needs. He needs someone who knows him and who can make foolish enough notions to drag him back from the cliff.
The thing is he can’t. He’s been waiting to wake up next to James for so long, dreaming of morning kisses and coffee and cuddles and hugs —
Castiel finishes his tea and places the mug on the floor. Charlie and Kevin’s emergency tea kit is really proving to be useful.
He lifts his head, letting his body turn vertical again and sure enough, there’s another clothes pile laying on the ground only a couple of feet away from his. He lowers his mouth below the water, as if that would make him invisible in the open water, and he blows nervous bubbles from between his lips as he starts gliding towards the strange pile.
It doesn’t take long before Sam returns inside. Castiel pours them both some lemon-ginger-peppermint rooibos and takes a silent seat on the floor in the middle of the large room. Sam raises his eyebrows at him, but says nothing. Eventually he takes a seat, too, and they sit there, cross-legged, listening to the silence and the birds and the starting rain.
Dean wants to hate the guy, he does. But the moment he starts dancing, he’s swept off his proverbial feet and glued to his chair in the front row. He’s classically trained, holds himself upright with ease and has the kind of fire in his movements Dean adores. And while he’s portraying Albrecht’s feelings perfectly, there’s something so personal, and so undeniably sad, in his dance it’s hard for Dean not to cry every time he’s onstage.
Castiel's heart is pounding painfully fast. He feels it in his muscles and in his ears – that ridiculous drumbeat reminder of what always has belonged to Dean, and Dean only.
Dean lifts his hands and they hover over Castiel’s shoulders, but he curls them into fists puts them down. Castiel feels the phantom touch for a while.
Castiel wakes up with a start, but as soon as he feels the heartbeat still there, he calms down. He basks in the familiar, forgotten feeling for a while before getting up, trying not to stretch before making coffee since it's, according to an article, bad for muscles. He stopped reading health articles a month or two ago, after Eileen told him it's not going to make him anything more than paranoid, but it doesn't keep him from remembering the details.
Sam laughs, raises his knee to wrap his hands around it, then lifts himself off the yoga mat in a ridiculously fluid motion. “It makes you an adventurer, maybe?”
He tries to remember the voice of the threatener. He would’ve recognized it if it belonged to Dean or Sam… Right? Of course he would have. It was the authentic, naturally flowing voice of someone possibly middle-aged.
He says it so bluntly that Dean needs to rewind in his mind to catch up. Blinking away his confusion, he sighs.
“If a customer leaves angry because of something that you did, how long would you think about that?”
With a sigh, he opens his tablet again. Alright, he knows how to work with a gmail account. It isn’t what they started with back then, but since their older email client slowly stopped offering support and died out, it was a mutual decision to make accounts on something they believed would be around in the future. Castiel isn’t sure if James actually decided to also invest in some Google stock. He’d come into to some money if he did, that’s for sure.
This makes him hesitant about what to tell his friends now. Then again, he doesn’t want to lie — it wouldn’t be fair to them, and it wouldn’t be fair to James. A part, just a tiny one that he shuts down quickly, thinks that maybe this time it’s different, that he’ll meet James.
”Alright, let's leave it at that, then. Now, about why you asked to meet me. Look... Like I said, I don't know what to tell you, here.”
There was a pause, after which the man smiled. It was barely there, more in his eyes than on his lips, but there was no mistaking it – a lighter note on his bitter demeanor. Dean returned the smile, but was sure to lower his gaze afterwards.
“Castiel,” Dean whispers, and it’s a rush because he never uses Castiel’s full name, never ever, “I am telling you the truth. You can check the the police blotter for the accident, I bet they have some data on it. Since… Since you’re good at checking shit, apparently. I really wanted to be here, and I hate that I’m this late, and I’m sorry.”
Anna was the hardest to get in contact with. She lived in New York with her brother and was really into contemporary dance and theatre, and that's why she had to keep her phone off for around 23 and a half hours a day. Dean left her some messages, to which her brother answered with cryptic emoji texts, and was already going to move onto the last person on his list when Anna finally called him back.
Instead of thinking, he's quickly absorbed in Jane's life. There are continuous plot twists, drama, and heartbreak, but they're always evened out with retribution and declarations of love. Castiel wishes he was as brave and unyielding as Jane, that he had the same sense of justice. He could well see himself in the protagonist, but considering the situation he's in now... Instead of them really bonding and becoming best friends for life, Jane would just feel sorry for him.
“The catering is here, the bartender is here, the background music playlist is set, the instruments are plugged in and tested, fireworks are ready whenever,” Meg lists. “Seats are in order, we’re ready to start this off.”
“We need to go buy decorations,” Balthazar says. “Kevin, should I leave that to you? We’re all pretty much occupied with other activities.”
. This made Castiel actually jump – never had he ever heard Dean's voice and this was an absolute disaster and it would only make everything worse and he thought he had until tomorrow to prepare for this -
“How much of your thoughts would you say are in the past? Things that have happened before, but no longer are happening?”
“Alright, I have a bottle of this ridiculous water stuff you like, and your meds are here. Give me your hand.”
"Usually, I know their first names before I get this close," he sighed. The man blushed and lowered his gaze, but then found a wave of confidence.
Balthazar nods hello from across the room as he enters, and Castiel vividly remembers his threatening message and how things around that remain unresolved. He doesn’t want to deal with it now, though, especially when it seems like he was right in the first place. It hadn’t taken long for James to hurt him, and if Balthazar found out now he’d live up to his promise to beat the living shit out of the guy. Then again, he was about to do so anyway, regardless of James’ behavior.
Something in the way Dean phrased his concern right now made Castiel's chest stir. There was a hint of
Instead, he pushes a new log into the fire and sits in front of it, watching the flames eagerly lick on the sides of pale-colored wood. He’s almost thrown by the amount of resentment that clenches his diaphragm. Why the fuck does Dean think it’s alright for him to treat Castiel like this? Doesn’t he think he deserves better? These thoughts Castiel’s brain produces for him are alien; he’s always thought humbly of himself, and demanding things even in silent form seems self-absorbed. Then, he thinks about Dean and how Dean wouldn’t like him if he was self-absorbed.
They stay like this for a couple of minutes longer, and Castiel opens his eyes. They’re under the coat racks in the main lobby, shielded from the fluorescent lights and people walking around. It’s like a blanket fortress right here in the middle of a huge school building, and the way it perfectly embodies how Castiel feels for Dean – a little piece of sanctuary in a buzzing world – almost makes him tear up.
”I'm sorry for startling you”, he said, letting go of Dean's hand, ”but I didn't know what to yell, since I don't know your name.”
”Wow,” she sighed, ”clearly, you've never left your apartment. This is what they call an aquarium. It's got live fishes in it and all. And why this place? I don't know. I like fishes. Also, I had an appointment across the street.”
“I’m not gonna demand anything, okay?” Dean huffs with a smile. “I’m just wondering about a couple of things. If you don’t answer, then you don’t. Won’t hold it against you.”
Getting the hang of yoga is one thing, but getting the hang of Balthazar’s performance plans… Well, that’s another thing entirely.
“Dean,” he starts. Dean raises his gaze over the top of his book, but isn’t looking at Castiel. “I-“
They drink tea on the table and chat about their days. Dean tries to explain just how hard it was for him to get through this week; he’s had a while to sort out his thoughts, and to chase down Zachariah, but he’s missed Castiel terribly. Castiel’s never seen him so animated, so alive — and for once in his life, he knows it’s because of him. For reasons he doesn’t fully understand, this funny, beautiful, loyal man is here; and even though no words have been said out loud, it’s obvious he loves Castiel.
“It’s possible that I’m bitter,” he sighs. Meg turns towards a box on the table and opens it to reveal chocolate inside. Shit, this is just getting better and better.
“I’ll file a report about this one. I think we need to keep watch here until they close it down from the other side.”
It'd been five years already. Back then, he'd been as happy as the rest of them – preparing a feast to welcome a new year and making all his friends fall in love with his cooking. Buying fireworks had also been his turf, while his fiancée took care of cleaning the house and arranging welcoming fires across their driveway.
Castiel leaves his bags in the corner of what will eventually be their living room. He breathes in the sea breeze that’s filled the house through the opened windows.
“There’s a time and a place for why I left, but it’s not this,” she sighs, gesturing with her hand. “We need to focus all our energy on the meeting. If you buy me a cup of coffee sometime, we can talk more. It’s all good now, though. I have a beautiful fiancee that I’m planning to marry in the summer. I’ll introduce you, she works here too.”
Castiel feels he’s the worst with distances with his eyes closed. That could be a little apart or a lot apart, for all he knew.
Dean lifted his eyebrows, but said nothing. He was instantly turned down with his fake flirting earlier, so he didn’t want to read anything flirty into what Castiel said – even though it did sound exactly like that.
Dean places his hand on Castiel’s forearm and gives it a little squeeze. Castiel’s whole existence leans into the touch, and it grounds him.
“Am I-,” for a moment, Castiel is about to point out that they’re still in the shower, but decides this not to be the perfect moment for a dry joke, “Yes, Dean. I’m clean.”
“I mean, I know what this is,” he clarifies quickly, “but I still feel his heartbeat on my ring. What the hell is going on?
“I don’t know if I’d trust me, either. I don’t know how much you know about me, but I bet it’s mostly business related.”
”I told Anna I'm leaving with you so if that's alright, I'm going to do that. And I want you to talk to me.”
. Castiel shoved the spare key to his apartment in her hand, telling her kindly she was allowed to do anything she liked, as long as he wasn’t forced anywhere.
”That's the general idea around soulmates, yes. They don't often cover other possibilities, since differences are uncommon. However, even if something is uncommon... It shouldn't mean exceptions to the rule should be ignored.”
Castiel blushes vigorously and throws the phone across the room with a yelp. No! No, that’s not a memory you take into a new friendship. That had been decidedly un-friendly behavior they’d done that night — they’d talked about what would happen when they met, and got beyond PG-rating with their vivid explanations. Then, they’d laughed at their heartbeats for a while, but it’d gotten bittersweet after that. They both felt the need to meet and the distance had never been greater.
Castiel opens his mouth to tell him he doesn’t need to feel like he owes Castiel his care — that he doesn’t need to pretend to be interesting in his well-being. Instead, the look on Dean’s face is almost naively curious. He really wants to know? Alright.
”And this ain't?” Dean gestured towards the tank opposite them, its fishes playing along some golden flowers swaying in water’s currents.
The song’s about freckles.A variety of things as well, of course, but mostly importantly freckles. Castiel knows that if performs this song, Dean will definitely consider it an invitation.
Dean takes a pancake in his hand, dips it into the cream and offers it to Castiel. While vaguely realizing he’s never been hand fed before, Castiel takes a bite of the treat. Dean leans his cheek on his free hand, and the admiration written all over his face is plain for anyone to see.
Most of the time, he fiddles with his phone. They settle into a regular chatting schedule adjusted around James’ 7 to 4 office hours, and even though they don’t talk about The Night again, it’s constantly buzzing in Castiel’s veins — he’s both eager to wipe any flirty talk off the table as soon as possible, and enthralled by the idea of taking things there. What’s the worst that can happen? Harmless flirting, according to sources that consist mostly of Balthazar, won’t result in anything bad -- and while Castiel realizes it has never been harmless before, he wants to assure that they’ve both changed.
“Well, if you’d done research, you’d know. These people are so great they were invited to cater for exclusive dinner parties and other events for the jet-set, but they were in such high demand that they finally capitulated and established this restaurant, where their best dishes are served on a regular basis. That, of course, resulted in high-class citizens getting offended because they would no longer be able to get exclusive food for their hoity-toity parties.”
“Is that a yes?” Castiel asks. Dean laughs and Castiel is sure he’s never heard it sounding that light.
Dean clenched his suitcase tighter to his side, keeping his gaze lowered as he waited for the tram. He'd closed the office for today and ignored all condolences got from his colleagues. All he had to do now was to get home, close the curtains and play some classic rock hard enough to drown the sound of fireworks. He felt like a dog.
”Then we go see some fireworks first. Then I'm making you some coffee at my place and I'd really like it if you were there.”
He suddenly feels too restless to be alone, so he puts on some pants and a t-shirt before sneaking into the living room. Charlie doesn’t look away from the screen, focused on  whatever’s going on, but she taps the couch next to her to let Castiel know he’s welcome. When he joins them, Gilda places a bowl of popcorn on his lap.
It’s seeing Dean Winchester again — he’s in the company of many, many people, but from where he stands, Castiel can see one woman in particular. It’s Bela Talbot, and of course Castiel knows her name, she’s one of the most accomplished news reporters of the city. She’s wicked smart, funny, and a quick thinker, and Castiel would’ve wanted to meet her someday. It could very well have been today… If it wasn’t for the fact that Dean’s casually holding the palm of his hand on the small of her back.
“Hello, Dean,” he said after opening the door, “please, come in. Leave your shoes at the door. Do you want sliding socks? I'm a sucker for sliding socks around the Holidays.”
Dean sighs and looks at Castiel with an expression he’s never seen before. If the way he looked at him before was affection, or even love, this is closer to
”Please do share your information with me. I'm okay with being hated, I'll have you know that, but only if I know why.”
”It’s called a STEAM school, love,” she said, ruffling his hair again, ”it’s got plenty of things besides arts and mostly it has to do with utilizing your talent in other studies. But yes, you can go there. We can get you signed up there immediately, if you wish, or you can start your school with the kids from the kindergarten first. We’ll do whatever suits you best. You're looking for a bright future with art, if you stay diligent and concentrate.”
“Cas,” he whispers, and places a little kiss right next to Castiel’s mouth, “We’re alright. We’re in no hurry. I’ve got you.”
“Yet you still seem oddly interested,” he sighs instead. They start walking along the same sidewalk as last time; this time, it’s not raining.
Everyone backstage are pretty much ready to go. They exchange a couple of nervous sentences, wish each other good luck and jump on stage. In all honesty, Castiel can’t even remember their first song — it could have been smooth jazz for all he knows. He mans the tambourine and sings background vocals for Meg, who’s had a couple more drinks than him, but still sings better than many would sober.
“True,” Castiel says and crosses his arms on the open window to lean his chin upon his upper wrist. His ears are inside, so he can hear Dean as he keeps talking.
Dean’s expression was open. There was no way he wouldn’t have said yes to anything Castiel said – and momentarily he felt bad for it. Were his dreams too much?
Such a simple thing, that nobody’s ever done for him before. He feels a pinch of anger towards all the jerks who never deemed Castiel’s panic attacks important enough to notice of or help with.
He can't concentrate. It's nagging away at him, first in his head, then on his ring finger, then in his whole body. He walks across the apartment, tries to exercise mindful breathing, and then scolds himself for failing. It's not a full panic attack, but it's anxiety that'll end up harmful if he doesn't stop it from proceeding. He knows what he needs. He needs something to yank himself away from everything.
“Hey, Castiel. Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, but could you come down to the station? We’ve got a new suspect, and he mentioned you by name.”
Dean mumbles something Castiel doesn't hear. He leaves his soon-to-be-ex-roommate to make his way out himself and heads back downstairs. People have multiplied, and it looks like there's a total housewarming party going on already. As soon as he makes his way to the kitchen again, a man approaches him.
Castiel opens his eyes and sees green. Green, freckles, lips. Beautiful. He lifts his hand and cups Dean’s face gently.
So here he is, lying on the hard floor that’s not at all softened by a sad excuse for a yoga mat, palms up, breathing shallow even though Sam points out, time and time again, that he needs to breathe with his diaphragm and not his chest. It feels bad, like choking, and Castiel hates it. He states this aloud, and Sam laughs.
The man crosses his arms, switches weight from one foot to the other, and bites his lip. His nervousness is a little annoying.
He’s glad James doesn’t tell him to consider again or ask if he’s certain, because he might have pulled the brakes. Now, he has no choice. He imagines James sitting on his couch cross-legged, focusing on his phone with that lame mug in his hand. The picture is endearing, and Castiel lets himself imagine telling the story next to him, also cross-legged with a mug, the two of them looking into each other’s eyes. That way, what he’s about to voice out won’t sound as menacing.
“You’re preoccupied,” Castiel says quietly as they near the top. “This is a huge portal. I think you’d best be prepared.”
A sense of warmth fills Castiel as he watches Dean go. No matter how many people he’s met after starting at the office, at least it looks like he’s also made a friend. Well, that might be stretching it, since Castiel can physically feel his heart try to strangle itself each time he looks at Dean – and they’re not even close enough to be called friends to begin with. If Castiel had his way, he’d never be ridiculous enough for Dean to need to make pity visits, and he’d made a move on him by now.
Castiel nods. “That’s nothing new, I’ve had my fair share of people like that. Thank you for informing me, though.”
Castiel’s fingers feel extra cold because Dean’s nervousness makes him overheat, but the instant they touch, Dean hears it. He doesn’t know what he was waiting for – probably classic rock or even a neat Mozart tune – but the instant he hears the gentle ambient melody, he wants to cry. It’s calm and strong at the same time, ambitious and simple, and it makes Dean feel, of all things,
. As he raised his gaze to meet eyes that, although full of concern right about now, were endless ponds of summer blue haze, the first thing he was about to say was
“Uh, so, anyway,” Dean goes on. “I’ve actually been thinking about something for a while now. And, uh. One of the reasons I offered my help was…”
The truth is, he knows nothing. Humans he can understand, and humans are the ones that have led both him and his partner to disappointment time and time again. Angels are a completely different matter – because of a special skill they possess.
First, he believes he’s having a seizure — vivid images pass before his eyes and it both feels and doesn’t feel like when he woke up in the hospital.
While watching the show for the 15th time in the past six months, Castiel lets his brain loop over everything that’s happened today. He tries to put the situations in boxes of good and bad so he’ll know what to avoid in the future.
”It’s just,” Castiel says, and his brain does the thing it sometimes does – completely blacks out on him, leaving him floating in a flow of semi-consciousness, and it’s this that finally makes him lift his head from the cage of his arms. Dean doesn’t ask him to finish his sentence, which makes Castiel’s stomach feel both concrete-heavy and feather-light.
When Castiel thinks back on this now, he doubts that he had been in a mental state lucid enough to give his consent. That was never even a question; he had just been desperate to get Bart’s forgiveness and when he’d deserved it, he was happy.
“You’d be surprised. If you want, I could give you a list of restaurants that are open late and offer delivery services.”
“There’s something peculiar about a human-made drink called Halo,” the man muses. “First of all, halos are not golden.”
They arrived at Dean's apartment. After getting in, Dean felt a sudden rush of nervousness run through him. He was here, alone in his apartment with the person that had been running through his mind all year and like with the kiss that was way too short, there was nothing holding them back. Castiel walked through the house slowly admiring everything he found – plants, paintings, lanterns, even curtains. Dean followed his movements for a while and decided to make a run for the kitchen. The coffee wouldn't brew itself.
“I bet,” Castiel hums, and they walk a couple of steps until they reach Balthazar, who has now stopped. For a moment, he feels his friend is going to call them out on some meet-cute nonsense, but instead, he gestures to a boat.
Maybe it’s the shame he feels about that, or the vague realization that he’s only been lying here, that gets him to act. He pulls Dean by his hand until he falls on him, their chests flush against each other, then puts his hands on Dean’s back and presses them closer, impossibly closer together. He moves his hips — their lips press together again, and he presses Dean’s hips lower and fucks him until all he can do is moan, which sounds more like yelling at this point. Castiel does notice his own throat getting sore, too, and that means he’s oblivious to his own sounds. Dean leans in to kiss him, then reaches behind him to take Castiel’s hands into his own again -- and then he’s coming all over them as Castiel twines their fingers together, and follows him right after.
“The police have them both. They’re going to go through our books, because there’s bound to be something there. Zachariah works in accounting, and probably has all kinds of buddies around the place. It makes me sick, and once again, I’m hoping I can jump ship.”
Well, it had definitely not been a good idea. It didn't take long until he'd started getting messages, anonymously delivered, into his locker. The first one he'd thought to be an accident; it was just an ad to some local church-related event considering angels, the headline being
“Hope you still got the moves, though. There’s everything at stake here,” she says, but her voice sounds carefree enough to signal that there’s no reason to stress just yet.
He needs to shock them. This is why he’s wearing glitter, this is why he’s singing the National Anthem but not the one they wanted, and this is why he visited burlesques and strip clubs and circuses.
Castiel misses binge-watching already, and it’s only been a day. It would be so easy to slide back into his habits.
“Called Kevin, he’s coming, too,” Meg informs, fuming back in the room with her hair floating behind her. She steps out to take the A-stand inside.
“Get in first,” Bartholomew said with an impatient nod. Castiel stepped over the side of the pod and stood in the middle of the thick, glue-like water.
“Hello, how may we help you,” Charlie asks with a smile of her own. She’s gazing between him and Castiel already, she knows something’s up, but she’s yet to crack who exactly she’s looking at.
Dean’s mouth falls open for a while, like he’s calculating a response that’d least likely leave him in trouble.
The calendar seems fine. There’s a couple of graduation parties at the end of May, but the bachelor party is the only thing in their immediate future. Kevin has already started to put in possible days for practice, and although Castiel feels a bit of a stab in his chest for not being able to participate, he wants to keep focusing on what he’s capable of for now. Kevin has also put in weekly order dates for the store and, via a link, Castiel ends up in a spreadsheet with default order items written in. Damn it, Kevin is handy. Did Castiel even see exactly how handy before all of this? He should promote the guy, whatever promotions there could be in a store this size. Orders executive?
Castiel lifts his face towards the direct sunlight. He’s sitting on the balcony, the flowers are all in full bloom, and he feels alive. The scents are overwhelming, and he wishes he could take them all with him to the store. He wonders where he left all the sunflower seeds and if they’ve started to grow already. Summer solstice is just around the corner, and if even some of them took root, they should start pushing through cracks in the pavement and parks soon enough.
“Wow, no,” Balthazar says, “I... See, Castiel? She's been taking good care of us while you've been gone.”
Castiel glances at the clock. Half past two. Apparently, not even his therapist is a healthy sleeper.
A splash from somewhere behind interrupts his lazy meditation. Frowning, he turns around only to see the man from before--now fallen into the river and floundering around furiously. Castiel rolls his eyes, and although every cell in his body tells him to just continue, good riddance, he walks up to the man.
“You don’t need to tell me. I was swimming and you fell from the sky. No, wait. You aren’t a star, are you?”
”I am not putting on anything you're asking me to. I know your taste in costumes and I hardly feel like dressing up as a stripper version of the devil.”
Castiel groans out loud and gets up. He hears the cozy clinking of dishes in the kitchen, and for the second morning in a row, he thinks briefly of what it would feel like if someone he loves was preparing a breakfast for him.
As they head back to the car, Castiel picks a couple of freshly fallen pine branches from the ground. They’d make a good tea for tomorrow.
“Don’t worry. I made sure nobody had any idea. I was determined to make it out alone. Of course, I didn’t, but that’s why I ended up meeting Dorothy, so. Not all bad, huh?”
“I said watch me,” he hums, since Dean’s still looking at him oddly. He kisses him again, letting Dean go along with it this time, and savoring the feeling of his hands gripping his waist. He’s mildly embarrassed now that he realizes the chenille bathrobe doesn’t equal to having pants, but he can’t really mind when Dean’s palms find their way on his thighs, gently caressing his skin. He slides his hands up Dean’s neck and into his beautiful, still damp hair, and pulls gently. Dean moans and opens his mouth to deepen the kiss, to which Castiel happily obliges. He feels Dean’s hands move up his hips and under his robe and all the way to his back, and he tries to both lean into the touch and press closer to Dean.
Mary Winchester was a reasonable mother. She didn't have unrealistic expectations when it came to his two sons – she was content with whatever they wanted to do with their lives. It was up to them to figure out what professional journeys they'd want to embark on, and whether they'd bring home a boy or a girl or something in between. All she wanted for her sons was for them to be happy.
Since he now was no longer tapping his phone, Gabriel took his opportunity knowing it might take ages for the next window to appear.
“My heart is broken,” Castiel finally whispers. Dean wants to hug him, but he doesn’t; he doesn’t want to invade Castiel’s personal space.
The voice belongs to a boy. He’s at least two years younger than Castiel and his voice is only starting to change. He gets up from his bench under a tree and walks to offer Castiel a hand.
“Cas,” Dean hears himself say, but Castiel shushes him, and it’s both really gentle and really possessive and Dean loves it way too much. He’s quickly getting hard and he has around a second to figure out whether that’s going to be a problem before Castiel gets up and straddles him. He spreads his fingers on Dean’s chest and slowly grinds down against Dean.
“What? Found someone? Come on, I went for like three dates with the guy. Nothing ever came out of that.”
“So, hamburgers,” Castiel says, mainly to break the silence. He takes a blini in his hand and scrutinizes it. Smells of fresh salmon, but is in pate form.
“I bet you can get away with a little immaturity, though. From what I’ve gathered, you saved the company after your father passed.”
”I see,” Dean said. He felt hollow down to his stomach, he could relate to this. Art, for him, was always supposed to be about the fun and the experience and the joy of it. Instead, for a while, it had barely been a means to make a living and please people such as Mr. Mosby that he, in all fairness, did not even care for that much.
”It's good,” Dean assured, ”at least there's something else to think about than my own problems for a change.”
“I’m glad you were mistaken,” Castiel hums. Charlie grabs her stuff, gestures for him to follow and heads to the rear of the stage that leads into the back rooms.
Castiel pushes his plate away from him, burger half-finished. “Don’t you tell me what I went through was impossible.”
Towards the afternoon, the fog cleared. Dean had been kind enough to give Castiel some time to assemble his thoughts, but his patience was running thin. He drove to a parking lot of some seemingly random gas station and tapped the wheel.
”It's a story for a situation without”, Dean dodged a laughing group of people that owned the street, ”all these people around.”
Castiel gave Dean a mug he had been holding, and a whole variety of spices immediately filled Dean's nose. He sighed in contentment, but switched quickly to nervous as he saw the expression Castiel had. He looked... guilty?
“I’m glad you finally came to your senses and got us a big name,” Balthazar says, basically purring, before reaching out his hand for Castiel to shake. “I’m honored to make your acquaintance.”
Strippers are, in Castiel’s books, some of the most intriguing and talented dancers there are. Using only a couple pieces of clothes, they have to seem interesting enough for people to want to pay them. To appear confident even when portraying the epitome of what’s considered “bad” among the conservatives… That’s definitely something Castiel could take a lesson or two from. After all, he’ll probably be upsetting many conservatives in a couple of days.
By the amount of matter-of-factness in his voice, Dean seemed to really have thrown him off his game for a moment. Not that there was a game going on, per se...
Castiel used to always stay in the store through the opening hours. Does someone still stay throughout the day? Is that even necessary? He dreads the thought that they’ve been doing so well without him. Of course, it’s a blessing to have such a good staff, but what if they realize they were better off? In the back of his mind Castiel knows he’s the boss of the establishment and could fire them all if they bad-mouthed him, but he would never do that. They are family, and the fact they’ve been patient enough to wait for him through these times speaks in higher volumes than words can.
“Left you a note at the coffee machine, but you’re clearly too busy with that masterpiece. Anyway, the note didn’t say why I was away. So here goes.”
“Oh, this is nice,” Castiel says, his hands around a steaming mug of coffee. “And you get to take this wherever you go?”
“I only now realized that’s something I want to do. I… kind of have a crush on you. So,” he’s losing his bravery fast – he looks down and kicks some pebbles off the cliff. “In case you’re wondering what makes my soul sound like whatever it sounds like, that’s probably it.”
“Yes, there’s a highly active portal between heaven and earth in here. Angels are coming and going faster than you can imagine. I was asked to find out whether this is something that needs to be solved, but if humans can’t see the portal, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about.”
Even though all of his senses are burning up and dissolving, there's something off. It's like there's a time bomb ticking somewhere in his body – tick-tick, tick-tick, tick-TICK! - and it deepens Castiel's anxiety. What's this sensation? While his feet are still taking him around the apartment, he's trying to feel around his body, head, shoulders, knees, and toes, but panic swoops over him again and makes him groan.
Alright, the tagged brief suicidal thought below. If that feels like too much, skip paragraphs 4 and 5 starting with "When" and "He's".
“It’s because Rowena told them not to,” Sam says, lowering his gaze slightly, “I’m sorry. She sent you a thousand kisses and told me to not allow you to come. She said it’d mess up the group dynamics, but since it’s the last performance, I say fuck it. You’re going to want to see it.”
Sam nods. “Why haven’t you told me about him before? We have these heart-to-hearts on the patio, yet you’ve failed to tell me you’re… dating?”
He scoffs at the way his head is obviously trying to distract him from the upcoming reckoning. Well, it could be reasonable to hide in his favorite childhood memories after this conversation; a little less reasonable to hide behind a memory of Bartholomew.
”I will be holding you on to that”, Castiel said, lowering his voice since they were approaching Charlie and Anna again, ”that's a promise.”
It’s summer solstice, and they’ve been looking through their budget estimations that are, surprisingly, pretty much exactly what they’d guessed they would be. Before signing contracts with all their vendors, they decide to call it a night. Since neither Balthazar or Meg came there in a car and Castiel didn’t bring any cash (and to be frank, he’s still hesitant about public transport), Dean offers to drive him home.
Once or twice, Castiel inhaled and leaned in a notch – as if he remembered a good anecdote and felt like sharing it. When he rested his eyes on Dean’s face, though, he retreated with haste. Dean was in no mood for jokes; he had just bailed on his family for Castiel.
Castiel lifts his gaze to see Meg walking from the Daily Blend table slowly, so she could bolt the door in case the going got too tough.
Dean turns and looks at Castiel, who pretends not to notice it for a while, but it gets a bit creepy eventually.
He checks his reflection and he does look better, albeit still too weak-looking. He decides it’s time to grab a full breakfast, and with the thought of oat muffins and oranges in his mind, he leaves his home without even thinking about how crossing the threshold wasn’t always this easy.
“I seriously hope so. I’ll gladly take it for a spin. Also, I wouldn’t want to miss your Nonsense Blend, so I’ll have an ounce of that as well.”
His thoughts are quickly reorganized when he realizes the heartbeat on his ring is accelerating. He tries not to think of himself as the smug type, but there’s just no way James’ heart would be fluttering at a time this convenient if it wasn’t for his message.
For a while, it’s silent. Castiel feels a bit offended about Charlie’s sudden interest in other things that aren’t him — now that he’s on top of the dam and it’s about to crumble under him and he’ll drown, he would like to be seen. He
Castiel. “I’m sorry I came on too strong and asked you questions without believing the answers you gave me.”
In two weeks, all of their stuff is in the apartment. The attic becomes a geek cave, and since they only need one bedroom, the other one becomes an office. For Christmas, Castiel buys Dean slippers and a bathrobe that he refuses to take off for the next week and a half.
himself for allowing this to happen to him again, and it being the same person for the second time must be a fucking record in how gullible someone can be.
“I won’t,” Sam sighs, “although I would very much like to. So, you don’t deserve it. What’s the problem, then?”
“Nice to meet you. You don’t happen to know anything about me? I mean… I know how I got here, but after that, it’s a bit of a blur. Specifically, I would like to talk to the nurse that was in contact with the man who brought this ring for me.”
“I obviously don’t mean anything by this now, and when we’re in an Icelandic geysir and I’m proposing to the most beautiful babe in there, you’re going to pretend you’re surprised. I just don’t want you to die not knowing that I mean to do that.”
As Dean plummeted deeper into pessimism, he noticed someone joining his shelter. A man shook his arms clear from water and groaned loudly.
“I want you to know that I really want us to be, uh, exclusive. We didn’t talk about that yet. I want to be your boyfriend.”
Castiel glanced over at Dean. He was concentrating hard on both the road and what Castiel was telling him and it made his face strained. Maybe they should pull off the road for a while.
“Then just, man… Look. Talk to me. Have I done something to upset you? Well, it’s sort of obvious that I did, but don’t shut me out like this.”
“It’s okay, you can say it,” Castiel whispers. He tries not to think about what’s to come next — that Dean’s waiting for the other person he has feelings for? That they need to break up anyway? He bites his lip to stop himself from thinking about the worst possible outcome.
“I’m dying,” Dean whispers, looking out the window on the far end of the hallway they’re standing in. “I’ve been dying since the day I met me.”
“You can wait right outside the door,” Bartholomew adds to the others, “if the pig squeals, you come help. Including you, wannabe Hulk.”
throwing a red sequin dress on the floor, making sure he wouldn't get anywhere without changing into it right there, in front of everyone and a video camera -
“Sure. Let’s have something to eat,” Castiel says and answers the smile crossing Dean’s features with his own.
The combination has Castiel intrigued. It’s refreshing to meet someone who sees him as something else besides Castiel Novak, the
How is he going to explain that to Dean? How is he going to answer his eventual query of “Why do you dislike flying? Are you afraid we’re going to fall?”
“I can’t sleep, I can’t remember when I last ate something that wasn’t… Well, tea, and my head’s a mess like never before. I’m trying to keep up to date with things, but honestly? All I can feel is fear, and oh, Sam, I am afraid. I’m not ready for any of this.”
Could he want to express his interest in Castiel? It feels overwhelming to even think about, but there’s a part of Castiel’s brain that really wants this; he really needs to not feel like he’s not going to choke when he sees Dean, or touches him, or leaves him tiny pieces of a lifeline.
“Well, I don’t know about you, but for me, three hundred people on a single boat sounds like a safety hazard.”
“You don’t have to tell me,” Balthazar says, shaking his head, “at my previous apartment, my neighbor was a veteran.”
“Of course I trust you, or we wouldn’t have made a deal; but since I don’t know you as well as my brother does, I’m worried.”
Needless to say, he’s desperate. That’s why he’s willing to see the last option through and have sex with someone who knows perfectly what he wants. Now if he just could get his mindset right – that it’s nice to meet people and chat with them, and that he’s a handsome person who could land a date.
Dean can’t lie. He’s already given up on the possibility of ever seeing a portal. He’s thought that either Castiel severely overestimates humans or just drags Dean along because he feels sorry for him – after all, Dean must have looked a number when they first met. All of that slips from his mind the instant they’re up on the roof.
“Next one’s on your balls, if you can’t behave,” she states and offers the Winchesters the best smile she can with her limited happiness capability. “Sorry. We’re professional, I swear.”
Castiel could really get used to this feeling, but the phone returns him to reality. He lazily rises up and pad to the bar table on which his work phone is buzzing violently.This time he recognizes the number.
Castiel looks at him with mirth in his eyes. “I don’t have time for this shit. You’re not going to believe me anyway. I am done with you. Rest assured, I will find a new group to dance with.”
“I think I’ll only need the number. Since we can pretty much deduce where and when the picture was sent…”
“Well, high horses don’t pay the bills,” Rowena huffs. “Besides, Castiel’s every bit the artist I am, despite his name. This is all just bantering, dear. Please don’t think I consider you anything else than extraordinary.”
He snorts at this line of thought, and it echoes in the empty bathroom. Well, maybe not perfume. He’s not sure how it would fit along with party planning and tea in the long run. But the thought of him actually planning things again… It makes him feel almost joyful.
Something in Dean’s eyes flashed, and not for the first time during today, he almost said something before thinking better of it.
“Last I saw him, he went up. Be careful, though. Don’t want to dive head-first to pick you out of the ocean.”
Sleep makes Castiel feel like a completely new person – although it does take him all evening and night. He wakes up just in time to get walking for his Friday classes. His bike is hopefully still parked where he left it yesterday, and he can take it back in the afternoon.
Charlie lowers his gaze to his fingers on the table, as if she’s only now realizing she’s doing something with them.
“That’s my boy!” she yells in his ear and slaps his back before pulling away. “I knew you’d come to your senses.”
”Look, I know I might sound like a creep because I keep on contacting you over something like this, but I promise you, I am not.”
“Gladly,” Castiel hums. He squeezes Dean’s hands before letting them go, and bites his tongue so he wouldn’t ask about the kiss. This is what Dean wanted in the morning during their first time too; he already had his foolish way of handling things, he should give Dean his.
He’s suddenly seems hesitant to look back at Castiel. A dread fills Castiel’s stomach — what exactly has he gotten himself into?
“No, we’ll leave it to you. But yeah, fireworks would be great. You can hire whoever you see fit to take care of external services, and we’ll happily pay whatever they want.”
“That’s enough, thank you,” Castiel says, trying to make his voice sound dominant, “please shut up.” He turns to the Winchesters. “I swear, we’re better.”
Maybe he'd be alright, no matter how this journey turned out in the end. Maybe he'd find what he was looking for – a muse, inspiration, a new set of eyes – even if he didn't find a soulmate. Maybe Mother Nature was his soulmate and that's why simpler life intrigued him in the first place.
Castiel worked on the knots in his lower back, moving up to his trapezius muscles first between his shoulder blades, then up the back of his neck. Dean was pretty sure Castiel said something at one point, but he either didn't expect for him to answer or realized Dean was too far gone to make coherent words, let alone sentences. All his focus was moved to Castiel's hands, his thumbs gracefully gliding across his skin, finding each painful spot and rendering it a warm, buzzing, love-filled-
“Well, lanterns. If I could decide my dream romantic venue, the gazebo would have… lanterns, or light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.”
Unlike last year, there was no fear of missing the last tram – the city had decided to expand their schedules during the holidays. Dean wanted to tell Castiel everything. How he loved to take the tram to work because it allowed him more time to think; how he never drove inside the city anyway, because fellow travelers could not be trusted near his beloved Impala; how he kind of wanted to move out of his apartment into some better and newer hoods and how much time he actually spent daydreaming of this moment. Instead, they traveled in a comfortable silence, still holding hands and occasionally laughing in silent unison at something that was going on around them. If someone from Dean's office were to see him now, he'd be labeled a childish romantic forever. He wouldn't even have minded.
“Yeah,” Dean says, “along with some supplies for them. He was about to come tomorrow, but he couldn’t wait.”
Today, it’s meatloaf day. Castiel starts by chopping onions and carefully crying so he won’t ruin the goods. It’ll take a good half an hour to get enough onions for the amount of food he needs to make, but he agrees with Anna — frozen, chopped onions taste like garbage compared to freshly cut ones.
He regrets every second that passes from him tapping “Send” to the check marks turning blue, indicating James having seen the message.
The best part of the day is that while they play, all their arguments and differences of opinion are forgotten. They concentrate on getting some of the details right, and adding some flair to their strong points to pull attention away from the weaker moments. At some point, Chinese takeout  arrives and they sit on the floor in a semi-circle, enjoying dinner and some light topics. After that, they try for couple more songs (Kevin decides to take on a rap song because he loves putting words in a rhythm for some reason) and then pack up their stuff.
”No, it's fine,” Dean assured, ”I don’t think we’d be continuing anywhere tonight anyway. We can head to New Jersey tomorrow.”
That changes something. Was it the nickname? Was it him pathetically pleading? Dean doesn’t know, but Castiel’s expression turns softer, almost kind. It makes Dean’s heart bang against his ribs.
”I am so grateful”, she put emphasis on every word, ”you have no idea. She could have taken off with anyone and I'm glad it was you.”
”It would do you well to pay attention. I clearly stated that our relationship ended weeks ago. I have no hard feelings. She deserves someone more suitable for her. We just didn’t match.”
Dean’s closer now, and he can hear the portal – it’s high-pitch, nothing pleasant, a sound that he’s heard many times after a rock concert. He takes a step back and looks at Castiel.
“It was not just me, then. I did see Eileen get weird around Sam but I thought it was just out of politeness.”
“Sure,” Castiel answers. Is he upset? Why is it so hard to read his expression? To be honest, he does remember how much he wanted to kiss Dean when he was riding the high of the performance, and that hasn’t fully evaporated yet… But it seems like Dean is all business and no play now, and Castiel needs to play by his rules since he’s the one who pays for the party.
Dean doesn’t show up for the next class. First, Castiel is grateful – he doesn’t want to hear him try to apologize to make Castiel feel better about himself. That’s exactly what he’d do, too; Dean doesn’t want to hurt anyone and would probably do anything to make Castiel feel better.
Except he isn’t here to return anything. His expression is pained, and he looks at Castiel like there’s a floodgate about to open inside him.
“Of course! I wouldn’t lie like this. Seriously, you need to get to know me better if you think I would lie to you.”
”It's up to you,” Anna said, and there was something in her eyes that seemed just a bit playful, ”I kind of have been planning breakfast already, but like I said, it's up to you.”
The man who’s been threatening him is in the same building right now. Possibly even in the same room. Most likely looking at him right now, waiting for him to make his move.
Surely enough, Castiel hadn’t needed a child. He’d felt appalled at the mere thought. It had taken another near-death experience before he understood Dean was
Before the class ends, Castiel’s migraine is in full swing. He can barely see; the fluorescent lights in the room are melting his retinas and the perfume someone’s wearing a couple of rows back is torching his nostrils. The more he moves the more hammers pound his skull from the inside, and when he feebly realizes he’s not going to be able to see his way out of this class, he breaks into an anxiety sweat as well.
They chose songs that are both easily recognizable, and ones that Castiel can use to get some of the same edge the Winchesters were looking for when they first hired them. His nerves seem to get the best of him — they’re doing the Imagine Dragons mash-up of Blank Space/Stand By Me and his voice falters more often than it doesn’t. He’s lucky to have someone like Meg in the team; she reads him like an open book and joins singing to balance out some of Castiel’s nervousness.
Guilt and yearning both burn in Castiel’s throat. More than anything in the world, he wants to -- but Dean’s words about not wanting a relationship hang heavy in the air, and Castiel remembers Dean’s not
Castiel’s fingers twitch in an attempt to touch Dean, but he forces them into his fist instead. He needs to understand why Dean is upset. He
And if Castiel thought just being around Dean was fireworks, this was the inside of an electric hurricane – Dean's soft and warm and soap-bubble tasting lips pressed firmly against his and right there, under the silver willow tree and lanterns and Halloween night, he was pretty sure his angel just showed him Heaven. As they slowly parted, Dean took Castiel's hand and traced his wrists with his fingertips before he slid the glowstick back into place. This time, Castiel felt sure enough to go through the thought he'd had before; this felt like commitment.
“We’re a big company and we’d have the money to get anyone, really,” Dean proceeds, “but we want to support local. Sam has been doing the scouting for me so far, and luckily you happened to be out on a job on one of my rare free nights. We already told Castiel our requirements for the contract.”
After Charlie leaves for a Starbucks run, Castiel presses the nurse call button. It takes a mere minute for someone to arrive.
Of course he’s a bit disappointed about the unavoidable change in their pace for today, as he’d like to have Charlie to himself since she’ll only be here for such a short amount of time — but he can’t bear the thought that he’s become so selfish, so needy and desperate. It’s as if he exists less when nobody is around, and having people around justifies his actions.
Castiel has to lower his phone for a moment because he’s feeling emotionally overwhelmed. Embarrassment, nervousness, happiness, and confidence all roam through his veins and he doesn’t know which to grab onto first.
Castiel frowns. “Alright, I’m done with my conversation with Naomi. They should be here in an hour or two. I do have another personal question, though, to replace the first one.”
And they talked for hours. Dean went through the motions of that New Year's Eve for the first time in six years. It was impossibly hard and made him cry a thousand times but Castiel was patient, letting him use his leg as a pillow and stroking his hair. They drank coffee with some kicky liquor, laughed at inappropriate things and kissed – kissed until they vaguely knew what the other tasted and felt and thought and sounded like – until there was nothing but the humming, blinding, piercing, resonating silence that felt more like love than not many things before had.
It’s almost a clear night. The weather is getting colder and colder, and little fragments of snowflakes swoosh in the wind, glittering until they hit Castiel’s face to melt away. The motion detector lights turn on as Castiel walks down the narrow path hidden by a layer of soft, untouched snow, and when he steps into the shed filled with ready-cut firewood, he’s almost sure he hears a sound unfamiliar to the silence of the woods. Straightening up, he listens until he’s sure nothing more is going to happen and proceeds to pack a basket full.
The kettle clicks. Castiel tries to inhale again, this time succeeding a little better. Dean smiles at him encouragingly and lets him go.
Castiel felt he could set off flying right about now – like a caged bird version of a helium balloon. Gently, he leaned in to remove Dean's mask. In the dim light of the furthest lanterns, he could see constellations of freckles across his face and had to force himself to stop so he wouldn't kiss some of them. Of course, he hadn't completely forgotten about the angel costume, but for now, he decided to make it work.
The email is from Charlie and it takes Castiel’s feelings for a rollercoaster ride that he hasn’t endured in months — first, he’s angry at himself for not logging out, for some reason, then, he’s disappointed it isn’t from James, and then he’s happy to hear from his old friend.
”Bygones”, Castiel sniffled, looking up at the first stars that were visible through the thick cloud blanket that had occupied the skies earlier. It wasn't bygones, Dean knew that, but they'd have time to talk.
. But now those eyes were fixated on the kid still up on Dean's shoulders and although Dean would have
It’s James’ watch. Castiel’s ears start ringing and he can feel the easiness of his mood fade fast. He replays the conversation in his head, and tries to hear this coming from James, and then Dean again, and he thinks of James Dean, and then The Night.
“In the attic,” Castiel replies. “He's really looking forward to making that a nerd center. I'd prefer it as an office.”
He opens the door to see Jody Mills, but before talking to her, he turns and locks eyes with Bartholomew.
He makes it home around seven, which is the prime time for evening sunlight on the balcony. Instead of chamomile he lands on licorice peppermint, which rolls in his mouth in that perfect manner no other tea can, and with his tablet in hand he steps into the middle of his flowers. The perfect bloom is still up — and his head instantly tells him that Dean would look great in here — and since nothing needs watering, he calls Charlie instantly.
“Right,” Mills says as she takes Castiel’s phone, taps it a couple of times and returns it with a curt nod. “Listen, Mr. Novak. You let me know immediately if someone threatens you again. You let me know what you were doing, who you were with, and whether the number is the same. Is this clear?”
He’d made the same decision with James, as well. Very early on, as they started to get closer to each other, he told James he didn’t want to talk about family. James had understood it immediately, and wanted nothing more than to make Castiel comfortable. Many people after that had either complied or ignored his wish, and it was always a 50-50 chance with new people.
No matter how calm Castiel feels about the party after talking to James, all anxiety returns instantly when they step in through the revolving doors of Winchester, Inc.
As it reaches the bridge, he has a moment to prepare for the wing expansion. He goes through the lyrics carefully, making sure to keep them both in tune and intact; the song has a lot of lyrics to begin with and the arrangement they’ve done — moving from the chatty style the original singer has to something more lyrical — is not making it easier.
So hoping both that Dean is an ass and that he’s not, he steps into the caterer’s restaurant. It’s rush hour, but they’ve been reserved a table by the window.
“I wouldn’t know, it all seems so hazy and odd right now. While I was following you, I had time to think about all of this, and—”
Silence and darkness he could deal with. Those he had known many times before in this tank. What was different, though, was that this time, something heavy was placed on top of the lid; Castiel was pretty sure the only large, but portable thing in the next room was a nightstand on its way to be repainted. No matter how hard Castiel banged his fists against the lid and yelled, Bartholomew didn’t let him out. The panic rang in his ears and stiffened his neck until he couldn’t fully turn his head anymore, and he kept on shaking his hands because they started to feel they didn’t belong to him. Stones and nails surged inside his bloodstream, and all of his senses were telling him that he was going to die here.
“They need company,” Dean says, answering the question not yet asked. “Now, before you say anything-“
With a stretch, he gets up and pockets his phone after answering James with a monocle emoji. He should know what Castiel thinks it means, and it’s
Dean is punctual. Castiel opens the door at 7pm sharp, and the smell of pizza overwhelms him. He can’t really remember when Dean learned his favorite pizza – cheese, avocado, chicken, green pesto, and mozzarella – but in the six months they’ve been working together, he’s never got it wrong. Casually, as if he’s here every other day instead of this being his third visit, he saunters into the open plan kitchen, drops the pizzas on top of the counter and proceeds to the living room.
Dean is surprised by his sudden boldness, but it’s like a dam has broken inside of him – right now, on this couch with Castiel, he realizes he doesn’t have to know anything. He has made no promises to Castiel, and Castiel still wants to be here, and that in itself makes him feel a strange sense of freedom.
“Yes,” Castiel says. “Yes to all of those. Heaven is whatever you want it to be. For some people, it’s people sitting on a cloud behind pearly gates. For some, it’s a never-ending party or a giant city where you and all your friends live. Depends on your belief, really.”
First, it’s the wings, exponentially growing in all directions — bloating, stretching, disproportionating indefinitely. Castiel tries to gently focus on something else, something beautiful instead, but as he thinks of the flowers in his balcony they start to bend out of shape behind his eyelids. He’s too tired to open his eyes for long, so he only blinks them open, hoping the in-between state of asleep and awake will dissipate into full, pleasant, dreamless sleep.
They sit at a camping table that’s been filled with tags in all colors. Tons of food is placed on the table, and after that it’s basically a chopstick war. Castiel’s gone on the deep-fried chicken pieces as well as the noodles, and he hoards them in his mouth, making Dean laugh in a way he’s not sure if he’s ever seen. Despite the boiling of his blood as he craves Dean’s touch, he tries to return the smile -- but it’s hard to do around the food.
his pal sitting on a rocking horse, smiling without his front teeth in front of a cheap Western backdrop. Other than that, he had no idea what the guy looked like and he didn't really want to think about this because it raised his affection level for Dean onto a whole new level of creepy.
It didn’t take long for the image to start forming in Castiel’s head. He was adamant about making it a 4th of July cruise, and a big one at that — with a total headcount of 300, a small boat wouldn’t be enough. Balthazar set off searching for a cruise ship for them immediately, and Meg wanted to get the bartender, because she’d have to pull all her strings to score a good one in such a short timeframe. They let Castiel head home for the day, since he probably had a lot on his mind, and they were both right and wrong about that.
“Please, Balthazar,” Castiel says calmly and turns to Sam, “we’ve been working hard on this, and that’s what’s getting on his nerves.”
Castiel shrugged, and took a bottle of dark turquoise liquid from the shelf. Then, he reached for another bottle, a pastel pink one.
his brain supplies and instantly follows up with a right hook punch of guilt that he’s feeling anything for someone that isn’t James. James, who just the other day told him he’s smitten. That should answer the prayers Castiel doesn’t even remember making; the prayers of him wishing James would return to him and love him again.
He knows the lecturer is still talking, but it’s coming from underwater somewhere. He should be writing all of this down and he hates himself for it. He knows he has both Advil and Imitrex in the locker that he just was in front of – while fully aware he was about to get a migraine– but there’s no way he can just get up and get those now. He’ll ask Dean to do that after class, if he makes it that far alive.
As soon as Castiel starts mashing the potatoes, he feels shivers run down his spine. Instinctively he looks around, only to see he’s still alone. He raises his hand to his forehead to see if he’s coming down with a fever that’d explain the ongoing chills, but feeling nothing alarming he turns back towards his food. However, the more he thinks about the situation and his surroundings the more he feels like he’s being watched.
“And eventually, the vet would have to put them down anyway, since they couldn’t stay at the office for good. That’s where we came in.”
Dean’s suggestion turns out to be trolling the MMORPG environment. They take comfortable seats on Castiel’s bed and log into the server. Since they’ve got nothing to lose with their recently made accounts, they goof around with one of them; they try to join groups and get thrown out, ask simple questions about how the place or the weapons work, and move around with only dodge rolls and slow walking. By the time someone yells at them for standing in the way of a sniper, they’re laughing so hard Castiel’s seeing stars and Dean is rolling on the bed, coughing.
As he lowers his hands, his eyes meet Dean’s and only then does he realize Dean, too, is holding a kitten.
Castiel nods. He feels a curiosity towards Dean more than anything else — including annoyance — and since it’s been a long time since he felt anything like that towards a stranger, he’s willing to keep on. He wants to ask what the reason is behind Dean choosing Castiel to vaguely insult and randomly chat with, and he wants to tap into the sadness emanating from him and find the source of it.
“Well, that’s one of the reasons, sure. But we’ve been working hard and everything is coming together… somewhat. That reminds me, I really need to practice my performance before I can pull off some of the tricks Balthazar has cut out for me.”
“Ah, and you left them in the car, you sly fox. Alright, go fetch them and I'll start filling the tub.”
“It’s interesting to see how well your dynamics work with Baz,” Dorothy says, finally coming to Castiel for a firm handshake. “He’s the diva.”
”Oh I know. So. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be the only one with a halo tonight. Some may even have wings. How are you planning to deal with that?”
”I… Uh. Can I have a seat? Charlie saw you earlier and she told me what kind of a bird to look for out here.”
As it turns out, it’s a lucky strike that he’s sitting and Dean is standing — because when Dean notices Castiel struggling, he comes close enough to block his view and slowly lifts his hands to Castiel’s ears. His vision is filled by the presence of Dean, just his breathing and heartbeat and scent. It doesn’t stop him from shaking, but the overwhelming sense of safety helps him get through.
”Oh man, is there? The feeling of ’sure, this person is important to me and I want them around’ versus the feeling of your guts melting at the thought of being with someone?”
He turned around to grab something from the floor. It was a large box of chocolate meringue. Thoughtfully, Bartholomew opened the lid and took one, scrutinizing it between his fingertips with a quiet ‘hm’.
“Because when we were inside, I made a promise to myself to tell you as soon as we leave that apartment that it was not a fake kiss for me. It was not a fake kiss, or fake affection, or fake touching, or fake fucking anything, Dean.”
The air between them had lifted momentarily, because excellent food is prone to do so, but as they returned to the vehicle with takeaway coffees in hand, the heaviness returned. They had now travelled for a good couple of hours, only talking about food and weather and bikers, really – The Unsaid was still there between them, steady and looming. Apparently, Dean had had enough of it now.
“Thank you, Baz,” he says. A fire eater blows out a giant flame just then, so they’re both pulled back into the act.
Dean’s voice, as he starts singing again, is almost physical. It wraps around Castiel and makes it feel like a galaxy is cocooning him. This is
He presses his cheek against Dean’s chest, and it’s a little awkward until Dean lifts his head to place his jaw on top of Castiel’s head. The shower is still whooshing around them, a small, private rain. Here, Castiel lets himself think about what he’d really want from a one night stand.
As they emerge from the restaurant, Castiel feels his anxiety rising. There was something in the chocolate meringue that reminded him of last Christmas, and the absolute rock bottom he was at back then. Before he can tell his mind to shut it, the tremors of a panic attack are running wild throughout his body, making him bend over and then squat. He thinks Dean says something, but he cannot hear it through the ringing and rustling in his ears. He presses his eyes closed when he feels a hand gently push him back until he sits right there on the asphalt of the parking lot. He hears his breath sputter and his heart trying to escape all his limbs at once, and for a while it engulfs him completely.
Sam looks at him for a while before smiling. “I’m proud of you. Not only have you learned to think about deserving something in the first place, you’ve learned to realize that you deserve better than being treated like this.”
Dean responded with an emoji that represented an information desk clerk and Castiel had, after a lot of confusion, already found out it was mostly used for a whole other purpose. He sent an emoji of a peach to put emphasis on the assbutt. Before they could get further into an emoji fight, Gabriel called Castiel over – it was time to dress up.
”I know you, Cas. Don’t you dare underestimate me. There’s something below the surface that you’re not telling me.”
“After my dad found out about my relationship, I had to… I had to end it. It hurt like hell, but it must have hurt that much worse for the person I left, because I never got the chance to explain what happened. All I managed to do was send one last email to let him know I was okay.”
“Is this for a Christian god, or what’s the main religion here? If you don’t mind me asking, that is.”
“Well, we’ve got that in common, then. I liked to be on my own, too, whenever it was possible. For me, though, it always included Sammy. We were always together.”
Holding the self-righteous centerpiece spot of the living room instantly to their left was a 30-feet Christmas tree. It was made out of white, luminescent plastic, and had graceful golds and browns for decoration. Lights were twinkling behind the ornaments and branches, giving off a homely glow to the rest of the room.
After a while, it started to get too hot. It was not the game per se – it wasn't like they were teenagers and playing a kissy version of this. Instead, they had the version of truths and dares to go with it and talked for way too long with each question. There just wasn't much ventilation in the small cottage, and having a lot of people and a lot of fires inside it was not helping. So, after Dean decided he'd been sitting there long enough, he excused himself through the back door.
“My shitty brother wants me to go get some supplies from the southeast,” he starts, “you wouldn’t be interested in coming with me?”
Castiel knows he should think about what he was told today. He knows he'll need to start taking responsibility of The Non-Partisan Tea Party, since it's his labor of love and he's the CEO. His friends are being unfairly patient with him, and he's pushing his luck already.
Oh, fuck. That sounds like Dean Winchester. It’s like the universe is thinking ’how much further could this guy make a fool of himself?’ and sees a challenge.
“She’s dressed like a slut, that’s for sure. You wouldn’t dress like that if you weren’t looking to fuck.”
Castiel nods, gestures towards the door and starts walking across the stage. The man catches up to him.
Dean pulls back, but not before enveloping him in one more warm and intense suck. Castiel’s muscles are failing on him and trembling even though he isn’t using a lot of them. Every inch of his skin is screaming in pleasure, and he’s aching to feel Dean on top of him, kissing him, touching him with those beautiful hands of his. He feels a twinge of sadness when Dean lets go of his hand, but quickly recovers when a hand brushes along his stomach and one of his sides. Dean reaches into the side table to grab a condom and lube from the drawer there, his other hand never leaving Castiel’s skin.
Over burgers, they talked about the city, mostly. Castiel has lived here for all his time on earth (and Dean can only guess how long that is) and he shared stories of some burger places he loved that no longer exist. Dean half-expected it to be boring, but instead, he was sucked into the stories. He’s only had the same reaction to his favorite books, so it was a lot to be that immersed in the way someone talked about old fast food joints.
Rowena smiles. “Such peasants. Anyway, when are you free to start? Like I told you when I started wooing you, we’re undertaking the contemporary version of Giselle this year and I hope we’ll get to perform it before fall.”
“Because I like you,” Castiel said with a shrug, then sat up and opened what sounded like a tin box. “Now, I've got to tell you, this is not vegan.”
He doesn’t know how to end the sentence. Before what? Before December? But that would be a lie — he wasn’t involved since…
This is a start more rocky than Castiel would’ve liked, but it’ll have to do for now. He turns back to the Winchesters.
He’s lying on the bed with the fluorescent lights of the city coming in from the window. Dean is sleeping next to him, still naked, covered in blankets, mouth slightly open but not snoring… yet.
There is a clicking noise on the line. Castiel squeezes the phone tight, holding his breath, waiting for a reply – any reply.
Anna takes Castiel’s place by the stove, so he ventures towards the fridge to grab the meat. “It went really well. I didn’t know what I expected of Ms. MacLeod, but I am pleasantly surprised by her personality.”
“Let’s get out of here,” Dean mutters, and his breath caresses Castiel’s neck, eliciting all-over shivers no matter how much agony he is in right now.
Dean sighs and stretches his head further back. Castiel hates himself, but takes a look anyway – lets his eyes caress his beautiful jawline, the delicate skin under his ears and how his Adam’s apple bobs when he swallows. Castiel could just reach out and touch him.
“We’ve talked about that too, and we’ll be talking about it more before we disclose any details,” Sam says, pointedly looking at Dean. Before he can protest Jody Mills walks up to them.
“So,” the man says eventually, looking down at Castiel’s backpack and then, for some reason, his shoes. “It looks like I’m not in Kansas anymore.”
A voice behind him. A beautiful voice filled with tones and hues for days, full-on milk chocolate symphony. Castiel could feel all his muscles stiffen, but he stubbornly kept on fondling the grass. Dean cleared his throat, not knowing what to say next. This made Castiel frown. Wasn't he supposed to have all his answers lined up and ready?
”None of your damned business, you jerk”, Anna said, her eyes still staring out the window, ”you're not family, nor will you ever be.”
“Don’t jump to conclusions, pal,” Dean says, a grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Listen to what I’m trying to tell you here.”
”I love you, Castiel Novak,” Dean mutters, sending shivers down Cas’ spine. ”Each day I love you more.”
“Oh, Castiel,” he said, looking around. A couple of tasteful snow paintings decorated the window. It wasn’t done yet — he’d need to buy dark blue window paint for the night sky.
“Shush, Castiel,” Charlie says, and scrutinizes his face before continuing. “Do you want me to come over?”
The garage never stops surprising Castiel. It’s already filled with all kinds of supplies – for renovating, for building, for the car – and it looks cozy enough for him to believe they’ve been living here for ages already. It’d only been weeks since they closed the deal with their seaside DIY dream, and he’d daydreamed of
He can’t stay in the cool, bright living room for long, and heads into the bathroom. He closes the door and leans against it, then lets his knees bend so he slides to the ground. He doesn’t bother putting on the light, even though the lack of visual stimulation forces him to focus on how wrong his breathing sounds to him. What if James is telling stories right now? What if he’s dealing with this the way Castiel wanted him o, and he doesn’t even bother to check? He groans in the darkness and it echoes through the walls.
People and angels have coexisted in peace for decades, but usually, they’re not this easy to locate. Angels mostly prefer to stick with their brethren and closer to nature than what New York has to offer. Dean has met a couple while driving across the country to meet his brother in California, and his experiences were pleasant.
Since the sun is still shining, there are two groups of people there in addition to them. Still, it’s emptier than any other place in the city  -- mostly because there’s a bigger, better, volleyball-netted, and shark-free beach just a couple of miles down the road. This place is rockier than it is sandy, but Castiel has developed feelings for the desolate, rough landscape.
If this was a different scenario -- if there were no James in his life, and he was stronger and more complete as a person -- he would probably be hooking up with Dean. So he’s possibly a bit jealous of those who are free to do so.
It was easy to find the coffee shop – heck, Dean would have been able to locate it with a blindfold on. The scent of peach and apple pies carried out into the street and made him shiver with pleasure. He passed the crowds of busy people and entered Sugarmill with a jingle of a bell above the door. Loads of people were making last-minute serving purchases for their parties and clerks buzzed happily around pies, giving treats for kids. Standing right there in the doorway, Dean locked eyes with Anna, who was emerging from the – what Dean assumed it to be – kitchen. She squinted in a way that was familiar to Dean and made his stomach turn. Then, as he should have guessed already, she stormed his way and when close enough, slapped him in the face. It was an open-palm wham that was more embarrassing than painful.
”Uh,” Dean said, glancing Chuck's way, ”we haven't really discussed this. We're not decided on whether we're still driving a bit further today.”
He frees his hands from Castiel’s and lifts one of them into their line of sight. He opens the wristwatch with his teeth and lets it fall on the floor with a thud, revealing a delicate, black band underneath.
The end comes fast. A phantom feeling of choking rises up in his chest, and then to his throat. As he lifts his hands to his neck, it’s as if his fingers are swimming through something thick — he’s trailing them through gelatin, or glue. He tries to gasp, but it comes out silent; he’s choking on something, something that tastes like salt and chloride. He’s screaming silently, lifting his hands against the roof right above him, and the only reasonable parts of his head are trying to figure out when exactly his stalker poisoned him.
“Well, that might have been out of line,” Castiel says hesitantly. Meg gasps exaggeratedly and huffs out a laugh.
Dean nods, but laughs as the rain turns on another gear. It shouldn’t be possible to rain this hard. They’re barely a couple of feet apart, and Castiel can’t even see Dean properly.
“I love you, Cas,” he answers. Castiel hides his face somewhere under Dean’s jaw and smiles. It feels like he’s radiating light from the inside. Is this what Jane felt like when she felt her chest glowing?
without saying a word. Although this felt like melting lava inside him, Dean shook his head, so Castiel turned to say something to Anna without ever letting go of Dean's hand. He saw Anna nod and smile at Dean and before concentrating on the fireworks again, she mouthed 'pie'. After that, Dean was pulled away from the crowd.
It’s eight in the evening when they make it to the highway by the ocean. They drive in silence for a while, until Dean clears his throat.
“The bigger the better, am I right,” Balthazar says, gesturing at Kevin to do research on his phone about the Garden. “I guess that could work.”
“I was just wondering,” Dean’s answer sounds like it’s been practiced to perfection to use as an excuse, “whether I can trust you with linseed oil.”
“Well, it’s past midnight so I’d be troubled if you were,” he hums, taking another swig of the beer. It tastes like a mediocre domestic and whatever it costs, it’s too much. Shit’s basically water.
Dean says nothing, so Castiel cups his face with his free hand. Dean’s eyes fall to Castiel’s lips, but they both know they shouldn’t get lost anymore — it’d make it that much harder for both of them to let go.
”You’re hopeless, kiddo,” Gabriel says, raising his eyebrows. He yanks his card off from the chain it’s been dangling on with a set of keys and throws it Alfie’s way. ”My shift’s over in five. I’ll expect it back on my chain by then.”
That was a Dean place, right? Did he head there to be closer to Dean, or to erase what happened between them?
”First off”, Gabriel announced, tone filled with absolute pride, ”I'm going to put you in a sequin dress.”
Castiel lets out something between a gasp and a sigh and looks up at Dean, who’s nervous, swinging himself to the balls of his feet and back again, and ready to run any second. Castiel collects all of his courage and walks up to him, wraps one of his hands around Dean’s waist and presses the other against his cheek.
“Castiel Novak,” Rowena says with a poise infused with the self-confidence she easily radiates, “Well, I would never have thought!”
Now that it’s silent, he can’t keep his mind from the things he doesn’t want to think about. He thinks back to the night he met Castiel – how Benny effortlessly took home two angels at the same time and how that should make Dean feel jealous, but it just makes him sick to think about himself in the same situation. Not that there’s anything wrong with love; no matter how many people share it, Dean’s all for it… But since sex has a long time ago become impossibly hard for him, it’s obvious thinking about more one-night-stands isn’t doesn’t make him happy jump.
Castiel takes no longer to listen — he starts towards the grass himself, hopping over some bigger rocks and ending up on the soft, tall grass. He tries not to run, but his feet are taking him faster and louder than he would like them to. His heart is thudding in his ears, adrenaline is making his whole body sluggish, and no matter how hard he tries to inhale, it’s not working right.
Castiel shakes his head almost violently to come back to his senses. Charlie bumps her elbow at his side.
Of course, there’s also guilt: about losing his focus tonight, about leaving his friends alone with strangers while he was making out with Dean in the kitchen, about thinking that he’d deserve anything like Dean Winchester.
“We're not making this a political issue,” Dean says, “although, you have to admit it's a factor you have to consider when people disrespect you.”
Dean looked around. People were everywhere, but suddenly, everything was a bit further away; it was like Blue Eyes had brought in a blackboard pointer and poked everyone just a bit. Absentmindedly, he looked at the guy's hands. They were glittery, but not holding a pointer.
“If someone was unable to work, and you’d have to either call someone else on short notice or go do the shift yourself, which would you do?”
“I’ve been to a couple of caterer’s tastings,” Dean admits as they glance at drinks on the special menu just for them, “but they’re rarely like this. This seems like the restaurant can’t make do with their catering service alone.”
“If you're up for a suggestion, I'd recommend a body lotion to go with the gel. If you want to stay on your sister's good side, she does need the whole package.”
A tall man came to a halt next to the table and first Castiel thought it was the waiter, but he wasn't wearing a uniform and he looked way too awkward eyeing them. For a while his eyes lingered on Gabriel and he pulled his lips to a bright half-smile.
Dean is pulled back from whatever personal hell he had sunken into. The man sitting next to him is referring to the drink Dean is nursing – beer seemed too dull so he’d taken a cocktail. It’s colored light yellow with golden glitter flecks swirling inside and even though he’s already forgotten how much it cost, it must have been more than he’d liked.
As Castiel got up, he noticed Meg sitting on the next table, smoking a cigarette that was her bad habit when she was intoxicated. They’d glanced at each other, but never spoke of the situation again.
“You should eat your greens, at least,” Castiel sighs, mostly to himself. Dean gives him a reprimanding look, but they fall silent for a moment and their drinks arrive in the meantime.
but those eyes, and those lips, and that smirk on his face that implies he knows perfectly what he’s doing to him.
“It was after our Halloween show, and Bartholomew took us all for drinks to a bar he wanted to check out. And someone came up to you and said something, and that’s what triggered your attack.”
In principle, the landlord isn't allowed to discriminate tenants according to their social status, but Dean told Castiel he wouldn't really be seen as the number one choice in a bake-off of an apartment showing if he was the only person alone. So now he has pie in one hand, and Castiel in the other, and they're stepping in through the door that's invitingly open.
There were people smoking cigarettes all over the pavement, so he felt he was safe enough to take a seat on one of the patio chairs. He tried to inhale, and exhale, but it came out all wrong and shaky and stuttered. This wasn’t the first time he felt this overwhelmed over something, so he knew this was a panic attack; now all he needed to do was to get home, and sleep it off.
All of his colleagues are waiting for him in the little van when he exits the double doors of the hospital. They gesture him to come in, and smiles at the sight of them as he does. Kevin and Eileen pack themselves in the back, and Castiel takes a seat next to Meg in the front.
Dean comes in with a briefcase in hand, and Castiel barely notices Sam coming after him. He abruptly stands up to shake hands with both of them, and most likely imagines Dean holding on a while longer than absolutely necessary.
“Hey, loves,” he says. “I’m so glad you could make it. There’s three I like over the others, and I can’t make up my mind.”
“You flirt more than you breathe, silly,” Castiel huffs, “you can't blame me for not taking it seriously.”
”I walked a friend to see the doctor the other day. He wanted me to join him in the appointment, which I did – and right there, with me in the room, he told the doctor he’s got nobody to help him out. The previous week, I’d made him dinner every single day. I’d called places so he didn’t have to. I’ve asked his ex-girlfriend to stop contacting him. And – and he said he’s got nobody.”
Castiel spent most of the day just wandering around. He talked briefly with Charlie, but she was busy with protocols for the Winchesters and promised to get back to him as soon as possible. She assured him she’s fine just hanging around in the apartment and that Castiel should take all the time he needs to recover from the incident.
When Sam puts it like that, it’s so simple. It’s not enough to keep anyone up at night. A simple either-or thing.
.” Dean bonks his head against Castiel’s and laughs. “I can’t believe you’ve forgotten what day it is.”
“Well, rest assured. All I see is dusty windows, although I gotta admit I don’t know what I’m looking for.”
A sense of sudden, unsolicited, raw horror fills Castiel’s chest. Is this a wrong number? No, silly, the caller literally made sure it’s him they’re talking to.
“Well, I can’t wait to see you dance,” Dorothy says. Castiel nods absently and opens his mouth to come up with another vague anecdote about nothing in particular, but the sound of heels clacking in the hallway stops him.
At times, it makes him feel bad. He’s allowed himself time to think about how much both James and Dean mean to him, and more than that — he’s allowed himself daydreams. It’s lethal and he knows it, but it’s too late to pretend he doesn’t feel anything for them.
Castiel sighs and tries not to roll his eyes. He’s been through more important conversations in his life, that’s for sure.
“Dean, you're being a child,” he said, but his voice was so amused Dean felt his heart jump, “I know you're hiding behind the tree.”
“I'm looking for a present for my awesome little sister,” Dean replied, finally answering Castiel's question. “I don't know anything about your products, but I want to stay on her good side.”
Rain is pattering down in the streets, filling up the sewers and flooding the sidewalks. Castiel is soaking wet from head to toe, but can’t bring himself to care. The drink, obviously filled to the brim with alcohol, is doing little do keep him warm — it’ll be a long walk home from here, no matter how determined he is to finish it on foot.
Castiel tried to shake the blush off his cheeks, failing miserably. Maybe it could be pinned on the wine. Before there was time to answer this message, a girl about Gabriel's age took both his hands, making the phone fall on the fluffy cushion he just sat on, and placed him awkwardly in front of a mirror.
“These are perfect,” Castiel says, forcing himself back to the moment with Dean, “why do you have these in your trunk?”
Dean touches Castiel’s nose with his fingertip and heads out to take some of their purchases inside. Castiel follows his lead, hauling four bags on his arms and grunting while walking the stairs. It’s been a while since he last visited the gym, but that was alright – he’s getting enough practice with what they’re doing now.
And Rowena does. She’s a world-famous ballet dancer, though sadly retired for a bit over five years now. After she decided her professional dancing days were over, she took over managing a theater. Until now, she and the contemporary dancers under her wing have only performed smaller-scale productions but they’ve been making waves in dance competitions and charity events nonetheless. Castiel knows Charlie Bradbury and Jo Harvelle by name, and he knows the man who mysteriously only goes by his first name, Balthazar. He has to meet the others as soon as possible.
“That is an unofficial ‘yes, I’ll keep the date free until we can discuss terms and payment somewhere less crowded next week’,” Castiel says. He keeps his eyes on Sam, but feels Dean looking at him. He feels uncomfortable — no, that’s not it. He feels flattered, if a bit confused by the attention he’s getting from the man. He has no clue what kind of attention this is. Is it genuine interest? Is he faking it for some reason? Or is it a form of
”We got the chemistry, Cas. What can I say?” Dean asks, trying to keep his voice carefree. Castiel knows his best friend well enough to know he's mostly faking it, though – there's no way he wouldn't be nervous about this.
Dean sighs and forces his fingers to start tapping again. Castiel moves his hand to the other side of Dean’s head and presses his lips against his flesh, twirling his tongue to taste the sweetness of his newly-washed skin. Dean smells incredible, like the remnants of his cologne from earlier mixed with Castiel’s soap, but also like himself. It’d easily overwhelm Castiel if he weren’t set on his task of breaking Dean apart, piece by piece. So far, he’s doing well — Dean’s squirming under his lips, his breath is stuttering and his fingers are pressing buttons that make the laptop ding.
“You’re so hot it’s not fair,” Castiel sighs as Dean rolls his hips against his finger. “I’m fascinated.”
like the older person. The boy flashes him a smile that battles the sun in both radiance and warmth and nods.
“Meg and Kevin have you covered for the morning. You can take the evening shift,” Balthazar says, “and don’t say I never do anything nice for you.”
Castiel never pulls his hand away, so Dean has time to sort it all out. When he believes he’s mostly done, he needs to blink away a couple of tears.
“Sounds good to me,” the woman smiles, “and I’ve got six colleagues, so if you could count how much I need to make it last a while, at least, I’d be very grateful.”
Of course, James will eventually need to know the whole truth, but it’s too early to think about that.
Dean hums in mock consideration, then slowly places his lips on Castiel’s. They stay like that for a while, for which Castiel is happy because for fuck’s sake his body feels like it’s going to shake until he dissolves, his heartbeat tangible all the way in his toes. He lifts his hand to the back of Dean’s neck, pulling him closer, and Dean opens his mouth to deepen the kiss. Castiel happily obliges, swirling his tongue on Dean’s lower lip, eliciting a low moan from him. Dean’s hands stay a grounding, gentle press on his sides, and he’s never thought it would feel this good – this much like home, like everything he dreamed of as a teen when he first dreamed of Dean, and more.
”What's the buzz about?” Charlie asked. She handed Dean the glass he'd abandoned earlier, and filled it with fresh red.
Castiel feels both embarrassed and proud of himself as he returns backstage. Eileen immediately comes to him for a hug, to which the rest of the group add on and form a weird hug-ball.
Castiel rolls his eyes and crosses his arms with a shrug. The fire crackles happily behind his back, warming it.
“Good. Look, I’m not big for speeches. I’m making it up as I go. So I hope it’s alright if I end up rambling.”
As the first silent pearls of fireworks ascended into the dark sky like glowing tadpoles, Dean could feel his chest tightening. When was the last time he actually
Mills frowns, her hand hovering over Castiel’s extended phone. He’s not sure if he’s even pocketed it since he received the picture.
”I don't know”, Dean sighed with a shy smile, he wanted to play this game for a second longer, albeit he was a lost cause, ”your screen size may not impress me.”
“Make yourself at home, I'll bring us some chai,” Castiel said, gesturing towards the couch before heading to the insides of the house. Dean walked slowly towards the tree, admiring the obvious detail, and finally sat on the couch. Damn, it was comfortable. He felt his body sliding into a warm, lulling state of... coma?
Bart takes one of the books in his hands and flips it over. “Oh, yeah. I read this when it came out.”
“I’m sorry I put you through all this. I mean, from the first time I talked with you, I knew I was hooked. I should’ve just let you go without me possessing you like that.”
“Yes, yes, I know what I said. Still, it overwhelms me each year just how much you’re going to cross the line.”
“Uh, with all due respect, I don’t know if I should be discussing anything regarding the theater with a person that doesn’t belong in the group. I don’t even know who you are, apart from a dancer, obviously.”
“In the store, there were these... Balls. In all kinds of baskets and buckets. Tons of different colored and shaped balls. So, are those also naked shower gels or...?”
A doctor comes to him and tries to talk to him. All he hears is tinnitus. He stares at the guy blankly and wonders what would happen if he spat at that condescending face. But for now, all his strength is taken by breathing alone.
Castiel nods. “Yes, and I’d rather not hear any objections. It’s very fresh, and I don’t want anyone judging it before I know what’s going on myself.”
”Take your imaginary stuff with you then. Look, three minutes. I'm driving a car so I'm ending this call now.”
A whine unwillingly leaves Castiel’s throat. These are the words he didn’t even know he wanted to hear, and now that they’re out there it’s warm and fuzzy, and all he wants to do is to take Dean home now, and bathe together. Instead, he sighs.
, Castiel mouths. “But this looks like vandalism. We’ll have to hear from your friend, Mr. Dupont, since he was storing the…”
“I do remember what you said on the phone — we shouldn’t talk about the dead.  What I want to know, though, is how important this person was to the rest of your group dynamics. Is everyone going to be comparing me to them? Are people going to mad at me for trying to fill the space?”
,” Dean explains, whispering the last word. Cas looks around, but he’s not nervous – no, he looks like he wants to fucking finger gun a camera if he comes across one.
“Not really even that. I just think happy employees equal happy working conditions — for me, as well.”
“Well. Yes. We have a diffuser by the door to lure in clients. Today I used pine, because it has a purifying effect. And, of course, our Daily Blend has it.”
“I stayed because I wanted to,” he says, trying to keep his voice calm. “I wanted to stay the night.”
“Of course not. You know it’s been over for ages. The reason I keep this is that I feel more like myself when I do. It’s a part of me.”
Castiel shakes his head rapidly. It’s too much. It’s all too much, way too soon. He squeezes his eyes shut, tries to keep his breathing somewhat under his control, grinds his teeth to root himself.
Castiel just groans from somewhere deep in his gut, and for some reason, Dean’s steps come to a halt behind him.
“Yes. I’m still a little lost on the details, but I think we were on a job and suddenly, it just got dark. I don’t even remember if we’d already finished the job or…”
”Heya, Cas”, a voice, a goddamn voice of pure, rich milk chocolate perfection caught his ears, making him
“Dream on, asshole,” Dean snarls. Sam puts his hand on Dean’s chest to stop him from attacking right then and there.
There are still two tangerines on the table that he vaguely remembers removing from the fridge. He takes them and returns to the bedroom.
“Sounds like you’re troubling yourself over more than you should,” Sam says. “Of course, I can’t know that because you’re keeping all the details from me, but as much of a cliche it is to listen to your heart, you should do that. Now, you’re probably only listening to your head and the possible curveballs it’s throwing your way.”
“Charlie, you’re standing in the sun,” he says slowly, and his voice scares him as much as his words scare Charlie — she places both of her hands over her mouth and shakes her head.
”I'm serious. Drop off at the Sugarmill coffee shop down the street soon enough”, the mother said, ”I'll bake you the pie of a lifetime as a thank you.”
That caused trouble once, but Dean stuck around and waited, too god-forsaken patiently, for Castiel to accept his love.
“Shower’s free, if you want,” he says to Dean, who’s currently scanning through his bookcase. Their eyes meet, and for some reason, they just smile at each other like dorks.
“Uh,” Dean muttered. Castiel pressed his hand on Dean's upper arm, gesturing him to turn around and face him. He did, and Castiel let his eyes wander across his face for a long time. Dean did wonder what he found in there, because his expression changed from focused to warm, and – and admiring. At that moment, all of the affection that had been building up inside Dean just spilled over and he gently placed his hand over Castiel's hand.
Castiel presses his lips against Dean’s – just staying there for a second, to familiarize them with the feeling and the proximity. After a second or two, it’s suddenly not nearly enough and Castiel presses Dean’s back against the refrigerator for leverage. Dean happily lets himself be handled like this, moaning into Castiel’s mouth and opening his lips for better entrance. His hands wind up on Castiel’s hips, pulling him closer to feel all of him at once, and they both gasp at the feeling of things turning from hot to absolutely fucking scolding in a split second.
“No, I know that,” Dean gestures with his hand, “what is Heaven? Is it a hole in the sky, a cloud, a different dimension –”
Kevin outdid himself with the decorations. There are classy whites and blues and reds, but instead of demanding, bright primaries, they’re muted — tablecloths match the curtains and light-up centerpieces match the flowers. They’ll look impressive when they’re up.
Feelings of guilt, longing, self-hate, and shame fill him up first separately, then all at once, and his head’s a mess like never before.
“Okay, besides therapy, I’ve been coming to you, Sam, and that really helps. Those days we talk on the patio mean the world and I rarely think about anything else when I’m there. Uh, work helps, too, and of course-”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says. His voice sounds horrified, which is not far from the truth. The turn of events is way too abrupt for this to be alright.
“So, how are we coming along? It’s the day after tomorrow, so I hope we’re fine,” Sam starts as they take seats around a table. He makes sure he’s seated so that Eileen can read his lips. Perhaps due to a stranger being so considerate towards her, Eileen blushes. Then again — she herself has made it known making these adjustments is common sense and not consideration. Either way, Castiel is pleased of the way Sam knows how to behave.
”It's making it a lot easier to stand your face right now”, she was breathing in and out hastily, obviously full of anger, ”I hate you, Dean.”
“About you being a gay? Nah, nobody. Takes one to know one. Queer as fuck, right here. How’d you think Meg would know me if I wasn’t?”
For a total of two hours, Castiel sits on a bench by the ocean. He watches joggers pass him by and vaguely considers running himself.
Castiel shudders. Well, it was obvious some people over at Winchester, Inc. wouldn’t like if Dean got too close with a man if they were to uphold their conservative image, but wouldn’t that be something they’d discuss with Dean himself?
It takes him two days to wake up and brew some coffee. It takes three days to turn on the TV, and all of the five days to get a shower. As he exits the steamy bathroom in a robe, it feels like his lungs are working better than before, like he can breathe well for the first time in a while.
It brings him here, standing behind the counter of the quiet Tea Party, fiddling nervously with his phone, making patterns on the film of his screen with his fingers. He should really wipe the screen. Instead, he opens James’ and his conversation, scrolling up to reread the conversation they had earlier in the week.
“Ahh, there you are,” Balthazar says. Dean’s snapped back into reality when Balthazar slaps his shoulder playfully. “Didn’t think I’d see you up and about again.”
“Uh, sure, I guess. He didn’t forbid me to contact him, so I can at least ask,” Sam sighs and picks up his phone. While he’s distracted, Eileen turns to Castiel.
Castiel blushes at the compliment and tries to forget it's fake. There's a moment of silence during which another couple leaves, and then Rowena turns to face Fergus to apparently reprimand him. Dean leans closer, eliciting shivers down Castiel's spine.
It’s not blackberry season yet, but Castiel makes it to the strawberries by memory. They’re raw in places, but some are just perfect for him to collect in a plastic container that’s handed out to him from behind his back.
“No, you’re impossible, and that’s why I am like this, you ass,” Dean retorts and feels around on the bed until he finds the bottle again. He pours some lube on his fingers behind Castiel’s back, then reaches down to lather it on Castiel’s erection. Even with a thin excuse of rubber between them, Dean’s fingers feel warm, skillful and gentle.
For a moment, they’re just squealing at each other, after which they hug again. A lot of undecipherable words are exchanged, and then, finally, Charlie turns to face Castiel.
“I love it,” Castiel says and gives Dean a short kiss — or he meant it to be short, but Dean decides to deepen the kiss until Castiel is panting, rendered speechless against the mattress, and Dean is lying on top of him.
“Will do,” Meg says with a half-assed salute and leaves the room. After Kevin leaves, Eileen pulls herself out to arms’ length and locks eyes with Castiel.
Castiel can only fully recall one of the times he came out from the tank. It had been a particularly juicy fight about how Bartholomew felt Castiel was paying too much attention to men on TV, and he had just been waiting for the solution of a CSI case. Bartholomew had told Castiel he could come out when he could “undoubtedly prove that you only have eyes for me”. When he eventually emerged, his feet wobbly on the tiles and holding on door frames to get forward, Bart had come downstairs and helped him to bed. He’d made Castiel beg for permission to touch him, and to practically write sonnets of  his striking beauty, until he considered Castiel forgiven.
“We definitely will,” Castiel says. He’s about to continue, but there’s the sound of someone clearing his throat behind him. He turns around, momentarily thinking about how rude it was of him to not greet the customer in the first place, and meets green eyes — and the feeling of falling.
”Well, obviously I'm not”, Castiel said, biting his lip. He wanted to escape this – no matter how. ”And pity is something I have no use for.”
-- it was like coming home. I realized how much I had to let go of, and I wanted to at least give you closure, were you willing to just dismiss me.”
“For you to fuck off?” He grins at Dean’s second eyeroll, and nods. “Yeah, I did. I fell for you long time ago.”
“Let me tell you, those bastards just want the easy way out of the job market. They wish they’d get so rich so fast they wouldn’t have to do any real work.”
Even though many things did change this year, one didn't; Dean spent no less than two of the first weeks in January away from the outside world.
Castiel feels a blush creep up his spine, and on a brave whim, takes his shirt off. He’s still got a t-shirt underneath, but he’s aware of how it sticks to his skin while wet. Dean doesn’t miss it either, letting his gaze roam freely on Castiel’s upper body. He runs his fingertips over Castiel’s stomach before pulling him in for a kiss.
None of that matters now. What matters is that they’re here, and he needs to wrap his mind around this eventually, but it could be enough to just enjoy the feeling of being adored by someone he adores back.
Still wet, still careful, still shallow. Castiel can feel desperation building in his stomach, making him want to pull Dean closer and kiss the living fuck out of him.
”Seems like it's just you and me in this party,” Chuck sighed. His feet seemed restless and he kept on checking his phone.
Dean frowns at their hands, and places his free hand on top of them both. Castiel feels the need to complete the pile, but he doesn’t.
The atmosphere turns cold. With another sigh, Dean gets up from the couch and crosses his fingers behind his head.
”It’s not the instructions,” Castiel says slowly. He inhales to continue, but can’t, and his lungs deflate with a wheeze.
When they part, they’re in each other’s arms, leaning their foreheads together, breathing the same air. Dean tries his hardest to keep his knees from buckling, but fails eventually and that breaks the little bubble of seriousness – Castiel all but laughs and steps backwards.
Castiel wakes up to the sound of his coffee maker and lazily gets up. For a moment he hopes it’s Dean, but when he sees Charlie standing in his kitchen with her back turned to him his heart melts a little.
“Yes, well, we did graduate a couple of years ago, Dean,” Castiel points out. Dean glances at him, shaking his head.
Castiel had known he wasn't what was wrong in his school. He'd known there was nothing wrong with him and getting bullied was a product of the bullies' own insecurities. This had helped him during daytimes but nights were a whole different matter – he'd wake up drenched in sweat, words of begging escaping his mouth. Eventually, he'd projected his fears and bitterness into angels; after all, they were always present in his nightmares. After all these years, it was still a hate/fear experience for him.
”If that brings you trouble, Alfie,” Castiel says, ”I’d rather just… Just take the shouting. I know how hard it can be to get through the day in this line of work.”
“Yes, thanks for asking. I’ve got a tent right here,” he pats his backpack that’s on the ground next to his leg now. “Plenty of space for two.”
“I’m honored you even considered me. I haven’t been out there in a while,” Castiel says, slightly abashed. “Although, that hardly matters now. I just want you to know I’m immensely grateful.”
“Laughing at other people’s work counts as being a jerk. She’s probably done all of this herself, and needs credit.”
“Wow,” Castiel says, “someone should recalibrate your moral compass. I think you’re a better person than you give yourself credit for.”
“From what I’ve learned, if you love someone, their faces just… become them, in a way. I’m sure he only sees your good side.”
They finish their sloppy excuse for an early dinner in silence, flush it down with bitter coffee and start heading back.
Castiel laughs. “We do have construction workers, obviously. However, it’s usually more convenient to hire local people than to start moving equipment and people across the country. Besides… Construction workers rarely look like they’re coming straight from a fight.”
did justice to his beauty, Dean thought, pausing for a while. He wasn't surprised to see the other man, though – like last year, it was a buzz in the air before the sight.
. But if I wanted to come visit one of your parties, for research purposes… Would that be a thing I could do?”
Unwilling to venture into thoughts of his parents, Castiel picked up his phone. Dean had sent him a message of his face, apparently to further try and soothe Castiel’s mood. He laughed at the dorky expression Dean was making, and after sending him an eye-rolling emoji, he opened his earlier conversation with Charlie.
“Wow, thanks for the faith in me,” Castiel says. Eileen tilts her head, making her hair partly fall on her face. She huffs it away and tries to smile.
Like last time, Castiel is right in the portal resonating differently – Dean sees it. This time, it’s indeed huge; probably a 30-foot diameter vortex expands in front of them. It’s hard to see where it begins or ends against a backdrop of starry black sky, but the spirals emanating a northern light-like glow keep the cliff they arrived at somewhat lit.
them physically. “If you want to, I can never talk about this again. Or I can try to help, or – anything you feel you need right now.”
He feels so controversial about his old new friend. A part of him is still angry at him for leaving in the first place, and he’s really trying not to rekindle any old flames because he’s still hurt over Bartholomew and would probably take him back in a heartbeat, given the chance—
Castiel frowns slightly, but lets it go. He knows he should have checked his calendar ages ago, but something primitive has awaken inside him during these last weeks. The battery in his phone died ages ago, as well, and he just couldn’t bring himself to charge it. He wants privacy. He wants to be alone together in the world they’re creating together with Dean. He wants them to attach memories to it together and with zero distractions.
”It doesn't mean I don't like animals, though,” Dean stated, ”it only means I'm not on good terms with zoos.”
“Good. Thank you, Cas,” Dean says, kissing him again. “I will then be coherent enough and let’s have this conversation in a less compromised state.”
That isn't all they do, though – ever since Castiel met Meg, they’ve also provided party planning services. Castiel’s still in charge and has the final say-so of both the store and the services, but Meg’s previous experience as a wedding planner definitely brings something new to the table.
”I know the feeling”, Castiel said and pressed his hand on his mouth – he wasn't planning to talk. Dean stayed quiet for a moment and then his voice was there again, with an obvious amount of fond added.
“I’ll leave you to enjoy these in peace,” Gilda says, placing four different plates with aperitifs on the table. Then, she nods to Castiel and leaves.
It’s weird how he can miss Dean even though he’s right outside the door. Castiel goes through the motions of washing his hair and lathering soap all over himself, and while he’d be perfectly fine with just sleeping with Dean tonight, he could also…
“Really?” Meg huffs. “Great shit, man. It’s not like any of us has anything to do on a Saturday night.”
The thought makes him shiver and he tries to shake it off. He needs to talk to James about so many things before he’s allowed to think like this. It’s too easy to fall back into the cosiness they once had, to forget that they drifted apart once and might easily do so again. Given Castiel’s current situation, he won’t be able to go through that; but as long as they talk every day they’ll grow closer, and Castiel can already feel himself getting soft around the edges and letting himself indulge in whatever is the opposite of bright, hard reality. He can take his phone and hide in the bathroom, talk to James about nothing in particular, or just read him texting nonsense.
“Nah,” Kevin smiles, and greets the customer that comes through the door behind Castiel’s back. “We’re quite busy at the time -- but when we’re done with whatever planning we have, and the store’s up to date with both stock and inventory, we’re having another one of those nights.”
Castiel places his hand on Dean’s chest. For a moment, he just enjoys the warmth and the beat of the heart he loves the most in this world. Then he leans closer and kisses Dean’s neck lightly. He can hear Dean’s breath hitch, but he insistently keeps on typing. Castiel lets his lips travel along Dean’s jaw and find the pulse point he saw just now, and when he gently scrapes his teeth on his skin Dean squeezes the laptop screen so firmly it makes a light snapping sound.
Since someone has made their way to his door at this hour, it’s only polite to answer. He lazily gets up from the balcony that’s bathed in twilight hues and makes his way back inside. He finds Charlie at the door, and she’s not alone — she’s with Gilda, Balthazar, Eileen, and of all people, Sam Winchester.
“Hi,” she says happily and squeezes both of Castiel’s hands for a moment — a gesture Castiel is learning to associate with her — before taking a seat by her drink.
”Besides planning the exhibitions and building these aquariums, I take care of the animals. I feed them, do some daily routine checkups and see that they're happy in their environment. I do the best I can, but it's still just putting animals in cages for people's amusement.”
The sudden thought of it being one-time-only hits him. They agreed on doing this once, because Dean can’t do a relationship. He can’t do a friends-with-benefits thing, and he can’t do a romantic relationship. When Castiel first agreed to his terms, he’d thought about the romance factor — he’s not ready for anything like that either, at least not before they’d get to know each other better and proceed a lot more slowly than they have.
Dean bites his lip before taking his whiskey glass and leaning back on the couch. For a moment, it’s silent, and Castiel can practically hear the gears turning in Dean’s head.
Dean hummed, deep in thought. Did this have something to do with soulmates, as well? Had Castiel not found the right person yet or was Dean just reading too much into this?
The nurse responsible for the conversation with James is Tessa. She’s off duty tonight, but Kate was kind enough to approach her over the phone and let Castiel talk with her.
Castiel nods, still frowning deeply, and twists the bottle open. He meets Dean’s eyes across the table and almost chokes on his first swig — there’s nothing but sheer admiration on Dean’s face. What? Why?
“And the vet asked if they approved of the kittens staying alive, instead. You know how stupid it is, the owner having the final say of their pets even after they decide to let them go. Anyway, after some hesitating they said yes and ever since, the kittens have been hanging out at the vet’s office. Since it’s peak kitten season anyway, and these guys look regular at best, they’re not the hottest stuff on the market.”
“I should’ve told you earlier that… Shit, this is hard. Talking aloud is a lot harder than writing, you know?”
He hears something ticking; it sounds like a key being tapped on top of granite. Charlie’s making the sound.
“I guess I am at least a little grateful that you didn’t put me in a long-sleeved spandex suit after all.”
“Wait, who? Who are we talking about?” Sam asks. Castiel glances at him, and he looks genuinely confused. He briefly considers asking Sam to leave the conversation for now — he’s yet to tell Dean that there’s someone in his life that means a lot to him, and even though Dean probably wouldn’t think twice about it…
He sends the message before he tries to analyze whether it’s too snarky. He knows the answer, but there’s something already shifting in James’ and his relationship — he needs to set boundaries this time, because he doesn’t want to steer into dangerous territories.
Castiel presses another kiss to Dean’s lips before he takes his hand and lets him guide them to the bedroom. Even though he’s been drinking tonight, the thought of all this being real makes him suddenly stone-cold sober and a little nervous. He doesn’t fear not living up to Dean’s expectations of him -- in fact, he’s not able to place the feeling whatsoever — but it’s persistent, like taking this leap of faith could prove to be the end of them.
“I’ve seen him around, yes,” a voice says before one of the faucets is turned on. “Wait a moment, please.”
“Nobody’s swimming, Charlie. We’re literally on a beach rife with shark sightings,” Dean says, squinting against the sun. “Although, I would like to test my luck.”
It’s undeniable. He’s not in love, not yet, but he’s steadily, constantly, truly falling for him big time. So much so that he wants to wake Dean up right now to feel his hands on him again. To see him looking at him again. To get Dean’s attention again. It’s like Dean’s suddenly become a current in his veins, pushing the streams forward,adding both adrenaline and narcotics in his system.
Dean’s days are pretty much filled with portalwatch after that. Castiel is sometimes as surprised as him at the places they end up, but mostly they have a good time despite the fact that the angel is obviously stressed out. He gives Dean snippets about how his world works; how his commander, Naomi, keeps tabs on him and other angels she’s recruited. Mostly, their mission is to make sure that fallen angels at least somewhat keep in line, don’t leak celestial secrets, or “do anything that brings harm to Heaven”. Murder, for example, Castiel explains. Sometimes, apparently, recruited angels need to take measures to make sure everything stays calm. Castiel has sent some angels back to Heaven for “trust breaches,” which mostly means violence, and he doesn’t have to say anything for Dean to hear how much he hates those situations. Dean gets it – having to betray your fallen siblings is hard, even if it’s the right thing to do.
”That's too much blue to take in right now”, he said, and his voice broke yet again as he lowered his gaze, ”you didn't tell me you stole all the blue in the world for yourself, you selfish thing you.”
After the show and a standing ovation, the audience leaves. Sam and Dean stay behind to have a chat with the dancers, and as soon as they get backstage, there’s at least four people clinging on to Dean.
Dean kisses him frantically, bucking up his hips as a reply, and although he already regrets this, he lets go of Dean’s erection to form a semi-coherent sentence.
”Drinks,” he sighed to his companions and headed towards the kitchen. A gas-powered freezer had some Long Island Ice Teas and beer, the reds and whites were on display at the countertop next to it. Dean grabbed a bottle of red wine and a glass and returned to the room with the spinning bottle. There was a couch next to the players, and he took a spot at the corner of it. Gilda and Charlie sat next to him, immediately intrigued by the game.
“Don’t even try with me. I know you knew it already. You know me better than I know myself at times.”
He needs to know why each time his eyes meet Dean’s across the room, he feels loved. Dean looks at him like he’s worthy of it, like his whole day is made each time he is reminded of Castiel’s existence, like they’d grown from grade school best friends into fiances and all they want to do is worship each other.
“Alright, nice of you to make it,” he says with a hint of a smile. Balthazar gives both Dean and Castiel a judgemental look but says nothing, for which Castiel is immensely grateful.
Dean contemplates before continuing. “I am determined not to find you nice,” he ventures, “just because you’re the only person that can hear- that listens to me.”
, Dean vaguely realizes he’s totally gone on him and that’s before Castiel lets his tongue travel across Dean’s lower lip. Dean’s body shakes in a response of its own, and he holds on for dear life when Castiel moves to kiss his jaw and neck.
Then, the fireworks start going off. It’s magnificent, and Castiel returns the mic to its place to regain his focus. He needs to keep his mind on the game, or he’ll start seeing the situation as it really is and get insecure. He needs this hubris to complete the song.
“I'm ashamed to admit I should think about sustainability more. I just get through my days as it is. I don't have time to weigh each of my choices.”
Charlie smiles. “Nope. You’ll see. Anyway, if you were to just tell them how you feel, what would you say?”
“I think this is the one,” he said, lifting the hand, “although I love the other one as well. It's just... It's more of what I'd like for myself, maybe.”
Castiel bites his lower lip and closes his eyes. He doesn’t know what’s causing it, but for some reason, he feels like crying.
”Thanks for your concern, but I'd do anything for-”, alright, he shouldn't push it right now. They were still raw, still fresh from their meeting, no need to go too deep into words that Dean meant but that sounded like gooey clichés nonetheless. ”I'd like to try that again this year.”
Soon enough, the class starts. Before, Dean used to make witty remarks about Castiel’s tendency to write down everything he hears from the lecturers – but even he knows how much the upcoming finals are stressing him out, and keeps that to a minimum. It doesn’t stop Dean from calling out lecturers if they come in with assumptions, though, and this is another thing he’s picked up from Castiel. While he’s happy to know all his rants about inclusivity of minorities have not gone to waste, it doesn’t make him love Dean any less… Au contraire.
