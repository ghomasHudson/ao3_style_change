Mycroft remembered it well and said so. Sherlock had said something about it being an eight to him at the time.
Now John went over to look back out of the window again. It faced the same direction as the one in John’s room, and looked out over the garden and the countryside, but it was a much larger window, so more could be seen. The view was stunning. “God, the views here!” said John enthusiastically, taking it all in properly. He was far too used to looking at the grey, beige and brick cityscape of London, with barely a single tree dotted here and there to break the monotony.
But instead of explaining any of it, Sherlock came back to himself with a brief shake of his head and fluttered his hand dismissively. “Just…something…made me think of—nothing, don't worry. It’s just funny you should say that. That exact phrase you just used was the very last thing the gallery owner said to him - said to the artist - and apparently he was so outraged that his work wasn't going to be hung in what he considered to be 'the pride of place' that he slammed the phone down, apparently stormed off somewhere—"
going. If I'm destined to die by your side, I'll do it, gladly, but not because some idiot has smacked me over the back of the head and and caused a bleed on my brain so I die suddenly of a brain haemorrhage whilst you slowly suffocate next to me from a spontaneous pneumothorax."
Greg was still laughing, a bit. “No, but seriously, I’d love you to come and watch a game. Sometime. If you want. Casual clothes. Cheering an’ rugby shirt not necessary.” He sipped his coffee, grinning at Mycroft from behind the mug. “No banner either, don’t worry.”
John read it, eyes widening too as he did so, and then he looked at Sherlock - there was an expression of stunned pleased amazement on Sherlock’s face, almost identical to the one that he was sure was on his own.
John continued bitterly, more quietly, “And then you came back and I was with Mary…” his shoulders dropped, the anger dissipated, a little. He sighed, drew a deep breath. “The night you came back…I laid awake all night, thinking—and I didn't think I could bear it,
The painting that she was working on was striking in its simplicity. It was a detailed study of the shed itself, with the mudflats and water in view just beyond it, and she was remarkably talented at capturing that entrancing golden afternoon light that John so loved. The painting was nowhere near finished yet, but John could already see how good it was going to be.
John couldn't speak anymore then so he kissed instead. They just kissed for a long time and it was full of truths and promises.
John hadn't expected that. But what had he expected? From the way his heart was going, and the fear that had tightened his throat and chest, he thought it was more like he'd expected Sherlock to say it was over...but
Relieved, Mycroft smiled warmly back at his relaxed posture and said with some relief, “Good morning…” He wasn’t quite sure what to say next.
seat though. But just as he began to move, the commotion from the front of the house grew louder as it spilled through from the hallway and into the kitchen next door.
“I rest my case,” murmured Sherlock quickly in John’s ear right before he went over - laughing - to help pull her up.
Sherlock didn't answer, he just got out his magnifying glass and bent over the painting, leaning it away from the wall so he could examine the edges of the canvas.
Mycroft’s heart had been jumping around in his chest quite a bit this evening but it jumped another impressive triple somersault at Greg’s words.  “Really?” he asked, his voice hesitant and surprised.
Sherlock looked down at the paper again. He looked strangely evasive. "Nothing of any interest," he replied dismissively, turning the page slowly.
"Oh, probably dislocated shoulder, bloodied nose - most likely broken - and very angry, but he’ll have cooled down a few fair degrees by now."
…” before setting his mouth to Mycroft’s neck once more and using his teeth again, his hips and pelvis beginning to push up against Mycroft’s; the awkward angle he was at meant they were both caught deliciously between their two bodies, the friction just
“Well, you would, wouldn’t you, with a father in the R.A.F….Mildenhall first though, wasn’t it?” Sherlock interjected casually, and like that was a natural assumption.
“Excuse me a moment, I’ll just go and find him!” she said to the room in general, in a jolly tone, and she slipped off to the study where she knew he would be holed up. Released by Agatha, Sherlock stepped back and leant against a worktop a safe distance away and shoved his hands into his pockets, but she wasn’t done yet.
John just stood there and raised his eyebrows and blew his cheeks out at the same time. He just didn’t know what to say. He was still holding the note, so he stepped backwards again and put it down next to him onto Sherlock’s chest of drawers.
John, surprised, looked over and saw a large piece of white card face down next to the Persian dagger that was currently stabbed into the latest electricity bill. The piece of card definitely hadn’t been there when he’d left. He snorted. “What’s this?” he said, going over to it.
If you haven’t seen it, you need to do so. It’s a Merchant Ivory film; if that means anything to you! These are two directors known for excellent period drama with stunning cinematography, and it’s a beautiful story, beautifully told. It stars Hugh Grant, James Wilby and Rupert Graves, all aged around 25. Watch it. You will adore it. A period gay love story with a Happy Ending. Write me a message in the comments when you’ve seen it. Write me another message when you recognise the line which I have - quite frankly - stolen straight from Rupert Graves’ mouth (he plays Alec Scudder in the film) and in both the film and the book, he says that line to his lover, Maurice Hall. I have (totally shamelessly) given him the line to say to Mycroft in my story. Sorry, not sorry, no offence taken, carry on, as you were, etc etc… ;)
she said, shaking it briskly. "So you must be the John that—" and then Sherlock appeared in the doorway so suddenly John had the feeling that he had been standing just out of view on the other side of it, eavesdropping.
They each examined the menus briefly and then discussed what they liked the look of. “What do we fancy then?” asked Greg with a grin, and as Mycroft announced his choice and began to describe the intricacies of Constantine’s extraordinary prawn and small seafood cocktail, Greg sipped his drink and watched him and thought, ‘I fancy
But to his horror, Greg was just carrying on with his rugby-support daydream. “Yeah…I can see you on the touch-lines…” he said, sipping coffee, looking slightly dreamily into the middle-distance, “…wearing my spare rugby shirt and holding up the banner with my name on…”
"—Scones out of the oven, yes, yes," said Gabriella, noisily doing it as she spoke. The smell was wonderful.
“...So this is not a ploy to wind Mycroft up?…Or piss Greg off, because you know they’re gonna be—” He dropped his arms which he’d been waving about a bit. “—Wait, you’re so sure, why are you so sure, how the fuck do you
"I was," Sherlock replied, with a sharp intake of breath over one of his lower ribs, "but then I decided I needed to get closer to the inside, so after I left the manager's office, I went out of the restaurant and found a place out of sight to leave my coat, then I went back in through in the kitchen entrance and I was someone called Jamie Hinderson."
“You can leave the bike down there,” she said to him, gesturing to a narrow passageway behind a second gate at the side of the cottage.
Sherlock looked up at John again and frowned. "He just swore, John. A lot. He just said rather a lot of four-letter words repeatedly in different orders. If you really must know, one notable point he made was that he gave me was very extensive instructions on what we could do with ourselves, in a manner of speaking.”
She certainly had. And the reason for it stood right in front of John, holding a cup that she had bought him with some freshly cooked human eyes in it, still gently smoking.
"Excuse me," she said to John and Sherlock suddenly, and turned her head to call through to Gabriella who had returned to the kitchen. "Have you taken the—"
At that moment, Mycroft came through from the kitchen to join them. John was sure he’d heard a hissed, “For God’s sake, don’t mention the golf…” from Siger just before he did so, and as Mycroft took his place at the table, John picked up the water jug to offer to fill Mycroft’s glass.
thought John, looking at his blackened cup. Sherlock was right, no one had touched that cup since Jeanette had dumped him and left the other month, but it still didn't mean it was ok to fry some eyes in it at stupid o’clock on a Saturday morning.  He touched it tentatively to see if it was cool enough to handle, and then, without looking at the contents too closely, he dropped it directly into the bin and went back to bed.
Sherlock and Mycroft had stopped squabbling - that really being the best description for what they had been doing - as soon as Lucia had shouted John's name. Neither of them had spoken to John whilst she was in the room welcoming him, but as she left the kitchen to dig about in the adjoining scullery for a suitably sized vase, Mycroft stood up from his chair in a polite gesture of welcome and nodded to John. "John," he said cordially, meaning;
Gabriella returned within minutes, with John’s book and a large folded over paper bag containing what could only be couple of scones to take home. She waved the bag at them. “Take these!” she instructed, “We don't need them, Clarissa’s always baking! And have a good journey home.” She indicated the larger paintings in their carrier which Sherlock had just picked up. “You can just leave everything with Nicolette,” she added, “I’ll collect it from her next time I go to London.” She gave Sherlock the bag of scones and handed the book back to John, who stowed it safely in his inner jacket pocket, and then she bent and picked up the smaller package of paintings, and passed that to John as well. He took it in one hand and shook hands first with her and then with Clarissa. They said their goodbyes, and Gabriella smiled as she said, “Well! It’s been insightful!” then she added musingly, “Who knows - I may even wish to employ you both myself one day!”
John looked up at Sherlock, and took a deep breath and asked him again, quietly but more clearly, "Do you know why I was…
but he still felt the tiniest wobble of trepidation. He really hoped this wasn't going to end up being the New Year from Hell to match his dreadful Christmas. Christmas with his extended family had been bad enough, with constant atmospheres springing up and frequent barbed comments pretending to be innocent conversation. He wasn’t at all keen on attending another festival of family feuding that he couldn't just casually walk away from, and as an invited guest of Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, casually walking away from this one wouldn't be quite so easy.
bad. He could not remember screaming, because he knew that you did not scream if you could help it, you did not display weakness to your enemy and you did not give away your position any more than it was humanly possible not to. So he had dropped his gun because he simply couldn't physically hold on to it any longer, and then he remembered sand against his right cheek and temple and the taste of hot dust and gun oil on his lips and then in his mouth, where he had laid his face gently down on the warm, welcoming ground and then he had closed his eyes, and then he didn't remember anything much more about that precise moment. He only remembered after.
"Alex Burson, at the end, what did he say to you? I missed most of it because I was trying to keep the daughter-in-law talking downstairs in the garage while we waited for Lestrade."
He lifted his chin and gave John a slightly dark and smouldery look. He was good at those.  “Come over here,” he said slowly. “I think I’ve got something to give you.”
by Sherlock’s barging into the study. If anything, he looked a bit pink. Embarrassed, maybe? Maybe it was very close to the truth and he had
John was quite incapable of replying, just at that moment. He had heard the phrase before, 'the mind boggles' and he suddenly realised that his face must now be making a rather perfect illustration for that very phrase. The perpetrator of the crime, Alex Burson, was a coarse, gruff-voiced, sixty-six-year-old cockney; built like the proverbial small brick house and born and bred in the East End of London where he had lived all his life. He actually quite sounded like the actor Ray Winstone in character, at his most threatening, perhaps also whilst having a really bad day and maybe immediately after realising that he’d just run out of his favourite full-tar fags. He did not sound
The wine flowed and the food was, as ever at Constantine’s, fantastic. Their conversation was natural and easy, and towards the end of the main course, Greg’s began to grow gradually what could only be described as slightly more…
“Oh, that’s alright, you’re welcome, darling!” she replied cheerfully, still grinning at John over Sherlock’s head in a way which clearly read;
John felt like he was gabbling a bit but that was probably because Sherlock wasn't speaking at all. Sherlock complied with everything John asked, taking his shirt off and chucking it dismissively onto the back of the dining chair at the table. He stood shirtless once again with his back to the window, and so John went and stood behind him.
They stared at each other. Then Sherlock stood up from his chair slowly to speak and John straightened and braced himself for whatever was coming; feet together, his hands now making neat controlled fists by his sides without even thinking about it. Sherlock standing up like that meant that it was serious.
“Really not necessary,” insisted Agatha, holding up her own free hand to stop him. “You just have to know how to handle the little blighters! Besides, they know me, they don't know you…” she finished the sherry in one last swallow and put the glass down firmly, pushing it back from the table’s edge with finality. “…I’ve got a technique! I just bundle them up in a towel, give 'em the drops and then stuff a couple of peeled prawns into 'em for their after-drop treat. Jilly’s told me where her prawns are. I’ll be
Sherlock…that’s…that’s perfect.” He grinned. “But you know traditionally, it’s sort of supposed to be a mystery who a Valentine’s Day card is from? Even if it’s obvious. You’re not meant to write your name in it.”
"An oaf with a big fist didn't like the very accurate observation I made about his upbringing." Sherlock said.
“Oh, obvious,” Sherlock replied, as if bored. “That page was very slightly bent back, the book practically opened to that poem by itself—” John knew this wasn't completely true but there was definitely a tendency there. “—And there were three biscuit crumbs in the crease of the page…” (
Sherlock looked suspicious. John went closer and pointed at the far left corner of the picture. A structure could just be made out coming away from the coast line, into the sea. It had been painted very faintly as if was obscured by the mist and by distance, but it was still identifiable. "See this funny little pier? With the crooked blue shed? It looks just like one I saw in a magazine a couple of years ago."
Sherlock was struggling with this, but he had realised recently that not only did he need John's praise like other people needed food and water, something had woken up in him - something that had been long dormant. Something had been switched on, been ignited with a slow burn. And now he couldn't switch it off or snuff it out.
John burst out laughing; delighted, warmed, genuinely absolutely charmed. “Oh, that’s…so lovely,” he said sincerely,
The unfortunate cup was one from a set of four that Jeanette, the teacher girlfriend, had given him. They were simply designed, plain white coffee cups, each bearing a single printed word in neat, black, typewritten lettering. John quite liked these cups, they were a nice shape and comfortable to hold. Two of them happened to have the words
thought John again, as Sherlock’s hand speeded up, held tighter and then went slower, before he loosened his grip and twisted his wrist… John gasped.
Because of it. In getting to know you.” He didn’t even sound like himself. To his great surprise, he found it actually rather liberating to be so completely honest.
Sherlock gave an immediate (and irritated) very quick reply to that. “John, I was only wrong about it because the ridiculous film was totally non-sensical and preposterous.”
Well. That did it, all right. That was several lines well and truly crossed, right there. And other things. Sherlock continued to look back at John coldly for a long moment, the temperature dropping to below zero, then he sat back in the chair, tossed the paper aside, and spoke.
Let me make this clear, none of it was me; I owe everything that is cricket-related in this fic to the wonderful Galadriel 1010, who answered all my cricket questions with good humour and loads of obscure references and some brilliant lines of total cricket-gibberish. Agatha wouldn’t have been the same without you, Gala! ❤️
John looked at his face. "Show me," he said, with cold control. They were hidden from view by a high sided transit van.
Mycroft could take no more procrastination. “Oh, hang the blasted trousers!” he asserted, and he demonstrated his total disregard in the state of his trousers by pulling Gregory back in and snogging him senseless instead; expensive whisky seeping through to his expensively-clad backside or not.
Mycroft had been watching Greg swallow the last of his drink and had come to a quick decision suddenly. “I think I quite like the look of yours,” Mycroft replied. “I haven't had a G&T for…quite some time,” he turned his attention to the expectantly waiting bartender. “I’ll have the same please, David, and with the Fevertree too…thank you.” David got to work and Mycroft turned back to Greg and smiled.
- I wouldn't ask you otherwise.” Greg grinned. “I would say I’d lend yer some of my pyjamas, but I don’t actually wear any….”
Sherlock had set his violin and bow back into the open case, resting on top of a tall chest of drawers next to a desk, and he now stood in front of the desk looking intently through a brown leather bound notebook that he had just picked up from it. He seemed suddenly pre-occupied, so John enjoyed looking around the room without Sherlock observing him doing it. There were a long set of shelves attached to the wall above the desk, and they were just as busy - jammed full, in fact. Lots of interesting artefacts lined them in an untidy arrangement; several large smooth stones, a jagged and milky-looking group of natural quartz crystals, a small set of antique weighing scales with tiny brass weights, a dusty looking peacock feather in a jam jar, and at the end, some large and shiny-bright huge plastic molecules. They were quite new looking and had obviously been put together from some kind of molecule construction kit. There were several, but of them all, John only recognised formaldehyde. A child scientist’s version of the Airfix plane kits, thought John, smiling a little. He had had the Airfix planes, himself.
Empty-handed, Greg stepped back over to Mycroft and Mycroft immediately reached out for his already open top button, sliding his long fingers into and down the neck of his shirt to the second button and opening it as he kissed him gently. Greg kissed Mycroft back as he moved his hands to undo Mycroft’s shirt buttons in return, but he kissed more fiercely, with growing ardour, and so between them they divested each other of their shirts, kissing each other all the while. Mycroft wished desperately too late that he’d spent more time on his running machine earlier that week, rather than researching new recipes on the internet to use up his last bit of black truffle oil, but Greg did not seem to notice his imperfections. His shirt unbuttoned, Greg slipped it from Mycroft’s shoulders and off, turning quickly to throw it one-handed to land on the chair between his wardrobe and his bed, on top of the pile of his own clothing. “Shall I close the curtain?” asked Greg, a little breathlessly, his hands running over Mycroft’s back and his shoulders, his mouth returning to Mycroft’s neck. They stood in clear view of anyone who happened to be looking out of their back window too.
“I’m afraid I don’t know, sir. It was left at the front desk,” Anthea replied. “It’s been checked for…you know...
When they stopped to breathe, John, who never talked about feelings, wanted to tell Sherlock how strongly he felt. “Sherlock, this is…I’ve—I don't think I've ever felt this…
Later on it veers away from canon…but before (and while) it does, it gets very angsty. It will all end well though, however, I totally promise you that!! ❤️
"Oh, very well," he grumbled and held out his flat palm for John to place the fish onto it. The fish was as grudging as Mycroft, and it fluttered slightly but then lay still. They all waited for a few seconds but it did not respond. From past experience, John already knew nothing more would happen. The fish would always react within seconds, and if it did not, then....your fortune must be read from the list.
"Do you want me to do some work on your shoulders? They're very tight. Some soft tissue work would help with the strain and tension around the base of your neck and shoulders where you rolled over the car."
Greg openly smirked. “Ok. You give me what you think you can spare…” he said, brown eyes dancing, making Mycroft’s insides swirl again.
Of course Mycroft had noticed something and even felt the need to pass comment. Naturally, he had put it in a way that was so typically Mycroft. "Your choice of companion seems to be doing you good, brother, dear," he had purred knowingly. Sherlock had told him to shut up.
Downstairs in the kitchen, Mycroft had taken his suit jacket off but was still in his waistcoat, his shirt sleeves rolled up neatly, beginning to make tea in a vast red teapot. John found this sight strangely amusing, he didn’t know why, but seeing Mycroft being all domesticated was…
Their table was one of Mycroft’s favourites, tucked away from the main restaurant area and screened lightly on one side by more of the strikingly verdant green and leafy plants in tall black enamelled pots. Constantine’s was unusual in that some of its tablecloths were a vibrant white, and those tables bore glossy ceramic candlesticks and bright white candles to match, but some - like the one on this table - were instead a deep, soft cream; matched by elegant, carved wooden candleholders painted a deeper cream colour, and set off beautifully by the burnished gold candles that they contained.
and when she didn't answer and the knocker still kept knocking, he realised that she was, after all,
John was on a knife edge and Sherlock didn't want him to slip and fall, he wanted him to choose and jump.
was injured and it was me screaming. So it was my fault you got stabbed.’ He wasn't sure how comfortable he felt about that.
unlike him it was to be unsure whether to voice an opinion or not - brazen or otherwise, he thought. And now he could feel his damned ears going pink again. “What else do you like?” he asked suddenly, as Greg passed him his second drink, desperate to know.
events of last night - totally buck naked and wild in all his dishevelled glory. The thought made Mycroft’s heart race, and he smiled at Greg awkwardly and a little nervously.
Their kiss intensified and simultaneously he realised that what he also wanted right now was to march Sherlock backwards over to the couch, throw him down and ravish him on it. So a realisation indeed, then. And John knew he could do it, if he wanted to. He might not be as tall as Sherlock, but he was strong and he had no issue with their height difference. He was
Why wouldn't that thought go away? John had brought him in some coffee, talked about some inanities and then gone out. Sherlock had drunk his coffee, trying to think, and then realised he needed to change his scenery and to get up, have a wash, put some clothes on and go and lie down on the sofa in the sitting room - which was his best thinking place - and think.
John nearly fell over as he clasped his hand around Sherlock’s length just as Sherlock’s warm hand slipped down and gripped his own. Sherlock’s head tipped back instantly and he gasped.
"I am!" he replied, a little deafened but undaunted, holding out a hand for her to shake. “Pleased to meet you, Agatha!” He felt so much better since he'd arrived at Sherlock's parents' house. Much more like himself.  He dealt with people every day at the surgery - sometimes emotionally draining and very difficult people - and he could see immediately that she was going to be neither of those. Someone like Agatha was going to be absolutely no problem for John. She took his hand in a firm handshake and clasped it warmly with her other hand. "What a pleasure to finally meet
, of all people, couldn't have been secretly…? ‘No,’ he thought. ‘No, come on! No way,’ dismissing the idea instantly out of hand as ridiculous. ‘There’s no way that would he buy into it - you’re delusional!’ he decided, and he grabbed a basket and got out his list.
He had also found that nor did he much want to do either of those things. He didn't know why. Which was also disturbing him.
Mycroft, heart still thumping at Greg’s incredible offer, was amused. “Oh! What do you wear in bed then?”
When they had stopped laughing, Greg nodded his head to indicate something behind Mycroft. “In my bedside cabinet, behind yer, there’s some tissues…you’re nearest…do you wanna grab ‘em?” Greg said, withdrawing his leg from over Mycroft’s and holding his body very gingerly for the purposes of damage limitation to his sheets. Mycroft - doing the same - arched backwards and found the small pack of travel tissues in the drawer instantly.
How lovely to see you! How was your journey? I bet you're totally shattered after that awful delay, aren't you, my dear?” There was a lot of embracing going on and then there was a louder clattering and crashing of luggage and a clinking of many bottles in either a plastic bag or a cardboard carrying box being put down on the table. Siger must have offered some tea under all the noise, because Agatha said loudly in mock horror, "Tea?
"I just...er...I just meant I was going to go and lie down. And you said...I thought you..." John stopped and paused for a second. "Why, d'you…
Greg grinned and squeezed with his leg. “Ahhh, y’know!…Just a squirt of Chanel no.5….” and then he snorted laughter at his own joke. Mycroft, luckily - not being Sherlock - got the Marilyn Monroe reference immediately, and spluttered with laughter. “I
" She picked up a small knife from the table and held it out. “Could you peel these, please?” He came to get the knife from her and once he’d taken it, she pushed half of John’s pile of unpeeled potatoes towards him using the edge of her chopping board. “There’s another chopping board under the sink…” she added, gesturing. Sherlock didn’t speak but sloped over to the sink, knife in hand, and bent to retrieve the chopping board his mother meant.
N.B.: “DeBretts” refers to a well-known (at least in some circles, and most certainly in Mycroft’s), quite old and therefore old-fashioned book of social etiquette. It’s called DeBrett’s Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners.
Agatha rearranged the armchair cushions, humming a little tune quite happily and with her headphones missing this time, and then suddenly asked John what his canapé was. “Prawn cocktail,” he told her, “delicious,” and then finished it. He sipped his beer, listening and nodding as she then prattled on about the England cricket team. He felt very relaxed and found he was really enjoying the first beer of the evening. It was good. Very cold. He wasn’t a massive drinker at the best of times - not with his family history - and had already decided he definitely didn’t want to be drunk tonight. Not in someone else’s home and especially when he wanted to make a good impression. Agatha, however, seemed to have the exact opposite intention. As Sherlock came back and passed her the gin and tonic he’d just made, she thanked him and then raised the glass to the room, ice clinking noisily.
John snorted laughter at the last bit. But he was satisfied with the answer. “Ok. Tesco’s it is then,” he said.  “See you later.” And off he went.
thought Greg, and he said, “I’m saying I’d like to take you upstairs to my bed,” all his cards spread out on the table and no shame about any of them.
But John remembered. "It was called 'Country Living'. I had a girlfriend who liked all that ‘aspiration and lifestyle' sort of stuff and I bought her a subscription for Christmas. She lived in Essex and liked walking. So we went for a lot of walks. One of them was a set route featured in her magazine that you could follow; it was a beach and coastal walk, and you were supposed to go along by the quay and follow the estuary, and eventually you reached this pier and the little shed but we...we...er, we...we didn't quite get there."
Siger walked ahead of John until they reached the short dark inner hallway that opened directly into the kitchen, whereupon he suddenly stepped back against the wall, and gestured for John to go through the doorway first.
"Thank you," the artist responded shortly but didn’t move to carry on.  Everything in her manner said,
he suddenly whispered in a mock awe-struck tone, and Mycroft actually giggled. It seemed everything this man said simply doomed Mycroft to fall for him more deeply.
As Siger finished dishing up John’s plate and then moved along to Agatha’s, he said proudly, “And the spinach is from our garden, John! Home grown at its best!”
it. He grinned and leaned back against his own kitchen counter momentarily. “Well, now…seein’ as yer askin’...I like
There was another long, charged and very significantly quiet silence. John looked back at Sherlock, now looking less like a rodent and more like a slightly defiant rabbit caught in headlights, and Sherlock looked back at him with his
“Yes?” said Mycroft, after a particularly long slow lick, amused and aroused by Greg’s audio encouragement and barely pausing to speak before going back to his task, already knowing it was definitely a resounding
But, Gregory was a Lestrade. And they did things their way...before Mycroft could get too smug, suddenly Greg shifted, lifting and moving his right thigh to insinuate it in between Mycroft’s, pushing his right foot down firmly between Mycroft’s ankles to settle it on the floor between Mycroft’s feet, shoving them both lightly aside with his own to be able to achieve this. He held Mycroft slightly more firmly as he did it, knowing he would be knocking him a little off balance. The tightened grip and the slightly rough treatment did amazing things to Mycroft, and now Greg was able to, standing with his right leg planted firmly between Mycroft’s, he pressed his right thigh deliberately further in and upwards slightly, and the space between their two bodies became almost non-existent; the pressure and the situation making Mycroft gasp in some air in a delightfully shocked way.
'Oh, of course,' thought John. He sipped his tea and waited and moments later, Sherlock said, "Train leaves in an hour and ten from Liverpool Street. Fancy a trip to the seaside?" He grabbed his coat and dropped his phone into the pocket. As he put his scarf on, he said flippantly, "Oh, and er…” he lifted his chin and John caught but didn’t understand the mischievous glint in his eye. “…Bring your book."
glamorous!” He was pleased that she was playing the game of enjoying the cracker prizes. He should have known that Sherlock and Mycroft's parents would easily make up for Sherlock and Mycroft.
Sherlock could see John thinking all this and he had to stop it, fast. Slightly panicked, he held up a hand to say
"Cold fish, Mycroft!" John said apologetically, reading it out, though he already knew what it would be, and some more raucous sections of the table laughed. John noticed that Sherlock was grinning from ear to ear. John felt a bit bad for Mycroft. In his family, people had been many things, but no one had ever been a Cold Fish. Wordlessly, and seemingly completely unbothered, Mycroft took the fish from his palm as John had done and held it in the air for a second before silently offering it across the table to Siger, who had also nearly finished his scallops and salad and put down his knife and fork for a break. As Siger took the fish, Lucia jumped up from her seat. "Ooh, gosh, hang on, hang on!” she said, belatedly spying some empty glasses and the empty bottle. “That second bottle of wine you opened will be ready now, Sigs, back in a moment!"
But now, at this moment, Sherlock could only look back at John blankly and not be sure if John was saying was what he thought he was, and so he asked, "Like you loved…what…?” his voice was faltering and small. "John, what—what exactly are you saying?"
no wound. There was no blood; only Sherlock's smooth, pale back, with a reddening mark at the base of his neck and some very minor skin abrasions over the left shoulder blade and just below it, from hitting the bonnet decoration on the car and the fall onto the road. Luckily for Sherlock, the faithful Belstaff had cushioned that impact, a little. The older scar from the head-chef's knife wound had healed well; leaving a faint, pale, extended dash above and across the highest point of the left scapula - as shoulder blades went, Sherlock's left one certainly seemed to be the unlucky one.
The rest of the ride was a blur of traffic, the cab radio set to some mostly inoffensive popular music station, their clasped hands warm and their thighs lightly pressed together side by side on the black leather seat of the cab; these last two details being very high on the list of sensory awareness in both their minds. Then, in a further interesting development, Greg suddenly began to stroke his thumb slowly over Mycroft’s. He did it again and again, the rhythmic sensation somehow both soothing in its easy reassuring familiarity but, each time Greg did it, also incendiary in its blazing newness. On the outside, Mycroft Holmes was all suave and calm collected control, but internally he was becoming a slightly frazzled and lust-addled mess. This was all so
Sherlock's eyes were the most serious and luminous John had ever seen them. “With every sense I possess, I want this, John. With you.”
“Hey, I’ve just realised - it’s nearly twenty past,” she said, looking at them with consternation, “You’d better get a move on if you want to catch your train!”
Sherlock, who had stayed seated, snorted air through his nose at this and John had to suppress a smirk at Mycroft's expression. Mycroft looked as disdainful as ever. He frowned delicately. “By
Then the avalanche gradually subsided, like softly settling snow, and his hands relaxed and John breathed in deeply and sighed it out hard and repeated quietly, “Yes…Sherlock…like I loved you."
John whispered urgently. It was both a question and a warning. As John uttered the word, Sherlock opened his eyes and caught John’s gaze. “Mmmmm,
Mycroft was embarrassed further by the cold-sounding description. “Oh dear. That sounds most disagreeable,” he said, mildly chagrined.
at which John cracked and broke into a broad smile. Sherlock shook his head a little disdainfully at all this very immature behaviour, and then simply lifted his glass and tipped the holly sprig straight into his mother’s empty glass next to him, making John snort with laughter.
Mycroft burst out laughing; a real and genuine laugh which was surprised out of him like a startled rabbit out of a hat. Greg grinned, pleased with his little bit of story-telling magic. His thumb pressed down on the back of Mycroft’s index finger and slid up the back of his hand. His fingers were broad and warm in Mycroft’s. “Wanna come back to mine for some cheap scotch after?” he said, his dark eyes sparkling.
thought Mycroft. “I don’t, no,” he said calmly, still perusing his menu, as if the thought of Gregory having dinner with someone else here didn’t bother him at all. ‘Well, of course he’s been here before, you fool,’ Mycroft scolded himself tartly, looking down at the menu. ‘How else would he know about the damn place otherwise?’
But Gabriella had more to say. “And what made it worse was when I phoned later pretending to be Gab, and saying I wouldn’t be able to attend, then Nicolette had the cheek to ask me, ‘Well, where do you want yours to go then?’ - all resentful, as if she hadn't listened to anything I had said at all. I was simply furious with her and so I slammed the phone down.”
“—They would have done, yes,” Sherlock countered, “but...they haven’t said a word to me yet. Not a peep out of either of them..." He studied his phone again for a minute.
John smiled too in reply, and got awkwardly up off the sofa from between Sherlock's long legs to stand beside it; hard and desperate in his jeans, feeling as clumsy and awkward as a teenager as he held out his hand to Sherlock. Sherlock took John's hand firmly in his own and stood up. One-handed, he discretely did his trousers up and he looked at John when he had done it.
He looked at her retreating back. He thought about John saying to him, "Why do you let her speak to you like that? Like you're nothing?" At the time, Sherlock had shrugged, uncaring, but this time John's words resounded in his head.
Sherlock brought the other man towards John, weaving between cars and then walking on the roadway, and flashing his stolen police ID badge very quickly at a woman who was looking interested. Sherlock even said to her, "Nothing to see here, move along please," in true police fashion. John soon realised why the man was coming so easily. "Handcuffs?" asked John, amazed, "Where did you get those?"
The comparison of Greg’s tanned skin with the black jersey trunks he was wearing was incredibly pleasing, and as he slid them down and off and Mycroft saw his tan lines, the paler skin underneath the pants and the prize that awaited him, he felt his heart speed up again.
Jilly’s two little babies!” barked Agatha amiably. She took another huge gulp of sherry then announced, “They’re due a dose at lunchtime and I'm overdue in doing it because of those blasted trains!”
Greg smiled. He knew not to ask, really, but he wanted to get their conversational juices flowing. However, no sooner had the bartender made the drinks and served them, the maitre’d was back. “Your table is ready, gentlemen,” he said.
And then, sometimes, John just sat there - like today - calm and quiet and thoughtful, with his calm, quiet thoughtfulness spreading secretly throughout the flat, permeating every nook and cranny, until it made Sherlock feel calm and quiet and thoughtful by virtue of its soft persistence.
At the centre of his anger, there was grief, but amongst all of the negative, toxic emotions he was feeling, he was relieved. He was relieved that he was free.
"Where do I...?" repeated Sherlock and he stopped what he was doing mid-question and sat up straight onto his heels, staring at the wall behind John.
John took a deep breath. 'Can't treat angry,' he thought, and he let that breath go, hard. He took his jumper off and began to roll up his shirt sleeves. While he was doing it, he took in a second deep breath through his nose, blew it out through his mouth and sent his anger and embarrassment away with it. "Just sit up straight, but keep your shoulders and neck relaxed," John instructed. "Don't lean against me." Sherlock followed the instructions but didn't speak. John stood behind him, rubbed his hands briskly together for a few moments to make them warm, and then set them gently onto Sherlock's shoulders. Sherlock was silent. John started work. Almost immediately, John could feel Sherlock's muscles begin to respond under the slow, repeated rolling pressure of his thumbs, the flats of his fingers and the heels of his palms. The large trapezius muscles of Sherlock's upper shoulders gradually began to soften and Sherlock took a long, deep breath and let his shoulders drop slightly. "That is...very effective," he murmured after a moment.
“Where do you want these?” he said brusquely, at the very same moment that Mycroft said firmly, “I’ve finished the rosemary…” they both paused for a second, not looking at each other, then obviously thinking along the same lines, they both said quickly, “What’s next?”
“Really?” asked John, in the same serious tone, knowing what Sherlock was saying here with this and feeling his own heart almost skip a beat in response. He would have been unable to stop his grin of happiness spreading, even if he had cared to try. So he didn’t. He just smiled. “Well, I don’t think that’s a problem at all,” he said, “I definitely think I can help you there...but there is only one treatment for that, I’m afraid…”
“ ‘Where do you want yours, then?’ ” Sherlock repeated vaguely, in a quiet tone. He was very still, his eyes distant.
John and Sherlock watched her work and it occurred to John suddenly how remarkably like Gabriel Peters’ her style of painting was.
Greg grabbed his shoulder gently but held him firmly. “Hey, hey! What’re you so angry about?” he asked, still grinning, trying to get Mycroft to face him. Mycroft did turn to face him then, and he glared at him in misplaced fury. “The
"Nothing at all," Anderson snapped. And he got out at the next floor. Sherlock got out of the lift himself after him, and turned to go the other way, and then bumped, literally, into Donovan coming round the corner from the staircase at some speed.
- pretty ironic, really - the Catford cat burglar. He’d been sleeping on the ex-girlfriend’s sofa all week…Sherlock got that from the dog hairs left on her cushions, do you remember?”
Lucia turned to John and held out the diminished plate of mince pies and biscuits. “Well, no,” she explained, ignoring Sherlock’s outburst, “she’s not, actually, she’s Jilly next-door’s sister.”
“Hey, I forgot the—what are you up to?” asked John, coming back into the flat abruptly, and belatedly realising from the sudden flurry of movement at the table in the sitting room that he had just caught Sherlock doing something that he didn't want to be caught doing. “What are you doing?” asked John, and he went over to the table, but only to get the shopping list that he’d forgotten. Sherlock stayed seated at the table but he was obviously hiding something underneath it in his lap. John had a horrible idea that he knew what it was. His heart sank. Sherlock had been twitchy since stopping smoking again and John was suspicious. He wasn't a control freak, but if Sherlock was hiding something, John just wanted to know what it was. Both Sherlock’s hands remained discretely hidden, out of sight. John retrieved his list calmly from the other side of the table where he’d left it, without looking at Sherlock, and stood opposite him, folding the piece of paper over to fit it into his wallet.
But Greg was quicker off the mark with his suggestion for what it had been. “—Quite interestin’?” he interrupted instantly, with a huge grin, and they both fell about laughing. Warm in Gregory’s bed, held close in Gregory’s arms, Mycroft thought he had laughed more in the last four hours than he had in the last six months.
“D’you mind if I…can I go and get them out of yer coat?” asked Greg, making as if to get out of the bed.
No need to flap.” He picked up his phone, opened it up to his messages, and held it out to John to see the screen. “See?” he said, as John leaned closer to look. “There are no messages - no texts or calls from either of them. If they were in any way unhappy or it hadn’t worked out brilliantly, I’d have had a furious text from Mycroft or a highly pissed-off voicemail from Greg…likely both. I’ve got neither…so, from that we can deduce that it all worked out fine without even raising a sweat.”
the filthy part of Greg’s mind responded immediately, but he said quickly, “On the stage - I can see you as the most poised, immaculately dressed, straight faced and haughty stand-up comedian I’ve ever seen. Your cutting wit would slay them dead!”
and that was when Lestrade arrived, and so he began to wax lyrical with various combinations of profanities and obscenities, describing the police and their numerous activities, and when Lestrade read him his rights and arrested him, he announced, 'What total utter fucking
John wasn’t really much of a cricketer and this conversation might as well be in Malaysian. “Right!” he said again, cheerfully, nodding, and looked at Sherlock.
Sherlock's father grimaced good-naturedly and waved a hand comically in the air, making John smile at the similarity to Sherlock once again. ”Oh, pffft!" he said. "
and he would have to answer it. So he put his violin down, not particularly gently, and stamped down the stairs in a foul temper and yanked open the door—to
I'm doing this with!’ The thought kept repeating itself, like he still couldn't quite believe this was happening, and as the the idea passed through his brain again, Sherlock lifted his head from the sofa, tilting his face to kiss John softly. When he laid his head back down, Sherlock said nothing and his face was unreadable, but his eyes were sultry and serious.
“This is really gorgeous, Mycroft,” he murmured, then added with a smile “…like you,” before he began to slip it down from Mycroft’s shoulders but then he stopped and hesitated. “Look, er…I’m not droppin’ any of your clothes on the floor,” he said, “sorry to be so dull and unspontaneous, but they’re just too bloody lovely to just end up in a crumpled heap on my carpet…”
John smiled back at him too. Then he looked down at the book in his lap and ran his fingers over the roughened back cover, which was sun-bleached from the desert sun and scraped and torn at one corner. He tapped the book thoughtfully on his knee twice, still looking thoughtfully down at it.
John saw then that what Sherlock was trying to say was essentially the same sentence that he himself was trying to say, and both of their sentences translated simply as the utterly terrifying combination of those three small and individually innocent words, “I” and “love” and “you”.
John frowned and listened carefully, but it became immediately obvious you really didn’t need to try to listen very
"I'm glad to be here, Mrs. Holmes," he said, and he meant it. She smiled broadly and gave the flowers a deep appreciative sniff. "Oh, please, it's Lucia, John!” she said, “
“Ooh, ooh, Sherlock!” she called excitedly from her armchair as he went towards the kitchen again fifteen minutes later. “Are you making me another gin and tonic yet?” she said, as he went past her - under instructions to get the second plate of Lucia’s vol-au-vents to pass around. He stopped and looked at her, the first empty plate of canapés still in his hand. “I wasn’t, but I am able to do so…” he said bluntly.
then, and so therefore it was a girlfriend who taught you how to do it and you obviously massaged each other…” He left the words,
Sherlock didn’t answer but he shoved his chair back a bit harshly (to show his irritation at Mycroft getting one over at him, John thought, perceptively), and then he stalked over to the fridge to get the milk.
Over a delicious breakfast of the (very good) granary toast topped with real butter and some wonderful homemade marmalade from Greg’s sister - Greg described this as ‘second breakfast’, seeing as the doughnuts he said counted as the first - Mycroft was thinking vaguely that he should perhaps give notice of his intention to leave soon. Not that he really wanted to, seeing as he was enjoying some small kind of Breakfast Heaven in Greg’s garden right now. It might be the usual tiny London garden, but it was an absolute sun-trap. Plus, a morning spent with Gregory Lestrade doing nothing at all was far preferable to what he
Sherlock obliged on both counts, undoing his buttons mainly with one hand and then dropping his ruined shirt carelessly to the floor, before turning to stand with his back to the window so John could see.
Sherlock was also barefoot in his pyjamas and dressing gown, but looking far more elegant than John, and he was drinking coffee and standing by the window, looking out at the street. He looked so decadent somehow, thought John. It was the way he carried himself, everything about him was luxury.
Mycroft laughed out loud at Greg’s comment. Of course he liked doughnuts. He just didn’t allow himself to indulge very often…but this was a special occasion, surely, he justified to himself. "I do," he said, finishing up and coming out of the small room.
By the time John had finished his illicit scone, and they had all had their second cups of tea (Gabriella her third), it was nearly time to get the train home. While they’d been chatting, Gabriella had packed the two larger paintings carefully together and installed them safely in a sturdy spare carrying frame, which she wrapped neatly in brown paper and some sheets of thin cardboard and tied with strong white gardening string. The two much smaller paintings could be carried far more easily in one hand, and she had packaged those two separately, so they could both carry one parcel each.
He took up a sheet of private writing paper from his top drawer and his favourite pen, thought for just a moment and then started to write.
John had tissues in his bedroom so the first part of the clean up was easy. He was glad to see Sherlock hadn't got anything on his expensive trousers. ‘Try explaining
“Oh, you—you idiot! Sherlock, you nutcase!” John yelped affectionately through the laughter when he could finally speak. “You utter—you total, utter maniac!”
said John slowly, more shocked at the fond warmth emanating from Mycroft’s text than at anything else.
and then he nodded and gestured at the flowers. "She'll love those!" he said, and then he added, “I think Sherlock's in the kitchen..."
he said easily, realising immediately what John had found and now sounding actually quite relieved. “That’s the note from Greg…I was going to tell you about it today - seeing as it’s—”
Sherlock waited for her to come back to the topic at hand. After a moment, she remembered it, and became more solemn once again. “So, you’re not an artist, then. What is it you two want from me?” she said, clearly now unsure what their purpose was.
and he glanced over to the room’s open doorway…just in time to see Mycroft lean back quickly on the desk chair, swivelling it round as he did so, and then - in a beautiful example of chair-ballet - propel himself forwards to the door to push it quietly but very firmly closed with his outstretched foot. He didn't even get up from his seat to do it.
“You go first, it’s your fish,” John said, turning to Agatha. “…Give me your hand,” he instructed her, “…and hold it still, palm up.” Agatha obediently held her hand up as John had requested, and John placed the fish down flat onto the centre of it.
“Oh, at last...You finally see it all now, don’t you, John?” he said, and, still smiling, still shining, he fixed John with his own unbreakable gaze. He swept his scarf and gloves off his lap onto the seat next to him without looking at them and stood up on the very gently swaying train to meet John halfway.
- to the front desk yesterday at about 10.20, 10.30…no one seemed to know who’d left it. My sergeant came in around 10.45 or 10.50 to get me…” he was frowning, trying to place the time, to give the evidence.
He turned it around another way; start again: him saying those nine words, “Well, you know I do love shocking you, John,” and he wanted to look directly at the words themselves to see why they wouldn't leave him alone. The words had faded away while he concentrated, but now they re-appeared again, helpfully clear, in their bright white, Times New Roman font and said, “Well, you, know, I, do, love, shocking, you, John.” And then in his head, “Well” just burst into a tiny puff of smoke and was gone, "you" and "know" joined together and fell off the front of that sentence, then the single word "do" fizzled away somehow and then "shocking" faded to a blur and then just quietly dropped away, and he was left with
Mycroft Holmes was fully versed on all the delicate nuances of human flirting behaviour, and he knew how to utilise them, if he wanted to. It was just that he hadn’t wanted to in such a very long time indeed. However, he wanted to now. He really wanted to now. He warmed up his rusty flirting muscles with a twitch of his eyebrow and a slight lift to the side of his mouth. Then he really went for it. “We are
‘What would I have done without you?’ he thought, looking at his fingers hiding the kiss of death underneath. Like a lipstick mark of where she’d been, but one that could not be rubbed away. ’If you had really died - again, for real, after losing you once already and then getting you back - I would never have recovered,’ he thought.
Lucia had been holding the fish carefully to cool it. “Sherlock?” asked John encouragingly, nodding at it, as Lucia held out the fish to her younger son.
Sherlock rose up, fast, lifting his upper body from the sofa and with both hands he grasped John's side and his shoulder and brought him down, like the predator that John had visualised earlier. But John was no easy, witless prey. He went down willingly, with a fierce response of his own. They fell on each other again and kissed like the world was ending.
“Look, what about the whisky on your trousers?” Greg asked, concerned about the trousers, but pretty damn interested in where the fingers were going. “It’ll definitely stain if we leave it!” he repeated and then he gasped, as the cool fingers slipped deliberately between the buttons of his shirt to encounter his bare skin.
I love the posh way you talk, Mycroft…” he murmured, and he smiled against Mycroft’s skin. “I think I might ‘ave said that already…!” He paused and kissed the bit he had smiled against. “But, ‘onestly, I could listen to you all night.”
he murmured, and bent absently to snatch it up, but then he saw that it was a very short, hand-written note; seemingly not in Sherlock’s handwriting and definitely not in his own.
"What were you doing? I thought you were just going to talk to the restaurant manager," John asked, carefully checking the depth of the cut and Sherlock's ribs on either side of the wound.
“Thanks, darling,” said Lucia to him in an aside, and then to Agatha she suggested, “Oh, do you want John to help you when you do them? He's a doctor!”
“Except for the fact that you weren’t even on the phone at all,” he retorted smartly, standing in the doorway, “so come on. Stop pretending to be busy! Dinner!”
John didn’t think he could trust himself right then with the amount of love he had for Sherlock. It was almost too much. Over all the years that John had been receiving them, no Valentine’s gift had ever meant more to him than this one.
"Guest bedroom?" prompted John, thinking that Sherlock looked like he did when some kind of massive deduction was taking place. He didn’t answer. “Where the guests sleep?” John asked with a grin.
A few more minutes passed, as Sherlock's muscles gave way under John's hands, and then Sherlock breathed in deeply again through his nose and tipped his head slowly over to the right as he exhaled, to gently stretch his neck. John had been watching him carefully, in the way that someone doing a job looks at the job that they are doing, but as Sherlock tipped his head over like that, the strong band of his left sternocleidomastoid muscle at the side of his throat became very prominent, very exposed, and from where he was standing above it, John noticed afresh the fading pink scar from the Stanley knife. Without thinking, John ran the tips of his fingers lightly down the length of the muscle from behind Sherlock's left ear, to where it attached, down onto his clavicle and sternum, intending to next work on the area around the scar, but as he slid his fingers smoothly down the muscle, Sherlock gasped.
Mycroft had to concede that Greg was absolutely right. Of course he wouldn't have. He would have watched from afar and pined a bit and then assumed that it would never happen, could never work, wasn't meant to be…and drunk his own Glenfarclas sedately on his own that Valentine’s day evening, thought the whole thing laughably ridiculous, and been none the wiser about what he
Sherlock grinned wolfishly, his eyes alight and fixed on John. He reached down and adjusted himself discretely through his trousers. “Oh. Well, that certainly works for me,” he said agreeably, still grinning, and then he added, “I’ll see you up there,” and he started to get up.
come from?' He was suddenly aware that he was pulling a shocked face at his own thought and he shook his head to clear it. Something was up with him at the moment and he didn't know what it was. "Keep that ice pack on the cut," he said instead, rather brusquely, and went off to get his scissors and surgical thread. He needed to tie some strands of Sherlock's hair together on either side of the scalp wound to hold it closed.
he said. “They don't listen to what the evidence is telling them. Sometimes the truth is right under their noses but still they don't see it.” He glanced at John quickly when he said this, but when John returned his look, Sherlock quickly looked away, giving John a very odd feeling that that line was meant for him.
John snorted again and nearly laughed outright. “Oh, I think I have something I want to press into you," he said, filthily. He was good at that sort of talk.
And lately sometimes, he thought of other things...things that he really hadn't thought about for a very long time. Things that had certainly been dormant since his very late boyhood and had re-surfaced briefly again in his university years when life had been so,
His recital completed, Sherlock strode back to the table, yanked his chair dramatically back out from under it and sat down on it again, hard. He leant back and crossed his legs, and then his arms, watching John and waiting for him to reply.
Greg said, afterwards, throwing himself back on the pillows to catch his breath as Mycroft got up for the bathroom. “I’m too old for this!” he continued, making Mycroft snort. “Forget the nutritious healthy breakfast I was gonna offer you. We need full-fat-lard-and-sugar calories to re-build our strength after that one…” he paused, realising what he’d just said carried a certain level of assumption, and then said hopefully, "Are you…were you plannin’ on staying’ for breakfast? Because just round the corner, there’s a nice shop - they do amazin’ doughnuts…?”
“Well, I would be," remarked Gabriella simply, "proud, I mean," and now to Sherlock, she said, “but that’s still simply amazing! How did you know, Mr. Holmes? And for that matter, tell me how you knew about me?”
Sherlock!” Greg repeated again and then he spluttered a bit and exclaimed, “Christ! This was all your bloody brother’s doing, wasn't it?” He shook his head, bursting into a huge disbelieving grin - he was amused and he was shocked, and he simply couldn't believe it. But Mycroft was not at all amused.
John had spotted his own name first at the end, and then went round the table to see who was opposite and where everyone else was.
Greg thought, desire building in his stomach like heat rising. “Well?” he repeated softly, teasingly.
defensive now, he realised, fists clenched involuntarily, and he thought savagely, 'Oh, well, that's just
This was far from the first time John had seen Sherlock half undressed, and he'd seen him in nothing more than a sheet plenty of times, both at home and even at the palace, but this was different somehow.
...” before Mycroft could even answer, Greg altered his position and pressed his lower body full against Mycroft’s, to find Mycroft’s erection with his own. “Oh! Well, I definitely got
“But Sherlock, they’ll both have seen through it as soon as they spoke to each other!” John persisted. He paused. “…Well, not casting any aspersions on Greg, but Mycroft will have realised and seen through it immediately.”
Greg’s eyebrows raised even higher, his mouth dropping open a little. “No, Mycroft, I didn’t!” he said, firmly, but he looked astounded. “Look, are we both going loopy ‘ere?” he asked, resting his hand which held the cigarette on the balcony and leaning onto it. He gestured with his free hand as he systematically went through the series of events. “I got a note from you - well, it wasn't
To deflect it, he launched into an immediate defensive attack. He flung his hand up in the air and banged it back on the desk dramatically, as a distraction. “Oh,
That was how it was. Always. Simple. But it was what he knew. Along with the drugs, of course. He knew those. He knew those
His once pristine white shirt now looked like a clumsy graffiti artist had been at work - but with a small cup of blood instead of spray paint. Blood stained the shirt fabric in a long, shallow, curving line that started high over Sherlock's left shoulder blade, moved outwards from his spine, and then curved down his back round towards the midline again to end abruptly on his left lower rib cage. The blood wasn't too excessive though, except for one area at the point of first contact where the wound was obviously deeper, but the rest of it clearly wasn't quite so deep - there was much less blood lower down. The shirt fabric was mostly cut through but it was otherwise clean - no obvious sign of any contaminants anyway - and the blood was all very fresh. "Bloody hell," remarked John, appropriately, moving closer. "Shirt off and come into the light," he instructed, going into professional mode at the sight of blood and moving the desk over a bit, so Sherlock could stand full in what dreary light there was coming through the windows.
“So what were you lookin’ at, at the party, then? said Greg, suddenly, thinking of his note. He lifted his own nearly empty glass again and drank, watching Mycroft as carefully as Mycroft had watched him.
upstairs on his phone.” She pulled an exasperated grimace-y face and made a gesture of frustration with both hands, making John laugh. It sounded like she knew exactly that that was
Meanwhile, Mycroft had been feeling increasingly awkward as Greg had been speaking.  “Ah…erm…” he fiddled with the edge of the duvet uncomfortably, trying to think of a polite excuse.
able to look up and say the next words directly to Sherlock, looking Sherlock directly in the eye, because he realised that for this part, he absolutely had to. “So do I, Sherlock,” he said clearly, "I feel...I feel differently about you, too. I think I always have.” Neither of them were making any sense whatsoever, but that didn't matter. It didn't matter at all. Now John knew. Mary had been right.
“ ‘Didn’t get on?’ ” said Mycroft, incredulously. “More likely the evil twins tried to neutralise it.”
A waitress appeared at their table. “Good evening, gentlemen,” she murmured pleasantly, politely handing them the menus and the wine list. She went through the specials on the tiny, ornate, hand-held blackboard, and then left them in peace to make their choices.
