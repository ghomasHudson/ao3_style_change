To his embarrassment, Sherlock’s voice cracks just enough to be noticeable, as he interjects, “It needed to be said, John. I really do not wish to be pitied, or mollycoddled - I just…had to say it. I needed you to know. I am aware you are not...that we could not be…”

And it's right. He was so much more than just a friend. He was nights spent out of breath from running, he was sarcasm and wit, he was takeaway and crap telly. He was severed heads in the freezer and eyeballs in the microwave. He was laughter and companionship. Sherlock was the one person who, with all his being, he had ever truly loved. Due to his own cowardice, the words had gone unspoken.

Drinking himself into madness over a man who isn’t even dead. Was it fun, Sherlock, having your secret? Watching me lose my life, my mind, nearly losing my career over your death? Did it keep you entertained while you were running down alleys someplace, coat flying behind you like the fucking superhero you think you are? Did you ever stop to pity me, Sherlock? Did you cry for me, poor wounded soldier all on his own? Or can a sociopath like you even feel hurt at all?”

John’s back straightens, his fists clenching fiercely at his side, nails biting into his palms to displace the rage, the pain. A gutteral sound issues from his throat - a wordless warning to the corporeal shade sitting before him, the ghost made flesh that, for once, would not be blinked away.
“You had no right,” he snarls.
Our faces collide in the most ungraceful, almost comical, way.

Gentle pressure against my hip… his free hand… shoving lightly, as John huffs a new, small little sound, like a laugh but softer… and closer… the exhalation is tickling my ear. The flannel is removed from my temple.

“You becoming angry with me and leaving.”

“Good.” John knows his own voice sounds desperate, sad, raw. “Then I’ve been saved the trouble.”
“Shit,” John mutters as cold metal closes around his left wrist, the other cuff clicking shut around Sherlock’s right.
Sherlock lets out a resigned sigh, and gives him a look that says he wants to move, but is afraid of doing so. He motions to the empty chair across from him, instead.
There is sound. A noise, his voice? Trying to speak. Failing. As the pad of a thumb timidly traces his lower lip.
They do, along with several other predictably colorful expletives, as he maneuvers me through the doorway and across the sitting room before dropping me unceremoniously onto the sofa. A bit more forceful than usual… then again I did almost get myself shot in front of him. Should really consider myself lucky that I got the butt end of a pistol to the skull instead of a bullet. Head hurts too much to really dwell on it. Lean back and sink into the cushions... rest my eyes as John leaves to get the med kit.
Lost in his thoughts, he takes a faltered step back and John’s eyes immediately flash with fear, his hand instinctively darting out to grasp Sherlock’s to keep him from retreating any closer to the ledge behind him. Fingers curling and squeezing protectively around his friend’s longer ones.
Whatever he expected, it wasn’t this.

Permit me a moment to relay more data which may inform your decision before it is too late.
He darts his eyes quickly back up to Sherlock’s. They are nearly turquoise in the low lighting of the cell. With that tiny fleck of amber. They truly are stunning eyes. As John studies them, he watches the flutter of long lashes when he blinks...and the slow widening of his pupils, the way that they have softened around the edges. There is none of the cold, icy stare of the detective - leaving behind only curiosity and an openness he isn’t normally privy to. It’s...nice. The warmth of Sherlock’s knees against his has seemed to spread, up his legs, into his spine, into his chest.
The moment is heavy with uncertainty before John laughs nervously.
Attempt to turn my head, but John’s hand on a flannel full of ice is still pressing me down.
“Not hard, that: you dying - it’s never funny when you joke about it.”
“Not one word from you could have changed his mind. Not when it was your life he was  choosing to save by jumping.”
Sherlock takes it and pushes his chair back, standing up without a word, to move into John’s space.

Sherlock’s eyes never leave his as he drops his dressing gown to the floor, and in one fluid motion, lifts his shirt over his head and spins around, to bare his pale torso to John. His pallid, too-thin body - now marred from shoulder blades to hip bones in a sickening criss-cross of rope-like scars, bruises, recently stitched gashes and burn marks.
His body is telling him to breathe. Not sure when he stopped, actually. When he forgot what air is for or what lungs do… but the hand on his chest sliding up to graze softly against his damp cheek makes him suck in a breath, like a drowning man surfacing from the deep.
“There’s something I should say...I’ve meant to say...always, but I never have. Since it is unlikely that we will ever meet again, I might as well say it now…”

“Mmm...It is, isn’t it?” and he can feel Sherlock’s face crinkle into a smile.

His voice drops to a dangerous low. “Are they dead?”

Sherlock kisses him once before pulling away and drawing his long body underneath the covers of their bed once more, tucking himself in right up to the chin. He wiggles dramatically to show that he has full intentions of making himself quite comfortable.
But John already knows. He knows because Sherlock has never allowed himself to sound this emotional before, not even at Baskerville. He knows because Sherlock is standing just a little too close to the edge of the rooftop for comfort, closer than even Sherlock’s admittedly dangerous judgement would normally allow.
But the real relief had come when the two of them had finally ‘gotten their crap together’ (as Lestrade had so fondly phrased it), and officially gotten together. This had come during a particularly long winter’s storm just before last Christmas, when the two of them had been shut in together for a solid two days with nothing but each other and just the right amount of whisky to keep them company. The combination had proved to be the perfect storm of circumstance needed to push them into each other’s arms, and John had never woken from a nightmare alone since. Usually, it was enough to roll over and determine that- yes, Sherlock’s chest was still rising and falling as he lay sleeping and yes, John could still feel his heart beating as he curled himself into Sherlock and willed himself back to sleep.
The words hit John like a punch to the gut. And then, as always, Sherlock tips forward and is falling, falling, and John can hear the sound of his best friend’s name tearing from his own throat, can feel his entire world tilting sideways as he thinks to himself:
And there it is again; John feels his knees weaken and heat pool in his belly at Sherlock’s words, but Sherlock has tossed the words out as though they are nothing. He completely blows John out of the water with his affections, and yet he speaks as though he were stating any other fact, as though he was simply discussing the fact that it may rain later today.
No matter how many times his mind replays this scene, he will never be prepared for it. It will never get any easier to watch someone you love murmur what was meant to be a final goodbye, before plummeting off a rooftop towards the cruel, unforgiving concrete below.
“Goodbye John.”
John shakes his head firmly. “No, you saved my life,” he reminds him. “You made the decision that, in the long run, would hurt me the least. Even if I couldn’t see it at the time.”
“Come back to me,” he murmured softly. “Whatever you’re thinking, don’t.”
As Sherlock speaks, John’s fingers are working to unfold several sheets of folded paper- the contents of the envelope. His breath hitches in his throat when his gaze rakes over line upon line of sheet music- for the violin, he is certain. John himself can make no sense of the notes- he has never been an adept musician- but in that moment, the rise and fall of notation on paper is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen in his life, and understanding and love transcend spoken language as he gazes upon this gift, the best thing he has ever received. He cannot understand a single note scrawled on the paper before him, and yet he understands unequivocally that it is the most beautiful and heartbreaking message to ever be conveyed, in any language.
“Sherlock,” John murmurs, cringing as he rubs at his own sleep-weary eyes with his free hand, struggling to sound composed. “Sorry if I woke you.”
“Right.” John is relieved to hear that Sherlock, too, seems shaken by the moment; he can hear it in the faint quiver of his voice, the trembling of his fingers against John’s wrists.
John keeps his mouth shut, still not trusting himself to speak and not tear up like a bloody idiot. Instead, he gives a firm nod, hands held together tightly behind his back. He gestures for Sherlock to continue.
“I love you,” John murmurs in disbelief. “God, how I love you.”
“Should I make us some tea?” John asks, hoping to avoid the conversation that he knows Sherlock will want to have.
But as he prepares himself to ask the most important question of his life, John suddenly finds he is far more confident about the ring he is about to offer up to Sherlock. After all, Sherlock had said himself that a traditional Valentine's Day gift should be equivalent to the extent of your affection towards that person.
“There are some conflicting accounts, but St. Valentine was thought to be a Roman priest, roughly in the third century AD,” Sherlock explains, his voice taking on a very serious tone all of a sudden. It takes all of John’s self-control not to burst into laughter; leave it to Sherlock Holmes to turn the most romantic night of the year into a history lesson.
“Let’s be honest,” he says, his voice taking on a huskier quality. “Sex was never off the table, Sherlock. When is it ever, with us?”
“Not exactly soulmate material, that.” John laughs heartily at the mental image of a seven year old Sherlock Holmes- a head full of curls and brilliant ideas, frowning in distaste at the fellow classmates he no doubt would’ve labelled idiotic. “So I’m your very first Valentine, huh?”
John jolts back into consciousness with a start, vaguely aware that there are fingers urgently gripping at his wrist and at his shoulder. It must still be the middle of the night, but someone has turned the bedside lamp on, filling the room with an dim yellow glow. John slowly comes back to awareness, trying to take in his surroundings and regulate his panicked breathing all at once. He is damp with sweat- his hair is sticking to his forehead and he can feel his white t-shirt sticking to the small of his back. He resists the urge to peel the shirt off over his head as he glances down at the long, slender fingers that are gripping urgently at his wrist. This is the grip that had pulled him from his wretched sleep, that had saved him from living the nightmare out to it’s inevitable bitter end- wherein John is left standing alone on the blood-soaked pavement, watching as the body of his best friend is wheeled away on a gurney. God, is he glad he was spared those last few moments of desperate panic.
He keeps his eyes fixed on the envelope while he speaks, his eyebrows knitted together, a sign that is of some concern to John. Sherlock usually only employs these habits when he is nervous, and only rarely. Slowly, he reaches across the distance between them, presenting the envelope to John as an offering.
“And I love you,” Sherlock returns simply, and there it is again; the absolute finality of his words that brook no argument. The conviction behind them is so deeply ingrained and solid that John knows Sherlock believes in this simple fact just as deeply as he believes in any body of science or criminology.
John Watson is scurrying along Baker Street in the height of the evening hustle and bustle. His cellphone is pressed against his ear as his boyfriend of ten months reprimands him to the high heavens for having the audacity to run a few minutes behind schedule.
“Yes, I thought so too,” Sherlock agrees happily, failing to see why this should be problematic. “Anyway, it was a dreadfully boring lesson in history. In fact, the only interesting thing I gathered from the entire process was that St. Valentine was the patron saint of beekeepers.” Sherlock brightens a little at this, squeezing John’s hand gently in excitement. “
Sherlock still looks doubtful, so John presses on, knowing at the very least that he has his full attention. “Look. Did losing you hurt like hell? Christ, Sherlock, of course it did. Every single day that you were gone is a day I don’t wish to remember, and for good reason. That was…. never mind what that was, okay? It was not a good time in my life, let’s just leave it at that.” John swallows hard, tamping down the ugly memories that threaten to rear their ugly heads at the mention of Sherlock’s time away. He has buried those demons deep within the darkest recesses of his mind, but that doesn’t mean they don’t like to come out to play when called upon or looked at too closely.
John cannot believe the depth of what he feels for the brilliant, beautiful man standing before him. Finally, he shakes his head, recognizing he is at a loss.
All at once, it is too much for John to comprehend, too much to bear in one moment.
” It feels as though all the air has been knocked from him, like he’s forgotten how to formulate a sentence. “Sherlock, what is all this?”
This was not what John had been expecting. “Sorry, what?” he asks with a frown. “How is that?”
An assortment of gifts are stacked on either end of the table- three different bouquets of flowers in makeshift vases, two separate envelopes with his name scrawled across the front in Sherlock’s frustratingly perfect cursive, enough boxes of chocolates and sweets to cause a bout of diabetes.  Laughably perched upon the nearest kitchen chair is an obnoxiously oversized stuffed bear- brown, clutching a pink plush heart. It all looks ridiculously out of place in 221B, and yet John simply adores the effort it must’ve taken Sherlock to throw it all together.
“Your favourite wine was an obvious choice, as was the takeout from Angelos that I picked up about an hour ago. It just needs to be reheated. And the candle, the candle is also obvious.”
Bingo.
“An Emperor at the time, Claudius the Second, had taken it upon himself to ban marriage. He thought that marriage would make for poor soldiers, although I fail to see the correlation between the two.
“We’re English,” John reminds him with a poor attempt at a smile. “Tea is always on.”
Sherlock still looks doubtful, but it’s a stubborn sort of doubt now, the kind that lingers only because Sherlock is Sherlock, and he has a tendency to fight back against self-forgiveness at every turn.
Sherlock scowls, coming back into his usual self. “Why on earth would I have wanted any of those horrid creatures for a Valentine? The boy next to me still ate paste in the second grade, John.”
He looks up at the detective with wide eyes, truly struck silent by this gesture.
Ah, there was the Sherlock Holmes that John knew and loved. And as John rolled his eyes and shuffled his way out towards the kitchen, listening to Sherlock’s soft laughter echo behind him, he rather felt that he wouldn’t trade him for all the world.
) still beating, perhaps a little more erratically than usual due to his concern for John’s current emotional state. John lets his hand rest there for a moment, his eyes falling shut in gratitude that Sherlock is here, Sherlock is alive and real and breathing beside him.
Sherlock bristles. “Of course not, John, it was a Roman Empire. St. Valentine was beheaded on February the fourteenth, this exact date in history.”
“It’s fine, Sherlock, it’s all fine,” he dismisses, and even if his boyfriend weren't the world’s most talented detective , he doubts he would’ve sounded convincing.
Sherlock’s mouth tightens. “You will be the first and
He angles his body towards Sherlock, who looks as ruffled as John has ever seen him. He is kneeling on the bed beside John, and has obviously just woken from sleep himself. His hair is a mess of bed-headed curls, his bleary eyes sleepy but filled with panic and concern. The hand that is not clutching at John’s wrist is on John’s opposite shoulder, fingers digging painfully just above John’s bicep. If he didn't look so panicked, he would be bloody adorable right now, so rumpled and sleepy.
Sherlock’s face tightens. “I hurt you,” he repeats, like a mantra, the self-loathing obvious.
John takes it willingly, his fingers already working the flap open as Sherlock rushes on. “The other envelope contains just a standard, overpriced greeting card,” he dismisses. “There’s a cute hedgehog on the front, it’s actually quite adorable. Overpriced, but adorable."
Sherlock nods his head, laying his hand against where John’s fingers rest on his cheek. “I understand,” he confirms. “Hugely romantic gestures are appreciated, but not an annual requirement.”
Sherlock himself stands at the foot of the kitchen table, dressed in his best suit with his hands folded neatly behind his back. John is convinced he has done something special to make those curls stand out perfectly against his forehead.  He has obviously gone to great lengths to make himself presentable tonight- as if John doesn’t find him absolutely irresistible when he’s just rolled out of bed and bleary-eyed with sleep.
” John breathes quietly, reaching out and tracing his fingers along the detective’s jawline. Sherlock falls quiet, his eyes fluttering shut as his hands come up to close over both of John’s against his cheeks. He holds them both still for a moment, neither of them saying a word. Hell, John is not sure if either of them even take a breath in that moment.
His leg is pushing at mine, wiggling into the space between my knees. Will myself to relax and allow him to shift and squirm behind me; allow him to position us both into this small space.
John takes the phone warily and glances down. A string of messages, sent and received, shows on the screen. He recognizes the first text received as the one he sent the night he visited Sherlock’s grave. However, instead of just continuing in a string of messages like the original... there are replies.
“There is an end part, yes...but given your hesitancy to continue, you may not be amenable to that, either.”

It would be so easy...here, in the dark...to try. After all these intimate questions, the openness, and that...whatever that last bit was, it seems like the next logical step. He wonders for a brief moment, if it is even possible Sherlock feels something, too.
[Sent] I wanted to make you laugh.
“Wait..” Sherlock whispers, reaching behind to grab the Belstaff and fanning it out over John before sliding in beside him.
John’s breath hitches, but he doesn’t move, and doesn’t blink away his own echoing tears.
Reaching out, he takes Sherlock's hand and tries to pull him down next to him.
“Your go,” John prods, gently.
His heart hammering, he whispers, “He's alive?” Balling his fists, he takes a step toward Mycroft, his eyes boring a hole into the taller man’s tailored greatcoat.
[Sent] Sentiment.
“Sh’lock...s’name’s Greg...and he’s Greg.”
He slams his mouth shut as the phrase hangs heavily in the air between them. He feels his heart hammering against his ribs as John freezes, mouth open with whatever counter argument he had been about to shout.
Sleep bleary but intense blue-grey eyes settle on him from across the pillow as he flops onto his back, still giggling.
Sherlock pauses before reading out the next question.
“Did it hurt?”
Had it been like this for him, too? Did he feel fear, or just hopelessness at that moment? Or, like John does now, both?
“I should have tried,” John states defeatedly. “You know what I said to him? The last words I spoke to his face? I called him a machine. A

“Like I don’t need any anymore.”
Sherlock stands, slowly,  and closes the distance between them in two strides, and for an instant John readies himself for a fight, part of him hoping for it.

He tries to turn toward the window to avoid any kind of eye contact, when John’s hand closes softly around his wrist.
[Sent] I want to know what to say.
“Does it really need saying, John?”

With a feather-light pressure, John turns Sherlock’s body around to face him.
John sucks in a shaky breath before interjecting quietly, “I...what you said. Me too. I wanted more. I still do…”

Sherlock’s response comes out vulnerable and small, with a noticeable tremble.
John looks back at the message on his own phone.

John steps closer to ruffle his hair,
That plan goes to hell and I inhale sharply as one hand brushes a piece of unruly hair behind my ear. He leans forward further, tongue poking out in concentration as he reaches to place the last one…
“He had snipers. That was the game. Three gunmen. Three targets. Three lives at stake. The Detective Inspector. Mrs Hudson. And, of course, you. He gave him no choice. No way out. No way to call them off. He killed himself to force Sherlock's move. His life… for yours. For theirs. Ruin his reputation and die in shame, or live and lose all those for whom he cares.”

“I don’t understand.”
Sherlock falls silent for a few moments, as if deciding how to proceed.
Wide, wet, still-frightened eyes flick down his face and back up, and he has never seen them look so unguarded as Sherlock swallows hard and goes on, slower and bit more assuredly.
John lets out a little ‘ooph’, and I can taste the warmth of his breath as it ghosts against my mouth. Wonder for an instant what it would be like to chase it back to its origin… before I realize I already am. His lips are softer than I would have thought. He exhales through his nose harshly at the contact but incredulously he does not pull away, instead doing the opposite (always surprising me, John Watson), pressing back, a bit tentatively, into mine.

“What’s it feel like now?”
“M’too drunk. S’your fault...with making s’much wine…”
John’s slides his hand back into Sherlock’s hair, letting dark curls slide between his fingers.

Blonde lashes flutter closed, as Sherlock’s lips move slowly to his ear,
Slide my hand cautiously down his arm, to the spot where his hand is gripping my knee for support, and gently cover it with my own. Something like a mild electric shock buzzes through my nerves at the contact. Somehow this small act seems almost more intimate than the kissing.

It was stupid, I know it was stupid...but it was
The color in Sherlock’s face is brighter now as he ducks his head, pretending to glance at his mobile.
“Sherlock...what are you...?” he starts, hating the obvious hitch in his voice.
“ME? That is RICH, Sher...I do fucking everything around here, cook, clean, make the tea...How in the HELL am I the one who is....”
The sound of a shuddered breath brings him back to the present.
“I was wrong, John. Caring, sometimes, IS an advantage, and sentiment...feelings...are not always a mistake...though the pain that comes with them...well…” a pause, another sigh, “I suppose...in some cases...the hurt is worth it.”

. We had a row and I stormed off. After that it was only the phone call. I should have known it was a set-up. I was too late getting back here. I should have said more in that call. I should have tried to stop it, I should have…” His voice cracks and he averts his stinging eyes from the elder Holmes.
“There are things I should have said, that I meant to say, always, and never have. To answer the second half of the question first - they are things I kept to myself out of fear...fear of losing the one person who matters most to me in this world.”
… and that I have absolutely NO idea what I am to do next.
John looks up, face tense, lips pursed, obviously trying to keep whatever emotion he is feeling off his features.
John turns away, avoids his eyes for a moment, and Sherlock knows he knows. Knows what that “who knows” means. Knows he isn’t coming back from this.
[Sent] But there is nothing here, no danger, no injury, that terrifies me like you are doing, John. I would strangle my brother, right now, if the opportunity presented itself, for not allowing me even one minute of time to contact you. I have no idea how to comfort or help you... but I would try.
John's eyes still haven't refocused enough to see his friend's face in the darkness, and he is left to ponder what his tone might mean.
His voice falters, and John, not even realizing he is doing it, has shuffled closer, their knees no longer bumping, but pressed firmly together.
“Oh, you have no idea, you bastard,” John growls, but stands at parade rest, glowering at the taller man.
“Pity they have to be positive,” John says with a smirk, and gets leveled with a glare in return. “Just JOKING, take it easy...ok, umm...right.” John stares at his hands, fidgeting with a loose string on his sleeve.

“Lucky I’ve some Christmas spirit, gents; brought ya some nibbles and water now that you’ve sobered up a bit...sorry, only had the one blanket...you two can fight over it...or share it.” He winks as he turns to shut the door, calling back, “Merry Christmas!” over his shoulder as he closes it behind him.
No. Mycroft. Just, no. You can either stay there and watch or you can piss the fuck off.” He carefully steps up fully onto the ledge.

“Doesn’t sound like much of a game...sounds like truth or dare without the dare...so we just ask each other questions?”
“I like it…’specially when it’s disheveled and unruly looking...it looks...soft.” John says quietly, and doesn’t miss the slight flush of color tinting his friend’s face.
“Thats seven, Sherlock, you can stop…”

“John...this is where I broke your heart.”

He lets himself focus on Sherlock’s face, avoiding the eye contact he is supposed to be maintaining...his nose, the tiny freckles you would miss if you didn’t know they were there...that perfectly shaped mouth…
And Sherlock leans down... presses his forehead lightly to John’s. Soft curls tickling his skin where they meet. So close.
John’s fists are clenched tightly at his sides, but he stays silent, giving a small nod of acceptance.
“I was awarded five minutes. Allow me to continue and then, if you must, you can do as you please.”

John goes rigid. “You heard that, then. ‘Course you did.”
John’s face softens, only slightly, and he can see the effort his friend is putting in to keep himself in check...and he can see it failing. There is so much sadness there that Sherlock can’t take it. He can’t do this...can’t let that sadness be the last look he sees. It isn’t fair. He is going to board a plane carrying him to his execution… and John will be left with Mary. It wouldn’t be right to put these words out there now, when there is no hope and no chance for them to be more than just a voice in the wind. To interfere, to come any further between John and his wife - as much as he despises the idea of leaving him with her - it’s selfish. It would be painful, and he doesn’t want that to be the last memory John has of him. So he improvises…
What seems like hours later, Sherlock graciously offers him the sole bench and the blanket to sleep on, but John just shakes his head and smiles in the dark.

“I retrieved it after… when the other body was removed. Small act of sentiment on my part. It began receiving messages shortly after. All of them from one number. All of them from you, Dr. Watson.”
“Sit, John? Please? Let me attempt to explain?”
“COURTESY? How is sending me out in the cold showing COURTESY, JOHN?!” his voice still rising, not quite yelling, but close enough.
“There are things I need to say, John, if you let me. The sort of things in which I am not well versed.”
[Sent] There is no Sherlock Holmes without John Watson…
“How?!” John’s voice cracks, his soldier’s demeanor breaking down around him. “You think I care one bit for HOW you d-did this? Because you didn’t just DO this, Sherlock. You did this TO ME. I’ve spent years - YEARS, Sherlock - believing that I killed my best friend. Do you have any idea what that’s like? Believing that, if only you’d said something different, done something sooner, that person would still be alive. Can you even imagine what that’s like?”

He slides off the bench to sit across from his friend, who studies his mobile for another minute before setting it on his lap.
He can see Sherlock’s eyebrow arch and his lips twitch in a half-smile at the attempted humour but, with the underlying nervousness in that once overconfident voice, it falls flat.

Sherlock dips his head, using his free hand to lift John’s chin until their eyes meet.
[Sent] Unsure how long it will take, but I will…
He freezes, panic setting in; an adrenaline rush, skyrocketing his pulse. Despite the instability in his voice, John steps closer, eyes never leaving his, searching for something...something he must have found, as he nods and soldiers on.
[Sent] John... I can’t help you…
“36.”
“Everything,” Sherlock promises, his tone at once pained and joyful.
[Sent] I will.
He kneels in front me, sighing in exasperation, before taking my chin in one calloused hand (hope he doesn't notice the shiver that runs through me at the touch), turning my face this way and that before grabbing a small flashlight and flicking it back and forth between my eyes.
John gives it a few moments before he prods him,“Didn’t have what?”
Sherlock was the only person whose loss had ever brought Captain John Watson to his knees... quite literally.
[Sent] If I could, I would play for you for hours just to prevent this.
Now John knows he is blushing too. He sees why, listening to all the things his friend notices and likes about him. It’s nice...but a bit unnerving. He feels a bit vulnerable and he can see the same on Sherlock’s face as well.
“So we're tryin to catch your brother, and Lestrade...together-together? Hmm? Why’s it bother you s’much?”
For a brief instant, anger finally flashes across Sherlock’s features as he raises his eyes to John’s again - only to be replaced, immediately, with something completely different, a reaction John knows too well - something bordering on pain and the edge of actual panic.

John worries his lip as tears threaten to slip free.
His tellingly light steps tred seventeen times toward a knob which feels unnervingly alien under his palm, and he slips inside, into the near-darkness, and closes the door behind him before looking up.

Strange, this. Going from the intensity of the previous moment to the surrealness of sitting in the dark. Not having moved or spoken. Like they are still playing the game, or whatever this is, even without being able to see anymore. Sherlock’s mobile had gone dark a few seconds after the guard turned out the lights. Battery must’ve gone before they hit the 4 minutes.
“Lucky git,” he mutters, reaching for a flannel he must have dampened while in the loo.
John’s fingers trace upward along his jaw, resting against his face as he gives a quick shake of his head. The first traitorous drip of moisture escapes his eye.
[Sent]  I had to tell him.
[Sent] Being as it may end up my last chance to ask this of you...
Sherlock chokes back a whimper at the realization that John is not pulling away, but is kissing him back. The hand not in his own has slid up into his hair, hesitant at first, then twisting into his curls, pulling him forward, pressing them more firmly together.
“Right, ok. Then I...if this is my last chance to…” his voice breaks, and his other hand comes up to grip Sherlock’s elbow.
“Dull.”
John’s gentle, “Can I…” as calloused fingers reach up to stroke a prominent cheekbone.
“Always wondered what it felt like to wear this thing…s’heavy” John murmurs sleepily, slipping one arm around Sherlock's back under the coat.

"You left Bart's in a hurry; however, you changed your mind halfway. You detoured to the park instead - had an internal crisis - decided to walk back, but took your time, still undecided about returning. Despite the cold, you chose the longest and most indirect route.

After you crossed, you spent a considerable amount of time outside, pacing - oscillating on the pavement, John?”
[Sent] Though I do not say that with the reproach I once would have. I say it, now, in awe, that you would feel so intense a loss for someone like myself.
“So we stare at each other for 4 minutes? What the hell kind of game is this?”

Sherlock looks at the ground nervously for a moment before going on.
It’s too quiet. Especially after all the talking. Also a bit nerve wracking, John thinks, with Sherlock’s intense eyes locked on him. He learned more about the man tonight than he has in all the time they have lived together. This awkward as hell game or whatever it is at least had an upside. He wonders if now it is a test of wills, to see if one will talk first and lose.

“Uh, COURTESY, maybe? Would be nice sometimes if you could manage it!” John’s hands are clenched at his sides, and he now stands within a foot of his flatmate.

It sounds
...they suit you.”
Here, alone, he would finally do it. That niggling desire he had been fighting. Now. Tonight. It would end. There would be no note. Who would need one? No pills or alcohol or guns. No easy out.
"Of course, yes, if I agree the circumstances offer no other option, then yes, you have my word, John."
It had been late afternoon when at Hudson’s gentle urging, John had awoken from his nap.  His first sight upon opening his eyes had been of Sherlock, standing tall and smartly attired once more in his officer’s uniform.  He appeared remarkably recovered although John’s keen eye noted that his complexion was pale and his posture stiff.  To a casual observer, however, he would appear as a man in the peak of health.
John blushed, “I didn’t mean… I’m just worried…” he trailed off.
Lestrade’s grin widened.  He lifted his coffee cup.  He had a question for Sherlock about a current case but he’d wait a few minutes before making his way upstairs to the flat.
Hudson bent toward him to say quietly, “We’ve little money left I’m afraid. M’lord’s possessions being gone as they are, it’s left us with not much to go on.” He was trying to hide his concern but John was fully aware of the seriousness of their situation, if without adequate funds.
"Oh, dear God, where did that thought come from!?" John exclaimed to himself in silent horror. "Heaven above, he can't know what I just imagined; I must get off of his lap! Now!"
The Captain gone once more, Lord Holmes rolled his eyes in irritation. "God, I hate sailing," he exclaimed. "Hudson, we are never going to sea again. I don't care what bloody Mycroft wants! The sooner we are back on solid ground, the better!"
At first John had been annoyed, angry even. Eventually however, his own feelings for Sherlock growing, he’d started to wonder if there was something more to it than what he had judged to be childish petulance on Sherlock’s part.  Was it possible that Sherlock’s behaviour was the result of real pain, pain that came from tender feelings that Sherlock was struggling with?  If it was anyone else John simply would have asked.  But Sherlock was not a man you simply asked something like that.
“He’s a different boy when he isn’t afraid, isn’t he? Do you think that he is happy being with me – rather, I mean, with us, Hudson?”
"Curse the blasted woman! And curse bloody Mycroft as well!"
"No, John, it is too dangerous. I cannot allow it!"
And when John did not answer, he continued, "It's something to do with your father, isn't it?" A sick sensation was rising in Lord Holmes' chest as he contemplated the possibilities. "He was planning something… a way to obtain money perhaps? Is that why you are here, John?"
Hudson nodded and hid a slight smile.  Those responsible for John’s suffering were about to discover the folly of attracting the negative attention of Lord Holmes. He might be singular at the times but Sherlock loathed injustice of any kind and was relentless in his pursuit of those who would exploit, both in his work and private life − and as Hudson had already witnessed, with regard to John’s security, his Lordship was doubly ruthless.
He was one significant step closer to England, his main goal, although admittedly it had not been at the forefront of his mind for the last several days.  Nevertheless, to land on English soil was still the thing he desired most, wasn’t it? It was but somehow it didn’t hold the lustre it had before.  England, yes, but he found himself thinking that he would only be happy if he was with Lord Holmes.   If not to stay with him, at least to be able to see him sometimes.
"Perhaps I could help." John could have bitten his tongue at the presumptuousness of this statement. He was nobody and nothing to Lord Holmes except a nuisance and a burden. He cast his eyes downward in humility waiting for a reprimand or worse.
"Yes, Master John, what do you need?"
Sherlock studied each man individually, anticipating what their reactions might be to an escape attempt. His eyes rested on the stocky, barrel-chested soldier whom he had noted earlier as a secondary leader. He observed that the man seemed to be distracted; staring at John rather than joining in the argument with his fellows. Sherlock wondered what sort of risk the man thought John could be, John gave every appearance of being just a shy cabin boy of no threat...
As the evening progressed, the storm intensified. Shouts could be heard from on deck above the roar of the wind and waves, where the crew were struggling to control the vessel. Finally with a resigned huff, Lord Holmes turned to Hudson, who had just appeared with an update from the Captain, and requested oilskins and boots, announcing that he was going on deck to assist the crew.
He continued, “Once we are onboard the train you must rest. The strain of the last several days has taken it toll on all of us, I believe.”
John had never heard of this phenomenon before but felt it best to say nothing. Perhaps his head was still muddled.
When John had finished and replaced the glass on the table, Lord Holmes spoke. "John, I am unfamiliar with children such as yourself, in general, and stowaways as a sub-set particularly. However, I believe, and Hudson has confirmed, that our present circumstances call for the exercise of social responsibility on my part." He didn't sound irritated, he seemed to be merely reviewing the facts. John made a sound of protest but was silenced by a wave of Lord Holmes' hand as he continued, "As I have no knowledge or experience in this area, I will be taking a consultative approach to carrying out my duty." After this puzzling announcement Lord Holmes fell silent; steepling his fingers against his chin in a gesture suggesting deep thought. John who was now feeling light-headed from the wine in addition to exhausted, had no trouble remaining quiet.
It was a lovely hotel, flowering vines bedecked its white verandahs which were further shaded by spreading trees.  Its wide stone terraces opened onto the beach where reclining chairs were placed in secluded spots in the shade.  Waves lapped against a small key where sailing and rowing boats and a swim float were located for the enjoyment of holidaying guests. Not that the three had any company; they appeared to be the only guests staying at the hotel; perhaps not surprisingly given that Lesbos was in Turkish territory.  Tourists, almost certainly, would be frightened away by the talk of war in the region.
John blushed. "That you and Lady Adler were…romantically…um." His blush deepened.
None of it was true of course, John's late father had left a considerable amount of money to his wife and infant son, but once John's mother, always a delicate woman and desperately lost without John's father, had been bullied into marrying the Major, she had lost control of the money. Grief-stricken and hopeless she had succumbed to her weak health and had died while John was still very young.
Lord Holmes said sharply, "Certainly not, John! It's far too dangerous on deck! You will be swept away! You will stay here where it is safe!"
Never mind, he thought fiercely as he made his way slowly from the cedar to the apple tree that overhung the embassy's garden wall. Tomorrow, if everything went as planned, he would escape Constantinople aboard Lord Holmes' sleek private yacht the Wind Shadow to a safer and better life. The yacht was now moored at the city's busy docks but as John had just heard she would tomorrow be setting sail for England. He intended to be on-board, well hidden and safe at last from his stepfather before she began the first leg of her journey home. He had no time for morose thoughts; he must move quickly to make his preparations for the trip and say goodbye to Molly.
Lord Holmes didn't pretend to misunderstand.  His response was unhesitating. All Englishmen understood that after the shocking events of Cawnpore, India in 1857, no honourable man would allow a woman or child to risk degradation at the hands of captors. Noble death was far preferable.
Out in the once more dim silence of the garden, John moved for the first time in many minutes, wincing in pain as the bark of the tree scraped his raw back and bruised legs and arms. He tried to ignore the pain and the suffocating sense of shame that washed over him as he struggled to move. Why had he never been able to stand up to his stepfather, he wondered? He despised himself for the weakness and fear that he felt in the presence of the man. John was seventeen now, almost eighteen, not a boy anymore, but still he felt powerless to defend himself when confronted with his stepfather's aggressive hatred for him. Blinded by shame, however, John failed to recognize his own overwhelming disadvantage relative to his stepfather including the smallness of his stature, as much a result of childhood neglect as familial inheritance, and his near constant state of injury including a chronic limp, disabled shoulder and a debilitating tremor in his left hand.
Glancing at John who was swaying tiredly although making a valiant effort to drink his soup, Lord Holmes nodded in agreement.
"Yes, my Lord, I do!"
John shuddered involuntarily at the memory of the soldiers.  Hudson, although not mistaking the reason for John’s frightened reaction, responded lightly with, “There’s no reason to be concerned about missing our way in the dark, Master John.  His Lordship has eyes like a cat at night, be it London alleys or mountainsides, it’s all the same to him.”
Sherlock’s voice took on a note of grim satisfaction, “Excellent. Thank you, Hudson.”
Thus reassured, John was settled for sleep. Hudson left a carafe of water by his bedside, lit a comfortingly dim night lamp, wished him a polite good night and quietly withdrew. John was asleep in seconds.
It was following dinner that the Captain appeared to inform his Lordship that bad weather was approaching. And indeed, already the sea was noticeably rougher and the boat was beginning to heave unsteadily.
"My Lord," cautioned Hudson, who was dusting and saw John start nervously at Lord Holmes’ outburst.
John was indeed being dragged away from Sherlock and Hudson.  Terror rising in his throat, he resisted his abductor, digging his heels into the ground, but it was unable to obtain a solid purchase on the sand smoothed rock. It was just out of sight of the fire that he found himself thrown to the ground, stunned almost senseless from the force of his landing.   He had no chance to recover before the soldier threw himself on top of him.
Putting an exploratory hand to his head and seeing it come away bloody, Lord Holmes nevertheless shrugged his shoulders and appeared as though he intended to leave again now that he had found John to be safe and sound.
Tired as he was, John felt a prickling feeling of unease as they settled on the smooth floor.  After the heat of the day, the night air was cold, even in the shelter of the cave. Without the benefit of starlight, it was oppressively dark as well. To John, it was frighteningly devoid of light, warmth and comfort and he found painful memories flooding his mind. He tried to force the distressing images away but he was unable to dispel the idea of how alike it was to the cell his stepfather had once locked him in after beating him over some imagined misdeed. That stone-floored room had been airless and dark too and small John, injured and afraid his stepfather would leave him to perish in the dark prison as he threatened, had huddled alone for hours in wretched suffering.
John strained his eyes desperately hoping to see the light of a cottage or other dwelling where they might ask for shelter. He hadn’t much hope given that the night was well advanced by now and most inhabitants of Gelibolu would be long abed.
When he reached his home, John gathered his jacket and a blanket and forced his sore feet into the only pair of boots he owned. He had no money to take with him but he had three pieces of his mother's jewellery carefully sewn into the lining of his canvas jacket; a locket containing her picture, a small diamond ring and a crescent moon diamond brooch, the latter especially treasured because it had been a gift to her from her beloved first husband, John's father. They were all John possessed in the world; he had found them years ago at the bottom of a long forgotten trunk in their small attic and had kept them a carefully guarded secret from his stepfather ever since.
"By all means John, I confess I quite miss my head bandage. I've become accustomed to your ministrations; I'd be lost without my physician." His tone was lighthearted in an attempt to ease John's obvious anxiety, but his complexion, if anything, was even paler than before and beads of perspiration were now visible on his forehead.
John, stunned at this intimate assessment of himself by a complete stranger, stared back at Lord Holmes in alarm. "How could you possibly know all that?" he choked. "Was it Dr. Hooper? But Molly promised…"
They had arisen early and packed their few belongings. Hudson had distributed bread and cheese and they'd drunk more of their water. No one suggested lighting a fire to boil tea although hot tea would have been welcome. It was clear now that the hills weren't safe in such unsettled times and a fire would alert others to their presence. The deserting soldiers weren't a concern any longer but the nearer they drew to Gelibolu, the greater their risk of running into bandits or brigands. Gangs of cutthroats were always a risk to travelers on foot.
"Hudson!" he said urgently, "His wound, the bleeding!"
"I'm sorry John, I made a mistake. I underestimated the danger... I will never allow anything like that to happen to you again. I swear it." John thought he felt Sherlock’s cheek touch his hair perhaps in a gesture of remorse or a plea for forgiveness before he raised his head once more and struck out into the night, Hudson close at their side.
Hudson hid another small smile.
"I must thank you John, for all your help last night, not only do you have valuable medical skills, but you showed courage that few men, let alone boys your age can demonstrate." Lord Holmes laid a light hand on John's arm.
“Delighted, Your Grace.”
“Lord Holmes, You’ve met my nephew Lord Westry have you not?”
John’s heart felt immeasurably higher upon hearing this and he was able to smile and nod his agreement to Lord Holmes.
There was a tense silence while Lord Holmes stared at Hudson before finally capitulating and turning to John. "John, I…." he began, but seemed at a loss to continue. He began again, "I'm honoured that you wish to accompany me and offer your assistance, please understand that I refused only because I'm concerned with your safety. I would wish that you stay with the Captain for no reason other than my desire to ensure that. Our route will be very dangerous, but knowing this, if you still wish to accompany Hudson and me, then I accept your offer of assistance with gratitude."
Major Williams grasped John's sore shoulder and pulled John into his study, declaring that he had someone who wished to meet him. Fearful, although he wasn't certain why, John watched warily as the unknown man whose voice he had heard turned from the window to face him. He was an expensively dressed older man, heavy and oily in appearance with a puffy face; showing clear signs of dissipation around his pouched eyes and thin lips. His hooded gaze slid over John in a calculating manner, lingering on the boyish line of John's small waist and hips. He gave no greeting, nor did John's stepfather introduce him. Instead, in a manner which made John's skin crawl, the stranger licked his lips and indicated with one finger to John that he should turn to face the wall. Reluctantly John obeyed, only to shiver in revulsion as he felt the stranger's eyes slide down his back. John spun around quickly to face both men again, backing instinctively toward the perceived safety of the study's desk.
Around mid-morning, John had joined Lord Holmes to drink a cup of coffee and eat the omelette which Hudson had managed to prepare for them in what remained of the galley, when the first mate, acting on orders from the Captain who was fully occupied trying to keep the boat afloat, knocked on Lord Holmes' cabin door with a message.
Once rested and following another walk on deck, John rejoined Lord Holmes and set to work translating Latin once more. The breakthrough moment occurred in the late afternoon, when, with an elated clap of his hands and with an expression of excited delight, Lord Holmes leapt up and began digging through one of the piles of papers, selecting some and throwing others aside. "John! That's it, that's how it works! We've got it! Do you see?"
“Driver, to the station, private coaches’ yard!” Lord Holmes ordered.
Now, looking at the sea, he chided himself severely. He would have to be far more careful in the future, if he was to keep his feelings for Lord Holmes a secret! And that Lord Holmes should learn of them was unthinkable; they must remain his secret forever, however difficult that may be.
Even his voice is wet, thought John frantically.
Once breakfast was finished and his injured back once more attended to, John, comfortably and handsomely dressed in a new linen shirt and light-weight broadcloth trousers, was bidden to go above deck to take in the fresh sea air. Once there, he paused to watch the early sunlight reflect up from the sea in what looked like a fountain of diamonds glistening against the Wind Shadow’s pristine white hull.  As he strolled past the wheelhouse, John was surprised to receive a courteous nod from a seaman polishing brass.  He was unaware that Hudson, at Lord Holmes direction, had informed the Captain that John was now a guest of his Lordship and was to be treated accordingly.
To John’s relief Sherlock nodded his agreement and they picked their way around boulders toward what turned out to be a substantial cavern carved out of the hillside; perhaps by an ancient stream. By the time they reached it the daylight had faded entirely.
The next time John awoke it was to find himself lying in the shade of a myrtle bush on thick grass with a clump of purple crocus not far from his nose.  The air was warm and fragrant. He blinked as several honey bees, busily extracting nectar from the flowers, came into focus.   He could hear Sherlock and Hudson conversing quietly nearby and was about to close his eyes again, given the peacefulness of it all, when suddenly the events of last night came flooding back into his mind.
Lord Holmes raised his eyebrows amused, "Doctor's orders, John Watson?"
Hudson continued, "One blessing is that the shoreline in this region is not rocky, it's mostly sand so we won't be dashed on the rocks if it comes to that."
And so John crept onto the bed, trying to take up as little space as possible and to avoid touching Sherlock. It was bliss as well as torture to be so close to Lord Holmes!  Trying to control his accelerating heart beat and breath, bitter thoughts of self-recrimination over his foolishness to fall in love with a man as unattainable as the Earl filled John's mind.  Mercifully, he wasn’t able to dwell on his plight long though, he fell asleep almost as soon as he lay his head down.
John awoke to a nudge on his shoulder and the offer of a steaming cup of tea from Hudson, who, if he saw anything unusual about his master giving up half of his bunk and all of his blanket to John beside him, gave no sign of it. Hudson is a miracle worker, thought John, striving to straighten his sore limbs and gratefully accepting the tea.
Hudson spoke. “I had a word with the clerk last night Sir, we’ve rooms engaged at a modest establishment not far from here. Transportation has been arranged and if I’m not mistaken is waiting to convey us from the dock.”
“We need to boil everything Hudson, the linen, my needles and the germander.”
Finding this request impossible to refuse, John reluctantly complied. He very much wanted to stay with Lord Holmes, who he was certain was not an experienced sailor but could do nothing but follow Hudson to the boat's sick quarters. He was soon taken up in providing what medical treatment he could to the injured sailors. The Wind Shadow was well stocked with up-to-date medical supplies so he and Hudson were able to make them reasonably comfortable. Several times over the next few hours he asked Hudson about Lord Holmes and each time he was patiently assured that his Lordship was well.
"What?! Hudson!"
They were traversing the edge of a gully near the foot of a hill, its grey marble stone seamed and cracked, when Hudson suggested they stop for the night.
So unhappy was he, that he hardly heard what the Duchess said next, “How disappointing for you, John, it will be far too late for you to stay up. This will be a grown-ups party!”
After a brief confab as to what their next steps would be, Lord Holmes turned to John, "One more thing John, you must stop referring to me as Lord Holmes. My Christian name is Sherlock." Then, belying the seriousness of his tone, he winked at John and said, "A difficult name to forget, I'm told."
John knew that speed was essential. He was extremely worried. They had minimal medicinal supplies; certainly nothing to deal properly with knife wounds. Sherlock had lost a not inconsiderable amount of blood; and even if they could stop the bleeding temporarily and apply a basic antiseptic, he still needed stitches. They must escape somehow.
"Shhhh… just rest John, just rest here," Sherlock murmured, not stopping his stroking of John's back. "I have you. You got away. You’re safe now. It's alright now. Just rest."
Remembering Hudson’s previous care of him, John nodded his consent and Sherlock stepped back to allow Hudson to kneel at John’s side.  Hudson was gentle but quick with his examination and once finished he nodded to Sherlock who tentatively made to lift John but then stopped, unsure of himself.  John, too exhausted to explain, simply raised his arms to Sherlock, who, full of relief at this gesture of trust, lifted him into his arms and turned to carry him away from that terrible place.
When Sherlock spoke, his voice almost normal, it was to ask of Hudson, "A way out?"
"Would you… if I ask...would you? I would rather die than be taken. Do you understand?" John's voice was barely a whisper. "I cannot be captured, please…"
“I suggest not, Master John,” Hudson advised calmly. “We’ll be stopping shortly anyway to wait for dawn and daylight.  We are only going as far tonight as to be beyond the reach of… possible pursuers. ”
Hearing Sherlock’s voice, full of tenderness and compassion, and absorbing his comforting touch, John responded like a tender new leaf to the first rays of spring sunlight. He unfurled his body against Sherlock's with a sigh, wrapped his arms around the man and went limp.
There was nothing to do now but wait and pray that warmth and rest would help Sherlock overcome the immediate shock of his injury.  John had read the research of French surgeon Alfred Velpeau with great interest particularly the famous surgeon’s theory of nervous shock which he had observed in patients with gunshot wounds. John knew that Sherlock must be kept quiet and warm if he was to not succumb to it. Once the time for shock was passed safely, John could stitch the wound as it required.
He sat up in a hurry, instantly regretting it as a wave of dizziness swamped him.  Before he could slump over though, Hudson was at his side with a steadying arm and an offer of water.  John accepted the drink gratefully and looked about him.  The three of them were sitting on a grassy hillside dotted with shrubs; mostly olives, myrtles and laurels. Hudson was beside him and Sherlock close by, at present gazing across a valley spread out before them. Feeling inexplicably awkward when Sherlock turned and smiled at him, John turned his head away hastily to see behind them, quite some way behind them, the grey rocky slopes of the mountains they had obviously just traversed.
The Duchess gushed, “Well, how noble of you Lord Holmes to take on the burden of a ward! But of course I understand, I myself simply adore children!” She cast her glance downward on John and declared, “How exciting, dear, to have been educated abroad! In Greece no less! I presume they have schools here?”
The man who had wished to meet him was a buyer and seller of boys! It seemed incredible! John could hardly believe that his stepfather would stoop so low as to sell his own stepson into prostitution but every instinct told John it was true. Shocked and frightened he tried to be rational, to think of what he could do to save himself. While he knew little of prostitution, he was aware of the lucrative slave trade carried out by Barbary pirates in waters throughout the Mediterranean region; the practice had been going on for centuries. He knew also of Constantinople's slave market and he had even heard the rumours of light skinned, fair-haired boys in Turkey's bathhouses and coffee houses, there to fulfill the desires of the men who paid for them. But a lot of gossip circulated among the bored expatriate community and he'd purposely ignored most of it. However, now it was clear that, at least in this, it had been fact and no false rumour.
John’s eyes scan the kitchen table. All of the lab equipment has been cleared out for the evening, tucked away for safekeeping. It looks as though Sherlock has actually wiped the countertops down, so John assumes that beneath the red tablecloth that they hadn’t owned this morning, their table may actually be sanitary for the first time in its existence.
John rolls his eyes. He lays the sheet music and opened envelope down on the table behind them. He places his hands on Sherlock’s waist, delicate.
“Of course it has a point.” Sherlock confirms. “St. Valentine did not agree with the Emperor’s ruling, and so he would arrange to perform wedding ceremonies in secret for couples who wished to be married.”
been married, and you are the most fantastic soldier I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.”
John eyes the cutlery that Sherlock has so carefully set out, the bottle of John’s favourite wine perched between their two best wine glasses, the tall red candle that flickers between the two table settings. Candles: the hallmark of a proper date, in Sherlock’s books.
“Noted,” John agrees, before gesturing towards the two envelopes that are nestled snugly between two boxes of chocolates. “What are those, then?”
John’s trembling palm skims over Sherlock’s chest, coming to rest exactly over where his heart is (
And with that, John reaches into his coat pocket and closes his fingers around the small velvet box he has been stowing there since this morning. He draws in a deep breath in an attempt to steel his nerves, the ones that had been temporarily tamped down by Sherlock’s absolutely heartbreaking show of affection.
John tucked his head beneath Sherlock’s chin, burying his face against his neck and simply breathing him in. “Well, she wasn’t wrong,” he murmured. “I suppose I am rather spoiled. Not that I’m complaining.”
John holds back a giggle at Sherlock’s naivety. “Yes, I’ve come to realize that over the years.”
John laughs out loud at this, unable to help himself, and it relieves some of the emotion that had pent up between them, allowing them to settle back into a comfort zone, of sorts.
Clearing his throat, he gestures back to the kitchen table. “You were about to tell me about all of this?” he prompts, praying that Sherlock will take the bait and shift gears. He will not allow crying this early on in the evening, he simply will not let it happen.
John is watching in horror as his best friend, the bravest and wisest man he has ever had the pleasure of knowing, stands on the edge of a rooftop several stories up. He is too far out of John’s reach to protect, too decided in his path to sway back into the realms of safety.
“I purchased three separate bouquets of flowers. I allowed myself the cliché of indulging in roses; apparently they are stereotypical to Valentine’s Day. I could not decide whether they would be cheesy or necessary, so I decided to err on the side of caution. But the lilies were quite beautiful and the daisies reminded me of your eyes somehow, though I’m still at a loss for why. There were other bouquets I had my eye on, though I deduced that the florist had wrongfully assumed I was an adulterer set on buying flowers for a multitude of partners, and so… three bouquets.”
Sherlock’s eyes open again and lock against the soldier's, searching, understanding. His fingers tighten over John’s, clasping their hands together and drawing their joined fingers down to their sides. He squeezes both of John’s hands gently, conveying more in a simple gesture than he could in a hundred thousand well-chosen words.
Sherlock clears his throat. “It’s Valentine's Day. I do hope I got it right. I haven’t any past experience on… on being someone’s Valentine.”
John’s return to Baker Street had made the nightmares slightly easier to recover from- waking up in his old bed in the flat he shared with Sherlock was really proof enough that Sherlock’s return hadn’t been in his imagination. Still, that hadn’t stopped John from creeping downstairs to verify Sherlock’s presence in 221B;  the detective would usually still be up working on some experiment or another, and would barely notice John’s relieved sigh or the weight that lifted from his shoulders the moment he laid eyes on his best friend, alive, breathing, and making a bloody mess of their shared flat. He would usually grumble some sort of half-energized response to John’s offer of tea, and continue on with his experiments as though John weren’t there.
The beginnings of a blush work onto Sherlock’s cheekbones. “Indeed,” he confirms, and while he tries to pass it off as insignificant, John knows him well enough to know that it actually means a great deal more than he would ever admit.
“I can’t believe you sometimes, you know that? Just when I think I’ve got you pegged, you well and truly outdo yourself, every single time.”
“I’ve hurt you,” Sherlock explains. “I made a decision that hurt you, and even now that I’ve returned, that decision keeps hurting you over and over and over again, and that… it’s out of my control, John.” He shakes his head, his mouth tightening bitterly. “There is nothing I can do about it, and it frustrates me to no end.”
