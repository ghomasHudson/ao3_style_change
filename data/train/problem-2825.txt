He was brought back to the present moment by Zachariah’s breath on the back of his neck. He had apparently come over to have a “chat” or rather, to point out Dean’s many mistakes in the gardening department.
Xxxxxxx
Dean was at the student bar aka “the pit”. It really was a dive, but hey it was cheap drinks and even cheaper women. Despite all this, he was pretty fucking depressed. Damn it, he was in so much debt right now. And there was that other thing that was bothering him, those blue eyes, that Cas. He was keeping him up at night. Hell, he had been woken himself up the other night, moaning and writhering over a dream about fucking this guy. His sheets a mess of sweat and stickiness. This was definitely not cool. He needed to get himself some pussy, like yesterday. But the pit was pretty dead at 3pm and besides he had some stuff to do for Bobby, so he downed the rest of his whiskey and went to find the impala (yeah drinking definitely made his driving better). He pulled up outside the house. He knew it looked a bit like a shambles, all faded blue paint and dirty windows. The wooden porch looked like it had decidedly better days and there was a rusty car on the driveway (Bobby’s pet project which had never quite got off the ground). But hell, it was home, which was damn sight more than he had had growing up. Hmmm unhappy childhood, check, daddy issues, check, god he was such a cliché. He went to open the front door, only to find it was locked. What the fuck? And oh shit, he had forgotten his keys. He banged loudly on the door. He wondered if Sam had locked the door because he had a girl in there. He had mentioned someone recently. Lucky bastard. The door opened and for a second time, Dean was greeted with an intense pair of blue eyes. In. his. doorway. What the fuck? He was almost too stunned to say anything. The man in his front door continued to stare at him, he tilted his head as if trying to solve a particularly complex puzzle (god, that was so cute, Dean noticed absent-mindedly). And oh god, what must Cas think of this shit pile?
Dean awkwardly made an attempt to initiate conversation (he had got the call yesterday, confirming his employment). Castiel just turned to look at him, doing his head-cocking thing (arrahhh, so cute). Dean rubbed the back of his neck nervously,
In the end, it had all been quite easy. Sam hadn't had access to a car (apparently Dean had taken the impala somewhere) but had lent him money for a taxi to Balthazar’s house, no problem. It all had been more difficult getting his substance needs met by Balthazar due to a severe lack of funds. But he had managed to use his father’s accident to his advantage (ok the tears were genuine, but they certainly helped to soften Balthazar up to his plight). Plus then promising he would pay interest on what he owed ultimately seemed to sway Balthazar to giving some meds up for free (
He was high, felt like he was flying; his feet weren’t on the ground. This is what life should be like. How could he have ever lived anything else? The blood pulsed around his body and he felt the sense of excitement, the endless possibilities, the euphoria. Life was so fucking beautiful. It didn’t feel like he could contain the smile on his face...Sam felt a hand on his arm, looking up he saw her, thick dark hair fringing her heart shaped face, a wide smile plastered on her face, dark eyes looking into his; Ruby. He lent in to kiss her. And then the swarming mass of dancing bodies swallowed them up, and Sam was lost in the crowd, but he didn’t care. It was so beautiful. It has been Ruby’s idea to go to “the Cage”, she liked gay clubs, no dodgy men hitting on her. And Sam had followed her in, just like he always did now. He hadn’t known her for long but had fallen hard. And when Ruby offered him a pill at a party recently, he had wondered what it would be like, to be so free. He had also wondered if it would give him the additional confidence he needed to lean in and kiss her. So he had taken it. And it had given him so much more. After that, they had been inseparable; had fucked hard and partied even harder.
. His voice came out deeper than he had expected, but it seemed to do something to Balthazar - he lent over Castiel, hands disentangled from his hair and grasping his face, pulled him into an intense kiss; his tongue plunging deeper into Castiel’s mouth. Castiel could feel the need behind it, could feel Balthazar’s hands start to reach down, exploring the rest of his body, could feel his weight shift until he was on top of him, crushing him. He wasn’t sure if this was fun anymore. He started to drift away.
Dean had been surprised with Cas’ request; to find his brother, Gabriel. He hadn’t known Cas had an older brother, much less one who was shrouded with mystery; where had he gone? Was he missing or just unwilling to come home?

Castiel made his way to his father’s hospital bed in a daze, terrified what he would find. Yet what greeted him still shook him to his core. His father looking smaller, older, weaker as he lay on that hospital bed hooked up to several, intimating looking machines. Castiel raked his hands through his unruly curls. He could barely stand it, the only person in the world who loved him, the only one left, was going to leave him. He barely contained the sob that was threatening to surface. He was so scared. His father had told him he would never survive without him. And that’s when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Of course, Dean had followed him up to his father’s room. Balthazar had made some excuse, he had a delivery to pick up (no surprise that Balthazar should be hanging around the pharmaceutical department, it was his business after all). But Dean had followed him. Castiel didn’t understand that, didn’t understand why Dean didn’t just leave him. But....maybe it kindof felt nice that he was here. He suddenly felt so terribly tired, shaky and the world seemed to spin in front of him.....the next thing he knew, he was aware of someone carrying him, a car door slamming and the gentle movement of a car. Castiel didn’t understand what was going on, but he was too tired too care any longer. He passed out again.
the response a bit louder this time.
he said before trailing his fingers along Castiel’s hardening cock; and then reaching down to pull Castiel’s balls, massaging them into his hand
). Balthazar had barely retrieved them from his special hiding place (the air vent in his room), wherein Castiel had snatched them out of his hand, crushing them under a glass of water and snorting them as soon as possible. The feeling of euphoria and gentle giddiness quickly swept over him; along with a strong need to communicate how much he loved Balthazar. Smiling, he lent over to a bemused Balthazar, lightly brushing his lips against his. He was sure that he could see a halo surrounding Balthazar.
When did it start? But hadn’t it always been that way? Hadn’t be always be owned by his father? Or rather, hadn’t he always been loved by his father?
He turned to display a particularly oily smile; one which was returned with an equal lack of sincerity. Castiel turned also, he hadn’t seen Dick Roman for a couple of months, thank god. Dick had been one of his father’s clients, who had become somewhat of a friend to Zachariah. Or rather he invited Zachariah and his friends to his elaborate parties; parties with all the boys they could want. Castiel grimaced as he remembered. But trips to Dick’s parties had stopped some time ago. Now he only saw Dick at public events, like the one that day.
Cas murmured
. His father smiled benevolently before driving his fingers deep inside him. Castiel’s screams muffled by his father’s mouth.

Dean took a swig of beer (yeah it was 2pm, but that was practically the evening, ok?), he was staring at some photos from his latest PI case. Husband X (lets call him, Gerald) entering a “certain type of establishment” (i.e. a brothel). Gerald leaving 1 hour later, smile on his face. Jees, what a sleeze! Dean had had his fair share of women, but never gone as far as paying for it (ok there was this one time, but that was completely different...). He guessed Gerald’s wife (lets call her Tamara), would be happy, this would certainly help her divorce settlement (prenup violated, so she gets half). Dean sighed, this was not the reason he had got into the private investigation business (hmmm although maybe helping rick people screw each other wasn’t that bad). Shit, he looked at the time, he was gonna be late. Taking a last swig of his beer, he grabbed his car keys (drinking made his driving better) and headed out.
Seriously, Dean didn’t know how someone as sweet as Cas could be related to such a dickwad like Zachariah. He looked over at the small party at the pool, could see that Cas was lying on the sun-lounger, it looked like he was just trying to ignore his father and his friends, despite the fact that they kept trying to drag him into conversation by making jokes about him and prodding him. Weird. He wished he could go over there and......hell he didn’t know. Cas had entirely freaked him out the other day, propositioning him and all that. It’s always the quiet ones you gotta watch. But hell, it was for the best that he had rejected him anyway, Castiel clearly wasn’t that interested. He hadn’t even looked at him once since he had got to the garden. Besides that girl Lisa from the bar the other night had called him and they were going out later. Not a date though. Hmmm he might even get lucky.
Castiel had woken the next day, sun streaming in. The hangover/come-down hitting along with the memories of last night....oh god, he had cheated on his father, he had fucked another man, just like the slut that his father always said that he was...and then he remembered Sam unconscious....and then Dean screaming at him, threatening him..... He shuddered, the look of pure fury, of hatred, in those green eyes came back to haunt him. Dean hated him then, thought he was just some dumb rich kid living off daddy. And he had so wanted Dean to like him, but of course he had fucked that up. He had realised at the time that Dean had thought he had given the drugs to Sam – why hadn’t he just told him? Why had he just frozen? So pathetic. And what the hell was Dean going to do? What if he told his father? Oh god, a knot started forming in his stomach, panic rising.
Castiel couldn’t believe that Dean was being so kind, of course he probably didn’t mean it.
Castiel had known of Balthazar most of his life, just from living in the community. There had been some sort of banking scandal. His father had been implicated in the corruption and later imprisoned. His mother had a keener business sense, and promptly divorced Balthazar’s father and remarried into old money, moving the family into the community. So everyone knew of Balthazar’s family and the scandal which held them like a dead man’s grip, refusing to let them go. But for Castiel, it wasn’t until seventh grade that he actually spoke to Balthazar. It had been after school. Balthazar had found him crying and alone in the boys bathroom, not wanting to go home. And he had offered him the only comfort he knew – marijuana. The first moment Castiel had inhaled the thick toxic smoke (after he recovered from coughing) he had felt peace wash over him. And so it began; their business arrangement. It meant he had some control over his medication, didn’t just have to rely on his father’s good will, didn’t have to beg....
Constructive comments always welcome! :)
Sam came pounding up the stairs. Dean yelled out to him
”. He looked at his head again, it looked like he was still bleeding. He started the car, it was going to be a long night.
When Dean arrived at the hospital, he was already wound up, terrified of what he would find when he arrived and very, very angry; his thoughts cascading out of control- “how the fuck had this happened to his little brother? His nerdy, sweet little brother? Who the fuck had done this to him?” - So when Cas had met him outside the hospital, expressing apologies but looking wired, manic, high, Dean had just lost it.
Castiel yelped and cowered against the wall; his mind fuzzy still from the medication and alcohol.“
Dean looked at the other man, with the same amount of contempt. Castiel ignored their posturing and composed himself
he whispered.
Silence, neither of them moved or knew where to look.
Dean called as he sped off. Sam shook his head and turned. First day back and yep, it was gonna be a great year, he could just feel it. The campus was bustling, new students (freshers) looking confused at maps of the sprawling grounds, attempting to find the correct building, others wandering around in a daze with sunglasses as black as their coffee, friends who hadn’t seen each other for several months, shouting, hugging, laughing. Girls with shiny straight hair, clutching piles of books, trying to navigate their quickest way to the library. Mobile phones going off. Some guy on a skateboard getting in everyone’s way. The smell of cigarette smoke (and maybe some other sweeter smell) drifted in the air. Sam loved it. This was exactly the life he had always wanted. He checked his classes again;
t was 9.15am and Dean was standing outside the philosophy lecture theatre. Uncomfortable. All these geeky nerds rushing around him like minnows made him itch to get the hell out. But he was waiting for Cas. Didn’t know what he was going to say. But he knew he owed him this much.
his English accent made his words sound clipped and sharp.
he trailed off as he realised Dean was not even listening, just staring morosely at the small pile of vomit on the impala floor
When Dean returned from his visit to the men’s, he found Castiel and another guy embracing and Castiel was crying. When Castiel saw Dean, he tried to form words, but he couldn’t. The other guy looked up at Dean, confused,
. And then he was pushing inside slowing, could feel the way that Castiel’s tight walls gripped him, leaning over and whispering into Castiel’s ear
It was late when they finished. Dean had offered Benny a lift, which was politely declined, and so he left the studio alone. Standing by his impala, his baby, he shivered in the cold night air. He took a swig of rum from his flask (he had been drinking discreetly all night, knowing that Benny would disapprove but hell, he was most creative after a few drinks). That’s when he heard him.

First day back at university after a long summer off, Castiel sighed, wrapping his too-large tan trench coat around his thin frame. This was what he had always wanted wasn’t it? To go to university, to learn, to get away from high school and all its narrow-mindedness, maybe even to get away from Zachariah, his father? But it hadn’t worked out that way really. He still felt like a prisoner, still was one, just without the metal bars. Maybe this was just how it was supposed to be, maybe it was just safer this way. At 21, he was still living with his father, he was paying the fees after all. His father had decided the local university would be appropriate, he had also decided that Castiel would be majoring in theology and philosophy, not art (Castiel’s secret dream).
He looked up, tried to grip the wall to help him stand up, but his father easily pushed his hands away from the wall, so that he fell onto his back, ass exposed.
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked over at the other man
Dean saw him then, saw Cas moving slowly, gracefully toward him. His breath hitched. So beautiful.
And then his father was gone, off to his room, shutting the door. Leaving him alone on the top of the stairs. But it wasn’t relief Castiel felt, it was fear. Had he done something wrong? What did his father want? What should he do next? Tension in Castiel’s body rising. He couldn’t escape it. And the walls of the house seemed to close in around him. And the familiar desire to fade away arose within him. Soundlessly he crept downstairs and started to clean. Just wanted to keep busy, just wanted to forget.
The lecture began, and Sam settled back and started taking notes.
Cas stopped abruptly, his attention caught on the papers and photographs of Gabriel strewn over Dean’s desk,
night, was doing lying on his brother’s bed. Sam shifted uncomfortably with the realisation that he had never quite got round to talking to Castiel, to thanking him, for what he had done for him, if anything he had kindof avoided him. Of course he had sent a text but the whole night, what happened, going to hospital, it was all so.....embarrassing, god he didn’t recognise himself. And despite his brother’s reservations, he was totally being super healthy now - the whole thing with Ruby, being left in the dirty bathroom to od, it had been a massive wake-up call. And yeah he had been lucky, he hadn’t gone in too far with it all. Of course Ruby had tried a couple of times to get back in touch but she had given up pretty damn easy in Sam’s opinion when he didn’t bother taking her calls. He hadn’t even seen her in class, seemed like she had just dropped out. He hadn’t been tempted once to call her, to take just one more pill.......well not really....
And Castiel had never told Gabriel that the shadow man was real. Had never told him how he had made their father touch him, kiss him, hurt him down there. He was too ashamed of his behaviour. Besides he didn’t want Gabriel to hate him; Zachariah told him that Gabriel would be jealous if he found out that he was not the favourite.
After it was decided that Castiel would stay at the Winchester-Singer residence for
” Dean trailed off as Cas lead out another sob. Without a thought, Dean stepped forward and grabbed the man in a close hug, before awkwardly stepping back
He crept into his father’s room. The curtains were drawn and the room was dark. He made his way to the bed, where his father’s form lay. He crept in beneath the covers. He knew it was going to happen anyway; he just wanted control over when. He moved close to his father, could smell his stagnant breath and sickly sweet aftershave. He leaned in and kissed him on the mouth. And in that moment, he could feel a part of himself dying. His father’s eyes fluttered open, his lips forming into a slow smile, a smirk. They kissed again, long and hard, tongues exploring. He could feel his father’s sweaty hands reaching for his body, reaching under his shirt. Reaching down, stroking him through his pants. Could hear his father’s sighs and murmurs of approval. And Castiel felt himself leaning in, kissing and sucking his father’s neck and chest. The skin wrinkled and dry. Then Castiel’s mind was taking him elsewhere. In this place, he was an angel with black wings. Previously, he had tried being an angel with white wings but it never worked. And here in his mind, he was powerful. He was wise and kind and had many human friends. But he was also absolutely ruthless in hunting down and killing evil, smiting his enemies. But the best part about being this powerful angel was that he could fly. And so while his father was holding him down and fucking him in that darken room, Castiel was flying.
Castiel’s voice panicked as he tried to slap Sam to get his attention. Sam gaggled a response, he couldn’t speak, the room was spinning, and he felt like he was being swallowed into the ground, he couldn’t fight it. Castiel tried to splash water on his face, tried to shake him again. He lent back against the wall
They arrived at the pharmacy in the hospital. Castiel passed the prescription over.
. Castiel had been close to hysterical, knowing what would happen next. His father grabbed at his flaccid, bloody cock, squeezing it and attempting to coach some interest, with little success. And with that his father had climbed on top of him and unzipped his pants. He spat on his hands and rubbed it on his cock. Castiel had known that this was all the lube he could expect his father to use. His tears had stopped and he had turned his head to look out of the window at the blue, blue sky. Just waiting for it to happen, waiting for it to be done. And then his father had been fully inside him with just one thrust. Invading him, taking him, violating him, tearing him, moaning in pleasure as he pushed further and further. And Castiel had screamed, but his voice was horse and he barely made a sound. And as his father continued to pound into him, he lay lifeless beneath him. Almost numb to the pain, his mind was elsewhere, floating. Everything was distant. When finally Zachariah had reached his orgasm and tired of him, he had dragged Castiel’s semi-conscious body to the empty cupboard in the basement, that that was used for such punishments and shoved him in.
Sam said as he got up, patting his brother on the back.
He yelled
Sam couldn’t remember hearing a name like that before.
Warnings: rape, mentions of child abuse
. He leaned in closer, the semi-hardness of his erection rubbing against Castiel.
They showered together, his father washing him, cleaning him, inspecting the damage. And he watched his father gently towel him dry before he gently touched the tattoo on the top of Castiel’s back, “Property of Zachariah Novak” written in beautiful black font. He watched his father chose his clothes for him then, fix his tie. And he looked at himself in the mirror and he wondered who is that boy? That man? starimg back at him, with the empty look in his eye. He looked away.
Warning: rape
But whilst Balthazar had helped him out, Castiel wouldn’t describe him as a friend. More a business associate. That he is, he supplied Castiel with all the additional medication (i.e. weed, vicodin, cocaine...) that he could want.
Later that day, Dean was sipping on coffee (no sugar), looking though police files of missing teens online (courtesy of a hacking programme that Sam had made a while ago). God, there were so many, but none of them were Gabriel Novak. This was getting him nowhere.
He sounded kinda desperate. Castiel got up and adjusted his clothes.
He felt Dick’s grey eyes looking him up and down barely containing his lust. He felt naked before him. He quickly averted his gaze looking down at the floor, his eyes catching on Dick’s shiny expensive shoes. His father pulled him in closer; could feel his father’s displeasure. Zachariah had never liked Dick looking at him. He had never even let Dick touch him. The only man he hadn’t. He never knew why. Dick had certainly wanted to.
It was a cold night, and not one that Castiel wanted to stay out in. But there was little choice. The rain had not yet come, but there was promise of it in the air. He was alone, beneath the one street light. If he was human, he would have shivered.
Castiel was still in “The Cage” but he could feel the high leaving now, wanted to hold onto it, but it was slipping away, like shadows in the dawn. He lent over the sink to spray cold water on his face, coming eye to eye with his reflection in the dirty mirror. He didn’t see an angel staring back at him. He quickly turned away. As he did so, he saw a large shape lent up against the wall in the corner of the bathroom. He realised he knew the shape: it was Sam! the enthusiastic puppy from his philosophy study group. He didn’t look great, was sweating profusely, his face deathly white, his head lolling at an awkward angle....shit, what had he taken? Castiel instantly fell to his knees, gripping Sam’s head,
He spat the words into Cas’ face
30 minutes later, Dean was shown the door, pretty sure that he had been able to win over Mr Novak with his ideas. Yeah Mr Novak seemed like an alright guy, well for a rich guy anyway. Although there was something.....Dean silenced his inner voice without realising. As he drove home, he found himself thinking again about the Novak family. He decided that the son, Cas, was a right douche; he couldn’t even be bothered to get off his ass to show him around....hmmm that ass. Dean silenced his thoughts, this time he was fully aware he was doing it.
he growled and went off to hide in Bobby’s office to do some important work (aka watch reruns of “Dr Sexy MD”).
And then he saw him. Standing outside the lecture hall. Hands balled into fists in his leather jacket. Jade greed eyes scanning the corridor. And terror gripped the insides of his stomach, “oh god, what if Dean is here to fight?”. The thought flashed through his mind. But Castiel knew he had to face him. Besides would he really start fighting him here in this crowded place? Feeling slightly more confident Castiel walked toward Dean.
he smiled and held out his hand. The guy looked down, before taking his hand and giving it a quick shake.
xxxxxxxx
Sam hoped he wasn’t being annoying, but hey, why not try and make a couple of new friends?
And then of course, that happened. Dean leaning over him. And he was breathing Dean in, a faint smell of leather, tinge of whiskey, oil, the outdoors, masculinity. Castiel felt terrified and excited all that same time. And then Dean pulled away, and Zachariah was standing there, with that smile, that smile that didn’t reach his eyes. And then Castiel was just terrified.
XXXXXX
They arrived at the university, Castiel unclipped the seatbelt and turned to get out. “What no kiss goodbye for your father?”the voice low, needingly, “of course”, Castiel turned to peek him on the cheek, withdrawing quickly. Zachariah smiled, leaning in, breath hot and sugary, “when you finish your classes, return home immediately, I will be back this evening”. He squeezed Castiel’s thigh, just a bit too hard, “be good”. Out of the car, Castiel realised he had been holding his breath.
He sat down on the bed next to Castiel and lightly carded his hands though Castiel’s hair. Castiel could feel the blood rushing around his body, everything was wonderful, amazing.
xxxxxxxxx
Dean had been awake all night, sitting by Sam’s bed as the machines beeped. He looked so peaceful lying there, but who knew what was going on in his body. And there was nothing Dean could do. He was so helpless. Doctor Bliss (who looked absolutely nothing like Dr Sexy) said all they could do was wait, that it was up to Sam now. And so the next day drew on and on and Sam just lay there. Dean felt himself get weaker and weaker.
he commanded. And as Castiel obediently opened his blue eyes, full attention on him, Zachariah could feel his cock harden; he owned this boy absolutely and completely.
A part of Castiel was wondering where the hell this was all coming from, he had never talked to Balthazar like this before, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself. It was fun. Watching Balthazar’s eyes light up, his smile increase. Yeah this was fun, Maybe a part of him had always known that Balthazar had, well a ‘soft spot’ for him. So he was having fun. And didn’t he deserve that?
And yet he carried on, carried on breathing, even when it seemed like this simple act was just like climbing Kilimanjaro. He carried on silent, cold and unchanged, like a statue, impervious and watching the world dance and living it’s life, knowing he wasn’t invited. He was just an observer, an outsider. And sometimes he stared at himself in the mirror, trying to see himself, trying to know who he was. But all he saw was the emptiness that lay beyond his irises. And he was numb, as cold inside as a northern winter, keeping his feelings locked away and somehow he had lost the key. But then there times, in unbidden moments, they would come back, his feelings, crushing in upon him, drowning him, holding him down. He just had to keep running....keep on breathing.....keep on running.
He trailed off as he saw the disappointment in her eyes. She knew he wouldn’t want to see her again. She wondered what she had done wrong. He left her apartment feeling jaded, tired. Knew that if he had woken up to blue eyes and not brown, he would never have left. He sighed. He really needed to book another appointment with that therapist to get rid of these wrong thoughts once and for all.
He left him there then, with only a bottle of water and a packet of crackers to sustain him, left him there in the black, coffin-like closet for the next two days. And he crouched in his own shit and piss, his muscles cramping, for the next two days. Locked there, with only his punishing thoughts, the oppressive darkness and the painful withdrawal from the medication for the next two days. And Castiel had understood the message only too well. His body was not his own. His life was not his own.
his father collapsed on top of him. He stayed inside, could feel his father’s cock softening, but still maintaining its grip. Finally, Zachariah released him, and lay panting on him, before rolling over. Castiel lay, afraid to move away, gently wiping the tears he did not know had fallen. Could feel the cum and blood dripping down his legs. He was disgusting, dirty, worthless. His father rolled back over, pulling him close, spooning. Castiel’s body complied.
Castiel trailed off and resumed his stare. Was Cas nervous? Was Cas blushing? Dean wondered. Surely not! Suddenly Dean realised he had been standing on the porch of his own house for what seemed like forever, participating in a mutual staring competition....Dean stomped into his house, pushing past Cas. Stupid Cas, with his stupid blue eyes, the last thing he needed was some stupid, jumped up rich kid student hanging around his house, he thought angrily.
Afterwards, his father had released him, cooing over him, tending his wounds, washing him, hugging him, like a strangler vine, tighter and tighter. And Castiel had been so relieved at the end of his painful isolation, so relieved that his father loved him again, that he had hugged him back, kissed him back. And then he had lain back on the bed for his father, opening his legs, whilst his father had inspected his hole further. He had clenched as his father had wormed a single digit into him;
Cas finished lamely.
He stepped out into the cool night air. Alone at last, on the street outside the gallery. He looked up at the stars.
They were sitting across from each other in a little booth, pie and coffee ordered (Castiel just ordered the coffee, the same way as Dean’s; cream, two sugars). There were a few zoned out hippie heads playing pool in the corner; the barman was idly flicking through the student paper. Basically the place was dead, it was far too early. Regardless, Dean didn’t notice the surroundings, was too absorbed in the quiet man in front of him, who kept shifting nervously in his seat. Neither of them said anything for awhile, until Dean broke the silence.
And then he heard his father’s footsteps. He could tell immediately what sort of mood he was in, panic gripped his chest in a vice;
xxxxx
Zachariah released his fingers then, sitting back and surveying Castiel’s beauty. He took in his slim body’ scarred from his previous assaults, took in the recent bruises and cuts; angry welts still visible on his cock, a patchwork of bruises on his thighs and ass. Zachariah licked his lips. “
The nurse who inspected his head was gentle, said he needed some stitches but that he would be fine. And yes, temporary memory loss was normal. And no, he didn’t need to stay in the hospital but yes, it was important that someone kept an eye on him. Dean shifted uncomfortably, not sure how he was going to explain to Mr Novak what had happened. Castiel grabbed up the prescription for painkillers enthusiastically as the nurse departed. Head injury aside, he could only imagine what his father would do to him and he knew he would need all the painkillers he could get.
. Indeed as Dean had started working for Zachariah, he had grown to increasingly dislike his new boss (and not just because he disliked being told what to do). There was just something creepy about the guy; several times he had caught him staring at him, dark eyes seizing him up, as if he was waiting to pounce. And he never knew where he was with the guy; he would be told to do something at one moment and then be criticised for doing it the next. And his criticisms would always be delivered with the same smarmy smile, his tone as sweet and light as his words cutting and dark.
His father smiled at him. His father was in a good mood. Castiel wanted to make sure he stayed that way. He would do anything to keep his father happy. He leaned in to kiss his father.
, known for drinking, smoking and
Castiel wriggled away from Balthazar, who let him get up. “
He passed out.
He walked quickly down the stairs. Truly he didn’t know whether he wanted to find his father or avoid him. Then he heard his father calling his name
Xxxxxxx
Dean hadn’t thought he had slept, not until he felt a hand on his shoulder gently shaking him. He woke with a start then, his neck aching from the painful position he had slept in (keeled over in his chair, head on Sam’s bed). Sam was pushing at him, he looked disorientated, confused;
They walked silently to the car, Castiel still trying to hold back the sobs and Dean wondering what the hell was going on. But no sooner had Dean got himself settled into the car, he found that Cas had swung from weeping damsel in distress to psycho seductress. He literally jumped on him, desperately trying to kiss him and grabbing at, and rubbing Dean’s groin, before he could be stopped. Dean was shocked but not afraid. He struggled and pushed at Cas hard, trying to get away and with one last shove, Cas’ head hit the window with a loud crack and then he was out cold.
Dean sat chewing his large ham and egg sandwich slowly, barely tasting it. The events of the night before weighing heavily on his mind, God, Cas had been so sad. God, it sucked his dad was in the hospital. And now this morning.....so sad and yet still so damn beautiful. Dean shifted uncomfortable at just how natural it was to think of Cas as beautiful.....god, no, Cas was just some stupid little druggie rich boy. Dean sighed, he was tired of this internal fight, he knew that as much as he tried to convince himself that Cas wasn’t worth his time, that feeling was there, that desire. But Cas wasn't the only concern on Dean's mind that morning, there were also all the other worries he carried daily by himself; the money he owed, the additional bills he needed to pay, the fact he still hadn’t got any closer to locating Castiel’s brother, his own freaking brother (was Sam really not taking drugs anymore? Was the health kick and extreme health eating any better?)....man, he wanted to get wasted or laid, maybe both. He couldn’t handle it. But as he sat in the kitchen, slowly chewing his sandwich, he showed no indication of any of the stress he was carrying. To a casual observer, he might have even seemed carefree.
his voice serious, with just a hint of interest. And so during the rest of the trip, Dean had continued to babble away about his PI job, pies and anything else he could think of, whilst Castiel nodded and made the occasional comment. Dean even noticed him smile once. It changed his whole face; it made him radiant.
Castiel was standing awkwardly next to his father. The sound of light chatter and laughter mingled with expensive perfume. He sipped on the champagne, the bubbles going to his head. His father absent-mindedly stroked his back, while he stood, transfixed by the enormous painting of a battle scene hung on the plain white wall. The central figure laying bloodied and dying beneath the paw of a lion, whilst all around him, angels and demons fought. Castiel shuddered and looked away. The painting was hideous and glorious all at the same time.
Dean had busied himself with sorting out the laundry and putting fresh sheets on the bed. Castiel would have preferred to have taken the floor, but Dean said he wanted it, something about the floor being good for his back. Castiel was sceptical but Dean had seemed so convincing, he had relented to taking the bed. Besides it was only “
Dean’s speech was an incoherent babble of swearwords as he tried to push Cas’ head back and stop him throwing up. He swerved to a stop at the side of the road and jumped out, Cas had managed to stop being sick and got out of the other side of the car.
, Castiel replied, dutifully. But a part of him meant it. Without his father, nothing made sense. His world was chaos. His father loved him, more than anything. How lucky he was to be so loved.
Dean scowled. Zachariah always called him that
He was still lying on the sun-lounger, when his father came and sat beside him. His father’s friends, Ralph, Urie, and Michael sat silently, watching him.
Dean’s voice had become low and threatening. Cas didn’t say anything; just kept his eyes down. Dean looked around, noting a growing crowd before releasing him “just fuck off, just get out of here”. Cas whispered
As he drove home, thoughts of how beautiful Cas was, arose uninvited, unwanted, like extra guests at a wedding. With great effort, Dean pushed those thoughts down, no, not beautiful, Cas was weird, far too serious and annoyingly quiet, probably thought he was too good to talk to Dean....but then other thoughts lay waiting, pushing forward, like eager children. Thoughts about how mysterious Cas was, a mystery that Dean found himself wanting to unravel...and thoughts about how gentle Cas appeared, almost vulnerable and with that thought, Dean felt his cock twitch. In record timing, Dean lent forward and turned on the radio, loud rock music drowning out his intrusive thoughts.
His father hadn’t risen from his room and it was growing dark outside. Castiel hoped that maybe his father would just sleep through. But then he knew even if his father did, he would just be worrying, waiting all night for his door to gently open....knew his body wouldn’t allow him sleep, would be in constant threat mode, a heightened state of panic, preparing him for the worst. He just wanted the tension to end. He just wanted it all to end. But he knew it wouldn’t. Knew that there was only one thing he could do.
Dean said under his breath, but loud enough for Castiel to hear. Dean didn’t know what to say, just suddenly had irrepressible urge to get the hell out.
It was the afternoon when Castiel heard the front door slam. He was still in the shower; still numb and peaceful from the vicodin. The terror couldn’t get to him. But part of him knew it was there waiting on the sidelines to attack, patient, like a spider. He stopped the shower immediately, even in this state, knew he had to keep it together, had to keep his father happy. He dried himself quickly, dressed quickly. Just simple black pants, a shirt; he had no preference, they were just some clothes his father liked. He walked past the long mirror in the hall, without checking his appearance. Knew what he would see there. So ugly. So broken.
.His voice low, barely audible, looking away. Castiel didn’t understand. But of course, he wasn’t good enough for someone as perfect as Dean.
Castiel felt his skin crawl; just wanted to get away, to get away from all these men that just wanted to fuck him, use him, destroy him.
Of course Cas said he would pay and even though Dean needed the money, he felt obliged to waiver the fee. After all he had said that he owed Cas a favour. One brother for another. And so he set to work, didn’t have much to go on though. A name, a date of birth, a well-worn photo of Cas’ brother at 15, just before he left. Dean wondered if this was all just a wild ghost chase. But damn it he was gonna do this for Cas, he was gonna find Gabriel.
xxxxxxx
Oh God, Dean thought, what the frack am I doing? Am I really trying to impress Cas? However, it seemed to work, Cas did indeed look suitably impressed.
Castiel inhaled sharply, hadn’t meant to sound so angry. Dean sighed “
(which was a complete lie but whatever).
. God he was so lame. Dean looked at him incredulously , earlier spat apparently forgotten
And so a week passed. There was a chill in the air but it remained unusually sunny for early November.
Castiel whispered before dissolving into giggles and lying back on the bed. Balthazar sighed
Several nights later..... Castiel was straddling him, kissing him, rutting and rubbing himself against....the other man’s cock. It was disgusting but at least this made him feel in control, not like the times when he was passive, held down and fucked. The club’s music was hard and loud in “The Cage” (the dirtiest gay club in town) and the air smelled of sex and desperation. The occupants masked their hungry eyes with feigned smiles and cocaine. He looked down at the guy he was straddling, just some random guy (maybe his name was Ty? Or Tom?) greasy black hair plastered to his sweaty, chubby face. Definitely not attractive - but Castiel was too high to care. He just needed a distraction; to feel something other than this eternal emptiness. The guy’s hands were pinching and grabbing his ass whilst Castiel arched his back, riding the guy’s cock through his pants. It was dark in this part of the club, but another guy, was sitting close by, watching them, rubbing himself with a lewd smile on his face. But Castiel didn’t care. The guy was opening Castiel’s pants now, almost withdrawing with shock when he felt the piercings on Castiel’s cock, before widely grinning;
Sam was looking around the room, almost as if he expected Castiel to jump out from his hidden place.
was shouted downstairs, by a disgruntled Dean, who defintely was not listening). Castiel was too stunned to say anything. He had thought he would probably never see Dean (aka the hottest guy ever), again. Zachariah had told him he would keep him locked in his room when Dean came around. He leant against the wall. Dean had called him Cas, almost like a nickname? Like an endearing nickname? He had never been called Cas before, he liked it. But oh god, what if his father found out he had seen Dean? Castiel balked at the idea, oh no, oh no, oh no....He felt dizzy, he began to slide down the wall, his heart racing. He found he couldn’t quite catch his breath, and the more he tried, the more he couldn’t breathe, what if he was having some sort of seizure, what if he was dying? The thoughts flashed through his mind. And he felt the panic rising up within him, could feel the adrenaline surge. And suddenly he was struggling for breath, the room spinning, he couldn’t get control....Ruby was the first to realise what was happening. She knelt beside him, getting eye-contact and gently saying his name and asking him to focus on her as she began to breathe slowly and deeply whilst counting. Gradually Castiel began to gain control. And then he felt tearful and so ashamed. So stupid, such a stupid....He could barely look at the others whilst he remained crouched against the wall.
he told himself. His father opened his bedroom door slowly, leaning in the doorway, taking Castiel in. He looked dishevelled, tired even.
a slick voice commented behind them. Zachariah’s lip curled in disgust as he recognised the voice.
Content warning: drug abuse
Dean coughed.
Castiel’s cries had become slower, quieter as he sucked in air slowly. His face was red and covered in snot. But Dean looked at him and sighed quietly, the man was still divine. Cas was pulling away slightly now, looking around at the room, taking in the mess, clothes lying on the floor, posters of half naked women, papers in a big pile in the corner, photos of Sam and Dean, several empty bottles of whiskey and rum lying on the floor and the small table by the door, the duvet on the floor....Cas realised Dean must have slept on the floor, he must have given him the bed, he immediately felt ashamed, he didn’t deserve this sort of kindness.
xxxxxxxx
Dean was met with an abrupt silience. Castiel glared at him before snapping
Cas looked down, he hadn’t eaten anything yesterday, too nervous about going out with his father. But he didn’t want anything now, didn’t deserve anything.
xxxxxxx
, his arms opening and Castiel walked up the stairs, slowly climbed into his father’s embrace. And then his father was kissing his damp hair. Smothering him. Breathing him in.
Xxxxxx
Castiel finished speaking as voice started to break, could feel the tears coming and so he looked down at his hands, digging his nails in to the soft skin on his palm. He had to keep control. Sam was still confused, it seemed like a lot had happened and how the hell had his brother, of all people got involved? But he could see the guy was struggling so he didn’t want to push him too much.
and then he undid his pants, grabbed Castiel’s hair and pushed his head now, so that Castiel was faced with his father’s semi-hard, thick, red cock. He knew what to do, had done this so many times before. And there was no question that he would do it again. He hollowed his cheeks before taking the cock into his mouth, letting his tongue glide all over it, following the vein and licking underneath, before coming to the head and playing there. Then slowly opening his mouth wider, taking his father’s cock deeper into his mouth, sucking with just the right pressure, teeth covered, then taking his father’s cock deeper into his throat, gag-reflex long gone. His father moaned above him;
xxxxxxx
Dean made a choking sound
Sorry, soooo late with this chapter, life got in the way as usual. Will be aiming to write a longer chapter next time (and soon!). Much love x
Zachariah screamed as he punched him in the ribs.
”, Dean rolled his eyes at that one). He waited at the gates for the security guard to go through all the necessary checks before letting him in. “All this place needs is metal bars”, he thought, “freaking rich people”. He drove to the house. Along with the private investigation business he had with Bobby, he had also started developing his own business: odd jobs including gardening, hmmm “landscaping”. Hell he needed the money (let’s just say, Sam’s university fees weren’t cheap, and he was already in debt up to his eyeballs, not that Sam needed to know that).
Trigger warnings: rape
When he was 21, he had decided he needed to get it out of his system. So without leaving it to chance, he had hired a professional; Jimmy, a prostitute. He had been tall, but shorter than Dean with bright blue eyes and a wicked smile. They had gone for a drink in a bar first and then gone back to a motel room in the nearby area. But Dean hadn’t gone through with it, had wanted to.....but Jimmy had drugged him and taken his money. He woke up the next day, a banging headache, no money and nothing to show for it. He decided his father was right, being gay was a bad choice.
Castiel broke the silence first.
. The gates swung open. Seriously this place was like fort norx.
This was the price of rebellion.
. Sure it was a lie, but hell, he needed to learn more about Gabriel. Maybe this Luca, his old school teacher, would be able to help.
He was screaming into Cas’ face, the vein in his neck pulsing
Dean smiled briefly at him
He wondered what it was to be normal human being. To have choices. But all his life he had been told what to do and that’s what he was used to. That’s what family was. That’s what love was.
His father drove him in, the shiny grey BMW glistening in the sun. His father’s hand on his knee, light but a reminder, a reminder of his claim. His aftershave as suffocating as his overbearing presence. Castiel stared out of the window, watching the beautiful houses, all behind their large gates, go past. No people, just beautiful buildings. They lived in “Eden”, a large gated community, (the community tagline: “heaven on earth”). In the community, his father was well-known, might be what could be considered “powerful”, working as a lawyer for a highly reputable company in the city. He knew the “right people” and had strong links with the “Christian Voice” political party and local church. Zachariah Novak was indeed well respected, or perhaps it was more of a case of, well-feared. Castiel was simply known, as the quiet obedient son. He would have possibly even been considered a catch, from a wealthy family and attractive too, with those dark curls, light skin, and crystal-blue eyes that seemed to see into the soul. But well, most girls considered him “kinda weird, or rude, or boring, or whatever”. Not that Castiel minded, he simply wasn’t interested. Anyway his father would never allow him to date, so what was the point? The other brother, no-one could remember his name (possibly Gabriel?) was not discussed in the community, at least not openly. If anyone had an opinion about his whereabouts, it was vague, maybe he gone to find himself in India or maybe he was prison for smuggling drugs, or maybe.......whatever it was, the general consensus was that this brother was simply ungrateful, doing nothing but causing pain to his poor father. He had always been trouble that one. But of course no one mentioned him. Zachariah had made it clear he was to be forgotten. And what of the boys' mother, Zachariah's wife? She had left so long ago, many couldn't remember her at all. Poor Zachariah, it was almost like he was cursed.
. And with that, Dean had got up and hugged him.
xxxxxxxx
Sam looked at him, fragmented memories coming back to him. Of Ruby pushing him to do that extra pill, because hey, one or two wasn’t going to be enough to get that high; to get that rush. And all he remembered was the feeling of power, it had been divine.
Arriving at the house, his father not yet there, Castiel made his way to the kitchen. He would need to prepare the evening meal for when Zachariah returned...and he also knew he would need to clean the house. Despite the fact that every room was pristine, sterile even, Castiel knew that his father required a heavenly standard of cleanliness, which meant that cleaning every day was a necessity.
. Zachariah smiled
After Dean had gone, Castiel crawled back up onto the bed and breathed in the pillows. They smelt of Dean. He couldn’t believe he was in Dean’s bedroom, in Dean’s bed. He momentarily wondered if Dean did anything to him while he was passed out last night. But then he knew the answer to that, Dean didn’t seem to want him in that way, even when he offered himself on a plate. God, he was desperate. Just like his father said. Castiel thought back to his father, lying on the hospital bed. He had to be ok. He just had to be. Because although his father terrified him, life without him surely terrified him even more.
xxxxx
He whispered as he quietly left Balthazar’s room.
It was an hour later, Dean was shifting through his notes in the office; going over the information (or lack of) in relation to the Gabriel search. He sighed, that high school teacher, Mr Devlin, there had just been something about him; he had been too relaxed, too charming, almost as though he was practiced in answering awkward questions about Gabriel Novak. But then, the teacher had still given them some insights into Gabriel’s life, more than Cas had been able to remember – according to Luca Devlin then, the teaching body was under the general opinion that Gabriel was a
The smell of guitar strings and nicotine clung to Dean’s fingers. It had too long since he had played. But tonight he had gone down to the studio, Benny had been insistent. He had even hired a semi-decent place out in the northern part of the city. They had ended up jamming and smoking, chatting about girls they fucked, girls they wanted to fuck and reminiscing about how they met.......It had been several years ago, in a bar on the wrong side of town. It hadn’t been an easy beginning; Dean had been wasted and looking for the oblivion that pain brought; wanting to fight and feel the familiarity of violence and the sickening crush of knuckles on his skin. His invitation was open to anyone, to the pissed off barman who was drinking half the profits, to the shady dealer sitting alone in the corner, to the group of rowdy men sore from a losing another soccer game. But it was Benny who accepted this particular invitation. The fight turned ugly pretty quickly and before long, both men were on the ground, kicking and punching, much to the delight of the braying crowd. The police were called. Of course then Dean took it upon himself to taunt the crowd and the two overweight police officers who arrived on the scene, promptly leading to his own arrest (as well as Benny’s, a fact that he still claims to be bitter about). After a night in the cells and time to sober up, they had bumped into each other the next morning, outside the jail. Dean had stuck his hand out and offered to buy Benny a drink. To this day, Dean isn’t sure why he did this. To this day, Benny doesn’t know why he agreed. But as a result, they soon became regular drinking and brawling buddies, egging each other on, encouraging each other’s demise. Sam had begged Dean to stop hanging out with Benny. But in the end, it was Benny who left. Went to rehab, sobered up, did the whole 12 step thing and cut out his old drinking buddies. Of Dean understood, but it hurt anyway. Dean didn’t have a drinking problem like Benny’s of course, he knew he didn’t need to stop, he knew he was in control. But well, with Benny gone, getting annihilated alone every night just seemed kinda desperate, reminded him too much of his old man. He didn’t stop drinking of course, just cut back. He was able to start doing regular hours at Bobby’s garage again, stopped drinking in the morning to get over the hangover from the night before, stopped hiding bottles around the house. He even went back to the boxing gym again to get his need for violence and pain sated. And gradually, they had resumed their friendship. Benny wasn’t as wild as he was but hell he still had a filthy mouth and a dark sense of humour, which got Dean every time. And so, they hung out every now and again, played guitar and talked about everything other than what mattered.
, he mumbled.
Sorry not updated for ages....usual things like being busy and a whole other load of sh*t ;)
After the lecture finished, the students were expected to meet up in their study group (groups had already been allocated with the timetable). The group was the opportunity to discuss ideas and prepare group presentations.
”, it struck a chord the first time he saw it and the second, and now seeing it again the third time, he knew he was lost. His mind on all the punishments his father would concoct. He had been running low on money and he knew the pills he had weren’t going to cover for what his father was going to do to him. He started shaking, his thoughts spiralling out of control, he couldn’t work out what he needed to do, he couldn’t move. He sank down next to the dumpster, half-sobs escaping his lips, he just needed to calm down, he just needed to work out where he was.....why the hell had he run? Why was so fucking stupid? His mind felt slow and heavy, further addled by the champagne he had forced down earlier.
Dean had still been awake when Cas had called, sure it was a Wednesday at 2am, but he had been hanging around the student bars again. Had even hit it off with a girl called Lucy, or Lisa, whatever. Then he had got the short call from Cas his voice panicked and desperate;
The ambulance sped through the town. Sam lay unconscious inside, an oxygen mask attached to his mouth and nose. Castiel sat next to him, trying to keep out of the way of the paramedic. He hadn’t known what to do but Sam had become increasingly unresponsive. So he had decided then that the only option was to call an ambulance. He used Sam’s phone, which he found in his jacket. It was too risky to use his own; Zachariah checked his phone records every month. It felt like a betrayal, he knew Sam could get into a lot of trouble, but the way he was looking, Castiel knew he was already in trouble. Sitting in the back of the ambulance, the paramedic had eyed Castiel suspiciously. He knew he looked terrible. Eyes still pinpricks; pale, sweating and still chewing the inside of his mouth. He looked down at Sam’s phone, he knew he should call Dean. But he was afraid, didn’t know how he was going to tell him. They ambulance arrived at the hospital. The paramedics rushed off with Sam. Castiel took a sharp intake of breath and then he called Dean.
. Sam was worried about Castiel. It had freaked him out, one minute this guy seemed normal (albeit as normal as this guy would ever be) and the next he was on the floor, struggling for breath like, well, like a fish when it had been pulled out of water.
and Cas blinked awake, disorientated and confused, tears still fresh on his face. But the man above him, was not his father; no this man was so beautiful he was surely an angel? That was before he spoke
, Castiel startled at the sound of the familiar voice above him. He looked up to find a concerned Dean looking down at him. He tried to hide his sniffling as he edged himself up the wall into a standing position.
He checked the time, surely it would be ok to go back now? He had been standing there for hours. He sighed. He pulled his trench coat around him, and started the walk back to the house. The wind biting and pulling him all the way.
Zachariah was above him, as Castiel was pinned to the bed on his back. Zachariah holding both his hands above him, gripped in a fist. He was thrusting into his unprepared ass, groaning. Each thrust agony as he ripped inside him, could feel the burning heat, the wrongness. Spearing pain, as he was unwillingly widened against his father’s cock. Zachariah’s sweaty body pressed against him, preventing him fully breathing, and all he wanted to do was scream
Confusion, panic, hope.
He pulled out slightly, gripping onto his son’s hips and then pushed himself further, starting to set up a rhythm. His body pressed over Castiel, his son taking all his weight. He pushed Castiel’s head into the pillow, stifling his cries and then he was digging his nails into Castiel’s back, drawing blood. And he felt himself going over the edge then, losing it, saw his boy crushed, could hear him calling his name, his muffled and strained;
The event at the art gallery was almost over, Castiel was exhausted. It would have been wonderful if he had been able to be with the paintings alone. But of course no one was interested in them. It was just an evening to network; to make money by engaging in mindless chatter, by maintaining that mask of respectability. He knocked back another glass of champagne before unsteadily making his way outside. He knew his father liked taking him out to such events, liked to show him off, always introducing him as
his father croaned over him, kissing his chest and then running his other hand over Castiel’s legs and body. He put another finger in and started scissoring
Inside was quiet, nothing like the human storm he had run from hours earlier. He peered into the darkness, not daring to turn on the light. The silence hanging, felt like it was waiting to be broken. He removed his shoes. His breath shallow as he made his way across the hall; the marble floor cold and hard against his feet. He wished he could merge into the walls, he wished he could be so small that nothing would see him. So foolish to have left, to have run, such a stupid, stupid boy.
Last night, after Cas had passed out in his father’s room, Dean knew he couldn’t leave him there. Besides that nurse had said because of potential concussion, he shouldn’t be left alone. The only thing he could do was take him back to his. But really, it wasn’t such a well-thought out decision. Dean had just acted on instinct, gathering him up bridal style and carrying him to the car. There was just something about Cas that screamed a need to be looked after, to be cared for. And that’s all Dean ever wanted to do.
Hmmm, not sure what I think about this chapter...we'll see what happens...
After the conversation about Gabriel, Castiel had wanted to leave, had been insistent that he should go back to his house. Privately, he feared being alone in that big house of his father’s. Besides he wasn’t even sure he would be able to get in; his father changed the key codes regularly, and he wasn’t sure if Zachariah had changed them again without telling him. But he couldn’t tell Dean that – it might seem.....weird. But then Dean had offered for him to stay
Dean interrupted “
Dean was angry, terrified, who the hell was this man? How the hell could this have happened, what Sam was gay? And he was on drugs??
Zachariah had kicked him hard
And then Gabriel was gone.
Of course Zachariah hadn’t allowed that to continue.
Dean growled. He really hadn’t meant to sound so harsh, but his baby was hurt, ruined, and the man responsible was just stood there, looking so vulnerable, so adorable. And that really pissed Dean off.
And so the conversation went and before he knew it, Castiel realised that he was enjoying himself. He laughed at Dean’s dumb jokes and impressions of ‘bitchy’ Sam. He even started asking questions about Dean and Bobby’s PI business.
xxxxxxxx
Sam trailed off, fully comprehending her abandonment of him. Dean looked at him strangely
And so things continued as they always had been.
But if Dean was flustered, the man before him didn’t seem to notice. Dean realised he was slightly swaying, hmm was he drunk?! Dean gave a slight cough,
Dean edged himself slowly out of the bed. He was half way though dressing when he heard her mumble his name;
Castiel went back to the study group. Sam, Ruby and Jess sat in various positions in the Singer-Winchester front room. Notes and books scatted about along with a large pot of (now cold) coffee and biscuits (and oh yeah some beers, definitely necessary when doing work about whether God exists or not). Sam looked up as Castiel came back into the room,
He could see feel the rush inside him. But it wasn’t enough, there was something else there too – it was dread. Balthazar sighed,
Dean was getting impatient.
, but said it with such a mocking tone, he might as well have been calling him
frozen to the spot, he couldn’t move.
And he was pushing into him more forcefully again and again, fucking him into the mattress, their bodies slapping together, the bed’s headboard violently hitting the wall. And he could feel the tsunami-like build up inside him and then he was cumming, violent hot spurts inside his son. And then he was kissing his son’s shoulders, his back, turning him over, his lips, his chest, saying over and over
Dean left him, broken, crumpled against the wall, before taking a deep breath and heading inside the hospital.
, whispered into his ear. Grinding into him, as he was bent in half, no freedom to move.
Dean was relieved
XXXXX
He pushed at Dick again, who was momentarily taken off guard by Castiel’s outburst. And then Castiel took off, running as fast as he could, away from Dick, away from his father, away from them all.
Cas opened his eyes slowly and was immediately aware of the throbbing, pulsing pain in his head, and then that the world was moving too fast. He immediately felt a wave of nausea, Before he knew what he was doing or where he was, he was lending over himself and retching onto the floor. A car floor, or more specifically, the floor of Dean’s impala. Oh fuck.  Before Dean was aware that Cas was even awake, he heard the retching sound,
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
And as he walked away, all grace and elegance, Dean watched him go. What the hell had he happened? He must have been possessed. Yeah that must have been it.
, his hand trailing up Castiel’s body, over his hips, stomach, coming to his nipples, pinching them hard so that they raised to attention. He moved his hand further up, coming to rest on Castiel’s neck, imposing a slight pressure, pushing on Castiel’s Adam’s apple, pushing harder again, so breathing was slightly more laboured. Zachariah kissed him lightly. He looked at Castiel, his hand still on his throat;
. He didn’t see his son’s tears, the emptiness in his eyes, or if he did, he didn’t care.
I am English so have no idea of how the American College/university system works...but hey you get the idea....
But someone had saved him.
His father had pulled him into the house, into the bedroom, barely able to control his rage;
At this question, Cas looked down and speaking in his unusually deep voice, he proceeded to tell Dean what happened. And when he finished, Dean smiled at him
Balthazar gave out a little chuckle
and before Castiel could say anything, Sam was bellowing up the stairs
Sam was alive! And all Dean could feel looking at his brother was awesome relief, his whole body tingling with the absolute relief. He wouldn’t be alone. Sam hadn’t died! And he bent over and tightly hugged his confused and bleary-eyed brother. And then leaning back, letting Sam take a breath, and looking at his wonderful, amazing brother...hmmm no! his stupid, dumbass brother, what the hell was he doing taking drugs with that loser Cas? Relief quickly morphed into anger.
He was doing his best to sound in control, like it was perfectly normal to wake up in some random guy’s house. He just wanted to be home. Just wanted to see his father. But then, he also didn’t want his father to hurt him, to fuck him. He just wanted everything to be ok. And then he just started to cry. Loud and messy, this was not sexy crying, this was just a man, completely alone, letting out deep and painful guttural moans as he recalled his nightmare, the night before and the reality of his pathetic and sad little life. Dean could see that Cas was just about turning into a hot mess on his bedroom floor. So he did all he knew how, got down on the floor and encircled the man a tight hug and rocked him back and forth. Hell, it had always worked when Sam had fallen over or whatever.
xxxxx
Cas sat up suddenly, regretting the decision immediately, it felt like someone had taken an ice-pick to his brain. He fell off the bed, clutching his head. Dean gave a short laugh
, Castiel begged as he tried to defend himself against the onslaught of kicks and punches. But his father hadn’t been appeased. He punched him in the face and Castiel was on the floor, Zachariah continued hitting him, punching his face over and over. His face red, eyes bulging. He suddenly stopped, breathing heavily before spitting on Castiel’s face. He got up then, but Castiel knew it wasn’t over. He was right. When Zachariah returned, he had brought his toys. He ripped off Castiel’s clothes. He tied his hands with rope. Castiel cried out as it burnt and cut into his fragile wrists. Zachariah had used his favourite toy then, his whip, cruelly slicing into Castiel’s thin body without mercy. Not even his cock was spared the assault. He had screamed whilst his father had paid particular attention to whipping his member into a bloody mess, before kicking his most sensitive area over and over. The white searing pain taking over Castiel, blinding him and then he could scream no more.
Great! He grabbed a fresh juice at the student cafe, before making his way to the lecture hall. He had already been at the university for two years, so yeah, he knew his way around. As he arrived, there was already a buzz of students, chatting about the summer activities, the upcoming semester, what classes were available. The usual. He slipped into a seat near the back, he liked to remain unobtrusive (well as unobtrusive as a 6ft 4in guy could be). He noticed the guy next to him tensed. Sam almost thought he was going to get up and leave, except for the fact that Sam was sitting at the end of the row, blocking the exit.
Dean was getting irritated.
Zachariah leant down to kiss him, his fingers resuming their attack inside him. He pulled them out again, fingering Castiel’s stretched rim;
A week had passed since his father’s punishment. It had been....unpleasant. His father had seen Dean leaning over Castiel and fixated on the idea that Castiel had been trying to seduce Dean, just like he had seduced Zachariah all those years ago. What had followed was not something Castiel wanted to remember. Unfortunately, the marks and bruises on his back, thighs and abdomen along with the shooting pain in his body at the slightest movement acted as a jarring reminder.
After Dean arrived from dropping Castiel off that day, he headed to the shower. He felt sweaty, on edge; needed the cool water to refresh him. Standing under the spray, he thought again of Cas....imagined telling Cas what a rich-ass loser he was, that there was no way in hell that he would want him....imagined Cas’ crushed face, imagined him crying....and then he was wiping away those tears, hugging him, lightly kissing those full lips, touching him everywhere, exploring with his hands and mouth.....Dean felt the blood rushing to cock and reaching down, grasping his hard flesh in a fist, feeling his arousal. He groaned at the pleasure of his touch combined with his thoughts of Cas underneath him, begging for it.....moving his hand faster in a firm rhythm, his breathing erratic as he imagined himself thrusting into Cas’ tight ass; and then saw Cas moving above him, riding his cock,.....oh god, it was ecstasy...could feel the painful tension within him and he was riding the waves. He came in his hand then, shouting Cas’ name as the water poured over him...... the pleasure dissipating before the guilt and disgust edged in......but the image of Castiel straddling him, kissing him, rutting and rubbing himself remained imprinted in his mind....Dean needed a drink., needed several drinks. In the morning, Sam found him passed out in the front room.
