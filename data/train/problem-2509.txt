“No disrespect to your mama,” Cas says, “but that's an easy thing to say to a child, a dream we tell them so they never think that the world is closed off to them.”
Everything glows as he opens his eyes once Cas slows his thrusts and his eyes finally stop rolling with the delirious pleasure that courses through him.
He’s dead still in the center of the room, his head cast to the floor, breathing more fully for the first time in days and each one burns like how it does after you inhale water. It’s like he’s been drowning for three days and only now has his head broken the surface.
“I’m going to have my son join you, Ms. Mills, he was part of the training as well and knows each step the boy took in training so you can get a broader view of his skill.” Charles leaves without much more in the way of conversation and Dean starts to explain to Jody what the training had been like.
Now back in the house, the anxious feeling stays deep in his centre, even though there's nothing to be done for any of it now.
He had begun to relax, not calm down per se but his muscles started to untense and his jaw had finally released when an evil lightbulb went off in his head.
Though, hadn’t Cas said often enough how little he wants that life for himself? Or was Dean conflating his words to better fit what he had wanted to hear from the man instead?
“Well I ain't ever had a ma tellin’ me to find ‘a nice girl and settle down’ but I can’t think it’s too much fun if you don’t want that life,” he says to keep from looking too far into what that face could mean.
It takes Dean only a second longer to come back from the haze that must have hit him after he came. When he does, he reaches out and grasps Castiel by the neck, pulling him in for a starving kiss, bruising in its force and beyond incredible. He can’t help it when his hips rock forwards against Dean’s strong thigh, nor can he stop the small sound of relief as his aching cock gets even the slightest bit of attention.
Accompanying him had turned out to be a grave mistake as Dean quickly found the work to be more laborious than he first had thought. Castiel sat stunned as Dean had spared him a glance before gripping the hem of his shirt and hesitantly lifting it over his head. He’d watched helplessly as Dean tossed his shirt onto Remy’s saddle and promptly returned to work. His breath had lodged itself thick in his throat as he had taken in the man in front of him, the power he held in his back, the way his muscles rolled around each other as he lifted his arm again and again over his head, the glint as the sun's reach shifted over the scars that adorned his skin, a sight he’d yet to ever see in such length. The scars didn't detract from him at all, if anything Castiel had thought that it spoke to Dean’s character and strength, building him up instead of tearing him down as the man seemed to think.
Michael and Lucifer are having a goddamn sibling squabble in the library when they get back with Jack just stuck in the midst of it. Which is annoying, to say the least. These are some of the oldest beings in existence and they are bickering like preteens.
“Can I come by tonight with your supper?” he asks, hoping beyond anything that this wasn’t a one time thing or that Dean doesn’t think it a mistake.
“Well Ma’s right,” he lies. “Soon enough I’ll have to start my life away from the farm.” That's not so much of a lie anymore. “With me gone and Balthazar only eleven, who’s going to keep up the work on the farm?”
He runs his hand over the mess of hair on top of Cas' head, remembering how desperately he had wanted to the first time he saw him. Every part of Cas he had discovered has far exceeded his expectations in the most damaging ways. He could get lost in the softness of the strands passing over the worn pads of his fingers, sliding over the raised scars that litter both the back and palms of his hands. Dean would happily fall into the blue of his eyes and allow it to swallow him whole just for a chance of the encapsulating stare to be set on him again and again.
A part of his mind laughs at its own reasoning. His mild outrage at the course Cas’ life had taken and how he was forced into, and then allowed to continue, helping his siblings. Dean never got that choice, and yet when it came to him, he never stopped to be upset about the fact that from younger than he can remember he was face to face with some of the mild horrors of the world. A busted brow, or a knife cut on the back of a shoulder, an infection or a bone needing to be reset, instead of scraped knees and bruises that most childhoods are filled with, his never got to be.
These are the last moments that he’ll sit in the schoolroom, a place that has for so long been a safe haven and a haunted landscape. Where he learned and taught and screamed and played. Where Balthazar read his first book tucked in against Castiel's arm. Where Gadreel stays alive in the art still tacked to the wall.
“I find it reasonable to assume that you already know, Dean. Now if you’ll excuse me, I must go tell my brother that he shouldn't be so flippant with matters such as these. I do hope you will allow me the decency of keeping my reputation intact.” His voice and words sound so unlike himself, or rather so unlike the self he gets to be when he’s with Dean. Now it's perfunctory, emotionless and so proper that it sounds foreign even to his own ears. He turns to leave quickly when a hand grips tightly on his upper left arm.
“Castiel, mmh please Casti—” his pleas die half-formed as Cas’ hand shoots up and wraps around his throat applying just enough pressure to be a clear warning. His fingers flex, pressing harder into his skin, causing his breathing to shallow and his eyes roll back at the fuzzy sparks that light up along his body. A moan makes its way from his body and a spurt of precome rolls down the underside of his cock as Cas’ fingers hold steady against the vulnerable skin of his neck.
He squirms out of Cas’ grip to turn out the sconce before tucking himself back into the warm cocoon of the bed. Cas’ steady breathing joins into the symphony of the pitch-black night, a soothing rhythm that he matches in no time.
“Always, I’m glad you could make it,” Castiel says as they pull apart and Gabriel makes a scoff of playful indignancy.
He looks over and sees his slate. Mostly erased etchings of his name written out again and again in practice. He had wanted to ask Cas to help him create a signature, but he supposes now that he’ll just write it out normally on his contract because it is the only way he knows how to do so.
Jack squirms in his seat and a tense look passes over his face, “What made him happy Dean?” he asks quietly.
“I can't think it would do you harm,” she pauses. “This cut doesn't go incredibly deep, half an inch at the worst of it, I don't think you’ll need stitches which is good as doing so—well it isn't something I would go for, but I will wrap it with gauze to seal the wound as best as possible. They’ll be a scar, there's no avoiding that and I suspect one on your raw shoulder as well.” Dean nods, he’d expected as much, what's a few more scars to his collection especially if they’ve got a shareable story behind them.
“You’ve done an incredible job with him Dean,” Cas says as Dean stands again, catching his eyes. Dean can see the sincerity in his face.
Ringer is fully done up a short while before Cas is making his way from the house. The heaviness in his shoulders is enough to tell Dean that he needs to ask Cas if he’s sure about this. His body is further weighed down by the cases in his arms. They are both far larger than Dean’s meager pack, he can’t begin to guess what Cas has stored in them. He has a blanket tucked under one of his arms, its bulk making it harder for him to carry what he has.
He chooses not to correct Charles about his assumptions on his length of stay, if it comes to it, he’ll just slip out during the night leaving them none the wiser.
He’s careful not to let any of his tears stain the pages of his letters as he lets himself stew in his anger. He knows it helps no one to wallow, but it’s cathartic to feel properly when he so often chooses to bury what bothers him.
“No, my father only referred to me as ‘boy’ but I know that's not a name,” he pauses and eats more waiting on Cas’ response before he shares more, but he says nothing, he simply waits for him to finish with the bite and so he continues. “I named Sammy when I was a kid to get him in the schoolhouses. But when we lost my mama the fire took the house with her and our records were lost so I never had a name that I can recall.”
Both of them had been panting, the action drawing their chests closer together. His eyes flicked down against his will to Cas’ lips and he snapped them up just as quickly, only to see Cas mirroring him. Time seemed as though it was suspended, the two of them crowded into each other's space for far longer than what was deemed acceptable.
“Castiel, I heard from Mrs. Baker that Ms. April is still single. Now such a nice girl like her should be done looking for someone by now, wouldn’t you say?” Despite the question, she doesn't give time for an answer, “I was thinking that, if your father allowed it and didn’t need you for chores and the like, of course, that on Sunday you’d come with me to church and the two of you could speak, Oh I hear she’s a lovely girl, would make such a good wife don’t you think? If the courtship starts soon, we could have a wedding within a year!”
That is until his caretaker instincts kick in and he rushes to help her. And what does he get for it? A bloody nose, or at least it smells like blood as he breathes through the flash of pain.
Dean reaches out and grabs Cas’ hand in his, the warm rough palm holds his own as though they both know they are holding something precious, something to be cherished. His cheeks flush at the thought and a warmth opens in his chest.
“You look a vision with my cock in your mouth Cas,” Dean grinds out, his face scrunched in his pleasure. His breaths have been reduced solely to small huffs, cut off and pushed from his lungs with every half aborted thrust into Castiel's mouth.
With nothing else to do Dean scoops Cas into his arms and carries him to the carriage. He packs everything up again, stuffing clothes under Cas head and upper back to make him comfortable and to keep his shoulder elevated. He drapes a shirt best he can over Cas’ torso.
Cas had grown happier with his sister home, Dean suspected that with the family's history, a sick child was bound to be tough on him no matter the fact that it wasn't his fault, that neither of them was his fault.
“My father began to catch on to whatever it was we were doing, being friends of some kind, but I could tell he was keen on going after you for it, perhaps it’s his bias towards me, perhaps it’s not. I truly don’t know my pa well enough to tell you one way or the other. Dean, I had to lie for both our sakes, do you think that if I was truly being friends with you out of pity that I would have continued pressing so hard after those first days, and then again a week ago when you shut me out? I was trying to be your friend because I enjoy your company. Far more than I have just about anyone else in my life, and certainly more than I have any stranger I’ve met.”
“I wouldn’t be where I am now without Gabriel. Even if he thinks he didn't do a good enough job, he still did it,
Reading it quickly, he ensures that what Dean is signing into is something that the man would want. Good pay, a damn good position within their farm, even the colloquial fine print hides nothing sinister.
Not even the softness of the mattress and pillow stop him from sleeping soundly again, and as he drifts off, he thinks that maybe the comfort isn't so bad after all.
Even through his nerves, his smile shows, “He did, he’s starting in just about a month in the younger room, he keeps saying that he wants to move up to the older room but that he needs to get comfortable before he tries it.” Cas had been in intense discussions with an administrator at the school in town, and after proving himself far more competent than their other prospective teachers he was offered the job, which he—with just the right amount of wait so as to not seem overzealous—accepted.
Sam spends a bit asking for clarification on which of Cas’ siblings are which, and honestly, Dean can’t blame him, with thirteen siblings it’s not easy keeping them straight in your head.
Cas didn’t know how to change what music played at first, so he pressed buttons until something happened and took note of the outcomes.
and he takes off like a shot, running up the stairs two at a time because he’s back. He's on the other side of the door and he’s alive, by some miracle. Cas came
Dean can tell that Cas wants to ask about the scars, he can tell that as much as he wants to, he equally doesn't, both because he knows it to be crass to do as such, and because he might not want to know the stories they carry.
Dean wanted so badly to believe his other self, because it all made sense, the logic tracked, it was so plausible that it clawed at his chest with the picture of its perfection. Cas loving him back, not as a game for Chuck but because that's just how it is across all Deans and Cas’ in all the world's Chuck made.
In the year that they’d been here, Gabriel had taken it upon himself to ensure that Cas and his siblings got a chance to see each other still, always bringing a couple along with him when he had cause to make his way out to them. The look of joy on Cas’ face when he gets to see his siblings is enough to light up the earth.
He tries not to think about how none of them know that these are the last moments they’ll have with him. How none of them know to pay extra attention or remember the moments they currently live. To them they’ll never not have this, the promise of a tomorrow with their brother is one they count on without even thinking about it. Of course, no tomorrow is promised.
Both Benny and Jo make an appearance, the former to ask about his work and see if he wants something from the kitchen—a play to see if Dean’s in need of a distraction to switch the subject—the latter to see if a rescue is needed from her step-father.
His double gave him a look that clear as day said I’m not buying that. “C’mon Dean I’m you, we experienced the same things, I know what you feel, how you feel. If there's anyone you can talk to about this it's yourself isn't it?”
“Good morning Sir.” He nods at Cas, unsure if he is to address him the same way given his apparent dislike for the honorific.
Dean looks up to see Cas nod, the inside of his lower lips is pulled between his teeth and he worries it as he mirrors Dean’s position on Ringers' left side.
The fire stokes, stretches higher and higher. It licks from the base of his spine to his skull; it quiets everything that doesn't add to its raging. The coil in his groin tightens, with every move they make it comes closer to snapping, and yet somehow Cas keeps him right on the edge so it curls impossibly tighter still.
The man pauses at the still-open door to the barn and knocks against the wood as though he thought he might be indisposed. Just as he begins to say, “Come in?” the man rounds the door and he finds himself stock-still at the sight of him.
It’s endearing to see Cas a bit nervous. The flush that stains his cheekbones runs down his neck. The quick flitting of his eyes as he looks from one of Dean’s to the other. It betrays the steadiness of his voice, the sure movement as he flicks the tin onto the bed.
The gnawing follows him through their morning, both taking care to clean properly, helping Cas when needed. It stops him from eating as he should but there's nothing to be done for that until he knows one way or the other what Jody is going to do. He fiddles with his long sleeves constantly, enough so that Cas takes his hand on more than one occasion to give it a reassuring squeeze.
“Hey there boy,” he greets gently. “We’ve got ourselves a big day today, so I need you to keep your attitude in check, no fighting with me or any of that, I know you ain’t too fond of riding just yet but they might not even want you for that so you don’t have to worry about that now.”
“Okay Cas first things first, some basic information about pistols and guns in general. You’ve got six bullets in the cylinder, each time you pull the hammer another locks into place to be fired. The kickback is enough to jolt me so it’ll send you spinning.” Cas sends him a withering look at the blatant over exaggeration but doesn't interrupt.
“I don’t give a damn Castiel, you have a responsibility here! Your sister has been picking up the slack for far longer than she should have to, as have I mind you, simply because you want to make sure that an imbecile who went against orders and got himself hurt doesn't do it again? He’s dafter than even I had thought, and I never had much hope for him to begin with.”
“Sam hello, sorry about that, Pamela spotted me on my way over and was desperate to tell me that I would be fantastic in my new job,” Cas pauses with a small laugh. “I don't know why but whenever that woman promises anything, I can’t help but believe it.”
Winchester is looking out onto the fields; the breeze plays with his hair as it curls slightly around the shell of his ear. He fists his hands to stop himself from reaching out to smooth the hair, to tuck it against the soft skin. His hand clenches around the chalk and for the first time since sitting down, he remembers that he is supposed to be teaching and not simply spending time with Winchester.
He knows he looks a sight, his cheeks are flushed, he can feel that much, and his eyes are likely to be flashing between the emotions that still riot in his mind and his chest feels set to burst and cracked open all the same, but he can't find it in him to care because for the first time he can remember he has a
He doesn't know when, but eventually sleep clouds his mind and pulls him into its grips, however fitful, it’s still preferred over being awake. By the time the roosters are crowing as the sun barely scratches its place along the horizon, his body feels only minorly better, still weighed down by lack of sleep and his own guilt.
The stitches had been removed after about two weeks, something he was tremendously thankful for. The fabric of his pant leg would catch on the ends of the threads and tug at the skin with every movement and he’d grown quite tired of it, and the mild pain that accompanied it. It was an annoyance more than it was actually painful but the feeling was altogether unpleasant and not having to deal with it was a blessing.
He nods his assent before walking up to Remy. As he walks her to the barn he hears Cas and his father talking in snippets. From what he can gather the girl is sick, call for a priest before the week is out sick.
“I suppose I hurt it, but honestly you don't need to worry about it at all, it won't impact my work.” As if to prove it, Ibby doesn't fight him as he changes things up, trying to get him used to the spontaneity of a working day. A proud smile overtakes his features, pleased at his work paying off.
Cas is up and extinguishing lights around the room when he makes his way back. Dean stares freely at Cas’ still naked form as he leans against the doorframe. When he’s caught, Cas offers a smile and a lewd look at his own body in return.
By some miracle he’s happy; free of fear and the stress of having everything be on him, be his to deal with.
The rest of his siblings arrive and file through the door, all except for Lucifer, but no one’s truly that shocked about that. He’d had little contact with the family and Castiel isn’t sure if his brother even knew that the family was gathering.
“Hmm yes, that would suffice,” the nasally man drawls. The hairs all along his arms prick up with the words.
He’s so lost in his own head that he carries through the rest of the conversation on reflex, he thinks his father mentions his brothers after moving from the topic of Dean, but he can't be sure.
One week on the Novak’s farm turned to two, which turned to three almost as quickly, but that wasn’t to say that a lot hadn’t happened or that the farm was at all calm. Dean’s shoulder had healed quite well, though it clicked sometimes as the temperature changed throughout the day, especially as night approached.
“I’ve got a husband and eight sons only three of which are younger than Castiel, while I appreciate the warning it’s not necessary.”
Cas pistons his hips laying deep hard thrusts into him spurred on by his pleasure addled response and then switches to grinding them in a circle when he’s balls deep. Dean can’t catch his breath, every moment he thinks he might be able to, it gets knocked from his chest again as Cas worships his body, his free hand roams as best it can, pinching his nipple, rubbing down the length of his bent thigh, coming to rest high on his throat applying the most delicious pressure to the vulnerable skin.
There’s a risk people can’t help but focus on, fears about what he’s done and who he’s made bad with before, it’s cost him jobs before, but showing up to new places usually lends itself to being a clean break for him in the past.
“I know it's logical that they would but there are times when one of the younger ones will come to me for help instead of either of my parents and there's always this part of me that thinks that I’m needed more than a typical older brother is needed.”
The morning of the sale breaks calmly, the rising sun pays no mind to the frayed nerves of the farm's occupants. It seems that even the children are aware of today's importance, the house stands quiet where it normally would bolster the noise of the young ones, excited to begin another day.
“If that's what you'd like, then yes I think talking is a good idea.” Cas stepped closer and Dean had to stop himself from falling into his orbit as he so often did.
He looks up as the mumbling stops and sees Cas’ eyes slip closed, abandoning his shoulder he starts to panic for real.
He elects again not to mention that he doesn't expect his stay at the farm to last much longer at all. He had decided that a week on the farm was respectable, both in terms of labor work and the risks of staying in one place for too long when he had no way of knowing if the debt collectors were trying to scent out his trail to come knocking. But the longer he spends on the farm—the longer he spends with Cas—the longer he wants to stay. Not to mention that he would feel mighty wrong leaving on such terms as these, with Charles taking care of his daughter and leaving his eldest son to take the reins of the farm in his absence, his help seems to have come at just the right time.
Cock the gun, balance the weight, shift for the best sightline, hover over the trigger, pull. Once, twice, three times. The bullets sink into a trunk yards off from the one they’d been using. He used the three bullets left but he learned to always check and make sure that you had a proper count of your bullets so he checks the gun, an empty wheel, six spots waiting for metal and lead to take residence for a short time.
“Good evening Sir,” he says as he approaches the two men. With a quick look into the cab, he sees that the young girl isn’t there and a small pit forms in his stomach as to what that precisely could mean. “If you’d like I can take Remy here back to the barn and work her through, get her settled for the night.”
“I made sure that Cas wasn’t in the empty before we closed it down. It can't come for him anymore Dean, he’s free of his deal.” Jack finished with a huge smile. He flinched slightly as Dean surged up and gathered him in the tightest hug he could manage.
“I’d love to go to the stables with you, if only to inform you of what care Ringer will likely need but unfortunately, we are a bit held up here. I hope to be by some time later today to see everything firsthand,” Dean tells him. Kevin nods and moves up to Ringer's shoulder, talking to him in a low voice.
“He should be ya, he was just going to the post office.” Dean tries to quell the nerves that pick up. Cas is fully capable of taking care of himself but he hates it when there’s any chance that he’s not okay.
“Jody is back tomorrow, are you—do you have your answer for her yet?” Cas asks after several moments of silence; a lull having found its home in their conversation.
Dean doesn't want to leave, he wants to stay here with Cas, as foolish as it sounds and damaging or disastrous as it could be, some force within him begs to stay with Cas as long as the man lets him. A force that has won out more often than not in the weeks that he’s been conflicted with it.
“But if she says yes, we’ll need to save for the wedding, and that means that I’ll have to work longer hours at the courthouse and we definitely couldn’t go on this trip but I don’t want to tip her off to it too much. I mean of course, we’ve talked about it but still, I’d like it to be as much of a surprise as it can be and if I have to say no to the trip she’s going to question it and I can’t lie to her, even keeping this from her is hard enough and I just—I don’t know what to do Dean,” Sam says quick enough to have Dean searching for air.
“You are several inches shorter than I am Gabriel, in fact, I’m almost sure that you are several inches shorter than Alfie. Wouldn't you agree buddy, aren't you bigger than this shortie?”
Between one second and the next Dean falls forward, effectively throwing himself at Cas. Ever cautious of his injured left shoulder, Dean buries his face into the right side of Cas’ neck, his arms snake around his torso and squeeze so tightly he thinks it might hurt Cas. But Cas makes no complaints.
She raises her arm in acquiescence and shouts across the field, “Yes dear!” she turns around again, her shoulders shaking lightly with a laugh. Jody has a wide smile on her face as well, the kind that comes from someone she loves deeply doing something she finds endearing.
He hears the door this time and blinks the tears he hadn’t known had started collecting in his eyes away before Cas can get concerned.
He isn’t going to call attention to himself though, content to listen and learn what he can from it. If anyone in the room was to voice their wish for him to be absent, especially Kali, he would leave without issue but no one raises a point of it.
He wasn't too proud to say that those words set off alarm bells in his head, ‘we need to talk’ is never a phrase you want to hear from the person your - dating? Involved with? Ridiculously in love with and have been for ten years?
“I can ask my pa if I can help you today, that way you aren't overexerting yourself at all, especially with your lack of sleep” Castiel offers hopefully.
In regards to the lore surrounding Nick's resurrection of Lucifer from the empty in season 14 I did the best I could to work the stuff we know into this chapter bridging the gaps when needed to make both scenes make as much sense as possible. I hope it's not confusing to anyone (feel free to ask questions—on anything—if you have them, I've never tried to make up lore before).
Cas is silent, lost further in thought than Dean had been only moments ago. Eventually, he breaks himself out of it and looks back at Dean, who had been stealing glances at Cas all the while.
The bag jangles as he lifts it. Why couldn't he have left it where it sat. Dean watches as the men's eyes light up and immediately, he knows this is going to go south.
Each step towards their room has more of the tension seeping from his body. His feet become heavy as the toll of the last few days catches up to him. His breath comes in short, his throat threatening to close itself under the weight that's crashing down on him. His eyes are burning by the time they make it to their room.
Cas looks up and catches Dean watching him. He isn’t able to look away fast enough, too caught up in the man to notice that he was turning his head, and before he can start to try to cover what he had just been doing, Cas’ previous frown turns itself into a little smile. The feature reaches his eyes and it steadies something within Dean’s chest.
Sam tells him to put his hands behind his back and he wraps a brush stock around his wrists and tells him that he can't break them no matter what, with a wide grin Sam tells him that he can make things come true with him trapped like this, and being the good big brother that he was he plays along, arguing that Sam can’t make him do anything but lets the trick go on. Sam looks him dead in the eye and asks, “Your nose is itchy isn’t it?” and just like that an annoyingly apparent itch spreads across his nose and down the curve of his nostrils and his eyes begin to water from the feeling. He wiggles his nose back and forth trying in vain to scratch it somehow.
Jack walks into the war room one morning, looking confused and cautiously says that something living is on earth aside from them. Dean’s chest clenches with hope and apprehension, and before they have even stopped to think this through, stopped to think how poorly this could go, they leave the bunker.
It doesn't help the matter that as the day goes on, Gabriel’s look turns into a smile that Castiel would quite like to wipe off his face. He doesn’t know why it's there and he doesn’t think he wants to know.
“Ma’am I would just like to apologize again for you having to do this and to thank you for helping me as you just have. You didn't need to, it was my own fault for hurting myself and I just wanted to say that this was all mighty kind of you,” Dean says quickly.
Before he can get his arms up to fight another blow lands squarely on his face. He feels his nose crunch, breaking apart, against the strike, the sound of it replays in his head as blood streams from it. His eyes well so much and so quickly that he can do nothing to stop the third punch as it lands on his jaw.
A smug smirk finds its way onto his face, what had at one point been an interesting coincidence just became the ticket to getting what he needs.
“I completely understand if you want to tell me to piss off after this,” Cas begins, his nerves kick up again, unsure of where Cas is planning to go with this train of thought. “But I’ve been thinking more about how you don’t yet have a name. How you said that it needed to mean something.”
“I’m finding it hard to understand why I’m being asked to explain myself to my child,” he says with barely restrained anger. “When did you learn such disrespect?” his father asks rhetorically.
It shouldn't surprise him really, and maybe it doesn’t, he certainly doesn’t feel shocked. It hurts and he knows it shouldn’t — because what is he to Cas honestly? Dean didn't want to do Cas the dishonour of believing that he was simply the closest warm willing body, but now he couldn’t be sure of anything else.
“Shit, uh ya, it’s my pistol…” Dean doesn’t exactly know what else to say, most people either piss themselves at the sight of a gun or they pay it no mind and he’s not sure which route Cas will take. To save Cas from possibly freaking out too much Dean starts to reassemble the gun.
This poem doesn't have an easy chapter assignment, it's really just about the story as a whole. It is also the only one that can be read as either in Dean's or Cas' POV, whereas the others are very much locked into one or the other - or alternating - this is easily read through either's eyes
“No no I like it, I like it a lot.” It’s a short admission but still, by the end of it, they have matching flushes on their skin. No one’s ever given him a name like that, and he’s too content to act as though he doesn’t love it.
Taking a steadying breath, he lifts an arm and reaches out to tuck Cas’ elbow into his side. His chest ends up flush with Cas’ back and every point of contact seems to light up and it's all he can do not to react. Though he can do nothing for the way his breathing changes or how his mind goes a bit out of focus with the warm skin of Cas’ neck mere inches from his lips.
Cas had walked in and sat with him just as he usually did before the misunderstanding. They talked as Dean ate, as they usually did, but when his meal was over and Cas brought the flask to his lips, Dean heard himself swallow audibly and found himself moving closer to Cas. Cas in turn had shuffled his way over as well, he mentioned that he couldn’t stay too long, what with his family up in the house waiting for him, but Dean hadn't cared, he’d pulled Cas into a commanding kiss, savouring the growl he was gifted in return for his sudden and enthusiastic advances. He’d climbed into Cas’ lap and within minutes they were bare from the ass up, chests heaving, lightheaded, cleaning themselves up best they could.
“I mean it would make sense, wouldn't it? He wants to be Chuck's favourite and always has; a chance like this won't ever come around again. He’d be an idiot not to take it.”
Castiel had stolen a moment to see Dean before the rest of his siblings arrived. Without asking, he took Dean his breakfast, catching the man early, and if Castiel was right, still not fully awake.
“Being a strategist for heaven led to some hard to kick habits, yes.” Cas said back still a little unsure.
“Are you okay? Was I too rough?” he asks quickly, his eyes shooting all across his body looking for harm done.
Knowing that Cas is stuck in there living his regrets over and over and over, all while Dean can’t fucking work fast enough to save him would be enough to send anyone into the comfort of a bottle. And Dean may be one of a kind but he’s never been that strong.
Cas lets out a short laugh at his frustration and drops his hips placatingly. The pressure has his back arching from the ground and as one hand reaches up to thread through Cas’ soft hair the other grips onto the blanket Cas had directed them to.
“What do you think tomorrow’ll bring?” he slurs, sleep colouring his voice just as Dean had thought.
They stood and Dean used Jack as support, all fixed up or not his body was slowly devolving into that of an old man’s and what he thought must have been a few days laid up in a bed did nothing to help his back stiffness.
Dean’s not sure when he heads inside again, or how he finds himself at the tree almost every day since.
“You like that huh? Can’t even get off anymore and you’re still loving it.” He’d never been one for such talk while being intimate, though that was partly because he and the person he was with couldn't afford to be heard. But with Dean, and the seclusion behind the stables, something within him snaps and filthy words tumble from his mouth without hesitation.
If anyone would like a complete list of the plot points and such that I covered and fixed within this story I would love to know to give you one (one final point gets covered in the next part just fyi)
This world deserves to be saved in all its fucked up and fantastic glory, it deserves another chance.
In the wake of his completed reincarnation, the sloughing off of death’s hold on him, the song takes on intense new meaning, which is no surprise really. His heaven is and has always been the moments he and Dean spend alone together, afternoons in the music room or midnights spent wrapped around each other. His lover is the sunlight, to keep the goddess on their side Cas and then Dean offered their sacrifices. Deathless deaths in multiples, love is worth more than what Sunday’s used to hold.
“Are you okay?” Cas asks, his voice hinting at concern. “That's the second time in as many days that you've expressed discomfort while using your arm.”
It’s overwhelming, having everyone together again. But as much as it picks at his nerves—they may be family but that doesn’t mean Castiel has unlimited patience with them—he can’t help but let his heart fill up with every smile he sees on one of his sibling’s faces. Or the rapt attention the kids, nieces and nephews included, give his older brother as he explains just what it’s like in the big city.
Rationalization (of the past and the present, the lies and the truths, the differences of the worlds you came from, the fact that you failed to protect him once and you won’t survive if you fail again and the fact that all your life you were locked away but freedom comes with risks you couldn’t have imagined) takes time. It’s ugly and messy and fraught with pain. But a love that aches is still proof of a love that exists.
“I’m sure he’s fine; you’ve made an astounding number of friends here. He’s probably just being polite and talking with them,” Sam says knowing exactly how Dean gets when this happens.
Dean sighs in resignation, Cas cropping up in his head at the idea of having a partner is just cruel. Cruel to him and cruel to Cas, a man with such promise and capabilities, to imagine him stuck to someone like Dean for the rest of his life. What can Dean offer to him that he doesn't already have? What can Dean do for him considering the life he’s led? It matters not, Dean may be privy and well versed to immoral actions in the eyes of God but Cas, Cas was—he’s cut off as words flit through his mind,
His own body is a map of scars, dips and valleys, memories played out upon his flesh. His shoulder pains him when a storm is ready to descend upon them, the joint flares in its socket as though it longs to pop out again. Phantom pain lances him through all parts of his once broken body, often when he least expects it. The body remembering pain more so than the mind does. Cas takes the time to soothe it until it quiets again.
Because yes his brother is dead, but also his brother is directly in front of him talking about taking refuge in a church named for him. Because now it’s only Michael in there and he doesn't know how to mourn Adam, but fuck if that kid didn’t deserve so much more than the Winchester curse.
The bruising had been the worst part, with the pain diminishing a few days after the incident and the mobility returning before a week had passed. He was out of the sling after only three redressings—the fabric untied only to check his healing and his joints mobility—but the bruising had still been an issue, yellow and green splotches stretched around the curve of his shoulder and across the blade of it on his back, it made sleeping an extra pain as he’d taken to moving around again after his binding had been done away with.
“If you want I can pretend I only heard what I commented on, in case you want to tell me the rest yourself,” He replied, angling his torso back so Dean was less crowded, he missed the closeness immediately.
He turns back to his table just as Sam walks through the front door. A bright smile replaces the waning one from his and Victor’s conversation and he stands to pull his brother into a hug.
“I was tryna make friends with Ringer over there but mister had other ideas and he tipped me back,” Dean says with a head jerk and a cut-off laugh at the horse that seems to care not about the pain he’s caused. “Landed right on my shoulder, think it might have broken but I’m not sure.”
He can’t blame them, really; if he’d had the option to prioritize safety back in the day whenever a debt had been collected or a deal settled, no matter the likelihood of it going south he would have made Sam stay as far away from the whole ordeal as possible. His father taught him young to protect his family. ‘One job, boy,’ he’d always say. ‘Keep him safe.’ His stomach churns remembering how often he failed.
After losing Cas to his deal with the empty Dean's grief shows itself in determination (like after Sam's death in s2,
Cas battles the fear of learning you’ve loved a person who was never fully who you thought they were. If they lied about so much can you even be sure they told the truth about loving you? Can you honestly know if your love for them was even real when for all intents and purposes you loved a person that didn’t exist? What do you do when the person who lied to you both is and isn’t standing in front of you? What do you do when bit by bit the resemblance fails because you created a portrait in your mind that sustained you for almost a century and a half but the paint you used was tinted rose, and the man you immortalized was stained with blood instead.
Dean had been nervous, though he wouldn't admit it, at the prospect of the entire Novak family being on the farm. He kept as much to himself as he could and had yet to meet the majority of the Novack family that lived in the house. Cas’ younger brothers and sisters seemed to be occupied any time Dean went near or into the house, be it because they were not yet awake or focused on their lessons. Once the rest of the family showed up, however, there would be a higher chance of crossing paths.
Closer and closer and closer, Cas grinds into him, he winds tighter, a bow taught and yet pulled still, driven to breaking.
Cas makes a noncommittal hum in response before following it with, “I can’t imagine he quite enjoys this song and dance, perhaps I have been letting him unlearn it all just to test your abilities with him, prove to myself what my father already believes.”
Watching his siblings run around playing and reading, huddled around one of the novels they have, a family favourite if Castiel remembers anything from his own childhood, seeing their smiles and the proud way they show him that they’ve completed their work, Castiel wishes he never had to leave the house at all.
He grits his teeth against the flare of anger that blooms, it’s no time to lash out. “Someone had to make money, someone had to make sure that Sam had clothes and school supplies, and food in his stomach, now it wasn't my mama’s fault she wasn't there to help but it sure as hell was my father’s fault that that was put on me.” Bloody and cold, that’s how he found his father, in a maze of back-allies a full day after he was supposed to come home.
The next morning he’d woken, cock straining against the fabric of his trousers. The wisps of a dream slipping from his mind in fragments. A flash of stark, near black hair, mused and messy. A glimpse at eyes so blue they put anything in comparison to shame. Words spoken lowly, the gravel of them shooting sparks down his back. Dean knew he shouldn’t, it was beyond wrong to pleasure himself using the thoughts of a man who was, at best, his friend. But he needed it, it’d been so long and the weeks in Cas’ presence had strung him so tight that he was astonished that he hadn’t snapped already.
He walks past Cas on his way to one of the cabs, it’s the largest the family owned and has enough seating for eight, with tie-ups for six horses, in short, there’s a lot to ensure was working properly in case the family has cause to use it.
As he walks into the house, he spares another glance towards Dean but is only greeted with the man's back as he walks towards the stables. Castiel huffs a disconcerted laugh at his own intense inner monologue. Dean seems so unbothered by the distance between them lately, and he can bet that Dean is not sparing him a single thought right now, nor would he even if their roles were reversed and Castiel was the one being cold.
It seems our unnamed man is going to stick around a little longer. Besides it's only a week, really how much can happen in that time, I mean it's only a few more days right?
I would like to quickly say that I know almost nothing about raising, training, or taking care of horses and as such (even though no one would) do not take what you see here as advice about horses.
Cas drops his head against Dean’s collarbone as he locks up above him. Twin whimpers sound from them as Cas’ spend mixes with Dean’s on their bare torsos.
He wonders if his father will keep him at his side, helping him in the days before his siblings come home. He can only imagine Gabriel’s face if and when he learns that Castiel allowed their father to dictate how he spent his time without even a few words of fight from him. The two of them had long ago grumbled to one another about the way their father was at times. Hardly ever letting on to their father or their siblings of the issue they took with their orders, it fell to the other to lend an ear to the nonsense.
He lands as gently as he can on his back. Cas crawls over his lower body and holds himself up above Dean. Heat skirts down his body as Cas looms over him. Needing him closer, Dean brackets his legs up on either side of Cas’ body, caging him in as effectively as Cas has him caged.
He smiles as he walks into the room and sits opposite them. “I’ve done a great deal of thinking in the past weeks since my older siblings were home. Seeing them living their lives, being happy with what they had found for themselves made me realize something,” he pauses. He can see that his mother is getting excited thinking that he’s going to request a courtship. He wishes he could say he hates to disappoint her but he doesn’t. “I’m ready to start my life, my proper life. I’ve discerned that to do this, I’ll need to leave. Being here at home, I find myself too drawn into the routines that we’ve had for so many years, and to begin my adult life I need to be able to separate myself from that.” None of what he’s saying is technically a lie. It's just not the full truth either.
If he’d thought on Dean’s first night that he was in trouble, it was cemented that night, as he talked to the man while checking his bandages, how foolish he was to have thought that based just on Dean's appearance alone. The fact of the matter was that knowing him in any capacity had decimated any hope of walking away from their time together, however short, unscathed. And yet he knows he would welcome whatever damage the universe deemed fit to deal him.
He looks up at Cas, who is staring back at him with a wistful smile adorning his face. He holds out his hand, the scars standing out against the tan of his skin, but where he normally would care, he doesn't, he simply waits for Cas to reach out as well and as he clasps their hands together and as the jolt he knew would tear up his arm settles in his heart he says, “Hi, my name’s Dean, Dean Winchester.”
Cas’ eyes light like fire as he stares down at Dean. The thrill of his position coupled with Cas still grinding against him and stroking them together sends him careening towards the edge faster than anything has before.
Dean’s a little unsettled that Cas never asked the hardest question to answer, but he’s glad too. If Cas wishes to stay ignorant, that's his choice. He’s not about to jeopardize any part of what he and Cas have by telling him.
“It must have slipped my father's mind,” Cas says when he realizes that Dean can’t seem to say a thing. His face is hidden behind a mask. Dean wants to think it is one of false indifference but he has no way of knowing for sure.
When he looks up from his hands, his fingers twitching with the memories that refuse to settle, Cas is looking into his face, eyes open when he knows his are guarded, and he wishes, not for the first time, that he was able to reflect that look back at Cas, but fear grips at his chest and keeps its hold deep in his spine. He looks at the ground instead.
They still have a couple days of travel ahead of them but Dean decides as he looks at the map that they’re going to add a day and take the more populated route. It’ll take them far more north than they need to be but he knows that the amount of people on the trail will give them safety in numbers.
“I want you to teach me to shoot now. You said that it was too loud to do before, but now no one’s around to hear us.”
With freshly cleared eyes, he sees Dean press the tip of the pen against the paper, nervous though only Castiel can tell.
The sounds and the silences that filter through the closed windows are broken only by Cas minutes later.
Castiel is silent for a beat too long after that sentence, “No, father you don’t need to do that. It’s just that—” Castiel pauses, “he’s got no one Pa. I figured it was the least I could do to be a friend to him.” He doesn't wait for his father's response before continuing on, “He’s been alone all his life, he almost seemed desperate for it.” There’s a laugh on his face, the corners of his mouth ticked up to persuade his father. Of all the sins he’s committed in his life this one seems the most egregious.
One night he plays the song for Dean, when the spring shoots are digging their way to the surface and the snowdrops are withering. He says nothing when Dean’s hold on him tightens as the song plays, he doesn’t mention the hitches in his husband’s breath or the redness in his eyes when Dean hits replay on the song. He doesn’t bring up the way this song seems to recount their story with startling accuracy, he knows Dean understands.
Cas puts out all but one of the room's lights, and in the increasing darkness, his body grows heavy.
Cas bursts out laughing at that, head thrown back, eyes screwed shut, smile gummy as all hell. And as it does every time, that smile steals Dean’s breath right from his chest.
Castiel is taken aback by the low blow Dean just dealt him, for all he’s talked about his disagreements with his ma about the practice of marriage, he thought Dean would understand how falling into line would make him feel more like a fraud than anything else and how much he would hate himself for doing so. Not willing to give him the satisfaction of a response, Castiel soldiers on.
“I have a bit of a rule son, I’m only Ma’am to those I don't know. I’d hope that soon you’ll call me Jody instead.”
Dean’s walking back around the house when he hears who he assumes to be Charles exit through the front door. He decides to walk to the stables instead of greeting the buyer at the house, partially to allow Charles to say his greetings and discuss some details about the proceeds and partially to delay the inevitable.
The ledge his toes are on isn’t the best, a scant inch at most and before Dean is even properly up on it his toe slips the slightest bit. Cursing to himself he shifts again moving up the wall. It's a terrible position for what he wants to do, but it's the only way to get access to Ringer without opening the stall and risking it.
“Of course they do, I’m their favourite,” Gabriel jokes, but Castiel can see the understanding in his eyes. Gabriel turns again to grab their bags and Castiel catches sight of Kali.
“Good, as Charles’ son you are our best option for a witness.” He knows it to be true. Jody knows that he has knowledge of the farm’s finances, a low stake-holding in the property, a good understanding of Dean’s character, and knowledge of the fact that he will in no way directly benefit from this deal. In fact, he thinks, this deal is a direct detriment to him.
Sam texts him to meet him in the garage. Michael seems to have taken residence in one of the rooms in their hall so the garage is the best bet to make sure that they aren’t overheard.
Castiel isn't sure of the purpose behind this trip but concedes to let his father do as he wishes so as to expedite the process and have him leave. The sour feeling hasn't left his stomach from the night before, but he isn't about to let on to either of them lest they begin to question him about it.
Perhaps he is preparing himself for the days after Castiel's siblings arrive, knowing that he’ll be taken away from their work together to visit with them.
Cas had told him one night that an old cut had gotten infected, a small branch had gone into her arm as she played but it had seemingly healed, however beneath the closed skin it festered and made her ill. The doctor in town was able to catch it in time, keeping her there to have it monitored with the utmost care as the reopened wound healed again.
Cas helps him slide his arm into his shirt sleeve, then his head, staying silent the entire time. It's unnerving, for the first time in a while Dean feels uncomfortable in Cas’ presence. Maybe the scars are too much for him, it’s easy to ignore his past when you are faced with it so gruesomely.
He wants to ask what his name is, but doesn’t, content to keep them on the same level for now, two nameless strangers.
He opens his eyes and the image he’s faced with spurts precome from the tip of his cock and a shudder rips through him. Cas is slack-jawed, his eyes fathomless pits of black; his arousal swallowing what little blue that had been there before. He stares at Dean and there's not a soul on the planet that could mistake the pure lust and adoration that make their home across his features. It's enough to stop his breath short, he flushes root to tip, the sparks fly along every inch they are connected.
His hand stalls as he reaches for his pack, he can’t leave now, he’d never make it far enough without a horse and with the rest of the family arriving in a few days, he’d have a price on his head larger than ever if he was to take off with their property.
After supper he joins Gabriel and Kali in Hannah's room, they talk until she starts to fall asleep and his heart is so full he thinks it might overwhelm him.
He looks back at the face of the man, shadows fall across it, defining its hills and valleys like a map, but his face is open and pure and he feels like he could be trusted with this, trusted with at least parts of the truth. He's not sure what it is about this man but the last time he felt this way was with Sam.
Sam spews some bullshit about the positioning of the sun for reasons Dean will never understand and they plan to leave the next morning.
. Tomorrow maybe, the day after, next week, he doesn't know. He’s only sure that he can’t say goodbye today.
“I wanted it ya, but that same world, those unions or rather the Board meant that I couldn't really have it. But you clearly seem to be able to have it now, the perfect mix of hunter life and picket fences even if you are technically 20 feet underground.”
“Dean, you have nothing to be sorry for… aside from shutting down these last couple days. Though now I understand why that happened, you can’t expect me not to be upset when you act like that.”
By sundown, when the ground and the sun are just beginning to meet, they have made some obvious progress on the foal and as they leave, he hears the tell-tale sound of the cab coming near the farmhouse. Cas nearly runs from the stable to get to Remy’s side by the time she stops and he quickly sets on Charles, supposedly about the condition of his sister.
He deflects when Michael asks about Sam’s work translating until his brother makes his way back into the library.
The blankness of Cas’ expression chills him. Dean has never seen such an emotionless expression on Cas’ face. Then again, he’s also never seen Cas in a business deal setting, maybe the man has an incredible poker face when it comes down to brass tacks.
Dean lets out a noise he thinks the man would be ashamed of in different circumstances and surges forward. The hard press of soft lips has his body taking over and shoving Dean hard against the wall behind him. A moan rises unbidden from his throat when Dean runs his tongue along their slotted lips.
His fingers dance along Cas’ shoulder and arm, and he smiles when Cas hums contentedly. Cas tongues and sucks small marks along the plain of his chest. Cas lets out a small noise as he licks the sweat from Dean’s skin. It’s not done to arouse, and so there's only one conclusion for Dean to come to.
“That’s fine, family is the most important thing,” Dean says quickly, tensely. Castiel can see the stance of his shoulders is just as tight as it was the day before and realizes that Dean has not smiled properly at him at all yet. Though he rarely smiled much at all, Castiel had been the recipient of a fair number of them since they became tentative friends and far more when they became more confident in their newly made friendship.
“Tell me a good memory,” he requests, a shine of unshed tears just barely visible in his fathomless blue eyes.
When the shot rings out it clears the tree, straying so wide doesn’t lay a scratch on it. Dean schools his expression, no one is a crack shot the second they start shooting, but Cas still manages to be disappointed in himself.
“Shall we start that tomorrow?” he asks, watching the clouds of dust that puff out from his boot toe as he scuffs his feet gently in the dirt. Cas stops, so briefly that he nearly misses the halt in his gait, and he eyes up the man in confusion.
She starts for the door with Cas trailing behind her and Dean’s left to hobble his way down the stairs, good arm—despite the burn—on the railing to stabilize him and slowly makes his way to the barn. Cas’ ma was right, the leg
It’s not necessarily an outward claim that he desires, it's always been too risky to mark any of his partners or be marked by them. What he wants is for Dean to feel it, for Dean to know of the claim laid upon him and, because he can’t have that, he settles. He wonders what claiming a man destined to leave really accomplishes, nevertheless he does it.
“Dean,” he says as he tightens the grip in his hair, causing him to jerk back with the force of it, he doesn't have to say anything else, Dean’s eyes haze again as he takes in what Castiel can only imagine is a face that brooks no argument in its heat.
Castiel isn’t stupid, if he sees an out, he’s going to take it. Lying now means that his father won't think twice about him and Dean and what Castiel’s earlier insolence could have meant. “Yes, Pa, I just wanted to make sure that the farm would be okay if I were to go, with the assurance you gave me it’s made it far easier to come to the decision to leave in good conscience. I love you both,” he’s not sure why those words taste like a lie. “I know you want what's best for me, this is how I get that.”
Dean bites Cas’ lower lip after Cas pairs a flick of his tongue with a strong thrust against his continuously moving hips. Cas growls against his mouth before devouring him again.
Dean quickly spins on his heels, not wanting to hear the end of the conversation, though it plays in his mind regardless. He imagines that by now Cas and his father are laughing over the drifter who never had a life that he could be proud of, laughing because Dean thought Cas could even for a moment enjoy his company.
Cas looks so genuine, so damn concerned for what he wants, that he finds himself nodding along with what Cas is saying. He doesn't want Cas to stop calling him that, he just doesn't want it to make him scared. He gets a soft smile in return. For now, it’s enough to quiet his fear, they’re both here, perhaps a little worse for wear, but here nonetheless.
“Why do you have so many cuts on you?” she asks referring to his scars, which stand out against his tanned skin. He hadn’t even realized his sleeves were up, each day he’s grown more comfortable with them, mostly thanks to Cas and his constant and unwavering acceptance of the marks on his body, no matter if what caused them was his fault or not.
When Michael lands the archangel blade into Lucifer's chest it’s a minor victory at best but still, it’s a victory.
It makes him slightly uncomfortable, the idea of sneaking his way into gathering information, he would hate to solidify to this stranger that people are always after something so he decides that if he’s going to try to learn about the man, he’ll be honest about it.
Dean takes the head of his cock into his mouth; the pressure is blinding and the heat of his wet tongue along the underside of his shaft is beyond anything he’s experienced before.
It's as long a shot as any they've tried to take but if there's even the smallest chance that they could get even a bit of Michael's grace they might actually be able to get Cas back.
“Oh, I hadn’t thought about that…” Sam says distracted with the finer details of planning swirling around his head.
Without leaving, he’s powerless to stop any of it because he doesn't want it to end. In the end, it will be better for everyone for him to move on. He just has to keep telling himself that.
“I never went to school because if I did, we’d’ve starved. Now, I don't need your sympathy so you’d best not start offering it.” He shuts his eyes against the flashing images of a vacant stare, of blood, and the heavy weight of reality on his young shoulders and against the nausea that rolls through his stomach as violently as it always has. His brain may be numb to it but his heart isn’t always quite as apathetic.
He loses himself in the press and glide of their lips coming together again and again, in the gripping of Cas’ fingers on the back of his neck, in the small noises that are pulled from each of their throats.
Cas swallows with a bit of difficulty, clearly forcing the food down before he should have, and coughs once before he answers. “The land’s been in our family for a few generations,” Cas clears his throat after hearing how raspy it is and he’s silently grateful. “We work as much as we choose to and the money goes to simple things, food, clothes, Hannah’s care now I suppose… I can't remember the last time I saw much of the property listed on our records as having a payment due. We don't farm much as you can see, that's part of the reason why it has been so long since Pa has brought someone here to help.”
Heat washes over him with each of Cas’ words. Never has a lover been so intent on praising him and it’s making his head swirl as the sincerity hits him.
It’s night by the time Cas and Dean get more than a second of quiet together and Dean’s beside himself with nerves, scared to go through with the decision, scared not to, scared to talk about it, scared of what might happen if he holds it all in.
He had spent time with Remy as he waited, it seemed a requirement of his body to not remain stagnant. He was still at her side, petting her flank when the door clattered.
He sets Cas up in his room and leaves to let him fall asleep. There's not a single part of him that can release the tension that’s found its home in every nook and cranny of his body and mind.
Dean has always been one to ensure proper care of what few possessions he owns; they often needed to last far longer than intended and constant upkeep was the only way he knew how to ensure that. So one afternoon between his chores and his other responsibilities he takes the time to check his pistol, making sure that it’s as clean and undamaged as it had been the morning he left town. He’d put it off longer than he planned to but his time with the Novak’s had been so interesting and distracting and all around busy that he’d let it slide.
He stumbles after her only partially pretending to flail about down the hall. He smacks his elbow into a door frame but her giggles are worth it. As they near Hannah's room Duma dips behind him and starts to push against his back to get him to her door. Castiel can’t help but laugh when her shoes slip on the floor and despite her walking motion, she, and by extension, he, moves nowhere.
Dean was quiet for a moment, he knew that he could just say those things now, that Cas knew all that he'd kept hidden for so long but there was something stopping him. He wasn't sure what but he felt as though he owed it to himself, and the other him to at least try.
The next few hours were a whirlwind of emotions, of hugging, and of talking. Anyone and everyone that was close enough stopped by the bunker once they had learned that Dean was okay. He was shocked - but not really - to see Eileen back within the bunkers walls, with Chuck gone she didn’t have anything to fear her actions were not her own anymore.
His hips bucked violently as he imagined how Cas’ stubble would feel as it scratched along his skin, down his neck, and against his inner thigh.
“Cas, are you sure you want to do this?” The words almost hurt leaving his mouth, giving Cas an out, one that would be easier to take than going through with this. One word could break him in a way he’s never let himself get close to allowing. “One word and you can turn back and stay with your family, your siblings, I want to make sure you don’t regret this, angel.” The term of endearment slips out as he thinks of what he and Cas could have if he chooses to go with Dean. It’s fitting, no doubt, but perhaps too soon, perhaps it’s too bold of him to use it.
The poem was written about chapters 19 and 20 of the original story, but happens the fit incredibly well with the events of chapter 21 and 22.
Anger and frustration bubble up inside him again. What the hell is wrong with Dean? He isolates himself, calls Castiel by a name he knows he hates, turns every interaction cold, and yet he watches him throughout the day, and if Gabriel caught it, Dean would have to have been looking at him for days. None of it made sense, and that only served to upset him more.
The memory makes him smile, remembering how Sam’s smile had spread when he saw that the trick worked how proud of himself he had been, before it quickly changes, flashing into the sickening crunch of bone and a splatter of blood that drips and pools like a curse, like the clearest sign of failure on the ground. The panic claws at him again, phantom pain pours over him and he has to actively think of healed smiles again, eyes that shine despite the yellow surrounding them. A violent nausea settles in his stomach, so much so that he has to clench his jaw against the tightening of his throat.
Eventually, it comes time to talk about the farms themselves; the staff, the work, and where they are located. Dean knows that if he’s going to accept this job, he’s going to want to work on the farm closest to Sam. With his newfound ability to write to Sam if he so desired, he'd like to be close enough for the letters to be delivered in a timely manner.
“Jody made a convincing argument that if your pa was looking to get rid of me, it stands to reason that he doesn’t have much work for me here anymore. Plus, I’d never meant to spend very long with y’all. Truly I was just passing through, but I stuck ‘round for some time, first ‘cause of my injuries then because of Ringer. I figure that another chance like this ain’t guaranteed to come around again.”
There's no one around, but the cracks are still loud, and Dean’s not exactly looking to injure his hearing.
“You’re mighty fond of that word aren't you, ‘fine’. What is it? My pa would surely have both our hides if he found you were working with an injury, and while you may be okay with that, I am certainly not excited about the prospect of that particular activity because you won't ask for help where you need it.” It surprises him that Cas had taken notice of the grimace from the day before; he had thought he controlled it enough for it not to be noticed by him.
When his ma calls from the door he sighs and leans back to peak at her, stressing the poor joints at the base of his spine to do so. When he turns back Winchester is quickly drinking again from his flask and a zing shoots down his core as a smirk plays upon his lips. He hopes he is reading this correctly and that Winchester may be into his particular brand of blasphemy.
