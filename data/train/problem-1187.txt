The heat in John’s gut was growing. He didn’t have that much time before his orgasm would overtake him. John reached around Sherlock’s hip and wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s neglected, throbbing cock. It only took three pumps of Sherlock’s member before he was clenching around John’s cock, his voice reaching an octave he never thought he could reach, and coming over John’s fist. John chased his orgasm, using Sherlock’s tight body to finish himself off. He came inside Sherlock with a shout of the detective’s name.
“You’re such a clever man, Sherlock Holmes,” John murmured in his ear, tongue flicking out to lick his lips as it does when he’s waiting for a response. Sherlock opened his mouth but couldn’t speak. His words caught in his sandpaper rough throat. Hurt by Sherlock’s silence, John backed away. Sherlock craned his neck to look at the other man, but he was beyond his sights. The warmth that his hand left on Sherlock’s face dissipated.
“Don’t be an idiot, John. You can’t possibly know that.” John moved away a little, only noses apart from Sherlock. They stared into each other’s eyes.
John used his other hand, originally supporting himself against the wall, to yank Sherlock by the collar to the floor. Sherlock fell hard on his knees, his mouth still attached to John’s heavy cock. He reached up unsteadily to hold onto John’s hips, but his hands were slapped away. The rush of air was making his head spin worse. His untouched dick throbbed painfully in his pants. Sherlock leaned into the thrusts as he placed his palms on the floor. John wrapped his fingers in Sherlock’s thick curls and held Sherlock’s face to his cock. Sherlock’s nose was shoved into the dark blond curls of his pubic hair, smelling of sweat and pure John. Tears ran down his cheeks as he choked around John. Spit gurgled around John’s length.
The doctor took that as a warning to get his arse up the stairs or he would have to spend the night alone with his hand. When he entered the sitting room, the sight of Sherlock standing in front of a fresh fire stark naked took his breath away. There was nothing more beautiful than seeing the mad detective in the flickering firelight.
The muzzle of John’s handgun aimed at the center of Sherlock’s forehead. A scowl twisted John’s mouth.
“Don’t make me repeat myself, John.” John rushed forward in three long steps. Despite their height difference, in that moment, John was the largest man in the room. His body was tense, exuding the strength of a man who was comfortable with violence.
Sherlock’s face shone. The light in his eyes was similar to when he figured out a case. Inappropriate joy. John couldn’t possibly fathom why the hell he was so cheery about bad news for him.
“We’ll meet there tomorrow evening; seven o’clock. Sorry – gotta dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
On the drive back to Baker Street, John’s brow broke out in an anxious sweat. He couldn’t wait to feel more than just Sherlock’s hand on his skin. Sherlock was doing his best to keep his face aloof, but the excitement made him want to jump out his skin. Even his coat felt like too much. He loosened his scarf a bit to make room for the knot in his throat. Just because he didn’t have Sherlock’s massive intellect, John knew what arousal looked like, and Sherlock was falling prey to it.
Sherlock was cold when John gripped his shoulders to turn him to his side so he wouldn’t choke on his own vomit. Sherlock was hardly aware of John’s presence, only feeling the air warm around him. The brunet was hovering off the ground. Occasionally, he felt his body shift, but he never touched earth again. He imagined that this is what it would feel like to lay next to that doctor from St. Bart’s, settled in the warmth of his muscular and firm grasp. Normally, Sherlock felt no attraction to anyone- all of them so plainly idiotic it insulted him- but there was something else to this ex-army doctor. He was just as readily deduced as anyone else was, but he found John Watson to be refreshing and surprising.
. John could envision emptying an entire clip into Victor’s limbs and pressing the hot muzzle to his face, branding his skin like he did to Sherlock. He wondered if the bastard would run once he pulled out his gun, or would he have his own? He was a drug dealer, so it was quite possible. The man in John’s mind was faceless. If anything, John looked forward to seeing his face, and the kind of man that Sherlock thought was worth hurting himself for. John watched the young men and women casually drink and chat outside pubs and restaurants as the cabbie drove by. At that age, John was finishing up his medical degree, counting the days until he could enlist in the army. He doesn’t look down on these kids for enjoying their lives, not like many bitter people his age. They had every right to enjoy themselves, because at any moment, it could be taken away. John only wished that they find their purpose for living. He had thought that his reason for living was the military, but after being invalided home, he realized just how quickly it could change, and he hoped to death that these kids would find a new one quicker than he did.
Sh’lok’s mind went up in a tumult of astonishment, of sheer amazement on being offered something that he had secretly profoundly longed for, but long dismissed as impossible. Yet he still needed to be sure that John fully appreciated the ramifications
Before he could get any more frightened, John reached up to the half-dome of the Teacher device and guided it down to hang just over Lestrade’s head.
“Captain,” said Sh’lok’s voice from the communicator, alarmed. “Are you all right?” And then, much more urgently: “John?
She reached out and switched on the little screen, touched one of the controls next to it to make an adjustment. A second later John found himself looking at this world’s Sh’lok on that screen, sitting at his desk with arms folded, looking thoughtful, even a touch grim.
The effort had cost him. John lay there against the hard, shifting surface and groaned softly as he spent a moment recovering himself from the impact. But only a moment.
Lestrade’s voice, gone suddenly very quiet, brought John’s head around. “Is this your sister, John?” he said.
“Might pain me to admit it, Sh’lok, but you’re a genius about most things,” Lestrade said. “This won’t be any different. Now get the hell out of here and let me deal with your damn paperwork.”
At which point the door to Sh’lok’s quarters flew open, Dr. Hooper (with a faint shriek) fairly flew out of it, and the bowl of plomeek soup, lid and all, flew out the door right after her and crashed into the opposite wall hard enough to leave a dent.
set in and the orders changed. Sit tight and see if things stay stable. Wait to see if Intelligence might get bored with you. Or find another piece they wanted taken off the board.” She shrugged, a kind of
“If at any point in the future,” Sh’lok said, “in conversation, or a meeting, or some similar event… if at such a time I seem to you to be in danger of showing signs that I think myself capable of invariably having all the data I need to arrive at the correct answer to a problem, or of being automatically able to arrive at that answer…” He paused, then said, much lower, “If you would possibly just whisper the word ‘neutrino’ to me.”
Lestrade was so stricken that John’s anger began muting itself almost before it was fairly started. “I didn't need to throw the blinding white light at all, John.” He swallowed. “Sh’lok, I—”
He drew Sh’lok’s face close again, tilting the opposite way from the usual so as to be out of the way of the fingers.
He breathed in, breathed out. “It is my sister,” he said to Lestrade. And John stopped, corrected himself; made the single change of word it had never,
Sh’lok swallowed hard against the ache in his throat. He wanted to pour scorn on this idea too, as something suggested or enflamed by the
“Yes, I'm aware of that.” John paused,  If we could only win its—” And in a flash, it came to him. “Confidence—”
John let the thought of hearing this man actually say that to him, and in front of a witness, sink in deep. “Thank you, Mr. Sh’lok.”
“We do not resist you,” Tharn said with that same practiced, weary patience John had heard from him during the days proceeding.
“They’ve been under your command for months, John. Panic is not their mode. They’ll be coping, as you well know. And probably laying more bets.”
Grinning to himself, John bent over to start getting his own boots off, considering that he couldn’t think of a single time when the act had seemed so ridiculously, sensually
“We’ll stay,” John said to S’kroft. And if he let a little of his thought out on his face, an expression along the lines of
John turned and stood still as his eyes got used to the dimness in the shuttle bay. To either side of him, pale half-seen boxy shadows, the two shuttlecraft
He let them all take Sh’lok away into the turbolift and sat in the center seat for some minutes until he was quite certain of his control. Then John went after.
John gave him an annoyed look, though the annoyance wasn’t meant for him. “It’s called ‘blood,’” he said. He glanced from him over to Mrs. Hudson. “Watch your step. The officers move up by assassination. Bradstreet tried it on me.”
He and his own Sh’lok had tussled mind-to-mind this way a number of times, testing their respective abilities, seeing who could get the upper hand and who could keep it. John had quickly learned that the experience was much like their hand-to-hand sparring sessions in several ways. Sh’lok was far stronger than John, but John could be far quicker than expected. And while Sh’lok was incredibly observant and perceptive, and swift to learn John’s moves, John could always surprise him at least once and gain a lot of ground before Sh’lok could find a way to interfere.
Sh’lok produced one of those resigned yet amused down-the-nose sniffs that John had learned to translate as
so. John took just the second or so necessary to orient himself and then leaned very slightly past the edge of the office’s window, ever so slowly and carefully peering in.
In response, all around him the landscape shivered harder and the wind started to rise. John shifted his balance and braced himself against the wind, and
would have been strong candidates. But fortunately, for the moment there were only two words he needed to use.
“I don't know.” John let that sink in. It wasn’t often the Vulcan made such statements in the clear. Yet he also noted Sh’lok’s very slight quirk of an eyebrow, and his glance at the desk. “But there is a possibility…”
John stood there considering that Sh’lok had no better odds to offer at the moment than “might.” And the sound of Sh’lok and Lestrade bickering as if they were back on the ship and everything was fine was both painful, and a comfort of the most peculiar kind.
And when the man in question stepped off the pad and, instead of shouting demands and imprecations, simply gazed around him in a tightly managed astonishment, Sh’lok’s mind absolutely caught
was what the back of John’s mind said, with no hesitation at all. But he had to keep his response more restrained: for a starship’s captain, there were inevitably other considerations.
that he couldn’t think of a thing to do except reach out for Sh’lok’s elbow and brace him, support him through it.
And also— As he was pulling his second one off, he glanced sideways to see how Sh’lok was getting on, and realised suddenly as the man finished peeling off his socks that he’d never really noticed how
Sh’lok tilted his head “yes” and got up to bring over the 3D board and the pieces. When he sat down and they began setting up the pieces in their starting position, John knew he couldn’t let this particular issue go unhandled for even a second longer. He said, “Sh’lok, I wonder if you’d explain something to me.”
He hurried for the turbolift, listening to Donovan taking reports from the various decks as he left. From the sound of it a few personnel had sustained minor bumps and knocks as they fell unconscious, but the ship itself was unharmed.
John grinned. “Why Sh’lok, you wound me to the quick. And before I’ve even had a second cuppa to cushion the blow.”
Ever so gently John squeezed what he felt hardening under his touch, and stroked and squeezed again until he felt Sh’lok buck up against against his hand, pressing into it. John promptly took the hand away. “You’ll doubtless have observed that I have an evil streak to match, then,” he murmured. “Better watch out…”
In retrospect he could not be sure what troubled him more—the tedium of dealing with the messy distasteful aftermath of the dreams, or the persistent and illogically sweet memory of cobalt eyes gazing down on him from very close,
It was not the kind of word you could simply put back where you found it. John stood up in the dimness, feeling it beating in his hands, and cupped them together to shelter it. He had the sudden sense of standing on a precipice, on the knife-edge of choice. That sense sent the adrenaline running up and down his spine, prickling his skin, speeding his pulse.
been affected. And we can’t leave any of these things alive, either, or they’ll start reinfecting the population as fast as they can. And if any of them have squirreled themselves away somewhere in the dark as a life insurance policy…”
The response was a wholly illegible scramble of images that served admirably as a stand-in symbol for extreme cognitive dissonance.
“Yes, Mr. Sh’lok, all right,” he said as he got to his feet and stared around him. “We… seem to have had a cave-in.” He coughed once or twice; rock dust was still floating in the air.
Bradstreet was standing by him, watching the beginning of the process and acting as an informal scrub nurse, not that there had been any scrubbing — indeed, there wasn’t even a sterile field operating, at least not one John could detect. But then there hadn’t been one on the
But on balance, it seemed to John that the two of them had been through more than enough today. Teasing was perhaps a bit premature, until they’d had some time to recover themselves. Also, Sh’lok had reached out to him, was
This ship was the right place. This time was the right time. And now something new had happened: another set of conditions manifesting themselves which were also, John thought, part of the right-place-right-time nexus. But now it was his hand on the strings.
“They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire procedure. You cannot ignore the consequences.”
Surely Lestrade would understand, surely despite his inevitable and understandable anger at what had happened Sh’lok could still depend on his assistance—
It took until his midshift break, when John went to stretch out briefly in his quarters to let the inevitable tension-ache in his back ease off, before he was able to find his way past the quandary in which Starfleet’s new orders had left him.
So for the moment he just took a few steps forward to face Sh’lok, meeting his eyes just as intensely in a way meant to imply
For a few brief moments Kara struggled in panic. “No, the knowledge is forbidden, I must not know the secret! I will be punished—!”
kept him, for almost all his waking hours, in the role of guardian, protector, defender of all the lives inside her. John couldn’t think when he’d last been able, especially in a moment this intimate, to let himself relax into being the protected.
John nodded. Bradstreet looked over at him from his seat at the helm console. “Range forty three thousand and closing…”
“That's what he's been going through,” Lestrade said. “I've never seen anything like it. It’s no wonder the poor devils go mad.”
Out of the corner of his eye, John saw one of Sh’lok’s eyebrows go up. “Well, that’s about it, Watson. Thanks for everything.”
The events of the minutes that followed removed that John Watson temporarily from further observation. The man instantly seized on Sh’lok’s question as to whether he had felt any abnormal effects on beaming up, and used it to take himself and the rest of the landing party off to Sickbay, safely sequestered from public observation. This turn of events added data that Sh’lok very much wanted. The new John Watson showed no slightest alarm-response on being addressed as “Captain”, such as would suggest he found it strange or was concealing some other, lesser (or for that matter, greater) rank. The quick decisiveness and flexibility he exhibited were also reliable indicators. Therefore the man who left the Transporter room in company with the landing party was unquestionably a starship commander, a close parallel to his own Captain John Watson…
“John,” Sherlock exclaimed. John’s heart skipped. He abandoned the bag to face Sherlock’s hidden eyes. With his head bent, Sherlock’s curls hung over his face. John glanced around to see that no one had suddenly entered the flat.
“It explains your distracted and dazed state, but what of the rest of you?” Sherlock rubbed his palms into his eyes until he saw black spots dance across his vision. John was asking so many questions. He had so much to say and just needed to get it all out first.
Sherlock shot up into the sitting position as soon as he was certain the landlady was gone. John had folded his hands over his lap awkwardly, unsure of what to do with his hands now that they weren’t in those unruly curls.
John switched on the telly and listened to Sherlock deduce the lives of each newscaster and meteorologist. Sherlock complained about the lack of tea when Mrs. Hudson walked in.
“It is proving to be quite difficult, I’m afraid. Whatever it is that is going on with John, it is definitely not my area.”
Lestrade rolled his eyes impossibly hard despite the growing smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. “You’re acting like a child, Sherlock,” he jabbed. Sherlock’s mouth opened in angry retort, but closed it as soon as John cleared his throat in warning.
John stared at his quivering hands and balled them up tightly in his lap. “I never expected you to fix me, but I didn’t think that I would worsen,” he sighed. “I thought that maybe you would provide enough distraction that I wouldn’t have time to consider how much I wanted to die, but then you were the one to, and I was plunged into the worst of it.”
John leaned forward to kiss the corner of Sherlock’s frown. “I’m in no rush-” Sherlock interrupted John with a nip at his lips.
As Sherlock was loaded into the back, John wrapped his arms around the landlady’s shoulders as she cried softly. He whispered reassuring things into her hair.
“I’m not doing that anymore.” Sherlock moved to stand, but Victor’s hand tightened painfully around Sherlock’s.
“I appreciate it.” He moved over to let the movers bring in the chair. Sherlock fidgeted with his scarf.
John sat back against the sofa. He had allowed Sherlock to lose himself in thought again. He swore at himself. The whole point of them being physical was to get closer to one another and enter another stage in their relationship, but they only managed to worsen the distance. All he wanted to do was give himself to Sherlock, but how could he when the other man wasn’t receptive. Was he overstepping unspoken boundaries? Sherlock wasn’t exactly well-versed in expressing himself, so how could John possibly know what it was that was bothering him? Anger fisted John’s hands. Sherlock wasn’t telling him anything, and yet, it seemed like it was John who was to blame for their stagnant relationship. He was trying to move on from Mary, but Sherlock was being more difficult than usual. John could deal with Sherlock’s black moods when he was in withdrawal, and even the ones he had during the first couple of years living together, but this kind of behavior during an intimate moment was going to cause them problems that John never thought they would have. John knew that he couldn’t view their relationship through rose-colored glasses, but he had hoped that things would get easier once they managed to integrate each other into their lives once again.
“Shall I remind you, Sherlock,” Mycroft aimed his mechanical glare at John. “That I see and hear all.”
“Lestrade has informed me that I should communicate my feelings to you in order to better this relationship, so I am here to make my thoughts known.”
Personally, John was tired of hearing it all, but what else could he expect? He carried his past with him in the form of a cane and wore it on his shoulders. He had gathered the rest of his jumpers in a box and a few books before making his way back outside to the cab.
Greg slapped a smile on his face. “Oi, sorry about all this, sir. Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade.” John raised his hand and smiled halfheartedly.
John stood between Sherlock’s knees as they kissed. The room still held the hint of Mary’s perfume, but Sherlock’s scent was what he craved the most. John paused a moment.
“Show me the sort of battle you have seen.” Sherlock’s heart sank. No one had seen them yet. He could hardly look at them in the mirror. He would be reminded of them when the damaged nerves would twinge, but he tried to his best to keep them hidden, not because of how they looked, but because they reminded him of the man he had become in those two years, savage and ruthless.
“Come along, John,” he called, running down the steps. “Lestrade, we will follow.” The only thing John could do was shrug when the DI rolled his eyes toward him. John hoped silently that Sherlock would be adequately distracted with the case to give him enough time to plan out just how badly John was going to hurt the bastard that marred his gorgeous consulting detective.
“He gets it for free from the best Indian place in London.” Mary shrugged, hand resting on her belly.
His heart sunk when Sherlock revealed that Mary was pregnant. It was the last thing he wanted to hear. The knot in his throat almost choked him. He tried his best to look happy, but Sherlock looked so incredibly sad. It was a slight flash, but they looked at each other like it was going to be the last. He and Mary had danced away, but John couldn’t get his face out of his head.
“I didn’t want to lie to you. I knew it was a dangerous decision, not to my health particularly, but to our renewed relationship. I was fully aware of what was at stake, and I proceeded nonetheless.” Sherlock closed his eyes again; the lights suddenly too bright.
“Maybe we can knock out more after dinner,” John offered. Sherlock shrugged. John pressed kisses along Sherlock’s shoulder and neck. “Or,” John started, leaning up into Sherlock’s ear, “We can try something different, if you’re so inclined.” Heat sparked in the center of Sherlock’s chest. He had wanted this before, didn’t he? He had spent nights in Serbia dreaming of John’s touch, and when he had returned and a relationship outside of John’s marriage bloomed, it was all he could think of. The cocaine had always increased his. . .
Other than the obvious abuse Sherlock’s face had suffered, John was looking at him at the peak of his high. He had witnessed the rise and fall, but never like this: the glazed-over distance in his gaze. Even though anger and frustration bubbled underneath his skin, he stamped it down. All he wanted to do was make sure Sherlock wasn’t dangerously injured.
Sherlock growled to himself and made his way for the door muttering, “I should have considered my options longer.” John jumped out of his chair and grabbed Sherlock’s hips before he could completely exit the room. Sarah and the other front workers eyed them oddly. John pulled them back in and gently closed the door behind them.
Lestrade picked up John’s keys from the floor where they had fallen on their stumble in and set them next to the water with a sigh. “Don’t do anything stupid, John.”
John slid closer to the edge of his chair and clasped his hands together under his chin. He placed his feet on either side of Sherlock’s. He looked up at the other man to see that he had not moved, and his chest rose and fell smoothly. “I had imagined that I would tell you this when we were on better terms, that maybe I would wake up to you watching me one day. Your hair would be wild from the pillows, and all I would want to do was stay in bed with you and tell you all the things I have wanted to. I realize that time has passed, but you still deserve to know.”
“I can’t believe it was so easy,” John scoffed. “You think I would ever touch you like this,” he commented, pressing the end of his Sig to Sherlock’s head with disgust in his eyes. “Pathetic.”
Sherlock smirked crookedly before breaking the spell and walking away. John stood there, gripping the little table next to him. He hadn’t even realized how badly his knees shook. Ten minutes had passed without Sherlock’s return. John decided to finally go wash up.
John rubbed his thumb across those brilliant cheekbones. Sherlock’s convulsions slowed to soft tremors, but John needed that ambulance to be faster. He ran his other hand down Sherlock’s side as he curled in on himself.
“Not by me or anyone else. Understood?” Sherlock nodded with wide eyes. He had expected John to fly into a rage and hunt Victor down with military precision, but he had not imagined he would react to his injuries with such care, especially under the circumstances in which he received them.
“There,” John said with a kiss to Sherlock’s temple. Every mark was covered in salve and the deeper ones stitched. Sherlock wore only a pair of thin pajama pants as John looked over his back. John carded his fingers through Sherlock’s wet silky curls.
Okay, so I know it's been an extremely long time since I last updated, and I am INCREDIBLY sorry for the long ass wait, but as many of you know, college gets in the way of happiness. Anyways, I hope this chapter was decent, and I've got one more for y'all that I'm hoping to write this weekend.
But those days were rare. Every waking moment, John swore he thought he saw Sherlock. Every tall dark haired man caught his eye and made his heart race. He would accidently order two takeaway meals, and save Sherlock’s favorite. Sitting at the microscope, he could almost feel Sherlock leaning over his shoulder and adjusting the knobs. After a while, John stopped going into the kitchen too, settling for teas and coffees from various cafés and Speedy’s next door.
“Sit with me, Sherlock.” A hot wave washed through him as he slid into John’s side of the booth. The moment Sherlock settled in, John placed his hand in his lap. His fingers curled down Sherlock’s inner thigh, but didn’t move any further, even with Sherlock’s anxious fidgeting. John gulped down half the pint without even a glance toward his partner. Sherlock glared expectantly at him.
“Not enough oxygen to that useless brain of yours,” Sherlock laughed. John eased himself onto his elbows. Sherlock stood and helped John up.
The sounds Sherlock made clenched around John’s heart. He never imagined Sherlock would breakdown like this, especially not in front of him, but whatever the damage Victor had done to him physically didn’t compare to what was happening in Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock gazed down at John, hoping that in that final look, he might see the adoration in his eyes. He lowered his arm, dropped the phone onto the roof, and stared ahead of himself. He didn’t think he could see John’s face when he did it. There would be no way he could take the step while looking at him; he would never get John’s horrified face out of his head.
“Well then, you two. I have a meeting with some gals for a pedicure. I’m finally going to get these sausages massaged and pampered.” She kissed John on the cheek. He accompanied her downstairs.
Sherlock’s throat tightened. He tried to escape into his head, but John’s touch yanked him back. He couldn’t leave him alone to swallow what he had seen. He would never leave him.
Back at his bedsit, John’s thoughts buzzed. He couldn’t seem to get that brilliant stare out of his head. He had felt like he was looking down the barrel of a gun and at any moment it could fire. John had looked up the strange man, Sherlock Holmes- what a public school kind of name- and was impressed to find his website, the Science of Deduction. There was no picture up like John had on his blog, but he could still picture that perfect cupid’s bow spouting off deductions like a machine gun. He spoke so fast and fluidly like the thoughts were coming out straight from his brain, unfiltered and raw, but it wasn’t off-putting. John rather liked it. Sherlock was so brilliant, and the thought of seeing him again tomorrow made his gut feel warm. Usually by the evenings, he has felt the call of his sidearm, could taste the oil and metal in his mouth. He had done it once, pressed his Sig into his tongue. His heart had jumped. It was the most he had felt since being out on the battlefield, but hearing Sherlock be so candid was so refreshing and he craved more of it. In that moment, he was laid out bare under Sherlock’s sharp gaze, and it was so-
One last twist of his wrist around the head of Sherlock’s cock had the taller man hollering John’s name into the silence of the flat. John soothed the fresh bite mark with gentle swirls of his tongue.
“Bend over in your chair,” John commanded. “Steady yourself on the back.” Sherlock’s brain was foggy with John’s stern voice. He loved hearing the steel in it. Sherlock imagined being in John’s company back in Afghanistan. How would John speak to him? If he acted just as he did now, would John have to punish his insubordination? Would John make him clean the latrines with his toothbrush like in those ridiculous films, or would John order him to run around the base until he vomited his stomach up? The quiver in Sherlock’s knees hurried him to bend over at the waist in front of his chair and grip the back so he wouldn’t collapse from the thought of John, dressed in his military fatigues, watching Sherlock run through his punishment. He imagined that John would be a fair captain, and Sherlock would have no reason to be angry at him for being reprimanded.
In the moments that John was admiring the man, Sherlock took notice, as he always does. He faced the window once more, finishing his performance with a flourish. He made eye contact with John, the sturdy army doctor from the hospital. The older man quickly lifted his newspaper back up. John’s heart raced under his tattered old army shirt. His mouth was full of cotton. He gave himself another breath before he peeked over the paper again. Sherlock had put down his violin but was still holding his bow against his shoulder, tongue wetting his lower lip. A jolt ran down John’s spine. That familiar warmth was welling up in his gut. Sherlock removed his jacket, draped it over one of the chairs, and rolled up his sleeves, never letting his eyes leave the doctor. He didn’t know what had come into him, but John put down the paper and walked over to the window. Sherlock’s perfect lips curled up into a smile as he unbuttoned his shirt. Heat welled up in John’s face and in his groin. He could always appreciate a beautiful human, and Sherlock, oddly enough, was one of them. He removed his striped robe, letting it fall heavily onto the floor.
The man stayed like that for over twenty minutes and then some when John returned from downstairs to receive his delivery. The doctor ate his dinner in silence at the kitchen island. It was nearly half past eleven when he decided to wash up and undress, deciding to slide his gun into the bedside table in his room. He slipped into his green and white striped robe and reached over the window sill to close the windows. The man across from him continued to lay there.
“You look ridiculous apologizing with your cock out like that.” Sherlock gripped himself and closed his eyes.
He had woken in the early hours of the morning to the flash of desert suns and bloodied guns, and as his heart pounded against his chest, he thought that maybe seeing Sherlock today would ease him. People always disappointed him in the end.
“I don’t know how I always allow you to hurt me.” John screwed his eyes tighter. Sherlock left the room and went straight to the bathroom, gently closing the door with a soft
John pushed the sleeves of his dark-green plaid shirt higher up his forearms and went to Lestrade’s side.
Sherlock loosened his arms and stood tiredly in the middle of the sitting room. “He grates my nerves,” he muttered. John rose from the desk, abandoning his forgotten blog, and stood behind Sherlock, wrapping his arms around the taller man’s chest.
“I could always tell what you were thinking in the past, but I have been unable to these last several months.”
In that short moment of hesitation, Sherlock had his answer, but when John spoke, it didn’t make it hurt any less.
“I certainly hope you’re Doctor Watson,” she laughed softly. John limped over and shook her delicate hand.
“Please, John. I need to understand what it is that you are feeling. I need to,” Sherlock let go of his arms. “I need you to be with me.”
John smirked against the cleft of Sherlock’s arse and kissed the man’s pucker like it were his mouth, pressing his tongue in and swirling around the ring wetly. The sounds coming out of Sherlock’s mouth were going straight to John’s cock. He couldn’t tease him much longer.
John was an amazing man, one of the highest compliments Sherlock could possibly ever give another person. He was brilliant and not because he held a medical degree. Sherlock’s hands still shook from years of drug use, whereas John’s were solid and unsullied by needles and pipes. He held a gun steadily like it was an extension of himself, stitched his own wounds without anesthetic, and could cut off suspects mid-chase without Sherlock having to direct him to do so. Sherlock had met a lot of average and unmemorable people, but John was danger dressed in woolen jumpers, a wolf in sheep’s clothing. This unassuming man managed to make Sherlock question whether caring really wasn’t an advantage, because when John was by his side, he was the Great Detective. It was John who made the rest of the world see Sherlock’s brilliance, and even though he teased his blog numerous times, John was the reason why he hadn’t shot out every wall at the flat.
Sherlock thought back to when Victor had given it to him in the stairwell of their dormitory. He had kissed him when he handed the box over. Sherlock had almost thought that their relationship was something more than just drugs and sex. That thought didn’t last, however, as Victor brought out cocaine to snort and fucked him against the wall.
The man reached for his dark coat. “I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t that difficult a leap.”
John stared at him for a bit. “Right.” He went around Sherlock’s chair to grab the other man gently around his bruised hips.
Well, at least now Mrs. Hudson couldn’t say anything about him not being there for Sherlock. John berated himself for letting his anger and disappointment in Sherlock get in the way of his judgement. He should have been in the back of the ambulance with him, but how could he when the sight of him reminded him of the half empty vial hidden in their bison skull. Sherlock may be incredibly thick-headed when it came to people, but he must have known that John would not take a cocaine discovery lightly, and yet, he still hid it. John leaned his head against the wall beside him. Why was Sherlock making things harder? All John wanted to do was make a smooth transition from friends to lovers. He thought that it would be so easy, considering how close they were prior to John’s marriage, but Sherlock was being his usual self. He really shouldn’t have been surprised. How many times would they have to talk about themselves just to get a more intimate relationship going? John had stopped going to therapy. The last thing he wanted was to have to talk about his
“Eat,” John commanded. Sherlock frowned but gave in and sat up. “What makes a “string of suicides” any different from other suicides,” John asked in between bites of bacon.
John closed the lid and placed it on the cushion next to him. “I don’t think it is a good idea to keep it. What do you think?”
expecting was John to offer his fork, hunk of sesame chicken and rice on it. Sherlock blinked. John raised his eyebrows.
John pulled back and shoved into Sherlock’s mouth again. He did this several more times before the tightness in his belly was reaching its height. He thrust into the back of Sherlock’s mouth one more time, cock hardening even more as he came down Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock was staring up at him with red, watery eyes, semen and saliva seeping from the corner of his mouth. John pulled out halfway and rode the rest of his orgasm, milking every last drop of his seed onto Sherlock’s tongue. John finally pulled all the way out and spoke gruffly with his stiff cock in hand.
“Sherlock,” John whispered. Sherlock stopped at the doorway of the kitchen. “Will you let me know if you feel any worse?” Sherlock hesitated. He had no right to worry John anymore, but the doctor would know if he was hiding any physical ailments from him. He nodded and proceeded to his room where he curled in on himself in the center of his bed.
John didn’t open it right away, but stared at Sherlock’s soft face, trying to read something from his somber expression. When he couldn’t gather anything from him, John opened the letter.
“Face it, Sherlock: you’ve never understood human nature, and you’ve never understood me. You dragged me around to help you solve cases and shoot the bad guys that got to you first.”
Sherlock didn’t try to move as John threw the side table into the kitchen. He ripped the letter opener from the mantle and stabbed it into the wall over and over. Sherlock heard a pair of kitten heels climb the stairs and quickly intercepted Mrs. Hudson before she could enter the flat.
“Well, maybe we’ll simply switch to something less caffeinated. Now then, you need your rest. I’ll be off now.” She pecked Sherlock’s cheek and shuffled out. John was relieved to have her finally leave for the day. He could give Sherlock all the attention he needed without worrying that Mrs. Hudson was taking mental notes of his shortcomings. John kicked his socked feet up on the corner of Sherlock’s bed and opened a well-read magazine from the side table. Sherlock stared at the bed sheets over his legs. John tried to engross himself in the inane news of another celebrity scandal, but how could he when Sherlock was sitting right there, lost in his memories once again, and looking like a fallen angel. Sherlock’s messy curls had fallen in his face as he gazed unseeingly at himself, lips slightly parted. John smiled at Sherlock. He was going to be better, try to communicate better.
“I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.” John can spot the fakeness in that smile a mile away.
They stared at each other in comfortable silence. John started to feel squirmy under Sherlock’s eyes, so he swallowed down the rest of his tea, stood, and went back into the kitchen to place it in the sink.
Sherlock’s Adam’s apple bobbed with several swallows. For a second, he looked like he was going to speak, but threw up nothing by bile on the sidewalk. Mrs. Hudson yelped. John removed Sherlock’s blue scarf and ran his hand through his sweat soaked curls. Sherlock gingerly wiped his mouth with his thumb and pressed himself into John’s side.
Lestrade almost comically skidded to a halt at the threshold of their flat once Sherlock turned to face the DI. In that moment, Sherlock had forgotten what he looked like dressed in John’s old jumper and looking like he had just come back from the dead for real this time.
The man behind him walked in front of him. Despite looking like a soldier, his slumped shoulders suggested otherwise as he held up a syringe to the spot between Sherlock’s fingers.
It was the end of them. They would not solve crimes together. John wouldn’t leave gentle kisses against his skin or call him brilliant or even stay in the same flat as him. Sherlock had ruined it, just like he always did. John would call Mycroft, and he would be sent off to another rehabilitation center where they would question his mental stability and whether or not he really wanted to get sober again. Lestrade would ban him from crime scenes, and Anderson would be relieved to never have to submit to Sherlock’s wishes again. Everything would be taken away from him, and all because he needed an extra kick to rectify his mind palace. Certainly John would understand. It was his fault to begin with. He was the initial reason why Sherlock sought Victor in the first place. The rest just had to happen to clear Sherlock’s mind.
“Well then, we should finish off the paperwork back at the yard, rather than waiting for Sherlock to be in a suitable mood later on.” Sherlock threw a sharp glare at Lestrade, but the other man just shrugged. John simply hovered around the detective and peppered Sherlock’s deductions with praise. He was utterly impressed with not only Sherlock’s spitfire deductions, but his ability to pretend that everything was perfectly fine as if his body was not covered in plum-colored bruises and lacerations. John tried not to think so much about every single cut he had to treat. Sherlock could easily read John’s face and the thoughts going on behind it, so John kept his thoughts on that beautifully quirked mouth and correcting his irritable mood.
“It had to be done while you were at work. I couldn’t have you around to see me sort through it all. Entering my mind palace was becoming riskier, and the longer I let it go, the worse it got.”
“That’s true. He was a bad cabbie. Should have seen the route he took us to get here!” John giggled. Sherlock smiled. The doctor seemed ten years younger, lamplights glinting off his eyes.
“I don’t know when. I would hate to ask Molly for advice on such a matter considering she has not been in a successful relationship since I have known her-”
Plenty of thoughts crossed John’s mind, but only one stood out in that instant. He put down his cup on the table riddled with lab equipment and approached the consulting detective. Sherlock cupped his drink with two hands. Despite their significant height difference, Sherlock gazed straight into John’s blue eyes. John held himself up well.
“God, Sherlock!” Sherlock leaned away from John’s sudden anger. John fisted the duvet with his eyes squeezed shut. “It’s not that bloody hard to understand! I never bother you when you want to spend hours in your head. Why can’t you do the same for me?” Sherlock blinked hard once, unsure if he was imagining John’s irritation. He didn’t remember walking into his mind palace.
“Well, if you’re not a mind reader, I don’t want to willingly divulge the dark secrets of my mind to some everyman.”
John was speaking the truth. It was an odd feeling. He only felt better when Sherlock was around, especially now that he could keep a close eye on the man. Sherlock, on the other hand, found it hard to believe that John was going to be here for him through and through. No one ever stayed with Sherlock. No one ever considered how Sherlock might feel when they called him a “machine” or a “freak” or an “addict.” It was weird to see another human other than Mrs. Hudson in his flat, especially one so boldly genuine. He had gotten used to being alone, and frequently enjoyed it. He had no friends or anyone of the sort to bond with or whatever. He didn’t mind it really.
The words sank into the core of him, into John’s bones, and he breathed out in unspeakable relief as he gazed into those amazing eyes. But it was his turn again now.
in what he was getting a sense was its best position for defensive mode; diagonal, blade up, weight down. Sh’lok immediately went for him with another roundhouse swing at his head. As John danced back out of range of it, Sh’lok kept coming and followed up with another swing at John’s lower abdomen, one that would have opened him up like a gutted fish had he not hastily jumped back and away, almost onto the central dais. Sh’lok kept swinging at John, forcing him back onto the little steps up,
The image summoned the sensation, and John could feel it already. Parts of him immediately went even stiffer than they already were at the very thought. In haste he added,
“Don’t think there will be, Captain,” Mr. Garrideb said. “The facility supervisor’s turned in for the night, but their night comms officer told me at shift change that Chief Vanderberg said to let us have anything we wanted, no questions.”
John shook his head, turning away toward Sh’lok. “It doesn’t make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported here. Our sensors didn't pick up anything that didn't belong on this planet.”
And then he straightened up into the great high-vaulted space at the end of it, and did as he’d been asked: walked carefully, watching where he put his feet.
“I shall make that decision. Since your return from the planet, you've behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner. And while I am almost certain I know why… I have questions.”
He had been expecting it. The message’s arrival meant that, along with the clock that was already counting down inside his head—for Sh’lok had seen the analysis of that very peculiar Transport, and had had time to run some calculations on the way the field densities in local space were changing—another one was now added.
“Fascinating though all that may be, Sh’lok,” John said, “we really don’t have time for it right now.”
“Oh, Sh’lok, do keep up!” Both the Vulcan’s eyebrows went up at that, in slightly scandalised surprise but also a little amusement. “Without your
Sh’lok took a breath but didn’t move away, not so much as a millimeter. When he managed to speak, his voice was husky with longing too, yet also abashed. “I am afraid I may have…” He paused, as if for the most embarrassing admission he could possibly make. “…Insufficient expertise for this.”
Except for the targeting, this was something John had heard from his First Officer, or gathered from him, before. What some people who knew no better would construe as a shocking lack of ambition, in Sh’lok’s case simply manifested itself as a certainty that he was already in the place where he felt sure he could do his best service, and he was content with that. “Logical, as always, Mr. Sh'lok.”
There was little light here, just a red-golden dimness that it took the eyes of his mind a few moments to get used to. By that faint light John could start to make out more and more of the glitter of great heaps and piles of gold and gems all around him, shorthand for someone’s mental treasures—the gathered data of a lifetime, every “jewel” and “coin” analysed and assessed and classified by the hoard’s careful curator.
Lestrade shook his head. “I said, Please don’t tell Sh’lok that I said he was the best first officer in the Fleet.”
“The miners must have broken into the hatchery.” John said. “Their operations destroyed thousands of them.” He looked over toward the Horta. “No wonder…”
Immediately his thought went back to the very little man in the very big ship from the First Federation. But now John found himself wondering
The next stop after acquiring a small collecting container was the Transporter room, and everything would have gone quite smoothly from Sh’lok’s point of view had Mrs. Hudson not been there, in company with one of the other Transporter techs, busily recalibrating the console.
John knew that when they made their way back up to the primary hull the corridors would be fairly quiet, though by no means empty. While ship’s evening was well along, and the corridor lighting had already dimmed down in accordance with the ship’s circadian programming, second shift was still a couple of hours from signing off to third. There would be a fair number of people about, including those who were off shift and relaxing for the evening.
Mrs. Hudson didn’t look entirely happy about that… but John was having another hunch, based on the idea that the presence of a female officer in this situation might somehow complicate matters. “Very well, sir,” she said. “And John…”
Clara cried. And then she was screaming again, terrible rough-throated cries of anguish that were ripped from her again and again. John looked up in distress at the vital signs indicator above the bed. All the indicators were veering upward toward their redline levels.
, John thought, standing there gasping, gripping the weapon two-handed and staring through the hole,
“Oh my God,”  John murmured as he stood there looking up and down the bed. It was simply a wreck, the pillow and outer bedclothes liberally smeared and spattered with the DNA of two species in various modalities. “
The outer door slid open, then the inner one. John stepped through, paused just inside the doorway to tap the closing code into the interior panel, and waited until the doors both slid shut and both sets of seals, the physical airtight ones and the nonphysical forcefield seals, went tight or phased in. After a few moments the light above the door went green, casting a faint radiance around. Everything else around him lay dark.
At that Lestrade threw a look at John that made his heart lift a little: the first expression he’d seen on Lestrade in many minutes that looked anything like normal. “I'll never live this down,” Lestrade muttered. “This Vulcan is telling
There was a pause before any answer became apparent through the sweet dark union that had begun welling up between them as the mindmeld fully established. But finally all that shared space throbbed with one word, one thought:
The kiss was becoming uncomfortably sweet when the intercom whistled. John let go of Mary and gestured in an apologetic way with the glass. He took it back to his desk, sat down.
“It seems logical, Captain,” Sh’lok said. “The Horta has a very logical mind. And after close association with humans—” and for John at least there was no missing the momentary glance Sh’lok shot at Lestrade— “I find that curiously refreshing.”
imagery flooded over him again, especially the being-pierced and ensheathing bits. Even if he’d never done that before, he’d have been more than ready for it now.
The lighting in Sh’lok’s quarters—the rooms’ environmental system having dimmed it down, as no members of any species needing brighter lighting had been present—came up again slowly as that condition changed.
John stood up and went over to where Lestrade was standing by Sh’lok’s station. “That Denevan ship headed
“Captain,” Mrs. Hudson said then, getting up from the viewer on the other side of the room, where she’d been examining some schematics. “I can do it.” And she looked exceptionally pleased with herself.
“Oh really,” John said. “Well, I think we should look into that.” He stretched, pulling Sh’lok down with him, still stroking the one softly flushed ear. “Being very careful to do it by the book, of course…”
Outside Sickbay they were saluted again, and John returned it and went quickly in while hoping he didn’t look as rattled as he felt. There was no relief, though, as the door closed behind them. Sickbay was just as the Transporter room had been: familiar but subtly wrong.
It wasn’t as if he was actually expecting an answer—but nevertheless he got one. John lifted his phaser again as the creature moved. But it came no closer—merely turned to show him its far side.
place an emptiness, reaching for the other and not finding him anywhere. As he stood still with (for the moment) just time enough to consider it, that space ached with its own emptiness, clenched like a closed fist around…
Eyes still closed, face still pressed against the pillow, John Watson had to smile: even though there was the faintest touch of sadness about the smile, even though he knew the other would feel/hear it. Even though that word had become (John suspected) Sh’lok’s favorite one in the whole Vulcan language, he was still slightly uncertain about saying it.
John’s insides clenched as Sh’lok braced himself against the desk, staring away from them across the room. “I am also,” he said, almost conversationally, “quite blind.”
him or one of his people. He spun in place, knocked the phaser out of Sh’lok’s grip, and punched him in the jaw.
on it! So you can take advantage of his homecoming tantrum to mess up the official version of the data and stash the genuine article away safe for your own later analysis. Oh, and don’t forget to destroy the analyses we did under voicelock—the lock won’t prevent you from just deleting them. Might be smart to make it look like we did that ourselves to keep the results from being reproduced. We’ll be your scapegoats.” John grinned.
and put an end to the unease and uncertainty at last! And though his enemy rallied briefly after being tripped and brought down, it wasn’t enough, not anywhere
“Additional data…” that dark voice said, dropping even lower, “is always desirable for optimal results. And most valuable when acquired first-hand...”
The Sickbay doors opened for him. John hurried in and then stopped, trying to process what he was seeing.
John bit his lip to keep from snorting with laughter. Lestrade, meanwhile, simply looked vaguely disappointed. “'Tis a pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty, Mr. Sh'lok.“
John swallowed again, his mouth dry. In the meantime he was leaning there staring at a shut door in a way not at all suggestive of a starship captain operating in the usual manner.
“That’ll hold him for about six hours,” Lestrade said softly as they deposited him inside the door, off to one side and out of sight.
Abruptly he found he couldn’t move a muscle, not even his eyes; couldn’t look away from the terrifying intensity of the expression on Sh’lok’s face, moving closer and closer to his. And something else was moving closer too, something dreadful, concentrated on Greg with horrifying single-mindedness… encroaching on him, invading him, inexorably pushing his thoughts, his mind, up against the far walls of his being as his body was pushed up against the wall. Both outside and inside him, a voice that had been familiar but was now simply frightening was saying, “Our minds are merging, Doctor. Our minds are
Lestrade looked down at him with a calm that John wished he felt. “What is there to understand, Mr. Sh’lok?”
“There’s no other way, Bones,” John said. “We have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the Denevan declared himself freed.”
Sh’lok leaned against the door’s broad edge next to him, looking out past John at the slow stream of stars falling away behind them. “A remarkable vista,” he said.
John’s gaze flicked up to the K3 indicator on the diagnostic panel. Quickly and steadily it soared up to the top of the slider and held there.
But despite the fascination, despite the wonder, John was tiring out. His hands were bruised and stinging with digging through piles of coined gold and silver, his senses were beginning to be overtaxed by the constant inrush of data, especially the references to Vulcan things, or alien things, for which he had no context—and he started to wonder if the ticking clock that he had been living with for nearly a day now was ticking for him too.
Behind T’Eyreen came another woman, taller and more strongly and lithely built, in silver tunic over black like the livery of the footmen or guards or whatever they were. She had long red hair that caught even more of the hot red light of the sky in its looped-up coils, along with large eyes, high cheekbones and a pretty rosebud of a mouth. But her expression was set grim, and as she went by she threw Sh’lok a glance that, Vulcan-originated or not, was clearly of the
He threw a glance over at the spectators: T’Eyreen and her would-be partner standing, trying to look impassive—but there was that glint in T’Eyreen’s eyes, that unhealthy excitement. The thought flashed across his mind:
He had been so sure, as they stepped through the ancient redstone portals of the Place, that he would be able to keep enough of a grip on his rebellious transport to retain some modicum of dignity through the ordeal that was to come. Even after the way his body had betrayed him on
John had been in the center seat for most of those fifteen hours. Under more normal circumstances he would have been in and out of it a dozen times or more; under even less normal circumstances he would at least have felt comfortable squirming and complaining to the Bridge crew about the deficiencies in the padding and the ongoing indignities being inflicted on his arse.
why. But John had been learning that this was one of Sh’lok’s quirks. Sometimes from uncertainty, sometimes from what looked like a secret pleasure in others’ reactions, he would do everything he could to present a theory in its entirety rather than in half-assembled scraps.
“There is none in the areas where the suspect killings took place,” Sh’lok said. “Which might have influenced their choice for that purpose. The whole complex is under-surveilled due to the huge number and complexity of the tunnels. Management only places monitoring equipment in the drifts and adits where work is presently ongoing. They haven’t resources enough to do otherwise.”
Sherlock Holmes was beautiful in every sense of the word. John’s chest swelled with heat when he gazed on that face. He could tell the man was brilliant. He gave him a taste back at the hospital, but John could see it in the man’s stare and the way he scrutinized everything. There was an obvious clarity to him, one that John both admired and feared. He would hate to be the subject of those eyes.
John had no idea he would be standing there, watching Sherlock’s fingers tremble with a capsule pinched between them. He had no idea that he would pull the trigger on his Sig at the cabbie that was threatening Sherlock. He had no idea that he would be so smitten with the git in the dark greatcoat so suddenly. John hurried out of Roland-Kerr College. The last thing he needed was to get arrested.
“Let’s get you something warm to put on.” John opened the drawer for Sherlock. The taller man peered in with a small smile and reached for the light beige jumper tucked under two others. He clutched it against his chest desperately and leaned into John’s shoulder. John rested his palm on the other man’s cheek, a tear rolling between his fingers. John pulled away to look at Sherlock as tears silently ran down his cheek.
John stood there with his mouth agape. “Afghanistan,” he stuttered. “That-” Sherlock awaited the usual insults like “freak,” but they never came.
The memory of that moment struck Sherlock in the solar plexus, and he turned away when the lack of air in the room became too suffocating. John was so cross with him as he sat there, waiting for the final battle with Moriarty. John didn’t know what he had planned then, and if he had to feign being the machine he and so many other people thought he was, then so be it. It wouldn’t be the first time that Sherlock had to put aside parts of himself to save his own image. Staring at the opposite wall from him, Sherlock realized that he would do it again and again if it meant John and his loved ones would be safe. He had to take a second to regain his composure before he spoke to John again.
Sherlock smiled. “Yes, but this is much better.” Sherlock mouthed John’s neck as he worked at Sherlock’s buttons. When he slid the shirt from Sherlock’s pale shoulders, John stopped yet again.
John shook his head. The world swirled around his head. Sherlock’s form was dark and blurry through the tears threatening to spill over. “No. Don’t.”
“Either way, rest up, and tell me how you feel in the morning, ya?” John hummed noncommittedly. Lestrade said his farewells and escaped the flat before he could find himself in the middle of something. Sherlock wasn’t home, which was not too odd, but since he had just deposited a stack of solved cases at the Yard, Lestrade figured Sherlock would be sitting upside-down in his chair or setting something on fire in the kitchen. He also hoped Sherlock wasn’t out getting shot at without him.
“Oh, shit. I’m sorry,” John was saying, through the haze of his embarrassment. “I forgot to take the lid off for you. Shit. I’m sorry, mate. I’m an idiot.”
“I’d like a stick,” he told John. “My grandfather had one, you know. A walking stick. Very grand. It was ma - mahogany, I think.”
He took in the rest of himself. He couldn’t do anything about his face, but his clothes were… adequate. A button up and dress trousers; he refused to own jeans.
And since that was a direct order and Stamford was the only person he knew in this mess of humanity, he trailed after him into the kitchen, where an assortment of bottles opened, unopened and empty cluttered the countertops.
It could be an experiment, perhaps. Except, then he’d have to go to other parties to gather data, and it seemed a little premature to commit himself to that course of action just yet.
“Mike! Great party, mate!” He hopped down off the stool to initiate the kind of back slapping hug that seemed to be typical of young men in their age group.
. He was having fun. He liked standing in the kitchen with John. “I’m fine!” He drained the glass to prove it.
“I’m not drunk,” Sherlock said crossly, but he accepted the glass of water John pushed into his hands. He hadn’t noticed the tap running or John even moving away, so he might have to revise that statement.
It went on that way until John couldn’t bear it any more; he just had to be kissing Sh’lok again. Sh’lok felt his urgency and let John slide out, licking his cock all over as he did, gasping with his desire. Moments later they were lying on their sides together, arms wrapped fiercely tight around each other, and John fastened his mouth on Sh’lok’s, plunging his tongue into him, ravenous for him. Yet again he fell deep into the fascination of tasting himself on Sh’lok’s mouth while also tasting Sh’lok tasting
she was helping, but because she had her own version of the Work and served it conscientiously. Yes, her personal reactions sometimes interfered, usually because either his physical appearance or his mental acuity affected her emotionally, but after all even John—
John looked over his shoulder at T’Kait, considering. “Do not interfere, Watson,” S’kroft immediately said, sharp-voiced. “Keep thy place.”
Which was more than true enough, on many other battlefields, other places of challenge where the bond between them had been affirmed again and again.
They both raised their goggles to their eyes. The doctor swallowed and turned toward the console… then threw the switch.
John had had a few occasions in his life that would have served as dictionary definitions for the phrase “don’t know whether to laugh or cry.” Standing here in a state of the art science lab next to his First Officer, and jointly observing a malignant civilisation-killing single-celled Thing From Elsewhere while exchanging I-don’t-understand-your-weird-alien-idiom banter, would never have occurred to him as a possible candidate. All John could find to say was “One hour, Mr. Sh’lok.” Then he took himself away.
He stood, and she started toward him, an almost involuntary movement. Sh’lok held up a hand to stop her. “It would be illogical for us,” he said quietly, “to protest against our natures. Don't you think?”
Then out of nowhere John had his own moment of uncertainty. What if the bald assertion was giving Sh’lok second thoughts? John swallowed. He had to be sure.
“Captain,” Sh’lok said, urgent, “lock me away. I do not wish to be seen. I c-cannot—no Vulcan could explain further!”
Those silver eyes locked on his with what looked like complete matter-of-factness; then glanced at Lestrade.
John thought as he leaned on the desk. Nonetheless he made sure he didn’t show the slightest sign of concern in front of these two. “Relay it, Lieutenant.”
Lestrade’s eyes widened a bit. For the moment John refused to meet them again. “Come on, Bones,” he said. “We’ve got to get down there and find out what’s going on.” He glanced over at Sh’lok’s station. “Mr. Sh’lok, assemble a landing party. Armed.”
He killed the contact and looked out at the network of glowing satellites, wishing with all his heart that the universe was fair.
“But we are on course for Vulcan, Captain,” Bradstreet said. “As Mr. Sh’lok ordered.” He looked actively confused now, as there would be normally be no way that John wouldn’t know about that… the assumption being that the order was originally his.
“For just a moment,” Sh’lok said, very low, “I couldn’t believe it. Despite all the evidence to the contrary. Despite— There’s no
John paused in the middle of the hall to let him join him. “I am pleased that you frustrated Mr. Bradstreet's plan. I should regret your death.”
think, he found himself going over the same ground again and again… wondering at the fierce and unfailing kindness of the man who was willingly risking so much for his sake, and desperately trying to think of ways to limit the damage that man would shortly incur. For even if the
The door wasn’t locked, but braced closed from the inside. John and Lanier shouldered it open, and the landing party rushed in. John’s first glimpse was of a dark-haired woman casually dressed in a green jumpsuit and soft boots, struggling to hold something flat up against one of the lab’s ventilation ducts. For the moment John barely saw, and didn’t at all observe, the bodies lying on the floor off to one side of the room. All his attention was on Clara, for it was she, who at the sight of the landing party dropped the flat board or card she’d been struggling with. She lurched into the centre of the room and stood there, clutching her head with both hands and shrieking, “They're here! They're
Fortunately, Stamford’s flat wasn’t too far from his own, in a redbrick row of Victorian terraced houses. The front door was open, so he let himself in and climbed the stairs, following the sound of music and voices to the second floor.
For some reason, that made Sherlock giggle. He had a sudden mental image of himself, striding through foggy streets in a top hat and tailcoat, swinging a silver-handled cane like something out of a Maurice Leblanc novel.
He should have brought a coat. If only he had a coat. A nice thick one. Perhaps he should have spent some of last month’s allowance on one, rather than the extra slides? Ridiculous. One can never have too many slides.
He stared for another long moment into the mirror, then turned away with a huff, shoving his phone, wallet and keys into his pocket and strode out of the door.
He was not nervous. Only an idiot would be nervous. There was nothing to be nervous about. It was just a gathering. Of people. Students. In a flat. A party. A house party. Nothing to be nervous about at all. Preposterous.
“Thank god for that,” he told the wall. “Christ, what kind of doctor am I, eh? Going around knocking people’s teeth out.”
“Interested in poisons?” John finished for him kindly. “Is that how you know Mike? He’s taking a chem unit, if I remember rightly. Something to do with forensics, I think?”
He wetted his fingers and tried to slick his hair down. For a few exhilarating seconds the water heroically held his hair in place, before the curls escaped gravity once more.
He was distracted by John knocking his own bottle against Sherlock’s so they clinked together loudly.
There was a young man there, blond, maybe a few years older than Sherlock and perched on one of the bar stools, apparently building a pyramid out of paper cups. He stopped what he was doing, though, to grin at Stamford.
He also made a big show of taking the bottle and removing the cap with great ceremony before handing it back with a flourish. The whole time he was smiling warmly, invitingly, like they were sharing a joke about his ridiculousness. So, of course, Sherlock couldn’t help smiling back, face warm and chest oddly tight, like his organs were too big for the cavity. Which was a ridiculous sensation, from a scientific point of view.
Sherlock’s forehead wrinkled as he pondered. He knew the answer, but his mind couldn’t quite reach it. He took another swig from his bottle to see if that would help. It didn’t, but the conundrum seemed to matter less, so maybe it did, after all.
It was a confusing mass of music, lights flashing and bodies moving, some dancing, some laughing, drinking or engaging in amorous activities. Some more than amorous, or less than, depending on one’s point of view. In short, too much data. How could anyone make sense of it, much less enjoy it?
Bloody Mycroft. He clearly assumed Sherlock would hate university, like he’d hated school; that he’d be miserable.
“I meant alcohol. But yeah, while we’re on the subject.” He tapped the glass insistently. “Drink that. Then I’ll call you a taxi.”
John simply nodded, as if that weren’t the greatest admission of failure in Sherlock’s life, most of his attention apparently on rummaging around in the forest of bottles on the counter. He made a triumphant noise, fishing out a bottle opener from somewhere, then turned back to Sherlock.
He flattened his hair, which was an exercise in futility, since it always just sprang up again, but he did it anyway and watched the inevitable result in the mirror.
“So!” John said abruptly, swivelling away from Sherlock and towards Stamford. “What are you  drinking, gents?”
He lifted his beer to his lips again, but the bottle was empty. He frowned at it, then frowned harder when a hand took it away.
“It’s fine,” he managed to say, then wanted to kick himself, because did that sound like he’d just agreed with John?
a boyfriend, but that didn’t mean he never wanted to try having one. The idea had some appeal, especially with John’s shoulder pressed against his. But it seemed too complicated to explain in that moment, and maybe it wasn’t something you said to a person you’d just met.
He took a moment, trying to remember if he’d eaten yesterday either. It took a surprising amount of concentration, so he almost missed John nudging him in a fond, chiding manner.
“Ah, yes. We’ve been studying chemical effects on the rate of decomposition. It’s quite fascinating, really, even if the professor
But university was going to be different. At university there would be like-minded people. He was going to have fun and make friends. He was going to this party.
John stared at him, and Sherlock realized with a sinking feeling that he’d been talking about alcohol.
He swallowed and, as usual, his Adam’s apple looked huge and his face looked too thin and pale and his hair was just a disaster.
He almost immediately regretted it as, oh god, this was a party, not a business meeting, but John was still smiling, eyes twinkling, and he took Sherlock’s hand, giving it a shake that was firm without being aggressive.
“Dinner! Let’s get dinner! Are you hungry?” The food would soothe John’s concern, and eating was something they could do together. Isn’t that what people did? John didn’t have to go.
John tipped his bottle in acknowledgement. “I used to go out with a girl in the Classics department. You can’t fool me!”
Was it too formal? What did people even wear at parties? But he’d been reliably informed that they’d probably be too wasted to care about his clothes or his hair, so he’s being ridiculous. The whole thing was ridiculous.
“Right!” Stamford announced, when it was clear he had nothing else to contribute. “A drink! Let me get you a drink. Follow me!”
“So,” John said eventually, “Do you, you know, have a girlfriend?” He was looking away as he said it, apparently fairly disinterested in the answer, but Sherlock flushed anyway and frowned at the question.
But John had asked and was still patiently waiting for a reply, so Sherlock forced himself to say: “I don’t know.”
His throat, Sherlock saw, was a long strong line, Adam's apple completely proportional, skin mostly smooth, though there was a hint of a shadow around his jaw where there’d be stubble later. He wondered what it would be like to touch that skin. It would probably be rough.
Frozen, he almost missed Stamford opening his mouth to make introductions, and in that instant decided to beat him to the punch. Confidence was appealing, wasn’t it? So he stuck out his hand and said:
. The shock of it brought tears of pain to his eyes, and for a second he had no idea what had happened.
Yes, he did. He eyed his laptop balefully, the recipient of Mycroft’s last message, full of simpering hope that he wasn’t finding university
“So what do you want to do with that, then?” John asked. He was looking at Sherlock with open, friendly interest, but the words still made something shrivel up and die inside him. He
been listening, of course, but Stamford had seen him and, being the overly friendly person he was, hadn’t hesitated to invite Sherlock.
For a breathless second, John just stared at him assessingly. Then he grinned and something fluttered in Sherlock’s stomach.
“Sherlock?” John was looking at him again, always smiling. Unusual. Most people were put off within moments of meeting Sherlock.
, what are you drinking, but since you were too busy making philosophy jokes, I suppose you’ll just have to have whatever I give you.”
Gathering the rest of his courage, he pressed on, somewhat literally, as he had to shove his way past two hulking rugby players standing very inconsiderately just inside the door.
Yet, clearly they did, as at that moment he heard a welcoming cry of “Sherlock!” cutting through the hubbub.
“Vodka and coke for me!” Stamford replied brightly. “Don’t worry, I can sort it myself.” And he pottered off to do just that.
John barked with laughter. “We are! Do as I say, not as I do. Now,” he nudged Sherlock with his shoulder in a friendly way. “What’s your poison?”
They didn’t say anything for a while, quietly sipping their drinks until Sherlock felt warm and relaxed, the anxious-eager tension from before dissipating. It might have been the alcohol. Or perhaps it was just John. There was something undemanding about him that absorbed Sherlock’s excess everything.
have happened, John kept being assailed by delicious images of what might occur within the next hour or so, to the point where a couple of times he lost his thread and had to start one piece or another of the explanation all over again. And worse, Sh’lok
Not far from him, though, at the far side of the cavern things came down— one of the rough pillars that had supported that side of the low roof, toppling sideways and dislodging more chunks of rock from the walls nearby as it fell. Stones and rubble crashed and scattered deafeningly all around. Dust flew up in clouds.
John had helped Bradstreet pull together all the equipment and supplies that Lestrade required. He was glad enough to be relegated to fetch-and-carry duties, putting together the makeshift operating table on which they laid out Sh’lok’s body. He had been in a room down the hall fetching a set of what Lestrade told him were surgical instruments, but all of which looked to John like simple shining metal rods of various thicknesses, all of them otherwise indistinguishable one from the other. By the time he came back in, Lestrade had already done the thing that John both desperately wanted to have happened but did not want to see: the removal of Sh’lok’s brain from its housing inside the central console. It was irrational, but John felt as if seeing this would violate Sh’lok’s privacy in some way… and his Vulcan had, John thought, already had more than enough of that for one day.
But that was ridiculous. John forced himself to look up again… and to his great surprise, found Sh’lok doing the same.
John went warm all over. Yet at the same time, even the best-intentioned loyalty had its price, and more than one of them was liable to wind up paying it. “Mr. Sh’lok,” John said, for having been reminded he was Sh’lok’s Captain, it was now time to act the part. “At this moment in time, an outside observer would find all this dangerously subjective. And Earth-based authorities still have a blind spot, stupid though that may be, as regards evidence obtained through telepathic or similar means.”
to be there, at having won the right to give himself over. With every single stroke John could feel how very much Sh’lok had wanted this—to
The woman in purple gave John the kind of look one sees from a corporate customer representative in the act of bringing to mind some obscure item buried far back in a stockroom on some other planet. “Ah, yes,
Then John realised Donovan had paused just this side of the doorway and was looking at him in some distress, as if reluctant to speak.
“And as for the connection between, uh, well, humans would say ‘body and soul’…” John stopped, as the feeling crept over him that he was venturing into deep water.
Sh’lok sat back in his chair and eyed the board, his arms folded. “The Ancients were themselves originally humanoid, and at a late point in their development hit on this method to artificially prolong their lives. A popular enough tactic, one we’ve seen elsewhere: discard the body, keep the brain, live many times longer than otherwise possible when one must also divert resources and attention to keeping the transport alive as well.”
For his mother had told him that there always had to be a door like that in a scenario of this kind. And now that he had something of sufficient importance to keep in there, Sh’lok understood.
“Don’t let them!” Clara moaned, as much in terror now as in pain. And a full-throated cry of fear, now: “Don’t let them!
John was in a state somewhere between constant anxiety and the constant sense of it almost being ready to be relieved, so that whenever he checked the time it either seemed hardly any had gone by, or much more of it had passed than he;d expected. At one point, which turned out to be about an hour in from the time Lestrade had started, Bradstreet looked over at John and shook his head in wonder. “I’ve never seen anything like it, Captain,” he said. “It’s like he’s operating at warp speed!”
When normal respiration patterns resumed again, John sighed. At least there hadn’t been any messages from Lestrade. That meant whatever had come of Sh’lok’s exam, it wasn’t anything that had merited the Captain’s immediate attention.
