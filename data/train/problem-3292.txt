Dean pressed a hand to his chest. “I’m wounded, Cas. You don’t remember?”
Sam and Eileen returned with burgers and fries, and Cas pulled out the PB&J sandwich they’d packed for Jack. Jack was too distracted to sit still and eat, instead going from playing in the sand to taking a bite, to stealing fries from them, to playing in the sand again.
But for now, he emptied his pockets. Stacked the assortment of stones and pebbles and one Leviathan tooth into an unsteady pile. Watched it grow under his hands. Each object, a moment in time.
“Woah, kid, you outdid yourself,” Dean said, taking it from him. Three stick figures, each a bit taller than the next. Two with wings, one in a blocky shirt which looked suspiciously like flannel.
“You’re bleeding.” Going to his side, Dean grabbed his arm, made him face him. Blood trickled down the vampire’s neck, his right ear mangled.
Perhaps if he tried hard enough, he could forget they were in Purgatory and pretend he was in one of those ancient forests he used to visit thousands of years ago. After violent battles, tired of angelic arguments, he’d fly until he was surrounded by miles and miles of trees, miles and miles more of roots underneath his feet. No threats.
“I don’t know!” the werewolf growled, though the sound came out more strained than menacing. “One day, two, that way. A long ridge, can’t miss it.” He started to lift his maimed hand, as if to point, then whimpered and gestured with his other hand to the right.
“Hey!” Dean exclaimed. Castiel started for Benny, but Dean grabbed his arm and yanked him around. “Don’t.”
And instantly burst out laughing.
“That’s what children do,” Cas said, and Dean rolled his eyes.
“No way!” She hit him on the arm. “Thought driving was in your blood. What made you decide to quit?”
Did Dean feel the same way as Benny? Did part of him recoil being close to Castiel? No matter what Castiel did, no matter what he said, he couldn’t fix things between them, only made things worse. All his faux-righteous anger against Benny, all his arguments—all just excuses, his attempts to ignore the truth: a vampire was a better companion for Dean than him.
Joni Mitchell plays on the outdoor speaker and Cas pats dirt around a lavender plant, cool and smooth under his fingertips. Leaning back, he admires the way the purple flowers fill the space between his caladiums and lamb’s ear.
“Not from me.” He huffed a strained laugh, eyeing Benny and Castiel. “But you got another thing coming if you think you can just saunter through. Soon as you get close, you’ll get swarmed. No one escapes from here.”
“We should get going.”
His eyes met Dean’s. Well. There had been more to it than that, hadn’t there? Only Dean could have appealed to him and changed his allegiances in the moment. Intent gaze, telling him,
Dean laughed. “Always go to my truck anyway. Yours is too crowded with the fucking plants.” A chair creaked. “How long’s it been? That we’ve been doing this, that we’ve known each other?”
“Don’t call me that,” Castiel shot back.
He supposed the idea wasn't so strange—he realized hooking up with Cas for seven years sounded pretty serious. And the idea of actually having some kind of relationship with Cas didn’t seem as absurd as it should. Maybe because they’d been friends for years now; maybe because they got along so well. Or maybe because it was Cas. Something told him he’d never have anything like this again with someone else. Not like with Cas.
“Put the gun away, you don’t have to kill anyone. According to a book I found, as long as Zara agrees to call the engagement off before the wedding begins, Cas isn’t tied to her.” He gestured to the book shelves. “You know, this isn’t such a bad thing, them being here. We've never actually gotten to talk to any Djinn before, and the Men of Letters don’t have much information on them. Now we can actually talk to them.”
“Nice work,” Dad said, taking the paper, but instead of the usual warmth from his praise, Dean only felt sick.
“I’m sure I would,” Cas said, and Dean’s heart sunk. “But Heaven hasn’t been my home in a long time. This is my home now.”
“You know if him and Meg have a thing?”
Dean resisted rolling his eyes.
Benny shook his head, watching Dean. “Putting a lot of trust in you, brother.”
(And a horrible coping method, according to Sam and Cas)
“No,” Cas said quickly. “Dean, no. I’m not gonna keep you from doing what you wanna do.”
He watched Cas, Sam, and Eileen for a moment longer, then made his decision.
“Exciting day,” Dean commented.
“What? Really?”
Busy diners where their food took ages to come to their table and Dean doodled on napkins to pass the time. Stuffed them into his pocket and forgot until he pulled them out while looking for change to pay for gas. A tiny Impala, a sun with dashes for rays, sigils, tiny flowers which Cas had added to the corners.
It wasn’t settled, but Castiel didn’t have the heart to press the issue. He stood, silently, and watched Dean turn away, pull his eyes to the water.
Dean started to nod, say
“Join the club!”
Cas coughed, waving flour away from his face and Jack cackled, one palm dusted white. Dean laughed at Cas, until Jack leaned over and swiped at his t-shirt.
“What? How? I’ll grab guns—”
A warning voice in the back of his mind told him Benny was goading him, but he ignored it for the instant gratification of a comeback. “I have no possible relation to your siblings’ offspring.”
“What’s your favorite? Mine is the bon-ta-sore-us.” He sounded out the word carefully.
Jack pouted, crossing his arms, and Dean tried, “You wanna go to the boardwalk?”
“Then I suppose you make it a practice to be intimate with monsters like him?” Knew it was a cruel thing to say, hinting not just at the blood drinking, but something else. The way Benny held him, kissed his cheek.
“Um, okay.” Sitting down next to him, Dean scooped soil out of the bag with a shovel and poured it carefully into the planting containers. Cas smoothed soil over the seeds he'd planted.
“I can still sleep here, right?” he asked as Castiel set an alarm.
“Wasn’t trying to. Just. The other angels hated you before, right? Can’t be much worse now.”
“Hey,” Dean said, after a pause. “You made it.”
Cas’ laugh came clear and bright over the phone and Dean grinned. “That seems counterproductive.”
“We’re being stupid,” Dean realized. Cas looked at him. “He’s fine. He’s doing great. We don’t have to worry, we just gotta let him do his thing.”
Castiel’s blade was in his hand without a conscious thought, and the vampire slowed to a stop and turned to face him, crossing his arms, not even bothering to lift his own weapon. Infuriating, his nonchalance.
Cas picked up his fork and Dean figured the best way to start was with the truth.
“Think it is, Cas.”
No monsters, only Dean pacing the shore. When he caught sight of Castiel, he rushed at him.
Castiel had stacked one stone onto the base he’d made, then another, and now he balanced a third. Tapped the base and watched them fall. Built them up again.
Prairie and forest, coast and desert. He'd traveled these roads before, but he was paying attention now. Everything looked different with Cas sitting by his side, when every glance to his right revealed Cas already looking at him.
“We’ve been invaded by the Djinn,” Dean said, and Sam’s eyes widened.
Dean nodded against his shoulder, then pressed a kiss to the crook of his neck, and Castiel’s face reddened. He hoped Dean wasn’t pitying him, didn’t think he was foolish for suggesting they turn their arrangement into more, for his shock at realizing it could end so soon.
But Dean was always saving him, fixing his mistakes. No longer.
“I’ll worry about them,” Dean said. “You worry about remembering where the portal is. How close is it from here?”
Dean recognized the determined look in Jack’s eyes; he’d seen it too many times in Cas’. "I dunno how to make one,” he tried as a last ditch effort to get out of this project.
Cas had been quiet the night before and into the morning, and Dean hated the way his quitting was tainting their time together, both continually thinking about it, he knew.
Another bolt of lightning, a sickening crack, the smell of burning wood. Dean was shivering, trying to hide it. Thrum of electricity in the air.
But maybe he hadn’t realized how distant, until now. Maybe that’s why, as Dean slept, his mind kept returning to two years ago, when Mary passed and Dean called him in the middle of the night to tell him.
Instinctive actions. Blade in his hand, slash outwards. Cut only air, Leviathan lunging backwards.
“Yeah, I know, but it’s not something I could control. Sorry.”
Sensing Dean didn’t want to talk about his quitting, Castiel didn’t bring it up again, and Dean seemed more than happy to do the same. They ate from the pizza box, TV playing in the background—it was indeed color, though after a minute of fiddling with the antenna, Castiel had given up trying to lose the static.
The werewolf drew his eyes back to him and smiled, sly. “Don’t remember.”
Benny winked at Dean. “Honed my natural instincts. Monster blood don’t smell as sweet as humans’, but it’s got a stench all the same. Didn’t take long for it to wake me up out of any slumber.”
The magic fingers bed at the King's Court Motel cost four quarters for fifteen minutes—three more than when he was younger, he griped to Cas. The vibrating massage didn't seem quite as relaxing as he remembered, but maybe he was just used to more magical fingers—this he accompanied with an exaggerated wink which made Cas roll his eyes.
he shut the book. Jack tried to pry it back open. “Again!”
“I want a Doc McStuffins pin,” he said, plunging his hand into the box.
Gripping Dean’s arm, he let his head fall back. Dean’s hardness pressed against his ass, and before the heat building in his gut grew too strong, he stopped Dean’s hand, said, “I want you to fuck me.”
He had to fix this.
Dean always said the wrong things. He pushed away an image of Cas’ hurt expression and carefully hung the rosary back up. He still had to drive to the drop yard to meet Bobby, he needed it a little longer.
“Okay,” Dean said, slowly, unsure if he was understanding this correctly. Cas looked a little guilty. “Care to elaborate, Cas?”
Dean deposited his bag in Cas’ room and they walked out back of the motel to where a park lay, walkways and grass, a shimmering pond in the middle. A few people walked along the paths: a woman pushing a stroller, an elderly couple taking slow, thoughtful steps.
“15.36,” Wren told them, dropping the pins into a bag.
“I guess.” Cracking open his own beer, he took a long drink, and Cas said,
Sliding over, Cas got underneath, and they laid side by side, pressed against each other. Their fingers brushed, and Dean crooked a finger around Cas’ thumb.
The crumpled motel receipt taunted him. Seemed a waste; seven years all reduced to this. Horrible ending.
Still, a stone sat heavy in his gut. It was Cas’ shock, that’s what had fazed him. Like Cas had thought this, their arrangement, would go on forever. Maybe Dean had thought that too.
Even more surprising, Dean didn’t react in anger or surprise, just grinned wider and stumbled a little as Benny stepped away.
“That wasn’t your fault—”
Castiel sighed. “Yeah, to ask for money.”
Castiel straightened, started to say goodbye, but Dean ended the call. He stared at the dark phone screen. Dean missed him.
“Don’t hurt him, I told you—”
Cas shot him a look and started explaining the situation to Sam. Shaking his head, Dean peeked out through the doorway to watch the Djinn pile their belongings on the map table, Zara giving instructions.
Dean looked up from untying his boots and Castiel continued, “I was talking to Tara, and, uh, she and Annie are team driving now. And it didn’t sound like such a bad idea. Splitting the driving, getting through jobs faster. And I thought, maybe we could do that. We could travel together, wouldn’t have to go weeks without seeing each other, that way.”
Dean kissed him back, then took his hand, tugged him to the hallway. Cas followed easily, smiling, and Dean couldn’t resist kissing him again along the way.
It was a gift almost too great.
“Not any reason, I didn’t mean anything, I just meant…” Castiel crossed his arms, tucking his hands into his armpits. “I’m surprised, that’s all.”
“Sounds good.” He was going to have to bring up his idea eventually. He’d almost asked Dean yesterday, but hadn’t wanted Dean possibly saying no to mess up their first night together in a long time.
Sometimes, while passing semi-trailer trucks on the freeway, when the setting sun glinted off the metal partition between west and east-headed traffic, he wondered what life would’ve been like if he knew Cas when he was twenty-six. When he was so lonely, his chest felt like a vise at night, and he slipped out of mildewed motel rooms to gasp in chilly night air. When he sought out crowded bars because accidental nudges and jostles were substitutes for caresses.
“The garden or me?” he asks, tilting his head back to see him under the brim.
the first one Castiel had seen snarled, its long, black tongue slithering out of its mouth, flicking the air. It took a step closer, and though his stomach turned, Castiel pushed his way past the small circle Dean and Benny had made to guard Dean from it.
When he remained silent, Cas continued, “I don’t want to let a good thing go to waste.” Then, as if Dean didn’t know, “This is a good thing.”
“Shut up,” Dean said, wiping at his eyes brusquely. They started for their cars, though he couldn’t help looking back. Third window on the righthand side, second floor. Jack’s classroom. He’d cased the school last week, learned the exits and entrances. Still, standing outside, he felt helpless.
His voice had turned serious, and Castiel tried to joke again, “Sounds alright by me.”
But then Dean finished, “But, uh, I think I’m gonna quit driving.”
“Shit,” Dean muttered under his breath, staring at his chest again. He felt like an idiot for taking so long to realize that he loved Cas too.
Dean nodded, flexing his hand. A gash ripped through his jacket, and he glanced at it. “Fine.”
“She’ll love that.” He could almost hear Charlie’s excitement now. Getting to his feet, he ruffled Jack’s hair. “You got a lot of lucky friends. Having you as a friend, I mean.”
an apology or not.
“Don’t you dare fucking leave,” Dean repeated, shaking him slightly. “You hear me?”
Turning around, Castiel felt the absence of Dean’s hands on him.
When he and Bobby hung up, he stayed sitting. Headlights swept through the cab’s front windshield, across the walls and ceiling.
Castiel looked up sharply. “I know why you’re standing so far away. Why you can’t look at me directly. I’m changed. What you see before you isn’t fully angel.”
Alright, maybe a little anxious.
Clouds of black smoke erupted in front of them and Dean stumbled back. Castiel drew his blade as the smoke cleared to reveal oozing forms transforming into two Leviathan.
He hadn’t meant to hurt him, far from it. But he’d panicked. Because he hadn’t known that was an option, that Cas could love him.
he thought hopefully.
“I want outta here,” Benny said. “And I’m tired of waiting. Start talking.”
Castiel looked up and tried to hide his smile. “Why, they all booked again?”
“How could you—” He glared at Benny, fingers gripping his blade. Benny had the audacity to smirk and Castiel took a step forward—
Unbidden, the thought rose in his head of having Cas over, getting a chance to really show him the place, show him Baby. In all the years they’d known each other, why hadn’t he ever invited Cas over for a simple visit, tried to spend their hometimes together?
Creaking of a log as someone sat. The slide of leaves and footsteps stilled. Castiel closed his eyes. A shapeshifter far off. A… Djinn. Directly ahead, miles off. How wide was this land? Did it extend in all directions forever? Was there an end?
“These are not just monsters, Dean. They're—” He suppressed a shudder. Gaping mouths, jagged teeth, black ooze. “They’re Leviathan. I have a price on my head, and I've been trying to stay one step ahead of them, to—to keep them away from you. That's why I ran.” Dean’s expression had hardened and he felt the weight of disapproval in his gaze. He slid his eyes away, to the rippling water. “Just leave me, please.”
“Asshole!” Jack agreed cheerfully from the backseat.
signs hung on motel doorknobs, winding backroads and detours. He grew out his hair and told Cas he needed a cut. Cas twisted his fingers through the strands, and mused, "I like it." Dean kept it and noticed the strands curled at the ends.
“Now we leave and don’t stalk the school,” Sam said. He grinned, looking at Dean. “Are you crying?”
Ducking his head now, Castiel studied the ground for a few paces before managing to collect his thoughts enough to ask, “And what about angels?”
“I got a few beers in the cooler,” Dean said. “‘Less you’re dead set on drinking warm beer in a craphole.”
“There’s an accident near Exit 187. Got caught in the middle of it.”
Cas, of course, knew what he was thinking. “I don’t think I even knew, really, what I felt back then.”
“I’m drawing us,” Jack told him, reaching for another crayon while keeping a hand shielding the drawing.
“Dean—” But Dean walked away, waving him off, and any words that might redeem himself died in his mouth.
“Swear, if he’s done anything stupid, or got himself hurt, I’m gonna kill him.”
“Oh. You a driver too?” Castiel nodded and the man stuck out his hand, “Noah.”
“Hold on!”
“Or never,” Dean said. “That’s always an option.”
“Is it a crime to make a pie at 2am? I had a craving.”
"For you to me are the only one," he sang over Robert Plant, glancing at Cas as he turned up the radio, wind whistling through the open windows, road humming under their feet.
“Let’s play eye spy,” Cas suggested.
“I let you win,” he said, shuddering a little when Dean bit lightly at his neck. He couldn't help hope that Dean would leave a mark. Dean laughed against his collarbone.
"No!" Jack yelled, trying to get out of his grip.
“How long have you known?” Dean started to answer, and Cas cut him off, “I mean, made your decision, not just talking about it like you always have.”
All he knew was that quitting meant change; what things would look like between him and Cas now, he didn’t know.
Dean huffed a laugh. “Go for it,” he said, gesturing to his neck. “Know you’re waiting.”
They’d been on their feet, on the move, nearly non-stop for the past several days, no time for anything other than traveling, sleeping, and killing, drinking. Not a complaint from Dean—clearly, this place had infected him with its intensity. For a moment, Castiel thought of John; no time for anything but revenge. Never a life he wanted for Dean, not one he thought Dean wanted for himself.
“We're never bringing you shopping again!”
she was not as lame as them.
Settling down on a wide tree stump, he carved Enochian sigils into the wood grain. No real purpose to them since angels and demons went to their own separate resting place when they died, not Purgatory. The monsters threatening them here could not be deterred by sigils and warding.
Again, unhelpful. But Castiel didn’t know why he was looking for answers from a vampire anyway. He followed them away from the werewolf corpse. He didn't know if he'd ever get through to Dean. Maybe he should stop trying and, if he couldn't give Dean what he wanted, at least let him believe what he wished.
“Been thinking about it for a while.” Dean opened the beer can. “We’ve talked about it.”
Fighting back the ridiculous bodily reaction taking over his vessel, heat flushing his skin, Castiel raised his head to scowl at Benny.
He gripped the steering wheel tighter and glared out at the road. Not a problem at all.
“Take as much time as you need.”
After completing his ritualistic circling around their makeshift camp, Benny came back to lay on his back, arms crossed behind his head, whistling softly. Dean shifted in his sleep, frown creasing his brows. Inner turmoil, perhaps a bad dream.
The employee’s expression turned shocked and Dean heard a few gasps from the parents that had crowded around to see the commotion. “I’m gonna have to ask you to leave,” the employee stammered. “This is a kid’s play area, we won’t tolerate fighting here.”
A float passed with people waving and dancing on top, a banner strung across the front declaring, “Protect Trans Kids.” Jack waved a rainbow flag around, cheering along with the crowd. Claire’s arm was wrapped around Kaia’s shoulders, a smile tugging at her mouth despite her attempts to look unbothered by the proceedings. Dean wished he could feel that nonchalant. Instead, he kept looking over his shoulder. He didn’t know exactly what threat he was looking for, but the press of the growing crowds and the heat and noise, the bright colors and waving flags everywhere he looked was making him nauseous.
“Right,” Dean said, an easy grin on his face.
didn’t get it. He pressed, “How many people have you killed—humans, I mean? How many hunters? How many widows and orphans have you made—”
“But it’ll work,” Dean spoke up. “Angels ain’t supposed to be here either, so they need a way out too.”
, he told himself, looking back up at the ceiling. Faint light came through the small window above their heads, blinds pulled down. Sure, he and Cas had been hooking up for years now, anytime their routes neared each other, but that was it. Not like Dean had to give him advance notice that their infrequent meetups would be ending soon. Probably better to tell him now, instead of calling him up weeks earlier and making it sound like a bigger deal than it was.
“Yeah, uh. Figured we’re friends, right?” Feeling his face heat, he ducked his head to take Cas’ hand and tie it around his wrist. “Just a weird thing people do.”
Several tries and several more mishaps later, and they had a few semi-recognizable pretzels. Some they dipped into a cinnamon sugar glaze that came with the kit, others they placed as is into small, pink, round dishes.
A scream ripped itself from his throat, both from the shock of experiencing physical pain and the fiery hot sear of the monster’s saliva against his skin.
“Makes you wish you weren’t human, huh?” Benny asked.
“How did you do that?” Cas asked, studying the box. Going to him, Dean did the same thing he’d did with Jack, standing behind him and holding his hands to help him form a pretzel shape. Cas' fingers were dusted with flour, and Dean got a bit distracted by the way Cas leaned back against him, letting him guide him into creating a pretty decent pretzel. Not as perfect as the ones on the box, but close enough.
“Yeah. If you don’t mind.”
“And yet you believe Benny, one of these ‘freaks’, will make it out.” He looked at Benny, studying his soul, before returning his gaze to Dean. “This place, the rules aren’t the same. Even Benny’s soul isn’t as warped as my true form, despite his transgressions. This portal, even if it allows Benny through, because he is part human, it will not let me through. Not when I’m still contaminated by Leviathan, the one thing this place is meant especially to hold and trap.”
“Thought you quit for good this time.”
Love made you wake gasping from nightmares, images of people you loved turned bloody and torn, seared into your eyelids. Love didn’t stop you from making mistakes. No matter how much he loved his brother, he couldn’t always save him. Love was a responsibility, a burden. Maybe his dad made it seem that way. Because Dean would spend sleepless nights saving strangers from the things that went bump in the night even if no one made him. Would care for Sam even if no one left him with fifty bucks and instructions to keep the kid safe.
Dean tugged his arm away, straightened away from Benny. “Cas, stop.” His eyes were a little unfocused, and pulling his glare from Benny, Castiel quickly scanned him, taking stock of his health. Too tired, too much blood loss.
Dean opened the oven, checking to see if it was working. Already pretty warm for a small bright pink appliance. “Woulda killed for something like this when I was younger.” He looked at the inside of his wrist. “Used to have a pretty nasty scar from when I tried making Sam brownies in some janky motel oven.”
Jack shrieked, pulling their attention, and Dean grimaced at a string of dark green seaweed that washed up near their feet. “Yucky,” Jack declared, taking a step back as another wave pushed it closer. He stared out at the people playing in the ocean, and Dean couldn’t help feel thankful Jack wasn’t old enough to join the older kids which splashed around gleefully. How the fuck were you supposed to keep track of your kid when they were hardly bigger than the waves around them?
It wasn’t true, Castiel told himself. What Dean needed was to be far, far away from him. “Dean…”
“Uh, yeah.” He walked to the TV and picked up the channel guide, stared at it though he wasn’t really seeing the words written on the glossy pages. “Um, I was thinking.” Better to just say it now. It wasn’t such an absurd thought, Dean might have even considered it before.
“Even if I had seen it, why would I tell you? Gonna kill me anyway.”
"That's for Cas, back off."
Gripping his blade hard enough to hurt his hand, Castiel scanned the land around them, ensuring there were no other monsters waiting in the brush to ambush them. Despite feeling his stomach turn at the sounds of Benny drinking from Dean’s arteries, he couldn’t resist looking back at them. Dean’s face had steeled itself into a practiced neutral expression, and Benny only drank from him for a few seconds before pulling away.
He could tell by the sound of Dean’s breathing that he was drifting off. Shutting his eyes, he tried to be happy for him. More accurately, he tried to stop pitying himself. Maybe Dean would change his mind; maybe he wouldn’t really quit. But the fact that he didn’t want to talk about it worried Castiel, worried him that Dean had decided to quit, to end this, a long time ago, had just never thought enough of him to tell him.
Castiel swallowed hard. “No, I—”
Dean had once told him,
And then the bakery: “We gotta have snacks when he comes home,” Dean told Cas, selecting a dozen donuts.
“Fuck,” he muttered, throwing open the fridge door to grab the butter.
“Just, they apparently don’t know it,” Dean pointed out. “Or we wouldn’t keep getting kicked out.”
"Not good," Cas finished. He squinted at his own pretzel, then took another hesitant bite. Instantly, his face screwed up, and he shook his head, dropping the pretzel onto the plate. “It seems you were right. Soy sauce, pepper, and raisins do not mix.”
Sitting down on the bed, Castiel pulled on a pair of socks. “I didn’t realize you had a warm meal. Were you cooking that in your truck?”
“Yeah. Weird.” He started for the library. “I think we have a few books on Djinn. I wonder how binding their engagements are.”
He had been trying very hard today to not think about the fact that this was Dean’s last drive. Or the fact that Dean hadn’t told him until now, until the last possible moment, really.
Cas nodded solemnly. “Maybe you should try again. Your sample size is too small to make an accurate conclusion.”
“Whipped,” Dean mouthed at him as Sam answered his phone, smiling at the screen and walking off down the hallway. “Well,” he told Cas, ”you look like shit.”
“Dean.”
Castiel, trembling, made his way up the rest of the rockface, crawled over the plateau where the portal had hung, suspended in the air. No power, no rushing air, no light as before. Just dirt and grass. He dug his fingers into the dry earth and choked back a sob rising up in his throat.
A hand on his elbow, trying to pull him upright. Felt the phantom burn in his throat, tasted the bitterness of the Leviathan bile. He stumbled and Dean wrapped an arm around his waist, pulled him away from the Leviathan bodies.
with; no worries, no cares. He knew a few drivers fairly well, had some friends back home, people he’d graduated high school with, but that was about it. Hard to maintain relationships when he was always on the road. The people he was closest to were his family, people who were always going to be there regardless of how long he was gone.
Cas lifted his hand in a wave and Dean managed to nod. He watched Cas pull back into the right lane after passing him, and his heart was oddly thumping. He didn’t believe in fate, and maybe it was just chance that crossed his and Cas’ paths, but looking back, it sure felt like fate.
Castiel stared at Dean. How, in the months they had been apart, had he changed so dramatically? To not only trust a vampire enough to travel with him, but to let him drink his own blood?
“Two years.”
A knock on his door sounded and he swore under his breath. “Go away, Sam,” he called. If he had to get another lecture about hospitality…
drop me a comment to let me know what you think (i've been super busy lately so im a bit behind in responding, but i promise i will respond to every single one <3)
“Yeah, this kid shoved our son,” Dean said. “And he’s being a little shit about it.”
Benny bit his lip, studying the water, then shook his head. “Different one. Plenty out here.”
So Dean got his route changed and hightailed it back to Sioux Falls, and Castiel went to the address Dean gave him, Bobby’s place.
Dean said he sounded like music, like bells in the sky.
“Alright, enough,” Dean said, swiping at his nose and balling up the tissue. “Enough crying. He’s going to kindergarten, not off to war.”
“My dad’s a dinosaur,” Jack told them, trying to see over the edge of the counter. Wren raised an eyebrow, Cas looked surprised, and Claire stifled a laugh.
“Just,” he squeezed Dean’s hips with his thighs, “fuck me.”
“You bastard!” Castiel spat at Benny. Going to them, he grabbed Dean’s arm, tried to pull him away from Benny. Benny wouldn’t let go. “You’re sick, you don’t care at all if you hurt him.”
As he pulled his grace away from Dean’s skin, Dean pushed his hands off. “You can quit worrying, I’m fine, was fine.”
Bobby continued, “First, John thought he wanted a wife, then some kids, then thought he wanted to travel, thought he wanted the road. Coulda had both, if he really tried, but he was always too busy moving on to the next thing. Guess where that got him? Drunk, divorced, and broke. Lonely as hell too. I don’t wanna see you end up the same.”
But Cas was currently slumped against him, drooling on his shoulder, so he guessed it really was true.
Dean pulled Castiel to his feet and the sudden action sent a bolt of pain up his right wrist. He exclaimed in pain, clutching it close.
Thought it peculiar, but true. Strange how that worked.
Dean turned, nearly spilling his whiskey. “Wait, what?”
“That makes three of them,” Dean muttered, pushing the accelerator as the light turned green. “We’re gonna end up on some blacklist soon.”
“Not long ‘till we get outta here,” Benny said cheerfully. “Feelin’ good about this direction.”
Love meant sacrifice. He hated love, sometimes. Because he loved, he couldn’t be selfish. His life given up for Sam's. Over and over, no end in sight. That was love—never-ending. He knew that. Once it got a hold of you, it didn’t let go. Maybe he loved too much, maybe he didn’t know where love ended and some twisted dependency began. The distinctions between love and its ugly distortions had never been marked for him.
“You can’t drive tonight?”
Dean shrugged. “Don’t know. Maybe one day.” Cas stared at his boots, and Dean nudged his shoulder. “What, you gonna miss me if I do?”
Castiel straightened his shoulders, demanding, “What the hell does that mean?”
Rolling his eyes, Cas handed back the bag of carrots to Jack. The mess in the backseat of papers and crayons—though stressful—gave Dean an idea.
“Fuck, too bad. Seems like, seems like we haven’t seen each other in forever, ya know? What’d you say? A month? When was that? Duluth?”
“I am not ‘poking the bear’.” He put as much indignant expression into his air quotes as he could. From Dean’s amused expression, his effort was ineffective. “I am simply stating what needs to be said.”
“Tommy, apologize.”
, Dean thought. Jody had invited them for the week, mentioning off-hand that Sioux Fall’s pride events were going on, and Dean had pushed aside the mild panic at that comment, told her they’d come visit. He didn’t know he’d be roped into joining everyone at Pride, but here he was, feeling out of place in the corner of the kitchen. Who knew how he’d feel standing at the parade.
“I’m fine,” Dean said, interrupting his rant. Castiel looked at him incredulously. “Don’t gotta babysit me. Drop it.”
The Leviathan was oozing onto the ground and its essence stained his trenchcoat, but Castiel nodded.
she texted back. Then, after a moment, she added,
“You wanna go out in the dark where a fucking ghoul might be hiding?”
, he thought, testing the words out as Dean pulled his hips down against his own. He was surprised at how natural the words felt. Not enough to say them aloud, though. Not when he thought the sentiment might be one-sided. It was enough just that Dean was here.
He leaned on the wall next to him, and Castiel motioned with his cigarette. “Do you want one?”
Dean waited for an answer, and he forced himself to feel the hard ground under him and the throbbing pain in his wrist. “I’m here.”
Dean felt his face warm. He didn’t know how Cas could just say it. So plainly. No fear. But it must’ve felt like such a relief for Cas to finally get the words out; Dean wanted to know what that was like.
“Can understand. A bit.” Castiel looked at Dean curiously. Dean shrugged. “Not exactly heroes to the other hunters. Not with Sam drinking demon blood and me breaking the first seal.”
Dean fell quiet on the other end, and Castiel wondered if Dean missed him, when they were apart. But Dean knew plenty of other drivers. Not for the first time, he wondered if Dean had other arrangements, with other drivers, with someone at home when he had time off.
“Don’t push it.” He caught Cas’ smile in the dark and elbowed him on principle before shifting over to kiss him. Then he tugged at Cas’ arm and turned onto his side, prompting Cas to press close against his back and wrap an arm around him.
It was easy to believe, now. Something in the tender way Benny cradled Dean’s neck when he took his blood. As if he had loved someone before. Perhaps the reason he remained so sane now; memories and hopes keeping his thoughts in order.
"I already had one in mind," Cas said, brightening. "In case this one didn't work out."
The bed in the sleeper berth of Dean’s truck wasn’t made for two, but that didn’t stop them from climbing in. Dean pulled shut the curtain hiding the sleeper from the rest of the cab, and they lay there in the darkness, wandering hands, getting acquainted with each other’s bodies again.
“I have extra, I flew to the craft store this morning to buy some.”
“Yes.” He shifted, cleared his throat. “Already got one. Decided to stop early for the night.”
“Yes, she will,” Cas said, giving Dean a look. He pushed Jack’s hair back from his face. “It’s the thought that counts.”
So. A return to Earth, then. Selfish, that he hadn’t considered how Dean must crave the familiar vinyl of the Impala’s seats, creak of motel beds, greasy diner food, silent parking lot nights under crackling streetlights. After months in Purgatory, would Dean find the transition to life on Earth difficult? Would he hear snarls in every pause, wake startled and sleep restless, hunger for a weapon in his hand and a monster to kill? How long would Purgatory cling to him like dirt on his sleeves?
Everyone moved to take a seat, Zara gesturing for Cas to sit at her right hand side. Dean pointedly took a spot close by to keep an eye on her. “I think you’ll enjoy this dish,” Zara said, passing him a bowl. “Cas tells me you’re the cook here.”
“Traitor,” Dean said. He flipped over a bucket for another castle, then heard Eileen start laughing and looked up to see Jack stepping inside her moat, caving in the walls.
“What?” His smile falling, Cas switched his phone to his other ear. “Why not?”
“Hope we don’t get any storms,” Benny commented, studying the sky as they walked.
Hooking the radio back onto its clip, he watched for the mile markers, tried to see if he could spot the accident in the distance. Flashing lights on cop cars signaled he was drawing near, and traffic slowed to a crawl as the two lane highway narrowed to one lane to accommodate the clean up crew. Two cars sat in the right lane, metal twisted into each other.
Offering his hand, Dean pulled Benny to his feet. “Everyone cool?” he asked. “No one’s hurt, I’m fine.”
And he kept thinking about calling Cas a few weeks ago, when Bobby offered him the shop. He’d wanted to discuss it with Cas, tell him that he wanted to quit driving, but that he didn’t want this between them to end. Tried to tell him, even went so far as picking up the phone and calling, but he’d been too drunk and got the words all wrong, and couldn’t get the truth out.
He thought he should try to take the words back, but he couldn’t speak. Cas wrenched open the door to his truck, and Dean thought he was going to leave.
“Fuck,” Dean breathed, then let out a laugh. He kissed Castiel’s back, and Castiel tried to smile, but his heart was sinking faster than his body temperature.
Laughing low, Benny roughly pat Dean’s cheek, and Dean grinned. His eyes flicked to Castiel’s, and Castiel looked away again.
“Glad you saw her?”
The employee—Wren, by the name tag—looked at Cas with new respect in their eyes. “Language of the angels. Sick.”
Taking a step back, Dean shook his head, wiped his hands on his jacket. “This isn’t like you, man. You used to be the one—”
“That so?” Benny asked, a threat in his tone.
“Just a few things,” Dean said, and then he was leaning in and Castiel was meeting him in the middle and they were kissing, Dean bringing one hand to Castiel’s cheek, his stubble rough under his palm.
“Don’t have to ask me twice,” Benny muttered, walking off.
“I’d be able to tell if there was,” Castiel said. He frowned, focusing inwards to rely on his angelic senses rather than physical. “The closest monster is a few… I’d say three and a half miles off.”
“Oh,” Cas said. He watched the bird, expression eerily similar to Jack’s.
Benny laughed. “If he wants to join, I’m game.”
“You know, I saw you a few weeks ago,” he said, flicking the bathroom light off as he stepped back into the room.
“What?” Dean turned him right-side up and stared at him like he was seeing him for the first time. Jack giggled. “Sorry, dude, my bad.” He set him on his feet and took some of the bags from Cas. “See ya, Krista.”
“I’m sure Cas will talk to her, let her know this is all a misunderstanding. In the meantime, try to be friendly, okay? We can’t risk getting the Djinn on our bad side.”
“You’re fucking crazy.” A smile tugged at his mouth.
, Castiel wanted to say, but then Benny kissed Dean on the mouth.
“This is nice,” Cas commented, voice quiet. “I’m glad it’s helping.”
Only for a second, then Dean pulled away, eyes flitting to Castiel, back at Benny. Something unspoken between them which Castiel didn’t understand. He stared, feeling as if he stood miles away.
“Sure, Cas has enough for three of them.”
The first stretch of his wings, full and weighty, was glorious. His first flight brought him to tears, and his first return to his true form in so many long years was exhilaratingly freeing. He saw the stars, he moved among them. He twisted in the air and whooped, cheered, hummed.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Sorry.”
When he cleaned up and crawled back into bed, Dean was on his phone. “Sam texted me,” he said, looking up as Castiel slipped under the covers. “Sent me a photo of Jack on his first field trip.”
Crouching, Castiel studied intently the rocks and pebbles along the bank, fought a sudden, reckless desire to draw his blade. One rock gleamed, black as night. He picked it up and let it tumble into his palm.
Cas frowned, looking up at him. “Is today another human holiday I’m unaware of?”
Cas sighed. “Okay.”
Dean nodded. Jack had done great in preschool and they had spent all summer preparing him for the transition into kindergarten. Not that Jack needed much convincing to go. He loved school; it was more Dean and Cas who needed time to adjust to the idea.
Dean rolled his eyes but kissed his neck anyway.
Castiel wanted to point out that he could hold good conversations, if he liked the person he was speaking to. He enjoyed talking to Dean, and Dean could talk for hours. Spend five hour car rides telling Castiel about the best burger places on both coasts, the best Eastwood movies and why. And he listened too. Let Castiel tell him about how the stars were formed, how the Grand Canyon was carved into the Earth. Laughed when he described the antics of his fellow angels.
Dean froze. “What do you mean, more?”
“Bits and pieces,” Benny answered casually.
His greatest regret, though, was that his actions had brought Dean here too.
“Yeah, well.” Settling back against the headboard, Dean took a drink and shrugged. “Figure now is as good a time as any.”
When he stood, his pockets full of stones thudded against his thighs. Comforting weight. His shirt was torn at the hem. Should take Benny’s advice and take clothing from a monster they killed. Needed durable clothes, not what the hospital had dressed him in. Once pure white, now stained. But he thought they reflected him better this way.
Dean grimaced, but chose the cinnamon sugar and corn flake one. Why that was even a combination was beyond him. Bracing himself, he took a bite. Okay. Dry. Pretty bland. Crunchy which was just
Bobby had texted him that he had all the paperwork ready, just needed signatures. Dean would start working at the shop after maybe a week’s break, maybe sooner. Only a few days now. Everything was moving so fast. It seemed cruel that one of the few times he and Cas were going in the same direction, getting to see each other more than once, they had to do so with the knowledge that this was it. Couldn’t even enjoy it.
Dean had interrupted.
He led Castiel through a hallway, the walls decorated with framed photos. A younger Sam and Dean sitting on a hay-strewn wagon holding pumpkins as big as they were, Dean with a trophy for wrestling, school photos, the whole family dressed up for a wedding.
“What?” Dean asked, glancing at her. “Yeah, uh, I mean, sorta.”
“Yeah, yeah. I can do that.” Still, he couldn’t resist kissing under Cas’ jaw, stubble rough against his lips, Cas’ hands clutching at his shirt.
Castiel glared at him, but Dean bent his neck to this side, deliberately giving Benny access. Sliding one hand around Dean’s neck, Benny bent over him and Castiel looked away, clenching the rock in his hand. Heard teeth sliding into skin, heard Dean inhale sharply, and couldn’t bear it anymore. Walked away and kicked at a loose twig, watched it hit a tree and disappear into the brush.
With a thud, Dean shoved the werewolf back against a tree, holding his weapon to the monster’s neck. The werewolf snarled, saliva flying, and Dean pressed his blade deeper, drawing blood. “Try anything and I’ll kill you.”
“Think time passes the same on Earth as here? Could be a day upstairs. Could be years.”
“I don’t want, we’re not—“
Re-heated diner leftovers and slices of pie for breakfast, crumbs on the bed, brown bags in the backseat, lunch breaks at rest stops, sitting on the hood to unwrap grease-stained burger wrappers, kept warm from the sun coming through the car’s windows.
“I wanna make peach pie,” he told Dean.
From his body language, Castiel knew the conversation was over, but a thousand words still threatened to spill from his mouth. Apologies, attempts to explain his actions. There were no suitable explanations.
It was warm in the cab, the highway empty in both directions, the stars and moon bright, no clouds. The trees along the side of the road were shadowy masses, ruffled edges along the sky, and in a pull-off area, passed in a blur, sat several rigs, dark shapes like slumbering beasts. Dean’s headlights lit the dark asphalt and chipped lines of the road, and ahead of him hovered two red lights like eyes.
While this wasn’t his first time hooking up with another driver, it was his first time sharing a bed with one of them. In all his years driving, he’d preferred to keep things as no strings attached as possible. But the wind was rattling the windows, and his limbs were sinking into the mattress, and what was the harm anyway?
Visions of Kelly, content, calm, undisturbed by the fears and guilt which racked her then. Sam, carefree, no weight on his shoulders. Dean. Suffused with joy.
to miss this—but
“Dean? Are you alright?”
Dean canted his hips up. “Fuck,” he whispered, opening his eyes, looking down at Benny. Castiel didn’t have eyes for the vampire, had watched numerous couplings over his lifetime, but never felt this way, felt his fingers itch, wanting to
Cas’ expression turned thoughtful, as if taking stock of every physical sensation in his body, and Dean had to grin at his seriousness. He nodded. "Yes."
“No, it ain’t.” Then he studied the man closer. A baseball cap, stubble, a backpack over one shoulder. “You a driver? One of those trucks out there yours?”
“Is, um… Is everything alright with you and Cas? He was wondering where you went.”
“Yes.” When Dean didn’t say anything immediately, Castiel asked, “Is everything alright?”
“Castiel,” he said, shaking his hand.
Dean wasn’t so sure that was true. But, short of driving all night out to Boise, he supposed there wasn’t much else they could do. Still, he didn’t like the idea that he might’ve missed a clue, might’ve misled the hunter. He clicked his pen again and again, going over the case in his mind, worst case scenarios—
Dean laughed. “Yup, you get it.” Feeling generous, he slung his arm over Cas’ shoulders, patting him on the back before pulling away.
“Alright, thanks.”
Castiel raised his eyebrows. “Long time. I don’t think I could do that.”
He was sitting in the library trying to parse through a stack of books, organizing them according to random categories he was half-sure Sam had made up to specifically torture him.
Dropping his hands, his eyes settled on the weighted blanket that Cas had left folded on the chair at the desk, a silent plea for him to use it. He rolled his eyes. Anxious, his ass.
Either way, lying under twenty pounds of “cotton and poly pellets” wasn’t going to help. Though the blanket
he told himself.
“Stay still,” Claire ordered, frowning down at Jack’s hand as she painted his pinky.
was crying.
torturous, but he couldn’t admit that—he had a reputation to uphold. Straightening, Cas rolled his eyes. “Feel any better?"
“Hello?” he answered the call. He glanced at the time on the dashboard. Later than they'd planned to meet. Maybe Dean had gotten stuck in traffic.
The river looked like viscous oil in the dark. Stopping a few yards away, Castiel forced himself to watch the undulating motion, close enough to keep the two in his sights, far enough to pretend he didn’t see the way Benny had a hand cupping Dean’s jaw, Dean’s fingers curled into his collar, twisting in his seat to kiss him more easily, Benny’s hand slipping down under Dean’s waistband.
Benny was silent for a long moment, then he sighed, defeated. “Well, hell. He chased after you didn’t he? Kept trying to convince him not to, told him you weren’t worth risking his life, but he kept going.”
“Not particularly.” Not anymore. He reached out and touched Dean’s shoulder, stopping him. “Dean, you have to know—”
“Yeah, I saw you on my last route. You passed me on I-70. Was kinda hoping we’d run into each other again.”
He stopped and looked at her. “What?”
Tommy only glared at them, and Dean glared right back. “He needs to apologize to Jack,” Cas said.
Dean swallowed hard. “Me too,” he admitted, and it felt like a lot to say, but it was such a relief to confess it.
"No, I know—”
Castiel nodded. “You were right, it does suck you in.”
“Nah, I quit.” Dean nudged him with his elbow, sending a shiver down his spine. “So, what’s new?”
“Thanks, but…” Then he reconsidered and studied Castiel.
“Don’t you fucking leave again!” Dean told him, shoving Castiel again. This time, Castiel didn’t move.
Turning on his heel, he ignored the vampire's, “Thanks.”
“Dean, we have a visitor.”
Dean watched him. Sand flecked his chubby cheeks and his sunhat kept drooping over his eyes. Dean brushed the sand from Jack’s cheeks and said, “Just hate seeing him get hurt.”
“You hear what he's telling you, Dean? Your buddy is saying—”
It felt right.
Noah gestured to the bartender and glanced at Castiel’s nearly empty beer. “Can I buy you a drink?”
Castiel nodded. “Can I—” He took a hesitant step closer, and Dean let him hug him, first stiff, then relaxing into it, pulling him tighter, ducking his head into his shoulder.
Sam and Eileen went to the boardwalk to get everyone lunch, and Dean got Jack to stop kicking sand everywhere by convincing him to sit down and burying his legs in the sand.
"Yeah, yeah. I know."
“Everything I ever did, I did for you—”
“Almost,” Dean managed. “So good, Cas, so good,” under his breath and Castiel’s face flushed, then, “Fuck, fu—” His hips stuttered and he jerked with a grunt as he came, and Castiel hated that he couldn’t see.
They kissed until Dean couldn’t catch his breath, until he felt weak at the knees. He let out a breathless laugh when they broke apart, and Cas smiled at him.
“Love you too,” Cas said, heading around the building to the main road. He turned to wave and call, “See you tonight.”
“You mean that wasn’t you two getting handsy behind the rest stop the other day?”
“Alright, we need to talk.” Grabbing Cas’ arm, Dean pulled him into the adjacent hallway. “Stay right there!” he told Zara, jabbing his finger at her.
turned two.”
Dean spent the day driving to Indianapolis and picking up a new trailer, then making it a few hours towards Minneapolis before finding a place to park for the night. As it grew dark, light posts along the Love’s parking lot casting an orange glow, he went through his DVIR, inspecting his truck and trailer. Brake lights were good. Left back tire needed more air. He was so goddamn ready to be done with this repetition: drive all day, inspect the truck, sleep on a too firm bed, get up the next morning to do it again. One more day.
“Well, suck it up. Tough luck.” He started walking off with a, “Come on, time’s a-wastin’,” and Benny swore under his breath.
Biting his thumbnail, he told himself all good things came to an end, over and over again until the words lost their meaning. No one was saying it had to be this way, that this had to end. Just him. And maybe he was wrong. Wouldn’t be the first time.
“Don’t drown,” Dean told him and Sam rolled his eyes. He watched them go to the waves, then pulled out the book he’d brought. He couldn’t focus on the pages, though, his eyes continually returning to where Cas lay on the blanket, Jack curled up next to him, face soft in sleep. As Cas read, he absentmindedly scooped up sand and let it sift through his fingers.
“Yes. But I’m right.” Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck and they watched Jack play. The girl broke free of the sand, and Jack cheered. “He’s gonna be alright. He has a lot of good people looking after him. Including you.”
“Thought you’d gone,” he said simply, arms crossed.
His eyelids pulled with sleep as they lay there and talked, slow, quiet conversation, both drifting off. The lot had quieted down; no more trucks hissing to a stop or drivers yelling greetings. By this time, most drivers were probably bedding down. He and Cas were honestly lucky no one knew they hooked up with the amount of times they had done this. Why they kept it a secret, Dean wasn’t sure; it was just an unspoken agreement between him and Cas.
Dean would never forgive himself, even if the fault was entirely Castiel’s. Even if he deserved the punishment he had coming to him.
He jumped when Dean touched his shoulder. “Hey, you good?”
that wasn’t what he wanted to say. Words were hard.
destined to fail again—Oh, you mean the ice cream.” He glanced at Jack, who was dripping ice cream onto his lap with every spoonful. “Um. Traumatic experience?”
Coming over with the tray of their food, Cas put out a hand to steady Jack’s chair. “That would be unnecessarily cruel."
“Your son is a menace,” Cas told the woman—Denise. Playgroup gossip said her son had gotten held back from kindergarten due to his inability to ‘play nice with others.’ Jack’s crying had subdued to sniffles, but Cas still held onto him like he might break apart. “He was bullying our son.”
“Throwing a pity party ain’t gonna help anyone,” Dean muttered. He crossed his arms over his chest. “Just gotta get outta here.”
“I know, I know, he has you and Sam and Eileen—”
Benny’s throat worked as he sucked Dean's blood out and swallowed. His other arm snaked to Dean’s waist, holding him close, and Castiel ducked his head. Almost felt wrong to watch. Too personal,
Benny felt the corner of his mouth tug upwards. “Go do that.”
“Yeah, practically raised me and Sam. Good guy. Probably talked your ear off.”
Cas huffed. “You keep saying that. Hasn’t happened yet.”
“Used the tomatoes you grew and everything.”
Castiel spoke up, “You shouldn’t. He hasn’t had much time to rest with all the attacks.”
Another frightening possibility: the vampire clinging to Dean, leeching off of his blood. But was Castiel the same? Clutching onto a human who didn’t need, didn’t want Heavenly help? Shame curled his fingers in his pockets at the thought of his invisible voyeurism on Earth; drifting into the hallways of Dean’s new home, pulled by the glow of Dean’s soul.
He watched Cas merge out of the pull-off area and followed. “So, I’m officially out of food,” he said. “Looks like it’s gonna be a diner meal tonight.”
Curled up on his side instead, facing away from them. Absentmindedly, he twined his fingers in the grass. His fingers found a stone and wrapped around it.
As he drove, Castiel ran over his route in his head. He’d risen early that morning, said goodbye to Dean, hit the road. He had to reach Denver, Colorado by 7 p.m. that evening to deliver the trailer he was pulling, then pick up another load and find out where he was headed next. He might not have to continue driving until the morning, though, if this next load wasn’t ready to be picked up until tomorrow. While he usually hated delays, he hoped he’d get to stay the night in Denver, maybe even get to see Dean again, depending on where Dean stopped for the night.
Castiel wished he had reassurances to give.
It hit Dean then where he’d seen this man before. The attractive driver who’d passed him on I-70. Looked to be about his own age. Even more handsome up close. Eyes as blue as anything, even under the shade of his brim.
“Just like we talked about.” Pulling his knife from his boot, Dean cut his left forearm, leaving behind a long, red line, trickle of blood down his skin. Reaching out, he took Benny’s arm and cut a similar gash in the vampire’s forearm. Castiel scanned the forest around them. No more Leviathan. Yet.
And normally she would’ve said no way because hanging out with old guys was lame and she didn’t like little kids, but she needed an excuse to get out of Jody and Donna’s weekend plans of cleaning out the garage. Plus, Kaia needed to study for a test—she actually enjoyed school, the weirdo—and had requested no distractions.
“You can hand out hugs without the t-shirt,” he told her, and she grinned.
“I wanna listen to Gaga!” Jack said, leaning over to look at her phone.
“Just dizzy.”
It was late, and Dean was pretending to be more drunk than he really was to win another game of pool and a decent sized bet. The man he was playing against—Cole, Dean thought he’d heard—glowered at him over the table when Dean sunk the 8-ball.
“Dude, what the fuck? Getting freaking engaged to a Djinn isn’t just something you forget to tell us about!”
When he woke up the next morning, he had two texts from Dean. The first apologizing for calling him, saying he’d been drunk. The second explaining he didn’t even remember what he’d said, but by the call being 15 minutes long, sorry to talk his ear off. Castiel replied that it was alright, he hadn’t minded. And that was the end of that.
Castiel glanced at him, then nudged the bowl on the floor with his foot. “Um, no.” That seemed an uncomfortable topic. So, Dean found himself talking about Sam, because give him half a chance and he’d talk anyone’s ear off. Everyone always gibed him for bragging about his younger brother, but Sam was doing well, studying political science, interning at a lawyer firm. And Castiel didn’t seem to mind his rambling, kept asking questions, seemingly actually curious.
Benny had bet him fifty bucks he couldn’t stay on the whole ride, and Dean was never one to pass up easy money. It wasn’t his fault Benny didn’t know he’d done this a few times. When Larry slowed to a stop, he let go of the handle and leaned back, draping himself over the back of the saddle to rub his win in, and maybe just a little because he knew it’d make Cas roll his eyes.
"Whaddya wanna eat?" Dean asked him as he drained his glass of water. "And don't say PB and J," he added before Cas could speak.
The tunnel walls rose up around Dean’s truck, orange lights sweeping at intervals over the steering wheel and his hands. The trailer Cas was pulling gleamed in the lights. He felt disoriented for a moment, like he’d ducked underwater. Always like what? The rumble of their engines echoed hollowly. Ahead, the tunnel opened and tiny pinpricks dotted the dark sky. He thought he knew what Cas meant.
Dean could feel Cas taking a shaky breath and held him onto him longer. He tried not to think about it usually, how dangerous this job could be, but sometimes the fact rose up in front of him, unavoidable. He kissed the top of Cas’ head, then felt stupid for doing so, and let go.
“‘Least he was polite,” Cas said.
“Just.” He shook his head, met Castiel’s eyes. “Different up here, ain’t it? Swear life in Purgatory was… easier.”
“Whaddya mean, already? I just had to sit through two hours of singing and dancing.” It hadn’t been
“Your best is far superior to your father’s,” Cas said.
Jack gave him the choice, and Dean told him,
Dean fell silent. “Don’t know.” Another long pause, then he started talking, too fast, “I wasn’t gonna call you. But I dared myself, I guess. Fuck, not that I didn’t want to. But we don’t ever really talk. Not when we’re off.”
“It’s over already?”
Cole stopped a few feet from him, shadows lining his face. “Give me back my money.”
, Dean thought. “But don’t worry, we’ll be out of your hair tomorrow.”
“Fuck,” Cas swore, getting to his feet, and Dean kept laughing as he walked over, eyes narrowed at him.
Warmth surged in Castiel's chest at those words. “What exactly were you thinking about?”
Benny rolled his eyes. “Old news, feathers. I’m a vamp, you hate me, we get it.”
Dean’s breath hitched, even though he’d guessed the reply.
Dean’s face flushed, but it was either speak now or regret it forever. “I know I said you should leave with Zara, but I didn’t mean it.”
and thanks again for reading!
Trying to get in a more comfortable position, Dean hit his elbow on the wall and broke their kiss with a swear. Cas laughed at him.
“Right.”
, through lessons under the hood of a car, through twin-sized beds always ready to be slept in.
Dean nodded again. “Right.” He grabbed a takeout menu on the nightstand and started flipping through it. “You wanna get food now? I’m starving.”
They’d been busy with hunts all month and on their one day off, Sam had decided it was “organize the bunker” day. He was downstairs in one of the storage rooms happily cataloguing away. Dean was stuck up here, doing the same thing, less happily.
“Who woulda known asking to lay out salt lines wouldn’t make you any friends,” Sam deadpanned.
are going to move closer to Bobby, to Sam. I... I don’t have that. I just think that…” He frowned. “I think moving to some town, getting an apartment, staying in one place, it’d be very lonely.”
“Don’t start with that.” Dean stomped his boot on the ground to scrape off monster guts.
“Might stop fucking monsters from coming after us,” Dean complained, scratching at his neck. Blood under his fingernails.
pretty remarkable that he'd never gotten even a common cold with all the other shit they dealt with. "Fuck."
At his entrance, Cas looked up and smiled. “I found a bookshelf that I think would look nice in our room.” He turned the magazine around so Dean could see.
Sighing, he was shutting his laptop when his phone screen lit up. He stared at the caller ID for a few moments, wondering why Dean would be calling him so late. His heart thudded, hoping something wasn’t wrong.
“He doesn't know,” Castiel said when Benny didn’t answer right away. “No one’s seen it.”
Cas let out a breath that sounded like relief. "We'll learn."
“No. What’s going to happen to the shop?”
“What?”
“Guess I’ll join ya.”
Laughing, Jack kicked his legs free and yelled, “Again!” Dean scooped sand onto his legs, repeating the process.
“My hero. I thought I was gonna be stuck there all day.”
“What’s this one again?”
His hands were trembling, covered in Leviathan ooze. Trenchcoat torn at the seams under his arms. Shakily, he withdrew Dean’s handkerchief from his pocket. Taken while he slept. Clumsily, he wiped his hands, his face, his neck. Rough fabric comforting, his jittery shaking slowly stilling.
“There he is!” Cas said, pointing out his window. Dean leaned over him to see Jack jumping over a hopscotch chalk drawing. One foot, two feet, one foot, two. Reaching the end, another kid high-fived him and Jack beamed. He cheered as someone else went through the course, then, the game abandoned, Jack ran with the others to the swings.
Why did everyone keep asking him that? “Fine. He’s, uh, he’s happy for me. Didn’t have much of an opinion on it.”
Even more so, he liked the silence. No angel radio. No warring, arguing, scheming, worshipping. Titling his head back, he studied the black expanse of sky—no stars or moon for navigation or light. And no angels watching him, waiting for a transgression.
"For the record,” he said, feeling Cas curl around him. “I wouldn't change anything either."
"I know you're tired because you missed them saying aliens created the lost city of Atlantis."
“I suppose so,” Cas sighed and set the blanket down on a chair. Turns out the call was from a hunter out near Boise who needed help with a case.
Dean blew him and Castiel didn’t know whether that was an apology or not. He didn’t know whether he’d been
He didn’t emerge until that night, when sounds of conversation and activity had diminished outside his door. One thing he had to say for the Djinn, despite the number of them staying over, the bunker had never been cleaner and they’d all obeyed his command to stay out of the garage. Begrudgingly, he had to admit it wasn’t so bad having them over. If only Zara wasn’t actively trying to impress Cas.
Cas smiled a little. “Wouldn’t matter, we’d end up going opposite directions.”
the vampire withdrew his fangs. He swiped with his thumb at a trickle of blood running from the bite marks and sucked at it. Catching Dean’s eyes, he grinned, and Dean returned the smile weakly.
“You can’t con a con man, boy. It ain’t fine, and I gotta know, because this is my shop we’re talking about. What’s got your panties in a twist?”
The werewolf spluttered and choked, body jerking up around the blade. Dean twisted it, then yanked it out, and the monster slumped on the ground. Benny stepped forward and, with a final swing, severed its head.
Rolling down his sleeves, he returned to where Dean had dropped down onto a decaying stump, declaring,
which i used while researching for this story
Rolling his eyes, Cas moved his jacket aside and sat down. “I think the machine is defective, I could’ve done it.”
Dean handed the drawings back. “Take a look at all of them, be our judge.”
“Obviously, I'm less than comfortable with that,” Benny muttered. “Think I should have a say, seeing as how I’m gonna be trusting you to take me through.”
“Nothing.” He smiled at them. “Just enjoying the day.”
And every night, Castiel listened. Heard Dean’s voice pleading. Fear, that he was dead. Promises, that he would find him. Did Dean know too that every time he grew closer, Castiel flew further away? For months, he kept his resolve to keep his distance, lead the monsters away from Dean. And for months and months, Dean searched, and finally Castiel couldn’t stay away any longer. He should’ve stayed away.
, Dean was going to quit, and he didn’t know what that meant for them.
“You like bees, right?” Claire asked Cas, spotting a “Save the Bees” pin. She held it up for him.
“Hey!” Dean protested.
Castiel ducked, raised his hand to shield himself from the flying droplets. Silence. All three dead.
“It doesn’t feel that way,” he admitted. Scooping river dirt into his hand, he pushed a forefinger around the tan sand, speckled with black and grey. “So I kept walking and when you kept following, I hid. You passed within fifty feet of me.” Dean’s jaw tightened and he started shaking his head. Castiel rubbed his thumb and forefinger together, mud staining his fingertips. “I understand what that phrase means now, 'sick to your stomach.'"
Castiel swallowed hard, nodding. He winced as Dean pulled out.
“Enough of this shit,” Dean grumbled, mouthing under Cas’ jaw. “We’re getting a motel room next time.”
Dean changed lanes, watched a tarp flap over the bed of a pick-up truck. "I don't know how," he admitted.
Dean nodded. At least he didn’t seem about to flee. Castiel had been more than a little worried that maybe Dean was just a straight guy messing around and that he wouldn’t ever speak to him again after what happened the night they met.
Cas studied him for a long moment, then said, “Okay.” He carefully folded the blanket. “We’re keeping this, though. I still think it’ll work.”
Castiel followed his gaze. The dusky light made the water seem soft, like a surface he could caress.
Then again, communication never had been one of his and Cas’ strengths.
Voices carried from outside the bar, and he looked up. But none of the shadowed figures standing outside were Dean.
How long he knelt here, he didn’t know, but eventually, snarls and hisses drew him from his reverie and he lifted his head to see Leviathan gathering at the bottom of the ridge, tongues twisting in the air, catching his scent.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean said, feeling his face warm as he sank down on the driver’s seat. “Yeah, our routes crossed.”
“What are you guys doing here?” she asked.
Benny snorted and Castiel turned on him, swinging his fist in a punch that met the vampire’s face, sending him toppling to the ground.
Cas’ eyes fell shut when he leaned down to kiss him, and Dean smiled a little before pressing his lips to Cas’,
“Fella had some chompers on him,” Benny laughed weakly.
He started to stand, but Castiel shot out a hand and pushed him back down. Benny lowered Dean’s handkerchief and Castiel touched the side of his head, not bothering to be gentle. Enough grace to knit the wound back together, stop the bleeding, and he withdrew his hand.
“Here, you go,” Dean said, handing over a warm mug.
Cas picked up one of the menus already lying on the table and flipped it open. “Maybe when I’m driving near Sioux Falls, I can stop by. See how you’re doing.”
Dean’s initial surge of relief faded away when Cas kept glaring at the soil. Since he was pretty sure the tomato seeds hadn’t done anything to bother him, he asked, suddenly nervous, “
Dean wiped his hand on his jacket, left a bloody smear. “Must be traveling through a hot spot. Get better in a day or so.”
“Just the four of us,” Jack said.
But what Cas said, instead, was, “I thought you wanted me to leave.”
Normally, he’d ask to be healed, or wait expectantly, but he kept the handkerchief tight to his wound. Castiel felt as if the world had tilted. Months between Dean and this vampire, spent without him. Right before his eyes, their easy familiarity, and yet he’d never pictured this.
“I’m fine, Cas, really.”
"Yes," Cas agreed. "It is what you do. You're very good at taking care of others."
he wanted to add.
“‘Course not.” They got under the covers and Dean tapped the wall to his right. “Wish this bed was bigger. Why do they always have to be so damn narrow?”
He wished he knew where he belonged. He was not much of an angel anymore, but he hadn’t been much of one for a long, long time. Where did he fit in? Not Heaven, not Earth, perhaps here. Perhaps not. But he wanted to choose, wanted to learn, wanted the comfort of knowing his place in the world.
Right, that was it. Dean felt his shoulders relax. “You don’t gotta worry about me, Bobby. I ain’t like that. I know what I want. I wanna quit driving, I wanna work at a shop. I’m not having second thoughts.”
“Knew you had to be tough as nails to have survived more than a few hours out here. Thought if I was gonna have any chance to get out, it’d be with you.” Dean ducked his head, kicked a stray stone aside. “‘Course.” Benny glanced at Castiel, eyes glinting dangerously over his grin. “Didn’t know you had feathers with you.”
Castiel twisted the ties for his trenchcoat, saw Benny glance quick at him.
“So, we run into each other again,” Dean said, coming over to the shaded place where Castiel stood. So, he
“Do you hear me, Cas?” Dean repeated, quieter now.
Dean was quiet for a moment. “Yeah, probably right.”
“Can I confess something to you?” he asked Dean, because the words were lingering in his throat and he wanted to speak them. Wanted Dean to hear. He remembered his first confession.
“That’s so corny,” Dean complained. But he kissed him again. “Hell yeah we are.”
Furiously, he crimped the edges of the pie crust and accidentally tore a hole. “Son of a bitch!”
The water rushed around him, past his calves, his thighs, to his waist. Memories flooded him of souls eating him from the inside, limbs controlled by something loud and tormentous, grace choked by black ooze, sinking under water.
Dean snorted. “Nope. Just a mean, nasty drunk.” He grinned. “Not that Bobby can’t get like that sometimes. But no, not like John.” He nodded at the trucks parked in the lot. “Still driving over the road?”
A seagull landed by the blanket and Jack let out a yell, his eyes widening. He stared at Dean, then the bird. “It’s a seagull,” Dean told him.
One question. Why didn’t Dean ask for his grace? Did Dean think he would let him bleed, let him hurt? Hesitantly, he approached him. “Let me,” he told him.
“What?” Dean asked, seeing a slow frown cross Cas' face as he stared at the screen.
Castiel nodded slowly. “I’ve thought about it often. I keep telling myself I need to stop thinking of it.”
“Hey, now, he’s okay—”
Castiel gripped his blade tighter. “Dean?” he asked, an edge to his voice.
He didn’t know how long he sat there, but eventually a blaring truck horn startled him and he came to his senses. He checked his mirrors, turned his key in the ignition, turned on his GPS, hands running on autopilot. Didn’t matter what Cas thought, didn’t matter how Cas felt, this was how things stood.
“They’re dead, right?” Dean asked, pushing over one of the heads with the toe of his boot, unseeing eyes and stained teeth turning to the side. “I mean, when we kill them here, they just stop existing? Or do they come back to life here? One big cycle?”
“Hi Krista.” Cas transferred his cloth bags to his other hand—tomatoes, mason jars, bell peppers, and corn on the cob bumping against his leg—and reached for Jack’s hand. The five-year old poked at the peaches, plums, and apricots lined up at a precarious angle on Krista’s stand. “Jack, careful.”
“If you find him, tell him to join us,” Zara said, “Sam and I are going through the Men of Letters’ books on the Djinn. I’m afraid there are quite a few historical inaccuracies.”
“Your wounds will heal over time,” Zadkiel started.
“Then how is this gonna work? I ain’t doing some half-assed thing like we’ve had all these years. And I ain’t doing long distance. I tried that with Lisa, I don’t wanna do that again.”
Dean’s collar was pulled up, his body language stiff even in sleep. Unconsciously shielding himself from the cold. Castiel wanted to reach over and touch his forehead, warm him with his grace, but he wasn’t so sure the gesture would be appreciated.
As he poured himself a cup, he heard someone call his name, or close enough. “Hey, Deano!”
Dean wheeled around to see Sam standing in the doorway. “What’s it look like?” He slammed shut the fridge door. “Making a goddamn pie.”
A hand pressed against his chest and he looked down to see Dean stopping him. “Cas,” he warned. “We need him.”
“Don’t get kidnapped,” Dean added.
Balancing one stone carefully, drawing his hand back slowly, Castiel drew his eyes away from the stones. Hariel stepped forward cautiously, heard Zadkiel swear in Enochian under his breath.
Castiel met his eyes. “That is the only reason you are keeping him around?” He wasn’t quite sure what he was asking. A question sparked from Dean’s willingness to let Benny drink from him, their easy banter, comfort around each other.
“Can you guys shut up?” Dean muttered, eyes still closed.
He held Dean’s gaze, trying to convey as much sincerity as he felt, hoping Dean understood what he meant, what he saw. How much love there was in Dean, how much he cared for others. He loved so deeply, and his family was lucky to be on the receiving end of it.
“I was preoccupied!” Cas protested.
“Nah. You’ll be fine.”
He once believed he could be a different kind of angel—one both tied deeply to Heaven and yet autonomous. One obedient to God and yet free-thinking.
Trying for casual, not desperate, Castiel asked, “Do you think maybe we can meet up again, before then?”
Castiel thought. Though Benny kept insisting that they were headed the right way, the days continued to pass without any sign of a portal.
“I want you to know that my grace was created for Heaven’s purpose,” Castiel said, stopping at Benny’s side. Benny squinted up at him. “For healing, restoration, and power. Not to heal monsters.”
“And you realized this while making pie?” Cas asked, gesturing to the dish on the table.
“He pushed me!” Jack managed through his sobs, and Dean turned on the older kid.
His wings rose, ready, but they were gaining, they had his scent. No escape.
“And we’re in fucking Purgatory!” Dean threw his hands out to the side. “Nothing makes sense anymore! Nothing’s the right side up! So get off your fucking high horse—you know I could say plenty about you. You teamed up with a fucking demon. And for what? To become some fucking god? How the fuck do you explain that?”
“Not fair,” he complained. “You don’t ever get cold, not with all the blood you’re drinking. Cas doesn’t either.”
he told himself. Cas lived here, didn’t he?
He stared at it for a moment, holding it in his hand, and wished he’d quit driving before she died. He could’ve been around more. His mind ran to Cas coming over after the funeral, to walking through Bobby’s scrap yard with him. He’d been nervous about Cas visiting because it felt like such a huge thing, to have him meet his family. Too personal. But when Cas arrived, it felt right. Felt natural to sit at the dinner table with Cas and his family because Cas wasn’t a stranger, wasn’t just a hookup, he was a friend. He’d tried telling Cas how much he appreciated him coming over, but words didn’t do it justice. Cas, though, always knew what to say, knew the right words when Dean’s thoughts were a complicated mess.
Then black smoke crash-landed to the ground in front of them, bringing them to a halt.
Sam took her hand and made an awkward nod, half bow. “Um, uh, pleasure."
There wasn’t any room for argument in his voice, but Castiel tried anyway. “If he does that again—”
He came over to join them on the couch and Jack scrambled to crawl into his lap. Dean touched his chest again, the words almost burning under his hand now that he knew what they said.
engaged to Cas.” Jack finished off his cookie. “Cas told me, when he came back from Zara’s kingdom.”
“Nah, John was more the distant part. Couldn't be bothered to stick around. I hardly knew him. After he and Mom got divorced when I was four, he kept to himself. Showed up to a few birthday parties drunk and my mom banned him from coming over.” He grinned. “She hated the sonuvabitch. Can’t say I was too fond of him either.”
“Daddy?” Jack spoke up.
“Fuck you.” He stomped off to his truck. “Asshole.”
Cas sighed. “You put too much on your shoulders.”
she’s engaged, she
“What’s wrong?” Castiel got to his feet, knocking a pile of twigs over. “Is he alright?”
Meg raised an eyebrow. “Damn, I don’t believe it. How much you wanna bet that you’ll only last a month before you’re back on the road?”
Cas dropped his hand to the bedspread. “No, I don’t want that.”
Pulling his hands from his pockets, he took Cas’ hand. Cas interlaced their fingers immediately, squeezing tightly, then lifted their hands and studied Dean’s nails. Dean had let Jack paint a smiley face on his pinky to match the one on Jack’s thumbs. Staring at them, he thought of a boy at Pride with painted nails, his own fears and wants tightening his chest, but then Cas looked up at him with a smile, and the memory faded into a warm glow.
“Shit.” He pulled his hands away. “Good thing we’re getting you out.”
Castiel shrugged, tried to bite back his smile. “Just happy you decided to show. Been too fucking long.”
Dean huffed, turning to face him. “Cas, don’t start now.”
Zara blinked at them and Dean stepped forward. “What he means is,” he snaked his hand around Cas’ waist, “he’s taken.”
Dean finished stirring the mix quickly. "Good choice," he heard Cas say and looked over to see him grabbing a bottle of soy sauce.
Dean tensed, hoping Cas wasn’t hurt by the comparison, but Cas didn’t look offended. “Sounds like her.”
“Well, I am not,” Castiel said. “Having fun, that is.
Swearing under his breath, Dean hurried to catch up with him, squinting against the rising sun. As if he wasn’t miserable enough, he had a nagging hangover. “You’re headed to Washington, right? After your 36 hours?”
him and Cas, it felt so right.
“That went over well,” Benny said, coming up to Castiel.
“Did you cry?” Jack asked, eyes narrowing in suspicion. “Sam said you were going to cry. I didn’t cry.”
“What’s he gonna do now that he’s retiring?”
Lucky. Castiel laughed quietly to himself. Didn’t seem very fortunate in his eyes that Benny survived to tell the tale—but perhaps he was only being unkind. Dean could lay aside prejudices, surely he could too.
Cas elbowed him and Dean sputtered, laughing. But, all jokes aside, he thought he understood. It’d been a while since he met someone like Cas that he could just
They tried to clean up as the pretzels cooked, though Jack was covered in so much flour, food dye, and dough that he left a trail wherever he moved. And he would not stop moving. As Dean tried to wipe down the table, Jack ran loops around the island, and when Cas tried sweeping, Jack decided to start spinning around in the middle of the kitchen until he fell over. Then do it all over again.
want to, and for that, Dean was grateful. For a moment, he wasn’t sure what his answer would be.
“Think you're the best thing that's ever happened to me,” Cas said, pulling away enough to meet his eyes. Dean wanted to ask why, wanted to tell him that wasn’t true, it was too big of a statement, but his head was spinning, from alcohol or something else entirely, he didn’t know. He nodded because he couldn’t speak, and Cas kissed him again, slower this time.
Stepping forward, Castiel took the can. “Yeah. I guess.”
Words echoed in his head, Dean’s.
“She isn’t
Dean’s eyes fluttered open. “Good.” Throat bobbed as he swallowed hard. “You can take more.”
Then he was being dragged to his feet, the Leviathan’s mouth opening wide. He kicked at it, catching it by surprise and sending it reeling backwards. Not a second to recover. The second was on him immediately, gripping his arms so tightly, he felt them creak. He stared, horrified, as its mouth gaped open.
“Gonna bash both your brains in if you don’t shut up,” Dean added.
He began to undress, folding his trenchcoat carefully to keep the stones inside his pockets. Down to his undergarments. An exaggeration, that the water was freezing. Colder than before, though. He got in up to his chest, shivering. He had to scrub hard at his skin to remove the stubborn dirt. Should duck under the surface to clean his hair, his beard, but the thought of the water closing in over his head made him shudder.
“The pirate part, I mean.” Dean looked appropriately subdued by the reminder, though, and kept quiet as Benny finished shaving him.
Pushing back the covers, Cas started to rise. “Never mind.”
“If you mean will the trunk always reek like ghoul, then yes,” Sam said. He grimaced as he took off his boots, muddy footprints already leaving a trail down the bunker stairs. Then he glanced at his phone and smiled, said, “Eileen’s calling.”
“Actually, something new. On my last drive, I was near Bedford—where I grew up—so I stopped by to see Anna. Got to meet my niece and nephew.”
Shaking his head, Cas said, “Wish you’d give it a real shot.”
“Sorry.”
Lifting his wings, he extended them over their small group. They seemed similar to the branches lacing the sky, gnarled and jagged. Not visible or tangible in the physical plane, but powerful nonetheless; knew they could protect himself and Dean, the vampire too.
In his rearview mirror, he saw a car speed up to pass him in the left lane. And, besides, Dean quitting didn’t mean they’d never see each other again. But it wouldn’t be the same, he knew. He’d gotten too used to this, too used to listening for Dean’s voice on the radio, searching for his face at truck stops. He’d just have to get used to how it used to be, before Dean. Before he found someone for the first time in a long time that he could talk to, really talk to, that he could always count on being around—if not on every drive, then on enough. It was never fully satisfying, always too little, too few and far between, but it was better than nothing. He’d just have to get used to not even having that little bit.
“No.” Dropping the pen, he pushed his chair back and got to his feet. “Don’t think I can now.”
Pulling on his coat and getting out of the cab with his bag, he trudged through the layer of snow that had already accumulated underfoot. As he neared the main office door, however, the vacancy sign faltered, then turned off.
“Thanks.” He swung his legs as they got into the front seat. “Did you have a good day?”
“You know you want to.” She let Jack lead her away and Dean called after them,
Dean grabbed the door as it swung open. “What do you mean, what the fuck am I doing here? You wanted to see me, didn’t you?”
Dean’s arm was folded under his head to cushion it against the ground. It was going to fall asleep like that. Carefully, Castiel slid closer to Dean and lifted his head, moved it to rest against his leg.
“Swim!” he exclaimed, jumping up and down as he watched people tumble in the waves.
“I told you the waves were too big.”
Dean did too. “Hey, Cas.” There were bags under his eyes, his expression haggard, but a smile pulled at his mouth before it disappeared, like he was too tired to keep it.
Dean grabbed a mug from a cabinet and went to the coffee maker. “Doing what now?”
But then he pulled the handkerchief away, looked to the side.
“How long've you been driving?”
“Clown!” Jack yelled, pointing at the entrance to the McDonald’s indoor play area. A Ronald McDonald cardboard cutout guarded the door, holding a sign reading,
Crouching at the edge, Dean splashed water onto his face and neck, then pulled out his handkerchief and dipped it into the water, wrung it out. Dirt and blood dripped and swirled away. He grimaced. “Bet if I got out of these clothes, they’d stand up on their own.”
played on the TV; one of Cas' favorite pastimes was refuting every crazy claim and theory the show presented with his own recollections of the ancient times. “Sam said this tea will help. He ran out to get some medicine.”
“Fucking hell—” Benny glanced around the room, then back at Castiel. “How the fuck—”
“Yeah. Sure.” He was pretty sure Cas was just trying to appease him, though he didn’t know why. He was the one who’d been rude to Zara, Cas’ “betrothed.”
“Time to get up,” he said, forcing himself to sit.
Part of him still refused to believe it. There was a connection between them, he couldn’t deny that. He knew Dean felt it too, because how could he not? But they never acknowledged it. That was why they never visited outside of drives, wasn’t it? Hardly ever called? Because to do so might make this thing between them grow. It had already grown so much over the years, more than he’d ever expected, more than he reckoned Dean had expected.
Dean picked up the remote as Cas ate, wondering if he should give Claire a piece of his mind. Sure, Cas was pretty easy-going about the whole giving up his grace thing, but no need to rub it in his face. Becoming human had to feel pretty pitiful after ages of being an angel.
"Uh." Dean turned from cycling through the movie options on the TV to look at Cas. He felt himself turn red under the look Cas was giving him, head tilted, that fond almost-smile he got. "Yeah, uh. What I do."
. She usually meant it along the lines of,
“Have a good rest of your day,” Krista told them. Cas waved to her as they walked off. Jack squeezed himself in between him and Dean, taking their free hands.
Nodding, Hariel picked up her pace through the trees, Zadkiel on her heels. Angelic grace drew her forward, communed with her own—but something was wrong, slightly off. This grace, it seemed too… dull. Too entwined in the fabric of this world.
Collecting the stones on the ground, he tossed some aside, placed some back in his pocket, clinking softly. “Dean’s father, John,” he mused aloud, “he taught Dean and Sam to kill every monster they came across. All were evil. It has taken them time to relearn that lesson. They believe some are trying to be good people, trying to fight against their monstrous nature.”
They both lay there for a moment in silence, then Castiel spoke up, “You don’t have to feel obligated to stay, if you don’t want—”
It was in tilting his head back that his collar slipped down, exposing two puncture marks on his neck, scabbed over. Castiel startled. If Dean had been bitten, had he turned? But he could see Dean’s soul, it was still fully human, which meant—
But then again, he supposed that was Purgatory’s goal: make him one of the monsters which lived out eternity here—worse than monsters, actually. Beings with only one motive: to kill. How Benny had kept some semblance of reason and manners was impressive—not that he wanted to give the vampire any credit. A few more years and Benny would be as voracious as any other monster in this place.
He must’ve dozed off because suddenly he was startling awake at his alarm going off. Swearing, he leaned over Cas, fumbled for his phone, and managed to turn the blaring noise off. Dropping back down, he rubbed his hands over his face. Sounds of the parking lot coming to life carried from outside, muffled and distant.
been really soft, he’d give it that.
“I know I can be a real dick,” he said, “and I know I don’t know anything about gardening or agriculture, and I know I’ve been acting weird lately, but it’s because I really don’t want Zara to take you away from us. And maybe that’s selfish on my end—no, I know it is. But she doesn’t know you, really know you! And I do. I’ve known you forever and you’re my best friend and also maybe I wish we were more.” His face heated further, and he quickly added, “It’s alright if you don’t want more, that’s fine, just forget this conversation, but the main point is that I don’t want you to leave. I mean that. Please stay.”
“There is nothing pure about this cesspool of depravity,” he said, forcing disgust into every syllable of the word.
Distracting himself from the feeling, he slipped a hand between them and began to pump himself. He didn’t want to come too soon, not with the sounds Dean was making, not with the ache building deep inside him, not when it’d been so long. They hadn’t had enough time when they saw each other last, hadn’t had time to take it slow, not in a long time. He wanted to watch the way a flush grew across Dean's chest, wanted to make Dean duck his head with a groan and lose his rhythm when he squeezed tight around him, draw Dean's attention by stroking his fist slow over his own length, watch a droplet of water slip from a strand of Dean's hair down his neck.
Dean froze in the middle of pulling back the covers, mind immediately spinning out. "What?" They'd only started sharing a room a month ago, oh God, he'd known it was too good to be true, Cas was sick of him—
, he told himself. Why Zara annoyed him so much. He was just pissed that Zara thought she knew what was best for Cas. It didn’t matter that Cas seemed to get along well with her, that she had so much in common with him, that she wanted to marry him. Technically, if Cas wanted to marry her too, that wasn’t a problem either.
he really didn’t want to leave.
Twenty-four years ago in Mankato, Minnesota, Dean killed a wendigo with a bottle of Jack and a lighter. He told Cas this, how the flames lit the inside of the cave and his dad had to drag him out because he suddenly couldn’t move, how he stayed silent for a week even though his dad begged him to speak.
Castiel wished he could defend himself, but his grace rankled in his chest suddenly, hair rising on the back of his neck and arms. He turned quickly, scanning the forest around them. That scent, that unmistakable presence. A shudder gripped his shoulders. “We may get to test that theory.”
“Seems rigged but okay,” Dean said.
Dean glanced back at Benny, who stood motionless, and Castiel’s face burned. He waited for the questions, the jibes, but Benny stayed silent.
he warned himself, thumbing over the lip of the glass. Because in six days, he’d only be saying goodbye to Cas again.
“Yeah, but.”
The slow grin he got in return took away the chill of the night seeping through his clothing. “Yeah, guess so.”
“Yeah." Dean cleared his throat. "Probably until the end of the month.”
He tucked his wings away. Concentrated on Dean’s steady breathing to steady his own distress. Seemed the sweetest sound after months of silent nights interrupted only by snarls and pursuing footsteps. He had feared that after so long in this depraved place, Dean would be half-crazed, a shell of his former self. Instead, Dean moved confidently. Level-headed, determined in his actions. Walked stealthily, quickly, scanning their surroundings. When monsters attacked, easily disposed of them without hesitation.
“‘Least you can do is try and make it. I mean, it’s been fucking weeks—” He cut himself off, his pulse pounding too quick.
Cas grunted, but made no indication of moving, and Dean nudged him. Blindly reaching out, Cas slid his hand over Dean’s thigh and Dean pushed his hand away. “Nope. I gotta reach my drop-off and we ain’t leaving anytime soon if you start that.”
The Leviathan’s grin turned into a snarl.
His last drive. It sounded so final. Even if they did see each other again, even if Cas did visit him in Sioux Falls, they’d never have it again like this.
He taught Cas how to pass the time on roads that stretched to the horizon. Name a movie for every letter of the alphabet. Name three items you'd take to a deserted island. Name everyone we've lost along the way—he didn't mean to begin talking about them, but they seemed closer than ever before on the open road, under a vast, cloudless sky. The wind whisked their names from their mouths, and Dean liked the idea of them still existing, here, around them.
It's relaxing, kneeling in the sun, pulling tiny weeds from the mulch, digging holes for new plants. Meditative work. As his hands move among the dirt, his mind travels through space and time. Images of Babylonian gardens flit through his mind, a field with a windmill, an ocean stretching to the horizon. All places he felt a measure of calm. Nothing could ever compare, though, to this place, his
“Don’t—” Cas lowered his voice, stepped closer. “I’m not the one who’s calling everything off after seven fucking years.”
“He wrote that?” Dean asked quietly.
“Dad!” Jack called, holding out a rainbow pin. “Look, they have
Castiel nodded, and became hazy. “I will. And you take care of yourself.”
“Yeah.” Cas fiddled with the tab on the top of his can. “I wasn’t able to visit long, just for the afternoon.”
“It’s been said.” Unlocking his cab door, he leaned inside to grab a napkin and wiped at the blood on his face and hands. “Anyway, you’re one to talk. You joined in.” He motioned to Cas’ face. “You’re gonna have a nasty bruise.”
“You’re lying,” Dean said, though he looked appropriately pleased. Jack clambered at his legs, so he gave him a forkful too, then tossed the empty carton in a nearby trashcan. Cas paid for the peaches—and a few plums and apricots too because he’d never been good at self-control in a farmer’s market.
A grunt and rustle of leaves were the only warning of an attack before a vampire rushed out of the woods. Dean swung his blade up, slashing the creature’s arm, and the monster jumped back, baring its teeth.
“Just pissed they didn’t get on the human’s good side.” Shrugged and ripped up the grass stems. “Guess other vamps ain’t a fan of me on Earth or here.”
“Do we really? I mean, he’s walking and talking now, he’s playing with other kids. Fuck, he’s growing up. And quick.”
He used to be afraid that if he let one item fall out of place, he'd lose his grip on the delicate thread which held him together.
Trying to hide the shudder that ran through him at the thought, he followed after Benny and Dean. Hated that Benny led the way, but he could help in his own way couldn’t he? He knew he was weaker even without Benny’s comments and Dean’s sidelong glances, but he could still heal—a little, not enough to draw attention—and he could fight—more sluggish than before, but muscle memory guided him—and he could warn of approaching monsters—not Leviathan, why couldn’t he sense any Leviathan?
“Did they kick you out of Sephora for buying up all the eyeliner?“ Dean shot back.
“Shell!” Jack yelled, and Dean looked down just in time to see him crouch to grab a shell at their feet. Before Dean could react, a wave crashed on the shore and splashed water into Jack’s face.
Castiel felt restless as he hung up his jacket in the closet of the motel room. He was glad to see Dean, real glad. Catching sight of him in the Love’s the night before, he’d nearly started grinning. It was hard to gauge, really, whether Dean was as excited to see him too. He thought Dean had been glad to see him.
“Cas?” Dean asked, and Castiel shook his head. He couldn’t sense any monsters nearby, but Leviathan were stealthy. They’d snuck up on him plenty. He took a step back, closer to Dean and Benny, then felt ashamed of his fear.
Castiel nodded, hoping Benny couldn’t tell how much he was shaking from his grip on his hand.
“Leave it,” Benny told Dean, patting his shoulder. “Had worse than this before.”
“We all good?” Benny asked, addressing only Castiel.
“Hey, you wanna burn?” Dean asked him. Even with the sunhat and the shade from the umbrella, he couldn’t be too careful. Setting Jack’s hat back on his head, he folded up the brim so Jack could see better, then let him go.
Dean startled awake, hand instantly going to the blade laying across his lap. Upon meeting Castiel’s eyes, though, and realizing there was no threat, he grumbled, pushing himself to his feet.
before Cas started to nod off. Dean took the mug from him, and his eyes fluttered open, head jerking up. "I'm fine," he said.
Cas sighed. “I’m used to it.” He shifted, crossed his legs at the ankle. “I don’t know, Anna says it was different before Mom died. Everyone was closer then. My dad got really, I guess, distant after. Really strict too. I hated it. I couldn’t do anything I wanted, always had to work at the dealership, never could go anywhere. I just wanted to do my own thing, which was a sin, apparently in his book.”
"That's not true," Cas interrupted, touching Dean’s hand resting between them. Dean raised an eyebrow. "Dean, being human has been the single most rewarding experience in my entire life second only to raising Jack. It started with you rescuing me from the Empty and revealing my feelings weren't unreciprocated like I thought. I would say that's far from miserable.”
The river trickled softly where they stopped to rest for the night, constant background to their journey. Sitting along the bank to scan the forest on either side of the water, Castiel thought he would’ve liked to have traveled by this river when he was alone. Might have helped take off the edge of stone-silent nights.
Crossing over rippling water or curving through wooded land, he and Cas spoke of a cabin in the woods, a house on the coast, a home. Dean's head filled with the future instead of the past. Every mile that passed under their tires brought them closer to this dream—or so he thought, until he stopped at a red light, and Cas took his hand, and he realized home sat beside him now.
“Insufferable!” Jack agreed from the backseat, ice cream smeared across his chin. Or that’s what Dean thought he was repeating, the word losing a few syllables along the way.
“Oh, you two are killing me!” Dean interrupted with a groan. He started walking away, in the direction they were headed before the ghouls had attacked. “When I get back topside, first thing I’m doin’ is buying ear plugs.” He slashed away at a low hanging branch in his path. “Then sleeping for three years and hittin up Biggerson’s—you ever been there, Benny? Guess not.”
Cas looked at him. “Your dad not the same way?”
“What?” Cas asked, catching him watching.
Castiel smiled. “He was nice. Spoke very highly of you.”
Cas studied him, then smiled a little and glanced at Jack. “This is nice,” he said, and Dean nodded.
“Me neither.”
When he plunked down in the sand next to Jack, he showed him how to pack a bucket with moistened sand, then flip it over to reveal a small hill. Jack clapped his hands in delight and soon they were surrounded by several sand castles.
“I want to know more about this so-called escape hatch,” Castiel said as they walked, following the river. “How do you know where it is?”
The sun glinted in Dean’s side mirror, piercing bright as it hung low in the sky. Rolling his shoulders, he glanced at the time. 4:12 p.m. Around 10 a.m., he’d dropped off his trailer, picked up a new one, and gotten back on the road. Still a few hours before he’d stop for the night.
Every step, a determined choice. Every step, further from Dean.
“Okay,” she decided. “I know where to get you some.”
The wounded look reappeared, then Cas’ expression hardened and, silently, he got in his truck and slammed the door shut.
How did Claire find herself joining Dean, Cas, and Jack for an excursion to the mall?
Cas shook his head, shifting so one of Dean’s legs lay between his, Dean’s thigh against his groin. “No. One day off in between. Rather—” He sucked in his breath as Dean started to move against him. “Rather be here anyway.”
Dean drew his shoulders back, blade still dripping. “Do I need to remind you of our deal? Of what you committed to?
Benny laughed. “That’s another difference too. Hunters I met, weren’t humble. One guy I met,” gestured to his neck, “wore a necklace of vamp teeth. Cruel bastard.” Castiel wanted to ask what happened to the man when he encountered Benny.
“Sounds like a plan,” Benny spoke up. “Let's roll.”
“Do you want my coat?” Castiel asked him, and Dean shook his head.
"Oh, God, don't start that." By
“Yeah, well I can,” Dean retorted. Jack went down the slide with a squeal. Landing at the bottom, he waved at them and Dean waved back.
“Nah, you’ll change your mind. Look at Lisa, she couldn’t put up with me.”
“He’s gonna get us killed.”
“I would think you would be grateful to have an angel’s help,” Castiel told him. “Only time you’ll ever have it.”
Lashing out, Castiel shoved him and Benny crashed backwards onto the ground.
“Thanks, cher,” he said, and Dean nodded, eyes seeking out Castiel.
That sounded selfish, lazy even to his own mind, but he’d tried the whole relationship thing before and he wasn’t so eager to try it again. He liked to think he’d matured some since he was with Lisa, liked to think he could avoid the same mistakes he’d made with her—never being around, not knowing what either she or he needed from each other—but he’d rather not test the theory.
He eyed her. “Funny.”
“Hey!” Benny called to no one in particular, raising his voice above the music and conversation in the crowded bar. He dropped a hand on Dean’s shoulder and announced to anyone who was listening. “This is Winchester’s last drive.”
“Yes, it is,” Cas agreed, transferring the pretzels onto a plate. Dean turned off the oven, then startled when Jack began crying.
“The portal will close soon,” Cael warned from behind them. Hariel could sense the Leviathan nearing and her true form rankled. If Castiel did not consent soon, they would tear him from here regardless. He hardly seemed strong enough to fight them off.
Perhaps the fight hadn’t been taken out of him just yet—his rage rising, he ripped up another tuft of grass, stems sticking to his palms. He had to believe in an escape, had to fight, for Dean’s sake. If his own sins and mistakes forced Dean into an eternity in this wretched place, he would never be able to bear it.
He followed Zara’s annoyingly regal voice to the hallway outside the bedrooms where Cas was apparently giving a tour to her and her bodyguard.
“I have to go now!”
“Yeah,” Cas said and Dean could almost believe his smile, if it didn’t come up too late and fade so fast. “Real good.”
As they ate, they talked about their respective days at work. Dean’s morning had been filled mainly with paperwork and dealing with a cranky customer. Cas had had a far busier day. He ticked off on his fingers everything that happened so far at the grocery store: he’d stocked shelves and cleaned up a spill in aisle three, Ms. Butters had come in and bought cat food for another stray she’d picked up, someone had puked in the bathroom.
“He seems to have recovered from before,” Cas commented.
“Fuck you!” Dean called, still trying to catch his breath, hands on his knees. He felt someone touch his shoulder and looked up to see familiar blue eyes.
“Done!” Jack yelled.
“Yes.”
“What?” Cas asked.
it read along with a photo of perfectly formed pretzels. At the bottom, it also read, "Ages 8 and up." Ah. So maybe a little advanced for a four year old.
“Gotta be fucking kidding me.”
Benny narrowed his eyes at him and Dean laughed, glancing around again. Still no sign.
“I’ve seen some drivers traveling with dogs in their trucks.”
“Just an arrangement for now, feathers, don’t worry. Won’t drink from him when we’re out of here.”
“I kinda made you one. To celebrate, or whatever.” He held out the bracelet.
Jack abandoned the colorful pretzel for the chocolate chip one, then the corn flake one. True to his word, he left one untouched on the plate for Charlie. She would get a kick out of it when she visited.
Castiel nodded. That, he supposed, was Dean’s way of telling him he’d been disappointed they couldn’t see each other. He wondered how much he could read into Dean driving to see him—how much of the motivation was just Dean wanting to get laid, how much was Dean wanting to see him.
, okay not too bad, though he'd never admit it; and
Laying now in the sleeper next to Dean, he reached out and gently traced invisible lines with the pad of his finger from one freckle to the next, moving close to see them in the dim lighting.
“What—” Dean started, then the man nodded once and motioned to someone beyond the doorway.
Castiel glowered at Benny’s retreating back. “You can’t keep giving him your blood, he doesn’t know when to stop.”
“Nothing.” Moving closer to Jack, he helped him fill his bucket.
He fell silent and Castiel fought for the right words to say, scared of saying the wrong thing, scared of saying too much. It was never easy to address grief, but he felt anxious too because he and Dean had never met up before outside of their routes. Unspoken agreement that whatever happened between them, it stayed on the road, didn’t follow them home.
It was all a joke, but Cas’ expression turned somber, serious, and Dean couldn’t look away. Then Cas moved in and kissed him, bringing both hands to his face, and Dean let out a noise of surprise, set his beer down to grab Cas’ shirt. He thought he heard the can fall over at their feet, but he didn’t pay it any mind, too distracted by the way Cas was kissing him breathless.
“Hey!” He turned the car on. “Here we go, Baby, back on the road again!”
Dean laughed. “That doesn’t make any sense.”
Then he declared he wanted the French onion soup from the specials of the day, like he hadn’t just spoken Dean's thoughts aloud in his uncanny way of knowing exactly what Dean wished for before Dean knew it himself.
But it was too late now. Cas would have dropped off his shipment by now, if everything had gone to schedule. Probably already on his way back west. And Dean was leaving.
“Yes. Trying to.” Dean had driven to see him? Pushing past the curtain, Dean went into the sleeper berth and, feeling a little shocked, Castiel followed, pulling the curtain shut behind them.
“Maybe he is.”
Cas pulled his arm away. “That’s all?”
He had long resigned himself to a life of weakened grace, of eventual humanity. A future not too bleak—he had admired humanity for centuries now, always distantly. While his fellow angels may have viewed humans as inferior, he considered the chance of becoming one of them an honor.
Benny was watching Dean too, and his gaze on Dean’s unconscious physical form made Castiel’s fingers itch for his blade.
Dean grinned. “See you around, Cas,” he said, reaching out to pat his shoulder.
Cas cocked his head. “No. Why would she?”
Dean scoffed. “Yeah. Kind. That’s all.” Cas stared at him, cocking his head, and Dean rolled his eyes. Of fucking course Cas would be oblivious to Zara flirting with him. “You finally get through the fuckton of gifts she brought?”
Benny raised his eyebrows. “Think you should show a little more respect, angel. He risked his damn life to go after you.”
If his superiors could see him now, being talked down to by a human. One he had given everything to, no less. Demeaning, especially in front of a lowly vampire. But he merely clenched his hands into fists. “Fine,” he said coldly. “If you don’t want my help, I won’t offer it.”
“If I may,” Zara interjected, and Dean realized Zara and the man, presumably her bodyguard, were watching them go back and forth. “I see there’s been a miscommunication. See, when Castiel arrived for negotiations to obtain the fruit of the Tree of Life, we Djinn were in the middle of a war. I asked for Castiel’s hand in marriage in exchange for giving him the fruit, and we pledged ourselves to each other, agreeing to hold the official binding ceremonies later when the war didn’t require all my focus.”
Benny snorted and Castiel shot him a glare. Then he tightened his grip on Dean.
“California. I’m in between shipments right now.”
“Dean,” Castiel spoke up before Dean followed. With a sigh, Dean turned to face him, and Castiel waited for Benny to get a few paces ahead before saying, “This portal, it won’t work for me.”
Maybe Dean thought that if they didn’t speak, every problem would simply fade away. Castiel felt words bubbling up inside him; explanations, apologies, reasonings, pleadings. Didn’t think any of them would make any difference. Maybe better this way, to pretend. To ignore.
Dean laughed for too hard and too long, until Castiel had to laugh too. “Was a promise,” Dean finally said, catching his breath. “‘Less you’re not interested.”
“Hope so,” Benny muttered. Castiel hadn’t missed the annoyed looks he’d shot him for hanging back while he and Dean tortured monsters for information. For a time, on Earth, he had sworn off violence, decided he wouldn’t take sides in any fight, too risky, might choose the wrong one again. Unfortunately, his life wasn’t privileged enough to abstain from the constant battles between Heaven and Earth, monsters and humans.
Trying to keep his tone light, feeling his stomach turn, Dean answered, “I was going to tell you the next time I saw you in person, now.”
“I only wish he could keep his mouth shut,” Castiel muttered.
Dean stared at him for a moment, then it hit him what Cas was saying. “Cas, no. I’m not letting you come to Sioux Falls with me.”
Benny grinned. “Sorry.” Crossing his feet at the ankles, he bent his head back to look at the dark sky.
“Heard that,” Benny said, returning. “Better safe than sorry, don’t wanna bed down when there’s a ghoul five feet away.”
Castiel’s heart pounded. “You wanna fight?” Benny called. “Come on!”
“Yeah, he looks real concerned,” Dean muttered, hearing Cas’ voice echo down the hallway along with Zara’s laughter.
“Yes, we do,” Castiel said, matching his glare.
Meg rolled her eyes. “Where is Clarence, though, seriously? Swore I saw him at the Love’s yesterday.”
“This way.” Benny gestured with his weapon, similar to the one Dean held, bones lashed to a thick cudgel.
“I know where I ain’t wanted.” Benny got to his feet. “I’ll keep watch.”
He looked to Dean for help, hoping for sympathy, for understanding. Dean knew, didn’t he, why Castiel did what he did? All of it, always, for him. “Dean, tell him, Jimmy consented, he knew what might happen—”
“You know it’s me,” Dean teased, “You don’t gotta be so formal.”
“Well. If it reacts badly, you will make sure Dean gets where he needs to be. And then, you will…” He wanted to say
“That’s fine, we’ll go to yours.”
“Four weeks,” Castiel supplied. Did Dean think he was driving, did he want to try and meet up? “I’m on hometime—”
Dean took it from him and looked inside. The pie and beer he’d requested from the grocery store earlier that day. “Thanks,” he said.
“Well,” Ashley said, “I’m glad you guys were able to make it.” Yeah, that was a fake smile.
That last one was easiest. Cas quit driving a few weeks after he did, got a job at a supermarket down the street from the garage, and started taking classes for an associate’s business degree, thought maybe he’d get a job as a dispatch manager one day. A lot of changes, so he and Dean agreed to take things slow between them, not rush into things, and Cas got an apartment downtown alone.
Bobby nodded at him, smiling to himself as he returned to going through their parts inventory, and Dean rolled his eyes. “Shut up.”
He made a soft groan as he sucked Dean’s blood from his vein. Castiel tensed at the sound. Dean jiggled his knee, hands in fists on his thighs.
But Dean wondered if, put in his dad's shoes, he wouldn't do the same. Because he loved his mom. He held tight to every memory of her, imagined the scent of her hair and the taste of the pies she cooked just for him. He loved the way she had stroked his hair while tucking him in, her reassurances when he confessed being scared of the dark.
“Damn, you remember?” He actually looked impressed and Castiel felt his face warm. “Yeah. He, uh, he actually just graduated undergrad. Kinda crazy. First Winchester to go on to law school.” He looked at Castiel. “You got a few siblings, right?”
Dean nodded. “Fine,” he managed. Cas gave him a small smile and leaned his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“Nothing.” Bobby started to speak and, tired of all the questions, Dean cut him off, “None of your business, Bobby, I’m fine.”
“Fuck off,” Dean said, and Sam threw up his hands.
It wasn’t the first time, Castiel realized with a rush of distress that made his world twist. Nearly one year, Dean and Benny had traveled together.
“Oh?” Dean came to the table, interest even more piqued. “What kind of something?”
“No fish in here,” Dean said, looking down at the water. “Ain’t any animals here, are there?”
When he remained silent, unsure of what to say, Cas spoke up, “Unless...” Dropping his gaze, he fiddled with the torn edge of his menu. “Unless there’s someone else." His eyes flicked up to Dean's. "
to stay updated on whatever project i find myself working on next :)
“I don’t know!” A hand on his back, tentative. “Cas, hey, calm down, man.”
The werewolf scoffed. Without any moon, he was stuck in a perpetual half-human, half-wolf form—dark, patchy hair over his entire body, and jagged teeth, piercing amber eyes. “Old wives’ tale.”
“You are coming with us, aren’t you?”
“But.” Cas rubbed at his eyes. “I drove all day to get here.”
“Sorry it didn’t come easy to trust a vamp,” Dean muttered.
"I want you to," Cas said quickly, as if sensing Dean's downward spiraling. "I just don't want you to get sick."
“Cool.” He jabbed his thumb over his shoulder. “Gotta get a move on.”
