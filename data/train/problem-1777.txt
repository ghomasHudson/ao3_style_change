John reached back, grabbing one of Sherlock's hands and squeezing. "Y-yeah?" he called out. He was terrified of what he might get as an answer.
"I love you too, John," Sherlock whispered against his skin, "so much." He continued to kiss John's throat and face in between words, "I... promise... you... I... will... protect... you." He pulled back and looked deep in his boyfriend's eyes, stroking his face. "I will do anything,
The rest of the week went by quickly and John found himself back on his feet and feeling completely better. Friday afternoon, however, he was feeling nervous, as tonight was the night he was meant to meet Sherlock's father and officially have dinner with the family.
John rubbed a hand over his eyes. "I think I'm alright for now. If I need more sleep, I'll tell you." He grinned up at his boyfriend and pressed his palm to Sherlock's chest. He could feel his heart beating beneath it, and he suddenly realised how much he loved the feeling, that Sherlock's heart beat for him alone, just as his did for Sherlock.
John sighed, squeezing Sherlock's hand for his own support now. "Well, it was actually the first time that we met. Sebastian had gathered the rugby team around Sherlock and by the time I got there they had already knocked him to the ground. I stepped between them and he backed off, but not before almost breaking Sherlock's nose."
John groaned and pulled down Sherlock's trousers. He started to grind harder now that there was only the thin fabric of their pants between them. After another minute he started to move his lips down to Sherlock's collarbone, sucking a mark there while his hands trailed to his lover's hips, fingers slipping under the elastic of his pants.
Sherlock chuckled softly, "no, we certainly won't." He snuggled in close to John and closed his eyes, letting sleep take him.
John hummed and tightened his grip on Sherlock, stroking upward. "Ohhh, you know just how to get me started." He wrapped his free arm around Sherlock's waist, slipping his fingers into the cleft of Sherlock's arse. "And I know how to make it even more interesting."
Mycroft nodded once and stood. He patted John on the shoulder, "you'll be good for him. I'll be watching you both, make sure you take good care of my brother," he said firmly and smiled a little before walking out of the room.
him. He whimpered as he felt a shiver make its way through his body and his arsehole convulsing around his lover's cock.
Sherlock moaned and gripped onto the rail tighter, "and y-you're so big, I... ohhh, I love how you feel inside me," he panted. "Ohhhh,
John was stuck between moaning and crying as he absorbed everything that Sherlock was doing to him. At those last few words, he finally climaxed, hips jerking wildly as he screamed his lover's name.
The people at the party would have to all be in the same social class as Sherlock's family. What if they could tell that he was average, only just coming out of being poor? What would they say? Would they laugh him out of the room? He tried not to let his feelings show as he waited for Sherlock to pour the drink.
Mary nodded, "yes, of course." She walked away, but turned back with a smile. "Just so you know, you two are officially the hottest couple at school now." She winked and turned away, walking back down the hall.
Sherlock nodded, "okay... I'll come with you," he said softly and hugged John to him before letting him go and walking back towards the table.
They say that when you're not looking forward to something, time seems to speed to that event. And that much was obvious to John as he found himself suddenly dressed in a suit and tie, sitting with Sherlock outside the courtroom. He couldn't deny that he was nervous. But if everything went well, then they would be fine. He just wished he could somehow hold Sherlock's hand while he was testifying. He'd have to settle for clasping his own together in his lap.
Sherlock nodded, "In my bedside table," he said quietly and blushed, "Mycroft got them for me as soon as he saw us together. That... was a very interesting conversation," he chuckled and pulled John in for another kiss, "but we won't talk about that."
"John... Oh, God,
Sherlock brought one of his hands up in front of John's face and stuck three fingers at his mouth. "Here... suck," he breathed and whimpered.
"Oh, love..." Sherlock sighed and wrapped his arms around John, running his fingers through the short, blonde hair. "I'm sorry, I should have known better..." he apologised and pressed a kiss to the top of the other boy's head.
John left Sherlock's trousers and pants around his ankles and then leaned forward. "You thought I was a tease before?" he breathed against Sherlock's crotch, enjoying the little twitch he got from his lover. "Just wait." He trailed his nose along Sherlock's length, ever so slowly.
Sherlock smiled and continued to dance, occasionally rolling his hips back to grind his arse against his fiance's groin. He closed his eyes and threw his head back, focusing on the music and the feel of John behind him.
Sherlock sighed into the kiss, grateful for the touch of their lips. He looked up at John and gave a lopsided smile, "really?" Of course he noticed how fascinated his lover seemed to be with his hands, but he didn't realise how much. "I think it might help if you talked to me... I want to keep trying," he murmured.
Sherlock groaned and closed his eyes as he watched the other man come apart. He kissed him softly on the temple and pulled the blanket over his head so he could lick his hand clean. Once he was finished, he tucked John back into his trousers and fastened them. He popped his head back up and smiled at his husband, "did you enjoy that?" he asked quietly.
John chuckled and moved to open his trousers. He shimmied out of them and his pants, then sat back and wrapped his hand around his cock. "I want you to tell me what to do," he said, voice deep.
Once he was dressed himself, he walked back into the bedroom and laid the clothes out on the edge of the bed before crawling onto the mattress and gently straddling John's hips, careful not to wake him yet. He leaned down and started pressing soft kisses all along John's throat and collarbone.
He was silent for a few moments before he spoke again. "I am not sure of your intentions, so forgive me if I've come off as a bit callous. I do care for my brother as much as he likes to pretend otherwise. I was here by his side the last time he ended up like this. All I need to know is that you will take care of my brother. That you will be there for him as long as he needs you to be, which may very well be the rest of his life." Mycroft finished his speech and looked at John, awaiting his response.
Sherlock beamed as tears came to his eyes and he held John close, giving him gentle, loving kisses. He pulled back after several minutes and held up the hand that the ring was on, turning it over and looking at it. "It looks wonderful on you," he said and smiled. "When do you think we should make the announcement?"
Sherlock hummed into the kisses, letting his hand stroke along his lover's hip. They continued to kiss and touch until Sherlock finally fell asleep, head tucked under John's chin.
John was more than a little nervous. He really didn't want to find out that his father was different than he thought, but it was better to know now than later. Besides, after everything else, what were the chances that he would react badly to this? "Da," he started when they returned. "There's something I have to tell you."
"John..." Sherlock moaned as his husband finally entered him. His eyelids fluttered for a moment until John was fully seated inside of him. He reached for the other man's hands, twining their fingers together and bringing them up on either side of his head. He craned his head up to kiss John again, slowly stroking the inside of his lover's mouth with his tongue.
"Well, I personally think it's because we're both damn sexy," he murmured huskily, winking at John. Then he leaned down and pressed a kiss to his cheek, "and I also think it's because we're madly in love and have such a deep connection."
Sherlock added a second finger and scissored them, stretching open his lover. "I love it when you talk dirty to me... It makes me want you even more," he murmured and added a third finger, pushing them in deeper.
," he groaned. He loved this, feeling so alive and so much pleasure was shooting through his system.
John did not expect Mary to push him against the wall, nor did he expect her mouth to press to his a second later. He scrunched up his face in disgust. It was all wrong. Pushing her back, John resisted spitting on the floor next to her with how grossed out he was. "Look, Mary, I don't know what you think you're doing, but in case you haven't noticed, I have a boyfriend." But Mary didn't look upset in the least. In fact, she had a smirk on her face, and John's heart plummeted into his stomach. He should have known there was something strange going on.
Sebastian had gathered up a few of the rugby players and walked over to the bench where John was sitting. He clenched his jaw and knocked the tray out of the shorter boy's lap to get his attention. "Where's the freak?" he growled and smirked.
you... and you love
John smirked a little. "Looks like I haven't been a very good influence on you." He leaned back, enjoying Sherlock washing him. "Then again, I think it was a mutual exchange."
It was strange to see this woman, who just yesterday was being nice to them, turn around and sound so accusitory. The longer she acted this way, the more defensive John felt. "Yes. Because they were attacking him."
John panted heavily, stumbling back towards the bed until he could collapse back into it. "Oh shit...Oh Sherlock..." He closed his eyes and swallowed, trying to calm down.
No sex that he had ever had before could even compare to this one moment. John rocked into Sherlock's hand, the friction of his hand and cock driving him wild. With his hands now free, John could explore Sherlock's body, hands roaming over the smooth skin.
He knocked on the door and was shown to the backyard where he was told Sherlock had gone. John knew immediately he must be in the clearing and he walked through the woods, finding Sherlock asleep amongst the flowers. With the bouquet behind his back, John got down on his knees and kissed him.
John smiled sheepishly at Sherlock's mother and shook her hand. "It's very nice to meet you, ma'am. I'm John Watson. You have a wonderful house." He flushed slightly as Sherlock pulled the chair out for him and he sat down. He smiled, trying to be as polite as possible. It was while since he had last used truly proper manners. He forced himself not to rest his elbows on the table as he usually did.
... John," Sherlock moaned and widened his stance, changing the angle so he could hit his lover's prostate straight on. "Fuck, you're so good... I love seeing your face while I take you," he murmured. He placed one of his hands on John's back, running it down the length of his spine.
Mr. Watson shook Sherlock's hand firmly. "Good to see you, son."
Ms. Rodin sighed, "the truth... right. That includes
Sherlock felt tears come to his eyes, "no..." he said weakly. Sebastian tightened his grip on Sherlock's throat, "I told you to stay away from him, he's not like you," he growled before punching Sherlock in the jaw.
Helen nodded and shrugged, "didn't you find it a bit suspicious that she asked to speak with you privately?"
John smirked, shivers running down his spine. He let go of Sherlock's arse so he could smack it. "Even if I punish you, I have a feeling you won't learn your lesson," he said, with another spank. He moved his lips to Sherlock's neck, biting down on the pale skin.
"Oh, hey, sexy thing. Ya ran off 'fore I coul' get ya numbah." John recoiled at the stench of alcohol on her and shook his head, moving on to someone else. But the whole dance floor seemed to smell like booze. Was everyone here that drunk or was it just his sensitivity to it that made it seem so bad?
Sherlock moaned softly and tried to keep from bucking his hips up. His hands clenched tightly into fists and he kissed John back hungrily. "John..." he breathed against his lover's mouth and leaned his head up to nip playfully at his bottom lip.
John followed soon after, snuggled warmly with Sherlock and completely relaxed.
John felt his chest swell at how sweet Sherlock was being with him. Each spot that Sherlock kissed felt better, better than they had felt with any painkiller he had been given. "I love you, too, Sherlock," John said, tilting up to kiss him one more time, chastely. "Very much."
John leaned back into Sherlock, sighing in happiness. He could stay like this forever, in the most beautiful place he'd ever seen, in the arms of the boy he lo-...John's thoughts stopped there. Was he already falling in love with Sherlock? He glanced up at him, taking in his handsome face, his unreal eyes, and that adorable mop of curls. His heart skipped a beat and he turned pink. Oh yes. He could definitely be falling in love, hard and fast.
Sherlock started to panic, this must be how John felt whenever Sherlock had an episode. Remembering what John had done for him, he grabbed his boyfriend's face and started to kiss him as firmly as he could. "John... Please, wake up!" he shouted in between kisses.
When he did finally put his mouth around him, John bucked up, but only the tip stayed in. He moaned loudly, hand gripping Sherlock's hair. "Ohhh, more, please..."
John blushed again and looked down at the ground. "I never said anything. He must have guessed since we've had so many sleepovers." He got onto the bike and moved up for Sherlock, trying to quell his embarrassment.
There was a knock at the door and Sherlock stayed still. He nudged John in the back. "I think it's your father... If I'm right, you should be the one to respond," he whispered.
John rolled his eyes fondly at Sherlock. He looked around again, not even knowing where to start. He was never really good with style. Jeans and jumpers were a staple for him. He started going through the clothes, looking for something that he might look good in. "I really don't know what I'm even looking for, Sherlock," he said after a moment, turning back to him. "You're the one who knows how to dress well. Help me out."
Sherlock shook his head and cupped John's cheek, "no, love... you did
John didn't understand how Sherlock could do that, but he wiped the tear away when he saw it. "It's all right, Sherlock. Don't cry." He leaned up to kiss him gently and then buried his face in Sherlock's neck. "How can you possibly get rid of your memories?" he asked, curious.
John panted, heart thumping loudly against his ribs as he watched Sherlock take off his pants with his teeth of all things. "Fuck, that's hot..." He let his head fall back as he felt Sherlock's lips on him, but a moment later looked down at Sherlock and whined at the lack of attention to where he needed it most. He fought against Sherlock's hands but the boy was stronger than he looked. His pent up movements channeled their way upwards to his throat, culminating in a low moan of frustration.
John hummed and wrapped his arms around Sherlock. "Yeah. Nightmares." He closed his eyes and found himself thinking he could easily fall asleep standing up as long as he was with Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
John watched in awe as Sherlock brought himself to orgasm just by listening to him. He moved over to kiss his ear when he finally finished and then laid his head on Sherlock's shoulder. "That was extremely hot, by the way," he said, tracing patterns on Sherlock's chest.
Mr. Holmes followed John out of the house and helped him into the back of the ambulance before getting into his own car to follow them to St. Bart's. He felt overwhelmingly guilty. How could he not have known what his son had been dealing with at school? He vowed to himself to be there for his son more than he had been.
John made his way inside, leading Sherlock down the hall to the left where the bedrooms were. He opened his bedroom door and went in. It was a small room, not much besides a bed and bookshelf. There was also a small nightstand and a closet, which made up the rest of the space. John turned to look at Sherlock and shrugged half-heartedly. "Well, here it is."
Mycroft smiled at John, "thank you," he said softly. After a few moments, he stood, "I'm going to talk to the doctors, see how long he'll have to stay." He walked towards the door and opened it, but turned back before he was fully out of the doorway. "Talk to him... that's the best way to let him know," he said with a grin and walked away.
Sherlock frowned, but kept listening and hugged John tighter. He knew this was something that was hard for his fiancé to talk about and wanted to give him what support he could.
Sherlock led John up some stairs and around a corner, looking both ways before taking him outside to a balcony. The view was perfect from here, he'd been on tours here before and knew that this particular balcony had a gorgeous view of London. He took John over to the railing and wrapped his arms around his waist, leaning his head on the shorter boy's shoulder and looking out at the city.
Sherlock beamed at John and after he was done getting his hair rinsed he leaned down and gave his fiancé a heartfelt kiss. "Thank you, love. That means a lot coming from someone as wonderful as you."
John kissed him back with what little energy he could muster. "Mm... I wonder if I'll be able to walk tomorrow," he said with a soft chuckle. He stroked his fingers down Sherlock's cheek. "I love you so much."
"Scarves should be fine. I don't want to hurt you." John moved to Sherlock's hips and held him still, smirking. "Not yet, my love." He nudged Sherlock off of his lap and stood up.
Sherlock calmed down gradually with each kiss, relieved that John was staying, and after a few minutes he shook his head. "No... I just..." he sighed shakily, "it's okay if you don't want to... be with me. I just don't want you to leave." He bit his lip and looked away nervously. "I've never kissed anyone before that..." he said quietly, not sure if he even wanted John to hear him.
John nodded. "That's okay. Mycroft and I have an understanding," he said with a faint smile. He squeezed Sherlock's hand and they passed through the house out to his bike. "Maybe if things go well, my da could come to dinner. Meet the in-laws sort of thing." John blushed a little after saying that. At the rate they were going they would definitely be getting married at some point. He smiled and climbed on the bike, making room for Sherlock behind.
John felt a little better seeing Mrs. Holmes and he hugged her back tightly. It was almost like how it used to feel giving his own mother a hug. He pulled away and looked into her eyes, seeing the same guilt that he had heard in her voice. Sherlock had said that they barely spent any time with him... "I didn't think anything like this would happen or I would have said something," he said. "I have to confess, Sherlock and I didn't meet exactly how we said we did."
"Mmm," Sherlock mumbled in his sleep and held John tighter, nuzzling the top of his head. He didn't want to wake up and he didn't want to move. He'd never been more comfortable than he was right now.
John nodded. "I'll let Mary know. I don't even know half the people that were at that party, but she will." He just hoped that she would be able to tell everyone. Though maybe most of them wouldn't remember anyway because they were so sloshed.
Sherlock smiled, "and a hot tub... And a sauna," he said and kissed John on the cheek. "I'd really like to have you in one of those places," he murmured softly and nipped playfully at the other boy's lower lip.
John kissed Sherlock again at the sight of that smile. "I don't know how, but you just managed to be super sexy and super adorable at the same time." He trailed his hand back down Sherlock's torso and paused at his hip. "If you're really alright, we'll keep going."
he thought, intrigued by John. He found himself analyzing him without thought, taking in his full appearance, but looking away after his thoughts took a more personal turn. He had always known he preferred males over females, although he had never been involved with either romantically, but this was not the time to let his look linger too long. He still wasn't sure how John would react to that sort of attention.
John spent the entirety of his waiting time just thinking in silence. All he wanted was Sherlock, to know that he was definitely alright. Alive. When the nurse came out he let out a breath that he hadn't realised he was holding, and jumped up to follow her back.
John cried out, though the sound was muffled by Sherlock's cock. He bucked his hips, trying to control himself so as not to hurt Sherlock. He relaxed, but felt himself tense again in pleasure as Sherlock started to thrust his fingers, hitting his prostate which resulted in a choked cry. He decided to do the same to his lover, pushing his second finger inside and pumping, curling them so they scraped his inner walls.
," he breathed and whimpered, still desperate for
Ms. Rodin nodded and smiled over at John again. "Now tell the court about the events leading up to the second attack on Sherlock."
John's blush slowly quelled and he leaned back, joining in Sherlock's laughter. "Imagine if he had actually walked in!" He turned around and pressed his forehead into Sherlock's shoulder as he let himself laugh, more heartily than he had in a while.
John moved closer as Sherlock pulled him and he kissed him back fervently. As Sherlock's hand wrapped around him, he bucked into it, hips out of his control. And when Sherlock pressed both of them together...
Sherlock's mother burst through the door with her husband and ran to John's side. "John! Oh thank god you're all right," She sighed and hugged him close, tears streaming down her face. "It's going to be okay... Sherlock's a fighter, I know that much about my boy," she said with guilt and a hint of pain in her voice.
sexy right now.
John didn't like the way the doctor had spoken. He didn't like the way that the doctor took Mr. Holmes aside. He didn't like the look on his face. Mr. Watson looked at John and could read his thoughts exactly. He bent to hug his son and smoothed a hand over his hair. "I'm sure everything is fine," he said. But John just buried his face in his father's shoulder and tried not to think about anything but seeing Sherlock's face again. Eyes open and smiling. Saying his name.
John couldn't help a little smirk as he watched Sherlock walk. He had
Sherlock gradually started working John harder and could feel his own cock twitch at the look and sound of his husband. He let out a soft groan of his own and bit his lip. He alternated between twisting his wrist and swiping his thumb over John's slit as he tried to bring him to completion.
John stayed snuggled into Sherlock's side as they rode home. He hugged him back, cheek nestled on Sherlock's shoulder. "I know, love. I wish I could too." Especially after the night before, he didn't want to leave Sherlock alone overnight to have another nightmare. John pulled back after a moment, taking Sherlock's face in both hands. "I want you to call me, alright? If you have a nightmare or even if you just can't sleep, I want you to call me."
Sherlock grinned, "yeah? I mean... I know it was fantastic for me, but I've never done anything sexual before," he said and chuckled. He pulled John closer to him and nuzzled into his hair.
Sherlock felt all the air leave his lungs and he dropped his violin. "Let's go. Now," he said and ran towards the door. Mycroft grabbed his car keys and followed Sherlock outside, dashing to the car and speeding off to the hospital where John was taken.
When the dishes were done, John took Sherlock's hand and brought him back to his room. "Would you want kids, Sherlock?" he asked. It was something he hadn't really thought about before, but now that he was with a boy, the process would be a bit more difficult.
John rolled his eyes. "It doesn't matter how fast we get on the plane, love. It still takes off at the same time and takes the same amount of time to fly." He smiled with reddened cheeks at the stewardess, then hid his face.
"It's the least I could do for the love of my life," Sherlock said softly and tilted his head up to kiss John on the lips.
Sherlock sighed, "he said 'I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to make John a freak like you.' and he told me that I better back off."
John moved up Sherlock's thigh, passing over his groin without stopping, and then hit the other with the same attention. He was going to make Sherlock crazy, he knew, but it was too much fun. John moved back to the center, lips inches from Sherlock's cock. "Lift your hips for me."
John panted heavily with the force of the orgasm, nearly collapsing on top of Sherlock. He kissed him back, mind still only half working, so he had no idea what Sherlock was saying before they kissed again. He rolled them onto their sides and pulled out of Sherlock so that he could pull off the condom and toss it away.
Sherlock grinned widely and dunked one of his hands under the water. He grabbed onto John's crotch and started stroking him underwater through his trunks.
, the only one to ever try to find me. The only one to work to break down the walls I had built..." He lifted one of John's hands and placed it over his heart, "and you are the only one to ever hold my heart," he whispered and smiled lovingly up at his fiancé, the love of his life and the most important and perfect person in his eyes.
Sherlock didn't want to go too far in the back of the limo with the driver just a few feet away, but he did pull John onto his lap. He pulled away from the kiss and decided to give his fiancé some teasing right back. He leaned in to whisper in his ear, "when I get you home, I want you to fuck me in the shower. I've been thinking
"That..." Sherlock breathed, "was the most
... so am I," Sherlock moaned out as John's fingers pushed against his prostate. He groaned and rocked his hips harder, starting to vibrate his fingers against his lover's prostate. "Oh... Ohhh, John!" He cried out and his hips started jerking sporadically through his release, spilling across both of their abdomens.
Sherlock pushed John until he was laying on his back and rested his head under the shorter boy's chin. He drew patterns on John's chest with his finger, "Mmm... Anything?" he smirked and looked up at John. He suddenly knew exactly where he wanted to take John tomorrow, but he wanted it to be a surprise.
you're
John kissed Sherlock back, pouring his love for Sherlock into it. He wrapped his arms around the other boy's neck. No, his fiance's neck. That sounded so nice. He pulled away, and gave Sherlock a few quick, soft kisses before opening his eyes and smiling at him. "Now I just need to get you a ring."
John smiled, kissing him in return. He tried to ignore the aching between his legs. He'd driven Sherlock pretty hard, so he didn't expect him to reciprocate. Although, he didn't think that he'd be able to make this erection go down... "Hey Sherlock...Want to watch me?" he asked with a smirk.
"So when you returned, you just ran up and started attacking the boys surrounding Sherlock, correct?" Helen was pacing back and forth now, hands clasped behind her back. Sherlock was feeling a bit intimidated by now and he wasn't even being questioned. He could only imagine what John was going through.
John rubbed the towel over himself, ruffling his hair so that it stood up at odd angles. "I do too. I think I'd figure out a way to transfer the both of us for our safety." He glanced down at the floor for a moment, remembering Sherlock laying there in his own blood, the gunshot ringing in his ears, and he shivered. "It's sick," he said, only half meaning to let it out loud. "What drives a person to be so violent?" John looked back up to Sherlock, who had been so close to not being here in this moment, or any moment for that matter.
When John's father got the call, he paled and nearly fainted. He didn't even tell his boss where he was going as he ran from the building, and nearly sprinted all the way to the hospital. He felt just...terrible. He kicked his son out of the house, and now he had been beaten within an inch of his life. If John... No, he wouldn't think like that. He went straight to the emergency room and demanded to see his son.
Sherlock hugged John back just as hard and kissed every part of his face he could reach. "We did it..." he murmured, happy tears running down his face. Ms. Rodin smiled and took Mr. Watson's hand, "It was my pleasure. Always good to see a monster like that put behind bars." She kept holding Hamish's hand long after was necessary and finally let go with a blush on her face, "sorry.. um..." She patted both boys on the back, "you both did so well," she said.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand and smiled at him before ringing the doorbell. Mary answered the door smiling, "hey boys! So glad you could make it, come on in!" She led them through the house where there were a few couples snogging already and out to the back where a DJ station was setup along with a full bar, snack table and a huge dance floor with lights.
This was actually news to John as he was pretty sure no one had told him what happened after he'd blacked out. When Ms. Rodin asked about the shooting...He already felt the lump building in his throat and he swallowed thickly to try to get himself together. "That morning..." he started. "I had slept over Sherlock's the night before, and we were about to have a shower. Then out of nowhere, Sebastian was there behind us."
After a long moment, he pulled away and panted lightly. "Do you...have anything?" he asked, referring to condoms or even just lube. It was Sherlock's first time and John's first time with a boy, so it was best to be as safe and gentle as possible
Sherlock groaned and moved his hips faster, "yes... so close. Finish with me, love," he murmured. He could feel himself nearing the edge and held on as long as he could before he was crying out his release. He whimpered as he came back down, slumping back onto the bed.
"John...
Sherlock laughed and pressed his lips to John's cheek, spreading the suds all over his face. He kept kissing him until they were both covered in suds. "Hmm... I think you missed a spot," he said and smirked. He slid his hand down the center of his fiance's back and let his fingers graze lightly across the middle of his arse.
John whimpered and pushed towards Sherlock's fingers. All of his attention to Sherlock had left himself wanting. "Please...fuck me, please..." He buried his face in Sherlock's neck and rocked into him again.
John bit down on Sherlock's neck out of reflex. He was close too, the sensations all coming together in a whirl of amazing pleasure. He bucked hard against Sherlock, trying to get more friction from his hand and length. "F-fuck...ah...Sh-Sherlock..."
John smiled faintly. "Do you even have to ask?" He paused for a moment before asking, "Are you ready? The lawyer is probably going to push you to testify." He was sure Sherlock's father would stay there with them to make sure the lawyer didn't pressure them, but lawyers could be conniving.
Sherlock nodded, "I, um... I haven't had time to really prepare a... a speech or anything, but," he took the ring out of the box, a simple gold band, and held it up. "I... love you, very much," he smiled at his boyfriend nervously, "and I want to spend the rest of my life loving you. I don't care who doesn't accept us, I don't care what other people will think. All I care about... is right here in front of me. John Watson... will you marry me?" Sherlock could feel his heart pounding in his chest as he kept his eyes fixed on John's face, waiting for his answer. John's eyes were watering by the end of the speech and he took the ring gently from Sherlock's hand. He slipped it on his finger, a perfect fit, and smiled at him. "How could I ever say no to you?" He threw his arms around Sherlock's neck and kissed him firmly. He pulled back and stared into Sherlock's bright blue eyes. "I love you so much. I never thought that I could fall in love so quickly with someone, but like you said, you are the other half of me. Whether we met now, twenty years from now, or ten years earlier I know that things would have been the same. And I cannot imagine ever being apart from you."
John smiled, leaning back against Sherlock. He was glad for the support as this was the first time he'd talked about it with anyone. Even when with his father they tried to avoid the subject. "Well...Harry is ten years older than me, so I was pretty young when a lot of this happened. I don't remember every single detail perfectly."
John grinned and nodded. "Sounds good." He finally took his shoes off, feeling more comfortable, and sat on the edge of the bed. And oh...That was very nice. His bed at home was like a rock compared to this. "You know, you said to make myself at home and I think I might just do that," he said cheekily, pulling himself fully onto the bed and laying down with a laugh. He sprawled over the quilt, letting the plush warmth envelope him. "I'm rather jealous of your bed."
John squirmed and moaned, still half-asleep. He didn't know if this was a dream or real so he just kept his eyes closed and didn't try to fully wake up. Sherlock's mouth was warm and talented, and he tilted his head over, trying to give him more skin. He really hoped it wasn't a dream. He wanted the mark that would inevitably be left by the attention to the spot. As Sherlock started kissing his face, John's eyes fluttered open at last and he smiled up at Sherlock.
," Sherlock moaned, feeling himself get even closer to his climax. "M-me too... come with me, love," he breathed and wrapped his hand around John's and helped jerk his cock faster.
John's chest warmed at Sherlock's words, and he hugged him back just as tightly. But at the end he shook his head. "Come on, Sherlock. I'm nothing that special. I get B's in most of my classes. I'm short. I'm blonde and blue-eyed, a common combination. I don't have any special talents or skills. I'm just average. But you, Sherlock...God, I mean, I'm the lucky one here. You're so special, so unique and different. You're gorgeous, dark hair and blue or green or whatever colour eyes that you have. They change, you know, I can't keep up with them. And you're tall and sexy, and you're so brilliant. You're a treasure, a real diamond in the rough. I'm just the lucky one that found you first."
"Just now," John said, putting his hands on Sherlock's shoulders when he was pulled into the other boy's embrace. "It was just a joke, I didn't mean anything by it." He playfully licked Sherlock's nose.
sex... we've ever had." He wrapped his arms loosely around his husband. He tilted his head to the side so he could press a kiss to the other man's temple.
," John said, keeping his gaze locked with Sherlock's. "I wouldn't have made it," he admitted quietly.
"Yes, indeed," Mr. Watson agreed. "I must admit it was a shock to me at first. John's never really expressed any interest in, well, boys."
shit... Gimme a minute," he breathed. Every feeling was intensified because of the fact he wasn't wearing a condom this time. He breathed deeply in through his nose and squeezed his eyes shut.
Sherlock kissed the top of John's head, "It's okay, love... It's alright," he soothed.
Sherlock moaned softly into the kiss, so overtaken by the love in it that he felt like he was drowning. A good kind of drowning though, and John was there to keep him grounded. He pulled away after a while with a gasp and rested their foreheads together. Not a word was said, because nothing could ever come close enough to express how much he loved John. He slid down until he was lying flat on his back with his lover straddling him.
Sherlock smirked and turned to press a kiss to John's forehead, "you know you love it, though," he murmured. He eased John's trousers open and slipped his hand inside, wrapping his fingers around him. His hand was still stroking through the other man's pants, and he was using just enough pressure to tease.
Taking a deep breath, he spoke. "Sir, I just want you to know you have raised an amazing son. He is kind, caring and wise. We never expected to feel this way about each other, or even meet, but we did... He has saved my life twice in the past few days and I am forever grateful for that."
Sherlock moaned into the other man's mouth, laying back and pulling John with him. He rocked his hips down onto his lover's finger, desperately wanting more.
Sherlock moaned, still half asleep, but once he figured out what his boyfriend was doing he smirked. He lay perfectly still and tried to keep his breathing even so John would think he was still sleeping.
Mrs. Holmes chuckled under her breath, "all right, I think I've done enough damage for now. Dinner will be ready in an hour boys, be sure to wash up." She patted John on the back and leaned down to kiss the top of Sherlock's head as she walked away. "Such good boys," she murmured and smiled.
Mr. Watson cleared his throat a little and John flushed, pulling his hand back from Sherlock's face. He tried to push himself up, wincing at the pain that shot through his body. "Um...thanks, Da. You don't know how much it means to me that you're here."
John grinned and moved his chair closer to Sherlock's, keeping a hold of his hand. His father and Helen took the seats next to him, and Sherlock's family sat on the other side of the table next to his husband. For a fleeting moment, he wished that Harry were here as well, but he knew that she'd be watching and smiled at the thought.
Irene shrugged, "I just came to talk that's all," she smiled sweetly at him and leaned a bit closer. "I had a question for you actually... You said that even if Sherlock was a girl, you would still love him, right?"
Sherlock squeezed John's hand tightly, standing a little in front of him. "It's not his fault... He was just saying what he had to... the truth."
"Gladly, husband," Sherlock said and winked down at John. He carried him through the house and off to the bedroom. Then, he laid his husband down on the bed gently and straddled his hips. He leaned down and kissed the other man deeply, taking his time and really enjoying it.
"Thanks... John." Sherlock almost called him 'love', but the look on his father's face when they walked in made him refrain from using the term. "And thank you for having me, Mr. Watson," he said and smiled nervously at him. He didn't want to admit it, but he was a little intimidated by John's father and he didn't want to mess anything up by saying or doing the wrong thing.
Sherlock let John go, but kept his face close to his ear. "Yes, John. I'm right here, I need you to wake up, okay? Just wake up for me, love," he murmured softly.
John turned to Sherlock and smirked before opening his mouth and taking in the piece of popcorn. He let his tongue swipe over Sherlock's fingers, licking off the butter and salt and pulling off them with a pop.
When the door sounded, Mr. Watson got up and opened it. "Ah, I had a feeling you'd be coming," he said with a sad smile. "He's in his room." Stepping aside, he let Sherlock in.
John bit hard onto his hand, crying out so loudly that it didn't seem to help that he had his fist in his mouth. He pushed up towards Sherlock's warm, wet mouth, body trembling.
"Want to play another round? Or..." Sherlock sat his controller down and moved to straddle his lover's lap, "would you rather go to my room and collect your prize?" He leaned in and nipped John's earlobe, breathing hotly on the wet skin afterward.
Sherlock refused to move, he wasn't going to leave John to face this alone. Sebastian's grip on the gun got tighter. "Shut up! Just shut up! It's all your fault! You fucking
Once John had left, Sherlock pulled out his mobile and dialed, "Hello, Mycroft? Yes... I think we'll be needing to follow through on that favour. I'll let you know for sure this evening." He hung up the phone and sighed, praying that for once he wasn't right.
John kissed Sherlock in return, slowly and lovingly. He pulled away and smiled up at him, bringing one hand to cup his cheek. "Are you feeling better?" he asked softly.
..." Sherlock winked and let his eyes travel down to John's crotch, then looked back up with an eyebrow raised suggestively.
"Harry came down, drunk already. I guess she had a stash in her room. She came over to me...and she told me we were going for a ride. I didn't want to go, but she dragged me out and put me in the car, in the front seat no less. I was terrified because I knew she was dangerous like that, but she drove off before I could jump out of the car. Then she started talking, barely making sense, but she said something about wanting to take me away from Da, that he didn't understand."
Sherlock was shaking in anticipation by the time they got to the airport and almost took out a family of four dragging John and their luggage to the gate. "Come on, John... do I have to carry you?" he said, sprinting towards the line to get on the plane.
"God, yes, Sherlock..." John reached down, leaning back a little to get to the spot Sherlock told him. He moved his finger over the skin, gasping at how sensitive it was there, and had to fight himself not to go back further. "Oh, Sherlock... more, please..."
Mary kept searching, both of them calling out Sherlock's name repeatedly. She thought she heard something and stopped, focusing in the direction she heard what sounded like someone sobbing. "Shhhh..." she said, holding out her hand towards John, "do you hear that? Sounds like it's coming from the linen closet..."
Mr. Holmes pulled out the chair for his wife and smiled lovingly at her as she was seated. He reached across the table and held out his hand to John, "It's very nice to meet you finally, John. I've heard such great things about you," he said and smiled.
Sherlock's father watched John run away before hoisting himself up off the floor and walking over to the lead detective. "You find that son of a bitch and you make him pay. No matter what it takes," he said firmly, his jaw set and eyes intense. The detective nodded, "yes, sir."
Sherlock pulled away from the kiss and sucked on John's lower lip before letting it go. "God, you're so gorgeous," he said huskily. "I just love the way you look when you're like this, so open and vulnerable... All for me."
John made a soft sound and moved his hips harder, already feeling like he had half an erection. "I know just what you mean," he said, voice deep. "Whenever I see you I have to stop myself from getting hard. You're just...unbelievable. I just love your body, your skin, your shape. I love the feeling of being pressed up against you." He dipped his head down to bite Sherlock's pulse. "No one else has ever made me feel like this. Ever."
John moaned softly, his own hips moving to meet Sherlock's. It had been over a week by now and he was a bit extra sensitive.
Sherlock let out a long moan, "It's a good thing... We both have such a hunger for each other. We'll never get tired of it... or bored... or want anyone else," he breathed and nipped at John's earlobe again.
John's movements sped a little, especially as he could feel Sherlock getting a bit desperate. He continued to thrust into Sherlock, each movement bringing him that much nearer to the edge. "Sh-Sherlock...s-so close..." he gasped before kissing him again, sloppily but hungrily. With a few quicker and just a bit harder thrusts, John cried out into the kiss and climaxed, staying inside of Sherlock as he felt himself fully release.
John obeyed, taking in his fingers and sucking them, imagining they were Sherlock's length. He lolled his tongue around them, making sure they were good and soaked.
"Oh, God...Oh, Sherlock!" John was so close, he was literally shaking. He cried out again and again, getting closer and closer. And then Sherlock's hand was on him and he was moving faster, pushing John over completely. He came hard and fast, thrusting into Sherlock's mouth.
fucking hot..." He leaned his head back, stretching out his neck to give John better access to the skin there.
When Sherlock finally came, he looked up at him with watery eyes and shook his head, pulling the other boy into him.
John hummed and kissed him again, fingers dipping under Sherlock's pants to slip them down his long legs. He then brought his fingers up, between their lips, and pressed them to Sherlock's kiss-swollen mouth.
John's face heated a little and he headbutted Sherlock gently in the chin. "After so long, most couples would lose their spark, wouldn't they?" he said softly. "But not us. I wonder what makes us so different."
Mr. Watson looked back at Sherlock and could see the fierceness in his eyes. His son was in good hands. "Welcome to the family, Sherlock," he said quietly.
Sherlock pulled back when he felt the need to breathe grow too strong to ignore anymore. He left only a little space between their faces as he panted against his lover's lips. "I love you so much," he breathed.
John didn't even notice Sherlock get up, snuggling further into the plush bedding. He was dreaming that Sherlock had wings and was flying with him through the sunset. But then as Sherlock got on top of him and started kissing him, he made a sound and wiggled a little. "Mmm, Sher..." he mumbled in his sleep.
Sherlock nodded and gave the bartender his order, deciding on getting the same thing as John. He took a sip of his drink and looked out over the crowd again, almost choking on his drink when he saw
"Oh, God...Oh, fuck, Sherlock!" The clenching of his lover around him, the sight and sound of him succumbing to the pleasure, all brought John to his climax and he spilled into Sherlock. He thrust through it, getting out all he could, then finally collapsed on top of his husband, panting.
John started moving faster, moving one of his hands down to stroke his own cock. He still marveled at the fantastic feeling of not having a condom between them. It was a bit more rough, but it really made them able to
me. Again... and again... And I..." He couldn't speak anymore, just held John close and screwed his eyes shut, trying to focus on his fiance's words and soothing touches.
At the end of the school day, Sherlock walked hand in hand with John out to the car and kept his arm around him as they rode to his flat. When they pulled into the lot, he hugged the other boy close, "I wish you could come over again," he murmured.
John was about to say something when Sherlock's mother came out to bring them into the dining room. He sighed and took Sherlock's arm, giving it an extra squeeze as they went inside.
John loved the way the two of them fit together. He could fully sheath himself inside of Sherlock, his lover's inner walls closing perfectly around him, and make them one whole piece. He felt fully complete, more than he usually did when he was with his lover.
Sherlock hummed happily and kissed John back just as hard. He pulled back with a smile and leaned in to kiss him a few more times, soft and quick.
Sherlock nodded, "the worst of the pain is gone, thankfully. I'm pretty sure you wiped away almost all traces of it this morning," he said and chuckled. He pulled John close to him and kissed him again, lingering longer this time, but holding back from letting it get much more intense.
The song used in this chapter is Glass by Thompson Square
Sherlock smiled and cupped John's cheek, "thank you, love," he whispered and kissed him on the lips softly, deepening it for a moment before pulling away. "We don't have to do it today if you don't want to, it can wait a bit longer if that makes you more comfortable."
Sherlock frowned when he heard what John said, but felt marginally better when he said that he loved him no matter what. Irene smirked, "interesting..." she looked back and forth between the two boys and walked off, swaying her hips a little.
Sherlock gasped and bucked his hips up once. "Yes... I'm yours, John. Always yours," he whimpered and bit his lip.
Sherlock grinned and held John close, running his fingers through his hair, trying to soothe him to sleep. He went to sleep shortly after, smile still on his face.
"Oh...shit, Sherlock..." John moaned softly then put his fist to his mouth to bite and muffle the sound. Not that it wouldn't be obvious to his father anyway what they were doing up here. He couldn't see the mark that Sherlock had left on his neck, but he was sure that it would look fresh when they came down for supper. He laid back on his hands, spreading his legs a bit wider.
Sherlock shrugged, "I don't know, I just... Didn't want you to think that I was weak." He sighed and rested his head on John's shoulder.
John was surprised when Sherlock's mother teased him about not having friends, but then he remembered that Sherlock had said his parents didn't ever spend time with him. They didn't know. He snuck his hand onto Sherlock's knee, giving it a gentle squeeze. As Sherlock explained how they met, specifically leaving out the part about the rugby team, he just smiled and nodded in agreement. "Thank you, Mrs. Holmes. That's very kind of you."
Sherlock gasped and let go of the beaker, sending it crashing to the table. He cleared his throat, "sorry... Mrs. Hooper, my fault. Hands are a little shaky today." He glared playfully at his fiancé and went to grab some towels to clean up the mess. "At least it was only water," he murmured as he wiped the table and tried to hold back his laughter.
John squeezed Sherlock's hands, using his position to hold him in place. This was a moment he never wanted to forget. Their first time making love as a married couple. He slowly started thrusting, his own tongue tangling with Sherlock's, the familiar taste of his filling his mouth.
He leaned forward once he was finished and pressed a firm kiss to his fiancé's lips. "Now cheer up or I'll be forced to tickle you relentlessly." Sherlock smiled and poked John's nose.
Sherlock gave John's rear a good smack as he walked out the door and chuckled, "yes, you had better... Or I may end up ravishing you before you have a chance to stop me." He winked at his fiancé and started getting dressed himself, settling on just a pair of sleep pants and his dressing gown.
John smiled fondly at Sherlock's expression and bent to kiss him again. He started opening his own shirt, not taking nearly as much time as he had with Sherlock's. Once his top half was bare, he straddled Sherlock again and pulled him up further so their chests were pressed together.
Mr. Watson frowned. "It's all going to work out," he said, seeming like he was trying to convince himself more than John. Then he stood and walked off to his room, getting changed for his next job. John just couldn't tell him. His father would be so disappointed. Flopping back on the couch, he closed his eyes, just wishing for tomorrow.
John kissed Sherlock back, giggling in between as the bubbles covered them. He pressed in close, their full naked fronts touching with only a thin layer of soap between. It wasn't too much of a surprise when Sherlock started to get cheeky. John let out a soft pleased sound and his hips pushed back a little on their own. "Don't tease me, love, or I'll be late for school," he warned.
John was breathing heavily, trying to calm down before people started thinking he was having an attack or something. He looked at Sherlock and nodded lazily, a wry grin spreading over his face. "You are one bad boy, Sherlock Holmes," he murmured, catching his lips. "My turn now."
He watched in surprise, though, at the short exchange between his fiance and their lawyer. Once again, Sherlock's genius had seen something he probably wouldn't have noticed himself. He squeezed his hand as she left the room and leaned over to peck him on the cheek. "That was very sweet of you," he said softly, resting his head on the other boy's shoulder.
"Sherlock, John... this is Helen Rodin, she will be the attorney representing you both." Helen stood and smiled, extending her hand.
Sherlock leaned down and pressed a kiss to John's lower back before finally pushing himself in. He threw his head back and groaned at the tight heat. "God... You feel so good around my cock," he breathed.
Sherlock sighed happily into the kiss, deepening it, but keeping it slow and loving. He pulled away with a smirk, "does that mean we can do it again sometime?"
Sherlock awoke with a soft hum and his eyes flickered open to look up at his wonderful fiancé. "Good morning, love," he mumbled sleepily and stretched his legs.
Sherlock took the scrap of paper, "sounds like a deal to me," he said and smiled. He gave John a tight hug and pressed a kiss on the top of his head, "see you Monday, yeah?" he murmured and pulled back, keeping his arms around the shorter boy's waist.
The next morning, Sherlock got dressed quickly and ran out the door, eager to get to school. He got in the car with Mycroft and buckled up. "Someone's eager today," Mycroft teased. "Shut up," Sherlock grumbled and they drove off.
Sherlock sighed, "I love you, too John. More than anything." He kissed the other boy again and pulled back, "I guess you better go before your father comes out and drags you in," he said softly and smiled.
He went back and changed into a pair of dark skinny jeans, a black, silk button up shirt and a pinstripe blazer. He added a pair of dress boots and walked out of the dressing room. "What do you think? Too much?" he asked, turning and biting his lip nervously.
Sherlock leaned forward and kissed the tear away. "I love you," he whispered and captured John's lips. He kept his hands on his hips, rocking up to meet him on every thrust.
, John... keep talking to me. I-I want to hear you," he moaned and closed his eyes, hips still rocking.
close to you in wealth." His next words just came out in a rush. "I live in a tiny flat and my father works two jobs and I can barely afford petrol for my bike most days." He looked up at Sherlock, worried that he would tell him to leave, that he couldn't be associated with someone who was poor.
John blinked in surprise as Sherlock fell over, and was confused by the sudden look of terror on his face. But at his words, he knew that he must have said something to accidentally set off his fiance. And it wasn't hard to figure out what. "Shit," he muttered, taking off after Sherlock. "Sherlock, stop!"
"Well, I had seen him that morning and he sort of gave us a look when we were kissing, but other than that, no, he didn't talk to us." John glanced at Sherlock for confirmation.
Sherlock watched him with narrowed eyes until he closed the door behind him and sighed, "let's go back to my room," he said and pulled John to him, wrapping his arms around the shorter boy's waist, "I'd quite enjoy continuing where we left off," he whispered huskily and smirked. He kissed John softly on the cheek, "don't worry, though. Only kissing tonight," he reassured him and began walking down the hall to the stairway.
... I need you." He bucked his hips up and wrapped his long fingers around John's hardened cock.
time." He looked back at his husband and winked before turning back to the gate. "Business or pleasure?" the stewardess at the gate asked. Sherlock smirked at John, "pleasure... definitely."
Sherlock whimpered into the kiss and grasped tighter to his lover's hips. He tugged at the hem of his jumper and pulled it up and off, reattaching their lips as soon as it was gone. He ran his hands all along John's torso and rocked his hips up once, trying to get friction for his growing arousal.
"Sebastian and Sherlock," John answered. "I managed to get between them and asked what was happening."
Sherlock decided to dive right in, he'd never been afraid to open up to John before. He took a deep breath, "I used to do drugs. Cocaine... mostly." He shook his head in shame and frowned, "the bullying from Sebastian that you witnessed is nothing compared to what I had to endure in the past. They would corner me in the showers after gym and..."
"Yeah, that's probably it," John said softly. He let himself be pulled to sit and caressed Sherlock's face with his free hand. "But everyone was pretty impressed with it. You're one hell of a dancer." He smiled down at his fiance, very happy to see him lucid once more.
They had to get away from him. There had to be a way out of this without getting hurt. He reached his hand back a little, trying to push Sherlock back further, telling him silently to leave.
John kissed Sherlock's chest and closed his eyes. "No, you won't." He yawned a little. Today had been rather exhausting.
John's eyes flew open as Sherlock flipped them and he stared up at the other boy, blinking to try and wake himself further. He sat up as Sherlock got off the bed and yawned before getting up to dress as well.
Mr. Watson started setting out the food and plates. "The sooner the better. Get that little bastard locked up." He sat down and served the two boys and then himself.
John kissed him back, leaning into his fiance's touch. "I love you, too." He laid his cheek in Sherlock's curls, closing his eyes. "Think we can squeeze a nap in before dinner? I'm exhausted."
Sherlock kissed his fiancé on the forehead, "Well then, you'll just have to be my bodyguard then, won't you?" He smiled at John and winked.
John was dying. He must have been because he was sweating and nauseous and lightheaded. Not to mention, he was trapped at the altar, so his nervousness was probably obvious to the billions of people that were sitting in the pews. He chewed on his bottom lip, ripping it to pieces before realising that he would have to kiss Sherlock with those lips later and he shouldn't ruin them. Instead he started tugging on his jacket sleeves, desperate for anything to distract him from how nerve-wracking this was.
Sherlock kissed his fiance on the nose and pulled away to look in his eyes, "do me a favour though... save the special treatments just for your future husband, hmm?" he said cheekily and grinned.
"Thought so," John said with a chuckle, readjusting his face to find a new spot on his husband's neck. He brought his other hand closer to Sherlock to open his trousers, now palming his cock through the thin fabric of his pants.
His father sighed and rubbed his face. "They're still trying to get me worked into the whole ordeal," he said. "But it should get better. How was your day?"
. Now leave me alone."
John grinned up at Sherlock. "Sure. If I'm not intruding or anything." So this was it. He was really making friends with Sherlock. He shouldn't have felt so excited about this, but he did. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that Sherlock was a handsome boy who actually seemed pretty genuine compared to everyone else he had met since transferring here. John jerked his head toward the door. "Let's go. I'll give you a lift if you tell me how to get there."
Ms. Rodin was shuffling papers and had moved all chairs but one to the other side of the room. She looked up as they entered and smiled, "John, take a seat here next to the table. Sherlock, I need you to sit over there." She pointed to one of the chairs at the far end of the room and Sherlock swallowed but obeyed, looking back nervously at John.
John nearly screamed, it felt so good. He worked down Sherlock's cock until he had completely engulfed the whole thing, groaning around it. Once he had taken it all in, he bobbed his head quickly, fingers still pressed far into Sherlock's arse. He twisted them as he thrust them in and out of his fiance, and then pushed in a third as Sherlock had done to him.
John was completely lost in the pleasure. Sherlock was just...oh, he could die. He let himself be taken over, his body reacting automatically and making his hips buck wildly. John cried Sherlock's name again, eyes squeezed shut, fists nearly ripping the sheets.
Mr. Holmes sighed, "well, you won't do him very much good if you pass out either," he said and chuckled. "How about this... I'll get a nurse to bring in another bed and we can have them pushed together. That way, you can get some rest, but still be here when he wakes up. What do you say?"
Sherlock could tell John was nervous about this afternoon and tried his best to be comforting. He tried getting his mind off it by helping him with schoolwork, but it didn't seem to be working very well. By the time the last bell rang, Sherlock was just as nervous as John. He grabbed the other boy's arm before they got into the car and pulled him into a tight embrace. "I love you, no matter what happens. You will always be my hero. Always," he murmured into John's hair.
John smirked a little and hummed against Sherlock's lips. "You're insatiable, Mr. Holmes," he teased.
When the DJ called for Sherlock and John to come to the dance floor for their first dance as a married couple, Sherlock eagerly led the other man over. He took John's hand, putting his other on one his waist as the violin piece he wrote all those years ago came through the speakers.
, he thought and focused on escaping deep into his mind palace to ignore the pain, as he always did. He didn't even hear the exchange between the other boys, too lost in his thoughts.
mouth again. "I'm glad that you're happy with me," he murmured against his lips.
John cursed himself. He shouldn't have said anything. He was stupid, bringing up that topic. "Sherlock, no, don't get upset." He crawled over to him and grabbed his hands. "Stay with me, Sherlock. Listen." He smoothed one hand over his hair. "I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. I'm not going anywhere, ok? I promise."
Sherlock groaned at the contact of their bare torsos and pulled John in for another impassioned kiss. He bucked his hips up, desperately needing some sort of friction for his aching arousal.
, his lover and his best friend. He left John as just one half that could never again be complete.
"John, Oh... So close, so
Sherlock instantly wrapped his arms around the other boy and tangled their legs together loosely. He ran his fingers through John's hair and pulled him in for a slow kiss, keeping it soft and loving. "I love you," he whispered and let his eyes take in every detail of his lover's face from this close up.
John was about to stop Sherlock when he started stroking himself, but he didn't think he could muster the energy to finish him after such a satisfying release. Besides that, the sight of Sherlock pleasuring himself, with the hand that was covered in him, was just too hot. He knew that he would have instantly been hard again just seeing this if he hadn't just came. But just because he wasn't the one doing it, didn't mean he couldn't make it like he was. "Twist your hand," he said softly, leaning up to whisper in his ear.
John jumped and grasped his backside, smirking at Sherlock as he followed him back to the bedroom. "And you call me a cheeky bastard," he muttered as he went to get his clothes together. He pulled on a pair of red pants and then his usual jumper and jeans before getting on his socks. He pulled out his mobile to check his messages and found one from his father.
John pulled Sherlock's trousers down to his knees, and then pulled away to look into his eyes. "I can leave the pants on, if you want," he said, voice husky. He wanted Sherlock to be comfortable and he didn't know how he felt about being completely exposed.
John tried to look at Sherlock's face, or get him to turn around, but he was solidly staying in his position. "Come on, love, I'm sorry. It's not that I don't want to do anything, but I was at your house for three nights." It didn't make sense for Sherlock to be this upset about him not giving into his desires. Unless it was something else..."Talk to me? Please?"
John grinned. "Yes, I guess I will." He tilted his head up to capture Sherlock's lips in a tender kiss.
John blushed a little, though whether it was the heat of the burner or Sherlock's closeness, he didn't know. But he was grateful for the help, because Sherlock didn't just give him the answers. He made him understand, and that in turn made it easier to understand other things. "You're quite the teacher, Mr. Holmes," he said, glancing back at Sherlock with a smirk.
John moaned a he was pressed to the cool glass, giving Sherlock as much skin as he could. He clutched at his fiance's shoulders, digging in his nails. "Sh-Sherlock...you're going to ruin my clothes," he breathed, hoping he knew what he was getting at.
John smiled up at him and pulled away to put on the shirt and sleep trousers that Sherlock had given him. They smelled like him and it felt like he was being hugged by the other boy all over. John slipped into the bed next to Sherlock and moved in close.
John closed his eyes, leaning as close into Sherlock's embrace as he could. "We drove for a long time...Harry kept swerving and speeding up and I started crying because I was so scared. I wound up crying myself to sleep after a while. I don't know what happened but when I next woke up..." His breath hitched and he took a moment to swallow.
John whimpered and spread his legs, pushing his hips up higher to get more of that glorious friction. "Yes, Sherlock! Oh, God..." He could feel a coil of heat in his stomach, signaling he was close. He turned his head to kiss wherever he could reach on the side of Sherlock's face as he rocked his hips faster. "Sher..'M close..."
"Yes, John... All of this," Sherlock slid his hand down his torso as he moved, "is yours.
John smirked and took the offered arm, kissing Sherlock on the cheek. "Happy Birthday, love," he said and handed the gift over to him.
Sherlock caught his breath and finally opened his eyes, looking at John and nodding slowly. "O-okay, I think I'm ready."
Sherlock kissed John back and bit his lip before nodding, "yes... I am," he said quietly. He let John pick him up off the ground and lead him back to the table. They rose when the judge came back in and sat back down again when he was seated.
John hung onto Sherlock, trying to calm his racing heart. He was never going to get back to sleep now. After a while he finally relaxed, slumping against Sherlock and breathing deeply. "I hate nightmares," he muttered. "I'm sorry."
Sherlock groaned and did as John told him, whimpering at the tone of his voice. He apparently had a thing for dirty talk during sex because just hearing his boyfriend was bringing him closer to his climax.
"I'm so glad to have you as part of our family now, John. I knew from the moment I saw you that you would become someone very special to my boy," Mrs. Holmes said. Tears came to her eyes as she spoke and she hugged John and kissed him on the cheek before walking away.
Sherlock winced a little as the paper towel grazed his nose, still sensitive to any sort of touch. "Ah, I, um... caught Sebastian cheating on an exam earlier this week and threatened to tell the professor... He didn't take too kindly to my observations, he rarely does. I should have known better than to provoke him, especially after last time..." Sherlock bit his lip and looked away, remembering how bad of shape he ended up in last time Moran had decided to 'teach him a lesson'.
"Ohhh, yes," Sherlock moaned and pushed down onto his lover's fingers. "I love you... S-so much, John," he whimpered and gripped tightly to the other boy's shoulders.
Sherlock closed his eyes at the feeling of John's lips on his neck and he moaned softly. After he had pulled John's clothing off, he began kissing every inch of skin he could. Memorizing every bit of him and noting what spots made his breath hitch and which ones made him moan.
Mr. Watson squeezed his shoulder. "I'm so sorry, John." John just closed his eyes, feeling tears coming on. "We have a few days so... you can say goodbye."
"It's not your fault, it's mine," Sherlock murmured, still looking out the window. He didn't mean to make John feel
the provoking you did and failed to tell me about... And not to mention, all the shit the defence brought up!" She groaned in frustration and sat down. "I just don't know what we can do to get the judge back on our side."
John hummed a little, the vibrations of his bike doing nothing to help. "It takes one to know one, love." He turned back slightly, reaching up to card a hand through Sherlock's hair once before turning forward again. He pulled out of the car park and started off for his flat.
John made a noise of frustration. Suits were so sexy and yet they were a pain in the arse when the actual sex came around. He started undoing his shirt, fumbling with the buttons and tossing his jacket off in the process.
much about it... I want you to pin me against the wall and feel the water sliding over our bodies as you pound into me."
Sherlock returned the kiss with equal fervor, grasping tightly to the other boy's shoulders as he thrust in and out of his body. He wrapped his legs around John's waist, pulling him closer, needing him deeper inside of him. He wanted to be completely surrounded by his lover and he pulled away from the kiss several moments later, gasping for breath.
John squeezed Sherlock's cock as he felt the twitches and used all his power to buck up into his lover. "You have no idea what you do to me, Sherlock. You're so fucking incredible." God, he was so close. But he wanted Sherlock to come first.
But even while basking in the humiliation of the rugby team being taken out by one short boy, he couldn't stop thinking about Sherlock. He would do whatever it took to make him feel better, he knew that much.
John was smiling a little, as Sherlock's deductions always made him do. "Fantastic," he said. Mr. Watson looked confused, but nodded slowly.
Sherlock slowly deepened their kisses, grasping tightly to John's hands. He caressed the other boy's tongue with his own, reacquainting himself with his feel and taste. He let go of one of John's hands, letting his hand slip under the hem of his boyfriend's shirt, sliding his fingers along the skin there. John pressed in as close as he could to Sherlock, swirling his tongue around Sherlock's as it invaded his mouth. He arched towards Sherlock's fingers, making a soft sound. Oh, how he wanted to go further, but he didn't want to push anything. He could be patient.
John held Sherlock close, pressing their foreheads together. "I couldn't have said that better myself."
Sherlock closed his eyes and soaked in each sound that came from John's mouth, biting his lip and moaning when he found his release. He kissed his boyfriend on the cheek before reaching down and popping open his own trousers. He pulled them down his hips with his clean hand and wrapped the hand covered in John's cum around his own cock and began stroking himself.
John looked up at Sherlock, resting his arms on the edge of the pool and kicking his feet absently. "Sounds good to me. You have magic hands, you know. I'm convinced it's from that violin playing." He moved to the steps, fixing his trunks on the way, and climbed out of the pool.
Sherlock nodded and smiled weakly up at John's father, "yes, I suppose that's true." He kept a hold of John's hand and reached with his other one to gently brush John's hair away from his face. "I'm here, love," he said softly, tears running down his face. All he could do now was wait patiently for his boyfriend to wake up.
John happily kissed Sherlock in return, a bit of pride welling in his chest when Sherlock called him a hero. Out of everything he wanted to be for Sherlock, one of the most important was to be his shield, to make sure he never got hurt.
"Well, you're still as sexy as when we first met," Sherlock said and smiled. He locked their lips together again and pulled back to rest their foreheads together. "I love you so much," he murmured.
"Okay, what happened while you were away with Mary?" Ms. Rodin continued after John was done speaking.
John licked his lips, kissing Sherlock firmly. "Watch it, Sherlock, or we'll never make it to the bathroom."
John couldn't resist that face. He swallowed thickly, his nausea not disappearing as of yet, and took his hand. "Sherlock," he said as a warning. "I'm really rubbish at dancing." They were walking onto the floor and his heart was pounding in trepidation. Already there were other couples, all looking graceful, dancing around them. He was definitely going to be sick.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, "yes, Mycroft... Do you have it?" Mycroft went inside his room and Sherlock heard some papers rustling, then footsteps.
Sherlock nodded, "It was good, nice to be back after spending the last couple weeks not being able to do anything but pace my room." He unfolded the napkin and placed it in his lap while he spoke, nervously re-adjusting it every few moments.
Even if they could find another place to live they probably would be living paycheck to paycheck. How would they eat, or buy clothes, or anything? He'd have to sell his bike, get a job, maybe even drop out of school. The more he thought about it, the worse he felt and he curled in on himself even further, crying as he waited for Sherlock.
Sherlock chuckled, "hey beautiful, how are you doing?" He started picking at the pillowcase next to him, smiling at the sound of his fiance's voice.
Sherlock could feel his own heart pounding as he thought about it again and bit his lip as he rocked his hips in a steady rhythm. He let his hand trail down the centre of John's torso and leaned in to whisper in his ear again. "Would you like that, John? Would you like to feel me inside you?"
John fought with Sherlock's tongue, pushing it back so that he could invade his mouth, even going so far as to nip the end of it. He gasped and squeezed Sherlock as he felt the pressure building around him and in another moment he had reached his climax, thrusting through it until he had fully released. He could hardly breathe with how hard he had come, and it took all of his strength not to collapse completely on top of Sherlock.
Finally, John excused himself as well and went to find Sherlock. He saw the bathroom door closed and knocked softly. "Sherlock?"
"Sherlock..." John leaned over into his side and grabbed his empty hand with his own. "I'm sure that there are at least some people at the party who want to be there for you. But I'm very glad that I can make you feel like you belong." He tilted his head up to kiss under Sherlock's jaw, feeling better. "Thank you. You always know just what to say." Sitting up, he raised his glass and smiled at Sherlock. "A toast, to my gorgeous, intelligent, perfect fiance on his eighteenth birthday. May there be many more to come."
Sherlock grinned and held his hand out for John to take and led him out onto the dance floor.
"You should have called, John. You scared me," he said a bit more calmly.
John moved to Sherlock's hips. He kissed across his lover's waist and stopped at the hip bone to bite the thin skin, leaving yet another mark. John licked the mark to soothe it then shifted down to settle between Sherlock's legs again. He nudged Sherlock's hips up and swooped under to lick at his entrance again teasingly.
John quickly joined Sherlock in sleep, whispering, "I love you, too." before fully drifting off. Luckily he didn't have any nightmares tonight, which was thanks to the presence of his fiance by his side.
John moaned, eyes rolling back in his head. "Fuck, Sherlock..." He reached down and cupped Sherlock's groin, squeezing lightly. "You're so big..." he breathed. "You make me feel so full."
Sherlock smiled sadly at his fiancé, "well... you at least don't have to worry about me drinking. I don't see the point in getting all knackered and waking up sick the next day." He nuzzled behind John's ear and kissed his neck, "you can just focus on me... I'll do my best to..." he nipped the other boy's earlobe," keep your attention."
John listened to Sherlock and could hear the depth of emotion in his voice, which matched the emotion in his eyes, and he felt his heart warming. It touched him that someone cared so much about him, and John found his eyes watering as he stared back into Sherlock's bright blue eyes. "I would do the same for you. You're the most precious thing in my life," he said, voice a little choked.
John smiled and bent down to kiss Sherlock's forehead, hand cupping his face. "I will. I'm going to borrow your clothes by the way, since I don't have any of mine but the ones I wore yesterday. I hope no one looks at me funny if I'm trying to catch your scent on them all through class." He winked and went to the closet to find something that would fit him. Once he'd gathered an outfit he headed for the door. "See you later. I love you."
John continued what he was doing, delighting in Sherlock's response. He licked over the mark and moved to another spot, starting again. If Sherlock stayed asleep much longer he would wind up covering his neck in marks.
Sherlock smiled and turned John around to look in his eyes and cup his cheek, "you would be okay with people at school knowing about us?" he asked, honestly surprised that John wouldn't want keep him a secret.
"Hey!" John flipped over, spluttering, and swam after Sherlock. He dove under the other boy and popped up in front of him, splashing him quickly and then diving away.
... John!" He pushed back against him with every thrust, rolling his hips in a steady rhythm.
"I simply wanted to remind you that your birthday gala will be coming up soon. Next Friday in fact." Mycroft said, door still closed. "Shit..." Sherlock mumbled under his breath, "tell them I don't want one!" He shouted. "Now, Sherlock... It's your eighteenth birthday, do you really think mummy and daddy would agree to cancel this year?"
Sherlock smiled when he heard his phone go off and replied.
"Come on, Sherlock. Come for me," he whispered. "I want you to scream my name." He pulled himself up enough to kiss Sherlock's neck, enjoying that just his voice alone could have such an effect on Sherlock. They would certainly have to try this again.
Mycroft waited for John to come out and closed the door behind him. "Okay... So maybe I should have mentioned that we also 'delete' parts of a memory we're uncomfortable with," he said quietly.
"Sherlock..." John rolled his eyes fondly. "I love you, darling, but I have to go. I wish I didn't have to."
Sherlock wrapped his arms around the other boy and pressed a kiss to his head. "No, love, you haven't... you did great." He pulled back and wiped the tears from John's eyes, looking him in the face. "Hey... I love you. You are
John swallowed. "That's sweet..." He couldn't help remembering that last night with Harry, eight years ago. He shook his head a bit not wanting to think about more tragedy so soon after one. "Besides, I wouldn't ever let anything happen to you. And I'll prove it to him, somehow."
(See the end of the chapter for
, yes... You always feel... So amazing inside of me," Sherlock panted and twisted his wrist on his cock, sliding his thumb over the slit again. "Fuck... I'm s-so close," he moaned and his hips bucked up into his fist.
John whined as Sherlock's fingers grazed in the cleft of his arse. He squeezed himself as he stroked and moved faster on his lover, slamming down to try and get a hit on his sweet spot. "I l-love you...oh, fuck...I love it when you-
Sherlock listened intently as John spoke, thanking whoever was out there watching over him that John had no previous knowledge of him before their first encounter. He was very glad to have John in his life now and didn't want to let him go. He nodded when John was finished speaking and turned to face him, propping his head up again, "what about you? Do you... I mean... do you date? I know I've heard several of the girls at school talk about how 'handsome' the new boy is," Sherlock smirked and winked at him.
Sherlock shook his head, "no, you shouldn't have to... If that's what you really want, we'll make things work," he said. He never meant to make John feel guilty and he shouldn't have to sacrifice his dreams just because of Sherlock. It was a selfish thing to ask of him.
He couldn't help laughing at Sherlock's childhood pictures and he rubbed his fiancé's back good-naturedly. "Come on, Sherlock, you were adorable. Look at that cute little mop of curls."
John laughed a little. "I'll tell you what. I'll make the whole fuss worth your while. All you have to do is sit through the gala like a good boy, and that night I'll give you whatever you like." He walked his fingers up Sherlock's chest and poked him on the nose.
Sherlock whimpered as the voices continued to scream in his head. He couldn't feel the soft touches, couldn't hear John's voice above the rest and he started to shake.
Sherlock didn't react to the kiss, just kept staring off. His expression was blank and he didn't move, didn't speak or make a sound. "John? Should we... call an ambulance or something?" Mary asked, her voice getting more concerned by the second.
John licked his lips, letting his tongue flick over Sherlock's skin. "The good thing about this medicine is that you can take as much as you want," here John licked a small stripe up his neck, "and you'll never overdose." He started sucking on the spot right beneath Sherlock's ear, intending to mark him.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's legs, pressing his cheek against Sherlock's hip. "Well, he only made things worse for himself. As for you, my dear..." He got up and kissed Sherlock softly on the lips. "I only wish we could have met sooner." He smiled softly at his fiance. "I should probably get dressed now. Don't want to be late for school," John finished with a sigh.
John smirked, gently rolling Sherlock onto his back and hovering over him. "Well, Mr. Holmes, allow me to give you your treatment. Just try to stay still for me." He bent low to kiss Sherlock's lips, then moved to his jaw, gliding his lips down to his neck. The kisses were warm and lingering, mouth open and teeth grazing.
, John... If you were here right now, I'd put your thick cock into my mouth and take it in as far as I could, all the way to the back of my throat." He bit his lip and adjusted the phone so it was pressed between his shoulder and his ear, leaving his other hand free.
As John saw Moran preparing to kick the boy, he stood and pushed him backwards. "I don't beat up on people unless I have a good reason. And right now the only person I see who deserves a punch in the face is you." John stared defiantly at the older boy, arms crossed over his chest. He just wished he were a bit taller to complete his look of intimidation, but he did see some of the other rugby players backing away nervously.
, John... get on with it already, you bloody tease," Sherlock whispered harshly. He was sure he was going to rip the arms of the seat at this point.
Sherlock smiled down at John and winked before leaning down to press a loving kiss to his lips. He could hear the crowd 'aww'ing' and pulled away with a grin. "See? Absolutely nothing to worry about, love. They adore us," he said and chuckled.
John gasped when he finally saw where Sherlock was bringing him. He could see everything. Big Ben, the Eye, the city with all the lights. "Oh, Sherlock..." He put his hands on the railing as he looked out, tilting his head over so that it was leaning against Sherlock's. "It's amazing." He finally pulled his gaze away to look sideways at his lover. "You're amazing."
Sherlock couldn't help groaning, the sounds John was making were music to his ears and he could feel his cock twitch in excitement. He slowly slid in two fingers and began to scissor them, stretching him open. After a few strokes he added a third and crooked them, trying to find his lover's prostate and commit the correct angle to memory.
Sherlock kissed John back and brought his hand up to stroke his cheek, locking gazes with him. "You are the most amazing, intelligent, caring person I know. You will be the best doctor that London has ever seen." He smiled lovingly down at his fiance and pulled him into a tight embrace. "I love you, John."
"Hey..." Sherlock said soothingly and kissed the tears away, "it'll all work out, you'll see. He just needs some time to process everything. You can stay with me as long as you need to, don't feel like you're a burden, because you're not... okay?" He smiled lovingly at John and cupped his cheek, leaning down to kiss him softly on the lips. He wished there was more he could do, he felt so helpless and hated seeing John so upset.
Sherlock hummed in content, "yes, Doctor." He relaxed and let his eyes close, focusing entirely on the feel of his boyfriend's lips and hands on him. "Mmm, I think this is the best medicine I've ever been prescribed," he said cheekily and chuckled.
Sherlock chuckled, "okay good... I wouldn't want to upset you." He scrunched his face up when John licked his nose, "and
He then removed a smaller case and opened it, revealing his violin. He smiled fondly and ran his fingers along the strings. It had been a while since he'd played, but he had nothing else to occupy himself today and he wanted to do something special for John.
"John!" Mary ran towards him and tapped him on the shoulder, "a few people said they saw him running for the pool house, let's go check there." She led John over and opened the door, "Sherlock? Sherlock, are you in here?" she called out, walking through the house.
"I am. And I'm glad that I can make you happy too." John kissed Sherlock again and again, soft and tender.
Several hours passed before Sherlock awoke and when he did, he blinked his eyes rapidly before looking down, seeing a hand linked with his own. He looked back up to see who it was and was shocked to see John sitting there, having convinced himself that he wouldn't want anything to do with him anymore. "John?" he said, his voice rough.
John looked up at Sherlock with wide eyes and his lip trembling. In a way, he was right. He would have always been tortured by those memories if he let himself be. And even though part of John still felt like he hadn't done his job quite right, enough of him felt better to know that
That was it. John couldn't stop himself anymore. He stood again, tears streaming down his face. "You son of a bitch! You sick,
Sherlock chuckled, "Mmm... I like the sound of that." He winked at John and leaned in for another kiss. Just then there was a knock at the door and Sherlock groaned, burying his face into the pillow next to John's head.
"I think that's enough," Siger said and crossed his arms.
want to tell you but, I don't think now is the time. I'll get all worked up and we still have to go to school."
The rest of Sherlock's day was pretty uneventful and as he stood with his parents as they said goodbye to the last of the guests, he fidgeted anxiously. As he turned to run up the stairs to his room, his father grabbed his shoulder and turned him around. "I hear you have a new friend. I'm sorry I wasn't able to meet him, will he be coming back?"
John cried out, clutching Sherlock's shoulders before moving down to drag his nails over Sherlock's back. There would certainly be red marks there the next day. He bucked his hips up, meeting Sherlock and groaning at the feeling of their fully bared arousals rubbing together.
Sherlock was still playing his violin when Mycroft burst into his room. "Myc, what the hell?! You're interrupting!" he shouted and scowled at him. "Sherlock, shut up. There's been... a situation at the school. It's John, Sebastian went after him."
"Okay, I think we should be good now. Wanna head up to the house and grab a quick shower before the lawyer gets here?" Sherlock asked and stood, holding his hand out for John to take.
take you down." His anger was burning hot inside of him. How had Moran even gotten inside in the first place? Well, it didn't matter. He was going to make sure he never came back.
"So.. the trick is to keep rotating it, that way you heat up the entire surface." Sherlock guided John's hand in circles over the flame. "See?" he said softly next to his fiance's ear, eyes fixed on the beaker.
John stayed completely still as Sherlock moved forward, only closing his eyes as their lips touched. He could hardly believe this. He met this boy only hours ago, and now they had kissed. John felt his entire body light up at the connection, and he just
"John, although we've never talked before and we haven't really met, I have observed your interactions with my brother. I feel it's safe to say that you care about him enough that you would not intentionally leave him to get hurt. Now, stop blaming yourself, it's not doing any good. Do what you can to stop that bleeding from his head. In case you haven't noticed, it's flowing rather heavily," he reached around to hand John a rag to press to the wound.
John bit his lip. "I don't really want to, but I mean, just look at this place. We can barely afford this, let alone for me to go to school." He sighed and hung his head. "I'm not smart enough for scholarships, I don't have a job. I don't know what I could do besides the army. And now that I have you, I really don't want to leave." He looked back up at Sherlock, wishing there was some other way.
A deep blush spread over John's cheeks as Sherlock's lips pressed to his forehead. This was definitely much more than he'd bargained for, but he wasn't complaining. Though when Sherlock's lips stayed in place for longer than a normal kiss, he wondered if it had just been an accident. Either way, he was really enjoying the feeling. He met Sherlock's eyes with a smile. "You're welcome."John reluctantly pulled away from him, figuring that it probably wasn't a great idea to stay so close to Sherlock for so long in case he got suspicious of something, because John couldn't deny it any longer. He was definitely attracted to Sherlock. He cleared his throat looking around the room. "So, uh, what do you want to do?"
He reached up a hand to card through Sherlock's curls. "If I could I would flip you over and fuck you into the mattress." Where was this coming from, this sudden enjoyment of talking to Sherlock this way?
John grinned and took a seat. "Thank you, Mr. Holmes," he said with a wink. He waited for Sherlock to sit before he started to eat. Just like everything else he'd had at Sherlock's house, it was amazing. "I think I'm going to have all my meals here," he said with a mouthful of french toast. "I never eat like this at home."
By the time morning had come, John was feeling much better, even if he was a little sore around the edges. The doctor came in to unhook him from the machines and tell him he was free to go. Once he had left, John carefully got up and dressed in his clothes from the day before. He was limping a bit, but not too terribly. Turning to face Sherlock, he smiled and held out a hand. "Ready to go?"
Sherlock groaned sleepily and snuggled closer to John, "Not hungry..." he mumbled and squeezed his fiancé around the waist.
Sherlock took the time to show John how all the controls worked before they started and let him warm up by playing by himself a couple times. They finally played against each other and Sherlock did end up winning, but it was a very close game.
John cocked his head to the side, remembering the first day they met. "Well, to be honest I thought that you were a bit helpless," he admitted. "But I also thought that you were quite handsome. And I still do. Not the helpless part though." He gave Sherlock a sly grin. "Now what about you?"
Mr. Holmes frowned and clutched the boy to him, wrapping his arms around him and bringing one hand up to the back of his head. He looked up at the officer standing nearby who nodded, confirming that he'd heard the name. Siger focused on soothing the boy in his arms as if he were his own child. His youngest loved him and he considered him part of the family now.
John sighed and he looked up at Sherlock. "I don't need to think about it. I've got you right here." He locked their lips together in a slow kiss, using the touch of his lover's lips to draw away the emotional pain as they had done with the physical.
Sherlock watched as John pulled on his clothes, raising an eyebrow at his choice in pants. He sensed something was wrong and when his fiancé told him that his father wanted him to come home that afternoon, he was pretty sure he knew why. He smiled up at John and kissed him goodbye, "Later, love."
"Right." John approached a girl, realising that she was one of the ones who had cornered him before. "Uh, have you seen Sherlock?"
John turned to Sherlock and then gave him a sly grin. He'd meant it rhetorically, but this was fine with him. "If I win..." He looked Sherlock up and down, then leaned up to whisper in his ear. "I get to tie you up and do whatever I want with you."
Sherlock thought for a moment, looking back on the nightmare he'd had a few evenings ago. As long as he avoided talking about what had happened all those months ago, Sebastian would control him. He couldn't let that happen anymore.
Sherlock's eyes widened in shock, "you... love me?" he reached up with his hand that wasn't connected to the IV and turned John's face towards his. "John, I... I love you, too. I was just so scared to tell you. Afraid it would be too soon and you would run away from me. And when Moran told me that you were probably off shagging Mary... It hurt." His voice broke off at the end, not sure what else he could say.
Sherlock made a noise between a whimper and a moan as John continued to move. He tilted his head further back, trying to give his lover access to more skin. "Oh,
John returned the kiss, feeling warm and breathless. When he pulled away he grinned up at Sherlock, then glanced down to see the other boy's second release floating between them. "Looks like we've got to clean the hot tub now too," he said with a laugh.
"Oh. Thanks," John took the bag with a little confusion. Sherlock hadn't told him that he was going to pick something for him to wear. But he supposed it was just as well. After all, he really didn't have anything of his own. "Uh, am I supposed to tip you or..."
Sherlock wrapped his arms around his lover and laid a kiss in his wet hair. He held him for a few moments before maneuvering them both under the shower spray and grabbed a rag, soaping it up to start washing his fiancé off.
John didn't know what to expect when Sherlock gave him that smile and in the next moment he was being lifted. He squeaked and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck, holding on as he spun them around. John laughed as he clung to Sherlock, nestling his head on Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock began pacing as he continued to speak, "Now, since you were explaining your actions, it could only be your boss, which leads me to my next observation. You returned several minutes later and were very clearly upset but trying to hide it. What else could you be trying to hide than losing your job? And what else would cause John to be so upset and think that he had to leave me since you've already accepted us?... You are planning on moving." He looked up as he finished speaking, assessing both of their reactions.
Sherlock smirked, even with a blush forming across his face, "thank you, John... However, I don't think that is a proper name of a size." He chuckled and turned to pull on his sleep trousers, staying bent over with his arse turned towards John for a bit longer than necessary.
After a day that seemed to drag on forever, John made his way home with a certain sense of foreboding. What was so important that his father had to tell him in person?
They finally made it to the hospital and they took Sherlock into surgery. John sat in the waiting room, hands clasped together as he stared at the door. Hadn't they just done this a few days ago? Well, one thing was certain, he would make sure that it never happened again.
coming after me." He shivered and snuggled closer to his fiancé.
Mycroft nodded and thought for a few moments before speaking. "Okay, you have to listen to me and follow my instructions, because it's very important. If you don't, he may not come out of this without wanting to..." he frowned and furrowed his brow, then shook his head.
John had looked up at just the right moment, seeing Sherlock mouthing his favourite words in the world, and he smiled faintly at him. He really wished he could have Sherlock next to him, but he needed to be strong. For Sherlock, he reminded himself again.
...I love you, too." He was nearing the edge with each movement, but he just needed a little something more for the final push.
Sherlock let another moan out and whimpered. "Please, John... Need to feel you... Please," he whined, unable to speak in complete sentences. He decided to show John what he meant and reached down to start undoing his boyfriend's trousers with shaking hands.
John laughed, but there was no happiness behind it. "Me? You're the one who got shot." He cupped Sherlock's face, willing him to keep eye contact. "Help is on the way, Sherlock. Please, just...keep your eyes open," he choked out. It couldn't end this way, it just couldn't. They still had so much they were supposed to do together.
Sherlock inhaled sharply as John's hand slapped his rear. He smirked and followed his fiancé into the bathroom, slipping into the shower with him. "Mmm, I'd say we have enough time for a little fun," he murmured and turned John towards him. He grabbed his lover's hand and placed it on his slightly hardened cock. Then he reached out to grasp onto John's length and began to stroke it.
"The only downside to this outfit is that I'm going to have to beat people with a stick to keep their hands off of you." John snaked his arms around Sherlock's neck. "I'll have the sexiest date at the party."
..." he gasped out as he felt Sherlock's tightness around him, feeling his inner walls. The friction was unbelievable and he had to force himself to keep still for Sherlock's sake.
"Look, boys... This is all very new to me. I didn't really get a lot of experience in the homosexual child department because Harry left so quickly. But that doesn't mean that every little thing is going to change my mind about your relationship. Especially not something that was certainly not Sherlock's fault."
Sherlock pulled away from his lover's lips after a few moments and turned him over onto his stomach, running his hands over his back and cupping his arse. He laid himself on top of John, rubbing his erection between his arse cheeks as he kissed the back of his neck. He made his way down, kissing each vertebrae as he went.
John grinned and kissed him back, putting his hands on Sherlock's shoulders. They stayed that way for a few moments before John pulled back. "I don't know what it is about you...I feel like I've known you forever." He cupped Sherlock's cheek and stared up at him. "It's like we were meant to meet today."
Sherlock nodded and pulled John down by his arm to wrap his arms around him. He started sobbing, "I love you so much, John. I'm so glad you're still here."
John did some homework for a while, then had dinner with his father before going up to his room. He laid on the bed, flipping through an old book when his mobile rang. With a grin, he picked it up and answered. "Hi, hot stuff," he said, laying back and propping his head on an arm.
"I just can't wait for this whole trial to be over so Moran can be out of our lives for good." Sherlock lifted his head and kissed John on the lips, "I don't want him to torture either of us anymore, but I can't stop the memories..."
Mr. Watson blinked a little before taking a deep breath. He shook his head, looking down at the floor. "If it were anyone else, I would tell you to take off that ring and forbid you from seeing them again." Here he brought his head back up. "But because it's Sherlock...just make sure you wait a few years, boys. You're not even out of secondary school yet."
John unbuttoned Sherlock's shirt completely, pushing it aside so that the entire expanse of his front was visible. He smoothed his hands over his lover's body, groaning as he felt Sherlock's fingers on him. "Fuck, Sherlock..." he choked out, moving his lips to Sherlock's breastbone.
John sighed and closed his eyes, but opened them again as visions of his nightmare swam before him. "My father came to take me away. He didn't want me to be with you anymore. I couldn't get back to you," he explained quietly.
Disclaimer: I only own the story!
John kept his mouth still, reaching one hand up towards Sherlock's mouth. He looked up at the other boy through his lashes, putting a finger on his lips to tell him to be quiet. He let a little smirk show around his lover's cock.
"I love you, too, Sherlock," John said softly. He kept a tight hold on Sherlock, returning each kiss with tenderness and love. When Sherlock finally said they should go speak with his father, John was a bit nervous. But he pushed it away. He shouldn't have to hide his love from his father of all people. "Yes, let's go," he said, sitting up, then standing. He put out a hand for Sherlock to help him up.
John's fingers curled into the fabric of Mr. Holmes's shirt as he tried to control himself, but it was no use. He was shattered, heart and soul. He listened to his deep voice speaking, almost the same tone as...and it only made him cry harder. That is, until he heard his last few words.
John didn't expect the sudden release and he almost choked, but quickly recovered and swallowed everything Sherlock gave. He pulled off when Sherlock was finished, licking him clean and then removing his finger. "Good?" he asked, looking up at his lover.
yes..." Sherlock whined and lifted his head to watch his lover go down on him. "Oh God..." he murmured, the sight was absolutely
They took his father's car, John giving him directions. Mr. Watson's reaction to the house as they pulled up was much the same as John's was but he smiled at him. "Don't worry. They don't really care too much about the difference." He and his father stepped out and rang the doorbell.
Sherlock kissed John back with every touch of their lips. He could feel himself grow closer and closer to release and reached down to take himself in hand, pumping slowly. With his free hand he reached up and pulled his boyfriend's lips to his again, kissing him deeply, tangling their tongues together, moaning and whimpering into his mouth.
They arrived at John's flat minutes later and Sherlock told his brother to go ahead and leave. He made his way up the stairs and knocked on the door, holding his breath.
Sherlock pulled back after a while, "oh yes... Definitely my little deviant," he said breathlessly and smiled down at John. He propped himself up on one elbow and reached up to stroke the side of his lover's face. "I love you so much... I don't think I can say it enough," he murmured.
"Do you now?" Sherlock said cheekily and wrapped his arms around the other boy. "Well... why don't you show me?" He smirked and raised his eyebrow, challenging him.
Suddenly there was a gasp and the sound of glass shattering on the stone floor. Irene pulled away and looked towards the source of the sound. There stood Sherlock, mouth agape and hurt clearly written on his face. "John..." he said quietly as tears welled in his eyes. He shook his head and flung the door open, running back inside.
"Being expelled isn't the only thing they'll have to worry about," Mycroft spoke up from where he was leaned up against the wall. He walked forward as he spoke, "they've also been banned from every athletic program and have to do community work for the rest of the year." Mycroft put a hand on Sherlock's shoulder, "I think it's safe to say they'll be paying for what they did to both of you." He smiled and winked at John.
Sherlock shook his head and smiled fondly at John, "don't you see? You're still here. I'm still here, I'm still
Sherlock reached back and let his fingers trail down John's back, slipping teasingly between his arse cheeks. He pulled away from the kiss, moaning loudly and panting. "John... You're so
John smiled and returned the kiss, feeling better. He thought for a moment about what they could wear. It wouldn't be a formal party, that was for sure, but he wanted to look semi-decent considering this was the first real high school party he'd been too. "I've got nothing. Any ideas?"
John's back arched and he let out a louder moan, the dual sensations of Sherlock's fingers and lips driving him crazy. He dragged his hands over Sherlock's back, leaving nail marks in their wake.
After several minutes, Ms. Rodin approached them, "boys... the judge has decided on a verdict. Whenever you're ready..." She bit her lip and walked back to the table where they were sitting before.
John relaxed, kissing Sherlock back. He was glad that he had gotten through to him. Now if only they could avoid these problems in the first place. John smirked at Sherlock's question. "Of course. I wasn't going to leave letting her think she won. As if she ever had a chance."
"My pleasure," Sherlock murmured and stuck three of his fingers into his mouth to wet them. He reached down after a few moments and rubbed his finger lightly up and down John's crack before sticking one of his fingers inside of him.
John went back to Sherlock and leaned into his side, putting an arm around his waist. Mr. Watson smiled faintly at the two of them. "I understand, son. Like I said, if it were anyone else I wouldn't approve. But you have shown such love for my boy, even to the point of risking your own life. I don't think there is a way that anyone could keep you apart. Just promise that you'll keep taking care of him."
John moaned again, moving in any way that he thought would give Sherlock more skin. He swiped his fingers over the tip of his cock where precum was steadily leaking out, and used that to slick himself up. He reached back down, leaning further backwards to get at his entrance. "I'm... imagining it's you," John breathed as he pushed one in. "That it's your long fingers, stretching me out."
He shoved his mobile in his trouser pocket and flung his jacket on. Then, he sprinted down the hall to a room he rarely ever went to and pounded on the door.
Sherlock's eyes went wide and he sat up against the headboard, licking his lips. "Do you even have to ask?" He said huskily and grinned.
He removed the rest of their clothing and pushed John back until he was laid out flat on the bed, still kissing him. He grabbed onto his boyfriend's waist and slowly rocked his hips forward, grinding them together.
John thought that Mrs. Holmes's speech was incredibly sweet, even if she couldn't finish it. Part of him wished that his own mother still wanted to be a part of his life, that she wanted to do something like this. Sherlock was incredibly lucky to have his mother still. He was broken out of his reverie when Sherlock tried to hide and he laughed, kissing his cheek.
John sighed, resting his cheek in Sherlock's hair. He still felt terribly guilty, and completely unworthy of Sherlock's love when all he had brought him since they got together was pain. "Are you sure I'm not an idiot?" he asked softly.
Sherlock cried out in pleasure as John finally reached the angle he was looking for. He jerked his hips back to get him to hit the spot again and again as he drew closer to his orgasm. After a few thrusts, Sherlock came hard, his arse clenching around his lover's cock as he spurted come all along the shower wall. "Fuck! J-John!" He shouted with his release.
