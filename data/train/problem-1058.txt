“You forget about the masks Sherlock…you can be who you want to be, morality redefined for an evening…I could kiss you as a lover and none would think ill…they would applaud us for our sport most likely or it may pass ignored…but be on your guard, there are many whose object will be to take liberties with the unwary”.
But this was just typical, sitting on his own at a fucking party like the saddest bastard in the room.
“Oh fuck off Mycroft…and you might want to close your legs…I can see entirely the wrong sort of Santa’s sack from here”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked down to John’s face. It was pleasingly flushed, the way it looked when Sherlock nibbled at his neck and thumbed his nipples through his clothes. He was thankful Mrs Hudson couldn’t see his cock twitch.
“You really think so?” Sherlock failed to conceal the uncertainty in his voice, as if he’d expected ridicule instead.
“Floor…the tattoo, he was the one who stuck the knife in my back…wait…the other one, I recognised him too…the bloke from the alley, the one you kneed in the balls, Trent something or other, he was the one sent to look for you that night I got a kicking but you were….well, he didn’t find you”.
The boy glared at me, did not answer but thrust forward his outstretched palm, and John sighed beside me and dug out a silver sixpence from the pocket of his waistcoat, holding it out between thumb and forefinger. The boy reached out and John snatched it away from his grasp and cocked an eyebrow meaningfully. “Ere beggin your pardon guv’nor”, he gave a sarcastic half- bow to us both, “I didn’t mean nuffink by it”.
Sherlock forced a smile and was sure it came off as more of a grimace. He wouldn’t rise to the bait, Mycroft wanted a scene after all.
He was inclined to let the matter pass without further comment in the spirit of fraternal harmony, as Sherlock’ he guessed had made as much noise as possible so as to be particularly provocative, and John would have merely followed where he led, Mycroft presumed, as last night’s impressive display of loyalty had demonstrated. Perhaps his brother had chosen wisely for once, or had, as was more likely the case, stumbled quite by accident upon a diamond in the rough. One could only hope that Sherlock could resist his ever present compulsion to self-destruct.
He sounded so unbearably young John thought, but also incredibly sincere. To think about their possible future together after such a brief time, whether jokingly or not, John must have made just as big an impact on Sherlock’s life as Sherlock had on his.
“Would you ever have done anything about it, if I hadn’t just…..you would have let it drift away, you to the army, him to Uni without ever confronting it, wouldn’t you John?”
When they reached the second floor, lungs bursting a little from the swift, impatient climb now they were finally here, near him again, they were brought up short by a tall bespectacled doctor brandishing an official looking clip-board.
Sherlock felt a momentary pang of guilt and gratitude. Last night could so easily have ended in a cold damp prison cell and the wrath of Mycroft (although that would be forthcoming anyway owing to a second night of escapology), instead it had been….perfect?
“Don’t give a fuck” Sherlock lied, but his patience was gone, if he’d wanted a tease he could have tried another round with last week’s straight guy, but Sherlock was done with waiting for tonight. He pressed his lips against the older man’s, tilted his head and flicked his tongue out.
Glass smashed somewhere in the tavern below and we heard the sound of voices raised in anger. And then a noise set to chill the very marrow in your bones; the short sharp blast of a whistle.
Of course John wasn’t some naive idiot, and given the timescale involved it didn’t take a massive mental leap to work out just who Sherlock might have been ‘not just sleeping’ on the mattress with, and although John knew it was none of his business the thought of it still stung.
John bent down to help me anyway, spitting out onto a handkerchief and dabbing at the smear, my skin prickled at the brush of his fingertips as he took off the worst and sat back with a sigh of satisfaction.
“Very well”, John snapped in irritation, “My apologies Grandmama…I must rob you of your fair companion for a moment….come Sherlock, let us see what the old goat wants”.
From the report supplied with such expediency by Anthea, Mr Watson was, until two days ago, to all intents and purposes, heterosexual, complete with adorable high school sweetheart. Could Sherlock really have instantly unlocked some sort of latent homosexuality, or was his brother merely a passing phase, an experiment perhaps, in John Watson’s journey of self-discovery?
“Excellent, just the thing, Sherlock’s mother will bankrupt me for certain with the amount of new bonnets she buys every year, this will work out splendidly for her…and your sister….does she know her letters?”
“John, isn’t it, John Watson?” Victor called after him. John stopped, one hand on the door frame trying to calm his breathing. “Yeah?” said John, his voice a little hoarse. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and frowned.
John had not suffered me to move at all that day, bringing the food up himself from the kitchen below after dressing hurriedly, and so we had sat, and fashioned a makeshift table and tablecloth of the bed and sheets, and gorged ourselves. There were cold cuts of meat, cheese and fresh bread and a hearty stew made thick with pearl barley and yellow peas, a peasant food which tasted to us as fine as anything to be found at a gentleman’s table. Our landlord prepared it himself, and we had his most ardent assurance that it would ‘put hairs on our chests’. If that be true I said, it would indeed be a culinary miracle, the first of its kind to stimulate follicular growth, and men from miles around would come to rub it upon their baldy pates in the hope of regaining the crowning glory of their youth.
“Bit out of your way here, aren’t you?” continued Victor, “Shouldn’t you be shagging in the showers or downing vodka shots in The Bull with the rest of the rugby crowd? I didn’t think ballet was your scene, unless or course, you’ve come to admire the view …can’t say I blame you for that though,” he added, giving Sherlock’s waist another squeeze and flashing a triumphant smirk which the dancer pointedly ignored.
“Leave it on, I like it….please”, so he slouched down in the seat a little and unzipped the pants to pull his erection out, heavy , dark and leaking at the tip, a day’s worth of pent-up sexual frustration, balls so hot and tight they felt like lead weights between his legs. Sherlock raised himself onto his knees, legs still spread and guided John’s hand behind him, coaxing his fingers down between his tight cleft.
Sherlock was joking, of course, he knew that, but John felt a deep pang of guilt all the same at his piss-poor choice of words. This boy was something special, anyone with half a brain could see that and of course this meant something, even if John wasn’t sure quite what yet. He swallowed thickly realising he didn’t want this to be a one night thing, the thought that he might never see Sherlock again left him feeling oddly devastated. He growled in annoyance as the back of his throat began to sting and heady rush of white noise filled his ears.
After a quick shower that predictably turned into more of a snog and grope than a wash and scrub (apparently inevitable following any period of time spent in close proximity, naked), John tiptoed back across the landing to the unused guest room for his clean things, ready to die of embarrassment should Mycroft appear. He was sure it was obvious they had fucked last night, and even more obvious what they had done this morning after the noise they had just made, but he could hope for a tactical avoidance, couldn’t he?
“Who the hell are you trying to fool, because you damn well don’t fool me you arrogant little prick”
It broke something inside him to untangle those fingers and push Sherlock back, so he rose and turned away, standing where the flat space met an upward slope of grey tile.
“I am familiar with the ‘Many Worlds Theory, of course, the idea that the universe splits into distinct universes to accommodate each possible outcome”
The night thus far had been a blur of cheap alcohol procured from the back of an ancient white transit van from a cousin of the fly-half James (who'd 'acquired' it from a bloke just out of Strangeways this past Wednesday.) No one actually cared about it's rather dubious origins though. When trying to eke out a student loan until Christmas break you took whatever you could get your hands on, legality be damned. The point was inebriation of the highest order, in the shortest time frame possible and the means was, well, pretty meaningless. And no one partied harder than John Watson, who had garnered something of a reputation of late. In only his second year of a medical degree he had achieved an academic ranking in the top two per cent in the country and was also the youngest rugby captain ever at Queen Mary University of London. High honours indeed. But the accolades did not end there. Not a weekend had gone by so far this term without a different body in his bed by the end of a Saturday night. And sharing a bed with John Watson ensured a bloody good time was had by all. Well it usually did. And that had in fact, been the plan this time, but somewhere along the line, as had happened more and more frequently of late, John was rapidly losing his focus, and his libido along with it. Something just wasn't cutting the mustard lately and he couldn't quite put his finger on what. Well, except he'd put his fingers, plural, on and in quite a lot of things tonight, in an impressive variety of ways, but it really wasn't happening. For either of them.
He kissed me once before we parted.  Tilting up my chin, he pressed our lips together. It was light and chaste at first, but John growled, and it grew deeper, more urgent until he kissed me so breathless that I was the one to break it. “When you return,” I said panting, pushing him firmly away.
“It is the biggest event of the calendar year, besting even the winter ball, but the atmosphere less stiff and formal, more akin to the balls of Paris or Vienna, and everyone of note will be there, the King himself was rumoured to attend last year”.
Each thrust of his hips, each slap of skin against skin, all the wet, slick sounds and breathless moans would remain forever etched inside my brain, a place where the only words I would ever need were John, John, John.
And frustrated, did he mention frustrated, oh and not forgetting the fact he was a walking nerve-ending owing to the fact he would soon be on his way to dinner at Sherlock’s big posh house.
He would enjoy Friday immensely, and make a particular point of fucking John very thoroughly and very loudly right under Mycroft’s abnormally large nose.
“Yes, I noticed that earlier darling, you’ve made quite the impression, believe me…our Sherlock doesn’t ‘do’ the whole ‘intimacy’ thing, not as long as I’ve known him anyway, much more the ‘fuck and run’ type, impossible to pin down”
“Ah, I see” well, he didn’t see really, it was a bit overwhelming if he was honest and to his shock and surprise it was also a massive turn-on, the thought of being caught fucking Sherlock in a club, and people staying to watch the show. Jesus Christ what the hell was wrong with him?
I slept a deep and dreamless sleep that night, and he did too, for we did not stir again until the light shone full and high mid-morning and started awake at the gentle tapping that sounded upon the door.
It wasn’t a question. Sherlock stared at him, stricken, a stark contrast to his usual disdainful gaze. The wind picked up then, and ruffled his soft dark hair, as his eyes raked over John’s face, reading the barely concealed pain. He reached out to grab the hem of his shirt and John pinned both his wrists and held them there, tangled in the soft fabric folds. At another time, in another place, this simple action would have led to so much more…
A dark grey delivery van pulled up further ahead and he hesitated yet again, scanning for a cab, senses on high alert. Christ, you would think he’d been spiked he was so fucking paranoid, sucked into Sherlock’s murky world of crime. The van cut its lights but no-one got out.
“I meant sleeping here, overnight. I thought you must do, given the bed and everything. Otherwise why go to all the trouble of hauling it up here?”
“I didn’t say that, I just said you’re a fucking pervert. Didn’t say I wouldn’t be up for it some time, you know…”
He seemed not to care, and covering my hand with his own we twisted and pulled together, sticky and wet with our mutual release. He dropped his head to my shoulder then, and bucked, frantic and intense, liquid slapping around our thighs in agitation as he spurted thick and hot against my skin. The feel of it, dripping slowly from my chest, the scent of his sex on my body pulled me after him and I clung to him, shuddering in ecstasy and relief as the tension drained from my body, sucking in air to still my pounding heart. I felt the warm press of a cloth at my body then, slick with soap to cleanse us both again.
“I don’t want to go” Sherlock peppered his face with soft kisses, stroking at his chest with trembling fingertips. “I wouldn’t have come here if I didn’t want to sleep with you…I need this too….please?”
He pushed in, inch by inch, long muscled legs hoisted up over his shoulders as he wriggled and rolled his hips a little to bury himself balls- deep. He paused, arms quivering with the effort to hold his body up, and took a moment to admire the tangled curls of pubic hair, black against blond, pulling back just a little then in and back again, mesmerised by the slide of his cock inside the body underneath him.
“Well, I guess that’s it then, isn’t it? She looked resigned, defeated. “How could I possibly compete with that? Glorious, technicolour Sherlock and dull grey Sara?"
He glanced over his shoulder at his brother and found Mycroft eyeing John shrewdly. He raised an eyebrow at Sherlock and turned away, directing his attention back to his guests.
He watched, that I knew, every motion of my arms, the right that swept with light even strokes, the left arm bent in an attitude, wrist curved outward and fingers curling to meet catgut strings pulled tight, suspended over ebony, awaiting the press of a fingertip against it. My neck was tilted to the left, the white skin exposed in the most submissive of gestures, as my chin pressed lightly to the rest and the bone of my clavicle ached with the pressure of the wood against it, but I bore the discomfort for it was pain with a purpose. And still I could not bear it to end, drawing out the last sweet strains of the music I had composed for him,
It hadn’t been long before the maid found us out, as she came one morning to lay a fresh fire in the grate, she had happened upon us still deep in slumber, lying chest to back and undeniably naked in my bed, John’s arm curled over my body and his knee pressed full between my thighs. I had startled awake at the sound of the coal scuttle as it clanged against the open grate. John had stirred as I clutched the covers to my chest and half-sleeping had caressed the back of my neck squirming gently against my arse, not yet come to full awareness.
Icy air slapped him in the face as he opened the door, surprised by a small heap of snow that fell inwards and covered his shoes. It was still coming down thick and fast, obscuring the driveway making it impossible to distinguish paving from grass, blowing towards him as he peered out, landing in his eyelashes and making his vision all blurred. Or was that something else? Sherlock didn’t dare examine that any closer, he just had to get away, not home, too many questions, the least of which was ‘how the hell did you get so drunk Sherlock?
Surging forward he caught my mouth in a warm, firm press and pulled me to him. I stumbled a little, off balance, and clutched him around the waist to steady myself and stop from falling into him, held between his spread thighs. His shirt had come untucked from his breeches in the night and my palms made contact with the soft warm skin of his abdomen, fingers brushing against soft downy hair which would surely grow coarser the lower it went. I dared to try and slid my thumb beyond the waistband, where dipping down I stroked back and forth in a soft teasing rhythm, hearing each hitch of breath and feeling his muscles tighten in response. John cupped my head gently and tilted his own to meet my mouth again on a more pleasing angle and I relished the delicate push and slide of his lips against mine, plush and warm .
By the end I was almost dizzy with the effort of standing still on one spot, swaying alarmingly to catch hold of John by the arm. I left my hand there, curled around his sleeve.
For in truth my tirade was unjust. I had much to be grateful for regarding our mutual friend Charles, an admirable man indeed who had offered to us his loyalty and expertise in making discreet enquiries as to the possible whereabouts of my brother, a service which he rendered pro bono in addition to the service he had lately performed for me.
I blinked in confusion, my head a little clearer from the slap and the cool clear air, leaning heavily into a silvered coat, his arms the only thing that stopped me from falling at his feet. A path cleared for us, as we wound our way through a room near the entrance with wide open doors that led out to a carved stone balcony, blessedly silent and empty. He settled me down on wide, wooden love-seat and knelt between my knees making no complaint of the hard stone below he fastened the buttons of my shirt, and gently tucked it back into the waist of my trousers. For a moment he left again, appearing before me with a pitcher of water and a cup, some of which he poured for me, watching while I drank to his satisfaction, the rest he poured on my head, and I spluttered and gasped in shock at the cold.
I trailed off then, unwilling to go any further with this discourse, for fear it would encroach upon the festive mood and dampen the enjoyment of the night yet to come. We were almost there on any account, and I felt my heart race again as the horses slowed and the carriage drew up by the entrance to the Festival Hall.
Mycroft had never expected to find the task of raising his brother to adulthood easy. He had fully expected to be thwarted at every available opportunity, and had not been disappointed thus far, but he had taken on the responsibility willingly, with father gone and mummy ‘emotionally unavailable’, shall we say, what other choice could there be?
“You mean that archaic custom where even the magical community succumbs to the lure of mass consumerism? No, it’s not that…I can’t go home…it’s not safe yet…but that’s not what I’m saying, I just don’t think I can do this on my own”
“Relax, nobody else knows about this place” Sherlock yanked away from his grip and stalked over to the edge of an old raised flower bed, (a roof garden then?) now an empty graveyard of soil and old cigarettes. He perched on the narrow side and lit up with a defiant air, just daring John to object. John didn’t. It was the sexiest fucking thing he’d ever seen.
“Mr dark and chiselled cheekbones”, he turned to Harry, “You might want to wear your noise-cancelling headphones when I bring him home tonight, I’ve got a feeling he’s gonna be loud”.
“Sherlock, this is no game, no childish folly. The Runner’s do not seek proof…the question of indecent conduct will be for the judge to decide. I will not be joined to you this night only to be ripped from your side and to risk your beautiful neck at the noose. I could not live, I could not bear it.” He tore his hands through his hair in anguish and turned away again.
There was John too. In some ridiculous way that he couldn’t quite fathom he was doing all this to impress him. Look John, see, Sherlock isn’t really a fucked-up mess, wild and impetuous and clever, yes, and he can give you that danger you so desperately crave, but he’s not a lost cause…yet. Because that was what he had tasted on the inside of John Watson’s mouth, a craving for the dark side, something that Sherlock was more than able to provide. John was hungry tonight, he had already proved that and he was hovering on the edge of something else now, something exciting and dangerous.
He let himself be led, steered across the room to a barely visible black door marked ‘private’, down a short dimly lit passage to a large sumptuous room all blood red velvet and ebony leather where he sat down heavily on a long black sofa, sinking into soft upholstery, suddenly feeling very small and young. Irene filled two cut-glass tumblers from a crystal decanter with rich amber liquid, pressing one into John’s shaking fingers.
John was sitting in Greg’s car, a mile away, heading out of the town towards the dock’s before he remembered that Mike would probably be waiting for him by now. He hoped he had the common sense to just walk to John’s house on his own, because this was far more important.
He lay on his stomach, cock pressed against the cool, cotton covers and laid his head on a voluminous pillow. Arms up, the two loose ends of the tie looped and fastened around the old-fashioned posts of the bedstead. Mmm it felt like heaven, just floating, cast adrift, he thought, as soft chaste kisses tickled up the length of his spine, and rough calloused thumbs traced circles in the dip of the Venusian dimples, then rougher, more insistent, a hot moist tongue licking down again as every nerve ending sprang to life. He squeezed his eyes shut, as bright bursts of colour exploded behind his lids.
He stepped forward again, brandishing the hated tie and flipped Sherlock’s collar up, looped it around Sherlock neck and deftly twisted it into a perfect Windsor knot. He smiled in satisfaction and looked up to inspect his handiwork, as Sherlock reached down and stroked lazily up the length of his cock.
He reached the road just as the lights turned red and dashed across earning a filthy look from an old man in an electric motor scooter with a basket on the front.
Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath at the pain and let a soft moan of pleasure, the signals scrambled in his head, he was sick, this was wrong, it hurt so much and it was so fucking good…
They nudged shoulders playfully, still on open ground, pity, John thought, as he fantasised about pushing Sherlock roughly up against something, anything, and snogging the snark right out of his sarcastic, incredible mouth.
“Nah sorry Shez, but that forensic’s bloke, the one who looks like a ferret peering through a lavvy brush that fuckin hates ya?, they let ‘is lot in about ‘alf an hour ago by my reckonin”
“Bonus points for trying John, but wrong on both counts” Sherlock went on, ignoring John’s twitch of guilt and discomfort “he’s one of my connections…a ‘Homeless Network’ if you will, a mixture of acquaintances, friends and associates…”
A half-remembered conversation floated through her mind about John hearing some kid playing the most amazing song, and his face looked vaguely familiar, but she couldn’t quite place where she had seen him before, a school concert seemed the most likely place. He glanced back over his shoulder once, before heading in the direction of All Saints church. With nothing else to go on it was worth a try, so she quickened her pace and followed.
“Don’t bother” hiccupped Sherlock, as he popped another button on his aubergine shirt, John’s eyes locked on his, exposing his chest to the waist “he fucked his wife before he came but he wants to get it up for Donovan later so he just pilfered some Viagra from the evidence room off that case that I solved last week”
“ My point? Nothing really, except pointing out what a massive slutty man-whore you are. Is there anyone left in London you haven’t slept with yet Sherlock?”
The hardwood floor pitched beneath his feet, his hand on the door, the only thing holding him in place. He had said it out loud and now it was horribly real, but it was the wrong time and the wrong place.
“Should I go?”said Paul, casting nervous glances at the partition wall, the sole flimsy barrier between them and his pissy old flatmate, “ I mean, if there’s some sort of problem here?”
The walk home was painful and slow, but he doubted a cab would take him like this, in his filthy dishevelled state, jeans all wet and caked in stinking dirt from the piss soaked ground. A few people stared as he staggered along, got pissed and passed out in the street they probably all thought, well, let them think that, he just didn’t care. The dream of that hot shower and a warm bed pushed him on…and Sherlock…he had to make sure he was okay.
He dragged John through the French doors and pinned him up against the outside wall eliciting a soft ‘Oomph’! as he knocked the breath from his lungs. He pressed their foreheads together and stood silently, breathing heavily as he peered at John through a mess of dishevelled curls, not sure if he could stop himself if they started this.
“Hey, it was…not a problem,” John said.  “Look, since I’ve obviously fucked up your ride tonight, and you can hardly stand out here in the cold without a coat on much longer or you’ll catch your death, the least I can do is help you get home.” John was pretty cold himself. The wind had kicked up, and he flipped up the collar of his jacket, balling his hands up tightly in his pockets to warm them. He glanced at Sherlock, dressed in the clothes he’d rushed out of the gym in, just a light cotton hoodie with nothing underneath it. John’s eyes drifted down to the flash of white skin where the zipper had slipped just a little too low.
Sherlock resolutely ignored all of John’s attempts to catch his attention and merely nodded his gratitude as Elsa opened the door wider, ushering them through into the flat. When compared to the surroundings, it wasn’t as bad as John had thought, small, yes, but relatively clean and tidy, an eclectic mix of styles representing the two very different occupants, one bright and brash the other more muted, almost bohemian in style, no prizes for guessing which one Elsa was.
The man nodded in agreement to something she said, his eyes flickering up to rove around the room again. He paused when he caught Sherlock staring and smiled, mouth quirking up at the corners in the ‘
“Oh I’m sure John wouldn’t mind dear, you always seemed to get along, before he went away, that is. I’ll ring Angela if you like, I just saw her yesterday, she was so excited to have both John and Harriet home this year for a real family Christmas, just like we’re going to have dear”
Sherlock actually laughed, loud and slightly hysterically, “Shit John, I always told you your poker face was fucking awful”.
The stranger flashed him an easy smile. “New to the area, thought I’d check out the local wildlife, you know, before I start my new job tomorrow”. The look he gave Sherlock was devouring, scoping Sherlock’s body from top to toe. He reached for his lighter, annoyed at the way his fingers shook a little. “Er…could you not please…I mean, if we’re going to, you know, I’d rather you didn’t…just gave up recently, the taste would only…”, he paused and licked his lip while staring at Sherlock’s mouth, “Tempt me”.
“Okay…for starter’s I’m not ‘your friend’” John rubbed at his temples, aware of a faint throb from an excess of whiskey, slowly starting to make itself known. As first meetings went, this ranked as one of the strangest, discounting the obvious of course, because someone had already picked apart his life without even knowing him, and once was enough. “You read minds too, well done mate, or are you going to tell me it’s just a magic trick? If so, it’s not very original, someone’s tried that on me before”
Irene laughed at my distress, reminding me this was sure to change in due course once I had secured employment in a fine house. And with that she proposed we make our way to the Intelligence Office as soon as was prudent to seek out a place with all haste lest I be left without a bed for the night.
“When I return,” he echoed, a little sadly, I thought. And then the moment passed and his mask fell back into place. His jaw clenched tight again, and with a final flourish, he pressed his hat upon his head, strode across the room, and was gone. The door snicked shut behind him. I tried not to think how much it felt like a goodbye.
Imagine my delight then at the renewal of an old acquaintance, my childhood friend Miss Irene Adler, recently come down to visit with friends and due to return to the city, where she had procured employment. With no-one left to care what should become of me I proposed to go with her to seek my fortune heedless of the warnings that the city had ruined far more adventure-seeker’s than it had ever made or advanced, my young head dizzy with longing for all the fine sights and diversions which she recounted in great detail.
“No,” Sherlock shook his head. What would be the point in lying when his reaction had made it pretty damn obvious? John must think him such a child. He glared back, and silently dared John to laugh at him, which he didn’t. But Sherlock never did know when to quit. “My mother doesn’t approve of motorcycles or the people who ride them, and if my brother were to find out I’d been on one, I think he’d probably kill me,” he finished, a tad defiant. Great, now he sounded like a snob, a baby and a tit. Well done, Sherlock, what a turn-on.
“Mugged…jumped on the way home” the less Mike knew about this the better, he didn’t want anyone else involved.
“About the extended services? Well if she didn’t know before Tuesday, she certainly does now, that’s why he keeps her away from the place in general, she wasn’t meant to be there that night, or any night really, the manager panicked”.
Tough I knew it to be so, anger flared on Tom’s behalf. And if it weren’t for John’s grounding touch, the hand upon my wrist I should have flown at him, thrown my arms about his neck and begged him stay awhile and bear the harridan’s wrath. She could not best him, my loyal, strong Tom, but yet he swayed to her call nonetheless like a prisoner. I could not bear it.
Thank god for Mycroft for paving the way in that respect, although Sherlock had lost count of the times he’d caught his brother in flagrante, as it were, because Mycroft had been a much bigger tart than he’d ever admit to before Greg.
God, why did this car have to drive so bloody slow? The roads were as clear as they could possibly be in the heart of London, the only delays from traffic lights turned red. The car slid to a halt again.
Let me tell you of Mrs Davis, so that you might know the face of evil when you look upon it, and if you might think that the fairer sex be not capable of the worst barbarities and degradations that a human can commit against its fellows then remember these words and take heed.
“Only for a juicy crime scene, the work John, that’s what matters, that, and you are the only things that keep me sane…”
The silence was broken by the unmistakable sound of an empty stomach which grumbled and growled. John looked mortified as Mama turned to look at him wide-eyed and the shop-boys sniggered by her side. Sherlock gave them the finger behind Mama’s back. Did they imagine that they were somehow superior to his friend, just because they had had the good fortune to be given a job in a fancy department store?
“You are well”, he began as he sensed my hesitation yet again. “I had heard tell” he said almost shyly, looking up through his lashes, eyes fixed upon my face, “But it is good, more than good, to look upon you with my own two eyes after all this time”.
“Frank the owner? So did he know who they were? That’s awful” Sherlock looked convincingly indignant and concerned on her behalf.
‘Well?’ he roared rearing up revived, ‘you little cocktease that you are, making a man shoot off in his breeches like that by acting all shy and demure. I know your sort, I’ll bet you serviced half the village with your sloppy little hole and thought you could do the same here and make a living on your back and on your knees. You acted your part well with your display of false modesty, but I’ll be damned if the old bitch will get a penny’.
He shrugged. ‘I was nineteen for god’s sake, and you know how people exaggerate.’ John scrutinised the ad again, all three lines of it, shifting so the women at the bar moved out of his line of sight. ‘Doesn’t ask for girls,’ he said looking up at Mike, ‘No prizes for guessing why that is.’
The deep voice vibrated close to his skin, tickling over his balls. Damn the fucking lunatic, he was supposed to be annoyed, he was not supposed to be thinking about how nice that felt.
Oh god, how he wanted to, but he was scared to turn around and see those eyes staring at him again, with awe and wonder.
Irene follows his line of sight. She laughs. “Oh no Sherlock, you poor dear…John Watson…the clean-cut captain of the football team?”
John stiffened in anger at the insult, and strode away from me towards his father’s desk where he stood, hands pressed to the surface and knuckles white to keep them from moving to strike. If the man had not been his father then he would be on his back by now, to name me as such in his presence.
We arrived in London at the first flush of dawn, retiring to an Inn to procure sustenance – freshly baked bread and home-made preserves washed down with bitter small-beer, a humble feast but all that we could afford on my dwindling inheritance. My possessions were scant, everything I owned in the world packed into one battered brown trunk, cutting a lowly figure, dressed as I was in my country attire, built for practicality and durability not fashion, my native origins setting me apart from the other patrons.
Sherlock huffed in annoyance, clearly unimpressed “But yet an idiot like Anderson gets unlimited access along with those performing monkey’s they laughably call a forensics team?” Sherlock pouted and John had to stifle a smile, he sounded like a petulant child.
I let myself be moved, manipulated to suit his purpose, legs draped across his shoulders to lift my arse up higher. And then, ohgodohgodohgod, I felt the first press of his cock against me, a bolt of sheer panic flooding my chest at the size of it. It was impossible, it could not, he could not, that stiff horn-hard gristle, battering at my most tender part, questing for admittance that I most feared would not come. His size would defeat me and deny us both. I could not let that happen. And so, I held my breath and stifled my cries as he pushed, the bitter tang of copper on my lips as I bit through the tender skin.
‘Ah’. I stepped away from him and lowered my eyes as a mark of my guilt, for I had kept this knowledge from him.
So, not a lock-up garage, Sherlock mused, an actual car mechanic’s workshop. It was clearly a family business -- John’s family.
“Okay”, John turned to him, “You’ve got that look on your face like a cat toying with a bloody mouse, so please don’t tell me you’re going out there, I really don’t want to be mopping up blood tonight”.
“He’s coming” Sherlock hissed, “even if he has to stand on the stage with me and play the fucking triangle”.
John prodded and pushed him down on the floor, between the sofa and the coffee table where all the snacks were spread out. He sat, rather stiffly, pow-wow style, legs crossed between Mary, who he knew from school and a boy called Gary, or Greg whom he did not.
“The hell you are”, John growled and dragged his head back down again, sucking on Sherlock’s full bottom lip and nipping at the swollen flesh until it stung. Sherlock pushed his hands under the back of John’s shirt, and ran his nails down the smooth warm skin, digging in just a little too hard until John got the message and pulled back, his kisses turning soft and languid.
John cleared his throat, nervously. “Erm Sherlock…I meant to ask ages ago…you see it’s my birthday in a couple of weeks and…”
He bucked up roughly, fingers digging harshly into Sherlock’s sides, one, two, three times, and held them suspended while he spilled into the condom sheathed in Sherlock’s body feeling like something had broken within him, like he’d been torn apart at the seams. He was shaking, trmors running through his legs and body as he lowered his arse back down onto the bed. His legs collapsed and he fought to steady his erratic breaths.
your boyfriend,” said Sherlock, exasperated, “why must you persist with this ludicrous fantasy? And John is certainly not here to ogle anyone, he’s here to arrange the photo-shoot, obviously.”
“Of course I knew. I’m neither blind nor an idiot.” Sherlock said, and shrugged his shoulders and started to walk again. “Stealth is not your strong point John – you should work on that for next time.”
I hear, from these very lips? I will not be parted from you as I care nought for their damned convention nor for any consequence, and so, we
“I must admit I’m mildly impressed Sherlock, how quaint, defending your honour as if you were some sort of damsel in distress”
The room was half-full of people that Sherlock recognised and some that he had never seen before. It was mercifully dark though, the only light coming from the muted t.v in the corner and numerous strings of Christmas lights strewn over the mantelpiece and wound haphazardly around an artificial Christmas tree. His own mother had spent far longer than any sane person should, consulting interior design magazine for perfectly sourced, eco-friendly decorations. Sherlock was almost too scared to breathe in their presence in case he so much as knocked a single bauble or strand of overpriced tinsel out of place. Mrs Watson was more ‘throw the lot at it preferably from a great height, and see what sticks and he could definitely see the merit in the more relaxed approach.
He somehow managed to maintain a thin façade of calm when his thoughts turned to Victor Trevor. Mycroft had befriended him (not a common occurrence for Mycroft), welcomed him into their home, trusted him, and that trust had been betrayed in the most horrific way. It still made Mycroft’s blood run cold to recall the day he discovered that Victor had despoiled his vulnerable, emotionally unstable young brother in their family home. He had taken his innocence, introduced him to a world of perversions, convinced the boy he was in love, that he’d wanted Victor to do those things to him. Mycroft shuddered at the memory of delicate pale skin marred by vicious red welts.
He took a moment to just stare at John stretched out waiting for Sherlock to touch him and felt dizzy with the thrill of it, until gently, carefully he moved in close, parting John’s arse with warm palms and gave an experimental lick over the sensitive skin.
The woman sighed and looked up at the dark expanse of sky, cocking her head to the side as if listening to some unheard, distant voice. It was unsettling to say the least.
“It could have been a lot fucking worse” said John, “we could’ve been dragged out of here in handcuffs”
He hadn’t, but it wasn’t a big deal, so he sucked the end of his finger to make it wet and scrubbed at the offending stain.
Sherlock wrapped a long leg around his waist, shifted to the side and casually flipped them over. John’s head connected with the floorboards with a thunk.
“Maybe…once upon a time, but a cheating wife and the financial strain of divorce can take its toll on a man…not to mention the fact that this Lestrade never met his protégé, the young drug-addict Sherlock Holmes. You inspired him from the day that you met and he became your protector and confidante, long before John Watson was ever heard of, despite the fact that you frustrated and exasperated him in equal measure with your unorthodox methods and sharp tongue”
” Sherlock worried at his lip, steeling himself for the sting of rejection, insecurity creeping in again, now that they were both faced with this reality. But John apparently, had no such doubts, as he leaned across the table and whispered quietly in Sherlock’s ear
“And next time it’s club only, I don’t want the girls involved, not even if you’re fucking desperate”.
In the moment of distraction he had missed Professor Mcgonagall bringing the stool out and placing it on the raised platform in front of the staff table with the floppy old sorting hat perched daintily on top.
He tapped out a message and waited, the distant jingle of Greg’s old Nokia sounding muffled in the depths of his coat. Greg huffed in annoyance and left him in charge of the tea-bags while he crossed the room and fished it out of the inside pocket, staring at the screen like he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.
It’s the same argument again and again. Sherlock hates this. They could break this fragile thing they have so easily.
to him. Sherlock considered the possibility that he might still be high, every sensation magnified, every touch sending shudders of pure pleasure coursing through his body. He buried his face in John’s shoulder as John stroked his warm hands up and down Sherlock’s denim clad thighs. If this was what it felt like still fully clothed what the hell would it feel like naked, and in a warm bed? And god, he wanted that so very, very much right now.
Sherlock thinks he looks emaciated, but it could just be a trick of the light, can’t imagine what anyone would find attractive here.
He gave a stiff nod in acknowledgment and fought to keep the bike steady and their combined weight centred as they jerked and bobbed along the final few metres of track. He was only mildly successful, failing to avoid a deeper pit that had filled up with rain from the recent downpour. Filthy water splashed their feet and legs soaking through John’s jeans right up to the knees. Something he might come to regret later.
“I believe that you have spent some considerable time ‘enjoying’ (a sarcastic chuckle) Sherlock’s company.”
He sighed, exasperated, “You truly do not see?...Oh Sherlock, whatever would become of you without me? She will rob some stupid half-wit blind and leave him with a dose of the pox afore the night is done, but it shall not be you”.
‘I know nothing of you’ I raised my head to look at him, and saw an answering wetness reflected there and felt the pull of his fingertips where they tangled in my sleep-tossed hair. I raised a hand to his face and traced the delicate bow of his lips with a trembling fingertip, and with that I was lost.
John grabbed his arm and dragged him inside the house, where he dripped forlornly on the hall carpet, not even registering that Sherlock had never, in two years, been to his house before.
John hadn’t been aware until now that Sherlock had known who he was, let alone about his skill with a camera. They’d certainly never spoken beyond the odd word exchanged in mutual classes, the few that Sherlock had not been moved a year ahead of the rest of his peers.
He looked feral, red splatters on his face where he had stood too close, curls wildly tousled from John’s hand, just daring anyone to come near, to try and touch either of them.
John drifted into consciousness as a rough, wet tongue lapped eagerly at his face and a wet sticky nose pressed into his cheek and snuffled loudly. He forced his eyes open with a groan, Christ it fucking hurt, and curled on his side on the hard damp ground. Every muscle and bone protested as he gingerly tried to move, stretching out arms and legs, fingers and toes. Bloody hell he felt like one giant fucking bruise. He tried to sit up and his vision swam as a wave of dizziness and nausea washed over him.
‘Oh yes’ he grinned, ‘he and his lover, who goes by the name of Oliver, they pretend to be cousins as we do, and have for twenty years or more, so I am told…so’ he went on, I am aware the horse has long since bolted from the stable door but still, I dearly wish to learn of your history, what brought you to London Sherlock and how in god’s name did you end up in a whore-house….and please forgive me for being forever grateful that you did so’.
“Huh? Oh, yeah, what do you want me to ask?” he jolted out of his fantasy, and mentally gave himself a shake (have you no self-control anymore for fuck’s sake? – where Sherlock is concerned, apparently not)
He looked up at the sound of a young, gruff voice. Graham, or Greg or something, wasn’t it? He was in his final year at John’s school, a football player, had aspirations to join the police force (would be a reasonably intelligent addition – should do well), but not averse to bending the rules or turning a blind eye from time to time. Sherlock lifted his chin and gave Greg a brief nod of affirmation. Not a rapist or a serial killer, then.
“Yeah, bit of a mind- fuck, that….but we’re here now, with a candle and everything” , he gestured to the customary little tea-light flickering on the table between them, “on a proper not-a-date, again”.
“Now ask yourself Sherlock” John smiled casually, looking directly into his eyes “Would I do a thing like that?” he broke into a throaty laugh.
“Uncle Nigel couldn’t make it”, Sherlock said with a smirk, “so there’s a room free, if you should want it…further down the hall….”
“Because you’re a bloody idiot, that’s why. And weed for god’s sake, why? As if the bloody cigarettes aren’t bad enough”.
The prick was going to deny it. John shook his head, incredulous, “Sherlock you prick…Sherlock…who did you think the ambulance was for? Aren’t you supposed to be the one in charge when you’re not chasing after teenage boys?”
“Indeed…would it not be better to learn of these things from a master, one who knows what he is about? I was curious, how it would taste, how it would feel, to give yourself over like that to the bestial urge for a cock, lodged deep inside…”
“Only because you’re so good at giving them John, and in every variant known to the English language, however, I was thinking about engaging in something a bit more….
“I love my brother”, she began, taking a breath to gather herself, the sleeves of her jumper tucked over her hands like mittens against the cold, “Him and mum are all I have”, she went on, staring off across the carpark into space, “and so I hurt when he hurts and it’s the same for him. I was pleased you know, that night when he texted me, all excited and confused cause he’d seen some boy in a crowd that made him question himself”, she turned to look at him fully then, eyes a little glassy with a sheen of tears, “It was a long time coming, and so I told him to go for it, encouraged it because Sarah was a dead loss, anyone with a pair of eyes could see he wasn’t into her even at the start, but I already knew the real reason even if no-one else did, it was always just a smokescreen”.
“I don’t mean to be thick” John interrupted “but what the fuck is going on? I’m guessing embarrassing photo’s but not the kind you would win two-hundred quid for on ‘You’ve Been Framed’?”
“Does he get in that sort of trouble a lot then?” John asked, moving fully into the room to where Greg indicated an array of cereal, bread and jam. He took a bowl and filled it with a generous helping of coco-pops (who the hell would eat coco-pops in this house? Mycroft?)
Oh dear, reader, you must be overcome with mirth at my ignorance, her reference to ‘nieces’ and ‘nephews’ meaning naught to my unsullied mind, foolish child that I was. I fully believed her assertion that her home was a form of gentleman’s club where the men could come to relax and feel free, a fine port-wine and good conversation acting as balm against the vagaries of their day.
John’s face broke into a grin as Sherlock slid into the seat across from him, and took a nervous sip from a glass already filled with his favourite red wine.
Sherlock felt ill. But he had to give him credit, the smile barely faltered as he approached, only one slight hesitation in his step as their eyes met, a muscle in his cheek jumping a little with the strain of holding a neutral expression. She didn’t have a fucking clue.
Sherlock plucked out a condom from under his hat (Really?), ripped it open and rolled it on, and with a squirt of lube for good measure he steadied John’s cock with one hand and slowly sank down. It took every ounce of willpower not to come, the friction just from Sherlock sliding down sparking sensations so intense his vision was spattered with a galaxy of tiny white stars.
“No, I haven’t got plans”, he said, “And I’d like that…the…thing…you were suggesting…so yes, a date Friday would be nice”.
“Don’t be… I just hadn’t got round to deleting this nonsense yet…..why here?” he looked around the unfamiliar street, coat flapping dramatically from side to side, it was suburban, bland, completely devoid of distinguishing landmarks or features, that was, until a familiar figure came into view.
Be careful what you wish for, John thought evilly, as he fucked forward roughly now, smirking as Sherlock’s arms gave way slightly with the force of his movement.
Sherlock’s bedroom was just as much of an apocalyptic disaster zone as the last time he had been here, even worse if that was possible, clothes draped over every surface and dirty pants and socks all over the floor. Books on forensic science and criminology teetered in uneven piles around the large mahogany desk, which in turn was strewn with what looked like the entire contents of a chemistry lab, an enormous professional microscope taking the central place.
“Frank? That fucking cunt? He’s got a whole heap of trouble coming that motherfucker has. Thinks he’s the fucking king now. Gonna end up with a bullet in his brain real soon. Got it coming.”
By dinner time, the entire school was a-buzz, everyone eager for a glimpse of the new kid as every House table was crowded with chattering bodies. The kitchen elves had truly outdone themselves tonight, John thought as he tucked into a hearty meal of Beef Wellington and roast potatoes, followed by a generous helping of treacle tart. It was practically an orgasmic experience after a sad lunch of floppy ham sandwiches in the library while he and Mike, his Hufflepuff lab partner hurriedly caught up with the potions homework they had left over from the week before.
“Here you go then, my very finest … and don’t go shoving this up all at once, I don’t cut with crap, you got that?” Sherlock nodded mutely, taking the proferred drugs, shoving them into an empty cigarette packet then into the depths of his coat.
“Wait - is that literally or metaphorically?” John’s grin split his face as he confidently slung one thick, jean-clad thigh across the motorcycle saddle to straddle it and gave a wriggle to get comfortable. Sherlock started to sweat again despite the cool interior of the workshop. He flinched as John gunned the engine and the bike sprang to life with a roar.
“The ship itself, what was the word amongst the sailors when she was lost, or passengers from the Mediterranean sea?” He face darkened and he glanced around in fear. “The Spanish don’t have her, but that’s all I know, they may ‘ave done, first off, but pirates is what I heard, common enough in the West Indies these days and not something the Spanish would be wanting to admit to… makes ‘em seem weak ya see…they can’t be ‘avin that”. I nodded, my mind whirling with a myriad possibilities. “I’m sorry, for the loss of your brother lad, terrible business, but attack by the Spanish, and pirates too….”, he shook his head sadly, and what else he planned to say hung unfinished in the air. But his meaning was clear, he saw my search as a fruitless task and pitied me for it, imagining me clutching at straws.
“You….why did you do that…how could you even know that would happen?” he gasped once sure he had regained the use of his vocal cords for something other than embarrassing animal noises.
The adrenaline brought John close to the edge now, Sherlock could feel his muscles, all tensed like a tightly coiled spring. He fisted his own cock in tandem, a mess of sloppy wet sounds in the air. John stifled a moan as he came, and hot bitter liquid filled his mouth, pulsing out in long shuddering spurts. He swallowed what he could as the rest dribbled slowly down his chin. He buried his head in John’s thigh as he reached his own release, spilling over his fist and marking the bottom of John’s best jeans.
John sighed, and made his final attempt to break Sherlock’s resolve of ‘don’t get involved’, “Would you maybe….I don’t know…I thought it might be nice….look, I’m crap at all this but I really, really enjoyed what we did…so would you maybe like to do it again sometime?….I could take you out somewhere if you’d like”.
These Sunday afternoons were his favourite time, spending long lazy hours in the park, tossing sticks and playing fetch, when he could forget that they had no money to decorate his new room and that all his friends were sixty miles away living a life that John Watson was no longer a part of.
bike. It was black and silver with flashes of red down the sides, much, much larger than he’d thought, and seriously bloody intimidating. Sherlock’s mouth went dry. He simply didn’t
‘Susan my dear’ she said, ‘Young Sherlock has come to be my new nephew, take his things up, there’s a good girl, he shall share with Tom and a very pretty pair they will make don’t you think?’
He told me how his companions had abandoned him when on seeing me in the hallway he had declared there and then to them that he would have no other, and being as he was in no condition to enjoy the pleasures of one of the ladies of the house he had retired to the comfort of a warm chair and drank port until he passed out. But now he said, imagine his joy on waking to see the one whom had made so much more than an ordinary impression upon him here at his knee and looking so lovely?
A boy was lounging width-ways on his stomach across the end of a double-bed, rummaging through a box of CD’s, a half-finished cigarette dangling between plump lips while his eyes squinted against the drifting smoke. The boy looked up and glanced around absently, as if surprised to find himself there, or maybe he was just surprised that anyone had bothered to ask. He shrugged, took another drag and exhaled.
That short blond hair slightly ruffled by design, his strong compact body hidden beneath a smart white shirt, grey trousers and a matching grey tie. He wore glasses too, thin wire frames that curled around his ears. He looked at Victor wide-eyed and panicked and his friend stared back in confusion. Sherlock pointed to the marks on his neck and then forward to the front of the class.
“And what did I have left to lose exactly? I’ve lost everything already…and anyway, you were hardly trying to fight me off Victor….if it wasn’t for the nose bleed I’d be balls deep in your arse right now!”
With the hard, studded case held tightly in my hand we waked back down the high-street in the hope of procuring a carriage for the journey home when my attention was caught by a display of ladies bonnets and intricately embroidered tablecloths and linen napkins. John frowned as I stopped short and looked up at the blue painted sign above the door.
The bed dipped beside me and John, fully dressed in outdoor garb sat by my side. He cocked his head and peered at me amused, taking in my disheveled hair, even wilder than was usual, the pallor of my skin and the ugly scents of my sins still upon me. Sweat, puke, drink, smoke and the tainting touch from the opium room.
Later, his mother found other more unpalatable excuses not to have him round, that went way beyond ‘I don’t like him’, straying into such territory as ‘he’s not like us, too posh, rude little arsehole, weird compared to your other friends’ to the absolute clincher ‘I don’t want him upstairs in your room John’.
Not for long though. Two pairs of hands made quick work of his jumper, jeans and pants, and he tossed them over the side to join Sherlock’s in a heap on the floor.
Now, on waking, I had cause to reap the less pleasurable effects of that which we had sown the day before, a sore head and mouth like an arid desert from the wine and a stinging arse from a most delightful fucking, of which I was determined never to issue a word of complaint, for I would endure much discomfort for the chance to drown in those liquid sweets again.
“So, any idea who’s on tonight?” he asked Mary as they walked back a little, away from the front of the stage, not wanting to stand too close.
Victor had shoved on ahead, shouldering his way to the bar and returned minutes later, flushed with success and brandishing a drink in each hand. With straws for god’s sake, how gay could he possibly get?
Sherlock sighed as he leant against a wide brick pillar, rolling his eyes at Victor who was currently, fending off the unwanted attention from a teenage girl with a non-existent gaydar. He stepped up behind him and licked a stripe up the side of Vic’s neck, sucking down hard on the skin beneath his jaw, Vic fisted a hand in the back of his hair, and dragged Sherlock’s head up, smashing their mouths together in a kiss that was as wet and noisy and as disgustingly slurpy as they could make it.
. He picked up a shoe this time and hurled it across the room, it smacked off the wall and left a black streak across the painted surface.
Sherlock just scowled as he watched him melt back into the shadows and quickly jog away. The cheeky little shit.
We would not be here much longer. If we did not find Mycroft, or work, we would be out on the streets or worse.
Sherlock looked rather smug. “Fitter than you for one…Oh my god, stop being such a baby,” he said, poking John in the side with his toe. “Get up.”
“Not on your account…you have proved that…you plucked me from a brothel after one sweet kiss, and for that, I would have followed you anywhere”.
“And do you know why an all?” My face turned blank and he smiled triumphant. “Thank the lord…John would’ve had my head if you knew”.
The boy sighed “ I had a mother once, father too, a nice house, clean clothes, food on the table, all of that just like your son, but all it takes is the toss of a dice and…”
The large black car pulled away from the kerb, did a smart u-turn and re-joined the flow of traffic back in to central London.
Mike sat at a table in the corner to the left with a half-full pint in front of him, he was flipping beer mats and munching on a large bag of Walker’s salt & vinegar crisps. John caught his eye as he picked up his drink for another mouthful and he hand-signed ‘do you want another’ at him from across the room. Mike nodded eagerly. John bought the drinks and headed over careful to sit on a stool opposite, not squeezed together on the more comfortable upholstered bench. Mike noticed and raised an eyebrow at him.
“Won’t we get into trouble for abuse of government property or something?” John broke the awkward silence between them, as he swept up the pictures and stepped back outside, “I’d love to see the identity parade for this”
But someone else didn’t agree with him, apparently. The music snapped off rather abruptly and Sherlock stuttered to a halt, his beautiful expressive face twisted into an ugly scowl.
‘This is what you do to me’, he said, ‘just the sight of you here in the bed beside me watching as I sleep, so innocent, thinking still that you have not the right to reach out and touch me as you wish. What are you afraid of? That now I have had my way I will abandon you?’
“John! Christ, I didn’t hear you come in there,” he said, and pressed a hand against his chest in that exaggerated, slightly fake way people did when acting more surprised than they actually were. “Just a few more invoices to sort through,” he sighed, and gave a wan smile, shuffling the A4 sheets into an untidy pile before stuffing them into a buff-coloured binder. He put his pen down and rubbed at his eyes. “Should be done around eight though, if you can wait that long to eat. Oh!”  He attempted to stifle a jaw splitting yawn and sat up taller.  “Sorry, I didn’t see your friend there John. Who’s this then?”
