I left Dean Winchester, the brightest soul I had ever seen, the strongest human I had even known, inside that grave.
Dean nodded slowly, obvious satisfied and about to leave. In a moment, he would apologize for insisting, and they would likely never discuss it again.
Sam had explained what he could about Dean’s condition, including Rowena’s description of the Black Grimoire. Castiel knew there was nothing he could do to reverse the magic but was hopeful his presence might be able to help in some way. He was a damn seraph, after all.
Tentatively, a warm hand settled into the space between his neck and shirt collar, and as much as he could without doing the man harm, he shared the sensation of true celestial harmony.
Warm arms pressed him close, and that whiskey voice grumbled into his ear yet again: “Thank you for letting yourself be found.”
It was just a few hours drive to the sandbox, and no one—to his astonishment—challenged him as he made his way into Heaven. He walked down the blank white corridor expecting aggression with every step. But there was only the echo of his footsteps in Jimmy’s high-top shoes, step after step. When he reached Door 1514, he opened it.
Cass shook his head, then carefully shrugged. “There is no sense of connection to anything, actually. It is easy to stay detached, to watch humans die by the hundreds of thousands and not care.”
Now, as we kissed and he walked me back a few steps to the bed, I knew the places inside were not just filled with Dean, but with myself, with the person I had become once I knew Dean, and Sam, and Charlie, and Bobby, and Jody, and Claire—lovely, damaged, fierce Claire. I had become a community, and every voice inside me clamored for Dean in its own tone.
He’s wondered a thousand times now if it would have been different with his mother still alive. If he hadn’t had to be Sammy’s surrogate nanny, would his nurturing side have been less obvious? Would his father’s eyes have still looked at him that particularly damning way?
The day of the contest was as bad as Dean feared. Considering the (non)readership of the books, he’d thought the photos they saw online were probably all the contestants that would show up.
“I don't know how it is with Mounties up in Canada, but down here a gay cop is tolerated, even trotted out on Political Correctness Day for a round of applause, but his life . . . it ain't easy, Fraser.”
“Dean and Cass are my parents,” he said at last. “Many people’s parents are married.” He shrugged. “That would make me just more like other people, and I do like that.”
With great relief, Sam closed the laptop, a real plan starting to hatch in his mind. He was going to do the most dangerous thing he could think of because, if it didn’t work, Dean was going to kill him.
Dean frowned at me. “Don’t be sorry. It’s not, this isn’t—” He shook his head then set his mouth almost like he was going into a bar brawl. “Don’t feel sorry about anything, all right? As long as you’re in this with me—”
Mandy, who had not been even remotely interested in Dean for some unfathomable reason, smiled at him in a way that even Castiel could understand.
He’d also had some prime rib cut off the bone, a perfect ham and cheese omelet, sweet potato soufflé (which tasted just like pumpkin pie), and hash browns.
“I’m here, Dean,” that voice said, and it was better than any music, any clap of thunder, any sound ever. “I’m sorry.”
“Yeah.” Dean shrugged. Somehow this was almost as bed as watching Cass go down on him, and he couldn’t even start to think about that. “I mean, you know. You and me. We go back a long ways now.”
I cold feel his surprise and relished it. He was always underestimating me. For some reason he’d decided my desire for him was some sort of challenge, or even a bluff, and I was going to call him on every card.
With a nod, he walked to his room, took off his coat and shoes, and lay on the bed with the TV remote. Something played on the screen, but he found himself mostly watching his fingers as they plucked the empty air.
All in all, it was ten days after Sam knew what he had to do before he could actually start doing it.
Cass looked, of all things, hurt, but then he cleaned his face. “I am doing my best to honor Jimmy Novak’s life, Dean, which includes looking after his daughter. But if you are asking if I ‘feel’ particularly male or female, the answer is no.”
If asked, at that moment I would have given my blade to have Sam or Jack walk in with news of a new hunt. In a romantic comedy, the wacky neighbor would show up right now with some wild sexual discussion of underwear or complaining about not being able to sell their salt-and-pepper shaker collection on eBay.
“Aimed at you? Are you saying that your being friends with me has caused people to question your intentions with me?”
“I'm not angry with you, Benny. Mind you, I should be, but…” Ray shrugged. “This isn't the first time this has happened.”
“She said she wouldn’t take him until he was happy. So I figure, you guys make each other happy, and Cass is thinking the Shadow will come and take him away, this time for good.”
With a pleased hum, he rolled onto his back, and then frowned. One place was a lot sorer than it had ever been before. In fact, he frowned harder, his ass damn well hurt.
In fact, they began to talk about how Jack had been comparing police reports across states and found specific word groupings that hindered their searches for similar crime reports.
“When we got to the mansion, Cass could sense great power, so we didn’t storm in. We spent two days watching them, but we didn’t learn anything but that they got their groceries delivered and one of them was really into the roses growing in the front yard.
“Sam! Cass is here! And you—” He pointed at Rowena, who was watching with a sad smile. “Uh, with the hair. This is Cass!”
Dean came out after that, hands wet and belt open, grinning at them all. Sam handed him a bottle of water, which Dean stared at like it held the wonders of creation. Then he and Rowena left.
I took a step, backing him up against the metal kitchen island and breaking out in a shiver of delight as his hips pressed flush against mine. He was not, of course, hard, but I was getting there. Indeed, it occurred to me that I wasn’t going to be able to do this again. In a moment, Dean would extricate himself and all this would just be packed away, a memory of a glitch in our odd relationship.
Those eyes flashed with grief. “I tried, Dean. I tried everything I could think of to get them to let you go. I begged. Sam begged. We offered everything we could think of that didn’t involve another human life. They were adamant.”
Cass tagged along, sitting in the booth the whole time Dean shoved waffles and whipped cream into his mouth, one of his hands wrapped tightly around the small harp in his pocket.
Cass moved, rubbing them together from what felt like head to toe, and Dean just suddenly came, like he was a teenager or something. He moaned into Castiel’s mouth (or maybe it was more like a grunt), and the body on top of his moved again, prolonging the sweet relief of it all as soft lips kissed his chin and neck and shoulder.
. The publication presented a world the angel knew had never existed, with a strange nostalgia for the non-present. The sanitized, sentimental portrait of family, of America, and humanity in general was unsettling yet soothing. It was myopic, jingoistic, and incredibly exclusive, but still, it was an attempt to see an ideal world on Earth: a White, suburbanized Paradise that was oddly adorable, like a stiff pair of bunny slippers.
“Yes, but the problem is that we don’t have tickets, the thing is totally sold out, and they don’t need anyone on the crew,” Sam said. “In fact, they’re being really protective about the crew because of fans who’re trying to sneak onboard.”
Powerful, hot, and hard, Cass thrust inside him, setting everything Dean could feel to maximum. Several more thrusts followed, each perfect. Dean spared a thought for partners who had fucked him before and knew how nothing, really, the whole ordeal had been. He’d come, and it had felt all right. But so what?
“I would be more than willing to risk the Shadow for Dean’s sake. My decision not to pursue the matter has to do with Dean’s feelings, not my fears.”
But Cass was on a roll. “Sometimes, it’s a matter of not having a connection you’ve relied on for thousands and thousands of years, something you took for granted, a connection you sacrificed for a cause you felt was worth it. And sometimes it’s about being reminded that no matter how hard you try, you need that connection more than you need to be noble, more than you need to believe in anything, even God, even the salvation of mankind.”
He looked at me then, just for a second. I watched his shoulders hunch just slightly, which was incredibly wrong. “Well, a poor moment, or a good one.”
I spread my hands in honest perplexity. “I am the same as I have been for some time.” Then I had an idea of what he might mean. “I can assure you that Naomi is not controlling me. Neither is anyone else other than myself. Although, of course, if I were being controlled by another, I suppose I would say that. If there is some sort of test—”
“You’ve got to get him out of here,” he told Cass, who stopped scratching his back long enough to pay some attention. “You got to beam him to, like, Montana, anywhere but here.”
Fraser seemed to get it this time, and Ray was about to breathe a sigh of relief and change the subject when that Canadian cultured voice asked at a volume just to match his own, “What other time has this happened, Ray?”
“I don’t believe that will be necessary, Dean,” Cass said, applying the perfect amount of pressure to his dick. “I am bringing you to fulfilment. As I understand it, that should suffice.” He twisted his fingers, rippling the pressure, and Dean shouted in joy. It was like getting a hand job from a professional: perfect if indifferent. But it felt so good.
For a day, Castiel sat in the Bunker library, remembering days Before Angel Fall. He remembered flying. He remembered the power of being a Seraph as he stood toe-to-toe against the Archangel Raphael, before he’d allowed his own obsession and then the million souls of Purgatory to turn him into that mutant beast that still shamed him to his last vibration.
And then I felt, as I have often felt, a different sort of pride. Not one of them, even Jack, found anything wrong with my words.
Anyway. Whereas Dean had only been with women, as far as Sam knew, which was far enough, Castiel might just be the exception.
Dean had no idea where the words in his mouth came from. “And if Famine offers to scratch your back?”
“But.” Jack shook his head and turned to look at them all with sad eyes. Then a thought struck him, and he turned back to the angel. “Is this about what the Shadow said?”
“I don’t care.” Cass got his eyes open long enough to see Dean shoot him a look of disbelief, and then those strong, gentle hands were on him, stroking, squeezing, petting, pumping.
Castiel took a deep breath, which technically did nothing for his blood oxygen levels but still made him feel a little better.
Once Sam, Dean, and their mother were safely back in the Bunker after their horrific capture, imprisonment, and asinine deal with Billy, Lucifer had been pulled out of the president, and Castiel had apologized deeply to Lily Sumner, the angel found himself, as he often did at night, looking through the archives.
Instead, he was in a room, kind of like what you’d expect from some meditation spa that charged you $2,000 a day literally just for breathing. Polished, smooth wood made up the walls, floor, and steepled ceiling. The air was odd, kind of soft, like the golden light.
“Finally, we decided to send someone to the front door with a grocery delivery who would explain the order was a mistake. We set you up with a couple bags, you went up by yourself, and then you went inside instead of staying on the porch.”
The remaining host of Heaven despised him, as well they should, yet playing with them had made him feel something he thought he had lost forever with a bloody sigil smeared on the white wall of a beautiful room.
So when I say “everything,” I only mean everything that mattered to me, which is very small indeed when weighed on the scale of the universe.
“Something tells me you’re going to tell us things aren’t so great for you upstairs anymore,” Bobby said.
The trappings were more than comforting: the aluminum table with that sharp ridge around the edge, the aluminum and vinyl chairs, the smells of sausage and waffle batter and (just a hint) of disinfectant. As Castiel sat around the table with Sam, Dean, Mary, and Wally, he felt completely at home.
“You don’t need to laugh, Dean,” that voice said next, and only then did Dean realize he’d been about to burst into hysteria.
Dean put up his hands. “No, I mean, I’m not saying yes, OK? I’m just, I’m just—I don’t know what I am.”
“Cass, seriously, I need you to come clean here.” Dean actually turned away and paced to the nearby wall, then spun back around. “It’s driving me crazy.”
The man drank the bottle in one go, looked amazed, and handed the plastic container back to Castiel.
“Uh, yeah.” Dean looked around the motel room and realized they were in the Super 8 off I229. “Look, I’ll be there in an hour, OK?”
“Can we just start over from square one?” Jo asked, looking even younger than usual in a white t-shirt and jeans, sitting very close to her mother as though to hide the scent of her omega distress. He noticed she had new boots, looking shiny with flowers on the toe.
Sam nodded and followed the others down a corridor that he was really hoping led to Dean. He couldn’t help thinking that he’d almost died so often it was getting kind of boring. He tried to shake it off and get his head back in the fight, but mostly he just thought about how he seriously needed to have a long talk with Eileen.
“At our initial nativity, perhaps because God, Chuck, was already thinking of humans, most of us did feel a certain pull toward a gender identity. And I did feel, I believe, a certain bias toward being masculine. I understand that others of my brothers and sisters also felt such a pull.”
“Yes, and it’s very dark, very powerful, but disorganized.” Jack shook his head, frowning. “It feels lost.”
Such was the way of humans. They loved more than any angel could comprehend, but that love was more complicated than they could appreciate.
Being unable to meet Dean’s eyes made me feel weak. I have taken on the hounds and demons of hell. I have slaughtered the enemy on the battlefield. I damn well wasn’t going to be weak because Dean Winchester decided he wanted to look me in the eye.
“I don’t think that was all there was to it. But anyway, I’ve met several angels now, and you’re not like them. They’re wind-up toys, little soldiers who need orders or they just start killing everything around them. You have a heart, and a conscience.”
A day later, they were in a diner. Not for the first time, Cass thought about how Sam and Dean used diners the same way he had once used Biggerson’s. The wonderful sameness of it all was a sort of home even in a place he’d never been before. Castiel knew the role the Impala had played in preventing the Apocalypse, the surgical cut into Sam’s childhood memories and love for his brother brought on by the history of that tribute to American heavy metal. Diners were somewhat like that to him now. In fact, he doubted he would be able to behave properly now in a fancy restaurant.
“And Bobby?” The hunter looked around, already calming, already softening his body to lie back and conform to the planes and angles of his alpha’s lean form. Those blue eyes were brilliant in the morning light, and his lips seemed just slightly chapped, begging for someone to moisten them.
Dean Winchester was, well, seriously, Dean Fucking Winchester. Dean had raised him while their father was off chasing the Yellow-Eyed Demon. Dean had brought him back into the life Sam now realized he should never have tried to leave.
I used every bit of knowledge and skill I had to make him just as he had been, minus a few scars and some plaque in his arteries. I gave his liver a little polish as well.
God, no wonder Castiel preferred humans to angels. What would that even be like? To fight alongside his brothers and sisters for thousands of years and have no bond? To know no love at all?
He didn’t need Google to tell him to be gentle. Cass looked about two seconds away from jumping to Jupiter. With a low hum for warning, he reached out his right hand to touch the nearest tuft of feathers, surprised-but-not when his fingers touched fluff.
Castiel actually looked regretful. “I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be overwhelming for humans. So can my voice, but you already knew that.”
Sam had a cut on his forehead, and Rowena looked a little ruffled, but she threw the Black Grimoire on the bed, flipped to a page, and began chanting. A flash of light and a small shockwave later, and the magic was flung from Dean’s body. In a moment, the man was standing there fully again.
Sam hugged his brother while Rowena explained the spell. Soon afterwards, Dean announced he was starving, and Rowena took her leave—without the Black Grimoire—and Sam took Dean to a 24-hour waffle house.
slithered over his friend’s brain. Closing his eyes, he pushed back with warmth and love, willing him to remember at least that he was safe, that Castiel was watching over him.
Castiel nodded. “Yes, absolutely, but not just food. I mean, everyone seems to be starving for something: sex, attention, drugs, love—”
Dean swallowed his first sentence; he didn’t know what it was going to be anyway. God, he just wanted this to be over. But over for what? Where was he supposed to go from here? Where was anyone supposed to go from here?
“Yes, the car is fine, Dean,” Sam said, turning to go back inside while Bobby shook his head and turned as well, though his grip on his shotgun didn’t loosen, and Dean reminded himself a person didn’t have to be an angel to know the love a man had to have for an awesome car.
For a split-second, the angel looked at him with an extreme expression the hunter didn’t recognize, but then perhaps it was just a twitch. Angels twitched, didn’t they? Cass seemed perfectly normal as he asked in confusion, “Other stuff?”
In peace, angels really had nothing to do but watch, and as he’d once explained in the back of a 1967 Impala to a new Prophet, watching humans had been incredibly boring.
Like fraternity brothers, she’d noted with PowerPoint going strong, young male dolphins spent time together roaming the seas and doing stunts to impress each other. In fact, very much like frat brothers passing around a joint, dolphins in such groups loved finding a pufferfish. The deadly toxins in pufferfish actually made the dolphins (and humans who ate the fish as fugu) high in trace amounts. The dolphins would pass the bewildered pufferfish around, each holding the deadly creature in their mouths to “get a hit,” until they’d all had a turn.
Sam hated that idea. He hated that so many hunters were absolutely determined to survive yet had completely given up on living. They were like anti-zombies, dead set on saving the world even as their own lives become nothing but death.
Sam knew, if Castiel’s vessel were female, Dean would have been all over that about a dozen times, if not more. Damn, Sam might have . . . no, OK. He didn’t want to go there. Thinking about Castiel in whatever form really was like thinking about a sibling.
So one day, while Jack was reading, Dean was sleeping, and Castiel was doing whatever it was Castiel did when they weren’t saving the world, Sam sat down on his bed with a brand new composition book and decided he would make his brother happy.
Oh yeah, Dean hadn’t heard that last one. Technically, Castiel hadn’t either, but he heard all about it later. Angels just loved to taunt him with what their brothers and sisters had to say about him.
“Yeah, but . . .” Dean looked down at the last of his burger. He hated when he ran out of everything but bun and meat, especially when the meat was unseasoned chuck and the bun was stale. He looked back up at Castiel’s neutral expression.
, he found himself adding with a sudden frown. Technically, he’d abandoned it in Heaven when he rebelled against the Apocalypse and was no longer something he could claim, but as it was uniquely his as much as his blade was, it was still something he could claim to “own.”
The dark-haired head shook ruefully back and forth even as his hips moved as regularly and relentlessly as a piston, each pounding thrust deep inside the man’s body insisting on pleasure and wringing it from him.
After awhile, he even managed a sort of schedule with the host of Heaven. If he played celestial melodies, at least two or three, sometimes many more, would join in. Earth-bound tunes would leave him solo.
I raised my chin, ready for the blow, even as Dean continued, “A little too much water under that bridge.”
Sam and Dean weren’t in the bunker when he returned, but they had left a note about a vampire hunt in Oklahoma, which agreed with the half-dozen messages on his phone, four from Sam, two from Dean.
“You’re both perfect!” He winked at them. “I hope you win! I’ve already got my ticket. Sure hope you’re going to get on board with me!”
“What? We go through all that, and I get a hand job scene?” Dean threw up a hand, signaling for another moment, and then shook his head. “That’s not what I mean.”
After to-go coffee, toast, and bacon for Dean and absolutely nothing from Cass, the angel asked, “Are you ready to go home now?”
And indeed, what does it matter? Dean, Sam, and so many more of them have been closer to me than any angel I ever knew.
There were plastic water bottles on the table and notepads with pens. Dean grabbed a bottle to take a a drink, then sat away from Ruby next to Castiel.
“All right,” Sam said. “Jane and Collin both lived in Lewisville, Texas, a suburb outside Dallas-Fort Worth.”
“And just how is me doing the mattress mambo with our best friend supposed to make me happy? Cass is our brother, Sam, not some skirt in a bar.”
As usual, Milton got the whole thing wrong. When angels decide to mate, the last thing they’re thinking about is a lack of physicality, let alone blushing.
Indeed, I could have, had I wanted to, dominated Dean with my knowledge. I could have applied all manner of techniques that I knew, but I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to approach this as an experiment or a contest. I wanted Dean to—
Anyway, Dean comes into the bunker under a witch’s spell desperate to fuck. Yes, desperate. He’s sweating. He’s trembling. He’s—
Ah, now there’s a concept angels aren’t used to. Like all other angels, I saw humans in their clothing, naked, skeletal, cellular, spiritual forms whenever I looked at them. Before Dean, the most visible layer truly didn’t matter.
Sometimes, when he was a little drunk from a liquor store or two, Cass thought about how he would be content with just a prolonged hug. But then that usually led into a fantasy of wrapping his grace (what was left of it) around Dean’s soul and blurring the lines, so there was that.
“Jack is wrong.” The angel shook his head, looked around the room, and then seemed to settle in place. “The Shadow’s threat cannot dictate my life. If it comes for me, it comes.” He shot Jack an irritated look. “There was no need to mention that.”
“That’s exactly the look you gave me back when you were working with Crowley and wouldn’t admit it.”
“They had another one last year,” Sam said as he swiped his phone to what would doubtlessly be more hellish images.
And it was worth remembering that breaking Dean out of that mental loop and explaining that his “dream come true” was just a dream had taken all of about sixty seconds.
Castiel frowned. “I’m an angel, Dean. We don’t have genders or gender-based preferences of any kind.”
Castiel made a show of calming himself, then frowned in concentration. “I asked if you wanted to watch television.”
I had stood idly by before, you understand. My last time on Earth, a woman and her Nephilim daughter had been declared enemies of Heaven, and I did my duty as a soldier.
When Dean knelt up on the bed and hugged him, it was with the same innocent intensity of when he had found him in Purgatory.
Dean tried but failed to keep from pushing his hips forward. Castiel’s ozone scent and warmth were too delicious.
Castiel glowered at the pristine burger in front of him. Sam had to admit it did look pretty good. Dean had added avocado this time.
Unsurprisingly, I thought about Vuviak, an angel in my garrison who had once gone on a mating dance and been rejected. She told me of the spiral of fire she had strewn across alien skies, of the drums she had made from the molten cores shaken inside half-formed planets, and of the solar winds she had ridden like a Valkyrie screaming for war with the last of the gods.
Sam thought about the first time he and Cass had gotten to the same level of friendship the angel and Dean shared, when he’d talked about what it meant to be human and given Sam hope that he could change. He thought about when Cass had come back from not just the dead but the Empty, standing at the pay telephone in a smelly back alley.
That last need had really been bad. His first heat, even on suppressants, Dean had spent hours on his knees and elbows, ass in the air, jerking off and crying because no one was there to fill him up, nothing warm and solid and real was shoving itself inside him.
There was a pause, and Dean knew to open his eyes again. Castiel was beyond beautiful, and his eyes were glowing with a bright blue light inside. Beyond the angel’s shoulders, Dean could see the dark shadows of his wings rising up once more.
And so despite walking into a room and seeing the entity I desperately longed for as my true mate display his wings, I controlled myself.
“Damnit, Cass. This is just stupid. You go in there with a need, Famine’s going to find a way to meet it. Isn’t that the point?”
And then he was lying on a bed of red satin sheets that felt like cool slides of lips and tongues against his hot skin. The relief was incredible, but so short-lived. He was burning, always burning.
“I can retrieve that for you if it becomes important,” Castiel told her. “But I doubt that will be the case.”
All I know is that only moments after one of the most unsettling moments of my existence—a moment caused by a t-shirt, of all things—I was standing in the bunker’s kitchen when Dean, Sam, and Jack sat down for breakfast, and I sat down with them. Dean, as usual, had given me some food. It was his way of saying that I was part of the social gathering, regardless of whether I ate. Additionally, he would eat the bacon off my plate with a particular satisfaction.
But two seconds of watching his brother come out of the bathroom, and Dean knew what was wrong even before Sam explained. Famine plus demon blood junkie equaled, well, shit.
Holding his stomach, Sam burst into laughter, rolling around a bit on his narrow bed. It was juvenile, maybe, but the thought of Castiel standing on a balcony in the moonlight did not allow any other response.
I really don’t care how. In the thousands of fantasies I’ve had now, my body remains somewhat vague. It is the image of Dean in the throes of sexual pleasure caused by touching me that enthralls me.
So, the angel took the man at his word, leaned forward, and took those lips he’d stared at for countless hours with his own. He put his hands around Dean’s body and ran his fingertips over the harp strings of his ribs and spine, feeling gently for the nerves with pressure that Dean would enjoy. He pressed forward, allowing his body (and yes, damn it, Jimmy hadn’t been there for years—it was his now) to absorb the heat of Dean presence.
“Don’t blame yourself,” Dean said automatically. Castiel had thrown his lot in with him and Sam. “I know you did everything you could.” He finally managed to look up at the angel, who was still staring at the floor. “Cass.” He waited until blue eyes flicked up to his. “I know you did what you could.”
Sam pointed at him. “Yeah, that’s right. That’s all sex has been for you since Lisa, some skirt in a bar. And lately, you haven’t even been bothered to do that. I mean, seriously. Can you even remember the last time you had a conversation with someone before you took her to bed?”
Dean smiled, letting me know that, angel or not, it was all right for me to be the follower here. Later—the thought of later filled me with pure delight—I would know more, in a practical, applicable sense, and I could take more of the lead.
The sheriff nodded, backed away, then turned around and hurried to her police SUV. Watching her, Dean spotted Baby a few yards back, looking freshly washed, and a vague tension he didn’t know he was carrying went away.
He thought about that rainy night in a dirty alley, kicking Dean’s ass and feeling pretty good about it. It was the most furious he had ever felt, before or since.
“Sometimes it’s about remembering why you go forward, why you bother to take another step. Sometimes it’s about wondering why you care when one opinion, one act of rebellion doesn’t just mean being cast out, it means being cut off. It means even when you need the simplest of acts from the community you’ve served for millennia, no one will touch you. No one will help you. No one will care as you suffer. No one will help even if you beg!”
“I get that you’re an angel of the lord, but we’ve still known each other, what, ten years now?” he asked.
“It won't work.” Castiel looked horrified for a second, and then made another non-expression. “He's already infected. The hunger is just going to travel with him.”
Waking up, Dean pondered Cass’ last words. At first, they had just seemed sentimental, a cute way of saying something nonsensical.
Dean Winchester woke up sore, the good kind, with a burn from repetitive use of his thighs, tender nipples, arms that felt stretched out and noodle-y. Even his lips were tired.
“Everyone to me!” the angel yelled, his alpha nature on blatant display. Even Ruby took a step closer to him. They all rushed forward, with Owen in Sean’s arms and Bobby grabbing a shotgun. Once the last of them, Jo, was within two feet of Castiel, Dean felt a familiar sense of flying.
Something far to his right moved. Whipping his head around, he prepared to drop his angel blade, then stilled.
“Jack!” Castiel looked angry now. “I never thought I would need to explain this to you, but no means no.”
I pressed further against him, feeling the muscles of his thighs, the points of his nipples through his shirt. My arms tightened as I slid my hands back behind him, enjoying the play of muscles and bone. My wings, broken and invisible as they were, flared up and out, and for a moment I almost felt I was flying again.
So he had to watch his best friend start to fold up into himself for at least three seconds before he managed to clear his throat.
They split up again, though this time Sam took Jack. Cass and Dean were still glaring (or whatever that was) at each other.
For a moment, an hour, Spock pressed his lips to the back of that hand, then, so slowly, Spock opened his lips just slightly, to taste him.
Cass wasn’t looking at him anymore, staring at the window as though it had personally offended him. “Yes.” He briefly looked into Dean’s eyes, then away. “They would have taken anyone, but it had to be a man.” Cass looked at the floor. “We asked if it could be an aggressive female, someone like Pamela, or someone.” His voice, small at that point, trailed off.
“So, we’re dealing with a coven strong enough to hide their presence from an angel,” Castiel said, “though I am at low power.”
Melek and Vangelis, vibrations of sub-sonic tunes conjoining and entreating, lost from sight as well as sound and yet everywhere, twirling and dancing in a harmony even the cosmos had not achieved at its first joyous burst of creation. The sensation reached all around them, thrumming through Castiel himself and bringing his own vibrations into synch. The generous lovers shared their intimacy without breaking it, safe inside their own seamlessly matched knowledge.
“OK,” Dean said, just barely managing not to bow at the alpha waves his soulmate was currently blasting out.
“Yes!” the angel shouted. “You’re mine, Dean. Mine to fuck!” Then blue eyes were staring into his inner self—his soul, he guessed, as battered and secondhand as it was. “Claim me, Dean.”
He had once given them the gift of his blood to help them kill Dick, but that had hardly been an act of affection on his part, just one more act of loyalty to his brothers in arms.
But as great as they were as soldiers, I found them, and many other mated angels, most valuable for counseling. Taking on so much consideration for another as they had, their scope of thought was so much greater, so much father in range, than the average angel’s. I so greatly envied them for their ability to see so much.
But here I was, listening to them talk about surveillance methods and completely agreeing with their importance, and all the while I was thinking about Dean in his entirety, every perfect layer.
“I keep almost making it to sleep. I’m right there, man, and then I know for a fact you said something important to me, and you gave me a music box.”
At first, the heat had actually felt good. It was a relief to know his bits and pieces did work when he allowed them to. The initial warmth through his torso and then out through his arms and legs was solid proof that his father’s cold stares and Sammy’s indifference—what did the kid know, anyway?—had nothing to do with his real body. He might be a lousy omega no one wanted, but his parts were doing just what they were supposed to.
Dean let go and stepped back with a child-like glee that Castiel had seen before, if rarely, but with a lack of shadows that was completely new.
“Dean,” Sam said, and Dean knew that tone. “You’re just back on your feet. Eat something, shower, shave, see if you head clears. Then we’ll talk.”
The angel made a sort of grumbling sigh, then passed back a squirt bottle full of, Dean discovered, plain water. With a nod, he misted up the feathers in front of him, then on down the length of the wings. Moving with a little more confidence, he went back over Cass’ wings until it looked like most of the fuzzy feathers were gone.
He had turned his back on his brothers and sisters, and his reward was a note left for him in an empty Bunker.
Instantly, I recognized them as a part of the logo for Metallica, an American heavy metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich. I knew Dean enjoyed them and that Sam and Jack enjoyed them somewhat less, but still enough to classify the sensation of listening to their music as pleasurable.
In fact, thinking of it, he’d been more obedient than ever following that day. Had he needed to prove to himself he had no choice but to follow orders? If so, it had only been Dean (and Sam) who had allowed him to see his life of obedience was foolish. Or worse, it had been just plain evil.
Even more oddly, I could not blame myself for what had happened, though I wanted to. There was no possibility that Dean could have enjoyed my body and never known my mind. It had been a wise if disappointing choice to show him how I truly felt before we had gone any farther, as it was all I had to give and not what he wanted.
Let me elaborate. An angel’s mate is never separated from them, though they are separate. The bond between mated angels means never being parted, even by galaxies.
“Dean and Cass will think about each other the way that Dean and Cass choose to think about each other!” Dean bellowed.
Dean gently combed his fingertips though the feathers near him. Several came loose, and then just disappeared.
Then he pulled back a self-conscious distance, looked at those full, somewhat dry lips and leaned back in.
“Cass!” Dean screamed, coming in thick ropes of semen after hours of denied orgasm. And for a while there, everything was just sort of blurry and gray and warm.
Slightly anxious blue eyes looked over at him. Never had the hunter been so aware of the gift Cass was to them.
But we are all limited to our own existence. As much as we try for empathy, human or angel, a central part of us counts our own life as the most relevant to the act of living, even when we sacrifice ourselves.
For the first time, Castiel looked angry. “How much detail do you want, Dean?” He stood up and walked away, staring at one of Donna’s paintings of a hunting blind.
Dean shrugged off his hand and got behind the wheel, which made his ass protest again. They didn’t talk in the car. Castiel stared out the window, and Dean put on a tape without looking at the label and just let it play over and over.
"You don't have a mate, not after T'Pring and Stonn. Is that disrupting anything? Do you need to be—Spock, help me."
“I went to the door and knocked. They let me in.” Castiel turned away slightly, looking up at the ceiling, then down at the floor. “They told me their spell required a sacrifice of carnal pleasure.”
I would like to pretend I wasn’t made proud when the word came down from on high that I had been chosen to rescue the Righteous Man from Hell. I took select members of my garrison (no mated couples) with me into the Pit. The filth and suffering we encountered just made us more prideful when we pulled him out.
Cass was on his feet now. “I brought you to orgasm that first time with my hand only! I did not get undressed. I didn’t look at you more than I had to! You experienced sexual pleasure, and then I went to the coven in supplication, and they denied I had done what I was told! The spell, their damn spell required some sort of level of erotic satisfaction that I had failed to bring from you!”
Sam wasn’t worried about himself so much. His heart was much more open than Dean’s. He’d loved Jessica, Madison, and Amelia. He’d even felt a bizarre and twisted sort of love for Ruby, that demon bitch. It didn’t make him shallow to know he could likely find another woman to love.
“All right,” he said when he could, sitting up and trying to ignore he was naked with a satin sheet pooled in his lap. Castiel was wearing his full getup, though his hair was especially bed-heady.
The angel held the blade up somewhat uncertainly and then, realizing she wanted to hold it, passed it over with the eagerness of someone approaching the dentist’s chair.
He looked at me some more. I shrugged in genuine acknowledgement that I had no idea what was going on.
But what a new fantasy I found! Dean has been hexed—which in real life I would do everything to counter, but this is a fantasy—and he comes barreling into the bunker. Sam and Jack are somewhere else.
Thinking about it, Castiel decided if he were for some reason to give Dean a present, it would be something for his car, Baby. Perhaps a nice wax job or some new tires.
And then came the final video. Dean saw himself laid out on a bed of red satin sheets while a specter of shadows rose up between his legs.
He just shook his head and tossed the damn cup on the floor, which was covered in rugs and pillows and candle wax. It didn’t have make a good thud.
“First, this has nothing to do with Eileen.” Sam scowled at the bed and then got out, standing two feet from his brother and crossing his own arms. “Second, I haven’t given up on Eileen, not by a long shot. I’m hoping like I haven’t been able to hope for anything for a very long time that she’s going to come back here and say she wants to take a shot.”
“The real Charlie,” Dean said, nodding and wishing this place sold beer, but with all the kids running around—more Jawas, Ewocks, Younglings, little Xenas, inevitable Elsas, and more Airbender boys and girls—soda was all they had on tap.
The angel looked away now, staring at the wall. “They said if I failed to give them what they ‘needed,’ they would throw you in some brothel in South America until you were . . . taken adequately. You still have my sigils on your bones. I could never have found you in time. There was nothing—”
Cass’ vessel wasn’t just some guy. After all, Jimmy Novak himself had left the building back when Raphael had blown him up like a “water balloon of wet soup.” Jimmy and his wife were sharing heaven now. Jimmy was gone.
There was a bit of a squabble after that, which Mary settled with a mission briefing that oddly involved a demon who liked night fishing.
“What?” Sam said, sitting up in bed and blinking as Dean stood up straight, crossed his arms, and glared at him with open anger. “What?” he repeated.
He scowled and shook his head. “You say that, but you’re still not going to tell me what’s going on with you, are you?”
For hours, long after they all go to sleep, I sat in the kitchen and imagined it down to the molecule: Dean Winchester enjoying himself with my body.
But that wasn’t fair. Dean knew that even as he backed up a step. It wasn’t right of him to jump to any conclusions now.
But he shook his head. “No, you don’t get to play dumb angel with me. You don’t, so help me, you don’t get to do that!”
“Look me in the eye and tell me you wouldn’t have hooked up with Cass already if his vessel were female.”
Dean laughs, and it feels damn good. He can’t remember the last time he’s laughed so hard. Sure, the fate of the world, blah blah blah, but everyone could wait a few seconds while he lay here in bed with his angel alpha and laugh at how the whole thing worked out: the barn, the exploding lights, a pair of incredibly blue eyes, and then having the first meaningful, mind-blowing sex of his life.
Castel had been so right, so dead-on accurate with every word. His “father’s scorn” and the way John had preened over Sam’s alpha status. The dark, savage disappointment when Dean was the faithful son and Sam left, like a man presented with second-best, a consolation prize of fatherhood.
A moment passed, and then Castiel was back, his hand gripping the arm of an attractive, familiar-looking woman in jeans, a black lace top, and black cowboy boots.
Jerry laughed and shook his head, then gathered up his “usual” from Aggy, which was short for Agnes, I could see. Ah, her parents, the owners, were Greek. That explained the place’s name.
Dean picked out some more feathers, trying to make a sort of grid pattern with his fingertips so he didn’t miss any. Even so, he managed to type another search into his phone.
“I know it freaked me out, OK? I know I just—haven’t you ever been overwhelmed? I was overwhelmed, OK? I had to think about it.” With a scowl, he pushed the door shut behind him and marched up to me. I stood automatically to face him. Besides, I didn’t want my face anywhere near his belt at the moment.
“Best food I’ve had on a case, that’s for sure,” he muttered, thinking about getting another slice of the breakfast pie.
Sam scowled at him. “No.” Then he had to acknowledge it was a fair question. “No, Dean and I are fine. But it is about Dean that I want to talk to you—well, Dean and Cass.”
Before the nixed Apocalypse, angels kept to their places. For all Naomi accused him of having a “crack in his chassis,” Castiel had kept to his assigned role. Whatever objections he had he kept to himself, unless it involved battle strategy, in which case he had always (yes, always) been able to explain why his plans were superior. When he’d been tapped to save the Righteous Man from Hell, he’d assumed that was why.
“Do you remember when we took on that vamp nest in Monroe, and Sam slipped and you stabbed that monster in the throat?”
Two brothers currently working a case that made no sense, Dean and Sam Winchester stood inside yet another generic motel room and looked at the black cliché of a briefcase on the generic pseudo-wooden table. Even though he was frustrated, Dean was a little relieved nothing looked back at them.
“Human” Castiel had had sex with April, and Castiel had let them know a few times he was “utterly indifferent to sexual orientation.” If Dean were willing, Sam seriously doubted the angel would mind than Dean was a man.
Personally, Castiel wasn’t convinced that returning Mary Winchester to life had been a truly “good” act by Amara, but he had to confess that seeing her in the flesh, so to speak, had been an experience that affected him deeply. This was the woman who birthed the two best human beings he’d ever met, two men chosen by destiny to bring about the end of the world (no actual paradise included, as far as he could tell) and who had instead given destiny “the finger” and were working to make the world better one case at a time.
Naked, we stood there a moment and regarded each other. I thought briefly of Thertarmiel and his incredible mating exhibition. But were Dean and I not now spread bare and wider than a galaxy? There was nothing I would not show him now. If he wanted to see my bowels I would cut myself open and display them.
“Dean.” Cass turned to faced him, his face intent but still oddly blank. “The trial to get you out was most unpleasant for you. You were under a spell. We got you out of there only through great suffering on your part. There’s no need for you to recall the horrors of—”
“Actually, I'd like you to come with me to the pre-mission briefing for SGA-1's little trip to PX7-819.”
In the end, all the others had returned to their duties, and Castiel played a song of mourning and remembrance, his fingers stiff with shame, and guilt, and grief.
Dean could only hope—pray—hope—that the ozone from the busted lights and general mustiness of the barn was keeping Castiel from smelling him and that the bad lighting was hiding the reshaping of his pants. God, this was worse than the hell he had just escaped.
Dean realized he was witnessing yet another unknown angel power. Castiel would pull them out from time to time: healing, fighting off curses, annoying a cosmic entity. Here was a new one: Dean was getting seriously turned on.
With the first sense of purpose in five days, I walked up to the register to pay for my coffee. A young woman in glasses with a hesitant smile rang me up.
Cass closed his mouth, then scratched his back some more. Finally, he said, “It’s an angelic instinct exacerbated by Famine’s influence.”
Dean frowned at him. “So, you think maybe you’ve found the future Mrs. Winchester and you think me and Cass should round things off?”
Staring at my coffee, I searched for something to be angry about, but I found nothing. I could not be angry with Dean for knowing what he wanted and what he didn’t. I could not be angry with myself for my feelings or my instinctual decision to share everything with the man I loved.
I have no idea what factors make Dean look like he could take Atlas’s burden from him and hold up the heavens—his bowed legs, his square shoulders, the symmetry of his face. But he looked like that now, standing in the doorway of some three-star hotel in jeans, work boots, a beige Henley, and a dark over shirt. He hadn’t shaved in a few days, I noticed, and the thought of dragging my lips along that stubble almost made me moan out loud.
Dean shouted out some nonsense or other like a vow before a church, meaning every word he didn’t remember two seconds later, but just ecstatic as all fuck.
But son of a bitch, that mouth. It was making him become unstuck in time, like Billy, floating through a place where it didn’t matter how they got there or why. They were here, and Castiel was starting to taste more and more like literal Heaven—the Heaven where Sammy set off fireworks, not where Zach was coming to rip them new owns.
That day in class, a woman whose name Sam couldn’t remember for the life of him had done a presentation on that song and compared it both to fraternity parties and the social behavior of young dolphin males.
“Nobody cares,” Dean told his brother. Then he looked across the table. “Cass, here’s the thing you need to know about waitresses, OK? They get hit on all day long, so you gotta bring your A game. But upside? They always smell like food.”
“You’re a freakin’ angel of the Lord, Cass,” he said next. “And not the Chuck version of the Lord, either. This was back when God was acting like God, smiting and answering prayers. You pulled me out of hell. You’ve lived for thousands of years.”
“Dean.” Cass tried to lift his legs, but they weren’t responding very well. “You can be inside me, if you want.”
Even more, I have read that some people quickly produce endorphins in response to pain, even quickly enough to be of use during a sexual episode, generating an opiate-like, euphoric response in the nervous system.
“No,” Dean said. “Sam and I are going to join the costume contest because, evidently, that’s the sort of crazy BS we do now.”
To say nothing of their obvious pleasure. On occasion a super-nova alert just turned out to be a mated angel couple having a particularly passionate episode.
“Cass, look, we’re not going to be, you know, eating each other for lunch, right? Angels don’t want to—”
When they’d started, the feathers had looked gray, but now their iridescence was much more apparent, and he could see black feathers like oil in the sun, covered in quiet prisms. He took a moment to spray a bit more water over the feathers, and they actually began to shine.
“I believe it’s time that everyone who sleeps goes to bed,” Cass said, putting his hand back on Jack’s shoulder to turn him around and shove him out of the room. “Alone.” The angel then followed Jack. Dean and Sam looked at each other for a moment before Dean seemed to realize he was the one in the wrong room. Without a word, he turned and left, closing the door quietly behind him.
The angel looked like someone had punched him in the chest. His words actually wheezed. “He wouldn’t do that.”
Not worrying about anything anymore, he leaned back, bringing a warm, naked, willing Cass with him, until the angel was lying over him like a weighted electric blanket. Dean wrapped his arms around the strong torso and opened his legs enough to let the slightly smaller body of his dance partner shimmy down between.
I want to make it clear at this point that I do not, and have never, watched Dean experience sexual congress, or onanism. I am only taking information from what Dean and Sam and others have expressed openly.
“The runes made it clear that you were to be offered up for your carnal sensation.” Castiel looked at him with all the emotion of a large rock. “Either Sam or I were to provide a partner for you, or they would.”
“Sam’s suggestion that you and I pursue a physical, romantic relationship is understandable, Dean. It is just also out of the question. As such, your refusal to entertain the possibility is not the actin of throwing anything away.”
The alpha moved just a bit more forward, and Dean could feel the heat from him now, a warmth that reached through his skin down to his muscles and then bones.
Sam scribbled some more in his notebook, trying to distinguish what he knew from what he felt from what he could prove.
Dean locked his knees. Slick was literally running down the inside of his right leg, and he realized he hadn’t taken a single suppressant since he’d returned from the grave. And it didn’t get better when the light went back to normal and the wings were gone.
“But it was all right, Sam.” Jack smiled at him with that odd little-kid, old-man smile. “In the end, I knew I had three fathers who love me. Castiel loves me completely, without question. He started to love me when he felt my fetus in Kelly’s stomach. You love me, and you see yourself in me. And Dean loves me because I brought Cass back and because I want to be good in spite of my father and all that has happened to me.”
Lack of fear requires trust. It is most unlikely—not impossible, but unlikely—that a young woman would so completely trust the pizza man.
Occasionally, some other angel began a new piece, and he followed along gratefully. Sometimes he just played random notes like the wind through an Aeolian harp. Sometimes, when no other angel was playing with him, he picked his way through a bit of Led Zeppelin or Bob Seger. Then he tried a bit of Mozart and a Celtic tune not heard on Earth for over a thousand years.
In the end, they handcuffed Sam to the plumbing and shoved a wardrobe in front of the door. Castiel managed to get control over his itchy back long enough to sit still in the car and walk like a semi-normal person into the St. James Medical Center. He was even able to tell that Dr. Corman’s soul was still in his corpse. He nodded and blinked out, though, when Dean went back to the Impala. Hopefully, he’d found an angel luffa or some lotion, or something.
Dean thought about for a minute. “Sammy and me, when we’re in the car listening to music, you know, I mean, I get it, I think.” He frowned. “But I thought the other angels didn’t like you.”
“I know I did. Look.” It took about everything he had, but Dean put his hand on Castiel’s shoulder, right over that trench coat where it seemed like he should have a matching handprint. “You’re my best friend. You know that, right?”
The angel shrugged, opened his luggage on the bed, retrieved and handed out Dean’s toiletries, then put the suitcase on the shelf in the closet.
“Cass,” he said instead, looking at the dark wall of the hotel while he registered that his alpha was behind him, Castiel’s chest to his back, his arms wrapped around Dean’s torso. “Tell me what to do.”
Castiel smiled and sat down across from Sam. The small stool was as uncomfortable as always, but his fingers had finally stilled.
Castiel laughed quite a while after that, even chuckling inside at the unbelievable feeling when Dean was rocking within his body, radiating out little bursts of hedonism he savored all the way to his toes.
Then Sam realized why he was flashing to all those moments: They were highly emotional, deeply affectionate, even passionate, but they hadn’t resulted in Dean and Cass declaring their love for each other and going to bed.
Harp in his pocket, he opened up and saw Dean standing there in his boxer briefs, t-shirt, and bathrobe. He looked puzzled.
“I once lied to and betrayed you and your brother. After what I did to Jimmy Novak and his family, it’s my greatest regret.”
If their lives so far hadn’t gotten Dean and Cass together, what the hell exactly was supposed to do the trick?
Cass found himself smiling. The truth was he simply didn’t understand the need to own possessions. Whatever he came up with would doubtlessly be incorrect. Apart from Jimmy’s clothes (or their often-replicated replacements), the only thing he himself owned was his angel blade.
At one point, Dean sauntered off to the men’s room, and Sam looked at him while picking at an egg white omelet.
Cass just scowled and pressed his hand harder to Dean until whatever was wrong with his friend had been healed to his satisfaction. Dean stood easily after that, frowning.
Apart from the deafening noise of so many talking in excitement, it smelled weird: old leather, blends of perfume and essential oils, moth balls, hair products, and just general funk.
“Angel fellowship is expressed through music. It’s, well, intimate. Considering the disparity of our feelings for each other, it wouldn’t have been appropriate.”
OK, so it was time to stop dicking around and get to the real issue (well, one of the real issues). Would Dean have sex with a man . . . ish person?
Castiel, however, suddenly looked up, eyes narrowed. With a nod at Dean, he disappeared with a faint sound of wings.
Of course, that led to seventeen more questions from Sam until his brother told him to change the subject. Oddly, Castiel didn’t mind answering Sam’s queries, but did hesitate when Dean suddenly said:
They found Dean surrounded by a bisque doll that kind of looked like Elizabeth I, a Barbie with a ball gown and tiara, and an original G.I. Joe, all of them wielding bazookas, With some spell work from Cass and a few well-placed swipes of Sam’s machete, they were soon a jumble of porcelain arms and plastic legs.
Dean closed his eyes, reveling as the moisture seeped into his dry eyes and spread relief—fleeting, but blessed relief.
At least now I had lost something I had not realized was horrible. Hope was gone—that particular hope, that is. I had offered everything I was, and Dean had declined. I knew he even felt bad about it. If all I had been offering were sex and affection, we would be enjoying each other just fine. But I could no more offer Dean so little than I could fly again. It was for the best that he knew the stakes for me. It was for the best I knew that I was not what Dean wanted.
,  and then he shook his head, took a breath, and continued, “You’re a guy, right? I mean, deep down at the base. You’re a guy, right?”
Feeling more furious at that than intimidated, if only just, Dean sneered, “Yeah. Thanks for that,” and then shoved the knife into the guy’s chest as hard as he could. The guy in turn looked at it, pulled it out, and dropped it to the floor.
The crowd screamed and applauded, and then Dean was looking at a microphone was too close to his face.
A thousand scenarios went through Sam’s brain like a slide show in hyperspace. Romantic dinners by candlelight, longs walks on the beach, window shopping in some quaint village, dancing in the rain, leaving love notes in lunch boxes, making out in the balcony of a movie theater, picking wildflowers, gazing at the sunset, kisses at the top of a Ferris wheel, Dean strumming the guitar and singing—
A moment later, they were all standing inside an abandoned cathedral, the size and old-style grandeur of which told Dean right away they were no longer in America.
“So, three days ago, Collin Woodrow was found in the same position after just having purchased a $35,000 Brinns Victorian doll at auction. Again, nothing was missing except the doll.”
“Ah!” Feeling stupid, he fished his harp out of his pocket and set it down. Dean gasped as it reached the proper size. Castiel set his feet on the pedals and positioned it before strumming a scale and watching Dean’s eyes light up.
“Well, you don’t actually have these wings and feathers in Heaven, and I’m thinking celestial wavelengths don’t actually touch each other, so what is it the angels do for each other? How do you guys ‘provide community’?”
I opened my eyes to look at him, but the expressions I had enjoyed just a moment ago were gone. His eyes looked flat, and his mouth was set in a grim line.
No, we were unprepared when human couples joined in what seemed almost an excess of love, only then to despise each other not long afterward. The ideas of familiarity’s leading to hate, of “getting tired of one another,” and the like are things we angels have had to take completely on the word of humans.
And then, hesitantly, me. Castiel, as I had been once, leader of the Earth Garrison just before I and my platoon breached Hell, my angel blade held aloft in flame and triumph, my energy bright with my confidence in God’s mission. And then again, me, now, standing in a small room inside a bunker, wings broken, powers fading, but my adoration for the man in front of me burning just as brightly as my angel blade had once not that long ago.
Dean looked at him, part curious and part furious. “So, what? I jerked you back off this time? I need details here, Cass!”
Castiel was confused. Was he supposed to ask Mandy for sex now or later or make some other arrangement? Did he have to have sex with her? If it were like being with April, it would be nice, but there was a lot going on in the following conversation he didn’t get.
Dean had sealed up his heart after Lisa and Ben, and though he’d made comments and flirted with basically anything since then, Sam knew his brother had decided he was done with finding a better half.
Cass sat quietly in his chair. It struck Dean that Donna didn’t have any plants in her cabin, which made sense.
“I do.” I got my eyes open then, filling with sudden pride at how wrecked he looked. “I do, very much. I just needed a moment.” I shrugged, feeling foolish now. “I’m sorry.”
Dean took the hose to the back window and trunk. They’d gotten most of the gunk and mud off. He went back in with the sponge.
“I went to you,” he said. “And we engaged in a number of sexual activities of an increasingly intimate nature until the coven agreed that our arrangement was finished. Then I and Sam were given permission to leave with you. We took you to the car, then returned and killed them all.”
“Sean,” she said next, turning to the only occupant in the room Dean didn’t recognize. The guy, doubtlessly her husband, managed to go to her for comfort while gaping openly at the angel.
“Angel blade alloy is a blend of celestial quartz and compressed ozone vibrating at 2,000 gigahertz.”
Perhaps that isn’t fair. All angels have known each other since the creation of angels, which stopped when God left.
“You need to enjoy me like I’m enjoying you.” Dean took advantage of the confused look Cass shot him to kiss up and over his chin, then brought his hand back up to keep him from looking away again. “It was your ‘reluctance to partake,’ right?”
What humans would call “string instruments” were the answer. Angels played the celestial equivalent of violins, cellos, violas, guitars, kotos, shamisen (strangely popular), zithers, dulcimers, and, as in Castiel’s case, harps. In short order (a few hundred years of practice), the chorus of vibrations matched the vibrations of the universe (what humans would eventually refer to in terms of “string theory”) to be in perfect harmony with the spheres.
“In short, and this is in spite of the many occult items on the ship, I could sense nothing out of the ordinary, which means either everything is all right and Rowena was wrong—”
And then, even worse, Dean turned twenty, then twenty-one, then year after year getting older and no alpha, big or small, did come to claim him. Somehow Dean was even less than an omega. Sometimes, his father looked at him like Dean was some dog he regretted adopting. And it didn’t matter how many monsters he killed, how many people he saved, how many beta women he charmed into bed. He was just this malformed, too-pretty-but-too-strong thing no one wanted.
“No, you showed me you, and I was over-frickin’-whelmed. It took me a couple days to get my head around it, OK?”
Castiel looked forward through the windshield, reminding Dean they had a mission, right before he said, “It’s nothing a human would want to do.”
Again, however, what should be a simple matter of A + B = C is complicated by the mental component. I am reasonably certain that Dean has had women stimulate his anal region and that he enjoyed it. The pleasure derived from my fantasy, however, is based on whether he would be able to enjoy stimulation from me.
Dean shrugged the shoulder he wasn’t lying on. “I wouldn’t think much about it, sometimes, what with Sammy and hunting things. I figured I’d know you when I found you.”
It was something Sam had thought about before. He’d even had a class at Stanford that had talked about it based on an old barbershop quartet favorite, “Wedding Bells Are Breaking up That Old Gang of Mine.”
Cass closed his eyes when he came, pumping what felt like a quart of hot fluid deep into Dean’s body, and behind him, against the ceiling Dean thought he saw an outline of outspread wings.
A long moment passed, during which Sam felt sleep tug at him once or twice. Before he went under, he did hear Castiel say: “I want you to happy too, but as I’ve told you before, that’s not really what our lives are about.”
magazine from December 10, 1945. The cover feature was on party dresses, but he found the article on appropriate birthday presents much more interesting. He had never actually tried to give Sam or Dean a present—not like Amara, who had given Dean the gift of his resurrected mother without preparing either of them for the experience. Was anyone really surprised she was having trouble adjusting?
“Yes,” Castiel said. “We’re hear to be a better Dean and Castiel than the other, uh, Deans and Castiels.”
More time passed then, and I found I even took comfort in walking. I wish I could say the stars were brilliant, but in fact the night was a little cloudy, and it was the wrong season to see the Milky Way. The air was cold, though it didn’t reach me and felt nothing like the coldness inside me. Perhaps it was simply a comfort that I could still walk, still function when part of me was amazed I hadn’t broken into silvers and shards of myself, like the way ice will shatter against stone.
“Cass,” he said next, and it was odd the way he said it. I’m not sure I’d ever heard him say my name that way, anybody’s name that way, before. I’ve taken many blows in battle that didn’t weaken me the way that one uttered syllable did.
“Leveau mercier du bois chaloitte. Secoise entienne mais pois de morte. Morteisma lieu de vocuier de mieu vochette. Endenlieu pour du boisette Damballa! Endenlieu pour du boisette Damballa! Endenlieu pour du boisette Damballa!”
“That,” he finally said. “That’s what you betrayed when you stood with me and Sam against the Apocalypse?”
“Yes. Uh.” She looked over at the door as it opened to admit a man in plaid and jeans. He didn’t have Dean’s or Sam’s build, though. “Hey, Jerry.”
About forty minutes later, Sam and Jack reached the stage, and while they got a decent response from the crow, it wasn’t nearly as impressive.
Dean was a hunter, and no matter how much society tried, there was just something about needing it up the ass that made omegas seem lesser, seem weaker. It didn’t help he could take 90 percent of his face and put it on a woman, and she'd be damn pretty.
How much do I owe Dean Winchester and his family and friends? How little have I done for them in recompense?
And then there were the women who’d been a part of their hunting lives: Jo, Ellen, Charlie, the real Pamela, Eileen—the carnage turned Sam’s stomach.
This was something I had not foreseen in a thousand fantasies. I had, I readily admit, always cast myself in the more passive role when imagining us together, but that was a choice based on Dean’s preferences. I could only see him taking on what would be the more—language is getting in the way again—traditionally assertive role. So I thought I would lie back and feel him on top of me, between my legs, inside my body because that’s what he would want.
“You had no choice, Cass. That’s my point!” Dean stood up, paced to the fireplace, pace back, rana hand through his hair, and sat back down. He took a breath, or two. “We were both violated. You think I don’t realize that?”
Not all humans are skilled at judging one’s character. Certainly, not all are as skilled as they think they are. But still, they are often willing to take that incredible leap of faith. They are ready to say, “I have no real reason to trust you, but I will.”
Even when the need started, it wasn’t bad at first. He felt more than a little sexy, and for the first time ever he wasn’t faking it. He felt desirable, warm and daring, and a little bit fearless. Lying there in bed, trying to convince himself he would find his alpha in time, Dean ran his fingertips over his cock and balls and backside and felt good.
The thought made him smile, and then he was about to pick a real melody to play when Dean knocked on his door.
“Dean,” was all he said, though, closing his eyes and pretending just for a second everything was OK.
Dean let his voice go soft the way it wanted. “Come on, man. You’re obviously in pain. You go in there, you’re done.” He waited a moment, but all Cass did was drop his gaze. “Let me help.”
“It’s, uh, it’s true,” Dean said, trying to avoid the glare of several pairs of incredulous eyes. “This is the guy who got me out of Hell.” He looked, and they were all still staring him except for Cass, who was looking at the others in turn, his head tilted in the bird-like way again.
But then, it wasn’t like the four of them had never had fun together, was it? Sam could think of a good four or five times they’d done something enjoyable together. Well, sort of.
“I want to please you,” the angel said, soft lips moving against his stomach. “You deserve so much more than I can give you.”
Slowly, he made his way over, looking more determined than grieving now, which was at least something.
“Would you stop screwing around with your clothes and come over here?” I demanded, surprising us both.
“Sure, whatever,” Dean said, nudging Cass away and then feeling eyes on his ass as they walked away into a gaggle of Jawas.
Outside the motel, traffic went west and east, the town’s few traffic lights stopped it all for a while, then turned green, as though nodding weary travelers on their way for all the battles before them.
Dean didn’t whimper. He made a noise, sure, but it wasn’t a whimper—more like maybe a clearing of his throat or something.
The Men of Letters seemed to hate to throw things away, yet managed a truly impressive level of organization. Beyond the library and the annex with its dungeon, there were fifteen other rooms with shelf after shelf of newspapers, microfiche, newsreels, magazines, pamphlets, and Chuck Himself knew what else. Castiel figured he might make it through every last article in the bunker in a hundred years, but thinking about that sort of thing just reminded him that Sam and Dean would be dead long before a hundred years, so he had never made any sort of real plan.
So while the others talked, I used that perfect memory to my personal, wholly selfish advantage to relive the feel and smell of him as I imagined now taking him in my mouth not for my taste buds—like everything else, Dean’s skin and semen would taste like molecules—but for the knowledge of the pleasure it would bring him.
“Cass!” Dean leaned forward over the table. “You are a male angel right now. Right? You’re Jimmy Novak-style, male angel!”
Cass was quiet, but obviously thinking, so Dean carefully went after other fuzzy-looking feathers. Each one dropped easily away before disappearing. Once he figured out what he was looking for, it was easy to see the others. And as he worked, getting rid of dozens of feathers, he could feel Cass not so much relax as unclench.
“For thousands of years, I was a good soldier. I won incredible battles, and I reaped incredible rewards. But none of that means as much to me as does my relationship with you three. Over and over, I have tried to explain to my angelic brothers and sisters how empty our lives are before we know love. And over and over I have failed. I wish I knew why.”
After everything settled and they were all breaking up to go their own ways again, Dean pulled him close.
Sam wilted somewhat, but the angel’s voice wasn’t unkind. In fact, Cass took Sam’s hand in both of his. “You and I need to talk later.”
“No, Dean.” Cass put his blade away and sat on the opposite end of the couch, the duffel bag between them. “No, it didn’t touch you.”
Sam was abruptly certain. If Dean told Cass he wanted more from their relationship, Cass would be on board. Maybe it wouldn’t be for all the right reasons, but then, Dean and he weren’t exactly poster boys for good emotional health either.
Cass nodded and got out his phone, then handed it over with a word. He turned and went into the kitchen to put up the food and make coffee. Dean sat on the couch next to his bag and watched them, dozens of them, while a mug of coffee threatened to go cold at his elbow before he downed it, and then a beer, and then another beer.
Cass nodded. “That is why leaving Heaven was complicated. Some objected who should not have objected.”
But I had been provided with Dean’s specifications to the letter by what I had thought at the time was God. Now, it’s more likely the specs came from Zachariah, but it doesn’t matter.
“I’m not buying what you’re selling; so, who are you really?” Dean stepped back a little, but it didn’t help.
“Evidently my reticence to engage as an equal in this prevented the level or type of pleasure the coven is seeking,” Cass in this memory said.
But I wasn’t thinking about the scale of the universe that morning when I walked into the kitchen. I was only thinking about Sam and Dean and Jack, and that was quite enough for an angel who lives in a bunker.
“Maybe a few minutes, then. I mean, you’re right. It’s important. But I just want to talk to you about something.”
“Well, I get the idea, but what we’ve done has been pretty, uh.” He discarded about a half-dozen words. “Clinical.”
It was only around thought six or seven than I remembered it was some useless t-shirt from a heavy metal band Dean favored I. It was only then, after that delirious near-disaster, that I knew I was just looking at nothing.
But while we know each other, we do not—I don’t quite know how to say it—we do not seek to look past the company file, I suppose.
And then Dean let himself look down further: straight, thick, long, pink, and lovely, with tender-looking balls and a soft dusting of hair.
“Nixe!” Madame Laveau crossed her arms and then swiped them down. The men had looked promising, but their acting was horrible and their chemistry was shit. The coven nodded, and the two men left the performance area to undress, return to their beds, and wake up in the morning with no memory of the night’s activities.
Sam and Jack were waiting in Santísimo when two men in jeans, Hawaiian shirts, leather flip-flops, and sunglasses walked inside.
“Stay with me, Dean.” He looked down into now mischievous eyes. “I want you to watch me suck your gorgeous body.”
Yeah, no thank you, assbutt. Asswipe. Asshat. Whatever it was. And who cared about things like that anyway?
Dean shut off the water. “No, it was sex. You think I can’t tell that? You think I can’t feel my own body?” He threw down the hose. “Now, tell me. What did those bitches do to me?”
Castiel glared at him, took a breath, and then swiveled on his ass, presenting the back of his trench coat and now what looked like hundreds of large, vaguely outlined, black-to-gray feathers.
I did that duty again many more times, through not on Earth. I don’t know why that made a difference.
Thank God for a straightforward question. “War got his mojo from this ring, and after we cut it off, he just tucked tail and ran. And everybody that was affected; it was like they woke up out of a dream. You think Famine's got a class ring, too?”
God, he’d felt like nothing sometimes, watching after Sammy, trying to be the best brother he could be, and then looking up at John Winchester’s disgust. After that, it didn’t matter how many targets Dean put holes through, how many vampires he beheaded. He was still just this omega son waiting for some big alpha to cart him off.
“And if it is absolutely no,” Sam told Dean, “then why are you waking me up in the middle of the night to talk about it?”
I thought about the day I came back from the Empty. I replayed in my mind both Dean’s and Sam’s unutterable joy in my presence. It was the last time we knew a moment that harmonious.
Dean is a highly sexualized human, but unlike most of them, I have observed from our social interactions that he is not just considerate of his partners, but sexually dependent upon them.
“That was incredible,” he said next, not looking at me. “You know, I forget, sometimes, just what you are.”
“I could make it so that you remembered.” Cass look at him intently. “Surely, you don’t want that, Dean. I can tell you the facts. There’s no need to take you back there.”
Dean came almost instantly, and though he wasn’t in heat he didn’t lose his erection or desperate need for more.
I thought of the various notes of hedonism his voice would make, the clench of his muscles, the outbreak of perspiration, the tremble of his bones. While I applied suction, I would run my hands up the backs of his thighs, over the swell of his ass, and then down again, registering every last sound and smell and—
The coven reached a fever pitch, then went silent. The massive ship shuddered ever so slightly. A mate in the control room noticed but went back to her usual midnight duties when it wasn’t repeated.
“Well, slowly but surely, everyone in this town is falling prey to Famine, but so far, you seem unaffected.
Sam nodded absently while dialing his phone, and Jack was still staring in puzzlement at Castiel, who was looking all around them.
Dizzy again, burning and hungry, Castiel focused on Dean’s taste and solid flesh, going past the awareness of molecules and cells, practically diving into the bright soul that welcomed him with a joyous hunger of its own.
Even as he gripped the salt-loaded shotgun tighter, one of the overhead lights exploded, and then another and another. The front doors of the barn cracked the beam holding them in place, swinging wide to reveal a man—dark haired, stone faced—who tread without care over the painted sigils and traps. His face was first hidden and then illuminated by showers of sparks from the lights, and when Dean and Bobby emptied shot rounds into his nondescript trench coat over a dark suit, the cheap-looking material was damaged while the man’s eyes barely blinked.
“So, the idea is Sam and I will enter the Sam and Dean contest, and then Castiel, you and Jack can enter the Other thing.”
Of course, it was and will ever be one-sided. Dean has done me the highest honor in thinking of me as a brother. It is only my own fault that it’s not the honor I would prefer.
The hunter thought about it, truly struggling to come up with something funny, something OK, something that would end this nightmare before he lost his mind. In a sort of daze, he reached over, grabbed Castiel’s left hand, and then brought it to his lips with a bow.
“Then, when the order came for me to rescue Dean, things began to become uncomfortable. Many avoid me, and though angels are not supposed to feel jealousy, I have noticed some of my fellow soldiers showing me open resentment.”
“Wow! That’s the best angel blade I’ve ever seen!” she enthused. “Be sure to show it when you’re on stage!”
“Gorgeous,” Castiel said with awe, kissing his way down Dean’s torso. “When I reassembled you, I was worried I wouldn’t match the original, but this is every freckle, every shade, every shape of you before those hell hounds got to you. The only new mark is my own handprint.” The angel sounded smug.
He thought about that, looking around the cabin like Donna’s antlers and old rifles were going to tell him what to do. There was nothing about this moment that he didn’t hate.
Castiel snorted softly. Trust Dean to jump right to the most important thing. Then he nodded and put the instrument back into his pocket.
Is it still a breach of their privacy to take everything they’ve said publically and put it together? Ask the NSA.
Sam was halfway through an article about what looked like a possessed doll—one of those creepy Victorian things with the eyes—when Dean came back with supplies, including a box of fried chicken and two six-packs of beer. What followed was a pretty ordinary dinner, a decision to keep an eye on the doll story, and Sam, suddenly exhausted from the day, taking a shower and hitting the sheets early.
“No. No way, Cass.” Dean turned inside his mate’s arms to kiss him, but the angel’s blue eyes were still sad as he pulled gently back.
Dean hadn’t been expecting the crowd, though he probably should have. Sam and Bobby (holding a shotgun like a security blanket) came out, followed by Ellen and Jo and a third woman in a sheriff’s uniform. Dean saw  Cass look at her oddly, almost in surprise.
Dean and Cass ended up on the sagging sofa, their sides pressed lightly together, Bobby sat behind his desk, and everyone else grabbed a chair from the kitchen.
He didn’t answer, and I was outside the bunker before I really started paying attention to anything again. It was dark, but I was still enough of an angel that it didn’t matter.
Those blue eyes loomed closer, and Castiel’s breath was warm and male and oddly human-like. For the first time in a very long time, Dean let himself think of being filled, and now it was with the thought of those eyes watching him as he—oh, God—as he spread his legs and let his alpha take pleasure from him. Would he pound him into the mattress? Thrust in gently, slowly, kissing him all the while? Jump him? Savor him?
And it had to be music without an obvious percussionist. The only one who could beat the drum to keep them all together was an archangel, and from the before the Fall, Michael, Lucifer, Gabriel, Raphael had shown as much interest in the musical aspect of angel radio as they did in the evolution of human Tupperware parties.
Hours passed. Then Dean’s hand fell away. Castiel finished the progression, ended the piece, and set the harp back on its base.
Would Dean even like a regular present? He remembered giving Claire that frowning cat doll from the Hot Topical, but he had no idea whether the present had been at all “successful.”
As a centuries-old ruin, the place was impressive, if very dry and a little hot. There wasn’t a ceiling over the main area, but Cass had beamed them into an alcove, so their heads are covered. In fact, Dean feels instinctually they need to stay in the alcove for Cass’ blood sigil to work. No wonder he didn’t want Ruby just wandering around.
The time came to pack, and Dean and Sam both had to work hard to explain to Castiel why he had to bring at least one bag for a seven-day cruise, including a bathing suit, flip flips, and no fewer than three Hawaiian shirts.
Dean’s perfect body doesn’t offer up the lines of such a thing. Instead, his core’s hardness is solid, almost a surprise under his skin. Someone could lay their head on his stomach and sleep in perfect comfort, I imagine.
In truth, I didn’t feel much of anything. All that walking had actually wearied me. I thought of lying on a bed, and the thought appealed.
“Sam.” Castiel’s voice was pretty much as angry as Sam had ever heard it. “Dean’s sexual orientation is not fluid. He can’t just decide to be attracted to a male body any more than I can get my wings back.”
The angel shook Sam off and turned to Dean squarely. “My advice is for you to resume your life and see if any memories surface on their own, which they shouldn’t. But the magic involved was, in a word, complex.”
On cue, Dean’s stomach growled. Frowning but ultimately trusting Cass, he took the cup and downed the contents in one go. After a moment, he did feel a lot better, only realizing how awful his headache had been when it left and how much his stomach was rolling over when it calmed down.
“That’s the point. Some ways of loving just aren’t the same as others. Dean isn’t attracted to Castiel.”
Cass shot him a look of plain resentment. “You’re not going to want to help me, Dean. Let’s just get on with this. We need to stop Famine. That means I take the knife. I go in. I cut off the ring hand of Famine, and I meet you back here in the parking lot.”
“Yes,” I said, almost impatient. “I want to look up and see you. I want to know you’re taking everything you can from me in this form.”
He got his eyes open. They felt a little crusty. And instead of crummy wallpaper, he saw the walls of his room. In fact, he was tucked into his bed like a neatly folded shirt in a drawer, wearing his boxers, undershirt, and socks.
“An omega who truly feels incompatible can shut down, basically turning themselves into betas. My greatest fear was that when I was finally allowed to go to you, you would have imposed that on yourself. Then my scent would have meant nothing to you. You would have rejected me.”
Now I know what I did not then, that dead angels go to the Empty. Do they somehow manage to sleep as one even there? I would believe it. The things I have seen.
With a nod from us both, he reached down, grasping us both up so that we could thrust into his warmth. We’d both dribbled enough precome to create a slippery pocket, and my ideas about his being inside me fled as the incredible pleasure of sharing this with him slammed down.
“There is no need for this,” he said quietly, his voice a low purr. “I know that you are not sexually interested in men. Nothing else needs to be said on the matter.”
To his astonishment, God’s warrior actually bowed his head, looking exhausted. “You have no idea. None. How much I want it.”
Mandy came back and doled out coffee. Castiel took a sniff, and she smelled as familiar as the diner. She was hot, but then it occurred to him that if he had sex with her Dean would probably praise him, and he lost all interest.
He was less pleased with the, “Oh my God! Kiss! Kiss!” screams, but he was less puzzled than Castiel, who looked at the “shippers” with open dismay. This only set the screamers off, and the chanting of “Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!” actually got organized.
“The last time we talked about feelings, the world was about to end and you told me I was a brother to you and Sam.”
“It’s not a question of affection, Dean. It’s just a way to . . .” He sighed again. “It’s very difficult to put into human terms.”
The words came off his tongue only with effort. What was he now that he was agreeing with the King of Hell? “Crowley’s right,” he said. “You should go.”
“I know how stupid that sounds, OK? You gave me a music box and said something important, and I can’t remember, damn it!”
Still, I have to credit Milton for even realizing that angels would seek to join, as they did in droves for the first few thousands of our years. But being limited in number as we are, those who did not find a mate after that initial frenzy stopped looking. The rest of us, in human terms, delegated each other to the “friend zone.”
“Dean, I need to offer my apologies if you haven’t figured it out, but I have been nothing but respectful of what you humans call your ‘boundaries.’” He realized his fingers had made those little quote marks and put his hands down, only to watch them rise back up again. “Your ‘personal space.’”
I made sure my face was neutral as I came around the corner of the library table to take a seat. “Perhaps the world is allowing you and Sam a day off.”
“Yeah, a bit.” Dean finally spotted his brother’s head and shoulders in a crowd of much shorter Sams and several of what he realized were Charlies, and a couple of those were Dark Charlies. Jack was standing nearby, looking as small and bemused as usual.
“Dean!” Cass said, actually sounding annoyed. “When you have to tend to someplace indelicate, do you really want to discuss it with others?”
After a few couples made it to the stage, Dean started to pay attention to the level of applause, so when he and Cass finally made it to the platform, he appreciated the loud screams and chants of “You’re so hot!” that followed.
Dean scowled right back. “You know what I mean, so stop pretending you don’t. You could get away with that kind of thing for the first couple years, but you’ve been among us hairless apes long enough. I’m not buying it anymore.”
Jack looked around the library with a frown. Dean was in the kitchen making the perfect burger, and Castiel was watching him.
It had started pumping with that announcement of intent twelve hours before any other symptoms showed up.
And then the angel was gone. Dean looked around for a moment, ready to leap out of the car and run into the restaurant.
Blue eyes (but everyone could see they were colored contacts) filled with surprise. “There have been other letters?”
“Ooh, we don’t have any in town,” she said, eying his trench coat as though he might have car a in his pocket. “You’ll have to go up to Boulder.”
It wasn’t until I saw Dean and his soul—so bright, so much a comment on the rest of him—that it even occurred to me that seeing the layers of humans mattered.
Wally worried him greatly by admitting that demon hunting was all new to him. “You got a rougarou problem?” he asked. “Hey, I’m your guy. But demons? Hell. Look, I was just passing through and I heard about some cattle mutilations.”
"Well, damn it, you look like a man who needs something so bad it's going to kill him. Bones said if you were any other man he'd prescribe shore leave on an accommodating planet."
Castiel gave him the slightest smile, then thunder boomed, the light got weird, and the shadow of two great wings rose up on the wall behind him.
So I went into Jimmy Novak’s body, and even while I was walking across that sigil-scribbled barn floor toward two hostile and terrified humans, part of me was still foolish enough to think, somehow, he would recognize me inside the “holy tax accountant.”
But then he was walking into the main room of the house. The stench of the place was horrific. He saw dead cats and putrefying reptiles and a large cauldron in the center of the room surrounded by three witches draped in red and purple robes.
And yeah, even better from Sam’s point of view, Dean had been a brother supporting Sam when he jumped into the Cage with Lucifer inside him. Dean had insisted on returning Sam’s soul, which turned out to be the right call. Dean had backed him during the trials to close the gates of Hell, and then done everything to keep Sam alive instead. Dean had even, incredibly, shrugged his shoulders and taken his brother’s lead when it was Sam’s time to be in charge.
Cass nodded. “For some time now, I have been aware that some of my bothers and sisters have been furtive. I sense hidden agendas, and I believe, as difficult as it has been for me to accept, that not all angels are working together as we used to.
When the angel had gotten back into the “chamber” and onto the bed, Castiel looked so wrecked and Dean felt so tired, that he’d just rolled over and gone to sleep, not caring he was naked with bits of paint or blood or whatever the crap was all over his body. He knew it was hours later when he woke up to see Castiel holding a steaming teacup.
“You have no idea how deeply, how overwhelmingly I want to fuck you, Dean. God made you for me, and me for you. It seems almost insulting that I’m not inside you right now.”
“I would wait forever for you, Dean Winchester,” he said, and a thick finger breached him, unnaturally warm, as though filling his whole body with light. “But instead I get to do this.”
Spock spoke with a perfectly strangled voice. It was obvious their little cplayers had true feelings for each other, if disappointing that “Kirk” was a female.
Castiel suddenly veered over to Jack, which was going to do nothing for their cover. Dean decided to sidle up to a Charlie (the red wig was almost pink, but it was long and fun) and give her a brotherly grin.
Dean scowled at his little brother. First Cass had been acting all twitchy at the restaurant, and now Sam looked shaken up.
“Exactly how is it that you know things like that now?” he asked. “I mean, one day, you get pop culture references. I mean, me and Sam assumed it’s some angel thing, but did you do? Go plug into the collective?”
Not long ago, even after Dean lashed out at me in anger, I was able to stand with him and Sam as they addressed “the troops.” That was a moment of pride without any chance of sin. That was a hint, a taste—so much more than I have ever had—of what it means to join. To belong.
God, Cass had done so much for them. They would not have been able to stop the Apocalypse without him, and that was just Page One.
Maybe it was just too much trouble for Michael to make up some Mrs. Dean. She’d have to be quite something to have been believable. Maybe the archangel just hadn’t wanted to bother.
Dean and Sam Winchester, Bobby Singer, Jo and Ellen, Ash and his notoriety in Heaven, and everything else since I took James as a vessel has brought me to a place in my existence that I could never have suspected.
Sam wasn’t a parent or a son to Dean. He was a brother and partner. Whoever made a permanent place in Dean’s life had to deal with that. Dean needed a romantic partner who added to rather than subtracted from his relationship with his brother.
McKay nodded slightly, then again more firmly, and then “closed his laptop” and “grabbed a tablet.” “After you.”
Sam’s instincts didn’t like the sound of that. Chewing on his pen, Sam’s reasoning liked it even less. Castiel wasn’t human. Even without his grace, it was more a question of being “mortal” than being human. A human could suck up an angel’s grace all they liked. At best, it would kill them quickly. Castiel was also incredibly old, and clever, and skilled.
