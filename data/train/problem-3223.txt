“Kind of,” Dean mumbles, drumming his fingers on his desk anxiously. If Rowena is as in-demand as she seems to be that Castiel wanted her instantly, then every second he spends on the phone with Crowley is another second someone else could be picking her up, and another second closer to Dean possibly getting fired on his first day from a fashion house titan.
Dean asks, “Not that I’m complaining, but why didn’t you just tell me that I was the 8 o’clock dinner?”
Dean looks him up and down — Cas pulls off Max Mara well, actually. He must have ordered bigger sizes and had them tailored to better suit his body since their cuts are for women. Unless Cas has way more curves under his expensive clothes than he lets on... Dean licks his lips and brings his eyes back up to Cas’s, simply saying, “Max Mara.”
Castiel has grown tired of fighting who he is, who he should get to be with no shame, so he’s standing down from the fight and giving in to the tide. Only then could he ebb and Dean can flow and he has never felt this strong to talk about it. His shame kills what’s best in his life but he is proud. Today, Castiel is prouder than he has ever been. He feels almost powerful and invincible, and the words tumble out of his lips.
Dean broke up with Pax last week and the day after, Pax gave Thaddeus from admin his one-week notice, which means today is officially the first day Pax will be gone from NOVAK. He quit for a higher-paying job modelling for The Business of Fashion magazine and he assured Dean that their break-up is not the reason and that he would have quit anyway. He does tell Dean that he’s not oblivious to the way he acts and he hopes Cas was worth it.
"Well, well, well... You were right," Kansas says, making his way towards Ed while Castiel lingered behind. "Cough it up, Ed."
"Why are you so secretive?" Castiel finally asks. "What, have you done something in your past you're not proud of? It can't be that bad if Gabriel likes you."
He'd learned some things; he learned that when Dean raises an eyebrow and the corner of his mouth rises in a half-smile, he wants Castiel to laugh at his joke. He knows that when Dean hasn't done his hair in the morning that he's in desperate need for coffee. He knows that if Dean has his hands in his pockets that he doesn't want to talk and he'll appreciate silence over comfort. He knows when Dean wants to be left alone or when he wants a friend. These are the things Castiel has learned.
"I really liked you," Cas says as a way of explanation and Dean kisses him until they stumble back onto Cas's bed, laughing against each other. He can't be any happier than right now. Everything was right.
Ketch tells Mick to leave the area so he can talk to Adam alone. Despite being friends for years, sometimes Ketch thinks Mick doesn't really like him that much. It's not like Ketch cares what he thinks anyway.
An hour after it happened, Dean went back to the NOVAK building. It’s Sunday so barely anyone was around and he didn’t want to be near anybody, just wanted to be alone and think about the day. Therefore, it is an hour after it happened that Dean finally processes that he had fucked up.
"Yup," Dean grins, waving the wallet at him. "I'm not into bags, though. Maybe I'll give it to Eileen. Or Sam." Castiel offers a short laugh, and Dean asks, "Did you get a bag and wallet too?"
It's a pleasant Tuesday afternoon. Everyone is in good spirits, the heist now only two months away and excitement eating at their nerves. Windom and Rome keep to themselves sitting together, a distance away from the rest of them, talking about God-knows-what. Kansas and Angeles are their usual weirdly attached selves, Paris is almost like a wild older sister to Salem, Dallas and Berlin discussing their jobs at the bank. Meg leans in closer to her and asks, "After the heist, you wanna pool our money and go do some crazy shit?"
“Gabe, man, just sit tight, okay?” Dean says quietly. “We’re trying to lay low. Go in, do our job, get out.”
Sam takes out his phone and does a quick search online, grimacing when he sees the statistics. "Thirty-two bills per sheet, ten thousand sheets per hour. That'll be three hundred and twenty thousand bills per hour. If they go for the generic safe fifty dollar notes... They're printing sixteen million dollars per hour."
"We're getting out," Dean says, taking Cas's hand in his and pressing a kiss to his knuckles. Cas smiles, fleeting but priceless. "We'll split the loot, and then... Palermo doesn't sound so far away, does it?"
Dean nods, writing it down next to the sketch and then raising two more squares. “These are organza and tulle. So I’m thinking that some tulle would look good on your dress. I checked with Kevin and he said you could go and visit Vera Wang with him to check out the material better...”
the other day, just to get a feel of what my life is gonna be like. Doesn’t look pretty, gotta admit.”
"Finally, something going right!" Berlin cheers. It doesn't take long for Berlin to call the others, and when Kansas arrives with Angeles, it becomes a full-blown celebration. At some point, while Kansas digs his hands into the dirt to throw it in joy, the radio Benny had for company as he dug starts playing
"His college dorm-mate. They'll probably get an apartment together when they graduate," Cas answers.
, you know. Go, fix yourself. Bobby took us in great." Hard sarcasm has edged its way into Sam's voice, making them sharp like knives.
Dean shakes his head. “Jesus. God-crazy killer and a drug dealer? What the hell kind of family does Michael have?”
Bewildered, Adam says, "Of course I’m going to worry about you! This might not have occurred to you but I never stopped loving you, Michael. We’re in this together."
Dean snaps, “You’re not the only one destroyed by Mom’s death!” He draws in a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself but it is only Sam’s gentle hand on his arm that steadies his fluctuating irritation. “Dad, I am glad to see you, okay? Don't get me wrong, I am. I'm glad you're alive. But you have got to fucking understand that when you left that house, you didn’t leave Mom. You left
“Like you have no idea,” Anael mutters. “We all know he doesn’t know what to do, not until Crowley gets out of the SHU tomorrow. Honestly, I think he’s scared that he’ll get caught. He didn’t have a lot of time to prepare for this mission. The first time, he had 10 years. Second, almost two if we include Bela and Crowley’s prior planning. Now, he didn’t even have a
Anna smiles slightly, nodding. “That’s good. I didn’t talk to him much but he seemed like a good guy.”
Kansas is truly a force to be reckoned with, for sure. Constantly achieving the impossible. He'd robbed America and London blind and they let him get away with it.
Crowley huffs in annoyance and continues talking, "Back to the UK. I'll be laying low for a bit but I don't think I can bring myself to stop being a criminal. What about you, kleptomaniac?"
“This person didn’t give me these names out of good will,” Naomi begins, sitting down again across from Crowley. “It’s part of an immunity deal. They’ll be let off the hook as long as they give me information about the heists. But here’s the catch, MacLeod. I’m giving you the chance to steal this immunity deal from them.”
Kansas just keeps fucking winning. Sam can't counter him fast enough and it's beginning to get more than frustrating. He needs a win, whether that be in regards to the public or against Kansas.
Adam stares, frozen in his spot. “Did you just kill Lilith?” Dean doesn’t answer and his eyes start darting around the room, looking for a solution where he doesn’t get caught for this. Adam grabs his arm and whispers, horrified, “Dean, what were you thinking?”
"How do you plan to let them let us go? The moment we get out, there's going to be an APB out on us," Crowley points out, rubbing his hands together in concern. "We won't even cross the border before we get caught."
Sam stretches, putting the papers down on Cas's desk as he says, "He's not wrong from that social standpoint. And —"
“I’d say welcome, but then I’d be pretending,” Roman says, though he gestures to the seat across from him before waving Benjamin off. “Close the door on your way out.” Benjamin leaves them alone to talk and Dean sits — Roman may not be so welcoming but the chair certainly is.
It's clear as day in Dean's memory. Three years ago when they were studying for the first heist, Crowley told him about one of the numerous untraceable ways to kill someone.
“Then what about negotiation with the police?” Jo asks, furrowing her eyebrows. “We won’t have the analogue phone so we can’t use that, right?”
"Yeah, Berlin's good. He's sharp, smart, adaptable, calm under pressure... But you're all those things too," Dean points out. "Why not you?"
?" Mary asks as Dean snuggles up against her. Baby Sammy's in his room, where the space-themed mobile John worked on for a week is finished and probably spinning above his crib.
Bela laughs, "With the way that man looks at you? I'm not surprised, Cas." Just like that, they go right back to normal.
"Dean, what the fuck is going on?" Sam exhales, sitting in the chair that Adam drags over. "I thought you died."
With Cas’s support, Dean finds the will to call Adam to meet him for lunch at a café midway between where the NOVAK building is situated and Lenox Hill Hospital. Adam readily agrees and even says he’ll come without Michael. Adam is understanding, as Dean comes to realize. The moment he locates Dean in the café and sits down across from him, he says, “If you want to get it all out, do it. I won’t stop you.” It’s said with no hint of bitterness, and Dean jumps at the chance.
Michael betrayed Chuck of his own free will in 15x08. As I said before, Dean and Michael are parallels, which means
Castiel buys coffee for Dean in the morning. It’s a small gesture and he knows it’s not enough so he pairs it with getting him and Pax a reservation at a nice restaurant that serves the best French food in New York City that evening at 8 and does all his work the previous night from home so Dean can take the day off if he wants. It’s still not enough, he knows it isn’t, it can’t be enough for how much of a dick he’s been.
Jo tears up as she puts the jacket over her shoulders and Dean knows that this was the right choice.
“Tell her to call me at 8,” Castiel says, dumping his Armani coat on his chair. “Dinner with Tessa will run on, she doesn’t eat quickly and I like talking to her.”
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful for the loot you got us but face it, Dean. As long as you’re still walking around out there, this nightmare will never end. Crowley would have been dead in a week. Naomi threatened Anael and her girlfriend. Lilith almost got Adam yesterday,” Meg points out, desperate for Dean to see her point. “Abaddon hunted us down one by one and we lost Balthazar, Bela and Benny. Bevell shot you. We almost lost Michael twice. You were lost for a few minutes too, don’t forget. This time, you walk right into prison with cuffs around your hands and expected to get away?”
Half an hour into it, Sam insists they do serious covers because he really wants to know if Cas can actually sing or not, and it leads to the discovery that Cas is a choir boy at church.
He'd been getting used to a life like this — since the Diamonds Factory, they still met up once a year to check up on one another, but nobody had any crazy schemes to propose anymore. Meg didn't find any more half-assed plans and Dean had nothing lying around. They'd even hosted Adam and Michael's wedding two years ago in a field in Italy; only the Dalís and Adam's mom were there. It was small, but they spent the whole day together, and Dean wished them a peaceful life together.
He opens the room doors one by one -- Dean and Cas’s rooms are empty, so he moves on to another hallway. He pulls out his phone and calls Dean, hoping it will speed things up.
"Come on, we can just go back. I don't have to talk to him," Dean says, unconsciously catching onto Castiel's sleeve. Sam glances between them and John, unsure of what to do. Most of his memories with John have been lost to time due to how young he was, most of his fatherly memories made with Bobby and Dean, so all he knew was that he would go along with whatever Dean wanted to do.
Dean pushes all thoughts of Cas out of his head and gets his new Louboutin shoes and his coffee, just a few minutes before Cas usually comes in.
“Fucking jackasses,” one of the girls say. Balthazar recalls her name to be Krissy Chambers. Her friend, Josephine Barnes, rubs her shoulders in comfort. ”How’s Jack any better than us?”
The bank doors begin to open and some Dalís come out, firing with poor aim yet again and the first motorcycle goes up the stairs right into the bank, followed by the second one. Sam retreats into the tent and demands, "Can someone hurry up and stop the third one?"
Ketch's eyes widen but he can't contest that he liked the idea. Still, he asks, "What about the hostages?"
Castiel has his last therapy session with Kelly before leaving for France — to which Kelly insisted that he can video call her anytime then and she has his gratitude. He settles in the chair in Kelly’s office, exhaling as he starts, “I told Dean’s brother Sam.”
, I was so damn scared. I shouted for help, I tried to get you to wake up and you just wouldn’t move.”
"Well, there's a Batman villain called Bane so if you ask me, I think I nailed that one," Dean says, giving Cas a shit-eating grin, and Cas can't help but smile when he rolls his eyes.
“Michael and I are COs, Cas is the chaplain, Adam’s a nurse. Dean and Gabriel are in cell 275,” Anael answers.
“Yeah, yeah,” Castiel mutters, putting the cigarette between his lips. “Light.” Dean takes out his lighter, holding his hand up near the side of Castiel’s face to block wind as he lights up the edge of the cigarette. When it’s lit, Castiel backs off away to the window again, looking out at the dark sky. “Alright, is the jet for Paris tomorrow morning confirmed?”
clarence texted me earlier to say we should take dean out to do something fun and take his mind off of it
After the short session with the hostages, Crowley moves them up to the office where Abaddon is being watched by Meg and Castiel. Meg's mask is pushed up into her hair and Castiel's covers his face. Abaddon has been cleaned up by now by Dean's orders. She looks significantly less bloody, the only evidence of Meg's beating being the beginnings of a bruise on her cheek and an eye that's gone red where it should be white. Dorothy and Anael stay outside the office and Sam and Dean follow Crowley in.
let you get caught," Cas insists. "I'm just someone making some diamonds. I barely did much in the first heist. You planned every single thing we did for the heist and in retaliation. Whatever happens to me will be much better compared to you. If someone has to go, I will."
“I grew up in Pontiac, Illinois, in a small orphanage. There was this short time when I got shipped off to Aurora, Colorado to go with a foster family, but I was such a hellish child that they sent me back,” Castiel says laboriously, knowing what fact of himself he was building up to. “When Gabriel got old enough to get out of the orphanage, he took guardianship of me and we went off to Manhattan in New York. Just a cheap studio in Hell’s Kitchen on the worst street in the city.” He links his fingers together. “When we had enough money, we moved to New York City.”
Growing up, Dean was never regarded as the smart Winchester with Sam around. Sam scored straight As in school, and Dean buried his report cards in Bobby's salvage yard. His attention span simply refused to last whenever a teacher opens their mouth, and he winged all his tests (which got him grades ranging from Ds to Fs).
“Stop it,” Cas laughs, trying to snatch the phone from Dean’s hand. Eventually, Dean can’t hold up both their weights, only being supported by an elbow, and Cas tumbles right onto Dean, face inches away from his.
Jess comes down the staircase right as John passes out and she walks over, cradling Sam's face in her hands. "You should get some sleep."
"Of course," Cas says, taking the phone and pressing it to Michael's ear. At his questioning look, Cas explains, "Adam wants to talk to you."
“I have five Golden Globes outfits to complete in the next month. I need to prepare my collections for Fashion Week and I have three Academy Awards outfits to do during said Fashion Week, and they can’t even be ready for
He’s next to Castiel in the plane's business suite and they’ve been in the air for five minutes now, and he’s just humming Metallica under his breath.
Gabriel drives ahead to catch up with Sam and Dean before slowing down, rolling the window down. “Hey boys. Need a lift?” Dean squints and bends down to see the driver and his eyes widen when he sees Cas in the backseat, looking embarrassed. Sam stares at Gabriel and glances back at Cas.
Angeles smiles -- it's a rare sight so Dean had unintentionally made a habit out of just indulging in it every time he gets to see it. He teases, reaching over to stroke his cheek with a finger, "Aw, Los Angeles is smiling."
Then Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory came up with a way that’ll take just a short while. Castiel is hoping it’ll be half an hour per diamond. It’s experimental still, and when he tried it in Madrid to find out it works...
Once Cas disappears down the hallway, Rowena pops up at the door, giving Dean a look of interest. "I can feel it in my bones, boy. What's wrong with you two?"
” Ketch snatches a pen and pad from one of the officers near him and clicks the pen, obnoxiously loud, and Kansas starts listing medicine, Ketch scribbling it down in block letter handwriting.
“Why didn’t you ever come back?” Sam asks while Dean fills his mind with Cas’s smile to calm down. “Did you forget about us? Did you not want to come back? What?”
, then yes," Naomi says firmly. "Their leader is down, that much we know. To organise an attack, we'll probably be able to be ready by 3 this afternoon."
“Their loss,” Cas agrees, huffing a soft laugh. “I worked in commissary when I was in prison. It wasn’t bad, I secretly ate snacks or snuck stuff back to my cell with me so I didn’t have to spend my own commissary money.”
"Looks bad?" Crowley says, staring at the blank screen. "They're calling me a bloody human trafficker!"
"Okay," Cas says. His laugh is a small huffing thing, and it is endearing no matter how many times Dean hears it.
"Bro, holy shit," Gabriel gapes, looking over at Cas. He moves to him and pulls his little brother into a tight hug, Castiel's cheek pressed against Gabriel's chest. "How do you feel?"
"First of all, Angeles picked up the phone. Dean was shot yesterday but he's stable right now," Mick begins. "However, this also means that it was a different Dalí that got shot at the window."
Zachariah starts protesting, "We need to get Jack Kline out, he is the top priority. Higher than even the governor. If they're giving him up, we need to take that chance. They already know he's important." Victor is silent but nods along with Zachariah, leaving Sam in disbelief.
Sure, has Anael lost most of her liking for Dean? Yes. But she did still like everyone else that’s there and she didn’t feel like leaving them behind again.
Dean nods, at his last nerves, and says sarcastically, “So now we have a trigger-happy God squad CO.
Anna notices them and reassures, “Don’t worry. Religion isn’t too big a thing here. If they aren’t interested, they’ll probably just leave you alone.”
“Fashion does blow an intimidating hole in your wallet, doesn’t it?” Mick smiles. “I’m wondering something. If you’re Novak’s P.A, then why are you here and he isn’t?”
Berlin and Vegas come to the office as soon as Dean sends Angeles to get them and he'd moved the hostages there to an adjoining room. The moment they walk in, Dean asks, "Did any of the hostages use a phone?"
Today, I found out that he has rheumatic heart disease. I’ve never heard of it, but he told me that it’s basically been destroying his heart since. Apparently he got this fever as a kid and his dad didn’t realise how bad it was until he collapsed during a sports event at school.
Dean thinks the day is going perfectly until he hears someone call out to him when the three of them leave the restaurant. "Dean, Sam."
The door opens and in comes Kansas. Crowley looks about ready to greet him with a quip until they both realise that it's not the time. Crowley asks instead, "What's wrong?"
Through the cracks at the bottom of the slide-up doors, they can see shifting shadows and light as the truck moves down the road before, inevitably, it slows to a stop. Jo rolls down the window, flashing the officer that stopped them a winning smile. “Can I help you, officer?” Of course, with their luck, the officer in question is actually Arthur Ketch.
Lucifer STABS her with an angel blade and she collapses, bright light emanating from her eyes and mouth.
He presses his lips together and trails her back to the main area of the suite where all the outfits are. "Look, as long as he doesn't know you know, I think it's alright."
“I see,” Cas says, shutting the door behind him. Behind his back, his fingers find the lock and he speaks over the sound of it clicking, “You’re Dr. Turner? I saw your name on the list of employees.”
Dean had pointed out that there was a church near their hotel, but he didn't get the chance to visit it until their last week in Paris. The Sacré-Cœur; with white domes of travertine stone on the top, it looked more like a castle if it weren't for the small crucifixes on the tips of those domes. There were bronze statues of Joan of Arc and King Saint Louis IX erected on each side of the church. Dean rarely visited churches — he liked keeping a fair distance from religion — but he wanted to go with him out of interest to see the large church.
When Cas and Gabriel come back into the NOVAK building upon their return, late at night after most people have left, Dean hugs him hello before stepping back, remembering that Cas is his boss and that may have been a little inappropriate in his office. Albeit the fact that most of the other coworkers have gone home already. Dean only stayed behind to sort out documents submitted by other departments.
Sam nods and helps him open up another box labelled ‘OTHER’. “What are you gonna wear for your first day next week?”
" The tech experts signal to say they can't clear the voice modulation and Sam shakes his head in disappointment. The man continues, "
, steps out of the departure hall with a redhead woman and Asian guy walking by his side. He walks with the kind of confidence Dean usually only sees on the runway and the two, presumably his employees, following anxiously as the paparazzi click away.
Twenty minutes later and Meg is handcuffed and shoved out of the bank, the door slamming shut behind her.
“I don’t know. I think John owed him something,” Dean answers, shrugging. “I tried keeping my distance from him so... Can’t help you too much there.”
"That's not even the worst part, I just got so angry that I —" Dean cuts himself off, realising that his hands are trembling. "Well, I ruined everything." He looks out the window at a teen lesbian couple, walking in the parking lot with sunny grins and arms around each other's shoulders. They look so
"Sam has to be the one to give me up," Dean says. "I have a plan to save Adam. It may not work but it's a shot."
Adam looks guilty but he does offer Dean, “I don’t know, but if it makes it better in any way, if I had a choice, I’d want him to go back to you two.”
“Well, then I’ll beat this John Winchester with my heels,” Bela remedies, already turning to retrieve her Badgley Mischka's. “Where is he now?”
The angel nods. With the mention of the archangel and an Empty without regrets, they seem more inspired.
Cas says, low, "If you hurt my people again, if you even look at Kansas the wrong way, I promise you that I will kill you. And I will keep shooting after you’re dead. Do you know what the best part is? You can have a hundred bullets in your body and they will never know who did it."
He takes a step back. "I'm sorry, I didn't get you coffee. I thought you'd have gone home with your fever, I was going to bring soup over once I got home."
Naomi sticks her head out of the partitions and orders one of the other officers, "Get the snipers ready on the opposite block." She nods and gets moving and Mick internally starts to freak out. They're going to shoot Dean when they bring Adam out as bait.
well you’re right cas is so smart like sherlock smart and his humour is so deadpan but he’s funny plus he’s hot as hell
“You have to know that kidnapping a member of the royal family will bring serious repercussions,” Ketch says. “Just turn yourselves in. Do you really think you will get away with this?”
“Okay, why do you think that?” Dean asks, looking up from a spot on the floor to Sam. “He’s great! Yeah, he’s sarcastic, his humour’s a little deadpan, but he’s also nice and —“
“Just try not to have any more brushes with death for the rest of your life and we’ll be cool,” Gabriel manages a half-hearted joke and Michael huffs a laugh.
"I don't know. Hopefully, get married," Jess jokes, laughing as she shakes her head as if to say it's just a dream.
“Oh, okay,” Dean stutters, making space in the elevator for Castiel to come in. He presses the fifth level button and Dean blurts out, “I’m sorry I ran late, sir. I was having lunch.”
I know we haven't been dating for a long time, and we've only known each other for about 4 months, but damn if I don't want to trust him because I do. I know I do.
"If I didn't know any better, I'd say someone's trying to sell you out," Bela says and Castiel exhales, thinking about what to do. He could leave right now or he could try to get some answers out of her. As if the break up wasn't enough, now he may have a possible company battle. Bela leans forward to look at him before she shoos the makeup artists away to talk privately. "What do you plan to do?"
Castiel stares at him, a frown slowly cutting through his features, but he considers it and replies, “I suppose there’s no harm in it.”
, would you like that?" the broker responds, turning in his chair to shoot a dirty look at him. He only grins back, winking.
Before Anael has any more time to think about it further, Anna interrupts her train of thought. “Hey, did you hear anything about CO Milligan?”
"Finally, some sun," Salem grins. She and Castiel were at the doorway of the roof -- out of sight of the snipers but certainly not out of sight of the sun. The sunlight is warm on his face and Castiel is grateful for this small window of opportunity to get some fresh air. While the windows do let light in, it can never compare to feeling it on your skin.
Michael pauses, pressing his lips together as he sighs. “I knew this couldn’t just be a social call… What is it now? Because I already promised Adam that I wouldn’t do anything reckless—”
The prison is just as busy as when Crowley left two weeks ago. From the corner of his eye, he could see Alastair slipping a bag of heroin to that kid that was in for grand theft auto. Crowley, while he did dabble a bit in narcotics outside of prison, would never deal within one. It’s too dangerous — everyone in here is too desperate to get their hands on even a pinprick of white powder. There’s always the possibility that they have no idea how much their body can take at one go.
Dean shows up at Cas’s door in a plain black button-down shirt and dark blue jeans, with his hair done up by Sam just before he left the house. He’d originally thought that a leather jacket that he saves for special occasions, I.E. dates, over his best flannel shirt would have been alright, and his normal hairstyle, until Sam insisted that Cas deserves better than flannel. This results in Sam going through Dean’s closet to find something moderately classy -- the black button-up -- and five rushed minutes of styling Dean’s hair in the mirror to look good.
“Good night, Dean,” Cas says, flagging down a cab. Cas apparently lives at the higher end of New York City, a condo on at 69th Street if Dean recalls correctly. Dean’s never visited because he’s never been invited. He’s not sure if anyone other than Gabriel has been to his place. Maybe Meg and Balthazar, but even that’s questionable.
Once they get across the tunnel to the truck, they see that everything's been loaded and that the Dalís there are already changing into civilian wear. Michael had arrived just before they did, still holding Adam in a tight embrace. Dean makes sure they've left no person behind before he starts to get going.
"Salem!" Dean calls out, running over. He bends down to shield her and Berlin fires at the cops to cover them. Dean raises his rifle and starts shooting, blindsided by Salem getting shot and how they unpredictably opened fire on them. Maybe he should have listened to Angeles when he was concerned about the cops being more violent with them but he was sure they were still unaware that Jack Kline was in the building.
He loves Halloween, so I wanted to bring it to him since he’s gonna be stuck in this room until after the operation. Dad’s probably gonna kill me for going home so late but it’s worth it to see Cas smile like that. Sam took a picture (I didn’t have time to draw him). I just wanted to spend time with him, look at him.
Six months and three days after, someone knocks on his front door. Cas doesn't think anything of it, shouting to the person as he turns down the heat on his stove, "Give me a second, I'll be right there!"
Cas and Crowley move to the landing zone and Crowley orders, "Sorry, but you're going to have to move to the main lobby. We're investigating a possible break-in."
. The name almost slaps Sam in the face with mocking. Sam shakes his head, "No. You're all using city names. Kansas is a
Cas scoffs, shaking his head, before he slams a hand down on the bench’s back and leans over to Crowley. “You will not give Dean’s name up.”
Kelly explains sheepishly, "I apologise, I know it's not professional but I couldn't find someone to watch Jack. The nanny backed out last minute so I had to bring him to work. I hope you don't mind."
That gets Dean thinking. His freedom for everyone else's seems like a fair trade, considering that he was the one to get them into this mess.
Kelly smiles, patting his hand once. “It’s supposed to just help you along. It takes time, Castiel.” She repeats his name often, he notices, but he’s read about it before. A psychological trick; repeat a name throughout the conversation to keep attention. Sam has the same habit, though Castiel doubts that it’s for the same reason as Kelly. “You admitted that you were hiding something and you came so close to saying it! Castiel, that’s progress. More progress than I anticipated. I’m sure it’s more than you expected from yourself too.”
Castiel walks into the office and Dean holds out the coffee to him, unsure if he was supposed to leave it on his desk or give it to him when he walks past. Castiel slows and takes the coffee from him, raising an eyebrow, "What did you get?"
Dean decided to keep the entrance and escape the same. A week before, Dean bribed an employee at the Diamonds Factory at Hatton Garden to render any one of the important machines completely useless so that they would have to bring in a new model by the next morning. They'd kept their end of the deal and the team split off -- Cas and Crowley taking over a cop car that Jo called for, and Jo and the rest of them took the truck.
"What are you doing?" Castiel asks, grinning. A teardrop catches onto his eyelashes and skates down his cheek.
"You dare to sin in front of God?" the man questions, appalled and shaming, and Castiel just wants to bury himself among the benches when some other people nearby look over and whisper.
"I haven't visited a church in years," Castiel admits. "I read my Bible before bed when I'm not too tired that the words blur and I say my prayers before I fall asleep. It relaxes me, I think."
Castiel smiles halfway, nodding, “Good. Alright. I’ll be going to see Kevin and check on the Met Gala materials and then I’ll be straight off to see Vaccarello. Before I’m back by 2, I need you to pick up my 10 scarves from Hermés, the polaroids from the shoot we did last week and ask Zeddmore for the social media analytics.”
Cas nods slowly, kneeling down to level with Toni. "Okay, I will clarify since you seem a little confused. You shot Kansas and tried to kill him. He almost died. That, I cannot forgive. After the first heist, let me tell you, I am sick of you cops. Metropolitan Police, Interpol, MI6, American PD, FBI, I don’t give a fuck."
Dean decided that Jo could give him some good advice on it — she was often willing to do things without asking for any context, for the sake of allowing privacy and Dean wonders why he hadn’t thought of consulting her in the first place. He tells her, Cas’s identity redacted, about what happened. She says the same thing as Charlie; fix him up a good dinner and ask him out, but after hearing that that fell through, she tells him to just tell him the next time they meet. “It will never be the right time, you will never be ready. So why not just go for it?”
When they are alone in the hallway, Dean carrying medicine and Angeles carrying food, Angeles says, "You know the state secrets could be false."
Dean hasn't heard from Crowley in a while, and Crowley didn't even show up for this year's Dalí gathering. Dean tried to get ahold of him or Rowena but didn't get any response. Cas tried to assure him that they're fine. Dean didn't agree.
Well, I’m in the church right now. Gabriel and Michael came to pray and asked if I wanted to come along. It’s not mass, but a bunch of kids are singing. Part of the choir, I think. When Love Was Born by some guy. Hold on, let me get you the name.
Castiel shrugs to ease his nerves, shifting in his seat next to Gabriel, “You know them actually. You’re friends.” That catches Gabriel’s interest and he starts listing guesses — all of which are women, obviously, and for some reason,
“Nice Valentino, sir,” Dean suddenly blurts out. He’s got no idea why he said it. It has no relation to what Castiel told him, but Castiel smiles small.
"No," Castiel answers. Meg chastises Kevin for such a lame question and Dean glances at Castiel — They don't know that he's gay.
"Adam?" Sam echoes, confused as he shifts out of the way while Crowley hastily gets the IV drip ready and Rowena scrambles to locate the adrenaline in case Michael's heart decides to give out. With a broken arm granted by Bevell, Sam, unfortunately, can't be of more help.
Dean has a plan. It's a time-consuming plan, but if it means getting the police's most valuable player off the field for as long as possible, he will take that opportunity. After the police ravaged Crowley's reputation like that, they lost their footing on the ladder a little bit, but that doesn't necessarily mean they can't still get to the top.
“That’s not an excuse,” Michael interrupts, his voice dark. “You will not say anything about the plan, because there isn’t one. Do you understand me? We’re giving you two choices. One, you walk out of here and tomorrow, you leave Dean alone. Two, you die in a laundry room.”
Adam reaches across the table to put his hand over Dean's in comfort. "Hey, if you don't want to, I'm sure he'll understand."
“You’re right, this is better,” Cas says, watching as the sky begins to bleed in shades of lilac and pink as the sun begins to dip below the horizon.
"I did it for you," Cas admits, and though Cas has already implied this before when he asked if Dean would be happier if he quit, it still sends tingles down Dean's spine.
“Who the hell sold to you? The CO?” Gabriel asks. When Michael doesn’t answer, Gabriel shakes his head — he always hated Webb, he will sell to any vulnerable person he can find in this prison. “What did you give for that?”
Dean puts down the phone and goes there, looking out. He sees Sam leave the tent and talk to the paramedics, obtaining something from them. Sam runs over to the front of the bank, stopping where Dean can see him. By then, Dean had pulled his mask back on. Sam holds up the object in his hand and Dean squints, realising that it's an IFAK kit. Sam points to the door just as Zachariah and the deputy inspector come out, yelling words Dean can't hear from where he is.
"You're right," Dean decides. He turns back to John, still standing a few feet away in front of them, and says, "Fine. We'll talk."
Sam had to meet with a business associate in New York and crashed at Dean’s apartment for the week again. It’s good news for Dean since he doesn’t have much to do with Cas gone, and he can catch up with Sam. They Skype with Eileen in the evenings and have dinner together, even though dinner lasts twice as long because they have to stop every couple of bites to sign to Eileen.
Castiel discusses, "I know you think you don't want to, but you want answers, right? Why he's showing up only now?" When Dean doesn't answer, Castiel says, "Talk to him, find out what you want to know. Nobody said you had to give him a place in your life."
"But we need Windom to prepare the escape truck. Our phone's cut," Cas points out, confused and weary by the night's events and his injuries.
Cas pauses, and his hand is a little cold in Dean's, but he contemplates it. Cas thinks of it this way: he's not even going to actually say anything. If he knows Sam as well as he thinks he does, Sam would ask Dean. All Cas has to do is say hello to Sam while dressed in Dean's shirt and shorts. No words needed. It's easy enough, just like with Rowena. Just as the knock comes again, Cas glances towards the door, steeling up a little. "I think I can do it."
Dean looks around at the other devouts praying and turns to Castiel, requesting, "Can you teach me how to pray?"
Dean nods once in Meg's direction and she walks over to Abaddon, roughly lifting her head up from behind so she will look at Dean again. She presses a gun against her temple and Dean says, "Abaddon will tell the public during the interview about what she did and name the people who gave her the go-ahead to kill Balthazar and Bela."
"I hope you're right," Dean mumbles, putting his phone down on its screen. "Sorry to hold you guys up, please eat your spaghetti."
She knows the dumb fucking police officers outside must think she's slacking off. When she comes out with all the Dalís' heads on a stick, they will know not to mess with an MI6 agent.
Dad's fucked me up royally, man. They always say your parents are the ones who you trust the most, and who love you the most. I think my dad loves me, but he doesn't like me. If you're confused, let me tell you that there's a difference. It doesn't make it any better. I still don't like my dad. Nothing will ever make it better again between us. To think I used to be so idealistic about it, you know... I thought it was just a phase.
"What's this?" Cas asks, holding the Chanel jacket up to himself and looking in the mirror.  "Doesn't look like you wear it often." Obviously, it's womenswear, but Cas honestly can't care about that. He just wears what looks good on him.
The two employees’ outfits do inject some faith into his bank account, though, considering that they’re both dripping with designer labels just as their boss is. The girl has a camel-coloured fil coupé trench coat with floral print from Oscar de la Renta that could easily cost her 3000 bucks, paired with Loubi Bee sandals from Christian Louboutin. It’s probably less than $1000, but it did look expensive. The boy had on matching classic samurai trousers with a waistcoat jacket, both having green pinstripes on a burgundy background. From the cut of it, they’re Vivienne Westwood.
On Christmas afternoon, he’d gotten a present mailed from Cas — a mixtape of mostly old songs and some fairly recent. Dean can’t help but note that Cas had consciously avoided putting love songs on the cassette, only leaving one or two romantic tracks, but a mixtape is a tender gesture. His came with a short note saying almost the same thing as Dean’s, a simple:
Cas closes the door to his office, making their souls the only two in their world, and trails off, “Dean...”
Dean and Cas sip at their respective coffee cups, both with the same arduous order. While they shared most of everything, the one thing they could never share was coffee. Dean had learned how to take his coffee as hot as Cas did, though he still had to blow on the surface before sipping.
“What, by giving you more information and have all the Dalís after my head? No thanks,” Crowley says.
Dean sighs, deciding that his favours with Roman are more important than secrecy. “Fine. What do you need to know?”
Dean moves to the kitchen after cleaning up, and the revelation leaves him buzzing. He decides to cook Cas breakfast — thank God it's Sunday, at least they don't have to rush to work. While mixing up pancake batter, Dean calls Sam who picks up after three rings.
“How was solitary?” Benjamin asks. It seems like he asks this to every inmate that returns from the SHU for the sole reason of provoking them. He’s had the pleasure of sending some inmates back who tried to punch him for asking the condescending question. Crowley won’t fall for that.
After dinner, they washed the dishes together and it just never felt like a chore whenever he did it with Dean. A lot of things didn't felt like a chore whenever Dean was around, actually.
and not you that you were going to prison. When you said ‘problem’, I expect it to be something like I don’t know, he busted his car. Not going back to prison.”
"The only casualty is at the hands of the police, so we're gonna win public favour by tomorrow morning when Chuck getting shot hits the news. I'd say I'm feeling pretty good," Dean smiles easily. "London said we're up about three hundred and four million and Berlin's got five thousand and six hundred kilos of gold in grains when Sam came over. Dallas is making good progress on the escape route. Can't complain."
“Balthazar and Meg taught me about it during Fashion Week but I think you should let Meg have the job,” Dean says carefully.
Meg leans down so her lips are next to Abaddon's ear and, quietly, says out of earshot of Missouri and Dede, "Talk or I'll put a bullet in your spine."
Dean had spent most of December sketching ideas for the Fashion Week runway too. He’d come to a final design proposal for Sam and Eileen’s wedding wear, the one he’d worked on in Paris with Cas’s help. They adored it and Dean promised to start working on the attire when the NOVAK building reopened. Kevin was excited to offer his help, knowing more about materials than Dean did, so Dean readily accepted his help.
“Hey, little bro,” Gabriel greets, keeping his distance from Cas so security cameras won’t think them suspicious. He sits down on one of the benches, smiling at Cas. “Must be peaceful down here.”
Cas gives a short speech about the summer collection before he goes backstage, giving Dean a thumbs up from the other end. The music starts to boom through the event hall and Dean counts down from three to the first model walking out.
Dean reaches forward, lets his mind take care of it, and he intertwines his fingers with Castiel's, and he pulls him into a dance by the road, in the night rain. Castiel's mouth falls open, the instinct to protest clear, but he doesn't say anything and lets Dean lead him in a dance that's just a little off-beat with the sound muffled by rain.
At 5:52 PM, the ground beneath them shook and they realised they were finally being stormed. Crowley had insisted beforehand that they all wear bulletproof vests just in case, and it was a good thing he did. Anael runs in and tells Dean that she released all the hostages.
We had our first date today. A movie, dinner and an exorcism. Who would think of an exorcism as a date idea? Dean is something else. It was surprisingly cheesy but sweet when he splashed me with holy water because I was "too good to be true". Though I am grateful that I wasn't wearing anything expensive. It dried off in a bit.
Kansas raises his hands and stands without argument, following Meg to the door where Paris and Athens are, rifles raised. Salem and Crowley are standing at the side, not aiming anything at Kansas. Kansas frowns, "What is this?"
"Nobody could have predicted Abaddon," Cas insists. "This heist is going to be even worse than the first one. Are you really ready for everything that will go wrong?"
Finally, John regards him. “I’m not stupid. I already saw you here when I came back. You have that guard you keep talking to, that one with the black hair that I’ve never seen before. You’re gonna bust someone out.”
“Kansas is in trouble,” Angeles answers, leaving his rifle behind as he starts making his way to where Kansas is held. Sam, Santiago and London follow, careful as they approach the door.
They can’t melt the gold down to grains like before, because by now any institution holding gold would have altered the holding areas so they’re incapable of accommodating the size of the equipment they need -- forges, furnaces and so on. Therefore, Dean agreed with Bela's note; grains are not an option. Moving the ingots on their own is too heavy and time-consuming on the exit. Gold nuggets were just bigger grains, they still don't have the space for the equipment. They had to make the gold convenient to get out and lightweight enough to carry.
It's extraordinary when Sam feels a smile grow on his face, a weight lifted off of his shoulders as Angeles says that.
Now, he's 8, and it's a little past midnight. Jo's probably still awake, honestly. She didn't like sleeping early, just like Dean. But he's also not eager for her to know why he was creeping downstairs this late at night.
"I told you I'd kill you," Abaddon whispers, pressing a pillow down onto Castiel's face with more force than he thought it would be. Distantly, he feels the pressure of a gun barrel press against the other side of the pillow, ready to fire.
Jack lies on their bed, eyes closed. Suddenly, there is the sound of angel grace, high and piercing, and Jack’s eyes open -- they SENSE something -- and they get up.
“Jesus, okay,” Dean replies, staring at Zachariah. He’s a short bald man and his expression is close to a sneer when he looks over one of the outfits. No wonder Mick doesn’t like the guy, he might as well spit on his work with the dirty looks he gives them. His suit is acceptable at best, but it wouldn’t hurt to put it through another round of ironing before he stepped out of the house. He vaguely reminds Dean of one of John’s friends when he was a kid, a man whose only bragging right is getting promoted at the DMV. Lame.
“A CO drove that, her name was…” Dean snaps his fingers, trying to bring the name tag back into his memory. He almost wants to scream when he remembers who it is. “Mother-fucking Monroe.” He considers it for a moment and then asks, “How do we feel about me getting someone outside to sabotage the bus?”
Where Castiel tries his best to make sure he isn’t being too hard on Dean and other employees, Dean tries his best to make sure Castiel isn’t overworking himself. If Castiel is going to stay in the office past midnight to work on custom pieces for celebrities, Dean stays late to help him pick up the pace, and he buys them coffee from that 24-hour café down the street.
Castiel shakes his head, “I can do it, Winchester, but thanks for offering.” As soon as he turns to walk into his office, a blonde Englishman runs in, donning full a black Versace suit. "Balthazar?"
Dean is making pancakes, trying to keep up the image of having good energy as he does so. He doesn’t want Sam to see how broken he really is.
The audio cuts off and the reporter jumps straight into explaining how this means that the police value governmental figures over their regular citizens, picking one over ten, and Sam puts his head on the desk as he listens to Zachariah shouting about finding out how they got the audio of him discussing with Sam.
Castiel decides that he doesn't care that there's probably a law against going into the water and gets in. He lets himself sink until his fingers graze the stone flooring at the bottom, and then he forces himself to stay there until his lungs don't feel like his own, and his mind is numb.
"This is the only way we will do it. After your stunt with Jack, I'm doubtful that you want to have 'has more important things than getting proof of life' on the list as well," Crowley snaps.
"It's not like it's a habit. It's purely recreational," Michael defends. He knows it's not a good reason, but Cas knows nobody can make Michael do anything he doesn't want to. "The doorbell's broken. Knock."
Michael slowly opens his eyes and pulls his gaze up from the dirty floor tiles to Gabriel, scoffing quietly once he processes who it is. “I just wanted to be numb for a bit, okay? Relax.”
Bela Talbot is a very intuitive woman. This is how she became such a successful businesswoman and kept up with the everchanging fashion scene and trends with perfect ease. It also means that when her friends act differently, she often knows what’s on their mind.
Cas looks like he’s about to explode — two days to the Emmy’s and there’s a big hole in Viola Davis’s dress. Everyone there is going to see the horrible attempt at reparation. Dean says quietly to Kevin, “Bring the dress to Isaac, see if he can fix the hole.” Kevin nods, taking the dress and hesitating, checking if Cas is alright with him leaving before he goes. Alan watches Cas as if, if he took his eyes off of him for a second, he would get shot. Dean puts a hand on Cas’s shoulder and watches them sag when their eyes connect as if just the touch of Dean is enough to stop him from going into hysteria over a torn dress.
He’s had a break-out plan prepared for a while — knock out a guard, steal the uniform and the gun, take the head CO hostage and forcibly leave. Cliché, but the only plan Castiel could think of that wouldn’t involve murdering someone on his way out. Another inmate tried breaking out last year by sneaking through the sewage. He got caught halfway through the pipes.
Toni is certain that Naomi and Ketch have gotten their outside surveillance man captured which means that the robbers have no security now. If they didn't, then it just goes to show that the basic police force is for the incompetent.
“Dean,” he affirms, waving a hand to tell Chuck to follow him as they make their way to the elevator. “Okay, come on. Cas is always 15 minutes early.”
“Hi, Mr Winchester. I’m calling from the NOVAK office,” a woman says. “We’re just checking if you will be showing up for work this coming Monday.”
“I need Cas,” Dean finally breaks. “This is pathetic. We’ve barely been here five hours and I just want him with me. He always—Cas keeps me
He doesn’t want the reservation to go to waste — Cas wanted to do something nice so if Pax isn’t going to come with him then he’ll just bring the man who booked the dinner.
Two robbers; one who's apparently Salem's girlfriend and one who's fresh out of jail. Both are skilled thieves and Dean just needs assistance. To get them in, they won't be able to do it quietly. There's SWAT at every entrance and snipers watch the skies. The next best thing after sneaking people in is to do it with as much attention as possible.
Meg monitors every hostage closely, making sure that none of them says anything that would implicate anyone in the team. If they did, she deleted the message. They wouldn't know if she did anyway. After a while, it's Jack Kline's turn. He hits the record button on his phone, the only one they turned on to allow filming. They didn't turn on service or the internet just to ensure that the police won't catch it.
With John dead, Dean hopes that can serve as some kind of cushioning for the impending rage from Sam he knows he’s bound to receive once news of this ‘heist’ gets to his ears. The heist on the Bank of America, the heist on the Diamonds Factory and now, essentially “stealing” Crowley from the Potosi Correctional Centre. He’s doing a bad job of being a good brother.
Least to say, he’s not very confident in his chances. He might just wait out his last year instead. It seems like the safest bet.
Sam nods toward the cup in his hand and says, “Yeah, what’s with the order, man? Isn’t that Cas’s order?”
Except that when they get to where Castiel said he left Sam and Abaddon, the only person there is Sam who is unconscious, bleeding from his head, a glass ashtray shattered on the ground next to him.
“Perhaps we should have stayed in bed the day Meg found us in Italy. We’d have avoided all of this.” Cas huffs a half-hearted laugh. “It’s all ‘what-if’s now.”
“Sorry. Can’t let you come along, but can’t let you talk either,” Dean says before his fist collides with John’s jaw. John stumbles back, not foreseeing the attack, and then Michael grabs a fistful of John’s collar, slamming him against the wall and punching him twice. Though he had no personal business with John Winchester, he needed the release and what better outlet than Adam and Dean’s shitty father?
Dean laughs as the boy eliminates pick-up line after pick-up line and pulls out the rose from behind his back, joking, “I don’t want to rearrange the alphabet but I did want to show this rose how beautiful you are.”
“No,” Michael instantly says. He knows what Alastair does within the confines of the prison walls. He doesn’t want the trouble. “I don’t do that.”
Charlie is appalled to hear that Dean hasn’t invited his “new husband” to that dinner and insists that he ask him today. She even offers him her Chanel No. 5 Eau de Parfum Spray perfume to wear but he decides to go with Balthazar’s Hugo Energise Cologne by Hugo Boss. Charlie sends him away with a good luck kiss on his cheek and Balthazar says he owes him for the little bit of cologne he used. Charlie actually offers to lend him her lucky Max Mara cotton crêpe trench coat but Dean says it’s okay.
“Then tomorrow,” Sam affirms. “I’ll go straight to your place after Eileen and I are done here, alright? I’ll see you later. Where are you anyway?”
He takes them to Daniel at Lenox Hill, which is a French restaurant that Dean would think is more appropriate for dinner. Just as well, it ends up being quite empty and it's not a surprise that the reservation was so easy to place. Castiel originally planned to bring Sam to Per Se, but they have a strict dress code and Sam is dressed in what Castiel whispers into Dean's ear is the ugliest flannel shirt he has ever seen which makes Dean laugh so hard that Sam regrets leaving all his clothes at Castiel's office.
"Shut up about the collection," Cas says bitterly. "It's withdrawn, it's scrapped. Why should I care?"
His phone rings and he grumbles under his breath, putting the cup down on a table and pulling his phone out of his coat — Michael. He picks up, saying, “Hey, babe. What’s up?”
Eventually, he agrees. "Alright, I assume you know my name so I'd like to know yours if we're going to be working together."
Castiel rests a hand on Dean's shoulder. "You have the right. Your father is ridiculous, no offence."
The Met Gala itself is a lot more buzzed than Dean thought it to be. Celebrities dressed in the most popular labels walk past the long line of photographers, turning every which way and posing with pleasant smiles. It’s not Dean’s first time in front of a camera, but it’s his first time in front of so many. The flashes go off warm on his face and he resists the urge to blink and tries to listen when photographers ask him to smile or give them a look over the shoulder, or to wink, or whatever else they want him to do. They compliment his suit and he tells them with a practised but stunning smile, “It’s Versace.”
He ran over everything in his mind again and again — John will be out of solitary in less than an hour, Crowley will be out tomorrow morning. Michael’s sister has to be kept apart from him. The bus is driven by aforementioned sister. He needs to get himself, Gabriel and Crowley out, the rest simply didn’t have to come back to work the next day.
The three of them end up in a small café nearby while Castiel calls a car to pick him up. A part of Dean doesn't really want Castiel to leave them alone with John but he knows Castiel doesn't want to intrude on his family issues and Dean's not sure he wants Castiel to see any ugly turns their talk could take. John never had anything good for them. John orders coffee and neither brother orders anything, full from lunch and agitated enough to not even get a drink. John starts, "You must have some questions."
Monochrome is good when done right but sometimes overused, and then colour wheel may be too predictable. Never wear an entire set of jewellery because it’s too dated but try not to leave your look not accessorised. Polka dots and floral prints go very well together but houndstooth and plaid will make people tear out their eyes. Hems of dresses should go to the top of the shoe at most if there won't be a train, any higher like at the ankle and it’ll make them look like they’re wearing their little sister’s high school prom dress. Bold colours mixed together is revolutionary but miss the shade by one Pantone hex digit and fashion editorials will eat you alive. Loose clothes in a drapey fabric are forgiving to your figure but in other fabrics, horribly unflattering. Stripes are problematic; pinstripes are a yes, wide vertical stripes are a no.
Sam lifts the IFAK medical kit to the windows of the bank and begins to walk closer. A Dalí looks out at him through the glass -- Dean -- and he turns to the door. He can hear Zachariah and Jody calling him back, warning him about snipers he knows aren't there for him. He keeps going until he reaches the door and it opens. Five Dalís file out with rifles raised, making sure nobody else tries to enter and giving Sam room to go in. Once he's in, they Dalís back away and the doors shut and lock once more.
"I'm thinking of getting spaghetti," Adam says, squinting over at the menu propped up over the counter. "They served it today at the hospital but honestly, it looks like it went bad years ago."
Dean falls silent as Cas waits for him to answer until Dean says, "Someone has to get Adam out of that tent."
Considering the new information for about two whole seconds, Dean replies, "Well, she almost sent me into cardiac arrest and got me killed so I think it’s karma. He’s
"She's good, just needs a little patching up. They opened fire, man," Dean answers. Angeles pushes the office door open with his uninjured hand and Dean nods in silent thanks, setting Salem down on the couch as London retrieves the medical kit in the bathroom. London sets the box down on the desk and takes out the disinfectant wipes and bandages, passing some to Dean. Angeles looks out of the window to observe the police and Dean moves over to tend to the glass in his skin. London takes care of Salem's injury.
After dealing with his business in Heaven, he returns to the bunker's kitchen to see Dean fixing up dinner and Sam on his laptop, likely looking for a case. Sam looks up and raises a hand in silent greeting.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Listen, we need a way to communicate in the Factory because running around as we did in the bank clearly didn’t work. Cas?”
Bevell had been knocked out hard by Detroit last night and Jo and Sam stood guard. Castiel spent all night by Dean's side in Sam's stead. Ash and Crowley watched the hostages while Eileen and Rowena went on with gold as Detroit and Meg carried on with diamonds. Crowley tried to keep operations running as smoothly as he can while Dean is out for the count but it's proving to be a task getting increasingly difficult as the day begins.
All in all, Dean felt good about his chances for now. It already feels like prison will be out of sight and mind soon. Cas was right, being here is awful, regardless of if he was getting out in a few days or not. He got why Cas, Michael and Crowley hated it so much. Even Gabriel didn't like it there, no matter how at home he acted about it.
Dean laughs, nodding and trying but failing to blink away tears. “I’ll ask him right now. You wanna go out and get some drinks tonight?”
"A lot. Police plans, the science of the gold..." Bela trails off, flashing her a brilliant smile. "But I think it's manageable. It has to be for all that money and gold. How did you find it?"
"I know! Fucking shit, I know," Dean snaps. "You think I don't care that Rome's dead? That's going to haunt me for the rest of my fucking life. If I could die in his place, I would. Rome -- Balthazar was my family, just like the rest of you. I love you all, and I'm always going to blame myself for Balthazar. This shit with Abaddon, I know it's making all of us scared and this is not helping at all. If you put down the gun, we can talk about it --"
They only got two large ones of the safest kind of pizza -- cheese. Dean says, "I hope you're not allergic or this would be very embarrassing, but I can cook you something --"
Crowley decides to give himself a break and calls Castiel from the door, "Angeles, come in and show your bandages." Castiel comes in and unzips his coveralls, pulling down one side to show the bandages crossing his shoulder and chest, crimson dotting through the cloth. He can see Dean tense up at the sight of it, probably thinking about how he has to change the bandages once the reporter team leaves.
Eventually, Charlie suggests an ironic game of 20 questions that gets them going, asking each other ridiculous questions and laughing at the answers. Even Meg joins in every once in a while as she works with Castiel, offering up juicy stories and gossip that are so bewildering that Castiel has to bite back a grin when everyone laughs.
,” Cas says, voice low with dread as Kevin holds up the dress for him to see. Cas holds up the back of it to stare, gaping, at the hole at the waistline that grows bigger by the second. “Who touched the fucking dress?”
This time, Kansas is the one who hangs up first. Sam collapses in his chair, covering his face with his hands. He hadn't expected Kansas to have done his homework but he should've seen it coming. This is the same guy who got all his robbers into the bank and stayed there for an undetermined amount of time before they tried to escape --
Crowley nods, wringing his mop free of excess water and then slapping it down on the tiled floor. “I am. She’s coming later. Don’t worry, I doubt she would want a tour of the prison. She should only be bothering with me in one of the rooms here.”
At some point, Gabriel tugs at Castiel's sleeve, grinning, "Come on, play it with us, bro. You never let yourself have any fun."
“Come on, let’s eat! I’m starving,” she says, dragging Dean by his arm to get food from the cafeteria. They’re serving hot ramen noodles today and Charlie is shocked that Dean’s never tried real ramen before. Ellen’s tried to cook some once or twice and Dean’s had instant ramen which totally doesn’t qualify, plus the time Sam cooked it halfway before he dropped the entire pot of it all over the kitchen floor because he underestimated how hot the handle was going to be. So yes, Dean has never tried real ramen.
They all get up at 8 to wash up so the bathrooms are full of almost every inmate at the time. Breakfast lasts until 9:30, then they have their work assignments (in which Dean has deigned to work in electrical while Gabriel scores the place in commissary after the previous inmate got sent to the SHU for smuggling contraband). At 1, they have lunch and then it’s free for all until dinner at 5. Curfew is at 11, though numerous inmates seem to continue sneaking around after the lights turn off.
When it’s late and Cas wants to go back to the office to pick up some folders before going home, Dean offers to go with him. He tells his family that they can go to his apartment if they want as Sam has a spare key, but if they’re too tired and want to go back to the hotel, Dean will see them off at the airport tomorrow. Everyone is agreeable with the plan and they go their separate ways. The private car was already taken by Gabriel and Balthazar apparently, so Dean calls for a cab.
"It's okay," Adam says, though he does stab a forkful of spaghetti. "And we won't tell anyone about you and Castiel. I think you told us on accident."
Dean heads straight for the fridge and rummages through slowly, coming up with a bottle of beer. Dean looks over and sees Michael sitting at the table, looking defeated.
"That does seem quite unrealistic," Castiel admits, casting a glance at Hannah who is now on a call waiting for the makeup to be fixed. "What are you thinking?"
“Yeah, well, after the military, I figured I should get an easy work kind of job. Sit around, yell at people to listen to you, beat people when they don’t,” Lilith says casually, stepping back to leave ample space between herself and Michael. “And I thought: Hey, a correctional officer. Seemed to be a good call.” Michael nods once, dreading having to talk to her, and she says, “It’s good to see you again, brother. What have you been up to?”
He thinks that maybe, that’s all the drama they’ll have for the day. Michael will be better by later tonight, Anael will be able to prove who stabbed Michael — though they all already knew, if it wasn’t Alastair, it would be Lilith. He thought that would be it for the day, until Lilith orders Gabriel to leave her and Dean alone in the cell to talk.
But Cas gives him a smile that tingles his cheeks in a way that it registers very late that he is smiling too.
No minors, that’s good. Ketch gets cocky. “Then tell me why we shouldn’t rush the building right now.”
"Alright." Dean types it into his computer's notes to transcribe with better clarity later on and he brings the conversation back, "I'm sorry, I should have been more careful."
Roman nods, looking mildly annoyed. "I'm tempted to ask you what tricks you have up your sleeve but you won't tell me, will you?"
Sam straightens up and pushes his hair behind his ears, walking back out of the tent to look at the bank. If he didn't know what had transpired, he would never have guessed that there was a hostage situation. It looked perfectly peaceful from the outside, spare bulletholes in pillars at the entrance.
Dean aims his revolver at the ceiling and shoots, and as he hears the other robber's boots get closer, he distantly wonders why the police haven't stormed the bank yet. Rapid gunfire and, though he couldn't hear it, Dean assumes the hostages would have been screaming. No proof of life and their landline is down. They had every reason to rush them in the bank. Why haven't they?
The other inmate looks up at him with a raised eyebrow. His hair is grey at the edges and he looks like he barely smiles. “Ishim.”
Dean waves as if to say it doesn’t matter and pulls out his phone, saying, “Nah, they’ll get it. I’ll just tell them not to wait up for me. It’s all good.” He shoots Sam a text to let him know that he’s staying late to help Castiel with Met Gala design drafts and Sam’s reply is almost instant, reading:
Of course, because of Roman’s favours, Dean had secured Gabriel and his job postings in the kitchen with Crowley so that they can escape through the stock delivery van. Meg told Anael last night that Jo or Ash will probably drive the van and help them get away, though he woke up to a text update from Meg saying that Dorothy may be the one instead.
After the third runway show of the week, Castiel’s itching to get back to his hotel and catch some sleep, saying that he feels fucking
Dean shrugs and closes his eyes, saying, "Dear God, I hope Cas will love me forever." Castiel shoots him a look and Dean smiles, eyes still closed. "I hope Sam and Eileen's wedding will be great — I mean, I know it will, but a little blessing never hurt anyone, right? And I hope that NOVAK and Cas keep getting better." He adds like an afterthought, "Also, I think it would be really cool if I got to have Gary Busey at my funeral."
Dean sits up too, hugging Cas from behind with a lazy smile as he presses a kiss to his clothed shoulder. "Yep. We should go to bed, school tomorrow."
"Yeah, that's true," Adam nods in understanding. "Imagine him proposing to you and then the FBI shows up."
"Aw, come on," Dean pouts dramatically, turning to look at himself in the mirror. He grins when he sees Crowley's flat look in the reflection. "I think I look hot."
"We'll hold off on that. I want to see if they try anything else," Naomi declines. "They're releasing hostages and I want to know why."
"Yeah! Go get those heels," Charlie says, making a kissing sound to the receiver before the line goes dead when she hangs up. Dean pockets his phone and is about to leave when Inias comes in, looking around.
Adam slams his elbow into Lilith’s side but she grips him harder. The scalpel in her hand slides across Adam’s arm and Dean rushes over, raising the crowbar just as Lilith turns around to face him.
Dean eats quietly, and now Sam sees through his act when Dean’s hand unconsciously run over the sleeves of the coat.
Castiel says, finding it surprisingly easy to admit in the heat of the moment, "Men." Hannah stares at him, unblinking with shock, and Bela laughs, hooking her arm through Castiel's and leading him out of the studio.
Dean tips over a little too much and his hand catches onto Cas’s cobalt tie, his smile is too tipsy for it to be professional and friendly, and his voice is ecstasy, “Thanks, Cas.”
Dean runs back into the office with a minute to spare before it hits 9:30 and he sighs loudly in relief as the doors open and Castiel isn’t there yet. As soon as he reaches his desk and sets down Castiel’s coffee, he sees the Asian guy from the airport run past into the other elevator, and he quickly realizes that that means Castiel has arrived.
Over dinner, Cas promises that he won’t act like Dean’s boss. He actually said he was genuinely trying to be better for Dean, and that he’s starting with not running from anything emotional. That said, he opens the evening with, “The people at the orphanage thought I was a weird child.”
Fifteen minutes after the interview, a different news reporter says that Crowley is not connected at all to the trafficking case, proving that it was false allegations to defame the robbers, and demands for the officer who orchestrated the leak to be named and fired.
Mick stands by the partition, leaving only himself and Adam in that closed-off area of the tent. Adam glances at him and knows him as one of the ITs. He's probably an officer who's just technologically proficient if he's been asked to guard him. Mick moves closer and Adam straightens up, wary.
Sam still disapproves, obviously, and Dean wonders just how much do Sam and Cas share between each other. At this point, they might as well be a reality show and replace that
Sam simply grins, shaking his head as he puts a framed photograph of him, Dean, Bobby, Ellen, and Jo up on the mantelpiece. They took it when Dean was 7 and Sam was 3, the week after John walked out on them. Dean carried Sam in his arms for the photo and Sam was crying loudly. Bobby had a pacifier ready in his hand, Ellen had a small fluffy blanket, and Jo tried her best to grin. “Yeah, you should.”
“Dean, stop flirting, we’re in prison,” Cas says with feigned seriousness. A smile graces his face as he continues, “And I’m a chaplain. It’s inappropriate.”
Adam's call comes exactly when Dean thinks it was coming, and it's just him asking why the hell they're on the roof. Dean explains that apparently he had unsettled some hostages and as an apology, he granted them permission to walk around the roof with Salem and Angeles to calm down. Adam accepts it even though he doesn't think it's a good idea, which Dean appreciates.
Dean shrugs, “Well, things with Pax are rocky, things with Cas are rocky, I was on rocky land with Sam and everything is just... rocky.”
"That box is fine," Dean answers, pointing to one of the unsealed boxes. Cas nods, bringing it over to put the books in. True to his word, Cas spent the whole Sunday helping Dean pack his things into boxes. Some things Dean no longer wanted like a Rubik's Cube that no longer turns in one of the rows and the remaining half of the bottle that John brought that time, Dean decided to not take with him. It's a good drink but Dean hated the memory. He didn't bother finishing the rest of it.
"So are you?" the pap asks further, ignoring Dean and making him roll his eyes, urging Cas forward to the car. "There are photos of you being close to each other in Paris! A fan caught you two outside the Sacré-Cœur —"
Violet and Rowena hit Dean with the spell and a bright light covers Dean. Sam and Adam shut their eyes against the brightness. When the light fades, Dean and Violet are gone. Sam is crying and Rowena tries to comfort him:
"I get to wake up next to you," Cas says happily and Dean smiles at him, the same way Cas had smiled when Dean said he was his boyfriend. It's such a gorgeous smile, he is a picture of happiness and crooked imperfection and Cas just loves him so bad.
"Yeah, sure," Dean agrees. Over the past year, as Dean started gaining attention for the collection he did with Cas and freelance pieces he did and posted to Twitter, Dean also rose in fame and started being in photoshoots. He apparently had pleasant enough features to be a model. While he did do some shoots here and there, designing and styling were where his passion laid.
"Alright. Henriksen, go and deal with those rioters outside. Get them the hell out of here," Naomi orders. "I don't care if you do it by force. I want them out." Victor nods and leaves promptly.
Jack Kline," Jody confirms. "We don't know if he or the governor have been harmed. No proof of life has been given."
!” Castiel throws a file against the wall and pinches the bridge of his nose before running his hand over his face, looking between Dean and Rowena. Dean is frozen in place; he’d never seen his boss so angry in his two months of working for him. Castiel stares at Dean and it feels like forever until he moves, storming to the elevator, “For fuck’s sake, where’s Barnes when you need her?” Rowena trails behind him hurriedly, maybe to make sure he doesn’t wreak havoc all over the building in his rage.
it happen? Dean isn't even that sure. Maybe he liked the rush he feels when Castiel walks into the room, firing off everything he needed Dean to do for him that day. Maybe the adrenaline presented itself in a different way. Dean says, signing as he talks, "Don't know. It just did, I guess. Forget about it, it's nothing. Tell me about that Sam kid in Eileen's class."
Castiel finds out about Pax Luck from Rowena, who he overhears laughing about Dean and Pax with Crowley over the phone. He wishes he can say he isn't surprised, but he is. He thought he and Dean had a good thing going on, honestly. He liked Dean, at least, he liked him enough to think about abandoning professionalism and asking him to dinner again but perhaps in a more romantic setting. He liked how free he felt around Dean as if he didn't have tons of things on his to-do list and he didn't have a spotlight on him whenever he left his house.
"I don’t know, man. I think he's gonna fire me by the end of today,” Dean mutters. He can hear his heart in his chest. “I wouldn’t normally worry but he’s been in a bad mood since I came back late from lunch and then the whole thing I told you about how nobody was ready for the shoot... How am I supposed to turn this around?”
"What for?" Crowley questions, looking up from the sketches he was going over with Castiel. Castiel gets up to pour himself a glass of water.
The Asian guy from earlier comes back in and greets, “Hey, man. I’m Kevin.” He’s dressed simply; just a jacket, shirt, and pants from H&M. It can’t be more than $100 in total but it looked good.
Dean and Cas freeze in place, hand in hand, and Michael's mouth falls open. Uselessly, Dean says, "You killed her."
No matter, Dean will just get him to take it out from the magazine and then he’ll have repaired his relations with Castiel. It’ll undo his damage.
“Lee bought that for your birthday, right? How much was that?” Sam asks, putting more photos on the mantel.
But between Gabriel insisting that Cas isn't into anyone, how devoured by his work Cas is and the way he hasn't mentioned a single thing that could lead Dean to believe the feeling is mutual, Dean's more than sure that Cas, in fact, doesn't feel the same way about him. Maybe it's a professionalism thing and Dean wonders that if he wasn't his personal assistant if Cas would say yes if he asked him out. Over the years, numerous failed relationships dotting his life's timeline, Dean would say he's great at knowing if someone is into him or not and Cas isn't.
“The point is,” Crowley says, raising his eyebrows as if warning him against interrupting. “That if you think you’re slick with this crush on him, you’re wrong, because we all see it. Wings might not but that’s because he’s generally oblivious to feelings if they aren’t his own. So, if you like him as much as I know you do, just tell him.”
Lilith, the CO that drives the inmates into the prison, turns back in her seat to tell him to get out. Crowley steps out of the bus and breathes in deep, taking it all in. Spending the last two weeks in solitary was horrible. He’d been pissed to find out John got out a day earlier than he did but when he remembers that he’s going to die in twelve days, one day really doesn’t seem like such a big deal anymore.
“Thank you,” Castiel says and Dean can hear the adrenaline and alcohol in the way his voice trembles. Dean understands why he’s so shaken up about the article almost running. “I don’t know what I would have done if it printed.”
started this," Castiel accuses. "You started the mutiny, you gave them the weapons, you got them a fucking gun, for God's sake!"
“Good, yeah. Food’s great and New York’s beautiful. Cas got me this coat from, I think, Lacroix?” Sam says, pointing to the grey trench coat as he completely butchers the pronunciation of Lacroix. “Why, what happened at work?”
“Good. Don’t disappoint me or you’re fired,” Cas says simply. “Where are we on Pax with Vanity Fair?”
He repeats Sam’s words, “Look, if I didn’t take the job, he would have given it to someone else because you didn’t tell him on time. Cas gave it to me because you weren’t there when the clock hit 3! This is
“Well, originally, it was just Dean, Michael, Gabriel and me, then Cas and Adam got overprotective. You know how they can be,” Anael says, rolling her eyes. “But I think Michael had a bad time in prison so Adam wanted to look out for him, and you know Dean’s never been in here before. Cas worries.”
. The word rests on the tip of Castiel’s tongue. It would be so easy to say. Kelly still doesn’t know about Castiel, she just knows she’s here to help him, make it easier to come out eventually.
I made this for him, to remember him and all the time we spent together. I saved every note when we were just Snail Dude and Locker 275, and I couldn’t delete any texts with him there, and all the drawings and photos I made or took. It’s all for Cas, and it’ll forever be here.
Dean stares at him for a full minute, letting people bristle past them outside Saks Fifth Avenue, until he eventually asks, "Did Rowena tell you?"
“I’ve got some drama from upstairs if you want excitement,” Gabriel offers. “So your husband and his bro? Not doing so well. Kinda stressing Dean-o out, honestly. Anael’s got her hands full being basically Dean’s second-in-command. Crowley and Meg are being sneaky and, between you and me, Dean’s a little anxious about this plan now. He’s also worried about how Sammy’s gonna react once he finds out where he’s been.”
Dean nods in agreement and says hesitantly, making a turn into another hallway, "You picked Los Angeles because someone called you Angel."
Cas puts the cup down on Dean’s desk, saying, “I asked for your drink to be hotter so it wouldn’t get too cold on the way here. If it’s not warm anymore, someone in the cafeteria can heat it up for you.”
Dean smiles wryly. “It’s a harder heist. I have to be more prepared. So Ash and Jo will set up the shortwave radio when we’re at the Factory. All of us will each have a walkie-talkie and Kevlar vest on. In fact, all the hostages will have a vest. In case there’s another Abaddon.”
Dean nods slowly as he thinks about it. "I didn't love him then. He was cold and he fired people for tiny mistakes. His coffee order is painfully specific. He wants a hundred things done within an hour. He gets angry even faster than I do and he didn't know how to say 'sorry."
Castiel replies, "It really is too bad, then. I could rock his men's collection." He hangs the dress on the rack and claps his hands once, saying, "Okay, get the hell out of here. I'm getting drunk and we're supposed to leave in a few hours, so leave me alone. Scram."
"Can you call them, see if they've reached yet?" Sam requests and Jody steps away to contact the drivers.
Castiel is quietly impressed by some of the kids' honesty, and a little sympathetic to the way they feel. It's definitely not a good feeling to have the police pick your friend over you. Once Krissy is sent off and Salem and Rome leave to bring another hostage, Sam is clearly exhausted, running a hand over his face and sighing deeply. Crowley notifies them, "The governor and the security team left."
“I’m here, I’m here!” Duma announces, bursting through the doors with a rack of the collection pieces. “I’m so sorry, Mr Novak.”
Dean grimaces and says, "And I'm sorry for that, okay? I already said that I'll never move on from that. But the rest of you, I got you out. Look, if you're this unhappy with the plan then just walk out right now, get on the next flight back to France."
The runway passes much quicker than Dean thought it would feel, but it’s exhilarating the whole time. No matter how many or how few models were left waiting for their turn to walk down the runway, Dean was just as excited to see them walk out. After the last model comes back behind the stage, all the models walk out and line up in a row on the runway. Cas comes out after them, beaming as the audience claps for his collection. He bows once in silent thanks and as the tradition, holds hands with the last model, Anna, as they all disappear backstage as the runway music comes to an end.
“I just picked a random name. It’s a coincidence that a nurse with the same name got hired,” Michael answers.
Dean chuckles, tapping the base of his fork against his lower lip. "I don't get it, man. What's the big deal? At most, I'll ask him out. At worst, I'm not his type. What's so bad about that? Maybe he likes his guys a little less personal assistant."
Jess's eyes follow as Dean is taken by medics to stabilise and she nods frantically. "Yes, Dean's my boyfriend. Please save him, I love him so much, I can't lose him."
Cas walks to the back of the room and grabs something, bringing it to the front and putting it down on Dean’s desk. He explains, patting the device, “Shortwave radio. They go at frequencies between 1700kHz and 30 MHz. These went almost obsolete after the internet came in. They let us communicate at long distances, so we will be using walkie-talkies to talk to each other and with Adam and Jess.”
Cas walks over and gently pulls Dean into an embrace. “I’m sure they can let one hug go. Hello, Dean.”
in this weather? It’s like 15 degrees and your coat isn’t even thick!” Before Cas can say anything, Dean puts the cup down and shrugs off his coat, a good heat-resistant one from Mission Workshop. He urges Cas to take his normal Prada coat off and drapes his over Cas’s shoulders, dusting snow out of Cas’s dark hair and giving him his coffee. “Drink, I kept it hot.”
He walks back to his desk, running it over under his breath, “Okay, okay. Gabriel and I are going to Fashion Week, check for Bela and Lucian, tell Pam, Kevin, Charlie, Balthazar, and Meg to stay free... Book him for New York, hold off on Paris and Milan. No for London. Check with designers for AA sketches... What else, what else...” He squeezes his eyes, trying to remember everything. “Shit, yeah, call Margot Robbie and Bradley Cooper. Fuck, book our flights for November 14th to LA.”
It’s why his dad freaked on Gabe when Cas fainted in Barcelona, and why Cas wasn’t on the school’s swim team, or doing any sports for that matter.
"I got you," Adam assures. When it hits one minute and he hears the alarms go off from Dean's end of the earpiece, he tells him, "You have three minutes exactly."
"Ooh, Mr. Bossy," Dean grins. Cas rolls his eyes and leaves, and Dean thinks he could get used to this.
“Jo and Eileen, front seats, go!” Dean orders before he puts on a cap. Sam, Adam, Jess and Meg will have to leave in different ways and disguises since the police had their faces and names and Adam insisted on bringing Michael along with him so he’d gone with them. Dean stayed with the truck just to ensure that they get past all the cops looking for them.
Crowley orders, giving Michael anaesthetic, "Find Bevell, we don't need to worry about a shooter on the inside on top of snipers. Eileen, move Dean to another room, we need to work." Eileen gets moving, taking Dean's gurney and pushing it out into a different office as Cas, Jo and Meg set off to find the runaway MI6 agent.
"What the hell?" Dean puts the glass down and goes closer to the mirror, touching his face in horror.
Naomi had given up on interrogating him today so he'd taken his lunch to the prison's chapel to spend the time with Castiel, Adam and Anael. Gabriel and Dean were in the cafeteria, handling the food. Crowley
"Yep," Dean nods, releasing Abaddon's head. "We're gonna ask for one reporter and one cameraman, and we're gonna do an exclusive interview. One hour at most, and one spokesperson. Berlin, would you do it?"
"With his luck? Of course. Michael was with Alexander," Castiel says, deadpan, and they lose it once more.
"Since I turned 5," Sam answers, taking a match from Dean to help light up the ropes. The two kneel down and work on it before they stand and take steps back.
“Oh, hey. I wanna give this to you,” Dean says, holding out a shirt Dean had gotten from H&M a long time ago. “I don’t really wear it and it cost like 40 bucks. Keep it.”
Dean just laughs and gets a forkful of this meal that the waiter recommended (which turns out to be pretty good) into his mouth. He asks, "Say, do you know how to speak Italian? I remember you spoke a little French in Paris but it was just basic stuff."
"I don't want you to stay with me!" Michael retorts. When Adam is rendered speechless, Michael runs a hand over his face. Of course, he's making it worse, he always does. Michael draws in a deep breath and tries again. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to snap, it's just that... Adam, I love you. I have never loved anything more than you, I never will, and that's why I can't do this. I'm not going to make you wait for me. It's not fair."
Both Dean and Adam's eyebrows rise in surprise, staring at Michael. Adam says, mesmerized, "You got him to apologise. That shit is
"Look, you need it and we don’t have another choice," Cas insists, looking over his gun before pulling his mask back down over his face.
"Gabriel's life and mine don't mesh very well," Cas replies, pouring two glasses of water. "He likes to bring people home often which I have no problem with, obviously. But I have very expensive pieces here and I don't like it when people I don't know stay overnight in my home."
Benny gives him a knowing look, sitting down across from him at a small table. “Come on, the charming Dean Winchester doesn’t have someone on his arm?”
Meg mutters, “Yeah, say it a little louder, Novak. I don’t think his mom in Michigan heard you yet.”
“You look so fucking hot,” Dean blurts out. Cas’s face splits into this beautiful grin that has Dean weak but he recovers when he sees Rowena’s bright red hair from his peripheral vision. Cas straightens up as well, catching on.
Meg is already getting Crowley on the truck — Anael and Adam leave through a regular exit, out of Naomi's sight. Gabriel touches a hand to Cas's arm gently. "Cassie, we gotta go. We're running out of time."
"Thanks for that. I haven't had a good dinner like that in months," Dean smiles as they leave the restaurant. "Are you going home?"
Castiel shakes his head, “No, no. It’s a good choice of clothing and you have a great eye for style, but it’s Fashion Week, not another day at the office. Look, come with me.” Dean nods, following Castiel as they make their way to the company’s grand closet. While Missouri passed him some pieces from there, he’s never actually been in it. It takes up the entirety of the ninth floor, full of racks of clothes, bags, shoes, and accessories that are no longer needed or simply waiting to be used.
Jess shrugs. "Don't know. I'm thinking that maybe we should wait until there isn't so much attention on the heist, you know?"
She peers out of the doorway to scape her surroundings -- about eleven Dalís there, one injured and a redhead caring for him. Meg Masters is arguing with a dark-haired man. Toni can recognise Crowley and Sam as well but the other faces are nameless to her. Uncaring of what they're bickering about but knowing a distraction when she sees one, Toni uses the commotion to creep past to the offices undetected. She's not MI6 for nothing; Toni is cautious as she avoids every camera she sees. They definitely have someone doing surveillance for them.
Dean laughs and puts an arm around Cas's shoulders, balancing the plate on his lap. "You're in for a ride, honeybee."
Adam nods, unsure, and closes his eyes. Sam and Dean watch him. Violet and Rowena begin preparing the bomb.
The models come back out half an hour later, light and natural makeup painted on their faces while they donned unreleased NOVAK pieces. Gadreel and his team take the photographs as Castiel watches, occasionally giving direction and approving photos.
“Hi, this is Michael, and I’m Adam Winchester,” the blonde one says, and Dean feels it like a punch to his gut. “Or Milligan, I go by that, mostly... I’m your half-brother, your father got together with my mom? I should have come and found you guys sooner, but I didn’t know how to say it, you know?”
Angeles questions, "How do you know they won't storm the bank when the president's son is in there with us?"
“Fair point.” Cas chuckles, finally turning to look at Dean. “So, kitchen duty. I’m surprised you didn’t get that in the first place. You cook very well.”
Cas gives him a challenging grin and says nonchalantly, "This isn't hot enough." Dean's eyes grow wide and he shakes his head, though a small smile stays on his face. He looks back at his computer and types into it. Cas clears his throat and gets into business. "Is there any news for me?"
“You didn’t give him your number,” Adam says, giving him an odd smile. “He wanted me to pass you his contact and to tell you that he wanted to meet you and Sam, actually talk things out. He felt like the first time, it didn't pan out. He wanted to try again, that he owed you two that much.”
Toni rests the tip of the syringe's needle against Dean's neck. "Except this time, you know when exactly the bullet will go off, and you know I will not hold back because we’re not friends. You’re not in charge of my payday." Dean takes a sharp inhale when he feels the needle go in. "I take it you know what I’m doing."
If he’s with Adam, he wouldn’t have betrayed them anyway. Adam’s one of the reasons Michael could see his worth and betrayed Chuck in 15x08.
The memories stop playing and the Shadow looks around, wide-eyed as if checking to see if anybody has woken up — nobody. It looks UNSETTLED.
Dean runs his hands over a rust satin georgette gown, Narciso Rodriguez, and says, “This dress is beautiful.”
Castiel shows Sam and Eileen around the building, and Dean realizes belatedly that he himself hasn't even been to every single floor of the building yet despite his duties as Castiel's errand boy. With level one being the lobby, two being the cafeteria, five being the studio and level ten being Castiel's office, Dean's only ever really been at four floors. His work friends usually meet him in the cafeteria or find him at Castiel's office so he never goes to their respective floors. Except for the one time, he visited Kevin just to see what he did as a garment technologist, but that was months prior.
“The point is that they were here at all and you got to know them. When they’re gone, it will hurt, but that hurt will remind you of how much you loved them.”
, man. That's the biggest bomb we have against the government other than the kid," Dean snaps. "If you're worried about them finding your identity or anyone else's, relax. None of us went to the bank other than the two of them and the car they drove, I made sure it was wiped clean and demolished. Untraceable. We're ghosts."
If Lilith was truly as awful as Michael makes her out to be, then surely using underhanded ways to get her off bus duty wouldn’t be a hit on anyone’s morals. After which, they’ll just take the bus and go. If there are other inmates to be fetched or brought, just leave them behind. Dean complained that they’ll be caught instantly if they didn’t bring anyone else but Gabriel, Dean and one death row inmate. Meg reluctantly agreed and the plan got scrapped. Then Meg had suggested them going to the SHU and getting bust out from there instead. Dean thinks it’s too risky.
At that moment, Chuck enters the NOVAK building dressed in a camellia tuxedo — navy with black satin lapel detailed with Japanese stitch embroidery finished with a single button on the jacket. He wears a white Japanese camellia shirt underneath, also embroidered.
He adjusts his seat at the desk and signals to Inias Garrison to connect the call between him and Kansas. After ringing out three times, the line picks up and Sam greets, "Hello, Kansas. Have you made up your mind?"
Thanks for reading! If you liked it, you should watch the original show. (Though this fic would have given a number of spoilers by now if you haven't...)
John shakes his head, locking his fingers together as he leans forward on his elbows. “No, tell me. I want to know.”
When he sees armoured cars pulling up outside, his eyes widen and he storms back into the tent, grabbing Zachariah. "Why is SWAT here?"
, Ketch shoves him back into the tent into Mick's responsibility, leaving to deal with the crowd who'd seen the Dalí get sniped.
"Even if it's goddamn fifty years, I'm willing to wait," Adam protests. "Michael, I'm not going anywhere."
“That’s still in Hatton Garden,” Cas mumbles, but he narrows his eyes as he looks over the noted on the plan -- all over are elegant scribbles by Crowley and Bela, noting possible entry and exit points.
Kansas was a genius, a criminal with a mind that could defeat any enemy; a swift hand that crushed every problem that came their way. Kansas was the only source of stability of the other Dalís' lives since the start of this mess, the only one they could count on to protect them. He was the promise of a better future, a new beginning; for some, the only shred of hope they've had in years. He’s the sand at the top half of the hourglass, when you see that time is moving but there is still so much of it left.
Charlie gasps loudly, slapping a hand over her mouth, and Kevin barks a laugh. Even Meg smirks at the statement and Dean can't hold back a grin, watching the small smile creep onto Castiel's face, and Gabriel gapes, "You never told me this story before! Then what?"
Before the man can walk off, Adam grabs his arm and looks at him, greeted by blue eyes, dark hair and a smile. "Why'd you give me this?"
The robbers start shooting faster at SWAT as Angeles bends to crawl behind the barricades, moving as fast as he can to Dean's side. He pulls Dean behind a shelf and lifts up both their masks to get a better look. It's a little bit comforting to have Angeles's warm hand pressed to his face and Dean's fingers graze his.
where none of them are able to find their footing in the song and they end up a laughing mess. Dean follows up with
of air she pushes into his arteries. He's resilient and loyal, she'll give him that. He's up to 40cm
Dean presses his lips together as he thinks — he promised Cas that he would never do another heist again, but this technically isn’t a heist, right? And, while true that he no longer bore any responsibility for the Dalís the moment they part ways on the escapes, this was different. Crowley was going to get his brains fried in under three weeks. He can’t turn away from that. Crowley is a loyal friend and Dean always knew he had his back during their heists. He could always trust Crowley. Now, he had to show Crowley that his trust wasn’t misplaced.
Dean turns and takes the sketchbook, flipping a few pages earlier to show him one of his sketches for Eileen's dress. "I like this one the most, I could see her in this." It is a nude colour with light ivory tulle. Long sleeves with gold Chantilly lace bodice and an asymmetric pleated tulle skirt.
Dean nods slowly, the gears in his brain shifting as he thinks. "So I need to stop Naomi from printing the article."
She does stop struggling, only to get a good look at each face. She has a sharp nose, icy blue eyes, a smile so irritating that Cas would love to shoot it off her face and blonde hair tied to stay out of her face. Detroit asks, gun pointing right between her eyes, "Who the hell are you?"
”I have some work for you,” Cas says and Dean takes a gulp of his coffee before grabbing a pen and his planner. “Have the designers put their proposals on my desk by 3 today, with or without clothing samples. Giambattista Valli is in NYC next week and I need a meeting with him. Check with Zhou Yang Jie when I need to come by to collect my shoes from him. Arrange for Toni Bevell to come by for fitting this week. Can you cancel the lunch with Phoebe Philo on Thursday and replace her with Crowley, she’s gotten sick and can’t make it. Pick up 20 scarves from Hermés by tomorrow and the polaroids from the winter shoot. That’s all.”
Crowley grabs him from behind, telling him that they don't have time and need to blow up the tunnel. Dean tries to fight against it but when he sees Benny go down, he knows he has to go. The tunnel blows up behind him and Crowley, stopping the SWAT team from going through, and Dean's heart hurts as he cries into Cas's arms when he sees him on the other side.
"Stop talking, boy. Your lung is going to collapse," Rowena frets, turning Michael on his side to better tend to him.
Missouri and Dede exchange shocked looks and Missouri asks, raising her own handheld microphone to Abaddon's face, "Why did you kill them?"
“Mr Novak? Dean Winchester is here,” she says. “Alright, I’ll send him up.” She hangs up and stands, leaning over the counter slightly to direct Dean towards the elevator, “He’s not here yet, but his office is on the highest level. Go up from there, turn right and then left down the hallway. That’s him.”
Crowley pauses like he’s considering lying, quiet for one second too long, and that second makes Dean’s chest cave in. He asks, “What would you like me to say?”
"Do you want to leave?" Dean asks carefully. Though he may be going to therapy, Dean knows it's not a fast process and that means Cas's fuse will still be short.
“You can’t scare me like that, man,” Gabriel frowns, cupping Cas’s face in that protective-brother way, his eyes scanning Cas for any signs that he’s still unwell, and Cas just frowns back. “Dad damn near tore me apart for not arguing that he should have come along! At least his favorite son’s at home placating him.”
There’s a heavy pause where they both know Cas’s name should be, but neither of them dares speak his name.
Michael settles in the surveillance room, looking over all the aged monitors as the images flicker. He keeps note of the angles of the cameras, how much ground each one covers and which corners are hidden from view. It may be helpful.
Michael is doing a lot better there than in the prison’s medical bay which relieves Adam immensely. They don’t let him stay overnight so Adam can only try to see him for a few hours  and then wait until the next day. At least they’re leaving soon; they’ll be back in Detroit by tomorrow night.
Out in the yard, the sun isn’t so bright now that it’s closer to evening, so Dean has a jacket on over his prison uniform. Gabriel ties the sleeves of his jacket around his waist and has a toothpick between his lips.
Cas's eyebrows rise at the sudden topic change but he takes it in stride, lifting the garment to continue sewing. "The Impala, right? How is she?"
“Go fuck yourself, Samuel,” Crowley says, though he leans to give Rowena a final hug before he pulls a hat over his head and leaves.
Cas reaches over to take Dean’s hand in his. “If you ask me, you’re still Dean. I don’t think Kansas is consuming you. Maybe one day, when we’ve put all the Dalí business behind us, you can go back to how you were before it started.”
Meg questions, her drawl twice as slow now that Dean is pressed for time, “Winchester, what are you taking Ingrid for?”
Dean chuckles, finally looking back at Cas. "I can tell. You threatened to fire me multiple times, sir."
“Exactly,” Gabriel said lightly, running a hand through Castiel’s soft hair. “Why’d it bother you so much? Are you gay?”
Dean stares, almost disbelieving of Castiel giving him his name, and he returns the favour without even having to think about it, "Dean Winchester."
Anael’s first shift happens to be in the cafeteria so she casually walks around until she ends up by Dean and Gabriel’s table. There, she says only for the two of them to hear, “I’m gonna be doing surveillance shift from 5 to 9, Michael has it from 1 to 5.”
John watches from the doorway, arms cradling Sam like he's the most fragile thing on Earth; he's so tiny, born just months before, and Dean already loved his brother so much. John hums along and Sam stirs, sounding off baby babble as Dean and Mary sing
He thought Dick was joking but Dean guesses his nickname among the big figures really is Cas's guard dog. He doesn't really care about that. Dean asks, "So you stopped the article?"
, the name gets caught in Sam's throat. He never got closure with Dean. At least with Mary, he didn't even get to know her and moving on was easy, it was survivor's guilt from his birth that was hard. With Dean, he just disappeared and even though it took 20 years of disappearance to be legally declared dead, the police told Sam that they wouldn't keep their hopes up after a year.
Castiel turns back to the hostages and orders, "Put on your masks and make sure to grab a fake gun with you. Ten minutes to walk around the roof and then we're going back in. Understand?" They nod and Castiel slips his mask over his face, jerking his head towards the door to get them to start moving. Five minutes later, all the hostages who wanted to go to the roof are milling about, talking or just basking in the sunlight. It's relaxing, actually, and Castiel is sure that Salem appreciates the moment of tranquillity.
i don't say it often, i hate getting all serious, but you've been nicer to cas and i way more than i'd have thought you'd be
“Bingo.” Dean closes the door behind him and takes a seat at the table, looking back up at Cas. “I’m officially legally dead again. Roman handled the documents, said I overdosed on Alastair’s heroin. His people snuck me out of the prison and we paid off someone at the hospital to fake the autopsy records.”
“Then I’ll see you when I do,” Michael says, kissing Adam once before he leaves the med bay with a newfound loss of trust in Kansas—
He leaves the tent to call Dean as soon as he knows his absence won't be noted, waiting impatiently for the firewalls to pass.
"Lie down on the floor, please. Berlin will search you now," Castiel says, gesturing to Crowley who had his mask off. The three of them lie down on the floor as Crowley scans them with a metal detector. Meanwhile, Salem and London work on getting the microphone off of Sam's glasses. London drills as small a hole as she can and Salem slips the tiny microphone into the glasses' hinge. They make quick work of covering up the hole and repainting over it, making it look like there was no bug implanted into it.
"I got shot and then almost died. Why would I want to go back in there?" Dean challenges. He looks over at Adam and says, "I'll go back in if you free my brother."
"Hold off," Dean answers. "We need to keep them in the dark until we've gotten the vaults and safes cracked." Crowley nods and goes to grab a bulletproof vest. After what happened before, Dean decided that they and the hostages will wear Kevlar vests the whole time. They had more than enough money to stock up. He shifts back to Cas's side. "Are you okay?"
Dean nods and turns away to leave the room, ready to give up on his hopes of Cas returning, and then:
Who am I kidding? You’ve made me this sappy mess since we met and I’m not complaining. I love you. I really do. I don’t think I’ll love anyone more than I
Cas and Rowena look up at him and Cas squints at him, trying to understand. “What do you mean ‘no’?”
Cas leans against the doorway, glancing over the empty space thoughtfully, and asks, “Are you ready?”
"Hey, we need to do work," Cas says. When Dean pouts at him, Cas points out, "Don't look at me like that.
Cas shrugs, the argument seeming redundant and a little silly now after witnessing both Michael and Dean getting shot and almost dying. "Okay, that was on us. What were your orders?"
"Be grateful he got you something. You didn't even have to attend the lunch," Castiel rolls his eyes, organizing the polaroids into a small stack. He places it neatly on Dean's desk and says, "Pass these to Rowena, she'll handle it. I have to go now to see the designers but you may go off after handling the polaroids, I don't have much other business but I'll call if I need you."
Bobby puts down the pie and rushes over, asking him what's wrong. Sam reaches a tiny hand out to Dean and Ellen brings him closer. When he's in touching distance, Sam's hand brushes across Dean's hair, and he mumbles, "Don't cry."
Before Detroit can answer, Cas hears glass shattering, shards splintering past Detroit as his spare hand grabs his chest where the lungs are. Detroit drops the phone just as his own body hits the ground and Cas can't believe the cops have gotten to
Sam and Adam materialise outside a sandbox with a sigil drawn in it. Sam messes up the sand with his shoe to render the portal unusable. In Adam’s hand is a bottle of grace.
"What were you talking about?" Sam asks, deciding to stay at the doorway as opposed to going into the kitchen.
Dean didn’t get much sleep last night. He’d stayed up trying to think of a plan like Anael asked him to.
“I have faith, but not as much as some others,” Anna answers. She walks into the chapel with Cas and says, “Well, if there’s nothing else, I’ll leave you be. There’s signs on the ceiling if you want to find your way around, but I’ll be directly upstairs if you need me.”
Mick stands near the partition when he sees Ketch and Naomi going to see Adam once more. He thinks they're going to try their hand again but Ketch says, "We're bringing you outside."
Dean nods, considering the situation. He’s slightly concerned about Michael’s loyalties. Dean watches him carefully for an answer as he says:
Castiel relents and doesn't push that anymore but admits, "Dean asked me to make sure you wouldn't try to go out on your own."
“Stop it,” Michael mutters. Changing the subject, he asks, “When do you think we’re leaving the Factory?”
"Other than her being sent off to court hours ago, complete radio silence," Jody notifies, shaking her head. "They should be arriving at court by now."
Sam holds out an arm, opening a space in the hug. "Come here, Cas." Cas laughs and walks over, letting Sam pull them into a tight hug.
"Then you'll want to leak some information about them to us," Zachariah says, moving closer. With the revelation last night that Kansas is not Adam Milligan but Dean, Sam wondered if Meg knew he found out who Kansas is. Why would they throw someone out if she could destroy the whole operation?
“It’s okay, asshole,” Dean replies, revelling in the fact that Cas just let him get away with calling him names. “Water under the bridge. Just... don’t do it again.”
Cas puts his hand on Dean’s back and gives him an affirming nod, “You worked hard on this, I’m proud of you.”
"I don't know," Dean says, defeated. "The only thing I know is that I love him and I want him back more than anything."
"I'll have you back by today," Dean promises. "Just tell them you'll only testify today in court. I'll do the rest."
“You’ve thought of everything,” Detroit says, impressed. “Adam and Moore’s safety, the encryption...”
“Dude, folding just leaves creases. No,” Dean says. “But hang the branded stuff first then jackets and shirts. If I run out of hangers, fold the cheap shirts and pants.”
Ten minutes later, Sam looks at the news and sees Crowley's mugshot with the headline 'HUMAN TRAFFICKER'.
Cas emerges from the room in hotel slippers, the envelope mid-layer and a pair of sweatpants the hotel provided. He's wearing
Cas puts Dean’s coffee down on his desk, with Dean already having placed his coffee on his office desk earlier on, and asks, “Yes, Dean?”
“He actually liked the date. Forgot all about the girl and wanted the boy to go out with him again,” Castiel replies. The doors shut when Dean is in the elevator and it starts moving. "I don't think they ever made it official, though."
“God, I forgot how bad the sleep was in here,” Gabriel mutters, already rummaging for his morning supplies. “Did you get any rest?”
Dean's about to answer when Cas does it for him, flashing a smile as he says, "Nope. Welcome back to New York, Sam."
"I have known you for a whole year. I know you well enough by now. Something's wrong. What?" Angeles presses. Dean is about to say that it won't affect him or the heist and Angeles sees it coming, adding, "Don't say that it won't deter the plan. You could be lying."
Cas blinks, smile freezing slightly since he got caught off-guard, but it eases up when he clarifies, “Tonight?”
“Dorothy Baum, she’s a retail store manager for Bvlgari. She used to be the marketing director from Oz Magazine,” Charlie answers. “She’s really hot.”
"Where do you want these?" Cas asks, holding up a stack of cooking books that he'd piled from the now-empty bookshelf.
He gives him a lazy grin, "Yep. Name's Gabriel. I don't really care about the city name thing. I joined late so what's the point?"
Missouri nods along, seemingly understanding and gaining a new perspective with the interview. Dean tilts his head towards the doorway and Crowley says, "It's time to see you out. But we have a request for you."
"I wanted a bigger cut of the money. They weren't all that jazzed about the idea and threw me out," Meg says, rolling her eyes. "Can you blame me? That's a lot of fucking money."
“Maybe one good thing happened.” Cas shrugs. “But Kansas is better off in storage.” Cas pulls the mask off to see Dean’s soft smile. “Or two. I like Dean better.”
"Would he have been okay with that? You didn't even ask him," Meg points out, argumentative and riled up.
. You think they care about the specifics?" Meg asks, unimpressed. "A pig's a pig to them. And to me."
"Hey, Sam," Adam greets and Sam smiles tightly, stepping aside to let him in. Adam looks around the mostly empty apartment and his face begins to fall, realising something is deeply wrong, "Did you just move in or what?"
A sinking feeling makes itself known in Dean’s chest but he tries to ignore it, replying, “Yeah, he. Castiel. Why?”
Dean is also a walking contradiction; while he no longer wants to take shit from people, he also thought that he deserved it. It sticks with him until he's all grown up, and it continues to stick with him then. It makes him feel like shit, and he never wants Sam to feel like this. He spends Sam's entire childhood convincing him that he's worth everything in the universe and that he is loved by many, and that he
"Orders from above, it's out of my control," Zachariah responds, raising his hands in surrender. Sam drags him out of the tent to talk in private and once they stop walking, Zachariah adds, "The president's son is in there. If we don't storm the bank and get him out by tonight, tomorrow the whole world will know. They'll think that America can't even handle a bank holdup. Interior wants us to go in by force and get Jack Kline and the governor to safety. And they might not even be aware that Jack is in there. Every moment he's in there, he risks being discovered by them and becoming their target."
Angeles raises an eyebrow and it's like his blue eyes reflect the cigarette's smouldering end. "I thought you said no personal information. You didn't even let us share names. I had to use
Dean cleans up Cas’s room, picking up things that are out of place and putting them back where they should be before he walks out.
Meg lays out a few blueprints and notes on the table, smoothing them out with her hands as she explains, “I went back to the house we studied at to pick up something I forgot, and I found these in Crowley’s room.” She steps back to let Dean and Cas look the papers over and declares, “He and Bela were planning a heist in the United Kingdom. They were going to do it on the Hatton Garden but after Crowley’s heist on it, the UK security industry boosted defences. What worked then wouldn’t work now, so they switched targets.” She leans forward and sifts through the papers to pull one out from the bottom, smacking it down on top, giving them a complete view of the blueprint. “The Diamonds Factory.”
"Dean Winchester," Castiel echoes, his voice something small and open like the heart of any great love story, and it's like it spreads warmth in Dean's chest where it has been cold for years, the sound of his name in Castiel's voice thrumming deep in his heart where loneliness used to be. "You know, Balthazar guessed that your name was Dean."
Angeles nods and hangs up, turning to them, "Get London --" Before he finishes talking, London is at the doorway with her rifle raised, mask pushed up into her hair.
"Inspector Naomi Intel, and a British man that I don't know," Abaddon mutters into the microphone before leaning back into her chair, her wrists still bound by her handcuffs. "I gave them both a bullet to their heads."
"Yeah, can I talk to you outside?" Dean asks, using his thumb to point over his shoulder. Frowning in thought, Cas nods and leaves Gabriel and Michael to continue talking among themselves as he joins Dean in the hallway. Dean moves them into the office across the hallway and once they're alone, out of Michael and Gabriel's earshot, he says, "I need to tell you something but you gotta promise you won't overreact."
Over the past four months, Dean’s profile has garnered a steady rise in following, and he’s close to 5000 followers. Apparently, they think he’s “super sexy”, he’s a funny guy and his fashion sense is impeccable. All of which he knows, so his following feels deserved. Plus, at least half his following are Castiel’s own fans wanting to catch glimpses of Castiel on his page, but Dean has no idea how to tell his boss that his followers want to see his handsome face. He does take photos with Anna, Gabriel, Kevin, Pamela, Rowena, and Charlie most of the time, and occasionally Meg, Balthazar, and Missouri. Even Crowley and Bela took a photo with him once.
"Everyone has something to lose," Naomi remarks, daring. "It's just a matter of how long until we find that for you."
“Adam will come around eventually,” Cas assures. “He's protective, of course, so I think it's just his rage speaking right now. Once this is over, he'll be back to normal. And for Michael, you couldn't have expected Lilith's madness. It's not your fault and since he's not here anymore, she's the least of your worries now."
Dorothy answers, "Out like a baby. He'll probably wake up again late at night or tomorrow. We three agreed to take turns watching him for the night in case he wakes up."
“Yes,” Michael answers, picking up some books off the coffee table so Dean can put his mug down. The books are mostly about business. At Dean’s interested look, Michael explains, “I’ve been thinking about starting a business. I don’t really know what I’ll do yet so I’ve been reading up.”
I just don’t want him to think this is all there is? I know, I know. I don’t have the right to tell him what to do or think or feel or whatever. He’s mad at me, I know he is, but I couldn’t stop going on and on.
