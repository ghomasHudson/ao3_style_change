Alex wasn’t looking at her, but Claire could tell she was beginning to cry.
Dean’s thoughts went back to near silence, and Castiel felt frustrated. Had Dean already learned how to shut him out of his thoughts?
“You’re up Bear,” Castiel told her.
'I've heard rumours. I don't know which story she'll have to deal with, however.'
“Yeah. Thanks. You got everything you need for Amelia?”
“Yes,” she said weakly.
“Yeah, well, live is always different. And tapes can warp, and stuff. It was still good.”
“Thought you were flying in.” Castiel breathed when they broke away for air. Dean cringed.
“Thanks. How’ve you been?”
Sorry I haven't updated this as quickly as the other chapters. I've had a few extra hours at work, I haven't fully recovered from my walk across London, we started our sale and I've had a few personal issues. I've only been able to write today, my first real day off in aaaaages!
“Okay. So, let me know when you’re caught up and we can do the pizza and movie thing?”
“Oh good, Jack, you’re here. Let’s go sit in the kitchen. Did you want some iced tea?”
Castiel peered at him from the covers.
She sheathed the machete then grabbed his hand, and tugged him out of the room, back down the passageway and through a fire escape, sliding down the metal railings and jumping at the end of the ladder, landing lightly on her feet. She looked up, and saw Dax clinging onto the end of the ladder, peeking down over his shoulder and squinting through his thick-framed square glasses.
'Thank you for reminding me that I will be a teen mom, Gabe. It's what I needed to hear.' Faith sighed. So much for having a heart-to-heart with her angelic uncle. Castiel squeezed her gently, just for a moment, and Faith smiled despite herself. 'Gabe? Can I talk with my mom? Alone? Like, stop listening in too, jackass?'
There was a loaded pause, which Balthazar broke.
Dean’s whole body relaxed as he grinned.
“Well, as I recall, it swiftly became a conversation between you and Claire about underwear.”
“Stay safe!” He called back. Safety wasn’t the issue for Claire. Jack didn’t let go of her hand as they walked around the park, looking for the entrances to water chutes and queuing with the other guests. He only let go when they got to the front of the queue, and her hand felt cold and tingly without his there too. They stepped up to chutes side by side and waited for the signal to go.
'Kid, I'm sorry, there's no way you have any kind of authority that would make anyone listen to you.'
“This is what you want, Cas? This level of physicality?”
'You would still call me that. I go by many names, Dean.'
“It was a dumb fight, and we are making up. But I just want to be friends.”
Castiel felt bashful, but pleased that their conversation was flowing at least as well as their texts. He curled into Dean’s arms.
“Fine.”
“But Mom took him in, said he could stay. And just as we got used to having Adam around, Charlie shows up. Her mom’s sick, she’s been sent to live with her dad. Except her dad’s dead, so we’re all she’s got. And Mom took her in too, but I could see it was starting to get to her. One affair she could forgive, but two?”
Dean began toying with a bunch of grapes, focusing on the full weight of their ripeness, the dusty texture of their skin. Looking at Castiel felt too hard now.
“Yeah. Let’s go up there and talk to Gabriel. Tell him that he can’t force your Grace on you if you don’t want it, and he should shove it up his ass.”
Michael laughed nervously.
She blinked innocently up at him, daring him to mention where Dean Winchester was. Apparently Mr Winchester didn’t break that easily, or help with the gossip that much.
They finally stopped kissing, and leaned their foreheads against each other, whispering just out of hearing. Claire knew what they were saying though, she knew Castiel wouldn’t be able to stop himself telling Dean how he had missed him, how empty the apartment had seemed without him. And she had no doubts that Dean would be doing the same thing. She had missed Dean too, the way they riffed off each other, the fact he was actually an amazing cook, the amount of respect he was trying to give her … but maybe their separation had been a good thing, maybe it had answered all of her father’s doubts.
“Your choice only goes so far,” their comrade said. “And a few of the men are interested in you.”
Castiel couldn’t believe that Becky could keep a secret from Sam. She seemed to have mind-reading capabilities of her own.
“I can’t sing,” he growled into the microphone, but Jody and Donna squealed like fangirls anyway. Dean grinned at Castiel, who looked at his microphone warily, before “I’m too sexy” began to play. Dean did his best to get into it, making up for his lack of musical prowess by being energetic with the dancing and acting to the words. He even started taking his shirt off at one point, making Castiel laugh and Donna squeal again. The song ended and he tried to claim his shirt back from Donna, who laughed and ran off. Castiel stopped him from chasing after her, and undid his own shirt, revealing a white tee underneath and offering Dean the formal shirt. He took it, and buttoned it up to catcalls from Jody. The material was tight on his muscles, but it smelled of sandalwood and pepper and somehow of watermelon too. He wanted to get closer to Castiel, to see if the smell was all over him, but Castiel was heading out of the room, back to the kitchen. Dean followed, almost bloody-minded in his pursuit.
“Sorry, I had a … well, a pretty awesome night last night.”
“Him? You telling me it was Sammy’s idea to play baseball by my truck with a wrench? Boy, you were lucky you saw another day.” Bobby scratched at his beard. “I only took pity on you because you peed your pants when you looked at me.”
“Charlie filled me in on that part. We made out?”
Gabriel climbed out of his seat and began pacing as he talked. Castiel watched him with every step, feeling increasingly frustrated with his brother.
Dean chuckled quietly, squeezing her tightly, and nuzzling his head against hers, feeling a lump forming in his throat as her wings surrounded them, like the first day she had them when she was protecting him from the rain she had created. It was crazy how easily she'd accepted that they were related, how happily she'd accepted Dean back into her life. Dean had thought, if they had ever seen her again, that she would gravitate towards Castiel, and look down on Dean and his drunken ways with an undisguised, disgusted pity. Maybe growing up in the orphanage had made her feel like Dean and his problems were more relatable that Castiel, who seemed to have issued orders for her without any bonding. Dean was going to have to talk to Castiel long and hard about that, but for now, he was concentrating on his girl.
He nodded.
“Not one. I had thought you had read them all, that you were upset with me during our time apart. But your reactions to me and then finding this box gave me my answer. But they’re your letters. I’ll give you the letters between Amelia and myself another time.”
“Men of Letters bunker. Grampa Winchester was a MOL, Sam and I kind of inherited the place. You’ll love it, Mom. It’s warded like crazy, and there’s information on all kinds of creatures. There’s an eight-hundred page study on transexual werewolves somewhere.”
“There’s a trash can in there too. For the condom.”
'Is that Dean and that girl? Flying? What the hell did I miss last night?'
The Friday after Monopoly gate, once they had finished homework and were watching dumb YouTube videos, Jody knocked on Alex’s bedroom door, and stuck her head in.
“Whatever, don’t strain yourself.”
“And my truth is that I’m in love with Castiel.”
“Thanks.”
“Thanks.”
“I’m sorry, Dean.”
'And my friend isn't enough?' Dax buried his head back into the book, and Faith sighed, letting the argument go.
“Food’s up!” He passed burger joint bags around, and Faith left Junior alone to grab a handful of fries, barely stopping to chew as she devoured them. Dean made his way in between them to eat his burger, and Faith had to shuffle along the seat in order to avoid the baby being squashed. She sent an apologetic look to Junior, who waved his hand back at her as though he were dismissing her silent concerns, and they both turned back to their own greasy, salt-laden meals.
“The flutes.”
Chuck stepped forward to interrupt whatever Gabriel was doing to the grill, and Castiel took Dean aside.
It seemed to take an age for the words to penetrate Jack’s understanding. He slowly let go of her, shifting on the sofa until there was a safe distance between them. Claire couldn’t stop watching his face, as he seemed to think of a thousand different things to say before discarding them.
Claire smirked, and bit into a fry, raising her eyebrows at Alex.
They pulled away eventually, though Castiel was dreading it. He didn’t want to return to the real world, he wanted to stay in this one where Dean was his. He didn’t want the awkward conversation that would follow.
“You know what, Cas?” Dean finally put the pencil he was toying with away, and glared in his direction. “If you had just said you liked me and wanted a date, if you had explained that we’d have to spend some time with your family but we’d have time to ourselves too? I would have said yes. I would have said it a lot faster. I told you I fall fast and hard, that I had for you. I liked you from the moment you saw through all the bullshit and joked that I would end up selling you my soldering iron.”
“So, you’re not worried that I’m going to start wiping your memory again?”
"Said it to your face before!" Dean called back. He lowered his voice again. "Seriously, Princess. Between Junior and Dax, if you have to be with a guy? I'd pick Junior."
Castiel wasn’t sure whether Dean was joking about stealing the chair. He knew Sam was the brother, from Dean’s previous messages, but he wasn’t sure about the sister. He wanted to know everything. He wanted to be introduced to them, as Dean’s boyfriend. He wanted a hell of a lot of things that he was just going to have to pace himself for.
She left them alone, and Castiel looked away from Dean like he was blinded. How did he allow his assistant to talk to him like that? Not that Dean had to be a tyrant, but she seemed really unprofessional. And now Castiel was left alone in a room with the man he had been fantasising about for months, and he could feel the panic rising again. He looked at the cog piece, and tried to centre himself. The cogs seemed to move again, to spin with a speed that made him feel dizzy. He reached out a hand, trying to see if it was really moving or all in his head-
Chuck gave his son a nervous look, but Castiel’s smile didn’t falter.
'Kinda.'
Faith struggled out of Castiel's arms, and ran from the room, crying once more. Dean looked pointedly at Castiel, who sighed and lowered his head.
Could Dean be any less perfect?
They broke up the hug before too long, though Castiel and Dean still stood with their arms around her, and Claire checked her face quickly to make sure nothing had smudged on Dean’s jacket as Sam reminded them of the time. They went down to the rehearsal dinner as a group, quickly going through what was going to happen the next morning before heading to where their guests were already seated, ready to eat. They cheered as Castiel and Dean came in, and Claire followed them both to their seats, finding her name between Jack and Eileen, her father and Dean further along. Dinner was served, and everyone fell into excitable chatter, and Jack started touching the charms on Claire’s bracelet.
“Is there anything you need to tell me about my statue?”
Dean moped around their little grove. He barely acknowledged the bees, barely raised his head when Aristaeus and Apollo visited. He barely spoke to Castiel either.
“Dean has been talking about his bachelors, he wants to do something with his brother and work friends. And he asked what I was thinking for mine and, well, I’d like to do something with the two of you. If that’s okay? Just the three of us? Before our little family grows.”
“I know,” he shot her a small wistful smile. “Dean and I wanted discretion. Your relationship with Alex is new, as is your understanding of your own identity. It makes it complicated to explain that of course you’re not having an affair with your principal when you have a girlfriend, I’m his boyfriend, and you have no desire for a physical relationship.”
“Is your name really Castiel?”
“Ahem. Last night?”
He didn't see the point in the pretence. Faith had this uncanny knack of knowing what a person was thinking within moments of meeting them. Dax had long since given up understanding why she still interacted with witnesses and officials when she could easily pick their brains. She had told him once that it was about building trust with the locals, obtaining information about the case that could only come from trust.
Dean seemed to hold his breath as he looked at Castiel.
“Um, no, Kaia’s got a point. Sharing a bed might be a bit much for me. Your dress is done.” Alex stepped away, and Claire nodded to the bed her father had slept in the night before, since she had slept more in that bed than the other. Kaia jumped on it, as Claire retrieved her own pyjamas, and Alex headed to the bed Patience perched on. Once Claire changed, Kaia started taking her hair out of the elaborate updo that she had put in that morning. Claire sat as still as possible, wiping off her make up.
Sam flexed a little, as though he were debating if the answer were good enough, and Dean pushed forward, past his brother. He took Castiel by the elbow and pulled him away from the house before there was any more interrogation. Castiel nearly stumbled, he was so surprised, and his concentration was split between staying upright, and Dean’s hand on his arm.
She thought she had fooled them both. They were talking more freely than she had heard them in a while. She could practically feel Castiel probing at her conscience.
“Oh.”
But then Castiel was taking control, rolling him back over, using his thighs to separate Dean’s with a strength that belied his small frame. Dean let him take control, tilting his head back and panting uncontrollably. Castiel instantly started sucking on his neck, biting down, forcing groans out of his erastes. Dean was clinging onto his lover so tightly that his fingertips were buried in Castiel’s backside. They were rutting together, Castiel’s fingers were grazing against his balls, teasing around his hole, and he was hardly aware of it as he pulled Castiel closer and closer. Their lips met again, though their kisses were so overblown with passion that they could barely do more than pant into each other’s mouth, teeth clashing together as they ground out groans simultaneously.
Dean merely stared at Castiel, trying to understand what his lover was getting at, what advantage helping the god of the dead would do, how it could be considered a task to raise a garden and communicate with the creatures of the underworld. He didn’t want to voice his doubt, but Castiel seemed to understand.
'Isn't this guy your boyfriend?'
'Faith, Dax, this is my friend, Sam Winchester. One of the best hunters you'll ever meet. Sam, this is my friend Faith, and her boyfriend, Dax.'
“Wow, your house is huge!” Alfie said appreciatively.
'No, you're Faith. Remember that. But yes, you have things in common with Mary.'
Her voice was harsh, and rasping, and Castiel gripped Sam's arm tightly.
Claire frowned, just for a moment, and Sam clarified.
“It’s fine, Dean.”
The whispers were building up behind Claire, and she could feel a nervous fluttering in her chest, like she could feel the build up of what was coming.
Edith was talking about the upcoming award she had arranged. It was in its fourth year, but it had already become prestigious in the art world. The winners had become successful and world renown. Castiel loved that end of being on the board, knowing that he had a hand in making someone’s life better. He wasn’t boastful about it, but he had voted for every winner so far. He just hadn’t nominated a winner yet.
“I don’t want you to get burned.”
The town was one of those quaint little ones, full of rustic style stores and throwbacks to the fifties, like her dad’s book store. Which meant that there was nothing good to do when you were nearly sixteen and unable to drive and living downtown over a store. Claire found her way to a cheesy retro diner, and once she established that her dad wasn’t in there, went inside and ordered a burger and curly fries with a chocolate shake. Her food had just arrived and she was taking a huge bite out of her burger when Alex walked in with a couple of other popular kids. She groaned internally and focused back on her meal, hoping they didn’t see her, or try to talk to her. She was officially done with people.
'Sure, I'll look for the photographs.'
They had searched for about ten minutes after they finished eating before Claire found something she would agree to, and though Castiel clearly wasn’t enthusiastic for it, he agreed without hesitation. They drove to the next town and Castiel paid for them both to enter.
“Is he like you, this brother of yours?”
'Dax, shut up,' Faith growled tightly. He was expressing all her worries, making them seem worse as he vocalised them. And there were other things she wanted to address. Namely, how all of a sudden, everyone in their lives seemed to be connected. Krissy was friends with a guy who knew Gabriel? They both knew this mysterious Castiel? She was beginning to have some huge misgivings about the life they were trying to carve for themselves, or at least, misgivings about everything she had previously known. Did Gabriel know the truth about her past? Did the enigmatic Castiel? If she had stuck around, admitted to Sam everything she could do - even the stuff Dax didn't know - could he have helped her, rather than hunted her? Was that what his thoughts had meant?
Castiel really didn’t want to see his brothers any more for the evening, but he did want to spend time with Dean. Dean who seemed agreeable, and relieved himself. Maybe he wasn’t a stooge of Michael’s, after all.
“Nope, I have a rule about that in my bedroom,” Castiel said nonchalantly. “No pussies.”
“It’s weird, saying goodbye again.”
A few moments later, her principal was in the room too, looking Castiel up and down. Claire ignored the way they were eyeballing each other for the real issue.
“Why are you saying this to me?” She asked tiredly. He kept stroking her cheek.
'He's alive,' Gabriel said quietly. Faith buried herself into her father's arms, trying to block out the conversation. 'He'll need a couple of days to rest though. We need to find somewhere to keep him safe.'
There was a silence in the room, as Sam and Becky both processed what Castiel was telling them. Castiel could hear the hum of the fluorescent light above them as they tried to understand.
“Not unless you wanted it.”
“Okay. You know who Cas was talking to when you got here? Charlie didn’t want to let me in and that’s not normal for her. I’m like a big brother to her, she normally tells me way too much.”
“You don’t need any champagne,” Dean chuckled. Castiel sat up and reached for the champagne flutes, passing one over to Dean.
“And?”
“May I talk with you?”
“I suppose you have to do your assignments until they let you back into school. I’ll try and get in contact with Dean and see where we can possibly go from here.”
Castiel was sick of sitting, watching Dean lay there and do nothing. He felt an itching need to do something, anything to stop himself from going crazy. He tried to summon Gabriel down into the bunker, knowing that it would probably be no use. He even considered calling Sam, asking for his help, but he couldn’t think what to say to the taller Hunter about the choice Dean had made, the rash decision to change his entire being. He started pacing around the room, trying to keep his thoughts on track, knowing there was no real way of making a decision while Dean was in his feathered cage.
They walked out of the room together, but Patience kept pace as Kaia spotted them down the hall and hurried to join them. They immediately began talking as if they were old friends, and Claire traded a look with Alex. She mouthed ‘what the hell?’ and Alex shrugged, looking just as perplexed. It had been the two of them for months, even when they weren’t dating, and to suddenly have two people attach themselves to them felt odd. Claire liked their bubble.
“No. Like I said, she’s your friend, that would make things awkward for you. You’re my favourite person too. I wouldn’t do anything that I thought would hurt you.”
Eventually, their kisses petered out, and Castiel lay back on the cushions beside Dean, closing his eyes and tilting his head in the direction of the sunbeam they were laying in. Dean sat up slightly, propping his head up as he leaned towards Castiel.
“Good. Um, is Claire here?”
“Somewhere you can relax. We’ve taken care of everything.” Michael reassured him, accepting a drink of his own. Castiel gripped his glass with both hands and sipped, before pushing the glass away abruptly. Balthazar raised an eyebrow at him, but he looked out of the window rather than respond. It tasted of the alcohol that Dean had been drinking at the auction, and there were already enough bad memories of that evening without the aid.
“It’s known as that.” Castiel felt like crying, having to have this conversation with him. “I feel so awful, Dean. And I realised too late that you were acting out of character. At first it was wonderful, we were joking about one of the lots, a weekend in Paris, and you tried to show off what French you knew and then we were kissing. But when they announced the winners,” Castiel sighed.
“I think we should make a toast,” he said. “To us.”
“No, they say it behind my back.”
“It’s Michael’s account. He’s CEO.”
“Yep, we’re making dinner!” She crowed happily. Ben started taking bacon back off her pizza base, and Dean stepped in again, Castiel appreciating that despite his clear frustration, he was still good with the two of them.
Castiel went quiet, processing this, then he pointed.
“Because you cared, I cared.”
“Yes,” they chorused, before Alex asked his opinion.
'Dax-'
“There’s no Sam here.”
“Are you angry with us?”
“Okay.”
“I interrupted your meal, I’m sorry. For what it’s worth? I don’t think Subway would let you get away with hijacking their brand.”
“You’re trouble,” Claire grinned. “I love it.”
He should always do the side parting. Or maybe not, because then Castiel would not stop himself from accosting him.
They had agreed to swap their financial information with the intention of merging their individual fortunes eventually. Castiel had given her his information straight away, but he was still waiting for her to do the same. She made the excuse that she needed confirmation from her accountant, but Castiel wasn’t waiting on tenterhooks for it. He knew Meg well enough to know it would happen eventually.
“I have some classes to catch up on,” she mumbled, and made to turn away. He caught her shoulder gently, the heat of his palm burning through the cotton of her shirt.
That … doesn’t make any sense. None of this makes any sense.
“It’s not funny.” Alex’s voice was clipped.
“My best friend, Alex. That’s her foster family. They’re kinda busy right now. Alex is really cool though.”
'And you, Dexter, you should be worried. Because when we kill? The thing stays dead.'
'Where the hell are they?' Dean eventually growled, slamming the drawer shut. 'They were in there!'
Dean didn’t look convinced.
“I will not hurt you. If you had not fought me, you would have seen what I am prepared to do, but the moment I saw you when I arrived here earlier, I could feel it. I could sense it. You and I are meant to be something very special.”
And Castiel was fine with her hanging around Jody’s house to work on homework. She and Alex would hole up together in Alex’s room, play music and work on assignments together. Claire was slowly learning how Alex came to be with Jody during this time, but she never asked questions. Alex would tell her when she was ready.
School had changed slightly, the few days after Dean and Castiel’s second date. Alex had been true to her word and had kept her mouth shut about the whole situation, and Claire hadn’t been bothered by the other kids. Her teachers were still being lenient on her, Dean still wanted to check up on her regularly. All this was the same as before. It was Alex herself who was the change. She greeted Claire by her locker on the way in to school, chattering away about what else they could do for Mr Singer’s history project and hey, wasn’t Claire in Fitzgerald’s math class too? She followed Claire to lessons, and when they had class together, insisted on sitting next to her. It was a little unnerving. She insisted on sitting with Claire at lunch too, all her popular friends joining them and ruining Claire’s peace. And after school, she kept suggesting things they could do together.
“It’s good of the school to do that,” Castiel offered. “What kind of concerns do you mean?”
Castiel read on the flight home, and Claire tucked herself under his arm, thinking about their second visit to her grandparents. Castiel had stayed outside that time, and Claire had put it to her grandparents that, though she did miss them and loved them a lot, she had wanted her father back in her life for a long time and now that she had that opportunity, she didn’t want to waste it. They didn’t seem to understand her thinking, but she thought they had given her their blessing, and they had promised to come and visit Sioux Falls too. It wasn’t an ideal solution, but it was the one that they could make work.
'No you weren't. You see what you're expecting. You know who He is, and this is where he's familiar to you.'
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. I don’t think so.”
Alex just stared at her.
Dean zapped in on top of Castiel, straddling him, a mischievous look on his face.
'Sam Winchester,' Sam babbled instantly, almost falling into a kneeling position. 'And you're Cassidy, and this is the angel Castiel-'
“Yeah, well, I haven’t had pancakes in forever.”
“You know how I feel, Cas. You’ve always known. Just admit you were being selfish.”
“I can’t give you my real answer, Claire’s in hearing distance.”
“That’s what I meant.”
Claire checked herself. She wasn’t feeling as bad as she had that time she had stayed home, finding out about her own orientation. She could taste from the tension in the air between them that Alex wasn’t asking for a peck on the lips, the most they had managed so far. But she didn’t want to promise anything she couldn’t deliver.
“Did he?”
“No. Charlie’s going to close the store, it’s the weekend. I’ve asked Charlie to watch the store tomorrow as well. I think you and I need to go somewhere. Just us. And it will give Alex and Dean the time they need also.”
“But I’m still getting married.” Castiel pointed out. It still felt inevitable. But God, it would be so much easier to be getting ready to marry Dean. And there was no point in calling off the wedding unless he and Dean were a sure thing.
Castiel smiled, but obliged, leaving the house and walking up to the car, knocking on the window and making Kevin jump. Kevin who had been listening to music and typing something into his phone.
“Looking for you. Want to feed the ducks?”
“Not you and me. Claire has a date. Are you staying at Alex’s house afterwards?”
“Probably about Dean’s wedding ring he’s been hiding in his pants whenever any of us are around. Like we’re not going to notice.”
“It won’t be long, Dean.”
Chuck eyed him hesitantly, not quite making eye contact.
Claire sighed heavily.
His fingers were rough and calloused, and added an edge to the sensation when he caressed the tip of Dean’s cock. He groaned loudly into Castiel’s kiss, his knees starting to buckle. He was only upright now because of Castiel’s hips pressing him against the door, his hands above his head. And Castiel kept up the onslaught, kissing him hard, his fingers trailing down Dean’s shaft almost lazily before grabbing a firm hold and pumping in time with the thrust of his hips.
“Will you please stop calling this our duty?” Castiel complained as she pulled a tie around his neck and began a double windsor knot.
Her dad’s voice made her jump, and drop the journal. Dean picked it up, chuckling.
Castiel felt conflicted. He wanted to say yes, to make sure Dean was taken care of until he walked through his front door, but he was an adult and Castiel had asked for discretion. He didn’t know what Dean’s siblings knew of their arrangements.
“Everyone keeps making these stupid comments because they saw Mr Winchester give me a ride. It was pissing me off and I just wanted to be alone. So I got my lunch and I was going to the benches outside and ran into that guy. It would’ve been cool except for all those stupid comments and weird looks I’d had all day. I was at the end of my patience, it was just bad timing.”
Dean didn’t answer immediately, and Castiel continued running his fingers through his hair, making himself wait, enjoying the way Dean bent into his touch.
“Hey! Potential buyer.”
'That sounds delicious, sir.'
'You know,' he stated, changing the subject. 'I worked out why she calls herself Faith these days.'
“I know all this. That’s why I check whether it’s okay.”
“This is the weakest part. Let Michael know. One of the cogs makes it difficult to strengthen it properly and if that spoke gets damaged, you’ve just got a mass of scrap metal scratching up your floor.”
“More than okay,” Dean gasped. Castiel eased himself inside Dean, still slowly jerking him off, and Dean’s nails began to bite into Castiel’s thighs as he was filled up. It was silky, and thick, and took an age to hit that wonderful spot. Dean spasmed, already feeling the orgasm building inside him. He pushed down, trying to fill himself completely with Castiel, and once he got to the end of Castiel’s length, started raising back up.
Castiel merely walked away.
It was a woman talking to him, a woman with a voice Claire recognised but couldn’t place. She stopped just before the stairwell and listened.
“She’s worried about you.”
“Hey, everything okay?” Kevin asked. Castiel nodded.
“I’ll ask Sam if there’s anything we can do.” He said quietly.
“Hey,” she tried to sound nonchalant.
'Did you take that one, Dean?'
“Actually, I’m not. But I’m still not okay with him doing it. I’m here with you.”
'Faith?'
“I’ll call you when we’re about to fly back, maybe we can see each other then?”
Claire followed her father out of the door, and they walked together to her locker.
“I hope you’re right.”
“I was trying to protect her, Dean. I liked her.”
“Dean said wants to head home with them. I’ll offer it again, if you want?”
“Yeah! I guess we’re not so cursed after all.”
'Maybe you should just say what Sam wants you to say, Dax.'
“To bed. She said she couldn’t live with the humiliation of finally losing a round of Jenga. Kevin fell asleep a moment ago. I was hoping that maybe we could talk now.”
Castiel submitted to more kisses, lazy languid ones where they spent their time exploring each other’s mouths, laying in the golden sunlight and bathing in the warmth of the day. Dean could feel his heart thudding twice as hard as normal, and all he wanted was to get rid of their clothes and fully indulge. Castiel still seemed in no hurry to speed up the action between them, as though he were just grateful to have this amount of attention from Dean.
'What did you do to me?' She sobbed from the floor. Dean laid on the floor so that his head was near hers, and he stroked her hair gently.
'So, some Bible story says you're not meant to exist?' Junior tried again.
“Dean? If you’re going out with this guy, should you both be drinking? Who’s driving?” Sam asked, his voice full of concern.
Faith stopped walking, and glared at his silhouette, and he winced, knowing he could never lie to his daughter, not properly.
I know, this chapter is a bit shorter than the others, I'm sorry!
Patience sat her down and started working on her make up as Kaia started brushing her hair, sectioning parts off and tying others. Claire closed her eyes, and felt Alex tug at her hand before applying nail polish.
“Because she takes all my cool stuff.” A girl opened the door to complain, then spotted Castiel on Dean’s screen. “Is that the guy you met in Vegas?”
“You confuse me frequently, Dean, but not as much as right now.”
“Were you two making out at the game on Friday?” The tall, gangly looking one asked.
'Come on!' She called. Gabriel gave her a tight smile, muttered something she couldn't pick up at Junior, and materialised by her side.
'She's here, she's with us, I can feel her warping reality around us.'
“I heard Jody was over earlier?”
“I can’t wait for Michael to ask me what my political interests are.” Meg snarked.
“I was playing hide and seek with Mary,” Dean said arrogantly. Sam took it in stride.
“Cards,” he reached into his pocket and pulled a pack out. Claire shoved their books out of the way to make space for the cards.
Gabriel shrugged easily, and Castiel tried to remain in the conversation. It was strange to hear his brothers talking about Dean’s family so intimately when he had found it so hard to even have a basic conversation with them, but then his brothers had always been more open than he was.
“Claire, please say that was some bad taste joke or something. Because I’m going to have to report it if you weren’t.”
Gabriel popped up on the desk, biting into a large chocolate bar.
Eventually he released, covering Castiel’s hands and his chest, and he fell forward, hands splayed on the covers as Castiel continued fucking him hard. Finally, Castiel let go, and flopped onto his back, panting hard.
“Male. Strippers.”
“Dean, what did you take?” Castiel whispered.
‘Dean’s worried that someone will die at our wedding.’ Castiel summed up. Sam pulled one of the books that Castiel had been pretending to read, and flicked through it absent-mindedly.
“Darlings, this is going to be dreary enough without being sober as well. Drink up! And Dean, if you need a little TLC later,” he winked and moved on. Dean shook his head and bent close to Castiel’s ear.
'I didn't even know, Ben! I only found out when I met Dad!'
“What about us?” Alex persisted. Claire was aware the others were watching them. Claire bit her lip. What she wanted to say was that Kaia and Patience hadn’t bothered with her since her nose got broken, and Alex had tried to fight her when she ended the relationship. That this should be their peace offering, not their demand for an apology. But fighting with her friends the morning before her father’s wedding was not what she wanted. She thought quickly.
‘Spoiler alert: Bruce was a ghost.’
“I wanted to surprise you both. I promise, it’s a good surprise. I prepared for it last night. Dean said it would make up for the first activity. I know it’s my bachelors and all, but I just really want to enjoy the day with you both.”
“Why’s he punishing you, Cas? Because of me? Because I made you turn your back on your brothers and sisters? Because I encouraged you to have free will?”
She was trying to focus on Dean’s gentle approach, but the raucous laughter was getting to her too much. After accidentally knocking her ball into a nearby pond, she whipped around, moving to the end of their green. Dean grabbed her shoulders, trying to stop her storming over to the other kids.
He saw his own techniques, and knew he couldn’t have done more even if it was day break. He saw a spear narrowly miss his neck, and Castiel react to the miss. The noise Dean had heard that had ruined his concentration. He turned, and disappeared as Castiel did, just as another spear was making its way to the gap in his helmet, a spear he did not see coming and would not have survived. But the horseman delivering the blow didn’t seem to notice how close he had come to ending Dean, nor his disappearance. He drove the spear into the next man from Thebes. The army was still rousing itself from sleep, or not awake yet, and only a few men were awake to take on the attack. They were quickly dispatched.
“I don’t know, Dean.” She ground out. He sat back, saying nothing more, but Claire wasn’t stupid. She knew he was working it out, but there was no chance to pursue the conversation as the football players came running out onto the field, and the crowd cheered louder than the cheerleaders. Claire focused harder on the game than she ever had in her life, reacting appropriately to touchdowns and checks by the other team. As soon as a break was announced, she excused herself to the bathroom.
“I won’t keep it from you again.”
“Thanks, Dad.”
“You must remember it is practice, and they are on your team,” Benny reprimanded him as he gulped the wine down. “You don’t want to be responsible for the downfall of Thebes because you single-handedly decimated your own company out of boredom, do you?”
"Yes. Flora was strong, but she was still a small girl. The damage seemed to be temporary. I'm making him rest for a day or two before we start looking for Stevie. How are you and Faith getting along?"
“I have your ring.”
Castiel nodded, and took the water, settling back into his chair and trying to prepare himself for what was to come. He made himself look at the measly amount of money left in his name, knowing Michael had already seen it. His brother took charge, and for once Castiel was grateful.
“Maybe not, but I did it for Sam, not her.”
'We should tell her now,' Dean eventually muttered. 'She's probably sick of being kept in the dark about everything.'
'Hello, Dexter.' Krissy gave a tight smile, as Dax handed over the key to Faith.
“Dude, why do you keep doing that?” Claire was the one to ask. Patience hid behind her hair slightly.
'Dax! Down here!' Krissy's voice called up from the parking lot. She was standing beside a sleek black car that Dax instantly fell in love with. He ran down the steps and over to the car, grabbing his chest as he pulled an inhaler out of his pocket. Of all the days for Faith to give him an asthma attack!
“And Sam. He hasn’t said much, but I don’t think he’s impressed that I’m considering taking you back.”
“Did you hear the way you talked about me? I know you were trying to protect your dad and I get it, but it feels like you’re not really into this. So you don’t have to be.”
Dean looked down at his teenage daughter.
Dean grinned, glad that Castiel couldn’t see it.
They finished the drinks on the table, and stood up, Gabriel banging down a wad of dollar bills before they staggered out of the restaurant-and-bar, and headed towards the casino. Gabriel was soon joined by the waitress, and then Castiel lost track of him.
“Even if I actually did okay with Michael?”
Dean paused for a moment, before pulling Castiel closer, kissing him firmly, his tongue demanding its way into Castiel’s mouth. And then they were rolling over on the bed, Dean using his newfound strength to pin Castiel to the bed as he imagined their clothes off.
“No. He wants you to come in, join in with us. He’s blackmailing me to get you in there so please don’t argue.”
'You like Mac and Cheese? I don't really have anything else.'
“Don’t check out our asses when we go,” one of them said, flicking back her bright red hair. “Some of us want to get our notebooks in peace.”
“You don’t think this is Crowley or Rowena messing with us?” Dean pushed.
‘I love surprise blow jobs.’ He muttered, just as they heard a scuffling outside the front door, echoing through the room. They paused for a moment, before Dean began stuffing himself back inside his jeans, and Castiel crawled out from under the table. He pointed wordlessly to his face and Dean smirked.
“I know I have a coffee addiction. You pick a great roast,” Charlie chattered. Claire didn’t hear her father’s response as she headed up the stairs to the apartment, slumping on the sofa and staring up at a picture of a cat silhouette that Castiel had apparently had for years. He joined her a few minutes later.
“If you’re conscious that long.”
Faith reached over and squeezed his arm, and he folded her hand into the crook of his elbow, walking together like an old fashioned couple. They fell silent, listening to Sam catch Dean up on what had happened with the antichrist girls, and Gabriel caught up with him to tell him about their trip, the demons they had fought and Junior’s attack. Faith put Castiel’s arm across her shoulder, and stepped closer to him.
'I'll be right back,' Sam announced. 'I need to get something from the basement.'
“Boring. I don’t know why I still get dragged along with my parents to Washington. It would be so much easier if they just made me dictator of the United States. You can be my first lady boy.”
“It’s strange. They sound a little different on your tapes.”
Dax was feeling delirious in the darkened basement. He had spent the hours in solitude straining to use a long-forgotten power he'd unlocked with an old apprentice, but the effort used to work the power was making him lightheaded. Still, he persevered, and after several hours - he'd lost track of how much time had passed, exactly - he'd managed to open the locks with his mind. As they flew open, he flopped forward onto the floor, panting and gripping his head, waiting in tense anticipation of the sound of footsteps on the cement floor, and that total psychopath Sam showing up, torturing him without turning physical, taunting him for Faith's defecting loyalty, for his failed attempt at taking over the bunker.
Was he flirting? Did he just successfully manage to flirt with The Dean Winchester?
“So, are we done? Because I gotta go over my lesson plans.”
“Hello, Alex,” Castiel said stiffly.
, Dean! I thought we only had the week. I couldn’t tell if you wanted me or Cassandra-”
Claire unwrapped her own fork and did so. It was tasty, and fresh, and she could see why Jack had reacted that way. They quickly demolished it, chasing the last few crumbs and smears of whipped cream across the plate, fighting over the last bite and dissolving into giggles. They focused on their shakes, and on catching up with each other’s lives. Not the angst-ridden pain of their immediate families, but of Jack’s reasons for going into child psychology, and how he ended up prom king; of Claire learning about her orientation and travelling around the states with her mom during vacation times back when Amelia was well.
“Uh, sure. Um,” she took a deep breath in, and tried to steel herself. “My mom died, it’s how I live with my dad now. How I ended up at this school. And Mr Winchester has been pretty cool talking about it, because he lost his mom young too. He gave me a ride to school one time to make sure I was okay, because my dad was working and they’re friends. I wanted to say thank you but I couldn’t say it without sounding like a dork so I hugged him. That’s what started all this stupid stuff, someone saw that hug and thought it meant something it didn’t.”
“Promise.”
“I wish that would work, Mary. But grown ups are sillier than kids.”
There finally came the point in the evening where Castiel and Meg could escape. She launched her bouquet into the gaggle of female socialites who had been tearing up the dance floor, and they left for a nearby hotel to spend the night in the honeymoon suite.
'Yeah, right kiddo. Your mom's brought me up to speed on everything. So you're pregnant, and your dad wants to kill your boyfriend. Sounds like a regular episode of
Dean gave a small shake of his head, so that Mary wouldn’t see it. Castiel frowned at him, and he mouthed the word ‘later’.
“Are we still friends?”
“Wanna gross out your daughter?” Dean smirked, nodded his head slowly, trying to influence Castiel’s response. Claire shot him a dirty look.
“Maybe Cas likes a man who gives goo-goo eyes to a cherry pie.” Sam offered.
“Come on, my car’s this way,” Sam gestured along, and Castiel dragged his carry on case behind them, watching as Eileen and Sam continued their conversation without including him. He turned on his cell as Sam began to pull out of the car lot, and saw a message from Dean explaining that he had to step in as babysitter last minute and he’d go into it more when Castiel got there. That Sam and Eileen should be able to pick him up and expect Eileen to make some deaf jokes.
“No,” he called loudly over his shoulder, still looking at them. “No fooling around. Junior isn’t even in the bed. Either he’s got no game or your kids suck at being teenagers.”
“That I remember,” Castiel breathed. Dean laughed again.
'Hey Princess, what if we called your mom? Maybe Cas'll come.'
"We can't."
“I stopped focusing,” Dean admitted. “I was so determined not to lose you I lost control.”
He took a couple of minutes outside of the house, psyching himself up before ringing the doorbell. But even after he did, there was no answer. He tried again, and waited a few moments more before heading towards the studio, wondering if Dean and Charlie were holed up in there. But the door was locked, the lights were off. He walked back to the front door and sat on the steps just outside of it, preparing to wait. He put his head in his hands, scrunching up his hair, just thinking over every time he had been to this house. Seeing the Winchesters and how close they could be, realising how little that existed in his own life. Taking in the reality of what was to come.
“No, my apologies, I was in another world. I don’t recognise you, either.”
“It kind of is,” Claire grinned at her. “Look, I want to be with you. If you want to be with me, then what’s the problem?”
'My girlfriend's flying.' Dax managed to breathe out.
It was because he was thinking about him, surely? Because he had been deciding whether or not he was making the right choice. Dean couldn’t really be standing on the other side of the front door, his expression clear, his body language relaxed. Castiel almost slammed the door in shock, managing to catch it just in time. If it really was Dean, it maybe wasn’t the best idea to slam the door in his face. Castiel peered out of the gap. Dean was watching him without reaction.
“Our training might finally come to some good use?” Dean checked. They nodded. “I’ll put up with Athenians for that.”
'She's a character. Reminds me of my friend. Hey, whatcha reading?'
Dean felt his stomach drop, anticipating the worst. Had someone killed his brother? He would avenge them. They would feel all the might of Thebes through Dean’s rage.
“I know,” Claire tried to speak, but felt a lump in her throat. There were so many things she wanted to be able to promise Alex, but she already knew it wasn’t going to work with what she needed. She wracked her brains for something she could say to make her girlfriend feel better. “I’m glad you told me this.”
“And I’m worried.”
Soon, night fell and they both removed their helmets and arranged themselves so they could sleep comfortably together, ready to begin walking in the morning. Castiel fell asleep quickly, but Dean lay there, watching him tucked under his armpit, stroking his bare arm gently. He thought over the words they had exchanged, that somehow felt more significant than the oath they took for the army, and although they had had mere weeks together he started to wonder how he would cope years from now when he was too old to fight for Thebes and had to leave Castiel behind. It turned his stomach, thinking of walking away, imagining Castiel picking an eromenos of his own. He tightened his grip on his beloved, and forced himself to give in to sleep.
“And what about the locals? What about your boss? You think it won’t get out that you have a husband? You think this town will accept that?”
Castiel gathered himself, and continued.
Dean looked at Castiel for a moment, and then rolled his eyes rather than bothering to ask. When he left the room, Becky immediately began over-analysing her brother-in-law.
Castiel then remembered the mess he had left between the two of them.
“Um, there’s one line in the song,” Dean began, licking his lips slowly. Castiel looked at the rings.
Castiel turned around and took off his sunglasses to give his brother the filthiest look he could muster, and Balthazar smirked right back, and began ticking things off on his fingers.
“Hey, where is your dad? Charlie’s alone in the store, she said Cas was up here.” He looked around, as though Castiel were going to jump out on him, and Claire swapped a look with Alex. She didn’t like the idea of lying to Dean, but she knew nothing about the Jack that her father had gone off with either.
his princess.”
Because wringing Gabriel’s neck wasn’t an option.
He twined their fingers together, pulling Castiel closer to him, obviously intent on kissing right in front of Gabriel. Castiel only allowed it because he knew that Dean wasn’t going to change his mind, and if that was the case, Castiel wanted to remember exactly how he tasted, how it felt when Dean got into his rhythm, all his little quirks that made kissing Dean Winchester one of Castiel’s favourite things to do. He knew they must look vaguely pornographic, especially when Dean leaned back in the armchair, and tugged Castiel along with him until the angel was straddling him. Castiel was holding his fiancé’s head, rubbing his fingers in his hair as Dean’s fingers trailed along his back. And all the while, their tongues danced together furiously, their mouths working a frantic rhythm, and Castiel wished intensely that Gabriel wasn’t there.
Claire rolled her eyes.
The three of them walked back inside, leaving Castiel watching Dean and Faith flying slowly nearby. Sam let Charlie and Dax into the computer room and disappeared again quickly, returning after Charlie had opened up a panel with a small stack of photographs.
“Claire?”
Alex finally dropped her gaze to look at Claire, who gave a nervous smile back.
He said that differently to how he said about raising Sam for love. There are times I get this vibe from him, sometimes lately, I’ve wondered myself. I think I know what this is, but I don’t see why it has to be said now, what relevance it has. Can’t it be a celebration of survival?
Faith still wasn't over her mood about Castiel's input from the day before.
“Just remember,” Claire grinned, “if you miss anything out, it’s not legal.”
“Thanks, Alfie. Um, this is Cas.”
Faith rolled her eyes, and slumped in her seat.
“Do you mean Bear?” He sat back against the cushions. “No. I haven’t even told him why I call you that.”
'No, I did. Why wouldn't the baby know someone so important?'
“Why?”
“But I still have needs, just like Dean does. It wasn’t his first trip to Vegas, you know.” She leaned against the counter.
Alex looked up from the take out menu.
Dean planted a wet kiss on his cheek as they got closer to the house, and Castiel sighed dramatically.
The voice-over Castiel began singing about the fifth day of Christmas, and Dean tried to get his breath back, wondering how Castiel was going to emulate five inanimate rings. It was slightly less comical. One goose-Cas had rolled his egg away, and the other five began to ring like cellphones. They all opened differently, and each Castiel looked adorably confused as he picked up his egg phone. One of them connected, and that Castiel walked off screen, talking on the phone. The other four eggs fell apart, revealing four bird-Castiel’s, twittering along to Castiel singing about the four calling birds.
'No, I'm writing a definitive guide on hunting, I just agreed to give Krissy some help. Problem?'
He opened his arms wide, zapping the few feet over to Castiel and pulling him close, kissing along his hairline slowly.
“Is it safe to go in there?” Claire checked. Dean frowned, and rubbed a hand over his face.
'No, human Charlie. Faith saw to the skin walker version of me. So what are you doing here?'
“Thanks.”
'You hunted a vampire nest when you were
“I don’t know,” Castiel turned to look at the apartment, and then back at Dean. “I should check she’s okay. I’ll see you soon.”
“Dad didn’t want me,” she whispered. “Not at first. I heard them talking.”
“Some of the faculty feel that, missing the game and not cheering when she’s part of the squad was a sign that she knew what the other cheerleaders were planning and was either the target or wanted to avoid seeing Claire take the fall.”
“Uh-huh. That cool with you?”
'I guess I need to get my strength up to relearn how to fly.' Faith smiled, sliding into a seat at the table. 'Can you make pancakes?'
“Read up on it, Dad.”
“Your books are open on the floor.”
“His fathers?”
“I’m glad we had her,” Dean said eventually. “I’m glad you started all this.”
Dean groaned, and nipped the skin by his collarbone with his teeth.
Dax held up his hand at Faith, before she could join in the ranting.
“I can wait,” he assured him. “May I have this one?”
Dean didn’t move, and the only comfort that Castiel could find was that the Hunter seemed to have a small smile on his face in his sleep. He had taken to running his fingers over the cage, which still held firm around Dean, still translucent and soft to touch. After staring at the patterns on the cage for a few hours, Castiel realised it looked like feathers, growing into a strong set of wings. It was as though Dean was protecting himself through the change.
“And then Amelia introduced me to our new neighbours, two men who were very happy together. You loved them because they could make balloon animals, and Amelia loved them because they could bake like professionals. And I would watch them, the ease they had with each other, the way they would talk and laugh with each other. How they would never want to be too far away from each other when they could help it. It made me reflect even more, on my marriage and my feelings. They moved away not long after they came, one of them had a changeable job, but they left their mark. Eventually, I realised I couldn’t live the lie anymore. Amelia and I spoke endlessly about it, but I had to do what was right for everyone. It wasn’t fair to trap Amelia in a one-sided marriage, it wasn’t fair to raise you in a household where your parents are only together for your sake because that never works as well as parents think. And it wasn’t fair to be married to someone who didn’t spark that interest in me.”
Time stood still, or allowed decades to pass by, as Dean stood in the sweet-smelling grove, alone and unarmed. His jaw dropped as he took in the epic mountain in the distance, capped with the most glorious, overwhelming temple he had ever seen. There was no way, absolutely no way, that he was standing in the foothills of Mount Olympus. And yet, all evidence seemed to point that way …
“You’re still recovering, you should get it,” Faith argued back.
“Do you like him, Dean?” Eileen piped up from the backseat. He turned to look at her and she grinned sheepishly. “I was reading Sam’s lips in the rear view.”
“I couldn’t say anything.”
“Is that how you coped?”
“Would you like a drink?” He tried to sound polite. He wanted to make the effort with Mary, to find a mutual ground with her. She said nothing, but drifted towards a nearby bookshelf, scanning the spines for a title that might catch her eye. Castiel shuffled into the kitchen anyway, making her a coffee the way that Dean had told him, hoping it would appeal to her somehow. He didn’t know what he was supposed to have done, why she seemed to dislike him the way that she did. She hadn’t known who he was, what he had done in the name of helping her sons. She seemed to like Gabriel well enough, despite his propensity for vulgarity. So what was wrong with Castiel?
“If you ever need to talk Dean, before or after you move up there, you know I’m here for you, right?” Sam broke into his thoughts. “Even if you wanna drink a beer and not talk, I can do that.”
“Do you even know enough people to invite to a party?” Claire tried to tease him back. He clutched his chest, over his heart.
'What happened to her?'
“I can’t come again for a while, Dean,” Castiel whispered.
Castiel seemed to waver for a moment.
“I know.”
“Dean, you’ve seen the average age of my clientele.”
Castiel beamed at her.
'Yes, I remember. I remember you and Dean intervening then as well. But Gabriel has kept tabs on all three of them, for as long as God has asked for. And they might be able to hide from angels, but they can't hide from my father.' Castiel said in a clipped tone, as he craned his neck again through the crowd.
She looked up at him, into his earnest hazel eyes, and felt unable to hold back. Not about her parents, and how confusing they were, but everything else.
“Hello, Kevin.”
Claire pursed her lips, and refused to bite.
“Hey Jody. Still in the Christmas spirit?”
“You seem confident in what Dean wants when you’ve just met,” Mary observed somewhat callously.
Dean laughed, and Castiel made his way out of his row of chairs, approaching Dean with a strangely staggered step as though he were trying not to run. Dean leaped out of his chair and met him halfway, pulling him straight into a kiss. Claire suddenly became engrossed in her nails as those gathered reacted to the scene in front of them. She listened carefully, but it all seemed positive, yes there were some whispers, but there were a few whoops and catcalls too. Claire looked up to see them still kissing, gripping each other tightly, and she knew they were making up for the week they had been separated.
'I can't tell you that, Faith.'
“Thanks. Tell Cas that for me.”
“Okay so … wanna complain about Mr Singer droning on and on about the civil war?”
'Hey, you're up already … and sober.' He spotted Faith and Dax, sitting with their backs to him. 'Oh.
“I have my methods,” Gabriel gave a small smile. “So I guess we should make our tributes to your fathers?”
Castiel walked across the large room, looking around at the small side tables cluttered with various religious artefacts, and one that inexplicably held a vast collection of Busty Asian Beauties. In the far corner was a liquor cabinet, and Castiel wondered briefly if he was somehow in Dean’s version of Heaven. He debated sitting in a winged armchair, but if this was nothing to do with Dean, he wanted to be prepared for the inevitable. So far as he was concerned, Naomi might still want to kill him.
It wasn’t any better the next day at school. People would stop talking as Claire approached, whispering behind her back as she moved on, and constantly staring. She wanted to talk to Alex about it, since Alex was the only normal person at the school, but at the same time, she couldn’t keep relying on her friend. Alex had her own things going on. So she pretended she didn’t notice the other kids and focused on getting through the hallways as quickly as possible, keeping her head down in class and just focusing on the work.
“Benny?”
There was some sniggering in the back of the room, and Claire ignored it. Chuck did too. Claire bristled, and leaned forward in her chair.
“Claire, come in a minute.”
But it wasn’t right, was it? Having an - oh God - a sex dream about your cousin. A sex dream about your cousin when you were asexual. Did that even happen? She still had her father’s book, and she flipped through it, using her phone torch to see what it said about asexuals and sex. Surely a sex dream was sexual attraction? She wasn’t meant to experience it. She didn’t experience it. So why had she enjoyed what was happening in her dream with her happy-go-lucky cousin?
“No. This is not a date. This is me and my sister hanging out and inviting you along and then maybe my sister will begin to forgive you.”
“Are you going to be okay?” He asked her as they walked through the entrance gates.
'I know, kid. I know.' Gabriel clapped a hand on her shoulder, and offered out the half-chewed chocolate bar. 'Want some?'
“Whatever,” Claire carried on focusing on what was left of her cruller.
'Like what?'
The baby stopped responding, and Faith sighed audibly. Why couldn’t anything just be simple?
“Right. It’s still going to be weird not to have you there.”
"Bess isn't here. Faith, if you wanna see Junior's naked baby pictures, I got a tonne."
“Nice. So, you can get bacon double cheeseburgers any time?”
'Yeah, Charlie's going to keep the bunker running, and protected. And Dean and Faith won't want to think that you're on some kind of suicide mission.'
“You’re not going anywhere near that man,” he decided. “And he’s going to stop touching my wife. He shouldn’t be here if he’s been inappropriate with you.”
Cas led the way into the main function room, where they ran into Lucifer almost straight away. Lucifer was already annoyed that Castiel had overridden him on Kevin’s appointment, and sided with Michael over hiring new drivers, and it was evident in the snarky tone he adopted.
'Faith,' Dean growled, and then sighed again. 'I'm not trying to make it sound like anything. He left the van in the garage, he went somewhere on foot.'
There wasn’t anyone. It was times like this where she needed her mom. Amelia would have listened, she wouldn’t have judged. Claire tried to imagine what her mother would say at this point, but it had been so long since she had thought of her, the voice wasn’t there anymore.
“No, it was good. It’s just, things kind of happened and I don’t know how I feel about it.”
“You’re nearly there, Faith.”
Castiel had barely begun to raise his head when suddenly they were fully clothed again, still sprawled across the bench, still hidden from the human world.
'Alone.' He spelled out. Faith rolled her eyes but stood up anyway, following him out into the hallway, stealing a liquorice strand and nodding towards her old bedroom.
Claire nodded, and looked around at the other passengers in the queue while he walked away. And then Claire felt the urge to run. Not because she wanted to make things difficult for her father, but she wasn’t sure if she was ready to return to Pontiac. To seeing someone else living in her childhood home, her friends moving on without her, and all the places her mother should be but wouldn’t. And she couldn’t understand why Castiel would want to return either, since it was the place he left his family.
“So … your dad’s banging the principal.” Alex said from the couch. Claire turned and glared at her. “And I’m guessing that’s where they were Saturday when I saw you in the diner, right? You knew when you spoke to Mr Winchester where that Mr Winchester was.”
“Hey, I thought you were at the bookstore all day?” Alex asked.
“He’s busy.”
“They’re regular ball-busters.” Gabriel laughed.
'Right about the time you opened your mouth, then?' he smirked back. 'Faith, it's me. Garth. We spoke on the phone with that djinn case in Cincinnati?'
And halfway through their meals, a figure appeared, seemingly from nowhere, leaning onto the table with folded arms and smiling up at Faith. She looked at the man, who was roughly her height, mid-length golden hair slicked back and a twinkle in his eyes, and she grinned, as Dax rolled his eyes. He would never get used to Gabriel just appearing.
“Yeah, we are.”
Castiel remembered it slightly differently, searching through the darkness for a specific soul. Finding him standing there, shaking as he cracked a whip on another soul, the material slicing the surface open. Reaching him as quickly as possible, forcing the whip away from him and wrapping his arms tight around the quivering soul. That feeling that stirred in him as he held the soul close, one of protection and wonder. That this soul had been through so much torture - whether receiving pain or administering it, he had been tortured - and still had the capacity to seem whole. How grateful the soul seemed to be in his arms, tiny and fragile. How it curled up against him, and he understood why he was sent for this soul, why he was given this mission.
“I love being your principal,” Dean grinned back cheerfully.
As soon as class was over, Claire grabbed Alex’s wrist and dragged her into a broom closet, shutting the door behind them. They were pressed up close together in the dark, trying not to fall over the mop bucket.
Dean looked nonplussed at the change in direction.
Dean started stroking the back of Castiel’s hand, which felt wonderful with the right amount of pressure and pleasurable sensation.
“Bite me.” She repeated.
Faith glanced nervously up at Dean, who looked back down at her with pursed lips. She could see him considering the same thing that she was. Could they trust Ben with the truth about her mother?
- is your mom? What is that?'
“No, I did. But the whole ace stuff makes sense for me, and now it’s like, can I do that? I don’t know what the rules are.”
Dean stepped closer to the box, rifling through the books.
Anna flounced away, her red hair swinging as she crossed the yard, and Castiel poked Dean.
“Then why isn’t that enough?”
“In a few months, I think. We’re just enjoying being engaged at the moment, aren’t we Clarence?”
“Or give it some time. But either way, we support you.”
“Maybe we should go to mine?” Alex whispered, just as they heard Dean shout ‘yes’ repetitively. Claire felt nauseated. “Claire?”
“Not this time, Dean. See you tomorrow.”
“Not in here. Walk with me?”
“How are you feeling?” Castiel asked quietly.
Dean smirked.
'I don't think so. He's hot for you, you know that right?'
'I'm not, Faith. We both know it.'
Kaia gave her own fake smile.
The freshman’s friend nudged him, and whispered in his ear. His eyes widened and he looked Claire up and down, before slinking off with his friend.
“How was your placement this morning, Jack?” Castiel asked before biting into an egg roll. Jack was busy opening the soy sauce bottle, and Claire forced herself to study her plate, and not the way Jack’s eyebrows had been furrowed as he concentrated on his task and relaxed at the question his uncle had asked.
She sniffed, burying her face into her pillow.
“That’s teenspeak for ‘I’m over it, Dad’s boyfriend, but I need to save face.’ You learn to speak the lingo when you teach teenagers for ten years.” Dean spoke to Castiel as they got into the car. Claire slid into the back, just as Dean launched into the importance of saving face at the age of fifteen. Castiel cut him off with a kiss. “What was that for?”
Don’t work too hard. Don’t forget to eat, or sleep. Can’t wait to see what else you make for this next show.
“Cas, he made you so happy, we could all see it. He would do anything for you, too. Why are you walking away from that?”
“It was my wife,” he said softly. Michael and Raphael stopped talking, and turned to him.
“Balthazar, you boast even when you don’t have sex,” Castiel didn’t break stride.
They appeared in the room together, Gabriel crashing into the seat beside Castiel as Dean stood near his mother.
“I know.” He sounded choked.
“What do you think, Claire?” her English teacher interrupted her thoughts. She sat back and looked at him. She wasn’t going to admit she hadn’t heard him, that she hadn’t been paying any attention whatsoever. She only had sarcastic remarks left.
'So she's not like her Mom? I've not heard much about her, yet.'
“Are you looking forward to tonight?” Castiel asked as the oil in the pan started sizzling.
affectionate with each other, either. Faith had declared when she was ten and he was twelve that they were going to be together forever and there was a lot they needed to do, so kissing and "gross things like that" could wait. She was too determined to save the world to think about that kind of thing. But Dax knew that being told she wasn't allowed to do it immediately made her want to, just to prove a point.
Alex snorted softly.
The difficulty with that thought was, Faith knew, that by having this baby, going through with the birth, she was already promised to the angels. And she hadn't had the choice.
“Right. But it’s hard not to be insecure with you, Claire. You push me away when I kiss you and you don’t wanna do anything with me, and sometimes it feels like you only said yes for an easy life.”
“Um,”
(See the end of the chapter for
'I think we're all hoping that being devout will override the fact we're werewolves.'
“Castiel!”
“Uh, yeah, I think so?
'What else can you do? And don't bullshit me, my brother saw you jump at least twelve feet in the air. Krissy's seen you fix a broken leg by touching it. And apparently, you can hunt a vampire nest alone at six years old. What are you?'
'I haven't lied to her! You think I can?' Dax spluttered. Dean looked up from the papers, squinting at Dax for a moment, before going back to the writing.
“Because most of our soldiers did. You fight so well, and you’re in the band known for continuing the tradition. You know there was Michael before there was Benny. Who was there before me?”
Junior's expression changed, to one that made it easier to ignore the world. He was pitying her, she could see it in his eyes. She wasn't about to be pitied.
Castiel shook his head.
He went to step forward, and lurched suddenly, the ground coming up to meet him in almost comical slow motion, until he stopped suddenly, inches away from the concrete.
“It was their grandfathers. Are you okay?”
“It’s not my marriage,” Emmanuel said softly.
“Look, I’m sorry about yesterday. I was an asshole.”
There were a few muttered hellos before Dean’s siblings went back to their fascination with Castiel and Emmanuel.
'Yep. You should've heard her toy names. Her teddy was Bear, her unicorn was Pony, her rabbit was Rabbit-'
“You didn’t see everything, Bobby.” Dean said smugly from behind Claire.
He pocketed his phone, and got off the bed.
Castiel was such an asshole. He always had to sound so reasonable.
“Because I care about you, and her, and I see it a lot in those situations. And I know you, Cas. I know her. You weren’t pretending she was an angel, she wasn’t acting like she hadn’t done wrong. Believe me, you were the nicer end of the crap I deal with sometimes. And it is hard, knowing what to do when people are saying that kind of thing. At the moment it’s just a stupid rumour amongst the kids, but it goes any further than that? I could lose my job. I could end up on registers, even though it’s not true. And then it’s like, we’re too new for people to know the truth but what would happen if it got to that point and they didn’t?”
“The Chuck ones. Not the Carver ones.”
“You want me to throw a parade?”
I’m at home now, Dean. Thank you for a wonderful evening. I’ll speak with you in the morning.
Castiel timidly took the morsel of food off of Dean’s fork, with a volcano of emotion erupting inside him as he did. He couldn’t even taste the food. He was too busy trying to figure out once again if this was Dean showing how he really felt, or if Dean thought that he was fulfilling his duty by flirting heavily in front of the other Novak brothers. He still couldn’t stop himself from indulging in Dean, in continuing to swap food and feed each other, whisper together as the meal progressed. Dean even wiped a small spot of cream from the corner of Castiel’s mouth with a napkin at one point. It was so easy to fall into believing that Dean could care about him too. Castiel tried to turn his mind off and just go with the fantasy.
Seriously, how did vaginas function again? Apart from growing children?
“I didn’t mean that, Cas.”
His phone beeped with a text message, and he pulled it out of his pocket.
'Did last night really happen?'
“Claire, you have probably heard that Michael and Chuck’s associates are currently talking to your principal,” Sam continued drily, his voice giving no indication about his feelings towards his brother’s situation. “And regardless of what the truth is, I’m sure you know the reason they’re talking to him. Michael and Chuck want to talk to you about the same thing. Bobby and I are here to help you, to help them, and to help the principal all get to the truth, okay?”
She glared at him, forgoing the need to ignore him for the urge to correct him.
The conversation shifted constantly between the adults, circling work and food and the game along with their memories from their youth. Alex was still quiet, and Claire was soaking in all of Sam and Jody’s stories about Dean as a kid, which were just as entertaining as the ones Mr Singer had told. They sat with their hands under the table, fingers loosely concertinaed together, sharing a menu which only Alex was browsing. Their server was hovering nearby, trying to at least take drink orders but there was no break in the conversation to try. Eventually, he caught Claire’s eye and winked. She started, and immediately looked at the menu, putting her head close to Alex’s.
“I believe you’ll enjoy this band. We should get going soon to make it in time. Will you drive the Impala?”
'He's right, though, Faith,' Dax fluffed his fringe up as he sipped his coffee. 'We need to be more careful. You go in, all guns blazing, working on instinct, and that's great, but one day it's going to get us into trouble.'
“What kind of a question is that?” Dean snorted.
“What’s going on?” He asked, before he was bundled into one of the cars.
“Perhaps, if there’s nothing else that catches my eye. Is there anything you recommend?”
“I’ll set the table.”
“I thought Mr W was with his brother?” One of the cheerleaders giggled too loudly.
There was one time when he was in the gallery during opening hours where he didn’t have the chance to hide, and it would have looked strange if he attempted to do so. He was evaluating a painting by another artist, one who hadn’t quite decided on their technique but had been nominated for this award, when voices started up not far behind him.
Castiel’s veins were on fire. Dean was being so flirty as they trod water together. Castiel took the risk and put his arm around Dean’s neck.
I double checked locations on Superwiki. But made up the grandparents names.
General consensus at the end of the last chapter was "please don't make Jack and Claire date" and I don't want to upset people by putting stuff out there that really won't be enjoyed. Please bear with me though, there's something I want to do with this that kind of matches some of my ace experience and there is a reason this is happening but not what you might think. When I get to the point I want to, in the next couple of chapters, I'll explain what my thinking/experience is leading to this section x
"At least Faith wants to know," Castiel's voice was still gentle. "And so do I."
“Thanks, Chuck.” He passed the whisky bottle to Castiel, and slipped an arm around his waist. “I feel like that too. I was always married to Cas, right?”
“Hmmm.”
Everyone waited, but Chuck never mentioned whether Bess would also be joining them in Heaven. Instead, he clapped his hands together.
“Do we have to go?”
“Look at you, using your cell like a normal person. Add me on Snapchat.”
“We’re gonna go,” Dean told his brother as he slipped his arm around Castiel’s waist. “Congratulations, guys.”
The boys moved off, and Alex came to sit next to Claire on the fallen trunk she was watching the fire from. She shuffled close, until their legs were pressing against each other.
The redhead scoffed back at her.
He wrinkled his snout, and left the room, Garth immediately clapping him on the back and including him in a discussion with Dean and Sam. Faith sipped some more tea, before climbing out of the bed, and slipping into the bathroom, changing quickly into a pair of jeans and one of Sam’s old plaid shirts, which he had lent her to cover her bulging stomach. She joined them, sitting on Dean’s lap as they gathered around the small dining table.
'What's to say?' Dean grabbed another beer from the cupboard. Castiel walked over, removed the bottle from his hands, placed it in the refrigerator and turned to Dean slowly.
“I ruined date night yesterday. Just be quiet when you start getting it on.”
Faith grinned at Dax.
“There’s my Cas,” Dean laughed.
“You liked that I didn’t have my powers.”
“So, are we ever going to have the ex talk?”
“Same girl, same.” Kaia nodded, and looked around at the dance floor. “Oooh, Patience is dancing with your cousin.”
Night was beginning to fall, just as the camper van slowed to a croaky halt. Faith had been curled up in the passenger seat, snoozing, but stirred as the van stopped moving.
Claire felt her chest seize up. Alex was still flicking through the book.
'Dad, I-'
'I was grieving. I had just lost my kid, Cas! Do you think it wouldn't be reversed for her? And it's not even true, I'm like the new Bobby. I can't get away from it. Stop with the empty excuses, Cas. You let us both down.'
'I'm going to get your Dad, okay? Stay here. Promise me?'
“Good. He was hoping they would, and that you wouldn’t get pissed that he’d only tried to write.”
“I’ll wait on the porch.”
Dean gave Castiel a short run-through of all the things they had tried, as Faith groaned quietly on Dean's lap. Castiel patted her legs awkwardly, knowing it wasn't good enough to remove the churning sensation in her stomach.
Benny rested his head in both hands as some of the other soldiers approached.
“It’s no big deal. Really.” Claire shrugged.
“Like I said, love is love. In any way it manifests. And it’s hard when the people we love don’t love us the same way, but like Alex has said you said to her - we love each other in every way we can.”
They stopped short when they saw three people standing in the room, their poses impossibly stiff, their eyes tracking both of the new visitors.
Claire looked back at her father, who was smiling softly at her. The moment was broken as Claire’s drink and their pancakes arrived, and they tucked into the stacks, grabbing forkfuls of each choice and having small wars over desecrated pancake chunks, the conversation lulling as they ate except for the exclamations as someone stole a piece they were eyeing up. And all the while, Claire was so aware of Jack beside her, of every flex of his arm and glance he sent her way, of the way he smelled, of every brush against her as he reached to her plate. And overriding all of that, an energy she couldn’t place, like him being so close put him in some weird orbit with her body and she wasn’t sure how to remove it without offending him.
“Enough of the sir,” the general waved a hand dismissively. “We’re equals at this table. And shame, if he was anything like you, he would make a fine soldier.”
“See?” The guy gestured at Claire, looking at his friend, apparently unafraid of Claire’s wrath. “Totally the butch.”
They made their way inside, and Dean squeezed his fingers gently.
“No, I’ve found other ways to be irrelevant today.”
“I like being called ‘your magnificence’. Although Dean, coming from your mouth it almost sounds like a slur. I understand, you know. About you, and Thebes, and my most sacred band, and honour, and the Macedonians. But it was not I who summoned you here. We both have to wait, be patient, and take on board the words we’re told. Now, get off that knee and come sit. Enjoy some wine.”
“Puh-lease. We’ll mostly be eating junk food and watching movies. Bring me good souvenirs back.”
'I think so,' Ben sighed, focusing on the petite teenager instead of the man she stood beside. 'Did he ditch out on your mom too?'
“And that’s a big drama?” Claire snorted. The freshman nodded.
'I'll call him, see if he'll come pick us up, that'll save some time, right? And that'll be good for Junior.' She made herself stand up and step away from the crowd, so she didn't have to look at Junior's motionless body any longer, and so she could have some privacy to make the call.
Dean returned home calmer than he was when he had left. Bobby, his boss, had been understanding, though he hadn’t told Bobby everything. The house was once again quiet when he walked in, though when he went looking he found his mother in the kitchen, sipping a cup of coffee.
Castiel was gripped by Dean’s words, hearing the compassion behind them for his family situation, wondering if Dean had grieved himself or if he had put it aside to be there for his mother.
“Why give you them now?” Alex sounded perplexed as she held the letters gingerly.
'Look, I understand, pregnancy hormones. You should've heard Mary and the things she said to Joseph about the donkey. But look, You don't know Junior - or Garth - well enough to judge them.'
“He’s a dork,” Claire told her father. “Maybe forgive him for having a past?”
“You better believe I whooped his ass to get his act together. Especially after the thing in the field with the fireworks.”
“So, where are we going this time?”
“I’d better go see Dad. Catch up later?”
Claire sobered up immediately, and her father noticed.
“And how would you know that?” Castiel teased back. Dean went with the joke.
“Okay, so …” Dean seemed to be searching for the words. “The memory-wipe thing. Is that something you’re set on doing?”
'Dad, you dropped everything for me. You sobered up for me. You're doing okay.'
“What?”
Junior didn’t look enthralled about the idea of witnessing a birth first hand, but he wasn’t going to back down either. He was spared the argument by the arrival of her next contraction, just as Castiel materialised over to them.
It felt weird, like everything was upside-down. She was meant to be the one sitting nervously beside her crush while her parents kept an eye on them. The one who was supposed to pretend she didn’t notice her dates arm hovering near her shoulder.
There was something in Dean’s tone that made Castiel wary. He had been doing so well up until now, he had almost forgotten to be nervous. Dean had, despite his brittle demeanour, put him at ease. He answered with caution this time.
“Any time, Bear.”
“I didn’t mean to pry, or to invade your privacy. But it’s okay, Castiel. I think he’s good for you.”
“What happened to your father?”
Kaia’s words twisted in Claire’s gut again, as they had the night before.
“Yeah, they heard about him sleeping with that new girl, Clara.”
“Hey!” Several voices chorused together. Castiel laughed, and Dean joined in.
“Say I quit. Please.”
'Well?' Dean smirked, and wrapped his arms around Cas's shoulder. Cas happily wound his own arms around Dean's waist. 'Look out for yourself, Cas.'
“Hey, Dad. How’s the morning rush going?”
“Then I have a huge chasm to fill.”
Sam smiled, looking at Becky.
Gabriel snapped his fingers and disappeared, and Faith met Dax's eyes.
“Hello, this is Castiel Novak, I believe my brother Balthazar owns this stadium?”
“I’m embarrassing you?”
Castiel wished he shared Dean's optimism. He would never end up having to introduce himself to Castiel's mother.
“Sure. Sounds good.”
Claire walked along the hallway to her room, passing Jack’s open door as she did so. She glanced in, and saw Jack reading a book, his usual smile gone as he concentrated on the text. Even that seemed to be endearing somehow. He looked up as she paused, and broke into a huge smile.
“Mom’s expecting you home, but Eileen has to shoot off so I won’t be hanging around,” Sam told him as they walked. “So I guess it’s just the car ride home to explain why you’re wearing a wedding ring?”
“I didn’t say it wasn’t true.” Dean said eventually, sounding much more like his old self, if a little wary of where this conversation was going. “You are different. Important. You know that.”
A noise from behind made Faith turn her head, and she saw Junior moving restlessly, rubbing his face and groaning quietly. He was finally waking up. She turned around as best she could to look at him, and his eyes flickered open. He looked right at her, before looking around at Ben and Claire's place, and Faith waited patiently for his assessment.
'A gemini, I think. They gave her a July birthday, because they didn't know when hers was.'
“There is, there’s one thing she’s afraid of, there’s one thing strong enough to stop her.”
Castiel had completely forgotten about this part. About the kiss. How could he kiss anyone after kissing Dean that morning? And yet, how could he not kiss Meg now every other moment of the wedding had been completely perfunctory? But he could not, absolutely would not, kiss her in any way close to the way he and Dean did. He stooped awkwardly and pressed his mouth against hers, counting to three in his head before straightening up.
'Anyway, I came for Faith. We need to talk, chica.'
Castiel smiled at that.
Castiel hadn’t even thought about bidding. He’d concentrated more on time with Dean, on avoiding his brothers. He drank from his glass and debated it. Michael and Lucifer were both on his case to spend his money more often. Lucifer because he couldn’t see why Castiel wouldn’t indulge, Michael because he would talk about investments and contributing to the economy. Castiel wasn’t a miser, he donated to charities and tried to help those less fortunate in other ways. But this auction was meant to be raising money for a new homeless shelter close by.
“Last time I saw you, Claire, you were four, and I was eight. My friends wanted to play street hockey and you insisted on playing too. Knocked the goalie’s tooth out with a puck two minutes in, do you remember?”
“Which is how you got your nose broken,” Jack frowned, like he was doing the math, working out how it all fit together. “So, either you’re in the wrong for telling Uncle Dean that she was kicked off the squad or you’re in the wrong because you didn’t and she’s been unfairly suspended for it?”
She pulled Claire into a tight hug, and then stiffened as she saw Castiel.
It was the thirteenth of December; a Friday, that year. A lesser man than Dean Winchester would have been suspicious, sure that bad luck would befall him at any point during the day. He would avoid black cats and ladders, and stepping on cracks. He would rub rabbits feet and find four-leaf clovers and surround himself with multiples of seven in order to balance the karma of the cosmos.
There was a beat of silence as Dean realized that was probably what had happened. And then he groaned in complete frustration.
“No, he didn’t. I said it was bad timing, and I said yesterday that I’d say sorry to him.”
“I know. Thank you.”
“Perhaps someone knew his erastes that you could send a messenger to? After this fight?” Castiel said softly. “They might know more than the information the messenger was sent with. Your parents might know what came of him. But I’m sure he’s okay. If he’s half the man you are, he’ll take care of himself, I’m sure.”
He knew Meg would understand, she would encourage him to do the right thing, but the crowd in front of him? They made him freeze to the spot. And he was already panicking so much that he didn’t need the added pressure. All he could do was hope beyond hope that Dean got the message and acted on it. Dean would be the one to unfreeze him, to thaw out his panic. But with each passing, agonising moment there was no sign of him. Was he waiting for the moment that the assembled guests got to speak?
'I know it's hard to deal with-'
“Tell me about it. I’m so out of breath now.”
“Castiel, it’s time to stop fooling yourself. This thing with Dean was only ever going to last as long as the money did.”
'Unfortunately,' he grouched, as she surged forward and pulled him into an embrace. 'Hey, Charlie.'
“Oh, don’t be fooled, that was like, ninety percent Uncle Balthazar.” Claire sipped from her drink, as Alex shook her head.
She shook her head quickly, trying to clear the image, but it was so strong and she had no choice but to see the vision through. The bear spoke to her, and she passed off the teddy's concerned tone to chatter about Sam as her uncle queued another disc up to play. He came back to the sofa and sat beside her, the bear in between them, his arm across her tiny shoulders. The bear kept whispering about Sam, how he wasn't to be trusted, how he had demon blood, and so many other things that she began to doubt herself. Despite the way the bear was worrying her, she felt her eyelids begin to close, and she let go of the rest of her s'more as she slumped against Sam.
“Describe what happened,” Chuck stepped back slightly. “How you ended up alone together, why you were going to end up fighting.”
'She is nephilim,' Castiel shrugged. 'Super strength.'
“Night Claire Bear.”
“I’m not sleeping. I heard him.” Ben’s voice piped up, much louder than Alfie’s. “You married Castiel?!”
Through the door, they all heard her call out.
'Do you really want to get into it?' He glanced briefly at Dax. 'I know a little bit about cars, I can tune yours up before you go.'
“Ouch.”
“You’ve never been with anyone else, have you?” He realised. “I’m your first.”
He looked up at her in the mirror, their gazes meeting in the reflection.
“No. I plan to be very naked and against you, all night.” Dean promised, and laid beside him, their bodies touching. “Don’t get dressed either.”
“Stop bringing it up.”
“You love it,” Dean grinned at him. Castiel eyed him for a moment, and then shoved a slice of carrot in his mouth. They messed around in the kitchen for a while, and Claire watched as Dean tried to get his revenge with a broccoli floret, chasing him around and play wrestling until they kissed again. Castiel had never messed around like this with Amelia, not when Claire was there at least. She couldn’t imagine them doing it when she wasn’t. And yet, with Dean, it seemed so normal, such a part of both of them to have those immature moments together. She took a picture and sent it to Alex, who replied back with a string of emojis that seemed to echo Claire’s thoughts about it.
“Yes, I’ve been in contact with Dean all morning. I hope we didn’t embarrass ourselves last night.”
Alex smiled.
“Then what’s up? Worried about the kids at school if they see me giving you another ride?”
“Some music thing. Do you think I’m over-dressed?”
“But Junior’s all squishy!” Faith called back, not opening her eyes. She missed Dean’s pained look, and the warning glance he sent at Junior, before turning back to their planning. Junior wrapped his arms around her, and kissed her temple again.
'Faith? Sweetie? You're making me a little dizzy.'
“I think so. I hope so. I hate being pregnant. I miss flying.”
'Or maybe you'll disappear again. And I'm not down with that.'
“It keeps them quiet and busy, normally.” Dean told him when it was clear Mary was lost in her own creative-food world.
'So?'
“Dean, I’m serious! It’s big news.”
“Claire? Maybe it’s not a good idea to have your friends here.”
“I actually wasn’t thinking about sex. I was thinking about how Mom’s going to take the news, how the others are all going to react, that kind of thing.”
“Cas, did you need a drink? Where’s the bar?” He was squeezing Castiel’s hand hard, “Excuse us,” Dean passed Lucifer, not trying to bend around him, and Castiel followed him willingly into the centre of the room, their hands still gripping on to each other. Luke had undone the confidence that Castiel had felt, but Dean was there like a life buoy, keeping him safe from a total meltdown. He grabbed two glasses from a passing waiter, and pulled Castiel into the corner of the room, handing a glass over.
'You know I think that's a compliment to the orphanage.'
'So, this is when she was first born. Dean was keeping me in the dark then, and I think he told me he was getting ammunition when he went to see her. She was only a couple hours old there. And that's Cas with her-'
She shook her head, smiling fondly at him. If you had asked Faith, growing up, what her father would be like, she would never have come close to describing Dean. He turned off the light and she shuffled across the mattress towards him, and snuggled in close. He laughed, and placed a tentative hand on her bulging stomach.
“So, is this Dean-screwed-up or something else?”
“Right, sure.” Claire nodded. “You actually lived in the eighties.”
“Never.” Castiel was vehement. “Never. It’s just that I was happy to plod along with pleasant as was your mother. I didn’t think passion existed, that it was anything but transient and worthless as a result. But having you opened my eyes to the fact that maybe Amelia and I had settled. And beyond that, though she was beautiful and warm and kind-hearted, I never found her attractive. I would find my head turning towards men. I told myself it was because they were speaking, or relevant in some way.”
“I’m your brother, Ben. That’s got to be good enough.”
'Because you're so timid. Relax, okay? No one's going to eat your heart out. And hey, while we're here, we can have proper Philly cheesesteaks.'
Castiel took the makeshift ice pack away from his lip for Dean to inspect, though he kept his distance. After all, Dean had been the cause of these injuries. Castiel had thought that Dean was about to kill him with an angel blade, and had barely escaped that injury. He had lain in the main room of the bunker for a good hour, replaying the scene before Dean had shown a glimpse of remorse and offered to help nurse the injuries that he had created. That Cain’s Mark had made. Castiel had to believe that it wasn’t Dean who would hurt him so badly, who would even consider ending Castiel’s existence. He had to believe it was Dean who aimed the blade at the book in the end. If he didn’t believe that, his heart would break.
They turned to face each other together.
“Of course not,” Sam smiled. “When’s the wedding?”
'We grew up in an orphanage. We used to hunt at the weekend, but Faith graduated early, and wanted to do it full time.' Dax said quietly, still gazing at Sam with borderline admiration. 'She's good, Sam.'
“Then I’ll sit on you.”
“Uh, hi, Mr Winchester,” she spluttered out. Claire ignored it.
“I don’t know Sam. It’s not been long. We haven’t thought about anything practical. For now, I’m just going to keep in touch with him and plan when to see him again. Then we can talk about all that stuff.”
'I think the plants outside would love a good watering. Feel like getting your fingers green, Sam?'
Castiel felt his chest burning with sadness. He could picture that photograph in the Winchester’s front room, of baby Charlie, toddler Sam, and a young Dean who seemed furious. But clearly he hadn’t been. He had just lost his mother. Castiel wanted to ask more questions, but he didn’t want to pry at the same time. They weren’t in ‘that place’ yet.
“I’m not.”
“Look, it’s the lesbians!” Two boys from their class pushed their way onto the table. Alex grabbed her tray as it got knocked to the side, stopping it from spilling onto the floor. “When are you going to make out at school?”
Someone knocked on his door, and when he opened it, it was to find Kevin standing there nervously.
“Do you want to talk?”
“Do you think that’s where Olympus is? Amongst the stars?” Dean asked out loud.
“Did I see you saying goodbye to Sam?”
“I don’t know,” she said slowly, trying to ignore the way Jack’s smile dimmed when she didn’t jump at the chance. “Maybe Jack and I should hang out today, and then I could let you know?”
“That would be great! But no street hockey. Not with a firecracker like you.”
“Shut up.”
“Look, stop being nervous, it’s going to be fine. I know how to behave when other people are around. They’ll love me.”
She stalked out of the room and slammed the door behind her, and Dax found himself putting a hand over his heart, rubbing the skin on his scrawny chest worriedly. She would eat his heart, wouldn't she?
Meg never asked that, but Castiel was grateful for it. He shook his head, unwilling to talk further in front of Charlie.
She hugged him back tightly, the smile on her face feeling just as big as his usual one.
“So, these are all your brothers and sisters?” Chuck asked Dean as he snapped off their lids. Castiel accepted his bottle and felt grateful that it was ice cold - the day had been warm, and the cold beer was going to be refreshing.
“So we’re on a break?”
'You did, but we're family. Nothing's more important to my brother than family. And who else but family can bug you even when you love them?'
He left his bedroom, and looked around for any sign of gifts, any birds or pear trees or dancing girls. The bunker was clear, of everything but Sam reading through a book in the main meeting room.
“You’re in a good mood. Where’s he taking you tonight?”
“So long as we get you back.”
'So, what're you reading? Case notes?'
“I like Castiel.” She nodded. “And that’s the only reason I’m going to cope with saying goodbye.”
“Love means different things to different people, Claire,” Castiel sat forward, ignoring his drink. “And love can be different each time. Look at me and your mother, and how that’s different to me and Dean. I love them both, in different ways. And I love you in another way entirely. I know you love Amelia, and you love me, and Dean’s someone you love and don’t like to admit to it.”
“Dean,” Benny smiled tenderly. “You’re a great soldier, and you’ll do an incredible job with the next rookie. Make me proud. And thank you for a wonderful last night.”
Claire looked at her cousin, and he grinned innocently at her.
“That’s a fair point. Okay.”
“But Devon didn’t make those comments?” Dean pressed. Claire looked down at her hand clasped in her fathers.
“Yes, I quite like him.”
"But you're my brother. Half-brother."
'Sort of. Look, this isn't my place, it's my friends. Maybe he has some gas you could use, I don't know. Um, look, come in for a sec, I'll see if he can do that, or give you a bed for the night. You look tired. Um, just a sec,' she dashed back inside, and Dax stepped forward into the doorway.
“Yes. Thank you Cas, so much.”
'Fat lot of good that did, huh?'
Claire had never heard Dean talk like that, like he had so much going on in his head and weighed out every single argument. He hid his intelligence pretty well. No wonder her father was in love with him.

'That seemed too easy,' Sam sighed. Castiel looked at him seriously.

“Cool. Let’s go.”
“Yeah,” Dean sighed, and opened his eyes. “And hey, I’m sorry about Mary earlier. A lot of people around here … they’d go biblical if they knew we were married.”

He cocked the rim of the hat up for a moment, just long enough for them to see it was Dean, before pulling it low again. Claire grinned at her father.
'Like I said, resembles Deano way too much.' Gabe winked at Faith. 'I've known you were around since Balthazar spilled the beans. Just before you disappeared? I mean, Balthazar said he had nothing to do with it, but that loud-mouthed Brit didn't think-'
