It was nearly like John could see the fawn come to life off the page, with the magnificently drawn picture, and the images from Fawnlock's own mind he got through their bond.
He briefly takes John's hand, squeezing his friend's fingers with a slight smile. He lets go and follows John to the foyer, head tilted as he examines the floor rug
Kneeling down on the bank, he watched the fawn bathe, John chuckled and brushed back the damp curls, leaning in and pressing a kiss to the center of his forehead, to which the Fawn gave a soft bleat at, leaning forward slightly.
'Why does everybody have to be so stupid?' The younger Holmes asks himself, though Mycroft wasn't stupid, Sherlock knows his brother is brilliant, despite his prominent idiocy.
John fiddles with his roasting stick, looking to Sherlock, "No.... I've never had a bonfire before so no. What happens?" John asks earnestly, he definitely wanted to know. He loved hearing things from Sherlock.
With that explanation, John laughed, shaking his head with a smile. "Its just a turn of phrase...it just means perform your taken. In this case, your basket weaving." John watched those quick fingers knit the leaves together, glancing up and seeing the adorable look of concentration on the fawn's face. He nearly reached forwards and squished Fawnlock's cheeks, but managed to keep still until he'd finished
"Brother, I know you're curious about John and I's.. Unusual bond," the fawn didn't like to think of their mating that way, but still, Fawnlovk felt it was easier to just try his best to appease his brother and King.
As his mate whined out his name, turning it into something else entirely, John grinned even wider and exhaled out over the flushed tip of the fawn's prick, his warm breath bathing over the sensitive tissue.
"Three adults and two children," Mycroft informs the attendant. It does not occur to him that being under the age of sixteen... he is still technically a child.
"There is a bin just under the sink."  John tells Sherlock, eating the last of his dumplings.  His pork fried rice half eaten - he prefers his dumplings more than anything, he can save it for a snack later or bring it for lunch tomorrow.
John rubbed at Fawnlock's cheek for a moment, knowing he'd want an explanation, "It's a kiss. A press of lips that shows affection between two people. Friends, family, lovers. I suppose it's what humans do instead of nuzzle. It can be done on cheeks as well, any part of the body really." John slid his fingers back up into Fawnlock's hair, stroking it in a soothing drag. "It can have different meanings...there are different sorts of kisses. It's just a way to show someone that you care about them." The fawn's ears flicked as he pursed his lips in thought. His eyes fluttered closed slightly as he bowed his head, momentarily sucked into the depths of his mind. When his gaze moved back up to John's, his tail thumped the nest and he leaned forward once more to press his lips to John's cheek. The little kiss pressed to his cheek made John's smile grow wider. Obviously the fawn was trying out the gesture for himself, which was endearing and sweet.
It takes forever to get the last light cues programmed. The actors are rehearsing in costume for the first time, and a few small things happen, as always. Adriana’s blouse is too tight around the wrist to accommodate the tube for the vomit. The tube chafes her, and they need to readjust. A hundred little things that were clear in the rehearsal room need small adjustments for the larger space, the longer walks.
John looks at him with a mixture of tired anger, exasperation and amusement. “What day is it, Sherlock?”
He grabs Sherlock’s coat lapels and spins him around, walking him back until they’re tumbling onto John’s too-narrow bed.
“Opening a bakery in central London is more akin to buying a lottery ticket. And I have no desire to invest in something you will sooner or later tire off, discard and walk away from, like you have done with everything else so far. School, University, any job you have ever had. You always get bored. Why should this be different?”
Moriarty sighs and takes a step closer to Sherlock. “Well, thank you for taking an interest in her. It means a lot.” He stresses the last few words, lending the platitude surprising weight. He takes another step closer to Sherlock, and John can't help himself, he neatly steps between them, effectively preventing Moriarty from getting closer to Sherlock. He doesn't exactly know why, but he doesn't want this man anywhere near Sherlock.
Sherlock’s lips twitch in spite of himself. “If you’re trying to find out whether I’m single or not, you’re not being subtle about it.”
On Monday, they get an e-mail about the theme for next week: Tea time. Technical is Victoria Sponge, and showstopper is supposed to be a sweet and a savoury bake to the theme of afternoon tea, and either the sweet or the savoury has to be scones. This is going to be tedious in the extreme, especially the Victoria sponge.
John nods at the floor. “Can you maybe hand me my cane? I’m a bit afraid I’ll faceplant on the floor if you let me go now.”
John smiles. Sherlock’s a little more overt with his mother-henning since he came back from the dead, but he’s still most incautious with simple kindnesses when John is asleep.
“We can’t all have quaint Austrian grandmothers who bake unpronounceable pastries,” Sherlock says dryly.
Sherlock gets his jams out of the fridge and uses the moment his face is hidden to breathe deeply. John is right. This is real, and he needs to manage his expectations. It’s difficult, though, because hope is singing through his veins, stronger and more potent than any drug.
Sherlock hums non-committedly, then turns to the fridge for the milk. “What about Mike? Why isn’t he taking meetings with Lestrade about lighting?”
John lies back down with his head pillowed on Sherlock’s chest. “I don’t have many friends,” John says quietly, and it seems like a non sequitur, but it really isn’t. “The people I knew from before… do you know what it’s like, when you know people, and then something happens, something that changes you so profoundly that the person you used to be doesn’t exist anymore? And the people you knew before still think you’re that person, and you can’t bear it when they find out you’re not?”
Kitty shrugs. “I don't know. They were setting up some kind of contraption. They used a very big rock, looked a bit like a Fey'a crystal.”
John holds up a placating hand. “We’ll go with you,” he says, also speaking Feyara, though he knows his pronunciation is horrible.
He leaves out the back door, and finds Sherlock leaning against the wall next to the kitchen. “Ready?”
John grabs his coat sleeve to stop him from going, and Sherlock turns around, looking at him questioningly.
John, for his part, sees nothing that would give him any clue to the mystery. But then, he notices an odd sound.  A humming, almost. It’s so soft and so deep he feels it more than hears it.
He makes it three steps up the stairs, then all the fight leaves him and he sits down, surrendering to the panic.
“Worth the wait,” John mutters, and the feel of Sherlock’s laughter against his body is almost better than the sex.
“Fuck,” John mutters against his shoulder, voice gravelly and rough. He looks well-fucked and absolutely debauched, and Sherlock’s heart does a traitorous little stutter when John smiles at him, loose and warm and sated.
He can’t look away. And at the same time he is utterly incapable of expressing, even in the deepest recesses of his mind, why a few inches of reddened, peeling skin encapsulate everything in his life that makes it worth living.
They’re sent out of the tent for the usual money shots of the bakes, and usually Sherlock would go outside for a cigarette, but it’s still raining, so the contestants all huddle together around the tea urn.
He’s vaguely aware that John has turned off the camera, that John is walking him back until he’s sitting on the kitchen table, that his legs are wrapping around John to keep him close and pull him closer.
He smiles at her gratefully and returns gentle pressure on her hand. “I think that’s probably for the best right now.”
When John finally pushes in, it’s all too much for a moment. Sherlock closes his eyes and breathes, and John says, gently, “Sherlock. Look at me.”
And god, that’s true. He wants, wants to feel Sherlock inside of him, wants to have him underneath him and completely gone with pleasure, wants to claim him and own him and never let him up for air.
Sherlock restrains himself from making a sexually suggestive comment about handcuffs. They are sort of in public, after all. Instead, he looks at the pictures again. Tiny workspace, tiny oven, ancient equipment. No wonder John crushes walnuts with a rolling pin. He has no other equipment at home.
But then he drags John off to another adventure excavating mouse remains or sneaking down to the beach to look for fossils, and John forgives him for being an obnoxious arsehole, because he’s also brilliant, and funny, and makes the world a magical place by his ability to look at it like a giant fascinating mysterious puzzle box just waiting to be solved.
“Billy, this is John Watson,” Sherlock says, gesturing at John. “I want you to give him back his watch.”
He turns to John, who’s filming on his phone. “So, rules of the mini-Bake Off,“ John explains. “Mike, Neela, Irene, Janine, Mary, Molly and I each made Sherlock a birthday cake. Now Sherlock has to decide on a winner. There are only two rules. One, he only gets to know who made which cake after he’s picked the winner, and two, it’s not about the quality of the bake,” John says, and with the last words, he looks directly at Sherlock. “You need to decide which one you
“So this mini Bake Off between Sherlock and myself is about a philosophical difference on the subject of Sachertorte,” John explains while Sherlock is filming him. “Sachertorte was invented in the 19th century by a young man named Sacher, who was working for a very famous bakery in Vienna called Demel. So Demel claims their Sachertorte is the original, but Sacher left Demel to found his own business, the Cafe Sacher, and they claim that he took the original recipe with him, therefore theirs is the original. The difference being of course that the Sacher recipe has a layer of apricot jam in the middle, and the Demel recipe doesn’t. So Sherlock and I will make a Sachertorte. He’ll use the Demel recipe, the boring one with jam only under the chocolate icing. I will use the original, classic and obviously superior method with a layer of jam in the middle.”
Sherlock walks out two minutes after him, and for a second, they just look at each other. There’s an expression in Sherlock’s eyes he can’t categorise, but when their eyes meet, John feels that thing again, that cliff-edge, knife-edge, poking-a-tiger feeling.
Sherlock pauses, and starts a bit when he feels John’s fingers entwine with his. He doesn’t say anything, but the squeeze of his hands encourages Sherlock to go on. “Victor started backsliding almost immediately, and he sort of pulled me along, and we went right back to it as if nothing had happened. Most of our friends were junkies. We lived in a bad neighbourhood. Neither of us had a job or were especially close with our parents. No structure, no goals. Just overactive brains screaming how boring life is, both unable to find a more constructive outlet. It made it worse, in a way. That he understood so perfectly how boring everything was.” He pauses again, and John’s fingers tighten around his. The silence stretches, and Sherlock isn’t sure whether he wants to continue.
It’s Tuesday, and Sherlock is making a large batch of rosehip-currant jam. He has an order for ten kilos from Angelo’s, who’s using it as filling for bomboloni, and he’s stirring the large vat in his kitchen.
“Then why didn’t you?” John asks, and there it is, in his voice, a sliver of anger, at last. “Don’t you think I would’ve gone with you to wherever you went? Don’t you think I would’ve done
With a nods at both of them, Molly leaves. John sighs in relief and gingerly puts his shirt back on. He winces slightly, then gazes up at Sherlock, who’s still looking at him with a small worried frown line between his brows.
Was this just an impulsive reaction to John defending him? Sherlock is deeply uncomfortable with showing emotion, John knows this. Maybe he didn’t know how to show John he’s grateful and just did the first thing that came to mind.
John’s lips twitch in a brief smile. “Granted, not the most original question to ask someone you meet in a kitchen at one in the morning.”
Sherlock waves away the question as an irrelevant detail. Mr Chatterjee will say yes, he’s sure of it. He was devastated when he had to close, he’d gladly re-open, especially if Sherlock promises to do half the work. “Use my trust fund as collateral.”
Sherlock runs a hand through his hair, a highly uncharacteristic gesture of uncertainty. “Look into her mouth,” he says, barely audibly.
“Well, some of us.” John pauses for a second. Then he steps back and gestures at the table. “We all thought it was completely unacceptable that you don’t have a birthday cake, so we, um, kind of, made you some?”
Then he goes back to setting up his workstation, trying very very hard not to think about why he just did this. Experiment,he tells himself. See whether the mug is enough to make them assume the station is taken. Just an experiment. That’s all it is.
“How do you mean?” John asks, sitting up a bit straighter, because this seems like a conversation he should be moderately alert for.
It occurred to Sherlock as he watched John drink himself into a stupor after Sherlock’s funeral that making one’s best friend watch one committ suicide might be objectively unforgiveable, no matter how good one’s reasons.
You did not specify this. You just wrote ‘Add raisins’. And your ingredient list just says ‘raisins’.
The train is full of children like him, with handed-down, faded, ill-fitting clothes, clutching their few meagre possessions to themselves, trying not to show how scared they are.
Sherlock blinks, tries to formulate a coherent reply. “I wouldn't expect you to understand. You never had a friend,” he whispers, quietly, sadly, and then he closes his eyes and stops resisting unconsciousness.
Sherlock’s own bake is in the oven. The pumpkin-pistachio filling smells amazing, and the filo is browning perfectly.
“Bugger all,” he mutters, but there’s nothing he can do about it now. He’ll apologise tomorrow. Right now he has to find Sherlock.
Sherlock dislikes pink. He dislikes food colouring, and he dislikes marzipan. He dislikes this challenge, period. Two hours aren’t enough to properly cool down the sponges. He would like to make his own marzipan, but there isn’t time and he wasn’t allowed to bring it. Apricot jam is boring. His socks are still drying from wading to the tent in the rain.
They’re lounging in the armchairs before the fireplace, and it’s odd, because Sherlock has this sense of deja vu again, just seeing John sitting in the squishy red armchair Sherlock never especially liked. The fire is lit, the room is dim and cozy in a way Sherlock didn’t know it could be. John is half-dressed in a t-shirt, pants and one of Sherlock’s ancient dressing gowns. The fine hair on his bare legs catches the firelight. It’s oddly distracting.
Most of the others get criticism for their bottoms, or their fillings, or their crust, or all three. The woman whose filling oozed out of the pie form starts to cry.
Sherlock nods. “A young Sergeant named Donovan. She thinks the victim took it herself, and I can’t even argue, because it’s the only theory supported by the facts,” he says, voice dripping with disdain.
He walks over to the table he’s commandeered as his own and hands Sherlock the script. “I’ve highlighted the cuts in a different colour for you, I figured it would be easier for you to know which lines to delete than the other way around.”
“Well, I’m going to be honest here, I’m not really good at this, so I’m doing a chocolate sponge with a sun in the middle.”
Before he can stop himself, Sherlock leans in and mutters, “Anderson, too much flour and he’s overworked the batter. Mike is over-whipping the cream even as we speak, Janine’s sponge is under-baked and will sag in the middle, Mary forgot the vanilla extract she wanted to put in.”
John sucks in a breath to speak and then lets it out again. He can’t do it. He still has no idea what to say. “Good night, Sherlock,” he finally says.
So Sherlock says very little, but he’s aware that John is watching him quite a lot, eyes flicking over to Sherlock and then away again several times. He’s also aware of a low-level interest in all of their interactions from the rest of the table, especially John’s sister and Mary. Every time John and Sherlock speak to each other - and they’re only exchanging the most inane comments - heads noticeably turn and everyone is trying to parse what exactly is going on between them. Because even a week ago, they would probably have arrived at this thing together, and Sherlock would be sitting too close to John, and John would probably have a casually possessive hand on Sherlock’s thigh. But now there’s a palpable distance between them, and even though Sherlock knows why it’s there, and that it’s entirely his fault, it’s still highly unpleasant, and he would give nearly everything to be sitting too close to John and to feel his fingers dig into Sherlock’s thigh. But Sherlock knows that if he wants that, he has to take everything, the good nights and the bad, a bed that contains nightmares as well as sex, the strings attached, the commitment as well as the intimacy, the ugly fights as well as the sleepy mornings. He isn’t remotely ready for that, and he very much doubts that John will just wait around for him until he is.
When the souffles are in the oven, Mr Chatterjee smiles at Sherlock, suddenly, and it takes twenty years off his face. “I’ve forgotten how much fun baking can be.” He makes a face. “I was just never that good at it.”
“Yes.” Sherlock gestures at his chemical equipment. “A plant-based poison similar to belladonna. Easy to obtain.”
“Yes, because giving the ex who broke your heart another shot at it is easier than figuring out the logistical details of marrying the woman you love,” John says quietly, so Sherlock won’t hear.
She’s already there when he arrives, clutching her coffee mug to warm her hands.  It’s December and unusually cold for London. The air smells of snow, and Sherlock estimates that by Christmas Day at the latest the city will be covered in white that will quickly turn to slush.
Sherlock has to smile at that. “Head stuff? You are a doctor, right? I may have to ask to see your medical license.”
Sherlock shrugs. “If you wanted to kill me to eliminate me from the competition, you could have gone about it a bit more subtly.”
Sherlock ignores the question and finishes unplugging the fridge and exchanges it with the unit from his work station, and plugs it back in. He then rolls the now unplugged fridge to his work station.
“Once more into the breach, then?” John asks, and his tone is both fondly amused and vaguely sad, making Sherlock painfully aware that this is indeed the last time they’re doing this.
The nurse checks the chart. “You John Watson? She said to tell you,” he reads from a piece of paper, “concussion, sprained ankle, it’s her own damned fault for getting up that ladder with Mike in the condition he was in, and you still need to fix the downstage left moving light?”
John nudges Sherlock’s head up with his hand in his hair. “Do you honestly think that after nine years, I don’t know exactly what I’m getting into with you? And as for lying and hurting, I’ve done plenty of that to you too. And yet you’re still here.  And I’m still here. You know why? Because we fit, you and me. We always have.”
The two fairies exchange a few words in their odd, melodic language and then the one who spoke before says, “The Gate that brought you to Dera.” Her tone suggests that she thinks they're a bit slow.
John is competent, yes, but he’s messy, he barely ever measures anything and he’s clearly not even really trying to do something innovative.
For a while, they just sit there, quietly, and Sherlock thinks that maybe he should go, maybe he’s intruding, but he can’t bring himself to leave John alone like this.
Greg, who’s directing the production John is currently rehearsing, rubs a hand over his face. He looks like he hasn’t slept much, if at all. “Good morning to you too, John, thanks, I’m well, would you care for a cuppa?”
It was a grave mistake on his part, because what happened next - and he really should have seen this coming - was that a highly enraged John Watson showed up in Mycroft’s office and nearly murdered Mycroft with his bare hands.
“Don’t worry about it.” John lets down his shirt as she straightens. “All right, I’m off then. Thanks for everything, Molly.”
“Where’s your cake?” John asks, sitting down opposite Sherlock at the kitchen table. It’s late afternoon, and John hasn’t been at work today, they’ve been puttering around the kitchen since before lunch.
His mind seamlessly integrated the knowledge that he loves John Watson into his operating system, and when Sherlock realised the update was complete - around the time he came back and saw that bloody awful mustache and
Sherlock looks her up and down. “You tried to quit smoking recently and failed, and you’re late so often because your bicycle breaks down on the way to the theatre.” He points at her bitten cuticles and the smear of bicycle oil on her jeans. “You should tell the crew, they’d dislike you less if they knew.”
The Savoy is lit up by hundreds of Christmas lights and trees. It’s already snowing lightly by the time Sherlock enters. Children are carolling in the foyer. It smells of cinnamon and Christmas punch. It’s enough to make one sick to one’s stomach.
He doesn’t feel sober, though. He feels slightly punch-drunk with a soft, heart-tugging joy and a tingling want under his skin for John’s hands all over him, and it’s as exhilarating as it is scary. He keeps telling himself it’s just for another few weeks, and then it will be over, there’s no reason to be alarmed. But as he glances over at John, who’s getting hugged by Molly a bit too tightly if the pained smile on his face is anything to go by, he knows he’s kidding himself.
The bruising kiss gave way to light, sweet pecks, which gave way to the two of them on the ground, Sherlock on his back and the professor hovering over him, with their foreheads pressed together and neither moving. They stayed like this for a while, but then, finally, the professor sighed and stood up, shattering the serenity. Sherlock opened his eyes and sat up, watching as the professor pulled on his pants and trousers. Then, the man grabbed his wand and said, “Accio rag,” which summoned a cloth of some kind from the professor’s office. He then cast the aguamenti spell on it and tossed the now damp rag to Sherlock, who used it to wipe the professor’s cum from his stomach.
Finally, the professor came, his ejaculate spraying out onto John’s right leg, which was splayed ungracefully between himself and the professor. It was hot and sticky, and John felt his cock twitch in arousal. Once the professor had successfully pleasured himself, he leaned forward and gave John a bruising kiss, pressing their lips together so hard that John was sure his would be swollen tomorrow.
Just then, the professor arrived at their table and handed them a syllabus of what they’d be covering in class for the next fifteen weeks. Sherlock snatched it up and scanned it over before tossing it aside and groaning.
“I-I don’t really know,” John answered honestly, still rather confused about what he was doing here. He went to glance at the woman who had led him in, but found that she was no longer at his side. In fact, she wasn’t even in the room anymore. She had left, and closed the door behind her, so that it was only John and the mystery man now. He fingered his wand in his robe pocket, still trying to think of any spell that could help him get out of this situation, but nothing was coming to him.
If Sherlock had known some spell to magic both of their clothes off, he would have cast it here and now. Instead, he just nodded his consent, and that was apparently all that the professor needed. The man stepped forward and used one hand to pull Sherlock into the bruising kiss of his fantasies while the other hand slid down, deftly unbuttoned Sherlock’s trousers, and slid into Sherlock’s pants to grasp at his cock. Sherlock moaned into the professor’s mouth, and the professor smiled.
“W-What? But can’t I go with you?” John asked fearfully, gripping Sherlock’s sleeve. Sherlock shook him off, and then gently pushed his new friend towards the giant.
“I never said that.” The words came quick to John’s lips, before he’d even known that he was going to say it. He felt his cheeks flush hot, but he wasn’t sure if it was from embarrassment or the way it looked as though the professor was undressing him with his eyes.
“I wanted to say hi!” John said cheerfully, grabbing a piece of bacon and chomping down on it. “I tried to get your attention earlier, but you were reading, so I decided to come to you.”
“No. I think it makes perfect sense. Believe it or not, I actually like you. You challenge me academically, which is nice, because nobody else in our year does. So it doesn’t actually astound me that someone else might want to be your friend, too.”
“It appears so, Miss Hawkins,” the professor answered, his tone somewhat bored. It seemed that he was just as unsurprised as John was that her potion was perfect. After all, she was the best in their class, much to John’s agitation. It probably wouldn’t have bothered John as much if she would just own up to being the best, but instead she used it as an excuse to come on to Professor Holmes, acting all modest while simultaneously impressing him with her skill. If the professor were a normal man, her attempts at seducing him might have actually worked. But from what John had observed in the two years that the man had been the potions master here at Hogwarts, the professor wasn’t and would never be attracted to anybody, much less a student.
At first, he tried to convince himself that what caught his attention was the fact that the boy was quite obviously a few years older than most of the students in this class. Not by an incredibly wide margin—at most he was 24 years old. He then told himself that he had noticed the cane, something that most twenty-something uni students didn’t normally possess. Then he silently insisted that it must have been the boy’s obvious army background that made him stare quite unabashedly.
The professor—it felt a little weird to call him Sherlock now that they weren’t in the throes of passion—studied John’s face for a moment before shaking his head. He then reached down, unbuckled his own belt, and then tugged his trousers and pants down just enough to set his erection free. Then, without breaking eye contact with John, he began wanking himself off, slowly at first, and then picking up speed and rhythm. It was, by far, the hottest thing John had ever seen—and he’d just watched this same man give him a blowie.
For a moment, they just look at each other quietly, and Sherlock feels at once enormously privileged and intimidated by John’s raw honesty. “You definitely shouldn’t say that on telly.”
He can’t stay on the landing forever. But five minutes more won’t hurt anyone. So he sits down on the steps and closes his eyes and lets the music tug at that space in his chest.
The entire episode of his return from the dead has shown impressively how very unfit he is for this. He’s the one who thought pranking his best friend after two years of letting him grieve was a good idea, after all. And Sherlock is terrified that he will do something similar again, that he will hurt John again, that this time, he will break something that can’t be repaired.
John was right about the judging, it nearly puts Sherlock to sleep, and he isn’t sleep-deprived. Well, not any more than he normally is.
She cocks her head to the side and looks at him appraisingly. “All right. You can make yourself useful and hold my instruments.”
He wants his own bed; he wants a door that locks the world out. He wants Mrs Hudson downstairs and John upstairs and himself in the middle, sandwiched between people who care about him, maybe too much for their own good.
It’s two in the morning when Sherlock finally stumbles in, literally tripping over the doorstep into the room.
John’s hesitation is obvious as he shifts from one foot to another and clenches his left hand reflexively.
it every night. He could just go upstairs with John and strip him and touch him all over and have him in every way imaginable, and John would let him, would encourage him even, and with every hit, Sherlock would get more addicted, more dependent, more strung out when John’s not around.
“Well, your curiosity must remain unsatisfied,” Sherlock says and turns on his heels to go looking for a cigarette before he verbally eviscerates Irene or any of the others. He would love to, but it would make the coming weeks awkward, and John wouldn’t like it. Why it should matter what John thinks is beyond Sherlock, but somehow, it does.
The boys are welcomed by a motherly matron who introduces herself as Mrs. Higgins, the housekeeper. An elderly gentleman waits for them in the grand entrance hall. John tries hard not to stare, but it’s by far the grandest place he’s ever seen.
And right now Sherlock feels the active absence acutely, like a tiny hole somewhere in his chest cavity, bleeding silence into his body.
Sherlock walks out of the tent as soon as Glen yells cut and calls a break to set up for the food porn shots. He keeps walking until he can’t see the tent anymore and leans against a tree for a much-needed cigarette.
Indeed, when they approach one of the men guarding the city gates, he takes one look at them and frowns. “What’re you two supposed to be?”
Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner move on to John, who’s whipping cream with the air of somebody who’s done little else in his life. “You’re not going to over-whip that, are you?” Mrs Turner asks with a glance back at Sherlock.
Mrs Turner is enjoying the moment, though, and is taking her sweet time. “Well, I love Sachertorte. I lived in Vienna for two years after culinary school, and I worked in this charming Cafe in the first district, a smoke-filled hole in the wall with cheap coffee and good cake. Our regulars were nearly all students, who’d stretch out a coffee to last them the afternoon, and who chain-smoked while waving around Mao’s Red Book and talking about a revolution.”
He’s also wearing glasses. Thin, horn-rimmed glasses. Somehow, that little, insignificant detail hits Sherlock like a sledgehammer. Sherlock has never seen these glasses before. He’s been observing John’s deteriorating eyesight since the moment they met, but he’d estimated that it would take at least two more years for it to become so bad that John would stoop to actually seeing an ophthalmologist. But apparently, sometime during the year Sherlock was gone, John’s eyesight deteriorated enough for him to get glasses. Of course Sherlock immediately wants to pluck them from John’s nose and examine them in detail, and a whole catalogue of questions develops in Sherlock’s brain. How strong are they? Does he have contacts? Does he need them to read? To work? To drive?
John is still staring at Sherlock, rooted to the spot. Sherlock looks like he spent the last day and a half playing a rough and tumble game of rugby. His clothes are dirty, his hair is tousled and there’s an excited gleam in his eyes. “John, would you fetch Billy something to eat, please?” Sherlock repeats, and in an unobserved moment, he actually winks at John.
Chuckles all around, and Sherlock bites his tongue, because he really just wants to get this over with. He needs to cut and upload this video, and he would like to get this done as soon as possible, because he has plans with John before the night is up.
“A little after 2 am. Have some more water,” John says and puts the straw back into Sherlock’s mouth.
And the real problem is of course that Sherlock not only completely and utterly underestimated how much John loves him, he also completely and utterly underestimated how much he loves John. Being without John is excruciating. For both of them, it seems.
Sherlock’s heartbeat picks up noticeably, and arousal spikes all over his body. “Please do,” he says, his own voice matching the tone of John’s, low and raw and wanting.
“A little after 2 am,” John says, gently disentangling himself from Sherlock’s grasp. “I’ll get you a glass of water.”
Billy grins, highly amused by John’s embarrassment. “All right, don’t want to offend no sensibilities, here. But you know, all the stuff you do with girls, the fun stuff, you know, hand and mouth stuff and all that, you can do that with boys, too. And there’s always the arse-”
“Thank you!” Mary notes down something in the binder. “Lilies or roses? I mean, I hate roses, so lilies, I guess?”
“Our showstopper challenge today is Afternoon Tea. Our contestants have four hours to prepare an afternoon tea spread for our judges. They need to do at least one sweet and one savoury bake, and they can do whatever they want. Bakers, on your mark, get set, bake.”
"That wouldn't be very smart," Sherlock points out, but he's not moving, and he feels his eyes grow heavy.
Sherlock picks up, glad that nobody can see how much his hands are shaking with exhaustion and nerves. "John."
Sherlock snorts. “You have plenty of other clients. Mummy, for one. Father, for another.” He gropes around for an especially nasty way to imply that it’s Mycroft’s way of contributing to the family business, seeing as he’s completely without any artistic ability, but he can’t find a good turn of phrase for the old insult right now, which is a sign of just how little he wants to have this conversation. “Can we just go and have dinner with them in peace?”
Sherlock takes a sip of tea and allows himself to enjoy the warm smoothness of it. “I did, I distinctly remember it.”
Finally, Sherlock stops a few paces away from where John is sitting. “Look,” he says, pointing at the earth. “Something was dug up here.”
“You do realise the sandwiches in the catering tent will probably be soggy, nearly tasteless and salmonella-infested?”
Sherlock is quiet for a bit as he thinks about it. It’s… not a completely terrible idea. Especially given the platform he has right now. Bake Off is astonishingly popular, apparently.
It’s nearing midnight when they return to Baker Street. They’ve charged Billy and the Irregulars with looking for Kitty, as they’re far better at this than Sherlock or John, so they’ve done all they can for now. John hasn’t eaten since lunchtime, and he’s ravenous despite everything. He’s raiding the cupboards when Mrs Hudson comes into the kitchen, in her nightgown. She smiles at John and makes tea unasked, and when she hugs him John lets her, laying his head on her shoulder. She smells of chamomile and the beeswax soap she makes, and she’s very likely the closest thing John will ever again have to a mother.
Mycroft gives Sherlock another infuriatingly superior smile. “I will speak to you later, Sherlock. Dr Watson.” He inclines his head in John’s direction and leaves without another word.
From one second to the next he was homeless, friendless, rootless, a ghost, a memory, a trick of the imagination.
With that, he’s gone out the back door, and John makes his way up to the ground floor to face the day, a little envious of Sherlock. It’s a lovely day, and John would like nothing more than to roam the streets looking for adventure, but duty calls, and John follows.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but takes the offered cup. “I seriously hope the challenges are going to get a bit less tedious when the field narrows down somewhat.”
Sherlock loves this room. When John was living here alone, during the time he always thinks of as Before, he used to come up here and sit in the middle of the room on the floor, just soaking up the John Watson-ness of the room, deducing facts about John from his clothing, his aftershave, his shoes, the dearth of his personal belongings.
John laughs, grinning widely at Sherlock, one of those smiles that make him look ten years younger, and Sherlock thinks, even as his heartbeat picks up and he can’t help smiling back,
Sherlock blinks at their surroundings, disoriented after their interminable time in the elevator. He doesn’t quite feel like the same person who entered it just a few short hours ago.
"I was looking forward to the Christmas party tonight. Mrs Hudson made gingerbread," John grumbles as he settles down, burrowing into Sherlock in a way that makes Sherlock’s heart twist pleasantly.
Sherlock shrugs and closes the fridge. “Apparently he thinks it’s giving him an advantage. Stupid, really. It-” Sherlock falls silent as footsteps crunch on the gravel path outside the tent.
“Great Mother, no wonder you and Holmes are both so uptight,” he gasps out, still laughing. “You’re both the most virgin of all the virgins I’ve ever known.”
“Partly, I suppose,” John muses, and Sherlock’s eyes snap to him, because he didn’t actually think John was going to admit to anything of the sort. “I’m so angry with Mary I could fill a football stadium with it.” He looks at Sherlock like the sight of him is physically painful to him, and Sherlock just wants to get up and go. He can’t, though, because this is the first time John has spoken to him, words that matter, since Mary died, and he feels trapped between hope and fear, and he doesn’t know which feels worse. “But that doesn’t mean I’m not angry with you as well.”
Sherlock was right, of course. She was poor, lived by the river and made her living by cleaning and taking in washing.
It’s hours later, and John is still sitting in a chair by Sherlock’s bed, waiting for him to wake up. He’s read every newspaper he could find in the entire hospital and he’s bored out of his skull.
John hangs up the phone and lets it fall onto his nightstand with an audible clatter. “I feel awful,” he says hoarsely, and Sherlock crawls into bed with him and shifts them so John is lying with his too-hot body pressed against Sherlock’s side, head resting on Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock closes his eyes for a few moments, enjoying the feeling of John's body against his, even though John is sniffling disgustingly and smells like stale sweat. As always, he takes a moment to be grateful for this, for the simple fact that John is here, with him, even a grumpy, stubborn, sick and disgusting John. That John chose him, said yes to him, again and again, that John stays.
John recognises him instantly. It’s Kitty's “boyfriend” from the museum. “So you’re Jim,” John muses. “Can’t say I’m surprised. Only a bit disappointed.”
Everybody laughs, and John decides to change the subject. “I once argued with a butcher about how long a pig’s heart would last in the fridge if it was only taken out and handled for about an hour every night,” John says.
The crew has put a canvas roof over the loos today, and Sherlock ducks under the shelter it provides, checking that nobody is watching them as he steps behind the blue plastic portable toilets. The smell is less than pleasant, but that is of minor consideration.
“Gladly,” Sherlock says, still leaning seemingly casually against the door, but effectively blocking Billy from running away. “Turn out your pockets, then, and prove me wrong.”
“You’re back early,” Sherlock says without turning around. There’s something in his voice John can’t quite place. Tiredness, yes, but something else, too. Boredom? Loneliness? All three?
The treacherous organ in Sherlock’s chest does a complicated thing, speeds up and twists and makes its presence felt. Sherlock takes a chip and eats it mechanically. “The chips are revolting,” Sherlock says, voice not entirely steady.
He’s done a complete spread and run it by his homeless network, and they were all enthusiastic, but Sherlock is oddly dissatisfied. Every single piece of baked goods he made is objectively perfect, but something is missing, and he doesn’t know what it is.
The problem with emotion, he concludes, is that it isn’t a sound, predictable basis for decision making. And John does most of his decision making based on emotion. And since Sherlock has always been bad at predicting how John will feel about any given thing - which is mostly good, because Sherlock would never, ever have predicted John to feel anything at all about
John’s cookie dough needs to rest, so he says something about getting them dinner, and Sherlock nods absently as he squeezes the lemon juice into the poppy seeds, then makes careful notes of how many grams of poppy seeds he added.
One of the problems is that he has no idea whether all the times John saw him, punched him and then kissed him in his mind palace were extrapolations based on observed clues in John’s behaviour or simply wishful thinking on his part. He wouldn’t miss the punching, but the kissing was earth-shatteringly, life-alteringly fantastic and he wants it so much it physically hurts, a gnawing in his stomach.
"I'm not saying you two are always at war with each other, but it is hard to get you two together without some disagreements. It's nice to have something to share together, isn't it?" The fawn huffed.
"Ah, no, my father passed not too long after I was born and my mum already thought I was enough to handle." He gave a bit of a sad smile.
Fawnlock took John's hands, rising along with him and stepping into the tub after his mate. The fawn slipped into the water, settling against John, bleating softly.
John's tongue darted between his lips quickly before he broke into a smile at the fawn's assurance. Danger had been John's life constantly for years, dodging bullets and braving enemy territory to rescue his fellow soldiers. The loss of it was certainly something that had attributed to his depression, which ultimately lead him out here to the forest in the first place. "I know a little something about that... I used to be a soldier." John listened to him as his moved his hands down to the fawn's wrist and hand, touching and testing different points to make sure there wasn't any lingering nerve damage. John listened, not just to the words from the fawn, but to his undertones. While he didn't like rending punishment, it was a necessary evil to maintain the balance of the wood. John himself was disrupting that perfect balance, an outsider pushing himself into the delicate ecosystem. He finally let go of the fawn's hand and nodded with a sigh. "Just the same, I'll stay out of the deep woods. It's late in the year...animals are getting ready for winter. They'll be hungry and on guard. It was a mistake I'll learn from. Was just a bit too eager to explore."
At the back porch, Sherlock sits to untie his chucks, "You'll have to take off your shoes here, Winston hates sand in the house." Once they're inside, Sherlock tells his brother he's putting away his bag and he leads John to his room.
It felt good to be able to do things like this for him, to take care of him. He'd been alone for so long, with only Mrs. Hudson and her occasional coddling.
Sherlock stares up at the beekeeper, absorbing everything that the man says greedily. After the show is over and the beekeeper lets them asks question's, the younger boy's hand shoots up immediately.
They’d fought so much, when they should have helped each other through the pain. He tilted his head in thought, then nodded. He /was/ lonely, the weight of the kingdom hanging heavy on his shoulders, and no one to help shoulder the burden, or to come home to and soothe away his worries. Companionship changed a person. It was something he both wanted and needed. Sometimes his brother could be so wise.
The wonderful slow drag of fingers across John’s body wasn't a hardship at all, and he wanted Fawnlock to be comfortable with him. He gave a soft sigh as the touch slid up his spine, arching into the touch and pressing soft kisses to the fawn's dark curls
John giggles At the knowing look Sherlock gives him, Sherlock beams after his brother, before looking to his friend and scoots closer.
The fawn nosed at John's ear, humming softly, "I like wearing your jumpers, they smell good. Like you, all warm and comforting. Like home." Murmured the Fae softly.
"/Very strong. We'll be stronger than anyone./" John leaned up and peppered Fawnlock's face with kisses, his fingers dipping down to card through the soft fluff of the fawn's tail.
"Come on John, grab my duvet will you? I've got other blankets and pillows too." He explains, going to his closet to pull out some other duvets and afghans.
The young Fae's eyes twinkled slightly, though a soft blush could be seen spreading over his cheeks through the downy fur there.
The fawn's ears twitched as he chuckled softly. He leaned forward to kiss John back to the best of his ability, before he pulled away and licked his lips with a soft smirk. He began popping the berries into his mouth. He chewed happily, tail flicking as he made soft sounds of contentment.
The fawn settled his chin on John's shoulder, reading over his shoulder, the rumble vibrating through his chest. He grinned softly as his mate spoke, ears twitching in excitement.
Sherlock nod excitedly, "Yeah, and I could bring out my star book!" He chuckles. After a few moments, he notices the sound of feet behind them. He tugs on John's hand and stops. He turns and spots the older boy. The taller boy already knows the possible outcome, recognizing the older boy as a bully among the older classes.
The fawn nodded slightly, eyes still trailing after his mate. He knew they'd need to talk once his brother had left, and he mentally steeled himself for that.
Mrs. Holmes kisses her youngest's forehead and then her oldest's cheek, "Good bye dears, busy again." She smiles softly and ruffles Sherlock's curls, the seven-year-old pouting and patting his hair back down.
"Yes, let's go watch a movie," Sherlock would rather read or something more productive, but he could tell John was upset.
"I’m going to go upstairs and get ready for bed. I'm pretty tuckered after today. I'll be back down in a few...alright?" He moved to the stairs and jogged up them, shedding bits of clothing to toss into the laundry basket and headed for the loo to wash his face and brush his teeth.
Sherlock nods at John's words, "I would never dare," he murmurs, smiling at the small mouse, he looks to Mycroft, "His cage, and maybe.. His records?" He asks softly.
The Fae kept his hand moving, but at a slower pace, milking John's orgasm, drinking in the brilliant sight of his mate's face as he found release. Fawnlock gave a slightly smug smirk, pressing kisses up back up the scar and over John's shoulder.
With a slow twitch of his ears, Moosecroft regarded his brother as he spoke. The fawn was not prone to sentiment, yet that seemed to have completely changed with the arrival of John. It was good to see him smile so much, it was good to see him worried over someone. To see him care. He'd thought things had become irreparable between them; when their parents had died, the fawn had pulled into himself and Moosecroft hadn't known what to do.
John felt his face heat up again as the fawn nuzzled at him, but he firmly told himself it was surely just a fae custom and not to let himself get worked up over the intimate contact. Just think of it as a hug Watson, he told himself, smiling all the while as he watched Fawnlock hurry off into the forest until he could no longer see the twitching tail. Then he shut the door and returned inside, heading to the kitchen to wash up the dishes before bed. He felt an odd sort of shimmery warmth settle down around the cottage and had the sudden urge to sneeze, doing so into the sleeve of his jumper, nose itching wildly at the odd sensation. Perhaps it was just allergies? He shrugged it away and set the dishes and pans in the drying rack, wiping his hands on a tea towel before he retired up stairs into the cozy bedroom. As he striped down and dressed in his night clothes, he wandered how the fawn slept, out there in the woods. Was he warm? As John climbed into his own soft bed and nestled under the thick quilts, he lay awake and thought about it all, picturing the fawn curled in a bed of leaves and moss , ears twitching idly in his sleep. Maybe one day he'd see Fawnlock's home. He smiled to himself and fall asleep finally, eager for tomorrow to come.
Biting back a curse, he set down the linens and rubbed at his shin, then shoved the table back to make more room on the floor. Dropping down beside Fawnlock, he began to spread out the selection of soft quilts and pillows, cushions from the sofa and even a few of his well-worn jumpers. Fawnlock's ears flicked with concern as John nearly fell into the table, but at the adorable, frustrated look the human had on his face, he gave the clumsy human a smile. Deciding better to watch the fawn regarded the human with curious eyes, ears twitching. As John finished, the Fae eyed one of the human's jumpers, a fond smile playing across his lips
Though the morning was brisk, John felt nice and toasty with the velvety warmth pressed against his side. It felt good to stretch out his legs, though he kept a watchful eye on Fawnlock to make sure he wasn't straining his wounds.
"I know there is something between us. I can feel him...even when he isn't with me. There's like a tug when he leaves, and when he comes back I know he's near before he's stepped into the cottage. I don't know if that's a bond...but I know its love."
"We'll eat it together. And yes, you're healing very well. Tonight I want to put some ointment on those gashes...the soak surely helped them. There was no infection, so you're doing marvelous as a patient." He pulled back a bit so he could plant a proper kiss on the fawn's lips, so very grateful for perhaps the hundredth time that Fawnlock had adapted to that particular for of affection very well.
"No need to sulk. I'm here with you now." He squeezes his hand again, this time to remind Sherlock to he is real too. "Lets look for insects along the fence line."
"Thank you sooo much!"  He puts the book down and grabs Sherlock in a tight hug, affectionately kissing his friend's cheek.  "I love it."
The Fae bleated softly, looking back to John, setting the tray down on a more flat part of the nest before he carefully leant forward to wrap his lanky arms around his mate, nuzzling his shoulder contently, "You are the best, most kindest mate, in the history of mates, John." He bleated again as he pulled away, ears flicking as he carefully took up a bowl of soup in his hands, sniffing softly.
Finally, John felt an excited little spark when the fawn had found the right tome. When Fawnlock returned and dumped the pile of books beside him. He looked on curiously, then made a surprised chirp as the album was pushed into his lap. John opened the book and looked at the first page, which was a wonderfully rendered picture of the entire family, presumable soon after Fawnlock had been born.
He murmured in his native tongue before translating for the human, "Perfect." He pressed a kiss under John's jaw before pulling him to lay in the nest.
After a bit of climbing Sherlock stops at a good branch and holds out a hand for John. "Here," He pulls his friend up next to him and swings his legs over the branch, settling against the trunk, watching John do the same.
Moosecroft took in the sight of the human, cataloging everything about him. He'd rather expected him to be much taller; as it was he was actually very short for a human male. He was handsome, but it was a rough sort of beauty, and interesting compliment to the ethereal beauty of his younger brother. His clothing was casual and comfortable, the thick layers betraying the trim, muscled body beneath. It was quite intriguing...it was evident this man was a warrior, yet he shrouded himself in clothing that made him appear soft and harmless. It was camouflaged deception that the man was probably ignorant to. And yet beneath all that power, was the heart of a healer as well. John was a living contradiction.
John listens and watches in awe. The bees are just incredible, the sound they make is so interesting - relaxing even.
John really hadn't been expected the rock of his mate's hips rolling down against his own, and the sudden friction against his groin. John's fingers tightened in the fur he was grasping, and he bit back an almost embarrassing moan, his head tilting back against the pillows as he arched up and pulled Fawnlock down against him again.
John listened in fascination as the fawn described his brother. He tried to picture what he would look like, the curve of his antlers, and the fairer coloring. He ended up scrunching up his nose in dislike at the attempts he conjured up. The fawn occupied a good deal of his brain, and trying to distort his features into something different didn't settle well with him. Selfishly, he was glad Fawnlock didn't blend in well with the humans. He felt as if it gave him a small advantage, being the only human in his life. Advantage in what, he had no idea. He finished his biscuit and licked the crumbs from the corner of his mouth. "I'll keep my eye out." He promised, watching the fawn drink his tea with a happy hum. "Tell me how your morning was. What did you do when you woke up?"
Fawnlock didn't think John'd wake, and he wouldn't be gone long. He moved to the kitchen, having experience in Mrs. Hudson's, he turned on the faucet and wet a washcloth, Fae customs wouldn't look well upon such blatant evidence of a coupling in public. He flicked the tap off and rubbed at the patches of stickiness in his fur, after he was clean he rung out the cloth and hung it on the edge of the sink.
"Not a problem, berks like that shouldn't pick on you little guys." The older boy ruffles Sherlock's curly hair, "Though you're not that little, are you, Holmes?"
Once he'd flicked them away, his fingers lingered, running through the thick strands and tucking them back behind the forever twitching ears. "The birds...do they make you nervous?" The fawn's ears flicked as the human's digits lingered in his hair, leaning into John's hand slightly.
Mycroft is right behind them, carrying his telescope and once he gets to where they want and then he begins setting it up as quickly as possible.
"Um..." John looks to Sherlock and his hand is squeezed in reassurance. "Sherlock invited me to stay over, he's just down the way..."
"Don't be embarrassed Mycroft." Mrs. Watson puts a hand on his shoulder, squeezing lightly. Mycroft smiles at her weakly, still flushed.
Sherlock looks up at his brother with a slightly narrowed gaze, pursing his lips, "Don't call me Sherly!" He gives his brother a look, a slight blush dusting his cheeks, Mycroft chuckles at Sherlock's out burst and waits for Sherlock to ask John over. The taller child turns to John, "Would you like to come up for lunch?" He asks, standing and brushing sand off his bum, before shouldering the strap to his bag.
Sherlock dutifully follows John, he doesn't have the biggest interest in space, it was minuscule compared to John's interest in space and rockets, though the younger boy really enjoyed the stars.
"Surprise him. Reach out to him. Invite him into your woods to meet your mate for his blessing. Do things like they are supposed to be done. He can't find fault in your behavior if it's obeying tradition. He won't know what to do with himself because he'll never expect it."
John wasn't an amazing cook by far, but he was decent enough to get by. He had learned plenty of tricks in the army to make even the most horrendous of foods edible, so with fresh ingredients, he more than managed. Draining out the pasta, he scooped it into the sauce he'd made then spooned out two portions onto plates. After spending a few good seconds considering if the fawn knew how to use a fork, he brought the dishes into the living room. Setting each plate down on the coffee table, he decided that it was probably more comfortable for the other to stay curled on the rug rather than sit on on of the hard kitchen chairs. Setting out a fork beside Fawnlock's plate (coming to the decision that it was near impossible to properly eat pasta without one ), John then settled beside him. He watched the fawn skim over the words in the book, amazed at his progress and knowledge for living without human interaction for so long. He hardly seemed scared of anything, eager and curious. He picked up his own fork and gestured to the plate, then twirled the utensil in the pasta, picking up a forkful and popping it into his mouth. Chewing for a moment, he considered, then swallowed, nodding towards the book before spearing some veggies. "Who taught you how to read?"
“You’re mad,” John whispers, but it’s more to himself, because he realises Jim doesn’t even see him any more. Also, it’s difficult to argue with the logic of what he’s saying. Sherlock’s restless, relentless search for anything that actually challenges him has stalked them both since they got here. Before, even, he thinks, remembering a twelve-year old boy dissecting a rabbit at three in the morning. Anything not to be bored.
“This one is powidl,” John explains when he points at the one coated with poppy seeds and sugar. “This one is rhubarb-strawberry,” he gestures at the one coated with breadcrumbs and more sugar. “And this is dried pears.” The last one is coated with cinnamon and sugar. All three turnovers are covered in icing sugar. John has poured a liberal amount of melted butter over the lot.
John nods at him, and it takes the world’s only consulting detective - and his best friend - to see the miniscule amount of tension going out of John’s body. John gives him a small smile that’s more of a grimace, really. “Good night, then,” he says, and turns without another word and vanishes into the bedroom.
It’s ten minutes to two when the door to the rehearsal room opens, and Sherlock walks in with Lestrade, who met him in Mrs Hudson’s office to go over the contract details.
John is also using bright red homemade jam and the spice blend he brought from home. He’s glancing over at Sherlock occasionally, but they’re both too busy to really talk. Linzer torte isn’t that complicated, but it can be very dry, so getting it right is more difficult than it seems. John is also doing a complex lattice pattern with strips of dough of different widths, and Sherlock watches carefully to find John’s mistake. John’s workstation is messy and he’s careless about measuring, but otherwise, he works with the self-assurance of someone who’s done this often and well.
Mrs Turner looks at his notes, messy handwriting on paper already sprinkled with flour and butter. “This looks like a lot of work.”
“To show off, obviously,” John says, and there it is again, that smile that John has managed to startle out of Sherlock, but he doesn’t answer, even though he’s dying to tell John what he’s making.
Sarah glares at him over the grain coffee in the staff room. “I waited for you for half an hour, John. Half a bloody hour.”
They spent the day on Hampstead Heath with Rosie. It was hot, and John slathered all of them with sunscreen, against both Rosie’s and Sherlock’s vocal protest, which John ignored with his usual stubborn equanimity.
Sherlock makes his move and hands it back to John, then rests his head back against the wall of the elevator and closes his eyes. “Just tell me your moves, and I’ll tell you mine.” He doesn’t need to see the board to play, as John very well knows. More often than not, it’s a distraction. He prefers mapping the game out in his head.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “John. I’m a genius with a photographic memory. Do you honestly think I can’t find my way back?”
John takes up the small lamp and some instruments and looks into Joe’s mouth. Sherlock looks at him, eyebrows raised, and John nods. Amalgam fillings.
Admittedly, the flat did need a bit of cleaning after Sherlock vacated it, but every household produces dust and mould. And if the landlord didn’t wish to see Sherlock’s body parts collection in the freezer, he shouldn’t have made the police break into his flat to evict him.
“I like the way you’re thinking,” he mutters against Sherlock’s lips, and rocks against Sherlock’s erection again.
. I have serious work to do. Some of us aren’t just in this for the fun of it, you know, some of us actually
John presses his lips together, trying to keep the emotion in. It shouldn’t mean this much after six years, but John feels like a weight has been lifted from his heart. “You never said.”
Yesterday's judging was boring. Today it’s equally so. Sherlock tunes out Mike, Mary, Anderson, Janine, Dimmock and Neela, their bakes are all mediocre to bad, and they’re no competition. Molly’s bake is the first that gets praise from the judges. Her savoury pumpkin muffins seem to be delicious, and her raisin scones are nice, if a bit on the dry side.
Irene nudges Sherlock with her foot. Sherlock looks up from his phone and raises his eyebrows in a silent question. “Good job with the video. If John ever decides to start his own YouTube channel, we’re both fucked.”
Sherlock is doing a classic apple-cranberry, but he’s doing a crumble top and covering it with thin strips of a lattice lid, which he will caramelise once the pie is done baking.
Sherlock wants to kiss him. It comes out of nowhere and settles in his guts, a sort of hunger, to taste that smile, right now.
He’s about to go over to John and drag him out when he gets cornered by Mycroft and his parents. “Wonderful performance, darling,” his mother gushes, kissing his cheek.
“Friend…” Sherlock repeats the word like it’s the oddest thing he’s ever heard. “You’re the second person to use the word today. Do you think he’s my friend?”
Sherlock gazes thoughtfully at John, rabbit momentarily forgotten, and John feels an odd rush of adrenaline at all this razor-sharp attention directed at him. “It’s obvious from your clothes that your family doesn’t have much money, and you’re from North London, but I can barely hear it when you speak, so I’m assuming either you spent your first years at school at a boarding school and your mother brought you home when money got tight after your father passed, or you’re in one of London’s better public schools on a scholarship. Based on your academic interest in the rabbit and the fact that you play rugby I’d say the latter. Do you want me to tell you how I can tell you play rugby?”
Sherlock smiles and closes his eyes. “I want chips drenched in so much vinegar they make my tongue burn with every bite.”
Sherlock is in the kitchen, cleaning up from his latest batch, when the bell on the front door to Speedy’s dings.
Molly nods vaguely, still staring at the set. “I was sick in the tent, too. Every single time.” She looks at John, almost accusingly. “How are you so calm?”
Sherlock looks down at the carefully put together business plan and wonders why he does this to himself, again and again. Why he gives Mycroft the chance to show him, again and again, that he will never be anything other than the screw up little brother, the second, the lesser.
So he takes his cake and makes excuses for John and Harry, earning a lot of knowing looks from the other bakers, and then he goes home and doesn’t sleep.
Instead it was a different kind of shiver, one that left the Dragon feeling warm and coiled tightly like a spring, wanting suddenly to take to the air and fly and never touch the ground again and taste the clouds as they form in the early morning air. The kind of hum one got from having their wings touched by the kiss of sunrise as you coasted far above the rest of the world.
John swallowed once, and his lover pressed a slow, desperate kiss to his lips. In it, the army doctor could taste apology.
The sound of his voice cued a low rumbling from the other side of the room, behind the couch. John quickly dropped his load of groceries, preparing himself just in time as a flash of murderous-red scales twisted themselves
The subtle threat lingered in his words, and yet Moriarty did not seem particularly worried or phased. Instead, John's shoulders rolled easily as the gun flexed against his own temple, as if he were merely holding a toy spray pistol, relaxed in his hands. His voice purred with delight as his head tilted in reptilian amusement, all traces of the gentle John Watson vanishing in that moment to make way for something cold and unfeeling.
Tentatively, she tried to take one step forward. The Gem wasn’t particularly thrilled when instead she just fell on her face.
. Yet no harsh blows or words came, and after a beat of silence, she looked up to see Mike looking down at her with wide-eyed sadness. When his lips moved, she didn't understand what he said.
Sherlock murmured, his voice low with thought. Irene flicked him an approving glance, even as she wryly asked if John was going to sit. John, still a bit lost and fuming, did so after a slow flush. Sitting beside Sherlock, he swore he could feel the energy humming in the detective’s bones.
The ocean waves crashed outside, and John could somehow feel it in his veins. Sherlock needed saltwater, his body fast-struggling without its reassuringly cool taste and touch. Yet he knew that this would mean leaving the cabin, and leaving the Selkie on his own. The thought alone sent warning bells along the base of John’s spine. Anything could happen, the Selkie could be shamming for all he knew, playing hurt in order to play with John’s sympathies. The very thought caused him to eye Sherlock with mistrust, even as a breath left him in a huff of consternation. No, the Selkie wasn’t faking anything, not even the most brilliant actor would be able to mimic that thin sheen of sweat or the way the creature’s chest heaved as if he were a beached whale.
Had he gone to the authorities? Would men with weapons and hard scowls drag him away from this strange alternate dimension? Would he finally be put down like a rabid dog, just when he had tasted what he thought might very well be Heaven? Irrationally, he found himself recalling the way the soldier's hands had felt as he had washed his hair, how those rough calluses had so gently picked apart every knot until his curls had finally come apart to hang wildly about his cheeks. Those hands which so easily could have struck out at him had instead cupped his chin, stroked his ears, treated him as something precious and deserved and
The beach was warm under their shoes as they trekked, the sand heated by the sun and warming the backs of their necks as the two boys climbed over rock and stone. John led the way, carrying a plastic shovel and pail in one hand even as he went with Mike along the shore, their feet licked at by the pulsing waves as they danced on the edge of wet and dry. They were two tanned bodies warmed with excitement and energy, and they played in the waves, their laughter drifting high into the air like a song.
John blinked in surprise, only just now noticing that his new friend's partner in crime was conspicuously absent. Of course Humans had the choice to send their Dragons to their properly gendered quarters, but the truth of the matter was it was a rule that was rather overlooked and not enforced.The proof of John's suspicions were proven when his other bunkmates, Patrick Lark and his Dragon Lorelei sleepily moved from their cot. Lorelei was topless, and John's ears burned as he rather suddenly didn't know where to look. However the dark-eyed Dragon didn't seem particularly perturbed by his embarassment, and rose to reveal the rest of her was bare as well, the gold and jade swirl of Chinese scales tumbling down the small of her back. She followed her Master without so much as a glance towards the small group, letting him lead her into the showers.
She flicked a hand at him, waving the demand away. Mycroft took a careful breath through his nose, gritting his teeth and carefully controlling his temper.
He dreamed of smoke, and he dreamed of the night he was wounded, the phantom ache singing in his limbs and chasing him down into the abyss.
Beside him, John felt Sherlock’s shoulders round in subtle interest. Though the Selkie seemed to be deliberately trying to act disinterested, there was an analytical cast to his features. He cocked an eyebrow, long fingers tapping against his knee.
It was only the tap of the umbrella that alerted her, and even then, it was too late. She spun, and John felt the abrupt closeness in his mind tear, Sherlock
The little boy understood suddenly. The Selkie had redressed him, but the boy's clothes were torn and mud-stained. His wrist was still bleeding, he could feel that much. Yet he still could not wake, even when his father tensely murmured
John found himself elbow-deep in blood in the medical tent, his own head injury left untreated as he tried to stem the bleeding from an abdominal wound that had managed to puncture upwards towards the soldier’s lung. Much like the battle before in the aftermath, John felt as if time were slipping and sliding, blurring into a mess of blood and injuries and bandages soaked through with fluids, broken up only by the breaking of bones. The soldier witnessed three deaths that night, and Soo Lin watched with quiet eyes as John at the end of his shift curled inwards on himself, breathing deeply through his nose and clutching at his hair.
Sherlock stood in the centre of the living room shaking, his eyes wild and wide as he took in the shattered vase he had accidentally tipped over with his tail. The scattered pieces lay about his bare feet haphazardly, shards powdered with the sheer force of the appendage's assault. John could tell the vase had literally been whipped towards the wall, the trajectory of the shards all in one general direction. However he didn't have much time to absorb all this as a low, keening noise that could be felt through the floorboards rumbled from Sherlock's throat.
He found himself staring at the setting sun, chin cupped in one hand and a beer balanced in the other palm. He didn't taste it going down, humming to himself even as the sun slipped away, swallowed by the ocean's wide reach. A drop of fire drowning for fear of night.
John could taste the energy inside the creature, like a firework put under pressure. Cheered slightly, the little boy tried to encourage it, clapping when Sherlock suddenly turned to dive head-first into the ocean, emerging like a fish a second later to paddle swiftly back to shore. Soaking wet and yet without a care in the world, Sherlock's mood seemed to be infectious. The creature carefully sang out another line, the same buzzing energy oozing through the notes and filling John, replenishing his mood so that it became buoyant and free.
Sherlock could feel when he had ensnared someone in his song. There was a certain kind of echo that occurred when it happened, a reverberation of the blood that caused his body to sing with anticipation, made his eyes widen in a predatory way. A sweetly-sick kind of hunger that made itself known as he felt the draw of Human life in the distance.
It came in the form of a shattered tea mug, thrown into the sink so that porcelain shards tinkled against stainless steel and caused the detective to pause in the middle of picking out sticky black bits from his hair. He turned only to find John stalking towards him grimly, mouth set in an immovable line as he barged into the living-room, voice tight and crisp with military precision as he pointed to Sherlock's chair.
Daniel says weakly, and he's not sure whether it's directed towards John or towards the man before him. He sways slightly, and Mycroft catches the tiny movement for what it is and begins to speak with a rush of speed.
Morstan breathed sucked air through her teeth, blinking slowly. She was cat-like, poised as if to strike, lithe.
“We are not playing a game.” Sherlock growled, growing frustrated at constantly being played with, being danced about. He was growing worried, and it was clouding his judgement. He could not fix this if he couldn't worm his way towards the heart of the problem. That was what he had always been good at. Yet until now he had been cautious, unwilling to crack open John. He could normally shatter people, break them from the inside out and get to the live, pumping veins that made up their process of thinking. Their very core. The instincts that drove them to love and lose and murder and lust and grieve. He could look through a person like wet tissue paper, peel back every layer, and it was because he could detach himself and stop thinking of the person as anything more than a riddle to solve.
Sherlock lifted his fingers once more, planning to swipe the recording back to its beginning. It was at this time that Mycroft’s voice cut in the silence, having watched his brother’s hunched figure now for the better part of an hour stare at John’s face with something like obsessive intent.
It would likely take three months to arrive, three long months before any kind of defences to come. Like sitting ducks, it was not a question of “if” an attack would come, but “when”.
"She would have been so proud of you, John. She worshipped the ground you walked on, always her favourite." The old woman confided, patting his arm sympathetically before stepping away and brushing at her eyes. A part of John wanted to lean into the old woman's touch, another part kept him distant. Because this was not his grief, this was someone else's. He hadn't seen his grandmother since he had been small. He had no right to mourn her death, no right to feel the stinging in the back of his eyes and throat. Yet still he felt it, lingering under his skin. An indelible sound that he could not accurately express. A part of John wondered if she still lingered in the wood of the cottage, hoped for it. She had always believed in magic, if anyone could find a way to haunt a place, it would have been his grandmother. The thought was more comforting than it should have been.
” And he tacked on the last bit at the end, all but muttering it as he nosed John's hairline with a protective nuzzle. The feeling of it was nice, sweet, and John would have normally used it as an excuse to plant a kiss to his husband's elegant collarbone, but now he refused to be distracted, struggling free from his Mate's embrace as he admonished him sternly
calm. Right now, anger wasn't what John needed, and this side of his friend was in obvious distress and would soon black out if they continued breathing in such an uneven pattern. He forced his breaths to come slow and even, hoping that some part of John might subconsciously pick up on it and follow. He did not approach, pitching his voice slightly lower and non-threatening.
“You asked me to kill you.... When you weren't you...” John flinched physically, setting his cup down and rubbing at his face in horror. He looked to the detective with a mix of guilt and shame.
“The first rule of flying-”, he stated flatly, fingers pressing down firmly on the remote. The next instant Rin was snarling, curling inwards into herself so that her belly pressed low onto the sand and her head was ducked down. The broad width of her shoulder was now at the height of Bill's waist and Murray wasted no time, gripping the dip of her scapula with ease, heaving himself up so that he sat comfortably in the large cavern where the neck of the dragon met the spine before smoothing into wings. When Rin straightened, Bill towered over the rest of the ranks, his eyes cold with something unnameable that made John's chest clench in discomfort. For just a second, there was something lost in those eyes, something dark and brooding, and the soldier wondered what his friend had seen and what he'd been ordered to do for him to not even hesitate as he continued.
you, you git! I don’t understand why it’s such a big deal, I read the book and everything and I still don’t understand! Is your stubbornness really worth the pain of an electric shock?!”
and she twisted a ring about her middle finger absently. Her gaze would drift now and again only to be irrevocably pulled back to the doctor's face, her eyes sneaking glances at him when she thought he didn't notice. He did, but he pretended he didn't until the right time. Then, slowly he fixed his gaze on her face.
In the dark hours as she held her father’s hand and looked into his tired, fevered eyes, Rania gathered her resolve.
Not even the painted conch could bring her to ogle, and the youngest Watson often found himself wondering if his older sister was really human or some kind of horrid sea-monster in disguise. He made sure to keep a sharp eye out for any suspicious clues, watching carefully to see if Harry did anything a sea monster would do, like eat raw fish or melt in the hot afternoon sun. She did neither, although she
Sherlock realised something was wrong when John took exactly five minutes longer than he usually did when going to the lav. He had already been somewhat nervously counting the minutes, unsure why he was as wound up as he was even as his fingers ticked restlessly against the wall the leaned on. His phone was in his other hand, but he couldn't text Lestrade since he was working on another case and he felt like it would be slightly awkward to text his flatmate when he was “attending to business”....
Unerringly, her feet leapt over those steps and landed on the ones below them, her shadow a willing puppet as it stretched behind her like a second body mimicking her every move. Claude could taste in the flat it's relaxed confines, the sort of humbly beautiful area about her now black and white contrasts in the moonlight that streamed in through the windows. Her hair glinted like it was laced with morning dew, almost metallic as she passed the pane in the kitchen, sparing a sparse glance for the hum of the city outside. Her eyes unerringly picked out the lightly snoring outline of the man she was targeting, and she slowed in the entrance to the living room, eyes taking in for the first time the enigma that was Sherlock Holmes.
Daniel smirked, shrugging his shoulders by way of apology and out of habit checking to make sure the door was closed and locked and that he had a verifiable escape route to John's room if he needed it. Not that he thought he would of course, but it was always prudent just to make sure. Inside of his head, Claude giggled a little and said she wouldn't mind playing hide and go seek later on. Daniel made a mental promise to the little girl that she could once the Detective had gone to bed.
resistant towards hearing the man out, as when he lifted his head up again, Sherlock knew he was no longer talking to John. Daniel's Scottish lilt drifted from the man's mouth even as he finished folding the rest of the clothes, dark blue eyes filled with determination as he firmly pushed past Sherlock Holmes.
She looked up at him, one eye half-hidden by her fringe, and John stared at his cup in contemplation. His blue irises focused in silent thought. Could he trust Sherlock?
Still, he had to hustle if he wanted to be prepared before the Dragon woke up. Apparently, the creatures tended to be primarily nocturnal, but because his had fallen asleep because it was ill it would most likely wake irritable.
In response John stepped back, looking Sherlock in one giant blue eye. His jaw was firm even as he reached up to stroke the creature's muzzle, feeling the cold like a winter chill that never seemed to quite leave his friend's skin. His thoughts were small, but solid.
Not that John particularly expected it to be a walk in the park. No, floating in the grip of a creature that was made of iron and stone, he couldn't quite say he expected to be comfortable.
Victor however didn't seem to see it much as a joke. It was clear in the way he stepped forward, physically barring the elder Holmes from coming nearer to Sherlock. The darkly-curled detective for his part was rather dazed, blinking in surprise. He hadn't expected
” Rory choked, a breathless exclamation. If John had been looking at him, he would have seen how his cheeks were nearly as red with excitement as his hair. Everyone tried to look through the sheer, silken fabric of the litter as it passed, and John found his jaw dropping open as he saw the two companions inside, seated upon a pile of plush-multi-coloured cushions and scarves.
Yet there was obviously another issue, as quite suddenly there was a brutal pounding on his chest, pressing like an elephant’s strike against his ribcage. It jolted his entire frame, breaking the scenic meadow environment and calling to the fact that Sherlock’s lungs
Cerioth's dark eyes widened as he shot a look up from under his lashes, a slightly perplexed and mollified expression on his face before his gaze slid back to the floor. After a moment, John felt the somewhat delicate brush of a stranger's voice on the edge of his mind.
Sherlock bit back a small grimace, grinding the last of his cigarette against the brick-work of the school. He watched as Sebastian did the same, the man's smile growing as he took in Sherlock's rigid stance. He reached out, cupping the curly-haired addict's chin and tilting it upwards, assessing his cold demeanor with a smirk. His hands had been warm. Too warm. Stifling.
He stayed like that for the remainder of the car ride, too afraid to pull away less the creature snap at him, unable to tear his gaze from the spot just between the creature's scapulae.
That’s not what I wanted to be shown!” The Spirit dashed the water, destroying John’s face looking back at him. Sherlock glared up at the stone statue, his blue eyes flickering as the storm around him shuddered with his anger.
“You need something that is unequivocally yours. Something to claim from your childhood that’s positive.” The detective stated flatly, mouth pursed in distaste. Upon his partner’s nod, the detective’s figure hunched, defensive. “You have things that are yours.” Sherlock tried feebly, looking around the flat. It didn’t help that the skull was staring right at them. Also an experiment involving cat fur was currently sitting in the kitchen.
“Well, can't have you getting arrested for public indecency. Wasn't sure what you'd like, so I just bought what I thought would work for you.... guessed at your sizes, so things might be too big or too small.... Used the military budget so it wasn't like it cost me anything......Here.” John thrust the bag towards him, suddenly rather embarrassed for no real reason. After a moment, Sherlock reached to rifle through its contents, limbs quivering with suppressed interest.
John says sharply, suddenly cutting him off with stiff shoulders. He then bites his lip, hating at how forcefully the words came out and wincing as a flicker of his own reflection from that day comes unbidden to mind. Wide eyes, crusted blood from stitches on his head. Bruised knuckles and cheeks from nightmares and fighting.
Upon John’s return to his tent, several things became evident to his notice almost immediately. The first, and most immediate was Sherlock. The Dragon all but crowded him upon his return, glazed eyes narrowed in focus that quickly became just a little too close for comfort. John found himself backing up even as Sherlock invaded the previous barriers that they had wordlessly at some point agreed upon, the Dragon inhaling deeply along the line of John’s neck, breath warm and slightly sweet. It took John a second to remember Xavi’s words and touch, echoing in the back of his mind.
Sometimes as he slept, he could almost feel Sherlock by his side, desperately searching for him. In these dreams, Sherlock would run in the opposite direction, figure bending and twisting in the distance, screaming for John.
Without preamble the man handed over some cash. John was just putting the coins into the register when the ding of the machine nearly drowned out the customer’s voice.  Sherlock’s voice was questioning, and it held in it knowledge it should not possess.
“My mother divorced him on the spot the one time he ever truly lost his temper with me, but it didn’t happen until I was fifteen. He caught me and a school friend- Victor Trevor- shagging in the shed during Christmas. He was so angry that he pulled me rather violently out of the shed and slapped me across the face. Unfortunately, he did it in front of quite an audience, and Mummy. She… has never taken well to anyone even attempting to do her children any harm. Her relationship with him was cut off, and I don’t think Mycroft ever quite forgave me. He loved father, as much as I hated him. He looked up to his prowess, respected his drive. I, the fuck up younger sibling, took that away.”
Briggs grinned, and though John didn't totally believe what he was saying his next words sealed the deal for him.
Mary Morstan’s smile returned, a slow and curling thing. She reached out with her chopsticks, spearing another helping of beef.
“The fire tribe and the Northern haven’t had an arranged marriage together in decades, not since Princess Eilonwy and King Marseus.”
John had only ever seen a wolf once before in his life. Sometimes, they got lost in the desert, coming far away from greener lands. The hot sun would disorient them, and the lack of water or food would soon cause the animal to become delirious and heat exhausted. The wolf John had seen had been a starving thing, already too weak to fend for itself. His father had taken his gun and shot it, unable to risk it stealing precious livestock.
John didn't really know what a 'Mycroft' was, but at the mention of his family the boy stiffened, his persistent paddling halting for a beat too long before he had to thrash to stay afloat. Of course Sherlock noticed it, the pup briefly wondering if his new companion would drown before he even got any answers (if so he was keeping him, he would bring the body back to his pod if only to drive Mycroft mental, he already knew a spell to preserve bodies). However the man-beast appeared to have remembered something painful, as his small face scrunched up in what Sherlock could only guess might be sadness as he stared down at his hand full of shining stones. For a moment Sherlock worried it had been
Though the personality before him didn't seem like the type to waltz exactly, or even dance for that matter. Since arriving back at their flat, the man before Sherlock had barely barrelled past Mrs. Hudson (something John would never had done and which Sherlock, uncharacteristically apologized to the old woman for) before marching to John's room in military-like footsteps and slamming the door shut in the Detective's face.
“It's painful. It hurts like nothing else quite can. So it's punishment. For when I disappoint people. For when I'm...” And the detective trailed off, looking at his hands.
Sherlock didn’t look like he quite believed, but his skin was tinged a delightful shade of surprised pink anyway. He likely meant to reply sarcastically, but his voice came out just a touch breathier than intended.
Worse, was that Sherlock looked at her not as he usually did with other women, or even other Gems, but with a struck expression that to John’s jealous mind interpreted as enthralment. Perhaps it was true that Irene had stripped herself of anything that might lend a deduction, but it didn’t mean that the detective had to
awe and confusion, peering about the flat as if it somehow held the answer to her every inquiry. He feet kicked lightly from the seat of John's chair, occasionally being shifted to cross Indian-style as a hand came up to pick lightly at the skin around John's pointer finger. There was a familiar surge of restless energy about John's figure, a renewal of youth that seemed to melt away some of the tension in his
“She wants something for the photos, but she’s being coy as to her demands. It’s time to take things
woke Sherlock from his stupor. When the Dragon blearily got to his feet, he froze to hear a high and plaintive voice, a child reaching out for him, giggling and growling in perfect Dragon-like rumbles.
“He called himself Charles Magnussen, and he says he’s from a small village beyond the foothill paths.” Mycroft listened to Greg as he sat in one of the plush chairs of the library, reading by the fire. Greg had gotten the information from his dad, and his brows had been in a pensive knot ever since. “He fainted at the doorway from exposure, the healers are guessing. Your parents are deciding whether or not to let him go in the morning.” The unspoken hovered in the air. Man was a beast the Dragons had so far been unwilling to engage. They were unpredictable, often violent, and easy to frighten.
, and the thought made his nose visibly curl with distaste. However that feeling soon went away when he imagined the
As he breathed the last word, the Selkie seemed to understand. Sherlock's eyes darkened as the creature leant forward, taking John's lips hungrily in a kiss that seemed to be designed to simply reassure him of his presence. The silk wetness of it didn't bother John as much as he thought it would, especially when he heard Sherlock hum against his lips. The press of them made his blood heavy with an alien comfort and sleepiness that was not quite his own. Sherlock's words were filled with a contentment that only strengthened John's conviction that he had hit his head a bit too hard against something. That this was all a dream.
They stood in a silent face-off in front of the troops then, glaring hotly at one another with ill-concealed malice that John hadn't seen the likes of quite before. True Wilkes was obviously an arse (and a cruel one at that) but it was strange to see Bill's features twisted into such an expression of
Turning his cheek to look the boy in the eye, he gripped either side of John's face, demanding he stare. John didn't struggle, although he swallowed nervously as Sherlock parted his lips to sing. However, no lulling call for the sea came. Instead, the little creature's voice was firm. Unmoving.
Even so he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes, tossing one to Conrad's capable fingers. Next comes a lighter, and the blonde man takes both with glee as he lights the end of the fag and inhales deeply, blowing out rings of smoke out into the air and almost groaning in relief as the nicotine swam in his system. His cobalt-blue eyes fluttered closed, and for the first time since he had Shifted over Conrad smiled. It was a hard sort of thing, and did not speak much of John's usually easy grin. His voice rumbled in a chuckle before he bothered to deign Sherlock with a proper reply.
It was too much. Cerioth bit his lip, looking at his hands. They were in his lap, trembling and pressed together. If they hadn't been, he might have broken the steering wheel with the cold fury that settled in his gut. Dodge's voice never rose, just kept that same, gentle tone. It held in it no pity, but it was not the hard edge of command she normally used either. It was a strange mix of the two, somewhere between a scolding mother and a friend trying to offer comfort. She drew one more drag of her light before tossing it away, pointing firmly to the back seat, mouth a hard-drawn line. Allowing no argument.
Sorry this took forever ^.^ but summer is coming! which means more frequent updating! yaaay :D just this week and the next then I'm finished...
. He did not turn to look at his friend, but he could sense John's sadness, like a heavy thing draping itself on the flat. It felt wrong, leaden with assumptions incorrect and painful.
The elder Holmes’ voice was deceptively mild as he spoke, but his presence alone attested to Sherlock’s utter malaise. Normally, Mycroft did not pester his brother, so long as he was upholding his duties. However, the Incubus had not visited his Darklings in days, and the rooms of his realms were growing neglected. Even the bone creatures, normally well put together and friendly, seemed anxious and crumbling. It was as if Sherlock’s internal clock had stopped, and the Demon lay in the eye of a hurricane, numb and indifferent to his responsibilities.
He wore eye-liner sometimes. Painted his nails so they were the same shade of blue as the glow in his eyes. Little details that caught the eye and held it. Like shimmering scales on a canvas of otherwise pale skin. John didn't realise that Sherlock's ears had piercings until one day when he came home and a ring glinted from the lobe of the man's ear underneath the midnight sea of his curls. It shimmered as he played his violin absently, fingers weaving an effortless tune.
“I’ll admit that I… have a few theories, but there is ultimately nothing concrete. Blue was at most, reluctant and at worse, fearful to give information freely. She seems to have borne the… brunt of the abuse and as such does not enjoy reliving it.”
In the kitchen, his grandmother stood barefoot on the creaking floor, chopping up pieces of onion to put in the massive skillet on the stove. The sharp silver of the knife flashed as she cut, a delicate dance on the cutting board as she looked up and smiled at her grandson with a wide, sweet grin.
she’s being foolish. This isn’t something she can just whip up out of thin air and use as leverage. This is an action that a sixteen year old girl is not responsible enough to make.”
Strawberries and snogging did in fact, go together rather well. In John’s humble opinion, it was definitely something he didn’t object to.
antagonised, Mycroft. If it comes to light that he is in any way involved with these crimes, then I assure you I will not
John managed to slip by and push through the crowds with only one person stopping him. The person, a girl in her late teens with an acid-green streak in her hair and a metallic lip piercing, handed him a brightly-hued flyer with a surprisingly gentle smile. In bold black print was an intense accusation, sitting on top of an image that John knew too well.
Greg let out a rumbling, wordless inquiry after a beat too long of hesitation. His massive tail twitched to curl around Mycroft in question.
To make doubly sure, he also continued the trail of ice-cubes all the way to the bathtub, ensuring that the Dragon wouldn't mistake his motives or intent in case it was dizzy or confused. Normally, Dragons were almost telepathic they were so sensitive to changes in emotions, especially around John. However his had a fever, so it was quite possible the Dragon wouldn't be able to sense things with the same dexterity. He'd also have to take a closer look at that wing to determine what kind of sickness was afflicting the Dragon's skin, but that could be dealt with later on if he gained the creature's tolerance.
He didn’t know what it meant, but then again, John was fairly sure he had missed a lot while out cold. When Sherlock had been awake, the Dragon had been cagey with answers, annoyingly so. John knew that they were relatively safe, that they were back in London somehow, and that distressingly, he was being honourably discharged. The last part he didn’t need Sherlock to tell him, he knew it just by looking at the state of his shoulder.
“The closest interpretation on this planet’s Swing Ballet.” Tanzanite replied, blue eyes looking over Morganite critically. John looked down at those indigo toes, already flexing against the linoleum. “Yours is Contemporary. They’re cousins, close enough to merge without too much trouble. I’ll lead.”
“I'll talk to my mum and dad. I- I'm sure I can convince them. Once they see....” He trailed off then, and his cheeks turned ruddy in the dark. “Once they see how beautiful you are.”
He is mute to his private struggles, because in the end he found himself liking the strange and arrogant man who flipped his dark coat collar up against the wind and clicked his tongue in greeting.
Clawing their way into his head and poisoning his dreams. Leaving him screaming and thrashing in the dark as nurses tried to hold his tiny shuddering body still. John remembers that, the feeling of waking up and not knowing where he was or
“The three Dragon tribes lived and prospered in the world, connected together as a hive. Each tribe had a talent, a duty to help one another. The fire Dragons could fight, and were passionate and free. The Chinese could heal, and provided wisdom to those who sought them out.” Sherlock twiddled his hands together, his gaze falling to John’s mangled shoulder. “The Northern Dragons, could protect. Linking the tribes all together, the king of the North was able to touch the minds of all Dragons, and so in the process kept the balance of peace and harmony.” He wondered why he was doing this, but it soothed him in a way he couldn’t define.
“It’s a wedding song.” He murmured, and it was true that if he listened, Sherlock could make out some of the blessings written into the lyrics.
“And what if I were to tell you that this personality is far more than just a killer, Sherlock?” The elder Holmes cut his brother off harshly, his voice like nails against the inner tissue of Sherlock’s ears. “You’ve seen the potential intelligence that resides within John, his Alters have managed to build up a facade of normalcy but the reality remains that your companion is not a stable man, and hasn’t been for some time. Your
And most of all, he tried to forget the children, chained and wandering in the snow, and the childlike voice that had muttered behind him in that line, whispering words Sherlock didn't know the meaning of.
“There is a name.... one that has no face attached to it... because the man is hidden by layer upon layer of different masks and only surfaces when he is needed. And yet somehow, he is able to infiltrate every place. Every area. Yet at the same time vanish without a trace. It's a name no one says.” Mycroft's pale eyes sharpened minutely, and his mouth thinned into an expression of realisation as his hand tightened on the handle of his umbrella. His voice was heavy and commanding.
the scent that filled his nostrils. Immediately he clutched the fabric about his wiry frame, brushing his cheek against the oatmeal jumper before he could help himself and inhaling deeply.
He had knelt beside John's head, grasping his chin and forcing his mouth open, holding the cup to the young man's lips. John's pleas cut off as the liquid poured down his throat, heavy and rich and lethargic, vaguely spiced with something that reminded him of peppermint. As it flowed down his throat his limbs began to feel weighted, and clouds hummed dully in his mind as John fell slack, the drug filling him and turning his struggles into little more than weak thrashing. The young man had felt the priest's fingers carding once through his hair soothingly, regretfully, and then John remembered very little. Snippets and blurs. Someone disrobing him, the hot water of a bath. Harry's face briefly, pressing something in his palms until she realised he wasn't really there. Instead her hands tucked it into his belt. John found himself only coming to when the sun was already beginning to set, his wrists already chained and bound to the foot of the statue in the centre of the square.
security blanket, the pressing weight of Sherlock's body threatening to crack his ribs as the creature's tail wound itself about tightly.
“Last time he was posted here, our Bill didn't approve of physical punishment towards his Dragon. He thought her something 'special', exempt from the rules. Mr. Murray, care to show everyone the result of such foolish thinking?”
Still, he was reluctant to leave his newly made territory. His instincts told him that another Dragon could come along and take it if he left so soon. However his logical voice whispered to him that his senses were being stupid and that no other Dragon would actively do so unless ordered to by their Masters. Still, he crouched next to the door and breathed a thin line of frost across the entrance into the hardwood, making a visible warning for intruders both Human and Dragon alike to watch their step.
felt the urge to do anything as extreme as Sherlock had taken to doing. It was automatic, one last tie to Mummy Holmes that the detective hated as much as fell back on.
As it turned out, John was already awake, immersing himself in what could only be described as the hell that was editing his blog. Shyla stepped lightly into the living room to find the ex-army doctor seated in his chair, tongue stuck out in concentration as John did his chicken-tap tying, one key painfully at a time. The sight of it momentarily cut the detective’s uneasy mood short, a small smile coming to her face unbidden. John at times was so unassuming, so small and, well, adorable in his own dependable way. It was easy to forget sometimes that the man was in many ways just as much of a shut-in as Sherlock, not to mention the fact that the good doctor had extensive military training. Languidly, Shyla flounced forward, falling onto the sofa in the characteristically lazy manner to which she was accustomed. John noticed her out of the corner of his eye, humming a greeting.
” Elena exclaimed seriously, perching herself up atop a snow bank with the lurking qualities of a gargoyle. John snorted in laughter, unable to help himself as she wobbled, losing her footing to slide to the bottom of the hill with an
She waved slightly with her left hand, rubbing at her eyes as she was suddenly overcome with a desire to sleep. It was the Blackness calling her, she knew. The place where she drifted sometimes, not quite awake and not yet asleep. Alive but stored away somehow....
The Fire Dragon, still quivering took off like a shot, her dark eyes huge and fearful. Her voice trilled in his mind, a bird quickly fading with her form.
It appeared however that such a thing was the wrong thing to say, as the Dragon's eyes darkened, and his upper lip curled in fury.
“I see in you probably something softer. A caretaker for when you are off and abroad perhaps? Something to keep you warm on a cold Desert night?”
It was a terrible tapestry, in the sense that it was so lifelike John could swear he could hear the anguished being’s screams depicted. It was a thing of shadow, clawing its way as if trying to break free from its fabric-bonds. On a background of blood red its eyes glowed with blue fire, a gaping maw seeming to be open in agony as the being was being struck in half with a silver arrow. In its expression was nothing but hatred.
In response Sherlock snorted, gazing up at the clouded sky. Snow flakes fell, clumping in his dark lashes. When he blinked they melted, streaming down his face in a caricature of tears. Though his words were mocking, his hands were tight in his pockets. Tense.
Lestrade’s fingers brushed a chest- bound down but still noticeably curved- before the teen’s teeth had sunken themselves deeply enough into the arm to draw blood.  A yelp sounded, loud enough to alert the other police sergeants to the spectacle. Even back then, Sherlock Holmes had been a right tosser.
He kept it in iron control, creeping upwards slowly and refusing to break into a run, but he still couldn't stop his stomach from protesting its emptiness loudly or his nostrils from flaring with desire.
She nodded enthusiastically before she could help herself, looking at Sherlock with delighted blue eyes. The detective watched as his friend shook his head in affirmation emphatically, the dip of his blonde head a full-body kind of movement.
Their eyes were dark and deep, the colour of rich chocolate, and they held the upper half of their bodies up with a certain sort of grace. On land they appeared chunky and awkward, but John could see the power in those tails. He knew somehow without even having seen them swim that the seals below would be beautiful and graceful in the water.
“Ah, but you'd have to stop me from shooting myself first, Mr. Holmes. Do you think you could cross this room before I pulled the trigger? One of my personalities at least
The detective knew about him, his freakish condition, and yet here he was steering him to bed instead of out into the streets. John felt a warmth swelling in his chest, something fiery and furiously bright. He turned, leaning into Sherlock's tall chest, and muttered two words.
Which is why he doesn't tell Sherlock his secret, even when the man asks if he wants to share a flat with him.
“Amazing.” He repeated softly, reaching out one hesitant hand as if to brush Sherlock's shoulder. The Dragon flinched initially away, but then leaned into the touch as the soldier continued.
He tucked his nose back against the jumper, dreams already filtering into his mind. Flickers of images. Stars. Snow.
John thought that there wasn’t a prettier sound than the needy timbre of Shyla’s voice, that was until he hooked his fingers into the band of the panties and shrugged them down, licking a hot stripe against Shyla’s clit. Normally, Shyla was a bit hesitant about partners seeing her parts. Testosterone was not gentle in its results, and normally Sherlock was more than happy with the tiny dick that had grown with his beard and the rumble of his voice. Now, however, Shyla bit her lip, unsure if John would react well. The detective barely managed to stay upright when her companion barely hesitated, leaning forward to taste, his hands curling about her hips.
John emphasized, old annoying flaring up as he rolled his eyes “I'm fed up with him believing I'm helpless, and fed up with him constantly believing he can just sacrifice his own safety to protect
John only allowed himself to feel triumph when the Dragon turned abruptly, marching towards the fire escape. Sherlock, as elegant as a bloody swan and twice as gangly, sat on the window pane for a moment and smirked in invitation. Then, the Dragon slowly,
John had heard of nymphs and their kind, mostly stories from his grandparents about how they once inhabited the rivers and oceans that had once surrounded Reichenbach. Tales of beautiful maidens and men that would bask upon stones in the water and sing strange melodies came to him like the lingering flavour of a long forgotten wine.  It marked his thoughts, and it made John wary of the creature’s hands, delicate but tipped with webbings and predatory claws. It was an homage to her potentially dangerous nature. Though, John supposed if Molly had left him alone in the pool, the mermaids weren’t known for drowning humans.
He was unaware when Mrs. Hudson carefully stepped into his hoard, singing halting as she brought something held carefully in her hands. When she reached the edge of the couch she stopped, listening for a moment to the high keening growls that the Dragon made as he tried to make himself shrink into a sharp bundle of elbows and knees. It was the same sort of noise that she had watched Hatchlings make when they
Sherlock came, hearing Molly’s calls after spending nearly an hour at the fountain. What he saw made his brows draw together, an inexplicable emotion tugging at his chest at the sight of John, shaking and crying in a mess of pottery and his own blood.
John however found himself fighting her grip, unwilling to be pulled away. He could taste the danger in the air, thick and copper-tasting on the roof of his mouth. He didn't know what was going to happen, but he felt an instinctive urge to run, to clutch at his father's hand and his mother's gown and to cry against them like he was a little kid. Like he was five instead of older.
That is, until John later admitted that later on in the day he had booked Sherlock three uninterrupted hours in the morgue with the latest victim of a serial killer, courtesy of one Molly Hooper and Greg Lestrade.
He had made a brief shopping trip, casually throwing out John's horrid jumper and baggy jeans and turning in favour of a dark leather jacket over a deep blue shirt. Tight-fitted charcoal grey pants hugged his hips, and dark shoes gave the appearance of his skin looking almost ghostly under the hazed lights of the club. Loud music hummed deep in the base of his spine, pulsating with a rhythm that is almost as intense as the several dancers that are already there when he arrives. Though it is only mid-afternoon, already a fair few people are undulating under the lights, holding drinks in their hands that shimmer like fireflies in a starless sky as they grind against one another. The flavour of the air was just beginning to thicken, that fine line between heady sexual tension and good clean fun that stirred up Sneak's interest and made him almost light-headed with want. It had been too long since he'd been allowed to roam free, and he made his way to the bar swiftly to order himself a drink. The bartender was a woman with skin the exact same shade as the inside of a walnut, freckles dusted lightly across her nose and hair dark as leather itself. She smiled in a friendly way towards Sneak, but the man knew immediately that she's not looking for a shag any time soon tonight. Her entire stance read
“You need to give me time,” Irene begged weakly, fidgeting in her seat. She had been a fool to get this deep, to immerse herself so totally. Yet there hadn’t been a choice at the time, and now she was paying for her own folly, ensnared in a spider’s web. “I’ll bring him to you willingly, I
No one knew what Moriarty looked like, but within the span of an evening it seemed that there wasn’t a news broadcast that would shut up about him.
“Stand-ah! Stand down you fucking cur! Fucking hell stand down or I’ll have you put down I swear on my fucking life!”
too, signed up for the army actually because I was scouted over it. This is my third tour. I'm an old pro by this point.” He chuckled good-naturedly, and John lit up with excitement as he asked
John’s eyes were closed, but he was not currently in the midst of dreams. Instead, he lay curled on the edge of the spacious bed, the chain a heavy weight around his ankle that could not be ignored. The sheets covered it, but he could still feel it chafing against his skin. It was dark in the room, the night sky black save for the number of stars exploding across its surface. When John had looked through the spacious balcony that lead from the room, he hadn’t been able to help but gape. For what he had before only known as specks of silver light were now a veritable
Greg would catch Benson in the act of lifting opiates from the evidence locker a week later. He would then consider the fact that he was fast coming to rely on a junkie of all people to help out with his job. It would be this thought that would lead to many a night drinking, and many a night considering Sherlock Holmes a tentative friend in time.
“Four hundred years ago.” Greg reminded, eyebrows raising slightly as he shrugged. “Long before either of us were born.”
His stubbornness lasted for about fifteen seconds before a strange and wonderful smell drifted past Sherlock's nose, perking his interest reluctantly. Something greasy and fatty and
John, mostly operating by feel, was pleasantly surprised as Sherlock let out a hoarse cry, his prick throbbing on his tongue. Getting the hang of it, then. He supposed it made sense that he was a quick learner, given what Sneak’s history had once been. He could tell that his lover was close, and going half on hazy memories but mostly on instinct John sped his ministrations, light but quick and in such a way that out of the corner of his eye he could see Sherlock’s toes curl in building climax.
They sat curled in front of the fire, John having one of the huge, ugly patchwork quilts his grandmother knit wrapped around his skinny shoulders like a cocoon. He sat on the rug cross-legged by her feet, the old woman creaking in her rocking chair as she stared into the hissing and crackling flames. The little boy's toes wriggled in their striped socks as he watched the licking fire dance its way across the warm wood, the sound loud in the silence as Harry was in her room and John's parents had decided to take a walk on the beach. In the dimmed room, John thought his grandma looked somewhat mysterious as she spoke, her eyes shadowed in darkness as she murmured to him in her soft Irish brogue.
kept people connected by using their links to the soldier’s Dragons, functioning as radios might to keep the squadron leaders informed of what was happening. Already, John could feel Benson’s Dragon; Farrow seeking him out. The Dragon’s steady presence was a balm to John’s adrenaline, calmly relaying information.
Sherlock found himself imagining the scenario, John, a small and scared little boy. He would have been shorter definitely, and his eyes probably wider. Not so many lines creasing his face. Skinny, if the state of Foster Care systems were still as deplorable as Sherlock suspected them
His expression was so soft, so fragile, that John found himself soothing the detective, even though he didn't understand. He didn't know what Sherlock was talking about, what had him so worked up. Yet the Dragon was so obviously distressed that the army doctor couldn't bring himself to even entertain the idea of upsetting him further. Sighing, John reassured his husband even as his anger melted away.
She leaned into her husband's side as if without him she would crumble, tired eyes stained with bruised purple on the undersides and mouth a thin, pinched line. The doctor smiled reassuringly, adjusting his glasses on his nose before replying.
garner together to the youngest's benefit, hoping to gain a sizable dowry when she turned sixteen in a few months.
Instead, his voice was very suddenly drowned out by a howl that made the very marrow in his bones shudder. John turned as if in slow motion, trying to find the source of the noise. It was to hear his sister of all people let out a terrible scream, and Sherlock utter out a sudden snarl of surprise and fury.
It would be a guessing game it looked like, and John Watson despite his irritation found himself not for the first time willing to play.
Sherlock didn’t have even a moment to reassure the man that he would live to see another day, although the notion that John had expected to die and had been willing to go with it filled him with a mixture of curious exasperation and a tentative fondness that he refused to dwell upon. In that moment, the Demon had barely a moment to move as his sensitive ears caught the whizz of an arrow, ducking as it flew past where he had crouched only a moment before only to lodge itself into the opposite wooden wall. Curled defensively, the Demon didn’t bother with trousers or his tunic, teeth bared menacingly and black cloak flared at the man that stood silhouetted in the exit. Oak-brown hair glinted in the moonlight, and Michael Stamford resisted the urge to shake like a leaf, keeping his bow as level as he could. His voice shook with terror.
John rushed to say that Sherlock had never hurt him that way, immediately horrified and on the defensive. Greg raised a hand to stop him.
However it was silent in her head, so obviously the older personality had no comment on her complaints. She huffed slightly, moving with almost inhuman speed towards the door to the bedroom.
“More of a communication line, in truth,” Mycroft murmured “It is truthfully not my place to explain in detail, but there is a reason that Sherlock and I regard each other as siblings. Are you aware of how Gems procreate?”
With that, the great Dragon slept, soft breaths stirring the hay with a gentle breeze. John left, feeling a twisting mixing of emotions that he had no idea how to handle, or how to address.
“Didn’t anyone ever tell you not to play with your food?” Sherlock rumbled with feigned casualty, leaning against the gate in observation.
She looked at him, translucent tears falling from her face as she rested on the tea chest at the foot of the bed. Her voice cracked, trying to be strong despite the shaking of her hands.
“My little Johnny! I've missed you! Look how much you've grown since I've last seen you…” The crashing of the waves muted some of her assessing murmurs as she held the boy out at arms-length, inspecting him closely with a sharp blue-eyed gaze that made John feel as if every thought he ever had was being laid bare before him. A tanned hand reached forward to tip his chin up slightly, and the expression softened into something gentler as she returned to holding him close.
Carefully, he slunk along the wall towards the door, forcing his breathing to be measured and calming the heartbeat pounding in his ears. He saw the creature's ears flick towards him, but other than that there was no response. It seemed that the beast was too lost in its own consciousness, drifting like a piece of wood on a sea that John couldn't imagine the colour of.
Instead, true to John's earlier promise, he was carefully approached, asked for consent before he was even touched, and then only to be moved, nothing more. John's hands were calloused but steady, Sherlock noticed, and they were warm where they lingered for a moment on his skin. They did not drift anywhere, did not search save for injury or damage. The soldier took stock of Sherlock's knees after he had managed to coax the borderline catatonic Dragon over to the chair, wincing at a particularly deep gash across his shin.
There was a give and take in everything. Pain cancelled out pleasure. Pleasure muffled pain. Food was traded for hunger, and hunger called for nutrition in kind. Whips were the exchange for defiance, and rebellion was rewarded with blood.
Greg, seeming to sense his friend’s mood mercifully let it drop, smoking grey rings even as the last of the sun sunk below the horizon. With it, darkness truly settled over the land, and John saw the lights of his town snuff out one by one, people boarding up their windows and locking their doors tightly. Not a soul would leave their homes, not tonight. Not on Hallows’ Eve, when the realm between the Earth and the strange land of the Others wore thin, permitting its creatures to cross over. John sat tensed and poised, even as Greg left to take his own position. This year, this year no one would be taken.
“Why, of course, I do! D'you think I've just been sittin' here all this time, twiddling my thumbs when I knew you were coming? Tonight's story is going to be better than all the others, and d'you want to know
“Yes, it's always about doing the right thing with you two. Cleansing London of the very person that did you wrong so long ago. Tell me, who were they? An uncle? Or perhaps an aunt with a particular fetish-”
“Um.” He said, which in retrospect was perhaps rather inelegant. The Gem responded by blinking, peering at him consideringly before speaking in a voice that was melodious but undeniably feminine.
“Will be fine. I’m assigning Murray to look after him during your absence. Don’t worry John, Cerioth will also be placed in the palace. You won’t be without protection.”
long enough to notice.” Irene huffed, as if the detective wasn’t just standing frozen amongst the carnage. She stepped forward lightly, the click of her boots loud on the tiled floor. Past Sherlock, towards the safe. Irene pressed her fingers to the keypad, dialing in the numbers. She pulled out a blackberry phone, holding it in her hands triumphantly. She levelled Sherlock with a cool smile.
Dragon into a frothing rage prove anything? Did you test Mike this way as well? Because if you did I'll have you know that you terrorized a victim used to being lied to and taken advantage of. Molly-”
complex to solve. Already Sherlock found himself running into some frankly alarming dead-ends. Sebastian Wilkes had only been so helpful in his information, and though the body of his coworker
He did not notice the small figure of the boy as it slid down the rocks, the sounds drowned out by the storm that raged around the pup. He did not hear the tears, not until after the waves calmed and shuddered, like a great bird whose feathers had been ruffled. He did not smell the blood until he realised that his
“Yes,” he found himself saying, and Sherlock's eyes if possible sparked even brighter. The roaring in John's ears increased, and he cried out in a mixture of pain and shock as suddenly, his friend wrenched his wrist forward and bit down.
and alternatively shouting at Sherlock to run. The Dragon did no such thing, ears flattened to the side of his head in resignation for what was about to come. His eyes were wary slits, but they remained fixated upon his own feet. The mark of someone submissive. John felt hot fear tighten in his chest at the sight.
The unhappy set of the man’s shoulders is evident to the detective. As is the reluctance to listen to his words. Yet Daniel’s teeth snag on his lower lip in indecision, and for just a second, Sherlock glimpses John underneath it. Like seeing underneath a veil.
When they get home, Sherlock stands in the doorway for a few long moments. “About the kissing…” he says, trailing off because he has no idea how to end this sentence.
Sherlock looks at the cigarette and silently thinks to himself that John makes a good point. But putting out the cigarette would prove John right, and Sherlock hates it when people tell him what to do.
“I’m glad you took a chance on me,” John says, swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat. “I probably wouldn’t have had the guts to make the first move. It just boggled my mind that you’d be interested in me. Still does.”
So John is really about to perform a public service, as well as making it quite plain that Sherlock is very much his, thank you very much. And it’s not that John is jealous of people Sherlock kisses on stage, that’s just silly, but he isn’t above the occasional claim-staking. Especially when handsome whippersnappers give him condescending side-eyes while hitting on his husband.
He rents a car and drives most of the day, which is good because it gives him something to do other than gnaw his own arm off in nervous anticipation.
“What?” he asks again, more grumpily this time. Then he realises that Sherlock has left his spot on the floor, and that he’s actually
In the morning, everything is sharp and heavy and dull, and in the cool daylight, there’s nothing warm and dark and dangerous in John’s eyes at all.
“Nothing. Don’t engage, otherwise he’ll never stop. He just wants attention, and if we react, he’ll get more of it.”
John checks his compass and swallows. “Sherlock,” he says, and Sherlock looks up to meet his worried gaze. “That's not north.”
He finds John within two hours, at Bart’s, oncology, and the moment he walks into that room he knows John’s got maybe three months to live, and that night after the by now usual anger and yelling and kissing, he crawls into bed with John with a syringe and two lethal doses of morphine, and he asks, and John says yes, and god, Sherlock, thank God it’s you, and it’s the last thing either of them hears, John whispering Sherlock’s name...
John just grins at him, and they finish their meal in companionable silence. Some of the nervous energy seems to seep out of Sherlock while he sips his tea, and John is grateful. When Sherlock finally stops fidgeting and seems to settle down for a long think, John feels settled enough to ask, “Do we go to Lestrade?”
Sherlock doesn’t answer, and his even breathing tells John that he has fallen asleep. He leans down and lets his lips brush against Sherlock’s forehead, just once, hating himself a bit for that stolen caress that would never be welcome if Sherlock were awake.
John just nods, because when Sherlock puts it this way, he’s right, it’s obvious. “So Lestrade was here.”
Sherlock sets down the water, thermometer and medicine on John’s nightstand and goes to empty out the waste paper basket into the loo. He cleans it out a bit and brings it back with him.
Sherlock is gone for 24 hours. John tries hard not to panic. He hides Sherlock’s absence from Mrs Hudson as well as he can, which isn’t difficult because he rarely attends school and often misses meals. He also tries to hide his growing worry and fear, and that’s much harder. He lies awake half the night, waiting for Sherlock to sneak in. Normally he curses Sherlock for how noisy he can be when John tries to sleep, but the unnatural silence in their room keeps him awake more completely than Sherlock’s banging and muttering ever could.
But now, apparently, John has softened somewhat. Now, maybe, John will let him explain. Now, maybe, John is prepared to try to forgive him.
“At the beginning,” Sherlock says, and John glares at him. Sherlock rolls his eyes and adds, in a softer tone, “I suspect you ran away from your posting because the farmer you were stationed with made unwanted advances toward you, correct?”
“Go where?” John asks, gesturing around them. The fog surrounds them like a wall, muffing all sounds of life. They could be the last two beings on this world, for all John knows.
A noise that can only be a gunshot cracks through the night air. “Step away from him, please,” Sherlock says, sounding calm as anything.
By mutual if silent consent, they’ve been walking aimlessly around the city, and now along the river. The enormity of Kitty’s revelations hasn’t even begun to register, and John feels utterly unequipped to deal with any of it.
The judges move from station to station. The pies are mostly competently made, but with one glance, Sherlock already knows that only Irene’s, Moriarty’s and his stand out. Irene’s is textbook perfect, brown, flaky crust, not a soggy bottom in sight. Her filling smells perfect as well, and the judges are thrilled.
Two people are still struggling with their pies. A man with a perpetually sneering, yet overwhelmed expression has torn his crust. Not enough butter. Classic mistake. A woman is near tears because her filling is leaking out of the pie form, complaining loudly about how soggy her bottom is going to be. She’s not the only one. He’s heard worries about soggy bottoms from everybody in the room except John, Jim and Irene.
John runs a hand through his filthy hair and breathes out heavily. “Look, we’re stranded here. We can’t get home, and nobody is helping us. Everybody says it’s impossible. Do you know how we could get home?”
Sometimes he feels bad for reveling in Sherlock’s loneliness, his friendlessness, the void that is his life.
But then Donovan says, “You know, these are perfect and all, but I can’t see how these make you nostalgic for anything. Nostalgia is supposed to make you think of your grandma’s kitchen, or Christmas mornings, but this is just a very good dessert I would get in a high-class restaurant. This isn’t what the show is, Jim. So I give you full marks for technical, but I’m afraid this isn’t at all on topic.”
Sherlock ignores him until he’s out of the door, then closes and locks the door to his flat. “I should change the locks.”
“John, help me out here,” Sherlock turns to John for confirmation. “You agreed with me at the time.”
There are a few stray chuckles from the other people around the table, and Irene starts talking to Molly about her bake for the last show before the final. But John’s eyes stay on Sherlock and he gives him that look, that
Sure now that something is bumping against the wall of the sitting room, he gets out of bed and stumbles down the stairs. Most likely Sherlock is just up to Sherlockian things, but there is a distinct possibility that the something bumping against the wall might be Sherlock himself being thrown against it - wouldn’t be the first time - so John goes to investigate.
She sighs, and he can see the anger seep out of her, slowly, leaving an exhaustion behind he’s deeply familiar with. “I don’t know. How did you forgive Sherlock?”
“Ah, Sherlock, my boy,” Mr. Musgrave says, and then his eyes alight on John. “And you brought a guest?” he asks, surprise very much evident on his face.
Irene, Janine, and Molly are at the second cup of tea stage of breakfast when he joins them in the dining room.
John shrugs. “It’s difficult to explain…” He looks away from Sherlock, down at the mossy ground down by the river bed, at lights going on behind the windows of the city, at the slowly darkening sky. “I… it’s not the war. I’m not afraid to fight.” He huffs a little laugh, then corrects himself, “Okay, actually, I’m a lot afraid, but that’s not it. I’m proud to serve my King and my country. It’s…” he sighs and runs a hand through his hair in frustration. “If I survive, and that’s a big if... “ he swallows. “I’ll never be a doctor.”
“Yeah, right. That’s why you’re leaning against me like you’ll fall over any minute, and that’s why you’re dropping half your syllables when you talk.”
Sergeant Donovan steps out from the shadow of the half-collapsed barn, aiming a nasty-looking crossbow at the killer. “Hands over your head, if you please.”
This is why John is the only non-actor at the Barbican’s ‘Last Show, Thank God, Also Christmas’ party, and he’s here exclusively because his husband was the lead actor of the production they’re currently celebrating the last night of.
Sherlock takes a few steps towards him and smiles at him in a ‘there you are, I’ve missed you’ sort of way, and John can’t help himself: he pulls Sherlock in for a very public but very necessary kiss.
As soon as Glen yells cut, John walks out without looking at anyone, and Sherlock can feel the entire tent glancing at him with badly suppressed curiosity.
Sherlock washes his hands at the hospital and while he watches the bloodied water drain out of the basin, he slowly and surely deletes everything about this night.
“Now, Sherlock, what’s your inspiration?” Donovan asks, and he can tell that she’s sceptical about his bake. “This seems very simple for you.”
Sherlock actually blushes a bit, which John finds utterly charming. “Not sex...” He gestures between the two of them. “But all the rest of it, too. Remembering birthdays, and getting dinner, and asking how your day was, and all the rest of the tedious nonsense people seem to value so highly.” He looks down at where his hands are still fisted in John’s jumper. “Being honest,” he adds quietly. “Not hurting you all the time.”
“You think it’s just you?” John pants against Sherlock’s lips between sips of increasingly feral kisses. “Fuck, I think of you every fucking second of every day. Baking, working, walking, going to sleep.”
“Gorgeous,” John whispers, biting kisses down Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock runs his hands over every part of John he can reach, finally settling on his butt cheeks, pressing him down so the lovely, lovely friction will stay just where he wants it, needs it. He’s so hard he can see stars, and he hasn’t felt like this in ages, like his skin is too small to contain him.
Sherlock doesn’t even meet his gaze, he’s just staring at the floor as if it holds the answer to everything.
“Have fun,” Mr Chatterjee calls back from behind the counter before continuing to serve the line of customers. He turns to Sherlock between serving two customers. “Can you just push another tray of the croissants into the oven before you go?”
Irene grins. “Anywhere. We could do anything. Be anything. Think of it, Sherlock. No more boring rules. We go where we want, do what we want. Who could stop the two of us, together?”
For a moment, Sherlock looks sheepish. “Sorry.” Then he waves it away. “That was yesterday. I’m fine now.”
“There’s flour on your nose,” Sherlock says apropos of nothing, a spectacular example of his brain to mouth filter malfunctioning.
“Yes,” Sherlock mutters, gripping John’s hands like his life depends on it. He thrusts up into John, and John feels it down to his toes, feels his entire body sing and respond. He’s painfully, achingly aroused and any coherence he had left flees when Sherlock thrusts up again. They move together, and it’s sweaty and uncoordinated and messy and fucking perfect.
He takes his time getting her back into her crib. She wakes again when he puts her down, and this time she isn’t so easily placated, so he takes her out, changes her, then carries her around a bit.
John rubs a hand over the back of his neck and looks into his tea as if it holds the answer to anything. He’s silent for so long that Sherlock is sure he won’t answer. But then he sighs and seems to come to a decision. “Honestly?” He looks up and meets Sherlock’s curious gaze with a small self-deprecating smile. “This is something I will never say on tv. But. Afghanistan.”
Sherlock’s eyes are overly bright and he looks at John like he’s never seen him before. He’s breathing like he’s just run a race. “That…” he says, “that… was…” He swallows. “Good,” he finally forces out.
She busies herself smoothing over Sherlock’s bed-cover, straightening his blanket. “Odd to see him this still, isn’t it?”
Friday they were at the bank robbery crime scene, and Sherlock didn’t seem very interested; he didn’t give Lestrade his usual waterfall of deductions, he just laid out the most pertinent facts and left. The whole thing took ten minutes and was completely unremarkable. Saturday John was at the clinic, and Sherlock was still in his dressing gown when John came back. They watched a bit of telly and Sherlock fell asleep on the sofa. Sunday they had lunch out and walked a bit around Regent’s Park then spent the rest of the day reading in companionable silence in the sitting room. Nothing happened.
John looks away again, hand rubbing at the phantom ache in his leg, an automatic, unconscious gesture. “Don’t for a moment think that I don’t know what you were trying to do in that aquarium.” His voice is quiet and harsh and angry. “You knew she was going to get violent, and you drew her attention so she’d shoot you and nobody else.”
Slowly, his anger recedes, as he realises that Sherlock is right. He loved every second of it right up until the moment Mrs Hudson told them they’re stuck.
He turns to Sherlock, and he looks so lost for a moment that Sherlock wants to press their bodies together and hold onto John until he feels better, and it’s so far removed from the dizzying lust he felt not five minutes ago that he experiences something not unlike emotional whiplash.
John pauses, and Sherlock wonders whether he should say something. But John continues before he can make up his mind. “Last night…” Sherlock can feel John press his lips together against Sherlock’s skin, can feel the tremor of emotion that runs through his body. “She said she wasn’t drunk. She said she slipped. Fell into her glass couch table. She needed thirty-nine stitches.” John sighs, and Sherlock can feel his exhaustion in every movement of his body. “It wasn’t the first time she hurt herself while drunk. But it was the worst, so far. And I...I just. I can’t do this anymore. But I can’t not do it either.”
“Let me show you why weighing and measuring your ingredients properly is so very important,” Sherlock says into the camera.
“The Gate,” Sherlock says, impatiently running a hand through his curls. “It should have been obvious much sooner!”
But he knows he could never express any of the appreciation he feels for them in words, so he turns back to stretching his dough, and the two hosts leave him to it.
“I want my violin.” Oh what he’d give to have it now, to put bow to strings and just let the music take him anywhere it pleases.
"I know some people who are looking for flatshares you might get along with," Molly says, setting her cup of coffee down on the counter.
John stretches and Sherlock turns his head to look at John. “Finally. I thought you’d sleep all day.”
Mary rolls her eyes. “John. Please. We’ve got six light cues left. We can do it tomorrow morning before the actors come in. You’re clearly done for.”
“Do you think the Irregulars are compromised?” John asks, and he knows his tone reflects his worry about Billy especially.
"The surprise party? For John's birthday?" Janine pauses for a few seconds. "Wait, are you not in the group chat?"
“Of course,” Mary immediately says and hands John a shot of vodka. “Just one, you’ve got rehearsals in the morning, and we need at least one sober stage manager.”
He looks around for a cab, but then he notices a black car with tinted windows sliding up to the curb.
He thought that seeing John again would finally convince him that he did the right thing six years ago, that there’s nothing there anymore, that John is ordinary and boring and not worth his time at all.
It’s not like he hasn’t thought about it before. It’s not like it isn’t tempting to give into the pull, every time they stumble back to their dark flat after a successful case, adrenaline rushing, eyes meeting, sparks flying. It would be so easy just to grab John, fist his hands in his jacket, push him against the wall and kiss him.
“Probably,” John says with a shrug. He gives Sherlock a small smile. “I hope I’ll find out one of these days.”
It occurs to him that for his own sanity, and for John’s sake, to enable them both to move on, he should say yes. Then John would get married in peace and Sherlock would not wonder anymore what John was doing, would just know that door was closed.
He accepts the food and water gratefully, and he feels much better for it. “Thank you,” he says, then goes over to Sherlock with the water skin.
The all-night cafe is lit by ancient neon lights that wash the colour out of everything. Not that the decor could be helped by better lighting. Beige walls, small, cracked, ugly formica tables, plastic chairs. It’s a depressing place, neon sign in the window flickering on and off.
John is numb. He feels a bit like he’s been out in the cold for a while, like he can’t feel his fingers and toes.
“Well, I’m pretty sure you’re not baking scones,” John replies, calmly. “And I surely hope you’re not making tomorrow’s dinner.”
“No, they don’t. You’re just ignoring facts you don’t like to fit your theory. Why should she kill herself because her friend did? It makes no sense!” Sherlock exclaims, gesturing at Kitty. “She was being threatened by the same men who killed Violet. You’re being deliberately obtuse because you don’t want to admit you were wrong about Violet.”
me the money, that is a significant difference,” Sherlock points out, subtly pushing the plate with the scones even closer to Mycroft. “Try them with the raspberry-currant jam.”
Sherlock nods and greedily watches John’s every expression, every stroke and flick and twist of his hand, every shudder and bitten-off moan until he can’t take it anymore and all but pounces on John.
be an objective way to say whether something is good or not,” Sherlock answers. “There are objective criteria to measure the quality of anything, there have to be, otherwise science as we know it would not be possible.”
When he comes out again with his bag, he meets John, who’s standing under the awning of the hotel’s front entrance, duffle bag at his feet, hands jammed into the pockets of his jacket, looking unhappily at the dark sky.
Sherlock shivers a bit at the tone of John’s voice and the sudden nearness of his body. He opens his mouth and John feeds him the bite-sized piece of potato. It’s a perfect mouthful of food, the warm mealiness of the potato turned creamy by the melted butter, the salt a perfect tickling on his tongue. He looks down at John, who’s smiling at him in a way that makes Sherlock’s stomach flutter. John is standing very close, and suddenly the room is very small.
Billy has no new information, as it turns out, he just needs money for the Irregulars. They exchange a few terse insults, and Billy’s off again with a few coppers and instructions not to let the museum out of their sight.
John looks at him, a bit startled. But he says nothing as Sherlock pulls him in and kisses him, deep and dirty and suggestive.
John looks at him with an amused smirk. “You really want to put out your cigarette right now but won’t because that would mean I’m right, don’t you?”
The house before them is big and tastefully over-decorated. Two large, festively trimmed firs flank the front of the house, and a giant wreath obscures most of the front door.
Then, suddenly, John starts giggling. “That was one of the more ridiculous things I’ve done,” he hiccups between laughter, and Sherlock can’t help himself, he chuckles.
And all the while there’s this expression on his face, greedy, insatiable, watching Sherlock’s face like he wants to preserve the memory of every reaction, every moan, whispered word, every twitch of his face, every inch of his body.
He’s about to pass when he realises there’s still light under the stage entrance door. Before he can talk himself out of it, he opens the door and passes through the dark green room to the stage manager’s office door.
“Don’t be absurd, of course I can walk,” Sherlock mutters and actually manages to get to his feet. He sways alarmingly for a few seconds, but he manages to keep upright.
“Bloody hell.” Mary takes away his beer and pulls him to his feet. “You need something stronger than beer. Come on.”
With clumsy fingers he opens John’s fly and pushes his underwear out of the way, reaching for John’s cock without a hint of finesse. It’s been so long, and he’s missed this so much, the smell of John, the feel of him, the way he looks and sounds.
He sinks down to his knees next to the couch and stares at John for a while. The moonlight makes him look paler than he is.
John doesn’t know why. Maybe it’s the life-saving. Maybe it’s the army background. Maybe it’s the fact that John doesn’t feel threatened by Sherlock’s intellect but admires it. Maybe it’s just John’s stupid fanboy-admiration for Sherlock’s sheer brilliance. Maybe it’s that John occasionally tells Sherlock to stuff it, to shut up, that he’s an idiot, and maybe he’s the only one who’s ever said that to Sherlock and meant it affectionately. Maybe it’s the fact that he’s just as screwed up as Sherlock is.
“It’s one thing we learned from the Fey’a,” Billy says with a grin. “They’re plenty adventurous when it comes to sex. Taught our ancestors a thing or two. You should see their sex books.” His grin widens. “I should get you one. Would close some of your knowledge gaps.”
“Do you want me to die of frustration?” John answers, gasping when Sherlock teases his tongue along the edges of John’s pyjama pants.
“You heard our judges,” Mrs Turner announces into the camera, “the competition is still wide open, though Sherlock has edged out a lead with his technical proficiency. Can John surprise again? Will Irene or Jim fight them for the top spots? I guess we’ll find out tomorrow.”
Sherlock is torn between embarrassment, amusement at Mycroft’s shock, and something in his chest that he refuses to name, that reacts to John’s mussed hair and the rumpled t-shirt that is obviously Sherlock’s, the way he blinks and looks at Mycroft, and then at Sherlock. “Am I interrupting something?” John asks, looking and sounding a bit confused.
Sherlock sighs and looks at his alarm clock. 1:12 am. Fantastic. The perfect time to tell a three-and-a-half-year-old her mother was murdered. “No, love. Mummy wasn’t sick.”
Sherlock smiles back automatically, feeling the rush of adrenaline flood his senses with the hyper awareness that usually comes when he’s on stage. John leans closer to him. “You remember the first day of rehearsal, when I said I’d moved on?”
“And you invaded Afghanistan,” he says, and John laughs some more, body tipping forward until he leans against Sherlock.
Sherlock feels himself smiling back almost automatically. “Let’s say the line to inedible remains firmly uncrossed.”
Sherlock doesn’t live very far away, so they decide to walk. London is bustling, even at this time of night, and they take their time. They walk past the busy Baker Street tube station and along sidewalks teeming with tourists and locals.
John’s door is ajar and the bedside lamp is on. Sherlock enters without knocking, and John only lifts his head a bit, then lets it drop back down onto the pillow.
“First, because we don’t actually have the lodestone. And second, and I don’t believe I need to even say this: Because he’s a killer, we can’t ignore that,” John points out, trying to stay calm, but honestly he’s a bit worried by now.
Sherlock shrugs. “It was… well, very American, I suppose. As in everything is bigger, and they want everything done in half the time. Also, six month runs are hell.”
John is just placing the last of his scones on his cake stand. Sherlock has arranged his savoury macarons so they’re aesthetically pleasing as well as delicious. When he returns with the scones and the small bowl of strawberry jam, his foot snags on a power cable that’s somehow escaped from its gaffer-taped prison.
Mrs Hudson and Lestrade go on hashing out details, but John only listens with half an ear, most of his attention focussed on the headshot Mrs Hudson was indicating before.
“I just pointed out that my hands are bigger, after you asked me a question. I started absolutely nothing. And you realise I’m going to have to edit this out, meaning more work for me, so please just stick to the baking.”
At the door of Baker Street School, Sherlock hesitates. “You go on up,” he says, “I’ll go see Billy, and then I’m going by the Watch to give a statement.”
Then he takes the two mugs into the sitting room and hands one to John. John takes it with a nod of thanks.
Sherlock hesitates, because of course he does. Dark chocolate, cranberry jelly for the bottom cake, vanilla and raspberries for the middle cake. On top, a small cake, just for the two of them, poppy seed, raspberry jam, sloppily baked, entirely perfectly imperfect. “If I did, would that be a problem?”
He has no idea what to say. John apparently doesn’t, either, and he’s not the type to talk just for the sake of it. It’s one of the things Sherlock appreciates most about him. He despises the meaningless chatter people fill the air with to prevent socially awkward situations.
“I got better offers in New York. More interesting parts. I was seen more. Got a higher profile. It didn’t matter that I didn’t like it, it was the right thing to do for my career, so I did it.”
Sherlock has fallen into one of his silent spells again, sitting in front of the blackboard where he’s pinned all the information they’ve accumulated about the gates. He’s added some equations John doesn’t even pretend to begin to understand.
“Anyway,” Jim says, patting John’s knee almost amicably and getting to his feet again. “He should be here any minute. I’ve sent him an invitation. Seb!”
“I want to state that I’m the dissenting voice this week,” Moran states. “I see Sally and Greg’s point, but I disagree with their conclusion.”
“Fine.” He doesn’t point out the fact that she should have gone through his agent, because he appreciates the time constraint, and also, if she’d gone through his agent, he would have been almost forced to say no.
Guests are already milling about, greeting friends and family. Irene, Neela, Mary and Mike are standing in the shade under a nearby tree, with Mike’s wife and Irene’s girlfriend. Irene calls their names and they make their way over to join them.
There’s a stripe of flour on the side of his face, and Sherlock can’t take his eyes off it. He’s been thinking of reaching over and wiping it off with his thumb for about ten minutes now.
John watches the performers, Sherlock mostly watches the people coming and going, occasionally whispering a deduction to John.
Sherlock takes a sip of his tea and shrugs. “Savoury. I might have ever so slightly overseasoned my pie filling.”
Sherlock gives her a grim, humourless smile. “In answer to your first point, Miss Winters, yes, we’re sixteen, but we’re also the only people who will believe you. So if you’re at all interested in seeing your friend’s killer brought to justice, I suggest you talk to us.”
He gets out the lube and condoms and makes short work of getting rid of the rest of their clothing and preparing himself and Sherlock, all the while trying not to look at Sherlock, who’s staring at him with naked hunger. Finally he can’t wait anymore. He straddles Sherlock, who’s immediately running his hands up and down John’s thighs, his chest, his face, and John holds Sherlock’s erection steady and sinks down, slowly, bracing himself against Sherlock’s chest.
John Watson again, commenting from the wings of his mind palace. He waves the intrusion away, like swatting at a fly, but then his eyes land on the Bake Off ticket, and suddenly he knows what to do.
John quite intensely for no logical reason. He craves John’s self-contained stillness, that’s true, and sometimes he wants to crack him open and crawl inside him to find that unruffled calm and smash it to bits or else absorb it entirely into himself, but if he really wanted to destroy John, he could, and he finds he has no desire to do that.
The killer grins, and it’s the most chilling, humourless smile John has ever seen. “Not bad. Looks like Jim was right about you.”
Sherlock nods his acknowledgement and picks up his box, entering the tent through one of the side entrances.
Sherlock shrugs, because he agrees with Harry on one point: He can’t quite see why John is in love with him either.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say. John has obviously showered and changed, he’s wearing a well-fitting t-shirt and a cardigan that’s an affront to the human eye, and Sherlock wants to peel it off John right this very second.
A taciturn groom picks John and the three other boys up from the Torquay train station and they drive for about half an hour through the falling dusk. Nobody talks much, they’re all tired and a bit apprehensive.
“So we're back to you risking your life to prove you're cleverer than the most recent psychopath?” John asks sharply.
Everybody cheers, and John gets clapped on the back. Irene takes over the filming and asks John, “How does it feel to have won both mini-Bake Offs?”
Janine clears her throat, and Sherlock is suddenly aware that he’s been sitting here staring at the mince pies for too long to be socially acceptable. Another thing he misses about John, his ability to let a silence sit, to leave him to his own thoughts for as long as Sherlock needs it.
“Sherlock, hello. How are you? How is the TV show going? I watched the latest episode, you’re doing well.”
John has never been to Rome, so they take an afternoon to wander through the city. They stop at a small trattoria for lunch and coffee, and Sherlock takes a moment to just breathe. John is smiling with wonder at the city, enjoying the hand-made pasta and the sharp, strong Italian espresso. They don’t talk about the mission for an entire afternoon. Sherlock tells John stories about famous local unsolved murders and John shakes his head and mutters, “Only you, I swear…” in a tone that’s unapologetically affectionate.
The air raid disrupted his sleep, and they’ve had an exhausting day slogging through the mud yesterday’s rain turned the grounds into, and he’s sitting by the fire, only half listening to Sherlock questioning Mr. Musgrave about the village, which has turned into Sherlock’s newest obsession.
“Pity,” Irene says and turns to him with a questioning gaze.  “You know, I was given to understand from Lestrade - by way of telling me to keep the flirting out of the rehearsal room - that you and John had, and I quote, ‘a pretty intense affair six years ago,’ and now you two can barely look at each other. What the hell happened?”
They’re lying on their small, not especially clean bed, facing each other but not touching because it’s too hot. It’s too hot to sleep, to think, to move.
Three days after the bombing, John’s mother puts him on a train, kisses him goodbye, and sends him off to the country. He knows she’s relieved that he’s gone, not only because he’ll be safer away from London, but also because he’s begun to notice that she’s been spending less and less time with her children and more and more time with Mr. Henry, the lodger they had to take in after his father died. His sister is long gone, she went out as a land girl the moment she had the chance. John knows that with him gone, too, his mother won’t have to pretend that the new flat won’t be one where Mr. Henry pays the rent. And it isn’t that he begrudges his mother her happiness, it’s that he feels like baggage from an old life she’d like to leave behind, with his inconvenient grief and his ever-increasing awareness of the many ways she’s let him down.
“Interesting, that one, isn’t he,” Irene muses, following Sherlock’s eyes to John. “Surprising depth, for all that he looks so entirely harmless. I wonder what he’s like in bed.”
Sherlock carefully says nothing, but he puts down his tea and steps behind John, lets his fingers sink into the tense muscles around John’s shoulder blades. John stiffens for a moment, but then he sways a bit towards Sherlock, and Sherlock slowly kneads the stiff muscles.
Sherlock supposes he should feel some way or another about this, should care about winning or even staying in the competition. He’s never been good at doing things as he should, though, and his apparent difficulty with regulating what he cares and doesn’t care about is pretty much the reason why he’s sitting alone at this bar, staring into a glass of whisky.
John looks up. Swallows hard around the lump of emotion in his throat. “I’m so angry,” he whispers. “I can’t… I can’t see her now. I don’t know what to do.”
Mr Chatterjee, Sherlock’s landlord and former owner of Speedy’s cafe, walks in. Sherlock nods at him in greeting. “Tea?”
It’s just getting light, and John wakes up to empty sheets and violin music. He feels achingly nostalgic for a moment, and then remembers where he is, and the nostalgia melts into a glowing, immediate happiness. The room reeks of sex, and John feels utterly disgusting, but he stretches happily, body thrumming with satisfaction.
Moriarty is next, glaring at Sherlock, openly hostile as usual. Sherlock ignores him and starts unpacking at his workstation.
John walks home almost in a trance. His entire body aches, and there's a persistent pain in his chest that has nothing whatsoever to do with his bruised ribs.
Sherlock slowly comes closer, and finally dares to raise his eyes to John’s face. John is watching him warily, and he looks terrible. His clothes are disarrayed, and he looks like he hasn’t shaved or showered in some time. His eyes are red-rimmed and he has dark circles under them.
Sherlock has no idea what to say to that, because he’s been on the other end of what John is describing, he’s been the addict who drove every member of his family to this exact weary exhaustion. He can’t honestly give John any comfort, because he knows how hollow any words would be. So he tightens his arms around John and cards his fingers through his hair and stays silent.
“You should join in as well, Sherlock, a little exercise wouldn’t hurt you,” Mrs Hudson says, handing Sherlock a bowl of stew, who takes it without looking, his attention still on the paper.
Sherlock briefly admires the way the scrubs hug John’s arse and accentuate his shoulders, then he focuses back on his dough.
Mike calls the five for Act 2 beginners, and Sherlock goes through the stage door and steps into the wings. Anticipation makes his skin crawl because this is his favourite moment of the night.
Sherlock sighs and answers, sounding bored, “Two months. I was the first to arrive here after Mr. Musgrave decided to open the house to evacuees. My parents are friends with Mr. Musgrave, and so they removed me from my boarding school but couldn’t let me come home to our cottage in Sussex, because my father’s with the foreign office, my brother’s at Oxford and my mother’s a mathematician who’s off somewhere doing something for the war effort nobody can talk about. So no, my parents don’t own half of Sussex, but yes, they are rich. They’ll probably look for a new boarding school for me soon, if they don’t forget, which might very well happen.  None of which is of any relevance to the pertinent point.”
John’s moved beyond pain, beyond cold. Every nerve in his body is on high alert. He’s wriggling his hands, his feet, anything to get out of these ropes, but the knots hold fast. He’s stuck. He hopes Moriarty will cut him loose from the tree at least to display him to Sherlock, and he’s moving his legs around as much as he can to keep them from falling asleep.
Sometimes, when even he is stumped, when even he is out of his depth, when there is something going on that even he can’t understand, when there’s a piece of the puzzle he
The crew ignore him as they set up, leisurely laying cables and fixing lights. There’s a small area with a few rows of seats for the audience, such as it is.
After the second run-through, the cast is done for, and so is Lestrade. John reminds them of rehearsal tomorrow at ten, and by ten he means start rehearsing at ten, not slink in at five past and then have a fag and a cuppa. He looks pointedly at Irene, and she smiles back sweetly and gives him a mock salute. “Yes, Captain.”
He throws his stone. It skips over the lake in beautiful arches, dipping in and creating little shock waves that ripple out over the still water. Eight.
