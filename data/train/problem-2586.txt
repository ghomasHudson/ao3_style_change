Cas laughs a little, which is never quite the reaction you want during sex, but Cas is real good at not really giving you what you think you want and instead forking over something you never knew could be so good, so Dean lets it slide.
“Is this—how far are we goin’ with this, Cas?” Dean asks, suspended above him on strings. Castiel looks at his dark mouth and darker eyes and can’t imagine a single human thing to say. “You gonna poof out on me if I take it a little further?”
The conversation cools rapidly when its set down for even a second; Dean runs a tongue over his teeth and looks at the chick.
Dean blinks, then laughs. “Yeah, I—wait, c’mere first.” He grabs hold of Cas’ t-shirt—why is he still wearing a t-shirt?—and hauls him down into a kiss. There’s something about it, the scratchy voice of an ex-angel swirling around Dean in his bed and asking about goddamn lube, that makes him feel like he might start billowing clouds of sulphur smoke even sans possession. He opens his mouth to Cas’, wonders if he can taste the hellfire burn.
“You deserve,” he tries again, holding Dean’s head in his hands. “You deserve more than this, more than angels; you deserve to be
“Hey there,” Dean says, once the fire—apparently contagious—burns out a little from underneath both of their skin. “I wasn’t exactly goin’ anywhere.”
“Don’t worry about it, man, I’ve still got a few more salt and burns left in me. I’m not giving up the, ha, ghost, anytime soon.”
It goes on long enough that he forgets the incendiary event, enough that he loses a bit of himself in a whine as Cas breaks it and rolls off of him slightly to reach for the bedside table. He hears the click of the cap and remembers quick enough.
“I’ve met God,” Dean says. “I’m allowed to have a fucked-up view of the world—hell, if anything, it’s everybody
“Them?” Dean eyes his getup—nothing more than a t shirt and sweatpants, not even good for the ol’ five-finger discount. “You hiding the other six somewhere?”
“I know what I said!” If Dean’s brain were a factory, it’d be on fire, no survivors, just women jumping from half-built fire escapes to splatter through safety nets too flimsy to get the job done.
“Dean.” Cas voice is on the edge of something, an entity Dean doesn’t quite know if he wants to see. “Please.”
“Is this what we’re doing now?” Dean says, turning at last and flipping a loose hand between them. His eyes are heavy. “You’re pretty big for a messenger pigeon, Cas—next time, tell ‘em they can just call me.”
“Okay. Okay. We’re all gonna die,” Dean repeats. His expression twitches, smooths, contorts again; there are things underneath his breastbone that he will not unearth perhaps ever, and certainly not for the factory reject angel now standing in front of him. Castiel watches anyway, rapt, as his eyelids close. “Okay. Then, I—hit me with your best shot, Columbo, I don’t care, can you just—”
Dean shrugs. “Well, if you can’t say it, you shouldn’t be doing it, isn’t that how it goes? And you can’t, so.”
There was no answer, but Dean hadn’t expected it to be that easy. “Cas,” he said again, experiencing the strangest sensation, like hearing an echo from another room. “Cas, it’s us, we’re gonna get you out—it’s Dean, man.”
Because it’s not a revelation, not something he’s spit out just as he’s thought of it, because Dean has never really worked like that, not about himself. It’s like a mirror, right? You avoid looking entirely or you weaponize it, and everything inside Dean is the same.
Sure, that’s a good enough topic to latch onto like a lifeboat. Why not. “Like we’ll ever get one of those.”
He tosses it up and over to Dean, and it arcs through the air nothing at all like any blade either of them have ever borne; Dean feels himself cut wide open all the same.
Dean snorts. “Well, I’m all for that,” he says. “We got seven, right? What’s something there are seven of? Dwarves?”
She doesn’t write it down, which is fine, seeing as they’re basically the only ones here on a Wednesday night. “Sauce?”
“Jack, can you please give us a moment,” Cas says, his expression shuttered, and then they’re alone.
He still thinks it would be nice. Cas has parked them on an inside road. Jones Street, Virginia. Dean sees children crossing the street on their skateboards in the afternoon sun. He entertains the fantasy, briefly: Dean, baking pastries and sipping wine, Cas, doing laundry and washing dishes. A cozy white home. It slips away in his mind’s eye. That sort of thing is dangerous. Dean knows—you can’t think about it for too long or it eats you. Pulls your hair out and leaves you dead. That sort of thing isn’t for—
“Dean,” says Cas, quiet. He can feel the weight of Cas’ gaze on him. He thinks Cas never really learned not to stare, even after all these years. “What was that for?”
Dean brings dinner to the table and spends all of it sneaking glances at Cas over his ramen. Jack asks to go on his sixth walk of the day, Eileen calls to update them on the state of her newly painted walls (courtesy of Sam), and that’s that. But Cas avoids his eyes, nearly drags Jack off to go on his walk the instant the call ends. Leaves Dean sitting at the table with a cold cup of noodles and a cutting sense of disappointment.
He wants to see that look back on Cas’s face. Dean doesn’t want to get away with it. He wants to be caught.
It’s done. Cas has to know, now, and Dean doesn’t feel better. His blood is rushing loudly through his veins. The grass outside of his window is wilting—or dying, whatever the fuck it’s called when it starts to turn yellow. “Sorry.” He doesn’t look at Cas. His voice is rough. “We can. We can go now.”
All he knows is that something inside him has melted away or crumbled or dissolved to the sound of Robert Plant’s too-quiet voice from the radio and Cas’ fucking god-awful whistling, and Dean has had it up to here.
“I found a salt-'n-burn a couple hours east from here,” Dean announces at Saturday dinner. It’s true. He did find one, but he scoured the internet for hours first, looking for anything to get him away. He’s going insane. He can’t stand the sorry glances Cas keeps throwing him, the way his chest twinges every time he catches Cas’s eye.  “I’m gonna head out tomorrow morning. Won’t take more than a day.”
-s. Why he leans a little too hard into Cas’s touch. Why he keeps asking for movie dates, car rides, why he can’t hold himself together when Cas isn’t okay. Dean’s last secret, out.
“Next!” the cashier yells again and Dean’s stepping out of line, setting down his basket of hot dogs and beer. There’s only a thin strip to walk in—the corner wall is met with an island of bouquets—and Dean has to toe past an eighty-year old at the sunflowers and then two children by the lilies to get to the yellow ones.
He slams the door to his room, sinks down hard into the bed. It wasn’t like he’d ever thought it could happen, but—god. Fuck. Cas doesn’t want him. Cas can’t stand being in the same room as him—he’s disgusted—he never thought Cas out of everyone in the world would hate him for this—
He pulls into the garage, sighs to himself. He’s not really one for speculation—can’t afford to be—but maybe there’s a version of them out there where they get this. Where it would be normal for Dean to come home from the store with flowers for his—for Cas. Scatter petals on the floor, light candles on the table, clink rings when they hold hands. All of
It’s two, so Cas should be in the kitchen assembling Jack a sandwich. But he’s not—he’s at the library’s table with a book, wearing his standard dress pants and one of Dean’s old pajama shirts like some kind of douchebag. He startles at the sound of the door, smiles when he sees Dean. “There you are,” he says. “Let me help you with those bags.”
Cas reaches for his shoulder but drops his hand, rerouting towards his wrist. He holds it loosely, so Dean can break away without any effort at all. His voice is uneven. “I don’t always … understand you. Humans. In this sort of thing. I have to know what you want from me. You have to spell it out for me.”
That was for a lot of things. That was for coming when Dean calls, that was for being the best friend Dean has ever had. It was for staying, finally, after everything. For choosing Dean. For coming back to him.
“Dean!” Cas whirls around. He’s holding a towel in one hand and a spatula in the other. Dean doesn’t even try to resist: walks right up to Cas and tucks his free hand into his waist. Cas lets him, easy as pie, and Dean’s almost smiling too hard to properly kiss him. He pulls Cas’s body into his own, sighs into his mouth as Cas wraps his spatula-hand around Dean’s neck. Dean lingers like that for a minute, eyes closed, listening to the sound of pasta water boiling. The feel of Cas’s breath on his cheek.
Dean thinks he would drive halfway across the world to see Cas if he wasn’t with him right this moment. There’s an urgency picking at his skin. It’s not sexual, and it’s not anxious, just an insistent push. A steadfast sort of do-or-die. Cas has been the goddamn love of Dean’s life since somewhere between
“Next on three!” shouts the cashier and Dean is just about to move, having crossed off every item on the list Sam’s texted him (and by "crossed off", he means “ignored”, because Dean will be damned before he becomes an accessory to Sam’s grass-eating agenda) when he glances up from his phone and stops.
Whatever they were in the middle of. Dean knows how to handle sex. This is something different. This is new, this is intimacy: Cas is holding him. Like a lover. Still, Dean can’t stop himself from melting into it, pressing his face into Cas’ neck and inhaling. It feels too good. He’s surrounded by Cas. His clothes, his smell, his muscles. Even with no mojo, he’s stronger than Dean and Sam put together. Almost human. It figures: Cas has never done a single thing normally in his life. Can’t even become a proper, weak human. He does it his way, the stubborn bastard.
“I apologize for my earlier...actions,” Castiel says solemnly. “I was not thinking clearly and if you want me to apologize Anna I will—”
Castiel resumes the song on his phone and continues his way to school. He parks his bike along with the bike rack and locks it before straightening his backpack and finally walks into the building along with hundreds of other students. His junior year had started a month ago and he couldn’t wait for it to end. Since high school had started, he no longer was as interested in his studies as he once was since every class was just a repetition of its predecessor. He had grown a new habit over his sophomore year to research topics and issues he was interested in and instead quizzed himself on those. He was still a straight-A student but was no longer into school the way he once was.
Castiel furrows his eyebrows in confusion, for once not understanding what someone else was saying when his eyes caught onto the green envelope Dean was holding in his hand. The green envelope. The green envelope that was supposed to be locked away in his box underneath his floorboard.
Without another thought or a moment for Dean to collect his thoughts and yell at him, Castiel shoved his lock into his backpack and practically jumped onto his bike, awkwardly peddling away from the scene of his embarrassment. He doesn’t stop until he’s out of the school’s parking lot and before he knows it, at the entrance of The Roadhouse. Besides the library, The Roadhouse kind of served as a second home to Castiel with its warm atmosphere and welcoming staff. He wasn’t the most close with the owner, Ellen Harvelle, but regarded her closely as something next to a friend.
“My God,” Balthazar groans. “I didn’t pay money to retake my driver’s test just for you to continue riding that ridiculous little bike of yours.”
Castiel refrains from rolling his eyes as Dean sneaks up behind Anna and wraps his arms around her waist. “Hey, babe.”
Sure enough, a crowd accumulates around Dean as multiple students ask for photos and for him to sign their folders or homework assignments with sharpies and mechanical pencils. Dean chuckles at the students' enthusiastic response to his presence that he forgets the reason why he was there in the first place until he felt eyes drill into the back of his head. Dean straightens his posture and turns around, making eye contact with Castiel over the crowd of students. He strides over to his husband with a bright smile before planting a little kiss on his cheek, causing their audience to gasp and some students begin to scream.
They were married in the summer of next year by Dean’s father figure, Bobby Singer. Uriel and Anna were both invited but only Anna came. Sam attended as the best man with his wife, Jessica, and their one-year-old daughter Mary. Cas had asked Charlie to be his maid of honor since the two had bonded immensely after their first initial meeting. The two’s dynamic was convenient since Charlie would talk to whoever approached them and since she was with a guy, she wouldn’t be harassed and sometimes he’d be her wingman when hooking up with other chicks.
Castiel’s eyes grow wide when he sees Balthazar on the opposite side of the school, brown eyes searching hastily around the crowd with a similar blue envelope clutched tightly in his hand. Balthazar’s eyes almost meet Castiel’s when he subconsciously reaches out for Dean’s plaid t-shirt and pulls him close by the collar until their lips met.
Before they could ask any questions, Castiel confiscates the phone and walks back to his desk with a smug smile. If only Dean could see him now. The two had decided on keeping Cas’s identity a secret because Dean was the one in the relationship who wanted attention and Cas was content in staying in the background. Dean had also progressively become even more famous throughout the years and Cas knew the fame was not for him. It also made it harder to go on dates without someone recognizing Dean. There were a few times when they were grocery shopping where a fan spotted them and Cas introduced himself as Dean’s cousin. The two had spoken about whether or not to introduce Castiel to Dean’s channel except Cas was afraid if any of his students saw and began viewing him differently. That is if any of his students even
The two would introduce each other to their interests and new things like movies and/or music. One time Dean brought over his friend, Charlie Bradbury, and Castiel thought the two were dating. He was immediately confused because although the two hadn’t explicitly come out to each other, they knew in the short yet meaningful duration of their relationship. His worries were for nothing, though, when Charlie noticed the tension and just casually mentioned she was a lesbian.
Castiel stops walking, recognizing the voice without having to see her face. He sighs to himself and reluctantly turns around to see a familiar redhead smirking at him. He’s avoided confrontation since the beginning of the new semester and ignored all her comments because that’s what she would do; taunt him for a period of time before leaving him. Except for this year she was extra persistent. “What do you want, Anna?”
“Yes, Dean. Keep up. Anyways, I saw that Balthazar had his letter and I didn’t want to...confront him so I jumped you. And I’m sorry.”
“You didn’t know students watched your husband’s videos?” Jo shoves her face into her sandwich to keep from laughing. “You do know...that kids have worn his merchandise to school before, right?”
Castiel’s first and second kiss wasn’t much different than his first. It was somewhat expected since they were with the same person but only years apart and he was still as inexperienced as he was the first time. Although the interaction could barely be classified as a proper “kiss” in the first place, Castiel still felt the same bubbly feeling in his chest as he pulled away and blinked at the close proximity between their faces. And that was when realization dawned on him for what he had done.
School ended that day painfully and Castiel was more than happy to come home to hear the shower running, guessing Dean just got back from the gym. He set his bag down and took his coat off before face-planting onto his bed. He stayed in the position for a few minutes before turning his body around as he heard the bathroom door open.
While subbing for a variety of teachers, he worked for his master’s degree in American history and was offered a permanent teacher’s position when one of them retired. On the side of subbing for teachers, Castiel worked at a coffee shop in a neighboring city. Although he was still shy and reserved, he managed to make a friend named Meg who was a regular at the coffee shop. At that time he met a downcast Dean Winchester who had just lost his father. He would usually meet up with his brother, Sam, at Cas’s coffee shop since Sam attended the nearby university. Sometimes Dean would stay behind when his brother left and that’s when Castiel introduced himself and the two bonded over their love-hate relationships with their parental figures. Dean always expressed how he felt like he was a failure for never going to college when Castiel encourages him to go for a job or start something he wants to do. Dean had a side hobby of making videos as a kid because his family would move around a lot so he liked to film entertaining short videos of him and Sam to stay in touch with old friends. The friendships never lasted and the hobby was discarded until he decided to take Castiel’s advice and began filming little videos and posting them on youtube under the name ‘Wayward Winchester.’
Dean thinks of roses and tulips and carnations. He thinks of Cas in the driver’s seat of his car, right where he is now. He leans in again, and when they do pull back onto the road and set off from this small town, Dean doesn’t look back.
It’s just his luck that there’s no trash can outside. And that there’s no more space in Baby’s backseat, and that he’s not enough of a caveman to put the flowers on the floor. So they’re stuck in the passenger seat next to him, horrifyingly bright and garish and mocking against the black leather.
He wasn’t expecting anything out of this, but God, it still smarts. He knows that Cas doesn’t do—love in that way. Dean knows Cas doesn’t want him. And he made his peace with that long ago. But this still feels like heartbreak, feels like getting turned down to a middle school date except only a hundred times worse. What would trillion-year-old Castiel, former Angel of the Lord, want with Dean, anyway?
Cas is getting pinker and pinker. Dean’s already red as a tomato. He can’t look away. “I thought I needed to give you space,” Cas says, soft. “Time. For her.”
He doesn’t think. Cas is driving the Impala, eyes on the road (he’s whistling, actually, Sam has been teaching him how to) and Dean doesn’t know why it’s this Sunday as opposed to any other Sunday this month. As opposed to never.
This little grocery store has a flower section. It’s a small sort of nook, tucked—crammed, more like—into a corner behind the check-outs, and it’s charming in the way that everything in this small town is charming. It’s loud and colorful and intense. Dean’s got no real reason to bother. He’s never really been a flowers kind of guy. He doesn’t send them and he sure as hell doesn’t get them, but.
There’s only one explanation that makes sense. Cas has been acting weird since Dean came  home with the groceries. Dean scrubs at his eyes hard enough that black spots appear against the hallway walls.
“You’ve got to know, Cas.” Dean takes the coward’s way out, muffles the words into Cas’ neck. “You’re it for me.”
“You weren’t even going to tell me,” he says, deflating, “I know, okay? You took the flowers to her, I saw you—”
in permanent marker on his forehead. He can’t give these to Cas. He wants to, fuck, does he want to. But they’ve got a good thing going after who knows how long and this isn’t something Dean can have. It’s not something Dean needs. He’ll get rid of the flowers.
He can’t give them to Kathy—it’s not right. These are Cas’s, whether he knows it or not. And he thinks they look nice in front of Cas when they sit down together. Or that Cas looks nice next to them. Same thing. The yellow makes his eyes stand out.
Cas is most definitely going to know. Cas isn’t a trench-coated baby anymore. He watches TV constantly now. Romance, soaps. Reality, too. He’s going to take one look at them and figure Dean out.
“Dean,” Castiel growls. He’s gripping Dean’s wrist, blunt nails digging into his skin. It’s not even a fraction of his strength but it’s grounding. He looks—ferocious. Like his eyes would be glowing if he had any grace left. “Dean Winchester. I am
Dean brings his non-injured hand up to cup Cas’ face, slowly. Runs his thumb over the ever-present stubble. Cas leans into it, unblinking, and Dean leans forward. He closes his eyes, presses their lips together, softly. Almost reverently. Cas’ are chapped, a little rough, just like they look. Dean pulls away, drops his hand.
“I, uh. I was standing there and I wasn’t planning on it. I don’t even know what happened. It was like I was blackout drunk or something but I saw those flowers and the next thing I know I’m sitting in Baby coming home with a bouquet in my hands. And then I, I was gonna give them to you but I didn’t, and you were avoiding me and I had to throw them out and now—”
Even if Castiel dearly loved his job, he wanted nothing more than to go home to his husband, curl up on the couch and have a western movie marathon. Summer break was finally coming up and Cas was more than ready to take a break from grading tests and papers. He had a love-hate relationship with the end of the term because, on one hand, he had a lot of stressed-out students, high piles of ungraded homework, and barely any sleep. But on the other hand, he had the next three months just for him and Dean. Their 10th year anniversary was also coming up and he was fretting about what he should get his husband.
“Ugh, you know how she is,” Jo groans into her sandwich. “She’ll shoot down everything and suggest I go in a turtleneck or something.”
The third letter was addressed to the ever-popular playboy, Dean Winchester. His family had moved away from Kansas when Castiel was too young to remember but they moved back during Dean’s middle school years. Castiel hadn’t thought much about the Winchester until they were paired for a group project and Dean revealed his love for old western movies.  He had been teased for his minor obsession but Castiel thought it was endearing and told Dean to never change. Later that semester, Castiel attended Anna’s 12th birthday party and they all wanted to play spin-the-bottle. The bottle landed between Castiel and Dean, naturally, but Castiel didn’t want to kiss him because he knew Anna had a huge crush on him. That didn’t stop Dean, however, who claimed it was “just a game” and Castiel had his first kiss that night. Anna did not think it was “just a game” so the two got into a huge fight and hadn’t been friends since. Castiel decided to forget about Dean Winchester after that, even when he and Anna started dating in high school. The fourth letter was addressed to K-pop sensation, Kwon Jiyong, also known as G-Dragon, from the Korean boy band Bigbang. Castiel loved how expressive Jiyong was and the trends he set. The fifth and final letter was addressed to Gabriel Speight Jr. from Mock Trial. The two had met in competition once and tied for an award. The two split the title and became fast friends. Due to a distanced friendship, they didn’t talk as often as they did in middle school and drifted apart.
“I don’t have to do anything,” Castiel replies quickly. “I only have two more years of this and then I’ll be free. It’s one year for you.”
“And, I think we should leave her alone until she solves her own problems. Besides, she’s not worse than Uriel.”
Castiel feels Balthazar’s arm tighten around his shoulder as he readjusts his backpack across his back and turns his back to Anna, pulling Balthazar with him before heading in the opposite direction.
“There you go underestimating me again,” Dean clicks his tongue. “I have a lesbian friend and it was her mission to educate me when we first met.”
to their music instead of judging them based on make-up and appearances. Most men hate it because they think it’s a threat to their overly fragile masculine image.”
Castiel releases a deep breath as he sits back down and takes a long sip from his milkshake. “Well, apparently someone released all my letters.”
him anything and he’s my only friend. I never told him because I knew it would ruin my friendship with him.”
“So he speaks!” Anna gasps dramatically. “And after all this time and I thought you just became deaf.”
Castiel’s father was definitely the conservative type and the only time he was home was to praise Uriel on winning a game, shaming “loose” women, and reprimanding Castiel on his apparently useless hobby. Although he never had positive exposure in his childhood, Castiel always felt different from other kids. Maybe it started when people kept saying Castiel was so lucky to be close to a babe like Anna but he didn’t in the way they were implying, or when he kept rewatching the Harry Potter franchise to see Domhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasley. Maybe he knew when he was in elementary school and was obsessed with collecting One Direction CDs or even before that. All that mattered was that he was different and that was bad.
Luckily, Anna doesn’t bother him the following days and Castiel is left alone in his thoughts. He still forgot to wait for Balthazar in the mornings and rode his bike to school. He’s so far lost in his mind he doesn’t see where he’s going and crashes into someone, knocking them off their feet.
When the bell rang, Castiel promptly returned the student’s phone before joining Jo in the teacher’s lounge for lunch. After the video where Dean came out, Castiel felt it was time to tell Jo that he was Dean’s husband. Jo was extremely embarrassed and kept apologizing for talking about Dean that way but then was offended she wasn’t told sooner. She forgave him pretty quickly when Cas let her talk to him on the phone one day after school and gave her a signed t-shirt.
“You won’t believe what some students were watching in class today,” Castiel began as he sat down at their designated table.
“Is that your ride out there?” Dean asks as he points to Cas’s seventh-grade bike and for once he felt embarrassed by it.
It was another regular morning when Castiel woke up. He had another regular breakfast in his bedroom to avoid his brother, Uriel, who then drove off to their regular school first. Castiel left a few minutes later on his bicycle to make sure they wouldn’t collide on the way. His family only owned two cars; one that their always absent dad used and the second Uriel claimed since he was older. Even if he didn’t have his license he would’ve made up an excuse for Castiel to not have it. Castiel hummed along with the pop song on his phone as he biked along the sidewalk when he heard honking behind him. Castiel slowed down and looked over his shoulder to see Balthazar in his jeep who was pushing his car horn.
Castiel was snapped out of his thoughts as he heard faint giggling from the back of the classroom. He glances at the clock from the corner of his eye to see that there were still fifteen minutes left of class and students weren’t allowed on their phones until the last five minutes. Sighing, he stands up and walks to the back of the classroom where he sees a small group of girls huddled around a single phone. He walks behind them without any of them noticing, raising an eyebrow when he sees what they’re watching. Most of the time it’s that god-awful show called
Castiel was the standard blueprint of the shy artistic kid who always sat in the back of the class. He always followed the rules and kept his head down to avoid drama and confrontation. He was a bit of a teacher’s pet since he sometimes sucked up to them and was genuinely interested in his studies which were seen as taboo to other students. He was seen as a polar opposite to his older brother, Uriel, who was the school’s star quarterback and dated one of the most popular cheerleaders named Hester. Uriel might have been the adopted one in the family but he was never treated like it. Castiel was often picked on and teased by his brother and his cronies but the teachers never reported or did anything because they were some of the best athletes on their sports teams. Despite being so anti-social, a fairly large group of students liked Castiel because he was helpful and answered questions for them in class when they didn’t know the answers. Even if a lot of people liked him, he only had two people in his life he really could’ve called a true friend, and they were Anna Milton and Balthazar Roche.
Castiel was the one who filmed that video and it trended pretty quickly since only a small handful of popular YouTubers were in the LGBTQ+ community. The video did garner some hate but the reception, for the most part, was very positive. This finally led to Castiel revealing to his students that he had a husband whom he had been married to for eight years. He was only met with positive responses and felt like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. A year later, Castiel started an elective class that taught about historical LGBTQ+ figures, monuments, timelines, and etc. It also doubled as a “therapy group” as the students liked to call it since it was a safe space.
Castiel feels faint as he stumbles on his feet, finally realizing what the premonition he was feeling since that morning. Someone had seen his box of his most inner thoughts and feelings and even sent out one of the letters. What if they sent all the letters?
The two sit in silence for the rest of the ride until Dean finally pulls up at Castiel’s front yard. Cas looks around his house and Balthazar’s to see if he was home yet before unbuckling himself and opening the door.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean’s cloud with worry as he grips Castiel’s shoulder to hold him steady. “You all right, man? You need something?”
Castiel struggled a bit with locking his bike on their broken bike rack before entering the quaint shop and sitting down on a counter stool and dropping his heavy backpack onto the seat near him. He holds his head in his hands as faces down, unable to look at anyone in the eye.
“Oh, right,” Castiel says as he remembers when Balthazar finally passed his driver’s test and told him he was going to drive them to school from then on. “It’s all right, this is my only form of exercise anyway.”
“Hey, Dean,” Anna replies as she wraps her arms around his. “I was just complimenting Castiel on his dirty trench coat he’s had ever since he was still in diapers. Speaking of diapers, where’s that boyfriend of yours?”
“So you need to throw Balthazar off your trail because you don’t want to ruin your friendship and I want Anna back from the college guys...so what’d you say—”
video. He was a bit taken aback as he recognized the video being on Dean uploaded last week about this game he played with Sam and Jessica called “Never Have I Ever.” The part they were on was “never have I ever gotten a speeding ticket.” Castiel snorts to himself when Dean puts up the sign “I have.” On one of their dates, they were almost late to a musical Castiel had been waiting months to see so Dean was speeding and they were pulled over.
After his first three cups of coffee and an hour of sitting and staring at the wall, Dean looks into the bag to see it still empty and decides to make a sandwich and pack some of the stuff he’s seen Cas put in it before checking the time. Cas’s second period would start in fifteen minutes so he had some time to give him his lunch. Dean shrugs on a jacket and starts the impala, careful to make sure the water bottle is secured tightly in Cas’s bag. When he makes it to the school parking lot, he puts on a cap and sunglasses to hide his face before grabbing Castiel’s lunch bag and heading to the front office. He signs in at the front office and walks through the hallways, thinking back to the time when he was in high school which felt like eons ago. He had no idea why Castiel wanted to make a career out of teaching high school students—they were usually the moodiest bunch of kids but Castiel loved them.
He brushed and wiped down Impala as she drank heartily from a water trough, the lone lantern that hung in the barn casting distorted shadows against the walls. He gave her what little feed he had left, promising her a feast at the next town they came across. Her dark eyes only stared calmly back at him as she finished her meal. Dean drew a pail of water for himself before climbing up to the loft. Sitting on an old milking stool, the hunter rinsed off his face, his neck and his hands before taking a long drink. For a long while, Dean just stared at his rippling reflection in the water, his face contorting with the water as it settled. He blinked, and he could have sworn that his eyes flashed black in the water. The thought made him look away, and he cursed under his breath about not getting enough sleep.
The sun was barely visible on the horizon when Dean broke through the forest. Dark clouds lurked overhead, breaking up the soft pink and orange hues that spread across the sky. A few villagers were mulling around, and they looked up at him as he approached. Dean raised his chin a bit in response, willing his spine to straighten. Their sunken faces were cold, but Dean watched as their eyes shifted from questioning to quiet melancholy as they fixed on Impala’s back. Dean did not let his stride falter. As he walked between the twin rows of shabby cabins, his own green eyes lingered on the glow of hearths and lanterns light in the windows he passed by. His bones ached in response to the thought of the warmth, but he brushed off. He had a job to finish first.
Two small forms strapped over Impala’s back shifted with each step she took. The canvas wrapping them had become scuffed by dew and loose pine needles, but Dean’s knots held their place. One of the folds on the larger of the two forms had shifted during the ride, revealing a mop of dirty hair. Dean watched the strands sway with Impala’s movements, a stray gleam of sunlight catching flecks of red on the dark locks. He grimaced slightly, before turning back to the road ahead. Rest would have to wait a little while longer.
The woman looked up at Dean with large brown eyes. Her hair fell flatly around her bony face, brows drawn together in tentative but hopeful expectance. The expression, stressing the creases of her face, made her look older than she truly was. Dean's eyes glanced over her shoulder, to the man standing by the crumbling fireplace. Her husband, judging by the matching wedding band on his finger, looked back at him with a solemn face, as if he were preparing for Dean to march over to him and strike him. Dean suddenly found his mouth to be too dry.
Dean would’ve jumped at this a week ago. Would’ve done something moronic, like offered to let Cas drive Baby.  “It’s a one-man job, Cas. I’m fine.”
Well. He’d probably cover every square inch of this place in flowers if that’s what Cas really wanted.
And now he’s blaming Cas for, for responding reasonably. If their places were reversed and Cas treated Dean like shit and locked him out, over and over, and then dumped his enormous, ugly feelings on him right when he got a moment of peace—
Dimly, it occurs to Dean that is what he wanted. This is Cas catching him. This is the chase. He just needs to run a little bit slower.
with a popped ‘p’ to which Cas says nothing—and mumbles an excuse about sorting his laundry before fleeing, oatmeal in hand. He walks out of the rooms Dean walks into, engages Jack in desperate conversation when he can’t.
“I never—oh. Oh,” Dean says. Cas doesn’t know. It’s like a slap to the face. Cas never knew. This whole time, Cas thought—has been thinking—Dean’s with someone else. Dean came home with the brightest yellow flowers he’s ever seen in his life for some—woman. Some stranger. Dean wants to laugh.
He dreams in yellow that night: Cas bursting out of a chrysanthemum like a birthday cake except that he’s not naked. He’s holding a bouquet of his own in gloved hands—roses—and he shows them to Dean before vanishing each flower behind a hanky. Dean watches his fingers a little too closely, trying to catch the moment the rose disappears, but when he looks up after the last flower—
This time, Dean isn’t slow about it. He nearly lunges for Cas, as if he'll fade away if Dean doesn’t reach him fast enough. He clenches his good arm in Cas’ trench, hands shaking, and crashes their mouths together.
Cas flails for a second, grabs the nearest object to him. “I’m sorry.” He holds up his ticking and on-time alarm clock, looking guilty. “My alarm clock is broken and I really need to fix it.”
It’s his own goddamn fault. He just couldn’t keep shut, gave himself away on a fucking impulse, on fucking fifteen-dollar flowers. He kept it together through Lucifer wearing Cas like a leotard, through Cas dying and dying again, through Chuck and Amara. And then he folded, without a single excuse. He wanted to be caught, and Cas caught him red-handed. Tied him to a fucking pole and called the cops.
Cas isn’t a girl. And it’s not like Dean is trying to romance him, or anything. It’s just that he looks at these, and he thinks that Cas might like them, and he thought of Cas when he saw them, and it’s not a big deal. Sam would give him so much shit if he came home with flowers, but Sam’s not at the Bunker. Sam’s at Eileen’s for the week (which is why Dean is allowed to do the grocery in the first place), and so it’s just Cas and Dean and Jack and Dean can always just leave them on the table. Say he got them for Jack. Or Eileen. Or as decoration for the Bunker.
“They’re beautiful, Dean. Thank you,” says Cas with all the sincerity of someone reporting an automobile accident. He takes them from Dean, sets them down on the table next to Wednesday's flowers. The bunker is starting to look like Martha Stewart threw up on all of their flat surfaces, and it’s Dean’s fault.
“I have to know,” Cas says, except this time it’s even deeper than his usual rumble. “Please, Dean. Why did you do that?”
Dean fidgets in place as the cashier wraps the flowers in white. He grabs them too hard as she hands them over. The paper crumples loudly between them.
“Alright, well, let me know when you need my tools,” Dean says curtly. He turns to leave. Not like Cas would know a screwdriver from a wrench in the first place.
Men who’ve come back from the dead one too many times. Isn’t for fallen angels. Dean has tried it before. Didn’t really stick.
a corner of his mind echoes. Dean is the very picture of repression. Daddy issues, addictive personality. Alcoholic, shitty friend, the entire worthless package.
“Yeah, there was a sale at the store,” he lies, shouldering past Cas. That’s good. That makes sense. He sets the bags down on the table, rolls out his shoulders. “They were only eight dollars, so.”
“—and why don’t you set up a baby monitor in my room, too? Then you’d always know I’m safe and sound, and I can ping you if I need a chaperone to go and piss—”
“Wanna watch a movie, dude?” Dean tries to ask after dinner. He’s resorted to sneaking up on Cas in his room, blocking his only exit. Cas is seated on the bed, staring blankly at a wall.
“Yeah,” Dean says, rubbing the back of his neck. He doesn’t have time to get any further than that before Cas yanks him back in, and that’s just fine. Dean’s doing just fine.
And it’s not like Cas has a frame of reference for this kind of shit, anyway. He could buy Cas the red roses and get him a heart-shaped box of chocolates, too, and the guy would probably try planting them outside. So he reaches for the bouquet—it’s heavier than he had expected, maybe 15 stems total, and he gets back in line.
They fall into a routine. Cas gets breakfast first, takes it back to his room. Dean leaves for the kitchen ten minutes after he hears Cas shut his door. They eat lunch separately or skip it all together, and at dinner they pretend everything is normal for the kid.
“Are those zinnias?” Cas asks, stopping Dean at the bottom of the stairs. He beams at Dean—that’s exactly what he wanted to see, this look on Cas’s face, this is what he was thinking of, why he stood there in that store making a damn fool out of himself—
“I’ve got you,” Cas tells him, and then he’s wrapping Dean in an embrace, strong arms going around his shoulders. Dean doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Only Cas would give him a hug—a honest-to-god, family-friendly
He hums the ending to the song that got cut off in Baby, shoves open the door to the library with his hip, and freezes.
Dean flutters down the stairs, swinging Baby’s keys on the fingers of his free hand. “Hey, Sammy, it ain’t my fault the romance gene skipped you. I bet Eileen would appreciate some flowers once in a while—you ever ask what she thinks?”
Dean pictures the houses outside his window crumbling. The stupid picturesque family inside drowning in their laundry detergent.
He’s still stoic, but Cas deflates slightly. His eyes soften at the creases and he lets go of Dean’s wrist. “You,” he agrees. “I love you.” He sounds so earnest that Dean’s heart breaks all over again.
Cas pulls back and looks him in the eye. Dean doesn’t know if Cas knows what he means, but Cas must understand the gravity behind his statement because he laces their hands together and kisses Dean’s temple, gently. “Okay,” he says.
“That,” sings Dean, swatting Sam’s head as he passes by, “ain’t your problem. Now. Scram. Get lost. Big plans today.”
‘no’ for me?” Dean spits. He doesn’t want to take it out on Cas, but he’s just so angry, suddenly. At the universe, at himself. “I know where I stand with you. I don’t know why I kissed you. We don’t have to talk about it.”
“Your girlfriend,” Cas hisses. “Does your girlfriend know that you hunt? This changes things, Dean, you have to recognize that! You’re forty years old, you have responsibilities to people other than yourself, hunts can go wrong, you’re gonna need someone to watch your back, and especially for
Normally they end up watching one whether they intend to or not. Dean lazes around in the Dean Cave until Cas shows up, and then whatever’s on is the movie of the night. Sometimes, though, they fall asleep through the show marathons. Dean wakes up with a crick in his neck and Cas’s drool on his shoulder. It’s so worth it.
Cas is going to laugh at him. Cas wouldn’t laugh at him. Cas is going to give him that stare, the one with the squinty eyes and the scrunched down eyebrows. Cas is going to ask him why. Twelve years of mostly-friendship and Dean has never gotten him flowers, because friends don’t get friends flowers. Men don’t get men flowers.
But Dean doesn’t have it in him anymore. Cas knows what that was for. He doesn’t think he’s kissed anyone the same way he kissed Cas. Not Lisa, not Cassie. Not anyone before that.
“So,” Dean says, after another few endless moments. “What’d you think? Better or worse than that whorehouse?” His voice is very gentle around the crudeness of his words.
Cas picks one up, mirroring Dean, and considers it. “It always did seem like an interesting organ to choose.”
Cas replaces the hand around his dick with the now spit-slicked one and—oh, it’s better. Not that the original one was bad, because Dean’s got this weird thing that no matter where, how, when Cas touches him, his body somehow translates it into the greatest fucking feeling imaginable, but this? This is pretty great.
anything you could possibly compare it to, I—” Cas shakes his head, reassaults Dean’s half-open mouth. It’s alright. Of course it is. Dean’s got a hand or two in trying not to express that which shouldn’t be said. Which can’t be. He drops the subject and shrugs his way back into the same kind of kiss he never really thought was real; it’s the kind an action hero gives his batting-eyed heroine, the one whose chest’s been heaving to and fro for the past hour and forty-five minutes, the gal who looks like she’d sell the whole operation for a good fifteen minutes in a dark room with Johnny Action.
Dean shrugs, clears his throat. “Gotta have a two by four supplier if I’m gonna build a coop, c’mon, Sammy, use your head.”
—wait, hey, don’t do that,” he says as Cas pulls out of his reach completely, but Cas just gives him a dry look as he shucks his sweater, pressing back in wearing just his heather gray t-shirt. “Oh. No, right, yeah, uh—onward Christian soldier, then.”
“Cas.” It’s a thousand things crammed into the space of one word, an angel trying to pour itself into some poor human bastard. It’s
Castiel hums, something he hadn’t quite been aware he was capable of until this moment. “I’m not entirely sure what it is I’m learning.”
Cas had pulled Jack close, hand cradling his head like the dear thing it was, and Dean, no longer afraid his touch might set off some celestial atom bomb, had joined the embrace. He’d hung his head, laying it down to rest on those who could hold him up and he could be trusted to hold in return.
Three syllables—the tune of an old Beatles song, maybe, the creak of an old floor, read in code because to speak outright is to poison the air. He wants it, but more than anything he wants to hear it from the original source, to watch Cas’ face as he forms the words. To choke on the smog.
Dean stays on, the black screen of his phone warm against his face. He doesn’t really have much left to say, but Cas might. Or he might not. Either way, it’s not like he has anything better to do than stand here, socked feet on kitchen tile and ear on the line.
“Yeah, dude,” Dean says, squinting at him. He’d gone to lengths to keep it under wraps, sure, but his brother’s solved whole cases on less obvious hints than Cas’ very-obviously-not-bedhead bedhead that’d started showing up about three out of every seven days of the week. “You, uh, you honestly had no idea?”
There’s an argument, somewhere, that they’re not resolving, but if this is what fighting with Cas looks like, blurry and ecstatic in the warm light, then oh, sign him up for debate team. He’s so full of longing that the angry flat of Cas’ palm against his face would be enough to live on.
“Yeah, man,” Dean says, sweeping his eyes down and away to his own socked feet. “Standing over me like that, some sort of—I don’t know, you want me to play Sleeping Beauty here or something?” He glances back up switchblade-quick, sees Castiel’s furrowed brow, sighs. “It’s a—never mind. Kiss the girl, save the day sort of thing. Easier shit than anything we’ve ever done.”
“Warn a guy,” Dean says at last. His voice has gone through some chemical change, and Castiel wonders if he will ever hear it the same way again.
for a road trip with his sort-of-sister, and the world is a hell of a lot better for it—and you can trust me, I’ve met more would-be Gods than I ever fucking wanted to.”
shit he once said in their dark and hollow basement, the thing about—Dean bites down on the thought, scans Cas’ face instead for something to latch onto and only finds its lack.
He licks his lips—rookie move, because all it does it get Cas’ gaze darting down to his mouth, eyes dark as shit, which is all the invitation Dean’s ever gonna need, and—
Soldier as he is, Castiel knows a dismissal when he hears one—perhaps even too well, used to taking flight before words have cooled in the air—and stands, clean and fully clothed.
It’s not exactly easy to avoid, to give the guy who looked you in the eye and saw your slack-jawed reaction the old dodge and slip, so Dean just mostly ignores it. Or, well, tries.
. He knew Dean, from muscle to sinew to bone, because he’d spent time constructing, repolishing him like some well-loved piece of leather furniture. Loved despite its age and bruises, perhaps because of them. Cas, in his most secret, quashed daydreams, had sweated and toiled and sang out in triumph when one singular Dean Winchester had been put back in working order. And, maybe, he’d never forgotten the steps. Maybe, fingers on his forehead were only ever a safety measure, maybe he always knew the whole Dean, the inside and out, and maybe he stuck around anyway.
Sometimes, Dean wonders at the work it must have taken to stitch him up again that first time in Hell, dress him like he was a real boy instead of the string puppet he now knows himself to be. He thinks, maybe not all that long. Maybe it only took a second, like Cas’ ministrations of the battlefield, two fingers pressed to his lonesome forehead and then gone again. Healed without a thought.
“They really don’t make ‘em like they used to,” Dean says, scratching onto his list. “Hey, Cas, you saved some of that ground beef like I asked you to, right? I was gonna show Claire how to grill a real burger if she makes it down this weekend, how’s it sound?”
“Am I allowed to ask about the other part of it?” Sam says, and Dean groans. “C’mon, man, he’s my friend too.”
Castiel follows the movement of his hand in all its nonchalance and almost wishes it was moving against him instead.
“Okay, okay,” Dean says after a minute, century, however long it takes for Cas to get three fingers deep and start leaving what feel like continent-sized marks along his collarbone. “I’m ready, you’re good, I—c’mon, give it to me.”
Cas hits him with a dry look, absolutely parched. “I’d forgotten the age-old question,” he says. “Which came first, the angel or the Chevrolet automobile company.”
Dean’s heart jumps to the back of his throat. It’s stupid, to plan for things as unpromised as next year, but—oh, but. Some unnamed muscle unclenches at the sound of it.
An interesting position he’s in to be insisting, kneeling between Cas’ legs on the cold concrete ground. But then, isn’t it as good a place as any to start demanding things?
“Eggs,” the no longer timeless being standing in front of their open fridge says. “And honey.” Cas points at him, and it takes a moment for Dean to correctly read it as an instruction and not an endearment, but with Cas it might always be a little bit of both. “Do
“Dean,” Cas says, and he sounds—God, Dean doesn’t even want to think about how he sounds, he just wants to make sure he never sounds like, always sounds like that again. “I know you don’t—I—oh,
And if Dean takes an additional moment in the doorway before sliding under the sheets beside him, that’s his business.
“Very impressive,” Cas says from behind him, “for someone who hasn’t seen you bruise a dozen perfectly good peaches the same way.”
“I will,” Cas says, deep, leaning in to mouth the promise into the skin of Dean’s neck. “I will. I will.”
“Like—a week after he came back from the Empty? The second time. Although,” Dean starts, then cuts himself off with a shake of his head—no need for the whole messy history right now, not that he’d exactly trust his tongue to form it. “Never mind.”
Cas, too, had returned from the Empty changed, new. Not much of an angel anymore, perhaps something better, something at home and at peace scoping out their well-stocked kitchen cupboards.
Maybe Cas isn’t the only one who should shut up—what’s Dean even trying to say? The divide between what he knows and doesn’t is seismic—he wants, sure, but hell if he’s gonna pinpoint what; he’s empty, and so, so helpless as to what could possibly fill him up. The only point in which he trusts is the constancy of Cas’ movements, the shudder speed of him.
Dean understands what he means, though. This, a stupid nothing conversation in front of their toaster, this is something that never would have made it into any iteration of Chuck’s story. Too boring, too mundane, too goddamn normal. It’s just a conversation; Dean’s not biting back the truth of some weird murderous desire, Sam’s not ducking away to work with anything more sinister than a tough ass Irishwoman. They’re not standing in the kitchen to set some sort of scene, they’re just—standing, in the kitchen.
He redoubles his efforts, tonguing at the head like he knows every dude from here to the Atlantic Ocean he’s never seen likes, leans into the wide-open palm of Cas’ hand in his hair. He wants, he denies himself, etc, etc, until it’s not really under his control anymore, until it’s Cas pulling the strings, pulling his hair in exactly the way that makes Dean tilt his head back and groan.
“There, now you’ve got—” Dean interrupts himself, rolling his eyes. “Close your eyes next time, man.”
“You,” he says, holding the small bounty with delicate hands, “you son of a bitch. Bury the fuckin’ lede, why don’t you?”
Ah, who fucking cares. He loses the thought along with the rest of himself in just a few more moments.
Until then, it’s enough, just barely, to grab Cas’ hand and hold on tight for as long as he’s allowed.
Cas looks at him, a thousand things under his expression, all too dulled to read. His eyes go back to his plate. “They’re not,” he says. “Rodents. Raccoons belong to the order Carnivora.”
He’s halfway through the first rib—the sauce is sweet; he’d bet any car that wasn’t his own that there’s molasses somewhere in the bottle—when he looks up to see Cas with arms still hanging at his sides. Dean sighs, leans over the table on his elbows.
“Hilarious.” Sam looks at him. “You know you could, though, right? If you wanted? We’ve definitely earned at least that.”
The look in Cas’ eyes is unspeakably gentle, the kind you get from too many washes on a t-shirt, the kind that comes from breaking something down. Dean swallows it down and is very, very careful of the living thing in between his fingers.
Like a shot, Cas’ hand is on his dick and Dean lasts an entirely admirable fifteen seconds longer before spilling between them with a shout that might be wordless, but is equally likely to be Cas’ name, repeated over, over, over again.
Here’s where Dean’s supposed to reassure him, find out what that means—if it does anything besides some kind of angelic dirty talk designed to make Dean’s brain melt out his ear—but, unfortunately, it’s also where Cas shifts to a simply catastrophic angle and keeps at it until Dean can’t think about anything except the feeling of himself dissolving into goo.
“This is my home,” Cas says, and Dean tries not to let the jolt he feels at the words show on his face. “This is
Dean does some of head tilting of his own, wobbling back and forth like he’s searching for something before the sideways grin on his face softens. “Oh, no, like—I just meant, things go right, my mouth’s gonna be kinda occupied from this point, dude.”
“That’s awfully rude to speak to your senior that way,” Balthazar says as he cuts into the conversation, casually slinging his arm over Castiel’s shoulder who tenses under his touch. Dean visibly tenses as well and steps back from his girlfriend in uncertainty.
get Dean Winchester started on his car,” Castiel finally spoke up, causing a few of the girls to jump in surprise. “He will never shut up.”
“Sure, why not?” Dean takes off his sunglasses and leans down for a quick selfie when the bell rings and streams of children begin pouring out of their classes.
“Look, I’m just going to put this plainly,” Dean begins. “I’m really...honored but us, we would never work out. I mean, I’m flattered you think I have golden specks in my eyes…”
In the end, his students were still teenagers and would be caught watching youtube or Netflix in class so he would have to confiscate their phones for the rest of class. He always felt guilty if he kept it any longer so he would pass the phones to his co-worker, Jo Harvelle. Jo also happened to be the daughter of the principal and an avid fan of Wayward Winchester. Castiel would sometimes listen to her rant about how much she liked or disliked something in his husband’s videos during their breaks with minimum comments. If he liked anything she said, he would go home and tell Dean and the two would laugh over it. It wasn’t until Jo began continuously talking about the theories regarding who Dean’s mystery lover could be and comments regarding his sexuality did Dean finally feel like he was ready to open up to his fans with his husband’s encouragement.
“Harry Styles I get,” Dean nods in approval. “He sure rocked the Red Carpet but who’s...D-Dragon? From the Bigbang Theory?”
Castiel’s alarm clock blared loudly as he hit the off button and rubbed his eyes open. He sighed as he tapped Dean’s hands around his waist, trying to loosen his arms. Dean protested by whining and holding him closer. Castiel sighs and stays in the position for a few moments, basking in the peaceful quietness as he traced shapes on Dean’s left arm. His eyes began drooping when he looked back at his alarm clock to check how much time he had when he suddenly bolted out of bed.
“Pfft,” Dean waves it off with a flick of his wrist. “Don’t tell me you’re one of those weebs who listens to
“No,” he shakes his head. “I just don’t know many people who still use cassette tapes. Maybe my dead grandma.”
“Oh, my God!” Castiel instantly drops to his feet and helps the girl, who he recognizes is Lisa Braedon, to her feet. “Are you alright? Do you need to go to the nurse’s office?”
Castiel Novak was a socially inept introvert to those who personally knew him and just a quiet guy to those who didn’t. He never knew his mother and had an absent father throughout his childhood. Despite the terrible credentials, his father had adopted a boy before Castiel was born from Africa named Uriel. He also had an older half-sister named Anna whom he was closest to throughout his childhood. Castiel and Uriel were terrible step-siblings with Uriel always bullying Cas into submission during their childhood. Since his home wasn’t a safe place, he would often find sanctuary at the local library and immersed himself in history and literature. He had a short-term girlfriend named Hester whom he dated for a few months as a teenager when he was under the pressure of his father to date girls. Not wanting to disappoint him further, Cas tried to court his dad’s business friend’s daughter but it ended up a mess since Cas was, well, gayer than a rainbow unicorn. Due to his excellent grades, he was offered a full-ride scholarship to the University of Kansas. He accepted the offer because he wanted to get as far away from home as he could and got his bachelor’s degree in education before interning at a public school. Because he loved working at the high school so much, he decided to become a substitute teacher for the district.
“And the moment’s ruined,” Castiel playfully pushes Dean away and stands up. “I’ll go get dinner started.”
Balthazar says nothing as they silently bid each other goodbye and Castiel headed into his first period.
Anna was a vibrant girl with a character-like personality who loved to paint and wore eccentric patterned clothing. She had perceptive hazel eyes and bright red hair that drew a lot of attention to her since it wasn’t the most common in these parts of Kansas. Balthazar was almost the complete opposite with his broody personality and generic bad-boy attitude but also enjoyed the arts and played in the marching band as a sousaphonist. The only reason he and Castiel met in the first place was that they were neighbors since they were toddlers. Castiel was the quietest of the odd trio and was often seen reading a novel or sketching something abstract in his notebook. Nobody knows what he actually draws or if he’s even any good because no one has seen in it and frankly, they weren’t really interested.
Castiel kept all the letters in a green box that he hid under a loose floorhead in his bedroom under his dresser where they only saw the light of day if he added a letter. Seeing as it was a childish hobby, Castiel decided to stop entertaining his daydreams but kept the letters as a memento of his childhood. They were never supposed to be let out of the box, nonetheless read by eyes other than his. That is until Uriel stumbled upon them and sent them away.
“See you at home, angel,” he plants a chaste kiss on Cas’s lips before doing a salute and exiting the school, grinning the whole way back to the impala.
“Yeah,” Jo lets out a chuckle. “For a while now. He became really popular after his coming out video.”
Castiel was over the moon when Dean’s videos started gaining traction a few months later. He was scared at the same time because he didn’t know what Dean would do with the newfound fame but he wasn’t ready for him to leave his life forever, and neither was Dean. After one of Castiel’s midterm exams, Dean asked Cas to hang out with him at the coffee shop where they had met. By this time Castiel had almost graduated and had a position waiting for him at the public high school so things were finally going well for the two. Castiel was scared for the meeting, thinking it was goodbye, and almost had a panic attack before Dean asked him to be his boyfriend. Of course, Castiel then felt stupid, said yes, and Dean declared that day to be their first date. Two years later on the exact same date at the exact same spot, Dean Winchester got down on one knee and asked Castiel to marry him.
Dean accepted it with a curt nod, hoping his face did not betray the dirty feeling he felt for doing so. Dean could only watch as tears fell from of the older man's eyes and disappeared into the curls of his beard as they listened to his wife's cries of anguish pierce the empty night's silence.
The other man only shook his head softly in response, staring blankly at a plant in the garden, as if trying to figure out whether or not it was a weed. Dean chewed on his lip, wracking his brain for something to say, but came up with nothing. Tightening his grip on Impala's reins, he was about to turn away when the man's voice stopped him, “The barn on the edge of the forest is unlocked. The loft is yours for the night.”
His eyes were aching and heavy when he finally flipped the book shut. Tossing the journal back into his pack, he blew out the lantern and collapsed onto a pile of old blankets and stale hay, pulling his cloak overtop him. Dawn was only a few hours away, and he had a long ride ahead of him.
“Lyra,” Dean remembered, his tongue feeling too heavy as it stumbled over her name. He ground his teeth together in an effort to compose himself before he opened his mouth to continue. Lyra was peering past his shoulder, as if looking for something hiding in the dark behind him. Her eyes went wide, and Dean faltered. He offered no resistance as Lyra pushed past him and rushed over to Impala, her pale nightgown fluttering behind her. He watched her fall to her knees at the mare’s side, reaching for the canvas with trembling hands before she hesitated, pulling back to cover her mouth as a sob escaped her throat. She reached again, carefully pulling away the loose cover. Lyra screamed.
Dean quickly corrects himself when he sees Castiel slightly deflate. “Well, not weird but...unique. Anyways now you got Cas.”
“I can see what your music taste is,” Castiel says as he shuffles through Dean’s collection of old cassette tapes.
“That term is incorrect and I will have you know that it’s just as valid as other music genres and the only reason you locals hate it is because they’re foreigners and speak in a different language. More than half of you guys would stop judging if you actually
Castiel takes out his earbuds and phone and plays his favorite playlist before he resumes his position of shame. He only looks back up to pay for his milkshake, as to which Ellen said it was on the house, and when he heard someone clear their throat loudly behind him. He pauses his music and takes out his earbuds before he slowly turns around in his chair to face Dean Winchester.
