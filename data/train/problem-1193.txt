“You should rest,” he suggested. “I'm going to finish sorting things out with Mycroft.” John made a face but nodded, letting go of the dragon's hands as he got up.
The next several weeks passed in a blur, going for fittings, packing, and being detailed on their mission. Sherlock remained obstinate about anyone touching him which made fitting his harnesses quite difficult. He had been sulking in his dragon form more than human and had created quite the sizable crevice in the couch much to John's displeasure. The big ship out day came though with a sniveling Mrs. Hudson waving them off as Sherlock was loaded into the back of a truck in a crate, John clambering in after him. He watched the scenery as they drove, one hand pressed against Sherlock's crate. “It'll be a long time till we get back here,” he mumbled to the dragon who let out a puff of breath and smacked his tail against the floor.
They climbed until they were above the clouds and smoke, Sherlock leveling out and allowing John to sit up a bit. The air was cool but refreshing, the moon a sliver above them and the stars gleaming gently. The dragon beneath him settled in to an easy pace, mostly gliding with the occasional flap of wings. John reached in to his jacket pocket and pulled out the tube of ointment he'd sequestered there and squeezed out a decent amount, looking for the worst of the spots first. When the cool balm touched Sherlock's pebbled skin, he jerked slightly, glancing back at John in question then his eyes closed and he let out a purring moan, shoulder shifting and pressing in to the soldier's hand.
“Okay,” John said simply. Sherlock's eyes darted to his, searching, assessing. “This is fine,” John reassured. “I'm fine. We'll do something to stop Zane's mad experiments.” Sherlock smiled softly, nuzzling their tangled hands.
Sherlock landed a good ways away from the camp, not wanting a repeat of their previous fight, but didn't stop as he hit the ground. He galloped along the sandy desert, wings tucking against his sides, and made a series of whistles happily. John clung to the saddle wildly for a moment but quickly adjusted the rhythm of his own body to match the swaying movements of the dragon and grinned at the look of joy on Sherlock's face. The gates were opened for them as they neared and Sherlock didn't slow, blowing by the guardsmen and leaving them cursing in his dust. He chortled in amusement and angled towards the medical tent, sliding to a stop in front of a baffled Mike Stamford.
“Mrs. Hudson you should probably go,” John finally turned and told her, offering a hand to help her up.
John woke in the middle of the night to a low growl and realized Sherlock was crouched next to his cot, staring at a shadow on the side of the tent. A high pitched rasping chuckle came from the dragon outside his tent and an obsidian nose snuffled under the tent door. Sherlock let out the most ferocious snarling growl he'd ever heard come from the dragon and the obsidian nose withdrew, the rasping chuckle sounding again before the dragon slowly moved away.
It had been several weeks since Sherlock and John had returned from their mission. Sherlock had remained if possible both incredibly distant but constantly near. The dragon was always within sight, but he remained in his dragon form most of the time, avoiding talking to the soldier. John spent most of his time resting his leg and reading. There was a small collection of books at the camp and it didn't take him long to work through most of them. Sherlock seemed to find the books fascinating and would slide under John's feet and listen to the soldier read aloud. This is when the dragon was most relaxed, eyes heavily lidded and wings drooped across the ground. John was reading rhythmic lines of Thoreau when he was summoned to meet with General Bowen.
“John Watson,” a voice called suddenly. “And dragon: Sherlock.” Someone snickered and Sherlock spun, fixing a piercing glare on the snivelling dragon that had dared laugh at him.
The sun had been up for several hours and was getting close to directly overhead when Sherlock started to descend once more. John peered around curiously as they dropped below the clouds and noticed a small village in the distance.
“I don't want to talk about it!” Sherlock snapped, tying the ends of his bandage down a little tighter than necessary and making John wince. “Are you all right now?” he asked, voice softer.
The next few hours went by in a blur as John hurried around to his fallen comrades, fixing, bandaging, healing. Sherlock stayed firmly beside him, eyes still wary, but helping him lifting and moving patients. When the sun was starting to go down they were finally instructed to head back to camp. John was wobbly on his feet and leaned heavily against Sherlock as they made their way back. There were several packs strapped to the dragon's back and he was not entirely happy about being used as a pack horse, but he walked slowly beside John to help him along. As they entered the gates there was sudden cheering and a rush of soldiers came towards them, dragging John into the fray and smacking him on the back.
“Sherlock!” John yelped. “We just went for a flight sir. I'm so sorry. We were just getting so bored in the medical tent.”
“This is ridiculous,” he snarled to Bowen, getting to his feet and pacing. “I won't have this mission in the hands of such a soft hearted ninny.”
“Can everyone line up please!” a man yelled out from a small constructed stage. A man in general's garb stepped up to the stage watching them all as they organized themselves.
“I knew you were hurting you stubborn ass,” John scolded with a laugh, putting a small amount on the other shoulder that wasn't as badly burnt. He couldn't do as much as he wanted, they'd have to be careful with their supplies. Sherlock chirruped his thanks, then focused back on their path, John settling in to place.
“Come on big fella,” John encouraged, trying to get Sherlock to the medical tent. “I have to clean these wounds.” As they stumbled inside Sherlock changed to his human form, grasping at his shoulder painfully.
“I remember you saying adventure, you're clearly army. Army requires their higher officers and medical professionals to have dragons these days. You're a doctor which is how you ended up with me, so where are we going? Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Sherlock now,” John growled, starting to get up himself. The dragon grumbled but helped him to his feet, steadying him as he latched on to Sherlock's forearms. John stood there for several minutes with his eyes closed, swaying slightly, grip tight. Slowly he opened his eyes, focusing on the gentle rise and fall of Sherlock's chest and his grip loosened.
“It's not your fault,” he reassured, he leaned his head forward, resting it against Sherlock's broad muzzle. The dragon started shrinking, pulling John into his arms gingerly, wings wrapping around the two of them. He shifted behind the soldier, drawing him into his lap and cradling him gently. John immediately relaxed against him, nuzzling his face into Sherlock's neck. He quickly fell asleep in the warmth of Sherlock's hold, breathing evening out finally.
“Sir, sir, emergency!” John didn't quite know what happened at first except for suddenly it was quite warm. Sherlock was pressed against him, tail curled protectively and wing curved over him, snarling at the intruder who stood there smirking slightly.
“This soft hearted ninny is the only mounted pair you have besides me and I have my own part to play,” Bowen commented idly, picking at one of his nails. “Something to do with soldiers treating their dragons like property or something of the sort.”Zane turned and glared at the other general who acted oblivious.
When John reported to the medical tent the next day Sherlock still hadn't shown up and he was growing slightly worried. General Bowen was waiting for him and John saluted before joining him. He sat on the cot across, smiling softly as he picked up a roll of bandage and started rerolling it.
“I'll pack the bags,” Sherlock finally grumbled, pulling away and yanking on his jumpsuit. John stumbled back, plopping down into his cot and watching in silence as Sherlock gathered the things they'd need. Not knowing what else to do John grabbed his blanket, curling up and facing the wall of the tent. He might as well get an early night if they were heading out in the morning. He was almost fully asleep when a warm body slid into the cot behind him, nose nuzzling between his shoulder blades. He smiled softly and fell into blissful darkness.
He curled up in his corner when they got back, watching silently as John packed then started fiddling around with some long pieces of wood. He snuffled curiously and John smiled up at him sheepishly.
“This is Molly,” Mike introduced, gesturing to the dragon next to him. “Had her about 3 months now. She's an earth dragon.” Molly refused to make eye contact with John and especially Sherlock.
“Sherlock go!” John yelled, urging the dragon down towards the attack. Sherlock leveled out right above the cloud, scooping air and pushed towards it. The whirlwind of air was dispersing the cloud, making it so they could see what was going on. The enemy soldiers had created a sneak attack and were fighting hand to hand with many of their own team. Sherlock was looking around quickly, assessing, then went into a dive. John's hair stood on end as he felt the electrical build up then Sherlock was shooting an attack, taking enemies down left and right. A sonic boom went sailing past them and hit another enemy and John turned to see Lestrade and Bowen had joined the fray. Lestrade was an air dragon and his sonic booms were knocking people over as he created a more powerful whirlwind around them to push the rest of the dust cloud away. John focused back on what they were doing just as Sherlock slammed into the ground, whipping his tail around and taking out two more men as he shot an attack at another. John slid from his back, hurrying towards an injured comrade as Sherlock stayed close behind him. The man grabbed hold of John's arm as he reached him, his other hand pressed to his side where an arrow was protruding.
“It hurts,” John mumbled, trying not to sound totally pathetic. Sherlock smiled gently, hand ghosting through John's hair a moment before he was digging through the medical bags again. He came back with a water bottle and a few pain pills, handing them over one at a time.
“I guess we should go pack then,” John sighed, getting to his feet slowly. Sherlock scrambled forward to steady the soldier, drawing another snort from general Zane.
“I know you're still recovering,” Bowen started, leaning forward with his hands clasped in front of him. “But this is time sensitive and most of it will be mounted work. Are you up for it?”
The compound was huge and John swallowed nervously as Bowen gestured at him and then slipped off in to the night towards his destination. Sherlock waited several moments before descending towards where they would be picking up their package. His wings were tight against his sides and over John's legs and the doctor could feel how tense the dragon's body was. He rubbed over Sherlock's shoulder gently to reassure him and felt him relax a fraction. They crouched behind a retaining wall and waited, John laying flat across the dragon's back until they heard the boom and crumbling of a wall being blown to bits. Alarms started going off and John could see people running toward the commotion when he peered over the wall. He patted Sherlock's shoulder when the coast seemed clear and the dragon launched up and over the wall, running towards where they'd enter the building. A small puff of one of Sherlock's lightning balls fried the opening mechanism on the door and the dragon shoved it open with a creak, barely squeezing through the door. The halls were dark except for some ominous red emergency lights high on the ceiling. Sherlock's eyes were glowing slightly in the dark as he looked around then took off down the hall. The halls were wide enough for the dragon to move down, but if he had to turn around for any reason it was going to be a struggle John was realizing.
“He goes by Sherlock,” Greasy called from outside the cage and the dragon whipped its head around and let out a hissing snarl in the man's direction.
“It's fine,” Bowen chuckled, slinging the bag over his shoulder. “I'll get out of your hair, you need rest and pain meds. Get well soon Watson.” John nodded, giving a shoddy salute and turned his attention back to the dragon that was curled against his side pouting.
“Is that camp?” he blanched, seeing a group of buildings and tents in the distance. Sherlock chirruped happily, glancing back at him with one golden eye. “You must have been hauling ass for us to have gotten this far.” The dragon chortled, looking rather proud of himself as they started descending.
“Sherlock!” John snapped after the third shock, shaking the numbness out of his hand. The dragon looked sheepish, turning and shoving his muzzle in to John's arms. “Just calm down, okay?” John urged, rubbing between the dragon's eyes. Sherlock finally nodded, turning and continuing towards the general's tent, scales no longer crackling. By the time they reached the tent John was exhausted and sore and Sherlock was chirping worriedly, but the soldier stubbornly kept walking. He rang the bell hanging outside of the tent flap and straightened as best he could, a slight grimace to the corner of his mouth.
“Not very well,” John admitted, watching the general press a kiss to the top of Lestrade's head as he slipped out of his hold and stretched. Lestrade didn't say anything, just slipped in to his natural form and ambled towards the shady tree.
When John woke the next morning he finally felt fully rested and ready to face whatever they needed to do. Sherlock however, was buried rather awkwardly against his back, face between his shoulder blades and legs tangled together. “Sherlock,” John whispered, shaking the dragon's arm that was wrapped around his waist gently. The dragon snorted, head raising quickly and looking around for trouble. John laughed at the dragon's mussed curls and confused expression, sitting up and smoothing his own hair down. Sherlock looked perturbed at his laughter, expression cross and without much warning put a hand over his face and shoved him down. John yelped then felt the dragon settle over him, chest warm. He lifted his hand enough to uncover John's mouth and pressed a heated kiss to the doctor's lips until John was breathless and panting. He leaned down, pressing his lips to John's ear and let out a stream of hot air.
“Wait what?” John sputtered, but the dragon was already shifting and crouching expectantly. John climbed up slowly, settling in front of the dragon's wings and tightening his knees the best he could. Sherlock didn't give him much adjustment time and took off, trying to keep his gait easy. John grabbed on to a couple of his back spines to hang on, knees squeezing for dear life as they made their way to the large doors. John slid down from the dragon's back and pulled the door open a crack, peering inside. He couldn't see anyone so he pulled it open the rest of the way for the dragon to enter, walking next to him to the room Bowen had indicated. The walls were glass and John could see a pedestal in the room, fog obscuring the item inside. They ducked behind a desk as a couple scientists walked in to the room, talking quickly to each other.
When Sherlock finally returned a couple hours later John had a roaring fire going and had even heated up some stones to trade out of the egg's nest. Sherlock chirruped happily at that and dropped the deer he'd killed at the entrance to the cave. He changed as he walked, scooping up the shorts John had left out for him and ruffling his golden hair. He yanked them on quickly, the waist band hanging lower on his hips than usual and went to check on the egg.
“He's army issue Mrs. Hudson. I put it off as long as I could, you know I did,” John sighed, shuffling her towards the door. “We'll be out of your hair in no time.” She started sputtering, but John managed to get the door shut and locked before she could get anything else in. “You should probably change and get dressed,” John called to the dragon. “We'll have to get going soon.” Another tail smack was his only response as he headed to take a shower quickly before they had to report to the army base.
“Help me please!” he cried, gripping the arrow shaft tighter. John nodded sharply, pulling his hand away and assessing the damage. Sherlock had already moved the bag he needed within reach and he grabbed his supplies quickly. The majority of the arrow shaft he broke off, careful not to jar the wound more. He gathered a wad of cotton and a pressure bandage and looked up at the man's scared eyes.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and suddenly they were shooting into the air, gaining altitude with Lestrade and Bowen right behind them. John gripped the handle tightly, but let out a whoop of delight as Sherlock climbed higher and higher, the distance between Lestrade and Bowen growing. Wings snapped open suddenly, scooping air then they were diving, flying past a startled Lestrade. Sherlock spun as they dived, making John dizzy and his heart race. They leveled out a hundred feet over the marching group below, drawing quite a few hoots and claps. A moment later Lestrade leveled out next to them, breathing heavily, he'd obviously worked hard to catch up to them. Sherlock let out a grunting chuckle and John patted his neck affectionately.
Finally he headed towards the cave, needing some rest. He pulled the egg out of his pack first, sitting it in a cushion of clothes carefully before digging for something for them to eat. Sherlock was ambling around, shoving rocks in to a small circle with his nose then startled John when he let out a puff of lightning, making the stones glow white hot and sizzle. He looked pleased, then grabbed the egg gently from where John had put it and placed it in the little nest. John watched in amusement, chewing on a granola bar as the dragon fretted, pushing rocks closer and adjusting the egg until he was happy and wandered back towards him.
“We want to see that your dragon has some instinct to protect. It's hard to have a partner that has no interest in your safety whatsoever.” Bowen was scratching away on something on his desk then paged fitters to come measure Sherlock for his harnesses. “Looks like you found a good one John Watson.”
“Peeping tom,” John muttered, sticking his tongue out at the dragon. He finished cleaning up then climbed out of the river, smirking at Sherlock's widening eyes. He dried off quickly, shrugging in to a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, the shirt clinging slightly to his damp skin. The dragon's tail was smacking the ground lightly, a small stream of smoke coming from his nostrils as he got up, wings raising slightly. “What are you...” he started then gasped as he was tackled to the ground.
“We're going for a ride,” Sherlock explained, dumping his things on the floor. “If I don't get out of here for a little while I'm going to burst.” John didn't even argue as Sherlock changed, picking up the harnesses and fitting them into place and tightening buckles. They exited the tent through the back, avoiding the security guards patrolling the main area and Sherlock kneeled to let John clamber unsteadily onto his back. He only had one arm to hang on with so he tightened his knees around Sherlock's sides nervously. The dragon chortled then burst into the air, gaining as much height as he could as quickly as he could. They cleared the clouds overhead and Sherlock leveled out, moving into a gentle rhythmic pace. John sighed as the cool breeze brushed his face, patting the side of Sherlock's neck.
Oh, for an experiment. Sherlock said, not slowing his pacing down. John thought he could grow real tired on Sherlock’s habit of only answering just the question he was asked and not the one that was implied.
- Yeah, you know: food, drink, talk, candles at the table, maybe a kiss at the end if the date is going well. John felt he was talking too much and too fast but he really wanted Sherlock to say yes.
“Well you didn’t, did you?” The bitterness in his voice was easy to hear. Sherlock was lost for words. This had gotten so out of hand.
I do to, the blush on Sherlock’s cheeks grew more prominent as John looked at him. John could sense it was a big admission for a man who said feelings was to complicated and messy to deal with.
- Isn’t that a code for sex? You only mentioned kisses before. John had to stop; he took Sherlock’s hand to make him stop as well. Then he let go because it felt too familiar, but he regretted it as soon as he let go.
I’m sorry, Sherlock said. John startled. He had prepared a speech for Sherlock which started with the same words. It threw him for a loop. Did Sherlock say he was sorry or did he know what John wanted to say and beat him to it.
- You say that I don’t want to take things further, how can you be so blind? It’s taking all my willpower when we kiss to not throw you over my shoulder, taking you into my bedroom and not letting you go for days. Sherlock spat the words out. They were words of anger, not of seduction. Still John could feel himself responding.
“Your shirt, there's blood on it.” Anger filled Sherlock, making it easier to breathe again. This was how John did it, react with anger instead of sadness, it made a lot of things easier. He spun around and faced John and bellowed.
“I can hunt for game, I can teach you edible plants. We can forage. As for the army...” his gaze darkened. “I'll take care of them.” The dragon shifted forward, pressing a kiss to John's temple, then spun and went back to his previous task digging through the packs. John sighed but bent to start packing all the items Sherlock had selected in to a single pack. They wouldn't be able to take much with them without the harness to secure packs so John made sure to pack the bag as snugly as possible. When he stood back up from his stooped position Sherlock was right behind him and wrapped an arm around his waist, drawing him back gently against him.
“Sherlock,” John interrupted, drawing the dragon's gaze back to him. “How are we going to survive out here? The army will search for us.”
He went careening into the forest canopy, smashing into a thick limb, wings arched back protectively around John. When they finally stopped moving John was barely hanging on to the saddle. Blood was seeping down his leg and Sherlock's scales were scorched with ash around his leg. John carefully slid down on to the wide branch, clinging to Sherlock's harness as he chirruped frantically. Once John was sitting against the trunk Sherlock quickly shrank, wings arching high over his head protectively.
“We have property to recover that was stolen,” Bowen explained. “I'll be going in with you with Lestrade. Zane will stay here. I need you to recover the property while I draw everyone away.”
“I needed a break,” he explained as he buttoned. “It's been a long time since I've flown this far in one day.”
He'd been clattering around noisily in the kitchen for a while when he realized he wasn't the only one in the kitchen any longer. He turned and about dropped his cuppa, mouth dropping in shock. A nude, tall pale man was standing in the doorway, dark curls grazing his forehead. He had two small curved horns nestled in his hair and a scattering of scales across his body. Two large leathery wings were curled almost protectively around his shoulders as he took a look around.
“Are you sure you can do this?” he asked John seriously, hand reaching out to run through John's shaggy hair. John found himself leaning into the hand without realizing it and Sherlock smiled softly, thumb stroking the man's cheek bone.
“Mike!” John greeted, shaking his hand firmly. Sherlock drew up beside John, standing tall and proud and the yellow dragon sank back further.
“Ain't seen nothing faster,” he relented. When John turned back around the dragon had come closer, allowing him to get a better look. It was almost cat like, sturdy but graceful and when the light caught the scales just right there was a purple sheen to the bottom arc of each scale. His golden eyes took in John as much as John was taking in him.
So it's been a really long time guys. I've felt terrible for making you wait but I was going through some stuff and stress and the words don't come when you're feeling so low. Anyways! I moved to a new town, I'm living on my own with my dog and I love this town. It's got everything I love. There's a Barnes & Noble in walking distance people!!!! I've been here a few months now, I absolutely adore my new job, and I'm incredibly happy. So I'm getting back in to the writing spirit, I've posted what I have already written and I started writing some more this afternoon. I'm on call this weekend so I'm stuck at home and I have a writing streak blossoming in my brain.
“What's going on with Mycroft?” John asked softly, squeezing Sherlock's fingers to get his attention.
I won't be able to post again for a few days because of work so here's a little more because I was on a role today. Also SMUTTY SMUT SMUT. But I'm also a dick about it, so you get what you get lol
He finally stepped aside, nuzzling into John gently to see if he was all right. John used his good arm to wrap around Sherlock's neck and be pulled to his feet where he stood with trembling knees for a moment before heading back towards the clearing. Sherlock shrank as they walked, shaking out leathery wings and tucking them neatly against his back. He snatched his discarded pants off the ground nearby, yanked them on and steered John to a tree stump to sit on. John dropped happily to his seat, allowing Sherlock to ease his shirt over his head to better see the wound in his shoulder. It was sore more than anything but there were several puncture marks from the dragons sharp claws. Sherlock went to the medical bag, gathering antibacterial ointment and bandages as John watched him in a daze.
“John!” he heard Sherlock yell as the man came stumbling towards them. The doctor glanced up enough to see his dragon shove at the green one with a snarl, intimidating even in his human form. Mycroft was walking more sedately behind him, still in dragon form and fixed the dragon that had attacked him with a glare. Sherlock knelt down next to him, afraid to touch, eyes half gold with rage. “Let's get you back to the river,” he choked, taking him by the forearms. His back and calves seemed to have gotten the worst of the lacerations, but he cried out as he was pulled to his feet, the cuts stretching and bleeding more. “I know John, I know,” Sherlock was hissing in sympathy. “Do you want me to carry you?” John looked torn, he knew it would hurt, but walking like this would take forever and probably hurt just as much in the long run. He finally nodded and set his jaw as Sherlock bent, scooping behind John's knees and around his back. The doctor cried again when he was lifted, leaning his head heavily against the dragon's chest and gasping for breath.
“A dragon! Yes I'm aware,” John grumbled, cheeks flush as he went back to his task. Sherlock chuckled but grabbed another knife to go help. John skinned while Sherlock gutted, setting aside the liver for himself when John made a face at him. While John went out to bury entrails, Sherlock started dicing up chunks of meat, tossing them in to a small pot they had then on to a clean stone. John came back with a tangle of vines and while Sherlock was cooking chunks of meat he started to weave them together in to a sort of basket. When he ran out of vine he had half of a decent sized basket made and seemed pleased. Next he went and gathered several wide flat stones and set them up along the edge of the fire where they would get warm but not hot then started cutting strips of meat and laying it out on to the rocks.
“Sherlock what is that?” Mycroft demanded from the cave entrance, gesturing at the egg with his umbrella and making John giggle again.
“Sherlock!” John reprimanded even as he was wincing in pain. “Don't talk to him like that!” The dragon dropped his gaze submissively, wings drooping, and pressed his forehead into John's bicep that wasn't currently being worked on.
“Fights orders constantly, fights handlers like the devil, plus that lightning blast of his definitely has some kick.” The dragon bared its fangs in a smirking leer if dragons could do such things, lightning crackling over his scales.
“Sherlock,” John scolded softly, fingers grazing the marks at his shoulder. The dragon snorted, pushing past him and crouching so John could climb on. He grumbled to himself but gathered the pack he'd been working on, moving the egg to the new pack on the very top and packed clothes around it gently. Sherlock watched him curiously, gaze soft, and let John take his time climbing and settling himself on to the dragon's back. The soldier patted his neck when he was ready and Sherlock leapt in to the nearest tree to climb up and out. John clung to the dragon's neck as they climbed, keeping himself flat until they reached the top of the canopy where Sherlock paused a moment, branch swaying beneath his weight. They looked toward the compound, black smoke filling the air, almost every building burning hot and bright. Sherlock chuffed softly, then raised his wings, giving John a chance to wrap around his neck again.
- It was obvious from the photo we saw earlier, the similarities was striking. Same nose, same mouth, Sherlock intervened. Miss Williams didn’t seem to mind.
Your tone suggest you already know. I don’t know why you want me to repeat it? Sherlock looked bored. It made John close his hands on the edge of his desk to fight the impulse of shake some sense into the man.
"I heard he was in a bit of trouble" Mr Holmes said and sat down in the chair opposite the desk. The one Sherlock had sat in the day before. John remained standing. He didn’t trust this man and his instincts told him to not place Mr Holmes between himself and the door.
John picked up his bag, put the light out and close his door behind him. He wondered if he could ever look at that door again without thinking about Sherlock, thinking about what John had done to him.
“Irene was, is, just an infatuation. She intrigues me, but no more than a painting or a piece of music. I can’t deny she affects me, but a beautiful piece of music does that as well. It’s nothing compared to my feelings towards you.” Sherlock blushed, both embarrass and liberated talking about his feelings so freely.
What’s wrong? Sometimes John was grateful over Mollys’ knack of seeing through him, today wasn’t one of those days.
I rarely eat. My landlady usually makes something for me. John didn’t comment on that, he thought that there would be a later time that he could talk to Sherlock about taking care of himself. He didn’t want to do it on their first date, if this even was a date, he guessed so. Instead he rose, taking on of the folders Sherlock was holding. He leaned in kissing Sherlock softly on the lips. He had been thinking quit a lot about if he should make any advances tonight. He had felt that it might be safest to let Sherlock take all the initiatives. But he dared one kiss, not letting it turn into something else. They both sighed as John ended the kiss, smiling at each other. Sherlock had just leaned in to kiss John again when his phone rang. Sherlock answered it, looking irritated.
“Bet you didn’t see that one coming” he teased. Sherlock didn’t answer, he didn’t think. Instead he fell on his knees, moved closer to John, took his head between his hands and kissed him again.
- I... Sherlock sighted. He was quiet for a moment longer, and then started the monologue John was waiting for.
- Out, come on John! John had to hurry to keep up. Sherlock was waving down a cab when he exited the apartment. Sherlock got in and hold the door open for John. He said an address to the cabbie that John didn’t recognise. It was in a posh part of town so he had his suspicion, but he still asked.
- So, tomorrow at eight? He asked. Sherlock nodded again and John left the kitchen, trying to hide his smile.
- Obviously, it’s shame. Sherlock held John's gaze but he was feed up with Sherlock’s mind games and looked away. Staring out of the window and didn’t say another word as the cab took them home. He went straight to the kitchen when they got home. His plan was a cup of tea to calm himself down and then bed. At the corner of his eye he could see Sherlock standing in the doorway. He could feel it as well. It seemed that John couldn’t get too far away from Sherlock this evening. Though the safe distance and kitchen table between them, John felt it like Sherlock was standing next to him, towering over him. He really needed to get away to the relative safety of his room.
“That feels like another conversation altogether but it doesn’t change my mind”. John let his hand on Sherlock’s knee traver up a bit and then back again. It made Sherlock draw a sharp breath of air. John smiled knowingly. He leaned in closer.
“I have wanted a life with you since the beginning, a life of… partnership. Though I know that you want more out of a relationship than I have been able to provide so I have chosen not to speak of my emotions. You have made it clear that you harbor no such emotions towards me or any other man and I didn’t want to embarrass you. But have no doubt of the strength of my feelings for you. I do love you and I do want to spend my life with you.”  He stopped talking and dared to look at John. He had his head against the wall and was facing Sherlock, there were tears in his eyes.
That was nicer than I expected, Sherlock said, his fingers brushing his lips. John felt a bit put of by the remark.
I’m in love with him, he said with the feeling of falling of a cliff. When he saw Molly’s stunned face he realised he never told her he was gay. Her surprise could not just be from him being in love with Sherlock, she just commented on his looks.
- Are you trying to ask me if I’ve had sex? Is that really a question for a first date? John blushed.
-What? John said, stunned. He never could shake the feeling that he and Sherlock lived in different realities.
- He left his whole collection to us, his children. It’s written in his will. And all the other stamps are in the deposit box. She smiles a quick smile.
“I was done with dismembering Moriartys network and was heading home. I made a mistake and got caught by some people who thought I knew things about them that I shouldn't know and they wanted to know who sent me.” He startled as John put his hand on his shoulder, well away from the worst wounds.
"He is, but I think I should take it up with him in person instead of talking to you. Your brother seems old enough to fend for himself." Mr Holmes turned around with a knowing smile on his lips but didn’t in any other way acknowledge that John remained standing.
No I don’t. You seem to have a notion that because you have issues you have to punish yourself for it. A bit of fire crept into Sherlock’s voice, he stood straight with his chin lifted, defiant.
No I know, John said. He had guessed as much, since Sherlock called him John and had done since the first day. The fell into silence. John working, he didn’t know what Sherlock was doing. He looked like he was thinking hard but John had no idea what kept his mind occupied for so long.
His heart was beating harder than it should. There was something with this man, John felt drawn to him.
Hi, he manages to say. What on earth did Sherlock want? Did he need help steel more bodyparts? Maybe he thought John owed him to help now.
But… John started, Sherlock sighed and kissed John to silence him. John stood motionless, fighting the desire that raced through him. Sherlock was holding his hands, laced his fingers with Johns. It was a sweet kiss, slow and exploratory. After a while John relaxed, he didn’t feel as angry any more and that made the arousal easier to deal with. He could savour the moment. When Sherlock picked up on the change in John’s posture he let go of John’s hans. Instead putting both his hands on John’s back, drawing him closer. He broke of the kiss and put his face against John’s neck. He made a sound of such content that John’s heart swelled. He put one of his hands on Sherlock’s neck, the other one at the small of his back. John felt a bit deflated. He wanted to protect Sherlock, plain and simple: he loved him and wanted to protect him. Instead he assaulted him, what he just had done must be seen as sexual harassment. Even though Sherlock said he liked it had he been forced to push John away, John had been that oblivious for the signals from Sherlock.
"Can I help you with your concentration issue, is it something special?" Mr Holmes looked up at him alarmed, pink colouring his cheeks.
“It'll dry them out and create jerky,” he explained at Sherlock's curious gaze. “It lasts longer.” He filled the rocks with meat, traded out a few of the stones he'd set aside for the egg, then settled down next to the dragon who handed him a plate of food. John ate sleepily, his eyes half lidded and he started to lean in to Sherlock until he was snoring softly, plate tipping dangerously. The dragon chuckled, taking the plate and setting it aside before easing John down and cushioning his head on a thick sweater. He found the soldier's blanket and lay it over him, then slipped in to his natural form, winding his body around John and his tail around the egg's nest. It didn't take him long to fall asleep.
“Come on in,” Bowen called. John entered the tent, glancing back at Sherlock who was sliding in to his human form and yanking a pair of shorts on to follow. To John's surprise General Zane was also seated nearby and he quickly saluted both generals, fighting back against the twinge of pain.
Sherlock had never flown as hard as he was flying now, wings pulling at air, diving, paws outstretched desperately for John's falling body. 'The stupid dolt' he growled to himself. 'Should've said he couldn't fly.' Sherlock desperately snapped his wings back, pinning them against his body in a rocketing dive. They were about a hundred feet above the ground when his paw caught a hold of John's jacket and he snapped his wings open. An air current caught him, pushing him higher as he scrambled for a better hold on John. He pumped his wings once, twice, then glided toward the nearest clearing. He dropped John gently to the ground, coming to land a little further forward then rushed toward the prone man, changing as he went. He shrugged the harnesses off and turned John over, pressing his ear to his chest fearfully. “Passed out,” he grumbled, cradling John more gingerly against him. “Stupid idiot.” John's eyes fluttered open at the growl and he looked up at Sherlock in confusion.
By the time they finally made it to John's flat Sherlock was awake and getting quite cranky from being in the cage for too long. John could hear the electricity crackling over him and was getting nervous about opening the cage for the first time, but a deal was a deal. When the last delivery person left, he shut the door behind them and approached the crate nervously. He placed a hand over the big rusty latch and realized golden eyes were peering at him intently between the slats. He steadied his nerves and yanked the latch open. Sherlock burst from the cage, knocking John back onto the floor and whirlwinded around the living area finally stopping crouched over his new owner. He stared at him intently for several minutes, John not moving a muscle, then shrieked and went bounding to the back of the couch where he settled himself, one wing draping onto the floor haphazardly. John let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding and pushed himself upright, taking in the sight of the dragon curled up on his couch. He didn't seem like he'd be moving any time soon so John headed for the kitchen intent on making a cup of tea and some food for himself and his new companion.
“Get your dragon under control!” a voice barked from across the room, a man stepped forward, a beaded grey dragon beside him. The dragon bared its teeth at Sherlock in challenge that Sherlock accepted full heartedly, starting to move forward still in his human form.
“Please Sherlock,” John pleaded. “Just do what he's asking...nicely.” Sherlock grumbled, wondering again what made him want to please this army officer. A dark cloud gathered around him, seeming to flash lightning from within and then a cat-like shriek tore through the room and Sherlock burst out of the cloud, lightning crackling over his scales. He stood tall and proud, wings unfurled and glared at the grey dragon.
“It looks great!” John declared, turning his leg this way and that to examine the new splint. It was exactly what he was wanting for some extra protection. “Thanks Sherlock.” He smiled up at the dragon who was blushing from the praise, but snorted and looked away at John's gaze. “It's almost sunset, we should head towards the gate.” John watched Sherlock's shoulders slump and the dragon let out a sigh before changing back in to his dragon form. He helped pull the harnesses over the drake's head and strapped them in to place, attaching his packs.
“Where have you been?” a dark voice asked suddenly. General Zane came out of the shadows, his black dragon launching at Sherlock and slamming the dragon to the ground.
“I know, I know,” John chuckled. They were halfway through their meal when Bowen slipped into the seat across from them. John tried to clamber to his feet quickly but Bowen waved his hand, indicating he should sit back down.
John and Sherlock were packed up and headed toward the gate before the sun had even risen fully, steps not making a sound. Once they were near the front gate Sherlock kneeled, allowing John to climb into the saddle easily. Seconds later they were in the air, Sherlock gaining height so they could use the cloud cover to hide in. The air was still crisp and cool this early in the morning, but the rising sun promised warmth as John pulled his jacket more tightly around him. Sherlock had looked at the map they'd been given that morning and claimed he had it memorized so John sat back and relaxed, letting the dragon take them where they needed to go.
“John,” he whimpered, and allowed the doctor to lead him to an empty cot. John quickly gathered supplies and started cleaning the wounds, making Sherlock cry out in pain as he scrubbed. When he was all cleaned and wrapped up he curled up on the cot, whining painfully. John hesitated only a moment before carding a hand through Sherlock's dark curls gently. His fingers traced the shape of horns then wrapped curls around his fingers making the dragon purr in delight.
John was close to drifting off when his branch shook, making him gasp in fear. Sherlock's big head was thrust into his arms, deep purring noises instantly calming him as he stroked the dragon's crest gingerly. Big golden eyes looked up at him, taking in his face and examining his injuries. He chirruped sadly and John shook his head, smiling up at the dragon.
Sherlock's eyes were rimmed with gold as they walked back to camp, his teeth sharp and worrying at his lip. The green dragon with Mycroft hung back pretty far, not wanting to aggravate Sherlock more than he already was. When they reached the river Sherlock sat him down right on the edge of the pool he'd used yesterday, slicing through the back of John's shirt with one sharpened claw. John cringed as it was peeled away, blood had already started to dry, sticking in the cuts. “Come on,” he urged, splashing down in to the water clothes and all. He stepped between John's legs and helped him ease in to the water, letting him squeeze his forearms tightly when the frigid water hit the open wounds. “Turn,” he urged, easing him around and letting him lean against the bank.
They flew for hours, until the sun was rising, before Sherlock started to descend. John was surprisingly comfortable still. Riding without the saddle did have some benefits. He found a cave near a waterfall and landed by the river, letting John slide off as he drank. The soldier wandered around, examining their surroundings and nodded with satisfaction, jumping a bit when Sherlock bumped his head under John's arm. The sun was rising beautifully over the tree tops and John stood there for a while, just watching it, the dragon pressed against his side.
“Extensively,” Bowen grimaced simply. John wanted to ask more but sensed this was not the place and leaned back with a sigh.
“We'd be happy to sir.” Bowen got to his feet, straightening his jacket and clapping his hands together.
“We have to stay off the grid a while longer. Mycroft says the army is still searching. They found my harness at the facility so they're assuming we're dead but they can't declare it for sure until they complete their search.”
Sherlock was hotter than he'd ever felt before and nuzzled in to his neck, purring happily. He started to shift which was very strange when the dragon was on top of him and John turned bright red when he had a very naked Sherlock crouched over him, smoke still trailing from the corner of his mouth. His pupils were still cat-like in his blue eyes, wings widening in an impressive display. “Mine,” he growled lowly, bending and kissing John possessively. The soldier moaned, opening his mouth to that talented forked tongue and felt Sherlock's hardened length press against his leg. He was rutting slowly and languidly against his thigh, slightly clawed hands running down his sides and then grabbing his hip. John pulled away to gasp for air and Sherlock moved to his neck, lapping, sucking, and biting at every inch of skin he could find. His teeth had sharpened so the occasional nip made John gasp and his hips would surge up in to the dragon's, making him growl.
“Wake me at sunrise then,” Bowen yawned, patting John on the shoulder as he walked by. John settled himself on the abandoned rock, smiling when Sherlock joined him in human form.
The two passed the time together in companionable silence until John's relief arrived, then meandered to the mess tent to grab some dinner. They were stopped several times by people congratulating them still, Sherlock preening at the attention, but still not allowing anyone to touch him. This made John smile softly, it made him feel special that he was the only one allowed to touch the dragon. As he was thinking this, Sherlock pressed into his side, chirruping softly and gestured towards the mess tent.
“You're not eating enough,” John scolded as he brushed his hands off and got to his feet. He searched around for his knife, heading towards the deer. “You're losing too much weight. You look like you did when I found you.” A hand grabbed the back of his jacket and pulled him back, throwing him off balance. Sherlock grinned down at him from his awkward dipped position, a smear of blood across one cheek.
John was going to go insane. He'd been cooped up in the base for a week working the hospital tent and he was about to scream from boredom. Sherlock followed him around helping where he could but even the dragon was getting tired of the menial tasks. One evening when it had been especially slow Sherlock disappeared for about an hour, coming back when the sky had darkened with a load in his arms. John stared at him quizzically, realizing he had his saddle and harnesses in his arms.
- I don’t know what to talk about. I already know what you do in your spare time, or what your favourite TV-show is. John looked surprised at Sherlock.
No, he’s still here. I was going to kick him out but then his brother came for a chat and well… now he is staying. Molly sat up straight looking at John with big eyes.
"Then I’m obliged to tell you that if you do you will find compromising photos of children on your computer. The kind of pictures that will give you a long stay in her majesty's prisons." The anger flaring up in John made him blush.
“You mean that I? That you?” John felt silence. Sherlock felt he had nothing more to say. What could he say? He had offered up his heart and soul and now it was up to John to crush him.
- Sherlock, you must know I won’t do anything to you that you don’t want to. And I expect the same treatment from you.
“I know,” John said gently. Sherlock was grateful that he didn’t make a snide remark. He could realise that what he felt now was nothing compared to what John had endured.
When the men finally returned, they were all wearing rubber gloves and sturdy jumpsuits. They carried long sharp poles and one man was drawing up drugs into a syringe. The dragon started snarling behind John, drawing back slightly into the shadows, but John could see the electricity rolling over its scales.
'Moriarty', he snarled to himself. His brief moment of surprise gave Moriarty the chance to flip him off, flinging him into a wide tree. Sherlock snarled, baring his teeth and blasting another lightning blast at Moriarty who leaped out of the way. His wing was obviously badly injured, it was hanging at his side, flapping weakly. Sherlock smirked feigning an attack to Moriarty's left and when the dragon lurched the other direction he blasted a shot right to his chest, knocking the black dragon back. Moriarty hit the ground and lay still, wings angled oddly behind him. Sherlock snorted, slamming his paws on the ground in a display of dominance and let a roar escape him. Animal instincts satisfied he took off back towards John, worried about his human.
“I'll tie myself on, I'll be okay,” John chuckled. He pulled out of Sherlock's hold, crawling across the branch to their packs and Sherlock's harness. He extracted some rope and started tying one end around himself, starting when Sherlock was suddenly standing over him in his dragon form. John noticed his back spines were glowing a deep purple, lightning crackling over him and stared in awe a moment before Sherlock chirruped in concern. John shook his head to clear it and finished tying the rope to himself before working to strap Sherlock's harnesses back on him. Just doing that one task had John breathing heavily, leaning against Sherlock in exhaustion, his leg throbbing. Sherlock chirruped again in concern but John shook his head. “Just give me a minute, I'll be fine.” He finally took a deep breath and stepped up into the saddle, swinging himself up quickly. He made quick work of the rope, tying it around the saddle and back to himself snugly and made sure all the packs were secure on the harness, especially the one with the package inside. “Ready,” he finally muttered, patting Sherlock's neck affectionately. The dragon chirruped then pumped his wings and they were clearing the tree tops, John immediately getting soaked in the storm. Sherlock quickly made his way above the clouds and up into the clear evening sky and chirruped in concern as John shook, flinging some of the water off of him. “I'm okay,” John reassured, zipping his coat up further against the cool wind now that he was soaked through. “Fly as long as you can, I'm fine here.” So Sherlock did, taking care to fly as smoothly as possible when John fell asleep across his back. He wanted to get them both back to camp as soon as possible so someone would be able to treat John's injuries.
John woke to a woman's shriek and a horrendous snarl and went flying out of bed. “Damn it Mrs. Hudson,” he snapped as he went flying down the stairs. The woman in question was cowering on the floor at the base of the door and Sherlock in full dragon form was in the middle of his living room, wings fully extended and teeth bared in a snarl.
“We don't have a lot of food with us, this was suppose to be a quick run,” John said softly, laughing when Sherlock rubbed so hard against him he almost fell over. The dragon snuffled at the stuff that John had pulled out, shoving the fire starter towards him then ambled out of the cave and took off. John looked at the fire starter, the egg, then back towards where the dragon had disappeared. “Well okay then.”
“I am not immortal John,” he hissed. “I can be killed, there's no guarantee of your protection.” John's whole face was flushed as Sherlock stared down at him and realized he'd gripped the sleeve of John's jacket tightly. “Please do not do this mission,” he pleaded, eyes softening.
John laid out the thin bedroll he'd brought under a large shady tree, smiling at Sherlock as he shifted and curled around him protectively. His huge head lay beside his own and John found himself tracing over the pebbled skin on his cheek. Sherlock purred, nuzzling in to the hand a moment, then flicked the blanket over John with a whip of his tail. John chuckled and wiggled in to a comfier position and tried to get some rest.
I was trying to figure out how to give my leg some extra support,” he explained, scratching the side of his head. His hair was getting shaggy, wisps of dirty blonde curling around his ears. Sherlock let out a sigh and slid back in to his human form, grabbing a jumpsuit from nearby and pulling it on up to his waist, tying the sleeves around his hips.
“You got quite the reception yesterday Watson,” Bowen smiled up at him. “You and Sherlock fly remarkably well together.” John smiled thinking of his dragon and worrying slightly about where he'd gotten off to.
“We had an incident last night,” John explained softly, still trying to tug away from Sherlock's hold. “I had to bandage him up and we must have fallen asleep here.” Sherlock finally let him go, curling in on himself and wrapping a wing around his body.
“His name's Sherlock,” John offered, standing at attention. “Just got him yesterday sir.” The general shooed the man that had grabbed Sherlock out of the room and circled the two slowly.
“I think so, what are you doing?” John asked, but Sherlock didn't answer only slid into his dragon form, nostrils flaring and eyes narrowing up at the sky. He pumped his wings a couple times making sure everything was in one piece then nuzzled against John gingerly. He took one last long look at the soldier then shot into the air, disappearing quickly. John tried not to hyperventilate as he tended to his leg. Sherlock was a more than capable dragon, he'd seen it himself at the camp that the man could hold his own. But now here he was, alone in the jungle, didn't know where the hell he was, with a very injured leg and a still injured shoulder. “Please come back,” he pleaded.
“Test passed,” the general chuckled. “Very well done.” John turned back to the general, Sherlock reluctant to let him out of the protection of his wing.
When they arrived at the base they were instructed to report to the warehouse so John headed that way, Sherlock striding beside him in his new harnesses. The dragon's head was high, obviously preening in his shiny new harness. The straps blended into his hide well, the leather bags filled with the supplies they'd need. The only thing that stood out about him was the big red cross across a leather chest piece. When they entered the warehouse there were other men there, dragons with similar red crosses on their chest pieces. He saw his friend Mike Stamford from college and waved hello. A yellow dragon was sitting beside him and looked nervous at their approach.
“Did you know that dragon?” he asked suddenly and Sherlock visibly flinched. The dragon made his way back to John, smoothing ointment over the wounds before he answered.
“Took out the whole group!” someone yelled, smacking him so hard on the back he almost went down. “Destroyed all of them!” Sherlock was making concerned chirrups behind him, growling at men that were trying to pat him in congratulations too. “Never saw anything like it!” John smiled awkwardly, trying to make his way out of the group and towards his tent until finally Sherlock shoved through the group grabbing John by the back of his vest and lifting him away from the grasping hands. John flushed as men started laughing but was pretty happy about getting away. When they were near the tent Sherlock let John down gently, pushing him again.
John tried to get some rest, he really did, but he woke frequently, usually from nightmares and his hand sought out the dragon without realizing it. Sherlock was always there, pressing in to his reaching hand and chirping worriedly until John calmed. The dragon hadn't slept at all he realized when they went to relieve Bowen and Lestrade.
“It's all right Sherlock,” John cooed. “Do you wanna leave this place? Go on an adventure?” The dragon's spiky ears lifted, looking alert and the lightning trickled to a stop. “You have to go in this box, but I promise you no more drugs and no more cage after that. You're going to live with me and we're going to go on an adventure.” Behind him he could hear a few of the men chuckling which had Sherlock glaring in their direction again. Haughtily he got to his feet, wings tucking against his side and tail swaying and moved smoothly into the box waiting for him. He curled up like a great big cat and for all intents and purposes went to sleep. The man with the missing teeth silently shut the big cage door and John turned to see everyone staring at him in disbelief. “Shall we fill out that paperwork then?” he asked, stepping out of the cage and past the handlers.
“Easy,” John soothed, tucking the egg in to his pack and slinging it across his back. “Let's get out of here first.” Sherlock nodded slightly, crouching so John could climb up then took off towards the way they'd been instructed to leave. As they entered the hall that was suppose to be their escape route they ran in to a group of guards all brandishing swords. Sherlock let out a shriek, lightning crackling over his scales and making John's hair stand up. “Sherlock....” John said uneasily, but the dragon was past reason. A lightning blast sent half the guards flying and Sherlock dove in to the rest of them fervently, tail whipping and jaws snapping. One of their swords hit Sherlock's shoulder incredibly close to John's leg and in a second the guard was dead, hanging limp from the dragon's jaws. “Sherlock!” John cried out. “Let's go!” Ahead of them he could see flames licking the walls and the area was filling with smoke. John hazarded a glance back and could see flames in the direction of the lab too. Sherlock must have noticed the flame because he let out a shriek, knocking the remaining guards over with a swing of his tail and taking off again. John clung as hard as he could, body flat against the dragon's as they sprinted toward the doors that were engulfed in flame. Sherlock roared and John almost was jarred off as the dragon slammed in to the flaming doors, sending them flying open. Sherlock barely slowed, exiting in to the fresh air and wings extending beside John. “Wait...Sherlock!” John cried out, but the dragon launched in to the air and he had to wrap his arms completely around Sherlock's neck to stay on. The dragon got to a decent height and flapped listlessly, looking down at the flaming facility. John sat up a little to look too, worried about Bowen and Lestrade. Sherlock narrowed his eyes at something and John tried to follow his gaze but the dragon turned and headed back toward the rendezvous point.
You’re a trauma doctor who is teaching, not a very exciting work if you trained to take care of accidents. You have a psychosomatic limp and probably ptsd. You’re clearly military, it shows in the way you conduct yourself and the order you keep on your things. You have a poppy on your bag and it’s not season for wearing them. So where do a army doctor get ptsd at this time? Iraq or Afghanistan? John reluctantly admitted he was impressed. He sat quiet for a moment, wondering what he would say.
Those feelings you talked about yesterday, John started, swearing to himself because he was so bad at talking about feelings. Sherlock didn’t help him. He just stood there motionless.
- Oh god, he said as Sherlock put John’s erection into his mouth. He almost came from the sensation alone. His fingers grabbed the side of the chair and held tight. He could feel his orgasm building up fast.
"John Watson" John said and opened the door to his office. He wondered what had prompted this man to seek him out, he clearly didn’t want to be there.
Afghanistan, he said finally. Sherlock smirked. He leaned back in the chair, his hands behind his neck. The buttons in his shirt straining. Once again, John thought that Sherlock was good at flirting. If this wasn’t flirting he didn’t know what was, and it was working. He forced himself to look away and met Sherlock’s eyes instead.
- That was amazing. Sherlock chuckled as he sat down, wiping his mouth. He tried to untangle his legs to get his trousers and pants of in a not so gracious move. In one way it made John feel even more affectionate. This was a Sherlock only he could see, sitting dishelmed and almost naked in his kitchen floor.
- Well, I’m making lunch. He said, standing up. He didn’t bother asking Sherlock if he wanted. His experience said that if Sherlock had a choice he would say no. But if John just put food in front of him he would usually eat. And then there was always icecream. Sherlock never said no to ice cream, no matter how wrapped up in a case he was. One time they had been on a stakeout for several days, and Sherlock refused to take time off to eat. So John had gone to the nearest tescos and bought a pair of halfpints of ice cream and a couple of spoons. Then they had been sitting behind a dumpster eating ice cream. John made two tuna sandwiches and went back to Sherlock. To John's surprise, Sherlock reached for the sandwich. When he gave it to Sherlock he accidentally brushed against Sherlock's fingers. When they touched an electric bolt shot out from John's fingers throughout his body. He quickly let go of the sandwich and sat down on the sofa, a bit further away from Sherlock than before. They ate in silence while Sherlock fast forward as soon as there was an empty screen. They both sat up straight when they saw Mr Bryce the older on the tv. The siblings had provided them with a photograph and he had an elaborate mustache that was easily recognized. Mr Bryce walked into the room, seemingly heading towards his box. About fifteen minutes later they could see him walking out of the room. As soon as Mr Bryce was out of the picture Sherlock was out of the sofa. He looked through the other dvds, putting another one in the player and sat down. The date on this surveillance photo was the same as the previous one but from a different angle. They couldn’t see more than a bit of Mr Bryce jacket at this angle. Sherlock rose again and found another dvd. This was yet another angle, here they could watch Mr Bryce walk past and then walk back a few minutes later. John felt a bit deflated. There was nothing special with Mr Bryce visit as far as he could se. And the angle was wrong so they couldn’t see what he was doing. John slumped in the sofa, putting his head against the back and closed his eyes. But Sherlock rose, standing in the sofa, then stepped over the back heading for the door.
Iraq or Afghanistan? John was sitting writing at his computer when he heard a voice from his open doorway. He looked up, Sherlock was leaning on the doorframe. John took a second to take in the beautiful human standing there. He had another one of those shirts who looked like they were made for him and his hair looked like he had been out in the wind, it fell in curls into his eyes. Those eyes he couldn’t pinpoint the colour of. Yesterday they had looked grey, now they looked green. John mentally shook his head, he had to stop this.
"Then you don’t know how it is to be an older sibling, you never get over the responsibilities. Especially when you have a brother like Sherlock. Pray, what did he do this time?" Against his own judgement, he seemed to lose it when dealing with either of the Mr Holmes, John answered.
“Mycroft estimated that it would take me two years to finish all of the cells. I hoped I would get done before that.” They sat in silence for a while. John finished with the bandages, Sherlock could hear him closing the first aid kit. John put one hand on his arm, resting it there for a bit before he stroked Sherlock’s arm down to his wrist. He checks Sherlock’s pulse again. Sherlock remains still, at a loss what to do.
- Do you think anyone in there did it? John asked before Sherlock had a chance to say anything. Sherlock shrugged
“You’re bleeding” he heard John say. He had walked to the doorway between the kitchen and hallway. Sherlock had a hard time looking at him, for once he could understand John’s urge to hit people. He ignored John, trying to remember if he knew anything about panic attacks. He was pretty sure it was what he had but he had no clue how to make it stop.
- Mr Holmes. She was still ignoring John, which was fine with him. That gave him time to sit and observe the people in the room. He felt a strong dislike towards Mrs Gordon, but he couldn’t put his finger on it. She reminded him of Harry.
- Then you have to listen carefully don’t you? That smile made John's heart skip a beat but he didn’t have time to dwell on that because miss Williams opened the door. John recognized her from the picture though several years had passed. She had quit a distinctive face. She let them into the apartment and into the livingroom. She shooed away a cat that was sleeping in the sofa and sat down. John took the armchair opposite while Sherlock remained standing.
- I think you want to see me miss Williams. He was buzzed in and John followed Sherlock into the elevator.
Well, do you want to do it again? He asked instead. Sherlock smiled, then he dropped to his knees. John stared, wondering what on earth Sherlock was thinking about. Blushing over the things he was thinking about when he saw Sherlock in his knees in front of him. His pulze that was already elevated started to race. His cock had started to grow hard and he willed it to stay down.
John had stepped away to get some peace and quiet, and to gather his thoughts. He had tried all evening to figure out if anyone of the guests had a motive to steal a rare stamp. But so many of the guest came off as fake to him so he wasn’t sure if they were just hiding ordinary things that everyone did, or if they hid a secret theft. And he had found it hard to concentrate with Sherlock playing the ever so attentive boyfriend. He couldn’t understand why it rubbed him the wrong way when Sherlock was holding his hand or calling him darling. After some time acclimatizing he had done the same. And also found that he and Sherlock was a perfect fake couple. Still, he was agitated and needed to get away from his partner. He walked around the house and leaned against the brick wall. Maybe he just had too much alcohol and too little sleep. If he could just stand there in the relative quietness for a couple of minutes, he would be fine. John could hear steps in the gravel and looked up. He could just se the silouette of Sherlock standing a few feet away, hands in his pockets.
- Yes Sherlock I lovelove you. John looked on as Sherlock took the two steps it took to close the gap between them. He had pulled his chair back and risen without thinking about it. Sherlock stepped even closer, laying one hand on John's back and the other one gripping the nap of his neck. John tried to remember how to breathe but he found it difficult. First Sherlock kissed him in the same way they had kissed a few times now. Then he moved away, just an inch.
“Either you show me or I come and look anyway.” Sherlock’s voice wasn’t more than a whisper. He was scared and angry and it made it hard to talk. John met his eyes, daring him to do anything. There weren’t many times Sherlock used his larger frame against John. He had felt it was polite to let John think he would win in a fight between them. Now he didn’t care. He took the two steps he needed to be up close with John and pried his arm away from his body. He pulled up John’s sweater with force. John tried to pull away but he was trapped between Sherlock and the counter and didn’t have much room to maneuver. When he had confirmed his fears Sherlock took John’s other arm and did the same on that one. Then he just stood there with John’s wrist in a firm grip. On both of his arms there were the telltale scars of someone who had tried to take his own life. John took advantage of Sherlock’s shock and pushed him hard in the chest. Sherlock stumbled back, still trying to process what he had seen. He tried frantically to find another reason for scars like that. Even if he could find another reason, he saw the truth in John’s face.
- John, if you’re not going to say “no” or “oh god, yes please more” then shut up. John realized that being bossed around like this by Sherlock was a big turn on so he did shut up and focused on the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt. He kissed Sherlock’s chest and grinned with satisfaction when Sherlock gasped for air. He didn’t have time to savour the feeling for soon Sherlock was pushing him down onto the kitchen chair. At the same time we was working at the fly on John's trousers, pulling them down. John could feel his pants going the same way. Sherlock fell down on his knees pushing John’s legs apart so he could get closer. It took a moment for John to realise what Sherlock was about to do.
“Jesus christ Sherlock, that was…” He shook his head and pulled his hands through his hair. Sherlock thought it must be a new habit.
When John came home from his morning run he found a rather nervous looking man being ushered from 221B by Sherlock. The man was well dressed in a tailored suit and silk tie. But the suit was wrinkled and the tie has a stain. It looked like he had lived in the clothes for several days. The man himself looked like he hadn’t slept for days. He stepped out on the pavement and turned to face Sherlock who was about to close the door.
You have nothing to apologize for, this is all on me, he said, his voice straining from guilt rising in his throat.
- Maybe I’ve practices. Sherlock pocketed his phone and raised and hand to hail a cab, his cheeks slightly pink. They spent the drive home in silence.
John’s office wasn’t quite like the other staffs. His desk had been standing in the middle of the room with the back towards the windows when John got the room. He had quickly moved it so he was sitting with his back against the wall instead. He knew he was being silly, noone was going to attack him through the window. But this was the only way he could concentrate. Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. He walked in and stopped in front of the desk, fidgeting with his backpack. John sat down, thinking that it might make Mr Holmes more at ease.
“Sherlock…” John’s voice was barely a whisper. Still, his voice made Sherlock feel at ease, at home.
“I.. “Sherlock tried but failed. That his body didn’t obey his mind made him even more stressed. He never lost control like this.
“What’s this?” John asked. Sherlock shrugged, not really listening. He had seen something on John’s arm and now he tried to understand what he had seen.
Okay, so what did he want? He said casually and tried to put food in his mouth to feign indifference.
- Honestly Sherlock, I don’t know. Sherlock went out into the kitchen and sat down at his microscope. John took that as a sign that the conversation was over. He didn’t see from his vantage point if there even was a slide under the lens but he recognized Sherlock’s “leave me alone” pose well enough. He looked down at his book, knowing he would not be able to read more tonight. He went for the door instead.
Sorry, he said, clenched his hands at his sides. He could still feel Sherlock’s skin under his fingers, he ached to touch him again. All his resolution was gone.
You don’t need to call me Mr Holmes, Sherlock said almost at once. John was surprised, Sherlock usually didn’t speak at all when he was in John’s office. And if he did it was usually because John had asked him a question.
“Well… What?” John looked utterly confused. Sherlock took some comfort in that he didn’t look appalled.
- When people say forget it, it usually means they won’t, Sherlock started but John couldn’t take it anymore
So a former drug addict stole body parts with my card and I’m supposed to let you stay on the course because otherwise a lower worker in the government will put pictures of children doing god knows what on my computer? John could see the corners of Sherlock’s mouth twitch in a suppressed smile.
“If you don’t breath for me soon, you won’t be here so please try.” John stroke his hands slowly up and down over Sherlocks upper arms. Sherlock found that he could synk his breathing to John’s movements. It helped him to calm his breathing down and he was actually able to take a real breath. His vision was coming back to him and his heart wasn’t racing as hard.
Are you sure about this? He asked into Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock straightened up, looking John’s in the eyes.
A week passed, John had to drag himself out of bed in the mornings. Force himself to attend his lectures and not just hide in his office. Even though his office was only marginally better to be in than to be in the lecturehall. Sherlock was attending every lecture, not looking at John at all, but still being a clear presence in John’s mind. It felt like torture seeing him there and not being able to talk to him. He fled to his office as soon as he got the change, not wanting to run into Sherlock on the grounds. But his office held the memories of Sherlock. He had rearranged John’s bookcase in his liking and John hadn’t the heart to change it back. Even though he thought of Sherlock every time he glanced up from his computer and saw it. If he closed his eyes, he could see Sherlock standing in the doorway or sitting in the chair opposite John’s. It was a relief when the day ended and he could go home. It was the friday on the second week since the attack (the word John used for the incident) when John heard a knock on his doorframe. He looked up, feeling himself go cold and hot the same time as he saw Sherlock stand in the doorway.
Do you love me? He asked, John nodded. His throat had swollen up again due to all the things he wanted to say. It was crazy talking about love after this short time, but he was sure.
“You’re not listening, I didn’t want the consequences your knowledge would give.” John sighed. He leaned forward, put his elbows on his knees and rested his head in his hands. He didn’t say anything for a while. His silence unnerved Sherlock a bit. He felt a great urge to fill the silence.
This bit, whatever you call it, Sherlock waved his hands round in the air. John sat back on his legs looking at Sherlock.
“Sherlock, wait. What are we doing?” Sherlock met John’s eyes. His pupils were dilated making his eyes look darker.
“But you know what” John said and leaned back, not waiting for an answer. Sherlock wasn’t sure he could have gotten one out if he had tried.
- Thanks, I took your favourite. Question answered John thought while he put his jacket on. Sherlock did the same and they went out in silence. The silence stretched as they walked down the street. John tried to find something to say but his mind was blank. Sherlock seemed just as lost for words, or maybe he was calm with the silence.
- John! Could be heard down the hall. John said some excuses and half walked, half ran after Sherlock. He had seen that look on Sherlock's face before and he knew it was likely Sherlock went without him if he didn’t hurry. Sherlock was already waving down a cab and getting in when John exited the house.
- We are as sure as we can be that our father places this stamp with his others. Sherlock leaned back in his chair again, he met John’s eyes. He looked pleased, not a very appropriate feeling. John had never collected anything, more than football cards when he was young. But he guessed that the stamp was worth more money than he would ever se.
- Interested in coming with? He asked. John just laughed and followed. He didn’t want to fill Sherlock’s ego anymore by saying he would follow the man to the moon if Sherlock asked.
Sherlock started to walk towards John, he felt that he suddenly had trouble breathing. He could feel his heart in his throat as Sherlock leaned into him, placing his hands on John’s armrests. Then Sherlock’s lips touched his. It had been a long time since John had kissed anyone, but that didn’t explain the rush of emotion that flooded his system. His mind went blank, the only thing he could think about was how right this felt. It didn’t feel strange at all, not even that awkward like first kisses usually did. The kiss deepened, John lightly pressed his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth who opened his lips willingly. He was still standing bent over John and he ended the kiss too soon in John’s liking. Sherlock leaned back, sitting on John’s desk.
- I haven’t. I don’t see why I should sit and do Smalltalk with a stranger just so we might have sex afterwards. John could see Sherlock’s logic, but it raised more questions.
You’re too short, my neck hurts. This makes us more level, Sherlock said as he pressed himself in between John’s legs.
