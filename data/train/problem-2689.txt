They devote themselves to new routines. Cas comes back online early in the morning. He disentangles himself from Dean’s octopus grip and goes downstairs to flick on the coffee maker. Folding lawn chairs awaits them in the front yard. Soon Dean will get around to fixing the porch, but Cas is in no hurry. The sun will come up either way.
"Claire. I'm so sorry. Taking your father as my vessel is still the biggest regret of my life. But-"
this time?” Dean signs pizza by miming a piece of pizza coming to his mouth, with thumb facing up. Like Cas showed him.
Alex comes back and hooks everything up. Claire drinks some more juice and flicks through her phone. Looking for the pictures she originally wanted to show Cas.
Apparently that was the line to cross but Sam persists. “I don’t care if it is. Look around you man!”
After the fairway lights came on, they reconnected and found a grassy spot on a slope, away from foot traffic. Eileen, never one to be outdone, had won Sam three giant stuffed animals. They all use one for a pillow to look up and watch the ferris wheel and other towering machinery glow.
“I agree with Dean, I want sausage on my pizza!” Eileen makes a sign like she’s squeezing someone in a shoulder massage.
“If I agree to this, you have to promise me that you’ll let me reap the Winchesters too. If they perish in the process.”
She's getting choked up. She takes a drink of juice so she can continue on. "I was twelve. But I loved him, and I missed him because he was my dad. I never even got to know him though. For all I know he could have been terrible.” She wipes her face with her sleeve. “You're not my father, like you told me then. And I didn't get it at first, but you do give a shit about me for some reason. Enough to help me, enough to give me a gift on my birthday. I want to know you."
in the middle of a global pandemic and somehow managing to make his business run. Castiel has sat in their house for the past eighteen months writing inane blog posts and occasionally growing vegetables while Dean has been
“I'm not expecting you to have your whole life together, Dean. I'm hardly an advert for stability, or you wouldn’t have driven to Yale in the first place.”
, with this paralyzing shame, with him far enough in my head that I believe I’m too broken to be fixed.”
“‘Bout any of this,” Dean says, “Cuddling in bed listening to this. Don’t want him getting the wrong idea.”
“Why have you done this yourself, Dean?” Sam asks, “No one cares who the hell you want to sleep with, okay, or date. I don't care, Charlie doesn't care and you know what - Bobby wouldn't care, Ellen wouldn't care, your staff wouldn't care. And Dad -”
“You always look good,” Castiel said, without looking at him. “You’re not,” he began, paused. “You’re not
“Because, Gabriel, I ran into Dean Winchester an hour before our third date and for reasons unbeknownst to me I decided to explain why I was distracted.”
, he feels like crap. On the hangover scale, it scores an 8.0 and he’s pretty sure he’s not moving any time soon. It’s been at least half an hour since he last threw up, but that’s only because there’s nothing left in him but pain and misery.
Just after one AM, he gives the whole thing up as a bad job, trudges downstairs and puts on the TV for something to block out the noise in his head. Bobby shows up a couple of minutes later in a dressing gown that would be funny on a better day and says ‘so what are we watching?’ with a hand clapped on his shoulder.
“It was your third week of school,” The guy says, “It was a very unwise strategy, given her popularity.”
for fitting the rest of his life in the gaps just yet and because Cas is all kinds of interested about his restaurant and because Dean doesn’t really feel like saying
is a blog post you should encourage him to write,” Charlie says, drinking a mouthful of coffee before setting down her mug and looking at him. “So, I guess I owe you an apology.”
“I’m here, Sam,” Dean says, before he can reach the doorway of the kitchen, “Not saying I’m in good shape, or whatever, but I’m not trying to leave. I wanna work this out. It’s just… gonna take time.”
“I’m serious,” Dean says, “It’s a whole thing. They send this hyper formal weird-ass emails about how their weeks going, but uh… yeah, that’s - complicated. Pretty sure Cas can’t work out whether he hates the guy and at the same time he doesn’t want to…  miss his chance.”
the one that Cas looks up to and idolises in almost all things, from her art to her even temperament. She’s conflict-averse, quietly-passionate and the centre point their whole damn family orbit around. Anna not being able to make it to the official Milton Thanksgiving is the reason why this whole fake Thanksgiving was sparked off in the first place. Dean meeting the rest of them was just a fringe benefits and a way to prevent Cas having to leave town the one part of the Thanksgiving week he wasn't (supposed to be) working.
with as much bite as Dean’s ever heard him address his brother with. They’re all fucking ridiculous, obviously, but it’s… nice. “You’re going to fit in just fine, Dean.”
Castiel turns up halfway through their first episode, letting himself in with Dean’s key and pausing in the doorway to the room. It probably would have been easier for Dean to fess-up to having gotten an extra key cut earlier, given that the logistics meant that Cas wound up late for Meg as he had to wait for Dean to get back from work to let Dean in and take the key and Dean had to change his dinner with Sam to be dinner

“Join the club,” Dean smiles, looking back down at his two empty mugs of coffee for a few moments. It is worth noting that they are still holding hands. “I don’t,” Dean begins again, voice lower. He sounds much more like the Dean that used to stay on the phone with him for hours from thousands of miles away than any Dean he’s seen in person, but they are all the
“Fuck,” Dean exhales and, shit, it feels like something sharp and painful has been dislodged from his throat. He kind of wants to laugh, even though it’s completely inappropriate, but --
Castiel hides his face in Dean's neck and finds himself laughing despite of himself as Dean works his way through all of it, because… Castiel is ridiculous, and Dean sweet and kind and has wondered whether Castiel wants children. He says things like ‘big gay date’ out loud without freaking out, these days, and he rests a hand on Castiel's back as he gently mocks him for all his impulse purchase, and he is most definitely the love of Castiel’s life.
“Then you have to be very clear,” Nora says, “Castiel, if he’s accidentally hurting you and doesn’t know about it, then he still doesn’t have the power of choice.  Dean seems like a tough cookie to me.”
to be free from the Daphne-shaped shadow that has persistently been everywhere for these past few weeks. “I am in love with Meg. Now, I need to leave.”
Cas has one of those) then starts heading towards the staff room, with a glance back at Dean to ensure he’s following.
The weekend that they had the Miltons family home to themselves. They were still collecting firsts then, and that weekend was the first time that Dean bottomed. It was the weekend that Castiel told him that he wanted a wordless break up, if the breakup had to happen, and he learnt later that it was the weekend Dean nearly said he loved him.

“Yeah,” Emma says, with a kind of deliberate patience that would irritate him on a worse day, because he’s just trying to get it straight in his damn head. The plan. “Is it nice having Sam here?” She asks, loading the dishwasher.
“Allright,” Cas says and, of fucking course, his ball bounces directly into the front cup. Being the perfect, sarcastic little shit that he’s always been, Cas practically

Yeah, Dean worked out the easiest way to slide into a new school, to get people to like him, to be popular enough that he could get away with stuff and not so notorious that there were two many eyes on him. He hasn’t really ever struggled for dates, but that’s a damn sight different to a damn
“Yes,” Cas says, setting the flask of coffee on the roof of the impala to lean forwards and kiss him. His hands are hot from the heat of the coffee bleeding through the mug and it’s fucking perfect enough that he almost calls the whole weekend off.
“Hello, Hannah,” Cas says, “Dean and I are driving in the direction of the Beach House, and want to stay the night… no, we are not intending to elope. Yes, I am very sure…. Hannah.

“Think I can probably handle pie supervision from here, anyway,” Dean says, “And I’ve got an erotic pie-fantasy to talk your little brother into, so we’ll let you get back to… whatever it is that you’re doing with your day.”
“I’ve been telling you this,” Cas says, earnest enough that he just has to reach out to cover the gap between their deckchairs and hold his hand.

“You two gonna stop bickering like an old married couple and play your damn cards?” Bobby interjects,  eye roll on cue, as he glances back down at his cards. He’s got a crappy hand and Dean can read it all over his face, because if Bobby can read that he likes muscles and stubble about the same time that
Jess blinks rapidly, like she wasn’t expecting him to agree, or for any of this to go remotely smoothly. He’s not about to raise his voice at Sam’s freaking girlfriend, which is a good of a reason as any for Jess the one to steer this ship right this second. He doesn’t have to like it, but he can’t deny there’s sense to it.
“Your arms are very pleasing,” Cas says, smoothing his fingers over his bicep and not-blinking at him, all blue stares and fucking
“Dean. I just don’t want this to get messed up because of this stuff. It’s okay if you can’t talk to Cas. I get that and it’s ... totally understandable. I just really think he should know what’s happening.”
“My serious fucking girlfriend dumped me because I was still in love with you, and as it turns out you had your own shit going on with Meg.”
“No,” Dean says, looking away from her and glancing down at his hands. A part of him wants to protest that it was
“I’m glad you didn’t come to the wedding,” Cas says, even though it doesn’t make a lick of sense. Cas was angry about that for years and, rightly so, because Dean

and channels it into pulling Dean to their bedroom and closeness and affection and love, instead, till he’s a little unclear about which of them this was supposed to help.
That’s what this is about. A fucking wedding. It doesn’t feel great. It does feel like he’s betraying Mary, but logically Dean gets that’s not exactly fair,  and… a wedding, he can deal with that. It’s not the reason he’d have picked for him showing up, but it could definitely be worse.
have a tendency to run away in misguided attempts at protecting himself, his own survival instincts kicking in much too late. He has hurt Dean
"Donna, they're not going to start without us." She gets all her things sorted while standing on the landing. Looks up. "Hey girls!"
He fills a bag with bottled water and pop and whatever snacks seem most appealing. The bananas near the counter are turning a bit overripe but there’s a couple apples with intact skin and no bruises. The space is uncanny with its perfectly sorted shelves catching the sunlight and no one around to see them but him. It hasn’t been long enough for things to get dusty or faded. It very much looks like someone called cut and cleared the set.
Everyone starts laughing again. They stay late into the night until they feel safe to drive back to the bunker. Cas offers the fold out, but they want to get back so they can have breakfast with the girls in the morning. Cas wonders if all humans hug as much as the ones he knows. He hopes so.
Dean did not throw up, but he also didn’t want to go on any more rides. He took Cas to the agricultural hall instead and they looked at the cute names the kids gave their 4H cows.
There is a rustling and the sound of chairs scraping from the other room. Cas looks up in time to see Sam and Dean hugging. There are single tear tracks on both their faces. Dean has grabbed Sam who has a huff squeezed out of him and starts laughing.
"You do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting. You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.”
Sam wakes up late. They’ve been busy with the move and Sam is exhausted. He pads down the hall, looking into the kitchen to see Dean sitting at the table. His hair is mussed with more than just bedhead, he is staring out the window, and midway up his neck is a wine dark hickey.
The sunrise will be perfect in five minutes. He can wait that long to drag Dean back to bed. He sips coffee and listens to the birds, and telegraphs his own want and longing across the three feet of lawn between them for several agonizing moments.
Midway home Dean rolled the window down and vomits. Without taking his eyes off the road, Cas had disappointedly handed Sam his money back.
Dean is standing at the bar with an untouched glass in his hand. Half eaten food is scattered all around them. Tipped over bottles have dripped beer on the carpet and the whole place reeks of it. A football game doesn’t play on the TV.
Every time he thinks it, he feels lighter. He carries that one thought for what feels like days. It may be minutes or years later when he tries to speak.
“Is that me? Meg has disentangled herself from her angel companions. “Cas, I know we’re busy, but can we take a moment to psychoanalyze why this thing looks like me directly after we had our one and only make out session?”
Anna looks at him like she had looked at the grace tree. Something familiar yet unknown. The common and the holy. They are siblings. They had gone from similar to dissimilar, then around and back again. Both had been commanded by their father to love humanity and both had fallen for it.
"Busy. There's always something going on here.” She plops down in a chair next to him. “Did Sam tell you we found a dragon the other day? Like a real live dragon." Her eyes sparkle with excitement. "She's an art collector. She wants to come check out some old paintings Kaia found in a store room." She pulls out her phone to show him pictures of the paintings.
"This is just to say. I have eaten the plums-" he slips pauses in between the words “-that were in the icebox.” breathes the beats “and which you were probably saving for breakfast.” puts emotions in the absence between words “Forgive me. They were delicious. So sweet, and so cold.”
Dean looks small, leaning against the banister of the staircase. His robe hangs open to show his bare lower legs, somehow making him more vulnerable.
Jack continues. “I’m not really leaving. I’ll always be as close as this.” he taps his chest with two fingers.”
As his breathing changes, Cas opens his book and starts to read. The room is quiet and Dean is still. He wakes with a gasp once, following the light to where Cas is sitting, looks at him for a moment as his breathing slows, and puts his head back down. He sleeps peacefully without dreaming the rest of the night.
The pages whisper over one another, blankets get adjusted, Cas clears his throat even though there’s no need to.
Dean sits quietly for a moment. Clenches and unclenches his hands. Continues looking in a way that another human might find uncomfortable. Cas doesn’t.
He absentmindedly twists his phone in his hands. Dean watches him. Thinking that those things sounded familiar.
A few bags of heart healthy trail mix, beef jerky, and a candy bar round off their road meal. He unlocks the back door and steps through. Jack is standing next to one of the produce stands holding a cabbage that has dried up. The others on the cart are withered as well. He seems deep in thought. Jack turns to look at him, tosses the cabbage back on the pile.
Cas’ hand leaves a bloody handprint on his shoulder, the mirror of the handprint he left on Dean’s arm when he pulled him from hell. Dragging him back kicking, and gouging, and brawling to get free.
Jack can feel their misery before they even get inside. Their plan hasn't worked. He lays with his head at the foot of the bed and listens to the brothers move around. They stay in the library for a while. Their voices angry, but too soft to overhear. Could he have done something if he had his powers? The sadness and fear from the other room is overwhelming. He feigns sleep in case someone opens the door. The sound of Dean pacing and Sam’s voice growing softer and more seldom puts him under. In half sleep he relaxes. He dreams that everyone is back and they’re together in the bunker.
Maybe Meg looks shocked for a second but she moves on quickly, always ready to roll with the next new thing. “So God is around? I think I lost a bet somewhere. What’s he up to?”
He faces Jack in the back seat where he’s tucked in amongst the plastic bags from the gas station and Sam’s shrugged off coat. Talks about what he felt and if there might be anyone else left out there. The two talk in low voices to one another for a few hours, the thread of conversation stretching out through the evening. They’re both tense and tired with their autonomaton driver but find a slight comfort between them too. Eventually Jack puts his head against the window and at least pretends to be asleep. His tired mind pinging Cas unintentionally.
Sam is running things that day. Eileen met them there, and is sitting next to him with her feet up on the table laughing at something. Sam is invaluable at directing even if being the leader still feels like something he will never get used to. He has his laptop set up and keeps everything organized in spreadsheets. Sorted by name, blood type, purpose of blood usage, and if they tended to be a fainter.
Although Claire has seemed to forgive him, Cas knows it will take many more meals and talks to be on decent footing. He enjoys the time she allows them to spend together. He also enjoys her hustling Dean at cards if he is being honest with himself. It will take time. All they have now is time.
It takes him a minute to decode the Charlie-ness of the whole sentence and another few seconds to filter through how apt that is for his whole goddamn day. He has been fucking
Cas looks a little better when he appears from the stack of boxes in what's going to be the dinning room when they get that far, if a little ruffled.
Cas watches this bittersweet thing come to an end. Watches from somewhere outside his body as Sam and Dean say their goodbyes, feels tears slip down his face unbidden. Jack puts his hand on Cas’ jacket sleeve and everything comes back into focus. Cas holds him, resting his chin on the top of his head.
Donna sets down her wine glass a little over eagerly. “Except Sheriff lead foot forgot about her own speed trap and got us pulled over.”
Sam’s not about to let these two dance around each other for another decade. Or possibly more. With his luck he’ll live another hundred years, and when he dies they’ll make goo goo eyes over his fucking casket.
"That would be good. Sam can help too. He's always at the bunker, about time he pulled his weight around here." He smiles absently, imagining.
Sam comes in one morning, a week later, after staying the night at Eileen's. Dean and Cas are sitting on the couch, Cas with his legs over Dean's lap. They're sharing a cup of coffee while Dean scrolls on his phone and drags his thumb over the bottom of Cas' foot over and over.
Dean takes it. "Oh. I wrote a bunch of poems in here. Some of the ones you read me. Ones I really liked." He feels lame telling Cas about it but he goes on. "Sometimes I reread them to relax. When...if you're not here." His face feels like the surface of the sun.
He feels Cas press his leg up against him. It’s comforting and grounding. He turns his attention back to whatever they’re talking about.
They land back in the tree line. Sam has wedged himself against a rock with Dean an arm’s length away from him. He’s well enough to be conscious and looking around, although he does have a pretty sizable branch sticking through his leg. He might be in shock. He’s reaching out to Dean, his hand meeting his brother’s in the dirt.
Heaven is big enough, it's eternal enough. All the souls will just have to work out their conflicts in time. Jack will be busy, but he seems to take well to his new role. Maybe the paradise Cas saw before his birth was this.
In the night Dean reaches out to the space where Cas’ body had been. Finding it empty, he wakes. “Cas?” He sits up in bed, sleep groggy. “Come back to bed.”
“Hey, Cas. How are the tomatoes doing?” Sam slides the box across the counter into Dean’s waiting hands.
The thought slips in and out of his head along with every movie, book, roadtrip, and food he wants to share with Cas. He’s going to stay. He just led an army from the darkness of the Empty to heaven, killed God, and gave the afterlife a holy reset. All for Dean. He’s going to stay.
It sounds like Jack, but it can’t be. He’s made a deal. The final deal. Jack is supposed to have a life. They all are. Cas looks after the voice. Looking at the Shadow in the shape of his adopted son is extra painful, having recently been gutpunched by very strong emotions.
"I was going to take the old stove to the recycling center next town over tomorrow. D'you wanna come?" Dean was hoping he would at least help him load the thing in the truck. It seemed to weigh a million pounds.
"Mmm. Human, huh?" Half foggy with impending sleep, Dean interjects. "I like it. The plums are good, he doesn't regret enjoying them but he's sorry anyway."
Sam is crying. He reaches his long arms out and wraps Jack in a huge hug. “Bye, Jack.” He releases him so Dean can step up and give him the same treatment.
And Dean? Dean is a mess. The idea of Cas riding shotgun in his body and looking at his thoughts? No. He clamps down hard on that. The idea that, if their plan fails, he could be stuck in an endless body sharing episode until he dies and Cas wears his husk around? Hard pass. Time for plan Z.
Of course, they have questions. A noble and wonderful thing. Except he’s already been here for a very long time and he would really like to get out. The Empty, as the Winchesters would say, “sucks ass”. He takes some time to get these reanimated beings up to speed. He has come up with something of a plan. The spell should work, he trusts Jack and the Winchesters to be able to handle it. Now he needs to figure out how to kill God.
He doesn’t know if these prayers, like most, will go unanswered. After a moment he wipes his tears and stands from the planter. He doesn’t notice the flowers wilting in tired bunches behind him as he goes to join the brothers. Their voices drifting out through the open door are the only familiar things left on earth.
Yes, I listen to and love the farm report on my local radio station. Shout out to Pam Jahnke, keep up the good work.
“Dean, he doesn’t need to eat but he does! Whenever you make something, he does.” Sam rubs his face. “He lives in the house with us. And even if you never say anything about it, and it's not by business so please don’t, I noticed he’s not pretending to sleep on the couch anymore.”
The chair stays in it's new spot. The bed gets pushed just slightly more to the right to make room, the tv tray is replaced by a small table with a side basket for books or magazines. A new ritual begins. They talk more and Dean shows more videos on his phone. They play Dean's records, or he pulls up things on his laptop to show Cas. Plans for repairs to the house, or other project blueprints. When it gets late and he's too tired to talk, Dean will watch things quietly by himself. Cas can hear the scrape of metal from one of the restoration videos he tends to favor, but he can also feel Dean looking at him.
Cas sits for a moment and watches Claire drink her juice. Her makeup is smudged from where she wiped her tears. Otherwise her face is unmarred by the cuts or bruising she had last time he had seen her. She’s healthy and whole. Alex comes by to start her blood donation process. She notices Claire's been crying and squeezes her hand before turning to do something else. It may not be the life she thought she would lead, but Claire is loved.
"Mhm. Glad I could help facilitate that, but I'm late for my date." Sam gets up and pulls on a pair of deep brown boots from the shoe rack.
In the afternoon he feels better. The washer has stopped so he hangs the clothes to dry in the breeze. Outside it has gone quiet again. Or the normal level of quiet. Birds sing from the trees, warning of the sun going down soon. Noises of feeding time drift from the neighbor’s farm. He throws the towels over the line and steps back inside. He tosses the remains of his earlier sandwich in the compost bucket and sets his mind on dinner.
Dean's busy making moon eyes at him and doesn't realize he's stopped talking. Or that he's holding Dean's poetry notebook.
In the next second Sam is there too, wrapping his arms around them both, followed by Jack. They stand there for a moment just breathing with each other.
He takes a few deep breaths. Grabs the blanket and tucks himself into bed. Punches the lumps out of his pillows. He rolls over on his side and stares at Cas' chair. He’s left a book on the seat.
“Over and over announcing your place in the family of things.” his voice dips soft and low as he finishes.
“Hello. Owen Olson, this is my wife Loren.” a short man with a big beer belly sticks his hand out to shake.
Dean’s propped on his right side, using his elbow to keep himself up while he chats about plans to finish clearing out the cellar. Maybe storing some firewood down there if it's dry enough.
“It really is the Winchester’s world and we’re just living, or in our case not living, in it. So you’re going to disrupt the whole afterlife for everyone so you can save Dean?”
“Yeah. I guess Chuck didn’t get everything.” Dean continues to the car, holding Miracle close to his body. “Maybe there’s people he missed, you know?” He can’t help but let some hope slip into his voice. “Either way, this guy’s coming home with us.”
Sam is fresh out of a post run shower. He’s putting his socks on with one hand and texting Eileen with the other. The socks have a cartoon beaver on them with a speech bubble saying ‘Wood you be so kind?’. Cas gave them to him.
On that Cas agrees. This place is wrong. It was meant to be restful, not oppressive. The whole thing was a narrative mess, the Shadow a cheap imitation of the creator god.
He thinks all of them are good. That's why he wrote them down. Half of them are ones that Cas has read to him so he’s already heard those. He flips through the pages, shaking his head. He stops. This one is perfect. He can do it. He can read this and finally say the thing that needs to be said. He smooths his hand over the page and begins.
“Luckily we had an old shirt somewhere, and a blanket in the back seat in case of blizzards. Jodio put on the shirt and you couldn’t tell if it was covering a pair of shorts or not, and I threw the blanket over me even though it must have been ninety that day.” Donna smiles at Jody and sips the wine.
Dean wonders how much blood they really need. Can he simply cut the tip off one of the fingerprints? Surely it will be enough. In case the spell fails, he can patch the hole after and not completely lose one of the last remaining things he has tied to Cas. But trying to decide which part suddenly felt to him as difficult as choosing one of his own fingers to hack off. He hands the whole jacket to Sam.
“We have-” Jesus, Cas. He thinks looking at a six pack, a pitcher of lemonade, a pitcher of iced tea, a bottle of wine, some kind of craft soda, and carbonated water that Dean thinks is the nastiest thing he’s ever put in his mouth.
But Cas is an angel and he still has a few things. He can think muted thoughts, if he tries very hard he can probably even speak softly. He still knows things. He starts putting out very small thoughts.
Jack has squared up, his eyes glowing aggressively gold. Light and energy is seeping out of him and coursing from his hands. He's inching closer to Chuck. Preparing to grab him.
He spends the rest of the afternoon enrapt in their conversation. They really have been busy. Claire is right, Kaia is smart, and thoughtful with questions, and kind. In the early evening he excuses himself to leave so he can help prepare for company later. Claire wraps him up in a big hug and Kaia does too. They look good together. He looks forward to seeing them again.
The goodnight is not customary but it is nice. The standing lamp has been swapped for a table lamp once the chair moved, it gives off a more intimate light. Cas exchanges the poems for a larger book about a failed arctic exploration. It seems long enough that it may take him more than one night to complete. He thinks Dean will probably like to read it when he’s finished.
Cas is speaking to everyone gathered around him. It reminds him of commanding a garrison. He tries not to think about it. He looks out on the faces, the trusting and the unsure.
Then there’s Cas. Pull his soul out of hell, fall from heaven (fall for him), kill his kith and kin for the Winchesters, Cas. So he’s in love. So what? What’s he supposed to do, tell him? That would be stupid. It would be reckless, and show way too much weakness. Admitting the reality of what enemies have always teased. Putting Cas in the same category as any of his other found family keeps him close but safe. After all that, what is love? A liability mostly. It's better to call him buddy, and his best friend, and give him just enough affection to keep him around.
The squash comes out of the oven, gets a dollop of stuffing and goes back in to form a crisp crust. The sound of the pickup truck comes rattling down the driveway, then the sound of Sam and Cas entering the utility room and putting away their shoes.
"Could be useful for any witches that come through." Sam rattles the silverware drawer, grabbing a handful of cutlery.
“I don’t know what that deputy thought when he saw us, but she let us go and never said anything about it when I saw her on Monday.”
Dean sits up with a gasp, looking around wildly. He's dropped Sam's hand, and has his arms out, to push away threats. His eyes dart between them. Finally relaxing when he realizes the danger has passed. He locks his eyes on Cas.
There it is. He's still alive. Cas is still alive, laying across from him with a beatific smile. His pupils look like super massive black holes. He's quiet.
“No.” He drops the one in his hand back on the pile and chooses another. "This one does though. Let me find something."
Cas reaches out to the divine. The simulated sun is making a halo of his hair. “Let’s go say goodbye.”
He extends another set to Cas with a questioning look. Cas doesn't have to eat but he is always welcome to. He takes the offered implements. Sam sits at the far end of the table. Dean uses tongs to place half a squash on each of their plates. He sets the tray on the counter, smiling to himself at the bee trivets that Cas had picked up somewhere. He takes a seat at the near end of the table, looking at Cas in the middle seat.
So far they had only done this in the safety of Dean's bedroom. Or maybe their bedroom now. The sun still shone, neither of them turned to dust or disappeared. Dean looks at Cas' face above him and thinks about kissing him like it was a romantic comedy. It isn't. He doesn't.
Dean yanks him in, nearly knocking the breath out of him in his need to have Cas in his arms. His eyes are prickling.
Drink is an easy to remember sign, one he practiced for this. She’s still grinning at him. In the kitchen he stands to one side of the refrigerator door so she can still see his mouth as he talks.
“Says the guy who ate more than half of the last one I brought home.” he puts the box down to make it easier to talk.
Dean has a hard time with it. He goes on long drives to nowhere in the impala, laying out on the hood to watch the stars. Practices guitar on the front porch for hours. Playing until his fingers are sore and cramped. He takes his pistols to the gun range in the bunker once but it doesn't feel right.
Cas focuses all of his force and power into destroying his father down to cells. Shoving him down and collapsing him like pressure making a diamond. He can feel when life finally flows out of him, and hopes Death will reap him and not allow return.
Destruction of the godhead sends out a wave of energy, felling trees and splitting rocks for a square mile. Cas uses everything he has to fly Dean’s prone body to Sam and Jack’s location seconds before the tranquil lake becomes a crater. He holds Dean close to him as he feels himself pass out.
He stays there until morning, when he finally answers the thirty-fourth call from Sam. But only because his phone is nearly as dead as he feels. He gets up, dusts off his pants, and goes to find any survivors. Later he can get blackout levels of drunk and probe the empty spot inside him like a sore tooth.
The sounds in the room narrow down to his heart beating and the air coming in and out of his lungs. This isn't his heart racing with panic either. He's already mostly said the thing. He might as well finish.
Tear after tear streams down Cas’ face. The sound of Billie banging her fist against the door grows louder. This is it.
After Sam turns in for the night, Cas follows Dean upstairs to bed. They take turns awkwardly putting on pajamas and brushing their teeth in the half bathroom at the top of the stairs. Dean clicks on the lamp and settles in against the headboard humming with a low level of anticipatory anxiety. Cas is still standing near the foot of the bed.
“I have no idea what you want me to do with this information. You’re literally a demon.” Cas replies blankly.
She gives his arm a pat. "I think we'll take you up on that." Seeing some kind of unmet need in the distance, she calls out. "Oh, let me help ya there!"
Dean lets go. He looks sad. He glances from Jack to Sam to Cas. Puts his guard up and speaks indifferently. “You leaving too Cas?”
Jack stands a few paces away. His hand is up in his signature wave. “Goodbye.” He flashes out of earthly existence.
"There wasn't. But...I have some of Cas' blood on my jacket." Dean doesn't know why he suddenly feels protective of it. "He uh, he drew a sigil and some of the blood got on me."
Dean plays music and sings along while he makes breakfast. Steam shoots out from the sides of the waffle maker. Sausage links sizzle in their pan. The coffee maker drips. The table is set with every conceivable waffle topping they could find.
Kisses his forehead “I love you.” His eyelids “I love you.” The tip of his nose “Love you.” His chin. “Love you, Cas.”
She's been busy getting things orderly even though the move isn't for two months. Cas sits on the floor of what was an office. They disassemble bookcases with few signs to each other, just requests for the allen wrench and thoughts about what to eat later. What Eileen will eat later anyway. Cas is putting some books away in boxes when Eileen taps him on the shoulder to get his attention.
Like a whisper. If he says anything else, it's lost as Jack disappears. Dropping Cas suddenly from his seat. He lays in the inky quiet. He wonders if he would dream if he was asleep. Dream of playing games with Jack, of protecting him and watching him grow. Dream of spending time with Sam talking and going over the more obscure lore, telling him about the history of stars and about the oldest trees left on earth, and how much he truly enjoys Sam’s company. Dream about Dean.
"I don't want you to watch me sleep, man. But maybe you could just...keep me company. Bring your book and hang out." He leans forward and taps his finger on the cover of the book Cas put down.
Dean looks into the living room and can imagine sitting in front of a nice TV with the wood stove in the back going hot and strong. Two armchairs lined up against the half wall between the living room and kitchen, a pull out couch opposite for guests. On the other side the kitchen was open with miles of counter space for every gadget and some left over for rolling out dough or laying out a huge cutting board.
“Alright. Well, one for the road.” Sam takes a quick step forward and punches Chuck. He pulls his hand back and tries to shake out the pain.
“Hello, Sam.” Cas greets him, plucking the mug from Dean’s hand and carrying it to his coffee corner for a fill.
As if reading his mind, Jack makes another comment. “I’ll visit you. Whenever I can. And I’ll hear your prayers.”
Cas draws out the syllables, lovingly enunciating every word. They’re beautiful and the next part is his favorite, the images of flying and coming home to rest.
“Heavens no! Just don’t forget to check for ticks when you get back.” She laughs easily, walking Sam back into the kitchen.
Jack knows what it felt like when his blood was used for this ritual before. It burned horribly like his own veins had turned against him. He was prepared to do it again. To bring back Cas.
She's not the first to ask. It still seems unusual for him to interact with people on his own. Dean makes excuses for staying out of the bunker. To cover up the fact he still just doesn't feel right being there anymore. Today he says he’s too busy picking up groceries and lumber. That he's bled enough for the cause anyway.
They look amused. “We did. I think I did quite well actually.” They smile wryly. “Don’t worry, everyone is still alive. I’m not the one in charge here.”
"I used to talk to Sam when it woke him up. His dreams are less complicated, when he has them. But he wears headphones now."
He does. Sees Cas’ magnets holding up pictures Dean took, and coupons for that restaurant Dean likes. Their shoes next to each other by the door, their books stacked and mingled on the bookcase. Thinks about Cas growing things in the garden and presenting them to Dean to cook. Cas bringing him a glass of water every night and holding him so he won’t have nightmares.
Dean mourns Cas the same way as always, by drinking. He passes out with a bottle for a pillow. Whiskey lullaby. That’s where Sam finds him in the morning. Coming in with his little stoneware cup of coffee, ready to dive into some reading. He sticks one of his bare feet out and nudges Dean’s body.
“I’m not sure. I was in bed, thinking of a way to bring all the people back.” He turns his palms up in a shrug. “Then I was here.”
“How did Chuck miss you?” He holds the dog’s head in his hands, its eyes are clear. “Who would have thought finding a dog would feel like a miracle?” He has an idea. “Come on, Miracle.” He helps the dog out of its spot, it seems friendly enough so he starts to carry it back to the car.
Her blonde hair is piled on her head with a pair of sunglasses sticking out, streaks of white in places. The Kansas weather is crawling toward fall but she still wears a high waisted pair of jeans shorts. She pulls Jody, still cramming a handful of items in her purse, behind her.
Cas has never brought him water before. He usually just gets water from the bathroom sink if he wakes up thirsty or hot. He feels hot now. He drinks half of it in two big gulps to cool off. He indicates the vacant side of the bed.
Something in his look tells Cas which he really prefers. He likes being close to Dean. He hasn't sat on Dean's bed with him since the bunker. They used to watch movies like that sometimes. This was different. Softer and more intimate. Both in their sleep clothes instead of layers. No flannel or trench coat between them. Cas likes this better.
"At lunchtime I bought a huge orange. The size of it made us all laugh. I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave. They got quarters and I had a half."
Last he stops in Sam's room. From the doorway it was neat enough. Stepping inside reveals papers all over the desk, an overflowing trash can, dirty jogging clothes flung in the direction of where they should go. Dean picks them up between his finger and thumb and sets them into the nearly full basket pressed into his hip. He carries it down the hall, through the kitchen, and into the back room that doubles as laundry space and storage for shoes and outdoor gear. He shakes everything into the ancient washer and throws a scoop of the fancy earth friendly ‘free and clear’ soap that Sam buys on top.
Across and beyond there’s a shed for storing road salt, an old railroad switch shack, some locked dumpsters. It's an empty place within an empty city. They’ve stopped here because Dean’s legs feel twitchy and he needs to move. He would have called on God right outside the bunker if he thought it was safe enough.
Later Cas sips coffee as Eileen eats potato pancakes and matzo ball soup at a late night deli. Eileen tells him about her plans to run an ASL class for beginners at the library with Sam. Cas tells her about the epic highs and lows of drip irrigation, and what the neighbor’s goats are up to. Their friendship is easy and honest.
He had loved Lisa too, at least a little bit. At least for a while. She had represented safety and normalcy. A wife and son in a cookie cutter neighborhood that Sam wanted him to have. What the story called for. There was Cassie as well. Cassie had been amazing, made him feel safe, and didn’t think he was totally crazy for the whole hunter thing. But Dean was too committed to the life to consider giving up hunting even for her.
He tries music. He tries watching Tombstone or Die Hard on his laptop. He cracks open his porn collection and tries to distract himself. It doesn't work. He pulls his hand out of his pants and tosses the magazine back in its box. He takes a shower instead. Puts on soft sleeping shorts and shirt. Texts Sam just to check in, and gets a thumbs up reply.
He can do that. Maybe not today, but he would try. Sam will be home soon. They let go of each other and go inside.
Cas rolls his eyes. He wishes briefly that they were all still asleep, him included, so he didn’t have to try to herd the most exasperating forces in existence to the light.
"It was a spell book. Like the one Lily Sunder had." He sits down at the table and starts folding the napkins Sam sets out.
He looks down at his own novelty socks which have a pan of frying bacon on them with the caption ‘Hot Stuff’
Billie will find and kill the Shadow. They will ascend to heaven, or shift depending on your view of metaphysical spaces. All the angels and demons will go with them, leaving the Empty just that. Once there, it’s easy to cause a distraction so Billie can slip to Earth unnoticed. Cas will take care of the actual killing, he just needs Death to be there in time.
Dean feels stupid when his face heats. Cas is an angel at full power, he’s kinda stuck on earth right now, but he can fly anywhere. Dean thinks of volcanoes, the bottom of the ocean, the moon. Cas is powerful enough to check out any of those places whenever he wants to.
So he does. He slots himself in beside Dean’s body. They both lay on their backs as they had during the movie. Cas has never been so aware of every inch of his skin before.
It was hot for June. All four of them are wearing shorts and have peeled back the layers to just t-shirts. Eileen and Cas walk in the front, having an animated conversation about whatever silly things their partners have done lately. Cas had just said ‘kissed...something something' and then 'too much’.
Jack says nothing. Sam reaches out and puts a hand on his shoulder. He wants to comfort Jack, he wants to comfort Dean. He lost someone too, a long time friend and ally, but it feels like he’s third wheeling on someone else’s grief whenever he looks at these two.
“You’ve been doing more of it anyway,” Dean says, grimacing at his hands. He’s aware he sounds like a petulant toddler, but he’s not
“Wait,” Dean says, reaching forward to adjust his hat, pulling it over the edge of Cas’ hairline so it aligns just so. He's close. Close enough that it would be easy to reach out and just fucking kiss him and Dean's pretty sure that Cas would kiss him back, too, because his gaze shifts to Dean's lips like a goddamn magnet, and he could have pulled away - put some distance between them - but he's in Dean's kitchen in chef whites, and Dean really, really wants him. His voice, his snarky blogs, his
“Okaay,” Charlie says, “Well, if we’re doing contextless truths about our sex lives, I didn’t get any last night either.”
“Think… Think I'm gonna lose him, Sammy. That I'm gonna fuck it all up,” Dean says, more honest than he’s ever been with Sam about Cas, ever, thanks to the eclectic mix of whiskey and feeling like he’s been totally steamrolled by freaking everything all at once. Sam going to college. Dean’s whole damn

The longer he sits in the car with the radio blaring with no eyes on him,  the longer he can pretend it’s not happening. It’s not necessarily productive, but it feels better.  She’s his baby, too, and she forgave him for abandoning her in that rusted up junkyard in Illinois a long time ago, after Sammy bought her home and he took her apart and cleaned and polished every inch of her.  She’s
“Good,” Sam says, and then Dean settles into talking through the various pros and cons of two to three bed properties for sale in a thirty mile radius of their current apartment for the next hour and a half of the journey, until he’s feeling alive enough to take over driving again.
, but it’s unnecessary. It’s bottle-necking in his veins because he wants to be closer, wants Cas, but he’s
“We talking about your Dad?” Dean asks. Cas looks smaller when he's crippled by indecision. He looks younger whenever he’s trying to work out how he feels about anything, like he should have done when he was eighteen and his father walking out was fresh. Instead, he buried it, selected the emotions he felt he should feel and decided to save Dean instead. It’s funny how that desire is probably what sunk them both, in the end.
“Just hate fuckin’ doctors spending five minutes half listening to me and boiling down something really goddamn complicated to a couple of shitty labels.”
“I'm good, Cas. I lost my buzz right around the time we started yelling,” Dean says, running a hand through his hair. “What the hell are we even fighting about?”
“Didn’t say that,” Dean says, setting aside the tequila and lime juice, “You just got some kind of hankering?”
, but he didn’t really understand it. He never had that at home, either, but Bobby has always been good at extending his gruff welcome to others.

“It was three nights,” Cas corrects and he’s leaning across the table too, “They were not my favourite.”
“That’s never actually been a problem,” Dean mutters, picking up his book again, trying to focus on the words and failing like a instagram chef and a souffle. But, getting
about it before. It all felt like so far out of the realms of possibility that was laughable and --- there’s a chance that it still is now, because neither of them are exactly poster boys for being fully functioning adults, but it’s ---
It’s not that he doesn’t think Cas would have been able to handle it, because he does. Cas has more than demonstrated that he has the patience and commitment to deal with Dean’s particular brand of baggage, it’s just that he’s not sure that Cas could see him how he sees him
parts of Dean’s vulnerability and heard enough of his story to be certain that the nightmares are bad.
“Okay,” Dean says, resigned, pushing the bottle away and standing up, with this restless energy that doesn’t fill Castiel with confidence.  “Let’s talk money.”

He can’t remember why he agreed to this in the first place, or exactly how he ended up on their list, but occasionally if something vaguely food related or hospitality related comes up they ask him to say things about his opinion, and then they turned this segment into a weekly discussion of the current guidelines and generally ask him to show up. Right now he’d rather be continuing to stare into space than to video call into a damn TV show to talk about the intersection between coronavirus and restaurants, but the first five minutes are relatively tolerable.

on his cell phone, to listen to on repeat forever. Sam wants him to call. He wants to talk. “Whatever, sorry for bothering you, man. I better head,”
“And you probably would've,” Dean says, “but it's complicated. Our whole damn history is complicated and it’s not… its not like those feelings just go away.”
“I get wanting to be fucking normal, but, dammit Sammy. You're my family. You’re the only family I've got and you're… you’re seventeen. You - you don't have to prove you can do it on your own, Sam, we get it. I know. I goddamn know, but
Sam is going to go to college and Dean probably isn’t invited, but it will be okay. It will be okay. Sam will probably still let Dean have Thanksgivings and Christmases and Spring Breaks and the summer, and he’ll… he’ll call him and text him. It’ll be
“I’ve got better aim,” Dean says, then flicks more water in his face. Cas looks fucking amazing, obviously, and the tension has bled away from his shoulders again. They can do this. It’s going to take some time, but they can definitely make this work.
He does get up a minute later, though, because there’s no point if Cas isn’t there. If he’s getting to spend the majority of his Saturday doing nothing, he’s sure as hell gonna do it with as much Cas time as he physically fit into the day.
“I think I’m heading to bed,” Cas says, after a while. Emma went half an hour back and Cas has just been watching them play for awhile, looking sleepy and affectionate.
“It’s not —— Dean, I haven’t… I haven’t forgiven him, I’m not even saying I want a relationship with him, I just… I have questions, Dean. About my life, about my childhood, about Mom. I … you were both gone,” Sam says, small. “And I kept remembering things and I had no one to check if they were real. To explain, and I —— I missed so much of what was going on with you, Dean, and I don’t…. I don’t want to never have a chance to understand.”
He’s not used to Inias voicing his opinion. He tends to be steady, secure and silent. For a moment, the words settle over the table, and then -
“Dean,” Cas says, his mouth just so, so he doesn’t really have much choice but to lean forward and kiss him.
“You said that it was cheesy,” Cas says, without looking up from his book. They took out some of the beach blankets that are now kept in these storage containers /  foot rests that Dean basically loves and Cas completely vetoed for their own home, and they feel almost too nice to get sandy. He’ll take it, though, with Cas stretched out on a blanket next to him, sunglasses perched on his nose, looking something like relaxed.
“Dude, I don’t wanna go all gender blind on you here, but I’m pretty sure it’s the same as being with a girl around your brother,”
“Got to this point where I was pretty sure that if I tried to get out, or if I didn’t do exactly what he wanted, that — that he was gonna kill me.”
“Man after my own fucking heart.”  Sam raises an eyebrow at him and Dean narrowly avoids dropping a sausage on his foot. It’s better to steamroll on with the conversation than let that one linger.  “Back me up, Cas. Hot dogs and burgers: fundamentally different experiences.”
“I am not normally like this,” Cas says, gaze settling on his coffee, which feels no less intense than his eyes being fixed on Dean for some reason.
Cas? Cause they might have something to say about you not showing up because, what? A glorified international booty call. Even if this was some longstanding thing, I’m pretty sure they might have some kind of problem with that,”
, obviously. He just doesn't know if it’s gonna help when Dean’s stress levels are this freaking high and he's just... Flailing
“Eat,” Dean says, “The worst thing that can happen is that you throw up again which, hey, par for the course at this point. Trust me.”
with Lisa. He barely wants to talk about the guy at all, but apparently that’s not on the cards from any of the people he actually speaks to.
“Just losing my tan,” Dean says, even though that’s not true. He is, though. After two years of sun skipping he got used to being permanently freckled. He’s losing colour.

“I --- I’m not gonna invite you in,” Dean says, “Dunno if that was even in your head, but. I’m not going to.”
“Hey, I volunteer as rebound,” Emily says, raising her hand and, yeah, she’s definitely drunker than when they started having the conversation, and he’s not exactly
“I know that,” Castiel says, “That’s just how I was feeling at the time, which is probably how we ended up in such a mess. I used that time apart to do some real soul searching too, Dean, but… this is all to say —— I love you because of

“What do you mean by ‘thing’?” Cas asks, tension leaking into his voice, an undercurrent of heat. “When you say we messed this thing up, what are you referring to?”
“ - okay,” Dean snaps, “I hear you. I get it. But you whining about this every single time isn’t freaking helping, Castiel. If we can nail this grocery thing, we’re golden.”
“Then go deal with it,” Dean says, not quite cold. It isn’t warm, but he has been treated to a variety of versions of Dean with all the warmth sucked out, and this isn’t it. The nearest comparison is matter of fact. He isn’t
Cas leans forward and pauses ‘Born to be Wild’ just after they’ve hit the highway, phone to his ear.

that Dean’s been trying not to think about, even though that’s spectacularly illogical given what he was doing six hours ago.
“I was going to leave,” Castiel says, and he feels dazed. Dean is reaching for him again, and Castiel is freefalling in the best way. “This —- this is going to work.”
“So, what? Just because he’s screwing you, the logic gets named after him? I taught this fucker everything he knows.”
“It’s a wonderful life,” Dean deadpans, walking into their bedroom to find Cas sat in his pyjamas and his god-awful christmas jumper, cradling a cup of coffee like it’s his favourite thing in the universe with the TV on. “Really?
it’s fucked up that he apparently let some random kid drive his baby. “Sweet car. Don’t worry about it —- people do it all the time.”

that Cas’ disappearing-thing is age-old coping strategy that doesn’t actually have anything to do with him, but ---
Cas navigates them back into safe conversation territory after he’s gotten his fill of reassurance.  Dean deepens this kiss and gets lost in it; fingers tangled in hair, chest-to-chest, building momentum even though they literally fell out of bed fifteen minutes ago.
And — he knows, really, that that’s not going to happen. There are always going to be bad days and bad nights, but they’re less than they’ve ever been, and they’re easier to shake than ever.
“Exactly! I’m reckless as fuck, Lisa. Call it a character flaw. Sleeping with a guests is the exact kind of crap I’d pull, I’ve just been too out of the game.  If I told my brother who few stupid rash decisions I’d made these two and a  half years he wouldn’t believe you for a hot second. I’ve been a frigging zombie.”
“Duh,” Charlie says, “You have like a hundred friends. It’s creepy. He was also pretty desperate to find you.”
like a long way from the crumbly old church, perched in the centre of a boneyard that’s seen better days. The world he inhabits these days is a long way from Friday nights bumming around in Castiel’s childhood bedroom, Castiel rolling his eyes when Dean skipped the classes he sucked at to smoke and, somehow, always being disappointed when he came home to their scrubby apartment and found John Winchester wasn’t there. It
They haven’t actually spent a whole lot of time here since they bought the house two years ago, between the commuting and either lazy weekends of not leaving the house at all, or weekends of visiting Bobby or Charlie or Sam or Gabriel, which is at least something good to come out of these last couple of months. They’re going to raise freaking kids here, fingers crossed, and
“I have to order a salad the next four times we go out for dinner,” Dean says, shutting his bedroom door behind him and not quite knowing where to go from here, because now their slowly building momentum has been cut off, and the
these things while Dean is so saturated with everything else, but that probably falls into the category of Castiel “babying him” (even though it’s entirely logical, given Dean works five days a week and Castiel has half a paid job and these other, nebulous volunteer responsibilities and ad hoc legal consults; he has
“I - honestly, don’t even know, ‘cause I hadn’t exactly been perving on my goddamn boss for two years, but -- he invited me over to to his place to help him plan the menu and… it seemed like a good idea.”
“And that’s the point, Dean,” Castiel says, pressing their foreheads together and smiling, smiling, “This time,
when Castiel said he wasn’t going to stay the night, then cajoled him into a movie, then insisted that it was an incomplete cinematic experience if they didn’t watch the full trilogy. He’s known Dean since he was twelve and he’s well-versed in the Dean Communication Handbook to know that’s a request to stay, he was just distracted enough about everything else not to notice at the time.

“It’s a good job your cute,” Dean grumbles, “We could turn this off and talk about your Dad, if you want.”

“You're an idiot,” Castiel says, shifting a little closer until they’re nearly chest-to-chest. Sometimes, Dean tends to position himself a little further away than he’d like to be. Castiel has no such qualms.  “And a millennial and... I don't think I'll get the job.”
“Yeah, I,” Dean begins. Cas’ quick overnight trip got extended to a couple of days, then a bit longer, until it suddenly became more logical for Cas to meet them at the Beach House rather than fly back just in time for the long drive. It all made sense. Samandriel needed him and that’s all well and good, even if Dean has missed him. Missing him, he expected. Feeling kind of shitty and struggling to sleep, he didn’t. “Get that. Just feel like I’ve been depending on him a lot lately. Feel kinda weird about it.”
“Woman’s fucked in the head,” Dean says, because he is charming like that, “What’s not to like? Soup’s good, Cas.”
“Of course you do,” Castiel says, sitting down heavily in Charlie’s seat. “If you want me to just go away and leave you alone then

As long as you were happy… And then you apologised to me and when you were looking at me it felt like it might work. That you might care about me despite it all. You said we should be friends but… We will never be friends Dean. We are more and less than that. We are not friends. We're not capable of being friends, and I got home from our coffee and I realized that all my arrogance in believing I had things under control was unfounded and completely wrong, because… We would have slept together again, Dean. I would have kissed you. I would have gotten ‘sucked In’ and … And I knew that I had been right about you, Dean, that you were frustrating and beautiful, that I loved you, that I would let you depend on me for anything, that I would give you whatever you asked.

“Sorry, Dean,” Charlie says, twisting her phone round to face him, Cas’ dumbass blog all over her phone screen which he recognises instantly, because of the number of times he reread it before heading to Charlie to get her to try his new sauce. “He's like, a life bogger too, I suppose.”
and then there’s sitting on the sofa, half cocooned between Cas’ knees, buried in his dressing gown, with the guy easing knotts out of his back. At some point, Dean drank half his freaking-tea by accident. It’s zero to a hundred in no time at all, and Dean’s not really sure how it happened.

Sam nods and Dean is perfectly okay with getting away from those too wet eyes before the waterworks start. He makes his way across the paper cup and wrapper laden sidewalk to a bar.
They've gathered around a fluffy Holstein named Milkshake. Dean had his hand in Cas' back pocket. They lean against a beam, surrounded by comforting agricultural smells and kids lying sleepily against their animals. Neither the kids nor the cows payed any mind when Cas leaned in to steal a kiss.
Dean had loved him too, as much as he was allowed. Cas can feel his longing. Has heard Dean's mind call out to him when fear overtook him in a nightmare, saw the joy in his soul when he shared something he cared for with Cas. He’s let himself be loved in the ways he can. Lets Dean worry after him, dress him up, push and pull him around, drive him in his car, put his hand on his shoulders, hug him.
Everyone starts laughing again. They stay late into the night until they feel safe to drive back to the bunker. Cas wonders if all humans hug as much as the ones he knows. He hopes so.
He does. All the time. The food in front of him at this moment means nothing. Sam hands him an onion ring and he eats it.
He spends hours laying in the field out back until dark. There's a little clearing there. The buried foundation of a cabin, or maybe an old septic tank. Clover and short grass grow over it. It's small enough one of the quilts from the house covers the whole thing, but the surrounding plants make him invisible. He lays there memorizing every inch of the Smith Center map on Google. He reads and rereads Vonnegut novels, Cas' arctic exploration book, a pulpy western that’s good in a trashy way.
Jack flickers in and out. Cas listens to the sound of Dean talking to Sam filtering through faintly like the static of the radio. He can’t help, can’t stop their mourning, and at the same time can’t stop knowing about it. He’s supposed to be asleep. He’s supposed to be done and instead he aches. His son is fading out again. He takes his hand for a few seconds before it's gone.
Dean picks up the empty mug in front of him and aims to throw it at Sam when Cas comes into the kitchen.
That was an understatement. But nobody has tried to kill Jack for a while and that’s better than Sam’s father ever did, so maybe they’ll get the hang of parenting after all. This is the point where Dean would go ‘good talk’ and thump him on the back.
“I made you, Castiel. I can still unmake you.” The skin of Chuck’s face is split in multiple places and shafts of pale ethereal light seep out.
Cas sinks deeper into the couch, letting Dean run his blunt nails over his scalp. Maybe in a bit he’ll put some lotion, then socks on his feet. Maybe Dean will fall asleep like this. Maybe they’ll take their coffee outside to watch the stars. Dean stretches his arm across Cas’ body and slots their fingers together.
Cas is crying now too. He finds the more time he spends with humans, the more emotions just happen. Even without his bidding. His tears fall hot and wet into the collar of his shirt.
Behind her Death stands flanked by the horde of collected angels and demons. The Shadow drops Crowley’s visage with a panicked look, reverting to tendrils of black ooze and taking off. Billie follows in close pursuit. Meg grabs Cas’ arm.
In the twilight, figures pass by, close enough to brush his body. In front of Cas, a golden seam comes open. Through the slimmest crack he can see something beyond. He reaches his hand through it and another hand pulls him from the other side, closing the rift.
She pitches her voice low and mimics him. "Hello, Claire." Goes back to her normal voice. "Would it kill you to just say hi?"
It doesn't even take shouting, or throwing of breakable objects. Miracle of miracles. They only have one mildly heated conversation.
Sam starts reading his own books. They have titles like: Adult Children of Narcissistic Parents, and Why Does He Do That?,and The Joyous Recovery. He sometimes leaves them on the coffee table or in the bathroom. Sticky notes sprout out of them like mushrooms after rain.
Sam and Dean turn around, and Jack slots himself between them. Their countenances bear the grim reality of the situation even as the warming sun cards through their hair.
The bunker teems with activity. They're in the middle of a hunter blood drive. Keeping the supplies up for those vampires still on human blood. Having a ready supply of human blood was also good for spells and some specific sigils they might need some day. Hunters are not about to trust that there’s no more angels and demons out there somewhere.
A seed of hope takes root, grows, blooms, and dies instantly in Dean’s eyes. Cas is dead. Dead for good. He tries to speak but no sound comes out. He clears his throat. If the other two notice, they do not say.
“It’s okay, Dean.” Jack squeezes him back, pats his back, lets Dean rock him a little bit before he lets go.
"What was that about?" Cas sets the cup of coffee in front of Dean and pulls a chair close enough their legs can touch.
“Everyone. There’s only Sam, Dean, and me left.” His feet shuffle on the floor that is not really the floor. “Sam and I tried to save some of the others while you were with Dean. But Chuck made them all disappear.”
They continue walking. Meg is filling in Anna while holding her by the hand, then Anna to Balthazar, and on like a chain of monkeys and game of undead telephone in one.
"Come on. Sack up Winchester! You tell that nerdy little angel that you're in love with him!" He tells his reflection before marching out of the bathroom.
A trip to the store was definitely in the future. They have some things laying around. Staples like rice, canned beans, tomato sauce, spices. Cas had pulled a handful of early squash out of the garden the day before. Dean split them, cleaned out the interior, rubs them with oil and a sprinkle of seasoning salt, then sets them in the oven to roast. While that bakes he cooks the rice. He combines it with drained chickpeas, tomato sauce, garlic, basil, oregano, and rosemary. The herbs come fresh from Cas’ garden. He finds a speck of parmesan cheese hiding in a drawer of the fridge and grates that in too with a handful of toasted bread crumbs.
“I love you.” Cas’ eyes are huge, and wet, and blue. He looks like he would maybe want to smile if he wasn’t crying so much.
Sam slowly pulls his phone out of the pocket of his pajama bottoms. He swipes the screen and taps a few times, increasing the volume as the music starts.
He stands rooted to the spot watching them go. Angelic booms still thunder from the distance but soon everyone will be caught in the terrific battle. It's loud and intense, this shelling in war. Louder still is the come on Cas, come on, come on of Dean praying that plays inside his head.
Combing through Craigslist they find an ad way way back with a listing of an old farm house for rent. They drive past the outskirts of tiny Lebanon to find a small white house just on this side of habitable. The stand alone garage is circled by crab apple trees in full pink and white bloom and behind the house a scrubby prairie extends to the horizon with only a handful of ancient oaks visible. It sits on a parcel connected to a goat farm by a skinny dirt road. The rent is very cheap as the home has not seen care or updates for a long time. The owners meet them on the dilapidated wrap around porch. Some long ago farm wife had planted lilacs to one side of it but they haven’t yet come to season.
in the face of a panic attack, if he is categorising it correctly anyway, but water feels better than wine. He is not a trained psychologist, but he is relatively sure alcohol is not the answer.
continues to be frustrating and painful and borderline humiliating. On balance, he’d say that Cas is handling it with more dignity and class than Dean, but maybe that’s okay, when Dean is the one dreaming of the weight of someone pinning him to a shitty motel bed, the flash of a knife in his peripheries, Alastair voice as he told him what to do, waking up most morning in a cold sweat with a thousand ways
“Got it,” Dean mutters with an eye roll. By the time he's back with the pizza, Charlie's set up their drinks on the coffee table and the game of thrones theme tune is playing, which is good. Charlie is good. The best damn friend ever, actually, and he’s a couple of shots away from feeling better about this whole shit storm of a day. Tequila, game of thrones, the stuffed-crust meat feast that Charlie ordered from his favourite pizza joint.
Five minutes later, his garlic bread arrives in the takeout box that Castiel helped him pick out. The garlic bread itself is in a crude almost-heart shape, wonky and lopsided, and it smells delicious. There’s a scribbled note with it too, in Dean’s rushed scrawl.
Cas said nice things about his omelette. He said that it had ‘growing charm’ and ‘pleasing warmth in more than just temperature’ which is a damn site better than ‘the idea of the burger is trying very hard to remain relevant’.
that they’re talking about his goddamn boy-drama, openly, in front of his staff. Who all know that he has freaking
Dean calls out his usual ‘hey’ as he slams the door of their apartment shut behind him and is halfway to the kitchen before he stalls, stops, and turns around to take in his little brother,
to the fact that all of this has been taking its toll on him, but Dean’s been trying not to focus on that because it’s the kind of thing that can unpick all the stitches on his fragile patched up psyche.  He looks a lot like he’s bene through the same emotional-wringer that Dean’s been through these last couple of days: anxious, unsure and tried. It’s
, let alone about something like this which, if he picks at it too hard, still has the ability to make him feel insecure and a little terrified of everything.  For most of his life,
"I heard you going on about how you you don't wanna get married and how the house is too much commitment."
try and defer away from this stuff pretty hard. I know —- I know that the timing isn’t great, Dean, and that you have a lot of things to work out, but I actually don’t think this is something that needs a lot of thought. I want you to let yourself have things you want. Accepting love is —— it’s really scary, but it’s good.”
That’s why they’ve come. This space would be clear even if all the people suddenly came back. The fish and birds and frogs may not be so lucky, and they would certainly be mourned, but frogs must make sacrifices too.
He shucks his light jacket and shoes in the utility room, putting everything in its spot. He quietly opens the dutch door to the kitchen. He can see that Sam and Dean are both asleep on the couch with their legs on the coffee table. He tucks a little styrofoam container with a pastrami sandwich and some cherry kugel into the fridge. Dean would be disappointed if he went out without bringing something home.
Dean has been hypervigilant all day. He feels like a broken tooth with all his sore spots revealed. The county has a crew out filling potholes. It feels like an invasion of privacy. It was one of the last warm days at the beginning of September. The heat shimmering over the pavement, and the repetitive but unpatterned noise of the machines, combines into a perfect storm to make Dean feel like an itchy and irritated mess. A couple guys on an asphalt truck are not a threat. They even waved at him as he went out to get his tool box from the garage. It didn't make the tense feeling go away.
Thank you for reading! This is the middle part of a larger work but I wanted to stop picking at it and I think it's fine by itself. If you want more domestic fluff, look out for part 3. If you want to know how Cas kills God, look out for part 1.
