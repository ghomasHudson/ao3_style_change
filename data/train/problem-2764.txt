The idea of what Mycroft’s version of wall shooting might entail preoccupies his mind for some time.
“No.”   John nods.
“I took a walk.”
"It's fine."
Two turns later, John was completely lost but then Mycroft pushed open a door and held it open for the two people following him.  "I hope you don't mind, I took the liberty..."
"Research?" John grumbled.  "You can't research something that isn't real, Sherlock."   But he dutifully typed.   "Clinical lycanthropy  is the diagnosis of people who have delusions of being a werewolf."
“Mycroft sighs.
“So?”
"Never better."  John sprang to his feet in a single fluid movement.
Mycroft shakes his head, “You really didn’t know?  Charming.”
Sherlock backed slowly away.  "John.  It is me.  Sherlock.  Your friend.  You are a man.  You are a doctor.  You are not an animal.  You can control this."
"No, I wouldn't."  John croaked.
“John.”
John takes the chair nearest Sherlock’s side and rubs his forehead with the palms of his hands.
Sherlock sleeps.
“I know. I need to see him.“
To live in a world that contained them.  His world couldn't.    It shattered him.   The sharp edges cutting more deeply every time he thought of John.
“No?”
"The church first?  Then the gardens of the estate?"
“I think the thing that is so disquieting is his silence.”
“No.”
“Still, I suspect it would be prudent to provide some reinforcement to your walls.  It wouldn’t do at all to strike down a passing pedestrian.”
John snarled.
“Are you sure it’s not broken?”
10 am.   John watches the clock.    It doesn’t move.  “Bloody thing is broken!”
"Forget me," Sherlock begged, humiliated.
John lept.
“Mycroft,” John wants to throttle the man. He tries to call on his experience, as a doctor, to find more compassion. “Mycroft, you’re desperate to see him.”
“They?”
“He’ll live?”   It is a question.
“They got called away on a case.”
“Your patient is out of surgery.”  John looks quickly at Sherlock’s sleeping body before remembering Lestrade.   He looks to the corner where Mycroft had been seating.   Mycroft is gone.   “Yes?”
Sherlock immediately sprinted towards the sound.   John followed.
“Yes,” John agrees.
"I let you kill the wolf…"
"Your name is Mycroft Holmes.  You love my son.  But not in front of anybody else?"
“An hour, less now.”
“They said he’d be out for a while yet,” Mycroft walks up to Sherlock’s bedside and takes his brother’s hand for a brief moment.
“Okay then, go on,” John pushes the button letting them inside the first door.
“I…”  John nods.
Mycroft nods and turns  back to his companion.  "What can I do?"
Mycroft sighs, “the thing about it, he said not a word.   But he was far from quiet.”
She's already seated, in a descent chair, as far as John can tell the only one in the whole hospital.
"Cure you."  SHerlock protested.
"Go." Mycroft tilts his head towards the door.  "He shouldn't be alone."
They could only imagine.
“His vital signs?” Mycroft’s brow furrows in concern.
“I didn’t know about you and Lestrade.”   John wonders if he should still be calling Lestrade Lestrade.   Sherlock and Gre… he recalls.   “I assumed… he wears a ring.  You both wear rings.”
"Wait, hold the presses, this might be the most ridiculous thing I've read, yet.   Apparently if you drink rainwater out of the paw print of a werewolf you will become a werewolf.  And I guess I'd prefer that to being bitten by a werewolf.  But how does that even happen?    Can you honestly tell me you've had occasion to drink rainwater out of any kind of animal's paw print?"
“He’d sit for hours…days, once, in wordless stubborn refusal to eat his lima beans.
“You are stalling,” John accuses.
"My aunt Gertrude and Frida Kahlo."
“And he sent you in here to look after my son so he doesn’t have to?”
Mycroft nods.
If only that were true.
“Officers heard shots fired.   They, Lestrade, responded.  More shots.   Sherlock and…”    Sirens envelope them.  John can’t hear a thing; he doesn’t care.   Their speed increases.
John takes his seat at Sherlock's bedside.  "I'm back."  He rubs the back of Sherlock's hand, careful of the ivs and wires.   "I have so many things I want to say to you, but first I need you to wake up.  So just wake up."
"Excellent deduction, Doctor."
"The clues indicate that the man we're looking for is acting as a wolf."
"It should be.” Mycroft nods and a fresh drink appears in front of John.
Who could?
John’s voice cracks.  “Does he?”
"That is the drugs, talking."
“Well past time,” Mycroft says as he takes his first tentative steps into his partner's room.
“Pardon?”
“Enough?”
“It’s too soon..”
Slumming?
It was time to go, well past time.
Mycroft shrugs.  "I'm an acquired taste."
Mycroft looks up after a long moment, “I rather prefer him shooting up the walls than shooting up himself.”
“I do spy on you, though.”  Mycroft shrugged.
Sherlock lunged forward.
Mycroft
"It is time," She mutters.
Stop texting with my brother I snagged you a seat.
Warm, lythe, free of pain,  and suddenly ravenously hungry.  John sniffed the air and turned towards the nearest meat.
“I think she just might be able to do it,” John quips as he tries to commit everything about Lestrade’s condition to memory. He’s managed to escape interrogation once. He doubts he’ll be as lucky again. “I am familiar with his condition. I’d be happy to answer any questions…”
"It is late.  You haven't slept.  If you want to get some rest, my assistant will alert you to any chance in Sherlock's condition.  You won't have much chance once he wakes up."
“It’s something.”
“I assure you, I can.”
Mycroft shrugs, “I am afraid the matter remained unresolved when I returned to school for the start of term.”
"No change?" Mycroft stands  in the doorway, watching John watch Sherlock.
"Also like my aunt Gertrude."
"Who writes these websites?   Wolfsbane is a poison.  What if somebody tried that because they wanted to look like that guy teen girls  from that movie teen girls like?  Kids could die, Sherlock."
“Too quiet,” Mycroft repeats.
"Lestrade's… Greg's injuries are extensive.  The surgery he endured was a long one.  Assuming he can avoid infection, recovery will be long, slow, painful, and tedious."  John is too tired to pull punches.
John would be more comforted by Mycroft’s reaction if his preferred drink weren’t waiting for him without him saying a thing to the bartender.
"It's a gift."  Sherlock turns his head towards John.  Tries opening his eyes.  Closes them again.  "One of many.  I am gifted."
He’s never been afraid of the sight of blood.   He’s never shied away from an injured man.  He’s never been made sick by the condition of a body found at a crime scene.
Mycroft taps his foot nervously.
The pen.  The table.  The Erlenmeyer flask.
"She loves him."
“You aren’t quite how I pictured him, either. I thought you’d be taller, rounder maybe.”
"So if you were Rawls and you were worried you might have turned.  Where would you go?"
“I’m sorry?”
“My profession… his… “  Mycroft looks down at his feet.   “It’s different now, somewhat….”
"Other things being Detective Sergeant Donovan?"
Sherl…--  He’s texting when he hears a knock at the door.  “Sherlo…”  No, Sherlock wouldn’t knock.  He opens the door.  Mycroft stands in the entryway.
"He will need a good deal of support." John doesn't want to make promises he can't keep, but he does know what Lestrade needs, will need.  Knows what he needed, anyway.  "Not just in the physical sense."
John cocked his head to one side.
Sherlock stepped backwards.  A deadly dance.
“Yes?”
The hairs on John's neck bristled.  There was something in the air, a familiar musk. He lifted his head to the sky and let out a loud, primal, primitive howl.
"I'm here."  Sherlock surfaced from the pool.  "I'm right here.  You're fine.  We're at the hotel.  Do you remember?"
The sight of Sherlock’s prone pale body underneath the crisp white hospital sheets nearly undoes him.   He wants to flee the room and erase this image from his mind.  He wants to sit on the edge of the bed and rest his hand on Sherlock’s exposed skin, to let the warmth radiating off Sherlock’s body provide the reassurance he’s currently desperate for.
Sherlock vomited, sweated, swore, shook. He prayed for drugs.  He prayed for death.  Nether came.  Punishment for atheism?  A reward?
“Oh John do that again,” he begged. “Please, please do that again.”
John nodded. “My old comrade Stamford had opened a doctor’s office and said he could use some help but couldn’t afford to pay me much,” he said. “Then I contracted typhoid. I only lived because Stamford took care of me. I finally felt better but got kicked out of my bedsit for nonpayment. I slept on the street for a while." John's face flickered red with shame.  "I was too proud to tell my friend. I’d sometimes hide outside the bakery on Piccadilly and wait for them to throw out the stale bread, just so I didnt starve.”
----------
“Oh, here? I was a medic in the army. I needed something to do with my time. My employer, he’s…”
John shook his head adamantly. “The clamps. It was my job to count the clamps.”
“What do you think?”
Sherlock smelled like sex.
John walked up to the small structure and looked inside. The door was locked and the place looked abandoned, but he could see furniture. He went around the side to get a better look.
“I am upset!”
1) Are you interested in renting?
“Alright,” replied John, getting to his feet with some difficulty.
“Alright,” answered Sherlock, his bright smile dampening.
“Understandable,” replied John, noticing the lack of haughtiness that would usually accompany this admission. “I imagine this has been incredibly difficult for you.”
John began to slowly rock against the headboard, his fists buried between his thighs.
But he could see, quite plainly, Professor Brook in his bespoke trousers and Oxford shirt, unbuttoned enough to reveal a light dusting of dark hair on his chest.  His wrists flowed gracefully as his body seemed to move fluidly with the sound of the orchestra.
John wiped his sweaty face with his elbow, as his hands were dirty. He made himself look directly at Felipe as he spoke.
Jean stepped up and pulled keys from his satchel. “Oui, Oui, uh, no docteur,” he said. “Go to Spain.”
John cried out in surprise, then sobbed in relief, but he was too exhausted to raise his head.
John immediately released his arms in shock.
Sherlock glanced up and spotted Wiggins heading straight towards him, a concerned look on his face.
John awoke with the sun halfway in the sky. It was the latest he’d ever slept without being ill. He jumped out of bed and found Sherlock in his robe reading the paper and drinking tea.
Felipe said he would try to sneak in before midnight. There was no way John was going to last that long.
“Nothing” said John turning red. His hand moved over his chest and nervously grabbed his jumper at the neck.
“I'm sorry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know you care for him. He was your lover, no?”
Sherlock turned and smiled. “Come here,” he said, holding out his hand.
-------------
“Yes it is!” replied Sherlock emphatically.
“M’lord,” answered John, bowing slightly.
John unconsciously gripped his medical bag. He had no idea how to respond.
A Watson family secret is revealed.  Neon green headphones make everyone’s day, sort of. John and Sherlock christen the crime scene.
He must’ve stood there longer than he realized, because then Mr. Thomas said:
"Too right. Poncy tosser- not a hair out of place, and whoever heard of a bloke who never has so much as a piece of lint or wrinkle on his clothes?"
Yes, eventually and inevitably - but there is more to the tale.
From that day on, all was well in the Kingdom. Sherlock and John were released from the tower and came to rule the land in the Royal Castle with Mycroft and Gregory as their family and advisors.
"Doesn't make a difference, firm no! You'll just have to be satisfied with listening to Golden Oldies on the radio while we drink tea."
"John, you don't suppose Hudders..."
We'll write our stories dusk til dawn
Sherlock concentrated on clearing his blurry vision blinking rapidly. "You called me love. You...John you love..."
We'll take our leave and go.
It had taken all of John's fortitude to excuse himself and retire to his room when Wesix appeared at their door. Mike had been very explicit in his instructions to John about how critical the timing of things was to the success of the plan. Sitting on the floor he examined the Arclight in his hand. It was an unremarkable clear glass ball that looked like nothing more than a cheap ornament. It had no decoration or opening but according to Mike it was a powerful magic vessel. His ears perked up at the sounds of Sherlock and Wesix going to the bedroom and he ground his teeth waiting for the moment he could strike.
"Because you're an idiot."
Saturday 26th December - Boxing Day. The aroma of fresh baked scones roused them from their afterglow slumber. John yawned and stretched as far as Sherlock's death grip on him would permit. "Mmm, smell that? Hudders must have come back from her sister's on the first train, it's barely half eight."
"ONLY me", thought John coldly, and things were about to get worse.
Smiling, Sherlock recalled their first case together. "Something pink?"
"Starving but not for food. Come along you vandal, I have lots of illegal behavior planned for us. That is if my physician judges me fit for such activities."
Caught napping in the sock index which revealed a bright red Christmas stocking embroidered 'Sherlock' which was promptly hung on the mantle. That night a camouflage stocking marked 'John' joined it.
"Break the what? Are you running a fever? STILL BORING!!"
"Speaking of being stood on", grumbled Sherlock's chair, "I..."
"17th August, Thrift Shop Day, a fantastic opportunity for us to pick up disguises."
Sherlock places an affectionate arm around John and a quick kiss on his lips but the mood remains dour. "Need more, John? Luckily I've done my research. Let's see how your birth year foretold your future. The Aswan dam was completed, hmm, who dams up their emotions? Mount Etna erupted and there was a major earthquake in the San Fernando Valley, sound like someone's temper? The Microprocessor was developed, well, obviously the technological gene passed you by, nevertheless moving on. Fashion trends were frayed jeans, polyester leisure suits, surplus military clothing, garish colours and baggy outerwear. Explains the hideous jumpers."
"Sorry, reckon I'm just thinking."
"You get beaten up and Molly will have to tend to you."
"So I'm the bowler and this is my cricket ball?"
Overhead fireworks began blanketing the city sky with percussive sounds and vibrant displays. As they walked towards home Sherlock took John's hand interlocking their fingers. " You know John it's quite interesting how fire can be made to scream. It involves gunpowder and steel containers with holes and the end effect is really exceedingly..."
To his consternation, Sherlock found the chauffeur for their bright neon limousine was none other than Mycroft. "What are you doing here and in this? Not exactly your style."
"And not wasting my time on frivolous pursuits does not make ME Ebenezer Scrooge, John."
The older Holmes steepled his fingers under his chin, an eerie impersonation of Sherlock. "As you are aware, Sherlock's return to health under your care compelled me to remove all surveillance equipment from Baker Street but I could send a team."

Heading for the kettle John grinned. "See, like I said, rewards but..."
"Naturally. Wouldn't expect anything less of my brilliant boyfriend."
John snorts, "None of the above, I prefer your nuts."
Sherlock is smiling now. "23rd August, Ride The Wind Day. Sex in a hot air balloon?"
"You're already googling aren't you?"
"What do you want?"
"That brings us to today. 3rd August is Grab Some Nuts Day. You can choose peanuts, walnuts or pecans but no cashews, they give me gas."
At that the mood in the flat turned from somber to giggling joy. "Sorry to disenchant you, but Sherlock and I are bundled up. Unless you fancy a flash of my calves beneath my dressing gown."
"Above her... Why would she..."
Before the end of that first sea-son
"Seconds more like. Give me a minute to restart my heart then you can tell me what you want and believe me it had better be good!"
Felipe shook his head, and continued walking.
“Not in the slightest,” Sherlock said emphatically. "I’m not accustomed to...” Flirtation? Attention? Being touched? “Forgive me.”
The trip to the Yard was… difficult.
“I love you,” said Sherlock. “I will always love you. But I must hereby terminate your employment immediately.”
“You do?” said John, rinsing his cock off.
“What’s your name, young man?”
“A detective?”
John ran a hand through his hair as he nodded.
“Face down in the shower,” said Wiggins grimly. “The Yard said he drowned in an inch of water.” He suddenly looked as if he might cry, but managed to pull himself together. “Night, Sherlock,” he said, crawling back through the window.
John closed his eyes as he felt the glorious heat of so much skin against skin for the first time. Sherlock's tongue gently played against his lips as he slowly pulled John by his hips down into the bed.
“Sherlock, time to rest,” he murmured.
“And this one, with the carved oak handle and spindles, belonged to Daniel Turk. He used to wave the baton so high he would hit the chandelier above his head and shower himself with glass!”
Then shouldst thou be my Waspe or else my Bee,
His expression suddenly softened.
Automatically, the orchestra brought their instruments at ready.
“Alright, that’s enough of that,” he said, smacking his baton against the music stand. He stomped his foot on the podium. “Back to the beginning, please.”
Sherlock failed to reply. A whole week without John and facing Brook everyday was suddenly very overwhelming.
Ahad nodded his head in respect and left John Watson alone in the unit. Sadness overwhelmed him at the thought of never seeing Felipe again. Though didn’t love the Spaniard in the way he loved Sherlock, the intense admiration and respect he felt for him had, for a time, almost felt the same.
“What have you got there, Johnny?” said the Mr Thomas, the third footman.
The request, though seemingly out of the blue, felt perfectly natural to John.
Sherlock gripped the back of John’s neck as his other hand grabbed one of his rolling hips. His cracked fingertips broke free of the makeshift bandages and smeared bloody fingerprints all over John’s thigh and chest. John saw it and shoved Sherlock’s bleeding index finger into his mouth and sucked.
“Nevertheless,” said Mycroft. “I’m impressed.
His large, elegant hands swept over John's shoulders.
The officer gave John a sympathetic look. He knew Felipe had told him the situation. It was just as well. John knew if he walked in and found Sherlock dead, he probably couldn’t bear to go on.
“I'm traveling to Marseilles to visit a friend. She’s not expecting me for another week, so I took a detour.”
Sherlock awoke, looking up at a man he didn't recognise. He thought the bloke was desperately attractive, and the was sun positioned directly behind him producing a glowing halo around his head.
“I'm well,” said John. He turned and hung up Sherlock's jacket. When he turned around, Sherlock was staring at him.
Later that evening, as John helped Sherlock undress, he was surprised at his lordship’s silence.
Luckily they had both dressed before falling asleep together. Felipe opened the door to find a terrified Ahad, holding John’s loaded pistol in a shaking hand.
Sherlock pushed three fingers in in response. John moaned and grabbed the opposite end of the table as Sherlock removed his fingers, slathered more  butter on his cock, and slid his hard throbbing dick into John's tight little buttered-covered asshole.
Mrs Watson smiled at her boy. “I am as proud as I’ve always been of you, John,” she replied. She took his hand and whispered. “Your father would also be very proud of you.”
John shook his head, looking a little dazed.
“Yes. But a little danger never hurt anyone. Especially when creating beautiful music,” purred Brook. He walked over to the case, punched in a code, and the glass slid open. He pulled out a slick, translucent baton. It glistened in the overhead lights.
“Mmmm?” managed the young doctor, his lips so red it was hard to tell where Sherlock’s cock began and John’s lips ended.
John reached the end of the bridge and skittered down the stairs into the grass and dirt.
The Golem’s eyes suddenly focused and glared back at John. His deformed mouth began to twitch….and he spit directly into John’s face.
That evening, John relaxed in the guest bedroom. He opened a bottle of cava and poured himself a generous glass. He settled back in the chair with his notebook in his lap and began to write.
A dozen hard, quick thrusts and John saw rainbows. He orgasmed long and hard, the heat and tightness from Felipe’s body overwhelming him to the point of ecstatic pleasure.
“Ahad wants to be a surgeon,” said Felipe. “He’s your assistant. Operating room is in there,” he said, pointing to a tiny room in the back with a large curtain drawn to the side. The Spaniard continued barking orders at the students.
“That doesn’t appeal to you?" said Sherlock.
“Ah, yes, course,” John answered, obviously uncomfortable. He oscillated between the two men, finally sitting awkwardly on the edge of the couch.
Victor Trevor has a secret. Professor Brooks wants to take Sherlock to the next level.
John crossed his arms and sighed heavily, but sat back down.
”I don't want you to leave for Marseilles,” he said seriously. “I want you to stay here.”
John charged for the gun as he heard William gasp for air. His legs kicked the ground for leverage as the monster leaned in and squeezed. John managed to have the gun in his hand and cocked in seconds and leaned onto the strangler’s back, the gun held firmly at the base of that thick, pasty neck.
William obeyed, but he grimaced as he swallowed.
“Mr Anderson,” Mr Roberts said in reproach. “I've had enough of your commentary. Leave us. Now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Luckily, Mycroft was watching him intently, his eyes about to bore a hole in John’s head. He quickly removed the glass from John’s hand before it shattered onto the floor.
“And take the credit?”
“John!” he begged.
“I almost died with him,” he whispered.
John carefully made his way down the servant stairwell. The same stairs he had traipsed up and down as a child, the same stairs his mother had tumbled down to meet her demise. When he peaked around the corner, he saw the servants at the table, some polishing silver, other darning socks, all talking animatedly about the day's gossip.
“I need you to know something,” he said.
Of that faire Boy that had my hart intangled;
And they were getting louder.
Sherlock turned back and gathered John in his arms. “Enough, now. Tell me, when’s surgery?”
Sherlock scrambled to sit up for better look, his upper body resting on his elbows, his neck straining to see the lovely things he was feeling. John looked up, his cheeks still still sunken in from sucking on the tip of Sherlock's prick. Their eyes met and locked in a passionate glance, and Sherlock wondered, just for moment, if he was going to come just from the sight of John Watson's mouth on his cock.
“How so?” Sherlock asked, his eyes narrowing in curiosity.
“Is what we have real?”
Sherlock gasped. His arse was throbbing, but it still felt so
“John?”
A tube and bus ride later, John and Sherlock happily entered the warm dormitory. Sherlock tried not to be embarrassed as he passed his classmates, none of who greeted him or even tried to make eye contact.
“You and Mr. Holmes are the only English here at the Inn.”
John was already sweating when Sherlock looked down at him, a look of pure pleasure on his face. His chest was rising and falling with jagged breaths. He held on gently to Sherlock’s hips as Sherlock grew used to John filling him up.
He opened his eyes, and was shocked to find Felipe’s big brown eyes staring back at him.
Later that day, John was roused from his boots to witness the village doctor hurrying along the servant's hall. Mr Thomas was suddenly at John’s side, dragging him down the hall behind him.
Once inside, he followed the pathway as it wound around deeper and deeper into the earth until he heard the roar of water directly ahead.
Weeks passed, and even though Sherlock’s mood had improved significantly, his appetite had not. He continued to sit most days in front of the fireplace drinking copious amounts of brandy and claret.
“No.”
“What-?” began Molly.
“You have to come with me.”
“We picked a good day,” said John. “There’s no one here.”
“Sergeant Reginald Baxter, God save the Queen,” responded the soldier. He waved for two more ales to be set at the table and pulled out a bottle of whisky from under the table, removing the cork with his teeth. “Here, this’ll put some hair on that chest of yours.”
“Welcome, Mr Watson,” said Dimmock. “Glad to have you aboard.”
John hoped, in time, Felipe would forgive him.
Somehow, he managed to drift off to sleep.
At the opposite end of every hallway was the tiny single dorm, or the “Sliver” as everyone called it, usually reserved for seniors or resident advisors who craved additional privacy and personal bathroom.
John knew he would have died if it hadn’t been for Mr. Thomas, but Felipe had taught him how to live again. Spain and the vineyard had been an oasis in a desert of hopelessness. At first, the relief of not mourning, to not feel like he was treading water and drowning was euphoric. As that wore off, the beauty of landscape kept him refreshed. And when that waned, sex with Felipe had kept him enthralled. But then, much to his distress, the familiar walls of boredom had begun to close in a bit. He’d fought it. Sometimes daily. Tooth and nail. His impulses needed controlling. He’d have to be a madman to not want what he had with the Spaniard.
His weathered forehead wrinkled in confusion.
As he stepped inside the familiar room, John tried to look around without appearing to do so. He knew it was foolish to even attempt pretense with Sherlock in the room, but it seemed the polite thing to do.
Instead, Sherlock steps forward, gently gathers John’s face in his large hands, and says:
“I’m Dr. Watson, ” said John, concerned. “Here.”
He managed to look up at John with tired, hopeful eyes.
“Because,” said John. “When you talked to Sherlock about my abilities as a surgeon, when you convinced him what I could do, it changed my life.” He gripped the table. “I worked in Edinburgh. I've been making my way as a royal physician for a decade. Things like that don't happen to people like me.”
Sherlock raises his chin slightly. "Yes. Professor Richard Brook."
John gaped as a life-sized wooden figurine looking much like Jesus Christ passed by them.
It was the last house on the left. John hesitated, then mumbled a swear under his breath and made his way up the porch.
“Those are our handkerchiefs.” He picked one up and showed her the indigo monogram W.S.S.H. Underneath was the other stitched in dark blue the letters J.H.W. “She insisted on the hand stitched monogram. Said it was ‘indecent’ for a gentleman to have anything but in his pocket.”
John leaned forward and gripped William’s hand.
He leaned forward earnestly.
John didn’t take his eyes off of Stefan as he said, “Let’s go.”
Sherlock, held down by John's strong arms, tipped his arse up and presented it to John.
John pressed his hands tightly together behind his back. Oh, how he fought the desire to reach out and take a hold of him, to softly stroke the sharp angles of his cheekbones. He was convinced he could coax dark curls out of his sheared scalp with his fingertips.
“He said, you can’t shoot all of us,” replied Ahad.
“Still old and devilishhh,” purred Sherlock tightly.
I ask that you return to England immediately. I will pay all travel costs.
"It won’t happen again,” John said loudly, making Mycroft raised an eyebrow. Then, looking right at Sherlock, a bit softer said,  “I’ll make sure of it.”
“He did,” says Sherlock. “In fact, I’ve got a potential serial killer. It’s like Christmas!”
He hid for so long that he awoke the next morning still curled in the same position from the night before. Luckily, it was still early enough that he could sneak into the practice room and retrieve his belongings, before returning to the dormitory and locking himself in the Sliver until evening.
Sherlock roughly ran his fingers through his hair, making his fingertips sting. He looked down at his hands to see them smeared in blood. Every fingertip, save one, was cracked open and bleeding.
John, stricken, handed the paper to Sherlock.
Felipe pressed John up against the wall. The stone’s coolness shocked the back of his skin, his shirt thin and soaked with sweat, quite the opposite of the heat radiating from Felipe's broad chest.
“Mycroft mentioned I was allergic several times.”
“Penny for your thoughts?”
lips open, gasping for air.
“John,” whispered Sherlock, placing his large hand over his and removing it gently from his nightshirt. John’s breathing increased as Sherlock again pulled at the string, but this time he didn’t stop him. Sherlock pulled the nightshirt up and over his head and threw it to the floor.
No guests. No letters. No dinners out.
Sherlock dropped to his knees in front of John, placing a kiss on his chapped lips. "Promise," he grumbled.
John blinked. “What’s that?”
“Sure?” said Sherlock, with a soft pout.
“Does he have to?”
“My brother has come back to us, Dr. Watson,” said Mycroft. “And I have no idea what to do about it.”
John removed the tin box and put everything back the way it was. He tucked it under his arm and walked though the large doors and down the path to the ocean.
Sherlock answered, pointing at the drink in front of him. “Ich habe schon eins.”
John visibly shook as he shut the door, his back heavy against the old bulwark. His knees gave way as he slid to the floor.
“I am searching for someone. A man named Holmes.”
“I don’t know. She died when I was a child.”
Sherlock, disappointed with John’s gentle technique, dug his fingernails roughly into his strong, thick hips. John bucked in pain and consequently shoved his cock hard and deep down Sherlock's throat.
Sherlock refused to look at him. He stared at the floor.
“I can’t let my guests venture out into this terrifying weather,” said Matthew. “Please, let us house you for the evening. It’s no trouble. Take the train in the morrow.”
He fell to his knees and leaned in to Mr. Thomas’s lap, gathering both arms around his narrow waist.
He held out a smooth, well-manicured hand.
John watched him from the tub as he finished drying himself. He began to walk out of the room, when John asked him where he was going.
“Good afternoon, Watson,” said William. “I trust you slept well?”
Felipe and John gave each other wary, grave looks and followed Ahad to the hospital’s entrance. He turned and handed John the Browning before they walked out to the courtyard.
“I see you,” he whispered again. “Oh love, come here.”
Sherlock removed his hat and raked his fingers through his curls.
The Christmas festivities were grand as usual. Lady Irene had several guests from out of town, the Duke and Duchess of Nottingham and the Earl and Countess of Alnwick, who also brought their valets and lady's maids, so the house was full and chaotic but also full of cheer and spirit.
"It will feel good, I promise."
“Tobacco ash?”
It wasn’t the first time Sherlock had been to university, but one didn’t remain unknown on a campus as small as Cromwell. Sherlock had enjoyed a certain anonymity while at Cambridge. He was the youngest of all the science students and he excelled at his studies, so he spent most of his time running lab experiments or doing research in the library alone. He despised his roommate, so he always snuck into his dorm at odd hours in order to shower and change clothes, and often chose to sleep in remote places around campus instead of returning to his own bed.  He had been well on his way to becoming an esteemed chemist and researcher, lacking only a few credits to complete his terminal degree.
He laughed as Sherlock pulled him towards the beach.
The next morning, the cool, autumn sun was just peaking above the horizon as Sherlock Holmes made his way across the busy, breath-taking campus of Cromwell Music Conservatory. Headphones covered his ears as his iPod blasted Tchaikovsky, his music an armor he often wore when heading into a battlefield of social interaction. He held his instrument closely to his side, protecting it from the hundreds of students walking by, all carrying cases of various sizes and shapes.
The steam blew out of the stacks as the metal wheels squeaked against the rails. The train began to move, easing its way along the platform.
Sherlock smiled back, grateful for the pep talk, and kissed him for it. Sherlock carefully positioned himself over John’s lap as he stroked himself. He watched John add lubricant to his own sheathed member, stroking it up and down, it somehow growing even bigger in size. Sherlock braced a hand against John’s chest, and with the other, held on to the base of John’s prick below him.
John knew what William was asking but he didn’t know how to explain himself - that he didn’t want to leave, but he was terrified to stay. Thoughts of his growing boredom in Spain coupled with the lack of excitement in the country made him wary. He was perfectly content at the moment, but how long would it last? He couldn't disappoint William with an empty promise.
John offered to stay behind.
The door swung open, and Sherlock locked eyes on Brooks, who seemed surprised to find Sherlock is still in the room.
“I thought I’d gotten the time wrong and you’d already gone!” he declared.
“I’m here for a reason,” Sherlock managed.
William was silent for a moment, then suddenly stood up.
“I am sorry, Dr. Watson. You have my word I’ll never -”
“I tried to drink myself to death. I’ve only recently been well. This trip...I was encouraged to travel. To get away for a while.”
“None of that,” said Mycroft, shaking his hand.
Mr. Thomas’s weathered face immediately softened.
"Nah," said John. "I have rounds late tonight, and Raibert will go out and party since he's just back in town. I'll have the place to myself some."
“He ripped me apart.” said Sherlock finally. “He broke me down. Me!”
Donovan rubbed his lips with his thumb in thought.
She flashed a smile at the clients and made her way into the kitchen. While filling the kettle, she eyed the table and counters, noticing a thick layer of dust still covering the teapot and sugar bowl.
“As soon as I think you handle the journey, we’ll go home, yeah? But your body needs time to heal,” he whispered. He let him go and cradled his face in his palms. “Otherwise you might get sick again.”
The idea of meeting Moriarty, to parade the elusive memory stick in front of the clever and deviant mastermind made Sherlock giddy. He’d been sitting in his coat curled up on his chair for an hour, pretending to be engrossed in crap telly, waiting for John to get out. Finally, saying something about Sarah and milk and beans – Sherlock quickly made the promise to buy the latter, though intended to do nothing of the sort- John left and Sherlock found himself blissfully alone. He quickly pulled out his computer and typed:
Moments later John felt someone grabbing him from behind and he was pulled off of the dying man. John fought the Inspector until he realized it was futile, so he dropped his hands to his knees to catch his breath.
“What stories?” William asked, squirming a bit from the pain.
“He did, did he?” John answered.
One evening, they sat around the fire drinking brandy as the rain pounded against the windows. John was unusually silent.
“Four years ago, now,” said John, remembering. “Doesn't seem that long ago.”
The opulent staircases that led to the fourth floor were wide and two-tiered, separated by a ten meter landing space that held antique vases, busts and tapestries donated from wealthy patrons from the past one hundred and thirty years. The wide, open walls were covered with portraits of men and women long dead. The third floor, where the administrative and faculty offices were housed, boasted marble counters that had been shipped in from Italy. Hanging at the entrance of the fourth floor practice hall was Repin’s original portrait painting of Mikhel Glinka, the father of Russian classical music.
“I mean I paid it off. All of it.”
“I’m really sorry about what happened,” he said. “My new mate doesn’t know his arse from an ankle tap. I’ve never seen a ball go flying like that in my life, let alone nail someone in the head as squarely as it did yours.”
“That’s a bit not good,” John mumbled, licking his lips.
“You teach the sciences in the village school?” John asked. “That’s wonderful.”
“To draw you a bath.”
John huffed with amusement and yanked off his trousers. He covered Sherlock's body with his own while biting and tugging on Sherlock’s red and puffy mouth.
“Are you serious?” Brooks said, looking at the director, exasperated.
“Of course, if you’d rather keep bees - ”
Several snickers echoed through the orchestra. Someone muttered, “I thought Sherlock was a girl’s name.”
The workers were now passing by, all greeting Felipe and nodding at John as they made their way toward the large tables under the olive trees. Francesca was setting out huge bowls of rice and vegetables with rounded loaves of bread and tiny jars of olive oil. The men greeted her warmly as they took a seat and began passing the food.
John deepened his kisses, settling on top of Sherlock, palms rubbing his chest, gripping his hips. John's lips trailed kisses up his long slender neck, then gently nibbled on his earlobe.
It was going to be a long summer.
He closed his fist and lightly pulled, eliciting a gasp from Sherlock’s shiny, slightly swollen lips.
Suddenly, John’s head was filled with Sherlock’s words.
“Thank you,” whispered John through chattering teeth. “Thank you.”
“They tortured them, John,” he said through gritted teeth, his anger transparent even through his tears. “They enjoyed killing.”
“What if you tire of me?”
Your presence is required for an urgent matter concerning my family's estate.
It's the last thing Sherlock heard before he passed out cold.
“I missed you,” Sherlock said softly.
“So,” he said happily. “How was your wander?”
“Had he been shot?”
“Perhaps your current insolence is intentional,” she snapped.
"Fine," he said evenly. "It seems like you were just trying to impress me."
Slowly, he was lowered down onto the side of the wooden beams. William was wedged between two of the pillars, with the lower half of his body submerged in the water. John’s feet touched the lake, and he cried out from the cold.
John pushed his trousers down and slicked himself. He teased his lover’s entrance with his prick. Felipe moaned and bucked, and John pressed a palm into the small of the man’s back as he pushed in, slowly and gently, penetrating the Spaniard for the first time.
It was the camel painting, the one Mr. Frank had showed him as a child!
"-Paulo killed Sven's wife. And both unaware of each other's plan," John gaped. He slammed his empty glass on the tiny kitchen counter. "Amazing, Sherlock. Absolutely brilliant."
“A Book of Poems” it said simply.
A chill gripped his spine as he became aware of a dark figure standing in the doorway. He hadn’t heard the door open...and he was positive he’d locked it behind him.
Before he could reach for his Browning in the end table drawer, he had the good sense to call out.
John's eyes shot up in curiosity. Sherlock leaned forward.
Sherlock moaned and writhed for what seemed like eternity, and suddenly he was stiffening and silent and John felt him tremble outside and inside, and the warm wetness that spilt between them immediately caused John to come,
A young woman, very pregnant, writhed on the table in the tiny office space. She was covered in sweat, and by the glazed look in her eye, she had been this way for a very long time.
But the stranger never emerged. In fact, the tunnel was now eerily silent.
“What?”
He wasted no time in unpacking his trunk, which held clothes, books and his laptop. He plopped the computer onto his half-made bed and reached up to open one of the large windows. Cool air swept into the stale dorm room as Sherlock slid a silver case out of his pocket. He pushed a thin cigarette between his shapely lips, lit it with a matching silver Zippo, and took a long drag.
Sherlock smiled back, genuinely pleased. “Tell me the story of how you met. He never told me details.”
“Come on,” said Sherlock. “I’ve got the perfect alternative.”
“Fifteen years?” John replied, suddenly ashamed for not writing sooner. “I thought if I wrote - well, I feared it would cause trouble.”
When he looked up, William was gone.
He pulled John's hand away as he covered the smaller man’s body with his own. His lips caressed along John's jaw as he held him close.
-------------
“Better than most,” replied John, tucking it into his rucksack. He pulled Sherlock close, and in response long fingers rubbed through his jeans.
“Dr. Watson, You must for forgive me. I didn't mean-”
They shook hands politely, and Felipe gestured to the seat in front of him.
Felipe left Jean Pierre with orders to make the school into a makeshift infirmary in case the disease reared it’s ugly head in the village. John packed up what he could and followed the Spaniard into the city.
“Mmm yes?”
“Do I know you?” said John.
“John, I want to go home,” he said pathetically.
“That is most kind of you, m’lord.” Sherlock secretly pinched the back of John’s biceps to get his attention. “We graciously accept your offer.”
“The Case of the Three Garridebs,” he read aloud. “This is it?”
It's Sherlock's first day of class. He smokes with his resident advisor Billy Wiggins, who warns him his room might be haunted by the ghost of Carl Powers, and tells him to stay far away from Richard Brook. Of course, Sherlock doesn't listen.
Sherlock briefly closed his eyes as John slid easily inside of him. John's lips played along a stubbled jaw as he held himself up by his arms. He carefully studied his lover's face for any trace of pain.
John carefully pushed open the guardhouse door. The inside was a scattered mess of strewn papers and furniture. A scuffle of some sort had obviously occurred. Donovan shined his lantern over a pile of papers, and picked up an article of clothing, showing it to John.
That was a possibility, John thought. William took things to heart more so than Sherlock ever had. But if that were the case, he would have already returned.
John walked over and picked them up from the floor. Sherlock turned to do the same.
---------------
“Why bees?”
“One-two-(a slap on his left cheek) -three-four-o- (another slap) -ne-two-three-”
John admitted that the old servant was a sight for sore eyes. It made him feel a little relieved that someone still cared enough to come searching for him, even after he’d made little effort to stay connected with the world.
Sherlock grinned at the old man before turning to rifle through old newspapers on the Earl’s desk.
“Sherlock, said Molly. “What was today about?”
“Hush, love,” Sherlock whispered teasingly, as he sucked at John's rough knuckles over and over.
Felipe sat awkwardly on the porch.  He shook his head in disbelief.
“I have no plans to vacate,” he said finally.
“John,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock had not regained consciousness, but his fever had broken early one morning, soaking the sheets and giving John hope. John hadn’t left his side, to the point he had neglected all of his other duties. Lestrade stopped by often to check on them both.
“I think you do,” John said softly, threading his fingers through Sherlock’s wild, dark locks and briefly massaging his skull. Without a word, John gathered the young man into his arms and pulled him tightly to his chest. Sherlock gasped with a strange mix of relief and disbelief before embracing him just as tightly in return.
Days blurred together as the sky cleared. The abnormal weather pattern finally dissipated, the wind pushing the rain clouds and blowing them south where they belonged. The city’s ancient aqueduct, which had eventually been closed off by the locals, was now, thanks to the rains, filled with fresh water. Through Felipe’s sanitation recommendations, the water source was deemed safe to drink again. Patients began to recover and go home. It was a relief to see the floor of the ward again, and then, an empty cot or two appeared. Even the diplomats began to return, though they had yet to show their faces in Dr. Canales’s medical school.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Of course, John. Where's the scotch?"
“Wanderlust,” Felipe rumbled, his accent rumbling delicately over the “r”. “I believe that is what the English call it?”
“Are you alright?” asked Sherlock, his breath still recovering.
Mrs. Hudson rolled her eyes. “Really, Mycroft, was that necessary?”
“It’s your curls,” John answered, without thinking.
“You look well.”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed with anger. “And what good would that do? To live a lie? Force others to live it with me.” He shook his head. “No. Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.”
Felipe shrugged his massive shoulders. “I’m curious to know why an Englishman would want to run a shitty apothecary in Tangier.”
Lestrade nodded. “We’ll find our way. It’s not far.”
Inside was nothing special. It was an open area with a bar and wooden tables. Drinks were being served, and music was being played quietly by a man on a violin in the corner of the room.
The conversation was light and pleasant. As they finished their entrees, John asked if they could wrap up William's untouched plate. Mr. Thomas was adamant they order dessert, since he hadn’t “had a decent treacle tart since Halidon Hall’s Christmas party three years ago”. John was becoming concerned at William’s absence. It was now after 9 o’clock, but Felipe had agreed to try the Battenberg cake and he didn’t want to spoil the mood.
Felipe cradled the bottle in his large, calloused hand.
It felt so good he fell back against the door with a thud. Felipe continued to stroke him as his lips sucked and teeth bit along John’s small, swelling mouth.
Mycroft, unsure how to proceed, took his wife’s hand.
As the two men jumped out of the carriage near Piccadilly Square, Sherlock watched his friend’s ruddy red complexion drain away, his body stiffening as they walked down the busy street.
Sherlock suddenly sat up and got out of the bath, dripping water all over the floor. He grabbed a towel and began to wipe himself off.
Mrs Hudson rolled her eyes. “Don't make me tell his lordship -”
“Your friend -” Felipe’s eyes fluttered shut as he corrected himself. “Sherlock...he can stay too. We will take care of him together. Keep him safe.”
“Please...make love to me.”
Peter stood up, a look of confusion contorting his pleasant, wrinkled face.
It was the end of January when Sherlock announced to the Earl that he was leaving on holiday to convalesce somewhere “warm and polite.” Mycroft was relieved, stating that he had been constantly worried about Sherlock’s health and he was happy he was taking steps to improve his state of mind.
“Of course, I’ll go with you,” John said lightly. “I’ll be happy to get you sorted, give you my opinion as such. It’ll be good for me to get out to the country too, you know. Fresh air, push London out of the lungs.”
Sherlock opened his eyes. John Watson stood in the doorway, glaring at Professor Brook.
John tried to suppress his curiosity, but he had to ask.
Sherlock turned, raising an eyebrow. “I would certainly hope so, considering how long you were stationed over there.”
“What the bloody hell, Sherlock…”he whispered.
John’s heart swelled.
When John sunk into the hot bath and washed away the grit from non-stop traveling, he started to feel human again.
“But you do,” John earnestly replied. “You could marry. Have children. Stay away from... temptation.” John again finished his drink too quickly. His face and neck were flushed and he was perspiring.
“Can you bring him by the yard? I’ve got something for him to take a look at. That is, if you think he’s suited for it.”
Yes, that was her fantasy…at first. But she’d met Bill at the pub, and he was nice. He came from a good family. He liked cats and kung-fu and chinese checkers, and she wanted so much to love him. Bill even looked a bit like Sherlock; the curly hair, the long lithe frame, the trench coat. He was sweet, loyal, and ever so boring. Yes, Molly was determined to love him. She thought that if she tried hard enough, she could channel that love she felt for Sherlock into a new love for Bill. And yes, her life had become less lonely. Bill loved to curl up with his arms around her while watching crap telly and play with her hair and kiss her and tell her silly things about his day. The more time they spent together the more they talked of the future. They dreamed of buying a flat near Barts. They joked about having children but discussions had become more serious as of late. She loved his parents; her mother thought he hung the moon.  It was all quite…nice. So when Bill asked Molly Hooper to be his wife, who was she to say no?
Sherlock pushed against John’s shirt and undid his trousers. “Take off your clothes.”
It became clear very quickly that Maria was a trained, capable nurse. Upon hearing the diagnosis, she prepped the room for surgery, helping John wash and gathering the sheets. Within 30 minutes, John was cutting into the young woman, whose name was Pilar, and pulling out her newborn daughter. John had Maria hold the baby as he unwrapped the umbilical cord from around her tiny neck. He then took hold of the infant and held her face down, tapping her little back and smacking her lightly on the behind.
It was gone.
John woke up alone on the cot, his head pounding and his mouth dry.  He heard a tremendous amount of shouting from outside the tiny room, making him deeply regret his decision to drink until drunk.
Felipe assessed him with his big, brown eyes.
“John? What the hell-?”
Sherlock rose and put on his riding boots. He handed John his cane.
John backed up and grabbed Sherlock’s hand, pulling him along. Sherlock took a step with him, then stopped.
Victor visibly relaxed. “Thank you. My history is rather...colorful. And best left in the past. I’m not exactly what I appear to be.”
“Then you shall have it,” he answered, silently hoping to God Sherlock knew what he was getting them into.
Sherlock dropped his robe onto the bed and began to dress. John reached over and gathered it up just as the leather strap from his brace caught on his knee. John felt his skin burst open, his leg suddenly in searing pain. His breath froze in his throat as he fought the impulse to groan. He forced himself to pick up his lordship’s vest.
Felipe was in the field when John reached the house. He dropped his medical bag and shucked out of his coat to join him.
“That’s it,” John mumbled.
“Pretend you’re fucking me,” he said softly. "How you’d want to, how you’d need to." He held his hand still as Sherlock hesitated and then slowly lifted his hips and thrusted his throbbing cock into John’s open fist.
The Honourable Sherlock Holmes, the Earl of Cornwall’s second son, stood at the kitchen in the servant's hall with his new device. It sat in the middle of the prep table shooting a searing, blue flame into the air.
Sherlock slowed as he spotted him, treating the situation like seeing a spooked animal, not wanting to startle him lest he run away. He snuck up beside him. The coat wrapped around the young man’s shoulders was indeed covering an arm in a cast.
They both eased back into the train and found their seat. They both sat in an uncomfortable silence for a good hour before speaking.
“That would be highly inappropriate, m’lord.”
“Home,” he whispered.
“Lost?”
“I dropped something behind the dresser, and I simply moved it to gather it up, when the entire frame came crashing down.”
Sherlock nodded, his eyes closed as he relaxed.
It was that moment that something snapped in John. For months he had felt helpless, angry, and exhausted from the daily grind of living with someone who was slowly destroying himself. He was scared more than anything, but his desperation mixed with the sudden pain in his jaw filled him with uncontrollable rage.
“Mycroft,” Irene whispered, trying to calm her husband.
“Felipe?” John asked quietly. “Alright?”
“No!” John cried out, running haphazardly along the shoreline.
“There wasn’t anyone stationed there, at least not officially,” answered Sherlock. “Your orders were to defeat the rebels. Mine were to spy on the Russians.”
John looked up guiltily. “I don’t know,” he answered. “It feels... wrong to be here.”
“I’m sorry” he said softly.
"Sherlock," John said, his tone softening. He didn't move off the bed, but his stare did not falter either. "Just tell me - " his voice broke, but he quickly pulled himself back together. "Who in the bloody hell did that to you?"
Sherlock had arranged to stay in one of the facilities for visiting professors, as traveling back and forth to a hotel would have been too inconvenient and time-consuming since he planned to spend all of his time at the conference. The sessions didn’t officially begin until the next morning, but there was an informal mingling of sorts that evening at the Universität.
He got up and went into the bedroom, slamming the door behind him.
Sherlock eagerly rolled over to face John, grabbing his jumper and pulling him close, his ample lips grazing a stubbled jaw and sucking on the tender spot just below his lover’s ear. John groaned in response, taking Sherlock's hand and rubbing it first on his own thick, ample cock, then placing it on Sherlock’s long, slender one.
“I see,” said Sherlock slowly. “The village apothecary thinks he’s a royal physician now?”
“Do you really think I’m ready for this?” asked William quietly.
“I owe you a great debt, Watson. You saved my life.”
He did the only thing he could think of.
John stood up on his tiptoes and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s. “I want you to fuck me,” he said sadly. “Hurt me,” he whispered, shrugging off the Belstaff and pulling his shirt over his head and shucking his sweatpants. He began unbuttoning Sherlock’s Oxford.
The hallway widened the farther they walked, and a sharp turn dropped them into a wide, open room with a twenty foot ceiling. Two carved archways led to two additional passages, one directly ahead of them, and one that veered off to the right.
"Sherlock," exclaimed John. "What the hell happened?!"
" -L&M’s no filter, pack’s old. You dipped into your emergency stash,” said Wiggins, unfazed. “Forgot to stop on the way in. Or couldn’t. Family doesn’t know?” He looked expectantly at the young man.
He felt a hand on the back of his neck. Felipe whispered in his ear:
“Of murders.”
Sherlock bucked and shivered and whispered desperately. "I'm going to come, John, I-”
John turned around and smiled genuinely, the sides of his eyes crinkling. “That was excellent, wasn’t it,” he said.
“Do it do it do it!” yelled Sherlock and John obeyed.
“Dr. Watson, may we be of service?”
When they reached the farm, Felipe stopped at the barn to check on an ailing horse. John held up the lamp so he could see.
Sherlock turned red, but refused to be intimidated. "I believe, Mr. McDougal, that your first "chore" should be to put on some clothes."
John’s expression showed panic. He released Sherlock’s hand and held it tight to his nightshirt.
John followed with a lukewarm bath of his own, and both men sat down to soup and bread. John continued to indulge in the wine, and seeing that the bottle was already open, William had a glass or two. As they retired to the parlour, they both felt refreshed, full and relaxed. William sat in the chair next to John, and noticed the book crammed behind the end table.
John dragged the man into the shade and dripped the last of the water from his canteen into the man’s parched mouth. He not only realised the soldier was an officer by the decor on his uniform, but that he was bleeding profusely from a wound in his stomach. John bound his waist the best he could to stop the bleeding. He then reloaded his rifle, wiped off his knife and snuck back out to the battlefield.
Sherlock pushed back, then pulled John to him, kissing him deeply. He could smell the sweat, the chinese food, the cheap bar soap on John’s body. It was intoxicating.
John’s eyes flashed with anger. He pointed a finger in William’s face.
“I came here to make sure you were safe.”
He moved toward John like a cat, his nimble fingers unbuttoning his crisp white shirt. He was on him within seconds, rumbling into his ear:
William placed the deerstalker on his head. His cerulean eyes sparkled as he adjusted his hat, grimacing as it slipped awkwardly over his hair. The familiar image made John smile.
“I've never been with a woman.”
"Come, dance with me."
Heavy footsteps could be heard coming up the stairs as Detective inspector Donovan appeared in the doorway. The older man was soaked and out of breath, and holding a letter.
Everyone dropped their instruments except for the first chair trumpet, who played as instructed. A few notes in, Brooks stopped him with the slightest flick of his hand.
The bow struck the right side of Sherlock’s arse hard enough it knocked him off balance, but he caught himself on a chair before falling to the floor. He stood back up immediately, sweat glistening on his forehead.
"Lie back," mumbled John against Sherlock's red and swollen lips. Sherlock did as he was told, settling back on the pillows propping his head. John kissed the top of each of Sherlock's bony knees, then deftly slid a finger inside his still slicked and open center.
“I wish I could take it all away,” he said sadly. “So much pain. So much loss.”
Felipe nodded.
They sat quietly and listened to the ocean waves through the open window. The moon was full, and it added an extra glow to the room in addition to the lamp.
John had the money. He had saved most of his earnings over the years, thanks to the Holmes family’s generosity. He could pay the debt. He earned enough in the village to send home to pay Marie and the London household expenses.  He’d be left with a little spending cash.
Sherlock relished the look of shock on his former valet’s face as the words sunk in. He knew he was being cruel, but he also needed those drugs. He couldn’t live without them. John, well, John would eventually forgive him... or at least the odds were he would.
A strange look flashed across his mother’s face. “Of course you should,” she said. “We shall go together.” She paused for a moment, then continued. “Do you think of him often?”
Felipe’s offer had been impossible for him to refuse. He postponed his trip to Marseilles and instead, threw himself into helping Felipe at the hospital. He grew to be a familiar face with the villagers, sometimes paid in olives, tomatoes and chickens for his services. John found his work was made easier by having Maria by his side. He heaped praise on her often. Though she had never been to medical school, her diagnostic abilities were astonishing. She taught him about local herbal remedies and where to find certain plants and fruits.
John stepped forward and cleared his throat. He gazed at Mr. Thomas.
A couple of drinks in and both young men were relaxed and deeply discussing a case involving two young homosexuals and a double murder that was, Sherlock declared, "terribly romantic". His face was lit up like a Christmas tree as he put the pieces together of the torrid, tragic love story based on facts from the papers and from what they could each find online.
“Ah, Jean!” he said, pointing to himself. “You docteur. Use here. No money, one month.”
Donovan glared at John for a moment, but didn’t say anything. He then turned and began to shout orders at his men.
John turned around to grab his rucksack, but Sherlock caught his arm.
“Would any of Mrs. Hudson’s needlework have been stored away?” he asked. “I’m specifically looking for her handkerchiefs she used to embroider for Sherlock. I have stacks of them in London, but I'd like them on hand now, if possible.”
Sherlock closed his eyes.
Sherlock wiped his mouth gingerly. "I've been in a relationship before," he said defensively.
“My blasted lungs!” he cursed as he coughed. He tried to gather some honey on a spoon but knocked over the jar. John spooned some warm water into a cup and added a generous dollop of the thick substance, stirring it thoroughly.
William looked at the floor sheepishly. “I did match you drink for drink, but after the first two, I had the barmaid switch out mine with water.”
John operated on Masala for hours, but she was too far gone. She died on the table. Ahad was devastated. John watched him wander out in a daze towards the front entrance. He found him moments later on his knees, his face to the sky, fat droplets of rain beating relentlessly on his forehead. He pulled him back inside and sat with him in the hallway as he cried his heart out. John cried too.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock demanded from inside the room.
Felipe shook his head in confusion.
John did wait up for him, but even he was surprised at how late Sherlock arrived back at the suite. He was dozing off with a book of common German phrases over his chest when he heard the door click shut.
John had a bad day. He wasn’t too happy with himself. He’d been to surgery and mended some bad ankles and gave a lollipop to a little girl as she was a good little girl as he bandaged up her knee.  Sarah had said bye as he left. He thought about her for a good bit on the walk home. They had made awkwardly passionate love after she was captured by the Chinese mafia and almost killed by an arrow. He thought of her bush, about how it wasn’t how he liked it usually,. He liked his women clean shaven and Sarah was anything but. But it was okay I mean who was he to complain he thought.
“John.”
There was a sound of splitting wood and grinding metal, and the door of the bathroom suddenly flew inward and fell to the floor knocked clean off its hinges. In walked Raibert MacDougal, who assessed the situation mid-stride and gathered both horrible men by the necks and smashed their heads together. Sherlock ducked, and then threw up right on the bathroom floor.
John bowed his head again. “M’lord,” he said.
“Exactly what we needed,” he grinned. “Proof, right here in my hand. John, get your bag.”
“Of course,” said John, nodding once. “Discretion, always.”
“What brings you to Tangier?” Felipe asked suspiciously.
“I couldn’t find him.”
“Doctor!” shouted John.
“Victor! I’m so relieved to hear from you! How are you?”
“You quite showed your hand there,” Moriarty chuckled.
John couldn’t tell. He threw his hat off and leaned down, trying to see, but the shadows from the limited daylight made it impossible to make out, even with Peter’s torch.
"An operating table," he said amazed. "This was back when doctors would operate on people without anesthetic. Would cut people's limbs off as a last hope of saving them."
“Save me, John,” he said.
"Wow, you weren't kidding."
The man he
“I know,” he whispered, looking desperately over at Felipe.
John grunted as their bodies brushed against each other. He quickly unbuttoned Sherlocks trousers and dropped to his knees.
She smiled after him as his tall, lithe frame bounded up the servant stairs.
The host led them them to a table along the wall. Sherlock ordered a bottle of wine, and John sighed in relief at the pleasantness of his surroundings.
Molly Hooper thought Sherlock Holmes wanted to take her to dinner. Of course Sherlock Holmes had something infinitely more compelling, wonderful and thrilling planned for her.
“Something to do with the money?” He wiped his glistening forehead with the back of his arm. “Ah, I know. You’re a secret prince and all the riches of England are yours!”
Mr Thomas’s face went white. He shook his head adamantly.
John spotted Donovan in the hallway. He waved.
"Yes. Chemistry. Research."
“John, I-...” he began, then stopped to take a deep, breath. He gripped the armchair. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Ah, Sherlock, I want to see you. I’m your professor, and I know what’s best for you,” he cooed. “Pick up your violin, and play my concerto.”
Sherlock didn't answer, but rose from the bed and padded the few steps to the kitchen. His erection jutted out from his body, dark and full. He was suddenly ashamed, and his shoulders slumped as he covered his aroused genitals with both hands.
“I am his doctor,” John motions towards Lestrade, “His GP.”
“Shooting at the walls.”
John nods, remembering all too well how he felt before they’d come with news about Sherlock, how he felt lying in a hospital bed his shoulder in a cast, unable to help the men on his ward.  He’d thought it would improve when he left the hospital, until he met Sherlock it gotten progressively worse.
“If I prefer to stand?”
John is walking in the park.   The weather is lovely in a sad sort of way.  The flowers have begun blooming but it’s too early.  They’ll die when the weather gets cold again.    It depresses him.
"A pronounced unibrow"
“Yes.”
John walks into the small private waiting room, astonished, but not really to find the table filled with a silver tea service and a wide array of pastry and other more savory small bites.
"Go on with your life, John.  Be a doctor.   Be brilliant.   Forget me.  Forget the chaos.  Forget the crime. You wouldn't be here if we've never met."
“Him who?” John asks.
“Yes?”  He blinks trying to get his bearings.   He has no idea how long he’s been asleep.
"You left."
“You’ll feel better when you see him.”
Text message:
Who could remember the name of that damn thingamajig anyway?
“My son’s homosexual life partner.”
John picked up the scent of iron now  His stomach growled.  He saw the wound on Sherlock's shoulder and licked his lips, hungry, starving.
“No,” John agrees.
"Any change?" John asks.
“Abuse of the furniture.”
Mycroft is everything.
John shrugs.
"Right," John says again, but he takes a plate and avails himself of a small sampling.
“So, we know nothing?”
“Sherlock and Gre…”    Mycroft stops.  His thumb taps against the wooden handle of his umbrella.
“It’s not.”
“Are you him?”
John feels tears and laughter welling up.  "Bloody hell! You're sarcastic even under sedation."
That motivated him.  Every staggering stab of loneliness motivated him to find and eliminate more threats. Each one bringing him another step closer to home.
John returns his attention to the physician.  “Yes, DI Lestrade.”   He hates himself for forgetting about Lestrade.
John sighs, “Yes?”
“Of course not,” Mycroft scoffs.
“Pardon?”
John could no longer swallow.  He could no longer speak. There was no dignity left.  They'd enjoyed their last good day.
He does neither.
“Yes.”
"But he will recover?" Mrs. Lestrade voice trembles slightly.
“Your brother?  We are moving him to his room now.   Somebody will be out to get you shortly.”  The doctor is gone before they can ask another question.
“Gregson?”   Sherlock hates working with Gregson.
“Are encouraging,” John admits without taking his eyes from the machine.
John reaches over and puts a hold on the beeping machine.  "I'll get you some ice, pain medication and…"  John wants to take a pen light to examine Sherlock's eyes, wants to examine every inch of him .  "I'll get your nurse."
3:03 am.  He needs tea.
John actually smiles, "I can't argue with you there."
Your brother is odd.
“Yes.”
“I’m a doctor.”
“Where did you go?”
"We'll manage."  Sherlock kissed his partners forehead.  "We'll be fine.  I'll remember everything else….  But please, forget me not."
John nods towards the chair Mycroft had occupied earlier.
“No!” John considers fleeing from the room. Only then he will have to recount the entire exchange to Mycroft. He stays.
John is unsure how to answer her.
Mycroft sits.
“No,” John agrees, “he doesn’t.”
"And?"
“Yes,” John agrees letting out a long breath.
"And your ego remains intact,"  John focuses on finding the button to turn off the overhead lights.  "How are you?"
John averts his eyes, “you know everything about me.”
“I’m sorry we can only release information to family.”   John searches the doctor’s eyes.   He doesn’t like what he sees.  “I’m a doctor.”
“Yes.”
Mycroft at pub.
Mycroft’s car is warm.  Too warm.    “What happened?  I had a shift at the surgery.  A patient had to be transferred to hospital.  I stay…”    Emotion creeps into John’s voice.  He coughs.  He looks away.
"On purpose?"
A deep baying answered them and john set off in the lead.   He sensed something strange and familiar in the air.  A musky wild scent that reminded him of childhood, that reminded him the dawn of time.     He moved towards that scent.  Faster.  As fast as his legs could carry him.  It wasn't fast enough.   He needed to go faster.  He needed to be free.
Donovan, Mrs. Lestrade, and Mycroft all shoot up at once.
“You weren’t supposed to.”
“But…”
"Children die every day, John.  But in our line of work I've never been called on a case where a teenager was trying to turn themself into a supernatural being.  So maybe young people aren't quite as impressionable as the media makes them out to be."  Sherlock forced a smile.  "What else?"
“I will out myself, John, to anybody in the world. But you cannot ask me to out him to his mother. It’s different.”
John and Mycroft both spring up.   “He’s out of surgery.  He’s lost a lot of blood.   He’ll be out for a while.  He might have a limp.  He should be fine, in time.”   She says other things.
“That’s not it, I don’t think,” Mycroft interrupts.
“He’s not in a position to argue.”
“Mycroft.”
"He will have the very best of everything," Mycroft says to Mrs. Lestrade.  "I assure you."
“Really?”  John frowns.  “Sherlock knows every…”
“But?”
"Forget me!" Sherlock frothed.  "Go.  Leave.  I don't want you.  I don't need you.  Go!"
"Forget me."  He listened for John's last breath.  "Goodbye, my love. I will forget you not."
Mycroft nods, “when?”
"To cure me is to kill me.  It is a part of me. I like it.  I want it.   I need it.  I think I've always... my aunt... maybe... "
“He can go hours, days without speaking.”
An hour passes without a word being exchanged.
“Wildly persistent joint cracking.”
He takes a look at the x-rays and they are familiar, unremarkable, yet completely new.  He’s a little at sea.  He’s treated these wounds in an army of men paraded through his operating theatre.   This is a single man, a man he knows.  He has stood beside this man on a very different battlefield.  This man fell beside Sherlock.  His injuries could have been, maybe should have been, his own..
The older woman nods.
"No!"  John felt repulsed by just the thought of it.  The water was not clean.   "NO!."
The doctors, the nurses, everybody tried to comfort him, "We know how hard this is."
“And?” John isn’t sure Mycroft is breathing.
“Are you him?” A small gray haired woman asks as soon as John enters Lestrade’s room. Her tone is accusatory. It startles him.
"Forget me," Sherlock sat at John's hospital bed, willing his friend to breathe, to open his eyes, to see, to speak.
“Comforting.”   John downed the drink in one.
"You don't identify them because they are FICTIONAL!!!!"
John threw his hands up in defeat and followed his partner.   They went all through the village.  They interviewed the vicar.  He wasn't terribly encouraging when Sherlock asked after recent requests for exorcism.   Vicars so rarely were.
“I didn’t…”
“Yes.”
“He didn’t want to upset you.”
“She?” John asks confused.
In some ways this part of his chosen profession had been easier when he served.   There was precious little interaction with the families of the gravely injured men in his care.  He’s not done this part in a very long time.
Mycroft drinks
"Sounds like a scouting nightmare waiting to happen." Sherlock smirked.  "Can you imagine?  How do you identify a werewolf?"
“You can’t just ring up the queen!”
“No he doesn’t.”
“Her 40th”   John takes the seat across from Sherlock’s brother.
John nods, unsure of what meal they are nearest too, unsure of the last time he ate.   He's not given much thought to food since Mycroft's call and that feels like three lifetimes ago, but he wouldn't swear to it.
"John wait…"   Sherlock said.  "I think...
“And you don’t work for him.”
"John, where you fell… there were paw prints."
"Right," he sits down.  Unsure of what to do next.   It feels, somehow, as if they have audience with the queen and he shouldn't begin making his plate until she has eaten.
No drug ever lifted him to such heights.  No bullet ever pierced so sharply.  "I'm sorry.  I'll go."
“Taller and rounder? I can see that. But you are my son’s homosexual life partner?”
“Thank you.”
The dog stilled.   Sherlock collapsed.
Mycroft grips the handle of his umbrella tightly.  Takes a deep breath in and lets it out.  "Greg loves his job. He is good at it.  He's worked his entire adult life to build up a reputation.  Tomorrow all of that is gone.  He's the gay detective."  Mycroft winces, "The dick that likes dick."
"We have been here a full day, John.  We've not slept.  We've not changed clothes.  Surely, we can be spared one last indignity."
Mycroft belongs to a club.
"You are awake."
"That isn't much." Mrs. Lestrade sighs.
“Sorry, Doctor Patel,” Her voice teems with sarcasm, “You aren’t quite how I pictured you.”
A forgotten anniversary?   They loved each other Everyday.  Who bothered about the date.
John stayed.
“Go in, please, see him. Tell me how he is. Tell me, everything.”
John smiles, almost.  It hurts.   “I don’t know what I’d do…  I lo…”  He can’t.
"You aren't helping, John."  Sherlock took John's phone and began reading.   "Seems like people develop wolf like physical features even in human form.  They grow a lot of hair.  They have a widows peak..."
“Am I?”
"The police ran him in almost immediately.  They have him dead to...."   John immediately regrets his choice of words.
“It’s hard, the sitting, the waiting.”
"You were expecting someone else?" Sherlock opens one eye, slams it shut.
John tenses, expecting Mycroft to pull some sort of rank, to threaten to relocate the woman and her entire life en masse to the coldest most isolated reaches of Siberia.  John starts towards the door trying to usher Mrs. Lestrade out of the room before she sees something that cannot be unseen.
“I can’t. He wouldn’t want…” Mycroft shakes his head.
“Do you know him?”
“No fewer than three.”
John looks incredulous.
“For your sister, her 41st”   Mycroft  starts towards a table.   John understands he is supposed to follow.  He hasn’t paid for his order.   He doesn’t think he’s supposed to.
"Thank you," he almost whispers in the direction of the nurse then turns sad eyes on John and his companion, "Now I believe we were going to get some tea.   There is a rather fine bakery down the street.  I'll have some things brought in."
“And you aren’t him.”
"And when the moon isn't full?"
“Yes.”
“There is nothing I can do for him, or for Sherlock.  The Met ran in the shooter before we’d even arrived at the hospital.  Greg would want it that way.  So, I suppose my not interfering is something.  They are doing a blood drive in his name, it’s all over the news,” he holds up his phone, “and I can’t even participate in that.  I know hundreds of people, John.  I like a half dozen or so.  I love three.   Two of them are in this hospital and I am useless.”
“He’s a friend?” John realizes it sounds like a question. He isn’t sure he would have categorized Mycroft as a friend before this morning. He’s thinks he would now.
Mrs. Lestrade squeezes her son’s hand. “I’ll be back. I’ll bring him with me.”
“I’m not encouraged.”
“You go.”
Mycroft worries his phone in one hand, his umbrella in the other.
“40th, she’s  two years…”
John squeezes Sherlock's hand.  "Greg's here.  He's hanging on.  Breathe."
“No.”
He steps tentatively towards the bed, but focuses on the numbers displayed on the numerous screens that indicate Sherlock’s condition.   These digits he’s spent years relying on now feel wildly intangible.
“Three?”
John moaned.   The licking.  Dear God, the roughness of Sherlock's tongue… "I can't move."
John lingered.
“You work for him?”
“Who?”
"I'm afraid I never subjected her to decortication."
"A pity."
“Yes.”
John nods.  The car isn’t going fast enough.
He expects Mycroft to jump in every few words with questions, but the man sits patiently his blue eyes focused, concentrating, absorbing every word as John goes over it all, the broken ribs, the collapsed lung, the bone fragments they removed from his lung, the bullet fragments they’ve removed from his spinal column, the  potential for nerve damage, the problem of swelling and the seemingly minor injury to his knee.
“He’s not moving,” anger flares up in John.  He isn’t sure why.  “He’s pale.”
"No, he's not…." John objects.
John studies the monitors.
“Seemed?  Past tense.”
"I don't know you, sir.  Your assurances mean nothing to me."
Seriously, he must be dreaming.  He reaches front of the queue.   The woman hands him a coffee and chocolate cherry scone.   He hasn’t ordered a thing.   He loves Chocolate Cherry Scones.    He wants to ask how that happens.  He wants to punch Mycroft in the face.   He says, “Gloves?”
“Am I 38?”   John interrupts.
Mycroft is the club
The door opens.   It’s the 245th time since they arrived in the waiting room.   John’s been counting.   He doesn’t look up.  “Holmes!”
"Enough of a din Doctor?"
Neither were successful in stifling their laughter then and it elicited the predictable result. "John, are you planning on staying down there gossiping like a scullery maid all day? I need that iodine. This cancerous prostate gland isn't going to wait forever!"
He settled on Element 67 Holmium, Ho, a soft silvery white metal much like Sherlock's pallor of late. As he installed it on the crossbar of the H John found himself ruefully thinking of Holmium- Holmesian. If the situation wasn't so frightening and desperate it would be pure farce.
"Can't say I'm proud to admit this but after he passed out at that crime scene last week I made him give a blood and urine sample. I was legitimately checking a number of things but I also ran a tox screen- nothing. No evident physiological reasons for any of it."
"Well spotted", came his slurred mumble in reply. "Don like 'im, Martha, bloody bastard!"
Sherlock IS our show!
"I was so sure I had chosen the right pill. How could that have happened? Why?"
"He did depart rather quickly, did you see those skid marks? Impressive. And speaking of impressive, I think I promised you an opportunity to investigate my person."
Advancing on Sherlock like a predator stalking his prey John snags a slender, muscled arm. "Nonsense. As you showed me, age is only a number. So I've reached the half century mark, well done me! And YOU, get in that bedroom, get naked and get ready to say a 'prayer' of thanks."
"What about them?"
"Agreed, he did play a large part in our initial association."
Perhaps he'd just roam the streets and collapse in an alley in hopes that one of the Homeless Network would find him and provide shelter. He could count on them not to judge his life choices poor as they had been. This was just the most recent of his benders and he had worn out his welcome with Greg and even Harry, so a dark alley it would be.
"Behave remember?" A hidden bum pinch produced a baritone yelp.
"Don't you EVER say that, don't you even THINK it, Sherlock Holmes. If anything happened to you I don't think I could take it."
"Sorry Martha, I was ah..."
"An Investigation of Fuchsia isn't it?"
"Well aware I'm not dying but fifty, Jesus Sherlock, I'm FIFTY!!"
🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁
If taking the measure of Mr. Wesix wasn't annoying enough, John's mood turned ferocious when Sherlock returned wearing the purple shirt that definitely challenged the the blogger's tenuous grip on heterosexuality. When or how the new "couple" left John couldn't say. He was too busy seeing red.
"Paying attention to me!"
"No doubt she's been baking since she got in the door to make it up to us for not being here the last two days."
Sherlock's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Then John Hamish Watson IS going to to do something worthy of an ASBO."
"A Stradivarius isn't any old violin, John. At the time it seemed..."
Once upon a time (I believe it may have been later last Tuesday) John had followed Sherlock to a drug den and rescued him with true love's kiss. As it transpired, this rescue was orchestrated by fairy godmother, Mrs. Hudson and archenemy, Mycroft who both had meddled in their own particular way to orchestrate said locking of lips.
"Couldn't be bothered to talk to me?!"
Wesix walked behind Sherlock groping him brazenly and sucking a deep love bite on his long elegant neck. "Nothing my own. John was just trying to disabuse me of my suspicion that his inebriation last night lead him to seeing things that aren't there. Doesn't hold his liquor well does he?"
"Riding" the skull which had two large gold coins over the eye sockets. Upon investigation the coins proved to be rich chocolate.
"Indeed. Dark and squishy is our world.", purple lamented.
The skull endeavored to interrupt, "Now see here Kitchen..."
"Right, see that only proves I can be as clueless sometimes as you think, but in my defense I've been really distracted of late, hence why I want to talk. Sit down will you."
Sherlock looked oddly unsettled momentarily but then began to babble like a lovestruck teenager. "Cols and I met at the morgue last night. He's taking over for Molly while she's at her cousin's wedding in New Zealand. He has some new investigative pathology methods that are fascinating."
On the bathroom shelf surrounded by a collection of luxurious bath and hair products.
"No, men...not her area. Nevertheless, she was preoccupied with your love life and was rather emphatic that it was evident from your blog entries that you are smitten with me. By a process of skewed logic she concluded that my failure to publicly reciprocate was denying you 'the happiness you so richly deserve' to quote her exact words."
John caught it midair and tsked, "Lucky for you he doesn't have a name yet. If he did there would be consequences. One does not touch the elf."
To tell of gay Sherlock and bi John
"This for me or you?", John had teased. Sherlock countered, "Does it matter?" ... It didn't. Boxing Day had been calm but a storm was brewing with Sherlock obsessing the entire weekend over a lack of "the work".
And those two boys we still adore
"Nothing, carry on."
"Who..."
"Frequently yes. You think he'll be willing?"
"Gregory is correct. As much as we all wish to see this...demon drawn and quartered we must be armed with knowledge."
"For the case, John! Speaking of which, YOU were the one who insisted I take any case."
For each other they fight and bleed
We were there for thrills and teasin'
"No, NO! Don't any of us want to hear about that!", gurgled the sink.
"Am I naked? Why am I naked? It's freezing in here."
"Oh my, you look so handsome dear."
"I'm allowing for the high probability that my idea of lazy might be more energetic than anticipated."
Anxious to return to Baker Street to investigate just how size proportional the rest of Sherlock was to his feet, John ushered Sherlock out of the filthy drug den to a vivid orange four door Aston Martin parked at the kerb whilst still holding tight to one of Sherlock's shoes.
"Great", he thought, "Sherlock talks to me when I'm not there and I tune Hudders out when I am."
To tell of gay Sherlock and bi John
At that moment their phones began to ping, a photo attachment coming up on both. John just gawped but Sherlock turned ghastly pale and gasped, "Ooohhh Nooooooo!"
"Peculiar way to show it, Watson. Maybe it would have been better if I HAD..."
She shuddered, "It was ghastly. I dreamt that you came home laughing after your latest murder case, all happy. Still not decent if you ask me. At any rate, I was puttering around my flat cheery as can be and fixing a tray for you. But when I went to climb the stairs I had the most terrible pain and dropped the tray. One can never really tell about things in dreams but it seemed that I died. Most frightening though wasn't my death, it was that everything around me - the flat, you - it all faded away as if none of it had ever existed."
"Oh you are a caution, young man. There'll be a full roast dinner later with more presents." With a look of devilment she adds, "Might we even be expecting a birthday spanking?"
Outside the sounds of car horns and people banging on pots and pans began filling the air. "Guess it's time. Happy New Year John."
"Small mercies", John thought, that he had chosen a neighborhood celebration rather than one with throngs of people all vying  for a good view of the fireworks. "In a tic, we have to wait for the right moment- a distraction."
🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
For her part Martha had spent three days preparing not only her feast but insuring that they would have their New Year's Eve supper in something other than a health hazard. The sitting room and kitchen of the boys flat had been scrubbed sparkling clean with an ulterior motive of keeping a motherly eye on Sherlock.
"As you're well aware I hate not know...ohh Jawwwnnn!"
"I can't fancy anything you have to say will be of such import that I need to be..."
Gave us afterglow!
"I quite enjoyed the kiss but I had hoped there would be more."
26th October-
"Not even any fireworks this year. How are we meant to celebrate?"
This set Mrs. Hudson off in another fit of laughter as she snorted, "I guess we should be grateful Molly only gives him bits and bobs and not the entire corpus delicti."
And the name of that ship is Johnlock ya see
Sherlock couldn't help a weak smile, "Are you trying to have your way with us?"
"Exactly the point I was jes makin'."
"Wouldn't think of it."
John snorts, "Well pardon me and excuse you. Alright...probably not dying, sex isn't off the table - might even be ON it, and I'm a kid compared to Her Majesty. Still not youthful though."
"Sounds as if we'll welcome it after the 9th."
The mantel rippled under a bony jaw, "About bloody time we get to have a say about what goes on around here without", it shuddered, "me having to worry about being stabbed every time the post arrives with some 'must keep' papers."
"Not a joke, merely part of the surprise. Honestly, you call ME slow, there's more."
"You can thank Mrs. Hudson as she thought it best to retrieve the two of you before you, in her words 'got up to mischief'. As to this vehicle, she said it was the closest she could come to a pumpkin carriage without arousing undue attention. Bit gaudy for my tastes, but there you have it." Turning to John he nodded in acknowledgment, "From the state of my brother's clothes I deduce your mission was successful."
"Fine. Let's hear it then."
"Don't include me with that downstairs lot.", the seventeen stairs groaned. "I can tell you what it's like being REALLY stomped on I assure you."
"Well, I had thought we'd hang upside down from our chairs but I like YOUR plan."
"Hardly necessary as my brilliance is self congratulatory. Besides, there are better ways to occupy your time."
In the days to come the elf lead his assigned charge on a merry chase, a veritable advent calendar of adventures. Logically, Sherlock knew that John was moving the elf but he was actually reluctant to catch him at it. That simply didn't seem sporting plus which even HE couldn't stop the occasional nap and trips to the loo.
"Not here, John, Florida!"
John saw her safely to 221A and returned to find Sherlock no longer in his sheet. "What's this then?"
John bristled, "Not terribly, ta for asking. Not having the D.T.s if that's what you're asking."
"That's amazing! Since I intend to spend Saturday night licking honey off your entire body I might as well make a profit on Sunday morning when all my teeth fall out. Ka-ching!!"
"Me?! I was the case?"
"Oh for pity's sake, you're one month older than him. If I was truly looking it wouldn't be for another short, greying fellow."
"Seriously?! Did you just make a Harry Potter reference? Never mind, I'll name him myself."
"Technically it hasn't but I'm going out on a limb here and assuming there's a point to this discussion."
"Yeah? What am I meant to be doing then?"
"I am NOT finished but clearly you're not going to allow me to continue, so kindly tell me what nonsense is rattling around in your empty little head and get it over with. Oh and you might as well start with telling me why, besides going to Tesco - BORING-, that you detoured first to New Scotland Yard for a visit with Gabriel and, gag, my brother. Or was  Mycroft just there by accident for a bit of 'afternoon delight'? As if they're fooling anyone when he brings donuts and the D.I. closes his blinds and locks the door? Nauseating!"
Casting a sidewise peek at John, Sherlock sighed, "If it will ease your mind, perhaps I will discuss it. As you are aware I spent the afternoon doing errands for Mrs. Hudson who, quite sensibly I believe, has decided to shelter in place. Obtaining her prescriptions at the Chemist was tedious but tolerable but then there was Tesco."
"Thank you dear", she said putting the last of the food in the fridge, "now who's for a glass of Port?"
"How did you...? Never mind, it's probably a scuff on my shoe or a piece of lint on my jumper."
"We have memorabilia?"
Our love will always grow!
Before Mycroft could answer, Greg spoke up. "My men worked with Myc's people and none of us could track him. It was like every time he left Baker Street he would disappear into thin air. Granted, he only showed himself in the darkest hours before dawn but it's...scary."
Sherlock was beginning to regain his energy but retained no memory of Colsan Wesix or any of their time together. The band of "soldiers" had sworn an oath of secrecy and the terrifying episode was forever buried.
"You can and you MAY."
"Selfishly, I don't think I gave enough thought until today to how not just one person but entire groups can be so devastatingly affected by hurtful actions or words. If anyone was to ever do something like that to our..."
Replacing his mobile in his pocket Mike turned his attention back to the group. "John, Wesix can't be found because he only exists in this realm when he's with Sherlock so Friday night is our earliest chance. Besides there's more."
"Frankly, I think the management was so concerned for the customers that they were more than happy to let them just leave without even paying for anything. I don't think I will ever forget the terrified and hurt looks on the faces of all those people. I couldn't believe my ears, John. Don't these young men have parents or grandparents they care about? We're not talking about demographics John, we're talking about people! We're talking about..." His head dropped into his hands.
The handmade jumper is a rich peacock blue into which is knitted "50 and Fabulous" in gold and silver thread. "It's brilliant, I'll wear it tonight."
Before Sherlock could finish, John slipped the black brogue in place. There was a shower of fairy dust and suddenly Sherlock found himself completely nude save for a pair of blood red patent leather stilettos on his feet.
Wine poured they sat down and Martha, trying to forestall any unpleasantness, served all of them a few bites of everything in an effort to entice and not intimidate their "picky eater".
Hudders rose to make more coffee and John fell into the memories of his worst nightmare.
The lid was slowly removed to reveal a mound of black bubble wrap topped with the Santa Hat. Face clouding over Sherlock snarled, "Your idea of a cruel joke?"
He eagerly waits to see if the latest conspiracy theory is that they are government cyborgs which, admittedly, is not out of the realm of possibility considering Mycroft's involvement in their lives, or that a new and outlandish allegation has arisen that they are, in fact, lizard people. As if his posh boy would EVER tolerate being a reptile. A Bloodhound or cat possibly but not a reptile. His fingers are just closing around the recalcitrant newsprint when a bellow roars from their bedroom.
When the prostate had been reduced to a gelatinous mass that no self respecting pathologist could identify and he had gently but firmly warned Sherlock that, no, he could NOT set it on the windowsill to see what effect heat and humidity had on the remaining sludge, John decided to carpe diem and plunge right in.
"No Martha, you're right. I pay my share of the rent, have a job that requires I sleep and stay healthy and it ISN'T fair that I'm being turned out of the flat like a stray mongrel. Don't know that I'm up to marching but I am going up to MY bed and if the 'lovebirds' don't like it then screw them!"
"And naughty lingerie."
"Of course, but I wouldn't put it past him to try and find a way to make the hens lay square purple eggs and the cow give chocolate flavoured milk. And if you think for one minute that I would EVER consider trying a Sherlock Holmes homemade jock itch cure...no, just no."
Sherlock got up and engulfed her in a warm hug. "You most certainly can, but you don't need to. WE are going to take care of you the way YOU always take care of us. We are going to see this through and I even promise not to shoot the wall or torture my violin. We're family and that's what family does."
"Since forever I think, I was just too much of a coward to admit it to myself much less you. But when you were...sick, yeah I do."
"What have we here? Looks to be black tar and red goo."
Mired in his own thoughts, John didn't realize he had actually made it to the big black door which loomed before him like a Hell Maw rather than a Welcome Mat. He found it unlocked and sighed as he remembered rushing out in such a huff that he hadn't bothered with the lock or his wallet. Note to self: Being a regular at The Beehive allowed him to run a tab- not a bad thing. Unlimited access to "free" alcohol when in a funk- bit not good. He was NOT looking forward to morning.
Blinking rapidly to wake himself, John groaned, "What? House aflame, ninjas hiding in the closet?"
Long will we Johnlockers come
"And you call me slothful! She's right downstairs."
Snorting loudly, John stepped forward to block the path. "Sherlock, love, fetching as you are, you WILL need to put on more than the peg leg sock and the eyepatch."
"Not that I can recall, not that I CAN recall much of anything. I suppose I had my usual soother and...possibly...one or two of the brownies from the batch I made for you. I mean, I know I MUST have made them because what's left of them is wrapped up on my kitchen table. Goodness my memory today!"
For a brief moment John found himself entertaining the fanciful notion that perhaps they'd both been "beamed" into their current positions via The Tardis or a Starship Enterprise transporter. Then he found his voice, "Bit easier to play WITH the violin innit?"
"7th August, first half of the day International Beer Day, second half of the day International Hangover Day which I suspect will carry over to the following day."
"Hoo-hoo, boys. Here's your morning tea and some fresh baked scones. John, be a dear and take the tray will you? I'm afraid I'm somewhat peaky this morning."
"I don't suppose it has escaped your attention that he's stopped gagging and snarking every time he sees you two together. Mycroft? Greg?"
"Of course not love, I'm just disappointed is all. This was meant to be our best Valentine's Day ever."
The countdown to Christmas was now less than a week and the rewards continued.
"Not at my time of life and I think I best text when your guests arrive. We wouldn't want any unexpected surprises. Have fun dears."
"Don't forget, I don't have any memory of my shower a half hour ago but, with your sweet tooth, if Martha made brownies, we ate them. Ah, Martha, is it possible, that is, did you by any chance make a 'special' batch for Mrs. Turner? You know, the 'herbal ones?"
"A gift of love dear with wishes for many more."

Standing on the window sill looking out over Baker Street, a pair of compact but powerful night vision goggles within reach.
"See us here years from now, together?"
"Ideas? What ideas? I don't understand."
"Ship us? Ship us where? They want cases in foreign countries?"
"Course I do, git, but you can't tell me you didn't enjoy it."
"Tell me about it! You weren't the one she chastised for not putting the shopping bags in the recycling."
"Sorry, Billy. This one has no filter."
The fandom swooned and then we swore
To Johnlock we'd be true!
Abruptly the mood turned frantic with Wesix stripping off both of their clothes and throwing Sherlock roughly on the bed. A soft collective gasp filled the office as Sherlock was pounced upon by a predator stalking prey.
"There will only be TWO bodies in our flat that day both alive unless you make me want to murder you."
"Thanks? You're going to smack me fifty times, what do I have to be thankful for?"
"Magic mirror at this hour, carry me into the tower. I wish to see by evening's light that my Sherlock is alright."
That's all ye need to know!
John rises to hug Sherlock when, "Oo-Hoo! Boys, not in your birthday suits are you?"
Monday 21st December - Morning coffee lead to the discovery of the elf clutching a large mug the outside bedecked with two large beehives and the inside having a 3-D honeybee in the bottom surrounded by the phrase "Get Your Buzz On".
"Nothing so intriguing, but I must admit I have been unable to find the elf."
"That", John growled, "was what I saw."
"Not to mention those frankly malevolent eyes, John. Creepy I'd call them."
Seeing his confusion, she spoke. "You once said you would happily remain an owl, dear Gregory, as you had been spurned by your heart's desire. What you could not know is that there had been another child born of the Holmes' before Sherlock. Mycroft was raised by the father of our cruel King Jim without care and he vowed to never permit himself to feel."
"Says the ALPHA MALE top!"
"Sherlock."
"Is that so? What makes you think I will comply?"
"You'll do no such thing! I only agreed to your picking a tradition if it wasn't boring. This bedraggled doll is beyond boring." So saying Sherlock picked up the elf by one boot as if it were contagious and pitched it towards the trash basket in the corner.
Upstairs John scrambled to place the spy cam. Scanning Sherlock's room as if he were doing military recon, he zeroed in on the Periodic Table hanging beside the bed. Placing the device at the correct angle and height would give a clear picture of the bed's occupants. Pushing aside his distaste and feeling more than a bit like a traitor he sought out the best spot.
"It is. We've been chatting almost since I moved in."
"Well aware, 27th August?"
"Obviously. However it appears you are correct about the tons of merchandise. Dear Lord, those Funko dolls are outrageous! No one's head is that big. Well perhaps Mycroft's, but really John!"
"You are a TERRIBLE joke teller."
Martha sighed, "He's so pale and thin and...I don't have the words- disconnected as if he's in a daze."
"BORRRRED!"
"My foster mother. Make haste, John, our clothes. She scales the tower swiftly as a spritely maiden."
"Heavens no! I prefer my men much younger than you two."
"So, take my advice, John, and march yourself right up those stairs and reclaim your home!" Her kindly but firm voice jarred John back to the present.
The picture of innocence, John sauntered from the kitchen and hummed, "Hmm?"
To tell of gay Sherlock and bi John
John reached out and took his landlady's small hand. "Martha, we don't know what we might see. If you'd be more comfortable stepping out..."
"Everything hurts. Even my anus hurts, why in hell would my anus hurt?"
He felt himself blush as Hudders giggled, "Maybe a different turn of phrase, dear."
👹⚔️👹⚔️👹⚔️👹⚔️
"Don't be rude John, I have a guest."
"Woo hoo. Boys!" At seeing them cozy in John's chair she smiled with delight. "Oh aren't you two darling."
"True, but I have a dead weight holding me down at the moment."
"I SEE that I am fortunate to to have you to catalogue and explain the mundane to me, John. Again, anything not BORING?!"
Sherlock and John in London Town
"Are you listening to me young man? This must stop! I don't like it anymore than you that Sherlock is running around with that...that MAN, but you can't be going out getting blind drunk every time they do. You'll ruin your health, chase away the friends who've put up with you so far and not solve a blasted thing. After all, where does that nose in the air knob get off pushing you out of your own flat? Doesn't he have a place to take Sherlock when they want to have a hump?"
"Better than bend over and cough, besides you love it."
Murmurs of agreement rumbled throughout the flat.
A soft murmur behind them broke the reverie. "It's been a fantastic evening dears but I'm afraid I'll not be seeing midnight except in my dreams. I will however be collecting New Year's hugs and kisses tomorrow."
"Remind me NOT to delete that factoid. 29th August, Bat Night."
🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮🏰🔮
"A Study in Pink, you berk. Thing is I can't wrap things up because there's a part of the case you failed to resolve."
John jumped to his feet knocking over a small table with a crash. "I'll stop him! I'll kill him with my bare hands!"
"Not very scientific but close enough. All you need to know is it's yours to catapult."
Let it be known that the E rated photo came out in glorious detail. However Hudders was considerate enough NOT to have that one reproduced in poster size and discreetly displayed it in pride of place away from prying eyes and those who might wish to steal it. And while she was sure the candid snap would be a huge hit with the blog fans, she will be keeping it for her own enjoyment.
Slightly rattled, he turned to see Sherlock, draped in his favourite sheet, standing at the sitting room window with his arms poised to play his violin. Again, unremarkable save for the fact that the Strad was on the other side of the room still in its case.
"If it rains?"
"Credit where credit is due, Lock. The 'Boomers' and the 'Silent Generation' before them are made of strong stuff. They survived the Great Depression, wars, societal and political upheaval and the hardest thing of all- just getting older."
"Yes you were definitely right on that score. Then again I doubt we have to worry though. Hudders hardly seems the type for such childish shenanigans."
John grunted trying to balance laptop and lap full. "Be that as it may, I am going to reply to these comments and you are going to sit quietly and behave."
"Especially the walls.", the smiley face frowned. "And I have the added 'bonus' of bullet holes!"
"Not MY fault YOU decided to sneak the bags from the 'Man Handled Sex Shoppe' to the bins. I wanted to burn them."
Then came the day when gathering herbs and flowers, brewing potions and casting spells detained the witch from her 'visit' to the tower until the moon was rising.
John snorted and began laughing so hard he came close to tumbling off the sofa to the floor. "That's putting him in his place, Martha."
John suggested they enjoy the feast but Sherlock was having nothing of that. "You promised me a surprise, deliver please."
The digestif for their Full English was a leisurely snogging session followed by enthusiastic shower sex. Afterwards, with much less enthusiasm, they dressed.
"Indeed. 31st August, Eat Outside Day. An intimate picnic in Regent's Park on the Japanese Garden Island will be the perfect conclusion to our celebrations and we will be totally undisturbed."
"Would you mind coming to me instead, my legs seem not to be connected to my brain at the present."
"Sherlock, if you're finished for now I'd like to talk to you."
We'll take our leave and go.
Sherlock grinned, "I like them! Makes my 'friend' look like a rakish vampire."
"What the bloody hell Sherlock?!"
One of Mycroft's minions chose that moment to appear with the DVD.
"26th August, Adopt A Dog Day."
"At least they are exhibiting a modicum of of good taste."
The mirror screeched in such anguish that Gregory left his perch in the trees and flew to investigate.
Although shaken and exhausted, he found sleep would not come. He hadn't cried out in disgust but rather in horror because in that brief moment before he was discovered John had seen...what the buggering fuck HAD he seen? Or did he see it?
She gently took Gregory's arm, "Place your hand into the mirror and bid your soulmate come to you."
Oh there is a ship best ship thar be
The old woman came to stand before them glowing with an aura of lavender all around her. She touched both Owl and mirror and in a puff of smoke Gregory was made flesh once more. A handsome man with a beautiful smile, strands of silver hair and his uniform untouched.
🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊
"What?"
"Couldn't hurt, besides I'm thirsty." What John really wanted however was to preserve the frankly adorable letter. Quickly placing it in his wallet, he sealed a blank page in an envelope and lit the fire.
John arrived in the flat just in time to see a woman, wildly swinging a formidable looking hammer, about to crack Sherlock in the head as he fell to his knees in an effort to protect his violin. In seconds John subdued her, none too gently, and two of the coppers permanently assigned to patrol the area around Baker Street (thanks to Mycroft) cuffed and took her away.
"Jawwwn- what ARE you doing?", Sherlock whined flopping into John's lap narrowly missing the laptop perched on his knees.
Feigning innocence Sherlock purrs, "Whatever do you mean, John? 9th August, Book Lover's Day. We will be exploring the Kama Sutra. Be sure to stretch."
"Oh no you don't!", shrieked the kettle. "We're not done in here. How about me? My poor bottom is sore all the time from that confounded Watson always slamming me down on the counter in a fit of pique at his Holmes."
"Yes, yes ad nauseam! I know, John, DON'T TOUCH THE ELF!"
You well might ask then, what became of evil King Jim? Legend has it that one day he disappeared never to be seen again. However, should you happen upon this Kingdom and find yourself in Mrs. Hudson's magic garden, go to the pond. There you will find a school of the most glorious goldfish resplendent in the brightest of gleaming orange hues. They spend their days swimming lazily around the fountain at its center.
"Indeed John! Nice of you to volunteer your reheating skills."
"Ah I see, you think you're clever do you? Alright. Then my choice is 'He whose name must not be spoken.' Satisfied?"
Bumping his side as much as her hip would allow, she smiled. "I have a few ideas but I think it's best you discover them for yourself."
"Yes, yes, conversation, so you said. Carry on then, converse, get on with it."
Just then 221B came into view. As soon as they stepped inside it was immediately apparent that danger was afoot. From upstairs a loud crash was followed by the sounds of a shrieking woman. Dropping the bags, John tore up the stairs as Martha, always prepared, tapped the Bluetooth in her ear summoning the police.
"There will DEFINITELY be a birthday spanking", Sherlock smirks.
"Yes we've established that. What about it?"
Grabbing Sherlock around the waist John planted a sloppy kiss on his lips leaving him with a goofy besotted expression on his face. "I pronounce you fully recovered and will do everything in my power to see that you never fall 'ill' like that ever again. I'm going to make it my business to protect you and all our family and friends always. And speaking of friends, we need to see Mike Stamford more often."
"Or trying on the naughty lingerie."
"Love machine", scoffed the wardrobe startling the jumpers and bespoke suits who clung to each other for comfort, "you're only another piece of furniture except you squeak and bang which frankly annoys the hell out of the rest of us!"
"Wait, think of it as a case, a puzzle to solve. Right up our street innit?"
Martha Hudson was as protective of Sherlock as a mother grizzly bear so her warm acceptance of John Watson as "her boy's" new flatmate was a pleasant surprise even to her. The doctor just seemed so...normal. Sherlock and normal were two words she had never expected to put in the same sentence but there it was. Goodness, John was polite, appreciative and even ran errands for her. More than once she wondered if her herbal soothers were a tad too strong and Watson was actually a figment of her imagination. Well, if he was, her hallucination just knocked on her door with not one but two bottles of milk and, charmingly, a bouquet of flowers.
“Mycroft!” John’s earlier irritation is bubbling up. He takes a breath.
“Gloves?”
They arrived in  East Staffordshire village just as dusk was just beginning to fall.   "Sherlock…"  John protested.   "Really, this is…"   What could he add to the protests he'd already lodged?  Sherlock wasn't listening, never listened when he got something in his head.
“I know.”
written for Watson Woes JWP #13 Blank Slate
Mycroft nods but does not look comforted.
John frustration is mounting but visiting hours were almost over. He could go in at any time but if he has any hope of getting Mycroft in there in the next four hours he has to go now. “I’m going to tell him you’re a coward. Do you want him to hear that?”
“It’s not.”   John answers but Mycroft is gone.
"I know."  Mycroft nods, “If you change your mind….”
“Dramatic sighs,” John nods, knowingly.
"And I am his partner."  Mycroft adds as he steps towards Lestrade's room.
“I understand you aren’t concerned about him, but…”
John reconsiders the throttling.
10:02 am.
John nearly chokes.
"A tranquilizer."
"I left him in your care, Mr. Holmes. I let you both be.  Now he's broken.  I think you've done more than enough."
“Are you lying?”
“Yes.”
“My parents married…”  John shook his head.  “No, they were married 5 years before Harriet came along.”
"In your own time then."  John mutters, a slight edge of worry disguised as bitterness.  "Like always."
"The cafeteria is right downstairs."  John reminds him as they walked out of the doors that separated the most critical patients from the rest of the floor.
“41st”
Sherlock stood on the ledge watching John below.  He knew his death would break John's heart.
Sherlock quickened his pace.
“Of course you do.”
Mycroft leads the group down one hall, up another, up two floors on the lift, and then around a corner.
"She needn't. Before she left she made us enough food to last until New Years, and we did agree to celebrate with her today."
Long will the Johnlockers come

Monday 28th December -
"None of that now. Doctor remember? The skitters or giving a prostate exam, all the same to me."
"I do if you do." He stretched with a groan, "Nearly midnight and I'm not regretting us having no noisemakers as I'm sensing a possible hangover on the horizon to christen the New Year."
"You're being unfair, I did say it was for a case."
He set about describing what they were up against. "Explains a lot actually. Wesix never seen in daylight, his lack of traceable whereabouts and his hypnotic influence over Sherlock. The physical and mental deterioration is the result of their encounters. Incubi are either blood or memory takers, Wesix seemingly the latter. If not stopped he will drain Sherlock until nothing remains but a shell.
Right then. He was back at the flat but he was damned if he would go upstairs. No, he'd just make himself comfortable on the floor of the entryway and...
Discreetly clearing his throat Mycroft began. "While the footage is being readied for viewing I must report that, to my frustration, I was unable to compile any information on Colsan Wesix. No internet or paper trail, no residence of record. For all intents and purposes he does not exist."
Seething, Sherlock threw open the back door of the car to confront not Mycroft but the elf sitting in a basket which was secured by a seatbelt and cushioned by several packages. The handle of the basket had a note attached which read, "You MAY touch the basket."
"Never could get a word in edgewise, blabbermouth."
"Battleship and The Game of Operation were the newest game crazes. War and Medicine? The universe is rarely so lazy."
"I'm convinced."
"Or that Sherlock and I just suddenly were 'dropped into' our own existence like something 'invented' us, bit not good."
"Agreed, but that's obviously not what's really bothering you, and before you ask, I know you well enough to figure that out for myself. Want to talk about it?"
"Right there with you, love. I don't remember going to bed or showering. Something is definitely...hold on. Sherlock, did you drug us last night?"
It seemed William had made quite a study of Sherlock's interests. He next appeared inside the fridge holding a large rubber toe that was tagged "Good for one body part from the morgue. 😺Assistant Elf Molly😽"
"Yes, yes, once again, basically fond. Not done yet. Telly : Coronation Street, Doctor Who, Benny Hill and, perhaps most precognitive, Upstairs Downstairs. I'm guessing seventeen of them. What I'm saying is your fate was predetermined in 1971. It was a maelstrom of events that shaped who you are and that shape, John Hamish Watson, is perfect."
"Think morning wood, love, and envision the rest of the days activities from there."
"I'm hurt, John. You know I promised I wouldn't do that anymore. So no I didn't...or I don't think I did and IF I did I didn't mean to. My brain is like Swiss cheese presently."
"Never you mind. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you love."
"Not going to smack you that hard, beautiful, but your posh, pretty, gorgeous arse can still be thankful that I'm not turning 💯. Happy Birthday to me!!"
"Not THAT pain in the arse and don't try to change the subject. I kept up my end of the bargain, now you have to keep yours and remember - no touching the elf."
BUT til their fuckin' IS done
Sherlock groaned and John was instantly by his side. "Ooh, John, John are you here?"
"Sounds sweet to me."
"Barnacle Bill the Sailor is an old sea shanty. I thought Bill - William and you ARE a barnacle sometimes, hanging on being a right pain in my arse."
"Admirable work ethic and I guess you would call it sentiment."
"Happy as I am to be going out, especially with you, unless your surprise is a gruesome murder..."
Making a face as if he was sucking a lemon, Mycroft warned, "No you REALLY don't. In point of fact I strongly suggest you refrain from any more details that could possibly cause me to crash the car."
As they began to undress John kissed Sherlock again but then cocked his head, his expression somewhat perplexed. "Funny thing that. There's nothing now sweetheart but for a moment there it DID sound for all the world like the whole flat was crying."
John leans forward now entranced by his adorably dorky, yet completely serious spouse.
Feigning disinterest, Sherlock sniffs, "I'll be sure to take a survey later."
"Greg!"
"Not on me dear, but I dare say he'd love rubbing off on you", she said with a wink.
"No Scotland's Florida. Of course America's Florida. There is some sort of university spring break tradition there and students are basically ignoring all protocols for safety. Disgusting!"
"12th August..."
"The light becomes you.", whispered the purple dildo. "Makes you look rather fetching."
"Love I seriously doubt we have to worry much about that. The weather is hardly conducive to..."
John doesn't know whether to laugh or cry as seemingly every vertebrae in his back, both knees and ankles pop, crack and complain as he bends to retrieve the section of newspaper that has floated from the arm of his chair to the carpet. It's the 'celebrity' pages of the dreaded Daily Mail which is highly entertaining and has the added benefit of annoying Sherlock. It's a guilty pleasure for John as he searches for mentions of Hatman and Robin.
John ground his hard length into Felipe’s bare backside. The man groaned and pushed back against him.
“Sherlock, come with me,” he managed to say through gritted teeth.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and sighed. “Now I'll never fall asleep.”
Sherlock let John roll him gently onto his side facing out, his solid arm embracing Sherlock's chest, still holding him close. His tender lips sucked marks into the pale flesh of his neck as his thick palm pulled firmly on Sherlock's hardening cock. Sherlock could feel John's erection pressed against his coccyx, and he heard himself moan as he reached behind him to grip the back of John's muscled thigh.
He paced the room like a jungle cat ready to pounce.
---------------
“I’m usually not one for desserts,” remarked Felipe.  “Apparently London works up one’s appetite for new things.”
With his eyes glistening by the lamplight, he opened the box and pulled out a lovely, chestnut-colored violin.
He whipped the brace into the pond with all his strength. It landed in the water with a satisfying splash.
The man began to cough and then groan. John got out of bed and went to fetch the man some water. He took the cup gratefully from John’s hands and swallowed it down.
He licked his swollen lips, and waited for John to let him up.
He quickly packed up his violin and music and ducked out the back door.
They all took a seat at a table beside the wall. They were served ale and Fritz and Friederich guzzled generously. Sherlock didn’t touch his. He seemed to be completely fascinated by his surroundings.
“Where were you arguing?”
The doctor’s stupefied expression was so comical that Marie had to turn away for fear of giggling outright.
He gingerly stepped over the mutt as he walked into the lobby. A small bell rang above his head, signaling his entrance.
“Just...foreign,” he confessed.
"Yeah, well I don’t really care," said John, his eyes flashing. "Who is he?" he growled.
John at first hid the telegram from Sherlock, but it was little use in trying to keep a secret from the man. By that afternoon, Sherlock had already sent a letter to the Alnwicks to request an extended visit.
“What’s that?” grunted Sherlock, as he pushed open the brick door with his shoulder.
“What, John? What? Pray tell, what is it I'm doing to you that is soooo terrible?” Sherlock howled. He threw his arms out, mocking him.
“I’m originally from Luss, but was in service with the Marquess of Berwick for most of my life before I entered the army,” answered John politely. He shovelled more soup into his mouth.
Sherlock squeezed by John, his thighs brushing against the young doctor's backside. He sat on the bed with his back against the wall and tried to appear relaxed, though his heart was beating in his ears.
The Spaniard looked up from his journal and removed his spectacles. HIs large, brown eyes twinkled as he managed a small smile. He rose from his chair and extended his hand.
"Sherlock, don't," he said. "We don't have the equipment, and there's no telling how far down that tunnel goes."
“The Holmes family is once again indebted to you. You saved our father’s life in the war, and now you’ve saved the heir of this estate, my son. I will be forever grateful.”
The wind whipped against the building, rattling the window panes. John caught sight of Mr Thomas in the window, the shadow distorting his image, making him look like some sort of…
“I think you should rest, sir,” said John, helping him to lie back.
“Tell me, love, who are we chasing that makes us leave our comfortable home in the wee hours of the morning?” John squeezed his hand. “I was looking forward to bed.”
John, in response, looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. “I hope I didn’t offend,” he said softly.
“Peter!” he shouted. “I need your rope!”
“Very impressive, Dr. Watson,” said the matriarch. “Glad you could join us. Have you ever been to this part of the England?”
-------------------------------------------
“I’ve just received word that my father is ill and I must go to Glasgow this night.”
The cook entered her kitchen, and she took one look at Sherlock and the flame and shouted, “Lord Sherlock, what have I told you about using my gas line for your experiments! What good is it for me to have a new stove to cook your supper if you're constantly interrupting my heat?”
He knew he’d promised John to never go down there alone. But desperate times called for desperate measures.
Donovan, who had just walked out of the guardhouse, reached down and touched the substance, rubbing it through his fingers in front of the light.
And could Brook be the murderer?
“I’ve not...been with anyone. Since my wife -,” Felipe stuttered.
“Right behind you,” answered Sherlock, as they both quickly turned around to head back to the door. In his haste, however, Sherlock bumped the bookshelf, and several books clattered to the floor.
He slid down against a concrete slab and lit a cigarette. Smoke curled from his lips and streamed out of his nose. He reached up and touched the tender bump still swelling on the top of his head.
John managed a small smile. “You’re recovering, it’s good.”
“Don’t mention it,” he’d muttered. “And call me ‘Watson’.”
John’s words surprised even himself.
“Never again.”
“Not really,” said Holmes. “I know the area. The Duke and Duchess of Alnwick are good friends of the family.” Holmes noticed the curiosity in John’s eyes, so he elaborated.  “I am the Earl of Cornwall and Viscount of Land’s End.”
Sherlock spilled all over John’s hand, and suddenly the thrusts were slicker and warmer and
“No, they can do nothing for him. It’s better we take him home.”
The man removes his jacket and hangs it leisurely on the coat rack. He steps back and shove his hands in the pockets of his black trousers. His shirt and shoes are as dark and impeccable as his pants, and his ebony eyes sparkle as he takes in the young man in front of him.
“Take the stairs up to the garret. Watch your step,” then looking at Sherlock added. “And your head.”
“Here,” he said.
Sherlock glared at him as he twirled the brandy glass on his knee. John reached forward and snatched the snifter. He slammed it on the table between them.
Victor laughed, but he was not amused. He rubbed his eyes with his uninjured hand, then pounded the table. “I hate that man, so…” He drank the rest of his ale, and wiped his mouth. “He broke my arm. After the first performance,” he said, looking directly at Sherlock.
“Inspector Donovan,” greeted John before looking up.
Then shouldst thou sucke my sweete and my faire flower,
“Show me,” he whispered, leaning back, taking in Sherlock spread out before him.
Was it a lie of omission? What good would it do to tell William that he and Sherlock were lovers? As different as the two men seemingly were, William could now prefer the company of the fairer sex.
John slept in the next morning, a bit depressed after his meeting with Felipe. Later that afternoon, he wandered for hours along the worn paths around the town before returning to the inn.
He squeezed the nipple
John's tumultuous childhood is explored as well as his time in the military, where his separation from Sherlock takes it's toll on both their lives.
“We have, Holmes. But Dr. Watson here told me you’ve lost your memory?”
John stood silently, waiting to be addressed. The marchioness continued to sip her tea, obviously in no hurry to get on with whatever she had summoned John to discuss.
“An investment. I'm investing in this place. In your product. In you.”
William took a step forward as their clothes brushed together.
“John?”
Irene shot him a dirty look. Sherlock ignored her.
"I wanted to be a published romance novelist by the age of 23," said Mrs. Hudson dreamily. "Then when that didn't happen, I pushed it to 30. Then to 40."
John ran his thumb carefully over the delicate stitching. Mrs. Hudson had used royal blue thread.
Mrs. Hudson gasped with anticipation. "And...?"
“I'd never make you stay here,” he whispered. “I understand now. There are places we can go.”
As did his uncle.
It was then that Brook suddenly waved the baton, the players uncharacteristically slow to stop playing, since everything had sounded rather perfect.
“What’s all this?” asked John, as Felipe released the wagon brake and flicked the reigns.
A loud BANG made him jerk so hard he almost dropped his instrument. He looked up, and realized Brooks has left. The door had been slammed shut. Sherlock was alone.
“Good,” said John. He subtly licked his lips.
Wiggins laid back down, hands behind his head. “I can’t prove it. And I don’t really want to since I’m almost out of here. But I think he’s a fake.”
He reached over the shorter man and closed the door to the bedroom. His long fingers threaded through the back of John’s hair as he slowly massaged his scalp.
Mycroft, however, pays no attention to the onlookers.
"I know." Mycroft nods.  "All too well, I know."
John wanted to protest that he never would have killed, but he knows it is a lie.  He hates himself and he hungers for it.   The human and the wolf pulling him in opposite directions.  Everything hurts.   "You want to kill me now… in that bath."
"You shout me."
"Not to kill. I promise you. To keep you from killing.  But never to kill you."
“Yes.”
"I'll be home soon. Forget me not."
“A few hours ago you were ready to out yourself to queen and country.”
Mycroft smiles sadly at the nurse and barely whispers, “please.”
“Little late for that,” She focuses her attention on her injured son, “I don’t want him to be alone.”
"Surely," John sighs.
Pain ripped through him.   He fired again.
"Never."
John knows he brought the nurses attention back around and he thinks he might deserve whatever punishment Mycroft deems worthy for this all too abrupt interruption.
