“It would have gone faster had I returned to Heaven,” Castiel admits. “Filtering energy through a vessel takes effort. Also, although Heaven’s power is mighty, the further you are, the longer it takes to travel.”
The demon looks at him and grins. “Now, why would I do that? See, I think I have the upper hand here, actually. All I have to do is squeeze,” he says, “and this little wayward seraph will do anything I want. For starters, he’s going to put away that lovely little blade.”
Which is when Dean remembers that, oh yeah, just because a monster has a name doesn’t mean it isn’t a monster, and he fires.
Fortunately, this room only has one king-sized bed. Dean had laughed about it when the clerk apologetically told them it was the only room left and Castiel had freaked the clerk out by saying
And then he raises one hand, palm facing the ghost, and a little spark detaches from the fires dancing around him and ignites like a mini fireball. The ghost shrieks and bursts into flames, and a roaring bonfire erupts from the grave, reaching high into the sky, above the tree line. Dean’s not sure how much of that is because of the copious gasoline he used and how much is just because Castiel is a phoenix, but it’s definitely a sight worth seeing, even if he has to blink away spots in his vision.
“I’m not. Uh. Good. At this kind of stuff,” Dean says, kind of lamely. “But I’d like to try. For you. With you. You know. If you want me too?”
This time, when Sam bursts into howls of laughter, Dean kicks him in the shin on the way to the bathroom.
“So,” Dean says, “I got some stuff to say, Cas. You better put your listening ears on. Or listening wings, whatever.”
The wind really picks up then, howling like a tornado is coming, and the trees groan and shudder around him. It gets so strong that even the bowl and Dean’s bag are lifted off the ground and go flying into the trees, and Dean’s resulting curse is lost amidst the noise.
So Dean tries again. “I don’t want that, Cas,” he says softly. “I don’t want that on my hands or my conscience.”
, there is one person in the entire damn universe who might not leave Dean high and dry like every other member of his family.
The last time it twinged was when Castiel shoved him to the cold, hard floor. It’s not a happy memory.
Castiel leans down again, probably to kiss Dean again, but he stops abruptly when an alarm sounds. They both check their pockets, but Dean’s robe is empty and Castiel’s phone has no alerts. It takes a bit of digging, but Dean eventually finds his phone, abandoned on the nightstand and plugged into the charger. It had come out of the Empty with only 1% of battery left even though it was fully charged before he went in, and Dean’s pretty sure it’s a lost cause now.
Dean yawns and presses close. Castiel still doesn’t really understand why Dean makes him take off his shirt when they go to bed, but the first time Dean whipped off his own shirt, his eyes went huge and he stopped protesting.
Dean shrugs casually. “Oh, you know. Bit of blood, bit of magic, bit of celestial energy. No biggie.”
“Listen, your soulmate has no manners, and you better get used to it,” Dean tells him, closing his eyes.
Dean bites his lip. “That’s . . . a lot more than a werewolf normally takes,” he mutters. He prods tentatively at the seriously savaged body. “Maybe it is a – Cas, what are you doing?”
“No wonder God wanted to wipe you out.” The Shadow sighs. “Normally, this is when I would fling you out of the nearest portal powered by your soul. But nooooooooooooo. Castiel
Castiel scowls. “It’s real, I assure you. Unlike yours. And no, not everyone in the FBI knows, but there is a division specifically to handle supernatural cases. I was actually celebrating being promoted to join that division when we . . . met,” he says, voice full of meaning.
Castiel huffs quietly and slides close, pressing against Dean’s side and folding one gorgeous wing around Dean’s back. Dean presses back against it automatically, half because he still can’t believe his luck and half because he’s always hungry to be close to Castiel.
Dean shuts his mouth. He can give Castiel this. He can take Castiel’s last words and memorize them. One day, in the far future, they might not even hurt to think about when he’s alone and drunk in a bar.
“For you, always,” Castiel says, because he’s sappy like that sometimes. He brushes a wing down Dean’s arm, where his feather rests, and hums in satisfaction at the resulting spark of warmth. “If you need me, pray.”
“So, I guess you might want an update,” Dean says. “Uh, so, important stuff first: we defeated God. The old God, anyways. Chuck’s human now – Jack sucked all of his power out. It was kinda awesome. Chuck did blow up Michael, though. So now I guess we have no more archangels. And Jack brought everyone back that Chuck poofed. Because Jack is God now. Kinda. He likes to drop by for movie night and eat that really terrible sugary cereal. Oh, and Eileen and Sam . . .”
Castiel, the bastard, isn’t even out of breath when he snaps, “Stop struggling. I’m not going to hurt you, Dean.”
Since Dean has already eaten and Castiel doesn’t eat unless Dean shoves food at him, they go directly to bed. Castiel still watches him all night like a stalker, but Dean finally coaxed him into sharing a bed because firstly, it was giving Dean a crick in his neck to talk to Castiel when he would sit up or stand and secondly, well, the cuddling’s nice. Nothing – not even memory foam – can compare to being wrapped up in Castiel’s wings, like the warmest, fluffiest, silkiest blanket.
Dean sighs and looks at the way he came. He marked the trees, and he could always pack everything up and go back – but go back to what? Sam’s gone, his dad’s likely going to make a break for it as soon as he wakes up, like he always does, and then Dean’ll just be staring at the wall and going out of his mind. Again. And this time, Sam won’t come back after he cools off. If there’s one person Dean knows inside and out, it’s Sam, and he’s never seen Sam so angry. He knows Sam meant it, when he said he’d leave, and he also knows that John bellowing that he shouldn’t come back would only cement Sam’s determination.
“No,” Castiel says, face open and smiling. “When it became clear I had a human soulmate, one of my brothers fashioned a vessel for me, in preparation for the day I would walk alongside you. I did request some genetic material from my bloodline, so that this vessel could properly contain me, but this body is mine and mine alone. I did not take any person from their family, Dean.”
Then Dean shifts to talking about the bunker. Sam did . . . something to help them get back to full power after Jack restored to the cosmic level warding, so they keep finding new cool rooms. There’s a fully functional greenhouse, a forge and workshop, and, of course, more rooms with ten thousand books.
Plus, the kid never texted Dean. And he always texts Dean. Habit, for hunters. Otherwise your family thinks you kicked it and died.
Castiel raises an arm – and then stops. It looks like he hits an invisible wall, and when he presses hard against it, his hand doesn’t move an inch. And Dean has seen Castiel lift a car with one hand without any effort.
“Nope,” Dean says, dodging Castiel’s hand. “No, nope, I am not sober enough for this kind of thing. You don’t just – just say things like that!”
Dean throws himself to the side as the creature blows past the spot where he was. It smells truly awful and it’s snarling like a motor engine, landing on all fours like a cat and baring misshapen teeth at Dean.
“I suppose grace would register as warmth to human skin,” Castiel says, which explains exactly nothing, but the smile is back on his face, and his wings shimmer back to that gorgeous array of blacks and purples and greens. He turns himself around and one of his wings arcs towards Dean, curving to a stop just in front of his knees. “Would you like to touch them?”
“So, if I check out Victim Number Two – bingo!” Sam crows, clicking into a database. “Yep, she used to babysit at that place too – ”
, wings whipping up a mini tornado of papers, eyes glowing bright blue, palm grasping the smoke and forcing it mercilessly back into Brady.
Castiel looks up then, and Dean is once again reminded what it’s like to be the full focus of those brilliant blue eyes. It kind of makes him want to roll over and show his belly. Among other things. In fact, he almost misses Castiel answering him over the thundering of his own traitorous heart.
Dean shrugs. “I mean, I’m the seeing is believing type, and you saw Cas,” Dean points out. “Hard to deny what he is. Also he’s pretty clear about what he is if you ask him.”
Plus: “Cas can fly anywhere on Earth in like the blink of an eye. If you need me, I’ll be here,” Dean promises.
“I guess at least we aren’t caked in filth and blood this time,” Dean muses. “I had to shower so much, even the second time. Hey, maybe you can angel mojo us both clean this time. I’ve got stuff to say to you.”
Jess nods, probably because after being told about demons and vampires and werewolves, angels must not seem farfetched, but Sam – Sam leans forward and narrows his eyes and levels an accusing finger at Dean.
It is a feather. And not one of the loose, unhealthy ones that Dean plucked out. This one is vibrant and beautiful, gleaming from the top to the bottom, green as vibrant as an emerald, purple as deep as an amethyst. When he shifts his hand a little bit, specks of color dance across the space between them, like stars glinting in the darkness of their own little universe, cocooned with Castiel’s wings.
Castiel’s wings tense. Dean has always known they were strong, as invincible and unyielding as Castiel himself, but there’s knowing that fact in the back of his mind and there’s feeling the feathers lock up like an immovable stone blanket pinning him to the bed. Dean would probably have better luck clawing into the mattress to escape than pushing that wing off of him.
Unfortunately, it is apparently turning out to be a cloudy day, because even though Dean’s internal clock tells him the sun should be well and truly above the horizon, the daylight is muted and the air is cold.
He goes over their family in his head again. Updates on Sam, check. Updates on Eileen, check. Updates on Jack? Whoops.
Hell, after last night, Dean probably isn’t going to be even a minority of people. He can imagine the number of hunters who have mothers who died when they were kids, fathers who became hunters and dragged said kids all over the country, and little brothers who had a knockout incoherent screaming match and stormed out promising to never return probably can be counted on one hand.
It shouldn’t help, this reminder of how gone they are for each other, but it does, somehow. It gives Dean the strength to turn his face into Castiel’s palm and plant a tiny kiss on the skin there, a silent
Unfortunately, the brat still hasn’t called or texted Dean back, and Dean’s done trying to reach out. He knows Sam made it safely to Stanford, thanks to his phone’s GPS, but he also knows Sam probably needs a lot longer to cool off. And if he misses out on Castiel, well, that’s what he gets for not responding when Dean texted him about something cool.
Dean shuffles his feet. It’s one thing to discuss the supernatural with those in the know, but with civilians who don’t it’s a whole other ballgame. And Dean hates being the one who has to give the Talk.
After Dean pokes him a few times, in both his wing and his side, Castiel begrudgingly explains. “He attempted to expel me back to Heaven, but without my vessel. It took a great deal of my strength to resist the banishment, and more so to keep my hold upon this vessel.” He pauses. “The incantation was very rudimentary. Effective, of course, but not eloquent. I suppose the best equivalent would be using a very blunt knife to hack at a plant until one has separated the root from the stalk. It was very unpleasant.”
Sam knows a serious threat when he hears one, so he snaps Dean a mocking salute and gets out of the car. And yeah, Dean isn’t exactly raring to go stare at some gory corpses, but sometimes questioning civilians is way, way worse. At least most of the police officers leave them alone when they go digging in files. But sitting here moping won’t accomplish anything, so Dean puts the car into gear and heads back to the motel. Even if he doesn’t find out anything, at least there will be burgers tonight and that’s enough to put any man in a good mood.
The kitchen is nice and homey. There are novelty mugs on the counter, mismatched plates in the sink, a dirty saucepan abandoned on the stove. It’s not quite the apple pie life, but Dean can see that Sam would love it, even if he probably bangs his head on the doorway every time.
With each word and step, Dean gets closer to the portal. It’s grown in size now, tall and slender, just enough for an adult human man to squeeze through. Dean knows without being told that it will suck, but also that it will bring them home.
There’s no acknowledgement, but the memory of purgatory still sits heavily in Dean’s gut. Castiel showed him the truth – touched his mind and accessed his real memories – but sometimes when Dean dreams, he sees both: Castiel ripping his arm away, bitter regret on his face, and Castiel falling out of his hands, screaming his name, panic all over his features.
He’s halfway through the blissful mouthful of warm, syrup-drenched pancake when he hears Castiel make a very strange sound.
All at once, Dean feels completely wide awake, energized and alert, all his aches gone, all his needs satisfied. It’s like eating a full course dinner without the bellyache and drinking a whole case of beer without the intoxication. It’s amazing.
“You have a . . . baby?” Castiel pronounces the word like it’s a foreign concept and not, like, the beginning stage for every human being. It’s adorable, and Dean should not find it adorable, but he does.
“If you stay, I stay,” Dean calls out. “We aren’t doing this again.” He swallows hard, the memory of that ticking clock flashing in front of his eyes. “I would’ve stayed. In purgatory. If I hadn’t found you. Did you know that? I was gonna stay. I didn’t – I couldn’t leave you behind. Not again. And I – I never told you. What I had to say down there. I know you said you heard my prayer but that – that wasn’t all of it, Cas. Not by a long shot.”
“Shut up!” the Shadow roars, and hits him again so he goes sprawling on his back. “Shut up, shut up,
Which is when Castiel pulls a very familiar-looking laminated badge from his trench coat pocket. Except for the bit where his is actually official.
Castiel shrugs. “You know as well as I do that you have unhealthy eating habits, so it is the truth.” He pauses. “But I do not think you will desist even if I ask, so I have cleared your arteries. And restored your liver.”
Dean volunteers to do the dishes, mostly because Jess looks like she wants a word with Sam and Dean has no intention of getting in the middle of that. He waves a cheery goodbye to his glaring brother and turns his attention to the sink, whistling a faint tune as he scrubs at the pans and mugs and utensils. It’s a familiar routine, washing up after Sam, and Dean even goes and fetches the dirty pan off the stove and some of the mugs cluttering up the living room. When he passes by, he notices that the smoldering demon corpse is gone, so he sends up a quiet thank you to Castiel as he heads back to the kitchen.
Castiel cups his face with one hand. The other finds Dean’s shoulder, firm and steady. It’s good, it’s right, it’s grounding and it’s what Dean needs, because it means Castiel isn’t leaving.
Castiel takes one look at the article and makes a face. “You think that is supernatural in origin? Animals do attack humans, Dean.”
Dean looks him up and down, and then raises an eyebrow. “Aren’t they supposed to be like . . . Birds?”
Dean touches his shoulder again. It’s still weird, feeling the pressure of his own hand and the possibly-Castiel-pressure, but it’s better than silence.
Castiel frowns and sways on the spot, like he’s drunk. “I. I think – I think I may have overdone it,” he says faintly, and then collapses.
Or, so Dean thinks. He’s kind of distracted by the blazing hot and amazingly tasty breakfast burgers and tater tots, which he is cramming into his mouth as fast as possible.
The Shadow makes a motion like threading a needle. “He stitched your soul together,” it repeats. “Carved off slices of his own grace to do it. You’re too human for me to lay hands on, Dean Winchester, but the veins of your soul? That’s all Castiel, through and through.”
But Dean can’t stop now, he’s on a roll, sparks are flying in his gut and “Is everything because of orders? Did you fly down here because of orders? Did you follow me everywhere because of orders? Did your superiors want a report on what the funny humans do down here on earth?”
When there’s no response, Dean comes to a stop. He can just make out the faintest glimmer of something in the distance, something that sparks blue and gold, but two can play this game, and Dean’s won just as many battles with Castiel over stubbornness as Castiel has won. Dean plants his feet, raises his hands, and yells, “CASTIEL!”
Still, sometimes that warrior’s edge comes in useful. Castiel had made approving noises when Dean had shown him the stockpile in the false trunk, and even gone so far as do . . . something to Dean’s bullets, although when he had tried to explain, it had gone right over Dean’s head.
That’s when a force slams Dean into the wall, hard enough that his teeth rattle in his head, and a man walks into the barn, a smirk set into his black-eyed face.
“My place is with you,” Castiel interrupts. “Heaven is stable, now. If they need me, they know where to find me.”
Castiel hums. “It was more uncomfortable than I thought, containing my wings within this vessel. I would prefer to have them out when I can, if you don’t mind. Also, I can tend to them much more easily in this form than on the plane we hide our wings on.”
!” Each words is punctuated by a kick, each more brutal than the last, raining down all over Dean’s body like the Shadow has more limbs than the two it’s currently appearing with.
“I’ll call you whatever I want,” the Shadow says, and abruptly its face is full of rage, like a switch has been flipped. It leans forward, menace in every line of its being, and its outline blurs at the edges like it can barely keep itself contained in Castiel’s form. “You dared to invade my home, and disturb my slumber, and demand that I break the deal Castiel
Dean swallows. “Okay,” he says, and both he and Castiel know he’s saying okay to more than just Castiel’s little promise. “Okay.”
Dean has absolutely no memory of going from standing awkwardly in the corridor to sitting on the motel bed, but between one blink and the next he finds himself trying to count possible exits as Castiel shuts the door shut behind them and locks it. And slides the chain on, for good measure.
Castiel doesn’t say anything back – nothing stupid about Heaven being his home or wanting to strike out from the bunker or even going to check on Claire and the rest – and that is when it dawns upon Dean that perhaps this is the perfect time to have their little chat. He’s not sure how Castiel will respond, after all, and what better place than somewhere like the Empty where no one, not even Jack, can eavesdrop?
The town’s on their way, so they roll into the motel and put on their FBI suits. Or rather, Dean does; Castiel has gotten very attached to his trench coat and rarely takes it off, and Dean suspects it’s only angel mojo keeping it clean and intact after so many hunts. It turns out that five of the last victims were all tracked to a barn on the edge of town, so Dean and Castiel stroll in to check it out.
Fortunately, Castiel seems content to just sit there. It’s a little creepy, the way he watches Dean without ever seeming to blink, but Dean’s eaten under worse conditions and cold fries are disgusting, so he just keeps shoveling food in his mouth until it’s all gone and he can sprawl back in his chair with a contented burp.
Then again, the only thing harder than getting into the Empty would be leaving it without what he came here for.
Castiel looks at him for a long, long moment. He can practically see Castiel thinking, although he can’t tell what, but, either way, after a few minutes Castiel nods to himself and steps forward. Dean’s not sure what, exactly, he is expecting, but he is
“Hello, Dean Winchester,” this creature says, eyes laser focused on Dean, voice deep and rough like a phone sex hotline connected straight to all of Dean’s deepest, darkest, most shameful fantasies. “I am Castiel.”
And, well, like hell is Dean going to take that lying down. He chambers another bullet and lifts his gun again. Maybe a headshot will do what a center mass did not. “Hey, I am delicious,” he says. “Monster snack heaven. Last week’s vamps would’ve loved a piece of my sweet, sweet bod. ‘Cept I killed them.”
The Shadow yawns and slumps further into its throne. “Yes, you will. Human souls don’t belong here; your kind goes to Heaven or Hell. Eventually, a tiny little portal will open and you’ll be sucked through it like dust up a vacuum cleaner. One of God’s little loopholes, to make sure every realm functions perfectly.”
“Hey,” Dean says, “my sense of direction is excellent. The Impala’s back that way, you’re gonna go in that direction, and I’m gonna go this direction. We can meet up again in an hour.”
Castiel handcuffs Dean to the bed, because he expects Dean to take him at his word but blatantly does not take Dean at his. It’s rude and annoying as hell, so Dean makes faces at him and rattles the cuffs the second Castiel backs away, just because he can.
Dean lifts his hand and reaches for the closest patch. Then he hesitates when a new fear takes shape. “What if I pull some out?”
Castiel has his chin lifted, as if to increase the surface area upon which the sun can shine, and he is sitting cross legged and shirtless, his back a wide expanse of smooth, unmarked skin as far as Dean’s eyes can see. Most damning of all, though, are his wings, which are spread up and wide, curving where they’re too long and about to bump into the wall.
He whips around and his flashlight falls upon the sight of – well, he’s not sure what, beyond it having blood all over it and mangled clothes. He fires once and the thing howls in pain, but if anything it runs
“Dude, your apartment is way too small for two more people. We’ll get a hotel room and come back tomorrow.”
,” Castiel says, and he sounds . . . not upset, but intense. Like he’s telling someone the sky is blue and can’t quite tell why they’re not believing them while looking at said blue sky. “Why do you not believe me?”
Sam’s braying laughter rings out in the darkness, followed by a gruff admonition that’s from Castiel, probably to tell his gigantor brother to lower his voice. Dean rolls his eyes and heaves himself out of bed to follow, mostly to check on his brother but also because his growling stomach is insistent on finding food.
This time, the sound echoes. Dean isn’t sure what changed, but now his yell carries, rumbling through the Empty, and the feeling of a thousand eyes on Dean’s back returns. It’s not Castiel; this is surprise, confusion, malice, anger, hunger. This is other things, probably starting to wake up.
Each word is like a little dagger into Dean’s heart. But Dean learned a long time ago to operate under pain, so he breathes it in and says the next thing. “I don’t know why I got so angry. I just do, sometimes. When things go wrong, it just comes out and I can’t – I can’t stop it. No matter how much I want to. I just lash out and say stupid things, mean things at anyone who’s nearby and I can’t – ”
“So she claims. But she made a very strange face when I mentioned Brady, so I imagine she knows more than she says.” Castiel shifts and tucks his wings more closely around Dean. “How did Jessica take it?”
And just like that, the Shadow turns to ooze again, melting into the floor so rapidly and Dean hits the ground with a jolt that hurts his probably-bruised ribs. He reaches out tentatively, but there is no more screaming, no more taunting, and no more inky tendrils, just a solid unending floor of darkness.
Dean tries to imagine Castiel engaging in the types of sins Dean does. He pictures Castiel drunk, tie loosened, shirt unbuttoned, eyes glazed over, voice even deeper from too much alcohol, even more prone to staring and touching Dean and saying all kinds of stupidly intimate stuff, and all too suddenly that is just. Too much. Dean’s just done with the day.
The sincerity burns Dean better than any whiskey ever has; he has to clear his throat a few times and look away to gather himself. Castiel is not only very literal, he’s just so
Castiel laughs at that. “Dean, as I keep reminding you, I am an angel. You would find it very difficult to hurt me.”
Which is why Dean is here, alone in the woods at daybreak, spray painting a sigil into the grass and praying that this soulmate summoning thing actually works. That maybe, just
“Dude, the ghosts are gone and we need to get out of here before anyone comes to check out that light show, we don’t have time for a heart to heart,” Dean points out.
“So that’s what smiting looks like,” Dean says, staring at the monster and its blackened, still faintly smoking face.
expecting Castiel’s eyes to light up to a blinding blue, or Castiel’s hand to start glowing, or Castiel to press said glowing hand right to his chest.
Jess, as she introduces herself to Castiel, keeps up politely cheery conversation with them as they walk inside. It’s a tiny apartment, and since the living room is basically a size too small for two people let alone three, Dean waves the box he’s carrying and sets off for the kitchen to look for a place to set it down. And to snoop.
But Dean is never able to forget that Castiel is not at all human. He moves too quietly, doesn’t blink or breathe or eat or drink, and stares at Dean if they’re not actively conversing. Hell, even if they are conversing. Sometimes it’s really funny, because Castiel knows exactly nothing about technology or pop culture, but most of the time, Dean will look up and catch Castiel’s gaze and be hard pressed not to shift into fight or flight. Castiel is unmistakably a warrior and a predator, and every instinct Dean has screams at him not to show his back.
Castiel’s eyebrow goes up when he sees the flashing numbers. “How long have you had that timer going, and for what?”
Perhaps he takes Dean’s silence as disagreement, for Castiel’s face goes stormy and sullen. He sits up with a huff, lifting his wing off of Dean, and moves to the edge of the bed. But his voice is softer when he speaks again, no longer the righteous angel of the Lord, just tired and sad. “Please have a little faith in me, Dean. I have placed so much in you.”
It is not, in fact, a werewolf. Dean finds this out when he manages to con their way into the morgue to get a look at some of the bodies. Fortunately, Castiel’s dead-eyed-stare and professional dress – although Dean had had to fix his tie, and why in god’s name Castiel can recite any known language but not correctly knot his own tie defies explanation – had done wonders to get them past any close scrutiny of their fake badges.
“Right before the Empty came for you, you said that knowing me changed you, that it made you care,” Dean says, because he knows every single word Castiel said, because they are seared into his mind and pressed into his soul. “You said. You said that you loved me. And I think – I know that there are things you need to know too.
“Guess the Empty finally decided to make a portal and spit me out,” Dean says, grinning.  He sets off again, whistling to himself. He can’t see anything yet, but that doesn’t matter; they had walked for weeks, following the trail of the wind, before they’d found the portal out of purgatory. “And don’t get any ideas, Cas. I
“I could learn more if I – ” Castiel begins to say, and lowers his hand towards the open chest cavity he had been sniffing.
“Your roommate was a demon,” Castiel announces dispassionately, and then he drops the burnt-out husk of the demon’s body onto the floor like a cat releasing a dead mouse. “I think it would be wise to add protections to this apartment, Sam. And I should see if there are more demons.”
Then again, the other reason that most people are happy to leave it to psychics is because sometimes summoning the appearance of your soulmate can cause a feedback loop and an explosion, but Dean isn’t most people.
And, just like that, Castiel comes alive again: his hand clenches too tight on Dean’s shoulder, his wings close in and push them together, and Castiel brings his face so close that if he did breathe, they’d be sharing breaths.
Dean imagines Castiel on hunts, giving the truth point blank when not asked and taking everything anyone says literally. Moving so quietly Dean can’t hear him and probably scaring the hell out Dean when he does so. Staring at Dean when he’s researching or eating or trying to sleep, and Dean
“Guess I can talk about Jack. Not much to say, honestly, cuz I didn’t really ask much questions. He sucked the power out of God and merged it with himself. He said he was gonna fix Heaven too, but I, uh, didn’t really ask about that either. He can probably tell you more when we get home.”
The Shadow turns back to Dean. “Now, then,” it says, obnoxiously pleasant, “I have some ground rules.”
John is nowhere to be found in the room, and all of his stuff is gone too. There’s no note or anything, but Dean just feels relief. This is normal. This is how things usually go: Sam gets mad and goes one way, John gets drunk and mad and goes the other, and Dean is the one left behind, quietly trying to keep them both alive. Besides, John did at least take his phone, because it’s off the charger, so he can at least call Bobby or Dean if he needs help.
And Dean wouldn’t believe it, but for the fact that he tried to lie to Castiel five minutes ago and the words literally would not leave his mouth. He tries to reconcile this fact in his mind, that the FBI has a division for handling supernatural cases that employs supernatural beings, and still can’t quite wrap his mind around it. Because yeah, soulmates can’t lie, but there’s a lot of ways to avoid telling the full truth that aren’t lying. Plus, cynicism kind of runs in Dean’s blood.
. His eyes are shining that white-hot blue, his outline is flickering like flames dancing, and there are two huge, spectral, fiery things that are arcing out of his back. They’re so bright they look like someone cut a hole in the void of the night sky and revealed a second sun hiding in another plane of existence. They’re terrifying and beautiful and they are moving as Castiel does, like they have a mind of their own.
Dean looks up. “I don’t have a ring,” he repeats, “but I’ll get you one. It’s only fair. One eternal token for another and all that.”
His shoulder twinges hard, then. Like he’s being grabbed, but not from the outside; it’s more like an all-around, all-encompassing grip. Like Castiel but unfettered from the limitations of a human vessel with human hands. It is reassurance, it is strength, it is protection. A promise.
Dean sneaks out of the motel room before the sun has even broken the horizon. He doesn’t really need to sneak out, since his father is dead to the world and will be so for hours after all the alcohol he consumed last night, but years of long habit keep his feet light and his movements swift. He dresses in the dark, grabs what he needs from the trunk, and is out and into the nearby woods before anyone can notice.
“I missed you,” Dean says, because months of living with Castiel have taught him the need for actually communicating.
Dean swallows hard. In the clearing, the wings had gleamed green and purple under the sun, but things are a little different now that Dean isn’t worried about being killed and is much closer. Now he can see that the light reflects off Castiel’s wings like a sunbeam glittering off a raindrop, scattering brilliant specks of color all over the room. The most prominent, of course, are the purples, running around the edges like the feathers are dipped in them, and the greens, which run down the center like veins, but Dean sees tiny glimpses of other colors as Castiel’s wings shift and twitch lazily, even though there’s no breeze in the room.
Still muttering, the Shadow turns away and raises its hand. It snaps its fingers and Dean flinches, because that sound never usually bodes well, but nothing happens beyond a weird reverberation in the darkness around them. It kind of sounds like a huge something in the distance has fallen.
Jess is just opening her mouth to answer when the door rattles with the telltale clicking sound of a key turning the lock, and Dean doesn’t need to see the way Jess brightens or the way Castiel cocks his head to know who’s at the door. Sam used to jangle his keys the exact same way when they rented hotel rooms, and by instinct, Dean finds himself on his feet, facing Sam with a grin on his face like the months of silence never happened.
And now Castiel is sad, shoulders and wings drooping as he half-heartedly combs his fingers through some of his feathers, and Dean can’t stand it.
Even the humanoid figure at the center of those wings is unnatural. It stands too still, it doesn’t blink, its chest doesn’t rise and fall. And for some reason it’s dressed like a rich person accountant, complete with a full suit, dark blue tie, and long, tan trench coat. Dean’s seen many monsters try to blend in with humanity, but never one who aimed for, like, Wall Street normal.
to go above and beyond when he rebuilt you. Stitched you up with pieces of himself, the crazy little – ”
And Dean’s never been the praying kind, but well, he doesn’t want to end up the dead kind, so he puts all his strength into keeping the damn monster off his face and thinks, hopes, prays,
He takes a deep breath. Sam had tried to have a heart to heart with Dean, after he’d looked up from their dinner with Eileen and the rest and saw Dean’s face, but Dean had brushed him off. There are some things a man can only say to their . . . well, whatever the hell Castiel is to him.
Dean grins. “Thanks, Cas,” he says, and manfully doesn’t point out that Dean wouldn’t have shouted if Castiel hadn’t just left.
That’s the theory, anyways. Jack had tried to explain the difference between purgatory and the Empty about five times before they’d given up and just gotten the ingredients for the spell.
Dean rolls his eyes, because why does he always get the monsters who play dumb? “Yeah, I got that much. I mean,
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says, smiling faintly. He rounds the bed and answers that ask, kissing Dean like they’ve been parted for centuries and not, at best, thirty minutes.
“None of that,” Dean interrupts. “We are finding something you like to celebrate with if we have to order the entire menu.”
About five minutes later, Dean gets bored of the silence. He really wishes he could hear or see Castiel, but the Empty seems to swallow all sound and he doesn’t actually want his eyes to burn out of his skull Pamela-style, so Dean does what he does best: he opens his mouth and fills the echoing nothingness with his own voice.
Then he stands, as if he means to leave right then and now. And sure, Castiel has accumulated possessions that Dean knows he treasures, but still, that can all wait until morning. Maybe even until after breakfast, since Castiel doesn’t eat.
The demon shrugs. “Well, I didn’t do anything. I just scribbled a few lines on the ground and you happened to walk into them.”
“Well, I can’t follow you around forever,” Dean says, and it’s the hardest thing he’s ever said. “We gotta live our lives, right? This is your life, and it’s not the same as mine, but that’s okay. I can still be a part of it, but like. In my own way. So you’ll go to college and get that shiny piece of paper and become a kickass lawyer, and I’ll cruise around with Cas and kill monsters and save the day. Deal?”
For another thing, he has no idea who to call. Normally, he’d call Bobby or check his dad’s journal, but he’s pretty sure neither of those usually helpful resources would be of any use in this situation. Dean had learned from John that angels didn’t exist, after all.
Eventually, though, Castiel remembers that he is an angel and much stronger than Dean. His wings spread outwards and up, until Dean is forced to unlock his fingers or break his arms. Dean squeezes his eyes shut because he refuses to have the last sight he has of his soulmate be Castiel looking at him with disgust before he flies away.
“Yes, because I deliberately limited myself to what your human eyes could perceive,” he says, like it’s common sense. “Typically, we fly much, much faster. I could be halfway around the world in the time it takes you to think about blinking.”
And Castiel knows him better than he knows himself, because his gorgeous wings arch up and curve backward, cocooning Dean in soft, warm feathers. Dean is at once protected and surrounded in the reminder that Castiel is alive, that he’s safe and here and not being torn apart by demons. It’s just enough to loosen the knot in Dean’s throat.
Castiel whirls on him. His wings flash into existence at his sides, shimmery and translucent, but they’re crackling with energy and agitation, little sparks running up and down. “It’s an angel trap,” Castiel snarls. “Dean, you have to run. Run, now!”
Dean clears his throat. “That sounds like you plan to, uh, stick around. With me. On Earth. Even though I just pissed you off.”
On one hand, it explains why Dean hasn’t managed to get out when normally he can be out in five minutes. On the other hand: “Are you serious?”
And wow, if there weren’t already a bevy of alarm bells going off in Dean’s head, there is, like, an entire army of them now. “How do you have my fingerprints?” Dean asks warily, sizing Castiel up and thinking about the knife in his boot.
“My true form is very damaging to the human mind. Only certain, special people can perceive my true visage without harm,” Castiel explains. His wings are softening, dipping downwards to cocoon them again, and with Castiel’s low, dark voice and the warmth of a body pressed all along his front, Dean feels a bit like he’s taking part in something way more intimate than just two dudes talking.
The first ingredient is a bit of dirt, dug from where Dean walked. Earth is the easiest ingredient, really, since humans are of the land. He dumps it into the bottom of the bowl, which is laid at the center of the star now.
“Should you be driving while eating?” Castiel asks, apparently blithely unconcerned about Dean’s total lack of manners.
“Yes, Jack has given us all our wings back. He has also reopened Heaven. I suspect within time he may need to make new angels, but for now at least, Heaven has stabilized.”
Warmth curls in Dean’s belly, settling in amongst the hot waffles and fresh pie and salty fries. Sure, Castiel has never expressed unhappiness with following Dean around and insists he likes it better than Heaven, but there’s a big difference in hearing Castiel say it and seeing him actually, visibly enjoying himself.
The super bright light he used to burn out a monster. “Whoa, whoa, don’t smite me!” Dean yelps, trying to pull away.
They get into the car without incident, and Dean spreads the pile of papers on the dashboard. The victims had no known connection beyond the fact that they lived in the same town and probably went to the same grocery store, but then again, most police offers aren’t looking for the kind of patterns and connections hunters do. Dean marks off a map of each victim’s location as Castiel obligingly finds each file and tells him, and they end up with a sort of circle around the local park.
Dean gestures half-heartedly at the wings Castiel still has sprawled all over the bed. At least they look better now, vibrant and gleaming again under the sun. “Your wings. They were – I didn’t wanna – ”
“I’m – ” The words die in Dean’s throat, because he is very much not fine, so he quickly switches to: “I’ll be fine.”
“When I go back to Heaven for good,” Castiel says softly, “it will be with you, and not a minute, not a
Dean hits the ground hard when the demon turns all of his attention and power on Castiel, chanting something, but he doesn’t even have a second to breathe before three more demons are pouring into the barn. They’re vicious and fast and strong; Dean only gets one shot off before two seize him and fling him clear across the barn.
, high-pitched and agonized. Dean yells too, because this hurts more than all the kicks and punches combined, like Castiel’s true voice but amped up to a thousand, at once too high and too low, tearing through the very fiber of his being like shockwaves on the level of his soul.
Dean and Sam usually flip coins or play rock paper scissors for who gets to go talk to the professionals and who ends up interviewing the witnesses. They used to just trade off, but then somewhere along the long, winding path of explosions that is their lives, they’d long since lost count. Dean says that Sam is better at it and Sam says that Dean is more convincing, and they both know they’ll never convince the other, so here they are, sitting in the Impala, doing rock paper scissors like they’re ten years old again.
“I did say the Bureau’s been searching for you for a long time,” Castiel says, not sounding the least bit repentant.
Castiel doesn’t blink at the gunshot. He doesn’t panic or scream or attack. Worst of all, he doesn’t even die. He just looks down and frowns at the new round hole in his trench coat, smooths a hand over it, and just like that, the bullet hole is gone.
“Heaven is perfect,” Castiel says, “for humans. For my kind, it is static and unchanging. Bland and featureless. Earth is so much more than that.”
Castiel is nice, after all. He’s weirdly solicitous of Dean, getting him food and stuff. And he answers any question Dean asks, which is a damn strange experience after life with Sam and John.
The flames burn out, abruptly, going from roaring forest fire to simmering ashes in seconds, the magic in the ritual having consumed all the blood Dean gave it. Dean swears and kicks at the bowl, and then swears some more when the heat sears his toes through his shoes. He examines the sigil in the grass, now seared into the ground, but it’s as perfect as the one he looked up last night, and all the ingredients were legitimate. And the invocation isn’t exactly easily messed up, given how short it is.
“Yep,” the Shadow says, in the exact same tone Dean had first used. “Good bye, Dean Winchester. May we never, ever meet again.”
“Sam misses you,” Dean finally offers up. It’s safer than the alternative. “Jack too. And Claire. And Jody. Even Rowena. And I – ”
But with a flap of his wings Castiel is there, somehow right in front of the demon, and he halts the demon’s escape attempt with a palm to its face. He keeps pushing when he connects with the demon’s face until the demon falls to his knees, and then Castiel smiles.
Castiel makes an amused sound. “You should read the Bible,” he remarks, which is so not what Dean expected him to say. “Angels are warriors of God. I’m a soldier, Dean. Fluffy wings would only be a detriment in combat. And if I showed you my halo, your eyes would burn out of your skull.”
Dean casts about for a safe topic. It’s a hard ask, because they’ve been through so much together that a lot of things are tied up in old memories, but then Dean thinks about their last day together before everything went to hell, and he remembers Castiel hovering the kitchen while Dean cooked. They hadn’t been talking, just hanging out, both of them content to just exist in the same place.
Dean stops. “Cas. Was that you? I swear to god if you’ve had the ability to do that this whole time and haven’t talked to me – ”
His ankle goes bright with pain and a scream bubbles out of his throat, echoing in the dim night. Fortunately, it coincides with Sam’s own yelps, so at least Dean can be safe in knowing he’s not alone in being attacked.
But this kiss – it’s different. It’s Dean affirming his words and Castiel responding in kind, and it’s joyful and beautiful and everything Dean never dared to dream about when he first set out into the woods all those months ago to do a soulmate summoning ritual.
He clears his throat. “Cas, buddy. Mind saying something? Giving me a sign? I can only talk so much, you know. And that Shadow thing is pretty shady. Even by our standards. Can you, uh, let me know it’s you and not, I don’t know, some really old and angry being I killed that wants to eat me?”
Dean sighs. “Come on, man, work with me. I didn’t really tell Jack you needed a body, and I don’t feel like being blinded. I mean, I guess Jack could fix that, but I don’t fancy the pain.”
Dean thinks this over for a minute. Then he levels a finger at Castiel. “You totally came down with your wings out to impress me, didn’t you?”
“I can smell your blood,” Castiel interrupts. He pokes Dean hard in the cheek and shoulder before Dean begrudgingly pulls up his ruined shirt and reveals his wound. Castiel puts his palm down, going quiet, and that super bright light starts to shine again.
And then, while Dean is blinking at his own fake ID and wondering if he should pinch himself, the door opens completely, revealing a man with dark hair sticking up in every direction, shockingly blue eyes, and a suit and tie and trench coat who sets off every alarm bell Dean’s ever possessed because holy hell
“If I wanted the human dead, I could have killed him already,” the demon points out. “All it would take is one flick of my wrist to break his neck.”
And Brady throws his head back and a cloud of black smoke comes screaming out, streaking towards the window, probably to find some other poor schmuck to possess. Sam and Dean both yell, but it doesn’t matter, because in the blink of an eye, Castiel is just
The wings vanish as abruptly as though someone had flicked a light switch, and, if Dean didn’t know better, he would say Castiel was actually pouting.
“I uh. I made a list. After we won. Stuff I wanted to say. I didn’t bring it with me because most of it was useless crap, but I think I should probably say item number one now. While you’re here and not flying off to Heaven. Which, you know, you can, afterwards. But. Well. I need to say it. Because you didn’t let me, in purgatory. And you didn’t let me when you died for me, you assbutt.”
And after that, Dean has no more arguments or excuses, so he takes a deep breath and sticks his hand in. Castiel’s wing is so warm that it feels like sticking his hand into a nice, heated car, but his feathers shift and twitch as Dean combs his fingers through, so he can never forget what, exactly, he is touching. Slowly Dean falls into a rhythm, running his fingers through the bottom tier and working his way up, and he finds it not dissimilar to untangling Sam’s long hair when the kid was young.
“Only the most important one.” The Shadow pauses dramatically and its grin gets even bigger, if that’s possible. It actually stretches from ear to earth, black teeth making up half of its face. “You can’t look at Castiel until you’re back on Earth.”
“To recruit you, not arrest you,” Castiel explains. “You can refuse to work with us, you know. And I thought. Well. I would not hold you here if it wasn’t what you wanted, Dean.”
Castiel finally shows up a few hours later, when Dean is getting out of the shower in their hotel room. Dean does not flinch when he opens the curtain and finds Castiel two inches away and staring at him, but he does allow Castiel to help him climb out of the shower before he slips and falls flat on his face.
“Yes, Dean, I will remember to act normally,” Castiel says in a long-suffering tone. He pulls away and straightens his tie, letting his wings slip away into invisibility. He even dusts at his pants, like they’re even capable of getting dirty when he cleans everything with his angel mojo. “I am Castiel Winchester, a typical, non-supernatural human being.”
Castiel is still there in the morning. Dean might dismiss it as a hallucination or a very vivid dream, but when he yawns and rolls over, scrubbing at his eyes, the sight that greets him is way beyond his ability to imagine.
The roiling mess in his stomach is even worse, now. He has no idea what he imagined Castiel’s response would be, but somehow what Castiel did say is even worse. Because Castiel is
The Shadow screams and screams and screams, and each scream hurts Dean, but Dean’s touch seems to hurt the Shadow more, so Dean grits his teeth and tightens his hands and puts everything he has to holding on. It’s probably the hardest thing he’s ever done, but if Castiel is in reach, if Castiel’s life is stake, if Dean can get Castiel back – it’s all worth it.
Dean is in the middle of picturing Sam’s epic tantrum when he finds out that Dean’s soulmate is an angel and has been hanging around for a few days when he picks up on the sound of thudding footsteps, fast and loud, too noisy to be Castiel.
“So do it,” Dean challenges, because at this point, he has nothing left to lose. Jack had warned him that he might not be able to bring Dean back out and they had had no idea what would happen to a human soul in the Empty, and Dean had walked in regardless. He spreads his arms and legs wide, bares his throat, opens himself to any attack. “Kill me, then, for your precious
The demon looks at the ground, where the angel trap is, and then back up. “Not from inside that trap, you wouldn’t,” he says smugly. “You’re cut off from Heaven. And who knows how long it would take for someone to come by and let you out? Your human might be nothing but dust and bone fragments by then.”
Dean has no idea what it would be like to punch the embodiment of the Empty. Perhaps it would be like punching Castiel, unyielding steel and diamond, or maybe it give way, squishy and formless. He kind of wants to find out.
Castiel’s frown deepens, and he opens his mouth, as if to argue, but then his shoulders slump and he sighs deeply. “I always forget,” he murmurs, almost to himself. “Humans are very prone to taking the initiative.”
What comes out of Dean’s mouth is most certainly not rehearsed: “Hi, I’m Dean Winchester, I’m a hunter pretending to be with the FBI so I can ask you if you’ve seen a ghost recently.”
“My true form is approximately the size of your Chrysler Building,” Castiel explains mildly, like he’s explaining how to load a gun and not confiding precious bits of angelic lore. “This vessel allows me to compress myself to your plane of existence, but it is . . . I suppose the closest analogy would be putting your foot in a shoe that is a few times smaller. Serviceable, but not exactly the most comfortable.”
By the time Castiel has winged his way back with breakfast – burritos and fries, score – Dean has found a new hunt. Or, well, what’s shaping up to be good signs of a hunt. Usually Sam is better at the tech angle, but where there are headlines about bodies dropping from “animal attacks,” there are usually monsters to be found.
Dean snaps his head up. Castiel’s voice is edged with something Dean does not like, something uneasy and wary and entirely not at place with the confident angel who’d flown down from Heaven and declared himself Dean’s soulmate. But he must take too long to respond, because Castiel draws his shoulders up, and his wings slip into that translucent form again, the one Dean has learned is the midway stage before they disappear entirely.
Dean sets off again towards the portal. He can see it now, a glowing, rippling circle of light in the distance, throwing off blue and gold sparks. It looks about the size of his arm, but that could just be because it’s too far away or it’s not at full size yet.
Dean leans close, batting away one of the Shadow’s flailing limbs. “Give Cas back,” he says, “or not only will I come back until I wake every single being here, I will tackle you until you can’t even remember what sleep feels like.”
“You are my soulmate,” Castiel states, deep and low and unyielding as diamond. “You touching my wing is not anymore blasphemous than me touching your arm.”
“Hey,” Dean says gently and drags his chair closer. He reaches out and takes Castiel’s hands in his own, relishing in how warm they are. “I didn’t know we were soulmates, when we met. And I can’t – I can’t say that if I’d known I would have stayed. My parents were soulmates and it didn’t . . . it didn’t end well.”
“This town is well traveled and nowhere near a big forest or park,” Dean points out. “Five bucks it’s a monster. Ten it’s a werewolf. Full moon last week.”
“I’ll need to hide my wings again, so I might as well get used to the human way of travel. Even if it is remarkably slower.”
And for the icing on the cake, before Dean can even register his new position or protest, Castiel is lowering his wing back down, covering them both like a warm, fluffy, bullet proof blanket.
Which is how Dean finds out that they are hunting long-lost twin-sibling ghosts, who were separated at birth and found each other only to die tragically in an accident because their parents couldn’t get along and who are now murdering anyone who happens to disturb their old house. Sam figured out there might be more than one ghost while poking around at the morgue, Castiel figured out that the two ghosts might be related using his enormous FBI database of resources, and now they have a date with the cemetery to burn the bodies.
Dean can’t help but melt at that. His all-powerful, teleporting, angel of the Lord soulmate, pouting because he finished off a burger too quickly. It’s adorable.
Sam smugly takes the sheaf of papers they got from the police chief, which has a bare-bones description of the three people who’ve turned up dead in the past week. They’ve already ruled out sulfur and demons, but that still leaves any of the, oh, twenty dozen other supernatural creatures who are physically or magically strong enough to tear people in half. Fortunately, the medical examiner happily agreed to let one of them come and take a look.
, like a bath that’s just a little too hot but is perfect to soothe away the injuries of a long hunt.
, he is an angel billions of years older than Dean, he’s fought wars more ancient than Dean’s own bloodline, and he probably did have a plan that was more elegant than Dean’s
,” Castiel notes smugly. “Also, she kept saying that she had information for Sam Winchester and was on the run.”
It’s not really what Dean wanted to hear, because it sounds an awful lot like what happened when Dean fought his way out of purgatory and being squeezed through that portal had really, really sucked.
Castiel pokes Dean hard in the back, but Dean is already moving. He dodges the couch and the chair and Jess with the ease of long practice in tiny motel rooms as Sam drops the books he’s holding in his hands, and they collide in the middle of the room, so hard that Dean actually has the breath knocked out of him, and Sam staggers back a step. But then they have their arms wound around each other and it’s great, it’s wonderful, it’s like the world is spinning in perfect alignment again.
