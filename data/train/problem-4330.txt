"You always said girls would be swarming me when we were older, and I can tell you, you were dead wrong. I haven't talked to, let alone dated a girl I was interested in since high school. Y'know, other than talking to Charlie. But she doesn't count, seeing as she's batting for the other team these days, and I never had a crush on her."
Although it was getting darker.
The two women all chimed in with news from the past two and a half years, excitedly talking over each other.
His finger tightened on the trigger, and he watched Sam disappear behind a slope.
“Okay. Now I’m curious.”
He stared at Sam speechlessly, and the younger man shrugged weakly. "The bomb Billie made turned him into a power vacuum, and he absorbed power from every plant he passed, and then he absorbed all the energy from Michael and Lucifer fighting, Lucifer dying-"
“What is your life missing?”
“Alright.” Pamela folded her arms on the desktop. “We’re doing a study on people with their partners overseas, and you’re one of those. Do you mind me asking some questions about that?”
Castiel tensed.
Three firefighters were fighting with a struggling John Winchester, Sam tucked against his side, the man still trying to go inside.
Finger clenching and unclenching in the fabric of the shirt, he looked away so he wouldn’t have to see the expression of pain on Sam’s face.
"That sounds cool," Castiel poked one of them.. "Which side's the good one?"
He hadn’t realized he’d fallen asleep, but the clock showed it was late at night.
Cas blinked quickly, the small tendril of hope latching on and growing. “Jack, what are you saying?”
"Castiel!" The call came from behind him. "Cas! Get your butt inside! It's the dinner rush, and we're packed."
When he moved back, it was only far enough to meet Castiel’s eyes. “I’ve never told you why we stayed, did I?”
“Mature. Real mature!” Lucifer rounded the first corner. “I really want to enjoy this, savor just ripping you apart, gettin’ all up in there, and gettin’ all gooey.”
Thinking was the worst thing he could do right now.
Dean didn’t wait for his help, already unbuttoning the top of Cas’ shirt.
Instead of sleeping, he just stared out the window, lost in a daze.
John stepped forward, pulling him into another tight hug. “Don’t sir me. You’re one of my boys too.”
She smiled wryly. "He gets that from his father. John was hopeless with babies. You sure you can hold down the fort?"
'Cursed or not,' a phantom image of Dean whispered in the back of his mind. 'I'd rather have you.'
“Okay. Can you-?”
She jumped, spinning around with a gasp, heedless of the load she was carrying. “Cas! You’re awake!”
"He would want you to have it," the younger man said shakily. "I'll take one of the other cars in the garage."
His words were cut off by the flash of bright light, and they landed back in the apocalypse world he already hated so much.
The light comforted him, and he curled up in a niche where he could still see it, eyes closing with fatigue.
"I know."
The leather seats were warm, they stuck to his skin.
Castiel blinked. “What?”
She moved away, pausing in front of Dean.
“He needs a new shirt,” Dean said softly, tensely.
“Hello sir,” the doctor said cheerfully.
“Mom’s okay. Just a few burns, and smoke inhalation.”
The hand in his own tightened, holding his hand more firmly in place, and when he looked over, Dean was staring at the ground with a tiny smile.
They entered in a group, careful not to leave each other unguarded for whatever was waiting.
“Dean-”
At half past, Jody stepped back in. “You’ve got visitors,” she said quietly. “Boy said he’s Dean’s brother, Sam, and he’s got someone named Jess with him.”
After a while, he noticed that there were no hands on him, no humming coming from the stranger, and he forced his eyelids open, groaning softly with the effort.
“He usually goes to the Roadhouse for coffee in the mornings.” Bobby took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “The Harvelles are old friends.”
“Yeah yeah, I was gonna call you before- no I know- okay. Okay, Charlie. Just- calm down. Yes, I found him, no I haven’t figured that out yet- look, I promised I would, now please stop asking. Yes, he’s here.” Castiel huffed an irritated sigh, turning an apologetic on him. “I’ll ask, okay?”
"When we were thirteen, I was getting bullied. Alastair King, you remember him? He had me cornered in the locker room, and was about to beat the daylights out of me when you sailed in with the rest of our team, stood in front of me, and talked circles around him. Threw in a few good insults, and even had his own group laughing at him. He came at me a day later, and I punched him. Broke his nose. He left me alone after that. Never did look as good afterward."
He leaned into it, smiling into the kiss, wrapped his arms around Dean's neck, and stood on tip-toe.
All the way gone, he couldn’t make a crossroads deal for an angel.
"Cas?"
Sam glanced around tiredly. “We don't know.”
Flames weren’t so prevalent upstairs, but the smoke was thicker, sending him into a coughing fit as he stumbled up the steps.
His fingers held achingly tight to the bundle that was his coat.
"Wait," he spun, forcing her to stop. "We do?"
He could hear the worry in Dean’s voice. “She knows?”
Castiel let out a heavy breath, curling into the embrace. “I missed you.”
Dean held him equally tight, swaying slightly. “I love you so much,” he whispered. “I missed you, and I love you.”
Radiant light blinded him for a split second, but then all he could see was rage as Cas’ body fell to the ground.
“I’m fine, Mary. Okay? I’m alright, promise.”
“Cas? Can you- can you hear me?”
“Yeah, no problem.”
Five foot, seven inches of compressed rage towards anything that dared hurt her boys, she was a sight to behold.
"Then when we were- I don't know- twelve? I think? You were convinced I was going to be the next big thing with my writing. I'm actually published now, and it's not great pay, but I have a small following. Not quite the level of accomplishment we dreamed, but it's something alright."
Habits and Personality of missing person:
“Leaves are falling all around. It's time I was on my way.” The singer on the radio crooned softly, the voice crackling slightly.
It was only when the janitor came in that they left, still holding hands.
Her fist slammed into Lucifer’s face.
“I see. Do you remember anything about how you were injured?”
The blue-eyed man waited high on the rise, back against the stone wall, sharp gaze scanning the wells and dips of the plain.
Dean nodded quickly. “Yeah, yeah, just- let me settle my bill. Don’t move.”
Setting his unopened beer on the counter to the right of the fridge, he turned slowly, hand falling to the angel blade hidden in the pocket of his coat.
The dry tone made Dean shoot a playful glare at his best friend. “Dude. C’mon. It’ll be great.”
Until finally he came home from school one day to find Dean sitting on his bed, holding his backpack.
"What- how is that not clear?"
“How are you alive? I killed you!”
Castiel nodded heavily, closing his eyes. “How far away is your apartment?”
Cas backed up slowly until he felt the wall beneath his searching hand, and he slid to a sitting position.
“Yeah.”
At this point, he didn’t care who heard, if someone could grant this one wish.
Castiel met her gaze, shrugging one shoulder. “Honestly? I don’t trust this. I don’t know you from Eve, and I’m not going anywhere, with anyone, when someone is gunning me down. So tell them they can come here, or nothing.”
"You little-"
"It's me."
Pamela’s office was one of those that had an eerie quality.
Meanwhile, Castiel made preparations. In his right boot, he had stored a sheath of his knives, incredibly thin, four inches in length. Made of the hardest metal in the world, giving it the ability to hold a much sharper edge.
A blush rose in his cheeks, but he sat down anyway.
His name.
A breath, this one an animal clawing at his lungs.
"Can we stay here?" He met her gaze for a few seconds before looking back at Dean, feeling his heart twist at the fear there.
“Wow, Clarence,” Meg said quietly. “You’re a regular angel, aren’t you?”
“I took him to Sam and Eileen’s home.” Jack winced. “Sam almost shot Dean. I had to explain everything before coming here.”
Sam allowed himself to be led over to where chairs had been placed beside the bed.
Eventually they tired of it, and Dean hopped to his feet. "Race you to the house!"
“Mary!” He yelled between coughs. “Mary!”
He started with a small bite, just at the tip of the spoon, holding it close to Dean’s mouth. “I’m pretty sure you learned this lesson twenty something years ago, Dean. I’m also fairly certain I don’t need to teach you how to open your mouth again.”
Something caught Dean’s attention off to the side, and his eyes flitted away, growing unfocused again.
“You’re in Purgatory, the biggest town south of Lawrence.”
His friend was watching him. Warily, but still looking at him.
They reached the bedroom in silence, and Dean helped him back into the bed, pulling the blanket back over him.
Deep breath.
“You’re Steve, right?”
The bed was made with military-like precision, and he felt a clench in his heart.
“I missed you so much.”
A grunt of pain as Dean was silenced, and Castiel finally raised his head.
"You get a kiss," Dean said brightly.
Dean shrugged at the quizzical look. "They're just misunderstood, Cas. They don't know that the other side's good too."
Dean pressed a kiss to his forehead, breathing unsteady, and he looked up to see wetness in his partner’s eyes.
Fourth was that he wasn’t alone.
“I know you do, Cas.”
“About a week ago, after Jo told me you were captured by Michael.  I left the town, started searching for news of Michael, knew he wanted to gloat over it, and wouldn’t have killed you that soon. Caught up-” he yawned, pressing his face into the crook of Dean’s shoulder. “Caught up the day before, and waited for the right moment, to surprise them. It-” he yawned again, eyes drooping. “It worked better than I was expecting.”
Lucifer walked closer, easy as anything. “Well... this is a fun surprise. I gotta hand it to you guys. You never give up, even when you should. Even when it would be so… stupid not to.”
“I thought we were on the same page for once. But then- then you left, with Kelly, and she was more important to you than I was, than we were, and-” Every breath was a struggle. “Lucifer, and Crowley, and now-”
“Can I see them?” Dean traced the collar of his shirt. “If you don’t have a problem with it, that is.”
He cracked one lid, instantly regretting it as he was treated to the full glare.
“Yes. I’m parked outside the police department. What’s going on now?”
“Did you hear something?” The cold eyes swept his followers. “All I hear is a dead man.”
The sun beat down on his shoulders, and the wind whipped dust in his eyes.
The waves dash him against the cliffs, and he gasps as they shred into his scales.
“Okay. Thanks for calling me, Cas. Thank you.”
“Mary, right?”
The name sent a burst of dislike through him, and he gripped his hands together tightly.
Another breath, this one shards of glass in his throat.
“I’m not trying to- no, I know him. Please?”
The hospital was surprisingly small, he thought.
The sun shone brightly.
There was a beat of shocked silence, before Dean dipped in to press their lips together, soft and tentative.
Cas smiled softly at him. “There we go.”
“Cas, get me a gun!”
Cas swallowed tightly, mouth working, unable to speak.
She even took his phone.
At his pleased little noise, Dean smiled again, leading him back toward the house. "Alright then. Cuddles it is."
Gently, ever so gently, he let Cas down onto the table.
He nodded slowly. “Yeah… why-?”
"Just take me."
Castiel gripped Dean's hand tightly, starting to lift it, but Dean flinched, grip tightening, and he let it rest back on his arm. "I'm not letting go," he said calmly, reassuringly. "Just swapping places to make it easier."
Short tap.
At the door, Dean stopped him with a kiss. “Alright, let me cover your eyes, yeah?”
"Yeah." He smiled shakily, letting Dean pull him back into his arms. "Got it."
He waited for what felt like hours for Dean to fall asleep.
They ate silently, Mary glancing occasionally between them, but she didn’t say anything until they were done.
Michael King took everything from him years ago, on that burned out homestead, and now, twenty years later, he will not let everything be taken from him again.
The hesitation in his eyes was all the proof he needed.
“No, no, no, no, no, no! We gotta go!”
He stopped, and Cas realized he had nothing to say. "Be careful."
They were growing larger as he watched, and a curl of fear rose in his belly.
The change of topic had his bewildered mind spinning to keep up.
Dean stiffened, but didn't pull away, and he counted that as a win.
They were fourteen when the other kids started picking on Castiel, mocking the way he talked, taunting him about the clothes he wore, and making his life miserable.
“Please. I need you.”
It took several minutes for the tears to cease, and in that time, neither moved an inch.
“How- when- what-?” Castiel shook his head helplessly, holding Dean even tighter. “How are you here?”
Dean dodged a broken step without any second thought, resting a hand on the doorknob before glancing back at Sam and Mary.
Castiel Milton, it read.
The boy- the god- whoever he was now- smiled hesitantly. “It’s good to see you, Cas.”
He had known, of course, but he hadn’t let himself stop long enough to understand it, or to register that he could never go home.
Sam was still in the kitchen, but Mary was sitting cross legged by the door, rocking gently.
“Look, can we get out of here? I’ve got a bad feeling about this place.”
Mary smiled at him. “Mrs Milton told me. Maybe you two can be friends.”
He turned, glaring playfully at his friend. "Charlie, I swear- you know I got off at twelve today."
Castiel rolled over, pressing his face into Dean’s stomach. “But now I don’t wanna get up.”
He struggled to his feet, heedless of Sam’s hand around his arm.
Fifteen steps.
Jess leaned closer, resting her head on his shoulder. "I'm not gonna push. I'm not Sam, I don't have any right to do that. But I am here if you want to talk."
He was getting closer, but it would still be hours before he’d be home.
With no idea of what he’d been planning to do, Dean went to take a step forward, maybe to comfort Cas, maybe to-
“You haven’t. It was entirely my hare-brained idea. I was an idiot.”
When he was finished, Sam’s eyes were wide with concern, and Mary was trembling with restrained fury.
“Are you in town?”
He hadn’t eaten in almost a week when he finally gave in to the sharp pains in his stomach.
Me: She said we're moving
Not this late, and most certainly not while his mother was here.
“Meaning?”
It was his own shirt, neatly folded and tucked to the side.
Dean pulled away slightly, face set in a small frown. "Cas, listen to me. There's nothing that's ever going to stop me from coming after you, got it?"
Castiel took in a shaky inhale, moving a few steps closer, into Dean’s field of vision.
The Miltons hadn’t been well liked.
“Yes.”
Dean moved his hands, and-
Sam and Dean were tied in the middle, backs to each other, a post between them, and he’s betting the ropes are tight enough to cut off circulation, given that they haven’t freed themselves yet.
“I don’t know the exact date yet, but sometime next month.”
Cas made a soft, frustrated noise in the back of his throat. “I don’t understand."
He could see Dean, and he looked scared.
"Yeah."
And then Dean was kissing him.
Slowly and cautiously, the blue-eyed boy crept inside after his friend.
He could’ve cried when he saw Dean staring at him, eyes full of shock, and joy.
It stings, sure, but he shrugs it off, because nothing matters anymore.
He made it to the town by eight o’clock that night, stopping at a bar in order to grab a bite to eat before continuing to Dean’s apartment.
"Good on them. You shouldn't have to worry about getting shot."
A squat one story building, it only took up a few blocks.
He couldn’t breathe-
“What about them?”
Bright and cheerful, full of hope for a new life.
Staring down at Jack, he felt the first stirring of warmth. "He loved you. I don't know why, but I'm gonna- gonna take care of you."
She jerked a thumb over her shoulder, eyes red, but shining with happiness. “Making burgers.”
Her hand slipped away, replaced with one that he knew.
Castiel rested his hand on Dean's fingers, thumb sweeping back and forth. "I can stay now. Okay? I'll stay, and soon Sam will be here."
Testing his knee, he found it to be in near perfect condition.
The wind picked up, scouring along the back of his neck, whispers of an approaching storm.
Dean huffed a soft laugh. “I always loved holding you, whenever you’d let me.”
That was the best part.
Stepping gingerly down into the kitchen, he crossed to the fridge to pull the door open
"I know." He closed his eyes tiredly.
The boy-god didn't answer, and Cas was left to pick up the pieces of his shattered heart.
Over the next minute, he was doused with holy water, had a handful of salt thrown at him, and had a silver blade cut into his arm.
The sound of rattling woke him, and he gasped in pain as he was thrown against a wall.
“Thank you.”
With that, they parted ways.
He couldn’t move, and he was laying slightly propped up
Long again.
Castiel stayed silent for a moment, overwhelmed.
"Cas! Breathe, okay?"
Castiel’s tail twitched at the endearment, and he stifled a sob in the back of his throat. “Dean?”
The seventeen year old glared at his friend, eyes narrowing in irritation. "I’m trying to work.”
He nodded softly, and moved to follow, but before he could take more than a step in her direction, he felt a hand latch onto his arm.
Dean looked over quickly, face caught in a surprised laugh at the joke. “Damn, I love you.”
"We were hunting." Sam swallowed tightly. "I was with him."
His voice gave out, and his fingers curled involuntarily into the still warm fabric of Cas’ shirt.
“I figured,” he mumbled. “Where am I?”
Even though his phone was on vibrate, he still periodically checked for a reply.
Dean turned in surprise, seeing his mother, face set, and eyes furious.
Dean made a grabby-hands motion towards the phone. “I’ll win her over, promise.”
“Pam?”
Under, over, around, repeat, until he was holding a small bag, large enough to hold some of the snails, but small enough that it wouldn’t impede his swimming.
“Over here, Mr Novak.”
When it got dark, Castiel headed back to his house, and Dean watched him go from the window.
As he had the thought, a rush of nausea burst through.
He could feel Dean’s disbelieving stare on him, but couldn’t seem to look up.
“Dean?”
The two moved away from the door, Dean leading the way to where his army men were waging a war. "They're fighting over laws and stuff."
Glancing up, he noticed the tense line of Dean’s shoulders, and almost wanted to keep the next part from him.
“You know what,” he said sharply. “You didn’t tell me that they were hurting you.”
Get out get out get out-
The room was dark, only a lamp casting shadows into the corners of the room.
In front of him, still wearing his uniform, was Dean, smile huge. “Hey gorgeous.”
Nothing needed to be said at the moment, and so they didn’t.
Finishing the gun, he held it over his shoulder, letting Sam take it.
“Well, that worked,” Lucifer raised his eyebrows sardonically.
“No-” Dean scooted forward, gripping Cas’ other wrist. “No it isn’t. It never has been. You’re my best friend, Cas. Not them. I would pick you over them any day.”
“For you, maybe,” he spat. “Don’t I get a choice?”
He followed directions silently, crossing his legs under him.
Deep breath.
"I can't." Every word sounded like it was dragged out with a wire. "I can’t stay here."
There was no way of Mary knowing he was there, but there were four plates on the table when they reached the dining room.
“No, he doesn’t smoke,” Castiel shook his head numbly. “No drinking. No drugs. He- he was- no. No drugs of any kind. He didn’t drink, or anything. Told me he’d never risk driving his Baby like that.”
Disbelief hit him like a freight train to the gut. “...what?”
Dean shrugged. “It alternates depending on the night. I don’t have a preference. You?”
When he stayed quiet, Dean glanced up at him briefly before staring at the tattoos again.
There hadn’t been an urge to stop and eat as he fled, and he wouldn’t be doing so if he wasn’t getting weak from it.
“Nope. C’mon. You can get your fill of me once you’re back in bed.”
A surge of relief washed over him, and he leaned forward to take Dean’s hand. “Are you- still?”
Blow after blow she rained down on him, until even the Devil staggered back beneath her onslaught.
“It’s like you don’t even know me,” Dean laughed softly, before his smile fell, and he coughed awkwardly. “Sorry, I didn’t-”
“Yes. Who-?”
The portal flashed again, and they turned to see Lucifer step through, already smiling.
Firefighters were filling the yard, and neighbors crowded the sidelines.
“Okay. I get that. But can I come up? I can get a flight tomorrow, and-”
He raised his hand in the air, the other trapped still. "Scout's honor."
The door swung open with a quiet creak, and Dean flipped on the light.
Not a pretty sight when the Devil smiles.
Covering the phone speaker, he smiled ruefully. “She wants to talk to you.”
Finally, after an unendurable period of stifling silence, Dean gave Sam a pleading look. “I need a minute.”
Then it was back to war.
A furrow formed between Dean's eyebrows. "I dunno. They just fight."
He couldn’t tell them what Naomi had threatened.
“Say your goodbyes, boys.” Michael scoffed. “And say hello to dear Castiel for me, will you?”
“I just got you back.” Staring sightlessly at the stained trench coat, he gasped a breath. “After- after Ramiel, I thought that- that maybe you might… you know. Profound bond, and all.”
The back door was still ajar, and he steeled himself for what he’d see.
“That’s all?”
"Jack, it's me. It's… Castiel. I got out, but I'm- I'm human. The Empty couldn't keep me if I became human, so I cut out my grace. I did it so I could come back to Dean. But he's not here. It's- it's not fair."
Instead of the revulsion he’d been expecting, there was awe prevalent on Dean’s features.
He tilted his head. “Everyone calls me Steve.”
He lifted one shoulder, turning back to his bowl of soup.
Chuck was… well, he was Chuck. Not unfriendly, per se, but always lost in his own world.
“Hey...” Sam leaned forward, carefully squeezing his brother’s hand. “It’s- it’s really good to see you.”
A pause, silence.
"Castiel?" Jody stepped forward, and he didn't miss the way Dean stiffened. "We need to talk paperwork."
It wasn’t Dean or Sam, he knew that much. The tread was light, so either Ellen or Jo Harvelle.
Castiel opened his door, sliding into the seat. “Thank you again. I’ll be sure to stay in touch this time.”
Dean's voice was definitely worried now, lowering to a soothing tone. "Hey, I need you to breathe, okay?"
For the first time since he’d arrived, Dean flushed slightly, rubbing the back of his neck. “I only have the one bed. We could share, if you don’t mind, or I could take the couch-”
He rose without another word, stepping gingerly past Sam’s outstretched legs to hurry out the door of the small room.
And he was gone again before he could hear the rest of the sentence.
He followed, staying silent until they were inside. “I’m a little surprised,” he admitted. “I would’ve thought you’d do a background check or something.”
The teacher- Ms Sarah, she had told them- smiled, placing her hand on his shoulder. “Don’t worry. We haven’t started yet.”
“You can’t do this,” he said sharply.
Carefully, ever so slowly, he slipped his other arm under his knees.
Dean stood several paces away, head tipped, squinting against the sun, looking warm, and beautiful, and alive. “Hey Cas.”
“Yeah.” He approached Dean slowly, sitting on the edge of the bed with a faint smile. “Hey. I’ve got some pudding for you, if you’re hungry.”
“Got someone waiting for you?”
Sam held it out warily, letting Cas take it, and guide it down to rest on top of the bed.
He had never been close with his father and siblings, and although he hated the thought of a future without them, it was the thought of life without Dean that had his breath coming in panicked gasps.
That’s when he saw Dean.
He had Dean's number in his old phone, but hadn't memorized it, and now he wished he had.
“Heavy enough to stop Lucifer?” Dean stared at a point just over his shoulder, pushing down the urge to yell at him.
When he nodded, his boyfriend let out a relieved breath. "Okay. How about we go somewhere else, yeah?"
“Yeah, me.” Castiel slipped his thumbs through his belt loops.
Jody held out her hands. "I'm headed toward the cafeteria myself, I can take it along."
It was as noisy inside as it was outside, more so even, and he headed to the bar, slinging his bag down to rest under his seat.
“As for the rest of you,” he added in a louder voice. “I’ve got five men out behind you with guns trained. The first to make a move dies.”
Sam looked up, the lines on his face deepening as he took in what Dean was holding. “What are you doing?”
Third, he couldn’t see.
It’d been two days since his memory returned, and Castiel Milton was angry.
He breathed a sigh of relief when his friend didn’t move, except to curl his fingers around his hand.
They were both already in pajamas, and it was a simple matter of taking off jackets, and curling up in the pile of blankets that smelled like his boyfriend, and almost instantly made him exhausted.
There was a good reason for it.
“Are you two planning on marriage?”
“I thought you had a younger brother.”
“I need to get away. Can I travel with you?”
Neither made any move to deepen the kiss, and it took several seconds to pull away.
“What do you wanna do, Cas?” Dean squeezed his hand, voice lowered to a soft whisper meant only for his ears.
The interior of the house was neat, if a little dusty, but felt lived in.
He sighed. “Yes, that was a joke. Why do you need to know?”
Eight.
He breathed a sigh of relief as he saw the understanding in Sam’s eyes, and moved back, fading from sight.
The whole thing had taken less than half a minute, and as he scanned the fireside again, Michael swaggered to the front of the rowdy bunch, looking as if he was enjoying the moment. “We’ve been after these two for three years, with these cowards hiding every step of the way. Well, not anymore! We took care of that snot-nosed brat Milton, and now we’ll wipe the last of them off the earth.”
Find Mary.
“What- what happened?”
"Hey, hey- it's okay, Cas. It's gonna be okay." Dean pressed a kiss to the side of his head. "We'll figure this out, I promise."
Me: I don't know if I can
“I’m not gonna leave you, sweetheart.”
"Thank you, Jo." He smiled softly. "You're a good friend."
He relished in the pleased huff of laughter Dean gave.
He shifted uneasily, dropping his gaze, and Dean noticed it, hands stilling. “Was that insensitive? Sorry, I wasn’t- I didn’t mean-”
Then he turned, and their eyes met, followed by an expression of heartbreaking relief that spread across Dean's features.
His voice got louder, following them as they rushed to the shining rip in the air.
And on the warpath.
“Cas?”
Someone was singing.
“Would you wanna ride with me?” Dean broke in, voice hesitant. “We can grab your things.”
Dean’s anger hurt worse than any of this.
“The non-verbal one?”
The woman bustled over to him, handing him a stick of papers half an inch thick. "You'll have to fill all this out, show evidence of income, and get a place here before we can do more."
The effect was instantaneous.
I can’t tell them, or she might find out and do it anyway.
That was all that mattered.
“Is he-?” Sam turned wide eyes on Cas, who smiled wetly.
Still trying to find you.
“That’s a nice name.” The other wrinkled his nose. “I’ve never heard it before.”
And stopped.
She had forbidden him from trying to call, or text, or any conversing at all.
Then he was gone again.
He met them at the bottom, face set in stone.
He did as told, slowly, carefully. "It's me, Sam. I swear. Do the tests."
She straightened as he neared, holding out a hand. “Castiel Novak, I presume?”
A beat of silence, and Lucifer’s smile turned deadly. “Well, boys, enough with the foreplay. Let's do this.”
“It means until last week, I was still in rehab, physical therapy, and counseling.” He smiled softly. “I’m okay, though. Really.”
“He’s pretty outgoing,” Sam gave a huff of laughter, chin trembling. “We always said he could talk a bee out of its honey. He’s loud. I mean, he has this- this bright personality, you know what I mean?”
It was revealed in the next moment that Mary had brass knuckles, the sigil kind.
Sob after sob, body shaking with each labored inhale, he cried
It was decided that Charlie would stay there, and Castiel would continue by himself.
“Alright. Would you like to know the actual reason for this?”
“Let’s get him inside,” Sam said softly. “He shouldn’t be left out there.”
“Dean’s okay. They called me a few hours ago, told me to come down to the Sioux Falls station. I was kinda panicking, and forgot to call you, and then I put it off so I could see what condition he was in before I actually did.”
Opening his hand, he stared at the keys to the Impala.
Arms reached out, catching at his shirt, but he ducked inside.
He turned quickly, all but throwing himself at Dean, who caught him in a tight hug.
“Hey, no- sorry, I don’t-”
Gritting his teeth, he forced himself to think of something else.
He lifted his shirt slowly, revealing where the scars would be, if not covered in ink.
At that moment, they all became aware of the situation from a pained cry emanating from the upstairs.
“I hate them, Dean,” he said hollowly. “I don’t regret going after your mother, but I hate the way people stare if I wear a T-shirt, when people see the scars on my neck, and hands, and arms, and they look at me with disgust. Even after I got them covered, I hated that feeling. I don’t want you to- to see it, and…”
Was Michael still alive?
“Yes,” he answered honestly. “We were together. Is that a problem?”
Pamela’s office was on the first floor, across the entire building from the cafeteria, and he settled in for a long walk.
Calling Dean wasn't an option.
“I could’ve,” Dean agreed. “But you’re pretty cute when you’re asleep.”
And he felt the floor give in under him.
Michael spun around with a curse, his group scattering in front of him, and Dean’s gaze flew from face to face, scanning beyond the fire, eyes wide, and achingly hopeful.
“Don’t.” Dean stared straight ahead. “I can do it.”
Shaking his head, John smiled wryly. “No. I’d be a bad father if that bothered me. I just wanted to know. Dean, he- he never went out with anyone. After you disappeared, he was a wreck for months. Even now he refuses to go on dates, or anything. I’m pretty sure he’s still trying to find you.”
Her eyebrows drew together, and her eyes sparked with anger. “I can, Castiel. This is best for all of us.”
Me: Said I shouldn't be around you
On the day that marked three months of being there, a strange woman rode into town.
“Castiel, we need to have a discussion.”
They stayed silent for a while longer, content in their small bubble of peace.
Sam lunged forward, and caught her hand, tugging her back in the instant before she could disappear.
“No,” John rested his hand on his shoulder, giving it a quick squeeze. “Thank you. You saved my wife. I can never repay you for that.”
Castiel stiffened, and Dean noticed, pulling his hands away. “Sorry, I didn’t- sorry. I should’ve asked.”
Dean was here, Dean came after him, he's safe-
Cas pulled the boy into a tight hug. “You sure did, Sammy. Thank you.”
On top of Dean.
They both knew who he was talking about.
The diner looked the same.
us. You went off…”
A trembling smile spread over Castiel’s face. “Can I kiss you?”
"They're still here, right?"
Not looking away from the window, no matter how sick it made him, somehow felt like he could still keep watch, keep Cas safe.
Castiel let a tiny relieved sigh slip out. “Yeah. That’d be great.”
The last thing he saw before being pulled through the rift was Cas, just a few feet away, about to face the Devil.
Something.
“I prefer to keep to myself.”
“I don’t know. I need to call Bobby. And I don’t know how Dean would react to- well, anything.”
“Kelly’s gone.”
He took a step forward, Dean matching it. “I didn’t think he was lying, but…”
Naomi was just short of haughty, turning her nose up at the neighborhood, talking down to the residents…
He spun quickly, eyes widening.
“I pretended that I’d stopped, to placate her, but I never did, really. As soon as I was cleared for non-strenuous activities, I got a job. Took a while, but I saved enough to leave completely, and not rely on her anymore. I met Charlie, who helped me get an apartment, and took care of me on the really bad days. I don’t know what I would’ve done without her. She took me to doctors appointments, made sure I took my meds, and kept me fed. I owe her a lot. With all the bills, I didn’t have enough to come back yet. It took forever, it seems like, but we finally had enough, and we drove down a week ago. Ellen sent me to Bobby’s, where I saw your parents, who sent me this way.” He dragged in a breath. “I did my best to come back to you.”
“I always figured there was time, y’know?” Dean took another step forward, bringing him into arms reach. “Always enough time.”
Probably apple, he guessed.
Then Dean bent down, digging through his bag to find a small packet, which crinkled as he brought it out. "Did you like the pie?”
"Cas…"
Apparently not, though, because here he was, and as Sam’s eyes fell on his face, they widened, and a kaleidoscope of emotions washed across his face, foremost among them disbelief, followed by joy, and blinding relief. Castiel darted his gaze down to the knife, then back to the ropes, and back to Sam.
When Michael King rode into sight, it sparked a hatred as old as time in the blue-eyed rider’s heart.
Windows.
“You can do that?”
A quickly assembled campfire cast smoke past them, and the voices made it easy to move closer, disguising his footsteps under the loud bursts of laughter that erupt.
He ducked back inside.
“Your back got it the worst, but-”
Turning his gaze back to Sam, Dean’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his fingers resumed tapping.
The wound doesn't hurt.
Dimly, through the fog of sleep, he heard Dean chuckle softly. "Love you too sweetheart."
Castiel lifted his head to rest on Dean’s chest, while his arm wrapped tightly around Dean’s waist.
Castiel closed the phone with a soft click, and buried his face in his hands. “Okay. One down, one to go.”
Dean.
“Wait a second, how the hell did you –”
Dean pulled him closer, voice heavy. “That bad, huh?”
If Cas was gone, was this his body or did it belong to Jimmy Novak?
Sure enough, when Dean led the way into the kitchen, there was a pie on the counter cooling.
He jerked out of his reverie as Dean spoke,  tilting his head. "Mm?"
“Cas!” Dean yelled, struggling to break through. “Cas!
Even after the credits rolled, they sat in those seats, not wanting to move.
“Nothing except your name. Dean. I remembered that, and green eyes.  At first I thought it had been my name, but then I- I somehow knew it wasn’t. I don’t know. I’ve been trying to find you for so long, even when I didn’t- didn’t know who you were.”
Both grinning like idiots, Dean put him down, and laced their fingers together again. "So, Cas… be my boyfriend?"
It was beautiful.
He clawed a hand through the air, smiling leerily. “Look, seriously, I just wanted to say thank you for everything. I owe ya, kid.”
Dean was at the other end of the counter, smiling tightly at a blonde woman leaning down, showing the view of her… plentiful… cleavage.
He couldn’t speak, mouth slack.
“I could feel your pain. I wanted to make it right.”
“Can I go over and say hi?”
It was a familiar pattern, one they'd practiced for months.
He adjusted his position slightly, bringing his arms up to wrap around Dean, pressed against the back of the seat, and let out a breath.
“Alright.” She turned to leave, before glancing back. “Don’t overwhelm him. Have his brother come in alone, for now.”
“Yes. Amara and I.” Jack tilted his head. “I wouldn’t take you to heaven, Cas. Even if I was here, I wouldn't have taken you. There are… plans in place.”
Cas tensed, and Dean brushed the back of his hand over his fingers.
He glanced over to where the carved initials were, and stilled.
When there was no reaction to that either, he took a deep breath, and lifted gently.
“So fight, okay? Don’t give up. The nurses said you might be able to hear us talking to you, so please… please fight. Don’t you dare give up.”
He eyed her warily, dropping his backpack by the door. “About?”
Dean reached over, taking his hand again. “Just a couple blocks.”
“I always wanted you too,” Castiel said honestly. “I worried you might find it strange, though, so I didn’t ask.”
In the silence, the pain was overwhelming.
“Shh.” Cas gave him a considering look. “Do you know Morse code?”
He forced his hand to move, to squeeze, one.
An appraising look swept over him, and she turned back to the door. "Castiel? Come here."
The humming stopped, and Dean pressed a kiss to his cheek. "Yeah?"
“Hey,” he whispered back, voice croaking with sleep. “You should’ve woken me up.”
“Is there something I can do?” Castiel looked up at Meg. “The IV check. Is it-?”
Falling to his knees in front of the toilet, he vomited.
He climbed in with a grateful nod, shutting the door quietly.
Alcohol limited his senses, and clouded his mind.
Her eyes fluttered open, dazed, but she made no resistance.
Sam sat up, running a hand over his face. “She’s… she’s holding the kid.”
It was always easier to get drunk when he was human.
“I highly doubt you would be,” he said softly.
Without money, or transportation, he was stuck.
“But I should-”
“We gotta go!” Sam was yelling next to his ear.
Joy welled up in his chest, spilling over, and he could barely contain the smile as he turned around.
There was a sigh of relief.
Startled, he jerked back sharply, regretting it when her eyes narrowed.
“Is that your name?” Charlie leaned forward, eyes soft and curious.
“Can you tell her to fix an extra large one for her favorite customer?”
There, beside the S.W, M.W, JACK, and the D.W, carved with painstaking precision, was his own name.
With a tiny shake of his head, Dean pressed his face into Castiel’s hair. “I’m fine, I just- I missed you.”
Dean dropped his gaze to the sand between his boots. “Awesome.”
Anguish radiated from every line of Dean’s face, but he couldn’t speak again for the gag hastily shoved in his mouth.
The sky was really blue.
Five.
Then the young man was gone, and Cas was left standing in Lebanon Kansas.
When he woke, Dean was still there, eyes closed, and breath coming easily.
Very heroic.
They could get out the windows.
The sound roused Dean, who rolled over onto his back, yawning tiredly.
A dim light broke through the darkness, illuminating a familiar figure, outlined against the stairwell. “Dean?”
“Sure.”
He frowned, looking back to Cas. “Wait, Cas, how did this get here?”
“I usually take the outside.”
“Cas?”
“That isn’t what I mean.” the boy-god smiled wanly. “There are… I believe you know them as death books?”
“Then I evened the score by dying too.” Dean’s voice was soft, almost a whisper in the scant space between them. “Although you still had one up on me. I knew that you loved me. You didn’t know that I could have told you the same.”
“The doctors said it could’ve been worse. Would’ve been worse, if it wasn’t for you. Sammy is asleep outside, and Dad’s visiting Mom. We’re all worried. You’ve flatlined twice already.”
Dean pulled away from Sam, glancing between Crowley and Sam. “What is he
A flash of pain raced through his side, making him flinch, and Dean’s brow furrowed, eyes slowly opening.
"I missed you too." Dean pulled him closer, tail curling around him, and chin resting on top of his head. "You don't need to answer now, okay? Get some rest."
Cas tilted his head, a small smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. “Alright.”
He held tight to Dean's hand, following mutely as he led towards the back bedroom.
The teacher waved him to a seat, calling the class to order.
“Of course. Get some sleep.”
“Covered them meaning…”
“You looked peaceful,” Dean shrugged softly. “I figured you didn’t have a lot of opportunities to relax, so I thought I’d let you sleep.”
It wasn’t what he had thought Dean would say.
He said as much to Charlie, who laughed. "I can't wait to try everything."
He accepted.
"Well, I mean, not crystal clear." Castiel narrowed his eyes playfully. "Maybe you should run it by me again, just to make sure."
Something sour reached his nose, and he recoiled.
“Hold this, Dean!”
After paying for tickets, Dean pulled him through the door, and led him to the back of the rows of seats.
“I love you too. Not like a brother, or like a friend. Losing you nearly killed me, and I hope to-” Dean laughed shakily. “Well, to Jack, that I never have to again.”
“Alright. How’s he doing?”
“What,” Dean said teasingly. “No more hugs for me? I see how it is.”
“Sheriff Mills? This is Castiel Novak.”
Mary knelt beside him, hand coming up to brush his hair out of his eyes. “Yeah?”
“Will you come with me?”
He pulled the door shut, and entered Dean’s room next.
“I heard your prayers.” This time Jack looked apologetic. “I couldn’t return, though. We-”
When he looked up, it seemed as though Dean’s mind had wandered again, and he didn’t respond when he slipped his hand out of his friend’s grip, and opened the door to glance around for Jody, who was standing down the hall, conversing with one of the nurses.
Dean bent down to grab something from a drawer, and straightened, holding a small bundle. “I guess. It’s not bad. Only missing a few things.”
He'd been through an emotional wringer, and this would just make it worse.
“No change.”
Cas was woken by quiet humming, and the brightness of sunlight showing red through his eyelids.
“Here, Dean.” Cas pressed two fingers to his forehead, and Dean went slightly cross-eyed trying to keep them in his vision.
“I love you.”
He closed his eyes, staving off a fresh wave of pain.
Red faced and panting, Dean pushed the door open, beckoning him inside when he hesitated. "C'mon! Mom needs to meet you."
The stash was running out though, and he’d have to hunt soon.
As it turned out, he was very good with a gun.
Deep breath.
His expression looked lost, and he faltered when there was no response.
“Gotcha.” She tapped her fingers on the desk slowly. “I guess you miss him a lot, hm? I can hear it in your voice.”
They spent the entirety of the movie in that position, and he didn’t catch a single scene.
Rolling over took more strength than he had guessed, and he was left panting, trying not to cry out from the pain.
“That’s-” he shook his head. “That’s not any better.”
Dean looked away.
Seconds passed as Dean stood there, unmoving.
“Better?”
A cave beckoned his weary body, and he slipped in easily, groaning in relief as the soft sand welcomed him.
No- not angry- furious.
Footsteps drew their attention, and John stepped in. “Castiel?”
Dean’s eyes followed the movement, small as it was, smile softening. “I’d be thinking the same thing, don’t worry.”
"Don't wanna leave," he said tiredly, barely legible in his sleep-thickened voice. "Love you."
“This is gonna work.” Dean smiled reassuringly, putting on the facade easily. “It has to.”
“Dad liked angels,” Castiel said quietly. “That’s why he named me after one.”
“The-” Dean swallowed tightly. “The kid?”
The encampment was loud, evidently not expecting anyone, and that added a point in his favor.
“Get away from them.”
He felt the tension ebb slightly, and Cas tapped one finger against his knuckle.
The voice startled him out of his thoughts, and he glanced up quickly. “Hm?”
The voice rose, dipped, softened, before trailing into another set of words.
Dean: Behind you.
“But, y’know,” Lucifer continued. “Little slugger’s almost here, and, uh… Well, I’m on the clock.”
The two headed for the stairs.
Cas watched blankly as Sam left the room before turning to the hallway.
Both were quiet, minds elsewhere.
Despite her words, she was nothing but gentle, helping him limp to the door.
screams regret pain empty EMPTY
The rift flared again, and Cas pushed between them roughly, striding forward with an angel blade in his hand.
Cas fired off a quick text, asking Sam to stop at his apartment on the way tomorrow, and pack some essentials for him.
In the middle, though, eight year old Sam was beaming as he held a sign up. BE MY BROTHER FOR REAL?
Maybe this boy was the best friend of someone on shore, who was waiting for him to come back.
Three quick taps. Pause. Tap. Long tap. Pause. Two long taps.
"Okay, yeah," the redhead puffed, slinging her arm through his. "But I got news."
“There’s room for you too,” Cas replied nonchalantly.
Castiel shrugged lightly. “Great.”
Dean’s knees gave out, landing him on the bed with a jolt.
The door opened, just a crack.
Contrary to the outside appearance, the inside of Dean’s small apartment was well-decorated, and the scent of freshly baked pie filled the air..
If the wetness on his shoulder was any indication, Dean was too.
He relinquished the phone, watching as Dean’s expressions changed to match his words.
“When that didn’t work, she made a deal with me. If I gave up trying to contact anyone from our old life, she would donate to help your family rebuild.”
The second thing he noticed was that he was abnormally calm.
His side throbbed, but he pushed it to the back of his mind, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed with a grimace.
A warm smile spread over John’s face, and he nodded. “I can do that.”
Jody waited til the nurse was gone before leaning on the back of the chair. “Castiel, I’m going to have to be honest with you. I don’t know if him staying with you is the best idea.”
He set the duffle bag on the table, letting go a weary sigh.
A scream of pain was wrenched from him when he slammed into the unforgiving cliffs, sharp rocks slicing easily through his skin before the wave retreated, leaving him trembling with pain, and curled around the small outcrop.
Flames hissed and crackled.
"Good."
“Not sure you’ll be hungry after this.”
Every breath stung his throat.
"Hi," Dean said softly. "My name's Dean. Wanna come play cars and armies?"
Jack smiled softly. “If you stop throwing yourself into needlessly risky hunts.”
This time, when he moved Dean's hand off, he had no reaction, save for his breath quickening, before Castiel was lacing their fingers together, and holding tightly.
Castiel cut him off, squeezing his hand gently. “I know, just- anyone who saw them was disgusted, and so “-’ he faltered, eyes burning a hole in the leg of his jeans. “I covered them.”
“Lucifer?” Eyes widening, Cas looked sharply to the other two.
There was a brief moment of silence with him struggling to find words, then he let out a breath. “Cas, you know that’s not true.”
The door creaked as it was pushed open, and Jo backed in, carrying a covered tray.
Shrugging, he raised his eyebrows at his best friend. "Is that what you were gonna ask?"
He nodded firmly, giving Dean's hand a gentle squeeze. "Very sure. I've been looking for Dean for years. No way am I letting him go again."
The curtain rustled, and Dean stepped out, followed by Sam, both men inhaling sharply at the sight of Castiel.
Dean watched, motionless, as one of their only allies- sometimes friend- fell to the ground.
He stayed bent over the sink, letting the water drip from his face, and suddenly it wasn’t all sink water, and he was crying.
“Sam said you were- hands off.”
“What happened to
“I borrowed Charlie’s car,” he said softly.
The breath rushed out of his lungs in a gasp as she crashed into him in a tight hug.
Each time he stopped to rest, he ate a small handful of snails.
“I mean he can’t talk,” she said bluntly. “We don’t know whether it’s psychological or physical. There are injuries to his throat that could be causing it, but he might just be… not talking. So you need to prepare yourself for that.”
He definitely liked that option.
Letting out a choked breath, Dean turned his attention to the cuffs.
“Can you stay in there for a few minutes?” He fidgeted awkwardly, fingers twisting into his shirt hem. “I- I need a few minutes. I dunno, just to… take everything in?”
He shook his head lightly, inwardly cursing as the slight movement set his head to throbbing again.
There would be plenty of time for that in the future.
It was the wrong move though, and Dean squeezed tighter.
Dean grinned eagerly, accepting the bundle. “They have a kid my age!”
“A while?” Dean laughed in disbelief, pulling back enough to see him fully, but not enough to let go. “A freakin while? You disappeared, man! I didn’t know if you were okay, I didn’t know if you were even still alive. What the hell happened?”
A choked sound emitted from Cas' throat, and the tip of an angel blade appeared in the center of his chest.
“They’re beautiful,” Dean repeated. “Are they angel wings?”
The first gentle press of their lips was perfect, sending happiness through his veins like a drug.
Jody sighed. "Alright."
“Jerk,” Sam said in return.
“It’s- it’s really bad.”
The walk was spent talking quietly, about anything and everything, at the same time.
“Big.”
“Dean, can you hear me?” Cas’ heart leapt when his best friend’s gaze flitted to him, and he gave the slightest of nods. “Good, good, that’s- good.”
Castiel turned his head, pressing closer. “You too,” he mumbled softly, too soft to be heard, so he repeated it. “I love you too.” He felt Dean’s breath catch, and he pressed his lips to the side of Dean’s neck. “I do.”
Closing his eyes, the thought struck that this felt like those times he’d prayed to Cas, with no one listening on the other end.
As soon as the window was mostly clear, he shot a quick glance through.
On the fifth ring, the phone was answered by a breathless voice. “Y’ello Cas. What’s up?”
He closed his eyes tiredly. “That’s as good a name as any.”
“Where is he?”
That only made it worse, because the glass pane faced into the sandy backyard, and showed the shadowed outline of his best friend’s body.
She managed to convince him of her trustworthiness, and she spent the next hour detailing what had gone down the night before he woke with no memory.
Silently agreeing with him, Castiel laced their fingers together. “We can talk more in the morning,” he took in a deep breath. “There’s still a lot to talk about. It can wait though. Good night, Dean.”
“Sam. Calm down. Of course you can. We’ll have to figure out where you’ll stay, of course. We’re still in Sioux Falls, and I’m trying to get an apartment here. Dean will be staying in the hospital for the immediate future. I wanted to talk to you and Bobby about it, actually. How do you feel about Dean staying with me for the foreseeable future? You and Bobby both have lives of your own, and jobs, you have school, and so on. I know both of you would drop it all in a heartbeat, but I don't want you to put your lives on hold. I was thinking since I work from home, and have the funds from the book I wrote, and a lot of free time, I might be the best choice.”
"We all taught ourselves Morse code, remember that? We'd use it to talk during class, so the teacher couldn't hear us. You were better at it than I was, and Sam was better than both of us. But we made our own little names using it. Specific taps that were solely ours."
“You will never be welcome here again,” Michael hissed. “You’ve betrayed everything we stand for, Castiel. You saved a human. I cannot forgive you for this. You’re not welcome in this land, and you’re not welcome in this family.”
"'S okay, just tell me next time." Dean pressed a small bag into his hand. "I got you chocolate."
"Yes, sweetheart." Mary kissed his forehead. "Maybe he needs a friend."
"Step back. Now."
Lucifer batted him aside, and Cas landed heavily on his arm.
Most likely there wouldn't be one.
Lucifer ran his tongue over the split lip. “Cute. Is that all you got, mama?”
The corner of his mouth lifted in a slight smile. "Firmly attached to my shoulders, thank you."
A sound cut through the air.
So everyone would’ve stayed away from them, most people did, but the Winchesters lived next door, and seven year old Dean had gotten a glimpse at the bluest eyes he'd ever seen, and decided that he was going to be friends with the boy.
He followed silently, ascending the stairs he had descended only five minutes prior, but this time the arm around him was holding him closer than strictly required, and Dean kept glancing over at him as if making sure he was still there.
Behind Michael, two men on each side, Sam and Dean knelt, restrained.
“They’re inside.” Jack gestured behind them both. “I brought the car too, so… Dean can drive you both back to the bunker.”
The bullets slammed into Lucifer’s chest, the jacket being torn to shreds.
He should be freaking out, but instead he was laying here calmly cataloguing his pain levels.
The bite of pain focused him, and he looked to the sky, not even trying to hide the wetness in his eyes. "What happened?"
He kept glancing back and forth between his silent brother and best friend, but it seemed like he was finally understanding.
A flash of alarm showed in Cas’ eyes, and he hurried to catch up, with Dean right behind them. “Wait, Sam-”
Then…
Moving the limbs was even harder, for one reason: stiffness was beginning to set in.
There.
He looked down, hardly understanding what he was seeing.
Dean glanced up at the hopeful tone, brow furrowed. “I’ve always been right here, waiting for you.”
"You're just like them," she sighed. "Sam and Dean are the most stubborn men I’ve ever met. Alright, fine. Don't blame me if I drop you, ya big lug."
“Stop it,” he whispered shakily. “Stop it, stop it, stop it. Don’t do this. Not now. He needs you.”
He could smell something soothing, it smelled like-
"No."
A stiff smile appeared as she took it. "Thank you."
“Yes. And- Jody?”
He was gone the same way he’d appeared, silent, and in his place came the sound of footsteps that Cas knew better than his own.
“What should we call you?” Charlie leaned against the side of the bed. “I’ve been calling you Steve in my head. You look like a Steve.”
“Castiel… were you and Dean… together?”
Mostly he was numb.
Now he reached, slow and silent, into the sheath, taking one out, and holding it gripped between his fingertips.
The cliff dropped away steeply from the heels of his boots, and in front of him, he could hear the sharp laughter of his brother.
The Winchesters didn't have a lot in the first place, and would be struggling.
Whatever happened, however they felt, whether friends or together, he had always been the only one who made Castiel truly happy.
Slowly, he did as told, leaning into Dean’s embrace, and resting his head in the crook of his shoulder.
It should’ve been awkward, but it wasn’t.
“That wasn’t his ending.” Jack lifted one shoulder. “I only got back yesterday, and I… set it to rights.”
It was him.
“All right. I’m Doctor Macleod, and this is my assistant, Charlene.”
"Jack, please. Sam said you're God now, and-"
The storm was coming.
It had always been him who was gone, Dean had always been left behind, and now he knew why Dean had made the deal for Sam, because although the feelings were different, the motivation was the same.
“Sir, can you make it down here?”
A bearded man sat on the front porch, watching him as he approached.
They stepped down from the porch in a line, presenting a united front to the enemy.
the gesture seemed to say.
“You did though, Cas. You lied to me. We don’t do that. We promised each other.”
“Saving your ass,” Dean said sharply.
Dean’s eyes widened and he sat up, all teasing gone from his expression. “You think that?”
“Please.”
The thought had him taking a faltering step towards the back door.
He didn’t even notice Pamela leaving, shutting the door quietly.
"You were never-" Dean groaned. "Cas. Please, I'm serious. I need you to be serious too."
Dean stared at him in silence, eyes searching his face, tongue darting out to wet his lips, trying to talk but nothing coming out-
"I thought he was dead-"
Undeterred by the sharp question, John continued. “Dean… he said a few things that made me think there was something going on between you two.”
Home base was the bunker.
Somehow he knew what Dean was trying to say, and gave a small laugh. “No, she’s- in her own words- the Queen of the Gays. She came on this trip with me, but volunteered to stay behind in Lawrence. I think she may like Jo.”
Soon enough, he was on the ground, shivering slightly as he searched for his best friend.
“They’re good to come in,” he said quickly. “They just got in from California.”
“Okay, okay- I don’t think I’ll be driving that long, so should I- should I go to the hospital or the station?”
“Good, all right. Do you remember what happened?”
“Green eyes.”
Low, gentle, soothing.
Castiel smiled shakily, ducking his head. “Thank you.”
Long tap.
"I'm holding your hand because I want to," he said softly. "I can stop if you want."
Name.
“Say your goodbyes, Castiel.”
He pressed his back against the wall of the same room where, unbeknownst to him, Dean had sat months earlier mourning his death.
Several seconds passed, Castiel drinking in the comfort he hadn’t realized he needed.
They sat in silence for the next half hour, Castiel running through the papers, filling out blank spaces, looking up every few minutes to find Dean still watching him, then repeating the process.
“Jody?”
Surely that was important, but he couldn’t think past the pain.
No words, but the voice was higher, and younger.
“Since when have I set that kind of example? Running into a burning building?”
Gentle fingers probed at his injuries, Dean frowning when he flinched. "C'mon, let's get you back to bed."
“See you two lovebirds later.”
“Right.” He took a deep breath, pulling every ounce of courage he possessed. “Your dad, he said- he said that you never tried dating, after… He said he thought you were- waiting? For me?”
Dean: Everything okay?
“Hello Jo.”
“Give me your hand.”
And Castiel saw an opening.
When Castiel nodded, their friendship was cemented, and he could see the happiness reflected in his friend's eyes.
His fiance grinned. “I can’t wait.”
“You’re in Lawrence General ICU. Your family is here, okay? I need to go get Doctor Milton, and I’ll be right back.”
“Green eyes,” Castiel Novak stared at the tabletop blankly. “A scar on the right side of his face,” he gestured to a spot on his temple, right below the hairline. “A really small one that he got from falling off the bed when we were eleven.”
“Not really.” Castiel gave a tiny smile. “I am fully recovered, except for the scars.”
He fumbled with the latches for several seconds, gasping for breath, and slumped against it.
Not thinking anything of it, Castiel matched his pace.
Shooting him an amused glance, Castiel tossed the phone onto the coffee table. “Complete honesty, remember?”
With renewed force in his voice, he opened his eyes, glaring at the night sky. “And now you’re gonna bring him back. You’re going to bring Cas back. After everything you’ve done, you
Every monster that he killed was one less to take someone else’s family away.
While she waited, he noticed her eyes restlessly roamed about the room, and they widened when she saw him. “What’s your name?”
Green eyes.
The next time he woke up, he knew he was awake for good.
“Not for long, Charlie assured me.”
But the green eyes had been wide with panic, and Castiel dove, thinking, what if it had been his best friend?
"Do tell."
Then he started weaving.
“Which side do you usually take?”
“C’mon Cas. I’m bored, and the movie starts in twenty minutes. I refuse to let your schoolwork get in the way of life, and to let you end up as a hermit that’s only interested in his books.”
They were still blocks away when they saw the smoke pouring into the sky.
His best friend was gone.
“I hate to say it, but you’re right. What can I do? Can I bring anything? What about Jess?”
“Good luck.”
Instead of grabbing the milk, as had been his original intention, he grabbed a beer.
Chin up, eyes straight ahead, refusing to meet Castiel’s gaze.
He couldn’t read more.
Using their linked hands to tug him closer, Dean pressed their foreheads together, his smile soft. “You don’t have to anymore.”
"I know who you are, Castiel. Come on in."
“Is he still at the hospital?”
A small laugh forced its way out, and he dropped his head. "Fine."
After what felt like hours of staring at the ceiling, the humming sound of the machines, and the steady drip of the IV finally lured him to sleep.
He got the call from Sam at seven that evening, giving them a heads up that him and Jess were on their way from the airport.
“She said she didn’t approve.” When Dean tilted his head, bewildered, he let out a breath. “Of us.”
No matter the circumstances, hearing his best friend’s voice sent a current of relief through him, and he breathed a slight sigh of relief.
For a moment Castiel was confused, then he saw the small chocolate drops on the front of the bag. "I love chocolate."
Ben nodded, dropping the subject. “Mind if I play some music?”
Dean loaded one of the guns, eyes tracking Cas as he disappeared up the stairs.
Eleven.
This was permanent.
She sighed. “You really should get out for a bit. It’s not good for you to sit here day in and day out.”
It looked painfully fake.
“Could you maybe… video me? So I can see him?”
Halfway through, Dean pulled a small, crinkling package out of his pocket, holding it up with a smile. "I got chocolate!"
“Thank you.” Cas stepped onto the pavement, giving a grateful smile. “For the ride, the company… the music. Thank you.”
When they broke the kiss, Dean guided him to the old armchair, sitting, and pulling Castiel down on top of him. “Alright, I’ll answer your questions, on one condition. I need more kisses. I’m severely deprived.”
Then Sam was backing away with a joyful smile, and Dean took his place in front of Castiel, hands running over his shoulders, and down his sides.
Sam’s bedroom was empty, and he turned back to the stairs, and Dean’s room beyond it.
Castiel slammed his palms against the remaining shards of glass, not caring about the ragged mess his hands were becoming.
Heavy waves battered at him, sending him careening off course, and dangerously near the sharp rocks at the water's edge.
The effort was futile, and Dean’s mind seemed to have wandered away again.
He didn't know how to live in a world without Dean Winchester, never thought he'd be in this position.
Bustling, loud, and smelling of the best food in Lawrence.
Every plea was in vain, though.
Then someone else was humming.
“Happy, huh?” Dean shot him a warm glance before returning his gaze to the road. “Really?”
When he was finished, he leaned forward, wrapping his arms around Castiel, and clasped his hands together in front of them, pulling him back to lean against Dean. “I love you,” he whispered. “So much. I always have. And these scars are anything but repulsive to me. They show how brave you were. Running into a burning building, saving my mom, you didn’t even hesitate. The firefighters hesitated, Cas. They were too worried about the stability to take the risk, but you did. I’m so proud of you. For everything. Getting away from your mother, making your own life, for trusting me with this… I look at you, and I am so, so happy that I got you back.”
John had something to say, he guessed.
If her voice was anything to go on at the moment, she seemed more relieved he was responding than put out.
Cas watched him sadly. "I understand."
Dean’s smile widened slightly, and Cas watched with an aching warmth filling his chest.
Every step hurt.
“Look, Sam's right, okay? We'll work through our crap.” Dean met Cas’ eyes briefly, glancing away again to gesture at the door. “We always do. But right now, we are here to get you, get Kelly, and get gone.”
He could feel the skeptical look aimed his way.
He kept his eyes on Michael, pulling a pistol out of his belt with his left hand, and backing up until he felt Sam’s hand close around it. “Get Dean free,” he ordered.
"Yeah, okay." Castiel gave him a quizzical smile. "As long as you don't ask me about whether it was me that pranked you on April 1st. You might not like that answer."
He stepped forward, footsteps soft in the hard packed dirt, until he was standing halfway between the two sides. “Come on.”
“Dean.” Mary was holding a tiny bundle, but her eyes were warm, and sad. “I’m sorry.”
Each hunt left its own mark, and seeing children dead by monstrous hands never got easier.
He shrugged weakly, barely hiding the wince as pain flared up in his side.
Lucifer shivered melodramatically. “You're
Draping Dean’s arm over his shoulders, he lifted them both to some semblance of standing.
Then their peaceful, happy bubble was shattered by the wailing of a siren, and a firetruck sped past.
The call had come two hours ago, when he was still in bed, and he had answered with a groggy “Novak here.”
Maybe he’d failed. Missed the shot.
Grinning smugly, Castiel draped his arms over Dean's shoulders. "Do I get to claim a prize?"
"Ellen." His voice was dangerously calm. "What happened?"
Recognizing it as Charlie’s ringtone, Castiel reached over the edge of the couch, finding his backpack, and answering the phone.
With that thought, he started walking.
It was soft, unsure, and all the sweeter for it.
The laugh made him feel warm inside, and with a sudden burst of courage, he laced their fingers together.
Warm breath on his cheek, and lips pressed against his forehead, dry, with the raspy feel of stubble.
Longer tap.
"Ask me something only I would know." He was so, so tired, but he knew these small rituals had to be done for everyone's peace of mind.
Short tap.
“I gave Dean enough time to say goodbye to his family in heaven. They were all happy. Bobby said that he knew it wasn’t Dean’s time.”
“Just- my name. Sam.” He turned back to Dean, his own smile growing. “Yeah, it’s me. I’m right here, Dean.”
He traveled without stopping for what felt like forever, tail burning and arms aching from slamming into rocks under the cover of darkness
The server was a certain blonde that he knew quite well, and as soon as she turned to get his order, her eyes tripled in size, and her mouth dropped open.
And, as he realized looking down, his clothes as well.
“Great, thanks. I need to let you go. I’ll text with updates, okay?”
Mary should be in the living room, straight through the kitchen.
Me: Watching for me, I think
“So Apocalypse, take two. That's your plan?” Dean nodded slowly. “Well color me unimpressed.”
Every sensation was too big, too loud.
“You look like you’re thinking deep thoughts over there,” Dean said softly. “Mind sharing with the class?”
Castiel returned his smile, stuffing his hands in his pockets. “You still bake all the time?”
“Uh, and that means?” Dean stepped forward, forcing Cas to meet his eyes. “What’s goin’ on here Cas?”
“What if this is a dream?” He shook his head tightly. “I don’t want you to disappear.”
The text was answered with an enthusiastic 'sure!', and he dropped the phone onto the mattress beside him.
Tilting his head, Castiel scooted closer, only for Dean to shake his head, and prod him to his feet.
Everywhere he looked, he felt the absence of his hunter keenly.
“You’ll see. We can head up there now, if you want?”
Description of missing person:
“Hello Dean.”
His eyes had something over them, it felt like some type of cloth.
A gasp drew his attention, and he turned to see Mary in the doorway, hand over her mouth. "Castiel?"
It looked normal, at least on the surface.
Castiel tilted his head slightly. “And what would that be?”
Jack shook his head. “No. You both deserve good things, Cas. You’ve given everything for this world. It’s time to take something for your own.”
He could hear the undercurrent of tension in his best friend’s voice.
He nodded, staying quiet, mind whirling.
Bobby disappeared, and Castiel stepped to the living room.
Then he lifted his gaze, and couldn't stop the sharp inhale.
“Cas?” Dean’s hand froze on his back. “You’re kinda- not breathing. Did I-?”
“Okay,” she shrugged. “Don’t get your hopes up.”
Turning back to the kitchen, he didn’t wait for Sam to follow.
“I’m so sorry, my husband had an early shift, and the alarm is broken. I’m so sorry.”
"We-" he coughed quietly, looking down at his hands. "We used to hide under your big blanket and talk about how we'd live together when we were older, and run a bakery. Even had a name picked out. Well, several names. You made each one into a pun. 'Life is what you bake it'. 'Another one bites the Crust'. 'For goodness Bakes'. 'Ryes and Shine'."
Dean stared blankly at the opposite wall, seemingly oblivious to the stare of his younger brother.
He turned to find her sitting at the desk, strangely. Usually she used the armchair by the fake fireplace.
Dean flinched at the sudden noise, but the corners of his mouth twitched.
His voice was quiet, a tiny, broken thing. "We looked everywhere, for someone, something that could fix it. How are you here?"
His best friend lay beside him, head resting on his arm, the other outstretched toward Castiel, fingers twitching slightly.
“Wouldn’t have it any other way.” Meg raised her eyebrow, jerking her head back towards the other bed, where Dean was leaned against the inclined bed, hands folded in his lap. “You’re up.”
Mary wasn’t even conscious at this point, and he crumpled to his knees, gasping harshly.
A dull tingling spread over his body, and the beeping sped up.
Cas reached for his hand, flipping his own over, and waiting.
Panic tightened his throat, and for a moment he couldn’t answer.
He was alone, and he recognized the room and bed he was in.
“Something wrong?”
He laughed, emotion choking his throat. "I missed you so much."
“Okay, alright.”
Castiel wrenched several kelp strands from the seabed, selecting the largest and widest leaves, setting them aside, and then using the rest to bind his injuries.
“We were so worried,” she said quietly, voice shaking. “Then your mom took you- and we didn’t-”
A faint scent of alcohol and gunpowder filled the air, reminiscent of Dean, and he rested a hand on the mattress.
“First question. How long has- Dean, was it? How long has he been gone?”
Her and Sam were already sitting down, and their eyes immediately went to Dean and Castiel’s intertwined hands, but neither mentioned it.
She shook her head, turning to scan the room again. “Listen. I’m not looking for a reward. A guy I know said you were- someone important to him and his brother, and he promised I’d get the reward if I found you, or information about you, but that’s not why I’m doing this.”
Each step felt like the weight of a million.
“After you’re released from here, we were thinking that you could stay with me.” Cas shrugged weakly, fingers restlessly playing with the hem of his shirt. “Are you okay with that?”
The minute he stepped inside, he was immediately pulled into a tight hug.
He didn't fall asleep.
Crowley held up his bloody, bandaged hand. “I improvised. Lucky I did. Turns out I'm the answer to all your problems.”
Ten minutes later, he got to the door, knocking quickly, and leaning back.
Wetness brushed his fingertips, and Dean gripped his hand with both of his own. “Don’t do this to me,” he ordered, voice shaking. “Please, Cas- Not again.”
Sam kept his hand wrapped firmly around Dean’s forearm, stopping him from moving, but he couldn’t find it in himself to pull away.
They stopped talking suddenly, Jo ducking her head.
And it was a wanted poster.
“You’re a dead man, Milton.” Michael backed up a step. “You’re lying. You’re alone.”
“A long time,” he finished.
“Sit.”
Castiel nodded quickly, trying to push down his ridiculously huge smile. “Yeah, alright.”
When that cut Dean's stammering off, he continued. "I have for a long time. I never wanted to bring it up because I didn't want to lose this. I didn't know if you were even- I thought you were straight for our entire lives. I never thought I had a chance, so I never told you."
“Listen, if we, uh…” Sam trailed off, slowing down just outside the door. “Cas?” He said slowly. “What is that?”
Castiel jerked awake.
He tried to glare, but based on the way Dean chuckled, it didn’t have the intended effect.
Before he could answer, Dean tipped his chin up with one finger, leaning back in to kiss him.
Cas curled his fingers into a fist so he wouldn’t be tempted to reach out.
“Hello.” Jack raised a hand calmly.
Crowley let an angel blade drop into his hand. “You’re right.” Glancing back at Sam and Dean, he gave a half smile and nod. “Goodbye boys.”
“Dean, how about you two go to town, alright? Maybe see a movie?” Mary pushed her chair back, putting her hands on her hips. “I’ll need to check something out.”
He laughed wetly, curling in on himself. “You said you loved us, and you said all of us, but you were looking at me, and I thought-” he broke off again, struggling to keep his voice even.
The one that Alastair and his cronies had taken the week before.
Castiel looked up, raising his eyebrows. “What?”
The boy-god nodded serenely, lowering his hand to his side. “Yes.”
He didn’t let go.
And then, in an infinitesimal second, he saw.
These inane questions stopped him from thinking, really.
“But he’s back? He’s okay?”
He had rested enough that he could actually hunt, and he managed to catch several smaller fish, of which he ate half, saving the rest for the next day.
The pain must be making him dizzy, he decided.
“See, I’ve had a lot of time to- to go over everything you said.” Dean lifted a shoulder, warmth hiding in his eyes. “And, not gonna lie, I’m a little bit pissed. You just had to tell me you loved me right when I couldn’t say it back.”
“That is what tends to happen when someone’s born,” Dean said flatly. “Have you found a way to... take care of it?”
“I know, sweetheart.” Dean pressed a kiss to his cheek. “I’ll go get us both some food, okay? I can be really quick.”
With nothing left to say, Sam let out a quiet breath, and left the room.
“I missed you.” Pressing his face into Dean’s shoulder, he took a shuddering breath. “I missed you so much.”
"I have become very good at annoying cosmic entities," Cas informed him, straight faced. And then, in a more serious tone. "And there is nothing that can keep me from coming back to you both."
It only took a few seconds for him to break, and he repeated Naomi’s words from the night before.
His hands tightened reflexively on the gun he was holding.
“Tell your men to stand down, and we’ll do this like men. You and me, King. Face me.”
Officers flanked the doors, and he gave them a nod and a tight smile.
Castiel squeezed his hand. “It was stupid." He grinned slightly before letting it fall. "I don’t regret it though.”
The smell of blood in the water would attract sharks if he wasn’t careful.
It was already two in the morning, and no self-respecting human being would be awake.
"The neighbor boy would like to 'play' with you."
Mary stumbled back, away from the portal, her shoulders heaving as she gasped for breath.
The rift pulsed, and Cas landed back on the ground.
She glanced up with a curious smile on her face. “Yeah?”
“No, Cas. Pretty far from all right. I mean, we've got Lucifer on this side,” he pointed towards the house, then the portal. “We've got Mad Max World on that side. I mean, yeah, we've been down before, but this? I-I mean, I don't even know where to start.”
With a shaky nod, Jo backed into the kitchen, not taking her eyes off him.
“His name is Dean Michael Winchester,” a red-eyed teenage boy responded. “My name is Sam. Dean’s my older brother. He was born on January 24, 1979. He was born in Lawrence Kansas-”
He eyed her suspiciously, but her innocent grin gave nothing away.
“Cas, no-” Dean protested.
He had no idea how long he’d been staring when Dean stirred, pulling in a heavy breath, and rolling closer, pulling Castiel against him.
"Just a small one. I handled it." He smoothly accelerated out of the parking lot.
He tugged him backwards, but Dean kept his eyes on the scene unfolding in front of them.
“You’re amazing.”
“What are you saying?” His own voice was soft, a little bit shaky.
Early morning, really.
"Oh."
Me: She's trying to take me away
To his surprise, the door was unlocked, and opened without a sound..
She left, and they were truly alone for the first time in five years.
Harvelle’s Roadhouse.
The thought made him hurry through the ritual of putting on shoes and a coat, grabbing something extra, and then racing through the yard to the other driveway.
“Oh, yeah.” Dean glanced at Cas, who was staring at them in confusion. “The supernatural wasn't real.”
“See you tomorrow night, hopefully.”
Doing homework.
He's going to die out here, and he deserves it.
“Wait for just a minute,” he said softly.
"I need to ask you something, Cas," Dean said quickly. "And I really need you to answer truthfully."
Dean smoothed his hand over Castiel’s shoulder, and he realized he still wasn’t wearing a shirt.
Eyes wet.
Castiel hummed. "Should I take that to mean you like me back?" He stared at Dean intently, fighting a smile.
"You can do it, just breathe with me, like that- yeah, okay, you're doing good-"
“I’m a minor,” he said dully. “I can’t stop her.”
"He needs to stay here for the moment, but we'll need to arrange a living situation within three weeks."
Turning away abruptly, he passed over the door of where Kelly Kline’s body lay.
The bunker would be a long trek from here, but he should make it before dark.
“Is that-” she took a deep breath. “Is that your real name?”
“Hello Sam.”
"Was that okay?" Hesitantly smiling, Dean traced his collarbone with one warm finger.
he thought suddenly.
Glancing sideways again, Dean let out a heavy breath. “Do you have a car? Or do you… want a ride, maybe?”
As she turned to smile at them, the sigils glowed red. “I love you.”
“What?” Dean shook his head quickly, holding him tighter. “No way, Cas. I will always come after you. I promise. You’re- you mean a hell of a lot to me, Cas. No way was I gonna let you go.”
Simultaneously they leaned forward, wrapping their arms around each other, and letting out matching happy sighs.
"Dean."
Cas moved closer, leaning against Dean, and relaxing as he felt a warm arm wrap around his shoulders.
The pain was slowly building, numbing him to outside interference.
