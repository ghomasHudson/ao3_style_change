Sam crept back to his room. He kissed Eileen lightly, not waking her. Kneeling down by his side of the bed, Sam considered praying to Cas but it didn’t feel right. Not with how dead set Dean seemed against it. However, there was someone Sam talked to regularly, and it didn’t feel wrong to talk to him about two of the people that they cared about the most.
“You bellowed?” Gabriel says as he appears in front of them. “Oh hey Francine!” He says to the raptor. “Did you get out of your room again.” The raptor comes to a stop in front of him and he scratches her under the chin. “And where’s…” Gabriel looks around and points to a break in the trees. “Gladys! I see you!” Another raptor walks out of the trees and joins them. “Clever girl.” he says and gives her chin scratches too. “Okay time to get you back where you belong.” Gabriel snaps his fingers and the velociraptors disappear.
“It’s my fault. I gave your daughter a cookie and Scrooge over here thinks it was one too many.” Dean says while signing.
I'm going to try super hard to finish this by Christmas, but it might be a few days after. Thanks everyone who has read, commented and left kudos!
Meg sighs. “I can’t deny it. He really knows what makes these former meat bags tick. Gabriel is good at his job.”
Sam walks through his house checking the doors and windows. He does this sometimes. Not as much as he used to. His house is warded after all. Plus they are starting to make real headway against the things that go bump in the night. Being able to coordinate with hunters all across the world not being held back by a puppeteer pulling their strings, the tide was actually turning in their favour. His operation was making a real difference. Still there was a part of Sam that would always worry that one day he would look into one of his daughters’ rooms and there would be something there that wasn’t supposed to be. Not tonight though. Tonight his daughters slept deeply and peacefully. He rubbed their backs and fixed their blankets. His heart felt full. He didn’t know what he’d done to get so lucky. He checked in on his brother too. Dean’s blanket was half on the floor and it was clear that he had had a tough time falling asleep. Sam wouldn’t fix his blanket, thanks to being on guard their whole lives neither of them were heavy sleepers. Sam wouldn’t disturb the sleep he had worked so hard to get. He was about to move on when Sam saw it peeking out from under Dean’s pillow, the corner of an old trench coat, and his heart broke a little.
Comforting people in their last moments and helping them cross over was usually Castiel’s favourite part of his new duties. However, sometimes death was a messy loud business. Paul curls up in a ball on the floor and starts muttering “no” over and over again. Which was at least quieter. The scene in front of them has settled down. The attendant had placed a cheap plastic table cloth over Paul’s body, and is now comforting their rescuer, who is also sitting on the floor, while telling their story to the 9-1-1 operator. Castiel was impressed.
Dean is sitting in a chair in the living room. The house is dark besides the side table lamp that’s illuminating the spot where Dean sits. In his hands are two pictures. One the drawing Mary drew, the other a faded picture of Castiel in a cowboy hat. Worn from years of living in Dean’s wallet. That might have been the best damn day of Dean’s life and he should have...well he should have done a lot of things. Headlights illuminate the living room. Dean wipes his face and looks at Mary passed out on top of Miracle underneath the Christmas tree, with a second candy cane still grasped in her fist. It’s too late to move her to her room and he probably hadn’t done a great job of cleaning up the kitchen. He can hear Sam and Eileen trying to be quiet as they enter the house. They are smiling as they walk in the living room.
Gabriel looks back at Meg. “Just remember he’s not the only angel around here with their heart on their sleeve.”
Later that night Dean sits at Sam’s dinner table. Pizza boxes and paper plates are piled up on the counter behind him. There is also a plate of carrot sticks that does appear to have a few sticks missing. Miracle lies on the kitchen floor chewing on pizza crusts. Mary sits beside Dean, colouring a picture. Lily is passed out on Dean’s left shoulder. He rocks back and forth slightly while studying the cards in his right hand. Two pair, aces over fives. He looks up at Doug. Doug’s eyebrow twitches. Dean smiles.
Dean scoffs. “It’s just a feeling. Trust your gut kid, you’ll get there.” Dean winks at Dalbir, and Dalbir’s cheeks darken.
“I know, this is strictly recon, and between you and me I doubt it’s anything. Ever since we took care of his little ghost problem he’s called us for all sorts of things. Last strange noise was his furnace giving out. I think he’s just lonely.”
He quickly climbs the stairs to the second floor. He lays Lily down in her crib. She stirs for a moment before settling back down. He watches her sleep and waits for his heart to slow down. Dean doesn’t understand why he’s reacting this way. It’s been years, and missing Cas is just second nature at this point. He just had never heard Mary talk about him before and was caught off guard that’s all. There’s a soft noise behind him and Dean turns around to see Mary hovering in the doorway.
Back in the bunker a figure appears at Jack’s side. It’s form flickers. There is a man in a Santa suit, a small child, an old woman, a young pale woman with dark hair and dark eyeliner. Finally its form settles into that of an older gentleman with sharp features. He is wearing a meticulously tailored dark suit, and there is a silver ring on his right hand.
Dean approaches slowly. The man has his back to him and appears to be studying his hands. Turning them over and examining them, as if they were new. The wind has stilled and the night is quiet once more. The only sounds Dean can hear are the engine of the Impala and the beating of his own heart. Dean stops a few feet away from the man, barely daring to hope. As if sensing him the man turns and blue eyes meet green.
“Hey Dean, don’t worry about…” but whatever Sam is going to say dies as he sees the look on his brother's face.
“I’m not lecturing.” Dean glances down at the wide eyed four year old hanging off of his knee, “am I lecturing?”
In Paul’s peripheral vision he can make out a large figure in a trucker hat holding a shotgun. In the split second it takes to assess the situation, Paul makes a choice. He pulls back the hammer of his pistol.
Claire shoves Sam out of the way and punches Castiel in the shoulder. Cas smiles at her and opens his arms.
“So how goes the battle?” Doug asks. “Mine was very successful. Sheets balanced. All my numbers in a row, not a single soldier lost.”
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone! Writing this has been a little light in the darkness of a rough season for me, and I hope it's brought you all a little light as well. Thank you for reading!
Sam throws up his hands in frustration. Eileen appears at her husband’s side. She runs a soothing hand down his arm and kisses her daughter.
Paul pulls his ski mask down and pushes through the door. He flinches as the bells over the door chime, announcing his presence. The teenager at the counter glances up from their phone and sighs. Paul can barely see their face through the curtain of long dark hair that falls across their face, but he is pretty sure they look annoyed. Paul throws his black duffle bag onto the counter. It faintly smells like old gym socks, even though he had let it air out for a week.
Dean Winchester’s arms are getting tired. He can feel the sweat dripping down his neck, and he really wishes they would turn off that damn Mariah Carey song. Even if it is helping him keep his compressions in time. Dean is crouched down in fake snow, surrounded by plastic reindeer, and Santa Claus himself is lying flat on his back in front of him having suffered a cardiac arrest on the last Saturday before Christmas.
“Well how was I supposed to know that?” Dean tickles the baby’s feet. “Huh, Lily. I’m not psychic.” Lily kicks her feet and gurgles happily.
Paul follows his gaze and sees himself lying face down in a pool of blood. There’s a hole where his heart used to be. Paul starts to scream.
“Maybe we should stop and get him out of here.” Whispers Dalbir, the EMT they were training. Kid was having one hell of a first day.
Sam hears movement on the stairs and looks to see Dean coming down. Dean grins as he sees his brother.
Dean only grunts in response. He knows the wound looks worse than it actually is. It’s the what ifs that bother him. Claire has grown up a lot but she could still be reckless. She reminds him too damn much of himself.
“Dean be nice it’s Christmas!” cries Doug, who has been a victim of Dean’s pool shark ways in the past. Dean just grins, grabs his beer, and heads over to the pool tables.
“People don’t like being eaten by dinosaurs.” Castiel says pointing at Paul who is now cowering behind the couch.
“Mistletoe is a very important Christmas thing,” Mary says seriously, “if you find some he’ll have to kiss you.”
“No.” Castiel answers. “This is Paul Miller. 34 years old. A liar, a gambler, and a would be thief. He’s failed at every endeavour he’s ever tried and died trying to hold up a gas station. The register contained one hundred and seventeen dollars, and eighty seven cents."
“That’s nice babe. We,” she says taking a dramatic pause and gesturing to the table, “saved Christmas.”
He cranes his neck trying to see past Dean. The person behind Dean comes into view. Sam walks towards the entrance, pushing past his brother.
The elves are keeping the crowd at bay but Dean can hear children crying, and the murmurs of parents trying to reassure them that Santa isn’t dying. Dean feels a crack and is pretty sure he has just broken one of Santa’s ribs. He hopes the kids didn’t hear that.
Dean shifts Mary onto his left hip and pulls Claire into a side hug. “Day, night, about anything, okay. That goes for both of you. You need me, I'm there.”
Claire puts on a jacket covering her ruined shirt. Mary is on her tiptoes at the sink watching her uncle meticulously scrub his hands. After he finishes she holds her hands up for the soap, Dean has to pick her up so she can reach the water.
Cas looks up at him with a small smile on his face. “I guess we’re still just a couple of dumbasses.”
Meg throws back her head and lets out a bark of laughter. “God no. I’m here to watch over people like until you’re ready to move onto a more permanent place of residence.”
Dean gets up and kisses her on the top of the head. “I know. I love you too partner. In a completely platonic closed off kind of way. You too Doug.” He kisses Doug on the top of his head too.
Sarah looks up as a wave of fresh air reaches them. Dean looks up too and sees a man in a trench coat coming in the door. His heart stops for a second before he recognizes Doug, Sarah’s husband. Doug rushes over to their table giving Sarah a quick kiss before sitting down. She leans against him. Their intimacy is quiet and comfortable. If Dean feels a small tug in his stomach he ignores it and takes a drink of his beer.
“Good. Now even though I’m a grown ass woman,  I’m going to go assure all my other parental figures that I’m fine.” Claire pauses at the doorway before leaving. “Thanks for the patch up.” She’s gone before he can respond.
Paul Miller paces outside the gas station. His hand is gripping the gun in his pocket. The cool steel gives him courage. He doesn’t know why he’s hesitating. Oil companies were ravaging the planet and this station was just one in a large chain. It was really the most ethical robbery he could think of, besides a bank, and banks are way too high stakes. Paul just needs a few hundred dollars to keep his bookies at bay. A little time to get a real plan together. He just wasn’t expecting the person behind the counter to be so young. Who puts a teenager on the graveyard shift, all by themselves in the middle of nowhere? This place really had it coming. Paul gathers his courage. He has a plan. Wave the gun around a little, grab the money and get out. Everything would be fine. Maybe the counter kid would even get some paid time off for their trouble. Nobody would get hurt, everybody would get paid. Really it was a victimless crime.
"That would most likely be the case if your pupils had increased in size when you viewed the photos of women, but your pupils maintained stability in size."  Rachel replied.
"Well, technically, it's just modeled to look similar to the bunker. Everything that was in the old bunker was moved here to furnish the bar bunker instead, you know, cause it doesn't cost us anything."
"Dean... What happened? Are you.." Before Castiel could finish that phrase, a bright light appeared in front of the two men. When the light faded, a figure was standing in its place.
Castiel rolled his eyes playfully. "But Dean, there is something I need to tell you first. After the game is over, I have to-" Castiel started to say. He needed to tell Dean that he would have to stay in the cave after the game was finished. He couldn't leave since Chamuel refused to let the Empty kill him. But Dean stopped him before he could tell the hunter about the deal.
The line was silent for a moment as Sam took a deep breath. He was still trying to process his own grief and the depth of the words he just said. Rowena seemed to understand Sam's pause and remained silent, waiting for him to continue.
"It doesn't?" Cas asked, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion. He thought for sure Dean would have some sort of preference on the matter.
Dean turned around to see none other than Castiel. He was carrying a bouquet of flowers and dressed in normal business casual clothing, which was anything but normal for him.
"But... But why would... why would my name... why would I be included in the title of your memoir?" Cas asked, his eyes still comically wide.
"Dean, I think... I think I should be the one to lose this game... you already despise the spell that got put on you. I can take a hit this time around." Castiel said while fidgeting in his stance.
However, getting up was not an easy task. His entire body ached, and since he couldn't see himself or remember anything that had happened to him, the hunter had no idea what type of injuries he had acquired.  Worst of all though, he had no idea what exactly he was up against.
The scene froze as soon as Castiel was done with it. Apparently, the angel had only recalled the good parts of the memory because Dean knew that right after this particular moment, he went into his protective older brother mode to save Sammy.
The room was silent as Dean stared a hole into the side of Castiel's head. Even Chamuel was silent, but maybe she had already left to torture some other people who were suffering through her program. If there even was anyone else in her program. The archangel was just as annoying as she was mysterious.
"I wish I were brother, but she, just like so many of others, died after being forced out of heaven."
"But... Uh, isn't there some rule about, you know... not sleeping with the groom before the wedding?" Dean asked, trying to take any out he could get in this situation.
Dean seemed to lighten up at the mere sight of home. "Now this memory, I can definitely get behind!" He said with a smirk on his face as he looked around the room, retaking in all the tiny details. He missed his home, and he even missed his jerk of a brother despite him getting Dean into this mess.
"Haha, okay, I get the picture... I am usually more forward than this. I'm sorry I-I have a lot going through my mind. But if... if you wanna do-"
Dean turned his head so that his face was in his pillow. He then spoke his answer, but it came out as nothing but mumbles with the pillow blocking out his words. Aha, loophole. Good, this is good!
"Hopefully not too soon since Jack still needs to take a bath, and I promised to have that done before they got home tonight."
"Why would I..." Dean paused. Suddenly the entire puzzle started to come together. Sam was Chamuel's client, the one she had spoken to. Sam was the person who had enrolled him and Castiel into the program. It all made sense now.  "IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT? YOU ARE THE REASON I'M STUCK WITH CAS IN THIS HOBBIT HOLE!" Dean yelled.
"So what gives? You enjoyed us in your cave so much that you decided to keep us as pets or something? Because fair warning, I bite, and I'll pee over all the furniture in this hellhole."
Dean blinked multiple times and scrunched his face in an attempt to stop the tickling sensation that was now overcoming his expression.
"I see..." Castiel kicked a rock on the ground. "Well, if it's a game you want, then I say we both play to win, fairly. Whoever loses drinks the smoothie, and we call in a night."
"Well, in retrospect, I guess it's a good thing we aren't friends," O'Malley replied, ignoring the vast majority of Dean's statement. "I mean considering the fact that whoever chooses to befriend you doesn't have much of a life expectancy afterward. I am honestly shocked that Castiel made it this long."
"Yes, that's pretty much the summary of it. I did not find it enjoyable to be a second choice. " Cas muttered.
"It's fine, Kev. I can take care of it." Sam jumped in, trying to save the peace. "Come on, Jackie, let's go get you all nice and clean."
Castiel's hand soon followed his. "Wait, Dean, the script hinted that we may only have two attempts at opening the door."
Dean instantly regretted actually saying his snarky comment out loud. He instantly wished he had just kept his mouth shut because of the gloomy look it brought to Castiel's face which was currently heart-wrenching. The only comparison Dean could think of for how Cas currently looked was a puppy who had just been kicked repeatedly.
Dean stood motionless. Waiting in complete silence. After a few moments, the sound came back. This time it was a bit clearer. It sounded like a whisper or maybe a discussion happening farther away from where he was standing. But it was definitely a voice. Dean had absolutely no idea what the voice was saying, but he decided to take this experience one small victory at a time. The voice had sounded oddly familiar though, which of course, only compelled Dean to investigate it all the more.
"This is extremely peculiar," Cassie said, inspecting Dean like he was a bug under a magnifying glass.
"Jane…" Cassie muttered, staring at the young girl. "Why didn't you talk to us about this before you and Jack combined bunkers?"
He quickly closed the space between them. Meeting Castiels lips full of hunger and passion, which he didn't even know fully existed. Sparks flew the moment Dean felt Castiel's lips on his own.
Dean and Cas walked into the center room with strange energy flowing between them. But considering that they both had just kissed each other for the first time, the odd tension between them could only be expected.
Castiel finally looked at Dean directly, his face becoming red with rage. "WHY??? BECAUSE I WAS THE SECOND CHOICE FOR AGAIN!" He exclaimed.
"Ummm... yes?... I believe I hit my head on the doorframe when you pulled me out here." Castiel replied, rubbing the side of his head.
"It probably does break some ethical standards, but if any ethics or morals applied here, do you really think we would be keeping you both held hostage here?" Rachel replied.
Dean almost started crying right then and there. But, instead, his eyes were filling with tears of joy, and he was overcome with emotion as the elevator doors opened.
Castiel paused briefly before responding. "She could... or she could have died in a hundred other more painful ways by now."
"What did they tell you about her?" Dean asked in a hushed voice, even though Chamuel could still obviously hear them. Castiel finally turned to look at Dean square on.
Dean continued walking forward until he and Castiel stood one foot apart. Then the hunter placed a comforting hand on Cas' shoulder like the angel had done for him so many times before. "I'm saying that grace or not, you will never be nothing... At least not to me! You could be an angel or human, an alien or werewolf, I honestly don't care! Because whatever you are or whatever you become, you will always still be you, and that's far from nothing in my book!"
"Sure, be my guest!" Dean rolled his eyes as Castiel tried to lift the cards and could not pick any up.
But seriously, Dean couldn't get over how dumb the last two questions had been. Like why the hell did he need to know that Castiel's favorite color was green? And why did he have to tell Cas about his first kiss? It seemed pointless. They weren't here to entertain anyone, especially not Chamuel's weird-ass fantasies or whatever it was that she had planned for them.
This time Cas was the one to take a step back. Dean's change in tone was so sudden and drastic that he couldn't help but step away. Even his wings perked up a bit from the shock of the hunter's behavior.
Cas stared at Dean in amazement. The angel's eyes practically glistening with tears. The fact that Dean could even attempt to understand Castiel's fondness of meeting Jack, especially after he had killed Mary, was astounding. Dean looked back at Cas with understatement!
"Uhuh sure, you weren't handsome. Keep telling yourself whatever helps you sleep at night." Naya interjected. "Now, let's get on with it, you two. The rules are simple. Have either of you played Twister before?"
"Well, just amuse me and finish answering the question. Why was the 4th of July when you were kids the best day of your life?" The angel leaned forward a bit, hinting that he was inquisitive about the question.
"Pfft, yeah, well, you could have fooled me considering that in this room I am forced to tell the truth and nothing but the truth but so help me, god, I apparently am not the only one who needed the honesty kick. Now am I Cas?"  Dean glared.
Cas looked back down at him with a dazed expression. Like he was in a state of bliss or on a pill of ecstasy or something.
"And I thought I couldn't hate this place anymore, but it just keeps proving me wrong!" Dean exclaimed.
"Deano, take a deep breath and hear the women out! She does this entire program for free. The least you can do is listen." Gabriel said.
Both Dean and Cas starred at the frozen scene in front of them. Because out of all their wins, this one, in particular, didn't really have a direct downside to it. At least not right away.
He stepped towards the door and slowly turned the handle. The door opened easily, but before Cas could get a good look at what was inside, a hand grabbed his arm and pulled him in.
"Uhuh yeah, and what may that be exactly? Because I honestly have no clue as to what's going on here!" Dean irritadely exclaimed towards the ceiling, his eyes scanning across it still trying to find the source of the sound so he could make it shut up somehow.
But before he could even gather himself enough to survey Sam's room properly, a knife was pressed up against the side of his neck.
"So... is that why I saw the shadow of your wings back at that abandoned shack when we first met?" Dean asked.
Dean stroked a hand through the hair on of Castiel's head. "Hey... Hey, why the waterworks?" He asked, smiling fondly at the angel in his arms and using his thumb to wiping away Cas' tears.
"Yeah, I mean, having one Sammy around is already one too many if you ask me. So why bring in another?" Dean added.
"Great question. Honestly, I have no clue what is going on here, so I am pretty much useless in the seating arrangement department, but if you would like a witty remark, I am happy to oblige." Dean grinned.
Dean froze with his mouth wide open. Of course, he knew what 7 minutes in heaven was. He had played the game hundreds of times in high school. He just never thought the game would be part of a life or death situation before.
"You've got to be fucking with me..." He finally uttered. Dean already had issues talking about his emotions, so revealing his 7 worst memories was one of the last things he would ever want to do. He would rather be stuck in a room with Gabriel for the rest of his life, and that's saying a whole damn lot.
Later that night, Dean started to feel even more excited for his reunion with so many family members that he had lost in his own universe. Feeling excited was not an unknown feeling for Dean, but it was definitely rare, so he wanted to savor it.
Directly underneath the chandelier was a square coffee table with two chairs sitting on opposing sides of it to face one another. The chairs looked comfy, and to be honesty, Dean kind of needed a nap even to begin processing what was going on here. However, before he could put that idea into action, a female voice echoed through the room.
"I'm a talker. It's what I do, plus you kind of owe me since you practically denied to sleep with me, and I don't get rejected often."
"Well, why don't we just go ask the kid!" Dean exclaimed as he stepped forward and reached out to push the door open. "JACK!" Dean yelled as he made his way into the dark room, followed by the other five.
"No ... not exactly." Castiel was looking towards the opposite wall of the room. A large rock slab was definitely moving, but it was moving in the wrong direction for it to be a cave-in.
At first, he thought maybe the game was over, maybe this was Chamuel setting him and Castiel free at last, but he knew deep down that that was too good to be true.
When a knock echoed on the solid metal door of the bunker, Dean didn't hesitate to get up. He picked up the angel blade to give to Jody and made his way up the stairs.
"It's nothing, Dean!" Castiel replied without turning around. He took a deep breath before slightly glancing over his shoulder and reaching for the door handle.  "Let's just go complete this final round of questions so that you can leave just like you have wanted since we first arrived in this cave."
"Dean, you have been to heaven, to hell, and to purgatory, but you will never see where angels and demons go when they die." He stated, clear of any emotions in his tone.
This caused a panel in the center of the floor to slide automatically out of the way to reveal a hidden staircase.
After Chamuel gave him this ultimatum, she told him he had until the start of their next round tomorrow to make his choice. If he didn't pick one, Chamuel wouldn't let him or Dean leave the cave because, according to her, until Cas made his decision, round 5 would not commence. Of course, she couldn't stop the program once it started, but she can definitely delay parts of it. And she knew that the one thing that would motivate Cas into making a decision was the fact that Dean would be stuck in this cave until he did.
She smiled as if she had just won a big trophy and Castiel stared down at his shoes on the verge of tears.
Dean looked away from the angel as well but only for a split second to get his bearings. When he looked back, Castiel's face was flushed, and his shoulders were slouched. He looked emotionally defeated, if that was possible.
"No, Rowena, you misunderstand me." Sam interrupted. " I don't want to use magic to alter Dean's emotional state. I want Dean to be Dean, and for that to stay true...Dean has to feel how he feels."
"There's the man of the hour! How does it feel to know you will be hitched by this time tomorrow?" Fake Chuck asked.
A/N Part 2: "The Yellow Daffodil represents new beginnings. It is also referred to as a lucky symbol of future success. If you’d like to wish someone good luck, this is an ideal gift to give."
"Yeah, but you didn't need to sleep back then, and as you can see, there is only one freaking bed in this room. But there are two of us! It's fine, whatever. I will just sleep on the floor."
The moment he shut the door, the hotel hallway around him dissolved, and he was back in room 5 of Chamuel's cave.
Dean let a nervous chuckle. "You Ummm, well you talk in your sleep, man! It started as a few mumbles here and there. Eventually, your mumbles turned into screaming, and you started thrashing around like you were having a seizure or some shit. So I held you down to keep you from hurting yourself." Dean replied.
Dean took two steps back, causing Castiel to stop in walking forward. "Fine, you want me to fucking spell it out for you, Cas? I'll fucking spell it out for you! - You led me on. You told me you would come back in three months, but news flash, you didn't! It's been six months now! SIX MONTHS! DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT FUCKING MADE ME FEEL, CASTIEL? DO YOU?"
"7 minutes in heaven is a seven-minute game where two people get locked in a room alone together. Make sense?"
"You matter, Dean. Without you and your brother, all three of us wouldn't be standing here today. You boys saved us all in more ways than one." Jody said, placing a comforting hand on Dean's arm.
Dean probably should have been paying more attention to Castiel's wings before now. But in his own defense, Dean had almost forgotten about Cas' wings entirely during the past few cards. They must've been folded up behind the angel's back until now, so it was like they weren't even there.
"Well, three things come to mind, but I don't know which one I technically dislike the most out of the three."
"Uhhh... How so exactly?" Dean said as he felt his heart rate speed up. Did Castiel know that he wasn't his Dean? Could he tell somehow?
The crowd was silent for a moment. Just all looking around, wondering who would follow that speech by saying something. Of course, the person to first speak was Jared.
"Well,... umm... thank you... I guess. But like, what did you think about me after first speaking to me? Put aside my sparkling soul or whatever."
The hunter was tempted to yell out and see if Cas, Jack, or Sam were up and about, but he decided not to risk giving away his location just in case there was actually a threat lurking around somewhere in the bunker.
Cassie walked over to where Dean was still sitting on the bed. She leaned far too much into his personal space, but she was hot, so Dean would let it slid this time.
Dean was shocked. He had, of course, seen Castiel mad before, but this type of anger was different. It wasn't like when Castiel had beaten Dean up out of rage in the past. No, this anger was one of hopelessness. Dean could see it in the man's eyes.
"Well, it wasn't like I had much of a choice in the matter, but yes, I guess you could put it that way." Dean sighed, already dreading where this entire conversation seemed to be heading.
He and Cas were only a few cards away from freedom. Freedom from complete honesty. Freedom from these cold stone walls. Freedom from Chamuel and Gabriel and all the other minions that run the show. Freedom from all of these seemingly pointless questions. It was so close now that Dean was itching to conclude this chapter of his life. He was especially looking forward to getting back onto the open road with Baby and a mixtape of his top tracks.
Sam had no idea how to help his brother this time, especially considering his last attempt to help Dean ended up making everything so much worse. What Sam did know, however, was that whatever he did to help Dean this time, he couldn't go about it alone. He needed help. But from who? The majority of people the Winchester brothers cared about had been dead for years now. Friends weren't exactly easy to keep when working in this line of business. Nonetheless, Sam was able to think of a few breathing people who may help him out.
"Oh, don't worry, honey, this spell wears off after you complete round three." Naya walked over to Dean and whispered in his ear, "Word of advice: if you care at all about Castiel, you will find a way to lose this game. Trust me. You don't want him to drink this."
When they part, Gabriel nodded his head at his brother and then looked at Dean. "Well, that's my cue, Chow Fellas, see ya in my next lifetime."
"I only meant that Jensen wasn't you, Dean."  Castiel looked down at his feet while he admitted this, rubbing his upper arm nervously as if he was a child confessing to stealing a cookie from the cookie jar. It was an oddly human reaction for the celestial being, but endearing, to say the least.
"Lay with you? Like what- on a picnic blanket underneath the stars or some shit?" Dean asked obliviously.
Sleeping with Cas would definitively ruin him for anyone else, but Dean wanted to make that leap. He was more than ready to have Castiel ruin him in any way the ex-angel saw fit to do so.
"Then let's just move forward." Castiel followed the hunter's previous mannerisms and picked up the next card, reading it aloud before Dean had a chance to speak again. - "Why do you hate telling others the truth?"
Dean smirked. "Bitch... or would it be bitches since there are two of you now? Either way, you know what I mean!"
Gabriel took the sucker out of his mouth with a pop sound. "You passed the test Deano. I would say I am proud, but that's not my style. How about a hearty high five?" Gabriel lifted his hand, but Dean didn't move, so he slowly gave himself a high five. "Suit yourself, kiddo."
"You know... a door - the piece of a building that provides both blockage and an entryway to a home or other artificial structure that human seems to build for shelter and..."
"Well, typically, Jack is very social. He loves to talk about anything, learn about everything and ask us questions about the rest. However, during the past few weeks, Jack's been spending much more time within the confines of his bedroom!" Castiel answered.
"The point is, we're all here for you, and as long as we're still kicking it, we will continue being there for you whether your stubborn ass wants our help or not. No matter what the issue is, we will all get through it... together. Got it?" Jody asked him.
If Dean weren't worrying for his safety, he would have definitely tried to tap that. Instead, he stood there observing the women, more or less waiting for her to strike or say something more, hopefully explaining why they were there.
"You are going to have to give me a bit more context here, bud. I have no clue what you are going on about right now!"
Late one night, Dean was alone in the bunker. Sam had gone to help Donna with a vamps nest in her neck of the woods and told Dean to sit this one out. Plus, Jody was supposed to stop by the bunker sometime in the next two days to pick up some hunting supplies. Apparently, Claire had snatched the angel blade that Sam and Dean had given Jody and booked it across state lines for a solo hunt. So, Jody wanted to have another one on hand just to stay on the safe side.
Dean smiled back at his brother before continuing to hum as he made his way around the kitchen and finishing whipping up their breakfast.
"Oh, that's so not fair!" Dean said. He glared at Sammy while his brother looked back with his big wide hazel eyes and pouted lip. "Ok ok fine, whatever, you win. The girls can have our rooms until we can get them back to their own world. I'll be a gentleman, but I damn sure won't be happy about it."
"You know, that won't work on me anymore since I'm no longer an angel. However, I guess a stab wound from it could still cause significant damage."
"What the hell are you doing, Cas? The point of Twister is to be the last one standing, not to fondle your opponent ." Dean stated, looking over his shoulder at Cas.
Dean wiped a hand across his face, mentally checking it for stubble to see if he needed to shave before Cas arrived. "I - uhhhh... I kinda deleted the date setting from my phone, so I haven't been keeping track." He admitted.
"Oh shut up, it's just humid up here, that's all." Jensen stated, standing up. "I am going to get another drink." He stated before walking off to the bar.
One door clearly had Castiel written on it in gold and silver lettering. The other said Dean, but the writing was green and blue.
Dean turned around swiftly to see a young woman dressed in a typical hotel-type uniform, with a nametag on that said "Sarah" on it. She was cute but far too young for Dean to be sure that he could legally flirt with her.
"My apologies Dean!" Castiel said as he was about to lift himself from Dean's chest, but he stopped when he heard laughing. Castiel shifted his position so that he was face to face with Dean.
"Well, I guess it's not a hint anymore, now is it Cas? Just get to the point where you tell us what the hell is going on here!"
Maybe that wasn't the best way to start this conversation, but Dean couldn't think of a better segway, to begin with. Stupid stupid stupid! Dean thought to himself. It looks like you are becoming more socially inept than the angel you are trying to socialize with! And that's saying something... the voice in the back of Dean's mind told him. Ohhhhh would you just shut the hell up, I'm busy acting like a fool here, and I don't need your input.
Dean unlatched the door and swung it open, ready to give a few choice words to whoever stood on the other side.  Standing in the hallway was none other than Gabriel.
"You are walking a thin line, Winchester. I still wasn't done talking yet... As I was about to say,  when you were shown photos of women, you seemed to be more focused on their figures after you gave them the once over like you did every subject. But after analyzing their figures, your eyes would once again retreat to the corner of the monitor screen. There was no significant dilation in your pupils with either gender."
Dean walked into the room, grabbed a pillow and blanket from off the bed, and started getting situated on the floor. Laying down, he could hear the sound of the springs in the bed behind him and assumed that Cas was trying to get comfortable as well.
"Just answer the questions honestly and follow the prompts when they come up. If you do that, you will have nothing to worry about. Good luck, fellas." And just like that, the voice was gone.
Castiel's O-face was what pushed Dean to his own release. He shifted in pleasure underneath Cas, and once he was spent, Castiel lowered his body down on Dean's chest. He obviously didn't care about the mess they made.
so Dean being Dean, decided to ask his tell-all question of - - - "What the hell Cas???" He exclaimed into the previously silent room.
"Yeah - you told me you traded your life for his but that the Empty wouldn't come to collect its prize until you were actually happy. Which is a douche move for a cosmic entity to make, just saying!" Dean answered, running a hand through his hair.
Good! Now, as I said before I was rudely interrupted... round five is a bit longer than the previous four rounds. Also, unlike the other rounds, there will be two types of cards this time. The first is
"Woah, woah, woah... hold on!" Dean said as the scene faded away. "So Jensen was getting married the next day... to someone named Daniella or whatever her name ... and he tried to sleep with you the night before his own wedding?"
"Well, gee Cas... didn't know you hated the old ball and chain that much!" Dean tried to joke his way away from the painful rejection he felt inside.
"Ladies first!" Dean smirked at Cas before directing his gaze towards the deck of cards. However, the moment Dean returned his gaze to Castiel, he saw that the angel was not only staring back at him but currently giving him a sincerely menacing glare which was extremely ironic for any heavenly being.
Castiel looked down at the table between the two men while he recalled the events when he actually first met Dean. It wasn't the best first impression, but it was definitely memorable.
"Your appearance deceives you, Dean. You aren't just another pretty face. You're smarter than you look." Chamuel smirked.
"Why don't you both take a seat, and I can explain my program." She gestured to the sofa in the corner of the room.
"Cas?" Dean said, breaking the moment of silence that had fallen over them. "What is it? Why did you stop?"
"Well, I do assume that Castiel must remember me!" Theo stated, directing his gaze towards the other angel.
Both men knew that their brief conversation had drawn to a close. So they drifted off to sleep, terrified of what chaos tomorrow would spew onto them.
Well, if that's the case, maybe Jensen and Dean were more similar than Castiel had originally thought.
"You couldn't let me be hopeful, just this once could you?" Dean sent a glare across the table. The angel was right, but Dean didn't want to think about what the next question might ask him.
"Please, look at me, beautiful." Cas requested, situating his weight onto his elbow so that he could lift his other hand to turn Dean's face toward his. Dean looked up at him with glistening eyes. His pupils were so broad that it almost took over his green iris'. "Don't hide. It's just you and me right now." Cas said, leaning in slowly to kiss him.
Dean started clearing his throat, and now he really didn't like where this conversation was heading. "Well, no. With her... the mark made me drawn to her, like in a weird romantic sort of way."
"Yeah-sure and the boulders that almost crushed me earlier were made of paper mache." Dean replied sarcastically.
Sadly, what Dean said did just that. Castiel felt hopeless. Dean was the reason he rebelled against heaven. Dean was why he lost the only home he ever knew before meeting the Winchesters, and now all hope of resolution was gone.
"Good luck to both you boys." Chamuel stated, nodding again at them both before the sound of wings filled the air, and she was gone again.
Dean's eyes widened. Hadn't Castiel told him years ago that he rebelled against heaven for HIM? Was Dean the man Castiel was talking about being in love with? No... that couldn't be possible... could it? Could angels even fall in love? The majority of them were just dicks wearing monkey suits but Castiel... Cas had always been different.
There was something warm and comforting in that light, a presence that felt so familiar to him yet so distant. He didn't quite understand why though. At this point, Dean threw all previous caution into the wind. He had to know where the light source was coming from. He had to know whose voice he heard. The hunter broke into a sprint down the long cavern and turned down the corridor where the light source came from. After he turned, he entered into a long narrow stretch of the tunnel; it was barely wide enough for Dean to walk forward through without having to turn to the side a bit. He had broad shoulders; there was no point in denying it. One thing was clear though, at the dead-end of this narrow tunnel was the light source that Dean had been searching for.
The women let out an extremely annoyed sigh, " Fine if you must know; my name's Deanna Winchester. My sister Samantha and I live here with our pet angel and the daughter of the devil himself. So, if I were you, I would put the gun down and go running for the hills before any of them catch wind of you stepping onto our turf!" Deanna said, seeming to think she had the upper hand here.
Dean scoffed internally. He didn't care who Rudy claimed to be or what the voices in his head told him to do. He was going to do this his way like he always did.
Finally, Castiel spoke up, bringing Dean out of his daydream-like state. "You and Amara... You had a connection?"
Dean walked through his door in room number five and looked around to find himself in what seemed to be a hotel lobby. The door he came through shut behind him, and when he turned around to look at it, he saw that the door was labeled "maintenance."
As soon as he was situated, Castiel closed his book and reached over to turn off the light. But as soon as the light was off, Dean heard Castiel shuffle closer to him until he felt the other man's weight laying on his chest in the dark.
Castiel must've noticed his confused look because he patted the spot on the bed beside him and pulled back the covers for Dean.
Dean smiled fondly at his best friend. But he wouldn't dwell on the topic if it made Cas anxious. "I get it Cas, it was a shock for us all that I got to live and that my mom got brought back to life. It makes sense. It was one of the few times we actually won without a hell of a downside. Anyhow... Are you ready to show me the next one?" Dean asked.
Cas never came back to the bunker... meaning that Dean had sat at the table waiting for three whole days.
"...I'm not sure, they typically exist in a plane of existence parallel to this one; that way, they are with me but aren't seen by the naked eye. The only time humans tend to get a glimpse of them is when an angel is revealing his or herself in their true nature."
Dean forced himself to quickly walk out the door before he could second guess himself. However, the second he left the room, he tried to turn back around. Those stupid cards were unpredictable; who knows what they'll ask him next. Castiel had followed directly behind the hunter, thus blocking his pathway back to the door. Not that it would have mattered anyway. The moment Castiel crossed through the doorway, the door slammed shut behind him. The only way to leave this room now was to get through the questions.
“I enjoy helping people, some more than others.” Meg laughs as Castiel continues. “Checking in on humanity, bringing people home. It brings me solace.”
“Not yet. He’s still here.” Dean insists. He can feel the man’s life hanging in the balance and knows there’s still a chance. Another crack reverberates up his arms.  “Come on!” Dean yells
The woman who once was a demon and was now something else sat beside the angel who was also Death (the last in a line of many titles). They both had jobs to do but they sat together until the last bits of colour left the sky and the stars came out. There was time for a break. After all, it only lasted a moment.
“No dinosaurs got it.” Gabriel walks over to Paul, pulls him up, and wraps an arm around him. “Come on let's get you settled. We can have a drink and you can tell me all about your likes and dislikes and I’ll figure out how to help you become the best you you can be.”
Dean tentatively touches the lapel of Cas’s trench coat. He rubs the fabric between his finger and thumb.
“Got hit with the motherly guilt trip huh? Nice. Well she’s got nothing to worry about now.” Dean says and winks at Cas.
Dean pulls Cas’s face to his. It’s a kiss that he has been waiting for for five years, almost twenty years, hell all of existence has been building up to this one kiss. Dean feels like he’s being torn apart and put together at the same time. Every feeling he has ever denied himself surges forward. It is overwhelming. It is almost too much, but Cas is there holding onto him, kissing him back. Instead of drowning Dean is flying. He is safe. He is home.
Mary runs to the living room and comes back with two candy canes. One for Doug, and one for her. Dean gives her a look.
“Go.” At Sarah’s order Dean continues chest compressions until she yells clear again. Another shock, but this time his vitals stabilize. “We got him!” Sarah says.
“We got V-Tach, clear!” Sarah yells. Dean throws his hands up, and Sarah hits a button that sends a shock of electricity to Santa’s heart causing his body to leap up. A child screams.
“I’m just saying you could have everything you already have and more, if that is even something you want. You know I’m just saying this out of love and completely support you right?” Sarah asks, looking worried.
Sam stays where he is, not taking his eyes off of the library entrance. Claire enters holding hands with her girlfriend Kaia. She looks at Sam standing tensely.
“No,” Dean shakes his head and stares at his beer, “no, I haven’t figured out a way to do it that’s not just begging him to come back.”
“I didn’t,” Sam pauses, “I don’t know how to talk to you about him. Every time I try you change the subject or leave the room, and it always looks like I punched you in the gut.”
“You know you are. You’re like a fortress surrounded by a moat filled with alligators.” Sarah says matter of factly.
It’s slow going in the snow but Dean doesn’t mind. After a 12 hour shift and then rushing to get ready for dinner he was grateful for a moment of peace. Just him and his car, and Mariah Carey for company. When he saw the tape of
Why did he have to add in that last few sentences? It wasn't necessary to answer the question, but his mouth wouldn't stop moving. This was just great, whatever magic had been in the pill that Dean had taken it seemed to be proactive enough to already find a solution to his only loophole. Well the only loophole besides mumbling into the pillow, but even he knew it would be stupid for him to just carry around the pillow all the time.
It’s Monday afternoon and the bunker is filled with activity. No longer the quiet refuge of the Winchester clan, it is now the home base for any hunter who needs it. There are hunters in every room, researching, eating, grabbing supplies, and sleeping. The place is decorated head to toe with a mishmash of holiday decor brought in by all the people who now consider this their home too. Even the infirmary is filled with Christmas lights, and there is a tree in the corner tipsily leaning to it’s left side. The amount of bulbs and tinsel on the tree invoke a feeling of overindulgence. Dean Winchester sits in front of the tree, frowning, as he stitches up Claire Novak’s upper arm.
Maybe Mary got her puppy eyes from her mother after all. Oh well at least he had grabbed a nap earlier.
There is clapping as they wheel Santa through the mall, and Mariah hits her last high note. It really hadn’t taken that long after all.
Meg interrupts him with a playful smack on the arm. “I know that Clarence. I’m just teasing you. I mean how’s a girl supposed to compete with a love that rewrote the entire universe.”
Meg rolls her eyes at Castiel’s words. Paul looks up and his face contorts in horror. He lets out a blood curdling scream.
Sarah yawns, Doug looks suddenly very interested in his candy cane, and Dalbir looks down at his hands.
“It’s hard Sammy. I think I’m doing okay, and maybe I am. Maybe I’m not. I don’t know. It’s just hard. You got Eileen back and I am happy for you, don’t think I’m not. I’m so grateful to have her in our lives, to be a part of the family you both have made, it’s just…”
“See ten years tops. Don’t know why everyone had their panties in a twist.” Dean lightly kicks Sam under the table. “Thanks Sammy.”
“I’m just busy. I’ve got the job, our poker nights, lots of family obligations. Do you want to see more pictures of the nieces, because I have a lot of new ones. I have a very full life.” Dean states pointing his beer at Sarah.
“Oh Winchester always knows.” Sarah answers. “That can’t be taught. It’s like he sees their soul leave their body.”
Castiel opens his mouth but before he can say anything Gabriel puts his hands up in surrender. “Listen, you put her in charge of looking after the souls in this inbetween place, but you put me in charge of helping them level up. Now I know my ways are unconventional but you always knew that about me, and we’ve had good results, haven’t we Meg?”
He rests his head on the steering wheel trying to stop the memories from coming. Even a simple recon mission could go wrong if his head is somewhere else. Dean closes his eyes  and tries to clear his head, but all he sees is Cas. Cas walking towards him, sparks literally flying. How had Dean not known how screwed he was? He had never admitted it, but he had been terrified that night. Scared of something that could walk past every ward he and Bobby knew and survive Ruby’s knife sure, but terrified of this celestial being who seemed to know him, who could see right through him.
“Hey, hey relax. He likes you. Don’t overthink it. Hold his hand, tell him he looks nice. You’ll be fine. He probably thinks it’s adorable that you asked him out for coffee.” says Dean.
Mary squeals and throws her arms around Dean’s leg. Crushing some of the crumbs and slobber into his pants. Sam stands up and hands over Lillian. He takes his car keys and slips them into Dean’s pockets removing the keys to the impala. Dean is fine with babysitting, he’s done it many times before, but he assumed he’d be able to stop at his apartment and grab a shower first. Claire hadn’t been the only person he patched up since arriving at the bunker late last night.
Claire leads Cas into the library, where everybody gets their turn to welcome him back. Sam feels a tug on his hand and looks down to see his daughter Mary staring at him with wide eyes. He picks her up.
Dean takes a deep breath. He could do that right? Say hello and tell him how he’s doing. It was Christmas after all, the perfect time to reach out to old friends. Yes he desperately, selfishly, wants Cas here, but if there was one thing Dean Winchester is good at it’s burying his true feelings deep down. Dean wipes his eyes and takes a few steadying breaths. He brings his hands together and closes his eyes.
“No! Not the Juggalo vampire dream again! I’ve heard it too many times. The rusty nail and Sam’s dumb wig. It wasn’t like that. I’m fine.”
The barn doors blow open with a loud crash. Dean startles and opens his eyes. The peaceful evening has been transformed. An angry wind has picked up. Snow is swirling, the trees are swaying and the barn looks like it is under attack. The shutters are banging against the sides, and shingles are being torn free from the roof. A streak of lightning cuts through the sky and hits the barn, followed by a loud boom of thunder. Before Dean can think about what he’s doing, he is out of Impala and running towards the barn’s entrance. He slips a few times in the snow but he stays on his feet. As Dean approaches the open barn doors he realizes that he left the car running and that he doesn’t have a weapon on him. However, he doesn’t turn back. Because in the middle of the barn Dean can make out the silhouette of a man. The silhouette of a man wearing a long trench coat.
Castiel sits beside Meg. The couch is warm and comfortable. It perfectly forms around him, like he’s been sitting in it every day of his life. Which for him is a very long time. Once he is settled, the couch rearranges itself so that the pair are now facing the waterfall. They sit in comfortable silence for a while. The sun begins to set.
Sam kneels down, “good news sweetie, Uncle Dean is going to take you home, clean you up and spend all night with you.”
“Uncle Dean?” Mary asks sweetly while looking up at him with a pleading puppy dog expression that she inherited from her father. “Can I have your fortune cookie?”
in the window of a local thrift store he knew it was fate, and really it kinda rocks. He unabashedly sings along to every song.
“I’ll still be here when you wake up. Tomorrow morning, and every morning after that,” Cas assures him.
Dean is heading out for dinner when receives a call from Jody asking him to check in on the O'Leary farm. Mr. O'Leary claims there are strange sounds coming from his barn, but what could be waiting for Dean Winchester in an old barn on Christmas Eve...
It is the night before Christmas, or very early Christmas morning depending on your perspective. The bunker is dark, not a soul is stirring. Not a soul except for a former hunter and a former angel who are holding each other close swaying slowly to the Christmas music playing quietly. The only light comes from the Christmas tree in the corner, bathing the pair in a multi-coloured glow. The sleeves of Castiel’s shirt are rolled up to his elbows, his tie is loose, and his coat is draped over a nearby chair. In all of his very long life he has never felt more at peace. He wishes this night could go on forever, but he knows that the man in his arms has had a very long day.
All the air leaves Dean’s lungs in a rush. He gets down on one knee in front of his niece who is looking up at him with sadness and a bit of fear. It’s a look he recognizes. A look that says something is broken and it must be my fault.
“Well I’m not mad, I promise.” Dean crosses his heart with his hand. “Sometimes when you miss someone a whole lot it can hurt to talk about them, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. I want you to know all about your Uncle Cas okay? You ask me about him whenever you want. My stories are way better than your dad’s.”
Cas turns back to the depths of his glass, but it’s empty again, so he gestures to the bartender for a refill. “We’re not 'dating’,” he clarifies. “We have an arrangement of mutual benefit that does not extend to outside the bedroom.” The bartender is taking an irritatingly long time. Cas taps his fingers on the bar top, decidedly ignoring the mix of male and female giggling that comes from near the pool table. “Dean can do whatever he wants.”
And the thing is, Dean believed him. He couldn’t get it into his head that Cas would be anything other than gentle in bed. Slow and soft in all the right ways. Most times that thought was enough to get little Dean going.
“Don't worry, Dean, we got him covered!” promises Donna, and as if on silent command, everyone draws their daggers, guns, flamethrowers, and in Rowena's case, just wiggles with her hand in a dramatic show of purple sparks.
“Ow!” Dean complains, rubbing at his arm. From his limited perspective, Cas can’t quite tell, but he’d wager that’s a hint of red spreading across Dean’s neck and cheeks. “Geez, woman! This won’t work, remember? I’m Cas’ demise, not his salvation, did you catch on to anything we said? That’s why I called everyone here, remember?”
So he decided to come clean. “No, of course not.” He tilted his head back to stare at that boring spot on the ceiling again. “A… transferral is not necessary, the pain can be extinguished out of existence,” he said, voice almost a whisper. “It just makes me feel better.”
In order not to give the man any ideas, Castiel ignores him expertly. He clenches his jaw and stares at the wall opposite, which is white and unassuming, a reassuring opposite to Winchester’s brash personality.
Cas spreads out his hand on top of Dean's chest, right where his anti-possession tattoo lies. He doesn't take his eyes off Dean once. “I can forget it happened,” he suggests, voice lowered to a whisper. “You can tell me again, like I'm hearing it for the very first time. Once you're ready.”
“Last one for you,” warns the bartender, making Cas scowl at him reproachfully. “You’ve been drinking more in the last hour than our town drunk does on a whole day. Trust me, no more.”
His lips are rough and his hands are gripping him so tightly it’d be bruising on an average human being but when he parts Cas’ lips with his, it’s gentle and his nose is digging into Cas’ cheek in a way that’s almost desperate and all Cas can do is stand there, stockstill.
But Cas couldn’t remember what he’d asked. Just concentrated on the points of contact where their skin touched, the distressed back-and-forth rub of a thumb against his arm.
For a long second after the shot rings through the Bunker, everything is silent. Then everyone breaks out in a flurry of frenzied activity, scrambling to get to Cas. Dean stomps up the stairs, Alex and Patience pull out a first aid box, Garth lets out a litany of “I'm sorry, oh god, I'm sorry, oh god,” and Jody and Donna set out to secure the scene of accident.
“If you’re,” Dean says between breaths he begs to come more steadily. “If you’re asking about your performance, you’re not as smart as I thought you were.”
Claire and the Donna are waiting for them in front of the entrance, and they wave at them with their weapons. “Took you long enough,” Claire comments with a cheekiness that Dean often attributes to the impertinence of ‘this goddamn generation’.
And he doesn’t get any further than that. Because once his fingers touch the book’s spine, his whole body goes stiff, and he collapses onto the ground like a wooden plank.
Dean barks out a laugh which he tries to cover with a cough as to not get caught eavesdropping. “Look what's Sammy getting himself into,” he whispers to Cas who just smiles sincerely.
There must be a permanent grin plastered on Dean’s face, and he doesn’t even care how lunatic he probably looks right now. Shoving at Cas’ chest, he rolls the angel off of him and follows right after, laying his head down to rest right over Cas’ heart. It beats a steady rhythm against Dean’s ear, lulling him to sleep.
“I haven’t been touched there in a while,” Cas amends, and from anyone else this admission could’ve had huge flirty undertones, but coming from Cas? There’s no ulterior motive here at all, which all the more strongly sparks in Dean the wish to grab Cas and hold him in his arms. Which he does, because what’s holding him back?
Then, his mouth decides to translate the relieve at seeing Cas whole and well in his room into the petulant question,
“No monster activity as far as I can tell, but there's a warding that just blinked up in my system? My app hasn't notified me of any kind of supernatural warding in that area until now, so it might be worth looking into, since it seems to be, you know, getting weaker and all.” With a shudder, she adds, “Maybe it's holding some eldritch monster inside that's trying to escape after a thousand years of imprisonment. And it feeds on human flesh!”
He’d stand up and go to the corridor, but his ribs are still hurting even just trying to sit up and he can’t let that weakness slip towards his boss.
“Eileen,” Dean says, if for Castiel's sake or to comprehend the reality of the situation, Cas can't tell. “And... Sarah Blake?”
“No, the edge is off. I don’t want to anymore, you ruined it,” Cas complains. In the pettiest corner of his mind, he might even admit that he thinks it serves Dean right to suffer the same way he’s made Cas suffer all these times.
“No, no, wait, I asked Sammy to close that!” Winchester says, when he recognizes what this action of Castiel’s leads to. “I get chilly!”
Like right now, watching Dean flirt with the pretty lady with the long legs and sultry smirk. Cas knows she has long legs and a sultry smirk because that’s what caught Dean’s attention. She’s also blonde and approachable, with her hearty, infectious laughter and she’s basically everything Cas is not. Only natural that Dean feels drawn to her.
Ironically, it’s exactly what drunk Cas has in that drunk mind of his too, so he goes willingly where Dean pushes. Once they reach the bed, he suddenly flips them around so it’s Dean’s knees that hit the edge of the mattress. Cas follows, letting himself fall onto the hunter’s chest and stays there like Dean’s the world’s most comfortable human cushion.
“You know we could hear everything,” Rachel breaks the awkward silence and gestures to her ear. “Angel hearing.”
Dean clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. He nods, because yeah, angel wings come with a ton of creepy eyes apparently, and
But alas. The ground is still a supporting surface beneath his feet and Dean is still right in his face.
The lion’s tongue slips out to fondly lick a quick, sticky stripe across his neck. “A few more minutes,” Cas agrees.
Cas wakes up after ten hours of sleep he shouldn’t need, and squints into the dimmed lighting of the room. To the immense relief of one Dean Winchester, who’s been sitting beside the bed for every minute of those hours.
But Dean smirks at him unrepentant. “If the roles were reversed, there would be some other stuck-up office douche on this bench with me,” he says. Lifts a shoulder in consideration. “Probably be making out by now.”
So Castiel immersed in it as long as he could, not bothering to control the shaking of his limbs or the wetness in his eyes, and before he knew it, he found himself falling backwards.
“Dean, there is no 'curse'. I've died regardless of whether your penis has come anywhere near me, several times in fact!” he dares to remind Dean.
Cas shakes off this train of thoughts and decides to answer Sam instead. Which isn’t easier since he has not much of a clue what he’s talking about. “Why would I want you to 'kick’ his 'ass’?”
Dean had become quiet instantly, ready to withdraw. The moment of silence had stretched endlessly. That’s how it had felt at least, even though Cas knows it isn’t logically possible for time on Earth to move in any other way than linear, at least without supernatural interference – but awkwardness can apparently reshape entire concepts of physics.
None other than Crowley steps around the pile of hugging humans and into the metaphorical spotlight, running a hand over his chest and the impeccably tailored black suit covering it. “Excuse my impoliteness: Hello, boys.”
“We’re doing this, Sammy.” Rolling his eyes, Dean heaves the second duffel bag into the trunk, grunts dramatically at the unexpected weight. “The hell did you pack, whole ass bricks?”
“They’re fine.” The answer trickled out of him as though he was underwater. He pointed a finger into the vague direction where he thought the siblings were sitting, now upright again, gasping, and holding onto one another with renewed life.
Dean and Cas stop right in the doorframe, staring back at the group of angels who are taking a break in their endeavour to get royally drunk to shoot them expectant and judging looks respectively.
Feeling suddenly weary, worse than when he first woke up in the hospital bed, Cas returned his gaze. “You’re so very aware aren’t you.”
Cas mumbles something inaudible against Dean’s skin, hoping it won’t induce Dean to try and translate the nonsensical non-words with the help of a special dictionary. Maybe his collection includes this mysterious volume of
Dean and Cas turn just in time to see the soft smile she sends Sarah's way, who hasn't left Sam or Eileen's side for a minute. “I might have never met Sarah otherwise,” Eileen says, as she laces their fingers together. “For a civilian, she's surprisingly badass.”
Some people give themselves liquid courage, but a drunk Cas is apparently out to sell himself at less than fair value, Dean ponders. He’s gonna have to set that right. Tomorrow, he tells himself again, rubbing soft little circles into the back of Cas’ neck until he falls asleep.
Firstly, there’s the sense of safety that Cas manages to encompass him in with just the sound of his voice. Compare that to the complete madness that is waking up to the sight of a lion head on the pillow next to him like it belongs there, and Dean’s hunting instincts are at a loss about whether to shoot or protect, or let himself be protected.
“That good, huh,” she says knowingly. Then her gaze shifts to somewhere over his shoulder, settles on something that makes her smile meaningfully. “You know what’s good too?”
Once the door shuts behind him, Dean whips his head around to the other bed. “You’re the actual worst, you know that.”
Dean blinks at him again in confusion before letting out a growl of frustration. “You really can be a dumbass sometimes, you know that?” he says.
“Listen, uhm,” Dean starts, running a hand through his hair in a move that – can it be he’s nervous? “Can we, heh. Move this somewhere else?” He throws a pointed look around the room full of heavenly voyeurs.
“Crude,” someone beside him gives voice to Castiel’s thoughts. In contrast to Castiel, however, a shark-like grin is gracing Uriel’s face. “I like it.”
“Your own wha-,” Dean interrupted himself with a gasp that sounded punched out of him. “Your own pain?”
The words burst through the barricades that make up Cas’ willpower, his need to share them stronger and more coercive than any of his age-old restraint.
In his periphery, Cas notes an eyebrow shooting up in Dean’s face. “Fighting or fucking?” he asks and Cas nearly chokes on his piece of burger.
“Don't ask me why. I don't think anyone actually understood his motives. He must've been obsessed with you two though, that's for sure,” comments Alicia.
His thrusts have pinpoint precision, his kisses along Cas’ neck are blissful torture, and the interplay of all these sublime sensations almost make Castiel forget why he is keeping his lips pressed closed, why he is trying to muffle his own groans.
Once he’s reached the other side of the room, sidestepping Winchester’s attempt to trip him up with his crutch, he can’t bring himself to open the window fully, however. So he just opens it a crack, keeping unspoken the kind of compromise he’s making.
Cas had been so distracted by their conversation, by the numbness that had settled around him that he hadn’t even noticed the hunter’s approach. Dean nodded towards him, lips pressed together tightly. “Cas.”
“Oh god,” Dean gasps, and he looks like he's gonna be sick very soon. “Maybe my dick is what finally does you in permanently.”
“Cas,” he says, voice softening to a much more reassuring tone, and he scoots across the mattress towards his partner, searching for closeness. “Let’s get one thing straight here: your wings? Are fucking
Dean glanced around the room to make sure no other surprises were in store for them, but when he saw that everything else had remained the same, he turned to face Castiel. The angel still had his typical stoic expression plastered onto his face, and he currently seemed to be refusing to meet Dean's gaze. However, despite Castiel's calm, stoic demeanor, his wings were now hanging much lower to the ground than they had been just a few minutes ago. Not only were his wings sagging now, but they were also shaking like two maracas.
Castiels eyes searched back and forth across Dean's face like he was trying to find proof that Dean was honest with him. "But... why?"
Both men turned to the side, and standing with them inside the hub of the cave was none other than Chamuel herself. Her demeanor was serious, so basically, nothing about her was different.
"Option two is we strip you of your grace, and you become human. It's a lot to ask, but I know neither option is desirable. But you have to pick one. It's the only way to make your safety definite."
Obviously, that puzzle piece didn't stay in place too long, but it was nice to have it there while it lasted.
Hunting helped. It always had. And every minute that Dean wasn't hunting, he spent his time searching the internet for a new case. Some things never change.
"Ugh, come on Dea, you don't need to argue with everyone about everything every single damn day of the week." Samantha stated, walking past her sister and out into the hallway to follow Castiel.
"Yes!" Kevin called, running out of one of the downstairs corridors and back into the entry room. "Where was he this time?"
Since Cas still remained quiet and distant, Dean had to assume that the angel was still giving him the silent treatment. So to break the tension, the hunter decided to give Cas a little push.
"Samuel, you're babbling again." Rowena interjected. "Please just hop to the point and skip over the whole tragic backstory, would ya?"
"I didn't mean to bring up a delicate issue. I know I should have still come to check on you when you called me... even if we weren't talking at the time... and I am sorry for-" Castiel said.
"Wait... so you didn't talk over your choices with him?" Chamuel asked, somewhat shocked at the notion.
Jensen grabbed Castiels arm before he could walk over towards the bar. Then Jensen took a step closer to Cas and continued to get closer until his mouth was directly next to Castiel's ear.
Sam honestly hated himself more now than he had in a long, long time. Still, he couldn't allow himself self-pity. Dean would need him now more than ever before.
Deanna giggled. "Alrighty then. You plus me, alone, with a whole lot less clothes on. How does that sound to you?"
"Yes, you were extremely overly prepared to kill me when we first met. You had every weapon you knew of on a table and every warding symbol you had read about painted on the walls. You were well guarded, to say the least."
The voice thought as he drifted off to sleep. Dean was currently too tired to argue with himself, so he let the voice continue.
"Hello, Dean... Castiel." Lisa acknowledged them, slowly pushing herself off the wall and taking a few steps in their direction.
Castiel couldn't help but let out a whimper from Dean's words. He rested his forehead on Dean's. At this moment, Dean was the most open he had ever been towards Castiel, and it turns out they didn't need a truth potion to make it happen.
"Yes!" Castiel stated as he tucked the bouquet under his left arm and reach into his pocket before scrolling through the text on his phone. He then handed the phone to Dean to show him the messages.
Maybe the damage Dean caused wouldn't be too hard to fix, considering Castiel felt comfortable enough to sleep right beside him. However, even Dean's optimism knew that that wasn't likely the case. The angel had no sense of social boundaries. So if anything, Cas probably just found himself to be uncomfy sleeping in the tub and waited until he was sure Dean was asleep to sneak out and take the unoccupied part of the bed. Human interaction was still somewhat lost on Castiel, and this experience was a testimony of that.
Dean let out an annoyed sigh. He hoped that his favorite gun wouldn't get scratched from skimming across the floorboards, but he listened to the women's order and kicked the gun away from him.
"I uh...." Dean began to think of something to retaliate, but he couldn't come up with anything on the spot. In this room, he would have to be honest, and if he were being honest, he would have to admit that this program did lead them to resolve their dispute in some twisted way, but he would rather die than say that out loud.
Surprisingly the smoothie actually tasted pretty damn good. So until whatever spell it had in it kicked in, Dean felt content with his choice for the moment.
Dean turned around, facing away from the bed now. He closed his eyes, hoping that the angel would understand his quite blunt hint to shut the hell up. But of course, once again, Castiel spoke up.
"Well, I don't really think that you have much to worry about. For me to reach true happiness, Dean would need to feel the same way, which I highly doubt he does."
"Alright -Truth: If the world were to end next week (And no, you can't save it this time, so don't you dare give that answer), what would do with your remaining time?" Castiel read to Dean.
"So what exactly is it about this place that you like so much? I mean, I get that it has a gorgeous view, but I never knew you were the type of guy to want a victorian styled mansion."
"So you came up with alternate backstories for all these people, I mean the ones who are actually dead in reality?" Cas asked.
Castiel moved his head to the side so Dean could continue kissing his cheek and neck while he spoke. "I know you said, before, that it only matters if it's just us, and that's fine... it's perfect even... But this is all so new to me, for us... and I don't know... I mean, how do you want... what do we-"
Dean, however, couldn't keep his mouth shut like his little brother. In Dean's defense, he saw what he thought to be a prime opportunity, so he took it.
Dean's mouth was wide open. He had no idea what to say in response to that. Obviously, kissing Cas had struck a chord and not in a good way.
"I know, I know!" Dean sighed, still recovering from laughing so hard. When he finally caught his breath, he realized the position that they were lying in. Castiel was still on top of him, and now they were staring motionlessly into each other eyes with Castiels face only a few centimeters away from his own.
"That's an easy one, the fourth of July with my brother when we were younger. Come on, Chamuel. You will have to do better than that!" Dean exclaimed into the air, even though he had no idea if she was still listening in or not.
Castiel's eyes lit up. Back at the bunker, when the two brothers went off to bed, Castiel had spent much of his spare time playing twister alone. Not sleeping has its perks! Plus the colors on the mat always captivated his attention. Well, that and the fact that humans could make a game out of such a simple concept, fascinated him.
While listening to the rhythmic pattern of Dean inhaling and exhaling. A dreadful thought entered his mind, one he had put off thinking about until now apparently. Today would be his last day with Dean.
"I don't think anything changed, really." Dean sighed, running his other hand through his hair. "I just think that that alternate world really helped me to see things for how they are and for what they could be here." He admitted.
When Dean's eyes adjusted, he looked down to see Castiel look up at him as well. Cas smiled and kissed the tip of his nose, which made Dean blush.
"Ok, fine... whatever, let's just get this round started with since we both have to answer all four of the questions."
"Yeah... um, you see Dean, he kinda... you know... refused to take a bath, and when I turned around to fill up the tub, he had run off and hid under Mary's bed." Kevin explained.
Dean and Cas stood by the door as everyone went to their hotel rooms for the night. Cas insisted on helping the crew clean up a bit when everyone was gone, and Dean decided to be a good fiance and help out. When they were done, Cas held out his hand, and Dean didn't even hesitate to take it.
"In the flesh, well.. wait, no...Technically I am here but not like actually physically here. I am here though through the help of a hologram." Sam replied.
Dean closed his eyes, which transported them back into the bar area; however, the room was full of people this time. A blonde woman walked directly past them to take the corner tables order, and Castiel stood stunned.
It was like Dean had finally reached his breaking point. He no longer drank to numb the pain or hunted to avoid it. Instead, he just stopped. It was like Dean had given up on himself completely. Sam was terrified that he would wake up one morning to find his brother dead or worse.
"I am not your friend or pal or buddy or anything for that matter. All I want to do is to finish whatever the fuck this game is so that I can go home, drink a beer and figure out how to deal with Chuck." Dean stated.
Cas did his best to smile back, but it wasn't that convincing, especially to Jensen, who knew him better than the rest of the cast.
"You're welcome, Dean." Cas grinned like he just had won some sort of mental game that he was playing. Dean had no choice but to admit defeat this time. Usually, his ego would not let a guy compare his physical appearance to a Disney princess. But Cas was different, so Dean let him get away with what most things other men would be socked in the gut for.
"Cassie, we are losing precious time here." Gabriel called from down the hall where he was waiting near the elevator.
"DEAN!" Castiel yelled, interrupting Dean."You wanted me dead, so I left. That's the end of the story. I thought that you and your brother were in danger, and since I had not replied to any of your brother's attempts to communicate with me that this was your SOS signal."
Dean did as he was told, placing the gun slowly on the ground before standing up straight again, his hands up in surrender.
"Did you get a word of anything I just said, or were you too busy talking to hear my response?" Castiel asked.
Samantha stared at her sister like she was an absolute moron. Still, before she could refute Deanna's mathematical assumption, another woman walked into the room. She had already started talking before she got to the doorway and was staring down at a DVD cover she held in her hand. So whoever this lady was, she didn't seem to notice either Sam or Dean yet.
"You don't think my pride could withstand losing a game that's played for childish fun? You really... you truly think I am that shallow?"
"He did... but some of us knew about her existence. Her purpose was important to angel kind. If anything happened to the other remaining archangels, she would be their replacement." Theo answered.
"There was still some hair left on the brush, so I decided to settle my question once and for all and just do a quick DNA test."
"Man, it's huge. How long did it take you to, you know... create this?" Dean held his hand out towards the water to reference the expanse of the lake. It went as far as the eye could see.
"Hello Dean, Castiel." She greeted them. Her face was much more distraught than she had been in any of their previous encounters, though.
"What? Unlike you, I want to use the projection power thing before I leave here. It will probably be the highlight of this entire endeavor." Dean explained.
Castiel stopped the moment he got a better look at some of them. Of course, he didn't recognize them all, but he definitely knew some of the men.
With Castiel's intensely blue eyes no longer staring a hole through him, Dean felt confident enough to speak up. "So what the hell, man?" He asked, folding his arms tight to his chest.
"Fine, BUT if you don't tell me, I won't tell you!" Dean stated, folding his arms like a bratty toddler.
He sat down, alone at the card table, going through the possibilities of each option. He stayed in that room for who knows how long... but once his thoughts start to repeat themselves, he decided to return to the bedroom where Dean still remained.
Dean swiftly unpacked and put away all his new purchases before rushing off to the bathroom to shower and change his clothes. He wanted to dress nice, but he couldn't bring himself to wear any of the suits he owned. Each one made him look far too much like an FBI agent. However, that would make sense, considering Dean only wore them when working a case.
For a short moment, Dean was proud of himself. He lost the game just like he had wanted. But then Dean saw Castiels face. His face seemed to change from one of confusion to one of dread and despair in less than a moment. Bags were under his eyes, and the spark of blue that filled his iris' seemed to have darkened. Dean was looking at a broken man. But at least Cas was safe now.
"Well, no shit, sherlock, but how do two people combine? I mean, the only way I can think of two people combining is through se- ..." Dean trailed off for a second before Castiel thankfully intervened.
"We are in your dream Dean. I thought this would be a much more pleasant way for us to meet up and have a chat. Also, don't worry, the spell O'Malley put on you has no effect here."
"Yes, I needed to prove the nature of my existence to you then, and so my wings briefly appeared in the shadows behind a flash of light." Cas explained.
"I don't understand what Dick Roman has to do with any of this... But as for being stubborn, I guess it takes one to know one." Castiel smirked proudly at his own witty remark while Dean quickly turned his head to glare at the angel.
"No, she has pure intentions! I, on the other hand, would love to see you get angry and tear this place to shreds. However, sadly I was advised not to push your buttons right now. Pity, because I have a bowl of popcorn in the back just ready to help me sit back and enjoy the show!" Gabriel smirked.
They both sat back simultaneously, despite not being able to see the other one through the walls of the cubicle. And as soon as they had relaxed into their seats, they began to watch the images flow across the screen.
"Promise me that whatever happens here or is said here STAYS HERE. You got it? If I can't keep my mouth shut, I will have absolutely no filter, so I have no clue what type of shit I may spew out there. Capiche?"
"Alright... alright, I get it." Dean interrupted, causing Castiel to frown a bit since he didn't get to finish telling Dean all the fun facts he knew about honey bees. Dean decided to retract his statement a bit to keep his friend from retreating into himself again. "I mean... I'm - uh happy that you know so much about bees Cas, but we should probably continue the game before Chamuel decides to add a sixth-round or some shit."
Dean shifted his position on the bed, so he was directly facing Deanna. "Oh, so now we get to be your guinea pigs? Yeah...not happening!"
Dean gives Cas a look of surprise, “yeah well I didn’t want to screw up whatever you had going on either.”
Dean pretends to consider the request. “I suppose I could let you have it, but I would need you to read me my fortune first.”
“What now.” Castiel says turning around. He’s only slightly surprised to see a velociraptor streaking out of the trees and running straight at them.
Donna Hanscum carries the bowl of mashed potatoes out of the bunker’s kitchen to the library where the tables are covered in a Christmas feast. The library is filled with hunters and their families. Jody Mills grabs the bowl out of her wife’s hands and kisses her on the cheek.
“Glad I caught you. Would you mind swinging by the O’Leary farm on your way? The old man called and is complaining about strange noises coming from the barn.”
Unseen Jack observes the gathering before him. His family together and whole. What a miraculous thing they are. All humans really. Sure they could be ungrateful and break your heart, but they could surprise you too, with their love and kindness. The way they changed every day in little ways and big. Jack thought of his predecessor often but he still didn’t understand him. Why Chuck needed control and supplication when he could have just enjoyed his creation. Maybe he was afraid they would outgrow him. Jack hoped that they would. Jack would never become Chuck. He didn’t believe in interference, but he could give a little nudge every now and then.
They stare at each other for a moment before Dean closes the distance between them and wraps his arms around Cas pulling him into a hug. Dean then pulls back, and brings his hands to Cas’s face, cradling it as he stares some more.
Dean can feel tears building up at the corner of his eyes, and he suddenly feels exhausted. Every single day he has to stop himself from talking to Cas. There are the big things like when Mary took her first steps, or when he graduated from his Paramedic program early and at the top of his class. There were the stupid little things like when he found that really good burger joint near the hospital, or this morning when he won three dollars on the scratch ticket he got from Doug for Christmas. Dean just wants to tell Cas about his day.
Dean looked up to make eye contact with her. The man's eyes were watery, but his overall facial expression was blank. "Please don't take my angel away from me..."
All this meant that this was not his Castiel. Chamuel must've transported him into some sort of alternate dimension or something like that. That was the only possible explanation for the texts and the way Castiel was dressed.
Anxiety meds... doctor... what the frick was he talking about? This other Dean sounded more and more like a wimp instead of a hunter. Nonetheless, Dean had to play along. "Uh yeah yeah... they really mellowed me out for the flight." He lied.
"Shhhh, I am trying to concentrate here, now how the hell do you get this projection power up and running?" Dean focused strenuously on the opposing stone wall, but nothing happened. He tried snapping, but still nothing. He waved his hand back and forth, and guess what happened? You guessed it - nothing. "What the hell? They must have given me some faulty spell or something."
Castiel was wondering why Dean had zoned out again for a few minutes. It wasn't like him to just lose focus like this. But here in this cave, it seemed to be becoming more of a common issue. While Dean stood there, Castiel took his seat at the card table. He wasn't planning to start the next round yet, but he wanted to wait for Dean to snap out of his trance.
He didn't respond to her right away, and Chamuel seemed antsy to get on with whatever it is that she does while they run her little obstacle course.
For few moments, Castiel didn't even notice that Dean had appeared in the small room. The same was true vice versa. Both men were so deep in thought about what they had just experienced that they didn't even think to look around for one another right away.
"I enjoy the detailed architecture of that time period. As for the location, I find it calming. I know this lake like the back of my vessel's hand, and so in an ideal world, I would find a home as close to it as possible."
Dean smirked at Castiel's bewildered look, then glanced back down at the zipper/button on Castiel's pants.
"Well, I guess there is no use in trying to fight it. The sooner we get this done, the sooner we can answer those stupid questions and get the hell out of here."
"Nah, man, I mean me and Amara had that thing going for a while, so the darkness doesn't really affect me ." It wasn't a total lie; Dean didn't fear the darkness as much as he had when he was younger. However, his weird link to Amara actually had nothing to do with his new comfortableness in dark spaces; that came through time and experience. But Dean didn't really want to have a full-on heart-to-heart chat about his childhood with Cas at the moment. So, he gave the angel the answer that his odd celestial brain would find to be a relatively reasonable response.
"I've always had wings, Dean, well, except during the time that Metatron took my grace. I am an angel, after all. However, before now, my wings weren't visible to the human eye."
“Alright, I’m gonna hit the hay,” Dean announces, pushing himself off his perch on the kitchen chair. The other men around the table murmur their good nights at him, but when no footsteps follow his, Dean hesitates at the doorframe and turns.
Dean takes a moment to gape at Cas, digesting the betrayal. “Okay, that’s it,” he says as soon as he recovers, and restarts the car. He doesn’t stay to watch Cas approach a helpful looking lady with a map.
Dean dips his chin to hide his grin against his chest. Leave it to Cas to confess his feelings by saying the opposite.
Dean, who still looks a little pale (though he blames it on the harsh Bunker lighting), rubs a hand up and down Cas' back, which is nice, and when Cas makes to descend the stairs again to welcome their guests into their humble abode, insists on carrying Cas down bridle-style, which is less nice and more, as they say, 'overkill'.
Pleased at having found a different outlet for his agitation, Castiel rolls his eyes at him. “I hadn’t realized you’re such a ‘wimp’, Winchester.”
Dean raises an eyebrow at him. “What, being in my arms?” He laughs, makes a joke of it. Because what Cas is trying to say there sounds a hell of a lot like the emotional crap he usually gives a wide berth to.
“I know, okay?” defends Dean, looking positively miserable. “I'm sorry! But in my defense, I've held myself back for almost ten years now, and I only have so much self-control. Plus, Cas is a really distracting kisser.” And he gets that dreamy look in his eyes that tells Cas he's reminiscing about last night. Cas doesn't care to hide the smugness he feels in the face of that. “
The other man grins insolently. “No, but I can read.” He points towards the name tag on the foot of Castiel’s bed. “You know mine?”
Pointing his glare over at him, Castiel notices the closed window. “There’s no air in the room,” he says.
Sam and Dean look at each other, confused for a minute, but then something seems to click. “Annie,” they both say, and then they simultaneously look down at the ground, rubbing at their necks.
“I fell onto a car,” Cas says. If Dean doesn’t want to talk about how he got his leg ‘nearly squashed’, Cas thinks, he doesn’t have to. “I suppose that counts as a ‘car accident’ as well.”
A few minutes later, Dean Winchester strides right into Castiel’s room like he owns the whole hospital and Castiel wonders if Doctor Milton downplayed things because his head injury must surely be giving him hallucinations now.
Before Dean can protest against the implied insult to his Baby, Cas replies, “Sam drove very carefully,” which he thinks defends the car’s virtue enough without hurting Sam’s feelings at the same time.
His beliefs have changed considerably since he met this man, but if there’s one thing he would never have dreamed of believing, it’s this.
“I wouldn’t be so ‘delicate’ if your big mouth would take a break from the constant babbling now and again,” Castiel retorts. “I find your voice very grating.”
“Good to have you here, Sammy,” says Dean once they're alone, and pats Sam's shoulder in brotherly affection. “'Cuz I'd be worried about being stuck here with Cas at such close quarters when he's so desperate to kill himself –”
While Sam and Charlie work out a plan how best to transport everyone to Lebanon and designate drivers for each car, Dean and Cas take their chance to discreetly sneak away.
“Dammit, Cas.” And this time, Dean sounded neither angry nor panicked. It was a different nuance of a bone-deep fear that Cas would have rather not poked at again.
He smiled. This was good. This was what it should feel like to do good. The Bad had to go somewhere after all, and it better go to a place that
“Angels are warriors,” Cas growls, licking a salacious stripe up the underside of his dick as he oh so diligently proves him wrong. “Soldiers,” he adds, tongue making a detour around Dean’s balls and Dean arches his back at the touch. “We have a mission and we pursue it thoroughly. Vigorously.”
In a show of how classy his delinquent band of brethren really is, the sound of wolf whistles follows them outside.
“Well, lucky you,” Dean says, and Cas is no expert in social interaction, but that’s a weird way to respond to someone else’s accident, even to him.
And that voice he knows, because that’s Cas’ voice, and the synapses in Dean’s brain are working rapidly to figure out what Cas’ voice is doing in his room so early in the morning and how that relates to the big lion head that’s still lurking next to him.
“There's a special task force just to keep Cas from seducing Dean because turns out Cas can be a horny bastard if he puts his mind to it and Dean is a weak, weak man.” Charlie adds helpfully, effectively upsetting Cas’ plans who slumps into his chair at the realization.
Dean Winchester into The Angel’s business, you just get out of the way when he slays his way over to 'im.” He spread his arms in a grand gesture. “This is me, gettin’ outta the way.”
“You gotta be more careful”, Dean spoke again, his eyes narrowing at the way his concern made Castiel grin lopsidedly.
Dean’s eyes don’t leave Cas, and there’s a dazed sort of look in them, like he can’t quite believe what they’re seeing. “Yeah,” he breathes. “It did.”
And then Benny slipped out into the hallway. The thump the door made when it slammed shut sounded judgmental in itself, which was impossible – doors had no capacity for the forming of their own opinion – and Cas almost flinched at its finality.
“Dude, that’s not a bad thing at all, that’s a,” Dean snaps his fingers, trying to summon the word he’s looking for. “That’s a
For a frightening moment, the idea of him dying because of some curse lying on the Winchesters' nether regions becomes an actual possibility to him, and in a sudden internal burst of theatrics, he considers signaling a quick I-love-you to Dean and to ask him to tell Claire,
Another few seconds pass in which Dean tries to get over the confusion brought on by the mix of feelings he’s experienced in the first two minutes after being roused from sleep in such a nasty way.
Dormant for so long, they’re full of pent up grief for things unfinished. Guilt and rage and hope all at once thrum through their veins, chasing away the icy water that had them frozen for so long. Mangled by the poisonous fangs of Free Will, they are forever corrupted. They are delinquents, deficient specimens of their race.
Soon, the opportunities that the hunts presented for him weren’t enough. So he began looking for more.
“F-fighting,” he admits. “He was about to ruin Michael’s career. The falling was an accident, though. We were not paying attention.”
Stretching his back, Dean eyes him, one brow raised to the line of his hair. “Uh-huh.” He moves, and the zipper of Cas’ duffel is opened before Cas can so much as let out a warning shout. “Cas,” he scolds, staring down at the infernal device that poses as Cas’ laptop. “We said no work on vacation.”
charms – hey, kinda like Kevin and me! Who are still alive of course, because the author of this story is not a complete bozo.” Kevin looks up from his coffee for a second to meet Charlie's raised hand in a high-five. “But you gotta admit, Cas. There's a pattern.”
“Maybe it means that my pocket knife that mysteriously disappeared last week will find its way back into my jacket?”
Mary bounces up to the group with a shaggy dog close on her heels. The front of her shirt is covered in crumbs and dog slobber.
Dean sits at a table rolling his cold beer between his hands. Sarah and Dalbir talk back and forth leaving him be. The bar is fairly crowded with the usual Saturday night crowd. It’s warm bordering on stuffy, but thankfully there is a cool breeze every time the door opens. Dean is lost in thought, he is remembering his first night as a full fledged paramedic. Things hadn’t turned out the way they had today. They had gotten a call about a homeless man collapsed in an alley. It was so late that it was practically morning. The cold rain had poured down on his head, leaked under his uniform, chilled him to the bone. A chill passes through him as he remembers.
Sam smiles, “you’re welcome.” Sam looks around at all the full tables, and his heart swells. He leans forward and kisses Eileen. “I love you.”
“This is my Uncle Cas!” Mary says excitedly. “He was Daddy and Uncle Dean’s bestest friend in the whole wide world. My Daddy told me all about him.”
Mary grins and holds up her drawing. It kind of looks like a triangle with a circle on top but if you knew what you were looking at you could tell it was an angel. An angel with dark hair and blue eyes and big black wings.
Paul looks up into the bluest eyes he has ever seen. The eyes belong to a handsome man in a trench coat. His hand is still resting on Paul’s shoulder. The man is looking at Paul with a mixture of affection and disappointment. His father used to look at him like that. He really hopes this guy is not a cop.
He hopes he sounds convincing as he says, “don't worry everyone. Santa just needs a little rest but he’ll be up and about by Christmas eve!”
Before Paul can finish his sentence a loud crack rings out. Time seems to slow down. He knows he is about to be in a lot of pain, but the pain never comes. Instead something grips his shoulder strongly and pulls him back.
“I missed you too man. You have no idea.” Dean gives Castiel a once over. “You look good. How long can you stay? Is this like a Christmas thing, you disappear at midnight, or are you here for a reason? Are you going to It's a Wonderful Life me or something.” Dean’s eyes rove up and down taking all of Cas in. “I’m sorry, I’m rambling.”
Castiel visits heaven to spread some Christmas cheer, but even among friends he is haunted by a loneliness that he can't shake.
“They’re good. Jack, well Jack is amazing. As for Mary, she said the only thing disturbing her eternal peace was us,” Cas says gesturing between himself and Dean.
“Cas, I have been dreaming about you, thinking about you, living my life for you, for five years. It took me a long time to accept that you loved me, too long. You saved me. You know that? Your love, it saved me, in every way a person can be saved. And if you want to stay here with me, keep saving me, I’m not going to stop you.” Cas smiles and Dean feels the last piece of emotional armour he’s been holding onto fall away. He brings his hands back up to Cas’s face and stares deeply into his eyes, “I love you too.”
“You didn’t get Cas back.” Dean takes a long swig of his beer and Sam waits before asking him the one thing he hasn’t dared to. “Have you ever, have you ever prayed to him?”
Meg takes his hand and squeezes it. “Castiel, I never thought I could be more than what I was, but then a fallen angel saw something in me worth saving. You helped me unlock parts of myself I thought Hell had burned away permanently. Nothing is written in stone in the world you and Jack have created. If you find a way to get what you want, take it. I want you to be happy.”
