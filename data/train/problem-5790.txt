Steve’s tired mind fumbled for an excuse, any excuse that would satisfy Tony and send him on his way.
“Hey, no. That’s not where I was going with this. We aren’t going to stay here. We’re going to get reinforcements then go back home and kick some ass.”
“Don’t worry, I’m not so drunk that I can’t get it up. Although if you’re not in’erested in that I can always take care of m’self in the bathroom afterwards.”
Steve did not have feelings for Tony Stark. They were friends. That was all. The affection that welled up in his chest was just gratitude. Since moving into Stark’s mansion, Steve had gotten closer and closer to the billionaire. And not in a gay way. In a totally heterosexual and platonic friendship way. It was natural to find your male friend attractive. It was normal to be upset when he spent time away from you. Steve was attached to his friendship.
It wasn’t often that Steve found himself struck speechless. He’d always looked at Tony and thought ‘maybe,’ But Tony had never said anything, and surely after so many years there would have been more to go on than his gut feeling and own useless fantasies. Steve ached as Tony’s expression closed off and he started to pull away. Steve didn’t want that though. Without thinking, he reached up to cup Tony’s face and-
Tony cooed softly as he floated back down, whispering sweet words and petting Steve’s hair. Steve let himself be held for a moment and nearly shook at the comfort he was no longer used to. And then the full situation came crashing back to him.
Tony moved in a slow, sensual grind. Steve’s hands flew to his hips in a futile attempt to hold onto his sanity. He knew he was probably squeezing harder than he should, but he couldn’t help himself.
Tony kneaded Steve’s muscular thigh through the fabric of the tight pants he’d yet to take off. He inched upward and Steve feared he would go for the bulge stubbornly persisting at his groin. Instead, Tony switched to his other thigh and massaged downward to the opposite knee and then skipped his calf entirely. He grabbed Steve’s foot and guided him to rest it in his lap. The bottle of oil made a quick reappearance and then Tony began working in the center of his foot, his damnable thumb back at it with the tight little circles. It moved up to his toes, working over the joints before drifting back down to the heel and up, under the cuff of the pants and around his ankle. Tony released Steve’s foot and replaced it with the other, repeating the process. The quiet settled back around them. This time, Tony didn’t speak as his hands skimmed back up and found the button of Steve’s pants.
“Okay. I guess for starters I should tell you that machine wasn’t for fabricating armor. I’m sorry I lied to you, but I wanted to give you a surprise present. You understand, don’t you?”
It was several hours and half a dozen trucks and vans later when Steve finally pulled up the driveway leading to his latest safe house. No one except Tony knew about this little cabin tucked away high up in the mountains. It would be the perfect secluded place for Tony to recuperate while they worked out their next moves.
Tony looked impossibly sad and Steve felt a punch of anger. What business did Tony Stark of all people have feeling pity for Steve. The man talked to his brain tumor for Christ’s sake. Tony continued to cast that sad look around the office.
Resigning from the Presidency wasn’t a difficult decision. Steve had known at his inauguration this job would only be temporary. Despite what the American people seemed to think, Steve knew he wouldn’t be the right man for the job in the long run. He was a soldier when all was said and done, not a politician. He couldn’t play along with all the life-term politicians mucking up the place with paperwork and red tape. Steve simply didn’t have the patience or temperament needed to lead from behind a desk. Still, it had been nice while it lasted.
Light flickered around the room, dancing as the color faded from Tony’s surroundings. He pulled the B.A.R.F. glasses off and threw them across the room in distaste. At some point he’d exchanged the glass for the bottle. It was empty in his white-knuckle grip. His pants were damp and sticky against his softening cock. Slowly, he stood and shuffled to his room. The images of the re-memory danced behind his eyes as he folded himself into bed. Like every other night this past month, he tried very hard not to think of the phone in his nightstand. In that, like everything else lately, he failed.
That was an answer Steve could live with. This Tony wanted to help Steve save the world. This Tony said he loved him. Whether that was true or not, Steve thought he could make this work for now and plan for anything that may come later. He placed the champagne flute back into Tony’s gauntlet then picked up his own glass.
“It seems to me that we’ve both been doing a lot of thinking. Maybe we should stop thinking and do something about it.”
His smooth tone washed over Tony. It took a moment for the words to register. It’d been so long since Tony had heard that voice, too long. He’d missed it more than he’d realized. He wondered idly if Howard had ever felt like this. If he’d lain awake at night trying to remember the exact timbre with which Steve spoke? Is that why’d he’d been so fond of the original Captain America film reels? (Tony had emulated Howard’s old habit two nights ago. The reels had been grainy and a poor substitute for the real thing. He’d ended up passing out while watching old feed from the Ironman’s HUD.)
Steve was glad he had been dressed as Black Panther when they started watching this. His face was probably as red as a tomato.
“You’re not ready for that yet. Me touching you, it’s overwhelming beyond the point of pleasure right now, isn’t it?”
"So I apologize, admit I was wrong, and all is forgiven. But what will happen the next time? It may not be me, but someone will get a bright idea to save the world. And it will backfire, something will go wrong and we’ll repeat the whole thing again. And again. And again. Unless we act now. We may be the best of the best, but in the end we’re still only human. We’re not above the law. To reject a creed laid down by the world is arrogant and selfish. If we deem the laws of man as below us, then what does that make us? We have to draw the line somewhere. The Accords weren't fair, not yet, but they had potential. They were justified. They were our chance to take the reins and steer the situation onto a good course. Now it’s too late. Do you have any idea the kinds of things that are on the table now; the suggestions they’ve put out to control us? And we don’t have a foot to stand on. No way to fight back without coming out as the bad guys. You want to know the worst part? I saw this coming too. I knew what was about to happen and I was still powerless to stop it. I had a shot to make this all turn out okay and I blew it.”
Tony sped them through the compound down to the basement where he’d spent the last several weeks building a machine that would supposedly fabricate a better, stronger armor. Steve was beginning to have his doubts about that purpose as Tony tapped away at a computer terminal and a pulsing blue light spun into being in the center of the machine.
Steve’s pulse pounded through his head. His hips picked the rhythm back up subconsciously, pistoning short and quick, building his orgasm back up in record time. He hung his head and came with a grunt, allowing himself a moment to linger in Tony’s clinging heat before he finally pulled out and tucked himself back inside his pants.
Tony held his hands up passively in front of himself. He was obviously trying to calm Steve down but he had the audacity to look like he was hurt that Steve was so angry.
“Tony, he was willing to send Sharon to Dr. Faustus, at the end. We need to get you tested for signs of mental manipulation.”
Steve coughed and looked away. Damn Tony. What was it about him that always got Steve so flustered? If it were anyone else, Steve would be able to look them in the eye and calmly state that his workout routine was classified. It wouldn’t have even been a lie. Steve’s workout routine
It was much later, as Steve was trying to work up the courage to leave his room, that Tony came knocking on his door. Steve shut the door behind his best friend and stood in silence staring at his feet, Tony mirroring him. They broke the silence at the same time.
Tony leaned in until there was barely any distance left between their bodies. Steve could feel the slight tremors running through the hand on his shoulder. The scent of scotch was so strong that it was practically burning its way down his throat. Tony drank too much, but this was excess even for him. How long had it been since Tony had last slept? He’d been less and less his usual boisterous self the last few days. Had nightmares been keeping him awake at night too?
Tony stomped back over with a smooth rectangular box of sorts in his hands. He grimaced at the men on screen and began roughly shoving wires into place. Everything went black except for a command prompt blinking in the corner. A few key strokes and a series of jumbled letters and numbers appeared. Tony growled out a curse.
Steve murmured his own “cheers” in answer and drained the glass in one thick swallow. It wasn’t like the alcohol would do anything to him and he didn’t care for the taste enough to savor it. Tony followed suit and poured off two more glasses before Steve could protest. He came around to perch on the edge of the desk, took a slow sip and made a show of licking his lips after. Steve tore his eyes away and drained the second glass. Tony huffed out a laugh.
“Dear Captain,…It’s so strange to write a letter to yourself…Probably wondering…Escape…The true Hydra will never die…no intention of…won’t let you win…already started…This isn’t over…Love, Steve”
“Steve, it’s not mind control, or memory loss, or whatever else you’re thinking. I would know if someone had done something to my mind. I have scanners in place, in the garage. I would know.”
Tony burst out laughing. Steve counted to five in his head before he snapped at the man still giggling in the middle of his living room.
Steve barely registered what Tony was saying, and then the world was spinning, dissolving and reforming all around them. Tony held on tight through it all.
“Earth- Well, who cares what the number is. Ripe for the saving. Our counterparts from this world are already dead so it will be easy enough to slot ourselves into life here. The whole miraculous return from the dead thing. I’m given to understand that before our counterparts died the superhero community was at war with each other. This Earth is a bit of a mess.”
Tony carefully refilled Steve’s champagne. He held his own glass for the first time and gazed pensively at the bubbles rising to the surface. Steve watched his electronic eyes through the golden liquid and waited.
He received no response, but after a moment there was another soft, pitiful sound. Steve didn’t even think before he had the manual release buttons pressed and was pulling off the helmet. Tony’s eyes were closed, still fast asleep but clearly pained.
Steve remembered a night several weeks ago when he had taken Tony up on a similar offer. He’d told himself at the time that it would only be the once.  Now, he reconsidered his options. It had been a fun night, and it wasn’t like he had any other plans for the day.
“Like this,” Steve growled out. Tony nodded his head and clutched at the top of the sofa. Their kissing dissolved into nothing more than a messy press of their mouths together. He was so close now. He just needed a little more. Tony reached down with his free hand and found Steve’s right nipple. Steve’s rhythm stuttered as he tried to simultaneously push his hips up and press his chest into the rubbing. Tony gave his nipple a light pinch and tug and that was the end. Steve felt his body go taut as he held Tony tightly against him, keeping up the pressure on his dick through the orgasm. He pulsed red hot and wet between their bodies until he finally felt all the tension go out at once and he collapsed, releasing his grip on Tony at last. He kept his eyes closed a moment longer as he floated on the post-orgasmic wave of bliss. His newfound peace was shattered when Tony moaned above him.
“You know, I can think of at least one type of exercise that I know you enjoy. I’m free for the rest of the day if you’re interested.”
“And then I find you at home sleeping well-past noon when by all accounts you should have already gotten all hot and sweaty and be tucking into a super-soldier-sized lunch by now. One would almost think you don’t actually like to exercise, Captain.”
Steve mumbled his assent and then Tony swung a leg up and over him to straddle Steve’s ass. Steve started to turn around with a glare, but he was stopped by the first strong press of Tony’s hands down his back. The air hitting the oil over his skin left a trail of goosebumps in its wake. Before he could complain, Tony’s hands were back lending heat. He started slow, hands spread wide to cover more of his flesh, the pressure light. There was a pause as Tony added more oil to cover his entire back and then the pressure picked up. Tony pressed his fingers in deep to rub at spots Steve hadn’t even realized were sore. He inadvertently grunted when Tony reached his right shoulder blade, rubbing at the tense knot he’d found there. He ground into it with the palm of his hand until Steve thought he might be seeing stars dancing behind his eyelids. It hurt in a way that shouldn’t feel this good as that one point of pressure built until it suddenly released with a pop. Steve muffled a groan into the couch cushion as Tony’s clever fingers continued dancing across his flesh.
Tony turned back to look at Steve. “So even super soldiers have trouble sleeping. Who would have thought?” His tone had softened and Steve let out a sigh of relief. “If you want another body beside you so badly, I can introduce you to some very lovely lady friends of mine. Very high class, I assure you. No need to settle for the team drunk.”
The others were talking about the scandal, and Steve knew he should be paying attention, but the film just kept drawing his eyes back. He’d known Natasha was beautiful. Evidently, she was pretty good in bed too. It was little wonder why Tony had fallen so hard for her.
“My, my. I never would have guessed you of all people would be having a lazy morning. I even stopped by that sweat-soaked, testosterone-fueled, beefcake factory you call a gym, only to be told that you hadn’t been seen all morning.”
A quick nod to the guards posted at the entrance was all it took to get them moving. They looked with curiosity at the armor Steve carried, but made no comment. They knew better than to ask questions. No one would know what had been accomplished here tonight if Steve could help it, not until he could be sure Tony wouldn’t leave him.
Five minutes in and it was apparent that this cartoon was designed for an audience much younger than Steve. On the plus side, Steve had learned how to say “up,” “down,” and “nearby” in Spanish. Fury had been rather insistent that in addition to Arabic, Spanish would be a very good language to learn.  Steve had been acclimating to modern English through prime time for a few weeks now. It stood to reason that television could help with his other language problems.
“Don’t stress yourself out too much over this, Tony. If you can’t get it, it’s fine. It’s almost noon, why don’t we go get some lunch?”
The sudden urge to claim, to mark, rushed up in Steve and settled over him in a haze. It was some primal possessiveness that drove him to begin biting and sucking at Tony’s neck and chest even as his hips picked up speed and ground down harder and faster. Tony cried out below him.
It wasn’t gay if he was the one fucking Tony, right? Only sort of gay. A little, tiny bit. Steve still liked woman. But no dame had ever felt as hot and sweet as Tony did around him. Mother and country. Nothing had ever felt this good. That blowjob paled in comparison.
The genius squeezed at Steve’s right hand until he eased up on his grip enough for Tony to pull his hand away. He rubbed gentle circles again. Steve felt a rumble reverberate through his chest and he eased up the pressure of his other hand on Tony’s hip. He opened his eyes when he felt the first brush of wet on the end of his index finger. Tony was holding his hand to his mouth, tongue lazily rubbing up and down the tip of his finger. Tony winked at him and pulled the whole finger into his hot, wet mouth. Steve felt a gush of precome dampen his underwear further.
Tony’s eyes flickered with something Steve couldn’t read. Eyes were supposed to be the windows to the soul. Did computers even have souls?
Tony worked his dick in time to Steve’s thrusts. He felt himself getting closer to climax and started sucking harder. Tony strained against Steve’s grip to force himself further, determined to get Steve’s cock all the way down his throat. He gagged at the first touch to the back of his throat but forced himself to keep going and ignore the tears in his eyes. His airflow constricted and Tony’s fist started moving faster. So close now.
The jet landing disrupted Steve’s thoughts. He went through the motions of disembarking and debriefing. It was nearly as awkward as the flight home had been.
Steve’s anger reared up at those words. He hated when Tony acted like this, like he knew everything and any other contradicting opinion wasn’t even worth considering. Where did he get off dismissing what was clearly a logical theory?
Steve opened his eyes, unaware he had ever closed them. He turned his head to the side, cracking his bones before meeting Tony’s eyes.
“Please. Captain America letting someone else take control? Never gonna happen. You’re a control freak, just like me. Except I do know how to let loose when the situation calls for it.”
Well, Steve supposed, he could stay for a little while. He found the concept of television to be pretty exciting. He’d always loved pictures, but he’d never imagined the possibility of being able to watch cartoons and movies right at home whenever you wanted. Of course, he’d been so busy trying to catch up on sixty years of history and modern advances that he hadn’t had much time to really investigate the wonders of television.
Steve did as instructed and watched the screen filter through a number of readings every time he pressed the button. Tony narrated each feature as they popped up. There was a pedometer to measure his steps with a conversion to miles walked, an estimate of calories burned, a sleep monitor to ensure healthy sleep cycles, and finally a heartrate monitor. Tony explained with manic glee that the watch could be hooked up to a computer via a wire that was still in the box and Steve would be able to chart his activities over a time frame of his choosing. And yes, the doo-dad was water-submersible, so Steve had at least gotten that part right.
“I’d be happy to help you unwind a bit. I’ve taken lessons in the art of massage, you know. I’m sure I can help with all this…tension.”
Curiosity satisfied, Steve gently tucked himself away and glanced around to ensure that they were still alone in the library. He briefly wondered if it would make him gay if he reached down to return the favor with his hand. Guys used to do that sort of thing all the time back during the war. It was the polite thing to do. Besides, touching a dick wasn’t nearly as bad as sucking one. Tony was still the queer one here. Decision made, Steve finally glanced down just in time to see Tony bringing his hand up to his mouth. Steve blinked. When the hell had Tony come? How had Steve missed that?
Steve wasn’t particularly stunned by the revelation that Tony had been working on a way to grow a body. It was obvious that Tony hated not being able to physically interact with the world. He wasn’t sure what Tony would need him specifically for that he couldn’t hire someone to do for him or even do himself using the armor. Most likely something requiring stealth and secrecy that he couldn’t afford to have screwed up.
“I suppose, because you’re right,” Tony began slowly. “This world is flawed and it needs help. What you were trying to do, it wasn’t perfect, but you were close. The original Tony was too weighed down by limitations to have seen that, to have done what it would take to fix things the way they should be. So I guess also because I want to be better than Me. You can understand that, can’t you?”
Spending the night still didn’t mean that Steve was gay. Steve had fallen asleep wrapped up in Tony’s arms due to his exhaustion from their last mission. He hadn’t dated anyone since he’d started this thing with Tony, but he just hadn’t met anyone. And if Tony was also taking a break from dating, well that was none of Steve’s business. He’d stop sleeping with Tony once he found a nice girl to settle down with.
“I would blow you right now, if I could. Just suck down you’re cock until I was choking on it, until you were cumming down my throat.”
“Fuck. Gonna fuck you so good, Darling. Leave you a blissed out mess. Oh God, I love yo- the way you feel. Fuck.”
“How do you like it, Steve? Fast and rough? Slow and soft? Do you like a light touch, or do you need a firm grip? I want to learn all the best ways to please you.”
It was Thursday night and Steve was terribly bored. “Wheel of Fortune” had just ended. The last puzzle of the night had ended up being some new slang term that had really thrown Steve for a loop. What the hell was a “mosh pit”? Melancholy from his failure to understand 21st century terms, Steve wondered if he’d ever be able to catch up to the new culture of America.
“No.  You said the other you had always loved the other me. But you never said how you felt about me-me. The new, improved me, I mean.”
It made the most sense out of any theory Steve could come up with. He’d had access to Tony’s comatose body. What if he’d done something then? Laid down the groundwork while scientists worked to wake Tony up?
The projection was in the center of the room now, holographic clothes gone. It should have been weird, seeing another person naked like this, all static-y and blue, but it was Tony and that just made it all the more erotic.
The loud, creaking protest of the chair brought Steve back to the present. The back of Tony’s chair was probably beyond help and a stab of guilt struck Steve at breaking Tony’s innocent furniture.
He reached down and cupped Steve firmly through the stiff material of his suit. This earned Tony a sharp intake of breath from Steve, followed by a bite near the vicinity of his ear. Tony finished working the pants open and dropped to his knees with a groan. Steve deserved a proper apology for his share in the fighting after all, and there was no better way to say sorry than with a blow job.
Decision made, Steve set the stack of photos down and looked over at Tony, squaring his shoulders and meeting his eyes. Time to see if he could pin this Tony down.
Tony opened his mouth and licked lightly at the tip of the finger, stretching his tongue out for the show. He took a short step back and removed his clothes quickly, leaving on only a small red thong. Steve hardened further at the sight, delighted that Tony had been able to procure the small scrap of material. There had been many late-night fantasies starring a similar thong after Tony had been revealed as Ironman.
Steve was annoyed at Tony’s perception. He wasn’t wrong though. The irony didn’t escape him; the longest he’d ever been in his office was his last night.
Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s crown. Later, he thought. Later, he would talk with Tony about what this all meant. Later, he would worry about what havoc their counterparts were unleashing on the multiverse. Later, they would stop them.
The Quinjet was dead silent despite being filled to capacity with superheroes. It seemed no one quite knew what to say after what they’d just witnessed. Steve kept waiting for the shoe to drop, for someone to say something, but instead the tension just sat heavy and oppressive over all of them. He let out a world-weary sigh and glanced to the cockpit where Iron man was at the wheel. Tony had barely looked at Steve since they’d gotten that video from Steve’s counterpart a month ago. Steve couldn’t really blame him. He wondered how much worse it would get between them after this.
“There you go. You’re gonna make me surrender, aren’t you? Give up my control? Go ahead then. Show me.”
In front of Steve, Tony let out a sound somewhere between a gasp and a whimper and whatever trance Steve had fallen under broke. Tony. He’d forgotten Tony was here, watching all this with him and now that he remembered he’d very much like an explanation from Tony on how and when and why.
A few weeks later found Captain America standing next to a computer console with a newly un-comatose Ironman working to decrypt the mysterious flashdrive that had been sent to Steve by express mail with no return address. The flashdrive had been very heavily protected, and though Steve hated to bother Tony so soon after his recent trauma, he hadn’t been able to find anyone else that could crack it without risk to the data it contained.
Steve brought the shield down on one of the gelatinous tentacles and screamed out his anger and grief. It severed off and continued to wriggle on the ground, spraying a thick, syrupy green substance akin to blood everywhere. Steve brought the shield up again. He heard Thor shout and dodged just in time to be missed by the bolt of lightning. The smell of fried shrimp and limes filled the air. The monster dissolved into a pile of goo. Steve pulled his shield back for another blow as the goop gave a twitch. He let out a cry of delight as Iron Man burst into the sky a moment later. Steve tried really hard not to think about how light his heart felt as he listened to Tony complain about jello in the joints of his armor over the comms.
The part of himself that Tony hated flared to life with hope as their mouths finally met. Wrong. This was absolutely wrong. This wasn’t how this was supposed to go.
They made love there in the dirt and Steve couldn’t help but feel they were consecrating the soil of this new Earth. Tony was right; it would be theirs for the taking. Suddenly he could picture it, just as Tony had described, only so much more. After all, Earth-616 was tricky and they’d need lots of help to save it. Why should they stop at one Earth? Steve grinned into Tony’s sweaty hair.
Steve gave himself a firm mental shake. He’d been letting himself get caught up in his lust and that wouldn’t do. He had to keep his wits about him. There was no way to know how much of what Tony said was actually meant and leaning on him like this would only set up future vulnerabilities.
A small part of him balked at taking off his shirt and bearing all his scars so easily. But he reasoned that in theory the sooner his shirt came off, the sooner Steve’s shirt would also come off. Even better, the sooner both their pants would be coming off. And clearly that was the ultimate goal here.
“I’ve been having nightmares.” The words were enough to freeze Tony in his tracks. It hadn’t been what Steve meant to say, but the truth was as good a strategy as any he supposed. He plucked up his courage and soldiered on. “That’s why I was awake. I thought maybe that was why you were awake too.” The line of tension in Tony’s shoulders looked tight enough to snap. Right. Probably not a good idea to bring up Tony’s issues right now. “It’s easier with someone else sleeping next to me. Maybe that person could be you?”
“Bullshit. Even after you quit the team you still continued to make us new gear and support us financially. It wasn’t long before you jumped back into the fray either. You can’t help yourself. You have to be a part of it.”
A sinking feeling took root in Steve’s stomach. He grappled with what to say to change the subject. Tony was venturing dangerously close to one of Steve’s deepest, darkest secrets. Yet, Steve knew even before Tony spoke his next words that it was too late.
Tony stopped his fingers mere centimeters from the damp spot that had appeared on Steve’s briefs. He traced a single finger over Steve’s washboard abs, the muscles quivering in his wake. Still on his knees, Tony quirked an eyebrow up at Steve, dick tenting his pants between his spread legs. Steve gathered his resolve and lay back down on the couch.
So this was going to be show and tell. Steve wasn’t much of a talker, but he had a feeling Tony was an expert.
Steve looked back at Tony, trying to decipher how he was supposed to react to the present. Obviously, Tony had been excited to gift this to Steve if he’d gone out of his way to find Steve on a Saturday.
Rogers and the Avengers had caught up to them. Steve spun around and made sure he was between their line of sight and Tony. Clearly Tony had been keeping secrets, but Steve would only get the chance to be mad about that if they somehow made it out of this. Dammit all. Just a few more months of planning and they’d have been so much more prepared for a confrontation like this.
The office was, as expected, completely empty and silent when they entered. The fact that nobody knew there were two Tony Starks running around would buy them plenty of time. The fact that both Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were known to be in New York at the moment would save them if there were any unexpected interruptions. They had dressed like their counterparts to ensure nothing would appear out of the ordinary on the security cameras scattered throughout the building.
“Is this how you want it, Cap? Sweet and gentle like this? I was under the impression that you wanted to see me let go a bit.”
He kept his footfalls light as he grabbed up his shield and crept across the room to press an ear against the door. The footsteps were coming towards him. The leather straps on the shield creaked in his grip. Steve counted down until the person was almost upon him. At zero he burst from the door prepared to face down a goon with a machine gun, only just stopping in time as he recognized a familiar mop of brown hair and the scent of top shelf scotch.
“Well, I’m glad you took that to heart. I meant it. What kind of trouble are you in? What’s the threat? I’ll help any way I can.”
“Well, unless he got his hands on a very advanced LMD, I don’t see how there could be another you running around.”
Still, that television on the wall was awfully inviting. He hadn’t really explored beyond “Jeopardy” after that awful venture into the five o’clock news programs.  Bucky had mentioned a whole channel that was devoted to game shows. Maybe if he could find that he’d have something new to watch. Surely there wouldn’t be anything else like that newscaster who had been spewing nonsense about “the homosexual agenda destroying America.”
They had celebrated by taking a short walk through the woods surrounding their cabin. It had given Steve the opportunity to assess Tony’s mobility and coordination, and Tony the chance to touch everything they came across, from the burbling creek, to the crunchy leaves underfoot, to the squishy moss growing on rocks and trees. Steve had worried it would be too much, too soon, but Tony was of the firm opinion that jumping into the deep end was the best way to make sure he was fully recuperated.  Plus, he was bored of lying in the cabin with nothing to look at except the same four walls.
Crossing the country hadn’t been as difficult as one might’ve thought. Rogers was known to be traveling on his motorcycle and news of Steve’s breakout had been kept quiet. Tony assured him that those left behind fighting for power had decided it best not to panic the public and let their own incompetency be known. That had enabled them to move easily for a while. The handy image inducer they’d pilfered along the way had made travelling discreetly to the old Stark storage facility that Tony had been using even less difficult.
Tony instructed him to remove his shirt but to Steve’s disappointment made no mention of his pants. He guided Steve to rub up and down his stomach and sides before finally trailing back down to his thighs.
There was not much on television in the early mornings besides those awful news programs. Unfortunately, outside of missions Steve didn’t have much going on in the mornings, either. He flicked from one channel to the next absentmindedly while he munched on a massive bowl of multigrain cereal. He was becoming more and more accustomed to television by the day.
“I remember what it feels like to have a body. I remember how hard and desperate I used to get just thinking about you.”
Alarms were blaring all over the compound, flashing lights bathed the room in red, and Steve could feel his blood pounding in time to it all with a surge of adrenaline. Rage flowed through him as he grabbed his gear and headed into battle, promising to buy Tony time to escape. Steve didn’t know how they’d been found out so soon, but he’d be damned if he let everything end here.
That’s why he was doing this. The other Rogers was stomping all over some of Steve’s most private thoughts, making a mockery of his desires. The camera zoomed in for a close-up of Steve’s cock as he entered Tony, and Steve realized to his horror that he was starting to get hard.
The box underneath was plain carboard with no discernable features to hint at what may lie beneath. Finally, Steve removed the top and frowned down at the contents. He had no idea what he was looking at. It was about the size and shape of a watch, though the straps looked like they were made out of soft plastic rather than leather or metal. There was no clock face, only a smooth glass rectangle opposite the buckle. Maybe it was one of those new-fangled digital watches? Steve looked to Tony for explanation.
“I’ll say it again if that’s what you need. I’m sorry. I should have told you about your parents as soon as I found out. But Hydra was taking over SHIELD and we had bigger problems to worry about. And soon we were going on raids and everything was good and I didn’t want to spoil it. Then Ultron happened and you took off. It just never seemed like the right time to bring it up. And what was I even supposed to say? ‘Hey Tony. You remember that accident that left you an orphan? Turns out it wasn’t an accident at all. Hydra just wanted your parents dead. No idea why though. And whoever ordered the hit is likely dead now anyway so there’s not much you can do about it. Just wanted to dredge up your pain and make it worse.’ Is that what you wanted?”
Steve nodded again, still not trusting himself to speak. He waited for Tony to begin eating and then realized the foolishness of that. He took a careful bite of steak. Poison wouldn’t make sense after all the effort to break him out, so it should be safe enough to eat. It would be best to play along for now and see where this was headed.
“Even more astounding, you only go a few times a week at most! They tried to get me to tell them whatever secret workout routine you do at home to keep all those rock-hard muscles of yours in tip-top shape.”
“He used to dream about that. The other me. You were always running around with a different lady every week, but he liked the idea that maybe you had never been with another man. That maybe he would get to be your first.”
Steve was instantly alert as he leapt from bed and pulled on a t-shirt. The knocking was constant now and Steve was tempted to answer the door with a punch in the face to whoever had pulled him from his slumber on his day off. That urge only marginally lessened when he saw Tony Stark on the other side, holding a giftbox and looking for all the world like he had stepped straight off a magazine cover. He peered at Steve over the top of his sunglasses, giving a once-over that had Steve flushing despite their familiarity. Steve glanced down and realized that he was still only wearing his briefs for bottoms. Awareness of the bright afternoon sunlight streaming through his windows followed with dawning horror that he had slept much later than he meant to and certainly much later than was expected of Captain America. Tony flashed a Cheshire Cat grin.
Instead of answering directly, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and guided him down to lay beside him on the bed. He remembered the warmth and softness of Jan curled around him until only recently. Tony was nothing like her but he still brought Steve comfort all the same.
Steve grimaced at the slurred words. He should have known. Tony had warned them all when they’d moved in that he was prone to insomnia and tended to wander at night when he couldn’t work. Probably, the nightmare had just made him extra jumpy.
“Fuck off,” he roared, ignoring the tremble in his voice. He shook with rage for acting like such a fool. He never should have accepted Tony’s offer. Steve twisted his hips to dislodge the billionaire. There was a satisfying thump as he hit the ground. Steve sat up with a growl. It was only supposed to be a massage, he'd let this go on too long. Tony’s smile was gone now, replaced by a serious frown.
Still. Steve glanced back at the chamber and remembered the extra knife he’d taken to carrying in his boot. Contingency plans were important.
Tony’s hand found Steve’s, but his eyes remained glued to the screen. He had scrolled down to the post-script on the last page.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head violently as if he could dislodge the truth from his mind. The action had Steve even more concerned.
Steve couldn’t help the small smile that bloomed across his face. Leave it to Tony to suggest they fuck not five minutes after landing in foreign territory. Steve looked around and saw nothing but trees and grass in the immediate area. Tony had probably scanned for electronic surveillance as soon as they landed. Despite his reservations about this plan Tony seemed to have hatched, Steve felt himself harden. Adrenaline from the previous fight and argument spurred his arousal onward. Steve channeled the last of his aggression into their kiss as he allowed Tony to pull him down.
Tony’s grin was vicious as he palmed the front of Steve’s pants. Soft moans echoed all around them. Steve remembered how sweet it had always felt to have Tony all around him. To have Tony in him. He swallowed thickly. Thoughts swam through his head like molasses. When Tony shoved Steve down, he went willingly.
Steve continued to watch as he realized that this new show was some kind of hospital drama. Perhaps it was like that soap opera he’d been introduced to. His suspicions were confirmed a few minutes later when one of the female interns dragged her male coworker into a break room for sex. This was exactly like the soap operas, then. He fetched his cookies and milk, then settled in to try and understand the plot. He hoped there wouldn’t be too many characters he’d have to learn about.
Steve watched carefully as Tony stripped down in front of him, looking for any signs of weakness or imperfections in this body he had synthesized and uploaded himself into only a week ago. The switch from hologram to physical sensation had taken a large toll and Tony had spent most of the first few days hiding in his armor, only removing parts as necessary. It had been several more days of Tony slowly removing the armor piece by piece as he adjusted to so many sensations and Steve adjusted to the trust and love that was developing between them. The chest plate had been the last to come off just this morning.
But then Tony’s tongue kept moving down and it was moving between the fingers he already had inside Steve and he wasn’t stopping, he was still moving and Oh God. Tony needed to stop. That was…that was filthy and disgusting and wrong. Tony’s tongue was in him. What even…what would possess him to try that. Tony’s tongue was in his ass. That couldn’t be sanitary. What if he had to go to the bathroom?
The tongue left and Steve opened his eyes to watch Tony. Tony looked back defiantly and quirked his eyebrow at Steve. Steve knew this was his cue to put a stop to this. Some part of him knew this was wrong. This wasn’t how their game played out. Tony was supposed to put his mouth back on Steve’s dick and keep it there. Then after he came first, Tony would get him hard again so they could fuck. Steve would make sure Tony came on his cock with his name on his lips.
Steve assured himself of this every time he settled in with his laptop and headphones and clicked the ‘play’ button. Steve got hard because of Natasha, not the man driving into her from behind. Steve wasn’t gay.
“Mmm yeah. Shiny and New,” Tony hummed happily as he undid the buttons of Steve’s shirt and pushed it off eagerly. He rubbed at Steve’s shoulders briefly, probably fascinated with the feeling of so much skin to touch, then glided his hands down to begin work on his pants.
They landed in a messy sprawl in the middle of a grassy field. Trees rose up in every direction, with wild flowers scattered about. It was almost like a scene one would expect in a picture book. Tony groaned as he sat up then looked over at Steve. The faceplate popped up to reveal a huge grin on his face. Steve felt the intense urge to punch those shiny white teeth in.
Tony’s eyes sparkled with mirth even as he nodded along and agreed to finally put Steve out of his misery.
Steve grinned and nuzzled at the top of Tony’s head, feeling light and giddy for the first time since his break out.
He briefly entertained the idea of an image inducer, but dismissed it just as quickly. No, even desperate, he wouldn’t fuck a stranger wearing a Tony mask. He’d sounded smug in the letter, rubbing it in Steve’s face. It had to be as close to Tony as possible. Steve’s blood ran cold as a thought struck him.
Tony took his lube-and-semen-coated hand and began stroking his dick, which had remained hard, lying up against his stomach this whole time.
“Yes,” Tony grunted. His head lolled back and Steve leaned down to lay teeth against his exposed throat. In perfect contrast to the first frantic round, Steve took his time now. They made love like that, with Tony’s cock trapped between their bodies. Steve kept moving, even after Tony came, using his cock to grind into Tony’s prostate through the aftershocks. Finally, he stilled.
The sheets had been replaced two nights ago with soft silk after the cotton had proved too scratchy for Tony’s comfort. They slithered and slid against his skin now as Steve pushed him firmly down into the mattress while Tony thrashed about trying to get as much contact with Steve as could be maintained. Their cocks bumped together and Tony groaned, grabbing at Steve and fixing their mouths firmly back together. Steve allowed Tony to thrust up against him for the time being, focused on tasting his mouth.
Letting Tony talk him into bed again wasn’t going to hurt anything. Steve had already fucked him once. A second time wouldn’t make him any gayer. Or a third time. Or a fourth. Or a fifth. As long as Steve stayed in control it was fine. Tony was just really good at sex. Everyone knew that. Steve couldn’t be blamed for wanting it again and again. It wasn’t like they were dating. Besides, Steve never spent the night. It was just about physical pleasure, nothing more.
The man in Steve’s arms opened his eyes- so very blue and perfect- and smiled weakly. It’d worked. There was never any doubt, but until this moment the concept that Tony would have a body hadn’t been real. It had been a fantasy for Steve to think about at night when Tony’s presence had faded to the quiet hum of the armor in the corner. Sometimes it had been a nightmare that woke Steve in a cold sweat and left him awake til dawn contemplating the possibility of betrayal. With those two opposite outcomes constantly battling in the back of his mind, he hadn’t consolidated either with reality. A low moan brought Steve’s attention back from his racing thoughts.
“We are! You know we are. And I didn’t lie to hurt or trick you. I lied to surprise you! It’s the same as if I didn’t tell you where we were going for dinner and then took you to your favorite restaurant. Only in this case your favorite restaurant is another Earth and instead of steak I’m going to get you an army.”
Steve realized as he said the words that it was a good plan. He could work the adrenaline out of his system and get an early start to his day. He’d been getting less sleep than ideal lately, but one more sleepless night wouldn’t kill him. Steve waited as the silence stretched between them for Tony to wish him goodnight and continue stumbling down the hallway. Instead, Tony stared at his liquor.
Tony looked up at Steve with wide eyes as Steve thrust forward until he was hitting the back of his throat. He held himself there and watched Tony’s eyes water as he began to choke then pulled back and allowed the other man a short breath. Steve repeated the process twice more as Tony began to drool. Steve released his grip on Tony, who then dove forward of his own accord to choke himself. Steve waited until he could feel the mix of precome and spit trailing down his balls before he finally pulled away and forced Tony up.
“Cap. It is okay. You felt good; it’s only natural your body would express that. It doesn’t have to mean anything more than that. If you don’t want any more, that’s fine. I can leave, but not while you’re this angry,” Tony said gently. The typical bravado and swagger he’d come to expect had all but disappeared. Steve wouldn’t have thought him capable of such gravitas. This abrupt seriousness threw Steve off balance and left him spiraling. He didn’t know how to react, and then suddenly his anger felt wrong, twisting and filling his insides. How could he be angry when Tony was being so calm and understanding? It was the opposite of everything he’d come to expect from Tony Stark. He grappled for an appropriate response in the face of Tony’s new docile approach. Tony looked up at him with big, blue eyes under dark lashes. Steve opened his mouth, but whatever words he’d been about to speak seemed to dissolve along with his anger. Tony placed a hand on his knee and Steve felt the fight go out of him.
“I’m sorry,” they said at the exact same time. It was silent again as they gaped at one another. Tony was first to speak again.
Tony cut off as the man on screen spoke again. Apparently, the show wasn’t over yet. With the gag out, Tony was much more vocal despite the much less frantic tone to their movements. Tony jumped into action as the other him started issuing amorous declarations that Rogers returned with vigor. Various windows popped up around the video feed, clearly trying to extract as much information from the file as possible.
Steve’s voice sounded breathless even to his own ears. Tony’s grin turned downright predatory. He got back on his knees, legs spread wide. At last, he finally went back to stroking his cock.  His pace was quicker this time and Steve nearly sobbed with relief as he felt himself getting close.
His chest was smooth, just muscle where the RT had sat before. Steve had to wonder if Tony had taken some liberties when forming his dick too. Except he hadn’t, because they’d seen each other naked before and it wouldn’t be that much of a stretch to make it as big and tall as it was now. Steve felt his mouth start to water with all the talk of blowjobs, and the intensity of his desire to touch finally snapped him back from his hormone-addled state.
“A workout, huh?” He took another sip and then looked at Steve through his lashes. His body slumped against the wall lazily with his hip jutting out to emphasize his figure. “I could help you with that. Give you a real good workout, Soldier.”
Steve looked at the now empty bottle with alarm. Leave it to Tony to get the most expensive champagne he could to waste on Steve.
Steve knew even as they dragged him off in chains that this would only be a temporary defeat. He knew his purpose. His destiny was still waiting for him and it would only be a matter of time before he was back on the right track. His supporters, the true believers, would never give up. They would come and free their Supreme Leader and then they would cleanse this world of all that was wrong.
They parted and stared at each other, assessing. Tony waited to see what would happen next, though he already knew. The course of this evening had been decided the moment their lips touched. Tony kept his eyes steady and willed Steve to move first.
He had to leave now. What he’d just done, what he’d just let Tony talk him into, it was wrong. This, what they were doing right now, it was even worse. They shouldn’t be cuddling up together like a couple of fairies. Steve had only had sex with Tony to make the dreams stop. It was just scratching an itch. It didn’t mean anything.
Steve shushed him with a kiss, gentle against his red swollen lips. He pet at the fuzzy covering of hair on Tony’s head.
“I can’t promise that I’ll ever have the answer to that question. But I can make you some other promises. I promise to never lie to you, Tony, if you can promise me the same. I don’t want to fall into the same cycle of love, lies, and betrayal that the other two did. I want to give us a chance.”
“That’s it. That’s so good, Cap. Is this? I’ll give you anything you want, all you have to do is ask,” Tony whispered breathlessly. He slowed down his movements to a gentle rocking. Steve felt his toes curl and pressed up with his hips, trying to increase the sedate pace. “You could fuck me, if you wanted. I’ll ride your nice, fat cock, just like this.” Steve moaned, imagining it. They could. Tony had the oil. He could slick himself up and slide right down. “Or. Or I could suck you off, like I did your fingers. You know I have a good mouth,” Tony continued to babble. He kept talking, one filthy suggestion after another. Steve could imagine them all so easily that he didn’t know what he wanted most. If Tony kept at it like this, it wouldn’t matter. Steve was getting closer with every press of their groins together. He cut Tony off with another kiss, growling into his mouth. He grabbed hold of Tony’s hips and used the grip to move him faster. Tony must have been right there with Steve at the edge, because he started making breathy little moans on each exhale.
Before Steve could ask for more of an explanation the screen flickered, lines of code flashing across the black background and then a simple folder popped up. There were two files: a jpeg and an mp4. The photograph was labeled “read first,” and Tony clicked on it. Steve’s own handwriting flooded the screen as a series of pictures of a handwritten letter popped up. Steve knew instantly that this was not something he had ever written. Nausea rose in Steve's stomach and his hand settled on the back of Tony’s chair as that support became the only thing holding him up. Steve knew that his imposter would get in contact eventually, once he’d somehow gotten out of prison. There was no way he’d be able to let their last conversation go. He skimmed through the words, not absorbing half of them.
“Tony.” Steve started to sit up so they could talk but was stopped by a finger pressing against his mouth. Tony shoved him back down into the couch cushions.
Steve’s hand clenched tightly around Tony’s jaw, forcing it open. He used the hand still in Tony’s hair to maneuver Tony back onto his cock. Tony groaned and pressed a hand to his own dick where it was straining against his pants. He got them open and pulled himself out, sighing around Steve’s dick in relief. Steve warned him to get ready and then shoved himself further inside. He pulled back out just as quickly and set a brutal pace as he began fucking Tony’s mouth in earnest.
Tony’s hands broke the pattern to start gliding up Steve’s stomach instead. Steve hastened to follow, deciding to dip under his shirt and press flesh against flesh at the last minute. The fabric bunched up, gathering at his wrist and exposing his chest to Tony’s electronic gaze. Tony’s hands paused over his pecs so he left his own hands to hover over his nipples, cupping his pecs and curving his hand so the touch was barely there.
Steve kept his eyes firmly locked on Tony’s as he plowed into him. He’d lost count of how many times they’d done this. Tony always felt the same, just as hot and tight as the first time. Steve didn’t think he’d ever get tired of this. Beneath him, Tony gasped and clenched down. Steve kept moving and leaned down to lick into Tony’s mouth. He kept his eyes open until the last second as his orgasm crashed over him. He told himself that it still didn’t mean anything as they cleaned up and curled together on the bed.
Tony paused to refill his glass. He took a larger sip then was probably advisable to buy time before the next bit.
It wasn’t hard to find his counterpart. Captain America was in the thick of the fighting, just as Steve would have been. They truly were the same person. The impact of his hard-light shield was satisfying, even as Rogers recovered and spun around to fight back. Steve was ready. There was no cosmic cube in play this time. Just fists and shields. There was something pure about fighting like this that dimmed all the chaos around them down to background noise. Steve didn’t even notice the familiar whine of repulsors until Rogers had taken a hit and Tony had swooped down to scoop Steve up.
He should know what to do next. He’d done it hundreds of times before. Yet memory and instinct both failed him under Steve’s relentless onslaught. It made sense. Cap was a master strategist. A plan had probably formed in his head the moment he’d decided to stay the course with their interactions this evening. Tony finally decided to get with the program and began undoing his buttons.
Tony had that grim, determined set to his face that meant he didn’t like what he was doing, but by God he would do it for the greater good. His voice only shook a little when he spoke.
This time Tony surprised him by remaining on the floor. He took Steve’s hand gently in his. For a moment, Steve thought Tony might kiss him there, but he simply stared for a long moment before drizzling more oil on his arm. It tangled his arm hair as Tony rubbed up and down. He moved slow, going over front and back, up to his shoulder and down to his fingertips. Like he had with his toes, Tony pulled at each of his fingers, popping the joints.
Tony leaned forward and placed a broad hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve tried not to flinch at the touch. He kept breathing and willed down the sour twist in his stomach. Schooling his expression, he prepared to tell Tony to go to bed.
Steve would be able to touch Tony if he were in a body. The thought raced unbidden through his mind.
Steve pushed away his plate, appetite gone now. He could very much understand that, but it didn’t explain why Tony had come to him. If he had the resources to break Steve out of that prison, then surely he could do whatever he wanted on his own. Unless whatever he needed doing was something only Steve could do. A piece of the puzzle was still missing and it itched in his mind. There was more to it than that, and he’d be damned if he trusted this, this thing sitting across from him without the full story. He reached out and grabbed Tony’s gauntlet at the wrist.
When Steve entered the room, Tony took several moments to react. He blinked slowly and thought carefully about what words he should speak. This would be the first chance he’d have to voice his mind; it was imperative that he didn’t mess this up.
Steve couldn’t sleep. Everything Tony had put in his suite in the mansion was elegant, plush, and entirely too modern for Steve to feel completely comfortable. The mattress was too soft, the sheets too slippery. Some warm milk and late night television would hopefully be just the thing to help him fall asleep on the not-quite lumpy couch.
“Leaving already? But the show’s just starting! I know it’s your favorite. I think you’ll like this version even better.”
“You’re not hallucinating. It’s me. I heard the footsteps and didn’t think it could be anyone up to any good.”
Tony’s hand rubbed up and down Steve’s arm. He took a step closer and Steve got a strong whiff of his aftershave. The heart rate monitor on the wrist strap beeped and a glance down revealed that Steve’s heartrate had spiked.
The words were a slap to his face and Steve flushed red at the obscenity. Tony stood up and moved to walk away but Steve caught his arm.
Old fantasies came forward in his mind. They hadn’t been his, but he still remembered clearly the idea of sitting in the Avenger’s Mansion library late one night as the other two used to do, just Cap and Shellhead. Quiet words would be whispered to each other and then one of them would move, kissing the other. They’d strip each other of their armor and Tony, who was always so confident and worldly, would shy away at first, unsure in the face of a new experience. He would settle back against the couch though, let Steve take charge and whisper sweet nothings as they made love for the first time.
Rogers was an exact copy of Steve in every way, physically. That was Steve’s cock on camera pounding into Tony’s spread ass. Damn that man. He knew Steve liked that, liked watching himself entering his partner and emerging covered in their combined fluids. The sight was as obscene as it was intoxicating and Steve couldn’t look away as his double came because he’d always -
He paled as he continued typing and Steve felt his own stomach turn over with each word of the message that was revealed to them. It was the second letter of the day addressed to one’s own self from another, only this one wasn’t addressed to Steve.
“Of course. I was going to show it to you as soon as I had run the appropriate tests and knew that the machine would work.”
“First, you have to understand that I couldn’t stand with you before, because I wasn’t ready. I was still too new to the world and even after I’d figured out what I needed to do, how I needed to live, I had to be cautious. Thanks to Ultron and his ilk, nobody felt comfortable trusting me, no matter how many times I tried to explain I wasn’t a true A.I., and I couldn’t work freely while I was being watched.”
It probably would have been best for Tony to rest in one place for a while, but there was no time for that. The power siphoned off to get this done would have more than a few eyebrows raised and it wouldn’t be long before someone was sent to investigate. Working quickly, he methodically dressed Tony into the armor his incorporeal form had been using to interact with the world. It would have been preferable to have him walk out of the facility as they had come in, but that didn’t appear to be an option at the moment.
His hypothesis proved correct soon enough as he got the last button undone and then found himself chest to chest with Steve. Coincidentally, being this close also put them groin to groin. Tony was glad to feel that Steve was at least as aroused by these proceedings as he was. He gave a brief thought to moving their activities to the bedroom, but decided the effort was hardly worth it, especially when it also risked spoiling the mood. Best to get the show on the road before any of their senses returned.
Tony’s finger slid down and (finally!) brushed over Steve’s erection. Steve arched his hips up in an attempt to chase the sensation, but Tony simply removed his hand. There was a quiet hiss as Tony unzipped his fly. Steve opened his eyes and watched him shuck his pants and shirt. Tony climbed back up the couch to straddle him again. This time Steve didn’t shove him away when their erections met.
Tony stared at him in astonishment. He gaped, seemingly at a complete loss of words for once in his life. Slowly Steve relinquished his hold and dropped his hand down between them. “That is, if you want.” That jerked Tony back to the current situation. He threw Steve a half-assed attempt at a smile.
“Shall we get these off and wash ourselves up, Darling?” Steve lifted his hips and allowed Tony to pull his sopping underwear off. There was a bathroom with a shower attached to his sleeping quarters, but that would require putting his uniform back on over his sweat and cum-stained skin. He wondered what his chances were of making it there unseen with just the throw blanket from the couch wrapped around him. Tony reached over his head, momentarily distracting Steve with the sight of his chest and the musky smell of their sex. He leaned back and started mopping Steve up with some tissues from the end table. That solved one problem at least.
Tony maneuvered himself between Steve and the door. He deftly undid his jacket and yanked off his tie. Steve’s mouth watered.
Tony’s lips were dry and a touch softer than he had been expecting. He kept himself there for several long seconds as they breathed through the kiss together. Tony’s eyes were glistening when he stepped back.
“God, you’re beautiful.” Steve opened his eyes and watched as Tony took himself in hand and started stroking at a brutal pace. Tony came with a groan a moment later, his jizz shooting out to land on Steve’s chest in hot splashes. Steve blushed and wiggled uncomfortably at the feeling of another man’s come on his skin. Tony sunk down against him and caught his mouth up in a happy sigh. Steve responded to the gentle touch of tongue, even as he wondered uncomfortably what would happen next.
Steve brought his hand back up to cup Tony’s face and rub his thumb soothingly over Tony’s cheekbone.
Lips pressed against his jaw and Tony’s beard scraped roughly against his throat. A shock of pleasure danced along Steve’s spine, stronger than he’d expected from this situation. He grabbed the glass, nearly forgotten in Tony’s hand, then turned and pushed Tony roughly to the bed. The glass would leave a ring on his nightstand but Steve figured Tony could probably afford to refinish it if it stained. He propped his shield gently against the wall before joining Tony on the bed. Tony’s hands reached for Steve’s boxers as his lips descended to his chest. Steve reluctantly halted Tony with a gentle grip on his wrist.
Steve turned slowly as he blushed scarlet and mortification set in. He tried to stutter out a defense while Stark looked at him over his glass of scotch, eyebrows cocked in playful amusement. His eyes roamed back to the TV for a moment and the smirk grew bigger.
He copied Tony’s circling motions, brushing over his nipples again and again as they stiffened. They weren’t the only thing getting harder either. Steve spread his legs to either side of the chair, alleviating some of the pressure from his tight pants. He wanted to reach down and unzip, to pull out his cock and jerk himself off nice and hard, but Tony seemed to be ignoring that part of his body for now.
Tony’s eyes were still closed and his face remained impassive until Steve submitted to his request and Tony let out a small smile. His hand was smooth and soft, like a child’s. There were no scars or calluses from hours spent in his garage working on armor. Steve pressed a brief kiss to each of his fingers- the first real contact of his lips to Tony’s skin- then twined their hands together and settled in.
Steve found his pleasure building back up as he watched Tony discovering his own. He caught himself leaning back down, eager to reclaim the taste of Tony’s skin. He stopped, but Tony caught the movement and pushed the rest of the way up. Steve gasped harshly into Tony’s mouth and groaned when he felt his other hand move down, cupping his balls. A flick of the wrist just there, under the head, and Steve reared back as he started to come.
Really, the notion was complete poppycock. Steve Rogers, Captain America, was not gay. Therefore, he could not be in love with Tony Stark.
Steve sucked in a breath, closed his eyes, and stood up. Before he could think too much about it, Steve pushed his pants down quickly and then sat once more. Tony’s eyes focused briefly on his groin and then fell back to the floor. Steve returned his right foot to Tony’s lap. Tony worked at his calves with the same sedate pace he’d used on his back, right then left, up to his thighs and back. He never touched Steve’s hard cock, never even acknowledged it. Steve allowed himself to relax and ignored the strange disappointment every time Tony got close and then deliberately moved back away.
Steve watched the computer monitor over Tony’s shoulder. Anticipation clenched tight in his stomach and kept Steve pressed snug to the slighter man. Feeds from the security cameras popped up on the monitor, displaying Steve and Tony from four angles. Steve grinned and watched on the screen as his hand trailed up and down Tony’s side.
“This is how it starts, Tony. This is how it always starts. You lied to me!  I thought we were going to be different from them. I thought we were going to be better than Stark and Rogers.”
The motion on his chest slowed and narrowed to a single fingertip tapping gently above his heart. It trailed down the center of his chest and stomach and came to a stop at the waistband of his briefs. It stayed there, not moving, and the tension built. Steve waited, silently hoping Tony would move that inch lower. His arousal was painful to ignore and he no longer cared where the end came from. He could care later. Tomorrow. Steve opened his eyes and looked up at Tony leaning over him.
Steve’s mouth went dry and he choked on his breath. He’d mostly gotten used to Tony’s endless flirting, had even managed to come up with a few witty remarks to fire back. But that’s all it ever was. Tony had never done this before, and Steve hadn’t let himself think about what might happen if Tony was ever serious. There was a hunger in Tony’s eyes that Steve had only ever caught glimpses of in the past. Tony had never directed it his way with such intensity and Steve realized that this was a legitimate offer that Tony was handing him. The look sent a brief spike of lust shooting through him which soured just as quickly.
Steve blinked and the swell of emotions was pushed down, left to simmer in the back of his mind. He offered up the best smile he could manage and informed Tony that it had been very enjoyable. It was even a little bit true. The stains on the carpet in front of Tony were evidence enough of that.
Steve knew as soon as the first image of the room came up on screen what he was watching. He’d seen it dozens of times before. He’d memorized the entire thing. And Tony knew it. Steve felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment. He stood to leave as Natasha slowly stripped off her clothing on screen.
“I was careful. See, it wasn’t enough to pretend to be against you. I had to actually fight against you with everything I had to make them trust me so I could keep working in secret. I’m ready now though. Tony will be waking up soon, and he’ll put me back in the box before I have a chance to do what needs to be done. But I have a plan. I gathered up those of your supporters that I could find and orchestrated your escape. We’ll all follow, if you’ll lead.”
And yup, those were breasts; Large and in full color on the massive television screen. After a moment of shock Steve reached for the remote, but in his haste he managed to push it away, where it skittered across the table and landed on the floor with a solid thawk.
Steve was still weighing his options as he worked the heavy bag when a SHIELD agent wandered into the gym. The gentleman went over to one of those funny machines that were basically moving sets of stairs, picking up the television remote as he went. Resigned to search for the game show channel another day, Steve went back to pounding the sandbag and focusing on more important things.
“You’re drunk.” His anger and disappointment gave the words a bitter taste. Tony was drunk and he didn’t actually mean it. He was just doing what he always did without care or thought. Tony’s laugh shouldn’t have been a surprise, but it was still like a punch to the gut. “Darling, I’m always drunk.”
“I’m pretty sure that term hasn’t applied to me in years. I still have my memories after all. The experiences are there, in my head,” he said with chagrin. Steve reached over and swiped a finger gently across one of Tony’s nipples, delighted when it elicited a moan.
Steve wasn’t drunk. He couldn’t be. His metabolism was much too fast. Sure, Asgardian mead was stronger than anything on Earth. And yeah, the room was spinning a bit. But Steve was feeling lighter and happier than he had in ages. The lights were floating around the room and even Hawkeye had been laughing earlier. The mood had been infectious since they’d begun their latest victory celebration. The only thing that could have made it better would be finding Tony.  He should go do that.
Once all the parts had been gathered the transfer had been held off as long as they could. Ostensibly, Steve hadn’t wanted to give up having Tony as a double agent until it became absolutely necessary. Under the surface, doubts of Tony’s intentions clouded his mind. He wanted to have as much time with Tony as he could while he still trusted Tony to stay at his side. He knew Tony had been disappointed in that decision, had wanted his body as soon as possible, but his willingness to wait boded well for Steve’s current plans for the future.
They’d lost them. Tony had managed to piece together that his counterpart had built a machine to hop across the multiverse. He’d used Reed’s old tech to view different planes of existence until he’d found one that was ripe for world domination. Steve knew his own counterpart wouldn’t give up on this world, what he perceived to be his, but it sure would be a hell of a lot easier to conquer with entire other Earth’s worth of an army fighting on Hydra’s side.
Steve’s finger paused on the remote. This show seemed to be exciting. There was a whole lotta clapping and screaming going on. He watched intently as the black woman on the screen explained that the value of beauty products in the basket were worth over $200 and apparently great for moisturizing skin. Then she started talking about a book club. Huh. Steve had been starting to suspect that people didn’t read anymore, but the lady – “Oprah,” the sign behind her proclaimed- was holding a God-honest old-fashioned book made of paper and everything. Maybe he should look into this book club deal. It would be nice to read something more contemporary.
“Shh.” Tony rubbed a finger gently across his brow. “Stop whatever you’re thinking. Think it later. Enjoy the afterglow now.”
“You’re mine now though, Tony. I’ve already had your first kiss. What should we do next? Should I be the first cock in your mouth? In your ass? What do you want?”
“Oh yes, because finding out from a murderous psycho showing me the video of the Murder was so much better.”
And Tony, well. Stark clearly had nothing to be ashamed of. It would seem his reputation had been well earned. Steve’s eyes followed the sweat glistening on his abs. He’d had no idea Tony was in such good shape. It was especially surprising given his illness and the amount he drank. His muscles bulged as he thrust into Natasha on screen. Natasha’s breathless “ah, ah, ah’s” kept tempo as they danced in the sheets.
Tony stared at Steve, waiting for a reaction. Steve kept his gaze directed at the window while he fought the urge to fidget under those discerning eyes. He knew he had to say something. Finally, he looked back over at Tony and gestured to the package in his arms.
Steve hadn’t meant porn when he suggested popping in a DVD. But Tony had hustled him into the movie room with the promise of something he’d really like and the click of locks on the door.
Tony gave Steve a look that Steve had learned from his soap operas was usually accompanied by the phrase “oh honey.” Fortunately, Tony refrained from this pronouncement, though Steve knew it was there, hanging in the air between them.
Steve nodded his assent. The edge was fast approaching after so long spent teasing. Tony licked his lips and sped up his movements.
Steve stepped to the side as he parted Tony’s ass to ensure the camera would get a good view of the gleaming metal nestled there. He prodded the base of the plug and was pleased to discover the lube had not completely dried. Even so, there probably wouldn’t be enough slick left to fuck Tony with. He pulled a packet of lube from his pocket and wasted no time in adding some to Tony’s puckered flesh where it stretched tight around the plug. He tugged lightly at the base to make Tony groan as his body struggled to keep the plug in. With a wicked grin he twisted his wrist and pulled the plug out with one sharp tug and set it down, standing it up in front of Tony’s face. Tony’s hole fluttered in spasms at the loss. Steve emptied the remains of the lube directly over it.
“Thank you, Tony. I guess I don’t really understand why anyone would want to know all that information, but I’ll wear your fancy watch and let you know how it works.”
“Not that it’s not a lovely offer, Cap, but I don’t do…that. So I’ll just be on my way now and we can never speak of this again.”
Steve didn’t want to fuck Tony. The faint heat of arousal he felt every time he saw the other man was because he’d come to associate him with Natasha and that video.  It was difficult not to remember the sounds of them together grunting and moaning every time Tony spoke. The dirty things he’d said in the video whispered across the back of his mind and he simply couldn’t believe how Natasha had just laughed and responded with filth of her own. He absolutely did not find it arousing. He was not at all craving to have those things whispered to him instead. And when they sparred later that day, Steve did not get hard from pinning Tony to the mat. His erection had started before that. It had nothing to do with the physical sensation of Stark’s big, solid body pressed against his own. The noises Tony had been making were too close to the ones he made in the video. That damn video was starting to affect Steve’s mind.
Tony reached out his hands, but they went straight through Steve’s legs, not even a hint of touch to be felt. He looked down in misery on his two blue hands.
Tony sucked more of the digit into his mouth, massaging it with his tongue as thoroughly as his hands on his body. He wiggled it down to the sensitive skin in between Steve’s fingers, the tip now pressing against the back of his throat. Tony pulled back enough to pull Steve’s middle finger in with his index. Steve picked up the speed of his hips, pressing up against Tony firmly.
Tony’s voice warbled and he closed his eyes again. Some of the tension that had been residing in Steve’s chest for the past few weeks suddenly began to uncoil. Tony couldn’t possibly still be playing a game in his current condition, which meant he was telling the truth, had been telling the truth the whole time. The suspicions and paranoia retreated in the light of this revelation. Steve reached down to unlace and remove his boots.
They stood there together, staring at the two words at the end of the message. That one single line seemed to suck the last of Steve’s strength from him and he leaned forward onto the console, knuckles pressed to the metal surface and head hung low. Even with his eyes closed the words were right there in front of him, a declaration of war that never seemed to end. A hand brushed over his back. Steve let the weight of it settle there.
“We’ll shower first. I’m not going to take you here, like this. I’ll take you to bed once we’re clean.”
Steve teased Tony with his cock, rubbing the head over his rosebud but not yet entering, just spreading the lube around.
“Sorry about that. I didn’t mean to turn the volume up so high. I just wanted to unmute it to hear what they were saying. This shit is too dramatic for captions.”
“Sorry, other me, but I can’t do that. Captain Handsome and I have a date with the Multiverse. See ya!”
“You wouldn’t like me in the morning,” Tony grumbled in his arms. Next to them on the nightstand the ice clinked together as it melted. Steve was pretty sure he’d like Tony better in the morning after a nice hot shower and some breakfast that wasn’t soaked in alcohol. But he’d take what he could get for now.
It was the kind of frenzied fucking that wouldn’t be able to last long. All too soon Steve was moaning as he stilled and came inside Tony. Tony remained still even as Steve pulled out and admired the way his seed dribbled out and down Tony’s thighs. It was a lovely sight. He hoped the camera was getting a good shot.
Tony did something and Steve stopped thinking, stopped breathing for a moment. Then Tony was pushing back in, thicker this time and Steve realized dizzily that Tony had added a third finger. He kept up the little licks around his fingers as Steve’s muscles spasmed in time to his pulse. Tony had never taken it this far before.
Steve took in the sight of Tony’s soft new skin, smooth and hairless. It was an unnatural look and just seemed to highlight Tony’s current vulnerability. Steve reached out and traced his fingers along Tony’s jaw, down over his throat. The thought that it would be so easy to just squeeze down flittered unbidden through his mind.
Tony turned around and gave him a look that screamed disbelief. He opened his mouth to argue the point and Steve took the opportunity to press their lips together. He leaned back and Tony stared at him in wonder. “I don’t let just anybody sleep next to me, you know. It’s got to be somebody I trust.”
It had to be coercion. As much as it twisted his stomach, it was the only answer Steve had been willing to accept.
Steve flushed deeper at the praise; felt his arousal spiral unexpectedly higher. He canted his hips for a new angle and listened to Tony keen. He was blinded by more pleasure that just kept him spiraling up and up and up. Climax hit him like a freight train when Tony whispered his name in completion.
He shivered with sudden cold as it sunk in that he’d just had sex with Tony Stark in the pseudo Oval Office. Tony broke away and slipped his fingers under the elastic band of Steve’s now ruined briefs, drawing Steve’s attention back to the sticky mess in his lap.
“You know, it’s such a shame you’ll be leaving before you even get a chance to personalize the place. I mean, did you even spend any time here? I’m pretty sure this is the longest you’ve ever been in this room.”
