“Sure they are. Slice up some banana for his and you’ve got in one of his five a day already,” Dean said, tossing the fruit to Cas. Cas cut it up carefully onto Jack’s pancakes while Dean plated up his own food and joined them. He watched as Jack struggled to reach his food so badly it looked like he was going to fall right out of his seat for a minute before taking pity on him.
Sam didn’t call Eileen back, but he remained glued to his phone, pinging texts back and forth, dopey smile near glued to his face. Dean couldn’t decide if he was happy for the quiet, or annoyed by the stifling, obnoxious happiness chafing against Dean’s black mood. He turned the music up.
“It’s what Jack wanted. A normal life.”
“Two seater, Cas,” Dean glared.
“You too, Cas,” He said, nodding at Cas’ plate, “stuff to do today.”
i was going to write more but a I'm working out How Toddlers Work at the same time dean is which is surprisingly a Lot, more plot heavy and emotions heavy stuff comes in next chapter when im gonna force these two to start using their goddamn words
“Dean—“ Cas said, taking an aborted step closer, unsure what Dean needed. Dean took a deep breath, and Cas could tell his next words took effort.
, Cas was shifting the child on his hip slightly, leaning down to murmur gently in his ear.
“Yeah!”
“Hey, no. Neither of us have a freaking clue what we’re doing, you’re not living up to anything. You’re a great father, so can it.” He said, punctuating his sentence by shovelling a giant forkful of pancake into his mouth so he had an excuse to stop talking. Cas still had the unbearably soft expression on his face, but nodded and finally tucked into his own food.
“Mornin’ sunshine, pancakes?” Dean asked, jabbing his spatula at the small stack.
Dean deposited the shopping on the kitchen table and started rummaging through them to locate the sandwich supplies he’d run off to grab in a desperate bid to get out of the supermarket as fast as possible.
“Thank you,” Cas said, grabbing them and some plates to set up the table.
“The deal with the Empty is over, Dean,” He said, sensing Dean’s distress. “I’m human now; it can’t take me.” Dean clenched his jaw and nodded, praying he was right.
“Jack’s a kid,” Dean said bluntly, and Sam shot him a bitch face.
“Tell Eileen I said hi,” Dean said, throwing him a knowing grin.
Dean dropped a hand warmly on the knee, more of a comforting rub then a friendly pat, and the ache in Cas’ chest grew achingly brighter. “I can put the kid to bed if you want an early night,” He suggested.
“But you said the bunker’s no place to raise him—”
doing,” he raised his hand to stop Cas before he could make the argument to stay behind.
“What about you?” Cas asked, changing the topic quickly. “You seem… lighter.”
“I don’t know, Sam. What do three year olds eat?”
“What? Thought she was gonna come here in-“
“So what, you burnt up the last of your grace on saving me?” Dean demanded.
“Yeah, well. End of the world tends to eat into your recreational time a bit.”
’ look on his face and Dean could
“Well I’m glad. If anyone deserves a normal life by now it’s you and Dean.” He said. Cas’ heart faltered for just a second at the implication that Sam thought Dean would be spending his life with Cas. He couldn’t have meant it that way though, just that he and Dean had both suffered at the hands of Chuck.
“It’s not broken,” Dean said exasperatedly, nudging Cas aside to have a look for himself.
“Alright, sleeping beauty. Bedtime for the fallen angel.”
Cas scooped Jack up, getting flour all over Dean’s borrowed AC/DC shirt in the process, and perched him on one of the stools. It was too low down and far away from the table for Jack, and he had to pull himself forwards with his arms on the table to even see his plate.
“Oh,” Cas said.
aware, once more. The words kept tumbling into his mind, echoing through the void, bouncing off of surfaces that weren’t there.
“Cas- what the hell?” Dean said, and where Cas had expected to hear anger there was instead confusion, and what sounded like hurt. Cas’ gut clenched.
“Are you okay, Dean?” Cas asked gently. Dean looked up with practiced cheer.
“Dean?” He asked, shifting onto his elbows. The cold iron around Dean’s chest may have vanished but something else, something warmer and softer squeezed at his heart now instead at the sight of Cas sleep rumpled next to their kid.
“I love you so much,” He choked out, and Sam’s face crumpled even further. “You’re gonna be okay.” There was more he wanted to say, things he needed to tell his little brother before he died, but his tongue was heavy in his mouth, his lips going numb.
He paused before the threshold, tilting his head back to the vast expanse of the sky, clear enough to see the stars past the icy puffs of his breath. The stars always made him think of Cas, even though he knew that’s not where heaven was. Even if it was, Cas wouldn’t be looking down at him. That’s not how heaven worked, and not where Cas was. The empty aching in his chest grew a little colder. He pushed in through the bunker door.
“Yeah, so this should be my choice. Or- I should at least get a say in this! You can’t just haul ass out of here-
“I don’t know, Dean,” Cas said apologetically. “The first thing I heard was Sam. His prayer was so loud I think every celestial being could hear it.”
“Jack, PB&J do you?”
“I’m hungry,” He whined.
“Left the shotgun,” Dean jerked his head awkwardly at the desk.
“Dean, no, you can’t go like this, you’re gonna be okay,” Sam begged, but Dean could barely hear him, or the prayers that came next, shouted hoarsely at the world as the last of Dean’s strength failed him and he slumped forwards into Sam’s shaking chest.
“You changed his mind, I could feel his desperation. He wants to be hands off but I don’t think he could bare to see Dean hurt.” Cas said, and Sam smiled to himself. Jack’s absence was suddenly a heavy weight in the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s just- it’s a big change, and it’s all happened so quickly. We fought Chuck
Jack’s room had always been a bizarre blend of childhood and adulthood. There was an empty beer bottle in the waste paper basket, a shotgun and its cleaning tools strewn across his desk. A teddy bear with a voice box in its paw was tucked into his bed, a projector that shone stars on the ceiling was nestled on the bed side table next to a copy of The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe, and a thick volume on hunting wendigos from the Men of Letters’ library. They’d have to redecorate, Dean thought.
“Right so is anyone going to tell me what’s going on or do I have to keep guessing?” Sam said with a grin as he pulled away.
Jack was thrilled by this arrangement. He kept trying to stand up in Cas’ lap to look over the dashboard or crawl around the car while Cas wrestled to keep the squirming boy still. Dean laughed at it at first, but swiftly lost all sense of humour as soon as they hit the main road and he was faced with other cars speeding past them.
“Stay. This time, please. Stay.”
Sam was frozen at the top of the stairs, and jumped a little when Dean appeared.
“Cas, do you want to go or do you feel like you have to?” His voice was gentler than Cas had been prepared for. Anger he could deal with, but the softness in his voice made the craving in Cas’ chest throb.
“Human,” Cas said matter of factly.
“I’m not suggesting we do that,” He raised a placating hand between them, wiping his forehead with the other. “But he’s too big for a baby seat, and a booster ain’t gonna work.”
Dean’s knees almost gave out. “Cas?” He whispered, and the quiet sound echoed through the cavernous room. In Cas’ arms was a small child, hugged close to Cas’ neck. Dean’s footsteps thundered as he clattered down the stairs, duffle bag dropped from his numb hands as he hit the floor.
“You alright, Cas?” Dean asked an hour or so in. “You seem tense.”
“You’ve always been his father, Dean,” Cas said.
And that’s how Cas found them half an hour later, both covered head to toe in flour, Jack seated on the counter stirring a bowl of pancake mix that clearly didn’t need any more stirring, and half a stack of pancakes already to the side of the stove.
Eventually the moment drained away like the dirty water down the plughole, and Dean led the way out of the kitchen and towards the Dean Cave - Sam still refused to call it that - bowl of popcorn, two cokes, and a non spill training cup of juice in his hands. Cas and Jack followed behind, and Cas nearly melted when he felt Jack’s tiny hand slip into his own as they wandered down the long hallway. He gave his hand a little squeeze and Jack squeezed back, his thumb in his mouth as he dutifully followed behind Dean.
He walked straight past the store, and for a minute he thought he might just keep going. Keep walking and not look back until his legs gave out. But then he rounded the back of the store and with the physical boundary between him and Sam, the fight drained out of him all at once. He took a jerky step to half collapse against the rough wall, dragging in shallow breaths that couldn’t possibly be giving him enough oxygen.
“I missed you so much,” Dean whispered, so low Cas wasn’t sure he was meant to hear it.
“Then lets get a house,” Dean said, so quickly he seemed to surprise himself.
“What?” Cas asked, pinching the bridge of his nose and bouncing a grumbling Jack in his arms.
They quietly changed into pyjamas, Dean lending Cas a pair of his, as it’d been years since he needed any, and neither of them wanted to venture back out to Cas’ room to see if they could find some. Dean’s chest grew warm at the sight of Cas in his clothes and he had to look away before Cas caught him staring. They brushed their teeth hip to hip at Dean’s tiny sink, and it felt so domestic Dean thought maybe he
“Night kid.”
“Alright,” Dean said and turned back to the screen, withdrawing his hand and giving it back to Jack to play with. Jack glanced up at Cas, and from the look in his eye Cas was almost convinced the child knew something was wrong, like he could read right into Cas’ thoughts. But then he turned back to fiddling with Dean’s calloused fingers and the moment was over.
leave a comment if u like!!
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean sighed and hung up. He pushed off the back of the impala to help Cas, who was struggling with the booster far more than could possibly be called for.
“I’m not certain children of this age are supposed to consume such sugary meals for breakfast, Dean.”
“So you’re human again, huh?” He said, grabbing a beer from the sixpack. He gestured one to Cas in offering but Cas shook his head.
By the time he was finished eating, Jack was practically nodding off into his plate so Cas declared it nap time. Dean fished the new baby monitor out of the bag and passed it to Cas as he manoeuvred a sleepy Jack into his arms to carry him back to his room, his head heavy against Cas' shoulder.
Cas was watching from the door when Dean turned to leave, light from the hallway spilling in around him like a halo.
“Daddy!” He squealed, and Dean shushed him even as his heart swelled so large in his chest it threatened to choke him.
“Oh. Right. Guess we’ll get one tomorrow. Get some sleep.”
“Alright, two PB&J’s coming right up,” He said. Cas pulled Jack onto his knee so he could reach the table while they waited, and a minute later Dean deposited two plates of sandwiches in front of them, both cut into little triangles with the crusts off. He shoved some bags out of the way so he could sit down and join them, and ate his own sandwich whole, not even bothering with a plate and dropping crumbs everywhere.
Jack watched the bag spin with wide eyes and jumped when the first piece popped. Dean laughed and left him watching the expanding bag as he snatched up a dish towel to dry the dishes Cas was stacking on the rack. They worked quietly, shoulders brushing and occasionally glancing over at Jack to check he was still enraptured by the microwave. It was comfortable in a way life in the bunker had never quite managed to reach before. Cas felt no guilt in taking his time over a small task because he had nowhere else to be, no one would suffer for his indulgence. For once they weren’t outrunning catastrophe. The bubbles dissolved slowly in the sink around his wrists and the popcorn popped rhythmically to his left, accompanied by Jack’s small gasps of wonderment. Dean’s warmth was steady beside him, only pulling away to stack a dry plate to the side and then returning as if magnetised.
“Shut up,” Sam shot over his shoulder as he ducked out of the library.
“Cas, you’re really-“ He broke off, six feet still between them that he couldn’t quite cross over. He should do the usual tests he knew, but it was
“That really doesn’t seem safe. I still think we should take my truck.”
“There’s some- there’s something in my back,” Dean’s voice faltered, and he suddenly felt very small. His head was spinning, and every wet breath he took felt like he was being torn open. He could taste copper in his throat already.
He’d left a damn loaded shotgun in a room with a three year old. He’d been a father to a three year old for all of an hour and he’d already left it alone with a damn

Crowley jerked in surprise at the scream, and liquor splashed across the scroll he was reading.  Cursing, Crowley turned as Dean jerked upright in bed, panting, eyes wide with fear and confusion.
Hi a lot of the same triggers from last chapter apply to this one, its basically one long chapter that I split in two.  See notes for the end.  I put ++++ around the really triggering stuff.  There is not as much as last chapter.
Triggers include violence (Cas hits Dean a few times), references to past rape, possibly present rape and threats to a minor (Dean remembers what its was like with John in the past and questions if it happened again and remembers the threats he used to make sure Dean never talked).
“You’re so beautiful, Squirrel.” Dean froze.
,’ Dean thought.
I'm up in the air about the order of the next couple of chapters, but I will hopefully be posting on time next week.
Dean had been sitting on the porch staring at the ocean, his mind lost in thoughts of what ifs, what haves and what the fuck because the dream guy had appeared a couple more times, and Dean was feeling more and more threatened.  Crowley swore there was no demon or succubus/incubus hanging around Dean so it must have just been his imagination, but there was something just so familiar about the man.  He was bigger than Dean in height and width, had long hair, and Dean was now able to see shadows of high cheekbones and deep set eyes, but that was all. Power still radiated from his hands though, and his kisses were sweet like honey and candy.
Crowley cursed and proceeded to tear the room apart in his rage.  He was horrified that he had touched Dean like that in anger and he was even more horrified that he was horrified about it.
Please see the end for triggers.
“No, no, no. Stop It.”
So I hope you all had a good holiday.  I will try very hard to not go longer than 2 weeks for the next chapter but its only half written so IDK.
“Come on Dean. Why are you getting so upset?  We've been good together — great, in fact! They'll write songs about us, graphic novels;
Dean grabbed a bottle, taking a minute to admire the whiskey before grabbing a few more when the voices rose in anger. Dean paused and then moved closer, wanting to make sure Crowley wasn't going to need his help. It was his job after all.
We have a few rough chapters coming up so hang on.
“Uh, yeah—” one started to answer but Crowley just talked over them.
Dean glanced around as they went into the war room.  This was a big mistake. Emotions flooded him. He glanced over at where Ephraim had been killed and could almost feel the blade entering his chest again. He remembered the terror, and the hurt, when Cas and Sam came into the room accusing him.
“Okay geez fine.”  Dean said taking the flannel off and turning to grab another T-shirt from his bag; a scratchy too tight one but whatever.  Dean heard Sam break out into peals of laughter and Dean spun around.  “What Sam?”
Crowley… I’m sorry.” Dean ground out. It hurt to say it, because he wasn’t the least bit sorry for not killing Cain, but he couldn’t be in this room anymore.
Dean thought about all the times he had failed and all the times Sam had been killed or hurt, and when John found out it was going to be bad, really, really bad.
Dean waved his hand dismissively.  “Not now, Cas, we’ll talk about it later, okay?”
He pushed Dean's hands up and forcefully wrapped Dean’s fingers around the headboard's bars.  “Don't. Move.”  Dean nodded eyes wide, as he tried to relax.  Fuck, but Cas being so domineering was such a huge turn on for Dean.
Dean sighed in anticipation of an argument before explaining further.  “He needs me to go with him to get it, says I’m the only one who will be able to get the weapon.  He’s gonna let me know when he finds out anything else.  But, he uh wants just me to go.  He says it won’t work if I’m not alone.”
“Bloody hell. You had me worried there, Squirrel.”
Benny scowled.  “Well it seems your brother has been grossly misled in the fact that Aunt Mimi’s,” Benny spat out the name like it tasted bad, “Has the best beignets.  So I’m gonna make my famous Lafitte ones and show him what a beignet is supposed to taste like.”
AUTHOR'S NOTE - ART ADDED
Hi everyone, I have a nice long chapter for you.  Its almost a part 1 with the next chapter but it was way too long leaving them together so I picked I think a good place to split it.
Cas reached out and Dean almost flinched, but Cas’ face wasn’t angry it was filled with — well.  Dean wasn’t sure what, but he hoped it was love and yet — was that even possible?
Until then… Metatron snickered at the antics of soulless Sam as he read the next book. Really, the boy was so much more interesting without his soul, pity that Dean, of course, against all odds, had managed to figure out a way to put it back.
Hi everyone hope you all had a good week.  I know last week's chapter was pretty intense, and this week's is a little break from the Dean hurt.  I actually have almost the entire next chapter written, its been a productive week so I don't anticipate skipping next week like I had previously mentioned.
I'll try to post sooner than the week due to the cliffhanger but I still have to write part of it, its just a small part so I will try to get it done this weekend and maybe post Wednesday.
“Dude!”  Dean groused trying to squirm free.  “Kind of naked here Sam.”  Dean muttered.
“Angels aren’t real.” John said turning his gaze back to Cas and tensing as if he was going to attack.
So trigger warnings up the wazoo with this chapter.  You can actually just skip it and read the summary at the end if you want.  Sorry guys this is a heavy chapter.
This chapter is a rough one and has tons of triggers, see end for notes.  I will put a summary at end if you want to skip.
Jolted out of his thoughts by a knife slashing across his cheek, Dean barely stopped the scream that wanted to explode out of him.  “Pay attention to me!”  Drake said.
Dean asks Hannah for help when Sam and Cas are kidnapped by Kate.  She says yes only if Dean agrees to stays away from Cas.
At Dean’s silence, Cain pulled out a large knife. Dean mirrored the action by bringing out the First Blade. An overwhelming feeling of possessiveness swept through Dean as Cain’s gaze locked on the blade.
“Do you really want to try this?”  Dean asked his voice laden with hesitation and hope.  Geez he was such a chick sometimes Dean thought mentally rolling his eyes at himself.
“Is back, yes I know.”  Death said.  “I didn’t do it Dean.”
Crowley just pffted and waved his hand in dismissal. “Just give me the names of the demons leading them and I'll have Dean take care of them.”
“Sam my boy. You grew up.” John said. “You’re so big, you’re bigger than me now.” John said with a chuckle and Sam blushed with pleasure.
Dean could smell the alcohol seeping through Sam’s skin. He couldn’t believe his brother, the smartest man he’s ever known, would do something so stupid.

Dean smiled at Death who stood up and wiped his hands a final time.  “Well I must be getting back.  I’m sure Tessa’s plotting ways to make you miserable as we speak.”  Death said with a smile.
“Yes that would be very unfortunate.”  Death agreed.  The thing is Dean you haven’t yet been united with the blade so now you are kind of stuck in this limbo.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was shaking slightly but he was proud of himself for standing up to John.  He nodded back and went to hand John his journal.
“Shh it's okay, it was just a dream.” Castiel whispered in Dean’s ear.
But Sam sounded confused when he replied. “You don’t want a room?”
Has anyone figured out who Dream Guy is yet?
Cas put a hand on Sam’s shoulder to calm him down.  “Dean, even if you’ve talked to him it doesn’t mean he didn’t have anything to do with it.  We still need to ask or he might know something.”
Hi here is the second chapter for tonight.  I will hopefully be on time next week but I have a chapter that just doesn't fit anywhere but is important so I need to figure that out.
The aftermath.
Startled, Dean's gaze drank in the sight of his angel, his gaze roaming from his blue eyes to his — oh. Shit.  Cas was
Not too much happening in this chapter but it's setting the stage for what is to come and shows a little bit more about how the Mark is affecting Dean.   There are still quite a few chapters left, but hang on cause things will be moving along pretty quickly from here on out.
“Cas… we need to talk.  I have some stuff to tell you and, I’m not gonna lie, it's not pretty.”  Dean said.  He was already trembling with nerves, which Cas saw and frowned at.  “I hope it won’t change the way you feel.”  Dean murmured, his eyes uncertain and scared.
Now, Dean was Crowley’s pet, yet again at the mercy of a demon, all in order to save Sam. He wished he could talk to Dean and tell him how sorry he was. When Cas had told Sam what Dean had done when Cas was captured, how Dean had saved his life twice over by stopping the angels who were going to kill him and then by forcing him to take more grace, Sam was overjoyed that his brother was still, well, his brother. And then Cas had told him how Dean had someone managed to gain control of the Mark. That must have been what he had been working on in the bunker, and the fact that he felt he had to keep that a secret was heartbreaking to Sam.  They were complete strangers and Sam had only himself to blame for that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, Dean… you want to come with us? It's not really something we’ve seen before.” Sam said, and again, he was flashing those puppy dog eyes at Dean. Dean’s first thought was
Triggers are blood and violence, references to past abuse and Dean angst.
Thanks again for the kudos and comments, and most especially the encouragement.  I actually did quite a bit of writing this week and it is looking like there are going to be 4 to possibly 5 more chapters.  I have the next two written and pieces of the rest.  Again thank you for the comments.  You all are the best readers.
Dean shivered as he felt John’s gaze boring into him as he let himself be held by Benny, but Dean just ignored him.  He needed the comfort.  Everything that Drake had done to him flashed in his mind and Dean could feel the rough fingers jamming inside his body and he had a flash of a motel room, John and his hands handcuffed to a bed.
Only triggers are mentions of possible non-con.
So yes, I know, I'm an evil, evil person for leaving you with yet another cliffhanger.  I couldn't help it, I just love how this chapter ends.
“Oh It’s just Crowley messing around.”  Dean said, grabbing his own jacket.
Needless to say, it was one of the more annoying side effects of the Mark.
Triggers include rape, physical abuse, memories of abuse from everyone basically in Dean's past but mostly Alistair and John.  Dean's self hatred and fears of being abandoned.
Death cleared his throat uncomfortably and then replied.  “Uh nowhere important, I have to go.”  Death started to say when the female voice chimed in.
Dean is free but he's scared of what's next.  Sam finally gets to tell Dean something important.
Sam studied his brother out of the corner of his eye as Dean got to his feet. The look of anxiety wasn’t diminishing the slightest from his face. Sam’s stomach sunk a bit. Dean looked exhausted, almost as bad as he had looked when he was struggling with the Mark. Sam wondered if something was going wrong with the band. He really wanted to talk to Dean about it. For Dean to come up with something like that on his own was pretty remarkable. Sam knew most people underestimated Dean, and Sam was by far the most guilty of that, but Dean could be pretty amazing, especially when it came to hunting.
“No sorry Dean but if I hear...”
“But you must understand Dean, this place, it's surprising that I was even able to get to you here.”  Death confessed.
“But my King, you must understand,” the female twin stuttered out. Dean watched as the male twin put a hand on her shoulder as if to warn her. Crowley noticed as well and his eyes narrowed.
+++++++++++++++++
Only triggers include allusions to past abuse and current abuse but nothing graphic.
I should have mentioned this on the last chapter, but the Mark affects Dean differently than in the show and Crowley does not know as much as he did about it either.  I changed it to fit the story, which will become more clear in the later chapters.
“What about death?”  Sam asked.  “He certainly has the juice and it's kind of his thing.”  He added and Cas nodded.
I see. You are the man who gave Dean Winchester parental love in place of John Winchester, correct?
Castiel smiles, still a little bemused but very touched.
If there’s anything worth dying for, this is it.
Eileen told me some, uh, stuff she heard from Cas, and-- well, I had sort of worked out other things before. I mean, I have to live with you both.
He grabs Sam’s HAIR, and YANKS his head up so he’s staring into his eyes.
He comes back to the table and pours a sliver of alcohol from Dean’s WHISKEY DECANTER into each glass, before raising one for himself.

Alright DEFCON, calm down!
You don’t have to apologize. I know you, Dean.
No, no. They cooked for us, so it’s only fair we clean. Besides, with the boys gone, we’re in charge, right?
No, well. I guess I don’t, huh? S’not so bad.
Another break in conversation, as both continue to drink. Dean finishes the rest of his bottle, and puts it aside.
Huh. Guess you really are one of the good guys.
. I mean, that was about-- the apocalypse, heavenly politics, and so on...
And you must be Sam and Eileen! I’ve heard all about you. I’ll leave you to your shopping, but Dean-- the reason I’m here, actually, is my plumbing’s completely on the fritz. I was going to ask the employees here if they knew a good plumber, but... I don’t suppose you’d mind coming around tomorrow to take a look yourself?
Dean sat in the Impala staring at the bunker. He’d been parked here for a little over an hour. He actually had opened and closed the car door several times, but he just couldn’t quite get up the nerve to go knock on the door.
“Why the hell not Squirrel?  He was attacking you!” Crowley yelled back waving his hand up and down his eyes glittering dangerously as he watched as Dean pulled his pants up.
Crowley released Dean’s throat and pulled the towel roughly away from Dean before crashing his mouth into his in a rough possessive kiss. Dean froze. This was the first time Crowley had touched him in anger.
Death nodded looking sad but resigned.  They both stood and the chairs disappeared and Dean shivered again at the emptiness of this place.
Cas's blue eyes were blown, almost entirely black with lust and want.  “Mine!”  He growled as he —
, knowing how manipulative and cunning Crowley really was. All those flashes of looks that Dean dismissed as one thing or another were clearly signs that Crowley was up to no good. And Dean just ignored them. Hell, Crowley waiting an entire month for them to have sex? How could Dean have missed all those signs?
Dean shook his head slightly trying to clear his vision when his eyes caught movement from the doorway.  Dean saw a flash of something moving faster than any human as the being barreled into Drake tackling him to the floor.
Dean pinked in embarrassment because of course he hadn’t, he just dove right in without caring of the consequences.  A hoard of demons surrounded the house, Abaddon was gaining in power and Dean had lost Cas and Sam so he didn’t really care at that point.  “Uh not really.”  Dean said softly.
Nothing really triggering, just Dean remembering his brush with death and Sam and Cas' betrayal.
Dean’s skin felt slimy and gross and he wanted to jump in the shower.
“Who the fuck is this?”  John yelled struggling to get to his feet only to be slammed into the wall again by Crowley’s power dazing him slightly.  John glared as he found himself pinned and silenced with a wave of Crowley’s hand.
Hi guys so here is the other half of the last chapter.  As promised I am posting early since I left you with a pretty nasty cliffhanger.
Within a few seconds Dean realized Cas wasn't healing him the typical way.  No, the angel would wipe the moist cloth and remove the dirt and blood from a bruise or cut, and then kiss it.  A sliver of grace could be felt like a thousand tiny pinpricks of pleasure as it healed him.  At first, Dean sighed and relaxed as bruise after cut after bruise was cleaned and kissed by the angel with the warm cloth that never got cold.  By the time Cas made it to Dean's chest, after having spent way too long healing his neck region, Dean was squirming.
. Now that he knew it wasn’t just a fucked up figment of his imagination, Dean really didn’t want to let his brother and angel know that, once again, Dean had been taken against his will, and by another monster no less. So yeah. That idea wasn’t gonna fly.
Hi Happy Sunday, hope you all had a good weekend.  I have a nice long chapter for you because there was not really a good place to split it.  Nothing too triggering in this chapter.
“He just showed up here last night.  We have no clue.” Dean said, turning to Crowley.  Then softly he said “Thank you.” And the demon smiled.
Hi art by MidnightSilver has been added to chapters 2, 3, 14, 22, 34, 39 and 41.
Hi everyone, sorry this is a day late, I've been under the weather this week.  However, I have a nice long chapter to make up for it.  Its actually 2 chapters but I couldn't find a good place to cut it off and it seemed better as just one so I went with it.  Next week will have a shorter chapter.  I apologize that the chapter sizes seem to be all over the place.  POVs are a bit crazy in this one too.  I hope its not too confusing.  I tried to fix it but then I lost some of what I was going for so left it alone.
“And why is that?” Dean asked, disdain in his voice.  Dean edged his way over to a sword on display, only to watch it disappear. Dean spun around to see a mocking smirk on Dream guy’s face.
And I promise Sam starts to see John differently in the next chapter and Cas will soon follow.  Its going to be quite the roller coaster but just keep in mind every time you want to strangle me - happy ending.
See end for triggers, but nothing too bad.  Thank you again and see you next week!
“So you’re killing again?”  Dean asked, cursing as his voice shook slightly. Of course Cain picked up on it though. He smirked.
“Dean, son… What did I tell you about telling our secrets?”  John tsked.  And with an evil smirk twisting his face, he didn’t even pause for a beat before he raised the gun and shot Dean in the chest twice.
Non-con touching and kissing, then Oberon and Dean fight and Dean is hurt badly,  Oberon violently rapes Dean.
Staring longingly at the door, Dean admitted defeat and started the Impala up. He drove away, never once looking in the mirror, and hence completely missing Sam trying to wave him down.
Hi everyone, I hope you all had a great holiday.  Sorry for posting late this week.  As a present I won't leave you with the cliff hanger I was intending to at the end of this chapter and will post the next one tonight too.
Sam snorted in disbelief, this time unable to help himself as frustration pushed forward. Sam felt Cas put a hand on his arm to calm him.
“Dean, what are you saying?  Have you talked to him?  When?”  Sam asked, his voice getting angry.
“Squirrel! Squirrel! Come on, wake up!” Crowley voice echoed around the chamber. Again, the guy’s face twisted in rage, his eyes burning purple. Dean managed to mutter a last fuck you before following Crowley voice. He snapped his eyes open, finding Crowley sitting on the bed next to Dean. Relief washed over Crowley’s face when Dean’s eyes shot open.
Cas straddled Dean's stomach.  He went to put the cloth on his face and Dean instinctively tried to stop him.
Dean waved his hand dismissively.  “Just some hunters with a bone to pick.  I took care of it.”
“Sir can I get you another order of the beignets?”  Dean heard a female voice ask.
Dean ignored them.  “Where are you?”  He demanded.
I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.
“Dean, you are perfect.”  Cas said, interpreting Dean’s thoughts.
“Dean?”  Cas asked with his adorable head tilt.  Unable to help his automatic response, Dean smiled, even as blushed, feeling a little stupid.  “I just want to see you, Cas.”
Dean got up pulling his gun from behind his back out and approached the door as another series of loud knocks echoed through the room.  Not taking his eyes off the door Dean saw Sam approach from his left with his gun also raised.
Sorry I left another cliffhanger, but it wasn't a totally unexpected one.  Get ready for some hurt Dean in the next chapter.
Out of water and out of energy Dean could only lie there, his body broken and bleeding.  The fight didn’t last much longer and Dean felt Benny gently lift his head into his lap as he called his name.  Dean struggled to open his eyes and moaned in relief when Benny tore the gag off him.  Crowley knelt down next to him.
Except, Sam scoffed. “You actually think I would be mad about that? You saved my life Dean. Again. And you stayed, and took care of me, called Cas to help me… After everything.” Sam paused, and when he continued, his voice was quieter, shakier. “Why?”
So this was a long time coming huh?  I went back and forth a lot on who would actually be the one to kill John.  I narrowed it down to Dean or Sam as I wanted Sam to save Dean but I also wanted Dean to finally stand up to his father and end all the abuse, so having them both shoot and kill John at the same time I think worked really well.  I hope you enjoyed it.
Bloody hell.
Thanks so much as always for kudos and comments.  We are inching close to 700, which is awesome.
“The muppet?” Dean asked, trying to get the guy to talk about anything, if to just stop… this… from happening.
(See the end of the chapter for
Crowley huffed a laugh and glanced up catching the look of possessiveness and lust on the older Winchester’s face as his slimy gaze roamed over Dean’s naked body.  With a snap Crowley had Dean dressed and covered up and he almost laughed at the look of fury on John’s face.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever. I’ll take care of it.” Dean said. “Not like I have a choice.” Dean muttered under his breath. Crowley just huffed in annoyance, having heard him loud and clear but choosing to ignore it.
So there you have it.  I have left a lot of opportunities for timestamps, which are just ideas in my head at this point so I'm not sure how fast I will post them.
“Squirrel don’t!  I couldn’t live with myself if you…. Don’t!”  Crowley yelled.
“Sorry?”  Sam asked and now it was Dean who threw his head back and laughed and Sam couldn’t help but smile at the sight.  With everything that had happened seeing his brother laugh and smile like that was incredible and Sam looked at Death who nodded slightly like he knew what Sam was thinking and Sam gave him a smile back for the first time feeling more comfortable around the powerful being.
So Abaddon bites the dust.  I know she came and went pretty quickly, but the story was never going to be about her.  I just needed an explanation for John coming back and having access to so much knowledge.
Rubbing at his eyes Sam saw a large glass with his favorite smoothie plopped down in front of him and Sam looked up in surprise having not even realized Dean had left the room.
“Dean before you go,”  Death said as he grabbed Dean’s arm and placed a finger over the Mark.  “If you survive, I will do my utmost to help you remove this before it is too late.”  Death vowed.
Dean met Cain’s gaze, and for the briefest of moments he thought he saw compassion and a little pride, before it was replaced with coldness.
Crowley even entertained the thought that Sam was up to something and considered paying him a visit… but he put that idea in his back pocket for now. Sam might not be happy with Dean at the moment, but to go so far as to terrorize him in his dreams? That was not bloody likely.
“Yes, but…” Dean started to explain.
“So. What’s going on today?” Dean asked, only half listening as Crowley rattled off his schedule. Pleased that Crowley didn’t need Dean for anything today, he planned to go check out a possible rugaru a few hours away.
Please leave kudos or comments if you enjoy.
They walked across the street to the diner and sat at a table.  Cas was on the inside and Dean next to him and unfortunately John was across from Dean so he couldn’t really avoid his gaze without it being noticeable.
Dean tightened his arms around the vampire when he thought about how he almost watched Benny get his head chopped off.  Benny looked down in concern.
“Cas!” Dean whimpered, his back arched as he felt the head of Cas' cock pressing up against his rim.
I hope you have a good week, next chapter will be split between Sam/Cas/Crowley and Dean/John.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, I fell from heaven, what do their rules matter to me, to us?”  Cas answered as he reached up and cupped Dean’s jaw.
“See, I’ll make it all better Dean.” He was faceless, with long dark hair, and yet Dean knew he was smiling as he tenderly kissed Dean. Sweetness flooded Dean’s mouth, Dean’s skin tingling as the man murmured sweet nothings, Dean arching into his warmth. The images and pain from his memories were melting away. And as the man pushed inside and started with slow thrusts Dean moaned in pleasure as his prostate was hit right away.  A large hand wrapped around his cock and stroked and twisted.
“I would imagine so yes.”  Death responded with a slight tilt of his head as he peered more closely at Dean.
Dean sighed as he ordered a bottle, hoping against hope that he would be able to get a little bit drunk from it at the least. Even with the Mark suppressed and controlled, it still affected Dean to some extent. Such as right now, his unfortunately increased tolerance to alcohol meant that he needed a worryingly huge quantity just to feel it.
Cas’ words filled Dean up with hope, but then like a bucket of ice water was dumped on him, Dean remembered how Cas had ignored him.  He took a step back.
“Dad, I can’t believe it!” Sam said as he grabbed John in a hug. John hugged him back but over Sam’s shoulder was watching with narrowed eyes as Dean faltered in his shock and wobbled but found himself caught by Cas who wrapped an arm around Dean’s waist from behind to steady him and give him comfort.
Cas stepped as close to the barrier as possible. “I love you too, my Everything.” Cas said with a smile, his eyes burning with love and devotion.
Also, I couldn't just let those two off the hook.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean reared back, shocked.  Unworthy!  If anyone was unworthy it was Dean. “Cas, no!”  Dean started, but Cas held up a hand.
Drake sighed and tucked himself away with a look of pure pleasure on his face from the look of despair and hurt Dean couldn’t hide any longer.  Drake pushed a short dildo through the ring gag and locked it into place and then patted Dean’s head like a dog.  He then yanked the rope back up so that Dean was hanging off the ground by a few inches.  His dislocated shoulder had pain shooting down his arm for a second and then that arm went numb while the other side almost dislocated as all of Dean’s weight pulled at his bleeding torn up wrists.
I answered comments a different way tonight and everything seemed to work so hopefully I didn't miss anyone.  I keep saying I will be better with the comments and then I leave them for a week so again I apologize.  I will keep trying to do better, but please keep them coming.  I can't express how much they mean to me whether you like what I wrote or not I enjoy them all.  I also really appreciate all the kudos, its the most I've even got for a story I've written and its awesome.  Thank you.
Now Dream Guy’s face clouded over with anger. His eyes flashed purple. “You are my possession.” He said, and flung Dean against the bookcase. “You are mine, and I will have you back.” He said. Again, his eyes flashed and Dean was thrown onto the couch and pinned by his power.
Dean has a flash of dream Sam saying Dean seduced John.  The Mark had induced a nightmare trying to get Dean to kill Sam in which Sam taunted him.
Crowley nodded.  “Where’s feathers at?”  He asked looking around the room.
Hi everyone I'm sorry I am a few days late.  This chapter was one really big chapter, I almost split it into three chapters but settled on two so here is the first one.
“And it's not against any rules or something?”  Dean asked again needing to be sure.
Nothing too triggering, see end for notes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh man these are so good.  Where are they from again?”  Dean asked as he grabbed another and hesitated before Death nodded that it was clear of green stuff.
Great news though, AnotherWorld3111 has taken time away from her amazing J2 fic "Ink, Blood and Bullets." and beta'd these chapters for me and is helping me organize my stuff and figure some things out cause I had no idea what order to put some of these chapters in - the downfall of writing stuff out of order.  She is an amazing beta and an even more amazing writer if you want to check out some of her stuff.
“I don’t know.”  Dean mumbled pushing his food around on the plate, his appetite suddenly gone.
However, if that despicable abusive piece of bloody garbage does one more thing than all bets are off.  Crowley will do whatever it takes.  Nothing was more important than keeping his Dean safe, not Castiel, or Sam or even his bloody throne.
There is now art in chapters 2, 3, 14, 22, 32, 34, 29 and 41.
“You should see the other guys.”  He joked but then winced in pain.  Now that he was thinking about it, he could no longer ignore the persistent throbbing.  “It's just bruises and cuts, maybe a broken rib and some knuckles.  It’s fine.  I’m fine.”  Dean said.  He unconsciously rubbed a hand over the Mark, fear unwittingly flashing across his face when he thought about the fight again.
Cas fills Sam in on what he knows about the fae.
Dream guy took another step closer to Dean. Lightening fast, he grabbed a hold of the hair on the back of Dean’s head and yanked it back. “Who’s going to stop me?” He said, bringing his other hand up and caressing Dean’s check. His eyes darkened in lust. “My beautiful hunter,” he purred, brushing his thumb across Dean’s bottom lip before abruptly letting Dean go. Dean stumbled before regaining his balance. The bastard was playing with Dean, and it simultaneously scared him and made him furious.
Okay I know I was horrible to Dean in this chapter, but he was so strong through all of it.  And I promise this is the last one like this.  I'm not saying nothing else bad happens to Dean but this was the worst it will get in regards to actual torture.
After a few seconds of silence Dean went to ask another question his voice choked up, full with shock and awe at the enormity of what his friend was willing to do to help him.  “If I became a reaper, I would never turn into a demon, even with the Mark?” Dean asked his mind whirling.  Did he want to go back to all that pain and humiliation especially now that Sam knew everything?  To fighting for his life every minute of the day and never winning?  To dread being killed because of this damn Mark on his arm and turning into a demon if he was?  But then there was Cas, was it better for the angel for Dean to stay dead because Dean would only bring him down and continue to cause a rift with his family.  But could Dean give him up?  He was the love of his life.   Dean’s mind was awash with the pros and cons.
This was a long chapter so I took part of it out to combine with another chapter.  Hopefully it does not end too abruptly but I think I picked a good spot.
John’s voice yelled in Dean’s head.
Sam would say it was incomprehensible that anyone who had been treated the way Sam had treated Dean would do that… but it was … Dean.
“Dean.”  Death said with a serious tone.  “It is not always up to you to save the world and be the hero.  You can be selfish.”  Death implored but he knew deep down that Dean would never take the easy way out.  It just was not in the boy’s DNA.
I had trouble figuring out what Benny calls Sam in the elevator and after changing it several times settled on enfant gâté, which is French for spoiled child.  Hopefully it works okay, I just really wanted to put in some interaction between Sam and Benny since Cas and Benny got to have their conversation.
This whole situation was becoming ridiculous and spiraling out of control. The demons beneath him started to see Crowley as weak, as Dean being the one in control because Crowley has allowed him so much freedom and had listened to him about certain things.  Agreeing to that no live meatsuit was the final straw and Crowley knew there were factions being created right and left to try and de-thrown him.
“Dean what the hell man.  I don’t..., what?”  Sam asked.
Sam, Cas and Dean hunt a mythological creature.  Dean exhibits more powers.  Dean's luck runs out.
“Because I didn’t want to kill him.” Dean yelled back anyway, trying and failing to push Crowley away.
“Well like I said I’m pretty sure I do.”  Benny said with a smirk not at all intimated by Sam.
“Dean, did you just yell at Death and did he just deliver food to you?”  Sam asked, his voice rising with each word.
Good news, I wrote the epilogue this week and I'm pretty happy with it, bad news, I still have scattered chapters to write, some pretty important, but all the kudos and comments help me so much.  It was actually the response to Crowley and Dean that prompted me to rewrite and add onto the an upcoming Cas/Dean chapter.   So thank you again for all the support!
Cas nodded solemnly.  “I know, and I have a lot of questions, but I need you to know that whatever it is, it won’t change the way I feel.  Nothing will change that, not even this.”  Cas said rubbing a hand over the Mark, which burned at the angel’s touch.  Cas went to pull Dean into a hug and he automatically winced in pain before he could remember to hide it.  His injuries had been all but forgotten with Cas showing up, his emotions pushing the rest of the physical pain away.
All mistakes are mine.
Only triggers are Sam thinking about Dean's past and the videos.
“Hey, hey, hey.” Sam called out when Dean started walking back to the Impala. “Dean, stop.” Sam demanded and Dean froze.
He wrenched Dean’s legs apart and Dean felt his cock at his entrance.
John’s eyes filled with madness. “Dean will be part killing machine part whore. Our own little ferocious pet.” John said with a smile. “Since he obviously can no longer be trained, we’ll have to keep him chained up.” John laughed maniacally. “Yeah, yeah I like that.” He murmured to himself. His gaze landed on Dean again full of lust and darkness.
Triggers include talking about past abuse, suicidal thoughts (or attempt if you want to see it that way), Dean's self hatred.
Dean was jerked back to consciousness by a vicious slap across his face.  His chest and back were in agony as were his wrists and shoulders.  “Stay with me Dean.”  Drake said with another slap.  “I remember you being tougher than this.”  Drake said with a laugh.
“He’s fine.”  Crowley said and Dean started to drift then whimpered as he was jostled slightly.
Another nightmare.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam and Cas exchanged looks again, and pain and longing sliced through Dean again. He never imagined himself being an outsider around Sam, or even Cas for that matter. It hurt, but he had no one else to blame but himself. Dean again thought of how coming here was a bad idea. He really was a glutton for punishment.
“You. Belong. To.
Dean grinned and shook his head.  The reaper was a hard ass, but Dean knew that she was secretly happy that Death was taking time for himself now even if it left her holding down the fort.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am sorry.”  Dean repeated.  “I can’t help it sometimes.”  Dean added and Death just shook his head fondly.
Hi see end for notes.
Triggers include violence, non-con bondage, implied abuse, and non-con touching.
He dozed for what felt like a few hours.  When he woke up, he was still nice and warm, all wrapped up in his angel's arms.  Cas seemed to be mediating, or maybe he was somehow asleep, because his eyes were closed and his body relaxed.
This chapter has not been beta'd so it's a bit rough.  All mistakes are mine.
Thank you all for continuing with the story.  We are getting close to the end here.  Please keep the comments and kudos coming, as they really motivate me and I am having a bit of a block when it comes to the last couple of chapters.
“Dean?”  Cas mumbled, his eyes opening in slits.
Crowley rocked on his heels as he grinned back at Dean, a pleased look on his face, but then caught himself and tried to appear stern and cold causing Dean to grin more.
Dean turned his attention to Crowley. “That was fast.”  Dean said looking at Crowley questioningly.
“No, he would have called me.”  Dean repeated getting aggravated.
Notes - spoilers for the first part of the story:
Triggers include vague references/memories of abuse.  Dean's low self esteem and fear of abandonment.
So here we go, the first of two chapters.  See end for triggers.
Dean smiled as the guy hissed in pain and bent slightly over, releasing Dean, who quickly stepped away from him.
Shocked Dean turned around to see Crowley with his hand raised a second away from killing John.  “No Crowley don’t!” Dean yelled, grabbing Crowley’s hand and lowering it while trying to pull his jeans up with one hand.
This will end on a positive note but it will plant seeds, some pretty dark, to allow me to write timestamps.  I want to further explore Dean's healing, what the Mark does to him and delve further into finding the cure and of course me being me I have to add in something dark and dramatic.
Dean’s face contorted into a scowl of epic proportions.  “He.”  Dean said accusingly while pointing at Death.  “Tried to poison me.”
Dean was having a hard time being here for even a minute or two before Death showed up and even now it was truly terrifying.  To be stuck here for eternity would be horrifying and so much worse than hell, but while the prospect of being a reaper was appealing, Dean would never not try to save his family.  Even if Sam never wanted to see him again, he had to do everything he could to save him.  And Crowley didn’t deserve to die because of Dean, and Cas, well Dean had to try to save his angel.
Dean just snorted.  “You’re delusional if you think I wanted his attention.  But as for being rescued, well I’m not going to argue with you about that.”  Dean said and almost smiled when Drake’s face reddened in rage.  Dean was loving not being able to give him the reactions he wanted so badly from Dean.
Sam only just caught himself from grinning at the look of brotherly indignation and worry in Dean’s eyes, knowing it wouldn’t go over very well right now and would probably be misinterpreted since things were so bad between them. But damn, if it was so good to see that familiar look on his big brother’s face. So Sam just shrugged, Dean stared at him for a few moments before the blank look fell down on Dean’s face again. This time, Dean shrugged back, picking up his beer and visibly turning his attention away from Sam.
Please leave kudos or comments if you are enjoying the story.
Dean’s eyes went wide, his breathing hitched. The dreaded cotton like feeling descended over him. The string had blocked the Mark, exactly how Abaddon’s cuffs had.
Chapter has not been beta'd so all mistakes are mine.  See end for triggers.
“Understatement.” Cas growled. Dean chuckled softly.  Damn, it felt good to be in their company again. Dean could admit that he had been really lonely. Sure, Crowley was very attentive, but he was the King of Hell and extremely busy. So Dean was often off doing his own thing. Dean swore to himself now, to enjoy and remember every moment of this time he had with his brother and angel. When Crowley came for him, who knew how long it would be before Dean was going to be out and about again? Frowning at the thought, he forced himself to push it aside.
“Get the fuck out.” Dean growled. He sat up, looking around for Sam or Cas before realizing there was a soft haze in the air and everything was muted. He was dreaming. How did this asshole get into his dreams, when he was in the bunker of all places? Dean was starting to get sick to his stomach, especially seeing Dream guy tainting the place he used to call home.
Dean reached out a hand and steadied the man looking up into the face of his friend.  “Death!  Are you okay?  Where are we?”  Dean asked rapidly, still somewhat panicked.  This wasn’t how he pictured dying.  It felt weird.  He thought when he died he would either be at peace or being torn apart in hell but now he just felt jittery and as if he was being pulled in two directions and being in this white/gray nothing was terrifying.
“What can I say? I got the taste again.” Cain said. He straightened up and took a few steps closer to Dean. “Good job with Abaddon. A bit of a strange way to kill her though,” Cain said and actually chuckled as Dean’s face flamed red in embarrassment and shame. Dean couldn’t imagine what Cain thought of the fact that he deemed Dean worthy of bearing the Mark, and Dean had to kill Abaddon while having sex with her.
When Dean winks at Cas and Sam I pictured the scene in the green room when Dean winks at Sam right before he kills Zachariah.
Crowley saw Dean’s eyes roll back as he lost consciousness, his heart only sluggishly beating.  Pushing aside the panic he was feeling at the sight of Dean, Crowley growled.  “That flying pigeon better be there.”  And snapped them back to the motel.   Minutes later that felt like weeks Dean was healed up and five sets of eyes watched anxiously as Dean’s long lashes fluttered and a collective gasp of relief was heard when he opened those beautiful green eyes.
Sam’s eyes jerked to the horseman.  “Oh, sorry, uh, me?”   Sam squeaked out, clearly still uncomfortable being the focus of Death’s attention, and Dean snorted in amusement which earned him a glare from Sam.
“He’s right.” Sam added and John’s face got red at Sam’s interference. “He won’t stop anyway.”
I heavily borrowed from the show in this chapter but it really fit so I went with it.
“Of course Dean.”  Death responded.  “Do you remember what happened?”
And now Dean was acting like a brat and outright defying Crowley. A big part of Crowley wanted to say fuck it and give up the throne, take Dean and go far away and just enjoy himself, but Crowley had worked for centuries to get where he was and he didn’t want to give it up. No one was more powerful than him except an archangel — though there were none of them left, Dean if he wasn’t bound by the deal, and of course, Cain.
Weighing his options yet not wanting his time with them to end since it was entirely possible Dean would never see Sam again, he came to his decision.
“I made a promise to you when you died Dean.”  Death said gravely and Dean swallowed hard, his stomach twisting when he thought of that awful void of a place he landed after John had killed him.  Forcing the memories back Dean nodded.
The weeks that followed had been just as hellish as Dean had reverted back to the way he was after John and the cabin, Crowley had lost all his snark and became, for lack of a better description, clingy.  He spent almost all his time at the bunker close to Dean and Cas.  The burgeoning closeness between the demon and the angel, which had been weird enough to begin with, became much more pronounced.  Cas had also looked spooked and never left Dean’s side.  Then finally things had started to go back to normal.  Crowley left for longer periods of time and started to sound like himself, Dean finally snapped out of the almost fugue-like state he was in and Cas started to relax and resumed taking care of his business in heaven again.  But Dean’s control on the Mark had deteriorated in an alarming way and Sam knew their time to find a cure was running out.
“Great mating present. The fun we can have in the lake now. Anyway, I require food.”
“Why are you knocking, boy? You could have just popped in.”
Dean flipped over the second book. It was about angel mates.
Dean frowned, playing with his eggs. “What if Cas doesn’t want me?”
“Six, remember, don’t be late.” Her brown eyes twinkled.
Castiel entwines their hands together, simultaneously share the same breath. Steadily, he breaches Dean’s virgin hole, his cock so hard he feels like he’s going to burst. Slowly, he pushes in, to the wet sultry heat, of his lover. They made Deans body for him, the soft velvet wall’s caressing his cock,”
Deans forest green eyes flashed with anger. “Castiel does not give a damn about me Pam, so don’t bother. Now, are you done I have homework?”
Castiel moved closer and touched Dean’s arm. “Dean, I just want you in my arms. I’m sorry that I made you sad. We will sit down and talk. I guess I did not consider your age, your mental health. It worried me you would hurt yourself and then I triggered you.”
Tables lined up and music blared into the common area. They had placed green and red decorations around the room. There was even a blue spruce at the end of the tables that had gleaming white lights upon it. They scattered gifts underneath, from mates and to their angels. Dean knew for certain his angel would not have sent one and had not bothered to get Castiel one. Well, that was a lie. He had brought his angel a gift, and it was sitting on his bed where it would remain.
Dean felt much better when he got back. Adam kept out of everybody’s way, and they heard he was under massive restriction and on his best behaviour.
“Then so let the bond be made.”
Castiel squeezed Dean’s hand in reassurance. “Dean it's fine if you don’t want to tell me.” he craved to learn but did not want to pressure his young mate.
“Anak stay and guard the entrance. I need you to follow me, boys. Árar bats hate the sound of omega voices, even more so raised in song. They did not expect us to bring you along. Their mistake, we don’t think you’re weak like they treat their life mothers. Come, both of you, and raise your voice to the Heavens.”
“Dean, will you share in Castiel’s laughter and look for the brightness and positives in him?”
The creature rolled his eyes and clapped its hands, turning gradually into its pure form. It was a wispy white shape, with its hot red coal near its heart. It pulsed, and its light became brighter.
Castiel and Eremiel led the assault; they had over six hundred angels at their back. The rest stayed topside to guard the countryside around and the gate itself. They ended up in an immense cavern, stalactites clung to the rocks, and they glowed a faint blue, lighting the dull cave in an eerie glow. Few stalagmites rose from the ground they were short but easy to catch one’s feet on.
“My sister and I won’t let you interrupt our plans. We demand a planet free of humanity. We want the world and the Heavens for ourselves.”
Castiel’s lips twitched as he half turned towards Dean. “All names have a meaning. Dean is an old English name; it means valley. Mallery means unfortunate or Ill-fated.”
Castiel moves to a kneeling position and places Deans legs either side of him. With capable arms, he moves Dean up and down off his engorged cock. The slapping of the flesh is indecent, and the smell of sweat and oil heightens the pleasure in the room. Dean arches his back, and Castiel moves his hands up and down, touching every inch of skin he can find. He nips and bites it, leaving his mark, growling possessively into the untouched skin.
“I expect we need my brother here for this. Shall we retire to your room?”
Dean glanced over at the God, searching out a question he desired to ask. Still crippled with low self-esteem and self-doubt.
“What! We did this?” Dean giggled, even in the matter's enormity.
“What! Why would you do that?” Castiel stood there hurt, shocked, broken.”
“Okay, what’s up?” Dean asked, sitting on a turned over wooden box.
“I know but Dean, you’re mated to a top-ranking angel. It’s difficult, buddy. I tell you what, why don’t, you meet with Amy and Kalen. They would love to talk about us angels with you? I will talk with Raphael.”
Dean examined the angel, needing to know the truth.
Castiel ran his fingers through his messed-up hair, again. “Yes, you’re correct. Dean’s never seen an alpha angel, angry before. It could have spooked him, Pam.”
“It’s great, Dean. I presented as a beta. Kinda early, but they say you can.”
“What! Your, O.M.G. Dean, that’s amazing.” looking back at Dean’s pale face, she tried to calm down. “this is not amazing?” She asked tentatively.
“Yes, of course.” stammered Dean, going red in the face. “I would like that.”
Chuck grinned and nodded his head. “Your uncle has always had a great perception of our kind and how our universe works. He knows you’re special, but not sure in what way. Bobby made sure you could exorcise a demon, fight and speak Enochian. All tools will be a great asset to you in the last days of your journey.”
“What the hell?” Dean gasped, knowing this knife was unique and having no clue what was going on.
Castiel ran back to the elevators. Once descended, he searched for the boy. Skidding to a halt, he grabbed for him.
Castiel stood by him, unyielding at attention with his hands behind his back. Dean was proud of his angel, knew he was lucky to have this fantastic being by his side. He felt love flow through him, his heart thump faster, and tears pricked his eyes. Dean whispered a silent prayer to his angel for calming gratitude.
“Scared of a storm?” Dean laughed at the look of panic on the older man’s face.
Shouting orders in his native tongue. The angel ordered his garrison to search for Dean. Find the boy no matter what. John was out there and their enemies. Castiel clicked his fingers and was covered in armour. His pants were leather, and his ankle boots were brown. The angel had gold stars on his shoulder denoting his leadership and rank, his trusty sword by his side. His four onyx wings sprouted from his back, and three golden halos shone so brilliantly they blinded even the angels that stood in the room.
“Cas is in smite mode.” Charlie giggled even though the air was tense. Joe and Adam rolled their eyes in fondness for their fellow sister.
“I could get more selling the whore for tricks.” growled John, “In fact, get him I’m taking him home. Know a lot of alpha’s who would like to knot a bitch like that.”
Dean also changed his food allowance; made clear he could eat anything. Castiel put a restriction on dessert and candy, but he had taken that off. The angel was not interested in him, so who was he to say what he could or could not eat.
“Thank you, Charlie, keep safe now. I will.”
“Thank you so much.” beamed Dean.
Charlie grabbed Dean’s hand and held it. “Tell me more.” she encouraged.
“My wife took the kids to her mom’s. I need to pick them up. I’m going to Omaha.”
“What.” gasped John staring at the sheriff in shock.
“Your uncle’s fine, Dean, he will recover.” Castiel moved the man to the couch and placed a blanket over him. Castiel put hands on his mate and healed him.
Adam sits up straighter. “Yes, we both will, but it depends where we move after graduation. We will do our best for you.”
Dean nodded and vanished. He stood at the right side of his mate. The plains of Heaven were vast; the purple and yellow suns gave warmth, a gentle breeze washed over them. There were purple-headed mountains in the background and a small babbling river ran close by. Birds of colours Dean had never conceived of flew in and out of the lined-up soldiers much like they were inspecting them.
“Now eat up. I’m glad that Mertha here has been looking after you.”
Gabriel’s eyes blazed blue; his grace was bleeding from his vessel. The older angel clapped his hands with a quick snap. “There, no one can overhear. You’re safe now, Cassie.”
“Just Sammy, he’s four years younger than me. Dad used to get drunk and leave for days. I had to take food to make certain we could eat. I’m sorry, I know angels don’t appreciate that kind of thing. I needed to look after my brother.” Dean voiced.
“No,” Dean stomped his foot.
Dean told him.
“I don’t want to be like dad; I can’t be like him, Cas.” Dean hid his face in Castiel’s side.
“When we bond, I want Dean’s family there,” Castiel told them.
by Metallica. They ate, danced and talked to all their friends. Cutting the cake which was delicious. The happy couple remained hand in hand and got lost in each other’s eyes. Like two lovers should on their big day, forgetting their troubles just for a time.
Adam wiped his eyes and nodded.
Michael took Castiel’s right hand, and Deans left, placing them on top of each other. Then entwined the bound hands with brilliantly coloured taffeta and silk, the omegas of the academy had specially braided. There were six braids, Michael, doing a figure of eight around the couple’s hands.
“That’s awesome, dude. You will be great helping kids getting in for the first time.”
Those who wish I had totally Jealous lol
“My name’s Missouri Mosley, but you can call me Missouri. Now, what is a young boy like you doing out on a chilly night like this?”
“Harry, I need Tula on board; Mertha can communicate with her. You need to establish a complaint about me; anything ridiculous I don’t care.”
XxxxXxxX
“Dean, this is your program with Gabriel. Don’t let the calm attitude fool you he can be a hardass, with classes, and don’t be late.”
Castiel snorted, but held on to Dean tighter; the omega looked at his alpha with bewilderment.
“Let us pray for the Star in the East that guides us, that brings family and friends closer together. Dad gives us so much, and I bless us.”
Castiel and Beta garrison touched ground in Dead Man’s Flats, Alberta, Canada. The pink haze of the Pigeon Mountains rose in the spectacular backdrop of the small hamlet. The sun climbed higher, into crystal blue skies, the scent of pine wafting lazily on the distant breeze.
“She just wanted me to have a homemade pie when I announced I did not have time to make one.” pouted Dean quickly.
“Cas where you cleaning the nest the entire time? Anna said you had gone into hiding, would speak to no one.”
“Let me take your glass, and you can eat.”
Castiel ducked and sprinted the length of the cavern, jumping over the protrusions on the rough rocky ground. His powerful thighs were taking the impact. Pumping his legs hard to reach the surface, he breached the portal and slipped through to earth.
The girls left by the right and the boys by the left sides of the arbour. Sam and Gabriel stood near the stage, Michael had worn his battle dress. His gold breastplate was catching the sun and sending dazzling rainbows dancing among the crowds.
“Of course, but be quick.” Dean nodded and rushed into his bedroom and was back in five minutes.
“Bobby, my friend Charlie, thinks me and Castiel are Star bonded.”
“Friends.” Dean nods.
Castiel flicks hair from Dean’s face and kisses his forehead tenderly.
“Don’t touch or I will flip you over and spank you.”
“So the next gate is in South America, Chile to be exact. The place is Salsipuedeses, roughly translated to ‘get out if you can.’”
Warnings: (Mention of creepy guy at the begging. Dean gets trapped with a man but nothing happens.)
Don't shout at me... There is a reason for my madness. It's been implied it was on the way lol
Beth’s mouth dropped open. “Wow, that’s… You’re giving me feels.” Mertha dabbed at her eyes with a hankie.
“What! Dean ran off Pam, we must have scared him... I had to fight Uriel off him; I have no idea where he went.”
Warnings: (Abusive language, and mentions of Child abuse)
Dean whispered. “The thing is guys, I’m not entirely certain it’s just a test for Cas. I assume it’s a test for me too.”
“Um, we will deal with Adam don’t concern yourself, Charlie. Did Dean say anything that would make you think he wanted to leave?”
“I know Gabe; I understand why Chuck needed to keep me away from him now. If we were the angel and human they talk of, that would help stabilise earth; he would test us, make certain we were strong enough to weather any storm.”
“This is it, the room that they stored the stone.” Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed. “It was a little too easy to get here, be on your guard.”
“You’re welcome. Now, we realised us angels that missed what was going on in the agency. Plans are afoot. We have to change. I want to offer yourself and Dean a job after graduation. You would both have an office. I want Dean to work with Gabriel as well. Joe this would be more your task then Deans.”
Castiel’s eyes flashed red, and he stood next to Dean. “Your wish is my command, my omega.”
Everyone laughed, and Dean grinned, knowing there will be a lot of that going on. “I have known you since my father created the universe. Before the stars were born, before the dust could settle, your apart of my very being. Past, present and future, until the light on our universe, goes out. Forever entwined because no one will extinguish our love. Our story forever engraved on the stars.”
“Oh, I don’t know.” Charlie declared with a twinkle in her eye. “I think it will be amazing.”
Castiel stood beside his young lover and grasped his hands tighter, staring into jade green eyes that constantly dragged him in. “Love when this world is dust, and we are atoms. We will be one with the sky our love with never vanish. No one can keep us apart; no one will declare we are wrong, purely good. Love will win over wars and brutal words. Love will build bridges and repair bones. Love is more powerful than bullets. It’s in the tears of a newborn baby, the rain that falls on a summer’s day and two hearts that beat as one. We will leave to take up arms, and we will stop the Fates bringing Hell to earth; you will discover your rightful place next to my side. You will see your true worth and then you can let the light of your soul flood everyone in its brilliance. I will be there with you every step of the way.”
“I need to find my family,” Dean told her, knowing honesty was his best bet here. “My dad abused me, and he’s escaped from prison. I need to know my family is okay.”
“How could you fucking say that? I did everything for you.” Castiel pulled at his hair, not believing what he was seeing.
“You’re telling me that God, Chuck he as no clue who the chosen people are?”
“Now I’m going to my room. I suggest you sort this mess out between you.” Dean points to the gathered crowd and strides away.
“I-I was told that I was stupid all my life.”
“Hey commander, it sounded like you needed help.” Joe grinned, putting his weapon away.
Dean gets into the chair, and Pam makes car noises, and he snickered at her childish antics.
There were sniffles in the crowd, and Castiel wiped tears from his face.
“I hope there’s pie, Gabe?” Dean asked using a serious timbre.
“Dean, you were a baby, you did the best you could. We angels don’t punish children struggling to feed their baby brothers.” Hannah told the boy.
Just before six, he travelled down and waited next to the dining area. Aggie smiled at him. The dining area was modest but cosy with warm burnt orange walls and a real fireplace. Dean ate everything; he enjoyed it all immensely. Going back to his room, he switched the television back on and got into his pyjamas. His eyes drooped, and he knew nothing else until morning.
“Yes, I think Castiel will treasure that Dean.”
“You will see sweet omega that it was for the best. That my brother truly loves you.”
Charlie and Adam meet jointly and pick up extra food for Dean. Still, on light meals, the poor boy was hungry and ate off their plates. No one stops them, so they continue. Adam was still on restrictions not allowed desserts but confesses to his new friends he’s not got a sweet tooth and would do anything for cheese or bread.
Gabriel rolled his eyes and grinned. “I bring wonderful news. Pack a bag I have got you a HAG.”
The boys wandered into the bank, and Dean received a shock. Sitting down on a chrome chair, he glanced again at his passbook. He handed it to his friend.
“They won’t want me, Pam, not with all my issues.” Dean cried again.
“Your levels are fine, so no water. You need to wear your bracelet at all times, though.”
“Only if you promise to come up with a better name for me.” pouted the angel.
Madan nodded. “Yes, but they like you are not wicked. They were persecuted because they were different. Their angel family had a challenging time hiding them and called to the Lord for help. He took them and gave them a better home.”
“You okay, red?” Dean asks his best friend.
“Dean, will you honour Castiel as an equal in this bonding?”
“Dean, we need to talk.” Castiel grabbed the omega’s arm.
“Yes, Castiel of cause and I accept. I look forward to it. Is there anything else you require me for?”
Uriel smiled for the last time, his hand falling limp by his side. Dean closed his eyes, and he could still see the bright glow from the angel. Sobbing into the angel’s head, he felt the burn, but he did not let go. The sounds of wings, soft winds blew on his cheeks. The soulful songs of angels calling to their lost brother. The sensation stopped, and Dean blinked water out of his eyes.
Castiel knew his mate found it hard to trust even himself. It would take time, but his heart hurt.
“Don’t you be fretting about your outfit; it’s in your room. Also, this came for you.” Mertha’s eyes sparkled as she handed Dean a ruby red bag.
“What is it?” Joe asked, his eyes alight with curiosity.
Dean looked around his room. There was a wooden crate for shoes and a broad brown coat rack. The floors a warm lavender, to the pale blue walls, the contrast in vivid colours assaulted Deans senses, but he liked them. There was an artificial light but no windows, though it was bright. A wrap-around couch snuggled the suite. There was no television, much to his chagrin. But there were stacks of books and games for his perusal.
Dean went to bed; it took him time to fall asleep. Making certain he had Castiel’s feathers under his pillow. He finally succumbed to the fatigue of the day.
“Your dad had no idea who I was, sweetheart, now he will. Come, let’s have some fun.”
“It’s bigger on the inside than the out. If I need to add a room, you need to let me know.”
“Hey, guys you ready?” Dean asked the two angels.
Dean rolled his eyes but grinned back at the angel. He felt hungry for the first time in ages.
Stumbling on some words, Charlie grew louder. Her back to the creature, mindful of Castiel’s warning. Castiel had crept around to block off the entrance to the left cave, the one the beast wanted them to wander down. It hovered an inch off the floor, the pulsing light so bright it almost blinded the angel. Castiel thrust the sword into the creature, and it blinked like a faulty light switch.
“I can’t thank you enough, son. I thought I had money on me. I keep forgetting in my old age.”
XxXxXx
Castiel smiled at his sister and shook Jody Mills’ hand.
“Taking it up to my apartment, you won’t tell anyone, will you? I need something to drink, not used to people telling me what to do.” Dean picked up a magazine it was about cars thank God, but by half nine he thought he was pushing his luck and stood up.
Gabriel raised his eyebrow. He knew that Kevin, Charlie and Dean did just that. But he had no clue that this little angel held so much malice towards humans, and it saddened him his hunch was right after all.
“Damn it, did Castiel not hear my message about John Winchester?” Uriel pushed his face near the cell bars.
Dean had no clue what to think about any of this. Is this why Castiel did not want him? Was he being forced by God himself to be together? Cas had left his feather, and only mates did that. Giving a part of himself, showing his love. It was intimate and unique, and he was sure he did not warrant that kind of devotion.
Dean deposited his dirty tray and walked over to his angel. “Hey Cas, you look nice.”
“I will pass the message on. I need to inform you that Rook is a demon, and he’s heading this way. He was the last time my minions spoke to me.” The demon grinned like a shark.
“Now, don’t be getting into every stranger’s car, you hear me, boy? They ain’t going to be nice like me.”
“I can’t, but you forget I’m an angel, Dean. I have exceptional hearing.”
“What’s going on, guys?”
“Charlie honey, you need to calm down,” Castiel tells her.
“I don’t have any clothes; I just need Cas,” he whined, clutching the edge of the table, feeling dizzy again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wow, that’s wonderful not had one of those before.”
Madan raised his eyebrows and carried on with his tail. “One, but she was the Alpha Fate, the one that sired her sisters. She carries no heart; it turned to stone. The Fate made a spell, so all Nephilim’s would perish. If you stepped out of this room, it would rip your human soul from your body, making you a monster. That would be your punishment, and we would have to…”
“Do you know the angel creed?”
“No, not yet, but you will. Now I am going to find your father. I want you to find your suite and settle in, and we will meet up in the morning.”
“Damn it, I’ve lost him.” sobbed Castiel tears were falling down his face.
“Gabriel, Castiel’s Deans mate, how can I manage this?”
“You did the paperwork, Mr Winchester. Dean belongs with us, take the money or leave.”
“So, how’s this new improved Castiel?” Gabriel enquired with seriousness in his tone.
Castiel and the other angels went with Dean, Adam, Charlie, and Joe as they swept forward and entered the room.
“Your uncle as knowledge and a safe room that no evil can penetrate. Two angels now guard Sam, I will send support to your grandmother. Don’t worry Dean they will be safe that’s my promise to you.” Chuck tried to reassure the boy.
“I know Uncle Bobby, that’s why I got Crowley involved. He got his son somehow into that agency to make certain I was okay. Well, you knew that any way I’m guessing?”
Moving his hand away, he discovers his reflection smirk back, folding their arms. Dean stumbles backwards and yelps in shock. The almost black olive eyes twinkle back in entertainment. “Such a disappointment, Dean,” The mirror Dean hissed at him like a hissing cobra. “You can’t even follow orders, and now you’re fucking trapped.”
Castiel looked up and smiled softly.
“Your dad killed your mom, but there is something not right. I can’t put my finger on it. He knows nothing about angels, yet he killed one. There are only three things that can kill an angel. Childbirth when they’re at their weakest. Poison apple from the very tree that Adam and Eve sinned from, and an angel blade.”
“Sorry, Mertha, but Adam, Charlie and I are having a food fight at suppertime.” Dean grinned cheekily at the angel.
“I have no clue, so long ago.” John laughed blasé about the encounter.
“Oh, I get it. Just be careful,” Adam told his new friend.
“Y-yes Dean.”
“Brother, you’re the light-bringer we need you.” Dean grinned and flew back to find his mate.
(See the end of the chapter for
Charlie was about to apologise when she heard a shriek and a tentacle coiled away from the dripping water from the bottle. Turning it around, it read saltwater.
“Yeah, it seems I lose everyone in my life.” Dean sighs sadly.
The boys go through the fence and make sure it’s put back; they check the garden. When no one is about, they come out of the bush that’s hidden by the trees. The boys split up after, and Dean goes and gets his water for the night. There is no water there, and he can’t find Mertha. Then he hears laughter, and the dicks have his drink. Shaking his head; who cares anyway?
“The sole person who knows about this book was Uncle Bobby, but he ain’t got this type of money unless he won the sweepstake.”
Dean nodded, wished they could be just an average couple. “Sure, okay, I need to consider this. He can’t feel me, can he?”
“I have lived in hell for many millennia, and like Chuck have a hatred for the Fates. Their only interest is to outsmart him, so they can win, to what end we have no idea. They have no care that humans will live or die — innocent animals, the plants and trees, even our brethren. The other Gods and Goddess are powerless to help. I have been searching, throughout my time in hell, and I found this object that no one has spoken about, not even in the oldest of texts."
“Never underestimate an angel or an angel’s mate. They won’t let their mate vanish just like that, and if someone touches you; well, I would loathe being that person.”
Charlie giggled. “Yeah, we had to set up additional security measures. We have a new angel called Ambriel greeting the newbies, and in here we have Janey. I met them there nice.”
“Don’t stop idjit, keep going,” yelled Bobby, firing off another round of salt pellets. Then throwing a bucket full of holy water at the pale face demon who smoked like he was on fire.
“Yeah, you know some commander of heaven, blah, blah.” Dean flicked his hands up, claiming nonchalance.
“Why should I, he killed mom, Uriel, and he killed me?” Dean screamed.
“Even the strongest of us, require someone to lean on Dean.”
Dean opened his eyes and jumped deeply into his mates’ fathomless blue eyes. “I don’t want you to be mad at me, Cas. Just my mind always seems to go there and…”
Dean stayed by Castiel’s side this time. The angel was not letting his hand go once. Dean spoke to his classmates and other angels. They all congratulated them on their engagement.
Castiel realised his lover was right, and he had never looked at that side of the story before. Dean made him reflect in a way no one else had ever done. His Dean would make a brilliant soldier in the angel’s army. A point he would change, omegas could fight. Presently only alphas and betas could join. Such nonsense, he scoffed at himself. His Dean had taken him out frequently at armed combat. The young Nephilim was getting stronger every day.
Charlie came through the doors and when she saw her mate, the commander and the doctor, it shocked her. “Am, am I in trouble?” the redhead shook.
Then he spotted his angel, his unruly black hair a mess. His breastplate was azure, and his tunic was bronze. The angel had gold stars on his shoulder to denote his high rank. He had black leather pants and brown ankle boots. His six black wings, shining from his back, flickering and flexing, and his three halos shone brilliantly. Dean looked down and saw the bee socks, and Castiel winked at him. Dean showed his Marvel socks, and he got a grin from the angel.
Sensing she would get nothing else out of the omega, she nodded, “Let me heal you first before you leave.”
P.S I love Charlie, still mad at them for killing her.
XxXxXxXx
It was like someone was trying to tune a radio, the air crackled and was disjointed. Several loud squeaks and pops flashed through his mind, and he had to put his hands over his ears, but that did not help. Then it was suddenly crystal clear, the music starting at a low timber. Then a crescendo of trumpets pure, sweet but with a deadly warning grew louder. War had broken out, the apocalypse had started, and they were needed, to save heaven and earth.
“What’s going on, son?”
Dean stood glaring at Castiel, his fists clenched by his sides. He moved as if to step forward, and Charlie seized his arm. Castiel turned his head and shook it lightly. The angel’s piercing blue eyes were boring into his skull. The omega closed his eyes and exhaled a single tear rolled down his freckled cheek.
The next day, Dean and Adam ran down to breakfast meeting Charlie.
“They made a deal with their angel mate. The family came into money. Though the angels have gone into hiding, and I guess the angels will seek retribution. We should punish Joel and Raz for their crimes.”
“Yeah, heads got a lump the size of an egg. I guess Kate’s unconscious. We need to get her away from this thing.” Harry croaked, coughing, taking the crisp air into his lungs.
Castiel opened his mouth and closed it, his cheeks going crimson.“You passed the first task, say nothing to Adam. Please take care of yourself this time around.”
“These nice police officers called Donna came to get me. She called mom’s family, but they did not want to know. Then I told them about Uncle Bobby, and they called him. I’ve not seen dad since Dean. I heard he had escaped with that Rook guy.” Sam shivered at the mere thought of the man.
“Joe saved Castiel’s life, Astra. I will always accept him into our nest; he’s a loyal friend.” Dean told the angel.
“I wish I could communicate with Castiel. I feel cut off here.” Dean hated the feeling of the oppressive dark, wanting to touch his mate.
“I will talk to Adam and let you deal with this; he’s a swift learner, Castiel.”
“That’s the truth. I gather father instructed you to stay away from him. Don’t you wonder why?”
“Arms up, baby.” Castiel benevolently instructs his lover.
“Dude, you’re like gold dust around here, were all lower class. There is only Adam that’s higher.” squeaks Charlie, who seems to bounce down a brilliantly lit corridor.
Dean could not hear what Castiel was shouting. Every word, barb and name slashed his skin, broke his bones, and tarnished his soul. The pain was worse than anything his dad at thrown at him. Dean had known his dad had hated him. It was far worse because he loved Castiel, so the words stung because the angel truly meant every word he was saying.
“Now, I want my kitchen tidy by lunchtime service, please.” the fact that Mertha who had been kind to Dean did not shout made it all that worse for him.
“Come on, let’s leave before the big bad comes,” Adam told his friend, wanting to protect his family the best he could.
“Thank you, Charlie, keep safe now.”
“I never thought,” Dean told his angel.
After lunch, Anna and Charlie appeared to pick him up, and they talked about what movie they could watch that night. They instructed Dean to stay in the chair for a couple of weeks. He could push himself, and Charlie said she would help. Pam had told him the intense healing took it out of the human body even if he were half-angel that part would not come to the surface just yet.
Dean’s first lesson on Monday was math, with a dark skin angel called Victorrie, but everybody called him Victor. The teacher gave him tests, finding he was at a college level, which pleased him. The next class was English. This time he did age-appropriate work, and they started on
“You sent John?” laughs Castiel, his entire frame shaking with mirth. “That won’t work, not now, not anymore.”
“He was a means to an end. I needed to get you out of the way. Once I got the money, your dad owed me; I could carry on the plans I had for Sammy. Feed him my blood, and he would be the next King of Hell.”
Anna held Charlie’s hand, and they both looked happy. “I’m overjoyed you have sorted everything out.”
Meanwhile, Castiel had scrambled towards Dean, hugging him securely. Like he had not seen him for months. He quenched his thirst like a man lost in the desert.
“I better.” Dean did not feel like it, but he ate what he could. His stomach was doing somersaults, his heart beating an intermittent rhythm in his chest. He hoped Charlie would find out what was going on soon.
“Don’t be, at least you can fix this.”
Dean felt bruised from the force of the push, but he stood and touched Castiel’s arm. “Baby, we need to know. I demand to know. Please stand down. He won’t hurt me. I have you to protect me, right?”
“I’m Adam, by the way.”
Dean got up and shakes the angel’s hand and leaves. The omega goes to his room and works on his body, building up his endurance. Meeting Charlie and Adam for lunch, telling his friends about his day.
“We will get the bastard. John won’t get away again on my watch. I must leave and get on with my work,”
“Oh, so that’s why they're banned? They don’t care about anything or anybody. How can we find this sire?”
“Slightly nervous. What if I move wrong?” Dean worries his lip between his teeth, but Castiel stops him.
“Joel and Raz, they tore me off the bridge and tripped me. I could not defend myself.” Dean told the angel, feeling stupid after all his training.
“Find me funny, do you angel?” spat the Fate, “I have your life in my hands.”
“Twins take your mates; we have enough angel’s moving the sick.”
Dean returned to his meticulous observations of the room. He observed two odd circles encasing the room. The omega traced one all the way back to the stone, which pointed to the west. The arrow was marking its intended target. The other still on the south, the entrance to the approach they had just come. One depicted all the Earth, from humanity, mountains, and various animals — the other described planets, stars, and galaxies.
Dean came down and wiped his forehead, a little spooked. “Thank you, sir; you saved me, I was helping Cal out.”
Thanks for your love, support and great comments xxx
Charlie’s green eyes flashed open and searched for Adam. “Deans worried we were talking to Cam.”
“Tomorrow, Batman’s taking me to his cave.” both boys chuckled.
Adam’s jaw dropped, and it shocked Charlie. “Have you learnt nothing in class? Dean angels only take omega mates. Angels worship omegas.”
Dean could not accept what had happened. That man was going to hurt him, and then he had no clue how the bus halted and how that man could not get up. It was like someone was sitting on him. He located a diner and raced in, grabbing a seat and ordering a burger and pie. Dean thought he deserved it after what had just happened.
“I will, son.” Crowley held out his hand, and Dean shook it.
The omega thought. Dean cried himself to sleep. When he woke from his nap, there was a black feather by his pillow.
“This is happening, Cas?” Dean whispered, hardly believing his eyes.
Adam, Joe, and Dean were still holding hands, and laughing with joy. The walls turned to all shades of the rainbow; it cooled down, where it was immensely hot and warmed up, where it was unduly cold. There was no sign of any shadow people, wisps, or tentacle monsters.
Castiel was for the better word pissed. That filth in the basement had sought an audience with his Dean. No way was he going to grant that. Yes, he had told Dean about it, in all goodness he could keep nothing from that boy. The look of panic and dread that crossed his face said it all.
“You to love.” In a flash, the demons vanished, and Dean shook his head. ‘
Michael stepped down, and everybody cheered. Gabriel stepped forward.
“My Star boy always so bright, you make me so happy, Dean. You’re my everything.”
Castiel heard all the whispers, they invaded his mind bounced around like a ball, wall to wall, never-ending but becoming louder and louder.
Both Joe and Gzrel stood at the entrance to the small library and guarded Charlie.
“At least my brother’s safe, Deanna as well. I hope to get back in contact with her. Uncle Bobby will watch Sam. I hope they don’t feel all three are some bargaining chip.”
“Not your fault Cas it’s his, you; should have a normal mate, not a big mess like me.” Dean spat out, meaning every word he spoke, his heart heavy with grief.
“Do you think he’s stupid enough to escape and come after you and Dean?” Hannah questioned incredulously.
Crowley pulled out an angel blade and gave it to Castiel.
The angels and the police officer followed and reached a small office near the lobby.
“You smell better.” laughed Charlie. “Let’s show them I can perform miracles.” she winked and grabbed her friend’s hand. Although she worried about Dean, the omega knew some of this was to do with Castiel.
Castiel screams inside his stomach in knots. Instead, he calmed down and rubbed his thumbs soothingly over his lover’s cheekbones.
It happened on one rainy Friday morning. The clouds overhead scurried across the grey, monotonous sky in a hurry like they were late for an important date. The rain fell like a fine mist, causing visibility to diminish sharply.
“You both are. I’ve watched you talk to that angel that’s been hanging around. He’s been speaking to my tormentors as well.”
Dean turned around to examine at the older girl. His forest green eyes were listless. Charlie noticed that his hair needed cutting, and she tenderly brushed it out of his eyes.
“Shit Cas you’re massive.” Dean gasped in shock and pleasant surprise.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m awesome.” She grinned.
Notes:
Castiel searched the room for a face in the crowd and called out for Joe. Reverting to English.
“Casss,” Dean whined, pouting.
The Wisp hummed a methodical tune, trying to reach the human omega. Charlie clamped her hands over her ears and shouted the prayer at the top of her voice.
“I did what anyone would do, treated the bitch with the back of my hand.”
“Keep with that focus dude, then you won’t get on the wrong side of your angel. The higher up they are in the pecking order, the stricter they are.”
“Yes, I can help with that. What angel?” the girl glanced at Dean with a beam on her face.
“Yes, brother.”
Castiel tried to swallow the lump in his throat. “I have wronged him; its time I put that right.”
“I have people helping on food,” Mertha checked down at her list.
Castiel turned around and faced the front. “I have an award to give out today. This person should have received it some months back, but fate changed our hands. The elders held a meeting and decided that not only as this omega helped his fellow agency mates. Going through a torrid past yet they could love, give charity, kindness and strength to others. They have passed more tests than any other and yet there only seventeen. This person helped us realise that we were doing it wrong, how we cared for our mates. We are now implementing different frameworks to make the agency a better place for you and other generations of omegas. I am proud to call Dean Winchester my mate. Dean, we present this new award to you; we will award it to other omegas after you and will bear your name. You’re a true inspiration to others.”
Dean got out of the car and walked down the dock, sitting down on some old crates and stared at the water. What was he going to do? It was one thing to do everything Crowley wanted, to work for hell, to fulfill his deal. Yes, it sucked big time. Dean wanted nothing more than to tear them all apart and shut the place down completely. In fact, his first few months Dean had killed way too many demons. If they so much as looked at him sideways or disagreed with anything Crowley said, Dean would fight and kill them. It had gotten so bad that Crowley put the stipulation of the “Dead Suit Only” rule in an attempt to stop Dean from killing all his followers.
Sorry again!
Dean grabbed his bottle and walked over to a table in the corner, putting his back to the wall. He made eye contact with a table of six demons and smirked at the hostile looks he received. The demons had made their hatred of Dean no secret, and now that Crowley instigated the dead meat suit only rule it had gotten worse. Whatever, Dean thought, rolling his eyes as they started trash talking, speaking loud enough to make sure Dean heard them.
“No!” Dean screamed. He scrambled along the walls trying to find a hidden trigger for some kind of door but there was nothing.  He was completely encased in stone.
Dream guy just laughed and stood up. He strolled around the stone room, his face twisted in distaste.
“Dad, don’t.”  Dean said squirming and trying to break John’s hold, but despite the age difference and Dean having filled out since the last time he saw John, John was still stronger and just he just tightened his arms.  Dean almost whimpered when he felt the hard length of John’s cock pressing against his ass.
“Okay, Dean. that’s okay. Work it with us as long as you can, yeah?” Sam said. He was rewarded with a shy grin from Dean at his words.
Dean’s heart started to race and hope blossomed in his chest.  Death would not say that unless he was very sure it was a very real possibility.  Tears sprang to Dean’s eyes.  “Thank you, but are you sure you want to give it to me and not someone you know, better?”  Dean asked.
Here you go.  Last chapter.  Nothing really triggering in this chapter.
Hold on, next chapter will be quite the ride.
“Dean, I don’t deserve you, I’ve made so many mistakes.  So I just left and tuned you out because you deserve better than me.  I stayed away and it hurt more than anything but…”  Cas trailed off.
Dream guy brought a hand up to touch Dean’s face and Dean immediately slapped it away, only for anger to morph Dream guy’s face into something twisted.
Sam felt cotton shoved in his mouth. “Okay bite down on that. Ready?” He heard, as fingers carded through his sweaty hair.
And Sam snorted in disgust.  “Dean we had eaten there twice the day before so yeah i didn’t want to go with you so what?”  Sam growled.
Drake had started right off with whipping Dean and then moved on to cutting up his chest and abdomen and his thighs.  Dean was weak and dizzy from losing blood and he shivered in the cold room.  Drake broke all of Dean’s toes and the jerking caused Dean’s left shoulder to dislocate.   He was hit with a bat and suffered multiple broken ribs and probably a broken collarbone too if the pain was any indication.  Drake lit a cigar and delighted in burning Dean over and over making Dean jerk away saying that he liked watching Dean dance.  Dean finally lost consciousness as Drake choked him to the point of passing out for the sixth time.
I am stoked that I have received so many kudos and comments (I apologize if it takes a while before I respond to the comments).  It has actually helped me finally push through the block I have had and I got the next chapter written.  So thank you all and please continue to send them my way.
the angel was definitely going to kill him, because Dean felt Cas' tongue push into his hole and more grace like sensations pulsed into him simultaneously opening him up.
“Is that why I feel like I’m being tugged in two different directions.” Dean asked.
Sam stared at his brother. He was scared, Sam would admit, at how Dean had pounded the other two men until they were only inches away from being splattered all over the cement. His brother was completely lost in the violence of beating them, and it took way too long for them to pull him back this time.
Thank you very much for kudos and comments.
Thank you, see you next week!
Nothing too triggering in this chapter except for angst, angst and more angst.  Please see end for notes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean nodded again. “I’m sorry, Sam. I couldn’t just leave you hurt like that.” Dean said, starting to explain his actions.
Crowley stared at Dean for a few more seconds before he turned and walked into the bathroom. Dean heard the water turn on.
Non-consensual drug use, John thinking about his plans to abuse Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean sighed and sunk into the embrace, his shaking finally stopping.  After a long pause, Dean looked up at him through his long lashes, his voice soft.  “How’s this going to work when my year is up, Crowley?”
So identify is still a secret.  Sorry (not sorry).  I rewrote this chapter so many times and eventually just cut it in half because I didn't want to give too much away.  I am curious as to who you all will think it is though.
I had a lot of fun writing the last part of the chapter and its one of my favorites.  I would love it if there were more fics out there showcasing the friendship between Dean and Death.
I know another cliff hanger, I'm so bad (evil grin).
“I’m so sorry.” Dean uttered and Crowley gave him a soft look. Dean turned toward his angel who was looking back at Dean, part furious, part resigned. “I love you.” Dean said again tears falling down his face, eyes drinking in the blue ignoring John’s growl of fury.
Dean was feeling weird.  Ever since his cuddling the other night — and geez Dean cannot believe he reached out to Crowley like that but now — Crowley had been acting weird.  He was colder and more professional with Dean and it was throwing Dean off. Crowley was usually the affectionate one, always wanting some kind of contact. Figures, though. Dean had a reason for closing himself off and not allowing himself to count on people, especially when it came to his feelings. Yet once again he acted the fool and was now getting slapped back for it.
Dean once again traded his life for Sam’s.
Dean intended to drive away and not stop until he reached the beach house. From there, he would try to figure out a way to deal with what he learned about his deal. It was better to go there then to be fetched back like a runaway child, but Dean still found himself turning down the first dirt road he came to, driving up the dock. He always loved this place, hidden from the road and therefore rarely ever used. Dean sometimes wondered when he came out here to think if the Men of Letters used it for some kind of supply drop or something.
“Cas!”  Dean yelped when he felt the angel's mouth cover one of his nipples and nibble slightly.  “Fuck, that's…  I wasn't hurt there.”  Dean whimpered, actually let go and whimpered, but he was too lost in sensation to be embarrassed now.
Cas and Sam locked Dean in the bunker afraid he would turn into a demon and hurt people.
Sam felt his adrenaline spike again and he almost reached back for his gun before Death threw back his head and gave a full on belly laugh.  Sam blinked at the sight.
“I figured.”  Death answered.  After a few minutes of silence where Death just stared at Dean, dread filled Dean up because it wasn’t like his friend to be hesitant about anything.
Misunderstands are cleared up. Dean makes a decision.
Dean slipped out of the room to go and get supplies.
Hi everyone, I hope everyone had a good week.  We are back with Dean in this chapter and lots of triggers here.  Its a bad one.  You can skip the first part and start reading at the page break if don't want to read the more graphic stuff and I will put a summary at the bottom.
Dean thought and looked at the time.  “Oh shit, it was almost 9 o’clock.” Dean swiftly got out of bed and saw a note on the table.  Sam had gone to meet with the sheriff as they had planned. He said he didn’t want to wake Dean or John and he would be back in a few hours.
Hi everyone I hope you all had a good week.  I actually got quite a bit of writing done so I pretty happy.  I still have a few more chapters to write and the rest to edit but I'm not so overwhelmed with what is left anymore.   I thank you once again for the kudos and comments as they really fuel my writing.
Triggers include references to non-con touching and drug use, violence and Dean's abandonment issues.
Crowley turned his face to the side to hide the guilty look that flashed across it before it could stop it. He just hummed a noncommittal reply and continued stroking Dean’s hair until the hunter dropped back into sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean's eyes rolled in the back of his head when the moist heat of the cloth was suddenly replaced with the moist heat of Cas' mouth as, oh fuck, the angel swallowed him whole in one go.  Dean was so on edge from the little healing kisses of grace, he didn't even get to warn Cas before he was having one of the most intense orgasms of his life.
The angel’s eyes narrowed. “Let me see your hand, please.” he requested.
Tears filled the younger boy’s forest green eyes. “Shit, Charlie; my dad’s escaped. Castiel is angry, I can feel it. He choked for air, feeling slightly nauseous.”
Castiel came strolling through the door and enveloped his mate into a tight embrace. “I have missed you love.”
“Olani hoath ol,” Dean whispered against his mates’ lips.
“Yes, you got it in one. Now, demons and humans. A demon like myself will chase after corrupted souls. Humans, they have free will, becoming manipulated by the seven deadly sins far too quickly. Humans do not have that metaphorical angel on their shoulder.”
“You don’t have to be involved,” Dean told the redhead.
Choirs: White
“So, John needed my mom out of the way. That’s why she died?”
“What about you guys?” Dean asked worriedly.
“You’re most welcome.” the angel went away, and Dean placed his textbook down and glanced at the letters. One was a silver and gold envelope, and one was plain white.
“We will watch him Castiel, but he will require therapy and only morning school for now. He needs rest and some tender care.”
“Cas?” Adam squeaked.
Kedi came closer to the omega he had sworn to protect. “I have informed the commander that they will require saltwater. A precaution should they encounter this beast. Boel and Karlel will unquestionably require some if they wish to accompany us.”
Castiel turned back around the corner and told the two Omegas to approach. Anna squealed when she saw Charlie and hugged her, glad to have her mate back in her arms once more.
“Family does not pray on their own and hurt one’s mate. It’s an outright assault on Cassie.”
“We won’t love. Come, we have this day let’s not waste it.”
“Anna, Tula, Michael, Gabriel, Maze, and Kedi are all watching out for us,” Adam explained to the table. “Michael told Cam to hide until this was over. Amber and Janey are staffing the front desk.”
“You may.”
Dean still had his hand around the talisman; it felt warm in his hand. He glanced down; it emitted a soft glow, so he let it hang, and the light became brighter. Dean smiled, yes, he thought, my friends always have my back.
The two boys hugged, reunited after so long. There was not a dry eye in the hotel at the endearing scene.
“If it were in my power to take you to our nest before graduation, I would, but I know my brother; he would not grant this. Anyway, it’s not long now, and we still have weekends.”
“Yes, I do. It will require altering, but it will be ready for graduation. What’s that you have in your pocket, young man?” Mertha wondered, intrigued.
Dean started sneaking out, doing odd jobs around the neighbourhood. He also found a different location to stash clothes in case something happened with Adam. Dean also thought about getting a bag and buying items for his travels, but not yet had time.
“What’s this for Cas?” Dean asked his angel.
“Dean if you come in-“
“Dean, can you explain why they called me here? Hugging another omega without their angels’ permission, you would learn that on your first day here. Or are you too stupid to take that in?” Castiel growled, his eyes were flashing red.
Pulling Dean back again, driving into him, he can feel his knot catch on Deans walls, feel them squeeze him. Dean puts his hand on Castiel’s chest, near his heart.
Further up they arrived at a large hall. It had another entrance to the back, and it enclosed the entire room in oak panelling, making it dark. The enemy was waiting, creatures of every description, imaginable. There were monsters with one eye, some with more, thin and fat — horns that curl wickedly on their heads. A fire gleamed in their eye sockets, some with faces missing, grubs eating flesh. Others had hands, others have hoofs, the same went for their feet. Their teeth sharp as raisers, laughing at their prey. Others even had wings, but they were spindly and made of bone.
Dean went up to the information desk where a short man stood, speaking to Hael. Dean stood near the desk waiting; not wishing to interrupt. Realising they were speaking in Enochian tuning into their conversation. The shorter man was telling the other angel a somewhat rude joke.
“Then don’t mate a child. Don’t mate an abuse victim and then leave them. You never healed me, yet you could see I was in pain. You don’t give a shit if I live or die, do you?” Dean was there one minute and gone the next.
“This is a different age, Mr Winchester. Not the dark ages. We treat everyone equally; we should treat no one different, from their age, disability, sexual orientation colour or designation — everyone as the right to live without fear of violence and to live with nutrition, health care, shelter and love. You have given nothing of this to your son. Dean’s had broken bones, scars and bruises on his body, and his mental health is at crisis levels. We will place your other son Samuel in to care.”
Jody was standing with Hannah. Both human, an angel, was anxious.
The second aim was for Castiel and Dean to get at the stone and see what that was all about. The lovers knew that it was essential and would have hell thrown at them. The minute the Fates had an inkling they were moving towards the stone.
The two omegas walk side by side, in the hustle and bustle of the mall. Dean pulled Mertha over to a small independent shop that was selling jewellery.
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CROW’S NEST – DAY
Dean looks at Sam, briefly, but Sam is no help-- he wants to know as much as Jack. Dean looks away, unwilling to tell the full truth right now.
A RUSTLING NOISE. When the Roadhouse Gang turns towards it, they see Jack has VANISHED.
In my experience, when faced with the void of one’s own demise, humans find solace in the idea of legacy. So let me comfort you with this; every single other world was a sacrifice made so that you might live freely. Every being in those other universes were just different programs that puttered around in different mazes. And every different iteration was created and destroyed for the sake of this world, with this version of you two. The Winchesters that achieved true consciousness. Well, with the help of the bug in the system.
Jack, look at me.
CASTIEL
BLACKOUT.
Then uncomplicate it for us.
Shall we?
We’re not going to wipe the world and make a different one. We’re going to rebuild this one exactly as it was.
--and opens his eyes again, as the darkness around him dissolves--
” by BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. Music runs quietly under dialogue.
When Dean and Cas get back, we can talk about this as a family. Alright?
Wait are you-- are you here-here? Or in my head? I thought I was your vessel.
CHUCK
CASTIEL
So, you’re the cool dad, huh?
For the first time in the scene, Michael’s eyes dart to his feet. The Empty FOLLOWS HIS GAZE-- to DEAN’S BODY.
Why the hell are you being such a jerk, Dean?
I don’t think we have a choice.
WOMAN
How d’you figure?
LUCIFER
TEASER
CLOSE ON CAS. Nothing but unshakeable faith in his eyes.
Dean swerves violently and a car honks at him as it passes.
MUSIC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
It’s-- the middle of the morning!
Castiel, Jack and Amara follow Jody out to the war room. Claire turns to look at Eileen.
Heaven needs a new code of law.
Well, I’d definitely want to kill the Empty...
I forgive you, Dean.
So, he and-- Eileen-- they’re going to try and help people. Band the hunters together as best they can, and learn from the mistakes of the British Men of Letters.
I’m not drunk. I don’t get drunk.
I go by that name, yes.
What do you mean?
(off Jack’s confused look)
On that grim note, Jack turns to look out the side window.
Oh, come on. We really starting this again? Just-- let’s go talk to the sheriff before he calls it for the day.
Would you like to be reincarnated, ascend to Heaven, or go back to the lives you had before?
Rowena and Crowley exchange a glance.
Castiel looked over and saw the garrison spill into the circular room. “Whatever happens, my love, know this, you four are the heroes of the hour. You saved us, we will be forever in your debt. But you, my omega are the one, that shall perch on a golden chair, and I will bow down to your every command. Well, within reason.” Castiel smirked and winked at his young mate.
The next morning Dean came downstairs to find Michael waiting for him, but no Adam. Dean searched around for his friend and knitted his brows together. “Michael is Adam okay?”
Dean got his best black jeans out and pulled a white tee-shirt over his head. Over that he put a green button-down on. Dean wore his leather bracelet and his star pendant. Castiel had changed into jeans and a white dress shirt and a blue jumper.
“Casss,” Dean whined and linked his fingers with his angel.
“Adam, why did you not tell us? Now everyone hates you,” grumbled Dean, shocked at the admission.
“I have foretold the apocalypse in every culture on this planet since the world began. The book of revelations is one book of the bible that has it correct. Well, part right, it speaks of stars and angels. This is the two of you. You’re in this plan so you can stop the Fates. There is no battle of an evil creature; it’s the humans that are doing this to the planet I created. They have pillaged and killed, themselves, and animals. The seas are rising, and the air polluted. The Fates want the humans gone, eradicated. They want hell on earth and nothing left but themselves.”
“Lucifer’s correct, I shall ask him.”
Weapons of mass destruction evaporated. All the ocean levels settled. The rubbish in the oceans was no longer choking it to death: no greedy politicians, no wars, no hate, or greed. The earth cleaned. The light hit every known person in the world, young, old, rich, or poor, the end of days had started. Everyone was equal, all humans bleed the same way no matter who or what they are after all.
Next to that was a substantial open-plan kitchen. The cabinets when made of beechwood and all modern appliances were secretly stashed elsewhere. A huge island sat in the middle of the kitchen, filled to the brim with cooking paraphernalia. Large windows let in light, and a door led to a wooden deck. A narrow oval table with four chairs stood near the window, so you could admire the view while you ate. The floors were wooden but mismatched in colour.
“Well, that’s an enigma,” Mertha said puzzled.
“Now, come and sit and tell us about your adventures. We need a rest; it looks like you do to?”
“Jeez, Cassie, enough.” the archangel grinned, blushing at the compliment.
“Yeah, nervous.” Dean chuckled.
Dean came to his mate’s defence right away. “Cas has been there for me, Mertha just…”
Adam, Joe and Harry rolled their eyes, muttering girls under their breath.
“Thank you, thank you Cas.” Dean sniffed, kissing his angel on the cheek. The omega looked around and turned red. “Whoops, sorry commander.”
“Oh, Dean, if only life was that simple. Now, sit down. Castiel, please stop growling. I won’t go near your mate.”
“We stand here the amalgamation of two cultures to bring together two lovers, so exceedingly different yet very much the same. First, we will bless the rings.” Michael brought a large red leather-bound book from the table behind him. The archangel opened it, treating the paper with gentle fingers. “Samuel, will you place the ring for Dean on the book?”
Dean finally gets sorted with lessons. Meeting Charlie, he happens upon some new kids and gets help from Adam.
“Sometimes yes, sometimes no. When I can’t get time off, I will get someone I trust to spend time with you.”
“Got it in one.” It pleased Crowley that the omega got it. “Demons like myself, we can’t make a human evil, though we can possess them. It’s rare, and only those of my kin that are so twisted that they have gone utterly insane. The humans come to me. They know it’s wrong but care little for it.”
“So, Adam, best be going, how do I get up to the room?”
After what seemed like hours of fruitless explorations, Castiel comes to a large food hall. On the platform, there was, he assumes, teachers talking away eagerly. Teens from the manner of their age remain in groups on tables that stretched the length of the hall. They seemed to eat a midday meal and messing about, but the teachers sat on the platform playing them no mind.
They hiked for what seemed like hours; the omegas growing weary, but the angels did not waver in their march to the room. Replenishing water for the furious fires made them thirsty. Taking in nutrition while they could in the nuts and fruits that were in their wrist bags. Everyone was anxious, no one spoke. All they could hear was the scrape and clip of feet along the narrow, stone corridors.
Felice pushed her way forward. “I suggest you back down now.” The angel growled, her eyes aflame with grace.
“I will see you topside soon, Dean?”
“This is not your fault, Gabriel. I need to check in his room to see if I can sense anything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have a theory that he’s of Star lineage,” Gabriel told his younger brother.
“No, Mr Winchester, you signed Dean over to us we own him now.” Hannah smiled at him. Oh, so sweet.
“You can bring my mom back? And help me kill the sick bastard that took her from me?” Dean asks the demon called Lucy, who was in charge.

“Sorry, you can stop now, it’s dead.”
“Sure, Gabe, I can.” Heal began tapping away at the keyboard.
“I can’t,” Castiel grumbled bitterly.
“Well, Dean, it’s nice to meet you.” beamed Jimmy, who was fiddling with the radio. “Let’s put some music on.”
Castiel smiled, but it was chilling, sending shivers down John’s spine.
“Lonely! Dean, we control this place. Our angels run heaven, for lord’s sake. Start acting like it, or when you get out of here, you won’t survive out in the actual world.”
“Yeah, the only time we get to see them is at group gatherings or balls and shows. I need to learn how to be polite and interact with them. I don’t want to show Anna up, but we will have more freedom than you or Adam.”
“Thanks, girls for tending to me,”
“That’s easy, Dean. Angels are extremely protective of their fledgelings. If John had a nefarious reason for wanting to harm you or use you, she would have killed him.” Crowley told the omega.
“Leave it alone, Dean; you will wreck it.” complained the angel.
“Eat up I made an omelette with mushrooms,” Charlie told him. “There is toast and hot chocolate?”
The boys nodded their head, liking that idea.
“Sixteen. Why?”
“What! I have never heard of such a thing. You lie.” the demon hissed like a demented snake.

Thank you for your amazing comments.
Dean opens his mouth in a silent scream, his body going rigid. His hand glued to Castiel’s chest. Castiel shouts out in pain and both blackout.
Castiel kissed and nipped down the boys, neck and sucked a mark into his collarbone, inciting another delicious moan from the omega. Castiel nibbled the sensitive spot on the throat between the jawline. He licked and sucked on the flawless, untouched skin. Remembering to lavish his tongue on those freckles that looked like the constellations in the night’s sky.
“I just need to sleep.” Dean yawned aloud.
“B-but you’re like God, dude. Don’t you know anything?” Dean spluttered in shock.
The angels rushed to Dean’s room and searched around. The closet door was swinging open, and the room was a mess. The cameras altered, and his computer was perching on the couch.
Castiel could barely see, his eyes, raining with tears, holding Dean firmly in his arms.
Dean does some jobs and meets an old man whos lonely. The old man's neighbour saves him from a fall and gives him another job. But who is this neighbour that saved Dean?
Dean stood up abruptly. “I need a shower, are you coming Adam?”
Castiel glanced over at the omega who was peering down into the hole which was five hundred and fifty foot deep. The snow was resting lightly on his thick eyelashes and settling on his hair. “I realise now that this is about you. Dean, they brought you into the agency, thrust on me, then ran from me twice, and that’s very telling. So, I’m giving you an out. Walk away, you will still have our support. Live with Sammy and Uncle Bobby. Go to school, chase your dreams. I know you can make it, for I have complete faith in your abilities.”
Cam had no clue that Castiel had not mated Dean. After all, the youngster carried his mark and now his ring. So, he picked Dean up from the kitchen. They had not informed the angel that he could not enter the den.
Castiel took a deliberate step back and narrowed his eyes. “I understand, we best find them then. We require the back-up.”
“Yes, Cas, I want all of you. I’ve never done this before.” Dean said shyly and apprehensively.
“Hannah, there was an incident this morning, Dean’s missing, and we suspect he left out of the front door.”
Their main aim was to neutralise the demons, this way they could not spill on earth and start attacking the humans. They needed to make sure they were safe. The fight for heaven and earth would begin, and the people they needed to save could block their efforts.
“I will see what I can do about that. Why don’t you have a wash, and we can get lunch? I hear you’re quite the cook.”
“Charlie, there out to get me,” he yells thinking he’s whispering.
Castiel closes his mind for a split-second, letting her babble on. Knowing their link was now open. He can hear Dean scream his dad’s name over and over.
Castiel swallowed, and his hands shook. “This belonged to Lofiel, and the one Dean’s got belonged to Dina. They will remember Mary and my sisters for there bravery,”
“I’m not your son,” Dean told the man in front of him, standing their rain dripping off him, arms folded.
“Take Dean; he’s in heat. I need you to care for him. Please, Anna.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes and huffed, but stood down. “Chuck, you dare come into my nest after we’ve just mated? Do you have a death wish?”
“Castiel can’t see you, so I’m passing on the message. Level three of the angel tests is about stepping away from a situation. Even though you could have employed force yesterday, you refrained.”
Dean’s eyes lit up in joy. “It came.”
“So, touching, but this ends now.” Her eyes lit up, diamonds twinkling, catching Castiel’s attention, and he went still, lost in her enchanting gaze. The Fate lifted the blade, and with all her might drilled it into the angel’s heart.
“It petrified me, on my first day. I don’t know him well, but we had become friends. I had no clue about his past but sensed they had harmed Dean.” Castiel nodded, and Charlie sighed. “I know one thing, people underestimate Dean, he’s got brains, and if I know him, he will head right for the front door. Look in trash bins or plant pots for his lanyard.”
“I dare you to kiss me.” Flynn winked back, knowing full well Castiel was in the room watching.
The next morning Dean had a shower, changed his clothes and went to find a diner. Knowing when he got into the city, he would need to find a laundromat he had run out of clean clothes. Eating a plate of waffles and bacon, he gobbled it up fast and rushed to catch his bus. Sitting at the back minding his business, reading his book, the journey was only an hour and a half.
Dean thought to himself. He saw a boy who sat with his feet up on another chair, reading twilight? Dean thought less of him for that. He had short brown hair and a long nose. He looked at him and narrowed his eyes.
“Cassie, it’s time to celebrate, and I want to try your cake.” Dean giggled at the delighted look on his friend’s face.
Castiel realises that he had this all wrong, this test was all about Dean all along. Is it too late to get his lover back? Dean flys away, but he finds his angel, and falls, will Castiel save him in time?
“The problem we have, is John can’t die, not until we find who sired him.” Crowley voiced.
“God, Sammy, it’s so good to see you.”
“The quest my garrison was on, it was all for nothing; fake. I even had to send for Anna, to live by the coast. Why did father want Dean to be alone? Get Charlie out of the way? Then I hear again that my mate was the target of the bullies from Pam and Camael. They hurt him, Gabe.”
Charlie squealed, and Dean grinned, clapping and hooting. Kevin walked passed Dean and winked at him. The younger boy glanced over at Castiel, and he was frowning at him, but he had no clue why.
“Yeah. I have a choice. I can do nothing, and the world goes to hell. I figure out if Castiel is truly the angel they want…”
Dean felt something touch him on the shoulder; his heart thumped quicker, adrenaline buzzing through his veins. “Who’s there?” he hollered, searching around but finding no answers. An evil cackle rang out; it echoed off the walls. Then Dean saw, from the corner of his eye, a flickering dark, human silhouette.
Dean and Castiel looked at Bobby to see what the older man’s reaction more-so than Sam’s would be.
“You two need to lay your hands on her, finish this.” He ordered them.
“Okay, guys, I need to piss Castiel off. It’s a test for him, like from God himself. We can’t tell anyone, they will stop you. So, walk away now.” Dean peered around, but everybody remained.
“Dean, before I call Cassie, I want you to know.” lifting Dean’s arm, she rubbed at his wrists gently. “that you can come to any of us. Something is coming. I feel the dark shadows of hell’s fingers tugging at me. You must know the truth because they will bend your mind, use your pain, twist it and spew you out. We, love you Dean, would die for you, recognise this, as the absolute truth.”

The old lady glanced at him and nodded. “Well, I’m going to Kansas City. You can get a bus from there. Stay with me tonight?”
Dean understood. “They have no, filter. I mean, you have good in humanity. But consider Hitler. All those poor people he killed. He could have stopped it, but his hatred drove him on, and if he had a devil on his shoulder.” Something clicked inside of him, and he realised something. “Hitler, he was a Necrophile?”
Castiel swallowed hard, but the car stopped, and the chauffeur opened the door. Cameras clicked and flashed, and he placed on a fake smile on his face. Dean stood beside him, looking so lost he felt distressed for the boy. Twining their fingers together, he turned his mate around.
“Well, someone had to.” the angel realised what she had just said and gone red in the face.
No, I have not done that?” The question puzzled Castiel.
“Let’s play in the computer room,” suggested Charlie. “The winged monkeys are not around, so let’s have fun while we can.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean knew the threat was an empty one, and he wished the angels a pleasant evening. Dean could not wait to get up to his room and look at the ring. Opening the door, he pulled the velvet box from its red home. The little box opened with a creek and Dean stared at it with awe.
Charlie sighs. “the commander has gone on a trip to heaven no clue when he’s back, there is no one to notice.”
Mallory picked up along twine of string from her bag, and pulled it, leering at the mated pair by the wall. Her long silvery hair hung loosely, kissing her shoulders. The creature’s powder-white face, stark with her black lips, and diamond silver eyes. She wore an ankle-length black dress with a thick brown belt around her waist with the infinity symbol entwined into it. Dean became mesmerised at how her eyes sparkled and caught the light in the bright room.
Castiel wondered to the pile of ash that was knee height. The angel noticed a glimmer from one stalagmite, protruding from the floor nearby. Curious, he ambled over. One pillar had a shiny stone sitting on the top. The angel wondered how the giant fingers of calcite formed because he could see no evidence of dripping water. The cave was neither hot nor cold, just the strange blue hue that looked like it was pulsing with energy.
“Following father’s orders is the respectful way, brother; he says we are to find human mates if we can’t find angelic.”
Just as Joe and Adam walked out of the library, iron bars slid down, trapping Charlie and Gzrel.
“Dean, you need food, a shower and a change of clothes.”
Charlie had her hand over her mouth with tears streaming down her face. “That’s simply beautiful commander.” She whispered, not wanting to break the magic of the moment.
“Was okay. The movie theatre is having a superhero’s week, this coming week, so looking forward to that.” Charlie grinned and clapped her hands.
“I’m fine thanks for asking,” Dean told the demon.
Castiel kissed Dean’s eyelids closed, and he steadied himself, leaning on his arm. Placing his right hand over Deans left bicep. Castiel breathed in, although he did not require oxygen. His grace flowed through him in gentle, light blue pulses. The shimmering light of his grace lit up the room like a thousand stars, assembling on one spot. The intensity he could see burning, raising his handprint his mark on to his mate’s skin. Showing the universe who had laid claim to this beautiful boy beneath him.
“You boys say goodbye, and we will come back when all this mess is over.”
Dean packed most of his clothes, and a few items he had gathered over the time he had spent at the agency, leaving behind a few pieces like a toothbrush. Castiel carried a couple of boxes down; the angel also had a suitcase and a backpack on his back.
Then he searched for a generous bathroom. The shower could hold five people. He was positive of it. Mosaic tiles covered the room in blues and greens as they twisted together, making it look like the undulating sea. There was a spa bath, never having one before he looked forward to sampling it. It could fit two fully grown men; he wondered if the angel would want to bathe with him. The sinks were his and his, and the cupboards whitewashed. They stored everything you ever needed inside them.
“Huh sure does. So, have you talked to Castiel about rules and whatnot?”
Lucifer comes to visit and tells Dean and Castiel a possible way to end the war. Castiel plans the routes into hell, and Dean and his fellow omegas get ready in other ways.
