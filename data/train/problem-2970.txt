It's loud. Not loud like a jet engine, or loud like a thunderstorm. Loud like silence. Loud like the moment after you say something you wish you could take back. Loud like being deep enough underwater that you wonder if you'll ever be able to surface.
"I love you, Cas. I always have. I have loved you so much that it scares me. I love you, and I want to have you, but more than anything, I want you to be here. So please...please be here."
They all wait, and the silence is as loud as that of the Empty.
All Dean can do is hurt people.
"I, uh, didn't think you'd remember," Dean stammers.
"Ooh, this place really is creepy," pipes a young voice.
"No! No, that's not what I meant! I mean, I don't think I can keep hunting," Dean blurts out.
They had only just met, and they were already fighting about God and faith in Bobby's kitchen like they'd been doing it for years. Dean expected a stern rejoinder, perhaps even a violent response. But Cas just held his palms up to Dean in a shockingly human gesture of "okay, okay, fine, I won't push it."
He lets himself fall.
Dean takes a shaky breath and tries again. "Cas," he murmurs. "I don't know if you can hear me. God, I hope you can hear me. You always could before."
"Hey, Cas," Dean murmurs. "I love you."
Jack stares at Dean for a moment too long, and it tugs at Dean's heartstrings a little more than he'd like to admit. He's so much like his dad.
"Cas, I don't know if I can do this anymore," Dean confesses. Cas' stomach drops to somewhere between the fourth and fifth circles of hell. His face must show it too, because Dean's eyes widen in horror.
Nothing happens. But unlike last time, when he had plunged into panic, Dean remains steady. He waits, just breathing, noticing the expansion and contraction of his chest, finally unburdened of its deepest secret truth.
"Cas, I'm going to find you. Just hold on."
Time stretches oddly in the hushed dark of the windowless hospital room. But a knock on the door breaks the spell. Cas clears his throat. "Yes?" he calls out.
"I'm sure he would be," Billie says, "if he were alive. How's it feel to have killed him? And after all those nice things he said about you..."
"Cas," Dean repeats, but it's pure, unadulterated relief this time. He squeezes Cas' hand back, drawing in a great shuddering breath before releasing it in choppy waves. The gust of his breath seems to clear the last of the fog hovering around Cas' head. Cas can see Dean's forehead drop to the bed beside their clasped hands, as he begins to let the weight of his worry go. Rather than speaking, Cas just grasps Dean's hand tighter. They've always been good at reading each other like this, and Cas knows that Dean has a hard time saying what he feels on a normal day. At times like this, when Dean is so completely overwhelmed by his feelings, he can hardly speak at all. Cas knows Dean will talk when he's ready.
Cas squeezes Dean's fingers gently, and Dean shifts into view, no longer a shade amongst shadows. He's perched on the edge of an uncomfortable-looking plastic chair, back hunched, shoulders curling inward. His face is gaunt, a little too pale even in the colorless room. His eyes are heavy, with deep shadows hollowing them out from below. He looks like he hasn't slept in days, and Cas realizes he probably hasn't.
Dean has been struggling desperately against the current for the past few days. This is what finally makes him let go, with neither rage nor hope to cling to. He averts his eyes downward, trying to focus on anchoring his feet to the earth. Knowing this is a battle he cannot win, Dean still tries to resist being swept away by the powerful waves of loss and grief that crash over him.
He still doesn't know what he's doing, but Dean at least knows where he's going. Pontiac, Illinois. It didn't come back to him immediately, but after skimming a few maps the inconspicuous little city had flashed at him like a beacon. He drives the Impala east out of Lebanon, pressing the gas pedal down further and further, racing his car almost as fast as his heart.
He's not expecting everyone.
"Yes, Dean, it's okay." God, Cas loves him and his profoundly thick skull.
Dean tips his head back to rest on the top of the seat, looking up toward the ceiling. It feels like a way to keep his head above water. He tries to breathe deep, but his breaths are stilted and ragged. His chest feels too small. He is again reminded of the feeling of Billie clutching his heart, crushing it with her fingers and puncturing it with nails like knives.
A faint smile pulls at the corner of Cas' mouth. "I always do," he murmurs. Dean squeezes his hand tightly, as if to remind himself that Cas is right.
Dean's dropping to Cas' other side before he even realizes he's moved. He presses his right hand to Cas' left shoulder, his left hand to Cas' cheek. He's so cold.
It's easy, Cas thinks, just being here like this. It's never been this easy.
He didn't save Cas.
"Wait," he says. "Please, don't go. Don't leave."
"And it isn't about you. Well, it is," Dean is full-on babbling now. "But if you want to keep going, you can, you can do whatever you want, but I think it's time for me to retire. For me. And for you. And for us."
Cas stares right through Dean. He doesn't blink.
"What?" Chuck stammers in horror and confusion. Dean stops, turns.
Dean just keeps walking.
It's all he's ever wanted.
Dean feels like he's drowning. His emotions, his memories, the things he couldn't say are crashing in and around him, battering the dam he constructed long ago to protect himself. He throws himself into old patterns again. Saving the world is always a good distraction. But when he meets Chuck, the storm surges.
Jack looks away from Dean as he takes a deep inhale. "It's my fault we're here."
He keeps going.
He thinks about how he's treated those closest to him. About the ways he's hurt Sam, and Jack, and Cas. He thinks about everyone he failed to protect. People have been sent downstairs for less.
"Hey ladies, how you doin?" Dean asks. "Love what you've done with the place." He throws on his cheesiest, flirtiest grin, and receives identical scowls in return.
anymore, but he's going to make damn sure that he has control over his existence. He can do what he's always done. Protect Sam. Help others. And he can do what he failed to do. Bring Cas back.
It was what he was supposed to do, and now Dean is dying young and pointless, and Cas is still rotting in the Empty. And it's Dean's fault.
He would make Dean pull over as they were driving through one middle of nowhere from a different middle of nowhere. Sam would sleep in the backseat, and Cas would ride up front with Dean to keep him company. He'd make sure Dean was staying awake, change out cassettes when they needed something new, watch the sides of the road for any animals fixin' to become roadkill. Mostly, they just rode in a shared, comfortable silence. But some nights Cas would crane his neck around, stick his head out the window and gaze up at the sky, before announcing that there were excellent stargazing conditions. He'd stare at Dean solemnly as he delivered the news, as if it was just an important fact Dean needed to know. But Dean knew that if Cas was saying it, he needed to find a pullout to park the car.
"Yeah, it kinda gives me the creeps," adds a tall, dark-haired woman, shining her flashlight into a corner.
surges in his chest again as he trails his fingertips down the sleeve, grips tight at the wrist.
at the end of the sentence is tangible.
Cas is dead because of Dean, and Dean never got to tell him he loved him too.
Stripped down to his core, Dean Winchester is love.
"Cas," he repeats, louder, more desperate. Cas still doesn't move, doesn't look at him. He stands straight-backed and rigid, gazing straight in front of him and looking right through Dean.
"Oh. You mean it," Cas realizes aloud, and of course he believes Dean, of course he trusts him, but it's a lot for Cas to process. "Dean, you know I have a concussion, right?"
After a few steps, or a few hundred miles, the darkness becomes less dark. The shadows gain more definition. Holding a hand in front of his face, Dean can almost see its outline.
But she remembers his.
Dean misses him so badly. Loves him so fiercely. It makes his chest ache. And that feeling makes Dean take stock of his...not body. Form? He can see and hear, but that's about it for his senses. Temperature isn't a thing anymore. Nor are hunger, thirst, tiredness. His lungs can expand and contract as if he's breathing, but it's more muscle memory than anything.
He reads.
For the first time since Cas woke up, Dean pulls his hand away, and Cas fears he's done something horribly wrong. Dean turns around, reaching behind his chair to rummage in his duffel bag, which Cas hadn't noticed until now. When he turns back to Cas, there's a small box in his hands.
He reads.
Okay, Dean thinks. Disney-style it is.
The sigils on the barn's interior walls are faded and peeling. Dean's boots crunch over broken glass, the remnants of the storm that was Castiel. He remembers the literal electricity in the air as the lights exploded overhead, and can't shake the feeling that it's still buzzing around him.
Crack.
Dean's a ghost.
And Dean
Standing now, Dean is acutely aware of the absence of the solid earth that was supporting him. His thoughts are swirling around him, crashing over him, threatening to drag him back under. Like sneaker waves, they catch onto his ankles and pull at his knees.
"But why haven't they checked in? They should be here by now," Burt says, louder, glaring at Jamie.
It's all Cas ever wanted.
Cas runs his thumb up and down the back of Dean's hand, which is the only part of him Cas can reach. He tries to reflect back to Dean the soothing energy Dean is bringing him. Dean's breathing is more even now, and after a long moment he picks his head up and looks into Cas' eyes.
"See you soon. Be safe."
"Cas?" Dean says softly, as if he's afraid to spook him. There's a tiny glimmer of hope in his low voice.
Dean has loved Cas for a long time. But he's been ignoring his feelings for even longer.
For one brief, bitter second, he thinks about how disappointed John would be. But then he remembers standing in the kitchen of his childhood home years ago, staring the ghost of his mother in the face. She was beautiful and terrifying, a dream and a nightmare. She saved him and Sam that day because she stayed. She made the right choice. Dean hopes that he did too. He hopes it was for the right reasons.
He can do it, but he won't.
Dean loves him. He knows, he's always known, but he's never felt it like he has in this moment. His shoulder tingles, the ghost of Cas' handprint crackling across his skin.
It's empty. Cleaned out except for the furniture, reminiscent of every cheap, bare-bones motel room of their childhood.
Yeah, screw that.
"Yep, chock full of 'em," says the third voice sarcastically.
Dean watches as they explore the bunker, careful to stay out of contact range. Appearing satisfied with the warding, they eventually return to the War Room and set up sleeping bags on the floor.
Jack raises his hand again, gives a single wave of his fingers, and turns away. He walks a few paces before dissolving into light.
Sam turns, and leaves the bunker.
"Him." "How?" "Hide."
Jack is waiting for them inside, but Dean walks past him without making eye contact. Dean's every instinct is screaming at him to stop being so selfish, to put his stupid problems aside and sit down with Jack and Sam to figure out a plan. But for once, Dean ignores his obligation to protect, to defend. The others will only remind him of the absence. He hears their voices from far away, and he can't bring himself to care about what they're saying about him.
"Whoa, girl, easy, it's just me," Dean says, squatting down and reaching a hand out towards her. She backs away, closer to Sam, who reaches down to stroke her back.
Once he's sobered up, they hit the road, looking for whatever presence Jack is feeling out there. It's simple. Saving people, hunting things. It feels like he's on autopilot. Back to normal. Nothing to see here.
"And in return?"
A blond man with round glasses pipes up, voice quavering. "It looks like no one has been here for a long time," he says nervously.
To find Cas, Dean needs to remember the beginning. Whatever that means.
Someone tries the doorknob.
Dean tries to put everything he has into his next few words. "Please," he says  "Help."
He opens his eyes to a soft, watery light, like a new moon. Above him, he can feel trillions of glittering stars and shining galaxies. He looks down, and Cas is there. It's not the Cas that Chuck showed him, it's the real him, lying outstretched on his back, motionless, eyes closed.
Help.
He's trapped.
Dean is still for a long, long time.
"Keep him safe," she whispers.
It really was that simple, wasn't it? Cas had sacrificed his own heart rather than let Billie take Dean's.
There's Lucifer, and a reaper, and there's an archangel fight, and Dean can't bring himself to care about anything except ending Chuck. Sam and Jack craft a plan, and Dean allows himself to be swept along by them. He'll be a good little soldier and do his part, and then he'll have his revenge.
They leave the next day. Their friends never show up.
He can't remember her name.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You can't be se-"
God, he's an idiot.
Or not.
This has been mostly canon-compliant (or at least canon-adjacent) so far but that ends here, because obviously nothing happened after that final scene where Jack walked away. That was the end of the show! We didn't see anything after that!
The second voice is still frightened. "Did he say anything about ghosts?"
Dean's voice wobbles on the last phrase, and he takes another long pause. He runs his left hand down his face, from his forehead over his downturned eyes, stopping at his mouth, where he clenches it into a fist.
Jack is...something, now. He brings the people back. He even brings the dog back. Sam is way too interested in the lore of it all, asking about Chuck and Amara. Dean isn't really listening.
Sam's right in front of him, but it's getting harder to see him. For a second, it appears as if Sam is getting swallowed up by darkness, just like Cas.
He finds them on the lower level. They shouldn't be there. No one should be there.
A week after the hunters' arrival, Dean is getting desperate. From their conversations, Dean has learned that these three are on the run from an organized gang of demons out in Wyoming. They're hoping the other half of their band will join them soon, as they had promised to rendezvous at the bunker. Dean knows they won't stay forever. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Cas left him.
Dean imagines Cas' face when Dean tells him he loves him too, and he's overwhelmed by a rush of quiet joy.
Dean flashes a real, genuine smile at Sam, and he can't remember the last time he did. Sam's face smooths into a look of mere concern as he waits for Dean to explain.
"Dean, I'm not coming back home," Jack states. His clinical tone is at odds with his words, which smack Dean across the face. "In a way, I'm already there."
He doesn't know where he's going, but he'll be safe wherever Cas is.
"Everywhere," Jack says with a little shrug. And Dean loses the conversation for a moment, just staring at Jack. Everywhere? How could anywhere be better than at home, with your family? Dean remembers how it felt when Sam left for Stanford. When Cas left. When he made Cas leave. And he's so angry at himself, so angry that he believed he might finally, finally get to live the way he always wanted, that Dean lashes out.
Minus the happy ending.
He hears something that he thinks might be his name. He's not sure. Is it his name anymore? Is he the same person he was before Cas was gone?
Until Dylan pulls open his closet door, and Dean feels his tether to the earth, stronger than he's felt in ages. Dylan is brushing his hands over the clothes, nearing the handprint jacket, when Dean shouts, "No!"
Nothing worked. Figures.
But something doesn't seem right.
Their hands are clasped so tightly that they should be losing circulation, but it just feels warm, secure, like a promise. They won't let go. They have before - sometimes by choice, sometimes by accident - but never again.
Goodbye canon, hello the happy ending they deserved. It's ridiculous! It's cliché! It's tooth-rottingly sweet! I'm not sorry!
They all step into Dean's room, turning their flashlights' gazes onto its dusty contents. They pause on the smashed beer bottles, the cracks in the walls, the piles of dusty papers.
Then, she nods.
"Yes," Jack confirms. "Dean, do you remember how we got here?"
Light floods the bunker.
But Cas says, "I'm here, I'm hurt, can you let me in?" and Dean doesn't need feelings to tell him what to do as he sprints up the stairs and wrenches open the door.
Every angel. Every demon. They stretch out far beyond Dean's range of vision, disappearing into the darkness. He can recognize a few faces at the front of the pack, and he certainly knows the leaders of the welcome wagon: Meg and Billie. There are a few faces missing, though. And that's promising.
And suddenly, he remembers.
Smack.
"Jack," Dean says, wonderment shining on his face, "We found him. We got him back."
"Sam's gone," she continues, and Dean starts to crumble.
"Dean," Cas works across his tongue, which feels too heavy for his mouth. "Did I-?"
Neither of them knows what they want to do next. They talk about their future until Cas gets tired. Before he drifts off, he makes Dean swear to him that he will sleep too. Dean agrees, and when Cas wakes, Dean has adjusted his chair so that he can rest his head on Cas' left arm, where he's sleeping soundly. Cas smiles as he closes his eyes and returns to a comfortable sleep.
Most days, Dean doubts whether he's a good person. Most days, Dean doesn't think he's ever deserved to be saved.
Black like the Empty.
That one hits him, and Dean starts to sway. Sam slings an arm around Dean's waist and turns them toward the Impala, half-dragging, half-carrying Dean. He carefully seats Dean in the passenger seat, finds the keys, starts driving away.
Dean pulls on the jacket. Still kneeling, he clasps his hands together and closes his eyes.
Stepping softly, Dean makes his way to the back of the barn. Something catches the beam of his flashlight near the ceiling. Dean looks up and sees, in the back left corner of the barn, one lamp with a single, intact lightbulb. The lamp sways gently in the night breeze drifting through the patchy roof.
"See, Jack here told me that the Empty got loud. I have a feeling he kicked that off, but it's still loud in here. Everyone is awake. In fact, the only ones gettin' any sleep around here have been the three of us," Dean says, tipping his head towards Jack as he finishes.
There's so much he's forgotten.
I've been thinking about the scene with Chuck in 15x19, the one where crew members could hear Dean crying out for Cas from streets away. I was thinking, what if that was an almost-reunion, like the Lucifer prank call? So I wrote what I think happened there, and then I got really carried away.
"I love you."
Dean lets his heart choose. For once, he listens.
Sam's leaving.
"Dean, you're not serious. When was the last time you slept?" Cas frowns at him.
Dean hovers in the doorway, unsure what to do. He feels so lost.
Meg holds his gaze.
Lying motionless on his back, he looks even younger than usual. His face is blank, almost peaceful.
Jack nods miserably. "We wanted to do it together. But as we stepped through the portal, something went wrong. Chuck and Amara woke up. Suddenly they were separate from my being. It's like the Empty knew that there were too many parts to my self."
Fading, Dean thinks about Cas. Cas is never off his mind, not really, but his world is fracturing and splintering and he grabs at the biggest pieces of his life to hold onto.
"They did," says Meg flatly. "It was not easy to subdue them." She snaps her fingers once more, and they disappear.
Dean laughs a full, hearty laugh at that, and he holds Cas' left hand in his own as he moves his right hand to cradle Cas' face. "Sorry, I guess. But in my defense, you did try to rupture my eardrums." His thumb wipes the tears from Cas' cheekbone.
"I might be crazy for doing this," Sam says quietly. "I might just be crazy, period. But Dean...I hope you're not here. I hope I'm wrong. I hope you can't hear me right now. But if you can..." Sam takes a long pause. His eyes well with tears, and he looks up towards the ceiling as if gravity might hold them back.
Dean is almost halfway through the library when a sound shatters his world. It's quiet, but the bunker has been silent for so long it may as well be a jet engine.
"Wait," Dean stammers. "Jack, wait."
"Dean?"
Billie ends on a wheezing chuckle. She wipes her eyes needlessly. "Oh, Dean," she begins, but Meg cuts her off.
Looking into Dean's eyes, Cas remembers the last time he saw them. "Look at me," Dean had said. "Cas, please, look at me." And when Cas had raised his head from the concrete floor, blood spilling from his neck, he had seen Dean's face, horrified, desperate and pleading. But still beautiful. "Cas," he'd said, "it's gonna be okay. You hear me? You're going to be okay. Just hold on, Cas, please. Hold on."
"Oh, buddy, I know, trust me," Dean says jovially. "And here's the thing. They're the ones causing all the problems. They're pulling all the strings. With those two chained up, we won't have any reason to keep hunting. We'll just go have normal, boring lives. And here, everyone goes back to sleep. It gets nice and quiet. You'll get to be regular Sleeping Beauties."
"You...you brought everyone back...even..." Dean's voice gets lower as he continues, and his voice cracks on the last word. It was hard enough to say Cas' name the first time. It feels dangerous to ask for something - someone - out loud, in the open. Admitting he needs Cas back feels like he's inviting every monster within a thousand-mile radius to interfere. He's in shark-infested waters, and speaking his need aloud is reopening dozens of bloody wounds.
Burt, the bald, bearded man, seems to notice very little in general. Nervous Jamie, despite his thick glasses, misses all of Dean's messages. The woman, Flora, comes closest, but the best reaction Dean gets out of her is when she looks over her shoulder as if to check she's not being watched. She is being watched, but Dean is right in front of her.
It's gray. Not a soft, gentle gray or a deep, charcoal gray. It's the kind of gray that swallows up any light that comes near it. Flat, homogeneous, and featureless. It's suffocating. Neither cold nor hot, neither light nor dark. It's just...gray.
He wonders if he'll see Cas again.
Dean has watched and waited long enough. He thinks it's time to write his own story.
Dean can see slightly darker shadows silhouetted against the blackness that surrounds him. They're moving just enough that Dean can spot them.
Dean closes his eyes. He breathes, and feels Cas breathe with him. He opens his eyes and looks directly into Meg's.
"I can't," Jack mutters.
"What's gotten into you, Burt?" Flora asks. "This isn't like you."
Dean thinks about what he could do with more time. He could watch out for Sam. He could help more people.
Dean shoots a sidelong glance at him. "What do you mean, of course he's gonna come back to the bunker," Dean says. "He's a man with a plan, he's top dog, he can do whatever he wants now!" Dean turns toward the car, ready to put this town in the rear-view mirror.
He pauses. He's not expecting a response, but he feels incomplete somehow.
That feeling of
As he watches Jack turn to walk away, Dean thinks about the best version of himself. He thinks about a version of himself who doesn't succumb to anger and pain and fear, who acts for love, who speaks the truth. He remembers Cas' words again, and Dean knows he has to say something. He can't let anyone else leave without hearing him.
The voices are just outside Dean's bedroom door now. He can see light from their flashlights reflecting off the hallway floor.
Sam moves quickly towards the door, only barely managing to avoid walking through Dean. Miracle waits for a moment before following him out. As she passes by Dean, she looks up at him, holding eye contact for a moment before running to catch up with Sam. Dean chases them, watches Sam climb the stairs above the War Room and pause on the balcony, surveying the bunker.
Dean thinks about how proud Cas would be if he could hear Jack right now, talking about a beautiful new world where God has faith in people, where belief and love matter. He decides to follow Cas' example.
"A whole coven? Shit. Yeah, I can be there today. Yeah, I'm okay. See you soon," Sam says, holding his phone to his ear with one hand and pulling his boots on with the other. Dean watches silently from the hallway as Sam packs his things. He tries not to spy on Sam too much, but it's hard to break a habit he's had since before kindergarten. He catches himself worrying about Sam just as often as he did before he died, and this is no exception. This doesn't sound good, whatever Garth is dealing with. Dean knows that Sam and Garth can both handle themselves, but he'd sure feel better if he knew they had backup.
Fuck.
The journey knocks the wind out of Dean, and as he recognizes the familiar sight of his bedroom and gasps for air, he fears that he's back in the nightmare again.
Sam's smile is part joy, part relief, and part gratefulness. "Okay," he agrees. "Take me home."
Chuck ponders this for a moment. Then he laughs. It's cruel, mocking. "Cas? You want Cas back? Why didn't you say so?" Chuck's voice is shot through with malicious glee. He snaps his fingers.
Dean steps through his bedroom door into the lit hallway. He walks the halls, taking stock of the bunker. He eventually finds Sam and Miracle sitting in the kitchen, Sam hunched over a steaming cup of something.
"Yeah, Cas here is real sorry about that," Dean replies smoothly, shifting Cas in his arms slightly as he says it. He notices Meg's jaw tighten at the sight.
Dean doesn't want to die.
Dean paces around his small, cluttered room until he hears the hunters rising from their rest, presumably the next morning. He hears them go into the kitchen and start making coffee. As with most other things, it makes Dean think of Cas.
, it's Cas, his deep voice familiar and yet somehow wrong. Dean again feels the sensation of being underwater and hearing someone speak from miles above him. There's an inexplicable distance distorting the sound and twisting Dean's feelings.
He immediately regrets the harsh words. But Jack is confident and self-possessed as he fires back, "And those answers will be in each of them." He's so sure, so absolutely sure, that it takes Dean by surprise. Jack's words clear the air between them, a clean, cold breeze that brings a memory with it.
He sobs. Does it make a sound?
He can move forward. He can stay still. Or he can move backward.
She's there, of course. Right where they had found her phone on the sidewalk. Waiting for them. Dean hasn't even fully stopped, just slowed the car to a roll, when Sam throws open the door and runs to her.
Jack's mouth twitches upward, just a little, his serene, peaceful smile becoming something wistful. He turns back to fully face Dean and Sam. "Thank you, Dean. I will do my best."
Dean rises from the floor of his bedroom.
Dean watches his face closely, searching for any tiny movement, but Cas is still motionless.
The first voice, Hazel, hums in a noncommittal sort of way. "Hey, why is this door closed?"
"Hey, Cas," Dean murmurs, grinning broadly while his eyes flood with tears.
Dean comes back to himself with two near-simultaneous thoughts. First, he thinks that this cold, dark, weightless silence must be what it feels like to be in space. Then he remembers how much Cas loved stargazing.
"Dean, wait!" he calls. Dean rolls his eyes, but he's secretly glad to be able to feel annoyed with his brother again. As if Dean would leave without him.
Sorting through his lethargic brain is a challenge, but Cas carves winding trails through his memories, searching for the most recent. The scene is clouded, dusty. Trying to recall is like peering through someone else's glasses. But he remembers the laughter, echoing around him.
Time isn't quite the same for Dean. He's aware of time passing, but it's hard for him to track hours, days, weeks. He doesn't know how long he's been back before Sam gets a call to go help Garth with a hunt.
"Castiel!" Jack cries out, and rushes to his side, kneeling next to him. Dean, on the other hand, is suddenly frozen on the spot. He can't move. He can't speak. He's been dreaming of this moment for so long. He dreamed of it when he was alive, and he dreamed of it while he was trapped in the Empty's ghost story. It suddenly hits Dean that he must have been a ghost for years. Decades. And all he wanted was to find Cas.
Cas closes his eyes. His concussion must be worse than he thought. There's absolutely no way this is happening.
So Dean starts talking. During the day, he pleads with them to help him - bring him spell ingredients, find someone to help him, get him out of the bunker. When they sleep, he begs them not to leave yet.
Dean Winchester is dying.
Dean gives Sam a level, steady gaze. "Positive," he says firmly. "I need to do this by myself. And besides," he smirks, shooting a wave to Eileen over Sam's shoulder. "I'm sure you have a lot of catching up to do."
Cas doesn't wake. But he moves. Dean can feel Cas' body light up under his touch, feel their atoms drawing together like they're magnetized. Dean sucks in a breath, and it feels like it's the first he's ever taken. He sees Cas' chest rise, and fall. Barely. Dean moves his hand to Cas' sternum, and inhales. He feels Cas inhale too.
One corner of Dean's mouth curls into a gentle smile as a memory floats back to him. "'A more profound bond,' you called it once. What we had. What we still have, I hope." Dean unconsciously clutches the jacket a little tighter as he continues.
Dean gets back to work. He tries to focus his mind solely on Cas, to keep himself steady. He's going to get Cas back. Cas is going to come home. After so long away, Dean has to re-train his body to interact with the physical world. It takes some time before he can even pick up books again.
There is a hushed, musical sound, like tinkling bells. Dean opens his eyes, and sees a dark, twisting portal opening before him.
"Dean?" Cas returns, his throat feeling parched from disuse.
Faith is a funny thing. It's something Dean had never had, and something Cas had always had. Until they met. Cas was an unstoppable force and Dean was an immovable object, but Cas stopped and Dean moved, and they did it for each other. For love.
"I'm still sleeping with one eye open," mutters the dark-haired woman.
Burt grumbles wordlessly. He stares off into the distance for a long moment before he sighs and drops his gaze.
Cas stirs under Dean's hand. Dean's eyes fly open just in time to see Cas' eyelids begin to flutter.
Dean felt more at home in those moments than in any other. Warm and full, even on the coldest, darkest winter nights.
When he closes his eyes, he sees Cas' blue ones, sparkling with tears. The light reflected off his eyes the same way it reflected off the lake Cas disappeared into, when every rational thought told Dean he was gone for good. It was the same way the river in Purgatory glimmered in the flat half-light when Dean found Cas again.
In the meantime, he keeps researching, and he helps Sam. Dean tries his best to steer clear of Sam, but it's hard to tamp down his older brother instincts. One night Sam is up reading in the library long past his usual bedtime, and Dean, curious, sneaks a peek at his notes after he goes to bed. It looks like Sam is tracking a lamia, but he's mistaken it for a vampire. In the stack of books next to Sam's computer, Dean finds the one with the most information on lamias and leaves it on top of the pile.
Cas looks confused for a split second, and Dean has missed that bemused expression so much. Then Cas' eyes lock onto Dean's.
Smack.
Cas loved him. Cas loved him so much that he died for it. And now, he's gone forever. Restored to factory model angel-of-the-lord.
Dean watches Sam and Eileen until they close Eileen's front door behind them, then drives away.
This time, it's Dean who's at a loss for words. Cas waits for a moment before Dean's face breaks into a warm smile. "Yeah," he says, reaching for Cas' hand and interlacing their fingers. "Yeah, let's do it."
He's alone, now. For good. He's sure no one will come to a haunted bunker now that he's hurt a kid.
Cas doesn't stir under Dean's touch. Dean can barely register Cas' body under his hand, neither cold nor warm, neither dead nor alive.
Dean and Sam go to meet with Chuck, and Dean asks for the one thing he really wants. Chuck is only too happy to oblige.
Go back and watch 15x19 and tell me Dean wasn't about to say something as Jack was walking away. Jensen Ackles c'mere I just want to talk about your microexpressions and your very loud post-finale silence.
"What do you want?" Meg repeats.
"Help?" Hazel echoes.
remember, but he has to work to fit the puzzle pieces together. They're scattered around his head, telling a story in syllables rather than sentences. "We came here on purpose, didn't we? We had a plan?" Dean thinks about all the research he did as a ghost and remembers doing the same research in the land of the living. It had taken many sleepless nights to find a way into the Empty, but he, Sam, and Jack had discovered it.
Dean paces around his room as he considers his next move. Dean has ganked more ghosts than anyone on the planet. He knows most of them stick around because they have unfinished business, and he knows what his unfinished business is. He knows some of them have physical constraints. Salt, wards, the usual. This is hunting 101, but Dean keeps getting distracted by his worries about Sam and Garth, and his fear that he'll never be able to escape. His brain feels like a sieve, only able to hold onto thoughts for a short time before they drain away. So it takes him much longer than it usually would to remember that ghosts can be tied to objects.
Dean inhales a sharp, stabbing breath when he realizes that nobody ever told Cas he was loved. He can feel Sam's worried glance in his direction, but Dean can't look at him. His eyes flood with tears again, recognizing that Cas died without knowing he was loved, so loved.
"They brought you to where they were holding me, so they could kill you as I watched," Dean whispers. "Kill you, then kill me. That was the plan. And it was all my fault, Cas, I'm so sorry. I couldn't get out, I couldn't get to you."
It's a small group of people. Dean doesn't recognize any of them. They're dressed like hunters, at least. And they got into the bunker without breaking anything. With the lights still out, they're carrying flashlights. Dean silently retreats to the shadows as one of them, a broad man with a bald head and a red beard, whistles low.
The way Jack's face softens almost looks like awe. Dean can hardly believe it either.
Dean rises to his feet and extends a hand to Jack, who lets Dean pull him up. "So, we got zero exit strategy, one missing angel, and two gods on the loose. Whaddya say, kid? Do those bastards even have a chance?"
"But he won't wake," Jack whispers.
"We won't be here long. Week or two, probably. Just long enough to get those demons off our trail," the bald man says confidently. "I heard this is the safest place for hunters in the Western Hemisphere."
Here, in the Empty.
After watching Jack vanish, Dean turns back toward the Impala, walking with quick, short strides. He pulls open the door and slides behind the wheel, shutting the door behind him. He looks back over his shoulder to see Sam hurrying towards the car.
Dean lets his head fall forward, burying his face in his hands as despair pulls him into the deep again.
It's comfortable, sitting there together. They don't need to fill up the quiet room with chatter. Occasionally one will ask a question. Dean asks if Cas is cold, but Cas says that Dean's keeping him warm (Dean blushes a little, and so does Cas). Cas asks about Sam and Eileen, both of whom are back at the motel they booked when they rolled into town. Jack's come by to check in on Cas a few times. He's busy these days, making the world a better place. Cas is so proud of him. Dean asks what he's thinking about, and Cas hums in response before admitting, "you," which makes Dean blush again.
"Now will you go home and get some rest?" she asks in an aggravated tone.
One of the kids turns to look at him.
Dean sighs. It's not that he expected the afterlife would be a walk in the park, but it sure would be a welcome change of pace.
Dean smiles to himself as he looks away, focusing on parking the car. It's not for him to see such a private moment. He fiddles with the stereo until Sam comes back to the passenger door, resting his hands on the windowsill and leaning into the car.
He crosses to his closet and opens it, reaching out to touch the jacket Cas stained with his bloody handprint. Dean barely has to think about it. His fingers brush the stained fabric with ease.
"Help me," Dean grits out.
He was so stupid, thinking he could save Cas. Dean could never do anything like that. Never do anything that good.
Cas smiles at him so gently that it's almost imperceptible, like it's a secret for the two of them to share. Cas looks around the room, sees Sam and Eileen hovering in the doorway, Jack at his side.
Dean unclenches his fist and holds his hand up to his face, examining his knuckles. He's not bleeding - he doesn't think he even has blood anymore - but his hand feels different than it did before. It's almost feeling...more.
The Empty is getting less empty.
Sam punches Chuck first, and Dean is happy to let him have it. He knows it's just a diversion, and Dean doesn't trust himself to pull back after only one hit.
"Yeah?" Jack asks, a little bitterly. "And how do you even know we're out? How do you know we aren't still dreaming?"
Before Dean can finish, Cas steps back, leaving Dean's hands cupping the air. Cas turns away. He takes one step, two steps, and then Chuck snaps his fingers, and Cas is gone.
"Hey, kid," Dean says. "Welcome back."
Also: sorry to keep adding chapters! This chapter got longer than I expected. Chapter 4 will definitely, absolutely be the final chapter, for real this time. Thanks for reading!
"It looks like someone was buried alive in here," Hazel adds. "You know, those stories about claw marks on the inside of a coffin lid?" She shivers.
Dean nods almost-imperceptibly at the most recent vision of Cas. He can feel Cas' warm hand on his shoulder again. When Dean blinks, he's gone.
"Cas, you had me. You always had me. Maybe from the night we met, maybe from the first time I lost you, but you always, always had me. I didn't know I could want you. I didn't know how. But I did, I do. I have never loved like I have loved you. I love you." And Dean's eyes well over, and he's laughing and crying and he can't stop saying it. "I love you, I love you so much, I-"
Cas is still goggling at Dean, trying to make sense of what he's saying. Before he can even ask the question, Dean answers it in a rush.
Dean opens his eyes, and he remembers everything. All his life, all his afterlives, it's all here.
He's considering drowning Chuck in the lake when Chuck says he'd be honored to be killed by the Winchesters. He looks at Dean. "The ultimate killer," he laughs.
Dean starts simple. It's just one word, carved painstakingly into the dust blanketing the largest desk in the War Room.
Dean grins, and leans down to brush his lips to Cas'. "I love you, Cas," he murmurs against his lips, just hovering there. Cas moves up to meet him in a real kiss. His heart feels like it's overflowing, sending heat surging through his limbs, making his head spin. It's everything he never dared to dream he would get.
He takes a deep breath.
It's okay, Dean thinks to himself. It's okay. I'll find him. What had Jack said?
Dylan, his voice trembling, says, "Come on, let's leave it."
Dean stares at the wooden table and resists the urge to bang his head against the hard surface. He's not sure what would happen, but he's also not sure he wants to know. But what is he supposed to do? How can he save Cas if he can't even pick up a stupid book?
Jack shakes his father by the shoulder, gentleness evaporating as he becomes more frantic. He calls out Cas' name. Cas doesn't stir. Jack turns to Dean, panic etched in every line of his face.
Like an idiot, he holds his hand up in front of his face to see if it's transparent (it's not). He stands up from the bed and waits to see if his feet will sink through the floor (they don't). And because he obviously has to try, he walks over to the door and reaches out, and yep, his fingertips clip straight through it.
Dean prays, and he waits for just one more miracle.
Shit.
Sam slides his left hand from Dean's back to his upper arm. His right hand carefully avoids the bloody handprint on Dean's jacket, resting instead on Dean's left forearm. Dean can barely feel Sam's hands as they lift him to a standing position. All he can feel is the ghost of Cas' hand on his left shoulder, the warmth of his face quickly dissipating from Dean's palms.
Cas and Dean just stare at each other for a long time. Dean's eyes seem to glow brighter than anything in the semidarkness, burning into Cas' own. There's love behind them, Cas realizes, and he knows his own eyes are projecting and reflecting the same fierce passion.
Even the concept of direction is absent in the Empty, but Dean begins to walk straight ahead. Hissing, menacing whispers surround him.
Could this be his chance? Maybe the hunters could help him get what he needs for the ritual. Or they could get spooked and run away, leaving Dean alone again. Or they could hunt Dean, banish him, and end his existence permanently. Shit.
Samandriel had been right, all those years ago. Had Cas known then? Had Dean known then?
And then Chuck vanishes Miracle. And if it was easy to fall back into his work, it's even easier to fall back into his rage. Dean has one thought, and it's to end Chuck. He might even break out his good knives for that.
"Dean, are you - do you - really?" he manages to stammer out. His eyes scan across Dean's dimly-lit face, searching for a tell in the clench of his jaw, the furrow between his eyebrows. But there's nothing to see. Dean's face is so familiar to Cas, but the open, warm honesty it currently holds is rare. It's becoming less rare by the day, but it's still a joy to behold.
, Dean thinks again. He falls to his knees and he screams, a long wordless howl of agony that echoes around his empty, empty, empty home. It extinguishes every single light bulb, and the darkness rushes in to wrap Dean in despair.
Dean has always appreciated a good movie montage. He likes the way they move the story along, how they inspire and uplift. The music is usually pretty badass too. He wishes he had his own montage right about now, because being a ghost is
"They're already dead," whispers Burt one night, his face lit eerily by the portable lantern they have set up in the War Room. None of the bunker's lights work, though the power is running.
Energy expended, Dean can't speak the last thing he wants to say. He thinks it instead, sends it out as a prayer. "I'm sorry, Cas. I love you."
"Thank you," Cas says to all of them. "Thank you for bringing me home."
Cas is gone.
Chuck's low laughter curls through the still air like poisonous gas. "You really thought that an angel could feel? Could love? I'd feel sorry for you if it wasn't so damn funny," Chuck snickers. "He was a mistake. A defect. He's back to the way he was always supposed to be, before you ruined him. Angels can't love. And even if they did, they certainly wouldn't love you, you pathetic, sniveling child. You're nothing more than a killer, Dean. A weapon, a tool for stronger and better men to use. And you thought...what, exactly? That you'd be able to save the day with the power of love? Don't be stupid. That's just bad writing."
A quarter of the way through a collection of scribbled notes on summoning rituals, Dean suddenly realizes he's reading his own handwriting. The memory of writing it lurches back into his mind. A few years back, Dean had made a point to update some of the library materials with new information, tricks he'd picked up. He hoped they would be helpful to future hunters. Now, they might just be helpful to him.
His heart, which was the death of him.
For the first time in his existence, he feels like he has a real choice over what he does next. It may not be his
"This place is niiiiice," he observes.
Smack.
Bent double as he tries to catch his breath, Dean notices a bottle tucked under his bed. Whiskey. The good stuff. He'd been saving it for something, but he can't remember what. He grabs the bottle, and he starts drowning in a different way.
"Your husband has refused to leave your side since you arrived," she huffs. "Maybe you can talk some sense into him now that you're awake." She turns and leaves, dimming the lights again before shutting the door behind her.
Dean starts writing more than he reads. After forgetting Eileen, he's determined not to do it again. He writes names like hers, like Garth, like Charlie, like Claire. Jack, Sam, Cas...he can't imagine forgetting them. He writes them anyway. Over, and over. On scraps of paper torn from useless books, receipts from places he doesn't remember visiting.
Dean stares at the simple cloth that holds all he has left of Cas. It's a bizarre kind of intimacy to see Cas' blood on the jacket and know that it pumped through his veins and was touched by his heart.
Dean thought his heart had been extinguished, left a pile of cold ashes. But Jack's words stoke the hearth, revealing the ashes to be coals, dimmed but not doused, burning bright and hot from within.
"Did you hear that?" she asks, and it's Wendy's voice. She shines her flashlight directly into Dean's eyes without seeing him.
Dean closes his eyes.
A dozen years' worth of memories flash through his head like a hacky movie montage. He tries to skip past the painful ones, where someone or something - sometimes Dean himself - has hurt Cas. He tries to catch the rare little moments of bliss, like snowflakes on his tongue, barely present before they melt away. Cas smiling at Jack, Cas laughing at something stupid Sam said, Cas gazing at Dean in that way that feels like it pierces his soul.
"Of course you will," Dean reflexively replies, and he means it. The unfamiliar feeling of pure, unfiltered honesty is intoxicating. Dean heaves a deep breath and asks what he's been too afraid to ask until now.
The dust lies thick on the bunker's surfaces when Dean finishes the last book in the library.
Dean hasn't told Sam and Jack yet. He doesn't know if he can find the right words, and he doesn't trust himself to talk about Cas without becoming utterly lost. So Dean does everything he can to keep it together - for Sam, for Jack, for everyone Chuck vanished. He can deal with the aching emptiness later. The way it feels like Billie is still clutching his heart with frigid fingers. The way his shoulder still feels too warm and too cold, set ablaze with a fiery handprint and doused by the clutch of the Empty.
"Cas, I love you so much. I've loved you for so long, longer than you know. And I spent so long lying to myself about it, about you, because I was scared to screw it up. I was scared of screwing you up. I haven't always been good to people, I know. But you make me feel, not just like I want to be good, but that I can be good. You make me feel like there is good out there. Loving you makes me better. I love you more every day. I used to think I knew what I wanted out of life. But I was wrong. All I want - all I need - is you. I want to be with you, wherever you go, whatever you do, for as long as we've got left. And I've wanted to ask you this for so long, but the time never seemed right until it seemed like we were out of time. So. Will you marry me?"
Alone in his room, Dean shuts the door. His legs, having valiantly carried him this far, finally wobble, and he collapses with his back to the door and his knees drawn to his chest. It's so cliché, he thinks to himself. All he needs is some sappy music playing in the background, and his life would be a full-on chick flick.
Dean can't remember what color Cas' eyes are.
After Sam went to bed, Dean walked to the library. Before he died, he had been scouring every book they owned to try to find a way into the Empty. Dean figures he can pick up where he left off.
Dean squints. It hurts to look directly into the gray, but there's also nothing else to look at.
"I'm really as close as this," Jack concludes, placing his hand over his heart. He contemplates the feeling for a moment, then lifts his hand in farewell. "Goodbye," he states. So simple, so unpretentious. So unlike Chuck.
He can't go there. No distractions.
"Sammy," he says calmly, "I know what I'm doing."
Sam puts the car in gear and pulls out of the garage. Dean blinks in the daylight and -
"Dean!" Jack whispers from just over his shoulder, as Billie breaks into gleeful laughter.
Dean thinks about moving forward. It feels like that's the direction he's supposed to go. There is no certainty in this realm, but he thinks that moving forward will send him to his afterlife.
"You were wearing this when we met," Cas says in wonder. Dean nods.
Sam's voice drifts toward Dean, but it's hard to make out the words. They're blurry. He can't understand them. They're an ocean apart.
"I came because I need to ask. Please. Watch out for him. Since I can't. Please."
What better place to wait than the site of his greatest regret?
"I could put you back to sleep right now," Meg taunts. "It would be so easy. We've got so many plans for you, Dean. So many ways for you to torment yourself. We've got the nastiest, most brilliant minds in the history of existence coming up with new nightmares for you as we speak. You'll spend eternity pushing everyone away from you, poisoning everyone you love, and you won't know it's not real."
Just like everyone does.
The bunker is completely silent. Dean knows he should hate the deserted rooms, promising loneliness, reminding him of absence. But it's temporary. He goes to his room first, wincing when he sees the empty bottles littering the floor. It looks like he stepped on one or two of them, the broken glass glittering ominously.
He doesn't have long left, but he wants to do right by Sam. Doesn't want to hurt Sam or leave him worrying. It's Dean's job to watch out for him, and what Dean can do now is say goodbye, without revealing to Sam that he's in pain, that he's terrified. That he doesn't want to go.
"I swear on Castiel's life that I will keep my word."
Dean bites back a snarky rejoinder and says simply, "I will."
The pile of finished books grows, and grows, and grows.
Then, he stops to rest. Usually he thinks about Cas. He prays, often. Sometimes he gets stuck in loops, where he's just apologizing over and over.
"They must have overpowered us," Jack concludes, shaking his head. "I don't remember anything after the realization that I was breaking apart. Except...except the dreams." He curls in on himself, looking smaller than ever as he locks his gaze on his kneecaps.
A weapon? Maybe, but Dean has so many that he doesn't think he could attach himself to one. It's gotta be something important, something that anchors him. Something Dean wouldn't be Dean without.
The concrete splinters under the force of his knuckles, fractures radiating outward from where Dean's fist made impact.
Dean pushes open the door to the dungeon for the first time in his afterlife.
"Dean," Jack pleads, though he can't finish his request.
"It's locked," say Dylan and Wendy at the same time, though their tones could not differ more. Dean, relieved, sympathizes with Dylan.
"Yeah," Dean breathes out. "Yeah, really. Is that...okay?" A more familiar expression is creeping into his face now as Dean tucks his chin down and glances up at Cas through his eyelashes. He bites into his bottom lip. It's part anxious, part hopeful, and all raw vulnerability. It's the same look he wore when he brought Cas back and told him he loved him too.
The laughter continued, Cas remembers. He squeezes his eyes shut, as if the darkness will illuminate his memory. He just remembers Dean's eyes, wide, fierce. Cas reopens his eyes and looks to Dean, who finally raises his head. His eyes are wild now, just on the edge of tears.
Cas thinks about the value of speaking truth. It is no mean feat, as he knows all too well. But lying in the gloom of a hospital, Dean's hand in his, he knows it was worth it. He had always believed Dean was worth it.
They'd get out of the car and look up to the clear, dark sky. Cas could name every star, every planet, every constellation. He could describe distant galaxies with such detail and precision that when Dean looked up photos of them later, he was always disappointed by the quality of the images. Sometimes he would tell Dean about a certain celestial body, or describe an event that was happening. More often, they sat in the grass or on the trunk of the Impala, making no sound except for their breathing.
Sam's gone.
"But I think you can."
The darkness is getting nearer, closing in on Dean as he tries to force something other than his heart to move. He strains as the silence presses in on him. Dean is utterly terrified. And that realization is what helps him break free. He's terrified, but he's not as terrified as when he realized Cas was about to sacrifice himself. Cas is here. Dean is here. They're together again.
He hurls the book across the room. It hits the ground askew and skids through the dust, leaving a scar in its wake.
The beginning.
"So...it's okay?" Dean asks, and Cas has earned an eye roll at this point.
"I know," Cas whispers, "I know. I'm not gonna leave you either."
"All right," Cas replies. The doctor turns her gaze to Dean, who flinches like a fugitive caught in a searchlight.
"There were too many," Cas says haltingly.
He thinks about the way Cas laughed when a bat flew low over the Impala one night and Dean yelled in surprise (not fear, absolutely not fear, Dean insisted, and Cas laughed harder). The little proud smile Cas gave him when Dean recognized a constellation Cas had taught him. The icy December night when Cas had insisted they find a spot to watch the Geminid meteor shower, and Dean had wrapped a blanket around their shoulders as they huddled together and watched the sky fall.
"Sammy?" Dean calls softly from the kitchen entrance. Sam doesn't move, but Miracle lifts her head off her front paws and stares straight at Dean. She jumps up, barking. Sam raises his head from his mug and looks toward Dean. Looks through Dean.
"What?"
Sam just looks at him. Dean knows he should feel ashamed, but the booze is numbing his brain, shutting off the parts that feel shame...or grief.
All people do is leave Dean.
"We won," Dean says, allowing a note of righteous fury to bleed into his voice. He watches Chuck flip through the God Book as they explain "Plan B," but Dean's patience is wearing thin. He can't wait to get his hands on Chuck, finally, after so long.
"Hey," Dean says, his grip tightening on Jack's forearm in sympathy. "There's nothing you could have done. It's okay. It's not your fault." Jack relaxes a little as he nods halfheartedly. Dean continues, "Whatever you saw...it wasn't real. And we're outta there now."
Sam, discomfited by Miracle's upset, drains his cup, then pushes his chair back from the kitchen table and stands. "Come on, girl," he says, and moves to leave the kitchen. Dean hops out of the doorway just in time. He doesn't know if Sam will be able to feel his presence physically, but he doesn't want to risk Sam walking through him and freaking out. Sam shuffles toward his bedroom, Miracle at his heels, taking a last glance over his shoulder before he goes. He looks right at Dean without knowing it.
Dean can't believe it's taken him this long to think of it. He could go with. Why not? He's a ghost, right? There's nothing that says he can't travel. Sam doesn't have to know it's him. Just a little good luck. Dean remembers Mary telling him angels were watching over him. He ain't no angel, but he can at least try to help Sam.
Cas laughs, and the movement causes a fresh wave of tears to spill from his eyes. "Dean, how could I forget the first time I saw you on Earth?" He laughs again. "Which was also the first time you stabbed me."
"Okay, haha funny guy," Wendy says, rolling her eyes.
Dean wakes up to a poke in the back. He doesn't remember what he was dreaming about. He thinks he probably doesn't want to.
"I...I'm proud of you. And, uh," Dean inhales here, trying to breathe in enough energy to say his name, "Cas...Castiel would be too."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean's crying by now, and Cas is too, and he's still in a state of shock, but he chokes out, "Yes, Dean, yes, of course," smiling as he says it, watching Dean's face bloom with light and joy. Cas stretches out his left hand and Dean takes it in his own as he rises to his feet.
"Look, a key!" Hazel says excitedly. "Let's try it on that locked door upstairs."
Meg raises her hand straight up at the wrist. She's opening the portal to Earth, but it almost looks like a goodbye.
The boy, Dylan, says, "Hear what?"
"If you can hear me, you need to listen. Because Dean...you shouldn't be here. You shouldn't have come back. You need to move on. Whatever it is that's keeping you here, you need to let go of it."
The next day, as they check out of the hospital, a sign catches Cas' eye. He nudges Dean with his good elbow, and points to it. "What do you think?"
"Swear on his life," she says, in barely more than a whisper.
Cas tries to keep his tone as level and neutral as possible. Communication isn't one of Dean's strong suits, but Cas knows he is trying, in his own boneheaded way. "Husband?" he asks simply.
Where is he?
The bunker is still dark, but Dean doesn't notice.
It doesn't hurt, being reset, but it's also not pleasant, and it's pissing Dean off. After he's exhausted all his possible door options, he tries just going straight through the walls.
"See, that's not who I am," Dean says, and he feels the truth of it settle into his bones.
Dean waits. He waits seconds, or hours, or weeks. He paces around his room as if searching for better cell reception. He prays until his voice is hoarse, his fingers stiff and clawed from clinging to the jacket like a life preserver.
Wherever he is, there is no clear presence or absence of anything, let alone time. His decision may take a thousand years, or a fraction of a heartbeat.
He takes it gently in his hands and dusts it off without realizing he's doing it. It's not actually dusty, but he feels he has done it some harm by throwing it away like he did.
He closes his eyes.
Dean speeds after them, calling "help me, help me, help me," but they don't stop until they get to the door. Wendy is the last one through, and Dean cries out desperately, with all the fear boiling up in him, "help me!"
"Look at the walls," Wendy says.
"You gonna...come back with us to the bunker?" Sam asks.
Dean Winchester is dead.
Most often he retreats to his room, which Sam seems to avoid. Dean doesn't need to sleep, but he does find it easier to physically manifest when he hasn't done it for a while. It's like his ghost batteries are recharged. Most of the time he spends thinking. Sometimes he talks to Cas, telling him all the things he's been wanting to say since Cas was taken. Other times he'll update Cas on his progress, share excitement over a new possible ritual that could open the Empty. When he's really missing him, he prays, though he knows Cas can't hear him.
Just keep moving.
Jack comes in and starts talking about weirdness. Weirdness, Dean can handle.
It's just Dean. He notices that he's wearing the jacket with Cas' bloody handprint on the shoulder. He reaches up to touch the handprint, and suddenly he hears.
Except he literally can't pick up anything. Basic movement - standing, walking, sitting - is totally doable. Interacting with physical objects is proving to be a challenge. Dean feels like he's been in the library for hours. Before he left the bunker for what would prove to be the last time, he had left a pile of promising books sitting on a table. Sam hadn't moved those books, so Dean started by trying to pick up the topmost book on the stack. Except his ghost hands went straight through it.
"Cas," Dean cries out, and he's breaking, decades of protective barriers shattering as love and hope and terror and loss threaten to drag him under, filling his eyes with tears. "Cas, Cas, please, Cas, it's me, I'm here!"
"Cas, I didn't tell you because I didn't think you could ever love me. I didn't think you could love me because I'm...well, I'm a mess. And you're you. You're an angel, and I didn't think you even could feel love the same way humans do. The way I do." And Dean has to say it now, he's right there, teetering on the edge of the deep end.
The Empty returns to silence, the peaceful satisfaction of a balanced universe.
Dean Winchester and Castiel are living.
"My big brother told me," says the first voice.
Pushing himself up to a sitting position, Dean overcorrects, and has to grab onto the edge of the table to avoid falling. A few empty beer bottles clink as they roll across the floor, much too loudly, and he groans.
Dean nods, gaze dropping to their clasped hands, where Cas' thumb is still tracing a soothing pattern over his skin. "You have a minor concussion," Dean says, and that explains a lot for Cas. "Coupla torn muscles, several broken ribs, dislocated shoulder. You lost a lot of blood when they slashed your neck. Ruptured spleen didn't help either." He pauses to let Cas take all this in, or maybe to steel himself for what comes next.
Chuck turns to say something to Sam, but Dean doesn't hear. Chuck vanishes. Dean gasps for air, and understands how it feels to drown.
"Cas," he whispers, his voice still tight and restrained, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. He knows he should look at Sam, look at Chuck, see if anyone sees what he's seeing. It wouldn't be the first time he's hallucinated Cas. But he can't take his eyes off the angel.
Dean looks at Sam, but doesn't actually see him. He sees Cas instead. He sees Cas on the first night they met, the way he looked when Chuck brought him back. He blinks, and he sees Cas in the Croatoan future, shrugging loosely and saying, "I like past you." He sees Cas walking into the lake. He sees Cas as Emmanuel, not recognizing Dean. He sees Cas in Purgatory, for the first time and the last time. He sees Cas grinning brightly though his eyes are filled with tears.
Wendy collapses screaming, her hands covering her ears.
It's only long after she's gone that Dean realizes why the woman couldn't hear him. It takes even longer for him to remember Eileen's name.
And Dean laughs and laughs until Cas pulls him down for a tender kiss.
Sam sounds tired. He looks tired. Dean wonders how long he's been gone. Wonders how Sam has been dealing. It's hard to see him like this. Dean glances at the clock and sees it's nearly three in the morning. Shit.
"What do you want, Dean?" Meg asks tersely. Billie turns to her, eyes widening in shock.
Sam is angry now. "No, Dean, you don't! You've been barreling along like a freight train, crushing everything in your path. If you don't slow down, you're going to lose control." The implied
Dean still has no friggin' clue how he's going to make that happen, but it won't stop him from trying. He's got a promising little shopping list going - a wing feather from an owl hatched under a new moon, the last leaf to fall from a willow tree, seawater from a changing tide. No clue how he'll get those things, but he'll cross that bridge when he comes to it.
Dean doesn't realize he's been frozen to the spot until he can suddenly move again, a boiling wave of panic freeing him. He rushes forward, grabs Cas by the shoulders and looks into his eyes, and they're...blank. There's nothing there.
Dean closes his eyes and sucks in a deep breath, his inhale still shaky. "It was bad, Cas. Real bad. We were, uh - do you remember?" He opens his eyes again, peering into Cas' as if to see his memories there.
Present-day Dean finishes his story in a low mutter. "I watched the light go out in your eyes," he says. "I saw it. Just before you lost consciousness. And I - god, Cas, I was so scared. I didn't know how you could come back."
Dean grabs the beer next to the laptop and downs half of it in one go, his head spinning when he tilts it back.
And now, he'll spend eternity alone with that pain.
"It's a hell of a time to bail. You got a lot of people counting on you, people with questions, they're gonna need answers."
The hunters don't take any notice.
Stupid, stupid, stupid, Dean curses himself. Of course it didn't work. He's gone, he's dead. And it's your fault. As always. You thought he could love? You thought he could love you? You thought you deserved love? You're a killer. Daddy's blunt instrument. A tool, a weapon. They don't need you. No one needs you. That's why they leave. They'll always leave.
Alone in the bunker, Dean has more freedom. He doesn't have to hide his notes or spell ingredients in his room anymore, but drags them out into the library. When he has the energy, he reorganizes the books on the shelves into stacks, sorting them based on how promising they are. He piles up the books he's already finished.
Cas turns his head back to a front-facing position, letting out an uncomfortable little groan at the way his movement pulls at his wound. But the pain has helped clear away a bit of the fog, and he can see the basic sketch of the room he currently occupies - a cold, sterile room with speckled tile below him and industrial lights above him. The lights are turned off, mercifully, leaving the room in a quiet semidarkness. Everything looks washed-out, colorless. It smells washed-out too, almost like nothing at all, but with a faint scent of cleaning supplies and a lingering odor of illness. A hospital. Cas does not remember his other hospital stays with any sort of fondness, and he can feel an uneasiness settling over him.
His shoulder aches.
And now, Cas is here. He's right here in front of Dean and Dean can't pick his feet up off the ground, can't pull air into his lungs. All that moves is his heart, pounding as it never has before.
Deep scratches are etched into the walls of his room. They may have been words, once, but the scars overlap so that only occasional letters are legible.
And they lived happily ever after, the end :) Thank you so much for reading!!!
"I want out," Dean says. "Jack, Cas, and I go free. No tricks. No strings. We walk outta here, back to Earth."
"I forgive you," Cas breathes, "always. I love you, Dean."
Dean remembers how sure Cas was. How certain that Dean deserved love. He thinks about returning that love to Cas. About finally having somewhere to put all the love simmering in his sinews.
The key doesn't work on his room door, but Dylan, curiosity overcoming his apprehension, begins picking the lock. Dean is frozen watching him work. It's something Dean has done so many times, he can almost feel the tools in his own hands.
That's the thought that makes Dean sure he can't go forward. Because he wouldn't be that lucky. If he'd been lucky - if someone was watching out for him - he wouldn't be here in the first place. Jack said he was going to be hands-off, and Dean believes him.
Meg turns to Billie, menacing. "You do not speak for the Shadow, reaper. I do." She snaps her fingers, and Billie is gone.
He opens his eyes to see a whiskey bottle, which he'd apparently been using as a pillow. Slightly more comfortable than the floor. He doesn't remember how he got there. The bottle isn't totally empty. "Look out," he tells it.
He's dead, he knows that. He's died before, but he's never been here before. Wherever he is, it feels unfamiliar. Dean has never been able to remember the details of his previous deaths (for which he's grateful), but he can remember where he went afterwards.
"I thought I lost you," Dean whispers. The "again" lingers in the air between them like a waft of acrid smoke. Every time Cas has come back, he's understood more what his absence does to Dean. He's slowly piecing the puzzle together, but he knows that the scars Dean carries are deep. Cas briefly thinks of what he would do if he lost Dean, but brushes that thought away.
Out of habit more than anything, Dean lowers his hand and shakes out his wrist. It doesn't make him feel better.
Dean hesitates. These are uncharted waters for him. It's hard to ignore his brain, shouting at him to bury his feelings, disguise them with half-truths and stupid jokes. But his heart is still thundering along, and it's telling him it's time for the truth. The real truth.
Dean retreats into his room and stays there. He doesn't leave until he hears Sam go to bed the next night.
Dean screams to no one and nothing, a wordless, soundless cry of frustration. He fears for Sam. He fears for Garth. He fears for Miracle, even though he knows Sam is dropping her off at the nicest doggy day care in the lower 48. How is he supposed to protect them? What is he supposed to do if he can't protect them? If he can't save them?
"In the Empty?" Dean asks, even though he knows.
The thought summons an icy feeling in Dean's stomach, reminding him of a winter long ago, when Sam had dared him to walk on a frozen creek and he'd fallen through the ice. The shock, the cold, the suddenness is all back as Dean realizes that he doesn't know where he'll go.
Before answering, Cas takes a moment to think. There are flashes - a shadow here, a shout there. "No," he answers slowly, stretching out the word.
The silence that follows in her wake is significantly less comfortable. The easiness has evaporated. Dean is shifting nervously in his seat, stare fixed on their joined hands again.
A lifetime of finely tuned instincts tell Dean that something isn't right.
Cas can't tell if what Dean's just said is really this mind-boggling, or if it's the concussion, but he's stunned.
Actually, being a ghost fucking sucks, Dean decides. There's so much he misses, but it's the little things that start to get to him. When he finds himself missing the way the sunlight feels on his face, or the taste of a decent cup of fresh coffee, or the freedom to just go outside, he grits his teeth and gets back to work. These are all things that Cas can't enjoy anymore, and he won't stop until Cas is free.
So Dean considers his last option.
He feels Sam's hand on his back. It's strange. He should appreciate the sympathy of the gesture, but it's somehow unpleasant. Sam's hand is warm, but Dean is cold, he's freezing. Dean thinks Sam is talking to him, but he can't hear.
He tried moving fast, moving slow, attacking the book from above, below, and both sides. He mumbled a made-up spell. He concentrated, really goddamn hard, on moving the book. He pretended he had telekinetic powers and tried to will the book into moving, which had seemed to work for every other friggin' ghost he'd run into over the past several decades.
He walks a fine line between helping Sam and staying hidden. It's not easy, but it's worth it to know he can help keep Sam safe. Dean tries to keep an eye and an ear out for any cases Sam is working on, so he can nudge Sam in the right direction. Nothing major - leaving helpful books lying around, moving useful spell ingredients to the front of shelves. One time Dean sneaks a brass blade into Sam's gear bag before he leaves for a hunt. He doesn't think Sam notices, but sometimes...sometimes Sam looks over his shoulder for a little too long. Sometimes he walks into a room and looks right at Dean. On one terrifying occasion, he actually comes into Dean's room and nearly walks into Dean, who just manages to dive out of the way in time. Sam stares straight at the spot on the wall that Dean had punched. Thankfully, a backup phone in Dean's desk starts ringing, and Sam answers it. Something about missing hearts in Texas. Sam's gone for a while after that one.
Dean cuts him off before he can spiral. "Hey, easy, slow down. What are you talking about, Jack?"
"Yeah!" agrees Wendy, a little too enthusiastically. Dean follows them back upstairs, still clutching the paper with his spell on it.
He noticed it when Cas had sacrificed himself. Sacrificed himself for Dean. Knowing the truth had made Dean feel like he was bursting at the seams, chafing at the inside of his skin. Everything he wanted to say, everything he felt, all the love he had to give, was struggling for a way out.
He can feel a pull in his...body? He's not sure if he's even corporeal, but it's like his cells are being drawn to a magnet, embedded invisibly in the gray in front of him.
"I'm okay, Sam. I know what I need to do. But first, you got somewhere you need to be."
"I heard that one," says Dylan, lowering his hand and turning away from the closet.
Faster and faster, Dean is running towards something for the first time in his life instead of running away from monsters and memories. All his responsibilities and obligations, doubts and fears, are streaming behind him, stretching out like highway lines in a rearview mirror. Get rid of all of the messiness of being human and being chosen, and what is left?
He leans in close and gently presses his mouth to Cas'. It's barely a kiss, just a brush of lips, just the absence of space between them.
He's got work to do.
It feels like years.
Dean's lips brush against the handprint on his jacket, gentle, soft, and tender.
Dean's low voice drags Cas out of this devastating scene. "I wasn't gonna leave you," he's repeating.
Dean suddenly notices his heart pounding in his chest. He can feel warmth spreading outward, thawing and cracking the ice in his veins. The drumming of his heart is a call to action.
Cas' eyes, brimming with tears, but full of relief and peace as the Empty swallowed him. Happiness looked beautiful on him.
Dean hesitates. He doesn't want to dump that burden on Jack. Where would he even begin to answer? Jack's eyes search Dean's face as he finally decides on an answer that's vague, but true. "I did something they didn't expect."
"Not a chance," Dean responds, tone just on the edge of menacing. He locks eyes with the doctor, who sighs. She looks at Cas instead.
Dean is resting in his room after finishing a particularly thick volume on the material and immaterial when he hears a sudden absence of silence. Relief floods him as he recognizes Sam's solid footsteps and the jingling of Miracle's collar. Dean steps through the wall after he hears them pass his doorway, and chances a quick look at Sam. No visible maiming, just a few bruises and cuts. Sam looks a little tired, but nothing appears to have gone horribly wrong.
"Dean, I don't know if you're here. Sam thought you were." The past tense freezes Dean to the spot, even as his mind races to remember the woman's name.
"Well, all things considered, you appear to be on the mend. I think we'll be able to discharge you tomorrow, if you remain stable and continue to rest," the doctor reports.
"Dean...but it's...how? Your whole life?" he eventually fumbles out.
The Empty suddenly silences. It's not the same oppressive, loud silence as before. It's a hush. It's the world holding its breath.
He spends an unknowable and unmeasurable amount of time trying to break free of his prison, only to end up flat on his back in his bed over and over and over again.
Dean leans down over him and checks for a pulse, feeling his own rapidly speed up. Jack's alive. Just asleep. Dean moves his hand to Jack's arm, and gently shakes. Jack opens his eyes slowly.
This earns Cas a second eye roll. "How do you think I feel?"
Cas is gone, gone for good, but Dean thinks he knows how to bring him back.
Here would be still. Dean's never been good at sitting still, after a life on the move. He's not good at being alone either. Remaining in this plane would mean an eternity alone with his thoughts.
The door cracks open, revealing a doctor in navy scrubs and bright yellow clogs. "Hello, Mr. Winchester," she says, but she's looking straight at Cas. He shifts his eyes to Dean, who gives a brief, sure nod. He looks back to the doctor, whose eyes are thankfully on her chart. "It's so good to see you up. How are you feeling?"
Surrounded by invisible legions of presumably angry and extremely powerful beings, Dean should be on the defensive, minimum, if not downright panicking. But a bizarre calm has settled over him. He's the eye of the hurricane. They can't touch him.
They sit in silence for a while, hands still clasped on the bed. Dean seems content to just look at Cas' face, animated as it hasn't been in days. Cas ponders what they'll do next. He doesn't have a clue where to start. He never thought he'd get this chance, to have Dean at all. Let alone to create a new life with him. The potential is endless.
He places his right hand over the handprint on his jacket, squeezing gently. Then he steps through the portal into the Empty.
