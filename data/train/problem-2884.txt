Alright, I’ve got nothing. Goodbye! And clean after yourselves, I know most of you are humans but that’s not an excuse to be assholes.
Before his first death and before the whole Angels and Demons package deal, he had always wondered how the afterlife would have been for someone like him. Especially for someone like him.
What if he didn’t want to see him? What if he hated him? What if his confession didn’t match Dean’s feelings?
A slow nod was the only answer he received, but that was all the encouragement that he needed to keep on going, "So tell me what it is so that I can fight her!"
He had done it a thousand times by now. Breaking into a monster’s lair, killing the thing and getting out as fast as he could, before everything burned down to the ground for some reason, despite him never lighting anything up.
She had then sent some of the photos along their family group chat, with Alex making her swear she’d be asked to tag along next time they went somewhere fancy, but so far the video remained a secret between her, Dean and Jack.
“You okay?” Sam asked, placing a hand over his unscarred shoulder and levelling him with his gaze that he recognised all too well. He had used the same method time and time again, checking in on his little brother, reassuring and comforting.
Well. Okay. Oh, man. I still can’t believe it. Dean got hitched to Cas! I never thought I’d see that day.
“I’m not a Kraken” he said, unable to form a more coherent sentence. It was way too early for conversation and he hadn’t even had his first cup of coffee.
“I did, me and Claire were fangirling the entire time. It was cute, but if anyone asks…” Dean trailed off, motioning with a finger crossing over his throat. He had a reputation to maintain, after all.
Because the Empty already knew, they already knew what Castiel’s true happiness could be. It partially was spending time with his beloved and the family they had built together, but it would also entail safety and domesticity and a life far away from the dangers of the supernatural.
His internal monologue was always really optimistic and trusted his abilities to the max. But his mind might've been right. He was not his father and he was still relatively young in the job, even if he was living this life since he was 4. His solo career was just starting, his father still chose where he went and what he had to hunt. That was the first job he found for himself, his chance to prove to the famous John Winchester that he was not just a scrawny kid anymore.
He let Cas open the radio, although the driver picked the music and shotgun shut their cakehole. He had never let Sammy chose, back down, but Cas was different. Cas knew his favourite station; he knew which cassette to put in whenever Dean was down or tired. Castiel knew him.
Somehow, despite his ability of healing without touch, he was compelled to rest his hand on the hunter’s forehead, savouring the warmth of his skin under his palm. In a couple of seconds, colour rushed back into his face and all vitals returned to normality.
“I am afraid I overstayed my leave…” he said, unable to formulate a thought that did not include the use of the human word ‘
He had finally found something promising, a book that talked in detail about demons and the difference between killing and an exorcism for them. And, while the subject wasn’t his desired one, it was a beginning, nevertheless. For all their differences, angels and demons were birds of a feather, it was only logical that their fate could be similar to one another.
All the lights in the bunker started to flicker and I thought it was a ghost. But then Dad was hugging me and he was not worried, so I knew it was not a ghost. Also I knew because Sam and Pops checked the entire bunker multiple times when they first moved in and I didn’t feel another supernatural presence around, so it was not a ghost.
He had learnt, when he was still young and naïve, how to make himself invisible and how to fit in any tiny space he was given, how to disappear out of sight and out of mind. The notion was still inside of his brain, tuned in with years of experiences and with his grown body, not anymore able to get inside cupboards and tiny motel closets.
Still, he tried to become smaller than he was, hiding his face in between his legs as he lamented of his reckless breakdown. There was still someone in the bunker, if the footsteps were any signal and not a hallucination from his wrecked mind. And yet there he was, on the fucking floor surrounded by dried blood that by now had dirtied his jeans.
He didn’t really believe in anything other than what he could see. But again, he did see a lot of crazy shit that shouldn’t have been real anyway, so his horizons were open, but as a general rule, he tried to follow hard proof. And what was proof enough that someone upstairs cared about him,
He expected a simple text back, perhaps with the modified and perfectioned spell, but she decided to surprise them, directly teleporting herself in the middle of the main room, wards be damned, telling both of them how much damage could be done by their inexperienced hands in regard to such complex magic. Both Dean and Jack took their breathe of relief as she lifted the spell from their responsibility and they immediately began to gather all the ingredients she called for; a task much more doable for the two of them.
He was thinking back to how happy Cas had seemed just a couple of moments earlier, before that monster had decided to take him away from Dean.
“Listen up, Winchester. Hell’s got plans for dear little Sam and even you… there’s nothing you can do to stop us.” That got his attention: Dean kept on reading, rushing his words to be done with, but his mind wandered to her words. What did she mean? How did she know Sam? “Daddy dearest knows something is up… but he can’t see the whole picture. It’s all setting into motion, Winchester. Perhaps I should tell you…”
That had been the original idea, to search and hope for something to come up. But he was past that now: he could feel it in his very soul, that there was a way to rescue his Angel, and he knew that the key to his plan laid there on that table. He had inched closer and closer to an answer throughout the day and he could practically taste it in his tongue.
And he would, most definitely, after their ordeal with his forsaken Father was complete. But all he could do now, was to hold his hunter as tightly as he could, trying to convey his love through the gesture.
The kid might have had his heart in the right place in doing so, but Dean also knew that he had kept their research to himself as well, not wanting to bother Sam in his idyllic and relaxing getaway. They had talked about it, after all, a couple of nights before as they waited in line for their take-out pizzas, and Jack had been the one to suggest secrecy.
It had been endearing, in the beginning, seeing Cas in one of his shirts, flipping pancakes casually in the morning, or taking one of his jackets when they headed out on grocery runs. Besides, the jeans that he had bought did his ass justice and it was a pity to hide all that under the glorious trench coat.
But it was, and his heart had never been fuller, happier. And so he ran, unable to stop the bubbling laughter that escaped his mouth at the thought of being with his Angel for eternity.
And it wasn’t gonna be pretty, he sourly thought as he went back to the Impala, back to Sam with his answers, hoping he wasn’t going to notice his torn knuckles.
He buried his face in the crook of his neck as he held on for dear life, savouring the way Cas’ arms wrapped around him and pulled him closer. He felt the tears rise up and he let them flow, unable to keep them in check any longer, uncaring of anything. Castiel had already seen him cry, even ugly cry, and yet he always remained next to him. Somehow, Dean knew that he would never leave. Therefore he let himself cry.
But perhaps Luck was by their side, for his Angel began to stir in his arms and to slowly open his deep blue eyes, unfazed by his audience. His gaze zeroed on Dean’ face, a soft smile appearing on his lips.
And I will admit that I haven’t been this happy in a while. Not like today anyway, standing next to you on that altar, as you and Dean fucking Winchester got married!
And then, that motherfucker just walked right in, breaking the door up of course. Super casually, with his funky accountant trench coat and his tie all wobbly. Me and Dean blew our barrels out at him, but he just kept on walking, without a single care in the Universe.
He could not keep the smile from forming on his lips, he could not stop his heart from beating wildly in his chest, he could not stop his love from overflowing through the very fabric of the Universe. “Because it is,” he said, reaching inside of his trench coat to take out the most precious treasure in all of Creation, second only to the wonderful man standing in front of him, baffled. “I love you, I will always love you.”
He immediately tensed. Too many weird things regarding the supernatural had happened in too short of a time for this to be unrelated.
And, whenever he needed to complain that his head was loud and chaotic, or that his sleep was getting erratic, or that he felt like shit, he could. He received no judgment, no backlash for feeling. And he also had a few people to talk to, unlike when he was younger.
Cas actually snorted at that, shaking his head in between Dean’s hands, “Good thing we exchanged personalised vows privately, otherwise your brother would have combusted on the spot.”
How could an angel love an animal, cruel and vulgar and vile and primitive compared to his excellence and magnificence?
He stared at their eyes, open and wide. He had never felt so naked and vulnerable than there and then, under their inquiring gaze. “I would do anything,” he declared, his voice steady and sound. There were no doubts in his mind about it: whatever destiny he would have to face, whatever horrors would torment him for eternity, he would do it immediately, without regrets.
“I believe it would be best if we left this place, since she will not come back," said the angel out of the blue.
Dean was speechless. They had thought that the explosion caused the Empty to just shut down, close their doors and barricade inside. No one could’ve predicted this outcome.
No, Sam! Sign it in that order. I fucking know what I just said, so sign it in that fucking order. You know what? NO, I’ll do it, you’re useless. (Eileen, you’re my Uncle and I love you!)
"Sit down, will ya? I'm trying to figure what you might like." That narrowed down Castiel's possible course of action, and he did as he was told. He was a soldier, after all, and was excellent at following orders. "I already told you, I do not need to consume sustenance," he said with a stern voice, giving in to their previous disagreement. It seemed that, despite the number of times he had expressed the same concept, it did not remain in the hunter's mind. Indeed, said hunter simply shook his head vehemently, "Yeah you told me, but I'm not gonna be the jerk that eats alone and has some asshole staring at him!" he commented, looking at the approaching waitress with a gaze that could only be described as
He hadn’t even realised he had crossed the state line, too focused on the way his heart was still beating too fast and not slowing down. He wasn’t seeing the streets and the road, only staring in front of him as if the gravel could give him an answer.
It was incredible, the comfortable way he had settled in Dean’s life. He was so utterly used to rejection and disgust that even a thing as simple as a dog’s affection made his heart ache. Of course, just like the copious amounts of alcohol, they were just a mean to try and fail in filling the gaping hole that occupied his chest, as if he had been impaled.
, hiding all the snacks before movie nights and driving around town when neither could sleep, plus countless other things that they kept in between the two of them, bickering and laughing at inside jokes.
He didn’t know even where to begin to explain himself. How could he? His world had shifted on its axis more times in the previous two days than it had in his entire life. “Kinda. I don’t know, I just… I’ve always thought something, that I was wrong and bad. None of the people I work with would understand and I don’t really know, Cas. I never thought I… Since forever I’d known I’d go downstairs, ya know?”
is how the conversation is happening.” As he walked away, Ben could still hear him. “I wanted us to eat out at Applebee’s, but nooooo.”
Claire’s eyes went wide and she clapped a hand over her mouth. “Oh, my god, they didn’t tell you,” she whispered.
“I don’t know how well their erased memory will hold when they’re looking at you for an extended period of time. It’s enough you’ve been keeping tabs, but it’s been ten years, and these things can degrade.”
“If I did such a good job raising you, you’d have a wife and a ten-year-old and be partner at a law firm. But everyone I touch, no matter how hard I try, they
He kept an eye on Indiana, even though he was gone out of Lisa and Ben’s lives for good. That bridge was burned; there was no going back to them, not that he particularly wanted to. He was happy with Cas, it was a kind of happiness he had never expected, a genuine form of what he’d faked with Lisa for a year.
Claire shook her head. "Castiel isn't my dad. He's trying to be, he's trying to protect me, but his host, Jimmy Novak, my dad, he left one night and never came back. And then my mom went looking for him and dumped me at my dying grandma’s house.” She left what she could out. Something tells her that even half of what happened to her would drive the kid crazy.
"I keep telling you, it's not like that, Ben!" Dean takes a deep breath. " You’re tired. Maybe you should try to go back to sleep until you decide not to be like this."
“Claire, you’re here for a case. You don’t say my name around them. You got it. Get it, kill it, come back here after.”
This shapeshifter must’ve been five kinds of stupid, because it started shedding just as she got in, taking on Ben’s form by the time she was upstairs. “Claire, thank God, it’s in the attic.”
“Daddy issues and no sense of permanence.” She flashed a sarcastic smile, which faded. “Always a dash of accepting your premature death as a teenager. Knowing there’s no way out, not really. And you know what? I
“Hey, hey, hey,” Sam interjected. “You know what? It’s been a long time, Ben obviously isn’t a kid anymore, and it’s a long drive for Claire. So, why don’t we just sit down, order some dinner and talk when the two of you aren’t yelling at each other? Ben, do you want to grab a seat?” he gestured to a sofa, where Ben reluctantly sat down.
end up like this, or dead, or both. Kevin, Charlie, Claire, Jody, I couldn’t even get it away from Ben, apparently.” Dean apparently forgot that Ben was sitting at the other end of the room from him.
“Whatever, kid. Food’s food.” A few minutes later, Claire emerged, obviously struggling with a headache of some sort.
“Civilians. Okay, you’re going to stay in the car, and you’re not going to let anyone in, not even me, unless you take a video of me on your phone. Got it?” She’s opening the back door for him, pulling out a silver knife and a gun.
“Alright. Fine. Have whatever talk you want and I guess I’ll mediate because I’m pretty sure Claire would mediate a fist through his face.”
. It was a tone he thought he didn’t care about the bite behind for years, but it hurt more when Ben said it. “You have a stepkid my age, too?"
“Ben, you were eleven, and you weren’t my real kid. How do you think your mom should’ve reacted? I didn’t exactly have a great dad to learn parenting behaviors off of.”
He went to Sam’s room and knocked. “Cat’s out of the bag, Sammy. We gotta have a family talk, and that includes you.” Claire, for her part, was already on the phone while they all waited for Sam.
“I just… I thought you’d care enough to know there was a shifter after us so other monsters might find us again.”
When Ben cracked two eggs into the pan, Castiel spoke up while he turned on the heat. “Dean, he was never in a position to learn how to cook. He does make bacon, though.”
“Claire, Castiel and I have to talk. Take Ben, I don’t know, somewhere.” She nodded and grabbed Ben by the arm the same way Dean did, out into the hallway.
“Dean, you did a good enough job raising me, and if I didn’t come back, I’m sure you would’ve done even better with Ben,” Sam said, sitting beside Ben, leaving the seat beside Dean open.
about how his dad who was only a dad for a year left to keep him away from the life isn’t going to go well when she has enough parent issues on her own. Besides, you always say we need to talk about our issues as a family. Ben just decided he’s family.”
And his order. Who ordered pie, and then, twenty minutes later ‘More pie, please’? Especially when he’d devoured the first piece like a man who hadn’t eaten all day. He was, in his quiet way, one of the strangest customers she’d ever seen.
Dean entered the motel room, slammed the door, and threw himself exhausted onto the nearest bed. Sammy had gone for supplies, although where he got the energy from Dean didn’t know. That demon had been a bastard to put down. It seemed to be getting harder. God, he hoped he wasn’t getting old. Belatedly, he remembered that he had managed to get, amongst other unsavoury items, some demon blood on his shirt. Wearily, he righted himself, and started to strip. Which was when the air began to shimmer.
‘Nothing. No-one saw anything. We must have canvassed ten freaking city blocks and nothing. How can someone just vanish into thin air?’ Dean threw his weapon bag onto the bed in frustration.
For the first time, a flicker of uncertainty darkened Castiel’s eyes, but it was quickly suppressed. ‘But that is precisely why I must do this. I must feel as they feel, see as they see. It is the only way to know. You, of all people, must understand.’
So fierce in his loyalty, and righteousness, yet so vastly loving. So aware of his obedience to their beloved father, yet so constantly anxious about his role in the war. There were none of them, she thought, who felt this war as deeply as Castiel. None who concerned themselves so much with the human cost. None, save herself, who had spent so much time amongst the humans. And that was why, wasn’t it? His desire for certainty, to understand them in order to know, to be certain that his orders could be followed without the concerns which now weighed his conscience.
‘Dean?’ Without looking Dean correctly guessed that the only change in Castiel’s posture had been a slight head tilt to one side. Irrationally, Dean felt a flare of anger.
Dean dropped his gaze. He couldn’t bear to look at that expression any more. That look on Castiel’s face, he didn’t deserve. It had been selfish. He had just wanted this. This presence, back in his life. This feeling of being watched over, of being safe. Intellectually, it made no sense. Castiel had a war to fight. It wasn’t like he was going to leave the fight to get Sam and Dean out of some mess – they were as much on their own now as they had ever been. But it helped, somehow. Just knowing he was out there, fighting the same fight. It helped.
‘What is she doing here?’ Dean Winchester was not, in general, a morning person, and the likelihood of his happy-go-lucky, days-of -wine-and-roses cheery side being to the fore was diminished exponentially when his first sight upon waking was Ruby at the door of their motel room.
‘Don’t you dare speak to me.’ This was spat at him. Uriel was angrier, more ferocious, than Castiel had ever seen him. ‘You betrayed us. I am here to see you get your just reward. You wanted to live with the humans? Well, you can. For the rest of your pathetically short human existence. Congratulations,
Dean stared dumbly as Castiel walked over to him. Somehow, his mind was telling him, this is a trick. Don’t get excited, don’t get happy, because any minute now the other shoe will drop and you’ll wake up. Or the shape shifting demon will appear. Or something shitty will happen. Because it always does.
For a moment, Dean stared. The amused expression that Castiel was failing to hide took him by surprise. Then he started to laugh.
Which had led said Winchesters to their current situation. Attempting, once more, to summon an angel. Admittedly, Dean’s method this time was a little less sophisticated than Bobby’s original spectacular summoning symbols and traps which he had optimistically assumed would hold Castiel, before they had discovered his true nature.
Dean glared as Ruby entered. ‘Oh hi, just in time to join the search, I see. Thanks for all your help today, by the way. Oh
‘Oh, the agony of choice.’ Sam looked out of the window at the people on the street, lounging in doorways and leaning on the walls with the studied casualness of nefarious intent. Some of the younger male residents were already eyeing the car. Some of the younger female residents were eyeing its occupants. It was a mark of Dean’s concern, thought Sam, that he was even contemplating leaving the Impala alone in such a neighbourhood.
‘Great.’ Sam sounded positively enthused. ‘Get in, take ‘em down, pull Cas out. Nothing we haven’t done before, right?’ This to Dean, who was staring at Ruby.
Dean walked back and slipped into his chair opposite Sam, continuing his lunch as if absolutely nothing out of the ordinary had just occurred. Castiel, with ease in their presence that was as unusual as it was welcome, followed him across the room and perched on the edge of the bed nearest to the table.
Dean remembered the first time he had heard those words. Standing in an unremarkable barn, on the edge of an unremarkable town, listening to an unremarkable man with a stranger’s face, who was somehow familiar.
Before Sam could formulate a reply the sound of the Impala’s engine gunning to life sent them racing towards the car. Dean barely waited for them to slam the doors before flattening his foot to the floor. As they screeched out of the parking lot, he side-eyed his brother.
‘Trench coat. Suit. As if. I ask you. Is upstairs hiring plain clothes cops these days? Has Columbo joined the ranks of the seraphim? They must be desperate.’
She hardened her stance, ready to announce that she would be informing her supervisor. He had lowered his gaze and was now looking at the table, but his attention was inward – he looked like he was berating himself for something. She knew that look. She saw it in the mirror every morning. She felt her resolve weaken.
He addressed Clare gently. ‘I cannot give her more time. She will die at her appointed hour. But there will be no pain. No confusion.’
Serious blue eyes met his. ‘I trust you, Dean.’ The intense expression softened with one of those rare half smiles. ‘I am sure this car maintenance experience will come in useful one day.’
Castiel straightened and looked at him with surprise, as if his intent should have been obvious. ‘I am…passing the time.’ His habitually serious expression ended any notion that this was any kind of elaborate joke.
Sam stared at his brother. The atmosphere in the room was so tightly balanced he could barely breathe.
‘Leave me be.’ The demon had his hand around Castiel's neck, blade to his throat. He growled. ‘Leave me be or I will kill him.’
Castiel’s focus had been beginning to drift, but this brought his gaze back to Dean’s. ‘I am sorry. It was never my intention to abandon you. I have been foolish.’
.’ Uriel used Dean’s nickname for Castiel with a sneer, and venom that encompassed his opinion of its author, and anyone who sympathised with him. ‘You got your wish.’
‘Look, it’s fine. Don’t make a big issue.’ Dean couldn’t keep his voice entirely under control, and he mentally kicked himself. He waited for Castiel to change the subject, or disappear without warning. To do any of the things Dean was used to. But he didn’t. Even without lifting his eyes from the floor, Dean knew that Castiel was still watching him, could sense that his expression hadn’t changed.
At her gentle tone, he raised his head. Clear blue eyes met hers and her hard won cynicism took a beating. No junkie she’d ever seen had looked like that. She couldn’t sic Joe on this guy. It would be like kicking a puppy. She’d never seen anyone look so completely together, and yet so utterly lost. Dislocated, somehow, as if he’d wandered in from another life. A better life, where diner food was free, and people never got angry.
The expression on Uriel’s face brought him up short. He was toweringly angry, yes, frustrated, impatient, and…something else. Something that had stopped him killing Dean on the spot. Confused? Wary? Surprised? Whatever it was, it had saved Dean’s life.
Joe came up behind her, standing too close as usual, making her jump, and breathing beer fumes on her neck. ‘Is he going to stare at that fucking plate all night? He’s done. Get rid. We need the booth.’
He wondered why Ruby was sticking around. He knew he should object, but his heart just wasn’t in it. The look on her face when he had met her gaze over the crumpled body of Castiel had bought her a little credit in his estimation. And she had, after all, tried to help.
He shot to his feet and stared around. The familiar sense of controlled power, of infinite grace, and that light, coalesced into the figure of a man. The air seemed to settle and the shadow of the wings folded to meet the seemingly normal shadow of the man.
Hours later, Castiel sat alone on the concrete ground, his back to the pillar that Uriel had been leaning on when he first appeared. His sight had improved in that time. He was now able to discern distinct shapes and tones, although colours were still muted.
Since surrendering his grace, this was the closest reflection he had seen. Castiel wondered anew at all he had seen of the Winchester brothers, of all his father’s children.
‘Jesus, Cas, you couldn’t knock? Wear a bell or something? Changing here.’ Dean did his best to conceal the surge of emotion that had greeted his sense of Castiel’s presence.
.’ As if he hadn’t spoken, Uriel snapped out of existence with in a blaze of light so bright Castiel cried out in pain and dropped to his knees, covering his watering eyes.
‘Real enough for you?’ That smile was still playing around Castiel’s lips. ‘Perhaps you should break out the holy water. Just to be certain.’
‘Well,’ Dean was shooting for calm, and patient, and falling badly short on both counts, ‘What is it, exactly, you’re not sure of?’
Touched by an angel. The whole situation was ridiculous. It sounded like some terrible daytime tv movie about a family tragedy. And yet Dean wasn’t even remotely amused. When the angel wasn’t around, Dean could almost make himself believe that none of it had ever happened, that it was still just him and Sammy against the demons, plain and simple, for better or worse. But then he would sleep, and dream, and sooner or later, he would appear. His angel. Castiel.
Dean had been half expecting another heavenly visitation. Uriel, this time, or Anna. A scolding. Maybe even a smiting. Chew them out for losing an angel. Assign them another task. But there was nothing. It was as if, with the death of Castiel, their line to heaven had been cut. It was probably for the best, Dean considered. He couldn’t be held responsible for his actions if he set eyes on Uriel any time soon. Or ever.
‘So,’ Sam continued, feeling an unaccountable desire to keep talking to cover the sudden awkwardness he felt, ‘what’s up? Anything big going down we should know about.’
‘Whoa.’ Dean, wide-awake now, vaulted the bed to put himself between Ruby and the door. ‘Back up a second.’
‘And I do not long for it now. Anael, I have no desire to be human.’ Castiel turned away, and watched for a moment as people walked by, busy with their lives: anxious, happy, fearful, laughing people. ‘And I will never want to be other than in the host of our Father. But I must do this. For my own peace of mind, I must do this. It need only be mere moments. But I must know.’
Clare bristled, suddenly feeling as if she should defend her quiet customer. It was on the tip of her tongue to point out that as the place was half empty, they didn’t, in fact, need the booth, and he was a paying customer, so he could sit as long as he liked. But she wasn’t stupid, or suicidal, and she badly needed the job. Instead she said ‘Sure. No problem, boss.’ And walked across to the booth.
‘You have disassembled parts of the engine that are required for functionality. It appeared to be working adequately. Is there a problem?’ Castiel had moved to join Dean in front of the Impala and was now examining the engine with all the appearance of mechanical know-how.
‘You’re going to be fine.’ Dean gripped Castiel’s hand, holding on so tight he could feel the weakening pulse. Desperation and creeping despair fuelled his next words. ‘Just hang on Cas. Just hold on. Please. Look, I…I need you, okay?’
The Impala screeched to a halt outside one of the seedier looking shops in the immediate vicinity. Sam and Dean stared out of the windscreen at their less than salubrious surroundings.
‘Just watch yourself, that’s all. Don’t let him be too influenced by them. You think demons are bad? At least you know where you are with them. At least they don’t pretend to be holier than thou and full of the love of God and shit.’ Catching Sam’s expression, she sighed. ‘Just keep an eye on him, okay? You think betrayal by a demon is bad? Imagine betrayal by an angel. Lucifer was one of them once.’
‘Uriel,’ Castiel started to speak. The air in the room started to shimmer. Uriel was leaving. Was abandoning him here. ‘No, w
Clare was tired. It was the end of a long shift, at the end of a long day. The diner was starting to empty, and although the other waitresses were still busy, she had only one remaining customer. She was, however, starting to get concerned that he would never leave. He had been staring at his empty plate, unmoving, for a good few minutes now.
‘But I have no money,’ he repeated, with a frown of confusion that just made him look even more hopelessly lost.
Dean had no idea, afterwards, how long they had stood like that, how long he had dampened the shoulder of Castiel’s jacket with tears, how long the angel had simply held him.
It had not hurt. Not physically anyway. The emotional sensation, on the other hand, had been crippling. It was like someone had reached into his chest, and mind, and removed all sense of security and love. All sense of connection, and brotherhood.
She slumped next to the bed and held her mother’s hand, making shushing, comforting noises. Her mom had been crying again. Her grey, hollow cheeks were wet. Clare felt tears start to her own eyes. She was just so
And then Castiel did move. He stepped in front of Dean and gripped him gently by the shoulders, his right hand covering its matching scar in a gesture so unexpectedly intimate and familiar that Dean felt his throat constrict.
Dean stared at the angel for a moment longer, a smile beginning to tug at the corners of his mouth. ‘You know, I think that can wait. For now there are more pressing matters at hand.’ He gestured grandly to the Impala. ‘Getting this baby back into tip top shape, for one.’
It had been three months since he had last seen Castiel. Initially, Dean had been glad not to see him: after all, his visits hardly heralded puppies and ponies and trips to the ice cream shop. And a lack of angels made it easier to pretend that things were normal, that everything was back the way it had been two years earlier, before Sam’s death, before Dean’s deal. But now, as the weeks passed, Dean found himself looking out for that face, that dumb trench coat, the physical presence of Castiel’s vessel, and that shimmering, contained power, like the air before a storm, that heralded Castiel himself.
‘I see.’ Castiel stared intently at the offending engine, and raised a hand. Dean felt the shimmer in the air intensify, a sensation that signalled a build up of angelic power.
‘You’re just wounded, okay? You’ll be fine. Sam’ll be back in just a sec and we’ll get you to a hospital.’
Clare woke to the sound of moaning from the next room: a quiet, ineffably sad keening that rose and fell. She was up and moving towards the door before she was even fully conscious.
Ignoring Dean’s ominous silence, she continued. ‘And we have one other advantage. They don’t know what they have. There hasn’t been a sniff of major demon activity in this area. If anyone important knew there was a fallen angel in the game, we’d be up to our eyes in trouble by now and Lileth right behind. Our only chance at pulling this off is to get him out before they realise what they’ve got.’
‘What’s the point?’ Dean’s jaw was tight. ‘He’s probably already dead. If he’s lucky. If not demons, then just some punk looking to score.’
‘I’m afraid there’s been a change of plan.’ Uriel moved towards him and Castiel suddenly became aware of how they must feel to humans. They looked mortal, but the sense of contained power was palpable. That emotion he had been struggling to identify earlier came into sharp focus. Fear.
Castiel forced himself to abandon that train of thought and concentrate. He needed to find a way to exist on this mortal plane. He needed to arm himself. He could still fight for heaven, even without his angelic strength. An echoing rumble caught his attention and he leapt upright, bracing himself for any form of attack. A second rumble followed the first and he recognised the sound, and the sensation. Castiel slumped, feeling a little sheepish. He was hungry. The thought was actually cheering. This was a mortal weakness he could deal with. He had seen this done enough times. Food. That was all he needed.
Twelve and a half fruitless hours later, the Winchester brothers returned to the motel in varying states of tension and frustration.
For a long moment, he felt Anna watching him. Then she spoke. ‘If it must be done, then I must be the one to do it. One hour, Cas. That’s all.’
And Dean could not imagine anyone else on earth, or in heaven for that matter, whom he would want to have this conversation with less than the sneering warrior angel in front of him. What could he possibly say? How could he explain to Uriel why this was so important, when he didn’t even know himself?
Castiel watched as the Winchester brothers salted the grave of the demon sent by Lileth to retrieve this seal. The fight had been long, and hard, but they had been victorious. He had just spoken with them: to acknowledge their victory, and to inform them that they had been mistaken – that this fight had actually been a decoy, a way for Lileth to keep them at bay whilst she went after her real target. This had not gone down well. Castiel had listened to, and acknowledged their anger, then left to return to his brethren. At least, that had been the plan. Instead he was still here, some little distance away, unseen and unnoticed by either of the brothers.
Dimly, Dean became aware of his surroundings. He was still sitting on the rotten floor of the back room, still holding the body of Castiel. He had no idea how much time had passed. Blinking he looked up, to see Sam, and beside him, her hand in his, Ruby. She was looking at Dean with an expression of sympathy he wouldn’t have credited her with being able to feel.
Nearly a month later, the Winchesters were taking a well-earned lunch break in their usual travel choice of seedy motel, when the air began to shimmer. Dean felt a part of himself tense, and wait for the inevitable influx of shame or embarrassment. After all, the last time he had seen Castiel, he had cried on the angel’s shoulder like a child. But, to his surprise, there was nothing. No embarrassment, no shame; no compunction to greet Castiel’s arrival with anything other than genuine pleasure. Before his conscious mind was even aware he had moved, Dean walked over and embraced Castiel, holding the angel tight. Surprise and pleasure warred for dominance in Castiel’s expression, but his response – to raise his arms and hug back, just as tight, was immediate.
?’ The spell of the moment was instantly broken. Dean instinctively reached up to restore some semblance of order. ‘Not the hair. Do you mind?’
A shadow darkened Castiel’s face. He drew an agonised breath. ‘Since I surrendered my grace, I have not felt the presence of my Father so strongly. I am…afraid.’
Ruby watched him leave, looking more concerned than offended. ‘He really cares about this guy, doesn’t he?’
‘Pass the time of day, as you put it. Understand: we are fighting a war for our very existence, and that of humanity. However, if you feel my time would be better spent here, then obviously I will leave the front lines to come and hold your hand.’
‘Well it’s not like you just pop in to say hi, is it? Pass the time of day? Enquire after our health? Which is fine, by the way,’ Dean waved the demon covered shirt in front of Castiel before pitching it into the corner, ‘hard-ass homicidal demons notwithstanding.’
“Hi, I’m Claire Wesson with the paper, here to follow up on your neighbor’s case, Mr…” she looked at the notes she had of the information she’d gathered. “Braedon.”
By the time Ben woke up, it wasn’t light out yet, but when he tried to open the door, he saw that his duffel bag that was a reminder from his years in wrestling was at the foot of it. He grabbed a change of clothes and went into the common living area, not expecting anyone to be around, but there was Castiel, still in a trench coat and suit.
Castiel was going to reply, but Dean came up, clad in a t-shirt and sweatpants. “Hey, kid. You know, I could’ve got takeout from a diner if you want breakfast. I mean, you came all this way, I might as well treat you a little. No need to make…” he peered at the plate. “You still make cheesy eggs and toast every morning?”
She comes back to the car, making sure Ben tests for retinal flare, before opening the door. “You’re coming up and helping me clean up the mess.”
I said up to Alaska. Just, a family thing came up… listen, it’s just a weird thing with some kid Dean abandoned or something… hey,
The next problem was getting out for a long drive without Mom knowing. He couldn’t let her remember, too. So, he said he was going for a road trip, which wasn’t a total lie. She gave him some money for gas and motels, even.
“Well, yeah. Cas, here, is an angel, and Jack is… away. In Heaven. And I’m sure you remember the demons.”
“There’s a body, that looks just like you, on the floor of the upstairs bathroom. You’re going to get the tarp out of my trunk, and we’re going to wrap it up in it, put it in my trunk, and I’m going to drive it out into the woods, and burn it. Least you can do for me saving your ass.”
Another week, another job. Dean didn’t take as many jobs ever since he almost died fighting vampires, taking it as a sign that his age had gotten to him, and he decided to make an honest man out of himself. Living off credit card scams was fun in his 20s and 30s, but well, now at 42 it wasn’t really fine, so now he was a butcher.
, his features had hardened back out since he left. Harder than when he came back in the middle of the night, despair plain on his face.
She’s falling asleep on the stakeout when there’s a knock on her window. Ben is scared. “Listen, I know what you do, Dean left a gun in my mom’s room, it’s not doing anything. It looks like my mom, but she’s out of town for the weekend on a date.”
“Dean, you are technically a vessel,” Castiel pointed out. “And she’s only a vessel for me.” He turned to Claire. “Shouldn’t you be sleeping?”
“I know, I know, Gabe was your exception, whatever. I mean, Claire’s not going to be the most understanding or sympathetic. Something tells me Ben complaining to
Castiel gave him again. “If you would like me to erase the memory of your kidnapping, I would gladly do so.”
from his kids, so they don’t end up like him. That’s why your mom left me, Ben. It’s not because I didn’t love her, or she didn’t love me. It’s because the monsters under the bed and in the closet? The ghosts scratching your window and the wolves howling at the moon, you never would’ve heard of those, they would’ve never showed up at your doorstep if your mom didn’t know a Winchester.”
“Oh, no, my vessel, once I take it, it loses all its physical needs. Heat, cold, sleep, eating.” The angel shrugged. “Shouldn’t you still be asleep?”
Sam nudged Ben. “He fidgets with cars when he’s nervous. Just let him.” He got a slice of pepperoni chucked at his head for that.
“I’m pretty sure,” Ben piped up. “You know, for someone who freaked out the second I looked at a gun, you sure do seem to still have a lot in that clunker of yours.”
“Next time you get in trouble, you text me, okay?” She returned the phone after taking a selfie as the contact picture and snapping one of Ben for her phone. “Dean obviously has some issues with whatever you have going on, so what we’re not going to do is make him worry. Guy’s retired.”
Claire rolled her eyes. “Jimmy, for all the shit I gave him, talked to about five priests before he got it, and then pulled me out of Catholic school because he didn’t want things to be hard for me.”
Which was how Claire was put on the job of a demon killing in central Indiana—the literal meaning of the middle of nowhere. The “H” in nowhere. She knew being a Hunter didn’t lead to a lot of exactly urban centers but, well, Cas said it was somewhere he and Dean couldn’t return to, ground too well-worn.
I know what kind of business you have going on here, and you’re nice and all, but I’m not feeling too hot. It might be better for you to come back later?”
After all, what a waste of time it was, to stay in school when he was too stupid to even sit still and too unruly and bad mouthed to deal with teachers who were never giving him the chance to even speak up at their stupid questions. He was just a pretty new face in a sea of idiots, what did he know about physics? He was just another nameless student who would stay low for his entire life, unimportant, a nobody, who cared about his take on 1984? Who was to say that he could even read something like 1984, let alone retain a single concept in that small dumb undoubtedly illiterate brain of his?
Right on cue, the young waitress arrived at the table, smiling kindly and placing the plates in front of them. The content consisted of a disk of beef meat over various vegetables and some dairy cheese, closed inside two slices of levitated bread and rectangular and long shaped potatoes. Humans called each
The angel had never felt more worshipped as when he was in his hunter’s arms and this was no exception. It was thrilling, addicting, the knowledge that such a man deemed him worthy of his prayers and of his adoration.
And with Jack being the All-Mighty, ruling the world, making sure that everything was pretty and good? Well, now that his son was in charge, Dean could finally ease. He could put the gun away, unafraid and happy. Hell, he’d definitely be able to eat to his heart’s content, now that he didn’t have to care about his ‘
Hell, he had even told the angel how he sometimes liked to put on Taylor Swift on shuffle and just feel, only to be met with a simple nod of his head and a murmured ‘
"YES, IT IS! You're supposed to be one of the good guys!". In every story, in every book, on every movie, angels were the force good, there to help and protect humans. Yet an actual freaking angel sat there in front of him, admitting that he'd kill whoever to finish his job. All of Dean's truths and beliefs fell down.
Dean took in the moment of distraction to check on the other sleeping form now sprawled out on the backseat, noticing how Jack had now turned on his stomach with his leg up in the air, against the door frame at a rather odd angle that could have been comfortable only for him.
He was tired whenever he was stranded on a case, no one answering his phone calls to give him tips and help, all of them busy with their lives: Sammy off to college, living the life he deserved; Bobby furious for some reason with John, even though deep down Dean knew it had all been his fault; and John Winchester away, with a second family that wasn’t as fucked up as the first.
So, Dean allowed himself to cry, to rage, to despair. There was no one listening, no one to pray to. He was alone in the Universe, just him and his pain.
Castiel evoked the same feelings that shy boy did, that a lot of boys and girls did during the years. And for the first time, John Winchester wasn’t around to dictate and punish him.
One second, the hunter was about to start blushing at the entire situation, trying to think of a joke to ease the tension he could feel building up inside of his body, and the next he was ready to throw his whole soul out as the room around him slightly spun and quickly disappeared. They were at the monster’s hideout and then they weren’t. Some kind of angelic mojo had warp speed them in front of his motel room. Granted, it was the only one in that small town, but he never said the number of the room out loud, which made him think angels could actually read minds.
Dean is still hunting him through Purgatory (The place he had escaped to) but he's gonna give up soon once he sees some pretty flowers and decides to bring them back to Castiel. Crowley eventually got back to Hell 'cause he couldn't allow his mom to embarrass him in front of Bobby, who went down with his rifle to shoot at homophobes.
His fingers kept on toying with each other over his knees, digging with his blunt nails at the skin of their beds, until their innate warmth was about to escape, ready to wet his fingertips.
There were diluted spots of dried dirty blood all over, in a pattern that had once been clear and visible, before feet had walked all over it, smudging and ruining it. He had worried with details and precision, not even a full hour prior, but now he couldn’t care less.
Dean watched for one more moment the way the shadows played over Cas’ features, the way light seemed to be drawn to him, almost creating a halo of sorts. His own personal celestial wavelength. “Yeah, let’s go. We’re too old to make out on the backseat of a car anyway.”
Deep breaths, those always seemed to calm him, since he was young, but now they did nothing. With each exhale, he felt like he was letting a part of Cas leave, like he was saying goodbye to himself too.
“This is Jimmy Novak. He accepted to be my vessel for this mission and he, indeed, is 31 years old and those are his work clothes. And I believe he would disapprove of you slicing his shirt."
At that, Dean turned towards the angel so quickly and violently, he had to thank the seatbelt he had just latched on to prevent him from crashing onto the angel's body. Not that he would've particularly minded. "What the fuck did you just say?"
There was no mistaking Dean’s smile. His lips stretched widely, he became luminous. He was a beautiful sight, and Castiel desperately wanted to be able to witness it for eternity. “Very much,” he replied, closing once again the gap between them by bringing their lips together.
Besides, he needed them to remind himself of his faults. He had managed to destroy the only good thing that had ever happened to him, to crush his only chance at true peace. Not only did he drive Cas away with his bullshit over and over again, always fearing he’d never come back and always surprised when he did, but now Cas was dead because of him, because he hadn’t stabbed that son of a bitch and because he hadn’t been brave enough to let Michael in all those damned years back.
He was not truly satisfied with the direction their conversation had taken, but decided to remain silent as the hunter also did not make an effort to speak.
I really do, you’re the older brother I never wanted but got stuck with. And I’m so fucking happy for you, ‘cause you and Cas are the best people in the entire world and you deserve all the happiness you can get.
“You’re right. It was Chuck all along,” Dean nodded, removing himself from their shared embrace to continue pacing around the room, a wild look crossing over his wonderful eyes. “We never should’ve left Sam and Jack. We should be there with them now.” A bitter laugh came out of him, a weak sound that froze Castiel’s blood in his veins, if he was using the metaphor correctly.
He had to stop himself before he said something he might have regretted. He walked on dangerous territory, constantly, and he was afraid that his damn mouth would get him killed someday, possibly by someone close-minded close to him.
“BLEACH! LIKE, ACTUAL FUCKING BURNING ACID DRIPPING DOWN MY EYES, I AM SCARRED FOR LIFE!” Sam continued to cry out like a banshee, but his voice was growing more distant with every new repetition of the word ‘
The Shadow was just amused with his reaction, fanning over him as if he was a panicked infant, whose confusion and dread brought them happiness.
She took her time with her reply, crackling to herself as she kept on tapping on his screen, tilting the device away from Dean’s line of sight. “He’s angry that we went to Gwynn Castle without inviting him.”
But Castiel seemed to be able to dethrone him. He was still as cool as a breeze, no sign of discomfort or intoxication, except the fact that he was calmer than earlier and that he was quite loose-lipped.
Apparently, even in alternate universes where no human could stay, his knees were still weak and fragile as they were on Earth.
While there were many quests resting over their shoulders, neither of them cared. Not when they had finally found the words they had both been missing.
And, even if by some rotten luck, he had managed to overpower all of his enemies, destroy all the monsters that populated his path and win all of his battles, that didn’t mean he was able to finish this.
And he had been in both places countless times, enough to know that there weren’t too big differences, especially in the bureaucracy. Demons sucked, Angels sucked, and they all had some deep agenda that somehow put him and Sam in the middle of their bickering.
"If that would make you feel less uncomfortable, yes I suppose we could. But I am afraid I do not understand that reference."
See, Crowley? What they did and still do? That’s flirting. Me and you, it ain’t it. So shut the fuck up.
After having cleaned up the mess they had created with the demon, they moved on to a diner close-by. Dean should’ve realized he was whipped the second the Angel had ordered a slice of pie with a passion that might’ve rivalled Dean’s.
Usually, after three drinks his previous drink-buddies would get all foggy and become way less interesting: his father got morose and sad, his hunter friends that he saw on the road got uncoordinated and messy, even Bobby got glassy-eyed as he talked about his fondest memories. All while he could just begin to feel the calm spread through his veins, his perpetual state of anxiety burning alongside his throat at the liquor.
His hands balled into fists at his sides and he rose them up, punching the door at a mere inch from his face. He needed to scream, to yell, to cry out at the unfair Universe who just kept taking and taking from him, never granting him a break, not even after gaining the so desperately fought for free will.
Even if all of their friends and family already knew him and knew pretty much everything about him. But hey! A man should be allowed his pretend secrecy!
Now, I present you: Samuel Winchester! Who’s gonna tell us all about that time, not long ago, when Dean accidentally lit himself on fire setting up Christmas decorations.
' and Castiel had never had either, therefore his curiosity was incredibly high, while he maintained his expectations low and in check.
It could’ve been Cas checking in, but he had already called him as they drove past Belleville, telling him that they’d be there in an hour and that they were all famished, having left Arrington first thing in the morning, stopping only for gas refills and bathroom breaks, just like old times.
The road had always been his home, welcoming and nice and quiet in the dead of the night. After all, he had slept more nights in the backseat of his car than in beds anyways and his back had used to the weird shape he somehow managed to find comfortable in the tiny space, getting smaller and smaller with every inch he grew. It was also way cleaner than the cheap dirty motels they’d be forced to stay at, at least having a roof over their heads from time to time. It smelled nicer too: leather and gunpowder and silver knives. There was the metallic scent of dried out blood somewhere, probably still on his clothes from earlier, but he didn’t care.
‘You prayed. For me.’ He looked up again, and the expression on his face was one Dean had never seen there before: gratitude, and a deep affection. Dean felt his breath catch, and found himself unable to speak.
The bald statement of the blindingly obvious, forgotten in the heat of his anger, brought Dean up short, and took some of the edge off his rage, but not his desperation.
Castiel stopped cleaning and turned his habitually serious gaze on Dean. ‘I think it most appropriate.’
The familiar feeling of shimmering air surrounded the car. Dean, leaning over the engine, almost banged his head on the bonnet in an effort to be upright.
Ruby’s information had been sketchy, but worrying enough. Rumour had reached her that an angel had fallen, and had been abandoned by his kind on Earth. Her source, relating this as the least likely of many unlikely stories currently doing the rounds, had particularly enjoyed passing on the description of the so-called angel.
‘They’re small time. Seriously. Demons aren’t known for their sociability as a general rule’ she waited an almost infinitesimal pause, as if waiting for a wisecrack, and when none was forthcoming, continued ‘and these guys stick together for a reason. They’re none of them strong enough alone. There have only been a few abductions in this town over the past few years. My guess is they take people to feed on and keep them alive for as long as possible.’
. Mentally he willed Castiel to disappear. To bring up Lilleth. To declare the earth to be in immediate mortal peril. To do anything but continue to stand there, looking at him.
‘Anna.’ The handsome face of his vessel was earnest, and deadly serious. ‘How can we, how can I, not take this risk? How can we continue to fight this war without truly understanding for whom, and why, we fight? What victory can there be if what is left is a pale shadow of humanity? We must know if, and how, they can survive if our worst fears are realised.’
‘My apologies. I…we…the war does not go well. But that is not, as you rightly point out, a reason to be…pissy.’
The demon, unnerved, took advantage of their distraction to create the only other distraction he could think of. He took the blade from Castiel’s throat and drove it cleanly through his chest.
As he watched the brothers trudge, separate, unspeaking, back to the car, Castiel felt a long-absent certainty settle on him. He knew what he would do, and whom he would ask to help.
‘Castiel raised him from hell. I think it created…. a bond, of sorts. I don’t really know.’ A shadow crossed Sam’s handsome face. ‘He doesn’t talk about it.’
‘Yes. Would this be an appropriate juncture for me to also enquire after your health?’ Castiel’s expression didn’t change, but Dean was almost sure he saw a flicker of humour in those blue eyes.
But something in his demeanour was just…wrong. He might look like a stockbroker, or an accountant, but only if that guy had just lost his job and had his wife walk out on him, all in the same day. He seemed to radiate loneliness, and a kind of profound despair that, in spite of her own problems, made her want to walk over and take his hand. Tell him that everything would be all right.  Something else was weird too: something wasn’t quite right about his age. He looked young, sure, but there had been a depth in the look that had met hers that belonged to a person much, much older. Almost a kind of agelessness, even.
Castiel stopped in front of Dean and regarded him seriously. Dean stared at him, frozen to the spot, as if any movement would shatter the illusion. For a long moment, Castiel stood as if waiting for a reaction. When none was forthcoming, he reached out a hand and ruffled Dean’s hair.
Dean crossed the distance to Uriel in two strides, and stopped inches from his face. ‘I don’t give a fuck about you, or your victory,’ he snarled, ‘I’m gonna ask again:
The sound of her own name, spoken aloud in her otherwise empty apartment in the middle of the night, should have filled her with panic. Instead she merely looked around, blinking, for the source of the sound. A man was standing at the foot of her mother’s bed. She squinted at him in confusion.
Sam felt as if he had crossed into some weird parallel universe. One in which Dean went around hugging people, and sharing his food.
Castiel looked unchanged. Every fold of the coat was in place, and no stain of blood marred the handsome face of his vessel. He met Dean’s stunned gaze and smiled. A genuine, unCastiel-like smile of pleasure.
Sam said, ‘Look, he was your brother, your fellow soldier. If you can’t interfere, then at least let us help. What harm can it do?’
Dean could suddenly feel his heart, hammering in his chest. The fear, suddenly, was not for Castiel, or for Sam, or for his life, which he knew even now was tight in Uriel’s unforgiving grip. This was fear of something else. After all these years hunting with Sam, after everything they had been through, one thing had remained constant: Dean’s level of discomfort with his deepest, most private emotions. Confessing his feelings, whatever they might be: despair, pain, grief, and even - no,
“We had too many close calls and I’m getting too old for this shit. I almost got taken out by a vamp and a piece of rebar. You know what that would’ve been if I went out like that? Embarrassing.”
“Only because Dean told me to. He said as long as you knew who he was, someone would always come after you. The wall must’ve gotten so fragile, over ten years.” He placed a hand on Ben’s head, and more flashes ran through him, and he only made a curious
Dean stood up and went to the fridge, pulling out a beer. “Hey, can I have one?” Dean gave him a look, then obviously did some math in his head, and shrugged, getting out another.
He shook his head. “Sorry, I wish I could be more help, but everything seemed normal. The Oldhams were a normal old couple.”
“Awhile, in hunter years.” Dean didn’t want to say they’d been in a relationship since before he got back with Lisa. It wasn’t fair.
stupid, huh?” there’s no hesitation as she plunges the silver knife into the shifter’s heart. “I don’t take time for questions, dumbass.”
“Convenience store. For some eggs, cheese, maybe an onion? Bread.” And, with a fluttering sound, the angel had disappeared. That had scared the crap out of him, but he managed not to scream. But, just as he had recovered, he did make a small yelp when Cas had returned. “What kind of man is in his forties and doesn’t cook?” he muttered, hoping for a pan, and finding one, taking a knife and cutting up a little bit of onion.
“It was going to kill you, wait for your mom to get home, and kill her, because it thought the two of you had
“Come on, that was eleven years ago, dude. You know how much gray matter even one exorcism takes up?”
trying to justify how what he did wasn’t abandoning them. Ben wasn’t his kid, it was only a year, it was the only way to keep them safe without dragging them into the life, but at the end, it wasn’t the road to Heaven that was paved with good intentions. In some ways, he felt like how John had treated Adam. Only around when it was convenient. Hell, that’s how John treated Sam and Dean, too. The difference was, Adam was a convenience for John to look like he had a normal life. Sam and Dean were conveniences in John’s hunt for revenge.
‘Look, I don’t know what your deal is, but I know you’re not a bad person. And somewhere there must be people who care about you. Take my advice, okay? Just go home. Whatever it is, it will be okay. Go home.’ She pressed two twenty-dollar bills into his hand. He stared at her in stunned silence for a moment, then said, ‘Thank you.’ His voice was not quite steady, and Clare imagined, although she didn’t have the courage to look, that he might really have been crying this time. She turned and ran back to the diner.
‘Hey, I never claimed to be angel boy’s biggest fan. And in case you didn’t notice the antipathy is mutual. I can’t imagine him busting a gut to help me, can you?’
‘Castiel, you have never been without your grace. You have ever known the presence of heaven.’ Anna weighted her words as much as she could. There must be no misunderstanding. ‘Can you imagine what it would be like without it?’
‘Uriel.’ Castiel was more than a little perturbed to see his brother. His agreement with Anna had been that none of the others would be told. Her role had been to remove his grace and conceal that removal until it was restored. Only then would any of the others know. ‘Where is Anna?’
Sam, who had been about to take his first bite of a sandwich when Castiel shimmered into being, stopped in mid gesture, hand frozen in the air, to stare in disbelief. Nevertheless, he was the first to break the silence.
‘Me and Sam. You’d better tell me – Sam’s with Bobby, I’ll have to call him, get him over here, finish up with the car.’ Dean was talking quickly as he put the Impala’s engine back into working order. ‘Look, maybe it would be better if Sam met me there.’ Suddenly aware of Castiel’s unresponsiveness, Dean looked up, to see the angel regarding him with that rare almost-smile.
