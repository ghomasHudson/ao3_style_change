Returning to the flat, John hastily headed to get ready while Sherlock slid back on his chair, placing his slender fingers back in the posture that they landed in when Sherlock headed to the mind palace.
,"  John answered, he couldn't fathom why he'd answered in those words that didn't even form a proper sentence or phrase. The two stepped closer to the road and Sherlock waved the taxi over. Though it was dark, it didn't mean the abundance of cars on the road were of small size. They stepped in, Sherlock first, John shut the door, telling the driver the golden address before the comfortable--yet just a tad uncomfortable--silence (due to the cumbersome reply, that was on John's part)
"John Watson!" The man waved, a huge grin on his face. His hands were waving to 'John Watson' and Watson stepped closer.
"It wouldn't be another way." Sherlock smiled at John.
"I heard you were also in a coma for a while," John stated and turned to the man in the long jacket.
His sister, Harriet Watson wasn't drunk, unlike the thousands of times, he told Sherlock of his sister who had to get drunk every time, a burden on him. The sister Sherlock had called John's brother. The sister Sherlock had hissed at, getting the one detail wrong. The one sister— John's breath almost hiccuped, he didn't need to think about Sherlock, he didn't
After a couple of beat and a hum of interest from the man with dark curls, they scanned John with their eyes like a metal detector, then they asked: "Afghanistan or Iraq?" The man asked, not batting an eye, only glancing up when John tried not to laugh, getting an equally amused expression, from the person with John's phone in their hands.
"Good, I found a nice little place in central London, together we ought to afford it." They walked towards the door. Finding the man had a scarf fully knotted on and jacket draped over his lean body shape like silk. "We'll meet there tomorrow evening at 7 o'clock," He told John, "Sorry, I gotta dash, I forgot my riding crop in the mortuary." He finally said, opening the door.
"Sherlock! You bloody git!" John whispered, as his eyes drew a line of the blurs that passed the opposite opening of the alley-way, which was his cue to run. John blinked a couple of times as he chased after the two, his jacket flowing in the wind, not as much as Sherlock's of course.
"John." A voice came from behind him, he spun around to find a soaked Mycroft. His soaked suit seemed to mirror the older Holmes's expression, wary and tired, even more so than before. The blonde's eyes drifted down, noticing their stance.
"John, Sherlock was never real, he... was just a figment of your imagination." John heard and looked up, and soon enough, the world cracked and spilled a black color that carried him away, like a child on a sled, a bright red sled with white stripes. Not before he heard seven words that left him to close his eyes in defeat, complete and utter defeat.
The doctor had gone through a few jackets through the years he knew Sh—
John never questioned why Mycroft had sent him to Scotland Yard, the soft, clinking objects in his left pocket and an unmoving expression that even he didn't know he could make. He entered the building, appearing in front of Anderson and Donovan, who both seemed to miss something in their eyes, something fierce.
"Great, another sleek, black thin--" John furrowed his eyebrows, picking it up gingerly, he popped off the cap, what he saw was the top of a flash drive.
He sat down in his chair, asking 'Sherlock' questions in murmurs and hisses of reality slapping him on the face with a knife. He did the one thing that he could do without bursting into tears like cascades to waterfalls.
"A puzzle!" John grinned before he heard the clock ticking and he shut his mouth in a sudden realization of the echoing words that most likely was heard not just by him.
"John!" He stopped, every grey cloud to any black cloud being pushed over with an airplane that cut through his mind. He heard a voice.
John grabbed his jacket and flew out the door with the known forbidden object in his hand. Sherlock seemed to know this moment was to happen. The man called Angelo to return the cane to him during the case. Was he a fraud? That question was shot away by his handgun, he was for certain Sherlock was one of smartest people on this planet.
voice of Mike Stamford. Brown suit, tan jacket, striped tie, and glasses perched on his nose. The rounded face couldn't have made John's heart drop further down his throat. Everything turned. It was taking a pencil and rewinding the cassette tape. Mike was the reason he and Sherlock met!
His eyes closed to stand in front of the man's upturned collar that caressed his face. He had worn the same jacket, John hesitated his thoughts like a car crash, his breath came along with the movement of his eyes, he had worn the jacket with the collar turned...
"Fuckin' Sherlock... you--
—John licked his lips, a bitter taste crawling to the edges of his mouth. The jacket, the black jacket with the pockets and turned-down collar.
that it was to be turned. Just like that, he twisted the top while holding the bottom, earning him a satisfying '
John plugged in the flash drive before he heard a well-known low, baritone voice of his good friend/consulting detective/flatmate and maybe he'll admit... his oh, so teenage high-school love-story
"Um, anything else?" John had to hold back a chuckle. He felt the room was coming to a blissful conclusion. With the words repeated in a mantra, the other man smiled, with a glance from him, he just replied:
John hummed in deep thoughts as he read the clock.
!" She added on as if it were to offend Sherlock in a way, though they both knew Molly wasn't one for that.
"You are not going to just--" John hissed, wide-eyed before Sherlock pulled out another gun.
" Molly's voice was somewhat giddy and warm in her excitement. "
"I had this friend... Sherlock Holmes... we would solve crimes and... go... then go out for dinner." John finally told her after the ticks of silence that left his brain screaming for words, something to say, a voice to tell him that it would be...
"Hey, John." The man greeted him, a sigh could only escape from the ex-army doctor's lips. Lestrade stared at John's hand which held the badges. "That bastar—" He sighed before his towering demeanor tumbled to the ground with a ruckus in a moment of lengthy glances at John's hands, which contained the badges.
His walk to the coffee shop was made into a voyage across the seas, a small sailboat making a slow climb towards the little shop. He glanced inside, a girl in a brown ponytail sat with a coffee in his hands. Dark liquid swimming inside the white cut. Was that... black with two sugars? He looked away, stepping forward and heading to meet the women in a lab coat.
... It's six in the morning!" John rubbed his forehead as he replied to the taller man.
"Ah, yes. Got out a couple of weeks ago." Sherlock replied, loosening his wool scarf. The smile on his face was very evident. "Dr. Watson—" Holmes held out his hand, which John noticed Sherlock was wearing a pair of leather gloves, —I believe we've met before then?" Sherlock said to John, and finally, they couldn't stop the corners of their mouths from twitching as it turned to a fit of laughter.
"Gah! Sherlock,
"John?" He heard a voice come from the side of his bed... his hospital bed. He glanced down, seeing the pure white blanket that reminded him of a child's toy. Pure, eye-burning white, a wildfire. Even back in his Afghanistan days, the blankets were stained in dirt and grime, something he felt defined him.
Sherlock stepped out his own cab and stood next to the ex-army doctor with a neutral expression.
"This is my friend, John Watson." A smiley Mike Stamford introduced, his round face shining. John smiled right as he, himself nodded.
. John glanced at his left hand, the waves of hot water stung fingers. He was just realizing that his flatmate had truly changed something inside him,
" Sherlock paused, his eyes showing him running his fingers through a dictionary to find the right word for him.
"John, Afghanistan..." Harry's eyes move towards the window and tears streamed down her face. "It took you years." Her body shook like his tremor, as she had handed him some dog tags with words he could recite even if he was deafened. Those words had been blocked out with 'brilliant' and 'amazing' until his brain pulled a switch and he stopped in his spot.
"Yes, but you aren't sleeping, so why complain?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow before giving a smile, but to John's knowledge, the smile was nervous, but John realize it was Sherlock sending signs of a response to the video.
“True, but we also used to do a lot of things.” John offered, unsure if anything he said could be interpreted as comforting or if he was destined to ramble from the start. “We
So the least he could do was make scrambled eggs, toaster waffles and cut up grapes while they had the time of their lives.
And John figured that would be the end of it. What else was there to do besides wait for the day and hope she didn’t throw a temper tantrum in the chair?
“Put out your arm, now.” John ordered, and Sherlock didn’t fight John as he found a decent vein and cleaned the injection site before administering the starting dose they had agreed upon. He was anxious, as his impulse was to give Sherlock whatever the bloody hell necessary to provide him relief, but the doctor within John prevailed.
“So, you’re admitting it was a bad one, then?”
Now, all Sherlock needed was his partner to remain available to be a caregiver instead of in a therapist’s office in the middle of an ego trip. Could he not just do that? Why was it so bloody hard for John to wrap his mind around even when he could recite the facts like he knew how to make tea.
“SILENCE”
This seemed to explode withing the poor man and rebuild him in less than a minute:
And the sound of it, the way it came out, John’s expresion with eyes fixed on his, it was one thousand times the climax of a drugs shot.
“What?”
‘I need those results as fast as it is fisicly possible’
“No, not me. It was not me. I wouldn’t have found you if it wasn’t for him. So much for a dog”
To wich Lestrad responded
"The first corpse was so carefully copied that we didn't distinguish them. The second and the third one no longer had John's war scar, but still looked very much alike, clothes and all. This one has less care on the clothes... And keeps her breasts. They didn't even hold them, they just let the clothes cover them..."
“Uh… I came to tell you to leave as all rest in peace you bloddy stalker!”
And it had no wrapping, nor a plate… not even a paper sheet.
“…ah… a body. A corpse, Sherlock”
It was somewhere in the caos of the flat. He had been trying to locate it since he was flashed by the bastard with the phone.
He wanted to be closer to her. He really did. No idea why. Maybe it was the fact that she reminded him of a happier time in his life? Or the fact that she was John’s and he was the only one who could really tell her of him…?
So he texted Mycroft, feeling quite betrayed for having to recur to him.
“Bullocks”
Sherlock texted Lestrade again.
And, very low, without moving his lips, sherlock answered.
This was already a fact, from yesterday. Why was he still wondering about it?
“No. I tested it several times… and it… didn’t work”
At last, he had a brilliant idea: he run out to the drug store, and tried a new one: cloroform.
And at least three were not real. But perhaps… perhaps one…
He couldn’t think. He needed a fix.
“…But John… somehow, did it. He did it again and again, no matter how far Sherlock went or what he did, John just… followed. He knew exactly what to say, and when he didn’t know he would just… trust him. How did he do it?”
“You…”
“What?”
“Yes, and even so, you seemed to be suspicious of the first body, but you did let them bury it. And you were fighting with Dog’s family over Dog’s family already, hum?”
“Oh, god”
Sherlock walked off, nearly run to the cab, being chased by the other making annoying questions. When he finally sat inside, he was flashed by the cameras. There were more paparazzis now. He didn't really care that much for the photos. This would just add to all the others he kept finding everyday, everywhere, specially since John had died, with quotes like "Detective too depressed to go back to work" Or "Detective's blogger vacant not up... why" and stupid theories as for why John had been killed...
It was ovbious it was a lie, but he didn’t want to complicate more things by getting Sherlock into jail. Whatever he was doing, it had o be part of the case. It had to be.
“Molly, look!”
…and she did not dare look at his eyes.
“No, no. That’s not the odd part”
“I’m already here”
“Out. …Just… I can not work, and I can’t talk to you right now. So out you go”
Even when I myself told him it was true. All throu two years. He just choose not to believe it”
Actually, he had been like her third parent, and was the only one left…
“…I got a place. The place. I got them”
He assured her he was in perfect conditions (exagerating a little here, with the obvious intention to calm her down) and told her to come visit for dinner.
"So?"
It was his subconscious, always working mind, or just coincidence, that it went through the glass of the window, and into the street.
“Great news! John is probably still alive!”
“Yes you did”
He held John’s hand against his mouth and breathed deeply throug his nose
“two? I thoug it was just one”
“thanks” He muttered when he got part of his voice back.
Said the man while walking inside without even bothering to ask. He let the old lady to the other old lady “Hi, we met at the funeral…” And went on search for the baby.
It was a phone ringing. His phone. He preferred texting, but given his state he just crawled a bit and palmed the floor for it.
Sherlock tried to remember the last thing he had said to John. It was irrelevant, but somehow it was important, and… No.
“I got it. I got a…”
“What good are you if you… you watch, but don’t help? How may you PROTECT me and let him die!?”
But he still did in one condition: he would visit Rosi every day in hopes that she would get used to him and not make a fuss when she was finally translated.
“Uh… yes!” he snifed a bit “Just… dizzy… don’t stop driving, just get me home… no wait, wait! To the new scotland yards building…”
“How dare you” She spilled at him with poison on her voice “How dare you not only to come back here, but do it with…it”
What would be of her?
“Of course. I… just hope there is still space in your… routine, for me. Even if you, perhaps, just need help with the child?”
“I was back”
“You guys are just made for each other right”
But they didn't get Guard 3. Nor 4. Not in time, at least.
Oh, wait. Molly wasn’t there. She was at the burial too.
She certainly had. After Molly’s death, John had fallen back into depression, and he hadn’t been capable of taking care of a child, so he had given her up temporaly.
“he… ugh. He is an arsehole! He has no idea how to treat people, he… is just…”
“Yes you were”
After all, what use is provoking a reaction, if you don’t have a camera to catch it?
…Oh right. Lestrade was on vacations, for John’s funeral, and John couldn’t help him, cause he was dead, and it didn’t really matter how hard he worked on solving it, this was still hapening.
Oh, right. The kid.
“The track divides: here’s probably were they dispersed. Don’t worry that’s why we got five dogs: one for each missing target”
…more precisely, a certain someone, whoever was responsible for taking John from them, and not content with that, killing someone else to give them as a joke.
He needed a fix.
Doc tried a different aproach: he pointed at the copies.
Sherlock turned for the door, the corpse meaning nothing to him anymore, as it was no longer John, but one more dead extranger that happened to look like him…
…But what would be of her? Would they really give her to Harry?
He took his sweet time to, slowly, get up and onto his feet, and then took a shower, carefully, not to die in the atempt.
“Understand, we need to work and we are all…”
One could understand the need for space and rest after being throu a traumatic situation, but this was not the case with John Watson.
“I take it you must be so upset by the…tragic death of your blogger, Mr. Holmes…”
“What do you mean miscalculation? You don’t miscalculate dna, you read it. Did you read it wrong? What could possibly go wrong?”
Molly made a hatefull, ironic expression he had never seen on her
“They do move around our working space”
He texted Lestrade with the most probable deductions that could be useful and then…
There could be millions of operated victims on that video and Sherlock could still tell.
“Right. I’ll…”
Molly tried to follow him with dumbfolded eyes
Sherlock finished writing, and he repeated the video just to make sure he hadn’t miss anything. His flooding mind caught on every detail, again: John seemed underfed, filty, stressed. He had a bruise on the side of his face and marks on his hands.
He found himself facing friends and beloved ones of John, and he had to talk to them of what had happen. He tried to hide the way he trembled.
“I may be annoying but you, fat prick have cameras all around my street. You tell me where’s John or I will tell Mommy”
Guard 2 was in the room when Sherlock and the others saw the video. So was Guard 5.
“I am no longer working in that case… and I doon’t care how many more dead John’s you find, nor how did they die”
John’s baby. The baby he had with Mary.
The sudden great news, blended with the fear of them being in vane, and this odd man who had been so important for John, carelessly entering her place, to hold Rosie on his arms and move around the room like it was a slow, classic dance, while talking to her like she was a bloddy grown up…
“Sorry?”
And on the other side of the table, against the wall there were four chairs.
“Guess you won’t be eating salad for a while now”
“But why the other murders?” Sherlock intentionaly ignored the dialoge over the baby, as he didn’t want Rosie into any of this
“Yes. Yes I don’t know what is your plan, becouse I am not as smart as you but I know you care for him, even if you pretend you don’t. I know you will not let him die, like you left the six others to be picked up by my men”
“Am… gunshot, front, up close…”
This was what John had been like before dying right? The killer got him now just to laught at him.
“Fuck the press. I haven’t given up on the child jet and!” Sherlock crouched over the table, closer to Mycroft’s face “I have proof that we need that body to take more proof from it. We have no dna, we need…”
She was interrupted by another door shutting aggressively.
“Oh, no I can not know for sure but basing myself on the percentage the posibilities offer I am deducing the real John is probably alive! He is alive!”
Sherlock woke up slowly, painfully, in a mess of a place that once had been his room.
“I take it you are under a lot of stress… hadn’t you just been on vacations?”
They drove away, but before one hour had pass the sound of a helicopter disturbed the tense silence. Doc sweared and demanded for the truk to stop.
Sherlock leaned in and held him in a tight embrace, like he needed to feel him breathing against his chest, and both stood like that for what could seem like hours, even if the would would wreck around them.
That couldn’t be!
“…I think so”
“He had bruises here” Sherlock shook the hand like it was an obvious clue
He breathed it in, deeply, and and his mind felt blank and nice for a few seconds…
He had been there from the moment she had been born. Earlier, even. During the pregnacy… and babies colect sounds while in the womb, so they can recognice familiar voices after birdth…
He pointed it up to the face of the young man, managing a second of stiff peace. Then, with a shift motion, used it to push him unceremoniously towards the door, where the girl still made a last attempt at recording something.
Mrs. Hudson hadn’t seen him. Neither Lestrade.
“I refuse to take that as an  answer. I need this. It is for my job, for John, and for my sanity! Mycroft… please!”
Soon, Sherlock noticed he had run out of work to do here, and he was just making excuses. He wanted to be there. He was ansious for the results…
They had to give him a gentle push so that he would notice that it all was about to end, and it was his time to give a speech, and throw a handful of sand in there.
“So, I am now doing something usefull and working with new cases”
Deep breath
“…exaggerating”
Crap.
“Pal, you sure you don’t wanna go to the hospital?”
Mycroft stood on his seat, like a bushiness man, and didn’t react.
“Bussy. Find someone else for whatever you need”
“Inspector Lestrade. When you went to see him, did you notice something… odd? …like…signals of possible… efects of drugs?”
Sherlock let a small silence pass before he answered
“Since we decided to adopt”
“What?”
Sherlock felt confused and dizzy and like his tounge (wich had an odd taste) had been asleep.
“You were married and we solved a crime on the wedding, two, actually, and I had to give an speech for the guests…”
He also had a higer pitched voice than john's
And so, tiny Molly strugled to push him out and ignored everything he had to say untill he was, finally, out.
“No. No, listen I want her. I want to take care of her. I will do it”
Molly tried to say something, but she didn’t find words in time, and, (as she was a civiliced creature and would not snarl at him) she slapped him again, hard, with the back of the hand.
And this one was very different.
The police team a few feet down and scatered irregularily around spoke on the radio and comunicated wih the helicopter that still floated above the trees, too thick to see throu.
He wanted a distraction. His body had been at tension and his mind in distress for so long…
He jumped on place, spoon around and claped his hands. Then, he shouted.
He calculated the possibilities:
Said Molly. And Sally walked out of the place. She didn't have to say it: Sherlock was intelligent enough to know exactly what she was thinking.
“Mrs. Hudson please, sue them and tell anyone who comes by I’m not taking any case”
“He didn’t drink. He was very careful to drink not much given his dislike of his sister’s addiction. And he did not smoke. Did you clean the body? How did you do it? Why does it smell of…” sniff “Tobaco and alcohol”
“I refuse to apologize for a salad!” Was last thing Sherlock had said, before starting to play the violin, rather aggressively.
“mhm”
“Sherlock. Calm down”
“Did you check his war scar?”
No. Annoying was that Mrs. Hudson told him he had clients waiting for him.
Sherlock shut the door with a bang that made the whole wall tremble.
…and got hit with a book on his face.
The video was on. And it was a few seconds of blank panic before anyone could understad what was on screen. What it all meant.
‘make sure to know how did the press find out any detail form the investigation’
“Even if he is feeling a bit unsure of taking you back in so soon, don’t worry, I’ll talk him into it… don’t tell him I said that. How could you?”
Lestrade passed a hand throug his hair and spoke with treambling voice.
“you know?”
John’s face fell down. He suddenly wasn’t looking at his face.
“Is it there”
“John is, dead. And you are in denial. I’m sorry”
He said that last word like he was spiting something rotten.
Sherlock screwed his eyes shut. Mrs Hudson waited for him to… well, seem ready.
“You know we are still in time to call it off. I could find some other place to rise my daughter and we would still work together…”
“No, no, he skinned them. He still compulsively caressed them when he was uncomfortable, before he left…”
John's face. Again.
“Shut up”
“South where?”
Greg tried to calculate how far he could get, and he knew he was going too far but he couldn’t help it. He had to say
“John, really, I was sleeping with that girl… whatever-her-name was, where is your obserbation level!?”
"Ain't this exciting?!"
And there, he considered all the possibilities the new version f the case offered…
“Wait… Mr… but, what about the baby?!”
“Her name was Rossie?”
“Sherlock” John breathed out, like he had been under water all this time, like that was all he wanted to say for months, like it came from his soul.
“…No… I dunno…”
“You don’t understand!”
Mycroft shiged. “Inspector Lestrade… Ins…pector Lestrade?”
He even texted Mycroft to thank him for helping with the mission!
His phone started ringing, and he run away muttering “Make sure to make that dental test. I want it…”
“You know I prefer texts if you can’t find words…”
He tried to distract himself with internet cases, then, run into the stupid press bitching still about John’s death, and why, and Sherlock’s involvement, and Sherlock’s moves…
“For Moriarty”
Sherlock pointed at him in rage, accusingly. Mycroft took a moment to get his point.
Greg was crying.
It had taken a whole lot to deal with an addict, difficult brother just to have a decent relationship with him, let alone get him clean. Now he was back in there…
“…I can not know for sure. I suspect that it is not, but that could be infundated by my personal wish”
“…I could have lost interest or you could be mistaken so how did you…?”
What could he do? Was it really his fault? Was there anything he could have done? With all the cameras and micros and… and Sherlock? What could he do with him?
Sally run into Lestrade’s office.
“Dog. He… he tried to resist. He was… struggling, while we all run… he…”
“Wh-whos John?”
“Meaning…?”
“Where are they taking John!?”
“Look at the bright side” Said John when dividing the kitchen and installing a baby door, at one point when Sherlock seemed in panic.
He went to the bathroom, entered the second cabin, took out a piece of paper and wrote
“Fake”
He was somewhere waiting to be found.
And when he had the bag of white powder in his hands, he stoped for one moment.
He stood, as tall as he was, only mild shock on his face, like he had steped on a snail.
“No, he didn’t hit me, I just fell downstairs”
There was a chance that it was fake:
And later on he woke up in the couch, were he had not intended to fall asleep.
The man’s eyes widened with understanding.
There was a table. The camera was aparently posted on it, on high.
“Please don’t be Mycroft”
He even had a piece of mind to feel the irony of consuming this right in front of Mycroft’s door, after he had been denied… what?
“It doesn’t matter. You aren’t getting him back. You both die here”
"...the killer wants us to have the sensation that no one is safe. They will keep doing this while we keep guessing. They don't even need to find victims who look like John. It can be anyone"
Sherlock hung on his brother. None of this was remotly funny to him.
“oh, what is it now!?”
“They killed people. To call your atention, and you provoqued them for more”
“Oh. My…” he looked at the little one “You do grow fast don’t you?”
No one dared to question. Nor speak. Someone reestarted the video and they all contamplated to Sherlock writing whatever on it, passing page after page, and writing more, without taking his eyes from the screen.
Then he jumped onto the gun, and held it with all the strenght and weight he had at the moment. It was not much.
“Don’t you dare”
Molly and Sally kept their faces as blanck as they could. And gulped.
The new corpse had been found hung by the neck, right in the middle of the London bridge.
He had known it was not healthy to eat so much and so heaby right after habing a poor diet for weeks, but he considered it worth it. He was a doctor, after all.
“…what”
The ending is creeping closer,  and Sherlock is an arsehole
Later on, Sherlock and him would joke about it not being truly their first kiss for this and other reasons.
"Who do you work with? Where are they!?"
“Make me choose between my family”
Mrs. Watson would remember that day alone as one of the most confusing of her life:
“I refuse to apologize for a salad”
“Like Mr. Watson? Those were very sweet words sir, would you like to ad…”
“I have profesional reasons to believe that more investigation must be…”
“If this is your plan for us to get a baby count me out”
Sherlock panicked.
“He didn’t do it for John Watson. No”
Sherlock didn’t really think twice (wich was unlike him) on taking a shot.
Sherlock found him sitting on his chair, sipping some tea and contempling the clotes he had been wearing wich burn in the fire place with what seemed like delight.
He embraced Sally and Lestrade, and promissed him to invite him at the bar very soon, jumped into the car and borrowed a phone to call his mother.
He took off hi shoe, peeled off the template, and lifted the piece of plastic there, under wich, there was a tiny bag of white powder.
“…Not really”
Of course he would want to! It's just that… she had been told of his drastic reaction (he didn't even make it back to the crime scene before they removed the body) and, being already an impresive one, what to expect when he was on drugs?
“What?”
And it took him mere seconds to notice the only thing odd was the way John was moving his head. And it seemed herratic, but it was not. It had purpose.
Suddenly, Dog stopped moving. He stood still, listening avobe the trees, over Doc's shouting, the helicopter.
“…nothing, really… the gun was a 9 millimeters, we think it was not registered…”
He seemed happy to be here, now, excited, even, like a kid who loved pirates and found himself suddenly in an actual pirate ship.
“guess you wanted a puppy of the same line uh?”
“…I don’t know…”
He couldn’t take much bedsides the detail that he had a high level of vanity and was probably obsesive-compulsive, or just very obsesive and very compulsive all throug his daily routine.
“Since we started solving crimes, or since we started dating?”
“…Yes.”
"...no, I don't think so"
“Really John. I didn’t need to deduce it after you made a move on me that first time at Angelo’s”
The older Holmes asked silently for a glass of water and placed it on front of the agent, who, after a few seconds of struggle, took it eagerly.
He was interrupted by the phone, and jumped over it.
Still he texted Lestrade.
And then, he called a cab. No idea were to go. What to do up to afternoon?
It was necesary three men and a syngerine to drag him up the stairs and into the truck with the others.
And Mrs Hudson was there.
On this side of the door, however, there was silence.
“Oh but does it matter? Moriarty was so brilliant, and he blew his brains out”
“I told you, John, I was just a dream! Bedsides, It gets worse”
Also, John didn’t get a cupcake the size of Sherlock’s head, but he did get many cupcakes of different tastes and colors wich he ate untill he felt sick.
“The phone, dear. Its for you”
John was dead.
“Defense evidence…?”
“why do you think he dropped of the case? Its all over the newspapers. ‘Sherlock Holmes quits the case of the many murdered Watsons’ uh… quite dramatic… you know why?”
But Molly stopped him with a shout.
“…The… I, really…” Sherlock turned slightly, facing the coffin. And spoke openly, like in a dream, like John could hear him.
He looked at her like he had just seen a big animal crouching, staring at him.
“…You just believe Sherlock is doing this for a reason?”
Mycroft stared at him. Much shocked now.
He needed a fix.
It had on similar clothes to those John had when he was missing, and which had been found on the fake John.
“I will do this for you, but you have to clear your head, and choose one”
How much had he taken?
The effect of the cocaine started washing off and he had no more left for the trip.
“Well? W-what do you think…”
“Yes, she helped solving cases”
He needed a fix. He didn’t even make it to the cab: Just hid behind a tree and… and oh shit there was a papparazzi already hiding there.
Mrs. Hudson couldn’t be happier.
And followers to carry them.
“…so traumatic, I had time enough to make some firm decisions, and one thing on my list was to make sure I told you about this. My feelings. For you. …And to learn the consecuences”
"Of course it means something. Don't you read my blog?"
“How do you know?”
“Look at his face, Sherlock!”
“No! Well, yes, but for investigation purposes. With the rest of the dna, just the skull won’t do”
“Well, thats very true… I still feel like I lost some very important time with her, and I hope I can get it back”
“inspector Lestrade. You are responsible of the case. You have always responded for My brother’s implication on your work. Tell me is there something that… could’ve got him… upset or whatnot?”
Sherlock stood, and then, oddly he chucled.
‘Done already’
“Sherlock!... ah. Look” Mycroft got up and walked to be on eye level with him.
“…They must be very close, watching out reaction”
“wait, what would be the other option?”
"So...? Do you think it means... Something?"
Sherlock held John’s hand on his, cold, non responsive… in search for possible clues of shelf defense attempt… and found something that called his attention even further.
“We don’t have any friends”
Sherlock took a moment and started.
Getting home, he was tackled by Mrs. Hudson. He liked her, but he was annoyed.
“Sherlock, I…”
John breathed deeply
“You tell that to your brother” She left it on the table.
“Isn’t that a bit too much?”
Sherlock groaned and picked it up.
As he had it on his hand, and directed it to his veins… he had an idea. And it was stupid, but it was worth a try.
When shouting around “he is alive” after the results had come, Lestrade had nearly crashed into Sherlock on purpose. He tripped over his words apologizing and thanking him and asking what to do in order to find John, and fiery assured him he was at his service.
He wanted that. He wanted to be with John and tell him what a crazy week it wad been. And how sorry he was for the stupid salad…
“Hello…”
Mere minutes later, Mycroft showed up.
Dimmock was dealing… well with Sherlock’s behaibour, as he respected him for his miraculous capacities…
“I know John’s alive… but I can’t help to think of him being dead, with all the burial and his dead face again and again and with Sherlock behaving like this…!”
John grumped something and went for a walk.
“Sherlock?”
And John would shout at him like wenever he lost his patience, and tell him to “get me out of here you idiot so I can type in my sodding stupid blog and give me my baby!” and sherlock would try, but could not see John. John was gone and even if he was not, Sherlock did not have the baby, and he was alone.
“Mmm yeah”
…he ended up sleeping in his mind palace, witch, wrecked as it was, still felt safe and homey now that he knew John was not gone for good.
The one on the right was still. Docile, in a terrified bunny kind of way, and looked at the camera like hoping something good could possibly come out of it.
Sherlock had left a disembodied hand on the fridge.
“SHUT UP!!”
The phone stopped ringing in the time it took him to reach it. But he didn’t need to catch the call:
“Please, the poor man has had enough of…” Mrs. Hudson tried to put peace, but the girl reporter ignored her abruptly.
“…I… don’t know” sight “I… I guess I can only hope John was right”
“John managed to blow your little game, but who Moriarty wanted was always me. Its me who he shot his brilliant brains out for”
And while doing this, he seriously considered if it was about time to stop all of it, drugs and case alltogether... After all, John wouldn't come bsck, and Rosie...
(Damn, too much light. Isn’t this London?) when a sudden sound added to his nuisances.
John looked at him, and then arround, and cleared his throat, and opened his mout, and closed it, and then sighed
“…what miscalculation? What test?”
‘when’
He run up to John, helped him into a kneeling position a bit away from the edge, and firmly ripped the gag of his mouth.
“I didn’t expect you to do it. It shocked me”
Two days later, he had estimated a posible number of implicates, together with the material they may be using, and the kind of place they could be stated in...
‘When will the body ready to work on it?’
Sherlock’s head spinned faster, and he could not shalow down her words.
But to speak on his funeral…”
In each one, sat a completly different person, tied down and muzzled, they all wearing the same clothes, and the same face.
“…yes”
“I already knew”
He took another cab, while texting Lestrade. The inspector wasted no time on leaving what he was doing to follow him to the exact place were the stolen cab had been found.
"...seems like they were calling ahead for us"
“Well, today’s ...his funeral, dear”
"Not in the mood, Mycroft"
From the moment his mother came in, he wouldn’t stop paying attention to the infant, holding her, complaining with horror for how fast she’d grown, trying to make her react, wondering how far did she remember him…
“…Sherlock?”
Lestrade had barely managed to walk in, phone in hand, but not talking, his other hand to his mouth.
But whenever he had been moved arround he had been drugged to aboid struggle, so he had had plenty of rest, too much, really.
John smelled like… and did not fight. But had marks on his knuckles, but not anymore…
Sleep would be imposible now. He went for the graveyard.
“Sherlock, I did not…!”
How long had he managed to stay clean? A day? A couple days… yeah…
His head was boiling with extrange sensations and false memories.
On his way he walked past Harry. She had been watching and there was a silent discussion there: who would keep Rosie?
‘The burial is over. Get back to work. See you there’
Of course, instead of texting, he called back.
He wanted to shut the entire world down like it was a light and walk out the room, close the door, and forget it all, but instead he shook his head and muttered
“I don’t believe you. Even if I had made a move on you, wich I didn’t”
After, Sherlock was in a similar state of shock to the time John had asked him to be his best man. But with his mouth a bit open. John suspected it could all end up in another fight.
“Becouse I can’t find the solution, and no matter what I do it just keeps getting worse. I’ve decided I can’t keep up with the stress and frustration nor can I do anything to remedy it… but find a distraction”
At the feet of the rock, the police team struggled to form a circle not too wide around the spot. The injured dog’s handler explained the situation and Lestrade panicked, looking around for a solution.
And so he repressed his urge for drugs while strolling to Lestrade’s office.
“There is cientific proof that genetics have big influence on sexual orientation…”
It had been fascinating and adorable, seeing this two boys fitting so well together and going and coming and …
And five minutes later, greg Lestrade got back to his car limping a bit and holding his brushied chin, with a broken lip and a black eye.
She didn’t know if she should have expected Sherlock to be there.
She spoke too fast to be honest in any way. It didn’t help that, behind her, the boy had sticked out his large phone, and was flashing at him at the moment.
When it was time for Mrs. Watson to leave, he refused to let her part with the baby, and it was needed a lot of resoning to get him to.
The dogs started getting restless when reaching a large rock covered in moss and surrounded by thick bushes and trees. Sherlock couldn’t see what was on the top, but the dogs jumped up the rock and suddenly the air was struck by the sound of a gunshot, and dog whining.
Some may argue agains't it but I am one of those exhausted and offended by the abuse of queer baiting.
John rolled over to look Sherlock face to face.
He had been holding it for a while without noticing and he was no longer capable. One tear managed to scape his tightly closed eyes and now an army of traitors run down his cheeks. He was silently, ovbiously, crying.
It was another paparazzi.
…My …life, is being torn apart and I try to hold it together, and I come to you for help!
Sherlock took a deep breath and contemplated the body in front… wait.
“Like what?”
It was to no avail: it seemed like the thing ringed continously within his brain, and John was somewere in the flat shouting at him to behave like a normal man and pick it up…
Sherlock was thinking. “I have to go back to the crime scene, and the stolen cab”
“If you really cared for that kid, you would yearn for the best for her, and not…”
Next morning, Mycroft had to send someone to pick him up from jail.
Sherlock run up the rock, sliping in the moss and climbing frantically, stood in the way of the handler and held the hysterical animal by the leash.
“You are high and depressed and mourning and so you see imaginary clues everywere even thou you’ve seen and touched his corpse!”
Sherlock followed a close by path, (the closest variation of scenery) and, up not too far, there was an abandoned building.
He went home for a syngerine.
He breathed deeply, backened one step and then forwards, hands claping in front of his mouth, crouching down onto her.
“Another one?”
“I am not going to use my contacts to take an infant from her family, so that you can have a new toy!”
He had been so careless. Shouting around ‘he’s alive’ like that at his working space, when it was the most probable place for the killer to be lurking, waiting for his reaction.
“…closet case. I am just shocked that you finally came out ot me. Thou I knew some kind of shock would be necessary in orther to break the cicle”
John did just as he said he would, and then put on his usual clotes, wich were now a bit baggy on him. No big deal: he planned on refilling them soon.
Still no answer
It was him. Still, paler than ever. Same clothes he left with, a large pool of half dried blood spilled from what seemed like a shot to his chest.
“I can not use my contacts to give you a child that is not yours AND take from the grave her father’s body, which was buried just today!” Mycroft breathed deeply “Sherlock. All the press is behind you…”
Mycroft was so shocked by this outburst he just carefully wiped out a drop of saliva from his face ad listened to whatever Greg had to say.
“The murderer is a prankster. He prepares a little play for us to react to. For me, specially. He wants to see us dessperate in public, the news, the papers… by not reacting to his little show, I made him starve” Sherlock stopped in front of the screen while someone put the thing on.
“I did try to stop him, dear…”
Mycroft flinched. Sherlock kept shaking. He had been clean for a long while now.
Molly puffed like a horse and rolled her eyes but concentrated on her job, willing to get over with it and have John’s already rotting carcass off her working space.
John tried (he really did) but he couldn’t hold back a little snicker as he replied
John sighed, and asked to the dark room.
Mrs. Watson felt uneasy with how he managed the baby: like it was any other day to day tool, like the phone or a notebook. Casually, naturally. And she wasn’t sure if it was a good or a bad thing…
“…Im planing to retrieve Rosi. If that is okay with you. I will also have to discuss it with Mrs. Hudson, but, eh… she is my daughter and I am getting her back and that is not negotiable”
Sherlock refused to answer the door, so he just came in.
Sherlock groaned when John wedged his warmed hands under the stretched out collar of his old T-shirt and leaned his head back with closed eyes. “Tense.”
But he wasn’t going to think about that, because it wasn’t a problem for that particular day. Sherlock had devoured a box of frozen waffles with more syrup than John believed was proper and a butter count to match, and John was nearly giddy with the thrill of it all. Things were getting better since John decided to set aside his strict sensibilities to borrow a page out of the Victor Trevor’s book, were they not? A few moments out on the fire escape smoking a very different kind of cigarette to at least consume one large meal that day was far better than risking the decreased appetite that Sherlock’s new antidepressant, Wellbutrin, could cause. A nasogastric tube was still on Sherlock’s hard limit list, but thankfully was looking less necessary by the day.
The handkerchief embroidered with his initials to tuck into her bouquet for her wedding day, easily accessible when the tears came?
John raised his eyebrows with pleasant surprise. “So, a Sherlockian zero?”
John was also grateful that it was Mycroft who, in the end, broached their silence. “Would it be fair to assume that Sherlock’s neurologist was not pleased with his progress? It does appear to me that someone wouldn’t need a medical degree to realize his ability to function has decreased as his pain has become more severe.”
“What are you staring at me for?” Sherlock demanded quietly, standing in the hallway having just changed into pajamas and gotten Rosie to sleep. “It isn’t my fault I’m rewearing my dressing gown again. Mrs Hudson didn’t bring up the washing and I don’t hear you volunteering to go fetch it at this hour.”
“What the hell are you doing?” He demanded, and John felt sympathy pains as Sherlock shakily pushed himself up out of his chair and stalked into the kitchen where he had been putting together a tray to take to their coffee table.
He snorted. “Bionic legs, really? I’ve told you, these sound great until you actually have paralysis and can move faster than you would taking one step every twenty seconds or less. Love, I appreciate you finding these, but I don’t think-”
It was because of this that that morning, John made breakfast while Sherlock gave Rosie her bath, struggling to smile to himself when he probably should be.
In their closet, John never bothered counting how many shoe and shirt boxes there were full of old lockets, framed photographs, engraved trinkets and yellowed invitations and thank you notes there were, only settling to tell himself the amount was
Sherlock,
The British Government even allowed himself a chuckle. “I’m afraid I prefer my desserts to be of a higher quality.”
The space had become theirs as Rosie’s clothes and toys had migrated into what quickly became the family bedroom, and John felt no remorse for that fact. A married couple needed space to do married things. If those married things involved John choking Sherlock on his cock then refusing to let him come while he fucked him with more energy than he had to spare, that was simply what would have to happen.
Sherlock made an exception to his no-one-else rule only two hours later, when Rosie began to fuss for dinner and Mrs Hudson brought in a tray of juice, tea and sandwiches. She sat on the bed for a few minutes, asking Rosie all kinds of questions about the tuna fish boat program that Rosie was never going to be able to answer. It was still obnoxiously kind of her to try, which he knew that John would have appreciated so Sherlock tried to do so as well. He figured it still counted if he did so silently.
“That’s exactly what they are, only they are used for the partial second that the other leg swings, weren’t you listening?” His husband chided, but there was still thrill in his eyes. “Ready to get up? You’ll just need to hold onto me- just like that and then you’ll feel points two through four as long as your positioning is correct. Points one and five will only-“
Erica’s lips turned up. “About what, exactly?”
“Clearly my brother’s ability to deduce is in his nature and not a teachable skill.”
“You may want to withhold calling in favors for her medical school recommendations until our daughter here tells you why I needed her care.” Sherlock drawled with a snicker and an eye roll.
John groaned and rubbed his eyes. “Are you telling me that you entered me in this- this study without asking me?”
It felt… it felt good, if he was being honest. Accepting the lack of grounding each time he stood was the first reason John had hated the leg braces at at physio but somehow the familiar use of the cane from well before his paralysis seemed to calm that anxiety. It was like his body remembered the shape of it in his hands meaning he wasn’t going to collapse from his psychosomatic limp, and one might say- if they had a particularly dark sense of humor that John certainly could appreciate- that it was just like riding a bike.
But he remained very much alive.
Beneath the DI’s hands, clearly not putting up even a shred of resistance, John grunted. “It’s okay, love. Not your fault.
“Maybe not, but you and I both know it’s more than tea and pills.”
“Eat, go on.” Sherlock pointed towards the dish that John had filled with the measured amount of the food that his husband had made himself. The experiment he and Rosie were doing kept his spirits up and John wasn’t going to argue, even if it had involved taking in stray cats that Rosie had encountered in Mrs Hudson’s small garden. “Shall we be going then? And did you remember to text my brother to uninvite him to accompany us?”
Sherlock was waiting beside the mirror, rocking onto his toes with excitement. “Are you alright? Comfortable?”
“Let's try that. The massage therapist, I mean. How soon can you get one here?” He joked with a nearly humorless chuckle- considering that it brought to his mind how much pain it appeared Sherlock would be in when he woke up- and Mycroft pulled out his phone. John’s protests were willfully ignored and waved off with dismissal.
“Let me finish,” His therapist said, head cocked to the side evaluating him for something or other than John was beyond noticing. “And you weren’t beaten within an inch of your life- fractured ribs puncturing a lung, concussion, bleeding kidneys- while trying to save the life of your closest friend.”
The whole system was utterly ridiculous but he humored Sherlock by exchanging his pants for the thin cotton leggings that thankfully had a flap so he would still be able to use his intermittent catheter without taking the whole rig off. As he would one day uncomfortably soon need to keep them on for six hours at a time and needed to empty his bladder more often than that, it would be necessary.
He pulled a face. “Not when my hair hasn’t been combed since yesterday. Besides, I have a zit.”
Stone poked his head up just as John covered his ears. “Sherlock, what’s going on?” Him and his brother working together was never a good sign and John resigned himself to whatever it was about being his problem. He wasn’t thrilled with Mycroft, in fact he actually wanted to strangle him, but how could he be angry when Sherlock was so alive?
“Either way, The paramedics informed me that it was no easy feat getting him down two flights of stairs and if this is to become a regular occurrence- or worse, for him to have another seizure- then I urge you to reconsider my offer to find you living arrangements that are more accessible in the event of an emergency. There is a lovely assisted living facility near my home that caters primarily to younger adults who have suffered various injuries.”
Mycroft appeared mournful and disheartened, which was exactly what Sherlock did not need at the moment. He hated pity. John was grateful that Sherlock was asleep.
Quickly, he shook off his worries, then stood to brush his lips across Sherlock’s forehead for a beat longer than usual. “I think I can handle that. And I brought dinner, which you are eating, as well as a couple little surprises.”
John shook his head. “No, they won’t keep him very long once his pain is at a tolerable level. I can’t imagine we’ll be here for any longer than another couple of hours.” The last time they had been in the A&E for such an event, Mycroft had flown back from The Netherlands and the time before that, South Africa. There were reasons why John no longer attempted to bring Sherlock along to shop for groceries or ask him to ride the tube.
None of that was the point, because John was not snuggled up with his family. Sherlock and Rosie were watching a National Geographic show titled
Sherlock smiled devilishly and put on his coat without a wince, which gave John reason to smile right back. When it came to the ridiculously handsome man he was lucky enough to marry, London fell to its knees. There would always be a cab.
“We could have lost him so many times and haven’t.” Greg agreed half heartedly. “But we didn’t keep him either, not really.”
“Morning, love.” John said hesitantly, setting the tray on the floor while Sherlock sat up. “How did you sleep?”
John brushed back his curls, which were suddenly so damp with sweat that John would have sworn he had just taken a shower and forgotten to so much as ring it out over the tub. “Sherlock, I have to, love. If you’re in this much pain then you need to be seen by an A&E doctor and I have to call Doctor Fletcher to meet us there. Something isn’t right. I need to make sure you’re not actually injured.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I like the blush pink with gold embossed lettering in the font they’re calling
She shook her head, then shrugged. “Don’t know. No one told me much other than your med list and to grab bagels. That’s what I did.”
“It’s my choice, isn’t it? I’m the one who has to endure whatever torture methods the medical community has devised and I want to be the one to decide. Tell me what I’m choosing between.”
“A three.” He answered, arms crossed in front of him around Rosie in a fashion that John knew was causing the pins and needles to return to his fingers and would only worsen the longer Sherlock held the pose. It wasn’t as if she lacked the balance to stay seated on her own as long as Sherlock resisted the urge to fidget.
The first inkling that John should have had that things weren’t going to be simple was when Sherlock cornered him in the kitchen after breakfast on that delightfully good day. Perhaps the sight of his devilishly handsome husband- and he wasn’t necessarily being metaphorical- in a new bespoke black suit and red shirt had put John in such a great mood that his evaluation of the situation was compromised.
Just another little memento.
John know, day of Rosie’s first hair cut would be a far more involved affair than John could ever imagine it could possibly be. He had thought of eventually getting around to taking her to an overpriced salon, likely to exactly who cuts Sherlock’s own finicky hair- nevermind it being exorbitantly priced, in John’s opinion- then taking some pictures on his cellphone like any parent in the modern day and bringing home a lock of hair in a bag for the baby book. The very same baby book that Sherlock found out Mary and John weren’t caught up on when Rosie was two months old decided that he should take over, which wasn’t a surprise by that point. Sherlock had been smitten with his ‘Watson’ from the start.
Not wishing to worry her, as Sherlock had been her acquaintance during the worst of his drug addiction, John kept his explanation vague. “She sent him home with a new medication for the worst days that should be very helpful if he agrees to take it. Mycroft is sending a massage therapist to see both of us this afternoon.”
Hesitant to leave him, but defeated by the knowledge that he would have to leave either way as his phone and the medication had been left in the kitchen. John got up, whispering further apologies into Sherlock’s damp curls. He found both his mobile, rang Anthea for a code to the safe, and reached for the pills before instead drawing his fingertips over vials of morphine.
is better than you expected?”
Sherlock placed the five electrodes on each side of his body, each wrapping around his ribs in a half circle. “Connection points one and five- front and back respectively- on each side are to alert you with a firm electrical pulse if you’re not maintaining proper form and points two through four indicate the position of your leg during each step with a light pulse.”
, given that anyone administering Sherlock’s medications would be relieving his pain the same amount, but at least he could provide comfort that would be accepted.
Soon, the sound of a text message being sent and received was the only sound in their silent flat and the elder Holmes smiled. “I’ve scheduled for someone to come by in three hours. That should give him time to rest, take a hot soak to loosen his muscles and put on his dressing gown to meet Natasha in the sitting room. You’ll go directly after. I believe ninety minutes each should provide a decent degree of relief. She will contact me regarding how often she thinks either of you need to be visited. I urge you to trust the professionals on this one. You may know medicine, but I am the expert in luxury. Natasha really is the best.”
... in front of two officers. It’s not as if they can just turn a blind eye to that without it compromising all ethical boundaries. Doesn’t matter that you’re all friends.”
Eyes fixated on the package, but quickly dashing between Sherlock’s prone form and John’s stern expression in a way that indicated she knew exactly what was going on, Rosie nodded and reached out to take the present.
“Thank you, John. I’m sorry. I love you. Do you love me now, John?”
Sherlock snatched the insert, scanning it briefly though John got the impression he may have already had it memorized. “Of course not, those are cumbersome and ridiculous. The battery assisted joints release, facilitate rebound and lock appropriately for each step but those steps and the momentum that bends the joints need to be made by the wearer. And the side stabilizers are like little kickstands, so as long as you distribute weight properly from size to side as you take each step crutches shouldn’t be necessary- on relatively level surfaces of course. A cane is needed especially while in the standing position and in conjunction with a secure railing while using stairs. And the sensors solve the concern of not knowing where your legs might be, using wires that attach from the braces to small adhesive electrodes placed above the point of injury that vibrate according to leg position. Nothing like these have ever existed before.”
“I’m talking about spending three days and nights straight soaking towels in ice water and draping them over you to try to keep fever from frying your brain.” John seethed, and reached up to poke at the side of Sherlock’s skull. The spot that, when John once described to Sherlock his nightmares, he said was typically where he could see inside Sherlock’s mind in the very literal sense of the expression.
The memories of Sherlock being this lover, a year ago that felt more like a hundred, got John rock hard in an instant and, oh fuck, John absolutely had to be inside him.f
“Well, Rosie here was quite concerned about this nothing little bruise of mine and insisted I lay down to be her patient.” He gestured, eyes still closed, to where Rosie had scattered John’s stethoscope, pulse ox, pen light and no less than forty plasters over the floor next to Sherlock’s head.
Instead, she was kind enough to feed Rosie on mornings that John anticipated that Sherlock’s behavior might upset her. Most of these events happened after days of overexerting himself, which was no longer defined by a long case. Cases were done exclusively at home on the rare occasions they were done at all. No, what wore Sherlock down were things like doctor’s appointments, trips to Tesco, and taking Rosie to the park. It happened more than any of them liked, but thankfully the concern tended to be lessened enough by the time she had finished her breakfast each day. As always, she would then go right to Sherlock.
“Is this a nine, Sherlock?”
He shook his head. “No. It’s been a good couple of days that I know won’t last but it’s been nice.” A four the day before and a five that morning were far from disagreeable. They were also following a trend that was heading firmly into the territory John hated that they continuously had to revisit.
John, again, raised his brow. “What am I looking at, exactly?” He neglected to challenge Sherlock’s definition of ‘families’ given that John had a mother that insisted they were going to hell and a sister who was only a bit more sober than usual at the moment.
The expression he made when Sherlock had consumed all of his patience. Or when he could just jump to the face of the criminal who had particularily struck his nerves. Or when he was very concentrated on something that should be scary.
He wondered if this is how John kept seeing Mary after her death, and he ignored the ghost of a memory caused by his high… and kept thinking of rational, propper things.
‘Do your damn job’
For once, Sherlock woke up too early, but didn’t want to go back to sleep.
No response
“well, I… wait. What you mean other option? You understand the situation? No more jokes, no misunderstandings?”
Sherlock made a face to the thin air and growled.
Rosie’s grandmother saw this and nodded, passing the child to him. And Sherlock truly had to readjust his balance.
“No he is smarter than that… he must have a plan… he’s thingking of something… doing something… he must be lying I know”
He could take one last shot, just to go throu the wait, for the results that would either put his life back together, or crash the reminding pieces.
He had spent the last weeks in a small room, lying on a dirty matress, chained to the wall, when he was not chained to a chair for Doc to poke at his face and war scars.
Wait, was that ok? Was it more urgent to avenge John’s death and punish the responsible or to make sure the baby would grow properly?
Before it was served, someone with a familiar voice sat next to him and announced he would pay that drink and another one.
"And?"
The rest of the flat was more of a mess than usual, too… but Mycroft’s eyes went directly to the box of syringes in the coffee table.
Sherlock had two good answers.
He shook this thoughts away, for later. Had to think fast. Had to be strong. Got to get the naloxone... And somehow give it to Sherlock
“He came to my house, interrumpted my work, and openly disrespected me”
“The clothes are not the same, thou similar to the ones on the first one. Actually they seem to be new. Also, the first time, the body was left somewhere it would take time for us to find it. But this is the opposite: the killers (it has to be more than one, probably a small, very dedicated group) they took a great risk just so that we would have it on our faces instantly. The killer had changed their course of action…”
A second of silence
“Uh?”
“Of course. I will tell anyone else that you don’t…”
Molly snapped him out of it gently
And John was still not home.
Greg looked at him.
…the first one, that is.
And then something got out her mouth before even thinking.
Mycroft looked at him like he had confessed a murder
Dead. Killed. Like so many others he had enjoyed solving.
“The stairs? Thats an easy fix, we can have as many fences as…”
“I… was going to tell you that John use to joke about that… but that would be wrong.
Seconds later he received a text.
“Today? Why? What’s up today?”
Then, someone called at her door.
“Ten? It’s still a ten, Sherlock?”
For a moment, Sherlock stammered, and it seemed even Mycroft felt sorry for him.
His heart dropped to his stomach and truly, John couldn’t believe it. Pulled tight to his chest, John ignored Rosie’s protest while he kissed the top of her head and relished in the fact that he held a living, breathing, uninjured child in his arms.
John sighed. Sherlock was certainly struggling if his composure was slipping so easily. “They’re probably down with Mrs Hudson, begging for the milk from Rosie’s cereal bowl.”
“Brilliant?”
other than the front door of 221B to pick up the mail, medication and grocery deliveries. There were appointments at the hospital- so many so that he sometimes wondered why in God’s name they even bothered leaving- but other than that all John wanted to do was lock their little family of three into 221B, bundle up in warm pajamas and never leave their bed unless it was to grab more DVDs from the sitting room cabinet or snacks for Rosie.
John kicked himself for the thought. It was the effort Sherlock was spending on breathing and on waking up every day.
Mrs Hudson cleared her throat and looked straight at the sidewalk in front of them, instead of in his general direction as she had been before. “Now, I know it is not my place to pry, but the two of you are the only children I’ve got and that old house has a lot of creaky floorboards that I’ve noticed have become awfully quiet lately. Not silent of course, I can tell the third floor bedroom isn’t Rosie’s anymore, but the two of you were much more rowdy before that accident of his and-”
was always what could have been, and what might be, but not what was known to be true.
. I don’t want to lose that.” He admitted, and John could hurt the hurt behind his words.
John shook his head, still in disbelief that people reduced Sherlock to the moment it happened and not the moments after. “He didn’t try to accomplish anything, he got right off the pavement and chased after the perp. The man had murdered two of his estranged children and was holding a third captive. Sherlock saved her and is the reason the other two will be receiving justice. He wasn’t some idiot that wasn’t looking where he was going.”
After washing his hands, John popped his head in to tell Mycroft that he was going to take a walk and received another dismissive wave. People liked to wave at him that way, as if it was no inconvenience to them to take up the role of Sherlock’s caretaker for an hour or so to provide the difficult man’s husband some relief. As much as John wanted to resent them for that, he could not be more grateful. A break was hard to find on the bad days.
There was nothing more beautiful in the world than his husband’s love.
It was an obscene understatement but what else could he say besides letting wild accusations fly? What good would that do if Sherlock clearly couldn’t be arsed to care? Why would
“What can I do?” He asked, and John was oddly enough not surprised that Mycroft didn’t argue over the new medication. The only thing that Mycroft worried about more than Sherlock relapsing into addiction was the distinct possibility that he was suffering out of refusal to take proper measures. Even if those measures were the very drugs he had fought to escape to save his life.
to know, not
“Do you consider being a full-time parent and primary caregiver to a disabled spouse to be physically and mentally taxing?” She asked. “Or is it really as easy as you’re dismissing it to be?”
Usually, Sherlock wasn’t so blunt as to express how poorly he felt. If John asked for where he was on the pain scale and if he needed medication, his husband would answer- but other than the confession of passing suicidal thoughts to Victor his unhappiness- was rarely mentioned. Sherlock had never been the happiest man with his black moods and nervous manic energy. The idea that a reminder of why they soldiered on was permanently inked into Sherlock’s skin made John endlessly curious as well as tempted to worship it with lavish kisses. Maybe Sherlock didn’t always want to live, and he certainly had never planned to live as he was, but he would do it for them. Sherlock would suffer boredom and endless grey days for them. If that wasn’t complete devotion, John didn’t know the meaning of the word.
Sherlock at least made the effort to sleepily roll over to answer him as opposed to speaking into the back of the sofa or ignoring him entirely, and John thanked God for small miracles. “Nothing.”
It was likely indicative of his own mental state that he thought more of what of Sherlock’s he was going to give Rosie than how to tell her that Sherlock was dead.
“No you don’t.” Sherlock crossed his arms. “You never plan errands or schedule therapy after my bad days. Especially not on bad days after appointments when there has been a change in my prescriptions. Why are you lying to me?”
She wrote something down and nodded through it, mouthing words to herself that John could tell were not what he had said. He caught the word
What he wouldn’t give to one day deserve it.
After so long, his snappiness when he was in the thick of it was nothing new to John and he knew it was often best to ignore the attitude in favor of addressing the root cause. The former would only lead to the silent treatment, while the latter was at least semi productive in that it got medication into Sherlock the quickest.
From across the room his husband chuckled quietly at the stream of words John failed to understand. To him, it sounded distinctly like, “Rake olive tree beams cone booth, Sank Papa!” But based on Sherlock’s adoring expression, he felt it fair to deduce that ‘rake olive tree beams cone booth’ meant he did well.
John hated Sherlock’s younger cousin, even though he was usually polite enough to deny it. Typically, when questioned, his answer would involve something along the lines of Winifred being a particularly overgrown troubled youth. This ignored the fact that she was a multi millionaire who was the majority shareholder and biometric engineer of the company their Grandmother left behind. People always left that part out.
-Holmes. Sentimentality at the helm of a genius was a dangerous things.
John flinched at the word
The look on John’s face was startled, and he shook it off as quickly as it appeared. “You git! You utterly clueless git- I’m not talking about the jumping off the bloody rooftop.”
Despite being in their same old flat, John felt as pampered as someone staying at a spa. Well, as pampered as he imagined that would feel like. Both of their skin smelled delectably like perfumed oils and even Sherlock seemed to have enjoyed himself despite initially being annoyed by Mycroft’s interference. He had stubbornly insisted that he didn’t need the wheelchair and also rejected John’s cane. He instead had used one hand on the wall to support his heavy limp back to the kitchen where he microwaved his isn and Rosie's dinners. Eventually, Mycroft took his leave and Sherlock agreed to take his bath in anticipation of the masseuse's arrival.
“Here, I bought these a few days ago.” Sherlock said, returning with a shopping bag from some swanky store on Savile Row. “Clothes, John. Just a bit bigger- and nicer, of course- to properly fit over your braces. Here, I’ll help you to the sofa and you can try them on. If the sizing is correct, I’ll send for more.”
John snorted. “Not exactly comfortable but… not exactly terrible either.”
In a twisted way, that made it a bit easier to call in an order for takeaway Chinese and brush through a small shop nearby while he waited for it to be ready. The girl at the register tried to strike up a conversation with him about his purchase, and he politely but deliberately cluelessly told her he was paying with cash. Sometimes, in the modern day, it was best that people not know his name. Having a random woman dropping her phone number in the contact field wasn’t going to be conductive to kissing and making up.
Sherlock shifted Rosie in his lap then crossed his legs defiantly, but John knew his heart wasn’t in it. Today was draining him and he would likely need some degree of help up the stairs when they returned to Baker St.
Working on this fic was my way of coping with the fact that I had finished the Breakable series, which still makes me sad when I think about it. Whenever I need it, I go back to that story and enjoy it all over again, and I wanted to do something to show how grateful I am to MissDavis for writing it. Thank you for such an amazing story, and I hope this does it justice.
. And he wouldn’t have needed nor would he have violated Sherlock’s trust to quantify it to someone else, so there was no need for an exact count.
Sherlock married him- a man who put his hands on Sherlock on more occasions than John knew he could recall, as it had become so normal both before and after the fall. He adopted John’s daughter that he’d had with a woman who shot him, who Sherlock also forgave without a second thought because he believed it was what was best for John. Damn it all, the man heard the words
“I’ve never once believed you had. That concept is of my brother’s invention and he alone deserves full credit.”
Mycroft smiled sadly, and John knew that was the way most of them had smiled as of late. “I hope it helps
“-there, brilliant.” Sherlock said, stepping back. “I’ll need to see you upright of course to make sure they’re not terribly bunched up. Ready?”
“Which medication?”
John sighed, taking a moment as he packed up to breathe. That’s all he could do anymore. Breathe.
and the fear behind it. There was no reason for Sherlock to believe that John would ever refuse to listen to any and all of his instructions during sex. It wouldn’t have mattered if John had been two thrusts from orgasm after being edged and denied for a bloody month, he would have stopped. If Sherlock was actually afraid that John was going to keep going against his wishes, then the pain could be to the point of turning him delirious. A ten could do that to a person, especially when their mind was already flooded with endorphins when it began. A ten could drive someone to insanity.
Looking to Sherlock’s hands, John made sure that his husband could move his fingers if he wished to, and bent down to kiss and lick the new tears that were pushing their way through his lids and onto his cheeks, unable to be contained by just one path to fall. “Are these for me, love? Are your stunning eyes crying such beautiful tears just for me? Could I ever be that lucky?”
A place where, hopefully, he was still actually welcome. Sherlock didn’t seem the type to beg for him to be sent home just to avoid the effort of tossing his things out on the pavement in front of Speedy’s.
“Yes, it is.” He smiled down at her, and Sherlock leaned with obvious discomfort to guide her head to just under his chin so he could kiss the top of her head. “You’re why I go on- the both of you.”
“I’ll have to be. It’s not as if I can stay here and send you in my place.” Sherlock answered and pushed away the covers that were still draped over him, dramatically flinging them in a sorry attempt to cover his toast with hopes John would forget.
decided not to listen to me.”
“Mhmm,” He said through flattened lips while Sherlock helped up upright, and was surprised by the vibration of the third electrodes on each side that indicated his legs were properly under him. “Cane- my cane, now, Sherlock.” John said, waving his arm in the direction of where it had been put until the smooth wooden handle was in his grasp. Swiftly he made contact with the ground and let out a sigh of relief.
with any of them.” He said. “And now I never shall be again. They’re not welcome in my home if this is how they’re going to react when John puts his hand on my shoulder. We are married, you know. Spouses tend to be allowed to touch one another. Just because their marriages didn’t work out doesn’t mean there isn’t any affection left in mine.”
John Watson hadn’t wanted to go back to therapy so soon after bringing Sherlock home. No, he took that back. He was a father to a toddler and a husband to a man with new physical challenges. He hadn’t wanted to go
“I kick him!” She squealed and Sherlock broke down into a fit of giggles just as she did.
“I’m grateful for what you’ve done to help, but this might be…” John let himself trail off all too willingly before gaining the courage to continue his thought. They’d both discussed it, Mycroft urging him to say it on too many occasions for John to keep count of in his brain cluttered with schedules, dosages, appointments and online grocery order.
“Aha! There we are-” He announced triumphantly and before John could make another irritated remark, he caught a glimpse of that smile again. What the hell wouldn’t he do to just keep Sherlock smiling? “Now let me flick on the switch- and you should be feeling each electrode verifying that the corresponding joint is powered on and operational.”
“What in the-“ John trailed off, looking at himself just… standing there. Standing with a cane and a bit of a tilt but standing none the less. No braces were visible under the clothing other than a small line around his hips but that could be brushed off as a belt at first glance.
The man beside him groaned with irritation. “Fine, but I want Indian.”
He climbed the steps to 221B with the bag of takeaway hanging from one arm and the other two packages in the other.
Not that it had stopped him smoking the second he could get far enough away from Rosie not to worry about second hand exposure. The bastard had even purchased a second coat for the explicit purpose.
“That does sound like a very noble cause to sacrifice himself to,” She agreed. “And not something an idiot would be able to accomplish. Is Sherlock’s service to London any less deserving of respect than yours to Britain?”
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. These were produced in the states and as you know I haven’t taken any leisurely trips outside of the country without you since your accident.” He pointed out, looking at John’s feet. “Now, you’re only supposed to stand in them for the first seven days so here is your cane- yes I can see the irony too, no need for that expression. Unless of course you want to put on trousers so Angelo can come over and hand it to you.”
“Worth a shot, right?” John shrugged but held his husband tightly just to remind himself that Sherlock was still there. Down- oh so very down- but not gone. He hated that that had become a very real possibility, Sherlock’s black mood turning against him and taking him away from John for good. But in the warmth of the man curled around him, John kept his hope. “Just check. You’ve found a few decent ones over the years.”
Slip ups like that were a reminder that Fletch was an American, and her American television accent hadn’t needed the help.
“Climbin’” Rosie shrugged, the lie would have almost been believable to John if Sherlock’s continued chortling hadn’t given it away.
It was odd not to have Sherlock chiming in about every scoop of rice or slice of protein going into Rosie’s bowl. He found, instead of relishing in the freedom, the prospect of it made him a bit uneasy. John wasn’t the type to track every serving of each food group that he put in front of a toddler, but he refrained from asking Sherlock while he laid back nursing a possible, though thankfully unlikely, concussion.   If John- a bloody doctor who graduated bloody medical school and became a bloody army captain that ended up with one of the most popular bloody blogs in London- couldn’t figure out how to put takeaway on a plate for a toddler, they were all doomed.
With defeat, John sighed but nodded. “Within reason. Run them by me first. And Mrs Hudson if it changes the structure of the building.”
They reached Baker Street without incident and, save a bit of wooziness, Sherlock seemed to have no problem getting to the door and up the steps as long as he kept one arm around John. Mycroft let them be once Sherlock was back in bed, and John climbed in beside him with the black out curtains drawn.
Oh god, it was.
A cry from the bedroom, evidence of a small frightened half-John person that heard the scuffle, met Sherlock’s ears and he felt himself torn in two. Answer the fearful little girl begging for her Lovey, or ensure she still had her Papa when it was all over?
He groaned and reached for his own phone that he’d turned out the night before to conserve the half battery life left. “Shit- nothing. He really thinks you’re holding me for this.”
Oddly enough, that was the thought that made John smile with honesty behind it. With conviction. If he was giving Sherlock any pure joy, it was in the form of Rosie. To John, it seemed she was doing a bit better- though many conversations still needed to be had and appointments needed to be made- but to Sherlock she was perfect. As far as John could tell, in his husband’s sometimes child like eyes, she always was.
She didn’t say anything to that, instead choosing to try to coax Sherlock to eat something. He kicked her out with a few choice words and plated Rosie’s breakfast himself. Maybe he couldn’t dispense his own pills but he certainly could put peanut butter on a bagel and cut up a banana. At least until John,
Obviously, this meant he had to manufacture some challenges for John as well.
“Do you agree, Doctor Holmes?” She asked.
Doctor Carlisle pursed her lips and cocked her head, and he could tell she was pointedly ignoring the second statement. Maybe because it wasn’t relevant, or maybe because his family didn’t raise him to be an honorable kind of man at all.
His therapist appeared thoughtful and then nodded. “That makes sense to you, given Sherlock’s history with opiates?”
In which John buys gifts, Sherlock takes a shoe to the head, and Rosie licks the digestive tract of a sea turtle.
Letting her sleep downstairs with Mrs Hudson on nights that they identified would be particularly bad- when Sherlock might require more care or a trip to the A&E- was still fairly new and incredibly uncomfortable. That despite the live feed Sherlock had on his mobile to where she slept in their landlady’s guest bedroom, and separate baby monitor to indicate when ti required checking.
And now, there they were.
Clearly, life wasn’t fair.
“You’ve got to have something in mind if you’re accepting that as an answer. Go on.”
to remember. From skulls to phones to bayonets, he kept snippets of every case that he could without the yard scolding him for pocketing evidence.
John started to push in slowly, measuring the look on Sherlock’s face, and decided that keeping things business-as-usual was probably the best way to go about things. In one hard thrust, he pressed himself deep inside Sherlock’s well prepped warmth and let out the breath he had been holding.
All he got was a nod of acknowledgement, and shivered a bit at being welcomed into the club of husbands who practically lived in the doghouse. Anderson slept around. John let his temper get the best of him. How different were they really?
“Fifteen months.” Mycroft told him dismissively. “The first three are spent working up to using them for at least six hour increments a minimum of four days a week and then the following twelve are spent on determining the function of the product itself. The design was presented to me by an individual that took an interest in the research I conducted last year. A grant of two million pounds was acquired to create a series of models and you will be the first to log the long term benefits and disadvantages of the finished product.”
Sherlock’s lips pursed with hesitance, “I believe our daughter arrived at the correct treatment for my injury but was unable to reach the freezer due to being vertically challenged. Could I get that ice, John? This headache is unbearable. A nap and some quiet would do quite well, actually.”
“If I must.”
Sherlock stopped and glared at him a moment, but it was half hearted. “How can you not see it? These are leg braces, John. Prototypes. The only ones in the world.”
Again, he answered with a silent agreement.
John shook his head with humorous exasperation. “Probably because my hands would get tired, and you know I’d go forever if you asked me.”
, they would climb up to her old room and utilize John’s old rickety full size for activities that hadn’t happened in that room since John stopped bringing home new women every month or so.
“It’s lunch, John. You’ll have your little-“ humiliating “-care plan meeting with Mycroft and Lestrade, and Winifred and I will get something to eat.” Sherlock protested, and crossed his arms. His wrist twinged, the nerves still smarting from where the surgeons put in the screws and plate to repair the repeatedly broken bones. “What on earth could possibly happen over sandwiches and coffee?”
For some reason, John couldn’t find the mirth in Rosie managing to injure her father to the point in which he had to lay down and close his eyes while watching her.
“Alright, this is getting ridiculous, John.” Greg said as he unlocked his office and came in with two cups of sludge like break room coffee. “I’ve gotten eighteen pretty violently angry text messages since yesterday. You’ve got to go home.”
Her cheeks turned pink with embarrassment and she attempted to squirm away.
“Why on earth would you choose to spend your first good day in a week with her?” John asked, and Sherlock felt the familiar sinking feeling in his gut.
John huffed a chuckle as Rosie’s tiny fingernail found the right divot in the plastic and popped the turtle open with another squeal of delight. “Two spares it is.”
All of their fight ran out months ago, Sherlock’s two separate hospitalizations being the final nail in the coffin.
His older brother made no move nor spoke a single word to discourage Lestrade’s hold on John, or the words he was whispering harshly in his ear. Lestrade, obviously, paid Sherlock’s cries no mind.
John looked at first of the objects skeptically, not sure what he was even looking at. “A camera tripod?”
to worry about how our families would take the news and if we would have to elope because no one would be willing to come to the wedding. Hell, if this had happened any earlier then I might have had trouble being the one to make your medical decisions in the hospital and push for the right diagnosis. Those nurses hated me by the end of it.”
Sherlock nodded in agreement. “Always. Of course.”
“Yeah, you’re right.” He rubbed his eyes.
“Oh, John dear, we should visit the theatre this summer. Even Sherlock and Rosie would enjoy it, you know. They do primarily Shakespeare- so many beautiful gowns- but there are musical acts from time to time. I can’t imagine he would like that at all but if you wouldn’t mind accompanying Mrs Turner and I, it may be enough to pry away that pecan shortbread recipe that she’s been so stingy with. My maple scones are far better, mind you, but not knowing can drive a lady mad. Not nearly as mad at the two weeks I had to share a kitchen with my mother in law. Oh that was terrible, John, she kept adding water to my wedding soup and I just…”
Only, that wasn’t right, even though it seemed John was still lecturing at him in the same breath he’d used to remind Sherlock of his own chronic pain. But John wasn’t going to hurt him right then, was he? Not with The British Government, their landlady and members of The Yard circling around them. Not over something as trivial as a tattoo.
* * *
The days of having a gorgeous genius in a long flowing coat on his arm were over and, while he had accepted it, the thought of going alone still tightened his throat and left his feet weighted to the front steps of Baker Street.
Plus, John wasn’t sure they could traumatize her anymore by medical appointments after two recent rounds of ambulances, paramedics, and almost week-long stays in hospital.
John snorted and shook his head with a smile. “What, I’m not allowed like looking at you?”
Mrs Hudson scolded from seemingly miles away, barely audible over the thud of blood pumping in Sherlock’s ears as he tried to piece together what on earth John was talking about.
Near the stairs, Mrs Hudson had a hand cupped over her mouth and, thank God, Donovan was soon distracted enough by the hyperventilating old woman for Sherlock to slip past and reach John in two strides. The perk of being in constant pain, if one stretched the definition of perk within an inch of its life, was that most people were afraid of touching him. Afraid of hurting him. Which only served to mean that Mycroft didn’t try to pull him back and a bewildered Lestrade made no move to push him away. Though, if he had, the irony of doing the very thing they thought they were arresting John for attempting might have been enough to get them to release him at once.
The burning skin on his face was second only to the fact that someone was now actually yelling and he was no longer sitting and the person who was yelling was him because where the hell did she get off saying that?!
The discomfort and remorse that crossed Greg’s face made John feel a bit bad, but it didn’t make his statement any less accurate. It technically had been his fault that Sherlock had so many seizures in hospital, after having talked John out of continuing to keep him sedated. That also meant it was Greg’s fault that he’d spent so much time in blinding and deafening pain. Not that that was what Sherlock was upset about, explicitly. It was- John supposed he would call the matter adjacent.
, but with the gray blue ribbon and of course the white frames and metallic gold boxes but we’ll have those hand lettered. There really is no other option.”
“I don’t know what to do with him anymore.” He admitted. “I want to try the new medications but I can’t do that if he refuses to be honest about how much pain he’s in. Even after he lost consciousness he vomited, twice. Once on the bed at home and once in the ambulance. It killed me to do it but I asked Mrs Hudson to at least strip the bed but likely she’ll do the washing too.” All while dealing with Rosie’s inevitable tantrum. “The idiot is lucky he didn’t aspirate again.”
He quirked his lips, “Well, you did get an impulse tattoo with your twenty-something lesbian cousin instead of having lunch.”
“Beautiful? Amazing? Beyond perfection?” John continued to offer, feeling the arousal pooling in his belly at the intimate feeling of Sherlock’s body slumped against his. A feeling he had wanted for so long, and they’d wasted so much time going without. “Relaxed?”
“She’s not going to eat until she gets her present,” Sherlock groaned as he was handed the tea, the pill and his bowl of noodles in quick succession. “Kids can smell gifts from a mile off.”
As it turned out, there was far more involved than would meet the eye.
And, as Erica insisted, he would attempt to allow himself peace while doing so.
When he heard the shower turn off, John quickly finished their morning’s dishes and wiped down the tray to stow out of sight. Sherlock hated the bloody tray.
The smile was back. “Only if you’re carrying a camera. How does that feel?”
Maybe John should have been ashamed to admit that Sherlock loved his daughter more than he did, but it was the simple truth. Rosie was wonderful and beautiful and John loved her despite her difficulties. The difference was, Sherlock loved her for them. Their connection ran deeper than John had felt with anyone other than Sherlock himself, and John certainly couldn’t match that with Rosie.
had infuriated Sherlock enough to demand a transfer back to NHS on the second day, and Doctor Fletcher had been happy to go back with him.
The sternness in his voice surprised even him, but John found within it strength, save any trace of anger. It was... surprising, really, and came without the usual guilt of snapping at their little girl. Even Doctor Carlisle probably would have evaluated his response to be appropriate given the circumstances. Paternal, but kind hearted. Standing firm without proving entirely inflexible.
She frowned. “Except it is, because you married someone who’s part of that world. Someone who, like you, is now receiving payments out of an account set up by someone other than himself for an injury he sustained while serving Queen and Country. The only difference I see is who set up the account and the severity. I’d say a head injury as well as a bone fragment damaging the spinal cord is a fairly severe injury with more long lasting impacts. You were never in a wheelchair or bed bound beyond the first week or so in hospital, were you?”
“You think? Sherlock is threatening to commit arson so we have to evacuate the holding cells.” Greg snorted. “He does remember I’m a detective inspector, right? That’s evidence right there.”
‘Still yours’ echoed through John’s mind and he smiled widely. Yes, he certainly was. Sherlock was irrevocably his. After everything that had been twisted free and taken away from them, that remained a constant unmovable force. As long as theirs hearts were beating, Sherlock would belong to John and John would do all in his power to deserve that degree of dedication.
Mycroft inclined his head. “Of course.”
John reached up and rubbed his eyes, resisting the urge to growl solely due to the excitement coming from Sherlock as he worked on assembling the contraptions. “And what if I don’t want to do this study.”

A piece of MAIL.
“I said no ambulance.” Sherlock said between sharp intakes of breath at what John was certain were phantom cramps, as they had never had such a problem before and there were other parts of his pelvic region that were intermittently affected by numbness and over sensitivity. The trouble was, phantom cramps decided when to come and go according to their own whims, leaving Sherlock to suffer their wrath. “Two then. I’ll take two.”
In half a beat, his blood that had been warmed by his daughter’s smile ran cold. “Sherlock? Sherlock?!” John yelled back, then heard the creaking of a long detective turning over on well loved sofa springs. “What’s wrong?”
Sherlock’s teeth bit down hard on his lip and John felt terrible as he had to pull it out from between his teeth, worried that the man would bite through it if a wave hit him hard enough. Instead of answering, he unclenched his hands and splayed them out on John’s chest, all fingers separated from one another.
John gestured at the steps. “Downstairs still. Must’ve woken up late.”
to shag in the dark because you didn’t want me to see you cry and I didn’t want you to look at my shoulder. We
John nodded to the neurologist. “Yes, that’s the only way he can stay comfortable for any length of time. I try to massage his shoulder and neck every night with that lotion you recommended- thank you, by the way- for at least fifteen minutes but it only helps about half the time. More for his muscle soreness because of how he’s held himself to avoid the pain than anything else.”
John opened his mouth to defend his husband but couldn’t bring himself to do so. “Yeah, he is. How could he hide this? He could have just told me.” While redness should have flooded his cheeks, it didn’t. He was far too acquainted with Mycroft gaining information on the intricisies of their sex life. It had been that way before the injury.
“You feeling alright now, love?”
It was true. The last time his mother had seen Rosie in person was her christening, and the talk of visits for holidays and birthdays stopped abruptly upon John moving in and becoming romantically- read sexually- involved with Sherlock. But that didn’t mean he was going to deprive her of the small joys of birthday photographs and their family Christmas card, which he and Sherlock had an unspoken agreement needed to involve at least one photo with their wedding rings pointedly displayed and another of an embrace while they each kissed one side of Rosie’s face that did not imply they were any less than a real family.
John chuckled and rose from where he’d crouched near Sherlock’s head to fetch the first of the brown paper wrapped presents. Then, he knelt down beside where their daughter had perched in Sherlock’s chair with a bowl in her lap, and smiled apologetically. “Rosie Posey, Papa is very sorry that he didn’t come home yesterday. Please, never ever try to climb out the window again to come get either of us because Lovey and Papa will always come home as soon as we can. Promise me that, and really really mean it, and you can have what I brought you.”
Though John hated to admit it, he did have a point. Asking Molly for body parts wasn’t exactly soemthing he could do on such short notice but there did have to be something that Sherlock would enjoy.
Enjoy!
could be Mrs Hudson’s way of saying to Greg that he had actually thrown a plate across the room and to proceed with the utmost degree of caution, all the while leaving Greg under the impression that Sherlock might be up for checking out the file of a case that he just couldn’t crack. With numbers, and the specifically designated severity of tantrums that correlated to those numbers, everyone from Mr Hudson to Mycroft could receive fair warning as to what they were dealing with when walking into 221B.
“I’ve already taken the afternoon off, John, and Anthea is having a late lunch delivered in a half hour or so.” Mycroft leaned forward and put a hand on John’s knee, the touch unbelievably growing familiar over the span of Sherlock’s struggle. “You don’t have to do all of this on your own. Sherlock may be your husband, but he is not just your responsibility. There are many people that owe great debts to him. Remember to allow those the privilege of paying them.”
Enjoy my little teaser? Let me know in the comments and feel free to suggest what naughty things John will do to his genius.
As that breath passed and John relaxed ever so slightly- flailing his arms for emphasis instead of directing them at Sherlock’s cheek, jaw, or nose in the form of fists- and Sherlock felt ashamed for entertaining the thought. That wasn’t who John was anymore. He went to therapy every week to learn to keep the anger at bay, and Sherlock was nearly as proud of that work as he was of his own.
“I am not high! For the first time in a long while, I’ve found a huge clue and a path to follow in this case, if you just gave me his… head”
Whenver asked about it, he would remind them that he worked and lived with Sherlock Holmes. “Plus, I got a blog” (He firmly refused to descrive too much of his traumatic expirience, thou)
“Were is John?”
“The smell”…
“I!!” He snapped at the face of the girl, who had walked up to him, a young man behind her. “…Will not be making any declarations, specially to a pair of rookie reporters who came in here lying to my land lady. OUT”
He run out the door.
‘hours. Wait for the afternoon’
Mycroft shiged.
The dog handler set the animal free, and it takled the two men, biting into the arm with wich Doc was fighting John’s full-body grip.
He wouldn’t waist his trip: he got to the mourge. He coulnd’t see John there anymore… but his brain wanted to try.
