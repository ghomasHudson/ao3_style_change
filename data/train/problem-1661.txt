The Northern part of the cemetery had some newer graves, many of which seemed to be in Armenian script.  Some in Cyrillic.  The Southern half seemed to be all Jewish graves.  At the East were wall niches with many open spaces remaining, and some very large monuments.  There was a long, rectangular reflecting pond with swans in it, and another round pond with a Romanesque structure in the middle.  Along the West side, there was a small Thai cemetery, and then long, two-story buildings with wall niches, some sized for cremated remains, and some for caskets.  There were many large, grand individual niches in the buildings, but the buildings themselves had seen better days, and in many places needed maintenance.  Some of the stained glass windows were very cracked, and there were weeds growing through corners of the buildings where they shouldn't.  The buildings were still standing after the various earthquakes Los Angeles had suffered over the years, but who knew what the future would bring?
He ducked down into the rushing water, and his face was much cooler.  It didn't do much for the lack of air, though.  He felt a hand grab at him, so he hit at it with the bar, and it withdrew.  He held his breath as long as he could, but he had to come up again.  There was still quite a bit of airspace in the tugboat, and the steam flew at him again.  He swung the bar through it, but that did nothing.  The boat was starting to tilt noticeably, because it was sinking, but still tied to the dock.  Sherlock got at least part of a breath, and ducked down into the water again.
The man stood up, pushing his chair back, and focusing on Sherlock with the gaze of someone who could see right through you, into your heart.  Yep, this looked like the man whose picture was in the lobby.  Sherlock kept strolling across the office floor.  "So how did you become a 'demon'?  Slave trade?  Car theft?  Crossing against the light?"
The man went through several facial expressions in a row: alarm, wariness, concern about time, and finally settled on resolve.  "I'll show you to the rectory.  They can assist you there."  The man put his hand on Sherlock's upper arm, cringed slightly at the wetness of it, and then pulled him along by it anyway, leading him through a smaller, plainer wing of the church--apparently floored in the 1950's, with green linoleum tiles with white streaks--and out a side door.
As soon as he got a few trees and lampposts between him and the women, he raised the coffee cup he had stolen from their table and had a swig. Excellent. He thought that one had looked like the triple-espresso sort.  He needed coffee to get his brain working and think of how to get that last demon, but he had no stomach for meeting the man in a suit if it could be avoided.
Sherlock wandered through the church and as he approached the group of people, they all looked up at him.  Most of them went back to looking at the man speaking, but one of the younger men kept an eye on him.
Sherlock moved along as the light changed.  The convenience store was just outside the shadow of a freeway, and under the freeway was a lot full of wrecked cars, with some tents and tarps in amongst them.
Sherlock finally made his way onto the seventeenth floor, which did have a little more security than all of the floors he had previously examined.  It looked somewhat promising.
Sherlock had thought he might look over his usual online demon study materials today, but his phone was dripping wet, and wouldn't turn on even briefly.  He sorted through his mind palace, reviewing for anything he might have missed that would lead him to another demon.  He must've sat up all night, as he noticed the sun was shining directly into his eyes as it rose.
Sherlock took a small pebble from one of the nearby graves and tossed it to the other side of the glints he could see.  The rotating briefly paused, and then continued, along the same course.  It didn't seem to be avoiding him or approaching him.
The suited man brushed the coffee cup off the top of the stand, and onto the street where it broke into several large shards, puncturing the tire of a car that was backing into the space.  The man in the suit promptly turned and walked away, and Sherlock followed him before the car's driver could take in what had happened.
The blonde woman marched along beside him as he looked at her, and thought about what he should do.  She gestured down a side street, and hopped a fence into the fenced-in yard of a single story house.  He somewhat cautiously followed her, but she didn't attack him as he leapt the fence, or do anything else aggressive.
The gold puddled out across the floor.  Sherlock leapt up onto the nearest desk.  The gold drool kept moving outward from Mackler's mouth.  There could not possibly have been that much material inside of a person, but it kept coming and coming.  The floor groaned under Mackler.  The gold drool was melting the carpet as it came, and giving off horrendous fumes.  The fire alarm started, and a couple of seconds later, rusty water started pouring out of the sprinklers on the ceiling.  As soon as the water hit the gold, a cloud of steam filled the room.  Sherlock ducked down and lay flat on the top of the desk, to try to stay underneath it, but the steam was scalding his skin. He felt the desk shift under him.
As the ghost tank dissolved in a blaze of glory and Sherlock fell through to the ground, the last demon mark over Sherlock's heart smoked and burned.  It felt like the entire skin of his body was burning away, not just the skin of his chest.  Sherlock knelt on the ground, curled up.  That was the last one.  This mark's burning away hurt so much more than the rest of them had.  Surely he was burning all away, now that it was over, now that all the demons were retrieved.  He was so tired of fighting.  If he had any claim whatsoever on heaven, Sherlock would turn it all in, just to see John one last time, just to know John was safe.
Sherlock rolled up against a tombstone, with a scratching and crunching noise.  He managed to get to his feet, and found the glass had a gap in it along the middle of his back.  He clawed at it over his shoulders, and the glass hung together long enough that he was able to peel the entire thing off.  He started running blindly across the cemetery, trying to pass between the densely set tombstones by the feel of the air.  He didn't want to open his eyes yet, in case there were still some pieces of glass lurking on his person.  It was hard to tell with all the cuts paining him and distracting his senses.
He didn't have good numbers for what temperatures eyes would burst open.  He should probably run some numbers on that the next opportunity he got.
Sherlock evaluated the skeleton.  The lack of skin was no great impediment to interpreting the facial skeleton.  The lower facial prognathism was like that of...Rebecca?...The frontal bossing of the forehead was like hers, as were the somewhat rectangular eye orbits.  The cranial capacity and the gracility of the skull also suggested a female.  In short, he was sure it was she.
He waited until the steam stopped, and then cautiously climbed up the ladder again.  There was nothing in the tank except the sediment at the bottom; even the walls of the tank were dry now.  He climbed down the ladder.  Apparently there had been no point in rinsing out his coat.  Just as he was taking off the coat, he felt a pain in his left arm.  He pulled the coat off, and twisted his jacket and shirt around so he could see the painful area through the slash.  One of the mystic-looking tattoos was smoking and fading.  He hadn't noticed that happen at the tugboat or in front of the shop.
The man who usually wore a suit followed along with him, step by step.  Sherlock passed through the plane of the gates, and a moment later, the other man also came through.
Sherlock picked up the bag from the next drawer, one with some beard hair visible.  "Good dental hygiene.  Has had a left-handed dentist for at least the last five years."
After about eight hours of this, Sherlock saw a blue flicker off in the distance, towards the mountains ringing the plain, on his side of the wearyingly straight segment of highway.  It looked like lightning, or like the light from an electrical Jacob's Ladder.  It wasn't a continuous blue glow, but fizzled and cycled.
Less than an hour later there was a knock at the front door. It was Mycroft, his assistant Anthea, and two men carrying several cases of equipment.
The little terrier next to John's chair stood up facing the door and started to growl. "Bobby! Stop that!" There was no one on the stairs; John would've heard them. Bobby was getting even more worked up. He started running back and forth in front of John's chair and alternating his growls with barking. "Bobby! Bobby, stop that!" John pointed at the ground as he reprimanded the dog. Bobby ran behind John's chair and started whimpering loudly. John leaned over the back of the chair, and saw that the dog was piddling on the floor. "Bobby, what's wrong with you?" He stood up to get a towel and the spray. A person stood between John and the closed door of the apartment. It was a tall man in a long, dark coat. "Excuse me-" John started to say. The man was thin and pale with dark hair, and light eyes. He looked just like Sherlock-just how Sherlock had looked in life.
He circled the building.  There wasn't even a need to talk his way in or catch the door as someone entered or exited.  One of the outside doors in back was propped open with tape to keep the lock from closing.  He went up one floor and started walking down the hall.
The concrete was coming up faster and faster. It only took a few seconds. There was a horrendous impact. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't move. Everything was dark. As the pain began to register, he thought he heard John calling for him.
"There's a man here at Baker Street who looks and sounds just like Sherlock and insists that he is him. He seems a bit unwell. I'm not sure what to do about this."
It was mildly concerning that the demon seemed to be following Sherlock's train of thought right after he thought it.  This tank demon wasn't psychic, was he?  Did telepathy exist?  This would definitely make killing him off a more difficult proposition.  And he did get out of the way of that key squash ball awfully quickly.
John thought that he had kept walking into the kitchen for the towel and the spray, so he was extremely surprised to find himself laying on his face in the hallway in front of the door to the downstairs. Bobby was sniffing at John's face. John felt a bit shaky. He could feel the sweat on his upper lip and under his eyes. He wasn't the kind of person who passed out like that. It had been so real, though. He would've sworn he had actually seen Sherlock standing there in front of the door. John wondered if he should have his head looked at. Had he stood up too fast?
Sherlock didn't think he could dissumulate well enough in this situation to prevent Mackler from realising he could see him.  Sherlock approached the blue glow, within leaping distance.  Mackler grasped at Sherlock's legs, and Sherlock jumped back out of the way, swinging the panel.  Mackler struck Sherlock's forearm, and the panel went clattering under the conference table.  Sherlock jumped back as far as he could, and reassessed.  He dug the staple remover out of his pocket, as he jumped backwards, and broke the two halves apart so that he had two pointy pieces.  He threw one at Mackler, but missed his eyes entirely.  It bounced away out of view.
At Mycroft's urging, the technician without glasses demonstrated the optical equipment on the other assistant, and then showed John which buttons to push.  The optical assistant also spent quite some time arguing he couldn't guarantee the results under those conditions.
"Sherlock, Darling.  You never call, you never write.  I haven't seen your signature on one paper in years.  Are you avoiding me?"
He came around the corner of an open-walled shed and found the noise had stopped.  Instead of a herd of pigs, they were all in pieces, strewn across the pen, with the demon standing in the middle of the pen, covered in blood.  His fingers looked much sharper and longer than they should.  The demon looked right at him, said "Catch me now," and then spun in a circle.  As he spun, pieces of himself flew off at all angles into the pile of pig parts, and burrowed down into the pile.
It was June 16th of 2015.  Sherlock had been finding fewer and fewer demons per month, and he only had until...2016...sometime?  What day had he jumped off of St Bart's?  He checked the internet on his phone.  June 16th was John's blog entry "He was my best friend and I'll always believe in him."  John hadn't written anything else on his blog in four years.  It would be the work of a moment to figure out what (no doubt risible) parts of the internet John frequented if Sherlock could only see him in person.
"Well, my parents liked traditional names."  They walked out of the bakery together and down the sidewalk.
Sherlock looked a passerby right in the face for a moment, as he crouched, halfway through the car.  He pulled on one arm, which was apparently driven through the roof and into the back seat of the car.  He shook his hand, and worked it out from between the seat springs.  He looked up again towards the window he had just fallen from.  There was still gold pouring from the broken window, spreading across the side of the building, and falling to the sidewalk in blobby chunks, like lava.  Then he saw a head stick out, and duck back in.   Sherlock moved faster, bracing his now-free arm across the top of the car roof, and pulling his other arm out of its car seat and roof.  Oh, Lord, someone was filming him.  Maybe the other man in a suit would interfere with the recording?
The sprinklers stopped.  Nothing but drips came out of them.  The fire alarm was still loud, and the air coming from the gap at the bottom of the window was very cool.  The carpet smoke was dissipating quickly.  Sherlock wondered if that was a dark outline of Mackler he could see through the carpet smoke.  He might never get back to John if he didn't escape now.  He could of course, hold out hope that John would commit all sorts of sins in his life, and end up in the same place as Sherlock eventually, but he supposed he shouldn't hope for that.
like Sherlock--had stood in the corner of the front room from the time he had backed away from John until the time Mycroft showed up. He wasn't sitting in his old chair, just crowded back into the corner between the fireplace and the window.  He had his greatcoat on, but he had his arms wrapped around himself as though he was cold, and there was a tightness to his eyes and his jaw.
Sherlock made his way out of the cemetery and West until he found a park where he could bed down for the night.  He didn't expect to have any trouble evading the cemetery security guards, but it didn't seem like a good place to sleep.  In the morning, his clothes were fixed again, as was his skin, and everything was back in his pockets.
It looked like it would be ridiculously expensive to get from the airport by taxi, and most other ways of getting around would require a credit card, so Sherlock took public transportation.  It was June, and despite how much further north New York City was than Los Angeles, it was much hotter in New York City.
Mackler retreated back into a windowless room.  It was a conference room that had apparently been droneproofed to keep corporate spies away.  Sherlock concentrated again on his more metaphysical truth-detecting abilities, besides his expert-level listening skills and senses of proprioception and touch.  There was a clear blue glow in the room, but the blue didn't reflect off of the walls like a normal light would.  Sherlock felt his way around the edge of the conference room with one hand, as he walked around the large central table.
He looked back and forth at the two women, who had been taken aback by his interruption. The one on the right smiled and had just opened her mouth to say something, when Sherlock said, "Oops, got to go, that's my agent! Bye!" and walked off at a brisk clip, holding his phone to his ear.
Sherlock turned away from Mycroft and looked at John. He lifted the bow and set off on a much nicer piece. Mycroft flicked his eyes over to John. John looked back at Mycroft. "I don't know this piece, but it sounds like something he'd play."
Sherlock was sitting upright in a chair. Everything around him was dark, but he could see himself. He could move. He could see. He looked around. Next to him, in another chair, was Moriarty. Moriarty turned his head towards Sherlock and grinned at him. Moriarty didn't look like a man who had just blown his brains out.
"It's really bad when the rains start in fall.  We used to have salmon in the river, but all the pig farm sewage lagoons overflowed and killed all the fish."
Sherlock vaguely heard the priest offering him a bus pass as he stood up and walked back out of the rectory.  He crossed back into the church to cut through it to the street.  Where had those cracks in the linoleum tile come from?  They looked like very heavy footprints.  The footprints of someone who walked like him.  Exactly like him.  He crouched down for a better look.  There was a loud crunching sound under his feet.  He stood up again and saw that the tiles had split under his feet.  Perhaps he should get outside sooner rather than later.
After about an hour and a half, the bus pulled up to its terminal, and Sherlock got out, wending his way amongst the pedestrians, who were much slower-walking than those in London.  The occasional crowd formed on a sidewalk in Los Angeles, but only right in front of the big tourist destinations.  New York had an actual City-sized crowd.  Sherlock had thought that it was just the bus terminal that smelled of urine, but on further consideration, the smell extended throughout the city.
He started out walking towards the airport.  He would really have to do something about the having-no-American-cash problem, he thought, as the city bus drove by him.
Sherlock wasn't sure who the man thought he was, but he inclined his head to the man, and went to see if there was anything of use to him.
The building was built in the 1920's, and had four cylindrical water tanks on top.  The tanks were riveted together, and perhaps original to the building.  The tanks were painted gray to cover graffiti, which cast doubt on the hotel's claim that no one could get up to the roof.  There wasn't much to see besides the tanks, and there were two ladders sitting out on the roof.  It would certainly be easy enough to take a look in the tanks.
Another bus pulled up to the stop, and a man wearing black-and-white striped pants and nothing else, who was covered in dirt, rolled off of the bus shelter seats and onto the concrete.  Another man seated in the bus stop remained hunched over whatever he had in his hands and was holding a lighter to.
He stood there next to a swimming pool.  He supposed he had better get this over with.  What would one say to a penitent demon? Offer a last meal?  Cigarette?  Blindfold?
Sherlock set the ladder up against the tank furthest from the edge of the building, and perhaps more difficult to see from the street.  He looked all around the edge of the tank and all over the top.  The lid and tank had a hasp that would fit a padlock, but there was no padlock there.  There were no marks of use to him that hadn't weathered away by now.  Sherlock lifted up the edge of the lid to look inside.
"Yes."  He stared at her for a moment.  "How did you know about the tugboat?  There was nobody on that pier.  Why would you ever have occasion to go there?"
The man in the suit chuckled.  "They're all on the same side, are they?"  He snapped his fingers.  "So close."
Sherlock leapt up onto the front of the tank and stamped his foot on the deck.  He had to jump off the top to avoid being swept off by the gun as it turned.  He bounded out of the way of the treads, and prepared his verbal arsenal.
Wending his way through various neighbourhoods of varying quality, Sherlock came up to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.  He circled it, but there was only the one gate, to the North.  Abutting it directly to the South was a movie studio.  The wall of the movie studio directly touched the fence for the cemetery.  There were homeless people in tents surrounding the cemetery and studio, but not right at the cemetery gates.  He circled  back toward the gates.
It was a Saturday afternoon.  The streets were certainly crowded, but the office buildings were deserted.  It was the work of a moment to get around the single security guard on the ground floor of Mackler Securities.
Sherlock woke one morning to find a passport and airplane tickets, in the name of Robert Johnson, in the pocket of his greatcoat.  Easy enough to remember, he supposed.
The office building was low and tan with clerestory windows above a row of garage doors.  The adjoining side had an office-style front with windows and human-sized doors and a projecting roof, and the side of the building above the roof read "CHP"in thin blue letters.  Several light poles with long arms reached out over the truck lanes leading to the scales.  There was a large paved area with some concrete barriers for funneling the trucks to the appropriate scales, so that 18-wheelers towing three trailers could maneuver around each other.  A couple of dusty old passenger cars rested along one edge of the parking lot, away from the CHP office.
"I have poisoned."  She looked at him for a long minute.  "No, you're not a priest.  I have done bad things, but I have stopped doing them.  Give me time to find a priest.  Then I will come back."
Sherlock stopped focussing on the blue glow, and concentrated on what he could see in real life, for a given value of 'real'.
Sherlock waited, waited, and then whipped the squash ball with the bump keys in it at the man's head.  He was disappointingly fast, though, and ducked out of the way with space to spare as the ball flew off into the gravel pit.  The demon closed the lid again, and got back to operating his tank from the inside, but Sherlock knew he was fuming in there; it even bled through into the way he drove the tank.
Sherlock had only an instant to wonder if he was really done here, when he felt the last tattoo burning off his left arm.  He undid his cuff just to check that it wasn't a stray ember, and saw the last trace smoke away.  Well, he'd better get lost before someone came to check on the fire.
The "median" as the Americans insisted upon calling it, looked tolerable enough to him.  There were some low bushes and spindly trees that were green, interspersed with tall yellowed grass, that would make him difficult to see from the roadway.  He got in under the tree and saw some wadded up newspapers, and an assortment of fast food soda cups and crisp bags, but no shopping carts or tents or tarps, so he supposed no one else would have a prior claim.  He flattened the grass down and lay down to sleep.
Sherlock Holmes pitched his mobile phone behind him onto the roof of St Bart's hospital. He had just disconnected from his best friend, John Watson, who had begged him not to jump. But with Moriarty lying dead on the roof, there was only one way for Sherlock to solve this problem and keep his friends safe from Moriarty's gunmen.
"But why don't you go on up there, try to round up my demons for me, and when you fail, you'll come back here, and Mr Moriarty will go up there and try his hand at collecting the demons for the rest of the time remaining in the five-year period.
They circled each other.  Sherlock wondered if the man expected him to say something like, 'I'm your worst nightmare.'  He wondered if he could get him uphill and off of the rocks onto better ground.
"John, please-" the man said, and took a step forward. John punched him in the sternum, which was meant to be painful, rather than damaging, but almost before John had time to blink, he was knocked to his back on the floor. The stranger had one hand on John's throat, and the other hand raised in the air, holding a steak knife. John held still. Sherlock had never been even as good as John at hand-to-hand combat. This couldn't be Sherlock. The strange man's expression changed from blank to horrified. He let go of John's throat and lowered the knife, and sat back. "Oh, God. John, I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to. I should just put this through my own eye right now."
He checked in, and as he made his way to his room, he looked into a rubbish bin in the hallway and picked a beer can out of it.  He took it back to his room to tear it up and make a shiv.  He wished he hadn't had to leave his knife behind in LA.
The tugboat may have been called the Aurora, but the paint was very weatherbeaten.  Sherlock walked down the pier one over from it, looking at the side of it that wasn't attached to the dock.  The tugboat's hull was black, and there were rusty and oily iridescent brown streaks trailing  down the sides of it.  The topsides looked to have once been painted white, but all the rust leaking through made it look cream-coloured.  It looked deserted.  The doors were closed, there was no water or smoke coming out of it.  There weren't even any seagulls sitting on it, which was unusual compared to the other boats he had passed on his way there.
Sherlock had been sitting quite some time.  At least, it was now dark, and he had arrived at the site in daylight.  A dented and rusty white van pulled up, someone shoved an old toilet out of it, and the van peeled away.  The toilet knocked down the hill until it landed directly on a rock and a shard flew out and hit him.  Sherlock sat in the dusty cloverleaf and examined a white piece of porcelain near his right foot.  Well, this sitting was getting him nowhere.
The pane he had grabbed twisted in his hand, and the other nearby shards of glass closed in and drew in the other panes, and wrapped around him.  They seemed to be connected to each other in some unseen manner, and to work in concert.  The panes turned themselves individually so their thin sides were pressed against Sherlock, and he got all cut up, as did his clothes.
Sherlock thought he might keep his eye on that man; he seemed in a mood.  Sherlock turned as he came to the entrance of the cemetery, and the man in the suit was much closer to him than he had thought.  Sherlock paused for a moment, considering.  He turned a little further, and then walked backwards through the gates, one foot behind the other, like an East German escaping.  "Have I?"
Sherlock shuffled backwards through the grass, hoping not to fall backwards over any markers, and trying to keep his balance on the uneven ground.  As he backed up, the other man stepped up onto the grass as well.
As he walked from one door, the warm sunlight fell right into his eyes, blinding him, but in a moment they were at another door, on a smaller building, with less decoration than the church, but painted the same colors.  The man rang the doorbell, and in a moment, an asian man with a mustache answered the door.  He was wearing black, with a clerical collar.  "Hi, Bennie," the man said.
Sherlock bounced off the inside walls of the tank as he flung his arms about.  Think, think!  He went entirely still to see if that would clear the water and if any light would leak into the tank from the outside.  It also might induce the thing to let go of him, thinking he was dead.
Sherlock was heading back towards the store the Haitian woman owned when he crossed paths with a church, a baroque Spanish building, painted pink and white.  People walked out of the church, and the cars in the parking lot lined up to exit the lot in several places.  Sherlock entered the church, after the crowd seemed to have exited.  It was much darker inside the church than the bright Los Angeles sunlight.  As Sherlock's eyes adjusted, he saw that no one was sitting in the seats.  There was only a small knot of people standing at the far end of the church.  The unamplified voices echoed around in the high-ceilinged church and it was hard to hear what the man was saying, but he thought he caught, "and all his empty promises."
"You're awfully wet, maybe I could drive you to a shelter?  I know for a fact they have empty beds at St Emydius."
Sherlock made his way out of the airport and into the city on public transit.  He'd been to Vancouver before, and didn't much care for it the first time.  He made his way to the nearest hostel to the train station, which promised to be cheap and not to require a credit card.  It also promised bedbugs.
The last one was the one with the skin from the neck attached.  Clearly male with the beard hairs.  This was reasonably interesting, though.  This had to be a man who played American football.  He had once compared an assortment of sportsmen and bodybuilders by the trapezius, platysma, and sternocleidomastoid muscles.  It was almost impossible that it should be the neck of a man who went to a gym just for his appearance, or that it should be a man who had a physical job such as construction.
The glass man was crawling himself along the marble floor of the building by pushing each separate glass section against itself, not exactly a rolling motion, more like a sidewinder snake.  Some of the glass panes would lift up as others pushed, and he would move along in pieces, very low to the ground.  The movement made a scraping and sometimes a squeaking sound, and Sherlock wondered how all the edges of the glass hadn't worn smooth as beach glass from all the grinding along in that way.
He stopped to gather himself for a moment.  He leaned so that his hands and his free lower leg surrounded the last leg.  He succeeded inch by inch in drawing the leg up.  If he could just get his free ankle room to bend.  Yes!  He got one foot under him, extending his leg, and at last stood free on top of the car.  He leapt down and started running.  It was not the most unobtrusive getaway he had ever made, shoeless and dripping a trail of steam from his coat, and reeking of burnt plastic, but he would take it.
Sherlock looked at her and wondered whether a blue glow would show up on her, but she just looked grayish.  After he stared at her for a couple of seconds, she said, "Well, do you want me to rinse off your coat for you?  There's a hose out back.  I wouldn't know how to dry it, but I could at least get the saltwater out."
"Why would I do that?"  He circled out to see around the corner of the building, and make sure she didn't have an accomplice sneaking up on him.
"You'll never get her back this way," Sherlock shouted.  "You're too scared to climb out of that tank, and meet her face to face.  Any MAN who was not afraid of women would hardly wrap a giant metal tank around himself."  Sherlock hoped he wouldn't be reduced to making imitation chicken noises at the demon.
As he walked through the tugboat's door that he had wrenched open, he felt like there was something standing behind him about to scream.  He looked, but nothing was there.  He looked again.
The water woman was still there.  It didn't look as though she had attempted to stab him, either.  Definitely one up on other places he'd slept.  Sherlock fished through his pockets to see if his phone had come back, and so it had.  It was working and didn't appear water damaged.  He noticed that Lestrade's ID also looked different now.  This ID was now good until the first of January, 2019.  Lestrade was much greyer in the picture, and was smiling less.  And there was now a red and blue guilloche pattern printed all across the identification, picture included.
After a few more words here and there, the man in white and gold ceremonial garb posed for a picture with a couple of adults and a baby.  He told the couple he would meet them at their house, and then he walked briskly over to Sherlock and asked, "Can I help you?"
"Maybe you're not exactly who I took you for at first."  She looked down at his sleeve, where it was torn through the shirt and the jacket, and several of his new tattoos showed.
It was a pretty big building, but so far didn't seem any worse than a run-of-the-mill cheap hotel where the near-homeless, alcoholics, drug addicts, and the untreated mentally ill lived.  Eventually he got up to the roof.
Well, he supposed the best thing to do was to go back to the store where he had melted the candle.  But perhaps not touch anything once he was inside.
"Why?  What about free will?  Are you only a clockwork that runs in its tracks and never turns aside?  What good is having a soul if you never use it for free will?  Maybe you do have to kill me.  Do you have to kill me at this exact moment?  Have I attacked you?  Watch."
Sherlock pulled out the sharpened money clip and used it to cut his coat into a long strip, spiraling around and around to get the longest piece possible.  If two wheels on the same side of the tank were tied together, it would turn towards the tangled side because those wheels were stopped.  And Sherlock was definitely a faster runner than seemed quite natural.  Perhaps he would be able to manage it.  He laid out the coat strip so that he could quickly deploy it around the tank's wheels.
Sherlock stepped hard down onto a road, and kept running.  He wiped his hands across his face again to check that all the glass was off, and then opened his eyes.  He looked back the way he had come, and he could see a human-sized shape running behind him, with some parts dark, some parts allowing the light through, and some parts reflecting the light.
The man in the suit turned his hand, and there was another airline ticket that he pressed upon Sherlock.    "If you're going to keep rounding up demons anyway, you might as well get cracking.  See you soon."
The window next to him made a chirping noise, as though a crack had run up it.  The gold must have been pouring through the bottom edge of the window, down the other outside windows, and down to the street.  Although now that one edge of the window was out, maybe he could manage to break the rest of it off.  He recalled the case of a Toronto lawyer who had fallen to his death demonstrating to a class of law students that the windows in skyscrapers were made to be unbreakable in any normal circumstances.  The man had leapt up against the window and slammed it with his shoulder, and the entire thing had popped off its frame, and gone with him to the street below.  And now Sherlock was a little stronger than usual, and significantly more indestructible.
The whole area was black and flattened-looking.  The brush and low trees had burned along with the grass, leaving the sharpened black stakes of tree trunks pointing skyward.  The usual fast food soda cups and crisp bags were gone.  There was a distorted shopping cart, and the metal remains of a chair, but everything else had burned away.
In 1962, a woman committing suicide at the hotel landed on a pedestrian and killed him, too.  That was really just a one-off, though.
The assistant with glasses took a tourniquet and some vials and a needle out of his case and moved toward Sherlock.  Sherlock tensed up and something about his posture shifted.  "You get back."
Sherlock found a semi-surreptitious set of stairs to sit on while he waited for the furore at Mackler Securities to die down, and then he went back that night.
With some of them, it was believing everyone was mean to them.  So what?  The whole world was mean to everyone all the time.  Wah, wah, wah.
He was starting to grow concerned he was burning down a pig shed to no purpose when parts of the roof started falling down onto the pig parts.  It was hard to tell with all the creaking and crackling from the fire, but he thought he heard the pile move.  He stood as far back as he could get, but the buildings were fairly close together.  A big chunk of meat rolled out of the shed and through the fence.  Sherlock took a few steps closer to it.  It wasn't a piece that had an eye in it, so he waited.
As he waited to cross the street, Sherlock stopped a moment outside a convenience store where the checkout counter was so close to the door, he could easily hear the employees changing shifts.  A young woman in hijab, so young that the circumstances suggested the convenience store was a family business, was saying, "Still no bread truck, so Dad's checking up on them.  Mom also said to give you these.  The cookies have nuts in them."
Sherlock wandered the cemetery, looking at the ages at death, and the style of monument.  It certainly didn't have the disordered confusion of the oldest European cemeteries, but neither did it have the straight rows and identical markers of a military cemetery.
Mycroft looked intently at Sherlock for a moment before he spoke. "Dear brother," he said, "I haven't heard you play your violin in years. Would you indulge me?"
"For God's sake, John! I'm not one of your emergency department bath salts cases!" The man who looked like Sherlock flung the knife across the front room.
It was painful, but it wasn't the most painful thing that had ever happened to him.  He looked at it as it burned away.  Sherlock squeezed the water out of his coat as well as he could, and then laid the coat out flat on the roof.  Los Angeles was very warm for December, and Sherlock pondered what he would do next.  He turned to check the height of the sun, and there was the man in the suit, the overly-symmetrical man, standing just a few feet away.
Sherlock had meandered through all the buildings inside the cemetery wall by the time people started showing up to see the movie.
Sherlock pasted on a friendly smile.  "There's nothing I like more than traditional English baked goods."
Sherlock hadn't felt he could stand, hadn't intended to stand, but he immediately got to his feet.  Sherlock’s mind whirled.  What was this?  Could he be having some odd little flickers of consciousness as his brain used up the last of its oxygen and slowed to a stop?  This whole situation was very unlike the reality he knew.
A man sat in a purple folding beach chair at the end of the row of tents.  He had several partially-used tubs of popcorn sitting next to him bearing the lurid logo of a nearby theater.  He appeared to be working his way through them, one kernel of popcorn at a time.  His hair was both dusty and greasy, and his jacket was a bleached-out indeterminable color, most likely originally brown.  His blue jeans only had a few blue spots left at the corners under all the dirt.  As Sherlock came even with him, he found his eyes irresistibly drawn to the man, who turned out to be that man who usually wore the suit.
"Oh, no.  She's my 'work wife'," Sherlock laughed.  This perplexed the clerk greatly, and her face made a rather intriguing transition from laughter to confusion, and then back to polite smiling.  With that, Sherlock headed off towards the security line and whats-her-name headed off wherever.
Sherlock waited until the tank circled behind a passenger-car-sized concrete block in the parking lot, and lit the Molotov cocktail on fire.  He ran quickly to the tank and threw the little bottle at what appeared to be the air intake, but the bottle burst with a flash, leaving only a black singe mark on the tank's side.  He retreated behind the concrete block and waited, but it appeared to have had no effect at all.  Looking down, he saw that the rolled-up bills had melted into a cold black lump.  He really must complain to Mycroft about the burn time of the currency.
As the bubbles cleared from the water, he thought he saw a glow next to his arm, so he grabbed for it.  It was something round and rubbery.  He dug his fingers into it, and all of a sudden the thing holding him twisted around violently.  So that had hurt it?  Sherlock punched the rubbery glowing thing as hard as he could, and his arm ruptured it and sunk in.  The thing twisted and shook him, and then the whole tank glowed orange.  It looked like he was wrapped in some tentacles, maybe a giant squid.  He had only a moment to observe this as the thing heated up, and the steam caused the lid to flip up off the tank and land so it was only partly blocking the light.  Sherlock kicked the heated squid off of him, got hold of the edge of the tank, and dragged himself out.  He landed down on the ground, missing the ladder, and coughed up all the water that had gone into his lungs.  His eyes watered, but he turned to see the steam billowing out of the open water tank.
The demon dove back at him with the shard of ice.  They grappled, and Sherlock pushed the demon down so that his arm holding the ice was pinned under Sherlock's shoulder.  Sherlock ended up with one hand holding the demon's empty hand away from him, and his other hand free.  Sherlock reached into the coat pocket.  He fished around and pulled out the padlock he had taken off of the tugboat door, throwing it to the side, and then he found what he was looking for, the wash bottle full of alcohol.  It wasn't much, only 250 mL, but it would have to serve.
But surely there was something out of the ordinary.  He might go and see about the Gilgo Beach killer, even though it was a little way out of town.  Son of Sam?  Still alive in jail, so presumably not a demon.
The homeless woman who had thrown a bucket of water over Sherlock set a bizarre-looking canned beverage in front of him.  It was all black, with neon green lightning bolts down the front of it.  She seemed very insistent that he take it, and come to think of it, he hadn't had anything to drink in awhile.  John would probably want him to drink something at least, if he had known Sherlock still existed.  It was warm and fizzed over a little when he popped the top.
"I'm so sorry.  I was supposed to meet my girlfriend here, and I thought she was on the seventeenth floor--"
"You don't see that wrinkle there?  You can't get that any other way but a dentist leaning on you.  No wonder so many murders go unsolved."
He stabbed Mackler in the eye with his own gold blood drop.  It looked really strange in his lie-detecting vision.  Instead of a burst of fire, it went from blue swirls in the air, to entirely dark, like a film of an explosion run backwards.  It was the greatest outlier other than that repentant poisoner.  Sherlock gathered himself up off the floor, tested his foot to see if he could walk on it, and headed towards the stairs, and on his way back to the airport.
The other man stepped closer to Sherlock, ignoring Moriarty. "Sherlock Holmes, how do you do? Have you deduced where you are yet?"
Sherlock looked up the website for the cemetery on his phone.  Oddly enough for an American cemetery, it had a movie night.  Apparently tonight would be "Howl's Moving Castle" followed by "Rashomon".
Then there was Johann Unterweger, the Austrian serial killer who wrote an autobiography which was apparently of such great literary merit that various literary lights agitated for his pardon.  Then after he was pardoned, he immediately went back to murdering prostitutes.  He visited LA, stayed at the Cecil Hotel, apparently in homage to Ramirez, murdered several more people, and was arrested by the FBI in Miami in 1992.
As the tank pushed towards the CHP building, it knocked down one of the lighted arms, and dragged it along, without exerting any visible additional effort.  It dragged the pole and attached arm all the way until it came to the next light pole and arm, when the first one it was dragging caught on the still-standing pole, and was pulled off of the tank.
The man stood with his feet apart, ready to react, and Sherlock said to him, "So, why would you want to cut off the left side of the face?"
The assistant with glasses was eventually persuaded to accept the blood, and told that if any issues arose, they would be dealt with then.  After all, there were five witnesses to the blood being drawn.  The assistant without glasses then took out some sort of camera with a light on it that was meant to photograph the iris of the eye.  He explained that permanent eye color implants were apparently easy enough to accomplish, but when he asked Sherlock to tip his head back, Sherlock wouldn't let him anywhere near, either.  "No, only John," he said, "only John."
Sherlock squeezed as much of the saltwater as he could out of his coat and jacket, and headed away from the sunken boat.  He pondered how the Haitian woman from the shop could've possibly had occasion to walk by the tugboat pier.  It really didn't seem to be a busy place, or on the way to or from anywhere.  He supposed he would walk back to the shop and see if he could shed some light on the situation.
Well, he'd already made a huge amount of noise already; no reason not to make more.  He picked up a rusty metal bar that lay against the side of the boat, and used it to pry the padlock off of the nearest door to him.  It wasn't completely dark inside the tugboat.  Light came in through the portholes and through gaps around the doors, and through little spots in the corners of the walls that had rusted completely through.  He hooked open the door so it wouldn't easily slam shut behind him, and dropped the broken lock in his pocket.
"Warming stuff," he said to the proprietor.  "So, if you were looking for a demon, where would you go?"
"Well speaking of loose body parts, we've got some partial faces that were found on the coast.  Haven't had a DNA hit on a single one of them, but they're still very fresh.  Would you like to come by and take a look?"
Sherlock was shown to his seat by the hostess, and he ordered kitsune udon in Japanese.  Only a moment later he saw someone approach the booth.  He had thought that was awfully fast, even for noodle soup, but he looked up into the face of the overly symmetrical man in the suit.
Sherlock dropped the demon's wrist as it heated up quickly and burned his hand.  He got back to his feet and turned to fight, but it seemed that was unnecessary, as the demon blazed brightly and all the smoke dissipated, leaving nothing behind.  The ice all over the ground steamed away in an instant, and the sidewalk was dry again.  People walked up and down the sidewalk as though they had noticed nothing.  It was a quiet fight, certainly, but not all of them were absorbed in their smartphones.  Sherlock tried to figure out what had happened.  He knelt down on his coat again, which squelched.  It was still soggy.  Nothing new was on the sidewalk, except the empty alcohol bottle, and the broken padlock.  He supposed that since the tugboat demon had boiled away when hit in the eye, this ice demon must've somehow landed wrong on the padlock.  There really should've been instructions on this demon catching lark.  He sat down in the middle of his coat.  Someone passing by threw down two coins onto the coat in front of him.
Another month passed.  Sherlock figured he probably wouldn't be seeing the poisoner again.  Or he would, but it would be significantly more work.  He had gathered up L1800 and taken them to the closest currency exchange, which was still the airport.  The woman--Reina, Rachel--whatever her name was, had come with him, and had got a few looks, but no one had thrown her out of the airport, so they split up their money under the disapproving eyes of the exchange clerk.
The priest's face fell a little, but he tried to control it.  "Well, are you seeing or hearing demons?  Sometimes it can seem like you're hearing or seeing very strange things, but it's really just a chemical imbalance."
Sherlock wondered if the sky wasn't getting darker above him.  It wasn't near time for sunset, though.  The demon started to stalk towards Sherlock, and Sherlock put a foot back to brace himself, and almost fell.  He skipped backwards to keep his footing.  The sidewalk was all icy underneath him.  The demon was still approaching and seemed to have no traction problems.  He leapt and tackled Sherlock, whose feet immediately slid out from underneath him.  The demon reared back and swiped at Sherlock's face.  Sherlock tried to roll, but his wet coat had frozen to the icy sidewalk.  Sherlock kicked at the demon, and tried to sit up as hard as he could, until at one heave, the coat tore, and his arms came free.
John looked over at the Sherlock impostor.  Sherlock had had such unusual bright eyes, and this man's seemed, if anything, brighter and more reflective, almost glowing.  He certainly did look like him.  This man was even wearing the exact same suit and the exact same violet shirt Sherlock had been wearing when they took him away.
Sherlock got himself to his feet.  Apparently there was no more evidence of the ice "demon" around, and sitting on the sidewalk all day wouldn't get him back to John.  None of the passersby looked at him, but as he picked up his coat, he saw that the Haitian woman had come to the door of the shop and was looking at him.  "You'd better come in, I suppose."
She turned around and led him in.  "I saw what happened.  Did that follow you from the number four pier?"  She stopped and turned to look at him.  "Were you bathing in the sea?  What's that smell?"
Going through the office with more time on his hands, Sherlock planned to see which exact desk was the demon's, since he had seen the demon typing and his height and so forth.  It was easy enough to discard some of the desks based on the angle of the keyboard and mouse.  He put all the computer screens in his mind palace and sorted through them.  That one was very smeared with fingerprints, either someone with floaters in their eyes, or an abuser of stimulants who constantly saw delusory specks of dust.  Unimportant.
The woman walked up to him.  "Awful, isn't it?" she asked.  "People throw their garbage everywhere and don't care what happens."
He came to the end of the hallway, and there was a much larger room there.  It reached down into the hull of the ship, and there were all sorts of bronze knobs and bars and cylinders sticking out of everything.  The boat must have kept fairly dry, because much of the bronze was still shiny and hadn't gone green.  It was very oily smelling in this room.  He was standing on a grating surrounded by a rail, with a ship's ladder leading down off of it, so he turned to climb down the ladder facing the steps.  He looked where he was putting his feet, and when he was almost to the bottom, he looked up level with where he was, to see a man standing behind the steps staring at him.
After an hour or so of walking, a shop caught his attention.  The metal roll-up door was raised, and the shop was open for business.  There were all sorts of religious-looking statues in the windows, and a sign mentioning love spells.  Sherlock walked in through the propped-open glass door.  Inside were rows of white metal shelves with hundreds of candles on them.  Many of the candles were plain, but quite a few of them were in tall, narrow glass jars with various human-looking characters on them.
Sherlock awoke, gasping.  As his brain shifted from sleep to taking in the situation, he felt that he was all wet, and saw that there was a woman in front of him, holding a white plastic bucket.  Her black clothing had gathered enough dirt to turn a brownish color, except for the tops of the shoulders, which had bleached out gray, and her hair stuck up at odd angles.  She looked at him, seemed to see the reaction she was looking for, and said, "You were burning with hell fire.  I had to put it out."
But beside the airflow for the engine, Sherlock thought there must be another aperture.  If he recalled, some tanks had escape hatches for the crew in case of the tank turning over.  There was less than half a metre of space underneath this tank.  Ah well, he had wormed into smaller places.  As soon as Sherlock jumped underneath, the driver rotated the tank around its axis, spinning one tread forward and one tread backward.  Sherlock put out his arms so he could scoot around under the tank and stay out from under the treads.  He was on his side and he had to keep his upper shoulder low to keep it from contacting the bottom surface of the tank hull and dragging him.
The reflection changed, and Sherlock leapt over the fence of his niche, and threw the key ball as hard as he could at the glass man.  It hit where he intended, and the plane with the eyespot cracked with a low "tick".
First things first, he might see if he could soak his money in alcohol and perhaps make a small Molotov cocktail out of the wash bottle.  He didn't have a schematic of this particular tank in his mind palace, so he would have to find some part of the tank that was vulnerable to fire.  Maybe the air intake?
The Cecil Hotel was a brick building, about 15 stories high, with the name painted on the side in faded white paint wearing off at the edges of the bricks.  He recalled the case of the girl who drowned in the water tank on top of the building, and how her body had been floating in the water tank for several weeks while people in the hotel used the water.
The mass-murderer sort often thought that, and this demon seemed to be more of that ilk.  That sort of man refused to admit that he was personally offputting, but blamed everyone else.  Sherlock danced around the tank, yelling more things as they occurred to him.  It was easy enough to recall things people had said to Sherlock himself.  The blue light engulfing the tank sputtered and cycled, with some relation to what Sherlock shouted.  Then he really thought of a 'zinger'.  "No one will ever love you again!"
Going through the aiport security was reasonably painless.  The flight itself was unremarkable, and he landed at Vancouver only a few minutes late.
"Not at all.  I happen to know you're at a standstill on finding demons, and I know where you might go to find another one.  Isn't that nice of me?"  He smiled.
Sherlock crossed the hallway, rounded a corner, and stopped to listen and let his eyes adjust.  He didn't hear any pounding footsteps, but he wasn't sure the glass man would make that sort of sound.  After what seemed too long, Sherlock crouched down, and looked around the corner.  He didn't see anyone walking, but there was something on the floor and it took a moment for him to interpret it.
He looked from John back to Sherlock.  "Would you favour us with something a little more classical?"
The man didn't say a word, but all of a sudden, he was replaced by a cloud.  The cloud passed through the stairs onto Sherlock.  It was horribly hot and wet on his face.  It was impeding his breathing, too.  The longest he had ever held his breath was three minutes, forty-one seconds, but he didn't think he could last that long with a lungful of steam.  How could he fight steam?  Well, here went nothing.  Sherlock pulled back the rusty metal bar in his hand, and drove it as hard as he could into the side of the boat.  It worked.  Saltwater started spraying into the room.  He punched a couple more holes just to make sure.
Sherlock flung out his arm as he started to roll. He was awake now, and someone was leaning over him, pushing him around. The man grabbed something out of Sherlock's pocket, and Sherlock grabbed his wrist. The man struck at him with his other hand, looked stunned for a moment, and then twisted his hand free and scuttled out from under the overpass at top speed. Sherlock sat up and checked his pockets. It looked like the thief had his money clip. Sherlock still had his phone and everything else, even the tooth.  Well, a couple inactive credit cards and a hundred pounds wouldn't have got him very far in LA. He looked down. Something glinted on the concrete by his hand. He picked it up to look at it. It was a large piece of a broken blade. He felt something jab him as he turned. There were another couple of the things inside of his shirt. He got out from under the overpass to shake out the pieces.
Working his way North, Sherlock looked up and saw that above street-level, there was one building that stood out greatly from all the blue glow on it.  There were just the typical swirls of blue and the occasional swirl of gray truthfulness amongst the pedestrians around him, but up high, one building stood out for being entirely aglow in blue.  It reminded Sherlock of a movie John had once insisted upon watching in his presence.  Took place in New York City, dark haired woman in a red dress, demon dog, light going up to the sky-couldn't remember much about it, really, except that John had asked him pointedly if the woman reminded him of anyone.  There weren't demon dogs, were there?  Ugh, there probably were.
"So...did you want to talk about some personal demons you have?" the priest asked hopefully, when they were seated in the office.
The woman picked him out whatever it was he'd ordered, and the man looked back at Sherlock, startled.  "Oh," he said, "you're a Londoner, too?"
Sherlock came by the Vancouver General Hospital early the next morning.  He phoned and Gutteridge met him at the front desk.  As they walked back to the morgue, Gutteridge talked about his childhood in Essex.  He went on about how delightful it was to talk to someone with a normal accent.
He searched his pockets.  Apparently the sword letter opener had been lost, either in the office, or  in escaping from the car.
Could it really be that simple to see God?  To take some artifical, constructed chemical, a few carbons and hydrogens stuck together somehow or other, and then know the entirety of existence?  If all it took was some small chemical, how difficult must it be not to see God, for the lack of one molecule, to go through life failing to notice the entire occupied world?
"Wer ein holdes Weib errungen" means "Who has got a good wife?"  It is the finale from Fidelio, Beethoven's only opera.
Sherlock staggered to his feet, in his torn dress shirt, and his bleeding scalp, and his split-open shoes, his head bowed.  He saw the Marine's sword move up, and it came to rest lightly, the barest scratch, against his forehead.   He wondered if this was the end of him.  If he could just see John one more time, he would cheerfully accept an eternity of burning.  The burning pain went away as everything Sherlock could see dissolved in a blaze of light.
Sherlock had both hands free.  How long would it take Mackler to get down to the ground floor?  Would he take the elevator?  Would he jump?  Would he be concerned about getting the gold drool cleaned up and appearing normal to others?  Surely even he couldn't manage to threaten or trick all those other people into silence.
Sherlock walked through the rest of the cemetery, keeping out of direct view of the people watching the movie.  Not that they were an observant enough crowd to see him, anyway.  Maybe one of the guards was slightly paying attention.
Sherlock picked up a candle in a glass jar to examine it.  There was a man in a monk's robes on it.  That was as far as he got before he noticed his own fingers were sinking into the surface of the jar, melting through the glass and into the candle.
Sherlock was once again walking up and down the entire length of Wiltshire, hoping to find something of interest, when he saw out of the corner of his eye, someone move into step beside him.
The lady leaned forward across the counter.  "Look, I have different places I get my ceremonial goods, and they're not all from a catalog.  Some things are better from other sources, and that's all I will say."
She came out again and said she still had no idea about where he might find demons, and she'd be closing up soon, so he might as well get on his way.  She'd appreciate if he didn't lead any more demons to her store.  She also told him the way to the Cecil Hotel.  He put the coat on, and stuffed the bag of things in the pocket.  They were all things that wouldn't much be bothered by the damp, or were already past help.  He set off, and the woman watched him until he was out of the alley.
It was always difficult to draw a line between what the average idiot would know, and Sherlock took a few minutes to give the impression he was only a passerby, of average intelligence.  He was always almost surprised by how Americans thought someone with a British accent must be intelligent, even when he was clearly portraying a vapid businessman tourist.
Sherlock didn't have a knife because he had followed the posted rules on Greyhound, but it turned out no one checked at all.  He thought they had changed the rules after the beheading in Manitoba.  Sherlock pulled his money out of the money clip and started scrubbing the edge of the clip against the concrete pavement.  It was nowhere near as good as having a knife.
The woman reached for a bottle on a high shelf, one that did not appear to be commercially prepared, and had rather an orangish tint to it.  The bottle was dusty and was unlikely to have been prepared with him in mind, as he had only been in Los Angeles two days.  She poured him out rather a lot of the drink, and as he lifted it to his face, he considered what might be in it.  There was definitely alcohol wafting off it.  It seemed that the orange tint was from something hot, a chili pepper of some sort.  He took a large swig anyway, and smiled pleasantly before the heat kicked in.  He tried his best not to make an unpleasant face.  At least it wasn't a ghost pepper or a scotch bonnet.  He wished he had had a few cigarettes before this, though.
As Sherlock waited, a few fireflies bounced about the bus shelter.  The bus was as buses were, not the worst, not the best.  As the bus wended its way towards Manhattan, eventually the Statue of Liberty was visible from some angles.  Besides some larger ferryboats, there were also many very small ferryboats.
Everyone in the room turned their heads quickly to keep their eyes on Sherlock.  The assistant stopped where he was.  "John can do it," Sherlock said.
The assistant with glasses looked at the vial of blood John was drawing.  The assistant sorted through the extra empty glass vials and pulled out another one.
"Well, there is an old tugboat at the number four pier.  I always hate going by it.  I don't know why.  There could be something there, maybe."
Mycroft took a deep breath.  "Now, as I'm certain you wish to prove yourself to be Sherlock Holmes, you won't have any objections to a series of tests which would demonstrate that."
John Watson sat in his armchair at 221B Baker Street, his newspaper in his lap. The headlines didn't hold the same interest for him they used to have, and these days he hardly ever found himself thinking, "I wonder if Sherlock's seen this article?" Still, not a day went by he didn't miss the man.
A creature came out of the darkness and took Sherlock's hand. The creature had a human shape, but was entirely covered in gray, ratty feathers, which appeared to grow out of its body. Its hand was dry and porous feeling, like clay soil, and the creature had a very firm grip. Sherlock thought he might've actually preferred Moriarty's hand. Reddish clay clotted the feathers of the creature's face. Sherlock couldn't see the creature's eyes. Perhaps that was for the best. Sherlock looked back over his shoulder as the creature dragged him into the darkness. Moriarty had his mouth back, and his grin back, and the other man in a suit was whispering into his ear.
What was the kind of man inside this tank, and what would most rile him up so he would come out to yell?  With some of these sorts of people, the inciting incident was romantic disappointment.  How could anyone care about romance?  It was stupid.  It was the kind of trash John would be overly concerned about.
"I came here to ask about actual demons; not schizophrenia.  Don't you people do exorcisms?  Thought I saw that on the news."  Sherlock waved his hand.  Was that the news?  Unimportant.
For a moment they circled each other, then the demon tried to tackle Sherlock again.  Sherlock got out of the way this time, and the demon hit the sidewalk.  The demon dug his fingers into the icy sidewalk, and pulled up a large, pointy shard of ice.  Sherlock came at the demon from the side, and got ahold of his wrists before he could turn the weapon on Sherlock.  Sherlock shook the demon's arm as hard as he could, but he couldn't get him to let go of the piece of ice.
Now that the water had stopped dripping into Sherlock's eyes, he took a better look at the woman, in the unlikely event he had missed something at first glance.  She hadn't needed another look.  That was at least 120 days of London sunlight for the bleaching at the top of her black sweatshirt's shoulders.  Couldn't be less than half that for Los Angeles.  There were definitely plenty of hiding spaces around the campsite that more clothes could fit.  Say ten suits of clothes, equally worn, would make a year and a half.  All of them appeared to be heavy-duty work pants, fit to her, so heavier work, like gardening or landscaping.  When a house payment got to be too much, one of the first luxuries to go was the gardener.  It had been a financial accident; she seemed much more together so far than some of the people he met out in the wild.
The other man in the suit looked up towards the sky.  After a moment of looking up, he sighed, theatrically, and brought his gaze back upon Sherlock.  "It appears the court against which there is no appeal has rendered its verdict.  That soul counts towards your 113."
The man broke into actual laughter.  "Oh, that was dumb, kiddo.  All by yourself."  He looked Sherlock up and down and then charged him.  Sherlock got the folded aluminium shiv out of his pocket and slashed at the man as he went past, but didn't manage to get his eye.
Besides the blood draw and the eye exam, John also found himself shanghaied into doing a 12-lead EKG, and an electronic fingerprinting.  Eventually, he had worked his way through all the testing equipment that had been brought.
Father Philip turned to Sherlock and said, with a slightly more genuine look to his face, "Would you like to come talk in my office?"
There were some large trucks in the cemetery, which seemed to be setting up chairs and sound equipment, over by the largest stand-alone monuments to the East.
Sherlock found no excess murders in New York above the expected amount of white noise.  He hadn't heard of demons wandering the streets, or at least nothing from any source less spurious than the usual sort writing about secret lizard people.
There was a thunking and squeaking around him as some of the other furniture in the room knocked together.  The desk he lay on moved jerkily, and then began sliding across the room.  Blinded by the steam, he could only suppose that all four legs were being carried on the gold drool.  It was excruciatingly hot.  There was a clunk, as the desk hit the floor-to-ceiling window.  Sherlock reached into his pocket, pulled out the rinse bottle of alcohol, and threw it back in Mackler's last known direction.  He heard a small whuff as it caught fire.
Then Sherlock went around to the dock the boat was tied to.  He could see from that side that there was no gangway or ladder, and the side of the boat was much further than he could easily step across.  Sherlock took a running jump and overshot his mark so far he almost went over the far side of the boat.   He bounced off the railing and landed on his feet on the deck with a loud clang.  The pitted decks were metal.  That certainly would've alerted anyone on the boat.
The assistant received that vial and held it up to his face to squint at it, too.  "I'm still not sure about this."
As Sherlock paced through the site, he saw something that was not sticks and not metal.  They were human remains.  The remains were still articulated, but the skin was generally burned away.  No large animals had returned to disturb them.
He was going about this the wrong way.  He had got out of the habit of thinking circles around his opponents.  A physical fight against an armoured metal can with something squishy inside was a fool's errand.  It was like trying to figure out a password for a computer system--it was far easier to do an end run and find where some idiot had left the password on a post-it note on their desk, or to phone up and pretend to be fixing the computers.  Don't attack the armour, attack the wetware.  Sherlock was smarter than everyone else, except Mycroft, maybe, sometimes, and he was going to use his wits to get this hermit crab out of his shell.
Sherlock looked at the bases of the trees as he walked along.  Nothing too interesting seemed to be caught there--plastic shopping bags, bottle caps, cigarette butts mostly.
Sherlock walked off.  That seemed peculiarly easy.  Who just invited people to look at dead bodies like that?  Other than himself, he supposed.  Sherlock walked all the way back to the park outside his hostel and sat on a bench.  The cherry trees were all bare sticks.  He looked at the paper bag he still had with him, and opened it up.  It was a hot cross bun.  He really hadn't had one of those in forever, and did miss them from when he was a child.  He wondered if it would burn his tongue, with the cross and all.  He put it in his mouth.  It didn't.
Sherlock pulled his chin back quickly, like a spooked animal, as John reached for him, and then got control of himself and pointed his chin forward again.  Sherlock was panting and looking extremely agitated, and his eyes were tearing up. "God! You're burning up!" John said as he lifted Sherlock's chin.
"How would you avoid me?  What is consecrated ground?  Where does it start?" he asked, stepping one step closer each time.  "Is it at the gates?  Is it the road that goes through the cemetery?"
She took out her lighter, shook it around, and as she lit her cigarette, the firelight reflected off her eyes.
"Yep.  Got it in one.  You know how it is; somebody's child goes overseas on holiday and they never hear from them again.  I was thinking about all those spare feet that washed up."
He rolled so that he could feel the ice blade under his shoulder, and then sprayed the wash bottle back over his shoulder onto the demon's hand.  He felt the demon's arm twitch as he lost his grip on the piece of ice, as it melted under the spray of alcohol.  And then the bottle of alcohol was out.
He examined his clothing and found that the collar of his shirt was cut all the way through and the son of a bitch had even cut the collar of his Belstaff greatcoat. He would've expected to be bleeding. How odd. It was dark out, but not too dark to see that the coat had been cut from his shoulder towards his neck, moving proximally rather than moving distally. The man hadn't been leaning over him sawing away at his collar, but was he not cut at all?
As the tank turned, it rode up onto a parked car, and the windows burst out as the car was crushed, spraying glass far and wide.
There was a sharp screech from the hallway where the glass man was crawling, and Sherlock took off running without looking back.  He ran down the hall and turned into another hallway.
Ranged along the pavement were all sorts of people lying on their backs on yoga mats.  Very trendy-looking sorts with the newest, sportiest-looking clothes.  In the pose called shavasana.  Nothing could be more necessary to an old Indian form of meditation than synthetic wicking fabric.  He wove amongst all the people laid out on their pink and ecru mats, their eyes closed, and their legs and arms relaxed.  Unusual to see them still breathing, though.  The tarps underneath the dead bodies at mass casualty incidents he had been to were about as cheerful as these people's yoga mats, but corpses generally wore a greater variety of clothing, and the stillness of corpses was even comforting.  Mortui non mordant.  The dead do not bite.
Sherlock had an instant to feel offended before he felt as though all his skin was burning. Smoke twisted out from under his clothes, and there was a nauseating burned meat smell. Sherlock found he was on his hands and knees, gagging.
He searched his memory for anything of note that had happened in Los Angeles.  There was the girl who had drowned in the water tank on top of the Cecil Hotel, a hotel which had also served as a base of operations for serial killers Richard Ramirez and Johann Unterweger.  Sherlock looked up the address and route on his phone and began to walk.
The rest stop had large stones reeking of artificiality set into the side of it, to make it look more desert-like, or mid-century modern or something.  It had a flat roof, and the parts that weren't crammed with rocks were tan or bare concrete, or off-white trim.
The man sitting at the receptionist's desk was only a few centimetres shorter than Sherlock, but his office chair was set so that the seat was as low as it could possibly go.  No one typing away at that speed could be so technically inept as to be unable to adjust the chair to his own height.  Ergo, not really the receptionist.
He stood.  He fished in the pocket of his coat for the bottle of isopropyl alcohol.  Turning his coat sleeves inside-out, he used the wash bottle to distribute alcohol onto the armpit area of both sides to make sure he smelled as socially acceptable as possible, in case anyone could smell anything over the smoke.  He still couldn't figure out why people would use Febreze when it cost so much more than plain alcohol and had a horrible artificial fragrance to boot.  Lack of chemistry knowledge, apparently. Then he phoned the police.
Anyway, in the end it accomplished what he wanted, and the corpse was taken away to the medical examiner's to begin a process that would end in the unclaimed remains being dumped into a mass grave with other indigent persons.  It was what she would have wanted.
Each partial face was in its own drawer, even though that didn't seem like a very efficient use of space.  The first drawer was a female, somewhere between puberty and about 50 years old, depending on environmental exposure, who had had braces, but had had them removed more than five years ago.  So the lower limit on the age should be more towards 20 years old.  Not as much information as he would've hoped.  He looked in the next drawer.
The man had apparently circled as far as he wanted to, as he then turned around and ran.  Sherlock chased after him, but he immediately lost sight of him in between all the barns and sheds.  There had been a constant background noise of pigs snuffling and squeaking at each other, but as Sherlock ran, he could hear the pigs start screaming, dozens of them at least, all making a high-pitched noise.  He didn't know much about pigs, but he thought they sounded terrified.
Sherlock woke in the morning just as the sun rose.  He set out to see what he could see.  He had walked several kilometres when he found himself passing a bakery that declared itself to be Traditional and English and was covered in Union Jacks.  He glanced briefly into the window and saw a rather oddly dressed man in the queue.  The man looked outfitted for the 1920's, hat and all, but his shirt cuffs and trouser cuffs were the right length and had never been let out.  He was only about 35 years old, but he didn't look like a modern person wearing antique clothes; he looked as though they had been his clothes the whole time.  He thought he might stick his head in the bakery and see what that was all about.
The part of Los Angeles he traveled through back to his haunts looked undamaged, even with all the smoke stains adhering to the walls, fences, and street signs.  As he got closer to the usual spot, he saw that the hillside, instead of being a light yellow wheat color, had been scorched into a fresh black.  He took his bearings off the shopping mall and two nearby mountains just in case the impossible had happened and his mind's eye had failed him.  It was definitely the spot where he had been residing.
It was April 6, 2012.  He had found a few more demons in the months since he had come up to LA.  The one with the metal spines had been especially difficult to defeat.
When they got into the cooler lockers, Gutteridge started telling him how none of the pieces of faces were from the same person.  No skull, no teeth, no eyes, eyebrows, or scalp hair.  Just the flat part of the left cheek for three different people, and a fourth with attached skin down the side of the jaw and including the skin from the neck.  Not even a little bit of ear or nose.  Just the corner of the lips.
After about ten minutes, a police car arrived with its lights on and pulled onto the bare, black ground of the median.  The officer sat in the car for a few minutes before getting out.  He approached Sherlock.
The man considered him for a moment and said, "You've only found a left face?  I've cut off a lot more pieces than that.  That's a little disappointing, actually."
It was too dark to track down his money clip tonight. Sherlock moved out to the grassy median next to the overpass. It would probably be unwise to return to the same spot to sleep. He lay down in the high yellow grass and went to sleep.
What would be the problem with that?  There had to be a catch.  The other man probably thought Sherlock would drag John down with him.  "I've learned to look before I leap.  If my soul's so worthless, why not just give it back?"
The candle burst.  Sherlock winced and checked his hand for cuts.  From another part of the store, he heard a woman mutter in Haitian, "Oh, what now?" and her footsteps came towards him.  It didn't look as though the glass had cut him, but parts of the candle had been propelled all over the floor and several of the shelves.  It was a very peculiar burst pattern, different from a thrown or dropped object.  Maybe he would have time to experiment with small explosives to see about replicating the pattern.  Sherlock noticed that the woman, apparently the store's owner, had stopped at the end of the aisle, and was staring at him wide-eyed rather than berating him for breaking her merchandise.  Which was fortunate, as he had no American money to pay for the candle.  He would have to see what he could do to talk his way out of the situation.  Sherlock turned to the woman and said, in the Haitian he had picked up from his time in Miami, "I am terribly sorry, madam."
What about getting the air intake open, and feeding gravel into the engine?  There was a runaway truck ramp not too far away, that consisted entirely of gravel, with another big pile of gravel at the end.  Sherlock ran over to the berm, shucked his suit coat, piled gravel into it, wrapped it back up and ran back with it, got up near the tank where he could feel the air being drawn in, and then found that the guard for the air intake was bolted, not screwed, and he had no means of opening it.  He let the gravel pour out on the ground.
He checked to make sure he hadn't lost his knife, and that it hadn't cut its way out of his pocket.  No one had ever asked that before.  How novel.  The demons mostly just attacked him, or occasionally claimed not to be demons.  A few, tiresomely, insisted on recounting their crimes defiantly, but none had straightforwardly asked to be let go.
Sherlock reached out his hand to the window, and felt along until he felt the edge of a pane.  He heaved himself up onto his hands and knees under the weight of his sodden, steam-drenched coat, leaned his head as far down as possible, took a deep breath, stood quickly, and rammed his shoulder into the edge of the window.  He rammed again.  He thought he heard another squeaking crack.  He kept one hand on the frame of the window, so as to tell where he was, and keep the blows against the window from pushing his desk out and away from the window again.
John nodded. He wasn't quite sure why Mycroft was looking at him, but he would've sworn Mycroft looked convinced now, convinced and somewhat upset.
But getting back to the case at hand, if none of the remains were related by DNA, presumably they weren't one nuclear family.  They could have been two couples, though.  It would be fairly difficult to subdue four people at the same time, and there was no gunpowder residue on any of the remains, according to Gutteridge.  No detectable drugs in their systems, but the remains had been floating in water, and weren't especially large anyway.
A man in a blue jersey and a blue baseball cap was hollering something at the cars passing by the bus stop.  A woman seated in one of three seats under the bus shelter yelled at the man to "have some respect".  As the man turned, Sherlock saw that the jersey said "Dodgers" across the front.  A police car passed by and did not stop.
She had a short face, and was blonde with blue eyes.  She tried to walk past him without him noticing, but that just made it more obvious.  She would fit the description of John's sister Harriet, whom Sherlock had seen in photos but still never in person.  He waited till she relaxed enough that he could tell she thought she was safe; then he turned and followed her.
Just after the sidewalk yoga was a church painted purple, with a banner on the front saying something about a goddess rosary.  Soot from the freeway had settled into the folds of the drapery and it couldn't possibly be changed often enough to affect anything he was doing now.  There was an analog letterboard out in front of the church, the kind with black letters that fit into rows, and the key to the glass front easily defeated.  It said "Love Is Love".
After being told twice more, Bobby let go of the stranger's calf and dashed back to John's side, facing the stranger. John said, "I don't know who you are, but this isn't funny. Get out, now."
Sherlock felt a burning as the second-to-last symbol removed itself from the right side of his chest.  He couldn't find the ball and keys; presumably they had burned up.
Next, Sherlock would see if he could repeat the trick with the squash ball.  It had gone over well with the glass man, and maybe it would work here.  Sherlock worked the bump keys into the sides of the squash ball so they would point out whichever way the ball flew.  The problem was getting into the tank with the ball.  He put the ball aside to hold in reserve.
He ran inside one of the cemetery buildings.  This one was one large, empty room.  A large glass wall went all the way up to the ceiling in front of a red stone wall.  The little wall shelves framing the doorway were mostly empty, except for one at eye level which had a pair of plastic action figures.  There was nowhere else to go from that room, so Sherlock immediately ran out again and ducked into another entrance.  This one had a long hallway extending to the right and left, and other doorways visible.  It was still somewhat possible to see by the light passing through all the stained glass in the building, but the shiny marble and occasional glass partition made it difficult to be sure what one was looking at.
The blue glow grew larger, taking up about half Sherlock's field of view, and then he was able to pick out a dark, human-shaped figure in the midst of it.  The man whom he had fought earlier had apparently sat waiting for him to return.  His skin was unmarred by all the gold drool, but his suit was in ruins.
The man got out of Sherlock's reach and turned.  "So maybe only slightly less dumb than I thought?"  He chuckled.  "What are you, then?"
He leapt up, and tried to keep a low center of balance.  He moved much faster without his wet coat weighing him down, but as he moved, he thought he moved faster than he usually did without the coat.  He had  no time to allot to that, though; he had a demon to fight.
Sherlock pulled his gaze away from John, who was standing on the far side of the street. Sherlock hoped this plan of his worked. He was almost certain to survive. It was the only way out of Moriarty's trap, for him and John and all of them.  He looked down at the ground, and tried to move his foot off the ledge.  Some absurd mammalian instinct prevented him from stepping off.  He could do this.  He would do this.  Sherlock gathered himself and leapt off the edge of the roof.
Father Philip led Sherlock down a hallway and past a rather homey-looking room with several chairs and a sofa in it.  There was an elderly Irishman in black trousers reading a newspaper on the sofa.
Sherlock waved through his options.  Probably wouldn't pass as a janitor dressed as he was.  He decided to stroll straight up.  He put on his best New York accent, making sure not to go too nasal.
Sherlock's thoughts whirled.  He must have him 'on the ropes'.  The man in the suit must have thought Sherlock had good odds of detaining the rest of the demons, or he thought that having Sherlock would be worth leaving the rest roaming around free.  Well, Sherlock, for one, was not letting Moriarty come back to the same Earth John still walked, or letting John walk around unshriven for longer than necessary.  He might've agreed unknowingly to such a deal before he died, but now in his 'sure and certain' hope of an afterlife, it needed to be taken into his calculations.
Now the man was really working himself into a lather.  His sentences were becoming very short and disjointed.  As the man turned the tank toward Sherlock, he turned too sharply, and one track rode up onto one of the concrete Jersey barriers in the truck lanes.  The demon began to lurch the tank back and forth to attempt to free it.  Black smoke puffed out of the tank's exhaust in gouts as he switched between forward and reverse.
It turned out it wasn't that hard to get on a plane at the airport with only one shoe.  Apparently they were only concerned about keeping out excess shoes.
Sherlock walked. He walked and he thought. Was there any other option but to behave as though what he was experiencing was real?  Apparently he needed to reassess his conclusions about the likelihood of an afterlife. But apparently Moriarty was still...where he was. Would Sherlock's phone really still work? He found himself near a promising-looking overpass and crawled down into the space where the foundations of the upper road sat on the built-up mounds underneath. It was unoccupied. Sherlock took out his phone. It did appear to work, even though he was in a different country and hadn't charged the device since the evening before he jumped off the roof of Bart's.
Speaking of last meals, when was the last time Sherlock ate?  It seemed late.  He checked his phone, which said 2:13 am.  The only things still open would be near the bars.  A Japanese restaurant, with a sign saying "Open 24 Hours" in white letters on a red awning appeared to fit the bill.  A disheveled man with a woman tucked under his arm stumbled out of the restaurant into Sherlock's path, looking him up and down.  "Why you wearing a coat like that?  You got a tail?"  The girlfriend snickered, and they staggered away.
"What's a soul, really?  Have you ever seen one?  Have you ever seen any evidence it exists?  And I don't see why you couldn't see John.  What would be the problem with that?"
Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks.  He had reached the religious goods store, and there, standing in front of it, facing him, just a few feet down the sidewalk, was the man he had fought in the tugboat.  Demon?  Man?  One of twins?  Clearly not a standard-issue man at any rate.
There was a flyer in the porch of the church advertising "Entheogens, A Practical Course".  Apparently it was advice about various psychedelic substances and how they might cause one to know the "entirety of being".
Sherlock sidestepped around as the tank tracks turned towards him, and shouted, "No one likes you!  Your woman left you and told all the other women never to speak to you again!"
"I have 113 demons I need returned. And just to make things easier on your fallible little mortal memory, I'll write their names down for you."
She smiled slightly, and reached under the counter to pull out a little black box.  "Let me give you these cigars, sir."
He wandered through the building, checking the stairwells and hallways, listening at doors, and reviewing what he knew about the place.  Richard Ramirez had stayed there--a rapist, murderer, and mutilator of the dead.  Called himself The Night Stalker, currently at San Quentin.  A member of the jury for his murder trial died, but turned out to have been murdered by her boyfriend.
Sherlock had of course, tested various substances on himself in his younger days.  Some of the ones that grew outdoors in warmer weather, he found much easier to acquire in Florida, when he had been there in 1998.
Sherlock strolled along the wide white floors of the airport.  He had no luggage, so he had nothing to slow him down, or require him to lean over sideways and break his stride.  As he got out of the gate area into the main, mall-like part, he strolled up to a currency exchange.  The clerk tried to talk him into just taking money out of the ATM rather than spending such a large amount on changing the money, but he found the appropriately cutting remark to goad her into agreeing.  The exchange fee was 61 Canadian dollars, and he ended up with $256 Canadian.  It wouldn't go far, but it was more useful than pounds, anyway.
The bell on the door jingled as he came in and queued up behind the oddly-dressed man.  As the man pulled out his wallet to pay for his baked goods, Sherlock looked over his shoulder at the clear panel of his wallet that had his driver's license behind it.  Apparently the man was named Peter Christopher Gutteridge, but the clear panel was yellowed and cracked directly over the birthdate.  As the man stepped out of the way to deal with his change and receipt, Sherlock said to the woman behind the counter, "I'll have what he's having."
He looked through some of the London news websites. He did find his suicide in a couple of places, but no mention of Moriarty or John. That was somewhat worrying. If Moriarty was dead and not mentioned, it didn't follow that John was still alive. Oh, John, what happened to you? Sherlock curled up with his face away from the traffic on the underpass and looked at the wall. He slept and dreamed of John pummeling him outside Irene Adler's house.
Even though the unlit office was now much darker, only lit by the sodium lights outside, the molten gold was much easier to see in the dark.  It spread across the floor, still glowing from the heat within.  The sprinklers were the sort that are always full of water, not the air-filled ones.  But all the heat detecting capsules had been blown, so the smoke didn't set off the sprinklers again.
"Ah, coffee like that might almost make you feel alive again."  The man in the suit said, as he appeared beside him.  Sherlock set the coffee cup down on top of a newspaper vending machine, although it wasn't really so much a vending machine as a dispensing-for-free machine, and there were few who would call the contents of the tabloids within 'news'.
Sherlock looked at where the current maps went according to the website of Curtis Ebbesmeyer, the famous oceanographer.  He would look upstream from that.  It had rained recently, being Vancouver, and the remains might well have washed down from a river or creek.  Sherlock wanted to get out away from the city to see if he could find anything likely, and Gutteridge even let Sherlock borrow his car, which was far beyond Sherlock's expectations.  That was one lonely man.
Apparently he found it necessary to lean in very close to Sherlock while he talked, but Sherlock wasn't disturbed by the tactic.  Many people had tried to intimidate him by crowding him.
Sherlock leaned back behind his corner, and thought how he might get at the glass man without having his eye put out, or possibly even more difficult, figure out which part of the glass man was the eye.  If Sherlock had been a stained glass man, he would've covered himself with fake eyespots like orcas, so that someone going for his eyes would be misled.
Sherlock turned his head to follow a jogger with clearly uneven leg length, and when he turned back, that man in the suit was sitting on the park bench next to him.
Sherlock pointed at the remains.  "You can see here, on the inferior aspect of the buccal surface where the toothbrush hits.  She brushed her teeth so often, it made a thick spot.  And look at the angle, she's right-handed.  But you can see here, on the outside of the face where she always missed her sunscreen, and sunlight comes in on a left-hand drive car."
When Sherlock woke in the morning, he found that his coat and shirt collar were whole again, and his money clip was back in his pocket.
Then they circled the table, Sherlock walking backwards, until Sherlock stepped on the staple remover piece.  He pulled his foot up quickly and involuntarily looked down.  Mackler tackled him, landing on top of his legs, and then Sherlock swung at his eyes with the other staple remover half, and Mackler grabbed his arm, in an iron grip.  Sherlock twisted and pushed in every combination he knew, but he couldn't get free.  Sherlock reached into his coat pocket, hoping some solution would present itself.  He found the gold drop there.  He wondered if it would have any effect at all, having its origin in Mackler himself, but here went nothing.
Sherlock walked down the sidewalk past an extremely fashionable cafe. Observing two women eyeing him over the tops of their designer sunglasses, he put on a carefully calibrated strut and walked up to the decorative iron fence surrounding the cafe's outdoor seating area. "Well, hello there," he said as he leaned, smiling, against the curlicued fence. “What have I seen you in recently?”
This time he went too far again in jumping, and knocked into the brick warehouse on the dock.  He broke some of the brick facing, too, which was odd.  He looked a little more closely, and it wasn't facing at all; it was full-sized bricks that had cracked from the impact.  Acid rain?  How peculiar.
A little ways away in a plaza, a man stood on top of a five-gallon bucket holding a sign in front of his chest.  The writing was rather small for a sign, and was printed with permanent marker.  The sign claimed that the Dalai Lama and the Pope were the same person, and that same person was the Devil.  Seemed unlikely, Sherlock thought, although he had certainly never seen the Dalai Lama or the Pope.  People streamed past, unconcerned, to and from the coffee stand.
She spit at the weird black grass, from much further away than most people could.  If this didn't tie the cherry pit spitting record of 28.51 metres, it came close.  One bunch of grass turned brown and dry and shriveled completely and almost immediately, and the bunches either side of it were partially shriveled.
He whetted the money clip and waited, and soon enough, out from behind the building came a military tank.  The tank was painted tan all over, wearing its colours from the early 1990's.  The gun barrel was not split like the museum examples he had inspected.  The tank appeared to be in battle-ready condition, very clean, with a solid coat of paint, except that it had some damage to the hatch at the front, where it must have been opened with a crowbar or some similar object, a catspaw more likely.  If there were no keys required to start the tank, that suggested that the rounds of ammunition were also safely locked up and had not been loaded into the tank.  Sherlock, however, could not discount the probability that someone somewhere had been careless and left the rounds unlocked or in the tank, or that some sort of uncanny ammunition was available.
He was unimpressed by most.  They provided no quieting of the mind.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  One of his associates who had taken LSD had then proceeded to lock himself in the bathroom at the bar where the man's wife worked, a bathroom mirrored floor to ceiling on all four walls, and then go through a calisthenics routine, shouting that he himself would make an army entirely out of himself and take over the world for her.
Just a quiet brushing sound, like leaves in the wind almost, but the trees were barely moving.  He saw a glint of reflected sodium light on the ground and then lost it again.  He quietly shifted himself closer to where he had seen the shine, and saw other glints down in the grass of the cemetery lawn.  There were quite a few of them, and he wondered whether there wasn't a burst sprinkler pipe in the lawn, but there was no sound of water.
Sherlock arrived at the appropriate transportation centre at the appropriate time.  Deducing the passengers who boarded the bus took him only a moment.  Although marginally more interesting than aeroplane passengers, there was little to recommend them.  The bus didn't take anything like a straight line route; it meandered back and forth across the highway, stopping at little shops that only sold hot coffee, souvenirs, and extremely stale crisps.
The man looked directly at him as he slid into the booth across from Sherlock.  He leaned across the aisle to the next table and knocked the soy sauce over onto the cash tip that had been left.
He set his phone down and looked at his arms again.  He only had 14 of the sigils on his skin left--13 on his chest, and one on his left arm.  He could leave his sleeves rolled up now without looking like the most vapid sort of criminal.  It made sense, though, that as more demons were caught, they had a much larger average distance between them and would be harder to find.
She stood still as he got his knife out and tried to calculate the best and quickest angle.  She blinked uncontrollably as he leaned in towards her, but she never moved her head.
It was an ostentatious display, the sort meant to discourage a fight, and it could've easily been used suddenly upon Sherlock, and not given him any chance to avoid it.  It was elegant, in its way.  There was no ostentation for ostentation's sake, only the barest minimum of force necessary to be effective.
Soon enough, Sherlock was back at the airport, with Rosemary...?  Anyway, it was about time to exchange his stash of pounds again.  There was a new clerk at the currency exchange counter, who gave Sherlock and Rachel or whatever her name was, a very strange look.  She smiled anyway, as politely as she could, exchanged the pounds for dollars correctly, and then asked, "Can I help you and your...wife?... with anything else?"
The man in the suit said to him, "I'm glad you could spare me a moment.  I wanted to talk to you about  buying out the rest of your contract.  The price is negotiable, and you wouldn't have to round up those last few, pesky demons."
"I'm not doing this because I feel bad about throwing water on you.  If I would've felt bad about it, I wouldn't have done it.  What's a good cheer?"  She held the can in front of her and looked at it for a moment.  "Here's to us.  Who's like us?  Damn few, and they're dead."  She raised the can in the air, and took a large swig.
"She left me!  This is her fault.  She swore she would stay with me forever!  How many times has a woman broken your heart, and they do it on purpose!  You buy them a drink and they won't take it..."
"Oh, really?  Which one's that?  The Patripassians?  The Ophites?  The Triclavians?  For all you know, I invented every one of those religions right now.  Better look into it."
"John! Call off your dog!" said the man as he wobbled and stomped around the kitchen, trying to shake off the dog.
Sherlock was having a great deal of difficulting extricating his legs from the car.  It seemed that one foot had gone into the floor of the car, and the other was sticking out touching the pavement, as he felt around with it.  That might be helpful.  He pushed with his toe against the asphalt as the car groaned.  He got that foot up into the car, pushed up, pushed up again.  His knee now free, he twisted his hips so that his leg bent at the knee, his other leg turned in its hole, and he grabbed the hand holes he had made, and tried to draw his knee up to his chest, so he could get his foot out of the roof.
He had been walking for about six hours and not seen anything especially interesting, no more than the usual percentage of murders and thieves, when he saw a woman that caught his attention.
"I hope to be forgiven."  She turned, slowly, and held out her hands, palms out, towards him.  "Please, give me time to repent."  She was producing actual tears, but that didn't mean a great deal.  Sherlock himself could cry on command, and he knew others who could, as well.  He had been unswayed by Irene Adler's tears, and he would be unswayed by those of this woman.
Sherlock scanned the room, turning quietly, but it was immediately obvious that there was a localised blue glow back in the direction he had originally been travelling.  He approached it, looking for good weapons lying on desks as he passed them.  The best he could find quickly was a staple remover.
The last time John saw Sherlock, he had been lying on the sidewalk in front of St Bart's hospital, his eyes open and unblinking, and blood running across his face.  John had checked Sherlock's pulse with his own hand, and found nothing.  And then Sherlock had been wheeled into the Emergency Department, and then he had been wheeled to the morgue.  Molly Hooper herself had done Sherlock's autopsy, and Mycroft Holmes had identified his body.  Mycroft had decided on a closed-casket funeral; no one ever looked right at their funeral, anyway.  They never held their mouths right.
"Would you hold this money for me?  I can't keep it in my pockets overnight.  I'll split it with you 50/50."  This was appalling.  How did he even talk to people when he wasn't high?
The man stood up, abandoning his popcorn, and walked along next to Sherlock.  They crossed the street, and at the middle of the block was the entrance to the cemetery.  The cemetery architecture looked about a hundred years old--lawns, a small building that sold flowers by the gate.  Like most of the new cemeteries in California, it was accessible by car, and didn't have the old-fashioned enclosing metal gates of London.
The woman just looked at him.  50/50 was the ideal amount, verified experimentally by Guth et al's ultimatum game.
That would probably be a bad thing to get in one's eyes, especially seeing how it had ended for all the other demons Sherlock had run into.  He squeezed his eyes shut, and did his best to peel the glass pieces loose from his skin.
Sherlock looked down again and saw that the blue glow had dissipated.  He took a breath.  "Any other places you've heard about that might have demons?"
He tried to google the tank schematics, but he was in the middle of nowhere and had no reception.  This large, arid, unpopulated American state was atrocious.
Many of the piers weren't exactly swarming with other people, but when Sherlock finally reached what appeared to be the number four pier, it looked entirely deserted.
Sherlock could see quite a few layers of cotton clothing sticking out of the woman's collar, along with a hemp necklace.  Clearly the ecologist type of vegan.  He halfway paid attention as she went on.
The woman was glowing a bright gray with every word she spoke.  Apparently the gray aura was caused by thinking something was true rather than by it being true.  He himself glowed blue for most of the conversations he had these days, with all the lies he told.
"It's 'to whom I could drive you.'  And I don't have any relatives.  And if you can't tell me anything about demons, I've got better things to do."
John still had no idea who this mentally unbalanced man was, but he didn't need him committing suicide in John's front room. John started talking in a calming monotone. "It's all right. You don't need to do that. Just set the knife down for a moment and we can talk about it. It'll be fine. Don't worry. Everything will be better soon. There's nothing to worry-"
John heard steps crossing the kitchen and saw a shadow loom over him. A flashlight shined into his eyes as the other man crouched down, and then withdrew quickly with a scream just as Bobby started growling. John twisted around and half sat up and saw that that Bobby had bitten down onto this Sherlock-impostor's ankle and had locked his jaws.
