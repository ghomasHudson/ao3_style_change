“Hey Sherlock,” John says out loud, surprising himself. He clears his throat and continues. “I always knew your bed was soft, but I didn’t realize just how much of a posh arsehole you were until now.”
“John,” Sherlock sputters.  His body won’t obey his mind, the transport is betraying him as it always does.
So Sherlock looks for an excuse.  He texts Lestrade, saying he’ll take any cases outside of the city, preferably in the middle of nowhere.  The last time they took a case way out of the city was just before Sherlock had to go away, the case with the fake hound and Baskerville.  During that case was possibly when they had been the closest, when Sherlock had thought that maybe something more than friendship could have happened between them.  But that’s over now.  He just needs to get John out of London.
“Hello,” Sherlock says, and continues furiously writing, his tongue on the side of his mouth in concentration.
John leaves the bathroom and walks into Sherlock’s bedroom, rummages around and comes back with one of his soft sleeping shirts.  Sherlock keeps his hands on his ice and John begins to undo Sherlock’s cuffs and then the buttons down the front of his shirt.
“Don’t be stupid, it’s fine, I just need to stitch it up,” Sherlock says.  He knows he’s being silly but during his time away he’d dealt with much worse, and the idea of going to a very noisy and bright hospital sounds dreadful.
Besides, the note is clearly for John specifically. It’s something that shows it’s just for the two of them. Their secret. John smiles at the thought, but it fades quickly as John continues to inspect the thin paper. He clears his throat and then puts the note down next to the cold tea. He rubs his eyes, feeling tired.
“Well, I work exclusively with dead people so I think my hat should be thrown in the ring,” Molly said, taking a sip of her wine.
After the film, John found himself across from Sherlock eating pasta at a place called Angelo’s. Sherlock knew the owner, and Angelo himself had placed a candle between the two of them, saying that everything was on the house.
John waits outside of Sherlock’s operating room.  He shuts himself down.  He doesn’t let himself imagine the worst.  He doesn’t let himself imagine relief.
“You went right back to drugs after my wedding,” John had commented one night.  Sherlock hadn’t replied, only kissed him to answer his question.
“I know so much of you, and yet sometimes I can’t tell what you’re like.  I know that you’re harsh, and quick, and fantastic.  I know you’re very kind when you want to be.  I know you can be sometimes incredibly cruel.  I also know that you feel everything very much.”
“Will you pardon me, for just one moment?” John asked Sherlock. Sherlock raised his eyebrows and shrugged as John turned away.
Harry has all but forced him to come over for dinner.  She knows the signs: she’s lived it.  She’s made a roast and the last time John has eaten something homemade and hot was months ago.  She’s also brought out a bottle of red wine and John doesn’t have the energy to stop her.  He certainly doesn’t have the energy to stop himself.  He accepts the food and the wine alike.  It isn’t as if he wouldn’t go home and drink all by himself anyway.  At least drinking with others was acceptable—albeit it being with one’s alcoholic sister.
The man is small and about three years older than Sherlock, but he looks older than he is because of how sad he is.  Sherlock sees the tan line as the man stretches his hand out to give Sherlock his phone.  War veteran, doctor war veteran.  He wonders what his mother would say.
He did kiss Evan, once. It was shockingly different than kissing a girl, alarmingly so. The face shape all different, the body underneath his so much sturdier. They didn’t do anything else though. Evan just said it was okay because John never had. Now you have, there you go.
“Mike, could I borrow your phone?”  A new voice asks.  John looks up and sees the source, a man looking into a microscope.
Sherlock is kissing him, and it has happened so quickly that John doesn’t even get a chance to react before Sherlock pulls away, looking frightened.
“I should not have done that. What am I doing with you?” Sherlock asked, beaming at John as if he were the sun.
John takes a separate flannel and runs it under warm water, then gently dabs at the caked blood on Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock would like to turn John into an element on the periodic table.  He knows John would be an Alkaline Earth Metal, but he can’t decide between Beryllium or Calcium.  If John were an element, he’d know what to do with him, at least.
John closes the tab and then takes Sherlock by the hand, and drags him out of the pub.  His hand is warm and solid and delightful.  Sherlock doesn’t even mind that he’s being dragged around.
Once, he gets stuck waiting for the tube. It’s just so crowded, and he thinks he sees his pale, gangly limbs between a woman with blonde hair and a man talking on the phone. John moves to follow the slender figure but loses sight almost immediately. He curses, and heads back to the station and just barely misses the train. He curses again. Thinks harder. John knows it wasn’t him, couldn’t have been. He just wants it to be him so badly. What would he even do if it were really him?
John sighed as he placed two pieces of bread into the toaster. He turned and leaned back against the kitchen counter, folding his arms across his chest.
He finds himself wandering the streets of London at 3 am.  It isn’t the first time, and he’s sure it won’t be the last.  His head hurts a bit from the wine he drank earlier (he hasn’t been drinking much lately, for obvious reasons) and he’s so tired but his mind is racing.
“Both.  Always,” Sherlock says, then sighs.  His eyes flutter shut.  “I’m tired, John,” Sherlock says.
“Fake Girlfriend?” John asked, utterly confused. Sherlock was gay, anyone with eyes could see as much.
“Yes. He was sitting perched and smirking when the police found him. He had just stolen the crown jewels, but he didn’t make a getaway. He knew what he was doing.”
Sherlock looked at the floor and would not meet John’s gaze. Instead, he turned his coat collar up and walked out the front door and out of John’s life.
John orders a beer and half of it is gone quickly somehow, Mary’s drink refilled, and they’re laughing about one of the night nurses which may not be very kind but John has never been very kind and it is genuinely funny.
People were yelling, raising their hands, trying to get the attention of Sherlock. Sherlock had a mediator who was answering most of the questions. Sherlock meanwhile seemed to be nodding in agreement with everything he said. Hands reached to the sky, and the mediator pointed towards the middle of the room.
When the plane takes off, Sherlock gives himself a full minute to fully sob.  He presses his palms into his eyelids and thinks of a quick death by firing squad.
It happened on a Tuesday when John was eleven. Susie Chapman’s delicate little hands shoved him hard onto the ground and, as John went toppling backwards, he pulled Susie down with him. His hands were on her elbows, and she was lying against his chest, angry and grinding her teeth.
John left the shop that evening feeling rather odd. Something felt off, like he had unfinished business. On the way home he decided to stop for cup of tea and a cheese danish at the coffee shop across the street from his flat. He didn’t like to spend the extra money too often, the army pension only offering him so much, but figured he deserved it today. He had survived meeting someone who was essentially at movie star status without making a complete arse of himself.
John would have thought Sherlock to have thought the same though: Janine being a bit much.  She was bubbly and giggly and Sherlock was anything but.
“Because you want me to be here.  And…and I said I’d never let anyone hurt you and you are hurting you, so I’m stopping it.”
He goes downstairs and looks at Sherlock, tries to memorize everything about him.  This will be the last time Sherlock Doesn’t Know.
“Hi. Hi it’s. Um. It’s John. John Watson. I own the…bookshop?” It seemed that John had suddenly forgotten how to speak.
“Then what’s been going on?  You can go back to Ella you know.  Or you could talk to me.  I know we haven’t normally done that but.  Well.”
“Absolutely not.  There’s no use arguing.  Those things are absolutely wretched for you.  I need you around you know,” John says, then heads into the bathroom.
About three minutes passed, and that’s when he heard Harry’s shouting. She was crying, screaming, incoherent. Just outside his bedroom door John had heard the most pleading voice, it didn’t seem to be real.
“The gardener did it,” Sherlock said simply with a nod. John raised his eyebrows and his mouth fell open. He blinked a few times then shook his head.
John stirred pasta noodles while Greg put a salad together. John didn’t love the idea of leaving Sherlock alone with his sister, but he also thought he might scream at Harry if he had to listen to her interrogate Sherlock within an inch of his life.
John is positively exhausted after he knows.  They’ve been standing in the same spot, staring at each other in disbelief, kissing in between breathes.  The afternoon is glowing, and John isn’t sure what he looks like anymore, all he knows is that his entire body is tingling, and he just keeps smiling, staring up at the love of his life.
“I mean, when all is said and done he’s nothing special,” Harry said. “I almost witnessed him take his trousers down and it didn’t look like anything extraordinary was happening down there.”
Mrs. Hudson had ended up walking John down the aisle. Though they had argued back and forth about who would be waiting at the aisle, it had all boiled down to Mrs. Hudson. Both of John’s parents were deceased, and both of Sherlock’s parents were very much alive. Sherlock had insisted that Mrs. Hudson play a large role in the ceremony. After all, the woman owned properties all over London and was giving them an enormous discount on 221 B Baker Street.
It’s late on a Saturday night.  There are cups of tea and leftover Chinese food between them.  They are watching Bond movies, and have been for hours.  Their knees are brushing again, and this night feels precious, as if it is precariously balanced in the universe.  It probably is.
John doesn’t reply but he wonders if it even matters who Mary is.  If it would make it better.  If he could forgive her.
Sherlock gets up immediately before he is caught.  He goes to bed and tries not to think about how helpless he feels.
“I’m in love with you Sherlock.  I’m sad because I’m in love with you and you will never feel that way about me.  I’ve been in love with you since the night at the pool and I won’t ever be able to not be in love with you.  That’s why I can’t look you in the eye.  I don’t believe that you didn’t know that.  Did you really just want me to say it?”
John almost forgot about it really; he got caught up with things easily.  Being a third year med student graduating in another semester, it could be hard to keep up.  So when he was told he had a phone call he didn’t think much of it.
“I’m not going anywhere.” Sherlock curls an arm around John’s waist under the silk sheets. “I’ll probably never go anywhere ever again. I’ll handcuff myself to you.”
John has to laugh.  He puts his head in his hands for a small moment, then looks up at Sherlock again, who is avoiding his gaze.
“Interesting. I do, I do. It’s like that time I was trying to tell Greg that the killer was absolutely connected to that alien abduction in Doncaster. But of course he wouldn’t listen. Like it’s all right there in front of you, but nobody will listen!”
“No, my bodyguard here is just a bit sensitive. See, unlike me, he has a temper. But really, go on and say what you really think about me.”
John has been licking his lips so much that they’re chapped and hurt but it doesn’t matter.  He feels brave tonight.
“No, there’s bound to be a bit of bruising though.  Take that ice off so we can clean you up a bit.”
"Indeed. I was one of those. I  rejected a match with a man twice my age when I had barely left the school gates, and it was only the actions of my dear aunt who left me the funds to make my own life that secured my future. I am worse than dead to my family, and have been so these past twenty  years as a result." She stared at the gate which was now closed tight for  the evening. "The College is  my family now, and I must protect it."
"You have quite the defensive style, Mrs HOltz. One might even deduce a certain familiarity with weapons."
He focused on the unending streets of houses as they rumbled through the outer reaches of London, and it took him several minutes before he felt sufficiently brave to look directly at Holmes once more. “It remains a matter of extreme delicacy which I was loath to discuss, even in the presence of Dr Watson.”
Watson applied himself to the task, falling through the past pages of the evening news, taking note of the dealings of the magistrates courts. And his precise location remained unclear. He lunched alone at Fitzbillies, conscious of the time it took and keeping an eye open for Holmes's return.
"No need." Holmes looked towards the door, where a wan-faced young woman stood, her face filled with equal amounts of fear, joy and confusion.
The visit to the Fossets was postponed for the immediate time. They left the church just as they had entered it. Holmes kept a wary eye focused on the vicarage, and was assured that the departure had gone unnoticed.
The following days kept Holmes and Watson in Cambridge as they built the case against the arrested men. The University chose to take a discreet but devastating hand in their fates,recommending that they be sent down shortly after Holmes presented his further evidence at an extraordinary meeting of the  Senate.
Watson returned the look. "I am not a calm sleeper, and you are not in a fit state to be jostled by my parasomnia."
She smiled. “Such as it is between those with whom we live...There will be time, Doctor, for you to rest, such as might be required, after lunch, as our students are at lectures, attending supervisions or engaged in private study. We have  rooms set aside for visiting fellows which i hope you will find to your liking…”
“When I took holy orders, Amelia left the family home and took up a role as my housekeeper and assistant as I moved between parishes until I was offered the living at Whetstone eighteen months ago. We settled into parish life quickly, and once again found ourselves amongst good people.
The edge of Watson’s smile frayed slightly. “Mr Holmes is currently away from Baker Street, although he is expected to return in the next day or so. Would it be possible for me to contact you once he is able to consider your case?”
He was duly returning from Mr Merrick’s shop on the corner when he fancied he felt himself under close observation. He glanced back,and at first saw nothing unusual. Then, there it was. A black-clad figure in the farthest corner of his vision, head bowed and intent on reaching him. Watson cursed the stupidity of leaving his gun locked in his desk. Damn and blast.
“Excellent. May I  introduce Dr Iris McLelland, Warden of Radegund College, Cambridge. Dr McLelland, this is Dr John Watson, who shares your profession.”
"Justice is not always best served by the courts, Mrs Holtz, but in this case, Dr Watson and I will not cease until these culprits face the  consequences of their deeds."
“On my way up…” He kept the usual ‘dear heart’ silent for fear of disclosure.  He listened closely as he ascended the stairs, but found that he could only hear a fraction of the ongoing conversation.
They remained in absolute silence for several minutes, their eyes trained on the space under the window. At first there was nothing, then the faintest barrage of metal against stone. Watson strained his eyes and could just make out the furtive movements of a figure intent on chipping away at the damaged memorial plaque.
“She fainted, and had to be taken from her room, from where she has barely stirred since. Her room is adjacent to mine, and I took the precaution of leaving my door ajar in case she had need of me in the night.”
Holmes sighed. "Mycroft Holmes. My older brother. A man  of significant if  shadowy influences. I may have called in a few favours in order for him to put  pressure upon the senior members of the University. It would not do if the reputation of  such a historic University was tarnished by ugly rumours of violence and intimidation amongst its own students. We were raised for the most part by a mother who might have flourished in an establishment such as Radegund. Coming to the assistance of the college is a joint act of defiance committed in her memory."
Holmes nodded. “We have been companions for most of the past decade, through fair times and foul, and I am confident that this will continue for the rest of our lives.”
“One of our benefactresses kindly left her house and gardens in order to provide us with a physical establishment. That , along with donations from private individuals and support from more open-minded institutions, has enabled us to grow. We have even been able to offer three scholarships in the past year, thanks in no small part to our supporters. The College is not without allies, even if some of them do not feel able to openly declare  themselves as such.”
Fosset grinned back. “Sherlock…” They stood and held each other at arm’s length, eyes locked. Watson felt suddenly awkward at what was a significant and unexpected reunion. They remained oblivious to his presence for several moments as each drank in the other’s features. It wasn’t jealousy that he felt as such, but Watson’s sense of unease grew as a single thought swept all others aside- what made you think that you were the first to be charmed by him? A curl of misery grew and began to unfurl in his gut.
“I am perfectly fine,” he hissed to Watson upon waking on the eighth day of his medical incarceration. “I have answered all the questions that have been asked of me and have kept what passes for breakfast here within my system despite its revolting texture. My wound continues to heal to the satisfaction of Stamford and his medical acolytes.” He levered himself closer to Watson, who found that his greatest friend had somehow transformed from the saviour of London to the persona of an overgrown and bored child.
Fosset looked directly at him. “I did not seek you out to reclaim my stake in your affections,” he replied softly and without regret. “Time moves and changes all who survive its ructions. I would never wish to disrupt the friendship of two connected souls such as you and Dr Watson.”
"Martha Hudson has eyes and ears, but she is ruled by her heart. I doubt the suggestion that we might innocently share a bed would startle her into moral panic. Come on, you great fool. Lie down in the warm. There are two locked doors between us and the outside world, and what should you fear? Surely not me?"
Watson shook her hand, noting the confidence of her grip. “Pleased to meet you, Dr McLelland. I have heard many good things about your institution.”
He strode up to the porch and tapped at the door which swung open at his touch. "Morning. May we come in?"
"Not as much as you, I would suggest, but enough. The Evening Chronicle is very thorough in reporting the fates of petty miscreants. What about you?" Holmes patted his breast pocket. I,too, have acquired a list. I would wager that some names will appear on both…"
She paused outside a large house set back from the road by a carriage drive and a bank of trees. “Please follow me..”
“Good to meet you Doctor, thank you for your  welcome. Please do not hesitate  to contact me if I can be of any assistance just students considering medicine."
“All in good time, Watson. Our immediate concern is the welfare of our guest. All the answers that you require will be revealed in the near future. Now be a good soul and ask Mrs Hudson for another portion of her excellent soup. I doubt that our guest has eaten properly in some time. ”
"Precisely." Holmes swung himself up on his feet. His lips branded Watson’s forehead with a hot, soft kiss. ”And this is why I would not be without you.”
“Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds,” he replied. “You were not in any position to go against your stepfather’s dictats, especially when the welfare of your mother and sister were at stake. Losing your companionship was my first experience of grief, lessened by the fact that I knew you lived on elsewhere. I never stopped hoping that we would meet again when we had greater agency over our lives.” He leant forward until he was almost within reach of Fosset’s hands. “But we live in an era of increased suspicion, where certain feelings must be concealed in order to protect them.”
"Entirely." Students spilled out of the  lecture halls in a tangle, filling the streets as they streamed back into the town."For whom are we looking?" whispered Watson.
Watson did his best to show interest, contributing when appropriate, but it became apparent to Holmes in particular that the weight of a  busy night without rest was wearing  him thin, however much he  protested  otherwise.
"Precisely," murmured Watson, now almost drunk with fatigue. He felt the gently insistent pressure of Holmes's hand on his elbow. "Please do not let us keep you from your studies…"
Lovellan looked him squarely in the eye. "Because it was the physical embodiment of a lie," he replied. "I borrowed the hammer and chisel from the vestry, and attacked the plaque by night, sleeping wherever I could find shelter." He turned to Miss Fosset. "I did not wish you to see me in this state, and yet I couldn't leave without seeing you again, even though I knew there was nothing I could offer you. My funds, such as they were, were tangled in bureaucracy, and alone I lacked both the means and the influence to access them."
"Yes, sir." He drank from his cup, then swallowed the tablets that were offered to him before being guided to the back room and assisted into the bed. The comfort of fresh, clean sheets and a soft mattress claimed before he could object.
"Just coming in now. Mrs Holtz. A recent recruit to our number. Her late husband was a vicar in Surrey, I believe, although –" Dr McLelland paused.
They found him in the kitchen, washing his hands under the sink. Holmes approached and laid a hand on his arm. "Victor," he said quietly. "We have solved your mystery, and have someone with whom you need to speak. Dry your hands and turn around."
“It was then that Amelia met and grew close to Dr Lovellan, a young doctor keen to make his mark on the profession. He was a kind, calm and human soul, very similar in some ways to our stepfather, and he seemed to make her very happy.” He smiled at the memory. “Indeed, when he approached me for permission to ask for her hand, I was delighted. An announcement was made and the banns were read, in preparation for a late spring wedding. And then...” His face greyed.
Holmes’ eyes widened at the implication of his words, but he nodded in agreement. “There are some secrets which are not shared between siblings, no matter the strength of their bond.“ His hand touched Fosset’s. “If that is the case, she is battling more than grief. She is living in fear of your reaction, especially now that the one with whom she had planned to share her life and its developments cannot protect her.”
Mrs Holst straightened up and brushed the dirt from her dress. She left her victim to  come back to himself under brusque care of Doctor Watson. She turned to address the students who were beginning to reclaim their machines. "Return to College, please, and be prepared to offer the police every assistance in their enquiries." There was a chorus of “Yes ma'am,” before the students cycled down towards the welcoming lights of the College. She was about to follow them when Holmes approached.
“Good morning Reverend,” he said, striding across to meet him, hand outstretched. Fosset seemed startled at the approach. A jolt of recognition passed between them. Holmes’ face lit up with an oddly placed smile.
“I am not a good man.” His head was bowed and his speech slurred. “They lied about me and I did not stop them.”
Watson nodded sharply as acknowledgement. “Such a thing is not unheard of,“ he replied, although clearly wanting a more detailed explanation. He took out this notebook.
Holmes cracked open an eye as the first slices of light crept under the blind in his room. There was a vague memory of being guided to the bed and shuffled under the blankets several hours ago, but nothing more. He reached out over the edge of the mattress and tugged sharply at Watson’s sleeve. He jerked awake with some alarm before realising that the only danger lay in the glinting eyes of his companion.
"Indeed I do." He picked up his coat. May we take a walk? I will prefer that we are able to talk undisturbed…cast an eye on the  closed inner door. "What about… ?"
“Ah,” he responded. “Do you have any idea who might wish to obliterate Dr Lovellan’s memory? He seems to have been a much respected member of the community by all the evidence that you have presented.“
St.Botolph's clock chimed the hour. A determined glint sparked in Holmes's eyes. "Ready for a  chase?"
The man sagged onto the chaise as though his strings had been cut. Whatever courage had been summoned since he arrived at Baker Street melted into the air. Watson watched him with no little compassion and took the opposite seat. “Please remember that you are amongst allies here, and that anything you say within these walls remains here unless you explicitly state otherwise. Let me see how I can help you. Shall we start with your leg?”
“I attempted to provide whatever comfort and solace would be accepted, but nothing could shift her from her grief. She barely spoke, or ate, drinking only water. I continued to stay as close as my parish duties allowed. And, then, on Sunday night, I was in my study when I heard a dreadful scream and a thudding coming from her sitting room. Naturally, I ran up the stairs, dreading what I might find.”
A visible sense of relief swept over Dr McLelland. She refilled her cup and scanned the headlines whilst the sound of bustle and reorganisation filtered from nearby rooms.  If she noted that both men seemed to be packing their cases in the same room, she refused to acknowledge it.
Holmes rewrapped the fragments of stone and set it aside. he placed a conciliatory hand on Fosset's arm, who looked up at the touch. His eyes grew soft. “I am glad you found the courage to find me again, after all these years.”
Fosset shrugged. “Indeed, I am somewhat at a loss to understand the reasoning behind such an unthinking and callous act.”
“That’s very kind of you, Doctor... I wish that the leaders of the University thought the same, but this is why I have travelled up to London at this early hour, to ask for urgent assistance, on a  matter of the utmost delicacy.”
“Chaperones have been followed by mysterious individuals. Miss Brayfield, who lives in Cherry Hinton, came home to find the remains of three blackbirds, their necks wrenched, laid in a line across her doormat. And then last night, Miss Cosgrove, was confronted by two individuals on bicycles who took advantage of the fog to block her path as she crossed Magdalene Bridge, and threatened to dunk her in the  Cam, ‘to see if a witch could float.’ The approach of a constable on his beat stopped them in their tracks, and they were gone before anything could be made of it. Miss Cosgrove was more angered than frightened, but the continued safety and welfare of those in my care cannot be allowed to be threatened in this way.”
It was a silent, watchful journey for all concerned. Watson kept a close eye on both of his companions, who each their own way had spent a restful night. They had both consumed suitably fortifying breakfast of toast and tea. Their guest then allowed Holmes to carefully and efficiently remove his beard with his cutthroat razor, much in the demeanour of one mutely preparing for sacrifice.
“My former university has a great deal of  which to be ashamed,” replied Holmes. “The ancient seats of learning in this country are not as they should be.  But pray continue, Dr McLelland.”
"True,"admitted Holmes. "But neither of us are corruptible young men rebelling against the bigotry of their elders." He sat up, grasped hold of Watson’s arm and yanked him into the bed.
"Edmund?" she whispered, before crumpling suddenly. Watson darted back and caught her before her head connected with the floor. He felt for her pulse and found it comfortingly regular. "Just shock," he announced to the room. "All will be well in a while." He eased her into a sitting position. "Holmes, if you could assist me?"
She nodded. “Our students are permitted to attend lectures, providing the academic in charge is content with their presence and that they are chaperoned at all times. These chaperones are local women of impeccable character, mostly retired from the teaching profession.  Currently we have five, who accompany our students to and from lectures, as per the strictures laid  down the  University,  And whilst our students cannot officially sit the examinations required for their degree, they have been given the right to receive a certificate of attendance in lieu of  the formal qualification that their male counterparts have always had the right to receive.  Our students are held to a far higher standard of public behaviour, as indeed are our staff.  Our chaperones in particular have been coming under attack, as they tend to live  some distance away from the College. They are a hardy group, determined that this generation of students gain the type of advantages which were denied to them.  But recently there have been several incidents where the behaviour of those who are against our very existence has become increasingly threatening, and I fear that genuine and lasting harm will soon happen with significant intervention.”
Holmes kissed him again, this time between his brows. “Hmm. Curious. Send a telegram to invite him here tomorrow morning. I believe I would like to hear what your mysterious Reverend has to say.”
Watson closed his eyes and pictured his rescuer. “Perhaps five or seven years my junior. Between our heights, although closer to favouring yours. Fox-brown hair, with light-toned and changeable eyes.”
The bullies tried repeatedly to escape, only to be pushed back into the circle to face another onslaught. One spotted a space in the circle and made an attempt to run only to find himself on the wrong side of Mrs Hulse's umbrella.
“I am most sorry for every scrap of worry and grief I have caused you,” he mumbled. “how did I come to deserve you?”
Holmes angled his head until he could respond in a similar fashion, “My apologies. I did not expect that you would have been so affected.”
They reached Cambridge in the late morning.  The streets were slick with recent puddles, and then there was a significant queue for hansoms.
“As you wish,” came the enigmatic reply from a man wishing to believe what he had been told, but not entirely trusting to hope it was the truth.
Holmes grinned. “ As ever, your complimentary recognition of my talents nourishes me.” He flicked through the relevant pages of the notebook, a brightness shining in his eyes. “Hmm. Interesting, and not without promise.” He patted Watson’s arm. “Before we visit the Fossets, I believe that the church may furnish further information. Be prepared for anything including violence,“ he warned. “We may yet witness the dead walk amongst us.”
"Can't believe he had a gun," John muttered. "I snuck into the tower while Lestrade was up there. Heard them discussing it." He didn't mention hearing Lestrade half crying, ending up shouting at his team and needing to be removed. "That was probably just to fuck you up mentally..."
Something in Lestrade's voice told Sherlock he understood, without him having said anything, exactly Sherlock's thoughts throughout the past few hours. Sherlock didnt know how to express how grateful he was that the inspector hadn't said anything to sway Sherlock's thoughts either way.
Sherlock nodded gratefully and flicked some of the powder at the fireplace before stepping in the green flames and saying clearly "Diagon Alley!"
Sherlock nodded. "Although if sticking my neck out with you allows you to get hurt on a continuing basis, I'm going to have an issue."
But he found himself looking up every so often to watch John's brow furrow in concentration, his friend poking his tongue out between his teeth as he worked something out. And Sherlock wasn't sure how firm his resolve was in anything, besides the fact that he might only be able to pine silently until he was more sure of John's feelings.
'Sir, we have your brother's orders to. This isn't your choice.' The woman up front was still going by Anthea, even though Sherlock didn't know her real name. 'Unless you are going to either John Watson's or that inspector's. Then I'm fairly certain he would only lose his mind slightly.'
They went straight to the common room, grabbing books and parchment, and then settled in at their favorite table by the window to tackle the mountain of homework they each had due by Monday. Ten minutes in, a large dark owl flew in, dropping a folded note onto Sherlock's work and flying out again.
"Also, Sherlock, I did as you asked and passed along all the info I found for you to that Inspector Lestrade. He seemed really grateful. Hopefully nothing dangerous happens at the Ministry," Sally said worriedly.
"We were actually looking to speak with you," he said. William looked from Sherlock to John, who smiled friendlily.
"Where--?" But John was silenced as Sherlock started at some quiet noise, and pulled him behind one of the larger potted plants against the windows.
Sherlock nodded. He would have to find a way around Snape's requirements so he and John could take the potion, but he had a month to work on that. "Thank you, sir."
Lestrade nodded. "We'll have a team of aurors, and your brother said he'll show up to see it all through. If Moran tries to fight against all of us, he's gonna have a rough time."
"Speaking of Dumbledore's problems, Mary knows Lady Smallwood. I mentioned her in passing." John looked at Sherlock. "She seems like a great woman, but whatever strain Milverton is putting on her is taking its toll. It seems like he wants to drive her out of the Ministry or something."
Anthea shook her head. 'No. But luckily as Mycroft Holmes' trusted, I happen to know some of what he knows, especially if it pertains to basic levels of your safety.' She met his eyes in the rearview mirror. 'He's in a flat near the ministry. Spends everyday getting a coffee and then making the five minute walk to work. If I drop you there now, you should see him. He usually makes it home around this time.'
"I know." Sherlock's soft voice preceded him into the kitchen. "Just not as fine as it should be, yet."
"Whoever killed Milverton is safely in hiding, and will probably stay that way," Sherlock muttered. "They intend to keep themselves safe. What they did will keep others safe." Sherlock looked at Dumbledore. "I supposed you heard that that threat of Mycroft's was caught the same night?"
She looked curiously from him to John. "You're the two from that blog, aren't you?" She looked at John again and John shifted. "His blog. Love that stuff, it's brilliant. Irene's not in trouble is she?"
"You're just lucky no one is over here I can embarrass you in front of," Lestrade said, chuckling at Sherlock. He frowned at the sound of the The Who album. "What are we listening to?"
Sherlock handed back the vial, grinning and then kissed John, swiftly. He pulled back, still not quite used to being romantic with John.
Sherlock unfolded the paper rolling his eyes. "Lestrade passed on Sally's information, they're hoping to have a confrontation with the guy in a few weeks with the right timing. He asks that we don't get involved with 'Lord Moran' anymore since we've been asked to step away already."
Sherlock spun around quickly, wondering how he hadn't heard Lestrade come in. Lestrade looked at Sherlock with searching eyes, and then a gritty smile broke out across the man's face before he crossed the room in two easy strides and pulled Sherlock into a tight hug.
"I've only just broken up with Mary," John said, "Don't go pushing me on someone else just yet. That would look awful."
Three weeks later he was hugging goodbye to Mrs Hudson, making sure sigerson was firmly locked in his crate, and boarding the Hogwarts express.
"Yes, in fact. It seems two people weren't answering their texts after escaping a bomb in a swimming pool." Mycroft shook his head. "Anyways, we have leads on Moriarty.
"Where is Dumbledore's office, even?" John walked evenly alongside Sherlock; either Sherlock was walking slowly or John had finally matched speeds with his friend's long legged strides.
"Do you know what he's done? He always does this, he thinks it's some kind of game, ruining people's lives, hurting them, playing with danger-"
A bit of folded parchment was waiting on Sherlock's bed when he and John reached their dormitory. Sherlock unfolded it and John read it out loud, questioningly.
The torturer pockets his wand with a hurried "I'll be back for you," again in Polish and rushed out of the cell slamming the door behind you.
There was a knock on the door. Lestrade frowned and stood. Sherlock and John watched him, curiously.
John tried to remember what he'd been dreaming about. "What's going on?" He dug around for a clean shirt, reminding himself to get laundry done soon."
"Well, Miss Adler, let me compliment you on that martial arts kick," Sherlock muttered lightly, pressing the heel of his hand to his eyebrow and wincing. "Let me guess, your girlfriend was hiding by the front door."
"I'll try," Sherlock said and swept out the door quickly, breathing in the fresh air deeply. Something about the place made him feel pent up now, and unhappy. and maddeningly anxious. He flexed his fists and then headed off down the street, pausing only to light a cigarette once he was a block away.
"We'll be in most of the same classes then, til we graduate," Anderson said. "Magical investigation is mostly the same courses."
"Here, drink some of this," he said, plopping a mug of tea in front of both boys and leaving a bottle of honey in the middle of the table. "Out of sugar," he said apologetically. Sherlock shook his head. "I'll be right back, gonna get a message to Mrs. H."
They sat down in speedys, ordering sandwiches and tea, and gossiping about John like teenagers at lunch (although he wouldn't know from experience, only from overhearing).
"Did you come here to ask after our health?" John asked. He still wasn't sure what he thought of Mycroft. Something about him put Sherlock at edge whenever his brother was around, and John knew he didn't like that.
"I know, you know." Molly stood. "I had a crush on you for... years." She was going red, yet Sherlock couldn't break eye contact. "Think about it, okay?"
"But," Mrs Hudson said, standing. "He's no where near as private as that brother of his. Mycroft Holmes is upstairs at the moment, waiting." Mrs Hudson rolled her eyes. "Can't stand the man much."
"There are some things that one would like to keep private. The people who have targets painted on their head are trustworthy and in a position to do good if things turn foul, whether in the Ministry, or here. Or if we were to have a second great war. There are many things that could cause a waver of trust in even the best of people."
Lestrade shook his head, taking off his sweatshirt so he was in a t-shirt. "Nah go ahead. Haven't been to have it looked at yet, we had a sleepover party."
"I'm wondering what exactly the photo has in it," Sherlock said firmly. "Three friends who for all intents and purposes seem like good uni-age kids involved with it, and yet Fischer senior says it would tarnish Will's reputation. And Irene at least thought it might hold her friends back."
"I know, I'm sorry..." He looked up at Mr Watson. "Is he home, by any chance? Was kinda hoping to...tell him myself ..."
Sherlock was silent in the cab ride, staring out the window moodily, his face still serious. John wondered about him, thinking back to a couple incidents previous. Mrs Hudson thinking they needed two bedrooms, Angelo assuming he was Sherlock's boyfriend... Sherlock insisting women weren't his area.
"He seems to think there's a danger lurking out there. But he doesn't have eyes everywhere, or contacts. He's limited." Sherlock shook his head. "I sent him and owl once I got back but..."
"Sherlock!" John called, sounding further away than Sherlock knew him to be. He breathed in and out, too quickly, trying to focus on the scent of the smog, the gasoline puddle left from a car a few feet from where he knelt. London night--
Sherlock pulled forward his own gift from John, finding a t-shirt with "The Seeker" printed on it. He cocked his head at it, wondering where John had found it. "He's gotten me a t-shirt," Sherlock said, holding it up and showing it to Mrs. Hudson.
John hoisted himself out of the pool, reaching a hand to stop Sherlock from swaying as his friend stood too quickly after doing the same. "Is it just your head?" John asked. The explosion didn't seem to have been as devastating as they'd both expected, although John knew they would have been seriously injured had they not leapt into the pool.
"Yeah. She wants to do math or something at uni, if she ends up going. She also wants to travel the world." John shook his head.
They sat down and make quick work of breakfast. After they were done, Mrs. Hudson cleared the table and summoned the gifts with two quick wand movements. Sherlock admired her skill in wandless magic; he hoped one day he would be able to do it.
He shook his head, pulling his textbook closer to him. These were all hypotheticals. At the moment, he had school to focus on. And two cases now, both of which he placed importance above that of romantic entanglement. The work was what mattered, and if he wanted to do more of it after Hogwarts, he had to keep doing well now.
Soon later they were knocking on the door to a student flat. John looked around at the empty street, contemplating how he hadn't thought of talking to Adler face to face either, assuming Sherlock would plan an elaborate and genius break in.
metal. Voices could be heard, louder higher than before with a  clarity born of confidence. Watson could bear it  no longer. He found sufficient strength to  speed ahead, ready to face whatever he found.
Holmes had already reclaimed the chaise when Watson returned from settling his patient. "And how is our patient?" he asked.
A pleasant lunch followed, one  at which Dr McLelland introduced those members of the College who were currently present.
Eleven o'clock found them well on their way to St Mary's of the Lane in Wiggin's ersatz Hackney. He weaved them across the city, avoiding the majority of the traffic via an unending trail of backstreets.
“Because I refused to entirely accept your death after Reichenbach, even when all logic pointed elsewhere?"
John thought of the burglary they would have to commit. "You're including me too, right? Because I care too, and I want to see this resolved properly."
Mr Watson blinked again and then smiled slightly. "No..no, sorry, he went with someone to Diagon Alley to pick up their books for next term." He shook his head. "Sorry...shock. Do you want a ride down there?"
William followed them to the hotel room door. "Next summer. Godfrey and I are planning to study in America for our masters level stuff. Once we're there, we're figuring out where to live and work."
The door to his right opened again and Sherlock got in with a plastic bag that looked heavy. The cabbie began driving again. Sherlock looked over to John and winked, pulling out a bottle of milk and two cans of beans.
"He knows some important things, but not a lot, John." Mrs Hudson smiled. "Sherlock and I are very different; he's very private."
Sherlock frowned. "She'd gained some press as an actor, I believe playing lady Macbeth at her university. She was trying to get into films. I kept an eye out; the stage interests me."
John gave Sherlock the nod to shoot the vest. He was afraid once again, but his brain would only let him think about how to save Sherlock, and how shooting the vest of explosives was the only way to save any future victims of Moriarty's. Jim Moriarty tilted his head, calculating and snake-like, watching Sherlock point the gun at the bomb. John wondered if it was all some psychopathic plan. He couldn't read people as well as Sherlock, couldn't predict what Moriarty felt or was thinking.
Other than that, this is about 2/3 of the way through Year Five. I have the ending planned, just a matter of getting motivation to work up to that.
There were sounds of screaming that rang out across the underground tunnel system. The guards on either side of the door didn't even flinch at the sounds of torture, instead stood still, keeping watch. One smiled to the other as the word 'Crucio' was shouted again and the screaming intensified.
John huffed. "I thought about if I'd seen any signs, and I hadn't. And then I considered that it didn't matter anyways. Because you're already such a different person than everyone else, what did it matter?"
Sherlock sighed. "Yeah I was still hurt. My back and some ribs weren't in great shape." He shook his head. "I know by now how to take care of myself by now though."
Sherlock thought for a moment. "I think we're going to have to speak to Milverton over break. Find out what he's up to. Mary or Mycroft might be able to help us get into his office at the Prophet, or maybe meet up with him at the Ministry somewhere." He paused as he saw Anderson and Sally walk in through the door, holding hands tightly, their faces red from the cold wind. He tilted his head, grinning, and John looked over as well. Sally pulled off her hat with her free hand, her hair springing out and Anderson watched, his eyes soft. Sally hurried up to buy them butterbeers and Anderson looked around the room, making eye contact with Sherlock then John and blushing, before heading over as John waved at him.
Sherlock nodded, setting his face. "We'll get the photos from her; she keeps them on a flashdrive. We'll destroy that and wipe her laptop. I'll report back to your father sometime tomorrow, and make my own excuses for why the drive will not be in his hands." He looked at William. "Don't worry. How soon until you're able to move away?"
Bell snorted. "Hope you fired the bastard. That's not so simple a mistake." He pulled out his wand. "Mind if I?"
I'm going to give a rough estimate of 3-4 chapters. Hold me to finishing this one this month. Comments are very very appreciated; they keep me motivated.
That Friday, Sherlock lead John through the Ministry, John turning his head in every direction to get a good look. They finally stopped on an upper floor, at the start of a dark hallway.
"I can do it." Molly nodded. "For sure. We're not friends, but we've talked occasionally. He's not exactly shy and he was one of the people who noticed some of the crimes going on two years ago."
"It was good to know in case we need to steal it, for some reason. But, no. I think you're right." Sherlock looked up as a light ran started to spatter on the ground. "I'm looking forward to what William Fischer has to say about it all."
"Please--" Milverton started to say, but Smallwood cut him off with a threatening flick of her wand.
"Sorry! Sorry!" Nell rushed into the kitchen and John followed, seeing black smoke pour out of the oven as Nell opened it. "It's my brother's birthday, I was baking for him when he comes over later. Totally forgot."
"He found testosterone, amazing really, that it'd taken him all of two years before he noticed. He had a little bit of a freak out."
He wondered if he should try John's house first or not, but decided it would be good to check there first. The only other place he could think was Diagon Alley, given it was so close to term starting.
"By the same reasoning abilities that you expect from me when I take on your case. You said it was a delicate matter?"
Dumbledore's look grew more serious. "I understand that you, Mr Holmes, have taken on looking into a problem at the Ministry. It's also gotten around that you were looking at Shackbolt--"
John walked down from the dormitory three days later. Sherlock was seated with Sigerson at a table in the corner, bruises on his face and a bandage on his left hand. John had to stop himself out of habit to ask what'd happened. He instead stood awkwardly until Sherlock looked up.
Sherlock looked over the table to John, sitting with Bill Murray at breakfast, and then looked down at his own food moodily. Post came and two owls, Mrs Hudeon's fluffy brown and Mycroft's stuffy stern one, landed before him. Sherlock was untying letters from their legs when someone sid next to him on the bench.
Sherlock met her eyes again, steeling his look as much as he can. He wouldn't give her away. He looked to John and saw the same look of understanding in his friend's eyes, and felt calmer. But his hands still trembled.
"Why are you in my flat?" John asked, as Mycroft busied himself by peering at some of Sherlock's sheet music. "You didn't bug the place, did you?"
20 minutes later, after getting checked out by an ambulance (sherlock now sporting three stitches near his hairline) John checked his mobile to find 4 missed calls from Mycroft Holmes.
Sherlock slackened in his chains, breathing heavily and quickly, every inch of his body feeling like it was on fire within him. His breathing quickened until something cracked in his throat and he started to sob uncontrollably, shivering.
John was deep in conversation with the blonde girl opposite him and didn't look up when he approached. But she did. He noticed her eyes change slightly when she looked up at him and then she was looking back at John, biting one of her nails and seeming nervous. If only he could allow himself to do the same.
"Ohhh, that's a lyric by a Muggle band," Mrs. Hudson cried, "My husband had one of their albums from someplace or other, but never listened to them. I'll dig it out for you in a bit so you can listen to it. I think that song is on there."
"My son was due to be married a year ago." Fischer shifted. "His junior year in college, he met a woman his age that he was quite enamored with." William blushed. "He asked her to marry him, and she said yes. This year she disappeared. Came to London, supposedly on a gap year. She's American, although she'd been in the UK for quite a while."
Mary titled her head. "During this conversation I'd assumed you were blond and a child when you'd chosen your name..."
Lestrade and Sherlock started keeping in more frequent contact, the two bouncing ideas off one another as to how to best find Moriarty. But Sherlock's website remained without any activity or comments, and Lestrade was running out of resources to use to find the man. At the end of the second week, it seemed they would both resume their intensity if anything interesting came up. Lestrade asked them both to go for a pint sometime in the next week; John agreed, Sherlock was hesitant.
"Are you...?" John trailed off, looking into his friend's eyes, thinking to the hardness in them when he'd heard of William's father's homophobia. Would Sherlock trust him? They hadn't known each other for very long, considering. "Nevermind," John muttered, looking away and out his own window. Sherlock huffed.
Anderson and John groaned. "We can't go one day without OWLs talk," John said. "A reminder of how I'll fail out of the auror track with potions."
"Next time let someone else handle it, me, or anyone else who thinks you being alive and safe is more important than winning a battle," Lestade said. Sherlock looked at him.
"For god's sake, you sleep in the same room. He's quidditch captain, you're gonna have to try out for him."
"Care for a walk?" he asked Lestrade, after the wizard had finished helping Mrs. Hudson clean up. Lestrade nodded.
John laughed, reflecting on how often Mrs Hudson shared about her husband's drug ring over the past months.
"No no--" and suddenly the boy was a fit of whispers in Polish. The man listened intently, not even questioning how the boy knew of his cheating wife of her escapades with another man at the current time.
"One fixed point, no matter what happens," he breathed, keeping eye contact with John. "Your acceptance, no matter how eventual." John smiled faintly. Sherlock decided he didn't want to think about things, or worry anymore. How much trouble could have, and nearly, separated the two of them before this? He leaned over and kissed John softly on the lips, before pulling away, face feeling far warmer than it did before.
Sherlock snorted, watching as Bell guided blue, glowing smoke to Lestrade's arm. he looked to John who was watching closely, a crease between his eyes.
Sherlock's non swollen eye found it's way up to his current abuser and he swore as he recognised the face that lay beneath the hood.
Is the angst better this year at Hogwarts because instead of family and bullying, Sherlock's doing the emotion?
When he got out of the shower, he slowly walked back to the couch and his backpack, riffling through it to find a clean t-shirt, and froze when he heard Lestrade walking through the hall. The footsteps also froze outside the doorway to the room that Sherlock was in and Sherlock didn't dare turn around, knowing Lestrade could see that marks of 3 months of abuse on his shirtless torso. He didn't want to see Lestrade's face or know what Lestrade was thinking. He didn't want questions or concern.
"We'll probably have to. Or else next time it might catch him off guard if it's someone closer to him." They pulled up to where the Fischers were staying. "For another day, though."
"Please, do not have another panic attack on our way out, Sherlock, it'll waste precious time. We have 6 and a half minutes to get out of this facility before some more people of our ministry come in and they will not see me or you here, do you understand?" Mycroft sighed, closing his eyes briefly before unlocking the cuffs on Sherlock's wrists. "I should have been here sooner." His voice was curiously tight.
" 'I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit,' ” Sherlock laughed. "Fitting for both parties, maybe."
"Well," he said, sniffling slightly, his head still facing down as he addressed the man in the corner of the room who'd watched the whole ordeal. "apparently I can be broken. What is it you people want from me?"
"Mrs. Hudson told me last night," Lestrade said. "You never told me, I'd have gotten you something."
The son, William, shook John's hand. Fischer ignored it. "Yes. Delicate enough that I don't want it told to more than one pair of ears."
John shook his head, standing and following Sherlock downstairs to where he heard the kettle whistling. "You boiled water for tea?"
"He's going to see John," Mr Watson said. "I'm sure we'll here about it soon enough, Sherlock, you go on ahead."
"Should try to time a meeting at the Ministry with milverton or smallwood at the same time. Without telling him or Lestrade, obviously."
Sherlock and John sipped their tea in silence for a few moments, Sherlock trying to ignore the fact that his hands were still shaky. He was lost in thought until one of John's hands covered his own on the handle of the mug, incasing his hand in further warmth. He looked at John.
Sherlock shook his head. "Let's hope not!" The young woman hesitated for a brief moment, then opened the door fully to let them pass.
"So it's not about John nearly being killed or my... stint over the summer," Sherlock said slowly. Dumbledore inclined his head.
Neither of them pointed out what they'd noticed about the other, however, and had a peaceful and easy breakfast.
Sherlock shot him a look. "If you can do good, you should do good." He looked to Dumbledore. "I'll keep in touch. With both problems."
"No!" Irene looked unhappy. "Will's been one of my best friends. I would never do that to him. Or Godfrey, for that matter."
The air in the room froze. A light smile preyed upon Dumbledore's lips. "If I had many more people half as perceptive as you, we would be able to win the fight against those who would wish to do us harm before they gained any traction."
"Why can't you talk to Snape?" John asked Sherlock. He deepened his voice, making Milly snort. "Professor, I'm so BORED by all this OWL level stuff, and I wondered if I could try something more difficult. I remembered reading about Polyjuice potions--"
Lestrade sat them both down at his tiny table in the kitchen, magicking a kettle onto the stove and pulling out decaf tea. He still held his arm awkwardly, which made Sherlock frown whenever Lestrade moved, but Lestrade brushed off the concern.
Sherlock stopped and put an arm against the wall of the tower stairwell, burying his face in it. "I know," he said, his voice muffled. "It's just distracting."
She didn't say anything, just slowly came up to him and gave him a brief, but meaningful, hug and then smiled softly as his look, turning back and disappearing behind the shelf to where she'd left.
"At least you and Bell treat him well," Mrs Hudson said softly. "If anything happened to my boy, I'd have to hunt whoever was responsible down. And you'd look the other way, Lestrade."
"But you died, you jumped off the astronomy tower... last year we all..." She was shaking her head and looking from him to John and back.
The three of them piled around Lestrade's kitchen table and began to eat breakfast. Lestrade pulled out the Daily Prophet and set it on the table. "You both know anything about this?" he asked, mouth slightly full.
John blinked again. There was fire around the sides of the pool, Sherlock was gently treading water trying to keep both their heads above. "Yeah..." He looked around, ignoring the pain in the back of his head. Moriarty was gone.
John flicked to a text and sent, "Swimming lessons went fine, sherlock bumped his head," to Mycroft. He then pocketed his phone, prepared to ignore any calls for the next twenty-four hours, determined "not to see" any mysterious black cars if any were to pull up next to him.
"Lord Moran, Shackbolt, and Davies are the ones you want to watch. Let me know if anything changes," Sherlock said.
Sherlock looked at the group, feeling like he did finally have a family, and that this was the best birthday he'd had in years.
The class ended and as the rest of the students were filing out, Sally and Anderson made their way over to John and Sherlock.
"You can always hit bludgers at me," Sherlock offered. "Almost as painful as you trying to strangle me at Diagon Alley."
"I spoke to Mycroft about your time away," Lestrade said somberly, as the pair set off down Baker Street. "Or rather, he contacted me." He looked at Sherlock seriously. "I can't believe he let you do that."
Sherlock let out a breath, smiling faintly. "She's your family, and you're my best friend. I trust you both as friends."
Sherlock knows it’s a lie, but doesn’t stop himself.  He lets John sit him down and take him in his arms.  He lets John run fingers through his too long hair and press light kisses against his temple.  The pain is only an after-image, a soft brush stroke somewhere outside, a barely audible knock on the door.  It’s working.
The wedding is worse than Sherlock could ever have imagined.  He looks away when they say their vows in the church and he doesn’t care if anyone notices or questions it.  He cannot look.
“John, there’s something I’ve meant to say always and never have.  Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again I suppose I should say it now.”
He’s either on his third glass of wine or his fourth, he can’t really remember.  Sherlock used to hate drinking, it made him feel too sloppy and he didn’t trust himself.  But with John it was fun.  He could enjoy himself because he trusted John.  He had made it through the stag night without doing anything completely life altering, and so he knew he’d be fine.
“Sherlock, you can’t stitch that up yourself don’t be ridiculous,” John says, already trying to bend down to look at the wound.
“It was good to see you as well,” John said, feeling strange about the whole thing. His stomach and chest were doing funny things he was trying to ignore, and his mouth was incredibly dry. “Sherlock. With you I. I’m in moral danger. It all seems far too good to be true, you seem to be the perfect person for me. But you are who you are and I fear very much that, were I to entertain this idea of being with you, I would never recover should it end badly. I just really think I would be totally destroyed if this all went south. You would, I am sure, be perfectly fine in the end. Given your turned up coat collar and your cheekbones, and your insane intellect. You are the most wonderful person I’ve ever met. You would be fine. But um, I don’t think I’d survive it.”
Mary shoots Sherlock and he thinks this might be deserved, as he probably should have stayed dead anyway.
She starts talking about making coffee and the diner downstairs.  John can’t really hear her.  His head is pounding with the sound of his heart.
“Do you want to go grab lunch now, new shift on, I think we deserve it,” Mary says, her dark blue eyes staring at him.
Sherlock glares at the phone until it finally stops its yammering and then picks it up and sends a message to his annoying git of a brother.
thank you to everyone who commented, gave kudos, and bookmarked.  it rly does mean the world.  this piece is intensely close to me.  it was something i needed to write, so thank you.  ur all wonderful.  i sort of wanna cry.
Sherlock can understand why his brother is worried.  It’s true he hasn’t left his new flat in over a week now.  It does classify as “worrisome” behavior, he knows.  But he knows the real reason for worry and it doesn’t get any easier.
"He thinks I was set up. Asked if they were real, I said no. He was... f-furious when he saw the first photo." He wiped his eyes in his sleeve and John swallowed heavily.
“Let’s go,” she says softly. John pulls a few bills out of his pocket and gets off the bar stool. They cross the street to her flat, narrowly missing a cab. John pulls her out of the way just in time. She puts a hand on his bad shoulder and giggles again.
John, lying in bed with him, undressing him slowly, mouthing at Sherlock’s cock through his pants, leaving a wet patch on the fabric, teasing him endlessly.  John bringing his mouth back up around Sherlock’s torso, then his neck, then finally kissing him.  Going back down and kissing his thighs.  John finally removing Sherlock’s pants and then sucking him off.
John picks the gift up from under the tree, stares down at the wrapping he tried to do nicely but still managed to cock up.
“God, do you know how gorgeous you are?” John mutters.  Sherlock pulls him back up to kiss him.  He wonders how far he would be comfortable going in this moment and realizes that despite the fact that he’s not done this in ages he’s ready to do just about anything.  The man in front of him killed a man to save his life the first day they met.  Sherlock feels ready to do the same, and that, that’s utterly terrifying.
“You know why she won’t prescribe you the Prozac, the Xanax, the Zoloft, the Praxil, you bloody.  Idiot,” Sherlock says slowly.
“Yes, and you’re still at…” John’s voice trails off, not really wanting to say the name of the hospital Sherlock threw himself off.
A week later, John leaves Baker St. too.  He goes to the nearest pub and gets himself blind drunk.  This is how he’s learned to handle things and though he knows it isn’t good it’s what he has.
“John, I know how obvious I’ve been.  And I know…I know you’ve been through so much.  But that does not mean that I need your…your pity, or--”
Just a little under two years.  Sherlock’s hair is far too long and he’s been pulling it up.  The only upside to it is imagining what John might think of the length.
“To be honest. I was a little nervous about going up. Though you’re not…angry with me so clearly you’ve been getting my notes.”
He showers for a long time.  When he gets out he bandages his own feet.  He brushes his teeth three times.  He dries his hair with a towel.  He realizes he needs to get it cut.
He isn’t sure who he is.  The world has been turned upside down and inside out one too many times.  His own hands don’t particularly feel real or attached to him.
But this is how John finds himself watching Sherlock beat the ever loving fuck out of a man.  John is worried Sherlock is going to kill him.
Yet here she was in the middle of the home John had made with Sherlock, with nothing on but a shirt that didn’t belong to her.
“It’s really good to have you back Sherlock,” John says. His eyelids feel heavy. He rests his chin on his hand and leans forward.
He has one more cigarette before going into Bart’s.  He takes the elevator and then heads towards the lab, looking around to see if Molly is in.  He doesn’t avoid her, he never avoids anything besides his brother, but it’s good to know what type of day it’s going to be.
Holmes huffed. “However distant I might appear to the wider world, do not doubt the regard I have for those who eventually managed to break down the walls I constructed to keep them out.”
“I concur most heartily, Dr McLelland,” replied Holmes. “Please help yourself to more coffee and the paper whilst we pack.”
'The orange juice,' Sherlock called back, closing his eyes briefly before pulling on his t-shirt. He hovered in the doorway until Lestrade handed him a glass, noting the Lestrade looked as if he hadn't slept either.
"And..." Lestrade looked between them both. "Yeah... share the room but don't..." he trailed off, trying to word something.
Sherlock could've done science or philosophy, and wanted to be a pirate, but not to cause harm to others. No matter how cold Sherlock pretended to be, John knew his friend had a good heart, and one Sherlock was obviously dead-set on protecting.
Two hours later Sherlock was pulling a shirt over his bruised and scarred body and turned to the knock at the door.
"We need to get into Snape's office, somehow, during class. It's the only time it'll be unlocked and he won't be in."
"A monster," John said darkly. Something dark and sad flashed across Lestrade's face and John looked down, tension clear in his frame. Sherlock took John's hand in his own reassuringly. John smiled at him.
Sherlock shot back a grateful look, some light in his eyes that made John smile faintly. "Well then, let him come." And John followed him into the flat.
"Had a scuffle with Miss Adler and her flatmate." Sherlock gestured to the healing cut through his eyebrow. "In the midst of it, as she tried to wrench the harddrive from my hands, it broke."
As for the long waits between chapters, I'm currently working on a novel (isn't everyone?) I post updates about that on tumblr. Obviously working on something like that takes a lot of time and creative energy, so I'm trying my best to keep updating here when I find the time. I'll for sure see this series to its end, no matter how busy I become. :)
"Didn't know you played," Lestrade said, sounding impressed. "is that friend of yours, Bell, coming?"
"I'm just... not sure about it. And lately I've just been seeing her as a friend. Since that day in Diagon Alley, I've been thinking that maybe I just asked her out as a way to...move on after your death. I think I needed someone, and people like Murray and Mike just weren't cutting it. Even Molly. She's sweet but she's... young." John shrugged. "I dunno."
Mycroft frowned, shooting sparks from his wand and Sherlock twisted far out of the way to avoid it before sending a jet at Mycroft, lightning fast and it seeped into his brother. Mycroft raised his hands in defeat.
'I missed you you bloody idiot,' Lestrade muttered. 'Don't you ever pull something like that again, you hear me?' Sherlock nodded silently, not meeting Lestrade's eyes and Lestrade gave a deep sigh. 'What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with John or Mrs Hudson? Or even your stupid brother, he'd probably want to know-'
"Friday night. You're planning on seeing Milverton at his office in the Ministry? Not in a more neutral place?" Lestrade frowned. "Dunno if that's the best course of action."
"Can't believe you're back, honestly," Anderson said, laughing as Sherlock walked to the door. He stopped as he heard Sally's steps stop behind him, and turned to face her, no one else in sight.
Lestrade smiled. 'I'll even take you to Mrs Hudson's myself tomorrow. I'm off work, no major cases.Do you want food or water? You can take my bed if you want--the couch folds out into a bed-'
Sherlock nodded. "Pity we'll be out of Hogwarts by then. His parents were supposedly great wizards; he'll probably do well."
Sherlock shook his head, trying to squash bad memories. "There was nothing else that could have been done," he said. "I was already stuck in a place that faking a suicide would be believable. It worked out to--for the most part--play into Moriarty's hands."
He cleared his throat. "Vo-You-Know-Who rose to power, then there was a war against him and his followers. It wasn't pretty, because many of us got wiped out. And then, for some reason, he went to kill the Potter family-"
"Someone is with him," Sherlock breathed into John's ear. He felt his heart pumping quickly, distracted by John being so close; oatmeal scent of his friend's hair filling his nose.  Sherlock shook his head. Not now.
what happened," Sherlock said sardonically, standing slowly and shrugging his coat off onto John. John stood after him.
'I got hurt,' Sherlock said tightly, looking up at Lestrade and gritting his teeth. 'Badly,' he said in response to Lestrade's look. 'I was...I had to take care of some things that related to Jim Moriarty's death at the end of last term. It got me in a bad spot with some bad people. Mycroft had to get me out.' He sighed carefully and closed his eyes. 'It's fine now.'
The nights were the most challenging. Holmes' perception of time was muddled; he railed against Stamford's demand that he remain in bed during his spell of relative lucidity. He admitted defeat however, after his second bid for autonomy left him in a puddle of incoordination in the corridor nearest his ward.
Holmes offered his hand into her. "Consider yourself welcome at Baker Street whenever you are again in London."
"You- you wouldn't…” He blustered, trying to force out a  smile. “- was only joking…" She pushed down just a little more, a  vicious grin on her face. “Consider this a warning. Do not start a fight if you are not prepared to face the consequences." He gasped, then fainted. The other men managed to wrench away and ran down the hill, straight into the other chaperones and two constables.
The unity of purpose remained when, after dinner, the Fellows,  students  and chaperones gathered in different areas of the  College in order to prepare for the coming day. As ever, Holmes did not clarify his reasons, only promising that all would be explained once those who had been menacing them were brought to justice.
Even so Holmes succeeded in surprising him by materialising several moments early, a bright white smile on his face.
Holmes deliberately waited until Fosset was comfortably ensconced in the sitting room before making his appearance. Mrs Hudson fussed with the coffee tray, but her smile broadened as he caught her arm as she left the room.
The man nodded his bewildered, silent thanks. Holmes leaned over the bath, secured the plug and set forth the flow of hot water before leaving him to it.
The group turned a corner, heading past the Fitzwilliam Museum towards the southern boundary of the town. The light was fading into grey once more. Holmes and Watson pedalled faster, determined to keep pace.
“The next morning, I was opening the church for Morning Prayer when I heard an odd scraping sound coming from the body of the church, It was a dank, grey morning, wreathed in a fog which engulfed the porch. I called out, asking our guest to make themselves known, only to hear the clank of metal on stone and the uneven scuffle of feet hurtling through the shadows and through the side door and into the churchyard. The collection box was undisturbed, as was the silver plate. It wasn’t until I approached the middle of the church when I discovered the damage.” He fumbled in his jacket pocket and produced a lumpen handkerchief. “Lovellan’s memorial plaque had been grievously damaged via the judicious application of hammer and chisel.” He unfolded the parcel and spread the crumbled fragments onto Holmes’ outstretched palm.
