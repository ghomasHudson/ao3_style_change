“Oh, for goodness sake, Peter, would you get those beasts in hand before they feast on our guests?” he heard Tony exclaim, teasing, if a little exasperated.
Steve regretted somewhat that he hadn’t been able to restrain himself from physically assaulting Lord Stone, even though he had most definitely been baited into doing so. There were too many things at risk here, and Steve needed to act smarter than that.
It took Tony a moment to answer. He sounded relaxed, content and almost asleep. “Hmm… What do you want me to say?” His voice was breathy, quiet, a siren song for Steve’s ears alone.
Steve found himself torn. On the one hand, he desperately wanted to follow Tony, make sure he was alright, ask him what had occurred just moments past, and on the other, he realised he had to talk to, if not outright confront, Lord Stone about it.
Enjoy!
“Indeed he did. Mr Stark has been invaluable in setting the place up. Half the furniture inside came from the manor. Such a stark difference from his father, forgive the pun,” Mr Coulson noted.
“Tony is… it’s not his fault,” Steve objected quietly.
“Does your fiancee know about you dallying around with other people,
Steve’s hands were combing through Tony’s messy curls, basking in the familiar silky feeling of them on the tips of his fingers. In contrast to Tony, Steve had been unable to relax after their love-making. Instead, he was plagued with alarming thoughts that sucked all joy he might have felt out of his heart.
That, apparently, caused a chain reaction of gasps, exclamations of surprise, and shocked denials to fill the air, as the gossiping party expressed their collective surprise at the notion.
Doubt and guilt gnawed at Steve’s insides.
All of Tony’s actions, from the moment Steve had set eyes on him again to the last time he’d seen him, not an hour ago in the dining room, spoke only of a good-natured character and a brilliant, playful mind. He showed great care for others and a willingness to enjoy life in general.
Steve’s hands tightened around Tony’s shoulder, trying to control the anger that welled up at the thought of how much Tony had had to endure, without ever saying a word.
They moved as one body, waves of arousal flowing through them like lightning on a stormy sky, desperate and devastating all at once.
How many times had Steve touched that hidden token of Tony’s hair, knowing he would never be able to touch the head it belonged to? Believing with all his heart that the man who had given it to him was lost, a traitor, or worse, had never been real to begin with?
Tony wasn’t hurt.
To even consider that Tony wasn’t actually responsible for all the crimes he’d been accused of…It made Steve’s mind reel.
and all his silly inventions and the science that would have finally been made attainable to him,
Tony shut his eyes briefly. When they reopened Steve only saw determination in them.
, Anthony Stark had come to him -looking still so full of himself
What else could it mean but that Tony cared more about seeing the man again than learning of any progress that had been made in the effort to restore his good name.
Also, in case you were wondering what an occasional table was, in the words of my beta peach: "it's that small table that stands in alcoves and corners and serves no purpose other than being a place to put vases and ornaments and shit."😂😂😂
Each day, Steve struggled to keep to his preconceived notions of Tony, while the man effortlessly proved each and every one of them wrong.
“I’m really not up for anything more, Steve,” Tony began reluctantly, but Steve beat him to it.
What was most unnerving to Steve, though, was how familiar their description of Tony was. It was almost identical in tone and subject matter to the gossip Steve used to hear about the man back in town.
Please leave a comment, tell me your thoughts!
“That’s what you get when you’re not really concentrating on the game, Buck,” Steve teased, getting up to pour himself and Bucky a brandy. He handed the glass to the other man, nodding in salute.
Realising where they were and what was about to take place there, at an hour when a servant could easily walk in at any point, Tony protested weakly.
He felt more powerless than he had been in a long time.
“Not an issue. Are you feeling well? We did manage to get soaking wet out there, earlier,” Steve inquired and Tony had to once more remind himself that Steve was asking over his health only because it was the polite thing to do.
Steve had always thought the box had been made and not bought, most likely by Tony himself, because the decorations were simple and even flawed at points, the varnish had been unevenly spread, and the locking mechanism was overly complicated. It was perfect in its imperfections and Steve had loved it the moment he laid eyes on it.
. Steve, who had, even as a child, always called him by his given name, always Tony, and never sir or Master Anthony.
I can't tell you how nervous I was of how this story will be received, with my lack of beta and english not being my first language and all... So thank you for the kind words! And please do comment if you like the story, I love to hear from you. It certainly gives me an extra push to write.
For several moments, Steve found himself unable to move. He just watched, mesmerized as Tony’s fingers slowly disappeared inside his body, one after the other. It felt oddly perverted to watch Tony do something so sensual, so arousing, without the man knowing he had an audience.
Steve closed his eyes, shuddering at the thought.
“But Pepper, his lordship wanted to talk to me,” Tony bristled.
“What’s wrong with the one we already have?” Steve asked, indulging him.
Steve was proving to be a kind master, not that Tony had any doubts of his character. It was after all the reason he had pursued this so adamantly. But he did have some reservations where it concerned Steve’s dealing with him in particular, if their shared history was to be taken under consideration. But Steve seemed able to compartmentalise and he’d been nothing but courteous -if a bit distant- when instructing Tony in their everyday dealings.
He was walking back to his carriage, spirits significantly lifted, when he heard people chattering further down the path. Normally, Steve wouldn’t have paid them any mind, had they not mentioned his name, apparently unaware that the man they were talking about was, in fact, a few feet behind them.
Obviously pleased, the woman continued in a mock-whisper.
Peter headed first to Steve, taking his horse after the man had dismounted, while Tony waited patiently for his turn. To Tony’s surprise, though, as soon as Steve’s feet touched the ground he started moving towards him. He held his arms out in a familiar gesture that had Tony flummoxed.
Anyway, a thousand thanks to my wonderful beta reader EachPeachPearPlum, and to my equally wonderful beta/cheerleader AvengersNewB. I really love you guys ❤️❤️❤️
He cleared his throat, wishing he had more time to clear his mind as well. “I thought Mr Smith was the contractor, Mr Stark, and yet, here you are covered in paint,” he commented dryly.
Steve just couldn’t get enough of him, even if most nights Tony ended up falling asleep in his arms.
This was who Anthony Stark had been all these years. Who he had probably been all the time, even back then when Steve was too blind to realize it, too young and too
Also a big thank you to my very own cheerleader, AvengersNewB!
“It can wait,” Steve said, feeling strangely guilty not coming to Tony’s aid when the man had clearly meant for him to do so.
He threw a robe over his nightshirt and left his room, careful to make as little noise as possible. Then, he stood barefoot on the cold floorboards. At first, he was surrounded by darkness, but after a moment, he could see the rough outline of the corridor in front of him. And there, at the end of the long corridor, he saw a sliver of faint, barely-there light.
He came screaming Tony’s name, lost in the white haze of one of the most powerful orgasms he’d ever experienced in his life.
It was too much, too good for Steve to be able to last any longer. He sped up his pace, his hips ramming into Tony, coaxing louder and louder cries of pleasure to fall from his lips.
“Of course. You’re right, Mr Stark!” Peter said, finally smiling. “We’ll find a way to keep in touch, me and Ned.
Seated behind the desk probably finishing the day’s work, Tony mused. He looked up when Tony entered, as if surprised to see him. He was clad just in a silk robe and some loose pants.
Tony willed himself not to be overcome with emotion. But, oh, was it hard to manage. He had almost lost all hope of it ever happening. He had spent hours thinking about how wrong it felt to only hear Steve address him as Mr Stark, or -even worse- just
Tony was aware he was too old to be clinging to dreams and fantasies. This would have to do. He’d always been willing to give everything up for Steve’s sake, so he would give him this as well. Tony didn’t really mind. He would gladly be Steve’s mistress, his
There was no sign of the conceit that Lord Stark had been known for, no arrogance in the way he held himself when he talked. He liked a drink, yes, but only slightly more than Steve did, nowhere near as much as the rumours suggested. And he was eager to give his body away for Steve’s pleasure, but then, Steve would be the last to object to that.
Only then did he finally get a real reaction out of Tony. And what a reaction it was. Tony looked both indignant and inescapably beautiful in his outrage, confronting Steve on his own hypocrisy.
good. It could be one or the other. Tony was satisfied with the outcome, no matter.
He looked around the room. It bore a resemblance to an actual operating theater, supplied with proper equipment and the usual color scheme, but with plastic cloths hanging from the ceiling, partly obscuring the view of the gray industrial hall walls. He looked down at himself again; he was clad in only his underwear, every bruise and cut and inch of sensitive skin vulnerable to the open air.
It's not like most of his teammates don't know that Tony's marriage was an arranged one (it is mostly public knowledge, after all, even if the contract considering it isn't), and it's not like this is the first time Tony's ever had a bruised face because of Rick (hell,
he asks, unbelieving, as he frowns at the young man standing near Chester Darrow's armchair. He hasn't talked to Rick, the second-born of Chester Darrow's children, in years, not since the other boy admitted to not wanting to hang out with omega kids when Tony'd been twelve, almost thirteen. His then best friend, Richard Darrow, had then been thirteen and half years, born in the fall unlike Tony, already making new friends and mingling with fellow alphas in the alpha studies.
He clears his throat and lets his helmet retract. He waits until all of them are on the move, except for Bruce who is staying behind as technical support and backup if needed, and takes a spot by Steve's right. "It'll go alright," he says after a moment.
Steve met his gaze head on. "You're saying the kidnappers would've had to know about the trackers and how to disable them."
"What do you want?" he asked. His pride had held him back earlier, but now, after the beating Ezekiel had dealt him, and after the harsh words and accusations, he felt raw enough. Raw, like an exposed nerve.
Hammer nodded toward the blueprint between them, still smiling. "What do you think?"
"That's not what we agreed on, Stark," said Ezekiel.
The next time Tony kisses Steve, is a few weeks after the HYDRA raid. Rick is away, they are alone in the common floor living room and Tony's a little tipsy from good wine. He clambers into Steve's lap and seals their mouths together.
"You don't even believe that yourself, Stark," he said once his laughter died out. "But don't worry. I know the answer."
with her on most days, since she still hadn't forgiven Steve after the altercation with Tony. God knew, Steve had gotten stuck in the elevator more times than he cared to count in the past months he'd spent at the compound. And maybe that was his own fault. As it was, Steve hadn't been the most forthcoming with apologies, and FRIDAY could tell that Tony was still wary around him.
"Because you knew it was the right thing to do," Ezekiel replied, like it was as simple as that. "Because you knew that you shouldn't be in control."
"Good night, Rosie."
"Oh, you'll get the food and the rest necessary so you won't drop dead, dear Anthony," Hammer said and walked back to the other side of the table. "But wouldn't the encounter be much more bearable were you better...
Tony thinks proudly.
"You forget that I knew you when we were barely teens, Stark," Ezekiel drawled. "Of course I remember your infatuation with Captain America. It was borderline embarrassing."
"Leave it to me, зайка," she replies, holding Tony's gaze firmly. Finally, Tony nods, and moves to sit down on one of the barstools by the kitchen counter. Everyone else on the team is staring at him, but they busy themselves with eating (Barton), swiping off with a tablet (Bruce) or cooking (Rogers) when they catch Tony noticing. Thor, on the other hand, seems to be oblivious to the whole spectacle that had just taken place before his nose, instead intently wolfing down his plate of Pop-tarts, followed closely by his mug of coffee. The Aesir is the only member of the team that doesn't fit in any of Earth's genders. They know that his sex is definitely male, but his gender just seems to be.....nonexistent. Maybe it's an alien thing.
"You sure? I hear it can be quite hard sometimes on mated pairs." Tony bites his tongue at Rogers' comment.
"Rosie had a picture to show you. Right, Rosie?"
"But you could've stopped it, right? You fought him." He shook Tony by his hold on his jaw. "Yes?"
, he corrected his earlier thought,
He took the glass and eyed its contents. He glanced at Ezekiel, who seemed to be studying him. Not wanting to seem suspicious, he averted his eyes, then downed the whole glass.
Chapter 3 continues from around where chapter 2 left off, and we are currently living year 2013. It's post-Iron Man 3 and post-Captain America 2, but pre-Thor 2!)
"Checkpoint one."
Tony damn near winces at the volume Rosie yells for him, dashing across the room at the sight of her omega dad. He catches her mid-leap, pulling her to his chest and allowing her to nuzzle and scent his neck as a greeting. He gently pets her hair and presses a kiss to her temple. "Hi, pumpkin."
"Please," Hammer said, "take a seat. I was in the middle of brunch when you arrived."
Tony softens at the mention of his daughter. "Thanks," he says softly, instead of arguing that he doesn't need help. Steve nods and moves to start cleaning the counter from dishes used in their abandoned breakfast.
"We'll find him," Sam said, before he could say anything. Steve glanced at the other man. Sam seemed somber, but resolute. Next to him, Bucky nodded as if he concurred. Steve watched them for a moment, then glanced at Nat and Bruce, and finally allowed a small smile to curve his lips.
Tony huffs out a laugh and watches as the blonde pours antiseptic on one of the pads. He moves to stand before the engineer. "Is it going to sting?" Tony asks playfully.
Bates and the bodyguard walked him out of the dining room and through the lobby again, this time stopping by a door that lead to the basement. As they trailed down the steps, Tony noticed the drop in temperature and the hairs on his arms stood up on end. The basement itself was spacious and dim, only lit by a couple of hopper windows. The floor was concrete and the walls stone, and along the roof and up the walls traveled a number of exposed pipes. One lamp hung from the ceiling, but it wasn't turned on.
Tony hears him sigh in relief on the other end of the line.
The toddler shakes her head at the wooden object. "Not that one, Steve, that's easy. I want another one."
with you, you know that."
Rick lifts his half-empty glass at Tony. "Happy anniversary," he congratulates again, and downs the wine. Tony grabs his own glass and does the same. He places it, now empty, on top of the spotless tablecloth. Rick's chair scrapes the floor as he gets up, then walks up to Tony. Tony doesn't turn to look.
He cleaned his wounds as good as he could, but refrained from otherwise touching them. The dressings that the doctor had wrapped around his arm and leg, over the cuts she had done to remove his implants, were probably supposed to have been removed or changed by now, but Tony wasn't willing to expose the cuts to the damp and dirty basement, so he kept them on.
"Sweetie," he begins, smoothing his hand over Rose's forehead gently. "Steve will come home, alright? He's doing work with Clint and Nat, remember baby?"
Tony did, hissing faintly as he rested his weight on his sore thighs, staring at the stretch of floor between himself and the table Hammer was seated at once again. He noticed movement from the corner of his eye and saw Bates leaning up against the wall as usual. Next to him stood Ezekiel's bodyguard and by her side the timid-looking assistant, still clutching Ezekiel's coat.
"Not so fast," was what Rhodey told him, and in that moment Steve wanted to punch him for ruining his relief. He turned to see what the man was looking at.
"This okay?" Steve asks, and his voice is filled with....
He still tasked Sam and Bucky with going through the criminal databases to find a link between them. Rhodey had taken over interrogating Dr. Miller again, and after Natasha's methods, she seemed much more agreeable to speak with him.
JARVIS replies somewhat indignantly, as if he's offended that Tony even bothered to ask, but Tony's mind is already occupied by other stuff as he closes the door to his bedroom, so he doesn't pay the AI any attention.
Natasha had talked to the owners of the motel and found out that the room Tony had stayed in had been booked by a man fitting Marco's description. He had paid with cash and it wasn't the motel's policy to ask for an ID with customers that didn't reserve the room for longer than half a day, so there was no way of identifying him now.
"So I've noticed," he said, only letting Tony panic for a short moment before releasing him. Tony coughed and gulped in shuddering breaths as Ezekiel walked over to the table by the wall. It was in Tony's line of sight, and he could see a black riding crop in Ezekiel's hands as he turned back around. Tony swallowed anxiously at the sight of it.
"Dad, you've gotta be—"
Ezekiel delivered twenty or so blows more, until Tony couldn't hold back his cries and he was slumped against the pole, shaking from the pain. Only then he stopped, walking back to the table to return the crop there. He returned empty handed.
"Tell me about...
, dipshit," Tony interrupted, pressing the gun tightly to the back of Marco's head. He turned back to Becker. "You," he said, "If you want to make sure your buddy here remains in the land of the living, you better click the safety on on that gun and slide it over. Do
"Sarah," he repeated, "Go back to the hall and find Ms. Potts. Tell her what you just told me. She'll help you and your daughter."
Hammer met his eyes again, looking at him over the rim of his wine glass. "Yes, it is." He set the glass down and grabbed a piece of bread from the basket between them, tearing a piece from it languidly. "I will rebuild my company, and you're going to help me."
, Anthony. Now, look at me." His voice was almost as cold and hard as his eyes.
How did you like the chapter? Please, leave kudos/comment :)
"Becker is a handful, Sir," Bates explained without any actual remorse to his tone, "Marco informed me that this was his way of...punishing him for attempting to escape."
"Can you have FRIDAY send the location of the scene to the compound? To the team," Steve asked, eyes glued to the box and its contents. "Natasha and Bucky are going through CCTV footage to identify the perpetrators or maybe catch a licence plate. They could look through the train yard's cameras as well, see if there's anything useful there."
"Tony?"
Only four of them were in the back with Tony, Boss presumably sitting at the front with the driver, and in the low light he could clearly see the blue lights of the ear pieces they all wore, designed to filter out the frequencies of the sonic taser. The ear pieces designed by
Come say hi on
But, Rose came before everything to Tony. Of course Rick would learn to exploit that. Thus, with an angry and a little too shaky inhale for his liking, Tony yanked the golden chain from Rick's awaiting hand. He tried to clip it closed around his neck, but his hands were shaking too much from anger, frustration and the full-body sobs that he was trying his hardest to prevent from happening in front of his husband. Rick gently turns Tony around and finishes fastening the necklace.
"Yes, we are, munchkin. But only if Daddy will stop sulking."
He cried out as his abused back hit the cold and hard concrete and reacted slow enough to Bates' follow-up that the larger man managed to pin him down.
Weirdly enough, Ezekiel didn't continue. He had also stopped pacing, and the horrible trepidation it caused was what urged Tony to speak, "You did," he agreed, feeling sweat beading near his hairline.
Marco sighed and glanced at his phone. "It's 4:52 AM."
, he may appoint a suitable follower for his position with full autonomy (this follower must be previously negotiated and the decision recorded). If ANTHONY STARK passes away before the birth of an heir, the ownership of the company shall pass over to OBADIAH STANE and on to his heirs, as discussed in clause four (4).
They had studied in same grade, where as Tony had skipped three grades, Rick had skipped two (because apparently they were both geniuses), and Tony had heard of him enrolling at MIT too, although they'd never really crossed paths. There were enough students at their institute to avoid that.
Hammer tutted at him, letting his hand drop off of his shoulder. "Come on now, Anthony. I know you're tired and hungry. The quicker we're done here, the quicker you'll get your reward."
When he stepped out, Becker, who had been waiting by the nearest bed, walked to him and took him by his arm again.
Tony felt ill at the notion of Hammer calling him 'the goods', but he let it pass uncommented in favor of sipping his coffee.
...." was the last thing he heard before he blacked out.
"Get a hold of yourself, Stark," Bates told him, his voice low and cold, but Tony clung to the words anyway.
"This is what omegas nowadays wear, Tony!" he barks back at the shorter man. "And I want you to wear one, too." He takes the piece of jewellery out of the small black box. "Now, put it on."
"Then sell your shares to Pepper. See if I care."
"You don't even believe that yourself," Ezekiel said cruelly, crouching to loom over Tony. "I know he chose his buddy over you. I know that he left you for dead in Siberia."
Something clattered by his left ear and he turned his head to look at it. The woman had dropped a small chip into the metallic container. She stood by it, wiping down her tweezers.
Although, that scenario was highly unlikely, or so his doctor and his parents had been telling him since his first ever physical (which he of course had no memory of). All the signs pointed to Tony presenting as an alpha when the time for it came. And if not an alpha, then at least a beta.
Hammer raised his eyebrows at him. "You're referring to me getting kicked out of my own company, aren't you?"
"I know, honey," Rick answers sweetly. Then he nods at Steve over his shoulder. "A pleasure as always, captain," he says politely. The other alpha doesn't answer him. Rick smiles at them, steps into the elevator, and with a push of the button the doors slide shut again.
"F-Father, I can still—" His Father grasps his wrist painfully.
"That's not—"
"Hand me that taser then," Becker said. Tony tried to twist away from beneath him, but Becker pushed him flat against the floor with no effort whatsoever.
"Get the hell away from me!" he snarled, eyes trained hard on the syringe.
Tony wanted to bang his head against something hard. It was going to be a long day, zip tied to a foot of a bed with two kidnappers playing with their phones.
He threw Tony against the pole and pulled a sturdy carabiner out of his pocket. He grabbed onto the cuff with the chain again, pulling it back so Tony was forced with his back to the pole, and held Tony's arms in position once he had them where he wanted. Tony tried to twist around as the carabiner was attached to the D-rings, binding his hands much closer together than the chain had.
s. He was panting from the struggling and his injuries were aching anew, but his eyes were unable to look away from the leather cuffs.
He sighs and wipes his face with a tired hand. Nothing.
"Why is it always you three?" Steve asks, walking over to eyeball them sternly, "Even Thor knows not to chatter when we're on a mission."
He let out a startled sound when Bates lifted him up, and tried to twist away when the bodyguard pushed his arms in so that the chain got caught in the hook. Bates let him down and Tony was left half-suspended, his chest pressed uncomfortably against the pillar while his toes barely touched the floor.
"Dammit!" Rhodey cursed as he punched the doors in and promptly stomped through. As he followed, eyeing the bent doors, Steve wished there would be something inside left for him to punch as well.
The pin was laying on the edge of the tub, pushed up against the wall, forgotten by its previous owner and gone unnoticed by the person that had cleaned the room after them. And now it was Tony's way out of his cuffs. A stroke of luck, someone would call it. Tony didn't much care for luck, but right now he was grateful for whatever force in the universe that had conjured a bobby pin for him in that tiny, dirty old bathroom.
He came to a while later, shadows passing over his face as someone moved around him. His eyes followed the silhouette lazily as it busied itself with something next to him. Then it leaned over his chest and touched it.
Steve drags a hand over his face before sighing, and he seems to forcefully will his muscles to relax.
He turns to glare furiously up at Rick. "Why would you give
"Bates, do serve Anthony here a good portion of the dinner," he instructed.
"Our premarital agreement." He sees Steve's fists tightening. He sighs.
"Follow me, please," Tony shouts over the alarm, getting their attention. When discussing the mission plan, they had previously agreed on who would take which part of the mass of prisoners, and Tony had been voted to take the front if he needed to reopen any routes for them. "We'll get you out of here."
"No, no, no," Tony protested, struggling against the cuffs with all his might. He needed just one hand! The sedative would start effecting within the first two minutes — he would have to get away,
"And how's that—"
he told himself,
"You need some Advil?" Bruce asks from the other side of the work bench. The beta had previously offered to help him with his steadily increasing work-load, and although Tony's 'guilt-complex' (Bruce's words, not his) which is bigger than the Empire State Building had almost forced him to decline the offer, Bruce's knowing look and the his own near crippling stress had compelled him into agreeing.
He's just about to pull the door closed when Rosie halts him. "Daddy?"
"Really, Stark?" he asked. Beside him, Becker turned his accusing eyes to Tony as well.
submit to me, my sweet omega." Rick's pupils were dilated and his breathing heavy, his alpha side taking over as he imagined god knows what he would do to Tony. What he
"Ouch, dude."
"Does Steve Rogers love you?"
"Stay still, or I'll do that again," Marco finally threatened. Tony had been waiting for it. People couldn't help threatening him. "I'd rather you stay conscious for now, but I'll admit you're much easier to handle when you're out cold."
Tony tensed when Becker leaned closer to grab him again, but the Boss' intervened, "Marco takes Stark," he said with a tone that left no room for argument. Becker looked mad, but let Marco pull Tony out of the van, biting his tongue.
"Then can you get a word out for me? A location?"
Next, he grabbed the blue rope and unwound it, ignoring Tony pulling on his cuffs and twisting his wrists futilely to reach the carabiner — it was no use, his fingers didn't even brush against it.
"I'll change if you go and wash off the smell of that disgusting cologne," he says as he turns to walk to his room, and Rick barks out a laugh before agreeing to Tony's condition.
, he was sure that a mating bite would be a breach of contract. So, his colorful one-night stand history consisted only of other omegas or betas, males and females alike. People that weren't so driven by their hormones or social conditioning to claim and hurt him, and who weren't physiologically capable of forming a mating bond with him.
Jarvis lingered for a while in the background, tidying this and that, his calm manner not fooling Tony for a second. Tony knew Jarvis was worried for him. He always had thought both him and his wife had a soft spot for him, and they had only grown closer after all the misfortunes Tony had had to endure. He knew Jarvis disapproved of him selling the Manor, just as he had known since the moment he had gotten his titles stripped from him -and the last hope he had of restoring credit to his name disappearing with them-, that he would have no other viable alternative but to do so.
Perhaps there was some merit to that whole ball idea after all.
“Surely you jest?”
They turned at the sound of a throat being cleared, to see Lord Rogers -
“He was being unseemly,” Steve defended weakly. He was regretting having the idea of taking a walk after all. Why was it that he was always his worst self when it came to dealing with Tony Stark?
His clothes, though not the latest fashion -as they used to be-, still had the desired effect of making him feel good and look respectable. Tony loved making a lasting impression. One’s outer appearance was as important as one’s reputation, at least where high society was concerned.
Tony could only sympathise with the boy.
It was heaven on earth. Ecstasy. It was far better than anything Steve had ever felt. In one moment Tony Stark managed to erase all the others that had gotten in Steve’s bed before him. Steve bottomed out and stilled, trying to catch his breath and stop his overwhelmed self from going over the edge. Too late he realized Tony had brought his hands to rest on Steve’s arms and was lightly caressing him. It made fire course through his veins. Like that it was easy for Steve to pretend that Tony really cared for him, that Tony loved him.
When the first rays of dawn broke through the curtains, Steve carefully untangled himself from Tony’s embrace and slowly made his way back to his rooms.
Jarvis’ eyes lingered on him for a moment before he replied with a curt, “Understood, my lord,” and left.
On to the story!
“Buck…” Steve started but was interrupted.
Stark stiffened, nostrils flaring momentarily. Narrowing his eyes, he opened his mouth as if he meant to respond but quickly decided differently. He lowered his gaze, brows furrowed.
When Tony had announced to the staff that he’d be all but joining them in Steve’s service, Jarvis had been inconsolable on Tony’s behalf. To go from holding a title to be forced to work for a living was considered an abjection of the highest degree to the eyes of polite society. Tony never minded it, not really. Tony losing everything to his creditors would mean leaving them all out of work, no pension or compensation whatsoever. Perhaps the younger ones -like Miss Potts or young Peter- wouldn’t have too much trouble finding employment but Jarvis, Ana -and Beatrice and Tom and Hogan and so many others- wouldn’t.
“Look, who says you’re going to lose touch? That’s why we have mail, Peter!” He tried to cheer him up.
The only thing keeping him from completely losing his wits was the steady, calm beating of Tony’s heart against his chest.
Could it be possible that Steve had misinterpreted what he saw? He knew very well that his judgement was compromised where Tony was concerned, but could he really have been this wrong? Perhaps what Steve had initially read in Tony’s eyes as fear was instead shame at having been caught in such a position by a man that had, until very recently, been his lover.
"Should've brought a sketchbook," Rogers ponders out loud, sounding a little disappointed. He keeps eyeing from Rose on Barton's shoulders to the snow leopards, even to Tony from time to time.
What made it an eternity more uncomfortable, was when Rick said, "Come on, dear," giving him a dirty look over his shoulder as he walked towards their bedroom. Tony felt like throwing up for the second time that evening, but he followed his husband anyway.
"Good idea," Tony agrees. They do just that.
RICHARD DARROW shall provide to ANTHONY STARK and ANTHONY STARK shall in turn bear (a) descendant(s) before the age of forty (40) to the Darrow and Stark families. The gender of the descendant is not pivotal to this clause, unlike it is to the lawful heritage of
The belt
He had decided to focus on his surroundings instead of the inside of his head. It wouldn't do any good for him right now, dwelling on his insecurities.
"I'm gonna get some sleep now. Take the first watch?" he asked Becker.
Spider-Man glanced at Nebula, but the mask he wore betrayed no emotions. He turned back to Steve as he continued, "We think we've got a lead."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Anthony!" Justin Hammer greeted him back, smiling that obnoxious megawatt smile of his.
"What if the intel was wrong? What if we get captured again? Or, what if only one of us gets left behind?"
"Shut you trap," Rick seethes and grabs his chin. "She'll present as an alpha, trust me. That's what the doctors are saying." Tony reigns in the urge to point out that that was exactly what was said about him before he presented as an omega at the age of almost thirteen. "If not, then the ownership will just go to my sister's kids. She has three, remember? Two alphas, one beta. One of them can take over if needed."
was a maniac—"
Steve sighs and reaches with his hand towards Tony. He pauses midmotion, hesitating, but decides to just go for it. He reaches to touch Tony's injured cheek, and gently twists Tony's chin so that he can see it better.
Hammer was about to open his mouth, but shut it when they heard a car roll into the yard. Tony felt confused as he watched Hammer smiling and picking up his flute of champagne again, taking a sip. His smile was unnerving and Tony tried to peek out of the window that opened up to the front of the house. It was on the other side of the room, so he couldn't see who had just driven to the yard, but he could now hear two sets of footsteps moving closer to the front door.
Perhaps fifteen minutes after Bates had secured him to the pillar with the nylon ropes again, the door to the basement opened, causing Tony to jerk out of his fitful dozing. He looked in the direction of it, glaring tiredly and hoping against hope that it wasn't Ezekiel — he really couldn't handle any more of the guy, at least for the day.
"How's the crème brûlée, Rosie?"
"It's not 'nothing', Tony. This has to stop."
And clearly, his stress levels were the wrong thing to think about, since Rose lets out a pathetic wail at the change in her daddy's scent.
"All good."
"Your reactor," she said, tapping her own chest. His eyes widened. "Hammer has it here. Bates' guys brought it over today."
upstairs.
"It's 'Can I have another one, please?', Rosie," Tony tells her off absently.
When he gets to the penthouse, he gets an armful of his two girls as a greeting, smothering him with reassuring touches and kisses. Rose is openly bawling her eyes out and Pepper's not that far away herself. It brings tears to his own eyes as he thinks of the desperate moment in the confines of his suit, racing the nuke up into the wormhole —
So, it's the most magical moment in his life when he one morning finds himself hunched over the toilet, puking his guts out, and after a visit to his doctor hears the words, "Congratulations, Omega Darrow, you seem to be expecting."
"Stay still," she barked at Tony, buckling the other cuff tightly. She produced a short metal chain from the paper bag and clipped it onto the D-rings on the cuffs, securing Tony's hands around the pole.
"Nine
Natasha nodded. "A name."
So, he nods, and takes the elevator upstairs to get some sleep.
"It's this little shit's fault!" Becker said, shaking Tony with the hand over his mouth. Tony glared up at him.
Tony didn't answer the inquiry.
His embarrassment turned into bitter mortification when Ezekiel let out a chuckle. The crop caressed his back gently. "Good boy," he praised and Tony wanted to vomit. "Get a move on, then."
And yes, it would be much more bearable, but Tony wouldn't be able to live with himself were he to give Hammer what he wanted. So he said nothing.
"No, you can't. Is that all?" he replies, and is already about to turn and head out of the room when Steve's hand grasps his shoulder.
There had been a fundraiser tonight. And assuming that he hadn't yet lost track of time, it was still ongoing, just without him at the moment. He had been accompanied by Pepper since it was a Stark Industries event, chatting up some investors, when a disheveled-looking waitress had come up to him and told him that there was a disturbance that needed his attention.
He was in the middle of attempting to yank the whole damn hook off of the pole when the door to the basement opened. He twisted around as good as he could — which wasn't that much, to be honest — his heart in his throat as he expected Ezekiel to descend the stairs down. The man was ought to return at one point.
He peeks up and fires his other gauntlet at the goons, then pauses to watch as the JARVIS-piloted Iron Man armor tackles at least a third of them to the concrete floor.
"Whose fault was it?" he asked, his back turned to Tony. Tony craned his neck and looked up at him, confused.
Marco sighed somewhat explosively. "Just, leave it at that, man. We're supposed to only deliver him."
"No, Steve!" he interrupts. "Not all of us have the luxury to feel upset. I'm doing the best I can, and so should you. Stop trying to help, because you
He watched himself in the mirror as he worked; he saw a multitude of hand-shaped marks on his arms, cuts and bruises on his hands and face and his jaw was swollen on one side. Beneath the leather cuffs that still encased his wrists snugly, he could feel raw skin. Puncture wounds littered his chest, accompanied by the red flush of irritated skin where Ezekiel had electrocuted him.
so, this story WILL be completed if any of you are still wondering, either with 9 or 10 chapters in total, depending on how long the conclusion or the epilogue end up being. i already have ch 7 ready, just in need of editing, while chapter 8 and 9 are still partially in the making, so let's hope you don't have to wait as long for the next update :D
"Stark," Ezekiel bit out, resentment clear in his voice. He walked further into the room, stopping when he was only a few feet away from Tony. Tony felt himself go tense as he peered up into Ezekiel's eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
the effect his words had on his mate. He bends near Tony's ear to whisper,
"You're welcome."
Tony felt his gut twist at the words and the hairs at the back of his neck stood on end. He didn't want this.
"Good morning, Mr. Stark," an unfamiliar voice replied instantly, startling him. He whipped his head around to watch as woman in a lab coat approached the table he was strapped to. "No need to be afraid. I'm just a doctor," she reassured him with a smile, doing the absolute opposite of reassuring him.
Then Rick lets go and starts walking back towards the elevator.
The man that had first grabbed him, nose bleeding from Tony's punch and beard straggly, crouched down and twisted his hands behind his back. And all Tony could do was watch as he did it.
Tony doesn't see Steve before he, Natasha and Clint leave for their mission.
It takes Rosie about ten minutes to solve her puzzle, and by the time Tony has already eaten and is typing away another report. She helps Steve put back the puzzles before wandering back over to Tony.
Once free, he got up slowly,
By the time Tony was finished with his survey of the room, Hammer was finally reigning in the last of his giggles and Ezekiel was pulling out his chair and taking a seat opposite to him.
he says with unnecessary force. He huffs indignantly, "Married, remember?"
"I told you to look away," Beard said with a low, threatening tone, staring down at Tony. Tony met his gaze unblinkingly, too bullheaded to back off now. He could almost hear Rhodey and Steve calling him an idiot for it, screaming at him to cut it out. Well, whatever, Tony knew they took provocation even worse than him, so they could go fly a kite for all he cared.
Becker shook Marco's hand off. "I'm not afraid of Bates," he said unconvincingly and — with difficulty — seemed to regain his composure. Or, at least most of it. He sent one last vicious look in Tony's way, then turned around. "I'm going to have a smoke," he said and left the motel room.
He watched morosely as Steve pursed his fists, obviously fighting against the urge to punch something. They were now standing in the parking lot, having inspected the motel room and spoken to the owners and the residents. They had done all of that, and still hey were none the wiser.
he had thought at last minute, and gave them his old address instead, the penthouse being still owned by him and Rick, but now mostly empty and the whole building uninhabited. He was extremely grateful for his decision when the building collapsed in on him, almost instantly after he'd gotten on the top floor to check if anybody had taken the bait.
(which has also been on a hiatus oopsie)
allow it."
Tony glanced up at him in confusion. Ezekiel raised an eyebrow, the hand holding the crop twitching in warning when Tony didn't comply right away. Involuntarily, his body jerked into movement and he knelt back down. In a way, he was grateful for the position, since standing for even the briefest of moments had made his legs shake like leaves. However, kneeling in front of the other man accentuated the power imbalance, which Tony doubted was unintentional.
Rhodey took one look at the monitors and concluded that they hadn't been used in a very long time. Steve had been expecting as much. He sighed; he could almost hear Tony mocking them, standing there with them in the middle of dusty, broken tech and creaky office chairs.
"About to tell you...what do you mean? About what?"
"You fought him. And you lost. And everyone else paid for it." Ezekiel abruptly let go of Tony's face and grabbed a hold of his arm instead. He pulled on it harshly and Tony feared his shoulder would come out of its socket, but then he was falling down to the floor. He rolled over and glanced at his hands; his wrists were still cuffed, but the chain was now secured to only one of them, hanging freely from the D-ring.
"Are we gonna have a family dinner?" Rosie perks up at the question, eyeing her Father with keen eyes. Rick chuckles.
Howard reminds him. "It's not like...I don't...."
"Morning," Tony greets back, and lets the toddler change her strangulation hold from Rick's to Tony's neck. The toddler is still half-asleep, and seems to succumb into even deeper slumber once she inhales the scent of her omega Daddy.
I read them, I loved them, but my energy levels are really low. Yeah, I'm shitty, I know, sorry D:
," Ezekiel spoke over him, "that were you and your other superhero friends allowed to roam freely, it would be the end of us."
Rick growls against Tony's collarbone, against the gold chain resting there, not budging an inch. "I think you need a reminder of whom you belong to."
She chuckled at him, as if he'd said something particularly amusing. "Yes, of course, Mr. Stark," she replied. He just stared at her, having trouble figuring out whether she thought Tony was batty and was playing along, or she was the batty one and was just going through her day as she usually did.
Hope you enjoy this, regardless.
Steve's expression hardens. "I don't understand it, Tony!" he yells, frustration making his movements less graceful than usually. "I don't understand how you can just
"You're welcome, Rose," he says back and pulls out a phone from his chest pocket to occupy himself with. It's only around 8 PM, so he and Tony will be continuing to sit and talk, and Tony's already convinced that he won't be enjoying it.
"Hey," he gets the omega's attention. "Me and Clint are here if something goes wrong."
"Can we dig up any footage of the incident?" he asked.
Rick punches him.
(See the end of the chapter for
can the man be a menace with all that mother henning!
After getting the first bite into his mouth, Tony felt like he had waited long enough. "I do have one question, though."
A couple of hours later, when Steve was ready to go into the room and punch the intel out of her himself, an accord was finally reached. After signing the deal, she revealed what she knew; a motel address.
Tony resisted the urge to roll his eyes. "About what, Justin?"
He sighed softly and let his head drop to the blanket covering the end of the bed. He saw Becker raising his head in curiosity, peering down at Tony at the sudden movement, but when Tony didn't do anything else interesting enough, the man's attention was quick to shift back to his phone. Tony was left alone in his misery, which he was grateful of.
Tony places the glasses to the coffee table and takes the bottle from Rogers. "You drink?" he asks, gesturing with the bottle that he's in the process of opening. The other man nods and Tony pours him a glass, then one for himself. He sits down to the couch and swirls the contents of his glass carefully, the motion reminding him of his Mother. It's nearing 6 PM but there's still plenty of light streaming through the windows, although now starting to tint slightly towards orange.
Then Rick had offered Rosie a flower also, and of course it had been a rose to match her name, and the girl had gone absolutely bananas about it and demanded it to be pinned to her chest as well as everyone else to wear a flower to their chest, too. She'd even gone as far as distributing flowers to the staff that had set the table and prepared their dinner, before finally sitting down when Tony'd gone to fetch her.
He let Tony choke for a while longer, watching him and keeping him pinned down to the floor. "Hm?" he continued, raising his eyebrows as if he was waiting for Tony's answer. Then,
Whatever. Tony was trying to pick his battles and he was glad to get away from Hammer anyway, thank you very much. He made sure to send one last frosty glare in the man's way as Bates walked him out of the room.
"Shut up," Tony snaps, standing up to bring the book into Rick's line of sight. "You know that's not what I meant. It's by
"Love you too, Daddy," she tells him, and squeezes his neck in a way Tony has interpreted to mean she likes whoever she's squeezing. He smiles and blows a raspberry against her cheek, causing her to giggle and let go of him. He brushes a hand over her forehead in an attempt to calm her down before sleeping, then gets up.
"That's good enough for me," he replied. He paused before meeting Steve's eyes again. "Wanna come with?"
"FRIDAY?" he asked.
She continued, "It's not like I wouldn't find out if Tony went missing."
, would his mother say. "You?"
Thanks for reading, I hope it was worth the wait :)
"I don't know, are they?" he asks, stepping back and leaning into Rogers space. Yeah, because doing so was
"An astronaut," Tony fills in.
She swallowed. "Sarah."
The wedding ceremony itself was long and dull as the priest rambled on about marriage and love and respect and the hierarchy of alphas, betas and omegas in society and in homes. The audience sang a few hymns in between the pauses the priest made, and Tony was made to stand there in front of everyone, facing Rick.
When Steve still didn't do anything to stop Natasha, Rhodey shook his head and rushed out of the viewing room.
The weather is getting colder and everyone seems to be increasingly busy, especially Tony since all the big projects always seem to clump up towards the New Year. Also, the board practically breathing down his neck certainly isn't helpful, but then again, the board rarely is.
"Why?" Tony asked, pulling his arms to his sides. He was miserable and in pain, and just wished that Bates would give him a break before Ezekiel's inevitable return.
The elevator car finally stops moving, and Tony extends his hand before Rosie's face for the toddler to take, which she does, albeit with some reluctance. Tony knows that the three-year-old would have much preferred to dash down the corridors in search of Steve's room, but she's smart enough to know that the fastest route there will be obediently following someone that actually knows where the said room is.
Finally, Rosie is all packed up, and Tony helps her tie her shoelaces when they switch from the soft inside shoes to actual ones. They say bye bye to the teacher and make their way to Tony's sports car, which is parked in the private lot of the school. Tony buckles his daughter in, and only then does he fully take notice of the drawing clutched in the girl's tiny fist.
That was the name of the man that had been responsible for the cleanup. The man that had given Dr. Miller the payment for her job. Even the partial prints on the plastic bag matched Taylor's.
He elected to say nothing, turning his eyes back to the floor. It felt like submission, which Tony supposed it kind of was, and it twisted his stomach into knots with how wrong it felt. But he was going to survive. He had to at least try to get out.
"Hi," is what Romanov greets him with, coming near and taking a peek at Rose. Tony's still a little wary around the assassin, her lies still fresh in his mind, but the enormous, and more than shocking, enthusiasm the alpha has shown towards Tony's little girl has warmed Tony up for her. So, still a little stressed, but deciding it's the time to let go of the past, he pries the small hands off his neck and tentatively hands the kid to Romanov. The small break in the alpha's otherwise impeccable façade is mesmerizing, and she accepts Tony's ultimate show of trust with wide eyes.
The next day feels a little easier. Waking up feels a little easier, saying good bye to Rosie and leaving her at the preschool feels a little easier, and doing tedious paperwork feels a little easier. He suspects it's because he slept soundly for once, although he isn't going to admit that to Bruce. Even when Rick comes home early, interrupting his break, it doesn't annoy him as much.
They walk as briskly down the hallway, Rose tugging Tony along in a characteristic bout of stubbornness and Tony nudging his daughter to take the correct turns.
"JARVIS, you can loose the lockdown. I believe no one is going to attack my husband now." From his peripheral vision, he sees Steve cringing at the word he's using to describe Rick. Well, it took a while for Tony to get used to as well. Plus, it's the truth.
Over the little under three years since that moment in the Stark family manor living room, they had met many times in galas and festivities where they'd been made to pair up because of their now official engagement. Tony even had a diamond ring as a proof of that, although he only wore it if he was expected to attend some public or formal events because of his family name. Anyway, the relationship between Tony and Rick hadn't warmed up any since Tony was sixteen, even though they were now used to pretending the happy couple that everyone expected to see (even if they already knew that wasn't really the case).
Tony didn't react to the touch, but he turned his head away from the blueprints, staring at the wallpaper in favor of it. His hands, which were cuffed behind his back, tightened into fists and the chain attached to the cuffs
"Thank you," she parrots groggily and waves at the members of staff peeking through the door to the kitchen. "Thank you, Father." She waves at Rick.
. "Let me go," he demanded, glaring at the doctor as he struggled.
, Becker! It's almost morning, anyone could just waltz in and see!" He sounded pissed.
"Call," Steve said.
"You're all bruised up," he says, voice tight and slightly choked, like the fact that Tony has a couple of bite marks, a hickey and a cut on his cheek is killing him, like it's the end of the world.
"Is there anything we can do?" Steve asks, seemingly recovered from the revelation that is Tony's premarital agreement. He still looks angry, but a lot more calm than a moment ago. Tony bites his lip.
This one seemed to have some anger issues.
Tony blinks and turns towards the ceiling. "JARVIS, what time is it?"
Their mission right now, is to get the prisoners out (because according to their intel, there are two major hot spots of people held in cells inside the base), get clear, and let SHIELD operatives raid the base after they are done. Help in the raid, if need be. It's clean cut, it's clear, but escorting prisoners out and not getting caught is simply not possible. Someone is bound to notice at one point.
"Anthony, please!" Jarvis interrupted him yet again, shocking Tony with his uncharacteristic lack of restraint, shaking the still somewhat small head cradled in his hands as he did. "Promise me that you'll remember what I just said."
Tony chewed on the vegetables in his mouth before answering. His bruised jaw ached at the movement, but he was also famished so it was worth it. "Hey, I'm not judging. I know what it's like to get stabbed in the back by your own board. I'm just stating a fact."
His back was killing him as he lay there and tried to appear unconscious. The gag was gone, but his hands were still secured behind his back with thick zip ties. He was wearing the same sweats and the remnants of his t-shirt around his shoulders and across his chest. And he still bitterly remembered his botched escape attempt and the punishment that had resulted because of it.
Steve resisted reaching out a hand to wipe the smudge from Tony’s delicate nose.
He turned back and almost ran straight into Jarvis. The butler masterfully avoided the collision with a quick side-step. “My lord,” he greeted Steve, seemingly unfazed.
He knew that, since Tony was unwilling to share more of what happened, Steve had to find a way to make Tiberius Stone talk about it, though he knew it wouldn’t be easy. Even if Stone hadn’t tried to force his advances on Tony -  a distasteful, but infinitely preferable alternative to Tony being with Stone unwillingly - Tiberius Stone was still a man engaged to be married, and Steve was well within his rights to remind him of that.
The hours dragged by slowly.
Seeing him again is both a gift and a curse. The threat to Steve’s life rings a constant warning bell in Tony’s mind, but there’s still a small, shameful part of him which rejoices at Steve’s presense, so close to him after all that’s been said and done, still
Steve went entirely still. The army captain inside him recognized that Stone was simply trying to get a reaction out of him, but he couldn’t help that unnerving feeling that Stone was merely stating facts.
Steve smiled weakly, having been caught completely off guard. He had stopped following the ladies’ conversation fairly early on, and couldn’t possibly figure out what he was supposed to say.
Steve has been having some trouble concentrating. Neither his friends nor Tony are being any help.
After Steve left Tony had spent many years acting out against his father. Drinking and gambling away his allowance, not caring at all of the shame he might be bringing to his name. He had been so full of anger and spite against Howard for making him do what he did, for giving him no other choice than to break Steve’s heart
Steve frowned, his mind going over what he just heard. It was odd, but Steve couldn’t recall Stane’s name being mentioned at all during the entire business of the Stark Company’s bankruptcy. It was even stranger when he remembered that Mr Stane, a tall, proud-looking sort of man, had actually helped build the company from the ground up and had been a stockholder and business partner to both Lord Starks.
“How can I be of assistance to you, Sir Barnes?” he asked again, but Barnes didn’t rise to the bait. It was unnerving the way the man simply stood in the doorway, looking at him calculating. “May I offer you a drink perhaps? We have the most enticing collection of brandy as I am sure you already know. Truly, I could never find it in myself to be parted from it, no matter how much one could make from such a sale. Nothing beats a good spirit, I always say. Maybe I could have Jarvis bring a glass up for you?”
It was unfortunate that Tony no longer had the means to help the boy get further in life than being a servant. But Tony had long ago run out of money to spend on things like funding university tuition for his orphaned servants, no matter how much he liked Peter.
Steve sighed, turning the key to unlock the box. The mechanism clicked and the top sprang open. Steve’s fingers hesitated for a moment, caressing the worn edges of a heart carved on one of the sides.
. What was it but another title for him to bear?
“We should head back before you catch a cold,” Steve said, trying for a change in the subject.
“...Because I have the distinct impression that she would greatly disapprove of this…thing you have going on with Stark,” he finished, lifting a daring brow at Steve.
In truth Steve, back then, had thought Stane dead long ago, like Lord Howard, so to learn otherwise was indeed disturbing news.
“No… He’s never mentioned anyone to me.” So… Tony had a man in the navy that he trusted enough to send on such an important task. Something inside him protested the thought of Tony trusting anyone but Steve with his secrets.
The next morning, Steve woke up earlier than usual. He took a small breakfast in his room and with it, Jarvis also brought in a letter that had arrived early in the morning, from Sir James Barnes.
“Yes, well, I seem to recall you were a lot smaller back then, my lord,” Tony shot back.
Steve obliged him.
Seeing the tray of tea and biscuits in Jarvis’ hands made Steve realise that, with all that had happened, he had completely forgotten about the rest of his guests and if they had had a safe return.
if he were ever to learn that Steve had actually accepted Tony’s offer.
“Mr Sanders says he saw their contract in the solicitor’s office. It’s written there plainly, for anyone to see! Thomas thinks Stark has been
Tony put down the letter, having read it for the fourth time in a row.
“Hmm..." Bucky replied, pensive. "Maybe.”
They were both locked in place for what felt like hours, until Steve took notice that Tony’s fingers were still moving slowly inside his hole.
“You asked for me, my lord?” Jarvis inquired, after Steve gave him leave to enter the study. Steve had been waiting for the butler to arrive for quite some time after sending his man to get him, and he had started to become annoyed by the delay. Tony had left the bedroom early that morning, before Steve had been truly awake to greet him good day, only to then get distracted doing some chore on Miss Potts’ behalf, and Steve had been in a foul mood ever since.
