"Yes?" the young medic answers, jogging over to a man who appears to be his superior officer, standing in front of him and giving a salute.
“Am I to assume that you are somehow responsible for this?” the solemn, soft voice seemed to be directed at Sherlock.
"John Watson will never let you have what you really want and I have it. You need me." Jim's eyes were wide and he tipped his head to the side, so self assured.
"If you get into any trouble then, I'm not getting involved." John hissed at him as they rang the bell at the tony row house in Knightsbridge. Despite the quiet street, expensive cars parked along the kerb, loud pop music could be heard through the windows.
Time for John to make his move. He looked up at her, she was still waiting for her answer. The room was quiet and Mary was waiting-- he was just going to lean forward and kiss her.
Sherlock stood up, directly in front of Jim. Looking down his nose at the shorter boy, he excused himself from the booth.
John took a big breath, turned to Mike and sighed…”Right… well, Sherlock and I had a bit of a row. And…” he left it there, waving a hand at the splintered mess.
" I didn't hear anythin'," He put his book down, sighing. He got up, walked over to the lift and hit the button.
In the toilet, he dumped his drink and planned to stop at the bar on his way back from the loo and get another. Jim could not be trusted. Maybe the drink was drugged.  Holding the highball glass up to the light, he noticed a slight oily, purple sheen at the bottom. He dipped his little finger into the remaining liquid--bitter, but not at all like alcohol. A small plan was now brewing in his imagination.
Sherlock…John got a chill down his back. He had to get to sleep. This would not do. Sleep would make this right. In the morning he could sort it out.  Sort himself out.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"Should we call an ambulance?" John asked once they had gotten to the street.  Bart's was only one block away.
After eating Chinese, the boys walked to the flat that Sherlock and Mike were sharing.  Knackerd from the explosion and stress, John laid down on the sofa and promptly fell asleep.
He made his way back to the booth, taking a small sip from the new drink. He slid in right next to Jim with a bounce. "Thanks Jim, they make great drinks here I just had to get another. Whoo!" he continued. "It's hot in here!" pulling slightly at the collar of his shirt.
Game's tiresome now. Not half as interesting as I'd hoped. Leave now or drink the beer then leave? Stick around for details or just call it a  boring evening?
When the lights went out and the stampede started, I was able to grab the girl I just met, Molly and head for the exit. We were able to get another 25 students out with us.
"Good man! See to it  that all supplies and personnel are notified of the coordinates for the rendezvous."
John was quiet on the ride home. He just sat there, looking out the window, managing his nausea, feeling his life was all to pot.
she started, looking down and shaking her head. "Is he seeing someone? Do you know?" she looked at me, eyes wide and her voice just a whisper now. "Does he have a girlfriend, because... I know it's silly of me but I think I saw a
John guided Sherlock to the loo, Sherlock occasionally leaning on the wall. He sat on the edge of the bath and leaned his head on the sink, moaning again. John filled the sink with hot soapy water and Sherlock used the flannel to wash himself the best he could. After washing, Sherlock's chest was wet and glistening with the drying soapy water. Two stray drops of water formed into rivulets and John watched them race down Sherlock's hard muscled back.  John cleared his throat. "How about a new vest, or......something?" John suggested. "I could get it for you."
If John didn't stop this now, they be doing this right here in the kitchen with Mike Stamford and his obnoxious girlfriend just a room away.
John smelled like cold air. He had brought the cold air from the street with him. I finally looked up after he smacked the arms of his chair and jumped to his feet, asking: "Can I get you a drink?" He was still in his coat.
He wondered what woke him, it was cold in the bedroom, he had kicked the blanket off. John grabbed his track pants from where he had tossed them on the floor and pulled them on.He got out of bed and walked to the loo.  Coming back, he noticed that the bedroom curtains were moving gently in the room, as if there was a breeze. That's why it's so cold in here, Sherlock probably left the window open after the explosion. Let's close that.
Sherlock knew very well that there would be no sleep for him tonight. He didn’t expect to hear from John until tomorrow at the very least. He stared at John’s paper. Best get that out of here now. The responsibility of that small sheaf was pulsating at him from the kitchen table. Drop it off at the professor’s office and move on with life.
When we're studying--I catch him staring at me. If I'm talking to him, he stares at my lips. If I turn my back, I catch him staring at my arse.
"I can. John--go get curry with Mary. If you are so worried, walk me over to school and sign me back in."
I stood up and hobbled over to get my jersey, the nights were getting colder. The new brace they gave for my ankle was an improvement on the old heavy plaster cast, so I was moving faster. A bit.
I tried to search his eyes in the darkness, They glinted slightly in the light from the windows. "I don't know what I'm doing." I whispered.
Sherlock was drinking beer out of a bottle, by far the quietest one of the group. He glanced over at me and his expression did not change.
“Oh no, no, sir. They---they… completely eclipse my knowledge of the subject matter. I--I find that I am unable to grade them. They are written with such depth and breadth of understanding that I…”  he trailed off.
“Do you two want to go and get a cuppa tea, then?---take a walk and get away from here for a few minutes? --and I’ll stay? Yeah--go an’ take a break. I’ll be here.”
Sherlock had not been to this flat or this building before, he wondered who’s it was. Sherlock had to dodge the beach ball as it flew overhead. This flat must belong to someone very popular at uni. Who could have all these friends?
Sherlock knew this question would come up. He looked off into the distance. "I'm doing community service. It's not really a dos house, it's a safe house. No drugs at all. And your welcome to turn me into the police, but they already know."  He took a long drink of his tea, draining the cup. He couldn't remember why he thought this was a good idea.
I reached out and put my arm up to shield her. "Jim, I don't think she likes it when you're handsy like that."
With his long legs extended, his knees almost reached mine. I finished the whole explanation with only a few questions from him. He moved his leg and tipped his knee to make contact with mine, bumping it. I looked up at him and he was smiling at me, eyes twinkling.
I took that as a go ahead and slipped both of my arms under John's vest and pulled him closer to me. I lifted the vest over his head, slipping it in between us, breaking a bit of momentum.
He leaned down to kiss me as he reached under my jumper, running his hands over my chest and down to my stomach. "Try not to worry so much, I'm doing better. And now that you're here, I'm doing
It's awful about the concussion,  I was pretty certain people would be hurt if things went as wrong as I feared. Too bad it was him.
Sighing, John realized he just wasn’t going to run into anyone else just yet. May as well head over to the house and ditch the suitcase. Maybe he could unpack a bit. He waved goodbye to Mike and grabbed the case.
Older John watches the two young men trudge up the path to the big house on the hill. As evening falls, the moon is bright and the air is full of tiny glittering snowflakes and anticipation. He glances back at his small companion, silent at his side.
"Oh no," she said with a gentle chuckle, "He just comes here sometimes and I...I let him. I try to take care of him...when I can."
I did find a pint and downed it. Now to find Mary and Mike. I also wanted to find the door, but we had all promised each other that we'd try to stay together all night.
I stood up when I recognized Jim and everything about the night he pushed me over the railing came flooding back. I saw red. I walked away from the table without a word to anyone, ready to beat the living shit out of him.
"Well yeah, my cousin Sebastian Moran, he tells me lots about you." He smiled and looked down at his feet. "It's funny, since he mentioned you, I've always wanted to meet you. Last time I gave you my number, but you didn't call."
were you keeping it?" John howled with laughter, and that's when Sherlock was convinced that yes--John indeed, had been drugged.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
He watches a tall, older man who appears to be in charge, come over to the group with a big tray. “Ok everyone- morning meds. Mary, you first.”
He pulled away from me laughing, that wicked smile on his lips that I love so much. "John, you're appalled by my weight loss." he started to rock back and forth slightly in my lap.
And I do the two lines in rapid succession, not being vocal when the powder hits the inside of my nose, but I'd love to moan too. I can feel my face flush red. I reflexively hold the side of my nose, leaning over, elbow on the table.
So John found himself skulking around Croyden, Stamford in tow, looking for an address. When she was in hospital, he looked though her clothes, and found a crumpled piece of paper. No matter that she was an adult, he was determined to beat the shit out anyone who was 'helping' his sister get drugs.
No answer, but John thought he may have heard some footsteps.  The door opened and Sherlock stood there looking much improved from that morning. He had taken a shower and changed into clean clothes, covered by a dressing gown.
John became very hot. He could feel the flush starting at the edge of his neck right under his collar. He started to sweat.
Thick black smoke crept in over the street. It didn’t take long for the sirens and flashing lights of police cars and ambulances to add to the chaos.
John--as opaque as he is transparent. As much time as we spend together, of course I know he has feelings for me, too. I just can't predict what direction they will take, Well, until now, of course. John has made a move.
I've been out every night with my floor mates. That's what your supposed to do for Fresher's Week, right?
Jim took off his coat and tossed it on a another nearby chair. He turned to Irene, his voice cold. "Keep an eye on him, I'll be right back."
Sebastian Moran, a hulking footballer in a few of my lectures. I had a run in with him two years ago.
I opened the door of John's room wider, so I could leave. Right outside the door, standing next to Mary, was Molly.
Mycroft decided to leave for his place close to midnight, promising John he'd be in touch if he heard anything.  John would be facing an anxious, sleepless night until Sherlock got home.
I didn't know him at all. What I knew was that he didn't have a history of being perfectly honest and forthcoming, now did he? The room swam before me. He's off the hook with the police, he may just not come back. I may never see him again. He didn't say anything when he left.
John's dark thoughts accompanied him all the way home. The long dark car smoothly pulled up to the front of Broomfield Hospital.  The driver was out and opening John’s door before he was ready to exit. He sat in the car, momentarily staring.
John pulled his leg out from under the table, knocking his chair over. He also ran his mum over getting to the phone almost dropping the receiver when he got there.
I put the article down. Hot tea would have been more welcome, but I accepted the glass. "Thanks." He was acting oddly, I thought, agitated. He sat down in his chair, coat off now, holding a drink himself. His eyes were shiny in the low light of our flat, it's always pretty dim in here. As I looked at the way he slumped in the chair, I doubted he needed any more to drink.
John opened the door a crack.  I was siting on the bed with my injured foot up on the seat of a chair, reading.
-he was with Jim Moriarty and that is a terrible combination. Mary was wrong, Sherlock may be young and allright --he maybe mad, but he did have family and he wasn't on his own. He had me. And I was determined to find him.
The boy, who was apparently teenage John Watson had a resigned look on his face, one full of too much responsibility for a 15 year old. Older John stood there remembering this scene from his past. He had been in bed asleep on Christmas Eve when he heard the front door fly open and bang against the opposite wall. From the upstairs bedroom he could hear his father downstairs, loud, blustery and drunk.
Jim headed straight for the back of the club and they were ushered into a private room. It was darker still, but the music was not as loud as the front room and was less of an assault on Sherlock's ears. As Sherlock's eyes adjusted, he could make out shapes of people sitting at tables and booths.  Purple lights illuminated the four corners of the room, giving it a somewhat suspended feeling.
"Professor, do you understand why I’ve asked you to come to my office for this discussion?" The Head of Sciences Department sat behind a large wooden desk filled with photos of his family, who had traveled the world. Small children in snow suits and ski boots. Smiling family group from the Great Wall.
I sat right next to him in my own chair, leaning forward, elbows on my knees. He had a private room and although the chairs were close, we kept our voices down.
Sherlock smiled again and drained his cup. He slid closer to me. "Of course I knew you'd be a gentleman, John." he leaned in to kiss me.
Sherlock unfolded his legs one at a time, placing them over John’s.  John’s legs were flat on the floor and Sherlock’s legs, being longer, were over John’s, but bent at the knees.
And that's how John found himself sitting across from Mary, ready to eat dinner--when his phone rang in his pocket.
As he looks around, John realizes that guests are arriving for the Holmes family annual holiday party. Lots and lots of guests. John thinks back to the first year that he and Sherlock had been flatmates. Sherlock had recently been discharged from hospital right before Christmas. Sherlock recovering from being injured during a very difficult case. That Christmas had been very quiet, there was no party at the Holmes estate that year. That had been a very special Christmas to John, as he first realized what he felt for Sherlock. Looking back, he was again glad there has been no bloody holiday party, getting his mind around his new relationship with Sherlock as difficult enough, he didn’t need extended family to negotiate.
"Sherlock, you drive me fuckin' crazy. I've felt this way for along time now. and I was just not sure how to go...about... this..."
"Well, if you change your mind, I have some nice tea and biscuits down stairs. Just knock on my door."
Relieved to hear Sherlock speak rather than be dead asleep, John says, “Honestly, Sherlock I got no sleep at all. I feel like I have been on a journey.”
He shook his head, took another sip and looked at me, quiet. "You don't have to. You shouldn't, really." his voice was soft, practically a whisper.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
“Yes.” John said. Sherlock helped him stand and started walking towards John’s room. “Where are we going?”
he says, and tips his head back, holding the right side of this nostril closed with the knuckle of his right hand. "Don't want to lose any of that!" his eyes are watering.
John thought he could feel the beginning of a migraine headache starting in his upper shoulder. The very same spot  where he had gotten shot in the Army years ago. A dull nauseating ache, starting in his shoulder and going up his neck into the back of his head. John made straight for the bus, no stopping off at shops tonight. For the last few years, he had started to have severe headaches--nerve damage, he thinks. 2 paracetamol and a stiff drink is his plan. Oh yeah and maybe dinner.
John explained to Sherlock what he found in Harry's coat pocket, his trip to Broomfield and Mycroft's help.
“Listen Sherlock, if you are going back to yours, to shower, I could come over after I unpack, ok?” John finally let go of Sherlock's arm.
John came up behind Jim. He was hoping he could make out some of the conversation. John strained to hear, Jim’s voice was quiet and the pub was still loud, even this late.
"Help who?" Sherlock squinted down at him, shaking his head. "Believe me, you don't want to get involved in any of this. Best to stay out of it, concentrate on your studies, medical school is very time consuming, I hear." Sherlock walked away from John, towards the cafe door, "Thanks Mrs. Hudson. Once again, I owe you." he said quietly reaching for the door knob.
Her cheeks got very pink, "Oh, don't tell him I said anything dear!" she whispered hurriedly, patted him on the shoulder and scurried away from the table.
This was one of the darker pubs, dark wood paneling with nooks and crannies where there were hidden booths for conversation, still poplar with uni students. Mary was looking a the menu with 'This Terms Highlights' printed on the top.
And we stood there, the both of us in the middle of my bedroom, right next to my large bed, where just the night before, we had spent hours...together, duvet and sheets still rumpled.
"Fine, let's see, then." Sherlock squinted in the dim light of the stairwell, trying gauge John's pupils. "Maybe not, but the light's not great here, let's go." he grabbed John's wrist and dragged him out the door and back into the party.
When I was with John, I just let the stash I had in my room just sit there, back behind the wall, unused.
The combination of wine and the hash was a pretty good one. I know exactly how I'm going to spend my weekend. I'd rather not spend the time in this room like a caged tiger, clawing the walls.
She turned toward him. "Serves you right--I should've just let you sit there and get the shit beat out of you--
John turned his body slightly and shifting his seat, leaned forward coaxing Sherlock back with his body so he gently fell backwards to lean against the sofa.
....John sighs, it would be much better if Sherlock didn't have another ugly black and blue mark against his pale skin when he was going to meet his parents. After a week of stakeouts and refusal to eat, he was thinner than usual, too.  John looked at Sherlock and had to wonder what his mum'd say.
Mary stopped laughing. “I don’t know what it is between you and Sherlock,” she paused, swallowing, serious, her voice cold. “…but I see how he looks at you and…”
Three rounds in, John was wining at darts. Ian walked over to him. "Watson, that bird over there is eyeing you."
"I'm surprised that you risked the very little freedom you had." Lestrade leaned forward in his chair.
Up on two feet, Sherlock quietly slips on track pants and walks toward the bedroom door. Opening it a crack, he looks out to see John on the phone. He has the receiver up to his ear, head down, in the kitchen.
“Sherlock, there are just things I need to do. Unpack. Say hi to my flat mates--" John voice got soft and quiet, "Which I didn’t because I rushed here to see you." he glanced down at Sherlock's face buried in his side, and reached his left hand to caress Sherlock's broad shoulders. John's hand moved down Sherlock's smooth firm back.
"John's not my boyfriend. Never was."  So, that's why. Getting me alone. What for? Business proposition, game of cards?
His lips are soft and his tongue is warm, and he teases my lips with his until I open my mouth. His right hand wanders down my neck to the buttons of my shirt. I feel a breeze as my shirt falls open and I can't help that a small moan escapes me as he palms my chest.
Now that I have him in the light of my room, instead of the poor visibility of the dark street, I'm starting to see how scary he looks. He was white as a sheet, dark circles under his eyes. He's thin, gaunt, unwell.
“Like that makes it any better.” John spoke quietly into his cup of tea. “Sure, I’ll go to Scotland Yard.”
“Fine then.” Sherlock hopped up from the bed and turned toward John. “Here, catch.” Tossing John the house keys, he spun on his heel toward the bedroom door as if to leave.
John cleared his throat, “Sherlock you may not feel like you have any responsibility to your flatmates and I guess you have a point, but you are only 16 and I…”
John knew very well she did not carry a handbag or purse, she was too careful for that, preferring to keep valuables in her pockets…closer to her body, less likely to leave anything behind.
John still held on to the fridge door and turned his head left to look at him out of the corner of his eye.
It was six in the evening. I looked up at the clock on the wall of the library and realized that I was starving. I wasn't going to get anywhere tonight with no food in my stomach. As I reached for my bag to get up, I realized that someone was staring at me. I looked up. They quickly looked away when I noticed.
"Got to get me what?" John asked quietly as he gazed at the wet towel, not quite sure what to do with it.
...."I worry about her all the time. Doing who knows what, hanging out with...with..." he gestured to the young man siting in front of him, who, for all the world looked like he was off to study hour, rather than a dos house. Baby-faced Sherlock in front of him looked to be about 12. John was sure there was more to this story but he didn't want to alienate this 'informant' of his.
"Why not? Unless you have something on tomorrow?" I reach my hand up his back under his jacket, step closer and kiss him. He kisses me back.
“John, John! Stop! Stop it! I’ll give you the bloody cocaine!!-- if you just-- stop! Please, you’ve made your point. It’s fine.” Sherlock's cheeks were quite pink from laughing so hard.
The meeting was tedious. Me, John, Lestrade, the headmaster of my school, and my favorite person in the world, Mycroft, were in attendance. I do realize that it's mostly because of Mycroft that I am afforded these concessions.
Lestrade stopped by but could not tell them how long it would take to analyse the sample. He put the sample into a plasticine bag and left as quick as he came, promising to call as soon as he knew anything.
“No don’t worry, it’s for the best. Wasn’t working out.” John grabbed the game board and folded it up and set it aside. He scooted forward and started to remove the books one by one. Placing them to either side of their legs.
meetings, but no reprimand occurred. In fact, he complimented me on not getting into any recent trouble and attending classes.
John walked over to him. "Can you stop?" he asked, too firmly, maybe, taking a flask out of Sherlock's hands. "We'll be leaving for your mum's house in the morning. You're not starting something new, are you?"
John reached over with his left arm and touched Sherlock on the shoulder. Sherlock reached over and wrapped his arms around John’s waist as he lay there, burying his face into John’s side.
His eyes were closed for most of the trip. He'd open them if I spoke to him. "Sherlock, watch the kerb. Lift your leg. Good. Let's keep going, right?"
John angled himself between my legs. I inadvertently moaned. "We can move to the bed." he suggested.
I stood up, placed my foot on the chair next to John and raised my trouser leg to show him the electronic tag around my ankle.
As far as explanations go, Sherlock felt he only owed John so much. But owed he did.   It was not a long explanation, Sherlock leaving out some more incriminating details. He discussed the night he met Harry-the same night of the overdose. He left out the fact that it was his brother Mycroft's car that took Harry to hospital, rather than 999.
John stood up to collect his books and jumped a mile when he felt someone touch him on the back of the shoulder. He spun around.
Sherlock waited until he was sure that John had ceased his infernal pacing and had gone to bed.  He waited an additional 30 minutes more until he was pretty certain John would be asleep. Sherlock got out of bed. He had something to do.
The plan is I have to spend three evenings each week with Sherlock, studying. This can be done in my room or the university library. I'm to go over to his school and 'sign him out' monday, wednesday and friday each week. Sign him back in sometime between 9 and 10pm.   This may commute the sentence I receive after my court case in the next 2 weeks.
He placed his hands around my waist, hooking his fingers through my belt loops, he used these to pull to me close. I laughed--
Once the boys got up to the flat, John stood in the middle of the sitting room, looking around with a big smile on his face.
Mary looks up and smiles. She reaches out and he hands her a small paper cup. Mary empties the paper cup out into her hand and John can see about 3 small pills there. Mary swallows them with her tea. John watches the rest of the people each get a small paper cup and do the same. A woman taps Mary on the shoulder, “Mary, I think it’s your turn for shower.” Mary nods and gets up.
John was now doubled over with laughter, sitting on the loo seat, holding the water bottle, tears streaming from his eyes.
I am only going to add one epilogue chapter to this to tie up some loose ends, but the story itself is pretty complete.
John did not get an answer as Sherlock put the keys in the lock and opened the door of John's new house.
"Oohh no," he said shaking his head and smirking. He took a few steps closer to me. "John's much too violent for me. I just had my teeth fixed, want to see?" he was right in front of me, mouth open, pointing at his teeth.
He looked forward to a quiet evening sitting beside a warm fire with his feet up and no responsibilities.
John walks in to the kitchen to answer the phone. His Father tells him Harry has improved, the tube is out and she's talking.
I opened my eyes, grey winter light illuminating the windows of my room.  I had a mild headache, left over from drinking. I hadn't drank that much, I thought. I sat up and listened for sounds in the flat--trying to put the night before back together. I can't say what I thought would happen-
John took them back into the family sitting room and gave them Harry's clothes. He hugged both his parents.  His mum had calmed down a bit, but was still tearful.
The trial went on without Harry Watson at all, as she was recovering in rehab. The doctors attending her thought attending the trial would be detrimental to her recovery.   After a few months, she was well enough to come home. John's parents were very grateful for her recovery, but still weren't sure of the part that John and the people he knew in London played in getting the evidence into the right hands.
John turns to Mary-not-Mary perplexed. “I’m, I’m afraid I have more questions, for you—for someone” he begins, holding up his hands, looking helplessly around no find no one there.   Blinded by a bright light, they are moving again. Not sure where he is just yet, he is blinking.
John's trip to London with Mycroft was uneventful. The flat was empty, Mike and Sherlock were still out. John showed Mycroft what he found in his sister's coat pocket. Mycroft called Lestrade, asking him to bypass usual channels to get the sample into the right hands.
The shock hits John like a wave. He can feel his cheeks flush, as anger and sadness crash over him. He feels unsteady on his feet.
Riding in the police car, Sherlock telling me he knows which police station were probably going to because he know which ones are open 24 hours.
I'm spending time away from my room. A talent of mine. I've spent a great deal of time avoiding being at school at all. I've spent a night or two at Mycroft's, but that can't continue. It's cold, so it's not as easy as it was to traipse about London.
Because I was already in love with him. Too late to protect my heart.  I just bury my feelings, secreted away, never to see the light of day.
She told John she wanted to take break from the relationship. That she was going to ‘think about things’ while on break and then they could see ‘how it goes’ when they got back to school.
I stood up and slipped my jeans off as he lay there watching me--maybe a little slower than I should have. John's heavy lidded eyes glinted at me in the semi dark room. He helped me work his jeans off. Both fully naked, I got back into bed and he reached for me.
Up in my room, I threw myself on my bed, hot tears filling my eyes and spilling down my face, head pounding. I don't know how long I was there before I fell asleep. After all, I had been up for hours looking for wire taps in John's room.
The prosecco wasn't half bad, really. Three pints and half a bottle of prosecco later, I was pleasantly tipsy. Not pissed, but drunk enough to believe than anything was possible. Like me and John.
Sherlock abruptly changed his mind. "That's enough, I think, time to go." and pushed him self away from the table and stood up. He looked over at the elderly proprietor and nodded.
I don't know where he was or who he had been with. I hadn't seen him since the day before, when he came home from the A and E. I think today was a work day for him too, but he obviously went out, after work. I imagined he was with that girl he was dating-no, they had broken up--a month ago, actually.
"No, I can do it," Sherlock waved John off and standing, insisted on going to the bedroom, shaky as he was. John followed. The back bedroom was large and clean with neatly made bed. Walking seemed to exhaust him and John stayed close, every once in a while putting out a hand or an arm to steady him.
I looked in the mirror, behind me, Jim Moriarty was leaning against the door of the loo, blocking any exit from the room.
John was afraid that summer break maybe a sore subject to bring up to Sherlock, but in truth, it must be said.  John’s mum wanted him to get a job at Tesco’s this summer. That would put the idea of him spending the summer in London (like Sherlock had wanted) right out. After discussing Jim, John may just as well bring up summer plans. This way, he'd get it over with on one horrible batch. So, plans for a horrible summer would be all set.  John would be stuck in Chelmsford and unable to drive, he wondered if he would see Sherlock at all.
I needed to help John understand why I was concerned. "Why would he just drop the charges against you?"
John felt he really needed to see this.  “But explain to me how you are 16 and in your third year of uni.” Sherlock had explained to John last night, that he was almost done with a Chemistry degree. >
John stopped stitching and sat back hard in his chair. "You'd better be nice to me, ya wanker. I'd be happy to leave."
Against my better judgement, I follow him, warning bells never stopped me before. It's just me and him in the back room. It's spacious-- sofas, card tables, mirrors on the walls. Looks like a gaming room.
"What in the name of God are you doing here? Where do you live?" John asked, mind spinning,  wondering now if his migraine caused a hallucination. Maybe he was having a stroke.
I guess it's over-me an' Sherlock. I'm really gutted about it, but I'm trying to keep myself together. I know I made him mad when I pressed him about the drugs. But he probably wouldn't have been so defensive, if he had nothing to hide.
I went to class with a heavy heart that week. I missed him and I wanted to apologize. I wished he'd talk to me, so I could just say I'm sorry. My feet were lead as I dragged myself to and from each building.
John shook his head “Why? You mean--the pub? Listen Mary, I have to tell you—I’m sorry. I--  I am, but I had to go help Sherlock…” he gestured toward the door. The party was so loud, even with the door shut, the noise was coming into the bedroom.
No one but Mike saw what happened, “Don’t be disappointed, Molly, he’s always like that. He just doesn’t like to socialize.”
His mother ran to him first. “Oh John!” His mother’s eyes were wild when she saw him, “….How?….How did you get here? Who told you? How did you know?” She looked helplessly from John’s concerned face to his father.  “John…we didn’t tell…” and falters off, bewildered.
John was sitting at a table, his head in his hands. I was standing in the middle of the room pacing, when Lestrade walked up to me.
Jim took a swing at me and missed. I dogged his fist. He pushed me, hard.  With the momentum I already had, I went sailing over the balcony on my way to the floor below.
“I’ll be 17 in exactly 3 weeks.” Sherlock interrupted, taking his coat off and tossing it over a chair.
At this point, I am royally stuck. I sat there as everyone decided my fate, the conversations floated above my head as background noise. No, I don't need to hear the current or previous charges repeated, I am fully aware of what they are.
“I’m good,” says Sherlock, moving toward John and wrapping his hands around each side of John’s waist. John gets up on his toes and tips his head up to kiss him and places a hand on Sherlock's smooth muscular chest, feeling his heart beating wildly, like he had just run up the stairs.
I could see who was taking now. I hadn't seen this bloke before. He was taller than me, in all black--well, what I could see that wasn't covered in foam. Molly appeared at my elbow.
John never minded a few beers, but tried to shy away from drinking too much, because of Harry. John wanted to have fun and relax but was afraid to lose control. He was afraid if he drank too much,  he would be doomed to be an alcoholic like his sister.
“Mary, what are you doing here?” he asks hoarsely, knowing full well that of course, it wasn’t really Mary.
“Uhh…No, just settling in, getting ready for the new term.” He said to no one in particular, smiling and pitching in, and setting out some cups and crisps before the guests arrived.
“How do you know?” Jim took a sip of his drink and swallowed hard, “That you weren’t in any danger?” He sneered.
She seemed to back away from Jim a little. She stood a few steps closer to me. Jim reached for her, it was more of a lurch really. She seemed to shrink from his touch.
John closed his eyes and leaned down and kissed Sherlock on the lips, that were so soft and warm and didn’t seem the least resistant.
The pub was quiet now, all eyes turned toward their small group, right at the front door, putting on quite a show.
John whispered, as they broke apart momentarily, looking at Sherlock's heavy lidded eyes. He reached up with both hands and pushed on Sherlock's chest, coaxing him with more kisses to lay back.
Mary was smiling and digging into a bag, she dragged out a smaller bag and showed it to everyone. Gold wristbands. "Queue jumpers!!" she said, holding the wrist bands high over her head.  "We get in ahead of everyone," she said, doling out a wrist band for each of us.
Sherlock lay his clothes neatly over the chair. I could see him glance shyly at me out of the corner of his eye. I don't know who was feeling more uncomfortable, him or I.
Sherlock walked a few blocks, wishing John was with him. That’s how he preferred it to be. Barring that, he wished he could be with John in Chelmsford.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Sex itself is just behavior, certainly entertaining, but doesn't necessarily make any promises. Fills the time, fills the senses, but doesn't fill the soul.
Sherlock sighed and his shoulders slumped a bit.  He shook his head, eyes closed. “I’m not angry with you, John.”
"Then don't." John watched as Sherlock lay there with closed eyes, his breathing a little fast and ragged. "Ever consider that you may have a concussion?"
When the boys got home they realized that Mike was not there. They took off their coats, sat on the sofa and tried to busy themselves waiting for Mike to show. Although unspoken, there was a tension in the air that Mike could walk in anytime.
"Leave? "You just got here! You haven't had a chance to see Harry yet!" his mum's eyes started to well up with tears.
My arm tingled from where John touched me, all the way to the pub. I shouldn't have come along, but...to be honest, I
He was falling, falling and fast--- ready to hit the hard ground--John awoke in a panic, sitting bolt upright, covered in sweat, he glanced around the room--Sherlock’s room, he looked at the messy desk, strewn with books--piles of them all over, the papers, the periodic table on the wall, the violin in the corner. And next to him sleeping quietly, Sherlock—asleep on his stomach, head turned away from John. The cold January moonlight streaming in between the curtains, casting a few stripes along Sherlock’s hard muscled shoulders and back…the duvet kicked off and halfway on the floor.—John’s heart gave a clench. And John wanted to run. To run from this--all of this. But he couldn’t, and he wouldn’t. His heart hammering in his chest, he touched Sherlock on the shoulder. They had to talk about this, middle of the night be damned.
John jumped up and paced around the room. He wasn't exactly sure what to do now. He shoved the small piece of paper into the front pocket of the blue jeans. This wasn't Scotland Yard and Sherlock was not here.  He could not just grab a random lab assistant and demand they they analyse what was in the small envelope.
Of course, there was my own charge I had to deal with, too. They let us both go home on bail, my court case a month from then, entirely dependent on how Jim fared.
Mary sighed. John turned back to her as he pushed the button to end the call. He looked at her apologetically.
Down a dark alleyway they went. As they approached their destination, Sherlock realized that this was no ordinary pub. The dull silver front door looked like it was from a maximum security jail with rivets around the edges and a large metal door handle. The front door was closed, but loud pulsating music could be heard from inside. "My Dad's place,"  Jim said.
"Code?" The supervisor repeats him, but he is not listening just now. He's lost in thought, staring off in the distance.
Sherlock sent him exactly 2 letters that summer and John dutifully wrote back. Sherlock's  letters were brief and polite, sparse even. Sherlock seemed to describe just being bored at home. The letters never said anything else about what Sherlock was thinking or feeling. The letters just made John confused.
Sherlock thinks that Jim is out to get me somehow and that he'll use the dropping of the charges as a distraction. I'll relax, forget about it--then out of nowhere he'll get back at me.
Sherlock laughed and looked away, eyes focused in the distance. Slowly, almost shyly, he glanced back at John, the tops of his cheeks a bit pink. John just now realizing that there was some tension between them-- that they were wary of each other, back together again, after a summer apart.
He looked odd when he got back to the table but tried to hide it. I was getting better at reading him, but only little. Nervous? Bothered? Worried? I wasn't sure. He was quiet. Usually after drinking, he opens up a bit and carries on about science, forensics, crime, body language, physics or eggrolls or something.
John sighed heavily and took a good look around. The sparsely furnished room held a table chairs and a small sofa. Stacks of out-of-date magazines were piled up on the tables.
He knew he was being stared at. The hair on the back of his neck stood up and tingled. Jim kept glancing over, looking at him out of the corner of his eye and soon he stood at Sherlock's elbow.
He bumped my knee again, twice, bump, bump. This time I reached out my hand to touch his knee. His knee stopped moving and he sat up in his chair. I gave his knee a squeeze. His hand found mine and he held onto me. I wanted nothing more than to jump up and to sit in his lap, but he looked so different, so fragile, I was afraid to hurt him.
Sherlock took it all in, quiet, thinking. He slouched in his uncomfortable hospital chair, staring, eyes unfocused. Periodically, he'd give me a sidelong glance, under his lashes.
Jim raised his eyebrows and looked at Sherlock with meaning. "You and I are a lot alike, Sherlock. Bored with the mundane people, same old thing, day after day.  Boring old routine. We're complimentary, you and I."
The next weeks went by in a blur. Sherlock was in hospital for two full weeks recovering. I couldn't see him the 48 hours they had him in intensive care for the overdose and hypothermia. Mycroft kept me informed.  After that, he got a raging fever and the doctors told us he had pneumonia.
John was having a very difficult time concentrating on Mary’s words. He was vaguely nauseated, too. He sat down at the kitchen table and rested his head on the cool table top.
"At ease, solider," remarks James Sholto, saluting back and giving the younger man a conspiratory wink. "I wanted to check your progress on the 'Christmas Campaign'.
Jim and Mary looked each other conspiratorially and laughed. "Well, one of the batches of cider has been spiked, I hear. Do you know which one you've had?"
Up the small stoop and into the front hall the boys trudged. John was certainly happy  to see Sherlock but the last thing the thought he’d do was almost punch his best friend in the face before properly saying hello.
In a few minutes he dropped off the paper in the correct office and softly closed the door of the building behind him.
He’d make a perfect target for a mugging just now. Newly arrived on campus, all the money he had to his name in his pocket. Three thugs advancing menacingly.
"Hello, brother mine, will you introduce me to you new friend?" he said extending his hand cordially to John.
I sat up. I have a headache. This is the beginning of a hangover, I think. Was I still drunk when Sherlock left? What time was that? What time is it now?
Sherlock turned from the window and looking around on the floor, scooped something up and put it in his pocket, carefully using a pocket handkerchief to avoid touching it with his hands.
"---you weren't thinking of leaving yet, were you?" John whispered. He walked me backwards until I was siting on his desk.
"Which one?" Mary asked, amused smile on her face, glancing at the door of the pub as it slammed shut.
We spoke on the phone a few times. Mostly, it was me talking and dead silence on his side, interrupted by coughing. At the end of each phone conversation, he thanked me for calling. I wasn't entirely sure that he wanted to talk to me, but Mycroft kept encouraging me to call.
The crowd dispersed, the bloke John beat up was taken away to hospital by the medics. There were only a few of us left in the pub. Those not directly involved in the fight were let go.
My feet sped me to his side. I hesitated when I got there. Years later, when I think back to that night and memories unwillingly replay in my brain, I remember how beautiful he was. Beautiful and terrifying. For a split second that felt like an hour, I looked for breathing. I could see an almost imperceptible rise in his chest. I knelt down beside him.
There appear to be quite a many children at the party. But no, John realizes, just two little boys, it just seems like more, as they jostle about and carry on amongst the adults holding canapes and highball glasses.
"How are you John?" she asked after getting a pint. "Here with the footballers, I see." Molly and her friends were pretty done up for a trip to the pub, she was wearing makeup.
Sherlock stood in front of the door. He didn't walk over to John on purpose, but leaned against the closed door and folded his arms across his chest, keeping some distance between them.
"Although women are at more risk of dying an unnatural death at the hands of a male perpetrator, not so, in this case." he continued.
"Obviously." Sherlock found thick paper towels, the kind used in posh hotels.  He ran one under the cold tap, wrung it out and handed it to John.
"That's the postal code for London. Knightsbridge, Belgravia, Buckingham Palace." Molly added quietly, chewing on her fingernails.
I shrugged. "Sure, fine. Can't get any worse. See you tomorrow, then." I hobbled away. Fine, let everyone pour into my empty cup.
Both teen and older John turned to look at the barren tree, not a present underneath. Not a light on, either. Their father unconscious on the sofa, but still breathing. John knew he would not wake until that afternoon.
John took another step and stood right in front of him. He tried to make some small talk, but the quiet tone of his voice didn't match the subject. “First match of the term is tomorrow.”
"The doctors are doing everything that they can, John. I have no idea what you think you'll accomplish in London." his Dad said quietly.
Mike had long ago disappeared into the bowels of the party and Sherlock was irritated. Under normal circumstances he would not find himself at such an event.
If Mary liked him, she liked him. If family tragedies and scandals scared her off, she was not the person for him.
"Hello John, nice to meet you. I must say that I was so relieved that Sherlock's name didn't make it into the papers this time, that I had to come over with food for you boys."
“Well, yes…um...we could get Chinese or Thai or Indian…whatever you want.” John's voice shook ever so slightly.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I look over at Jim Moriarty. He's sweating and looks agitated, smiling manically. Has he been talking all this while?
I looked over again, I couldn't help it. Sherlock looked my way, taking a sip out of his beer bottle. As I watched him, he looked right into my eyes and slipped the tip of his tongue into the the mouth of the bottle. I went red and looked away quickly.
Holding John around the back with his left arm and kissing him deeply, the deft fingers of Sherlock's right hand made their way to the top of John's waistband, rapidly working his leather belt open and easily getting his zip undone.
I heard someone shout my name from down the street and turned around. "Sherlock! Walking back to school?" It was Sebastian Moran, out of breath. I'd like to avoid him, but it looks like he's walking back to school too.
"Sorry?" Ian was not one for gossip that goes on constantly among the footballers and their girlfriends.
John chuckled softly, shaking his head at Mike. No one wants their mum to kiss and fuss over them when their mates were watching. Mike was sure to take a ribbing later.
Sherlock turned back towards Jim. "Just why are you so fascinated with me, Jim? Just why are you pursuing me?" he asked, voice deadly low.
"No. That's at Oxford. I thought you went to University of London." Sherlock was tired of all the hilarity.
John laughed and rubbed his cold, blue hands together for warmth.  "Right, I just needed to go out and get a breath of fresh air. It's just too stuffy in here." John couldn’t relax. He didn’t know why and he didn’t have anyone he could confide in.
“Mary, not now, please.” John was shaking his hand and wincing. “It’s Jim that’d better have a good reason for his actions.” John was pointing at Jim and practically shaking.
"Yes, my friend here had a bit too much, can you help us take him to the back? I think he can rest in a chair and I'll call him a taxi."/p>
"...gay." John turns towards him and adds quietly, a whisper. John's jovial mood sours, his face serious.
After Sherlock brushed his teeth, he climbed into the bed and lay next to John who seemed to be snoring. He reached up to turn off the bedside light.
Luckily, these young men take their job seriously, reporting everything from the meaningful to the mundane.
John stood there shakily and squinted to look at his wristwatch. "Techni--technically, it's tomorrow. It's 1 am." he slurred his words slightly, but his eyes twinkled and he looked pretty proud of his snappy comeback.
"Here? Tonight?" his voice, usually so deep and resonant, is soft and low. He steps closer to me. His shoulder slides down a bit as he leans on the door. We're almost the same height this way.
The last thing that Sherlock would tolerate was being hemmed in between Irene Adler and Jim Moriarty. He didn't like where this was headed. He wasn't sure where his coat was. He scooped up his drink, muttered 'Excuse me," and slipped out of the booth on Irene's side, who moved out obligingly.
John let himself be dragged through the loud, misty party. Terrified to open his eyes, he was aware that there were people on all sides of him dancing. They ended up at the loo. Sherlock pushed him inside the tiny WC and closed the door. The lights were blinding. John could just stand there and shield his eyes.
He turned quickly, getting away from John as he twisted, and they both ran, coat between them but got only a few steps before they tumbled over each other’s legs and feet and crashed into the coffee table, smashing it into pieces.
“Last night, you were the one who noticed Mike bleeding from the back of the head-again supporting someone who is training to be a medical observer. When I got up to look at your kitchen window-- it was open.”  Sherlock said as he turned to look at John, who was now behind him.
He was glad he decided to purchase the screwdriver, mostly for its appearance of harmlessness, just in case he was caught. A pocket knife would work too, but there’s always more of a risk with a knife.
He wasn't sleeping, when called on in class he wasn't able to answer questions.  His mind was clouded with Harry and now with Sherlock. Harry was getting out rehab any minute, and he was positive she was not going home to stay with their mom. Where would she go? Back out on the street? She didn't have a job. Did the NHS just turn people out onto the street?  What did Sherlock say? That it was a
"Oh no, Mary, that's alright, you don't have to." there was an uncomfortable silence as John toed on his shoes and walked toward the door.
“It’s important.” John tried to make out Sherlock’s eyes in the dark, he thought he could see a cold glint looking up at him sideways from the pillow.
Sighing in resignation, Sherlock reluctantly agreed to go along with them to the pub. Just as well. They were very insistent. It was pretty apparent that they had already been to a few pubs earlier. The trio were grinning maniacally, cheeks flushed. Ok, maybe a pint--but that was all he would agree to. The new fixative could wait.
They told me I was lucky to be alive, with only a broken ankle, concussion and about 25 large bruises. All thanks to Jim, the wanker.
“I ducked down a side street and came up behind the building. How’s it feel to be outsmarted?” John was not smiling.
He can't let Sherlock pay for everything. Feed him, subsidize his monthly rent, put clothes on his back.
So, I had better explain, before I create a disaster (for myself) by having John think I'm putting him off.
He turned to me with a hint of a wicked smile, he knew, I think. "Yes." he said. I didn't doubt him.
Sherlock's face got even darker, if that were possible. He put on his shirt quietly, looking down. I took me less than a minute to realize my mistake.
The person/ apparition that was not Mary waved an accommodating arm. “I am to take you on a journey.” Was her crisp, slightly irritated, business like statement.
Before John could ask Mike what he meant, they were at the doors of the university. A long line of cars was queuing up in front of the gate.
He could see one thug coming closer out of the corner of his eye. As he turned his head he realized the other two had left, quickly ducking down a side street. John wondered if they would come up from behind him now.
Sherlock doubted that he'd go to the party, despite what John wanted. He found small talk with inebriated people tiresome at best. And at worst? In the past, he'd avoid most parties because it was so easy to get into arguments with the uni students. Unless Jim Moriarty was there, then Sherlock had a reason to go, to get drugs. If John wanted him to give up using, he'd best avoid parties and Jim. It was just too much temptation.
What a mess he’d got himself in with Mary and Sherlock.  John scrubbed his head with shampoo, hoping the blood would rush there to offer him new solutions. Harry’d have a good laugh at him and may still, for his delicate 'predicament'. John wanted to laugh at himself, but he knew better. The situation also wanted to make him cry at the same time. He slowly put his head back under the water to rinse the shampoo, the water was getting cold, he’d better get out soon.
John felt terribly guilty for leaving Sherlock as he took off from Baker Street towards his new place.
John put his hand on the doctor's chest and moved past him and a blink. At the same time, the lad in the hooded sweatshirt jumped up from his chair and took off down the hallway of the A &E, with John right on his heels.
He look at me surprised and silent. His voice was small and shaky, "That's what I'm trying to find out."
he arrived in a helicopter to whisk me away.  By the time Mycroft arrived and they let me up, both Victor and his father were gone. Taken away.
I expressed my doubts to Mike. "That's not the John Watson I know!!" he said, slapping me on the back after knowing me for two bloody days.
John sighed and shook his head, “You know Sherlock, I never have fun. Like this….” He pointed between them.  “…with Mary.  I have fun with you.”
"I think this is it." he gestured with a nod. The three story house looked like the others, a few broken windows, paperboard in place, to keep out the rain.
"Where's Sherlock been? I haven't seen him." She looked at me with those big round eyes of hers. She knows he hadn't been around. It's been a fuckin' week and a half. She's just being nice. Or nosey.
Two hours later, the flat was still quiet. Not able to relax, John jumped every time he heard a car outside or footsteps on the stairs.
The rain had let up, thankfully. John looked around. The quad was a riot of activity now, students getting dropped off, tumbling out of family cars, taxis and walking onto campus,
I've lost the impetus to visit the uni library or the coffee shop. I barely go to class. I'll soon hear from Mycroft, no doubt.
John was not sure where exactly to begin, he reached into the pocket of his jeans and felt the paper envelope--still there.
John stood on the kerb out side Speedy's Cafe on Thursday. The street was unusually quiet, John had expected more people on lunch from offices.
“What? No, not really.” John said, shaking his head, looking a bit confused at Mike. He squirmed in the seat, hoping he wasn't getting Mike's mum's car upholstery too wet.
He gets off the phone and sits at the table with his head in his hands. "Sherlock, I have something to tell you."
Mike turned red, his cheeks blotchy with embarrassment. He gave Liz a glare and put his finger up to his lips.
Victor's father was working with a network of international drug smugglers to bring drugs into Britain. Turns out, Mycroft doesn't know everything.
John watches Sherlock cross the room, to his side and reaching for the blanket at the bottom of the bed, gently, tenderly pulls it up to lay across John’s shoulders. He then goes over to his side, gets in the bed and turns off the light.
John tried to stay busy all the holiday, got a job at the local Tesco, but at any given time, his thoughts turned back to Sherlock. All day, every day.
A young nurse stood there holding a plastic bag. She had her light brown hair tied up in a pony tail at the back of her head. In her hands was a bag labeled ‘patient belongings’.
I felt a hot red flush creeping up my cheeks. I wasn't at all interested in why Molly was afraid of Mary. I was interested in who fancied me.  "How do you know they fancy me?"
"Well, to be perfectly honest..." the bloke was backing away, holding up his hand. With the other hand, he deftly picked up a poker from the fireplace.
The door to his room creaked open slightly. John popped his head in. “Oh, there you are. How do you feel? I have 2 paracetamol and tea, if you’re up for it.”
After Sherlock left the flat, John chided himself. After a summer away, their reunion didn't go exactly as he had planned, but it wasn't all his fault. John blamed Sherlock as well for the bad timing of his 'experiment'. Stomach churning, John immediately thought back to how much he wanted to return to uni and yet, here he was, screwing up.
I turned around, Mike and Molly were nowhere to be seen. I didn't mind at all, there was plenty to take in.
Removes the paper and cuts one straw into four smaller straws. Hands one to me. Pulls out a very small envelope and dumps a small pile of white powder on to the mirror.
John took another good look at Sherlock. He stood there with black, wrinkled, dirty track pants and the grey hooded sweat shirt. The neck of the sweat shirt was pulled out of shape. Sherlock was also wearing ancient black Converse trainers. When did he own trainers?
"Alright, Shez?" the voice belonged to a hulking young man, covered in tattoos. He put his fingers together and cracked his knuckles menacingly. Stamford put a little distance between the young man and himself by moving closer to John.
Sherlock was on the floor on top of the shattered remains of the coffee table, large wooden splinters everywhere. Their arms were tangled in the coat, each of them still having a good piece of it. John still tugging as Sherlock couldn’t hold onto it any longer and dissolved into laughter.
He saw his parents at the end of the hallway, making their way back. "John! Where are you going?" he father asked when they caught up to him.
she pulled him into an empty bedroom, the one that held all the coats for the party goers. She shut the door.
Sherlock can’t imagine why John has chosen to be with him. The fact that John would choose Sherlock over Mary--well that just boggles the mind. He was ready to promise John just about anything--the sun, the stars, the moon, and whatever else is in that damned solar system, but that’s not what John wants. John wants him to stay away from drugs.  Sherlock agreed last night, even though he is not sure it is a promise he can keep.
He continued, his voice shaking. "I just wanted you to know, that I'm a fan--of yours," he sniffed. "...a big fan." He cleared his throat and pulled a small envelope out of his coat pocket with two fingers and waved it in front of my face. He placed it into my front shirt pocket. He released my arm.
He stared at himself in the mirror. I'm too thin, he thought, my hairs’ too long, these trousers hang on me, he thought as he stood there in jeans and a white t shirt. I should wear a jacket. It’s January, after all.
What Sherlock was up to? I had just met him a month or two earlier and at every turn I learn something about him that's unbelievable.
Sherlock was standing up near the table by this time. He looked at John darkly and sighed. "Well, as it turns out...my first year at uni, I...I had a few of the professors taken out."
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The floor was quiet. I have to get Sherlock out of here before everyone wakes up or we're in for it but I don't want to think about it.
Sherlock kept his voyeurism brief. Although John may not think to look up at the windows, Mycroft would. When Mycroft did look up at the flat windows, Sherlock was not there.
His lips were soft and warm and tasted like Prosecco. I don't know what made me do it. It was incredibly stupid of me---but he kissed me back. My left hand wandered behind his neck, up into his hair. He made the tiniest gasp against my lips and I caught his lower lip between my teeth and sucked on it. I gently caressed the back of his head, depending our kiss.
Despite my best efforts, someone did notice me. Of course, this is my own fault, I have no self control.
John was not completely out of his depth. He had seen his mother mend clothes, and even though not properly trained,  wondered how different it could be to bring skin edges together. The blood loss and concussion were altogether another thing entirely, though.
“John, I have a shift at the lab today. I can’t just cancel. You can stay if you want to babysit. Sorry.” Mike shrugged, put on a coat and left.
Never thought he'd show up, but he did. We met irregularly over a few weeks during the first term. Never thought it'd work, either. I had been so disappointed by my lack of progress after the accident. Tutoring with Sherlock was enormous help and my marks did improve.
“Sorry Mum….it’s really…um I don’t think I can, um…” John felt his face turn red as he rubbed the back of his neck with his hand. How Mycroft came to know about John’s family emergency was the question of the day.
Sighing,  he was just glad to be home. Home. 221 B Baker street, his home for the last 10 years. The flat he lived in was small and dingy but there was no place on earth he'd rather be.
Too bad John was not here to see me being so competent. Trying not to think about John. Or what John
I know I'm doing too much cocaine when I clench my jaw. It's unnerving, annoying and painful.  The music from the pub is blasting through the closed door of the gaming room. The base is loud. I can feel the music pounding in my chest cavity. My heart's fast. My face is flushed. I'm jittery. And ecstatic.
John took a step closer to Sherlock, sliding his hand up along the underside of Sherlock's arm until he held his elbow and chuckled, “Yeah, you almost gave me a heart attack today, but I sort of liked it.”
“Thought you’d already had a ride to school.’ Mike said, smiling. He poked John in the rib cage with his elbow.
`````````````````````````````````````"`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Sherlock was pretty rattled. I had never seen him like this. I'd seen him drunk, annoyed, injured, arrested, angry, but never this upset, Jim
Teen John turned to his little sister and said, "Right, well, um...hey guess what? I think maybe Father Christmas hid something for you! How about you stand there and hide your eyes?"
John kissed him and a small involuntary moan escaped his lips. With both hands John reached around to touch Sherlock's arse. This time, Sherlock let out small breathy moan.
I waited. When he didn't back away or punch me, I leaned down to kiss him. John responded in kind, kissing me back gently, sighing. He ran his left hand up my arm and moved forward another inch, so that he pressed against me, slightly.
When he invited me to stay the night, it was fortunate that I had been propping up the door just then,  I might have fallen over.
John stuck in Chelmsford and unable to drive, working long hours at the local Tesco. John was not too sure just what Sherlock was doing over the summer, he never said. Sherlock was in London-only 20 minutes away by train or car, but it may as well have been the other side of the world.
John, you need sleep. So much has happened in the last 24 hours--don't you think you should try to rest--in order to face tomorrow?" Mycroft's eyes were deadly serious.
They took the train to Chelmsford and Harry picked them up at the station. John had told Harry quite a bit about Sherlock and Harry was very keen to meet him.
"I'll call as soon as I can." John all but ran down the quiet, white, endless hospital hallway to the elevator bank.
Back in bed, John feels fatigue pressing down on him like a lead blanket.  He is asleep for what feels like hours when again he feels a cold breeze in the room.
"Oh, don't give me that look," Sherlock said with a sneer, slightly irritated. "I can take care of myself. I actually do it all the time." And he walked past them, down the hall way to his bedroom, dragging his arm along the wall as he went. He slammed his bedroom door.
Inside the house, it was apparent it was Christmastime here too. In the corner of the room was a little spruce, decorated with paper chains.  In the middle of the room was a little girl of about 9 and an older boy of about 15 standing over a sleeping figure face down on the sofa. The little girl had been crying, her eyes puffy and her voice hoarse and the boy stood next to her frowning, looking tired.
“Good…. thanks.” John sighed grabbed the duvet from the floor and pulled it over both of them as he lay back down. Soon, he could hear Sherlock breathing evenly. John wondered if he was truly sleeping or just lying there, pissed off at him.
Jim reached down into the cushions on either side of Sherlock's thighs and pulled up two leather straps and tied his wrists.  Jim knelt down near Sherlock's feet and pulled out two leather straps to tie his ankles firmly.
heard 'round the world and everyone opened their doors, horrified at what they saw. Me, holding Sherlock, alternatively struggling to get him upright and guiding him to walk straight.
She quickly wedged herself between him and I and tried to make polite conversation while shouting over the DJ.  I edged away from them to try to find a nice simple, cold pint.
"You've no idea." Sherlock pulled John out of the taxi and into Baker Street. Up the stairs and blessedly quiet not  wake Mrs. Hudson.
Of course, I know why. After Victor, I just wasn't interested in relationships or people, for that matter.
We sat there for a minute kissing, then I made to push him back. He shifted and I reached under his jersey to lift it off. He pulled me on top of him. I leaned on my left arm as my right hand made my way to his belt. I kept kissing him, pulling at his bottom lip delicately with my teeth as I rubbed him through his jeans. He moaned into my mouth, breathless. I kissed along his neck-nipping and pulling at the skin
"Where is he tonight? Did something happen? Are you two allright?" she asked, whispering, now concerned.
“No…. pitch is unplayable after the recent rains—” John said distractedly, frowning and reading the fine print of the rules and not looking at all at Mike.
She was a petite blonde, young--wearing blue jeans and carrying a small handbag. Her short black wool coat was on the sofa near to where she was sitting. She wore trainers, which said sensible, practical, wore a wrist watch when no one else does--so likely a nurse, and had a few cat hairs on her coat-so living alone--in London, so has money.
"Whatever happened tonight, Sherlock." John shrugged. "It's ok.--I trust you." John's voice was almost a whisper.
He pushes me back further into the chair  and I don't want to listen to the nagging voice that tells me that this is a very
"Molly! Fine, I'm fine." he said. Molly could tell he was well on his way. John's eyes were glassy and he swayed slightly.
Sherlock is not as careful as John wants him to be. He can be quiet and dignified and brilliant as well as loud, brash and unapologetically himself.
I lay down next to him and kissed him, reaching for his cock with my hot wet hand. The lube was great, and his breathing changed to hot short moans. I angled myself along with him and took us both in hand. When the friction got too much, he added his lubed hand to mine to make things easier.
“Shhhh, no, it’s fine, John, please.” Sherlock said breathless, reaching up for John again with his hand, caressing John’s cheek and lifting his head to reach John’s mouth with his own. Again. Tender, hungry.
"What do you want, Moriarty-- you make a bee line for me every time you see me out. What is it for?" Sherlock asked brusquely.
Sherlock broke them apart. "Wait!" he whispered hoarsely, trying to sit up properly. Sherlock was thin but muscular, John had difficulty taking his eyes off him.
John looked at his feet and said in small voice, "Well...I'm meeting someone." he cleared his throat.
“Right. By the way, do you need a bath? Because you..well..” John pointed to Sherlock’s ensemble and Sherlock laughed.
“What? What’s going on?” asked John, making sure his feet were spread apart widely so as not to sway anymore.
".....find out when and where football is tomorrow." John tried to continue as Sherlock continued up John's neck to his lips.  Sherlock was naked save a bit of the bed sheet wrapped around his waist. Naked and determined.
After the scare from Mike, John decided a hot bath was just the thing to help him calm down. He made his way to the loo, tuned on the hot tap and filled the bath. The hot water felt great on his sore muscles as he slowly eased himself into the bathtub. He made a mental note to try to go for a run later since there’d be no football today.
Sherlock looked down at John's hand holding onto his wrist, his breath caught in his chest somewhere. “I have to go,” he said, serious, now looking John in the eyes.
I had previously reviewed the process that I used to render the appliance inoperable with Lestrade. He wrote it all down in detail and sent it in to the manufacturer of the device,  the extremely unlikely case that someone--
The Head of the Sciences Department thanked the professor for coming and explained that they'd be in touch.
There was a large cold, hard lump in John's stomach that he recognized as dread. He knew exactly how his day was going to go now. He would be reliving the times he spent taking care of Harry, making sure she didn’t choke or stop breathing after a night out with friends.
“Right, they went for tea. My parents--the Watsons. Harry…um.. Harriet--she’s my sister. 'told them I’d wait here.” John said with a weak smile./p>
I knew all the girls fancied Sherlock, not just Molly. I'm not stupid, I have eyes. I see them--the uni girls, the servers at the pub or at restaurants. Girls on the street, even. They all look at him and smile. He talks so much about body language, how can he not notice? He does--he notices. He just---
The only way out of this now is to leave the party, the mission will have to be scrapped. Sherlock did not get what he came for, nonetheless, progress was made, albeit incremental progress.  He called a taxi and loaded the still very high John in.
"I would be closer, but I've had something in my way." Jim fiddled with the empty wine glass and stared down at the tabletop, eyes unfocused.
"I can't believe he walked in the door with you." She shook her pretty head with disbelief and admiration. "You're right--he would never give me the time of day. What's your plan?"
I froze, hand on my coat. I knew at one this was a loaded statement, but I wasn't sure why. I turned back to Lestrade with what I hoped was nonchalance.
"It's our flat, we can do what we want." I whisper and caress his hand. I would have sex with John on every piece of furniture in this flat, if he's amenable.
Sherlock got off his chair like a shot and climbed into my lap. He placed his soft lips on mine as I ran my hands up both of his thighs, making my way under his dressing gown to his waist. The dressing gown fell open. I gave a gasp out loud when I felt his sharp hip bones.
Twenty minutes later I was on the kerb waiting for Mycroft Holmes to pick me up.  I expected a long black car with driver, but it was just Mycroft behind the wheel of a red MG convertible.
John turned to her, clearing his throat, “Fine yeah, fine.” He looked out the window again, drifting.
I had changed my mind quite a few times.  Finally, I had decided firmly that it wasn't me he was trying to get drunk--it was himself.
There were no speakers that John could see or identify, hidden-he thought-somewhere in the walls or ceiling.
His father shouted, "Hey ho! Happy Christmas!!" John had just lay still in his bed, in the quiet of his bedroom, listening. Johns heart was pounding in his chest but he knew better than to answer his father. As he listened, he said a small prayer that his father would not come up the stairs. Then, all was quiet. At least he remembered to shut the front door.
He walked back with me, chatting all the way. It was very suspicious and out of character for him. He only talks to me if he needs something-- and it's usually drugs.
Sherlock, uncharacteristically quiet, walks over to the sofa, sits down and put his hand gently on John’s shoulder.
It's better this way. I can't take any more of his pouting. Other people have begun to notice. so...
During the pandemic, uni is way messed up. Please join John for Fresher's Week (sometime before the pandemic) and we'll all live a little vicariously through him.
“All about you. About your eyes and your laugh and your experiments and your deductions.” By this point, John’s voice was soft and slow.
John cannot help but admonish himself for leaving his sister, although he knows it is wrong of him. He could not have stayed in Chelmsford. He has a life and a responsibility to get an education. His parents have responsibility too----they should be keeping better eye on their daughter.
Almost immediately, Sherlock realized he should not have handed that beer to John, as he was well along without it. Obviously, John had tried to bolster his confidence with liquid courage.
John panicked. "Wait!" he said, jumping up as well, tangling his legs a bit in the chair as he stood to block Sherlock's departure.
Previously enrolled at uni few years ago, reading mathematics, never finished. His father is a maths professor at Durham University."
“Right, see you at school.” The line disconnected. John looked sadly at the phone, wishing that had gone better, longer. Wished it'd been anything but a phone call.
John looked at the kid standing before him and sighed. He rubbed his face with his right hand and then rubbed at the back of his neck, trying to determine how to wake himself up. His migraine felt a bit better- the paracetamol did help. This was already way too weird.
John sat back down on the sofa, large bulky plastic bag in his lap. He dropped it down between his legs so it could rest on the floor, bloody heavy for clothes, he thought.
Holidays are coming up. Just a few more days of class, then holiday break. Mary and I are at the pub one last time before I have to start getting ready for end of term. We are sitting in a booth, the table top made of out of imbedded coins-mostly pennies, but I saw one and two pounds and 10, 25 and 50 pence.
At the top of the stairwell John realized he could not continue the chase. No matter how incensed he was at this person, they were long gone.
John wasn’t sure if he could believe the boy sitting across the kitchen table from him, who in the early morning light of the kitchen looked so young. John's head was swimming with questions. "Well, it was my flat."  John mused.  “Sherlock, just how old are you?”
I said and tossed my duvet over him. I was frantic, running back and forth, I shed my coat and I was trying to warm Sherlock's cold hands by rubbing them in mine.
“Well you, of all people know why I’m here, to make connections. You know some of those footballers have families made of money and of course those are the only people I like to hang out with. Can’t say the same about you, though.” Jim raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock was laying on his stomach, head turned toward John. With his eyes closed and face relaxed in sleep, smooth skin and rosy cheeks were almost angelic John thought.
And yet maybe--I could help, somehow. What could I do? None of us could undo the accident, the riot, the badly designed night out for the freshers, designed to make other people money and causing uni students so much misery.
Even more so, John's parents had no idea the part that John and the people he knew in London played in getting Harry hurt in the first place.
"You know, you really shouldn't." she started gently. She took a sip of wine for emphasis, looking at me intently over the rim of the glass.
“I’ll break every bone your body if you do.” came the mumbled reply. John laughed and walked out of the room. With football practice out of the question, John was determined to check on his flatmate every so often today until he was fully conscious. He decided not to call Mycroft. He didn’t know his number anyway.
The boys turned to go. Sherlock realized John still had the shock blanket on and grabbing it off of his shoulders, tossed it directly into the window of the black car.
John, on the phone with Lestrade, sits down on the bed, shocked look on his face. Jim Moriarty dropped all the changes against him.
Sherlock shrugged and leaned in to whisper to john. “Well you are, aren’t you?” Sherlock winked at him and added excitedly, “Hey, guess what--I can have a glass of wine! I’m of age!”
"Mum, I have to leave. I have to get back to London right away." John blurted this out and didn't realize how frantic he sounded.
That's the way the entire night went. I tried to drink plenty of water, the club was sweltering and loud. At times the lights were blinding.
Ian walks over to Jack, the current keeper, to ask the same question he did of John. Jack gives him a sly smile, eyes twinkling. "What? John Waston not interested?"  Jack glances over at John sitting at table, doing shots.
But John reached for me, grabbed my dressing gown, and pulled me into a rougher kiss. He pushed the dressing gown off my shoulders where it pooled on the floor.  "We can move to the bedroom." he says hoarsely, in between kisses. His warm hand palming me through my trousers.
We had been flat mates for about a year. John working part time at the A and E, me working with the police on occasion.
John got out with his single suitcase. Mike headed back to the boot to unload his school trunk, large suitcase and a few boxes of books.
Sherlock left it to The Yard to actually apprehend the killer, leaving with John to get the train to his parent's house.
She looked back at John, who tried unsuccessfully to put on an air of indifference as she gazed accusingly at him.
The curry had been eaten. Remnants of take away cartons set aside.   The residence hall was quiet, most of the kids gone out.  Sitting on his bed, backs against the wall, books on laps. John invited Mary to 'study' in his room on Friday night after dinner.
I find I cannot relax like I see others doing. Relaxing, chatting with friends, laughing. I'm always doing something. I can't sit, I pace.  My mind is always elsewhere. Take the club, for example, ceilings high, walls painted black. Loud, poorly lit, filled with soapy, watery foam and writhing bodies everywhere. I walked around to inspect the set up. Foam machines in four corners of the very large room belched foam from four directions, obscuring the floor. Hazard number one, for drunk students to slip, fall and injure themselves. Obvious.
Watching him walk towards me, his long legs bringing him ever closer, Sherlock looked like he belonged in London. Dark coat, dark jeans and blue tartan scarf 'round his neck, that was thankfully covering what I knew was a bruise--left side, right near his collar bone.
Sherlock had no energy right now to put up a fight with Mike and Molly. They were so chipper when they saw him. They were on their way to the pub and wanted to drag him along. Both Mike and Molly hugged him after they had caught up. Of course they didn't know that John went to hospital to see his sister.  Sherlock had to make something banal up about John just going to see family for the weekend.
"I'm listening now. I wished I listened to you that night. If I had, I wouldn't have to take chemistry over again next term."
I wanted to believe Sherlock,  I really did. But why did I feel such desperate, burning anger? I got up from the bed and threw my track pants on. I know my face was red, my throat constricted. I wasn't able to look at him and I wasn't in the mood for jokes. Jim Moriarty--who he met in the loo
That John Watson, soldier, doctor, reliable and stable, dependable, rational--kind--had decided to take up with me, for any amount of time, was not to be believed.
Something about that night. When I jumped up, I almost knocked my chair over. I reached back to steady it.
Cool air hit him when he opened the last one. Coal cellar? Fine, he thought. I'll sit here and wait until my brain comes back online, or things get worse. What drug could have been in the cider? LSD? MDMA? John sat at the top of the stairway and wasn't sure if he was sad or angry. His heart thumped annoyingly in his chest, almost hurting. Embarrassed then, that was it. He slumped against the wall. He fished his phone out of his pocket. If he could find the door, he'd call a taxi. It would be a fine predicament if he called his sister for help. But then again, who  would understand more?
And there it sat, no bigger than a postage stamp. A tiny origami envelope, likely folded out of a corner of a glossy fashion magazine.
John called his parents to let them know he had reached London safely. No change in Harry, but no worse than before.
"John!!" Sherlock turned to him with a genuinely beaming smile. The flat was a terrible mess, Sherlock stood in the kitchen, bottles, flasks, Bunsen burners and not one, but two microscopes on the kitchen table. Sherlock stood there with safety goggles on, amid the mess--
This does not look much like a jail to him. By this time, almost 10 years on, Mary may have served her time for attempted murder of Sherlock, shooting him at Christmastime, but just grazing his abdomen. John knows she had a trial he was a witness and then after being convicted, she went to jail.
John was holding his head, massaging his temples. "I'm sorry, I...how? I...I can't believe," he looked between Lestrade and me shaking his head. "Are you sure you have the right person? Because Sherlock..."
Sherlock pushed the goggles up onto his forehead and spoke slowly. "No. Well, yes, but I was bored...I don't have a case and I had nothing on and I was waiting for you..." the last part of the sentence trailed off and then he was quiet.
Mary stared at him wide eyed, fork half way to her mouth, as he reached into his pocket to answer it.
Sherlock headed gracefully to the bar, dropping his empty glass at one end and asking the bartender for a new drink at the other.
John continued to watch the car and was surprised when the headlamps blinked on and off. Again. Again. Confused, he got up. He went outside and started to walk towards the car. The car was running, headlamps on, wipers wiping the windows. The patient driver just sitting, waiting.
“My what?” John asks, but the wind whips up and makes it difficult to see. John again has to shield his eyes, and everything goes white.
“Yes, they are superfluous, well, now.” Sherlock stood in the middle of the walkway, hands stuffed in the front pocket of a grey hooded sweatshirt. Just now, the sweat shirt hanging on his slim frame, he looked much younger than his 17 years.
He had his back to me, reaching up and running his hand along the edge of the ceiling and the wall. He had on only my track pants, which were far too big for him in the waist and hung down around his hips. He turned to me. "Sorry," he said looking down. "Couldn't sleep."
He gracefully stepped from the desk to the bed and sat down next to me, legs curled up, knees under his chin. I budged over a bit to let him in. "I'm sure you have a very good reason why you were standing on my desk, feeling the wall."
I have been studying, sitting, reading and visiting doctors this whole term. Where are all of those stories people tell about all the fun they had at uni? When will the fun start?
We walked out of the library and back to the residence hall, slowly. The two of them matching my hobbling pace.  Sherlock mentioned he spoke to the police and a said a little about the investigation. Molly nodded, she seemed satisfied.
"It's fine," Sherlock repeated as he stared into John's eyes and reached up and touched the side of John's face, so close to his own. John breathing above him, quiet, still. John looking at him. His breath smelling a little like alcohol, but Sherlock knew his did, too.  And then he took the side of his thumb and gently traced John’s lower lip. The air in the room was heavy and quiet. Sherlock realized he was holding his breath.
And it turns out, the infernal device had caused some kind of irritation on the outside of my leg. I won't give anyone the satisfaction of complaining about it, either, even though it stung like hell.
John moved forward again until they were very close. He looked at Sherlock’s eyes in the dim light of the sitting room, which had a silver cast. John reached out and touched Sherlock on the thigh and he gave a small gasp.
His restless mind-- thoughts always churning, nights spent awake, pacing the floor, not able to sleep. Last night was the first night he slept in? he can’t remember. The balm of John on his restless soul. Could he stay away from drugs? If he kept busy, had things to do and John,  that just may be enough to tame his wild thoughts.
When he did show up, he seemed nervous, checking his watch or glancing at the clock on the wall the entire time.
Sherlock flattened himself against the wall. Glancing sideways and holding his breath, he tried not to move the window curtains as he watched John leave. He could see John say something to his brother before getting into the black sedan, but couldn’t make out what it was. Knowing John, it was most likely another ‘thanks’.
It was looking like I'd have to take it again next term. It was also looking like this whole term was a waste of time and money. I felt bad for my mum, mostly. Widowed, working long hours to help me with school and here I was, just taking up space.
"Whatever is that?" Asks the new employee, pointing at the screen. The grainy shot that they are viewing shows a tiny black and white clip, repeated over and over. /p>
But his thoughts then turn sour, he knows what night this is. This is the night before he gets shot.
Mycroft cleared his throat, “I’m afraid I am the bearer of some bad news. You sister Harriet is in hospital. An overdose, I’m afraid.”
Up until now, John was just sitting there.  "Would someone like to tell me what's going on?"  he said in a small voice.
Sherlock turns over and stares at the ceiling-- calculating. He knows he has to be careful with John not to make a wrong move that would completely scare him off. To do just what he wants, to keep him and not to lose him.
They arrived back at the flat and realized Mike was not home. John flopped on to the sofa and laid there with his eyes closed.
It's my intention to separate. Now. This will be it, then. We can stop this farce of 'studying'. I'm sure Lestrade will call and let me know what the next steps are. For me.
"Lets have a look, then." Requests the supervisor, walking around holding a clipboard and inspecting over everyone's shoulders.
It's Liz--Mike's girlfriend, standing at the edge of the kitchen with her hands on her hips, staring at them. She seems unsteady on her feet. Both boys freeze. Sherlock whips his head 'round to glare at her.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
There's a little hollow right where his collar bone meets the front part of his neck, under that is the scalene muscle. I shivered and thought of Molly. I looked down at my shoes, shoving my hands deep into my pockets. I didn't want him to catch me staring.
Sherlock asks raising his voice slightly, no longer leaning on the door. He stands in front of John at the edge of the sitting room and kitchen.
After John left, Sherlock was alone and flopped about the flat like a fish out of water.  He tossed himself on the sofa, sat in all the chairs and threw himself on the bed. To no avail, he could not quiet his mind from worry about John.
But John wasn't laughing, he looked serious. He looked down at Sherlock and they both got quiet. Just breathing, just looking at each other.
"Bloody hell. I don't know." I lifted his eyelids and flashed the torch at his eyes, his pupils were very small.  999 sounded about right. I walked over to the phone on the wall.
Sherlock said, slowly placing the metal piece on the table, getting up to search for a plasticine bag.
The ringing phone brought me out of my reverie. Mycroft again, I'm sure. "What?" is my usual way of answering him.
About Jim mostly. John crossed streets with barely a look at traffic. His head was spinning with things to ask Sherlock. John was forced at one point to stop and wait for cars to pass. As he stood there, catching his breath, he hoped Sherlock was actually at the flat. Not only did John want to discuss Jim and maybe Molly...., he also wanted to bring up some more mundane topics, one that may make Sherlock angry. Too many things. John sighed.
An exhausted Dr. John H Watson sloggs through  the wet streets of London. The sun has already set, making it much darker than it should be.  A few days before Christmas and a long shift at the A & E, John was just glad to be walking away from chaos for a few days. He left his briefcase in the office, not planing at all to catch up on any extra reading. The impending holiday had made his night at the A & E a busy one, with a case of child abuse and sick newborn, amongst the broken bones, sniffles and fevers.
He looked up but not at me. "Yes, let's go." He drained his pint in one gulp and stood, grabbing his coat.
She turned to face me. "Oh, John!!" she cried and threw herself around my neck in a big hug and continued to sob, rather loudly.
"Thanks." I opened it and poured some into my hand. John reached for the bottle and poured some into his own hand. I rubbed my hands together so it warmed. John followed my lead.
Sherlock downed the rest of the beer. John decided there was no point in being impatient, Sherlock'd talk when he was ready. So he sat there, trying not to stare at Sherlock with the fury he felt.
He could hear the floor boards in the next room creaking and he knew this was John--pacing.  The floors creaked approximately every 12.5 seconds--indicating John was arguing with himself and walking back and forth in the room.
I think the antibiotics are helping. Every time I look at it, it's less red. He seems to have less pain too. I'm surprised that his legs are so muscular. As I changed the dressing I was reminded of how he tackled me to the ground that night at the pub. I felt like I was hit by a lorry.
“Ok, let’s go then.” Get this over with, he thinks. John swings his feet off the bed and reaches for his trainers.
"I hope so--" John started and then the flat door opened with such force, it slammed into the opposite wall. The boys jumped and turned toward the door.
John walked up to the car, just as the driver rolled down the drivers side window. John bent over a bit to look at the driver.
Jim. John had to admit, he didn’t know Jim very well. The people he hung out with were known to be the well-traveled, well-heeled posh types. People John did not know. John had heard a few rumors about drugs, but he was not certain that they weren’t just rumors, until last night.
He kept hounding me, I begrudgingly relented. He changed the dressing with gloves and a very professional manner, but sat
I could leave the flat and and wander the streets until my head cleared.  I hit the loo and walked into the kitchen for water. I stepped half way into the kitchen when I realized that John was asleep on the sofa. He had fallen asleep in his clothes.
Back in my room. Sat on the bed, I think about what I can offer him, I have no drinks or food in my room.
John fell face first onto the sofa as Sherlock went to fetch the duvet. He dumped the duvet and pillows onto him as he lay there. John stirred and sat up.
I freeze. This could be a deterrent. "What's the price?" I look over at him. I could get up and walk away now. Nothing lost.
"Obviously, I'm at your mercy, Lestrade. I'm relying on you to tell me my options." voice calm and not shaking at all.
Sherlock peeked out under his heavy dark lashes and looked at her skeptically. "How could you tell?"
John closed his eyes as the room began to swirl the tiniest bit. He took a deep breath and answered, "The normal one, I reckon, I'm fine. Fun party, see you later, Mary." and walked away from them into the fog. Panicking, he wanted to get out right then, but couldn't remember where the door was.
“Mary, Mary! Don’t be so mad! It’s nice to see you!” John was feeling a little drunker than three beers should have made him, when he realized he didn’t eat any dinner.
"What?" he smiled and brushed my hands away. "You can't possibly want me to stop. Do you?" he reached around my waist again and kissed me along the side of my neck. His face was buried in my neck, hot kisses trailing on my skin. His hands pulling my shirt out of my jeans and making contact with the bare skin of my back.
Tonight's a 'foam party'. Not sure what that is.  I had pizza with the football club earlier today. They'll be at the 'foam party' too. I'm not committing to any societies or clubs yet. I like rugby, too.
Sherlock was laying in his bed watching the shadows play on the walls of his bedroom. He would not sleep tonight.  Not after what happened in the sitting room.  John Watson, calm, intelligent John, had set his imagination on fire. Not to mention his lips. He put his finger to his lips and couldn’t believe John’s lips had just been there.
Sherlock got up and walked slowly over to his button down that was carefully tossed over a chair in the corner of the room.
I doubt we can remain friends. After he serves his 'sentence' with me, I can be on my way, to trouble him no more. Better that way, really.
“Right. Of course.” Said John, getting out. Standing on the kerb, he shoved his hands in his pockets as if looking for money for a tip.
When the doctor put his hand on his shoulder, John felt very small. He felt powerless to battle his sister's monsters, especially if she would not try.
And John got stuck there, in Sherlock’s gaze, and the room got quiet, just the two of them, distant noises of cars on the street and a few birds chirping in trees near the house.
These thoughts disappear as the pads of Sherlock's long fingers determinedly find the waistband of his pants and trace the elastic edge. John's stomach quivers and his legs are hurting. Sherlock sucks on John's tongue and bites at the tip ever so lightly.
John, Sherlock and Mike were of no help when interviewed by police. An ambulance took Mike to hospital.
Mike was wise not to answer. He had never seen John angry.  His eyes were steel grey and serious. His jaw was set.  When John got angry he got quiet. Right before he erupted.
“That settles it, then. Flats don’t blow up every day. It’ll be my treat. let's go." Sherlock offered his hand and helped John up.
And I could only just lay there, spent and shaking as John held me. Somewhere in my mind palace and old sea chest opened up and I promised myself that I'd make him feel as worshipped as he had me.
He backed up and thought he did a pretty good job of writing "MYCROFT HOLMES" across the parking lot in the snow.

John walks through the party, the guests unaware of his presence. In the front sitting room, the one with the big Christmas tree,  John sees a very pretty woman talking to Mrs. Holmes. The woman is holding a baby girl—in a frilly Christmas dress.
He was sitting now on the edge of the bed, head down. Wednesday night in the residence hall was very quiet.
"I have fun with you too, John.” Sherlock said quietly, looking down at John’s foot so close to his leg.
He didn’t feel sorted, he didn’t feel calm and he didn’t feel happy. All he knew was he could not stop thinking about Sherlock Holmes.
Mrs. Watson nodded, "He was instrumental in bringing Jim Moriarty to justice, for us and Harry." he mother said quietly.
I reluctantly tore my eyes away from the page and frowned. "Erm.." John was already in the kitchen and back with two fingers of whisky. He handed me the glass. He never gave me a chance to answer.
She whispered in my ear after she handed me mine. Her breath tickled my earlobe, her perfume a little too strong.
Mary likes me. She stands a little too close to me and licks her lips. Whenever we're together, Mary circles me like a shark.
I wasn't responsible for bringing Victor's father down. As a mater of fact, Victor and I both became fallout of the demise of his father's 'business'.
Last night John had the best time he ever had in his life. He never thought he’d be so happy, he never thought he’d…be happy like this. With another bloke. He always thought of his sister as ‘the gay one’ and he was ‘the not gay one’. Ok-what does that mean? He’s not entirely gay—so he’s dated girls up ‘til now—but he’s  not entirely ‘not gay’ either—because he’s with Sherlock and that’s just---wonderful. Really wonderful. And that’s fine.
They chatted about the weather and exams and when they were almost parting ways, Molly paused and then just very directly asked for clarification of his relationship with Sherlock. John didn’t like being backed into a corner and hesitated to admit to anything, but Molly encouraged him to speak.
He was smiling, "Sorry to keep you waiting, I'm Sherlock..." he offered his hand, but John didn't take it. "...Holmes." he said as he slowly lowered his hand.  "I know I owe you an explanation." he offered a little more soberly.
Maybe he just should have never gone to the flat party with Mike last year, then he would not have met John. Damn Stamford and his ‘friends’. What’s the point? People always disappoint you, anyway. John was involved when he met him, why should he think John would walk away from his life just to be with Sherlock?
John sits up, seeing a flickering movement at the foot of the bed.  He can’t believe his eyes. This night can’t get any worse. Terrified at the apparition, his voice is hoarse as he tentatively asks,
Momentarily confused, I'm frowning. "John I..." Now I can read him. I may be a little slower than usual tonight, but he's looking at me with a predatory gaze, and touching the side of my face with his right hand. It's quieter than ever in the flat, the air heavy, as time is suspended and my head is spinning, I can hear the crackling of the fire behind him.
Sherlock sat next to John who was wondering why he was so flippant with the detective. “You are completely wasting our time, detective, we don’t have any information about this explosion.  And why do I have this blanket on?” he said as he removed the blanket provided by the medics.
John anxiously stood at Mycroft's elbow for the length of the phone call with a cold, clawing feeling in his stomach. It was difficult to believe that there could be a possible connection between Jim Moriarty and what happened to his sister.
"And why would you be a fan of mine?" I was now between him and the door. On my way out, but now curious.
John fell asleep of course. The stress of the day and the recent physical exertion taking it's toll. When he woke, he turned to see Sherlock asleep as well, his breathing even and quiet. Little did John know that Sherlock didn't sleep the last two nights anticipating John's return to London.
In a big pack, the footballers descended on the local pub. Dark and narrow, it was loaded with uni students--wall to wall. The team found an open area downstairs, it was cooler there, too.
They walked up to the second floor and went into the flat. Sherlock made a beeline for the fridge and opened a beer.
Jim was now sitting on the floor, rubbing his jaw and laughing, his mouth a sneer. “No, it’s ok Mary, I’m fine. I guess chivalry is not dead.”
"Johnny! Thanks for finding my present!" she said, happiness back in her voice. "But what about yours?" she asked, concerned he had no present to open on Christmas day.
It took a few days of despair at school before I wound up on Mycroft's doorstep. It was early evening when he opened the door himself, housekeeper out, apparently. It's difficult to surprise my brother. He stood in the doorway, shirttails out of his trousers and glass of gin in hand. One arched eyebrow betrayed the shock he felt.
“What?” Sherlock's eyes were blank and cloudy, not giving anything away. He should’ve been an actor, thought John.
He wouldn't look up at me. I started to apologize, but it was too late. After he left, I sat on the bed, hating myself. I jumped up and took off after him, but couldn't find him on the street. I was afraid to show up at his school, so I went back to the residence hall.
It took me a bloody 20 minutes to drag Sherlock to the residence hall. He could stand and walk, but his gait was unsteady.  He was slow and uncoordinated, so unlike the person he was usually, with me trotting at his side.
"Sherlock, maybe tomorrow, you'd explain, the rest, about why...or what you were looking for at the party. I could have helped maybe-- if you'd let me. Well, if I hadn't...or... didn't, well..." John shrugged. He thought Sherlock was looking at him funny. Staring. Quiet.
She gave him a look back of sweet, calm confusion and put her hand over the mouth piece of the telephone. Mrs. Watson started to speak in a stage whisper.
John looked out into the hallway to see a disheveled  teen sitting in the hallway chairs, long legs stretched out in front of him, crossed at the ankles. He was slumped in his chair, head against the wall, eyes closed, relaxed, with his hands stuffed in the front pocket of his hoodie.
I walked past a silent, empty fountain with wet, frozen feet. The snow was slowing. I was just ready to turn back when I saw him. My heart fell like a rock into my frozen wet shoes.
John remembers that Christmas eve, the church service, the walk home and the first time he kissed Sherlock Holmes in a snow bank, right after he pelted him with a snowball.
“Don’t be daft-- I’m giving it back. I just wanted to have a few hours with it before they can muck it up.”
"Nice address John, who do you know?" Sherlock's voice was a low whisper in his ear as the door swing open and they were ushered in.
“No, I was hoping, maybe you’d come to see the game.” As John's voice got a little strength, he moved a little closer and touched Sherlock on the back of the hand with one finger.
The loo was a respite from John's intense scrutiny. It was cooler in there for a moment. When I came out, Mary was sitting with John, hugging his arm--looking up at him and batting her
Sherlock did recall a few fortunate meetings with Jim last term, but dread filled his heart at what he was entertaining right now.
In the pitch black of the small kitchen, two hearts are beating furiously. John momentarily forgets where he is as Sherlock's tongue swirls around his. He's sure he's being deprived of oxygen as he giddily pulls Sherlock closer, rubbing both of his hands up and down his long smooth back. John briefly wonders for just one quick moment--how assured and adept Sherlock is at this. As young as he is, he is no doubt John's best lover, of all the girls he snogged and got into bed-- and now Sherlock, he beats everyone, hands down.
She left us at the front of the residence hall, she had an evening class. "Bye, Sherlock." Molly waved at him shyly, still blushing. She didn't say 'bye' to me.
"One would think that his lover would know he was left handed," Sherlock stood up and glanced down at the body.
I saw Mary again, she introduced me to her friend Jim. Mary was smiling from ear to ear and said something about Ibiza.
“….to ruin it. Because I’m happy.” Things were quiet for a minute or two. Sherlock thought John fell asleep, but he continued, “I’m happy here with you…and I love…being with you.”
With no alternative, I made my way down the hallway, sidestepping the balls, cricket bats and cricketers that littered the corridor.
There were not many people left in the pub, it was late. No one noticed him come in--at first. No one looked towards the door, except John, who sat there gaping.
"Pardon me, I have something to take care of," he said in a distant voice, staring down at Jim and walking away from the group. Jim smirked at the table and followed steady on his heels. Sherlock made purposeful strides all the way to the bar and ordered another pint.
John and Sherlock surprisingly had no confrontations with Jim Moriarty. It didn't matter that Sherlock was expecting it, round every corner, but it never came. As a matter of fact, they hadn’t seen him around the campus at all. With no words and no sightings, John was sure Jim had left uni.
But the lights never went back on as John expected them to. They stayed off and the room took on a dull, foggy gleam. The music changed, too. Gone was the jumpy pop he heard from the street. The music was loud, throbbing and electronic. John looked over at Mary and her teeth were glowing bright white against her blue shiny lips in the foggy, misty room.
"John!!" Mary opened my door, I never lock it. She came in with a big smile and a bigger bottle of Sambuca. Mike and Molly budged over to make room for Mary on my bed.
Crossing the room to the window, he saw a shadow out of the corner of his eye and jumped and turned. Heart hammering in his chest, he realized that there was a small person--a kid-- in the room. John was shocked, outraged and mortified. 'Jesus Christ!' he said, "Who the hell are you and how did you get in here?"
John  pulls away to speak, “Sherlock, um… Mike reminded me before he left--that there is a welcome back football party--yeah, I forgot. And I should go and of course you’re welcome to come too.” John hesitatingly said.
"How many of us do?"   John chuckled. "if you want this fixed, you are going to have to show it to me."
John sat there deliberating. How was he going to get out of this? Gracefully. ‘Just say no’ and all that. He looked down into this beer, the small bubbles in the foam had disappeared and there was not much beer left in the glass. John could polish it off with one big gulp, of course, but he was stalling for time.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Older John Watson can't help but laugh and the secretive planning going on. Despite all the hardships and difficulties during the tours in Afghanistan, the soldiers made time to have some fun. Tonight's party will be a good one.
John sat up a  bit in his chair. "The Best. The bravest, kindest, wisest person I have ever had the good fortune to know."
John feels dizzy. They need to lie down. John feels desperate to find a hard surface to push Sherlock into. He's aching and he's starting to sweat and he sure he's going to come with a convulsion right here, right now and
Halfway into my pint, the pub got even more crowded, if that was possible. There were more people standing, milling about. I looked toward the door, more people coming in.
“Wow, you sorted all that since last night?” John sat back down, head swimming. He didn’t realize Sherlock did not sleep.
"That's my house. My house growing up." John hung his head, his heart giving a bit of an old remembered ache. So many bad memories here. So easy to be maudlin at Christmas time. How much had he to drink at dinner? How bad can this dream get?
Brain reeling, trying to formulate something to say, John looked up and saw movement from far down the street.
Sherlock stopped abruptly, interrupted by a thought. He glanced at John. "Since you're so keen--want to come with me?”
Sherlock was up and pulling on clothes when I got back. "I should go," he said softly, glancing over his shoulder at me. I walked up to him and wrapped my arms around his waist from behind.
Mike, who witnessed this exchange from the kitchen, tiptoed softly towards the door, opened it quietly and left the flat.
"What about parents or...a family or a home?" Mrs. Hudson didn't ask questions--apparently, how could she not know?
I pretended not to hear her because I'm a berk. I looked down at the menu, cheeks pink. "Oh I see," I said trying to recover gracelessly. "Not beer--white wine I guess."
I reached for the vest that I had on before and pulled it on. "Why would you do something like this? You know how much
John's shoulders slumped, "It's alright, we can go." John knew his search could be fruitless, but wanted to try. He had to.
or something. Men, women--I seem to draw them all. I just frown at them and walk away. I don't even want to insult anyone anymore.
"Oh,  I see," he's reading me like a fuckin' book, "Daddy wouldn't let you, would he?" he whispered.
Putting his key in the lock and turning the knob,  he was met in the front hallway by a frantic looking older woman. Mrs. Hudson the landlady, looked relived to see him, "Oh John! Just the person! I'm so glad you're home!  But I-- I wanted to warn you..." she whispers hesitantly, looking over her shoulder towards the stairs to the floor above.
The boys walked slowly back to the flat. The night was warm for January and they chatted all the way, Sherlock expanding on some of his theories about the case he was working on with Lestrade.
John's demeanor had completely changed, gone was the angry young man who just wanted answers and and maybe a brawl. "I... I want to help. Can I? How can I help?" his eyes were pleading, searching as he looked up at Sherlock--a good head taller than him, looking down at him with a mixture of confusion and maybe a little pity.
Sherlock was right about being followed--it just wasn't the person he suspected. It wasn't Jim, it was Mary.   I remember Sherlock standing on my desk, feeling the wall, saying: "I feel like Jim Moriarty is following me--watching me."
I walked up to them and looked over the railing. The entire place was a sea of foam, laser lights and writhing bodies.
John was sitting at the top of the stairs of the coal cellar in the pitch black. He kept his eyes closed, watching small lights behind his lids swirl and jump, leaving little trails behind. It was blessedly cool and quiet as the party thumped along on the other side of the cellar door.
Towards the end of the term, John was in the library writing a paper. He had been there for hours, sitting quietly at a table. The library was bustling with students getting ready for exams.  About halfway through his paper, he felt his heart quicken suddenly. He started to feel cold and achy, as though he was coming down with something. Maybe he was getting a fever.
Sherlock leaned forward and kissed John on the lips, gently, tentatively. John moved forward slightly and his hand started to wander from Sherlock’s thigh to his waist, where he pulled half of his shirt out of his trousers in an attempt to find the soft warm skin of his back.
"I was John--this was in the back. In the back--placed in a file, in a separate room, on the back burner. In the back of my mind."
John looks around as the guests are welcomed in. He can see Mrs. Holmes and Mycroft, laughing and smiling. Various aunt and uncles that John had recognized from years past. And a few young children running about. Who do these children belong to?
I turned and could only stare at this point. My head swam and I tried to look though the foam to see who it was. The whole of Fresher's Week, no one said a thing. Not even Mary, who was attached to my hip.
The boys barrel past, almost knocking into him. John side steps them before realizing he does not have to, he is not really here.
John was eager. They had waited so long. He tried to be restrained. Sherlock leaned further back, his hands wandering inside John's football jersey, pulling him closer. John pulled his left knee up and slightly kneeling, strained against him.
John opened his mouth a bit more and Sherlock slid the tip of his tongue along John's bottom lip. Sherlock held the back of John's head with his left hand, keeping him close,  desperate to touch more of  John's soft hot tongue with his own.   Sherlock could feel his whole body catch fire and his right hand started to wander down John's back, finding the waist of his blue jeans.  With John's leg in between his own, he arched his back involuntarily trying to get more contact.
This next room was different, but not by much. A little cleaner maybe and no people laying on the floor. Right in front of the hearth, was a chair, as if drawn up by the fire, but there was no fire today, the grate was cold.
John reached up to bury his left hand in the soft dark curls behind Sherlock's head, straining a bit to get to his full height to deepen their kiss.
Most of the students just ignored me, not wanting my observations to ruin a perfectly great night of Fresher's Week.
I  had placed a piece of sello tape over the latch before I left. The reentry wasn't as elegant as the exit.  I removed the tape before I slipped up the back staircase and back to my room.
Sherlock was vaguely aware that Jim was babbling away at his side, but he wasn't interested in anything Jim had to say. What he desperately needed was a distraction from worry about John. A few hours of reprieve for his brain. The snow started to fall a little heavier. He realized he didn't know exactly where they were going.
He was talking when I leaned over to kiss him. I slid a little closer so were touching. Lips, arms, thighs. I close my eyes. I don't know what he wants, so I do what I always do, Sit up a bit, lean on him,  encouraging him to lay back. But he won't have it, he pushes back. He gets up--kneeling on the bed and reaches both of his hands under my vest, to touch my stomach. The abruptness makes me gasp. I haven't been touched in a while.
She looks from one boy to the other, pulling her dressing gown tighter around her. "Fine, then. Maybe a dressing gown next time, Sherlock dear."
The booth was along the back wall and Sherlock was sitting at an angle to me at the edge of the booth, I could see his long legs under the table. A server came to deliver our order. I just had chips and a pint. Mary ordered that biscuit thing that look a monstrosity and a glass of white wine.
"I want you to know that you can come to me for anything. I mean anything." He snorts a line of the new powder and slides the mirror to me again. "You won't regret this."
There was no one in the library now, everyone was at dinner. I made to get my books together, but I was struggling. Bag, books, crutches, cast, chair. I was a mess.
Jim reappeared with three drinks and slid into the booth on the other side of Sherlock. He was pinned in.
His trouser leg was gathered up around his thigh as he sat on my bed. I couldn't help noticing the long hard muscles of his legs, as I applied the cream to his wound. I noticed how defined they were as I wrapped gauze around his ankle. His leg was bent at the knee, foot resting on the bed.
John paced the floor, agitated. His brain was on fire. John could not believe he belted Jim Moriarty in a pub in front of loads of people. He left Mary in the pub to chase after his flatmate all through the snowy streets of university.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
He seemed nervous, in a rush all of a sudden. "I have to go, really. Maybe I can meet you in the library. How about tomorrow?"
"Oh no! Removed, actually--just removed, But quite on accident, of course. Inadvertent. Unintentional and unfortunate." Sherlock was very, very serious.
It was dinnertime, John's entire family was home. There was no way he and Sherlock could have any kind of real conversation. He tried to walk the phone as far away from the family as he could to have some degree of privacy.
happy to be home. Don't be mad at me, John." Sherlock's hands were now feeling his way up John's hard muscled back and moving, moving up to his chest and then down to his stomach again, hands so warm and strong and determined. All the while, he was kissing along the edge of John's neck and rocking himself against John's backside. Lightly, then a bit harder.
“...this all yours, then? It's nice.” John walked into the flat and looked around the large front room.
"That's probably not the reason." Sherlock interrupts him, voice cold. "I actually don't know why you like me."
“My god, it’s fine, really.”  Sherlock whispered, kissing John, looking John directly in his heavy lidded eyes. He half sat up amid the pile of rubble that they were laying in, not wanting it to stop, and wanting to prove to John that it was indeed, fine.
Jim was at Sherlock's elbow in an instant and pulled out a wad of cash and insisted on paying for both of their drinks. Sherlock sighed and let him.
Out of the corner of his eye, he glimpsed 3 of the council house kids from the quad walking quickly down the street.
I hurried back to my room. I picked up the phone to dial my brother. "Mycroft, I need you to tell me anything you know about a uni student named
I put the mug on the floor and looped my right arm around his. I reached my left hand to touch the side of his face and kissed him.
By the time Sherlock gets back to bed, John is fast asleep. As the early morning light creeps in to the bedroom, Sherlock gets back in bed, pulling the blankets up around them both and curling himself around John.
In a shocking twist, I'm the most popular bloke at school, it seems. I can't go a moment without someone knocking on my door. My phone rings constantly. Classmates are asking to study with me, go to the library or to get coffee. It's unnerving.
Moriarty pouted. "Oh, I'd never leave John out. I think you two are a package deal, if I'm correct."
John was silent. He didn't know what he expected. A fleet? A car and driver? A helicopter? He was just happy to see Mycroft.  He didn't know how far this would get him, but it was something.
Sherlock sees Jim, Jim offers him cocaine in a back room and Sherlock finds the temptation too much?
John had no push back in him. He looked at Mary and sighed. When do you let friends know your secrets? Is there ever a good time to drop these bombs? Can they be scheduled for better circumstances?
Teen John was gone for about 10 minutes. When he got back, Harry was sitting on the floor, apparently tired of just standing there, but still had her hands over her eyes. John could hear his father snoring.
Harriet Watson was younger than her brother John, but she was no fool. John's parents may not think twice about the phone call, but his sister would listen carefully, mull over the event and note any inconsistencies in John's behavior or tone.   He looked over at his sister. She had been through a lot in her young life and John knew she still had quite a few secrets, herself.
"I'm leaving." I stood up. I'm high now, but not so high that I don't understand his meaning. I'm high enough that I wouldn't consider this night ill spent.
Before Sherlock could turn and take a breath, Irene Adler was at his side. "I'm surprised to see you, darling. However did he get you to come?"" she purred in his ear, her white teeth shining in the dark. She helped him slip off his coat. Irene was dressed to the nines and looked right at home at this fancy club, with her tight dress and high heeled shoes.
“Oh sorry-- what was it?” John found it difficult to turn his head away from the front of the pub and towards Mary.
There she is, visible at the foot of the bed. Dressing gown tied at her waist. Arms crossed over her chest, staring right at him, looking indignant.
I went home with a splitting headache. It was just Lestrade and me in the car for the last part of the trip.
As it turns out, I found the only interesting sentence in the whole of the article, so I didn't look up until he was sitting in his chair, opposite me. He flopped down in the chair and hurriedly toed off his shoes.
Walking to meet John, my thoughts turned back to Moriarty. Who was he? He wasn't a student and he didn't work at university. Why was he hanging around there?
I've gone to the pub a few times--alone-. I remember that they tell you to not go to pubs when you're in recovery. It's a gateway, they say. Mycroft accuses me of not reading the literature they give you, but I did.
I was doing well on the chemistry equations. It was taking much less time to get a full page done now.
Opening his eyes he sees the curtains billowing out into the room. He turns his head left and right fearful of what type of new companion will show up.
"He has a brother--wait-- how do you know anything about Sherlock? And the family he has or doesn't have?"
John sat on the worn lobby sofa waiting, but he was not sure what he was waiting for. He was grateful for the warmth, but his clothes were not drying fast enough. His socks were wet inside his trainers.
John did not mean to take his parents by surprise, but  he did just that when he appeared in the doorway of the family waiting room.
"Sherlock, is it? Nice to meet you. John has told me lots about you." She shook his hand with a smile as they loaded the suitcases into the boot.
I looked over at Jim, he was still smiling. He looked very far away, as if at the end of a long tunnel. I have to get out of here. I managed to stand, lurching, I'm sure. I left the room, found my coat and made my way outside to the snowy street. I had to lean on the brick building until I was sure I wouldn't fall. I should be cold, but I was warm. My legs didn't want to walk, but they were moving, finally.
a few minutes. Despite Sherlock’s demands, Mike insisted on stopping by this party for a quick drink before taking him there.
He shrugged. "He talks lots about school." Jim's cheeks were a high pink. "Anyways, that something I gave you there, hope you like it. And my number, of course, again."
Mike Stamford had been keeping his eye on Sherlock and Jim the entire time. He wasn't so far into his cups as to realize that Sherlock Holmes spending time willingly with Jim Moriarty, notorious drug dealer on campus, was not a good idea.
In a cold sweat, John wakes up to find Sherlock had tossed his arm over John’s chest. The sun showing tiny pink rays through the curtains. Sherlock opens his eyes and looks at John,  “Are you alright, John? You tossed and turned all night, mumbling in your sleep.”
John jumped up and stood at the side of the bed, hand on his forehead. He couldn't look Sherlock in the eye. "Christ!-I should call my mum and let her know I arrived at school ok. Let’s come up with a plan for after I get some things done, ok?"
John just looked blankly at him. Of course, they had just met this evening, John not knowing anything really about the tall young man standing beside him.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
“Yes. Of course, I'm not right all the time, just most of the time. I plan to return it to them today, actually---."
"It's simple, I was losing my mind." Honestly, while not always the best policy, is often expedient.
Sherlock walked over to him. "Of course, I guess now we're even, then." he whispered, looking down at john, standing there, looking rather small.
"Hi, I'm Johnny." said the kid, who did not look at all unhappy or confused or ill at ease to be there.
Most of the girls were wearing swimsuits and the blokes had already taken their shirts off. The place was mad.
Sherlock wanted to avoid looking in Jim's eyes, so as to not give himself away, so he took a long drink from the offensive beer cup to camouflage his discomfort. He couldn't buy cocaine anyway, he brought no money with him tonight, on purpose. "John's not my boyfriend." He said quietly and walked away.
John laughed. He could feel a pounding headache starting. “I’m…going…to need some time. I…I think. It’s not you. I don’t even know what’s going on in my head anymore. Sherlock really, I don’t know about you, but this is all new to me.”
I made note cards. I highlighted notes in different colors. Molly quizzed me and we studied together. My marks in all of my classes were abysmal, but by far the worst class was chemistry.
“Precisely. There was a smaller explosion before the larger one that took out the flat. The party being so loud, no one heard it. The smaller explosion sent this piece of shrapnel through the open window, hitting Mike in the back of the head, knocking him flat.”
"I thought you were thinking about darts and chips and that long winded chemistry problem and maybe...me."
And whether or not you’ll remember it tomorrow. It’s over. It’s ok. I think I know what’s going on." She spoke very close to his face, looking directly into his eyes.
I have a meeting with Lestrade that I can't miss. I can make it to NSY from the Baker Street Underground Station in about 15 minutes. I smoked a quick cigarette and felt a tinge of guilt knowing John would disapprove.
I looked from Molly to Sherlock and back again. She was practically scolding him and he was uncomfortable.
John stopped. He looked at his parents. They looked much older than when he left them at Christmas time. Worried. Smaller, frail almost.
Bright moonlight was shining through my window. His skin glowed, his dark hair a contrast to how pale he was. His arm was over the duvet, slim neck and muscular shoulder visible. He stirred when I sat up.
John was lucky he heard the key in the lock. Luckily, it was a loud metal mechanism, that caused the wooden door to creak and stick and resist as it was opened.
“No really, it’s fine—I’ve known all along....really and I won’t tell anyone. But if I were you--I’d call Mary, I wanted to tell you earlier--she called yesterday, and she sounded angry, so call her and…well…the rest,  that’s none of my business. Just call her, won’t you?”
"John, doesn't Sherlock have family? Parents?" Molly asked gently. I looked over at her and immediately had a thought.
He kissed me back, opening his lips slightly, moving his warm hands up and down my back. I forgot what I was going to say. Thoughts and words that I once had in my brain are now gone.
He gently and slowly placed his empty glass on the table beside his chair. As he sat up straight, he slid forward to the edge of his chair, balancing himself there for a moment. I assumed he was going to get up and head to bed, but he stared at me, his face resolute.
Once there, they locked the bedroom door, "See? Two doors, no one to bother us." John gently reassured Sherlock.
John had stubbornly refused to move in with Sherlock, even though it was the thing he wanted most in all the world.
The owner put a candle on the table, my mind was spinning. I expected that there would be more to this, like we'd be banned from pubs or restaurants or
John stretches out longwise on the bed stretches all his muscles. He lets out a groan. Moonlight pours through the window in the bedroom. The boys are lying on their backs, staring at the ceiling.
“No really,” she explained, clearing her throat, “I want to know, because he’s my friend and I care about him.”
I spent the night in hospital and the next day,  Mary, Mike and Molly showed up with the newspaper. The hospital called my mum and she came right away to see me. I tried to explain what happened as she cried at the side of the bed, but most of it I didn't remember. Mum was worried and angry, but I promised her that I didn't feel as bad as I looked. They let me go the day after.
The change was startling and concerning. It coincided with running into Seb on the way home from the pub that night.
Sherlock was surprised. Who was Jim Moriarty's father? Would Mycroft know? They slipped inside after Jim was recognized by the bouncer at the door. No one asked Sherlock for his ID. Even though he was of age, he was asked to show his ID often, because even though he was very tall, he was slim and looked very young. He tried not to look surprised, but took it in stride.
For example, Mike Stamford was pretty straightforward, he was happy with his girl friend and his job. One day Mike would work at a hospital, Sherlock thought. Doctor? Maybe. Molly? There was another one. Sherlock could imagine Molly as a happy wife and mother, albeit working in a lab. Her clinical skills were sharp. Dissecting cadavers during the week, and baking pies on Saturdays.
“Some experiment, I was ready to beat the hell out of you. Who were the other two blokes?” Recovering, John stood up and wiped his mouth with his sleeve.
Jim patted the pocket of Sherlock’s coat, as if to settle what he had placed. And then it hit John like a bolt. The small paper envelope. Sherlock out all night, coming in at all hours. Wasted, quiet, distant—eyes glazed over.
I stood up and looked down at my shoes, cheeks hot. "Sorry, I--"  I took a step toward him and stopped, not wanting to get too close. I'm never sure of myself. He'd have to come the rest of the way.
Walking round back near the bins and pushing the flat head against the strike plate, Sherlock popped the door open. Not even a squeak. So easy it was laughable. Child’s play.
In the light of the sitting room, John could now see the black and blue area on Sherlock's left cheek bone and near his eye. It was slightly swollen.
“Stay with me.” Sherlock said, very quietly, still laying on his stomach, arms holding onto the pillow. His arm was in front of his face and he was practically talking into this bicep, John could just see his eyes.
"Watson!" he turns abruptly to his name, but no, they don't mean him. They mean that lad over there--that young medic.
As John looked up to respond to this, he saw that Sherlock was handling a piece of metal the size of deck of cards. As he turned it over in his hands, he held it carefully with a handkerchief.
I'm glad Sherlock decided to come along. I'm not sure he eats really, so when I'm with him I try to offer him food. The pub has chips. I know he'll eat chips.
Mycroft says I'm a piss poor billiard player. He always beats me. I should have let John win, but my competitive side kicked in. I drank too fast and was already feeing the alcohol. I had to go to the loo.
The booth went quiet, Mike, Molly and Liz starred into their pints. This was very unfortunate. Sherlock threw his head back and drained what was left of his beer in one gulp.
Not wanting to stand out, he wore the most boring clothes he had, and tossed on an old jacket from the back of his wardrobe. He wanted to go unnoticed.
John sat next to me in an obviously uncomfortable new suit and tie and shot me concerned looks every so often. I couldn't look at him. I stared at my shoes, face red. He is much too nice to me.  He can't help it.
I wasn't awake and I wasn't asleep. I could hear a timid knock on my door. "Go away." I managed to hoarsely shout at the door.
"If..." he broke away from the kiss, "you want to continue, we can go over there to the loo and close the door." He gestured over the the private loo for his room, that I imagine was very small, but had
I put my hand up, my voice quiet now. I was trying to get the better of my rage. My head was pounding as fast and hard as my heart was. I cleared my throat, "You know what? I can't talk about this right now, ok?" None of this was making sense, as a matter of fact the more he spoke the worse I felt.
I'm on my own here. Mary was watching me carefully. I sighed and tried to catch myself, but it sounded more like a groan. A groan of someone who wanted nothing more than a quiet, warm night in, but who now has to do something dreadful.
Sherlock shrugged, “John, I…..”    he leaned forward and placed his right elbow on his right knee and leaned on his hand. John thought he looked sleepy, his half closed eyes not giving anything away.
“No, its fine really, are you ok?” John immediately recognizing a dreaded softness in his own voice. Later, laying upstairs in his bed would he think back to how much he wished he could reach through that phone, even if it was only with his voice.
My court case is coming up. Between worrying about the trial and thinking about Sherlock, I'm not sleeping at all.
“Yeah… yeah, that’s Sherlock. Excuse me, Mary. I have to see about something…..” John jumped up and started purposefully towards the front of the pub.  John disliked Jim so intensely that he was certain that this could not be good.
As John lifted his glass to his lips, the door of the pub opened with a gust, and there in the doorway stood Sherlock. He was alone.
He stood there, the light of the fridge the only light on in the dark kitchen.  At times likes these, it stung how little John really knew about Sherlock. It was John that Sherlock spoke to the most and yet he was surprised by him every single day.
Was such a thing possible? My marks had improved, I was no longer failing my exams. I can go down the pub!! It felt like a just reward for all the work I had done.
John blindly sat down on the lid of the loo.  Sherlock handed him a water bottle. He squinted to see, but waved it away suspiciously. "I'm not drinking that."
“Oh.” Says Sherlock softly, walking into the kitchen and standing shyly in front of John, his hands in the pockets of his track pants.
John got a letter from Sherlock over break. He didn’t remember giving him his address though. The letter was brief. It didn’t say much just:
Sherlock looked up at John and smiled, “I guess we'd better get up to the house and change for dinner and the Christmas service.”
better." His voice was a deep whisper as he kissed me on the lips and made his way down my neck. My hands were in his hair and under his vest. His pajama bottoms were loose and open and I had to reach around to cup his arse.
I know my brother has me followed. I know the school reports to him. He didn't mention my (unauthorized) trip to the club. No mention of the riot, nor my photo on the front of the local newspapers.
John loved to socialize, some thing he knew Sherlock was not  necessarily interested in. He met loads of people through Mary and was invited to loads of parties. John was having the time of his life. They went out to dinner in a large group, they went dancing, to pubs and clubs.
Sighing, John went to the fridge and got a beer. He opened it and sat on the sofa. He hoped this wasn't going to take all night.
John stood there dumbly. "Oh, I made him call you, to come help," Mrs. Hudson whispered to John. "I'll told him--I'll call your brother, or worse yet, I'll call..."
"Good." he smiled at me. "He needs grounded, John. He's brilliant, He needs to be busy--something to do. I've thought I might give him a job at the Met, loads of times, but..."
"No." I grabbed them out of his hand and made my way to a back office that he had relegated me to.  I tossed my coat over a chair and sat at an old unused desk and prepared myself for a long afternoon of being unable to think.
I watch as he slips out the door and silently through the lounge. I realize we didn't discuss meeting again. I closed my door quietly.
"John, we can't stop you. If you think it's best, then go." his Dad shrugged. "Come back when you can." he put his hand on John's shoulder.
I would have never found this out, but Mary had a guilty conscience and told me everything. Mary was helping Jim. She told Jim each time we went out and to which pub we were headed. It was Mary who was watching us.
The students were already realizing the hazard of the slip and fall and were being careful walking or running.
After that it didn't take long for John to come. His hand fell away from mine, his thrusting erratic, his face red. He arched his back up off the bed and flooded my hand. He smiled up at me.
I change into track pants and worn t-shirt I've had for ages.  I pour the red wine I've squirreled away into a school mug and settle in for the evening.
"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but if you are out after curfew, isn't this a breach of the terms of your bail?"
John sighed and walked over to Sherlock. He reached up to touch his face and Sherlock jerked back away from him.
I really didn't want to explain the whole thing, but I did. He looked a bit relieved after hearing it. "I'll call your school in the morning."
I turned around to look at him. He smiled and shrugged his shoulders again. I opened the door and walked out.
"Yeah. Molly came with me." she answered, but then couldn't help but follow John's eyes across the room when she realized he wasn't looking at her. "What are you loo....?
They walked up the stairs in silence. John opened the door. No Mike yet, still out maybe or at his new girlfriend’s flat.
"Mikes told me lots of stories, never thought I'd meet 'cha!!" Liz was smiling much too wide for Sherlock's comfort.
It took a few months to send Jim Moriarty and his father to jail. There was a prolonged trial, Mr. Moriarty getting the best barristers money and drugs can buy to defend him, but the evidence was overwhelming. Many witnesses came forward including the staff employed at his club to give evidence for his drugs dealing.
“Sometimes he talks a lot,” she said pouting, turning to speak to Mike. A few minutes later, they heard the soft strains of Sherlock's violin through the door of his bedroom.
He motions for me to sit. "I was told that you are a connoisseur." He sits and rummages through his pockets.
“Wasn’t difficult.” Sherlock looked at John, still wearing his football jersey that he wore yesterday to the party. He slept in it. And all his belongings in the world-money, clothes school books, all gone in the explosion.
How many weeks had it been since the riot?  I spoke to him that night, right before everything went wrong. I remember him. I'd know him anywhere.
"Now Watson!! Down the pub!!" they started to turn him around by the shoulders and usher him back to the door.
Mike begged off. “As much as I’d love to, I have an early shift at the lab in the morning. Football tomorrow, John?”
John was looking pretty rough by this point, his hair was pretty wet now, plastered to his head. His ears were stinging and his nose was running. He started at the farthest left that he estimated the camera might reach and worked his way, walking carefully, one foot in front of the other, towards the right. Walking carefully along and when he was done he tiptoed away to look at his handiwork.
‘Budget friendly student accommodation!’ the sign in the window read. This made John laugh. Large, shabby and probably poorly heated is more like it, he thought. Just then he realized he didn’t stop to get the key. He tried the doorknob, locked. He knocked softly, no answer. Bugger, how was he going to get in?
I knocked on the door and opened it a crack. He was standing at the bedside, packing a suitcase. He looked up.
Mary stops by my room occasionally, less now. She's mad at me. I think everyone is, a bit, after they saw me hit Jim. But Mary was there when he pushed me off the balcony. If anyone should understand, it's her.
Sherlock stood up and walked over to him. "What?" he asked, looking down at John who had yet to re pocket the phone.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and continues, "But I was afraid--I wouldn't be able...." his voice breaks,  "...to make it back to you." he whispers.  Sherlock swallows hard, looks at John briefly, then turns away again.
I had just been sitting there, staring at the pages anyway. He handed me a cup of tea and sat down opposite.  "Anything?"
He looked up and saw Jim Moriarty standing and staring at him from across the room. Just staring. Other students were walking in and out of the library directly in front of and behind Jim, who was just standing at the one end of the room. Staring at John.
"Fine Ian, these two are just leaving." he lowered the poker and placed it back in the stand near the fireplace.
Last was the coat. John took it out. A long gray woolen coat. The coat Harry wears when she dresses up a bit. He reached in the left pocket-one black leather glove. He reaches in the right pocket the other black leather glove, nothing here…wait.
"I think I'll have this 'stack of biscuits' with chocolate, caramel and cream." she said smiling up at me over the menu.
"Just maybe...until tomorrow?" She asked him gently, looking over at Sherlock, now covered in a blanket.
"Where's the harm, really?" Jim continued, eyes wide.  "Who's going to know? I don't see John Watson 'round here anywhere, do you?" Jim leaned in towards Sherlock once more with a conspiratorial whisper, beads of sweat appearing across his brow.  "Cross my heart, I won't tell. I'm as good as my word."
The time frame being narrow, the boys went to view the crime scene before the coroner took the body away.
”The flat was too hot. I opened the window in the kitchen.” John said slowly, looking in the fridge, no milk.
Sitting in my room with Sherlock, balancing the chemistry equations he had given me. He was sitting opposite me, reading something in German that I couldn't decipher. Didn't ask him what it was.
As if the kid could read his thoughts, he said, "No it's not a dream, John, you are to come with me." John looked over at sleeping Sherlock, who had not stirred at all after his loud yelling and said, "Ok, what the hell, looks as if I have no choice, let's go."
"I'd call that an exaggeration. I'm not in shock at all." Sherlock said, rolling his eyes at the detective.
"Oh." she put her head down. She seemed to be quietly considering something. "John, I bought a li-lo this year. And it's big enough for two. You can put it on the floor in your room."
Sherlock didn't move and he didn't answer. He only looked down at John’s finger slowly moving along the back of his hand to his wrist. Then John curved his finger a little to fit inside the cuff of Sherlock's  sleeve. John took another step even closer and was now toe to toe with Sherlock. They were about a hair's breadth apart. Sherlock could hear John breathing.
John raised his finger to his lips, in an effort to keep Sherlock quiet until he was sure that Mike wasn’t coming out again from the bedroom.
John's head was whirling right and left, "No, no--I need a phone. I have to make a call. A phone call."
As I left I caught hold of my temper, or I would have slammed the door dramatically. Glad that I didn't, because Mary Morstan sat in the study lounge adjacent to John's room, apparently awake at 5 am, feet tucked under her, book balanced on her knees. I glanced her way, darkly.
I couldn't pay attention the first time. The alcohol and shock of what was happening dulled my senses.
Getting into the club was easy. I had the red Fresher's Week band, as a well as the gold Queue Jumper's band. I sailed right in. Not sure why I'm here.  Nothing going on this sleepy side of London.
Walking along with Sherlock to the Yard, John heard one unbelievable story after another from the young man walking next to him. Left secondary school early, now at uni, he was allowed to do what sounded like what ever he wanted, as long as he produced quality research. He did have an adviser he met with regularly, to keep tabs. He explained to John he would likely be taking another degree and stay longer at uni. Why not? John thought, What kind of job could he get at 16?
"It has come to my attention that you filled out a request form to have one of your students transferred out of your class?"
After leaving John's, Sherlock ran all the way to Baker street. He took the 17 steps to his flat 2 steps at a time. Once in the flat, he banged the door shut and tossed himself on the sofa to sulk.
All three boys were sitting up and trying to stand when the emergency vehicles arrived on the scene.
I wanted to be with John. There was nothing for it. I just wasn't the best companion. Not tonight. Well, not usually, either.
After delivering the box to her flat,  he trotted down the stairs. Outside, standing on the pavement he said, "Irene, I never got to thank you for helping Sherlock last year-- " he left the rest of it just hanging there.
John hung up the phone. There were too many questions and too little time. Of course he was off to hospital to find out what happened to his sister. And if she was still alive.
I screamed at Mycroft when he arrived, looking like a proper lunatic-after all, I was still high. I'm sure his coworkers  feel sorry for him-burdened by a mad younger sibling.
"You sound like Mycroft, now." Sherlock rolled his eyes. He walked out of the kitchen and stood in front of the fire grate warming himself.
I took two steps into the room as the door swing shut. I stopped there, shocked at how frail he looked. "Hi." I said, my cheeks hot.
Sherlock paused, suddenly quiet, holding his hand up to his temple. "I think I have a bit of a headache." he said and promptly fell forward onto the table, hitting his head with a bang.
Third times a charm. He's leaning against the door and I'm stand in front of him. "Tomorrow's Saturday." I inch a little closer and tug on the lapel of his jacket.
It takes 36 minutes from London to Chelmsford on any given day. John found an empty seat and fell asleep as soon as he sat down. He woke with a start at the Chelmsford railway station. He was home.
“Oh, the girl that he…. never mind.  Sometimes, you have to look harder…” John begins, mumbling to himself mostly, closing his eyes, breath evening out.
Who tells me it just may cost him another term at uni. To add to the educational debt he's racking up here. That his family can ill afford, I reckon.
"Well sir, I feel it is in my best interest to not have that young man in my class." The professor felt he needed to find his voice and be clear about the problem, even if it was one that he had never encountered in his 20+ years of teaching.
He sighed. His brow was furrowed and he looked quickly both ways down the street. "No, it's alright. Can we just hurry and get to your flat? It's freezing."
Sherlock's group got up to leave. Thankfully, they didn't have to pass us to get to the door. Mary kept her hand on mine across the table the entire time, almost holding me in place. "Don't do anything you'll regret, John." she whispered.
Tucked away on a busy street in Westminster, opposite of the St James tube station, five young men sit  at a long curved desk looking a bank of monitors in the dark.
Younger John was up ahead of Sherlock by a good 50 feet. As he had walked along he was listening to the crunch of the snow under his trainers. Walking along the snowy path that lead backup to the house.
John was silent, watching Sherlock scan the wine list again—reading it front to back as if he really knew what he was doing.
And now I know what this is, but I snort a line anyway.   I felt immediately warm, my legs tingling. A wave a nausea hit but I didn't retch. My head fell back and the room tipped to the side. I tried to stand. Didn't succeed.
Seeing John that night was not the worst thing that could have happened to me. In years hence, Mycroft would refer to these events as
John's face was just inches from Sherlock's. Sherlock looked into John's clear eyes, so serious and steady, noticing a fleeting second of wonder.
I came out of the stall to wash my hands and splash my face with cold water. I though maybe I could relax for a moment and clear my head but I wasn't alone in the loo.
I'm frozen. He's holding on to the back of the chair with his left hand as he trails along my jaw with his fingertips. He gently touches my lower lip with his thumb. He has effectively pinned me to the chair. He's practically sitting in my lap. All I'd have to do is sit up and dump him off, but he leans in to kiss me before I can make up my mind.
For a quick minute, he entertained the idea of getting up to see if the door had a lock so he wouldn't be bothered. Too late, the door swing open, letting humid air from the party, as well as the cacophony, into the stair well.
"All of this water and the DJ and lights. Invariably setting up this entire place for an electrical disaster."
There were entirely too many people on my bed. They decided to come to mine for pre drinks before clubbing. Mike brought a four pack of Carlsberg and Molly brought a bottle of prosecco.
"Hello John, think you'll have time to make it to football practice this morning?" Mike asked cheerfully.
All the lights were on in the building. Chains rattled as the door opened. It was the elderly lady from Speedy's "Oh John, you've come! I didn't know what to do. He won't listen to me, of course. I almost called..." She whispered.
John walked over the the kitchen and look at the table--covered in beakers, glassware, microscope. The bunsen burner was off. John peered at it, reading 'University of London' stamped on the side.
I don't study, I'm avoiding the library and the coffee shop, so I've told loads of people to piss off.
He wanted to go to dinner and suggested a restaurant, no less. I wasn't even sure this was allowed. He walked right up to Mycroft and requested his card. Mycroft handed it to him and we were on our way.
"It was a mistake, Sherlock. I was wrong. I should be living with you. I should be here, with you. I mean, if you'll have me.
The group gave a big laugh, because everyone knew that wasn’t true. John was just as serious a socializer as he was a student.
Harry was delighted to open the package. Inside she found a new doll, the one she wanted, advertised on the telly. John knew his father had purchased it weeks before, but somehow wrapping it (or putting it under the tree) did not become a priority.
Lost in thought, young John turned back around and when he saw that Sherlock had not followed him he doubled back, jogging a bit. John joined Sherlock at the edge of the water, looking thoughtfully down, carefully pushing his foot against the ice, watching the air bubbles underneath and pushing until the ice cracked.
John and Sherlock just stared at each other for a few minutes, waiting, holding a collective breath. Then the boys erupted in laughter for several minutes, faces red.
I went over my options, which were slim, I just decided to start out on the street. I walked to his school and stood in front the residence hall. I know which window is his, it was dark. I doubt he is there. Possible. but doubtful
"It's back at the club, apparently." Sherlock looked down at John standing in front of him. He had a odd expression on his face that John couldn't read.
Harry--so bloody practical, he thought bitterly. More practical to avoid an overdose, Harry. What in the bloody hell were you doing?
We were both sticky with the warm ejaculate and I kept going. It didn't take long.  John's cock was semi hard and I kept thrusting along side of his, watching his face get red again. I was watching him squirm under me, his eyes full of heat as he watched me until I came, adding my ejaculate to his. I fell half on top of him.
“Oh, John! Mrs Watson fell onto John’s shoulder crying. When she caught her breath, he guided her to a chair to sit.
A group of people sit at the breakfast table chatting, eating and having tea. He sees Mary, the real Mary this time, her hair no longer blonde, but light brown- her true color, he knows. She is not smiling, just sitting there quiet, drinking tea.
When John had to finally leave the flat, Sherlock told him to go on ahead and he’d be by later, but John did not really think Sherlock would come to the party.
“…And,” she continued, looking again down at her shoes, cheeks pink, but voice very determined,   “I wouldn’t want you to hurt him, so if you don’t feel the same way, I’d let him know as soon as possible, before it gets out of hand.” Molly walked away, leaving John to just stare after her in amazement.
John overhears Mycroft and his wife discussing plans to fly to the US, as she is going back to Harvard for a semester, to be a guest lecturer on dead languages.
And why couldn’t John stay? Because if he stayed he’d never leave. Because what he wanted and what he needed were two different things.
I went from pub to pub. After long, I recognized the blokes Sherlock was with. Keeping my composure, I asked one of them if they had seen Sherlock or Jim, but they said they had long gone and didn't know where.
that there was more to his odd behavior, but not knowing exactly what. I never believed him when he said John fell from the balcony. I had always believed John. Too bad John didn't believe me.
John looked forlornly up at the ruined building, shock blanket still covering his shoulders, the flashing lights reflecting off his face. The boys started to walk away from the scene, but they as yet, had no destination.
"Yeah, just way, way out." Jim smirking, picked up one of Sherlock's arms and dropped it back onto the booth cushion. It dropped loosely. "That was fast." he mused to himself, under his breath.
John surveyed the scene, his mouth set in a firm line, the ache in his neck just starting to throb. "Sherlock, what's going on?"
Jim had his arm around Mary's shoulder, whispering in her ear. Mary turned red when she saw me. Mary was not my girlfriend, I had no claim on her.  She can talk to any bloke she wants.
Mike walked in with a big smile on his face, eyes bright. He looked at the completely annihilated sitting room, furniture turned over and pieces of broken wooden coffee table everywhere.
“I’d say you’d gotten the worst of it Sherlock!!” Mike observed. “Right then, ‘night.” Mike said as he walked by shrugging, and barely gave them a glance and went straight to his room and closed his door.
Glad she had hold of me because the last one out of the door leaving with Sherlock was Jim Moriarty.
Sometime around midnight John woke. He was laying on his stomach in just his pants. He wondered what time it was. With his eyes closed, he inhaled deeply, the 800-some thread count Egyptian cotton sheets with their distinctive smell. No, he thought, smell is really the wrong word. Fragrance is better. He knew that fragrance intimately.
I asked to speak to the manager and tried to explain the hazard to a few of the bouncers, but no one wants to listen to a drunk uni student (that would be me). I hoped I was wrong, i did manage to mention it to a few of the students who would listen.
I spent the next 20 minutes pulling him up to a sitting position, talking to him, shouting at him. He looked a little better, but not much. He opened his eyes and looked at me. "John? What are you doing in my dream?"
and has a moment of doubt. It seems so long ago. A different world. Sherlock's 17 now and John's not much older than that.
Popping his head around the doorframe of the loo, Sherlock laughs derisively, “What are you on about?  What girl?”
John's legs were folded and cramped to accommodate the makeshift ‘coffee table’ so he stretched them out to either side of the book pile,  his stocking feet ending up on either side of Sherlock’s folded legs.
She turned toward me when she got to the door. "I guess he's just not interested in me. I guess he has someone else." she shrugged.
And that's when he saw him. Jim Moriarty came snaking through the misty room and slung an arm around Mary's shoulder. He whispered in Mary's ear and she giggled. "John, this is Jim," she shouted over the base, the whites of her eyes now looking blue.
He stared out into the parking lot, watching the snow still falling. The town was quiet, no traffic on the street in front of the hospital. Occasionally, a car would drive by, not stopping. After a while, a small car pulled up in front of the hospital.   It sat there, wiper blades wiping the snow off the windshield in repetition.
I ran my left hand up into his hair and my right hand moved to his waist. He pulled away briefly and looked up at me.
Sherlock walks out of the bedroom in his track pants, no shirt. “Good morning.” He says, trying to get John’s attention.
I shed my coat and scarf and lost myself in a large obscure textbook.   I wasn't aware of Molly's approach until she was at my elbow. Out of the corner of my eye I glimpsed her standing next to me, holding her pink coat. I looked up.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
In my room, Sherlock sat down on my bed, quiet and still brooding. He took his gloves off and shoved them into his pockets.
Frantically, John finds track pants for himself and tosses another pair to Sherlock, who puts them on quickly.
"I have something else for you. I can tell you're uncomfortable. Help to come down. Just a little help." He stands and I watch him dig deep into this trouser pocket and bring out another small package and unwrap it.
