John's jaw shut with a click and he let the tears show in his eyes, no longer afraid. His hands fell featherlight onto Sherlock's arms.
The monk chuckled, "fortunately no. I'm looking for a man, John Watson? I was told he lived around these parts."
"Tell you what?"
The cold of the night outside immediately eats at the tears on his cheeks. Making his face burn. John wipes them away with the back of his right hand and shoves his useless other into his coat pocket, hoping sharply that it will regain feeling soon.
John's vision funnels down to the dark mass fleeing before him through a tunnel of red. He does not hear Sherlock call his name. Does not feel his body's reticence. He simply chases. Runs full bore. Arms pumping. Legs pumping. Heart roaring. Portraits blurring at his sides.
the reference to a purple sky is the color of smoke they use to signal to the helicopters for pickup in real life.
John had risen from his woolgathering calmly and surprised himself by managing a delicate smile. The first he'd ever felt on his face since the fine flushes of boyhood had assailed him. A long time before his first shaky cigarette after a bullet went whizzing by and puckered the mud-dried wall by his face. Before his wife stopped loving him.
In a sort of grim way, the body looked to be the human equivalent to a half-squeezed tube of toothpaste. And in some place far off in his brain, John realized he should have bought mouthwash.
And was humbled.
Sherlock's voice broke through the cacophony in his head, as it was uncharacteristically demure. "It is a meager token in light of the evidence, but I have arranged for your friend to receive, when he is able, the finest physical therapist Britain has to offer until he fully recovers. Free of charge.
"Happy?" Sherlock was confused. "What are you talking about? I'm perfectly content."
But now was too soon. There was more to be exposed between them. He needed to know John as mush as John needed to know him. And he promised himself that their desires would come to pass eventually, that they had to.
He tucked the Stradivarius back under his long chin and John finally caught on. Ah. Of course. He hadn't disturbed anything by his presence. Sherlock had wanted him here. It was simply the first rest that he'd walked into.
John's heart stuttered in his chest. Panic licking up his spine. He feared that he had made a fool of himself, coming to the floor in a heap like he did. He had displeased the Prince in some way unknown to him and was being dismissed. Before John had even had a chance to--
Sherlock pulled a pair of briefs from the rummage and held them up on his finger. "Red, John? Really?"
"It's perfectly fine to ejaculate," Sherlock unsheathed his mouth with a lascivious slurp, "it is rather the point."
"I'm sorry, but you'll have to return in the morning." The High Steward informed him, a curl to his thin lips. "I've already locked the door for the night."
"John?"
John's eyes popped open under the rush of adrenaline. "Sherlock?" He shuffled back as the arms fell loose, hissing when he moved his shoulder a little too quickly. "What about your rules?" Sherlock's mountainous cheekbone shined with his moisture in the dawnlight.
The older man had plucked his fawny hairline clear back to the top of his head and powdered his whole face to a spectral white with lead ash. Achieving the high aristocratic brow and pale visage so sought after by royalty. But no matter how much he looked the part; he would always ever be a fraud.
"Electrocuted, would you believe?" Lestrade corrected. "CCTV surveillance shows two people getting tickets for the last train on the Piccadilly Line at zero ten, neither get on, then the murderer shoves our victim in once the train passes and leaves. No witnesses were on the platform and the bastard had their face all bundled so we haven't got any way to identify them as of--"
John gave his tooth another lave, rolling his eyes at Sherlock's back. "Yes, in fact..." he looked about to explain his idle standing and his eyes fell upon the stack of records on the floor in the corner. It was a project he'd always had tucked away for doing and now seemed a good a time as any. The day was yet young. "I'll just sort these."
His sister had been his estate agent. A hackneyed try at her fourth consecutive interest when she could never keep away from the booze long enough to make it a vocation. Before this it had been unsuccessfully running a sweets shop that had closed down six months after it'd opened. Two years after her marriage. Her wife's final gift before divorcing his sister had been paying off her debt and suggesting real estate instead. All the best, well wishes, I can't watch you disappear.
"No. Yes!" Sherlock lobbed one of the jars of baby food at John, which he bobbled before finally catching. "Feed the Sebastopol."
The unintended honesty of the last statement, flashing quick off the spike of the penultimate one, quelled back John's fury into pulsing embarrassment. He was wrong. But his brain stubbornly ploughed on without acknowledging this. "Well, were you really going to buy it?"
John's face took on that peculiarly becoming shade of red, but it did make not shy away. Instead, he reached out his hand and let Sherlock take it.
However Sherlock functioned was simply how it was and he would take Sherlock in ANY way he came. Sexually or not. He was still his. He HAD to make him know this.
also. the page from the book that Sherlock uses to show John what the mushroom looks like was inspired (and subsequently photoshopped by me) by the Mira Calligraphiae Monumenta which is one of the most gorgeous books I've ever seen and you should plug the name of it into your search bar just to take a gander at it! it was inscribed in the 16th century by Georg Bocskay and illuminated by Joris Hoefnagel and holy geeze it's fucking magnificent!
He breathed only through his nose as Charles stepped before him, stroking a finger tenderly down Sherlock's cheekbone. "Open your eyes to me." He instructed. And Sherlock did.
And now, by some twisted stroke of fate, he was to return there to live. To work as a Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (whatever that meant) for a Holmes family member whom he'd never even heard of at King Mycroft's direct request.
"I know!" Her face went bright with love. "He does that, doesn't he? I like to think of him as a tropical storm, like the ones we use to have in Florida. He comes in and just blows everything about and then is off again. And whatever he leaves behind, of course it's messy and it's loud and it can be rather terrible, but there's always sunshine afterwards."
It paused, tilting its head this way and that, trying to find the figure in the dark. Knowing better than to call out. It knew this figure almost as intimately as the figure knew it. And every morning without fail, Spring through Autumn, they would meet.
"You must understand that Eric and Victor...that in the time I spent with them, they were only ever allowed a facsimile of myself."
Though it hadn't been said outright, John was pretty sure this was endgame. This was the man that all their work had culminated to. The killer responsible for pushing two innocent men to their deaths and harvesting their organs for profits. And he was just behind the door.
There was no crown upon his head today, John noticed, only the tempest swirl of his dark black hair. But there was a twinkle in his eye that wanted to burst into a smile.
"That night you didn't seem to mind. You even joked about it."
Sherlock's had mind raced as his brother continued. Trying to gather up all the information he could about Charles, cursing himself for not having paid more attention to the women and men in Mycroft's Royal Court. The most he could remember was that Charles had risen through the hierarchy by blackmail and bargain. Clawing his way to the top upon the backs of others.
"I only came here to tell you how sor--"
The only thing that had remained exactly the same were his sky blue eyes, which had never lost their luster.
"Studies suggest the average male has a refractory period of at least a half hour. I imagine yours would undoubtedly choose to be just as plebian..." his head popping up from between John's knees to find his friend looking at him with a worried frown. Sherlock mouthed at the inside of his thigh to reassure him, lip biting his way towards John's arse and lingering longer in the places that made John twitch. "I want to do an experiment."
She absolutely beamed when her eyes fell upon Sherlock, despite him physically wilting at the fact that she was not the promised corpse on its way to be ruthlessly examined.
"Do you know when this was found?" John asked curiously to a young man standing near by.
Lestrade eventually lost the battle, trying again for conversation. It was taking a while to get back to the corpse. "So how are you and Sherlock getting on living together? I don't know if I can imagine what he's like to be around twenty-four hours a day." There was true exasperation in Lestrade's voice.
"That was very kind of you." John scrambled to take the bag from her, not at all comfortable with the idea that she'd touched his pants. "You really didn't have to..."
"What about him?" John asks as he looks down. His eyesight is swimming raucously with pain and worry and tears, but he can still see that the Union Jack neck man is sprawled boneless on the carpet. Arms and legs loose as though he's been snipped at all his joints. His exhumed eyeball is resting next to his mouth and there's a halo of wet scarlet dying the carpet dark beneath his head.
With a steadying breath, Sherlock takes himself in hand and guides his cock in.
When John reemerged, he put on a generous smile and made a round with the tray before taking his seat. Taking pride in the little triangle sandwiches Mrs. Hudson had helped teach him to cut, which turned one square of bread into three crust less Isosceles. With surgeon's hands, it was a surprisingly simple task.
John had the sudden and slightly bewildering urge to go pat that inky head, tell him it would be fine. He took a step towards him even to do such, but stopped short. Would that be crossing the line? Was casual consolation of his flatmate going too far? They've kissed, yes. But Sherlock had asked and John had acquiesced and then that second time had been...well...under duress. He licked his lips.
"Aye." John had ceded. He was pathetic. He knew it. He considered himself the lowliest of lifes now. But still he had his morals.
"And someday I will. This I vow to you on my life," his voice had a dark power. "I will kill that man and you will be set free. Free to live happily for the rest of your years as your own man." And to look in his stunning blue eyes was to know that there was never a promise made that could have been more true.
The tears burn hot and hard in John's eyes, some of them spilling down and slicking onto Sherlock's pale face as he presses apologetic kisses to the hot red blotch high and center on Sherlock's forehead. He has no doubt it's going to turn into a pretty nasty goose egg in a little while.
John leant back from his plate, holding his gaze, putting it bluntly. "You were fiending. Before you say anything, just hear me out. Your work is your life, yeah? You told me that yourself. When 'The Game' is, well, when it's on, it's great. You're happy, you're engaged; you've got loads of endorphins pumping through you. Plus you've usually got adrenaline coursing through your system too from the cases that involve running."
When he finally acquiesced and took the King's decree into his own shaking hand, he'd been told that in a fortnight, when his strength had better returned, he was to bring himself to Castle Appledore to attend his own knighting ceremony.
As they watched the guards turn to follow, William and John shared a perplexed glance at one another before feeling that there was no other course of action they could take but to follow.
"I stayed with groups. Kept my wits about me." John replied eventually before letting the silence spread again. He was  content to take his time in admiring the colours before him as if he were at an art gallery. The plan that was currently unfurling in his mind was making him see the beauty in life, in /this/ moment, all the more vividly. But it could not hold a candle to the true beauty in the room.
"Tidy what?" Sherlock asked, genuinely more confused. "Looks perfectly fine to me."
Lestrade leaned in as well, obliging. "Sure. No problem. Let's see if I can remember specifics...
Mrs. Hudson smiled kindly, setting it down on top, then held up a finger and dug into her deep house coat pocket. "Oo! Almost forgot! Here's that baby food you asked about Sherlock. You didn't specify on a flavor, so I got you corn puree and oh, what's this," she squinted hard at the label on a jar that looked ambiguously purple, "spaghetti. Hope that'll do."
He was sprawled over half of John's body. Keeping one of his leg's immobile, with the epsilon axe of John's hip digging up into his guts. Sherlock purposely left his waste touching the side of John's prick. Wanting to keep it desperate for more friction but unable to achieve it as he moved. But the idea was certainly working, if the slight humping of John's pelvis were any indication.
"The pusher went through the trouble to treat both men exactly the same premortem. Both were given extravagant suits in such a brief period of time that the material used in making both is sure to have come from the same bolt of fabric. Definitely having been made by the same private tailor sewn with identical stitching and thread.
Sherlock stood facing John with his hands behind his back. His elegant figure haloed in by the pale light of morning, which served as a perfect backdrop to the dove gray gown threaded with gold that swathed his lean body in beautiful lines and made the fabric itself seem to glow.
"Oh, nice Sherlock. You could have ruined the machines." John chided.
Finally approaching the top of the tallest tower, the thrush spread its wings, adjusted for the whipping wind, and lit lightly down upon the lentil of a very high window sill. The highest there was for miles around. The highest, possibly, in the known world.
He tugged at the hem of his jacket to cover himself, took a loud breath, and poked his head out the door to check that the coast was clear. Before immediately freezing in place.
"Oh." John glanced at the bag as if he'd only just noticed it still in his hands. "Um, yeah. Couldn't sleep." The cover was slipshod, but he hoped Lestrade would respect his boundaries, despite the hundreds more questions that passed over his tan face.
The beat of silence took up every available molecule between them.
The main piece that housed his cock was a solid cylinder with a mushroom tip that sloped down to comfortably fit him while he was in a relaxed state. A vertical slit was carved in its tip to allow him to urinate without having to take it off, but the thick, solid wood made it impossible for him to get an erection.
"Ah yes, how forgetful of me. A peasant uprising." Charles said with a sneer. Bringing him back. "King Mycroft's loyalties lie very deep indeed, it would seem. But surely such a story only illuminates how an act of pure chance may serve to further drag out this war into a longer engagement? All this bloodshed compounded by a slave with a lucky swing of his sword? Remind yourself that the very same could befall your brother King at any time. And then I doubt you would show such delight."
John poked gently at the cut flesh, testing its resistance and gave it his best surgeon's scrutiny. "Looks like an appendectomy incision, and a very recent one too, going by the color. I'd say very VERY recent. God. Had to have been done no later than two days ago, approximately. It's definitely professional. No puss or infection. Though I thought appendectomies were done laparoscopically nowadays."
The corner of Sherlock's mouth curled wryly. "Not anything of much consequence."
"You could just ask."
"Oh'mguh...Chrst!...ow Sherl--wha..." If only partially. With his words tilting halfway between surprise and pleasure, Sherlock probed at his perineum in apology with the tip of his tongue, deft around his mouthful. Each press of that organic button sending explosion after explosion up through his prostrate body, until John's dial of arousal could do nothing more than click over to eleven.
But as he followed the line, the consistency of the cut itself became more peculiar. It seemed that the cut had begun beneath the corpse's right ear, came around the front of his throat, and immediately stopped beneath his left, leaving only a fifty millimeter stretch of skin beneath his nape that was startling jagged by contrast.
"What? Oh. Yes." Sherlock was only slightly concerned with the topic. "Couldn't finish though. My hands kept shaking and the angle in relation to the mirror was too obtuse. Couldn't see properly." There was a mess of half hearted punctures bitten along the edge, with only one true hole pierced through. It had to have been hard as hell to do.
But instead of feeling awful, pinned down, John felt a bit of a lift on the weight upon his shoulders. It explained the choices he had not even been aware he was making. Putting a reason to the whys of his morning ritual. His willingness to advertise himself through his clothes while he kept his naked truths all hidden. Strong and broken.
It had been a beauty that rivaled starshine. Rivaled miracles. Rivaled the fabled white deer that were said to live in the faraway Royal Forest of Baskerville. Which were reputed to glow blue on moonless nights and said only to have been witnessed by those lucky enough (or foolhearty) enough to gain trespass into the forbidden Forest to see them.
John smirked at the docile image of him there as he rounded up his supplies and ratcheted his stool up to its fullest height, realizing he'd still have to stand to treat the wound, given Sherlock's ridiculous height. "So..." he began, tucking tissue paper into Sherlock's collar and carefully shifting back his curls to clear the area.
John wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. Deciding a small break for lunch was well deserved. The cool breeze felt divine across his face and he let it persuade him into stripping off his brown tunic. Leaving him in only his boots, short white braies, and the green hose that were tied to them.
But it had happened twice now. Sherlock's obvious lack of arousal had happened TWICE. And John was pretty confident he was doing something right with the way Sherlock had reciprocated on their third time kissing. He was into it. But even still, he was batting oh for two (the second kiss didn't count) and it was chewing at him.
"Yes." Sherlock was picking up on John's hints and he swallowed down a sudden excess of saliva flooding his mouth. The butterflies were back again and he wanted to push forward at the same time he wanted to pull away.
It had to be fine.
Roaming up towards the neck, John found that the neck aberrations that he'd been so intrigued with on the head's flesh corresponded exactly with the torso's. Smooth single cut around the throat, only to turn jagged at the nape. These were definitely two parts of the same man.
"M'fine." Like being overcome by the ocean, John suddenly remembered all that had transpired last night. Able to map the lingering soreness in each of his muscles to what had occurred; the shoulder molestation, the rimming, Bill and the heartache and the promises he was instructed to make but could never quite say. He smiled wistfully. "You do know you can't exactly fuck the guilt out of someone yeah?" He felt the octopus crush of Sherlock's limbs squeeze tighter around him in response. A long thigh throw itself up across his hip. A huff of laughter against his hairline.
John felt himself suddenly warring between flattery and dismissal, and it came out as an incredulous chuckle, "you fancy old broken blokes in jumpers?"
"Good evening Doctor Watson." Comes a cool voice from behind him.
He'd also dismissed her so he could continue his much-needed rest after a particularly agonizing physiotherapy session had shaken him to his bones just that morning. He still felt the tremor rattling in his hand. Which seemed unfathomably to still as he placed it on the folder.
"It's beautiful." John said, completely awed by what he had found.
John studied it for a while, trying to make sense of it, then went about making himself dinner. Something simple with pasta, butter, and herbs and portioned it to have enough leftovers for when Sherlock returned. He decided to tidy up a bit, burying the biohazard bag containing gone off brain at the bottom of the rubbish sack and taking it down to the bins.
He tucked the blanket he'd stolen from the back of the couch more tightly around his shoulders and burrowed down like an angry turtle. "Go on then."
He paused. "None whatsoever. It still would have happened. But...y'know what? Just sod it. Forget I even brought it up." John was losing ground and changed tactics. He couldn't ever hope to explain how bad he'd felt walking out of 221B and finding out about the explosion on the telly at Sarah's the next morning. He was just happy Sherlock hadn't gotten injured. "How do you even know I feel guilty?"
(See the end of the chapter for
When a new High Steward had been found and a hasty yet decadent coronation been afforded, Sherlock received word of a very peculiar decree that the new High Steward Charles Magnussen had requested before he was to take the throne.
After bringing the animals indoors, all the Watsons had chosen to stay up for the entirety of the night. The only one who did manage to get any shut eye was brother Michael, who without much fuss at all took his spectacles from his face, linked his fingers across his belly, and set his chin upon his chest precisely where he sat propped against the wall and began immediately to softly snore.
"Do you want to have sex?"
The barman slid John's comparatively ordinary drink into his hand and John took a sip, immediately followed by another as he realized how good it actually tasted. But he was interrupted from truly indulging in it.
"There is NO universe in which I will not love you."
It was as hungrily done as the kiss in the morgue had been, but with the endless quality of last night's. Just a simple statement of necessity and understanding that they had both found new levels to their relationship with one another and that neither of them could ever bear to shy away.
Sherlock, being mostly inexperienced with drawn-out kissing, simply kept his mouth in one place and let John do what he would. It wasn't unpleasant, he decided, especially when John let issue a little moan amidst his gentle shifting.
"Yes. Good. Fine." Sherlock replied disinterestedly and rose, gliding back into the sitting room. He pursed his lips and turned off the record player where it had been lulling in a scene change.
John heard Sherlock mutter a, "hm? oh yes," in distracted confirmation and closed the door behind him, which, after some consideration, wasn't nearly as infested as John had feared. Sure, the light switch had been wired onto a bypassable timer, a digital hygrometer had been brutally mounted to the wall beside it, the window had been sealed over with plastic, and the humidity in the air was thick enough that John had a hard time taking a full breath, but the plants themselves seemed to bring an almost alien, terrestrial beauty to a room that had otherwise been hermetically boring.
"Yeah..." He remembered the moment quite vividly actually, sitting in the cab on the way back from the lab, Sherlock having just had the epiphany of the questionable death of the child, all based on the Sussex mud caked onto one of the trainer's soles. It had rather stuck in his mind.
"Oh. Ta."
And while they did all this, absolutely no one spoke a word.
The crowd, who had been standing idle with their handfuls of rot as they listened, now became rigid in their stances. Arms drawing back in excitement. Lips drawing up into sneers.
He turned back to the window and nothing more was said.
jesus i hope the timing all made sense in that. hit me up if you're confused. :}
He took to being naked for the hell of it. With no one around and only the ocean to court, it just felt natural. That, and drinking like a fish.
Charles eyes glinted. "Then you have time still to make the right decision. It is fortunate for me that the war has taken him so far away and with no word as to when he might possibly return. It's quite possible he never shall. There are rumors that the War of the Reichenbach may never end. What would you say to that? Do you truly believe such an unassailable force as Moriarty's Crusade will be forever stalled by an army of your brother?"
But the room was utterly empty.
"Step up!" He called and the two skinny oxen snorted with indignation before beginning to move. The wide handles of the walking plow jolting to life in his hands as the team lumbered forward. Hewn earth cresting in front of the plough's share before breaking apart beneath his feet.
There was click and Sherlock's magnifying glass appeared in his periphery, in offering.
He is left gasping, trying to pull in desperate mouthfuls of expensive suit while his skeleton sings with pain. He can't pick up his head no matter how hard he tries and he can't shift his body away from the body he's lying on, which makes the darkness behind his eyelids sparkle with panic. He fights fiercely to get his arms free, but they are trapped and he is /trapped/ and he can't   b r e a t h e   OHGOD! he  CAN'T BREATHE   there's something ON HIS FACE HECAN'TBREA--
The dealer ran his thumb down his nose and seemed to brighten. "Ah! A man after my own heart, I see! Very good, very good. Gram'll cost you a century, 'cause I'd be takin' from my own stash, mind, but I do have just the droids you're looking for--" the man was reaching in to his waistcoat and pulling out a small baggy of white powder before John even realized what was happening and quickly shut it down.
"I am. And I was." Sherlock defended, resuming his curled up position upon the couch.
This could not be real!
"Facilitates regurgitation. Now go upstairs and check the floor for opals. You've only seven minutes to catch the train." He dropped his hand back over his face like a queen dismissing a servant.
Which, apparently, wasn't as angry as he'd assumed because the levity managed to make John crack a small smile, which he quickly schooled into a scowl. He was mad at him. Mad at the lengths he would go and the trouble he would get into simply in pursuit of the Work. But that also meant that he couldn't be mad at all, seeing as how the most crucial ingredient to John's previous rage had been that Sherlock had been alone. And right now, thank god, he wasn't.
"Of course it concerns me. Everything about you concerns me--oh!" A thought occurred suddenly to Sherlock as he added up the facts. Jumped three steps ahead of the information on hand and came to the correct conclusion. "She's dead. That's why she's in this book. Isn't she?"
You hurt and abuse tellin' all of your lies.
"So you choose not to expose yourself willingly because when I met you that day at Bart's lab you were so ashamed of the man you had become, didn't even /recognize/ him, that you could not bear it. You did not know who you were anymore, what you were capable of, and to unclothe you would expose this truth and lay you bare in every sense of the word. Correct?"
There was a moment of silence, before Sherlock's stiffness turned to concrete beneath him and a slightly awed look came over him. "Ah. There it is." Came the whisper in slight surprise.
And without debating it, John came to the only decision he had still at hand.
John sobbed, of all the responses he couldn't hope to dredge up becoming balled in a singular guttural sound.
The Diogenes Crossing was not as alive as it had been when John had first ridden through. But it was far more lively than Baker Town. And that was a start.
Brother Michael's gray mare had drunk her fill and now stood idly at John's side. In a way making John feel far more exposed on the river bank than he was before, for he could not play the part of a resting traveler any longer.
"So what's Prince Sherlock like?" William asked, pulling John from his spiral of doubt as he pulled the laces taut at John's shin.
but thanks for sticking with me!!
John's mind had raced as he tried to recognize this man. To know why he was here and weeping at his feet. He tried to understand what was going on and why these people were regarding him this way. He was a nobody. He was nothing. He was one of them and one among them. Or he had been. He was. . .
"Oi! Did you do this while we were out?" John was grinning up at the new windows, which made it look as though nothing had ever happened to 221B.
"Drink this." Sherlock says, not allowing any arguments as he practically forces the straw against John's lips. "Please John. The alcohol will counteract the effects of the ethylene glycol I've been putting in your tea. I need you to drink it right now."
"Well?" Prince Sherlock asked, his voice taking on the tilt of the weary. "Aren't you bored of being down there already? It must be murder on your knees."
The look of concern in Sherlock's eyes was only for him, he knew, encircled by the fall of dark curls. So its meaning John took to be genuine. A glance with those eyes and John was made aware of the sweat that had broken out across his forehead and top lip. "Are you alright John?"
"Facultative symbiosis?" Sherlock says.
"And new." John added.
John took hold of his frantic breathing until it became a metronomic hissing through his nose. Trying to focus on the sensation rather than his fear. And after a minute, after bullying himself into the idea, John began to systematically lean into the tongue, seeking it out. That careful grazing and nipping at the tender aisle of perineum anchoring him together while it simultaneously took him apart. He found himself calming down and enjoying it.
A message from King Mycroft arrived at the Castle not long after news of his brother's miraculous recovery had been sent and it demanded that Prince Sherlock be given a place where he could exercise his mind and a companion with which to wile away his days.
He started with a delicate lapping to Sherlock's corona and a swirling press to his frenulum. Paying special attention to the silky face of Sherlock's glans. Tonguing the slit. Laving the shaft. Before taking it all into his mouth.
"Now?" John could do nothing but blink in surprise and alarm as something ugly and needy washed over Sherlock's face. Wrecking his beautiful features and /staying/. Something like desperation.
"His name is David.
"Right." John fidgeted in his lean against the counter, shifting his hardening prick away from the thick material of his zip before it became uncomfortably trapped.
John was slightly startled. It was true. His tooth had been cracked initially when he'd been pistol whipped on the front step of 221B and spirited away with Sarah, and then later when he'd been thrown from the back of the giant known as Golem, it had finally broken and he'd unintentionally swallowed the piece while sliding across the stage. He was lucky it hadn't hurt.
It was built on a heath that bordered an orchard of trees no one had bothered to identify. Maybe fruit bearing, but who actually cared? Perhaps 'built' was the wrong sort of descriptor for this little imperfect cottage. It looked to be more discarded than anything. Dropped and left to the whims of the edge of the world.
When he spoke he knew that he was not answering her question; but his own in fact.
But just as the High Steward opened his mouth to deny him again, Sherlock's tentative voice called through the door. "Captain?"
"And as these fair and just people stand here today in witness to this ordinance, if anyone, whatever their social status may be, dares directly or indirectly oppose this decision, will find themselves transgressors against the Crown and in so doing will be found guilty of the crime of high treason and will not only incur our grave indignation as well as the punishment of the already condemned, but also a much more final and exacting sentence."
The immediacy of his wanting to leave seemed to startle the whole room into action.
"I was still a Sergeant when it all happened, so that would make it, what, back in the eighties? /Jesus/, that's been a while. I only heard it through the grapevine around the office, but the story goes that Gregson took up the Powers' case and immediately decided that it had been an accident, based on evidence. Totally open and shut. Nothing outrightly suspicious. And I guess it makes sense; young kid in a pool, has a conniption, gets water in his lungs and goes down like a rock. Happens more than you'd think.
He didn't notice the eerie silence that descended on the scene until moments later. When he looked up, everyone was staring at Sherlock, who was staring at him.
William's lip had trembled at that, clearly a sign that John had done something sweet and unexpected and John had had to look away again to keep from collapsing inwards.
let's see. what else?
"Maybe. I mean, how come you never treat him with open derision like Donovan and Anderson? You've got to be tempted sometimes." He felt Lestrade's eyes fall onto him and turned. "You're always so collected."
Poorly aimed throws of shit and mud splattered against the heavy wood. Some of the hard soft fruits and vegetables tumbling away benignly.
"Yes. I do hope. It's been a pleasure." John said somewhat regretfully. He was nervous to see the jovial fellow go. But it gave him a sense of hope to know that he was not far away, should anything happen.
Mycroft seemed to fight a smile in his lips at that. "Those kinds of laws are only afforded to the Americans, Dr. Watson. However much I wish I could simply snap my fingers and have Moriarty wiped from existence, it's simply not doable."
To put his hands on the Prince and feel life flowing through him again was everything that Charles had wanted. But he needed to know for certain that the companion assigned to keep his treasure safe was merely an advantageous addition and not anything else.
The High Steward had tried everything he could. Every physician had been summoned from in and around the Kingdom. All of them either making up a diagnosis or outright admitting that they had no idea as to what could be happening. There had even been a time amidst all these visits when so much blood had been drained from his body that Sherlock was sure that the next time he fell asleep, he would not wake again.
"How do you know?"
Two long, broad trestle tables had been set up against the left and right side of the room, their whole lengths taking up the entire breadth of each wall and both of them almost entirely encumbered with an absolute calamity of objects.
Three stories below, the late London morning trundled by in its necessity and the two men in love stayed pressed to one another, without any want to take part.
weekend updates might falter from here on out as I've had these first three chapters written for a little bit and now i'm onto partial chapter write-ups and piece togethers. though the main plot is solid and now it's all down to specifics and dialogue.
"No." John said after a beat. "I suppose not."
They remained like this for a very long while, breathing at each other, taking their cues from one another, not breaking the moment until Sherlock regained his strength enough to raise two fingers to press against John's neck - the ones he'd had buried deep into John's arse just before - to take his pulse, and John could only snort in surprise as he realized it was no surprise at all.
The texts he sends back and forth to Sherlock before descending into the entrance of Baker Street tube station are simple. Anemic, almost. Stripped of everything but the essential data:
John found himself pierced to the quick and panting heavily again because of it. Barely gathering enough focus to lift his head and see what had stopped him. But Sherlock was just looking at him, watching his eyes through the mirror and waiting for John to react. That wicked little grin still curling the corner of his mouth telling him so. John felt perfectly corked.
Sherlock's brilliant eyes stayed closed as he set his forehead against John's, his hands still holding John's face. "If I could give us one night, would you take it?" He whispered desperately. His voice deeper than John had ever heard it.
I imagine Caddyshack's love for history allowed John to answer the random question in 'The Great Game' where Janus is revealed to mean "the god with two faces."
Brother Michael let out a great guffaw at that. His long-practiced hand snatching out to steady his spectacles as he chuckled. "Oh, no nonono. I have not come for that..."
He managed to utter this just as the kestrel began unspooling the thrush's intestines.
and sex between the two lovelies is just one chapter away so don't wander too far! :D thanks very much for sticking with me!
He bent his head until the scars on his back threatened to tear open. Until he was so near to kissing the stone floor in veneration that his breath, now coming in strident lungfuls, stirred the dust around them. The scent of this man pervaded John's every sense. His visage burned brightly in his retinas. His nostrils and mouth full of his taste and smell.
Charles watched Sherlock's face as he uncoupled the main piece from the second piece. Guiding his balls one at a time back through the ring to hang unimpeded in their sac. He very nearly chuckled when he felt Sherlock's hands take hold of his shoulders for balance (the only time he would ever willingly touch Charles as he always purposely positioned him where there was nothing else to grab onto) and his legs automatically spread next in anticipation for the removal. "Always so impatient." He chided and reveled in the flush of color that overtook Sherlock's cheeks.
"Lorazepam, right? Same as the last one?" Lestrade muttered, coming forward.
Sherlock swallows. His eyes betraying him. He takes a step forward and puts his hands out. "Then take me. Eat me if you like. Feed me to your dog or turn me over to Moriarty. But leave John alone."
Sherlock had his head buried in the side of John's neck, hot breaths ghosting out across his sternum. His long, lithe fingers rubbed themselves compulsively through the dips between his ribs. Sherlock remained obstinately silent. Not having moved from the confines of John's arms for even a moment.
Sherlock snorted in a soft, warm laugh before lapsing back into the silence. And did not speak again.
"Haven't the faintest. But I think that was definitely the quickest one you've ever done. As long as you didn't let yourself peek beforehand. Did you? Nah. That would go against your rules, I think" John asked. "How long had you guys been waiting there?"
They went to the Lady of the Manor (who was in charge of thiers and all the surrounding land at that time) when they were both of age at sixteen seeking her consent to marry. But the Lady would not give her consent. Instead, she had had her eye fixed upon William to become her own son's husband. And lacking all alacrity, she had refused them.
The course ginger scraggle that had once been a mess about his face was now shaped and trimmed into a handsome beard and swept-back hairstyle that let his stunning pale features push forth.
alright. lots of notes:
Another piece was tossed at a shorter distance next. The bird waiting, turning its head at him carefully before hopping forward again to grab it. Not moving back this time.
William and John slowed their horses, eager to take in all the sights and smells and general racket of what surrounded them. Everything from cart stands to fully erected buildings lined every road and pedaled their wares and services through signs and shouting.
He comes closer. Hands reaching. Reaching for the Union Jack neck man's jacket. Missing as he darts around sharply and scrambles up a curving flight of stairs. They are climbing. Climbing. C l i m b  i   n   g.
Hearing no further argument, John snatched back the Belstaff as they went by and was manhandling Sherlock up into the back of the truck parked on the bank, waving off any assistance from the EMTs and gratefully taking a gowpen of cracked chemical heating packs in return. He asked about warming fluids for an IV to keep in mind should the need arise before the doors clanged shut behind him.
The octopus seemed to pull an optical illusion at that moment, suddenly half way above and half way below the last tank on the top right. The small fish inside swam down into the farthest corner in an effort to escape, but it was of no use. With a quick splay and short chase the octopus dropped through, and enveloped the trapped creature with nothing more than a slosh of water and slight shake of the shelf frame.
John hummed in surprise when Sherlock's hands fell to his hips and he began guiding John forward while he stepped backwards across the room, careful to never let their mouths part.
The circled hand about his cock cinched more tightly, pulling him more keenly, while those three fingers behind seemed to fill up his entire posterior as they were splayed out and buried deep inside as he thrust back. Never leaving him, never faltering. Remaining the vehicle for his pleasure for all the time he needed and in the crescendo of sound emitted from his groaning throat and slurping arse and thumping bones and the IRREVOCABLE PULL of those ludicrous eyes in the mirror brought everything all at once into a beautiful cornucopia of moment that took him straight up the to peak of orgasm and finally cast him straight off the cliffside.
"Gladstone. Sit."
Finally settled, curled up around his legs, John looked up at him expectantly.
"Oh. Great." Lestrade's tan face was flushing darkly and he tugged at his collar. "Well, I always sort of wondered...er, I mean...I was just a bit gobsmacked, before, when I saw you two...y'know? But it could work." He nodded numbly, motivating himself to say what he'd apparently been rehearsing in his head when he'd seen John coming down the hall. "For what it's worth, I'm happy for you John. You and Sherlock both. I'm not gonna say he deserves you or that you deserve him, because, well it's /Sherlock/, but I guess what I think doesn't matter 'cause you two work well together, right? I mean, who else could stand to live with him? Ah, I'm making a cock-up of this. Let me try again."
"Quite recently. Yesterday, in fact."
"A sentiment we seem to both agree upon." Sherlock said haughtily. "Shall I begin?" Taking his own cue, Sherlock crouched down with a familiar flip of his coat, adjusted his prophylactic gloves. The leather in his shoes groaned angrily and he waited at least for Greg's customary shrug.
"Your knighthood would surely disagree with you." The monk's jolliness seemed unflappable. "But oh! where are my manners? I am brother Michael of St. Bartholomew's Church and I have been sent on a mission of great importance."
Sherlock slid in front of John to examine it for himself, still silent, and John made it a point to acknowledge Molly's contribution with a nod. She smiled sweetly at him. He liked Molly Hooper. She was a good egg.
But he had done what his brother had said. He was doing it still.
Oh. Then again maybe not. He'd forgotten his own room was currently occupied.
He clasped his hands on the bartop and cleared his throat. "Want to elaborate on why it is we're here? For real this time. If this is for the case, a /closed/ case as was my understanding of it, it might be helpful to let me in on whatever bit of evidence there is that's got you convinced it's worthwhile for us to come here."
"Mandy?" John was utterly perplexed, looking to Sherlock for explanation.
By July he would have this furlong bristling with barley for the winter crop. And for the first full year since he had worked it, a larger portion of his harvest would be his. Now that he was a freeman. No longer a serf to the Lord of the Manor. No longer a slave to be encumbered with taxes and tithes so steep they broke his soul as much as the work broke his back. He was now a master of the lands and the home he kept.
She considered this for a moment, looking at Sherlock's back and deciding it was probably true. "Alright. Just so long as it makes its way OUT of the flat soon, I'd appreciate it. Lord knows it's the least foul thing I've had in here, though it certainly holds the distinction of being the first /live/ animal that's been dragged in here. Such awful creatures. I remember my best friend Margaret had a budgie when we were girls and it made the most OBNOXIOUS--" She suddenly noticed the stack of vinyls. "What are you doing with all these then?"
Wiping the tears from his eyes with a wet hand, John nodded solemnly and began.
"Why not? It might be interesting. Don't you want to know what makes me tick? You have to be tempted. True knowledge right at your fingertips. Sherlock Holmes fleshed out for your perusal. If our positions were reversed...well, a full dossier would just ice the cake." There was the tiniest note of bitterness to the words that swelled of smugness. Willing John to take the bait. The snake offering the apple.
"Excellent." Sherlock beamed. Into John's hands he dropped the giant tome without any warning at all and it was only by chance that John was able to catch it.
John sat back finally, unable to garner anything more. When he spoke on his confusing findings aloud, he was met with the most minimal of hums. A small flick of his eyes had him following the sea glass gaze which was looking back up to the bridge.
"What was he like before I moved in?" They turned the corner into the cereal aisle and walked all the way down it, not needing anything particularly.
Mycroft slithered through an answer in his usual way. "My brother has denied himself countless things in order to survive in this world, Dr. Watson. But the few things he has chosen to indulge in, he allows to utterly consume him. The violin, his various chemical dependencies, his work. There is no such thing as halfway for him. I feel it pertinent that you should understand this.
There it was, right when he'd dropped his defenses. John tensed minutely. "Y-yes but--" He made to turn, to face his accuser directly, but Sherlock had crowded in, effectively trapping him in.
He licked his lips and focused on the partial corpse instead.
And to the East of the east lower river grew unchecked the Royal Forest of Baskerville, forbidden to all but those with special dispensation. Rumored to be full of ghosts and magic and all sorts of mysterious things.
"I needed a better understanding of my adversary." Sherlock said in a small voice as if this had been ready as an answer for a very long while. "Why he was--"
"Of course you did." John said, softhearted for all his strife. "With eyes as beautiful as yours, who could blame you? They're like crystals that see into souls."
John was consumed by him. Body and soul.
John finally met his eyes then, looking him straight through. "If you want anything to EVER happen between us EVER you will shut the fuck up right now Sherlock Holmes!" John warned, absolutely ready to rip the sink off the wall if anything more were to come to light.
He took the stairs patiently, half by choice and half in exhaustion. It had been a VERY long day and night, after all. But he looked forward to what was waiting for him inside the flat. His stomach fluttering.
This must be King Mycroft and Lord Gregory, John thought, as he passed them by. The true men who ruled here.
As time passed, the silence continued to seep around them until it fills not only the room, but also John's self as well. And for the first time in a long time his head was quiet. His heart was quiet. And he was content to set his eyes upon the sky beyond the iron window with his Prince and watch the clouds drift by. With no want to be anywhere else.
The High Steward took his liberties now with new fervor, all the while keeping his eyes on Sherlock, satisfying himself that he could find absolutely no deception.
John squinted at his dark curls more closely, trying to find the angle. He pushed the issue further. "So were you going to have them out today? I can find you a box to put them in, maybe give Molly a call--" anything to move the process along.
The Queen Mother's eyebrows raise a little, her voice sly. "Talk? And just what is it precisely that you would like to talk about I wonder?"
And the look he got when those lime green eyes finally met his during that slow press of scooping hips and gentle  caresses that ached in their tenderness was that of Sherlock Holmes giving off some sort of fantastic radiation, and John Watson being the only ordinary man able to absorb it.
After all, they were his; they'd agreed.
After, they had all watched in wonder as the cow and her new calf became acquainted and marveled as the little thing grew. And to their utter astonishment, continued to grow and survive into spring.
Nearly overwhelmed with the vivace canter of his heartbeat and the mad rush of escaping blood making him dizzy, John was awestruck. His voice barely a sound as he fought to reclaim his breath.  "That was amazing..."
Sherlock pulled his phone from his own pocket, his mouth slightly open in excitement. His fingers tight.
"Obstructing what? Where's your evidence? Did you know we were obstructing something John? We can get out of the way of the door, if that's what you're implying."
The second day of silence passed without note. Sherlock remained absent from the flat. Except that when John woke up, a cup of tea was sitting by his bedside. Frowning mutinously, John opened his throat and slugged back the whole abysmal mess in one swallow. If that silent shit was going to keep making shite tea, John wasn't going to be the lesser man and not drink it.
"I can't sleep." John divulged when the silence swarmed again and Sherlock nodded without looking. He couldn't sleep either, obviously. The insomniacs of Baker Street were on the prowl.
He burrowed his face sharply into Sherlock against the sting of rising tears, like he could hide in the depths of his thin ribcage, press painlessly through his sternum and take refuge next to his heart. Chastising himself. "Christ if that doesn't make me sound like a twat."
That it wasn't insignificant at all.
"We don't." Sherlock growls playfully and the rumble in his voice is so deep it drops straight into John's groin and goes molten.
Crime and punishment suddenly became the new laws of the land.
Taking his cue from the High Steward, John remained absolutely silent as he followed him up the endlessly turning stairs. He counted the turns in his head (to occupy himself more than anything) one wall torch to each level of the tower. Each one leading him closer.
John let the air punch out of him, sweeping right past the shock and hurtling straight on to honest curiosity, tinged with a bit of incredulity. "How do you know I only got on with blokes in Afghanistan?"
Would it be possible for John to maybe bribe them...?
"It's your /pride/ that's holding you back, isn't it? Your ridiculous, unfathomable pride."
"It certainly would be worth considering. Organ trafficking is quite a lucrative endeavor." Sherlock agreed.
"You're tampering with the data." Came a rumble against his arse cheeks, followed by an understanding kiss and another lave and then, suddenly, a partial trepanning. John yelled out in surprised delight and threw his palms back over his face as he relinquished himself to the sensational crash of arousal sweeping over him like a tsunami. A single hard pulse through his loins brought the full ache of blood to his prick.
He was building momentum now, a train bereft of its tracks. "I demand myself to deny all human inhibitions and yet I cannot deny this however hard I may try. And oh believe me how I have tried. But I NEED you with me John Watson, for all your shortcomings. As much as I need blood and air. As much as I require the /Work/. And for your part you would follow me into the seventh circle of hell because you are a blind and stupid idiot. And I CANNOT allow that. Do you see?" His colour in his eyes turned neon, lighting up his face like the Ark of the Covenant opening.
it's a bit hurried through the boys being absent of each other i know. but i want them to be together and i want to highlight only the important stuff. i'm trying a new writing technique where i don't blather on and on about nothing integral to the plotline. we'll see how well that works out. :} you guys and gals and nonbinarys all fucking rock!
Charles was brushing his lips back and forth over the corner of Sherlock's jaw now. Gentling Sherlock back as he resurfaced from the depths of his mind. He was murmuring to him beneath his breath, pecking soft kisses as he whispered dark words. Reveling in the way Sherlock's body had broken out into goose flesh. "Death is everywhere, my lambkin. All around you. Swift and blind in its taking. And in times of war it is far less likely to promise back the ones who leave us. It will do you well to remember that. Shut up here safely in your tower where the war will never reach you. . ."
The door had been left open to allow the light in and what was left of it was beginning to bruise into night. The monk's horse stood snuffling at the dirt by the doorway, trying in vain to find a nibble of grass.
John only barely remembered the church he spoke of from his brief visit. It had been a small stone building standing beneath Castle Appledore's imposing granduer, looking about as important as a pebble does at the foot of a mountain. "I'm not interested in joining the order, if that's why you're here."
Molly was fighting her lips from coming apart, her clipboard striving to keep her hands occupied as her eyes flicked excitedly to Sherlock every now and again, as if she was on the verge of blurting out the answer. John and Lestrade simply looked upon the gore like the world's two most put-upon men.
It had been only a short stop at the Manor to collect him, merely long enough to gather up his and another horse for brother Michael before they were off again.
Sherlock flexed his mouth in a somewhat answer, off kilter for the second time tonight, unable to find the words. The tip of his large nose was burnished to a rosy pink and he was folded more tightly into his coat. The cold was finally getting to him.
translated it means 'the elixir of love'. I feel this song in my bones when I listen to it. hopefully you will too.
He only spoke when the man finally deigned to lock desperate eyes with him once more.
"I suppose I can see how bacteria could be so offensive to you. But honestly, if it's going to vex you so much, next time you make an agreement with someone, I would recommend including all possible variables within the parameters and systematically eliminating them from consideration.
And the man opened his eyes.
"Um, well, yes. If it goes well and we choose to keep sleeping with each other." The term 'lover' squeezed something hard in John's chest.
John fought the first sickening thought that came to him concerning those particular symptoms, looming large in his mind as they were in conjunction with the bullseye's-worth hole gaping in his wallet and precisely why he'd left Sherlock alone almost an hour ago flashing in his memory. But he chewed his worry down into submission and made himself believe that Sherlock had simply come from a very hot, very loud room. Nothing else. He trusted him.
From the folds of his tabard, brother Michael produced a small scroll of parchment spun between two black rods. Finally unveiling the true cause for his mission. Its seal was a thick black dollop of wax that had been pressed with the insignia of the basilisk, a symbol known far and wide to belong to the Royal Holmes' Family.
With his RAMC mug freshly cleaned and the coffees mixed accordingly, John turned back and set Sherlock's cup down beside him, leaning in to give a peck to Sherlock's temple and stayed when he felt Sherlock lean into it.
the location of the headless body was originally suppose to have been Littlebrook Pier. because the pictures of it I found online looked PERFECT as a location. however, later I realized that when I went to find it on a map (which I should have done in the first place) it was way the hell outside of London and not in a good spot for my story so we're just gonna pretend that Battersea Bridge has the same kind of access to the river. mkay? next time i'll research better.
"He...Victor was very encouraging of my work, which was still in its infancy at the time. He did, after everything that happened, inspire me to put my methods to more profitable use. Though I suspect now that his yearly invitations to the manor were more a means to keep an eye on me and my chemical use, rather than in want of my direct company. To this day it would not surprise me to learn of Mycroft having some involvement in the whole matter.
The lights in the flat were off when he stepped in. Only a small sliver of yellow glowed from beneath Sherlock's door. But when John knocked there was no answer.
John turned on his heel in an instant and let his embarrassment eat him. Better to focus on that than what precisely it was he was hearing: the sound of urine being excreted into a glass container.
"I required something that contained no alcohol in its ingredients." Sherlock says. Folding all of the discarded clothes neatly into a pile.
He smirked as he found John staring unabashadly at him, hands frozen in the midst of sliding loose buttons, still besocked. "Do you require assistance?" He asked with a cocked eyebrow and sprang when John only nodded in reply.
"Where's his right kidney?"
"There are only two ways of escaping this dungeon," Sherlock continued. "Either I cede my hand in marriage to the High Steward or throw myself from the window."
"Do you require use of the closed stool?" Charles asked, indicating to the box with a hole cut into its padded velvet top one of the servants had brought up. It was a portable toilet that was always brought to him for use, as he could not leave his solar to use the garderobe.
"Right." John turned back to his book, glad that he'd said what he'd wanted to and now it was over. "Good."
Sherlock sighed again, almost a growl, while they all shifted against his genius like barley in a breeze. "Why must you always insist on never seeing what is NOT HERE! Where's his coat? Nobody in there right mind would come out in this weather dressed as insufficiently as this. Not if they were being driven. And there's the lack of money, identification, and Oyster card in any of his pockets. So, again, /missing/ evidence that CLEARLY means something to us. What his mode of transportation was.
Sherlock stood still and allowed Charles to peel the linen shirt from his torso. Slide the braies down his thin thighs. Not looking as Charles stepped back to admire his nudity. As he did every time they did this. Surveying the slim lines of his body. The higher ratio of jutting bone to soft curves.
"See there?" Sherlock pointed to the green swell of the Royal Forest of Baskerville, which took up the entire East side of the East Lower River. And realizing himself, helped John adjust the looking glass so that he could see it too.
And he took a moment to laugh at himself.
"No."
"King Mycroft of Appledore does hereby hold unto favour John Watson of Umberland of the North in his Oath of Fieldty to the Crown for service.
Their mouths were a crash of heat and soft sounds.
Charles shrugged minutely, amending his statement. Thinly veiled though it was. "Ah. Then we find ourselves in agreement. I find both sides to be quite . . . able." His heresy to the crown had become far more open now that the War had taken more than six years to end. His rule had the uncomfortable feeling of beginning to feel permanent.
Sherlock nodded. "It was necessary for the buy in. The Sebastopol commission is to make up for that loss though."
"Really?"
Unable to resist temptation, John pressed his pinkie finger delicately into one of the heads, triggering the hairs, and engaging its little jaws to shut. Afterward, he felt just the littlest bit cruel for leaving it go hungry.
"Take it easy Sherlock. That's not at all what I meant. I'm just trying to understand." John cut in calmly, doing his best to ignore the sharp flint in Sherlock's voice. Knowing it was misguided. "All I meant was that YOU being how you are. Like how you've probably been all of your life. All..." he waved his hand broadly in the direction of what he couldn't find words to describe. Allowing it to represent the way Sherlock's tailored pants caught tightly around his one thigh casually thrown over the other. How he had his sky colored shirtsleeves rolled neatly up to his elbows, buttons straining to hold together across his broad, flat chest. Most pointedly including that fluted, delicate wrist slowly twisting the fat glass of scotch around in rhythmic loops, letting riptides of amber roll around its curves. Absolutely unable to put that into words.
"Piss off!" John smashed open his bedroom door, and what he had thought to be his night's crescendo suddenly reached another exsacerbating peak:
"Somewhere new Harry." John'd said with sweat still prickled on his brow, still testing the complaints of his body in the automated bed. The bitter screams of his perforated shoulder that he could blame for the tears in his eyes. "Somewhere I don't know. I need to get out of London as fast as I can." Even though he'd just got here.
Sherlock gives a quick glance at his arms, assessing, before holding his face in his hands. "One is...possibly. But the other one's just dislocated. That's why it won't move. I'm going to put it back in. Alright? It'll feel better in a minute."
"A fire axe?!" Lestrade and Molly gawped at the same time.
"These were a gift." Brother Michael went on about the roll as John pulled out a vial that had managed to catch his eye. He held it up to the light of the fire where it seemed to come alive. In it was a viscous golden liquid that was slow to move when he tipped it. It was as though someone had taken the sunshine and melted it down. When he was encouraged to unstopper it and to sniff it, it was heavy with sweetness.
John took up the mug and held it beneath his nose. It smelled homey and earthy, with a tinge of something sugary. English Breakfast, he guessed, but when he went to drink it, he pulled back with a sneer at the first mouthful.
"He was face down in the water when we found him that morning. There was nothing we could have done." Miles' words as he finished speaking were solemn, but more contemplative than sad. Long ago having come to terms with the inevitability of it. He was spinning his mostly empty wine stem on the bar top between his fingertips, both men focused on the soft scrape of glass on glass as if it were a metaphor for something they couldn't explain. "I don't think I blame him, really. But I don't know if I would have had his courage y'know? Doing it like that. Choosing to end it in that way. I suppose he wasn't wrong, it's what he wanted, anyway. I mean, it was his life. His choice ultimately."
"There were two men inside the compound, an older man and a younger one. Lieutenant Murray was our translator, big fucking surprise. When we interrogated the men, they told us they were farmers, but their hands were too soft to have done any farming. And the younger man had just shaved his head; the suicide bombers do that, to cleanse themselves before Jihad. We arrested the younger man as a HVI under suspicion and called in the ANP for pickup. We were headed out to the road to meet them when it happened.
Sherlock, of all damned things, smiled. "Then consider this arrangement elementary."
Opening his eyes, John looked down upon that which he had just plundered. Sherlock's rouge was smeared illicitly across his swollen lips. A large blot of pale skin shown through his white powder. John was seeing this man's naked flesh for the first time ever and his only thought was that he wanted more.
"Am I making you uncomfortable?" Sherlock asked.
"Give you what Sherlock? What do you need?"
John cleared a space through the condensation on the mirror with one swipe from his palm, creating a stripe by which he could glance surreptitiously back over his shoulder and see that Sherlock had remained stubbornly in place, staring straight ahead at the empty space John had moved from, lost in thought. No doubt reaching into that special alcove in his Mind Palace where he kept the most eviscerating words he could find.
"But you didn't finish. Why?" His deep baritone sounded entirely unaffected.
But what he uncovered inside was worth all his effort.
It started as all other days in this hellish prison had. The quiet knock. The screaming bolt. And the absolute revulsion when the High Stewards' gaunt form slithered in first.
The monk lowered the scroll, taking in John's knitted eyebrows and perplexed frown. "I understand that this is all a bit abrupt," brother Michael said gently, putting a hand upon John's knee for comfort, "but I am pleased to tell you that this has all been arranged. Your approval is the very last part of my mission. Your sister and her wife, when I met them, have already been informed of your leaving and have given their blessings most heartily.
John turned the page. "Corpus callosum."
The prisoner's face was sunken and deathly pale. The rags that stood in place of clothes were hanging from his gangly body.
John tried to come up with a good answer. "Your brother's something else entirely."
By all accounts, he shouldn't have been in such a nice mood. But he found he couldn't help himself. He was glad to be home again. Glad to have things back as they should be. Glad to be alive. And that overshadowed all the rest.
He shooed at the feathered vagrant with a desperate flap of his hand, finally compelling the little thing to light back up upon the V of the missing pane and look out into the sky. Tittering at him as if in complaint and farewell.
The pliers relent instantly and slide out from John's mouth, followed by a backwash of saliva that sluices straight for his throat. John splutters and coughs, trying not to choke and despite feeling like he's drowning, his joy rises first to the surface.
Do as he says. Whatever he says. Stand against him and you will find yourself standing against me.
"Whatever it is, it's certainly not from a dry cleaners." He shuffled the irritant to the back of his mind to unconsciously think on with a sigh. "The corpse had been wearing the suit for at least ten hours before he died. Factoring in conduction of heat against the temperature of the street he was lying on as it affected Algor mortis...what?"
And just like that, he made slow, sweet, delicate love to the man he loved on the sitting room floor.
"I'll fix this. Just let me fix this!" She swore and he blinked some more and shifted on his cane as she flew out the door before sitting himself down in that worn sick chair and watched her go. She couldn't fix this with or without the shakes. But the door had stayed open and had left him the perfect view of his new burial ground.
"But the killer's been caught." John found himself protesting, then immediately reprimanding himself.
"Ooo! What is it?" Mrs. Hudson asked excitedly, her hands clasped before her. Her little feather quaking on her hat.
"All you are to her is a label: 'John Watson, war hero, with PTSD.' As though it could define you." He used air quotes as he said it, not yet noticing the flush of embarrassed pride crawling up John's neck. "Would you deign to guess the title of this travesty? 'From War Zone to Zen.' Utter /vile/. Her vocational apathy should not be allowed to-- what?" He was brought up short in his tirade, perplexed by the grin that was splitting John's face. He hadn't even gotten to the obvious trouble with the doctor's shoulder, but he let the point ghost away.
John swallowed audibly.
"/Bad/, Sherlock. This is bad because they've been murdered--" John tried, but was ignored.
"Hoo hoo." Mrs. Hudson announced herself at the top of the stairs like an owl in the customary way of her perfect timing. Her manners as sharp and sweet as a sugar crystal. "Good morning Sherlock, how are you today?"
Sherlock immediately noticed that the photo was worn at the edges as he took it. It was softly tattered from being held for long whiles in oily fingers. Taken in a portrait format were two young men standing center in the front of a baked mud wall.
He pulled a face and glanced down the hall to Sherlock's door once more, a picture entering his head of Sherlock poised on the other side, silently reveling in John's continued misery. Finding himself the victim in yet another conundrum, John dutifully gulped down as much of the saccharine tea as he could manage before dumping the dregs of it into the sink. He couldn't manage it all. It was simply too ghastly.
His left hand crawled like a large, white spider. Jumping into memorized positions, pressing and twisting, and finding every perfectly timed note until it became a dance of long digits with no body attached. The notes yawned back on themselves, changing from a mad scrabble at times to dripping like liquid at others. All the while looking as if they took no effort at all.
Sherlock was curled around him like a cephalopod. Long arms twined tight around the bulk of John's chest, his hands willfully captured in John's fists as he'd slept or in the time that he'd assumed he'd been asleep. John knew by the interrupted breathing on the back of his neck that Sherlock was awake. "Sherlock?"
John's mouth quirked. "What kind of meetings take place in the middle of the night?"
Sherlock's adamant voice broke into his perusal.
It was not until that fateful visit to Castle Appledore some weeks before, that he laid eyes upon the most glorious creature he had ever seen in all his twenty-seven years of life. It was the only thing in all that land that could convince him that there was   hope   enough to still yet to live again.
John sighed in annoyance. "Well, maybe it's because I have to deal with the symptoms of it enough at work and we're not exactly set up with secure laboratory conditions in there. But maybe it's mostly because I don't fancy risking myself to exposure if I need to use the dinner table." His voice was growing in volume and he checked himself before it could leave him yelling. "Look. I think it'd just be better if you took this particular one to Bart's. Okay? Do your experiment there."
Their main dining area had been overtaken as a laboratory long before he'd even moved in and he saw no point in trying to change it now. Keeping his roommate's inquisitive nature confined to a centralized location was enough of a formidable challenge and he relegated himself to stopping the spread of experiments from taking over every flat surface of their kitchen as much as he could.
"Interested to know how I know?" He pointed to the offending shoulder. "The red discoloration that usually accompanies the hypertrophic keloid scarring with an injury of that particular violence has long since faded. Applying the median time principals for a wound like that with its rate of matrix healing, it can take anywhere from three weeks to almost a year to heal. In your case, as you were honorably discharged back in May, I believe you were postponed in hospital for somewhere close to ...three months longer than expected. But why? Why? What could it have been? Wait, wait. Don't tell me..."
"Then take it."
"That long? Jesus." John had remarked, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. "And you slept, I hope."
Gonna love you baby, here I come again./
John approaches him, tilting up his chin as he gets closer, sizing this larger man up and making sure to look at him in both his eyes. Letting him see that John H. Watson former Captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and friend/colleague/blogger/lover of the World's Only Consulting Detective is not afraid.
When he looked up again, Sherlock was sorting out two different types of nails into zinc and copper piles and had a mess of alligator clips set before him. Oblivious to John's sudden feelings of quiet outrage, acting as if nothing had even happened, as of their lives hadn't been in danger at all. And it made John angrier.
John remembered what Sherlock had said about the peculiar smell of the Mr. Jones' suit and subtly leaned over the table for a cautious whiff, drawing back with no more insight than he had had before, though curled his lip slightly at the sickly barbeque smell he inhaled instead.
"John?" He leaned in closer, their breaths hot and musky and curling together sweet and rich, imbued with scotch and possibility. "May I?"
It had started as a whisper among the crowd. Mouths falling agape as the secret spread, before climbing in volume and growing more damning with each gasp as someone new recognized him and harkened others to see. Some had hid their astonishment behind surprised hands, their eyes wet and afraid as if he were a ghost risen from the ground.
When he looked up, Sherlock was looking straight at him over his shoulder. His hair a wild dark tangled corona about his head. His lips and chin scraped raw from John's stubble. His sunken eyes so sad it made something deep in John's belly go cold. The sex felt suddenly like an apology.
"Perhaps you'll be interested to learn that it's not just any old fish, John." Sherlock handed him his laptop, sharing the information he'd brought up. The page showed a similar picture to the one he'd seen earlier with some descriptive paragraphs off to the side. The little banded red and white fish was swimming against a natural background of bright, thick limbed sea stars and purple rocks. "/Centropyge boylei/ or more commonly known as the 'Peppermint Angelfish'.  It's found in the steep seaward reefs of the South Pacific at depths of fifty-five to one hundred and twenty meters where it is collected by hand."
John is awakened abruptly by a sudden crash that thunders through the sitting room. It takes him a moment to realize that he's on his feet with the blankets pooled around his socked ankles and can't seem to understand why there's plaster dust gently floating through the slanting sunbeams.
"Alright." Sherlock finally surrendered, then had an idea. "But...only if you'll join me?"
Sherlock hummed in appreciation.
"You never think you're going to get it back so you lash out. I suppose I should have recognized it sooner, being a doctor and all." He reached across the table and squeezed Sherlock's wrist companionably, before taking back his chopsticks. He winced a little at Sherlock's blank face. "It's not coming out right, I know. But what I'm trying to say, is that...is that I understand. Okay? The rush, the climax, the free fall afterward. It can be overwhelming to think you're ever going to achieve it again. But you will. We will. I promise. It'll be fine."
His voice rolled like thunder now. "Putting aside the fact that you would have to explain the cause of your scar, in effect exposing your life choices to criticism, the only remaining explanation is that it is simply because you don't know if you possess the necessary stamina to fulfill the needs and desires of a lover. You're operating under the false assumption that women will consider you to be an upstanding gentleman by holding back, when in reality you have shamed yourself into thinking that any offering but the absolute best during your first consummation would be considered a failure.
And true to both their expectations, it's over in a moment.
John groaned as Sherlock slid his body closer, bare feet bracketing shoes, sharp bones pushing against firm muscle pushing against hard counter. John's erection slotted neatly into the space between Sherlock's strong thighs and caused him to tremble when Sherlock began to grind subtly against him with upward inflections.
Looking up the taut length of John's body, he met the doctor's eyes and smiled when John licked his lips. His Adam's apple bobbing tenuously. He was going to have to keep John focused on the physicality of what they were about to do and not let him slip into self-consciousness. Or John would quickly lose his nerve and perceive it as his feared inadequacy.
It would probably be best to let that one simmer, John would figure it out eventually. "Doesn't matter. Never mind."
Molly, of course, was delightfully oblivious. "Sherlock! You're looking much better. I mean, not that you didn't before. I just meant, well, you always look good--"
John sipped at his tea and chewed slowly, feeling suddenly silly halving the little butty when he could shove the whole thing into his mouth in one go. But he knew his manners. So he shifted uncomfortably some more and flexed the pained crackle out of his left fingers as inconspicuously as he could. He didn't enjoy feeling so unmoored, though there were a lot of things about his new life here that he was learning that he would simply have to grow accustomed to.
Aware that the silence had gone on for too long, John struggled for something to say."If you have summoned me here to have an opinion on art, my Lord, I fear that I have none."
Shutting off the taps and squaring his shoulders, John parted the curtains and stepped out with as much casualness as he could muster when he had finished.
"Hardly." Sherlock snorted derisively.  "You merely startled it before. Approach calmly this time and you won't have a problem."
She gave a sympathetic pout at the state of him before heading towards the kitchen for the kettle, speaking to him through the open French doors. "I'm going to have a word with that boy when he gets back. He should be here taking care of you not beetling off into the night to-- wait," she reconsidered, "maybe he'll just want to experiment on you in this state, knowing how curious he is. Perhaps it is better that he's stepped out."
He nodded when Sherlock paused again.
A dark shape circled the sky above him as he bent, blotting out the sun as it grew larger,  closer, spiraling towards the ground. Towards him.
John smiled beautifully and agreed. It was nice to put to rest the worry that Sherlock's reciprocity had been misplaced. That all the one-sided erections had not been for a lack of interest, but simply a misunderstanding. Had Sherlock always been so misunderstood? Certainly John couldn't have been the first to assume.
"The ambulance called...said they were just pulling up to the lift. Should be here any second. Would anyone fancy some coffee? I can make a run--" but down the hall the lift doors pinged and two paramedics wheeled in a gurney with a corpse zipped into a black body bag. "That was quick."
thanks lovelies! you've been great to me.
"AFTER!" John snapped. "It's a sodding corpse! It's not exactly going to go anywhere!"
"Um, yes. Though I'm ...open to not being one. Er, I mean, switching. Or whatever they call it. If you're comfortable with that."
Not in his wildest dreams could he have imagined his body orgasming this much in a twenty-four hour period and still being able to function, post-injury or not. He hadn't felt this virile since he'd been in his late teens and certainly never so satiated in his entire life. And it made him feel foolishly giddy.
"Aha!" He boasts. His hand claps down on the table and he startles himself a bit with the noise. He waves a finger at her rudely. "I've seen you on the telly!"
Sherlock's driver's license was similarly replaced in name only with: 'BRETT, JEREMY W.H.'
He had made a solemn vow then until the end of his life to make it down there one day.
John huffed a laugh out at Sherlock's persistence. "Well ta. You can eat while we listen. Come on." He made back towards the kitchen.
"Uh, if you wish." Sherlock replied after a moment. John took a heartbeat to watch for something contrary to pass in Sherlock's technicolor eyes, to match his tone, but when nothing came he couldn't stop the electric thrill of finally getting the chance to do this from subsuming any lingering hesitation. "How would you like me?"
"Is there a point you're getting to?" John asked, pinning a hand to his hip.
By mid-morning, they had reached the most reassuring landmark that they were not far away from Castle Appledore, merely a few more hours ride : the Diogenes Crossing.
"He certainly did no-" Sherlock began, looking shocked.
The suit John carefully unfolded was ridiculously nice and it laid down well at the pressed creases. He left the suit jacket open to reveal the large strip of half-missing burnt fabric across the back, still stuck with bits of skin.
The snap of Sherlock's magnifying glass opening and closing resumed as the only sound in the room besides the squealing of his wingtips across the buffered floor. Molly shuffled quietly along behind him, filling out her clipboard in  tight, loopy handwriting with the things she observed herself, while John and Lestrade stepped back to allow them more room.
"You think I'm taking advantage of him?"
John had kissed tall men before, not ever having allowed his shorter stature to become a handicap, but with Sherlock  in particular, tipped over him and crowded so close, every bit the wild stallion of a man he could not predict, let alone control, John's knees chose this time to turn into traitorous water.
He tightened his grip and stroked himself deftly, putting his teeth into his bottom lip to dam back any other sort of incriminating noises he might make as he imagined Sherlock penetrating him from the other side. His whipcord body pressed in close. His long thin cock sinking deep into John's body, probing farther than he'd ever been previously explored.
"More." John grinds out and another finger pushes in beside its mate, followed a little while later by another. And with three fingers spoked in his arse, John's body writhes heedlessly to meet them. He feels plumbed clear up to his heartbeat.
Blocks blurred past in silence. The city just starting to wake. Newspapers were being cut out of their binding and set out, hung on the racks of coffee kiosks. John vaguely wondered if Sipe's name were gracing any of their pages but mostly found he didn't care.
"But you ate a grape too Sherlock. He made you." He said, as if Sherlock didn't recall with perfect clarity.
Sherlock huffed. "Look. The only information I lacked was which tooth specifically it had happened to. Considering you've been conscientiously careful to chew your food on the right side of your mouth for the past three days; it would put the time of it occurring somewhere between our confrontation with the Golem and Moriarty abducting you from Baker Street. And as there was no evidence of physical violence to your face when I saw you at the pool; my intuition favors the former. It wasn't solely a fact finding endeavor and hardly the most logical way by which to procure the answer to the question I sought. It was merely a venture into solidifying our symbisism. Besides, there was substantial physical evidence to prove your enjoyment of it so I don't understand while you're contesting it now."
Thunder crashed loudly across the open field and a lightning bolt lit up the sky.
"Is he still fat?" Sherlock asked, his voice a far away thundercloud. His eyes were staring out of the window in deep contemplation.
It had been a long walk up to the Lord of the Manor's front door when the day finally came, three days before his ceremony. The looming, two-story manor house with its peaked roofs and many glass windows were absolutely oppulant compared to John's own. And John was surprised to find himself glowering at William's life now. How differently the twin lives of two dirty boys playing and working and fucking in the fields had turned out.
And John finally figures it out.
Perhaps this was his way of communicating about the way he had acted. John knew he would never go so far as to apologize outright, but maybe he was simply reciprocating for John's tea from last night? Regardless of its intent, the fact of the matter was that a perfectly good cup of tea was sitting within easy reach and John's British integrity wouldn't let that go to waste.
He kept his eyes in front, as he could not look back at William and see pity, of all dreadful things, to be swimming in William's eyes. For him to be accompanying John solely because of guilt seemed anathema.
"No. I can feel you, John. Not yet." He rumbled against the soft flesh beneath John's jaw, then resumed his mouthing. The strong muscles of John's pectinate line dilating around the base of Sherlock's fingers, fighting the buck in his hips. John was too wildly lost to last long enough for that.
"Baby food? For what?" John took the little jars from her perplexed.
Sherlock grinned as the others had the decency to give hisses of shock at the ruination they had uncovered. "There you are!"
"The things I've done. The pain I've caused you John, continuously." Sherlock very nearly growls, so angry with himself. His crystalline eyes are nearly transparent in their naked fear. Tears are beginning to well. "How can you want me to stay with you? How do you trust me? After everything I've done? After doing this to you?" His last words are whispers, nodding his head sadly towards John's arms.
But the worst thing of all and definitely the most unmerciful, was that the water was beginning to lose its lush temperature.
John was already twisting the knob to the door when he remembered that their bathroom was currently playing greenhouse for an array of carnivorous plants. "Alright to move these if I promise to put them back?" He called out into the kitchen.
"I've upset you." He said quietly.
"How much is a kidney worth anyway?" Lestrade inquired, like an afterthought.
"So." Lestrade seemed to find his voice finally as John stared. "You and Sherlock?"
Sherlock's face was still cradled in the cup of John's hand, his thumb mindlessly rubbing back and forth across Sherlock's cheek as they stood there.
"Take my Frank, for example." Mrs. Hudson stopped in front of the curling irons, looking back and forth at the different brands before picking out one, John noticed, with large painted dials. "There was never any trust between us. There was at first, but it later turned out that I was just being naive. I mean, I had NO idea he was fighting all the other drug dealers in our area for turf. And OH! How surprised I was to find out that he was murdering them and feeding their bodies to the alligators!"
But he never did.
oh noes! poor Miles. I borrowed him for the sheer purpose of beating the shit out of him. shameshame. but he's a necessary plot point so I don't feel too bad.
Testing, John kissed him, pleased to feel Sherlock not hesitate to reciprocate and with the encouragement, John's loose arm began to rake trails down the side of Sherlock's torso. Combing his fingers over the ripple of Sherlock's ribcage, into the valley of his waist, and up onto the hillock of his pelvis, stroking it with his thumb. He pressed his body in closer, his own penis warming between them with the prospect of another go.
"Gregson." Sherlock tasted the name as if it were sour. "Yes. Of course." His cool eyes narrowed before smirking minutely.
