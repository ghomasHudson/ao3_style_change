'Oh Sherlock! Are you okay?' she has a broken glass vase on her right hand, and the left grips Anna's gun the way it's supposed to. A hysterical giggle threatens to come up his throat.
That got John’s attention. For the first time since Sherlock started exposing Anna-Greta’s past, John looked at his face. He still looked like shit, and the moderate administration of morphine made him spasm with pain minutely every once and then, fine sweat covering his brow and fists clenching when he wasn’t looking. It would be dramatic to say silence was heavy, but that never actually happened in a hospital. Sherlock’s monitors beeped softly.
'We can get pizza, and there's a documentary on honour killings at 11pm.' Sherlock proposes as they hang their coats. John's watch reads 10:02pm.
After delivering the documents to the client, they walk away from the scene to get a cab and avoid being connected to the stolen bus, and John has a hysterical fit of giggling in the middle of the street. He needs to hold onto Sherlock's bicep as his knees get weak from laughter, and Sherlock follows him suit, circling his shoulders to help him into the cab. They were going for the Tube, but John insisted on a cab as it was getting late and he wanted to be home.
'A guy Alex owned money back then found out about me. He sent me an email, asking for me to cover the debt, now that Alex's dead. So I'll just go to Wales and deal with this. It shouldn't take long.'
John drives very early to avoid central London's traffic at the morning rush time. He's been doing this for three days now, but still has to acclimatise to the huge urban SUV now in his possession. Living in London most of his adult life, and Afghanistan for a good chunk of years, he never really bought a car. They are expensive to acquire and to maintain, nevermind the exhausting traffic when one could just take the tube.
Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective - only one in the world! - has a sweet tooth. He writes on a post-it "Buy some treats to Sherlock" and puts it on his agenda. Then he is taken aback by the date. Tomorrow would be January 6th.
His lacerations were caused by the changing stalls he had been leaning against when the bomb went off. His whole left side had been inflicted, and a piece of wood had wiggled its way into his side. Not deep enough to reach organs, but the skin had been badly torn. Luckily for him, the stall curtain had fallen over his body which mostly protected him from burning injuries.
Everything they needed from the house at Fulham had been taken a year prior, when they moved to 221B and Mary was once again nowhere to be found. That left the place with furniture and all her personal belongings left behind. John doesn't want to go there if it can be avoided, so his lawyer handles all the necessary arrangements. Everything inside is given to donation, eventually, or landed in the trash, if it was unusable or too personal. Since it's past Christmas already, donations do tend to slow down, so he supposes it will be welcomed.
The three scratches on his hand are not showing any sign of receding. Since they are shallow wounds he had assumed in the morning they would be gone. But they are still there, to remind him something will happen. That he has a price to pay for having a wish granted. He's not sure what it is, and the anticipation is eating his stomach from the inside out.
She dated David for two years before getting tired of him. Probably it was not his fault, but all the things that culminated in their relationship. Furthermore, being in Dublin that put her in contact with Moriarty, and she wanted to get rid of all that life. She was so bloody grateful for his disturbance. In addition, the problematic obsession had gone with him. All was perfect.
He descends his hand and finds the band of the towel, which is still around Sherlock's hips and probably dampening the mattress. Feeling very much like a bold teenager, he asks 'Can I?'
He had planned to further try to make Sherlock talk about what Mycroft called "Victor Trevor disaster" which he had refused to. And when Sherlock doesn't want to talk about something, there wasn't a living soul who could convince him otherwise. He is the master of avoidance. The king in changing subjects. Bloody cryptic. Since that afternoon had been a relief in a myriad of aspects, John had let go.
Almost a fortnight after Sherlock Holmes blows up and has the gall to leave John on his own in this world, he gets up and goes out for the first time. Not before locking the door to the living room and Sherlock's room, unless Mrs. Hudson has some funny ideas. He hopes everyone just respects his wishes and stays the hell out of their flat.
'By the clock.' is the bored response. And then with more excitement. 'Her syllables are sounding more refined. I bet she'll be speaking her first words within a month.
'Carla Deprez.' he stops at a red light, and relaxes against the comfortable seat 'She also has a suitcase full of new clothes that don't seem they came from a sale. Latest model of iPhone and iWatch. An iPad she says is for Rosie. Is talking about repainting the house and buying new decor.'
Giving her a bath means he gets all wet too. He announces he's going to take a shower himself after John came back upstairs, sans tart but carrying a Danish pastry from Mr. Chatterjee.
Mary is already on a thin line with LSCB. He started judicial action against her, and she failed to appear in court twice. The social worker had asked him if he had reported missing person on her. He had just replied they are used to her disappearing from time to time. He has evidence she hasn't been present at all since Rosie was a baby, after all. He counts on the Holmes brothers to testify for him in case people start thinking he's a wife murderer.
'I don't have anything to do with that.' her voice has a little note of prospective tearful desperation. 'I don't want that life anymore. I told her when she came here. I didn't have any connection with her.'
She never asked about how to keep someone in love, especially after you hit the bottom of the booze. The divorce had been nothing short of grandiose.
On the tenth day Sherlock is perusing the children's TV shows options. Of course, Rosie is still too young to pay attention to TV, but Sherlock claims it's research so he knows the more adequate material when the proper time arrives. He finds out about Peppa Pig, and to John's consternation, gets fascinated by the cartoon.
to choose the Canary Wharf one today. Sherlock hears the door unlocking from where he stands in the spacious balcony. Through the tall glass window panels of the balcony he can see below him the busy streets of London mid morning.
She crosses her hands in her usual weird way, looking at him with her head tilted to the side. 'Higher income than you ever made it in your life. Good thing one of us could still buy a house.'
Todd Fuller is a stalker, and his behaviour is text-book evolving to dangerous places. Keona had opened two incident reports against him, to no end. Only true desperation would make a lawyer go to him instead of trying the legal way, so he takes her very seriously from the start.
A young woman seats by herself on another bench under the oak trees. Her hand rests un moving on her lower belly, and she’s frowning, looking at the grass, and never at the children playing in the sandbox. Her other hand taps unceasingly at the bench. Sherlock sees her mouth purse minutely. Few weeks into pregnancy, pretty unhappy, heavily considering an abortion.
Having dropped her he goes home. There's still time to take a shower before leaving for work. He will take the bus today instead of cycling. Mary is blow drying her hair when he enters their bedroom.
), steps back and flips down his laptop lid, cutting off the music. Janine doesn't seem worried about a thing. Janine, who was in Sherlock's arms just now.
'That's the problem.' he complains. 'I definitely don't want her doing that. Mycroft already put surveillance there and in the nearby. At the same time we can't warn Anna without disclosing we know about her past with Moriarty. We have to watch her closely.' he then jumps from the sofa. 'And I have lots of files you'd like to see. Such a nasty criminal! Check this!'
Sherlock is trying very hard not to wince, but John can see it. They sit there forever, waiting, until a doctor comes with a chart in her hand. ‘Mr. Watson?’
They stay in silence once more, but it's not companionable this time. The air is pregnant with John's latent wanting to ask something, and Sherlock feels as if he is at the back of a cab once again, showing off to a friend-to-be stranger.. 'You have questions.' he decides for a nostalgic approach.
'She would ask for the right to see the child, and authorities would give her. Everyone is partial to the mother. I don't want my kid to grow up with their mother in prison, can you imagine school?'
'No. Shut up. I always presumed it's petty and childish revenge, however, in the light of this... occurrence, I believe the only thing I can say is I told you so. Hope your drive to London is safe.'
He can feel Diana glaring daggers at his back as he walks out with Mary. He notices she's holding some paper bags, and one from Ted Baker is handed to him when they enter the car.
The cat grants you a wish, but doesn't explain the causal chain to get there. And it's never magical. It just happens.
Mycroft speaks in an alarmed tone, which gathers John's attention. He finally releases himself from Anna, only to finds out Moriarty is back. Mycroft calls Sherlock, and John feels like someone removed a hard weight from his throat because the plane is
They regard each other for a moment, and Mycroft does a concession move with his head. 'Ok then. Dr. Watson, would you see me to the door?'
John pauses to consider this. ‘It’s not that. I’m hoping that she cares enough to do what’s best for our daughter. I know it sounds harsh, but if it’s not on this condition, Anna will go to jail, certainly for life. She won’t be able to raise the child. Do you think it’s fair, for a kid, having to live with her mother in jail?’
‘You don’t have to obey your thoughts. You know you feel threatened by Sherlock’s friend but you also know the threat is not real. While you can allow yourself to feel jealous you don’t have to confront him because of them.’
The next day he convinces Sherlock to eat a tomato risotto with him, quite easily considering. He still has a toffee pudding after, and John joins him gleefully.
'Yeah, sorry. Lovely dinner!' he's speaking in the manner he reserves for obstructive clients. John and Anna get up too.
At the hospital they had to suck out the blood. The tubes were removed the night John came home. Mycroft made sure he would be safe, so John could rest. He would come back there after lunch.
It takes four hours for the panic to start. Since the effect is not coming down, John fears the damage is permanent. How can anyone
He had also sent Mycroft an invitation, but only for him and Sherlock to have a laugh. The deluxe coffee maker he had sent as gift was great, though.
He had needed to go to a different publisher, who was actually interested in The Afghan War, a compilation of reflections on what he's seen and gone through, the army mindset and how encounters with locals changed his whole perspective on the british role in the Middle East. His editor liked the personal touch to what otherwise would be sanitised facts on the war, and had suggested working on his other areas of knowledge, and that's how his medical work transpired.
'Yes!' John walks around the room, rubbing his face in rage, feeling like a bird in a cage. 'She's been driving me insane! Smelling my clothes and checking my phone when I'm not looking. Christ!'
'You'll find out that your wife was to one who took the dvds, converting them to digital archives I assume, since dvds are an increasingly obsolete media format. Didn't tell you to make a surprise, so I would check if there isn't an anniversary date coming up soon that you forgot.' he gets up and opens the door to the foyer gesturing for the man to leave. 'You can make the deposit after the confirmation, I have to get this, you know your way, bye.'
Relieved that he didn't make wrong assumptions, John gladly takes him, Sherlock mirroring his actions. He doesn't appear inexperienced (there
She and the other guys leave, and Mycroft comes right after, with Mrs. Hudson in tow. 'There's a new phone on the kitchen table.' he tells John. 'As I understand you lost yours. Call me when you feel ready.'
Sherlock has already arranged the furniture for client mode and is sitting in the leather chair, distracted by his phone. John puts his bag away somewhere he doesn’t care, strides to him to get his day share of kisses, which Sherlock complies without hesitating, to his delight.
Mycroft comes after her, but John takes one look at him, wearing a black three-pieces suit, and fakes having a fit, so a nurse expels the tosser from the ward to attend to John.
'Leave the violin, I'll take it with me.' Mycroft tells someone. 'Yes, his bedroom is the last of the corridor, you can get everything from there.'
After his eyesight gets used to the dark, he analyses the sleeping detective. He would want to scrutinize him better for the first time and perhaps be a little soppy about it, but something definitely isn't right. His eyes are moving rapidly behind his lids, and the jerks, while not aggressive, are visible. What really makes John decide for waking him is the locked jaw. He gently pokes his shoulder.
Three days and not a word about Sherlock. He barely slept, not with images of bullets in foreheads and skulls crashing in the pavement across his eyes every time he attempted to close them. The first night back at the suburbs he had to explain everything to Anna, cutting himself off several times to prevent calling her that name, but she didn't express much on the matter. She had been clearly happy that Magnussen was gone.
'Yes. Luckily we found enough evidence on her for a life sentence back at her home country. Yesterday I filled the marriage annulment form.'
'The hell I am!' he says. He squeezes the shoulders in his hold. 'She's safer and happier here. And I will not just blindly wait this time. We are thinking of something, me and this big brain of yours, ok?'
Purple is such an interesting colour. Could be read as vibrant or gothic, depending on the person. Sherlock looked great in purple. Even in a sexual way, John can admit. The purple irises are intent on him, and suddenly they are not purple anymore but black, as the pupils dilate and occupy the whole eye space. The cat's tail lifts up in the air as they stand up. They give a little step forward, waving their head towards John.
. He promptly returns it to the bag. Sherlock grabs it and tucks it inside a cupboard. He looks terribly embarrassed.
'What, communitary services? Doesn't seem so bad.' John interrupts, a laugh already creeping up. But Mycroft remains serious.
Sherlock crosses his arms over his chest, and his left hand is now close enough for him to reach and capture John's hand from over his waist. 'You can do that too. If you are unhappy with the current way of managing your life, change it. It's always hard in the beginning, but you recover. And you have a support system I didn't. We are not going homeless if you stop trying to fit in a surgery.'
'Just a few more days and they can take them off. You'll scratch all you want.' Rosie knocks her hand down with a resounding
He jumps to the side of the table and tumbles it towards her. She runs from it, trying to get leverage from behind John's chair. Sherlock blindly grabs the wooden box he had taken from his bedroom when John feel asleep and tosses at her direction. The moment she takes to sidestep it so it doesn't reach her face he springs toward her, intending to get the gun.
This makes John look up at her. 'Your condolences?' he asks, confused. 'Why are you giving me your condolences?
He meets with Mycroft down the corridor. Along with him there's a woman he knows he hasn't seen before, but somehow she is quite familiar. Blond, large blue eyes, something about her nose. Then he realises.
Sherlock's face is soft, and the curve between his neck and shoulder peeking out of the hem of the t-shirt is still an enticing pink from scrubbing. 'Good night.'
He is still nauseated, so he decides to skip dinner. Rosie burps happily and loud by his ear, and starts to babble the baby language. 'Hey lovely, how you doing?' he whispers to her, already able to smile a bit. She drools on him.
'There's absolutely no guarantee she would do that of course' Sherlock complements. 'Consequently, we must plan for long-term. She needs to go through her pregnancy being calm, and we drop the idea in small doses, until she's compliant with it.'
'Oh god, definitely no! When I remember his lack of tact at that restaurant, oof!' she spasms as if revolted. 'Lucky for him he doesn't seem interested in romantic things. He's probably asexual too. Have you ever seen- ouch John!'
'Good technique, blocking my phone and smelling my clothes! Didn't you see that would only make withdraw from you?'
He had stayed a week locked in a cell, completely alone with his mind, turning over the fact that he was going to die and he wouldn't hear John's deep regular breath ever again. He was going to suffer physically and mentally until he couldn't take it
John interrupts him by taking his hand, and walks backwards until he reaches his chair, pulling the detective with him. He sits and Sherlock comes down right in his lap, ironically or not in the same position he watched Janine take months ago. Sherlock’s eyes are wide as saucers and he has stopped talking.
John buries his face on Sherlock's chest. He's still trying to control his breath. 'John?' he murmurs to the top of his head. 'Do you have anyone that can cover you at the clinic?'
A hysterical giggle threatens to come up his throat. He just kisses Sherlock's bicep and goes to attend Rosie Watson, who is now trying to dive into the carpet to retrieve the giraffe.
He enters 221 and goes to Sherlock's office at first, to leave his box. Hiding in plain sight, he's pretty sure Sherlock won't bother snooping through his things because they are right there on display. Going upstairs to the living room, he is greeted with hurricane Watson.
'I'm still recovering, she'll have this excuse very easily. But we could give you a timetable, how about that?'
In the cab he watches her closely. She's still whining, and feels warm to the touch. He opens her mouth delicately, despite her protests, and there it is: some mucus running in the back of her throat. He taps the glass separating him from the driver to call his attention. 'Stop at the nearest pharmacy from Baker Street.'
He spent months regretting the pregnancy, and when he finally sets his mind and heart to it, it's taken away. It's his fault, it's his fault. He caused it, he wanted it and it happened.
John opened Sherlock's laptop to do that. And right when he was closing the browser, a new email arrived. It was a reply from an architect with a budget proposal. The original email from Sherlock had a file of archives attached, all related to renovation plans at 221B. Those plans included reorganising the space so he and Rosie could move in. John hadn't had a chance to bring it up yet.
Sherlock and Anna are going to the car. He says Moriarty is back but obviously dead. He seems confident of himself, so John trusts him. In other circumstances he wouldn't be impeded of scolding him by his apparent guilty of overdosing, but he will save it for other opportunity. Anna and Sherlock discuss something about Emilia Ricoletti's case, which John still doesn't care, so he reclines in his seat, closing his eyes for a moment, coming down from the hysteric situation he just passed.
‘I'm aware.’ she doesn’t remark that he can’t bring himself to say it even after three years and even it it ended up not being real. ‘So it’s quite recurring. When would you say this feeling is triggered?’
They soon eat the bread, tasteful as always. After that they watch a movie on telly, and when it's finished they take their showers, separately, and he shaves before joining her on the bed. It's evocative of their time before Sherlock came back from the dead. John's stomach sinks a bit as he feels the familiarity because he knows what always came next in the old days.
'Yeah. I...' he rubs his face. 'I said some things I shouldn't. My anxiety also got in the way and I backed up from our plans without
They had sat down the night before and talked about what was going to happen. First things first, he had told John how he created a diversion to quickly remove Mary out of the picture. He improvised that quickly after John confessed to bugging her phone, and it was a relief she took the bait. He sent a message as a possible client about a man he needed killed in Wales. The profile he provided lacked the crucial information that the concerned target was actually a missing person for ten years now. His network saw her leaving London immediately after he confirmed payment on her Paypal.
'Now you're just mocking the scientific method.' Sherlock doesn't pay much attention to him, writing on his clipboard. Rosie throws the stuffed giraffe on his face for the third time in the morning, which he apparently doesn't register. 'Her capacity of holding light objects is quite average for her age, which is satisfactory.'
'Well, I hope there isn't a next time of that.' she responds, insinuative. 'Are you going to Sherlock's today?'
'You didn't want to see.' Sherlock says. 'People can be obtusely blind to determinate things they don't want to deal with. You are not less prepared as a doctor because of that.'
He calls Greg, who gathers a kidnapping team to go investigate Keona's address. Not strictly legal procedure, but he knows better when to call favours from the Met after Sherlock helps him so much. Keona also gives him the name of her stalker, discovered by Sherlock himself. Greg puts someone to look into the archives.
Sherlock examines his bandaged hand for a brief second before getting up from the kitchen chair and clapping both hands together. 'Right. We can't let you be in that room forever. I have to buy stuff and do research before the night comes.'
He laughs and just to work him up he goes to the fridge, takes a photo of the half lemon tart and sends to Sherlock. Seconds after he receives the answer.
All that crosses his mind as he stares at the back of Sherlock's head, ignoring Magnussen's body aside. Uniformed agents come up the terrace and cuff Sherlock up. They pat John to check for weapons. Useless, as the one he brought was taken by Sherlock, and lies on the floor.
Sherlock's lips keep threatening to lift up. He then looks at John from under his eyelashes. 'John, I studied the solar system. What do you think?'
John just shakes his head. Sherlock grasps his nape, and his hand feels warm. 'Don't freak out. It's ok now.'
Air-filled organs such as lungs, stomach, ears and even joints could simply collapse, depending on how close and how long a soldier was exposed to the interaction between high-frequency stress wave and lower-frequency shear wave. Concussions are also a type of primary blast injury.
Sherlock quickly removes the syringe, and John's arm bleeds out copiously. He watches the detached limb becoming red. Next thing he notices is Sherlock making pressure and applying a bandage to it. John feels like his brain is buried in cotton. Sherlock cleans everything and puts the vial away in a thermal box.
John takes the tube back to Baker Street. Ella had said by the end of their appointment that she was very happy with him. He had told her that right now he was feeling better than any moment of his life. It took him about forty years to get it right, but the most important is that he can truly say that everything is fine.
'In a sense.' Sherlock replies. They are both laying on the floor, side by side, barefoot. John intertwines his pinky toe on Sherlock's. 'Mary Morstan was honestly just another identity, one that gives her security. She begins working at the clinic, finds the most vulnerable person she can find to trap in a marriage, so she can maintain a spot to come back to whenever she manages to get work.'
However, to assume behavioural patterns exist and to categorise them systematically are two completely different things. And Sherlock is the detective, ergo, the specialist in the matter. Even John, who supposedly planted the concept in his head, can have trouble interpreting the subtleties of people's attitudes.
At one point during the middle of the night he is awakened by Mr. Clearwater calling the nurse. Apparently he is in pain. John tries to move his head to the other side and go back to sleep, but he catches a glimpse of the window. On the outside, framed by the dark, a tabby cat with purple eyes is sitting on the windowsill. John feels his heartbeat pace increasing, a scream sinks at his throat. The cat jumps down and he can't do anything about it.
They arrive at Baker Street and while Sherlock goes upstairs to pack for himself, John stays at 221A to talk to Mrs. Hudson. There's another silent suit-dressed agent positioned at the door. John can see the outline of a pistol on the inside of his jacket. Mrs. Hudson tells him Rosie is already sleeping.
Sherlock is in the living room, sitting on the floor and working on something at the coffee table. John lowers himself next to him, pushing the paper bag with the croissants to his general direction. He immediately gets one and tries to put it whole inside his mouth. The manners on him, honestly. While he attempts to overfeed, John takes a look at the mess on the table.
She shot an old woman just because she described his voice. It wasn't the first time she assassinated someone that age but usually they have good reasons to do it. The lady was blind for god's sake.
I have plans for other fics. There's this AU in my mind for months that I hope I can write soon! After recovering from series 4 trauma perhaps.
He can control if he feels pain or not. He digs the nails in the skin where the scar sits. And pushes a bit more. It hurts but not like he remembers it. The hand is removed, leaving four reddish dents in its place. He watches the dents slowly becoming purplish. It doesn't come even close to what he wanted.
He wishes the bedroom light was on to see everything, but doesn't suggest they kick off the duvet, as Sherlock seems very comfortable with it. In fact, he's completely comfortable as they are now, not making any moves to increase friction or, well, more intense stimulation. 'Sherlock...' he wanders his hand down the man's thigh, trying to make a point. Sherlock breathes on him for a moment and responds by doing the same.
The practising thing demonstrated to be way tougher than he had anticipated. First, he was terrible at acting. Unlike Sherlock, he never participated in the school plays. Once at primary school his mother obligated him to, but he was so awful that the teacher dressed him as a tree and instructed him not to open his mouth. But everyone saw him making absurd faces at the back while Dorothy was attacked by Ethan-the apple tree.
'Well I don't have anything on my history, see?' he shows his phone to him. 'I tried messaging and calling you too, but it didn't work, I was always cut off.'
'Coddle you?' Sherlock's whole face is a question mark, but the narrowed eyes indicate he's already losing his patience. 'How on earth am I coddling you?'
'Not really.' The answer is not hesitant, so John believes him. 'And I have nightmares now and then, as everyone else. I mostly don't have a sleeping pattern so it's hard to tell.'
I'm not using tumblr much because every time I open it there is some setlock I don't want to see, but you can talk to me, I will answer! username thanks-mike-stamford.
He closes his box with tape and leaves. Diana makes a show of not looking at him. One more person that hates John, for Sherlock's list. John is sure he has a lot of fun compiling it. He suddenly remembers Mary had a bigger list than him, which he never set his eyes on. He'll ask Sherlock about that. He surely needs some laughs.
John swallows. 'I… we need to talk about something.' he says, and then because Sherlock's eyes are wide at him he adds 'About my daughter. Come here.'
At some point fatigue starts to win him over, and he enters a light sleep. He's not overly conscious of what he is dreaming, he knows Sherlock is there as usual, but a loud bang interrupts the train of thought and Sherlock blows up, body parts being thrown in all directions. He opens his eyes with a sharp intake of air, feeling paralysed, muscles locked tight. Then he realises the loud noise is actually Mrs. Hudson knocking on the door.
For Rosie's one year birthday Sherlock decides to bake a cake. John encourages him and even suggests he chooses a low-sugar version so she can actually eat it. Sherlock has already charted all her favourite tastes up to the point, so John guarantees him it will be a blast. But the moment he leaves to buy supplies, John runs to Mrs. Hudson and begs her to supervise the ordeal, while being
Keona gives him her flat's keys. Sherlock knows the man goes home at 6:30 pm and always comes back to stalk the house for a few hours at 10pm. He waits for him during the time up on the roof, setting up cameras all over the house.
He takes a wire from his pocket, and installs it around John's ear. 'You are going to listen to this, and repeat everything I say.' he taps his own ear to signal the twin device he has.
He stands slowly, trying not to look anywhere but the man's face. Outside the car doors close. On his left the handle of the closet door turns gently. Brent rushes to him impatiently, pushing his shoulder forward while the gun almost brushes his nose. 'Come
'Ha!' he feels so light he could touch the ceiling, and Rosie bounces in his arms. He walks to the sofa and promptly drops her over Sherlock, who receives the package with a "oof".
"Funny thing isn't it," John thinks a bit hysterically. "that the whole trouble started because he knew something, but it only takes a bullet in his head to guarantee he can't do anything else to anyone. It would have been better if he had some prints"
Todd quickly loses interest in him when he realises Sherlock is not there to compete for Keona, whatever that means for a creep like him. He has a bike chain lock in his backpack, and uses it to shackle Sherlock to the feet of the bathroom's cabinet under the sink, after bringing him down from the rooftop with the knife secured against his throat. He closes the door and leaves Sherlock bleeding on the floor.
The song finally enters the last stage, combining elements from the cheerful tune and the sensual one, staying in midtempo and gradually slowing to an end. Sherlock does a little bow, the blush high on his cheeks. John sighs.
John had experienced it before. He had been deaf for long minutes after being just close enough to an exploding car in Afghanistan. The blast wind movement can be dangerous to the tympanic membrane. His hearing was right as rain soon after the incident, but it did impede him from hearing Bill Murray calling his name seconds before he was shot in the shoulder.
John sighs, and lies his head on Sherlock's shoulder. The wheels of his brain are whirling wildly. Sherlock rests his cheek over the top of John's head. A loud melodic noise announces Rosie has dropped her piano. Gently, Sherlock gets up to collect it and put it back in place. John watches the simple act, and then on a whim he removes the stick from the laptop without the security procedure and stands.
Mycroft just raises an eyebrow and goes away silently. Mrs. Hudson approaches the door carefully. 'John, I've been thinking… Do you want to visit his grave?'
Not betaed no britpicked not first language. Feel free to correct something wrong, but please explain!
She leaves without a back glance. John suddenly notices the silence. Sherlock is around the kitchen door, maintaining a distance from the discussion. Rosie has her mouth attached to his chin, chewing it happily. Her cheeks are still tear-stained. His throat feels thick at the sight of them.
Hours pass by. He's thirsty, his back hurts from the hard floor, and the wound burns. His arms being locked over his head start to feel anesthetized. He had tried several times to dislodge the chain, but it is locked tight, and he can't feel his fingers anymore, so he is obliged to give up. The bathroom has a small window, but it's closed. He dozes off and when he wakes up he can see a faint brace of sunlight through it.
UPDATE: as I said on tumblr, I will travel for the next 10 days without a computer, so there will be no updates during this time. Thanks for reading!
Pondering these questions reinforce the impression he has that Anna would run away with his daughter. He didn't intervene when he was living with Sherlock and she also left him out. It seems she was neglecting the preparations, but she could be preparing somewhere else. He needs to talk to Sherlock about the next steps of their plan.
Sorry, I forgot to post yesterday! But here it is! I'm going home for Easter, but I don't know if I'll be able to post the new chapter on the weekend. Any changes I'll post on tumblr. Come talk to me there! username thanks-mike-stamford.
He waits for Sherlock's mind gears warm up a bit. And… there it was, the blinking. 'Ahn… sure.' he clears his throat, looking suddenly very shy. 'Please do.'
'You see - when I got married I barely knew my husband. I told you that before. Love seemed to just bloom overnight. When he asked me to do the typing… well, it never crossed my mind to refuse. Obviously I ended up getting involved with many things. So when I'd get too stressed he would give me some marijuan-oh don't look like that, it's not the end of the world.'
"Apparently yes." he thinks sourly. 'What is bothering you? That I spend time with him? He's my best friend! You even told me to spend time with him!'
'Oh but John soon won't have the chance.' she replies with condescendence. 'Newborn children take a lot of time. Children in general.'
Sideway, one of the scars in his back is visible. The white thin stripe comes from the right shoulder blade facing downwards, and it fades before reaching the second to last rib. He honestly doesn't remember much from the incident, probably due to the sleep deprivation. He has to ask Mycroft if he hallucinated deducing his torturer wife's affair in serbian. He's not even sure he can still speak serbian, or if he was ever able to.
It's a very pleasant afternoon. Sherlock eats three slices of cake when he thinks John isn't watching. He and Molly talk animatedly over the failed spleen of a teenager she had brought, and later he, Greg and Mrs. Hudson chew some turkish tobacco in silent, much to John's aggravation. Sherlock, despite himself, seems to have fun, which was the goal so John is very satisfied.
Now that he's living with Anna again, he can't stop comparing to life in 221B. Sherlock could be a very unnerving person when he wanted to. But save the occasions he wants to drug John, he is very obvious about it. With Anna is like there's a secret agenda always dictating their interactions, one that she wants accomplished but won't make it transparent. Some of their conversations are actually cringeworthy when he review them. She played with him since the very beginning.
going to work, and allowed himself to hate her a bit for letting him go this far. He made bad choices, but so did her, and to be honest, hers were far worse.
He has a lot to think about and he has the space. At the same time he doesn't want to think about anything.
When he reaches the final steps of the staircase, Rosie is already there, a second from crawling down. '
The living room is stinking with old vomit. Was it only two days since that? Felt like ages definitely. He ignores the thing and searches the kitchen for the cardboard boxes he's sure they still have. A bunch of them in hand, he migrates to the bedroom, and starts to remove the contents of the wardrobe. He separates mechanically his possessions from Anna's, which are very few, he comes to realise. It occurs to him that Ezster must have come to get most of her things to take with her. He texts Mycroft to confirm it, just in case.
He looks around the room. There's a broom propped on the wall, where he cleaned an accidentally broken glass cup earlier this evening. He gets up smoothly, gathers the broom, and moves to the corridor. He can see the living room lights are on. The closet under the stairs door is open, hiding someone. He aims the broom high.
His current client is being extremely boring, so that's where his thoughts are drifting during the consultation. He can't do legwork while taking care of Rosie, so since Mary came back, he's been taking cold cases from Lestrade, who made sure to affirm he was being benevolent, and clients whose problems are solved from his office at 221C. 20 minutes maximum of consultation per case are usually enough to receive a fee and not make a huge disturbance on Mrs. Hudson's daily activities, so she can stay with her goddaughter.
He gulps. 'No. Just… aah... There's a cat that lives around the neighbourhood and I've been putting some food for it on the windowsill at night. The wind must have brought the fur.'
He's at the break room at the clinic. Dolores is chatting up the new nurse and Dr. Pattinson is reading a magazine. The tv is on, but nobody is paying attention until all of a sudden the emergency news starts to broadcast. The pressman fights his way with another hundred of journalists trying to break the police blockade.
'), he highlighted how now that she is close to four months, she should be able to roll from tummy to back.
' Sherlock cuts him off, holding his wrists, but doesn't attempt to take his hands from his face. 'You're not going to die. I know it's frightening, but it's going to be over. I promise.'
Sherlock is there, more pale than he ever had the right to, eyes wide open, palms thrown up in his chest, which is heaving wildly. John stops and they look at each other for several moments, each on their own journey relearning how to breath. John shoves the pickaxe again at the side of the open lid of the coffin, until he's able to pull it out completely, and throw over his head to the hole opening.
She would never anticipate losing power over them by being ruled a neglectful parent by the court. Sherlock is counting on the surprise factor.
'But… you're okay with that? A child living here? We'd have to reorganize the whole place. And not just once, all the time.' he needs to make Sherlock understand the degree of adjustment they'd have to pass through. 'Honestly, if it's something you can't cope there's no problem. It's your flat. I can find somewhere else to live.'
'Dr. Watson, great timing. He's been his usual difficult self about breathing therapy.' he says visibly controlling the urge to roll his eyes.
He looks at John's face. There's saliva pooling at the corner of his mouth, and the normally deep blue of his eyes are not visible, pushed back by the enlarged pupils. Sherlock sighs. 'No, go back to Baker Street.'
They toss around but she doesn't release the gun. If that goes on, she will likely find a window of opportunity to shoot him. She was trained and everything for that. His ears are ringing so he is not really listening to anything around him. He makes the mistake of using both hands to take the gun and she elbows his throat and knees his kidney.
'Oh, I revel the look of surprise in a sheep's face when they see one of them was a wolf all along. Isn't it delightful, Mary?' he singsongs. John hated the sound of his voice when he tried to flirt with Sherlock, and still hates it now. He barely knows Molly Hooper (he's not even sure she herself remembers his name when he's next to Sherlock), but he has no idea what she saw in him.
His attitude deflates a little. 'Ahn. I only know the waltz you taught me. We could dance to it perhaps?'
'My people saw her withdrawing money and taking a train.' he decides to change the topic. 'It's highly probable she changed trains and even identities to leave the country inconspicuously, as she has a history of that strategy.' he looks out of the window. It's very dark outside, and he can't discern any movement.
'Don't you remember when he makes sure the couple are together before leaving?' she asks him with loomy eyes. 'I never forgot that. I can't believe I'll have my own tarmac scene!'
the moment he understands, he gives up, he spares him because John can't stomach it, he's not brave enough and Sherlock is leaving to die in some bolthole of Europe. So Sherlock makes a joke and John laughs so he doesn't cry. He pushes the locked box at the top shelf to the back of his mind.
She wanted him to stay with her, and him knowing the truth wasn't the sole peril to this. He didn't leave, granted, but something could still take him away from her. In her logic: Sherlock. Again.
'Good night, John.' his smile is the last thing his human eyes see before the clock turns 10:27pm, and the now familiar sensation of being condensed into a smaller shape takes him over.
Not knowing their youngest is living on the streets sounds a bit neglectful to John, but given his own strained family relationships, he says nothing. 'But what exactly happened? Did you suddenly run out of money?'
She folds her body with a moan instead of answering. He is on her in a second. ‘What is it? Are you okay?’
He looks so much like the first day, in the abandoned parking lot, that John almost tells him about bloody nostalgy. He clenches his fists by his sides.
And he also suspects why, but this is for when the effects pass. Meanwhile, he thinks back to David Payne and Mary Morstan.
He pushes forward the bike, turning left at the corner and avoiding a motorbike that started right behind him. Rush hour was so not his favourite.
'That bugger's birthday, I almost forgot' he murmurs to himself. He mostly ignores that Sherlock's from the eighties, because it's silly that he feels the detective is much younger when the difference isn't more than a few years. He gets self-conscious, which is not good if he wants… whatever he wants. It never helps that Sherlock shows a bunch of self-confidence.
She dismisses him with a wave of her hand. 'I just put a bit on my tea with other herbal soothers here and then. My hip bothers me like hell otherwise. Want to take a look?'
And in the top shelf, the one he couldn't reach without a chair, the very first thing he deposited inside the cabinet, a locked box. He had the key somewhere, but he didn't remember exactly.
Enduring they talk about nothing is almost unbearable. They used to talk about nothing in particular at Baker Street, when their life was practically one. John doesn't want to hear him suggesting baby names. He doesn't want him saying the East wind or whatever that means is taking him because he's unworthy. The mention of Eastern Europe speeds up the rate in his chest (Serbia? Georgia?). Six months. John fears he will have a panic attack if he keeps looking at Sherlock.
He does have a memory issue, probably due to the amount of videos he takes and never uploads to a cloud storage. The main subjects are obviously Sherlock and Rosie, with individual and paired categories. He scrolls back to when Rosie was still a baby, Sherlock gives her a bath and she splashes water and soap right over his face. Mrs. Hudson nearly collapses of laughter.
'You've been reading John's blog - the story of how you met.' Anna announces out of nowhere. Sherlock stops talking and looks at her with confused glassy eyes. John takes Sherlock's phone from her. 'Not right now, please.' he says to her, not waiting for her response.
To his surprise, Greg Lestrade comes to visit him. He is feeling extremely alienated as he learns basically some days had passed since the night at the pool. His health condition has finally been considered stable. Most of his injuries were secondary to the explosion anyway. His initial breathing difficulty lasted only the first two days, mainly impact wind-induced. Regular chest films were negative for pulmonary PDI, which was the biggest risk. He shows no signs of developing late pneumonia.
After finishing this task, he sits down and waits. The night encloses him rather quickly after that, making him safer from potential onlookers, and perhaps from himself. He has two bottles saved for later use. While waiting, he uses the portable scale in his pocket to measure the size he will need to open, and marks the lines on the sand with a white spray aerosol.
'Look. I'm not… a very sexual person. You'll find that many times I won't even be in the mood. But I like being with you. So whatever you want, whatever you can… it works for me.'
He doesn't know where to start, so he tries to go to all the places he's seen the tabby cat before. Little fuckers. He should have known you can't trust them not to twist the circumstances with malicious intent. It must amuse the lot, they must have a wicked cat convention to meow about all the idiots they granted wishes while adding a trick at the end.
Full lips contort in an unhappy line. 'Honestly? Tired. I've been so tired all the time. If there's something I gave up during all that happened, is trying to over control things. I'm just glad. That you.' he looks so mortified an actual blush paints his cheeks. The nerve of him to look so adorable and uncomfortable at the same time. 'That you are here with me. I didn't think this could happen.'
She starts with the veggies, and then the pie. She places a generous amount in Sherlock's plate, which John is not even considering being accidental anymore. She prepared this to purposefully torment him. Sherlock gazes his plate defeatedly and pokes a single green bean with his fork. John discreetly mouths 'Just pretend.' to him. They start to eat and John contemplates if it's possible to sneak Sherlock's food into his own plate without her noticing.
, he had forgotten about that. She had seen Sherlock naked! Fully starkers, and all wet! Not even John had that privilege yet, only some parts of him. At Buckingham Palace he
The driver produces a plastic bag out of somewhere and Sherlock vomits in it immediately. Anna looks a bit weary, so John stumbles over her to change seats. He has another wave of nausea as the car turns a street and John tries to hold his fringe out of the way. Sherlock breathes heavily for a moment, trying to control the sickness. They stop at a traffic light, and the driver reaches behind him again, offering a water bottle. John takes it and gives it to Sherlock, who is now reclined against the window and holding the bag as far as he could.
He hops from the car without waiting for approval from the cop. The team is collecting evidence through the whole house. 'Bathroom?' he asks a guy with a ziploc bag in his hand full of hair. They guy gestures to a corridor, and John follows. Two cops try to impede him. 'I'm a doctor, let me analyse his condition.' he replies in a voice that invites no questions.
He fishes John's phone from his hand, and looking at the contacts he finds one Cynthia Lavalle and calls her, explaining John is unable to go to the clinic today. After he finishes the brief conversation, he hears John asking. 'Am I drugged?'
'So if you want to cheat on your wife, whatever dude, that's on you.' he interrupts John. 'But don't estrange her from her own daughter, you don't have the right.'
When he finally revealed that he had a mind palace of his own, he had been more astounded with Sherlock's shock, that he had made mistake, that he had counted with a crucial factor for the whole Anna-Greta plan to work, but it didn't exist. That all he had done had been for nothing. John was not used to Sherlock getting it wrong and not being able to force his way out.
He looks up. A well-dressed woman is standing in the doorway, clutching a folder tight against her chest. He glances subtly at his watch, it's 7pm already.
Now that it came to mind, he hasn't really stopped to think about Sherlock boxing. He had said he used to at Uni. That was a picture. Sherlock is really fit and stronger than he looked. How would it be, being in early twenties, athletic as girls usually like, mysterious and posh, with that voice that sounded like warm honey on ears, perhaps he trained shirtless…
Sherlock minimally shakes his head, like swapping away a mosquito or a strange thought, and ignores his sad attempt of a joke. 'Not only that, but you seem to have developed strange habits. You hole yourself up at night, lock your bedroom when you leave-'
'I haven't a single clue what you're aiming at by coming to my workplace and talking shit about me to coworkers. How is that taking care of your family?' he spits.
They stop with the leg mid-air, tongue bleping out for a second, before lifting their head to look at John. They then move to a sitting position, bending their head to the side a bit as if asking
The sand is up to his ankles now. The air is very dry, and sweat pools under his nape. He can't open his eyes. 'Stop that.'
But everything is fine now. Sherlock is back. John's life has a reason again, although he shouldn't say that to his therapist, because she would scold him. Sherlock lives means John Watson lives.
. How's Mary? When the baby's due? We miss her so much! Subsequently of Anna leaving the country to not come back he would quit this job.
'Mary, don't you think we should start buying things for the nursery? The closer it gets to the due date it will be harder to find an opportunity'
'It's fine. Up?' he pulls John to his feet after he acquiesces. Unexpectedly, Sherlock holds him gently, caressing the short hair at his nape with one hand and the extension of his back with the other. 'It will be over soon. I promised you. It will be ok.'
He turns to the fireman calling him. Apparently the fire is almost fully controlled. 'Are you the owner of the car, sir? I have some questions.'
Likewise, the clinic doesn't make him comfortable anymore. He had resumed working after he moving out from Baker Street. He had needed fresh air, talk to different people. No one asked him about Sherlock there. It had restored him a bit. But now the place reeks of
'Then is it so awful with me? Because it's far from the first time. And you didn't seem stressed or worried the whole night, so don't use this excuse.' her voice is very light, and she doesn't sound angry or sad as he expects from someone in this kind of conversation.
'It means that I don't know if living here is a good idea!' he snaps. Sherlock's eyes are wide as saucers, his mouth hanging open a bit.
,' he gestures with his fingers. 'blow up. Won't be pretty. I bet Sherlock dearest would get upset, he does seem attached to his pet.'
He cleans the whole bathroom until it smells of bleach. He finds it oddly comforting. Sherlock's used towels are still there, so he adds them to the laundry pile.
. 'Her daughter gifted it on Christmas. Now we can message each other, isn't it fun? How do I forward messages? There's this video of a himbo gentleman afraid of getting his flu shots, I bet you'll laugh.'
Their voices dissipate as he enters his bungalow. He disregards the sofa facing the main cabinets and goes to his special one, always polished. He opens the bottom drawer, and there are the cigarettes, and the blue ball. He deposits a folded paper with a list alongside them.
'That's nonsensical, you can't pay for another place in London and rear a child on your own. The average monthly budget for single-parents during the first five years-'
'Wait!' he surges forward. She looks skeptically at him. 'I realise I haven't been… very kind to you. Since everything happened. I'm sorry for that.'
'I did go homeless for around six months.' the man himself tells him while watching John pushing Rosie on the swings. She's a bit afraid at first so he does it very gently. 'How do you think I formed my network?'
'Good job. Dr. Watson, be a gent and put your gun away, it's trouble enough pretending it doesn't exist.' Mycroft says from the doorway, surveilling the scene in front of him. Anthea trails not far behind, head bent in her phone.
'Ahn.' John pauses. He hadn't taken really seriously her proposal, and he's not sure is a good idea. But then, it could be a good way to check her over. And Sherlock is a far better actor than himself. 'Ok. I'll invite him. Do you need me to buy something?'
He warns her to stay away from home still. The thing with stalkers is, they almost always don't get in trouble because until a "serious" crime is committed, nothing can be done. So Sherlock needs to set a trap for him and keep Keona safe at the same time. His initial idea is trespassing. Pretend she's at home so he can record Todd entering the house and being generally creepy. Simple enough.
'To perpetuate the myth.' Sherlock says with a shrug. 'To announce someone got the crown. She needs contacts. That explains her visit to Anna.'
He opens the under the sink cabinet, where his shaving kit lies. The razor is sharp. He slides the blade over the scar and the dents quickly, like removing a bandage. In the first few seconds he feels nothing, and then the pain comes, acute and a bit uncomfortable. There's a thin cut where the scar sat, fully red, and a drop of blood comes out of it. He put the pain there. He knows how much it will hurt, and he can make it stop. He can end it anytime.
She just shrugs and goes upstairs, John in tow. She takes some clean clothes from the drawer and heads to the bathroom, leaving the door ajar. John notices she doesn't have luggage with her, and he doesn't remember the clothes she is wearing. The toilet flushes and the shower starts. He stands close to the door. 'Anything else?' he asks over the noise.
'Ahhmm, no sure. I-' he stops and restarts in a quiet whisper. 'I dunno I dunno please get me please.'
'Don't be ridiculous!' Sherlock scorns. 'I think I'm entitled to interact with other people, as you always do. And I happen to enjoy Janine's company.'
John giggles and Sherlock rolls his eyes. 'Medical actually. About healthcare crimes. I can send you a copy if you want, but it will take some months.'
‘Her present. She’s still committing crimes. Attempted murder, David, and she was already pregnant at the time! If you don’t mind that, well luck you, but I don’t accept this. I won’t tell my daughter her mother is a murderer and I won’t make her visit her in prison. I also can’t ignore what Anna is doing. This is the best solution. Everyone is winning. You can go away with her and build another life for you two.’ he leaves it out how improbable it is that she will do that with David.
‘Then why were you dancing with her?’ John murmured, not planning on releasing him too soon. Sherlock didn’t complain, though.
'I care about you.' he repeats flatly. John is suddenly feeling like he lost all control of the conversation. The foggy sensation in his head is dissipating but he still can't see clear. 'So I care about you, and then I decided to, I don't know, comfort you?'
and he understands what the yellow thing was aimed to. The pink one isn't perfect, some loose ends poking out, but it is clear it is a tiny shoe. A newborn shoe.
"And yet you hold this power over me" she thought nervously. This is not how a job is supposed to go. But the offer was beyond tempting.
While Sherlock was in hospital, the police had found Todd Fuller nearby, going to the crime scene to see if Keona Douglas had come back home. They recovered all the footage on the app on Sherlock's phone, retrieved from the rooftop, and several other proves on how dangerous Fuller was to her and the general society. She had sent an email thanking him profusely and asking for Sherlock's bank details, so she could make a deposit.
Obviously he tried to cut short by overdosing in the plane. There was no way he could stand a rewind of his time in Serbia. It had been embarrassingly long before he realised the difference between dream and reality, but who could blame him? High as a kite, flying to his death, and suddenly John appears by his side telling him he was coming back? How to measure the likelihood of that?
He can see the signals quite clearly right now, which annoys him further. Is it possible for someone to actually gaslight themselves?
He blinks out of his revenue and groans, pinching his face. He is too old for this, replaying lovely events in his head all day like a teenager after the first kiss. But they were quite lovely, who can blame him. And also, he doesn’t really want to think about the fact that Janine is probably at his house right now, trying to sweet-talk Anna into abandoning the life she had been prepared to kill for. He doesn’t want to think about how he had given Sherlock no easy options to deal with this, how it sounds very dumb in his head right now that he even considered she would accept this kind of arrangement.
'It would be a bit strange wanting amorous activities with another person than your spouse on your wedding day.'
John turned absently minded the flash drive in his hand, staring at a spot in the linoleum floor, knowing Sherlock was regarding him closely. When wasn’t he?
He keeps holding the file from his last patient, who just left the office, so he doesn't forget to archive it correctly. Mr. Doyle needs a pain meds prescription almost every month for his arthritis so it always needs to be readily available. He dials line 3.
him. Staring intently and following his movements and being threatening. When he exited the bus, things just got worse. Everywhere he looked shined bright orange. The noise of traffic was extremely loud, while people's voices were muted. He saw people opening and closing their mouths so slowly, and no sound came out of it. The red lamp light from a barber shop jumped from its place and crossed the street.
It’s been days since he last went to Baker Street. He was once again going to leave early from the clinic. Today would be David’s first attempt at Anna, so he would manage to be with Sherlock while she was distracted.
Well, not everything if he's being honest. Just last week Sherlock had been trying to replicate some new hypothesis on the effects of pig's insulin on blood patterns caused by knife wounds. It had involved a dead pig in the shower, and John refusing to sleep in the flat while the thing was still there.
The dark water is a massive weight on his head, pressuring his eardrums until they whistle, entering his nose and his mouth and his lungs, and he knows it’s not a house meant to be lived in. The house and its inhabiting creatures pull you down to the ocean floor, a slow asphyxiation method he can’t help but feel powerless when facing it.
'So when you… when you jumped from Barts I kept thinking that I didn't see it. I didn't notice. Because I was so caught up in pretending we didn't have to talk, that you wouldn't need and in the end I couldn't retribute your help and I had
her what is bothering him, but like every time he talks to Ella, he finds out he doesn't appreciate sharing what he feels.
-' he stops, breathing heavily. Sherlock looks utterly shocked, his mouth is even hanging open a bit, eyes as wide as they can be.
He realises that he's thinking about hours. He's not sure how long has it been? He takes a look at his watch. It's a bit past noon. His watch also melts again his skin, and his breath shortens as he tries to remove it from his bone.
He frowns at the envelope. It has a seal from the prison in Budapest. The addresser is Anna Agnes. He feels more than he sees Sherlock looking over his shoulder and stiffening beside him. He takes a deep breath, gets up and marches to the kitchen. He lights the stove and throws the envelope over it. It burns quite quickly, so in a minute he turns it back off.
'Thought you'd ask.' he takes a folded newspaper from his jacket pocket. The picture is of the gymnasium where John was taken to, the pool where Carl Powers died. 'Look. The whole place exploded. They found a bunch of snipers trying to run away, but most of them were somehow injured or unable to leave the wreckage. They are all locked waiting for judgment. Firefighters made a whole strategy to take you out of there, the ceiling fell on you, but the stalls you were under mostly protected you from the impact. Moriarty now, that was a piece of work. Piece literally, there was not a single body member which was whole. Blown up to bits. We only identified him because of the snipers' testimony, which matched each other.'
'John.' Mycroft smiles at him close-lipped. 'I was in the middle of a meeting with a chancellor four time-zones away.'
They had agreed to have dinner out with Rosie near Marylebone. Sherlock obviously wasn't invited. So John leaves work and spends the rest of the afternoon at Baker Street, killing time before 7pm. Rosie is very happy to see "dada" again, and gives him a book about a family of rabbits so he can read aloud to her.
‘Oh.’ it’s more a blow than a syllable. ‘I didn’t actually want to kiss her. As I said, women are not my area. I still can’t believe you ignored all my flamboyance, honestly John…’
John takes the opportunity to slide his arm around Sherlock's waist. None of them are much for PDA, but Sherlock is welcoming, tilting his body an inch to his direction. 'You don't have to worry, you know?'.
, not reactionless, so you just have to go there and get him back. Apologizing for whatever you said is a good idea too.'
! You're even speaking like him! Been exchanging lots of words you two, ahn?' he smirks, making John flush.
The truth about Moriarty is uncovered and some precautions are taken. While that, Anna has another course of action.
He throws the bag at the backseat. 'Have a new source of income, you?' he asks, trying not to shout. Inside a car she can hear him perfectly well.
Sherlock doing anything he wants just to please him because John's a selfish prick who will take and take never give. Everything they have is not real and honestly how could it be. It's just a figment of his imagination. Everyone betrays him, he can't trust anyone, he can't do anything right. It's always his fault.
A woman in her thirties approaches the neighbour swing with her own daughter, who looks around five. She coos Rosie, telling the kid "Look babe, you have a little friend with you!" and smiles at John, who nods in acknowledgment. The little girl starts swinging herself as the woman goes around it to remove herself from the line of fire. Once behind the kid - and beside John, she smiles at him again. John looks forward, cleaning his throat.
‘If it comforts you, David.’ John interrupts. ‘It doesn’t matter. I wish I wasn’t married to her. Technically I’m not, since she’s using a fake identity.’
He shrugs and gives up on this (for now), plants a kiss on both heads before going to sit at his desk and finish his write-up.
Mrs. Hudson is leaving in her flirty dress when he opens the front door, which makes him raise an eyebrow to her.
He kneels back down and sits on his heels. As he stops making physical effort, he's finally keeping up with his heartbeat, hammering quicker than it should against his chest. He can barely pull a breath through his nose, and his mouth is open to try to compensate. He holds the pick firmly with both hands.
'I know. I don't doubt.' he replies surprised that he's being honest. For some reason he does believe that. 'But that doesn't make you a good person. And the one I fell in love with doesn't exist.'
John gets up as well. He still doesn't have leverage to keep the conversation face to face, but sitting down would be an extra add to it. 'I thought sex alarmed you!'
'I hope you're not expecting me to reciprocate in your birthday.' Sherlock alerts suddenly, looking very relaxed and still smelling like tobacco.
She smiles hugely at him, and takes his hand, apparently satisfied. She doesn't ask anything else during the trip, but John already has a pounding headache all the same.
'It's over. Time to resolve this. He's been over relationship problems before, and you are actually present for making up.'
It was the same motorbike that had been behind him at the clinic's street. He now realises that he had in fact acknowledged its presence close to him all the way from there, without paying attention. The pilot has the closed helmet on, and wears a grey jacket. The one who had been in front of the clinic, watching him. He now monitors any movement from the rearview mirror.
John parks his bike outside, where he still can see the burning stains on the ground. The house is completely dark. He enters carefully, dropping his keys in the bowl at the side table and flicking the lights on. There's nothing amiss in the living room, so he goes upstairs to their bedroom. The travel suitcases they keep in the wardrobe are untouched. Mary's coat is missing, but mostly all her things are still here.
' he takes a hold of her pulling her up. It takes some moments to realise he managed to not drop both baby and lunch plate.
The nurse that checks him out last for the night says he'll probably be discharged in the morning. They are all wary of him after being the target of his anger for the last couple days, so he seems surprised that there's no snapback comment this time.
So guys....... there it is! Obviously it was better in my mind than when I put in words, but the fact that I finished this is an accomplishment per se! Remember that I thought it would be over before setlock? *snorts loudly*. And in two days this will become an AU... Until we have like 5 years before getting new content.
'What do I do when 221 is finished?' he asks suddenly, before he overthinks and gets too afraid to open his mouth.
Finding him in the bathroom was so shocking he had eventually settled down on the floor, as a result of his knees failing him. It's jarring that Sherlock had reached a point he felt the need to hurt himself. It breaks his heart. What if he hadn't noticed in time? Would it escalate? It's absolutely scary and he doesn't want to think about that, but he does need to do something about it.
He jumps at her voice. He had forgotten she was there, now looking at him with suspicion. 'They released news on Magnussen. I think that means Sherlock will be out soon.'
The growing suspicion is becoming solid in his mind. He keeps chit-chatting nonsense with him, until they get to where he is supposedly. He tells the cab to wait. Looking around he sees John sitting in on the front step of a penthouse. It appears he walked from the main avenue and landed here.
'Yeah, ah, we talked a lot back then. He didn't contact me after he was discharged, though. A few years can distance people after all.' he broke the awkward silence, contemplating her face.
He stops mid movement, one arm still out of the Belstaff, considering. 'I'll arrange for someone to deliver formula as soon as possible.' It's hardly ideal a baby her age who technically breastfeeds, but it's the only way, as nobody sent extra bottled milk.
