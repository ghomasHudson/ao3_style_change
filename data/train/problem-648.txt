In an empty theater, a woman, Professor Cairns was editing a documentary concerning space. The documentary spoke about different planets and the fascinating facts belonging to each planet. The projector was reflecting off a screen, creating bright lights throughout the dark room. Professor Cairns kept editing the documentary when she heard the door behind her close.
Sherlock remained shocked, he numbly sat down on the bed and tried to look for the signs he missed. “That can’t be possible.”
Soo Lin faced Sherlock. “Yes. I hoped, after five years… maybe they would have forgotten me. But they never really let you leave. A small community like ours… they are never very far away. He came to my flat. He asked me to help him track down something that was stolen.”
Sherlock and John went separate ways, trying to find more walls that consisted of yellow paint along with more symbols.
In a flicker of emergence, new and unborn energy crackled through their bodies. The words almost felt like a kiss against John’s lips and to his horror, a switch had been turned on and images began to rush through his head.
A lot of kids would bully him, call him hurtful names, and made fun of him whenever they had a chance. Everyday, John would come home crying to his parents and tried to explain what happened, but his tears were the only words he could form. After some time, his parents hired a tutor to teach sign language to John. By the time he reached 18, he was fluent in sign language and for the first time he was able to talk to his parents and they would understand him.
Mr Ewart turned around in his seat, looking up at the picture while Sherlock came closer to the man and scrutinized Mr Ewart’s back. John quietly watched Sherlock do his thing while he took notes and pretended to be the perfect husband.
All those expectations were never achieved; the location of Sherlock’s boarding school was the birth place of his awaited demeanor that spilled of sin. If Sherlock were a true believer in coexisting with the perversion of corrupting one’s act, he would’ve continued his use in drugs and contaminate the act of transport which was his body.
Sherlock looked over the car before he opened the car door and checked the driver’s seat; quickly eyeing the seat, opening the glove compartment and retrieving a card. “No body?”
The blond narrowed his eyes and pounced towards the detective. Sherlock swung his arm, intending to punch John’s face when the blond ducked the incoming punch. John came up quickly and drove his fist upwards towards the detective’s chin. The sudden blow caused Sherlock to fall back a bit and the blond took the opportunity to throw a kick towards the detective’s abdomens.
Sherlock took in Lestrade’s words and was perplexed. “No, that’s… that’s not right. How… why would she do that? Why? She couldn’t have been thinking about her daughter in her last moments of life. She scratched her daughter’s name on the floor with her fingernails. She was dying. It took effort. It would have hurt.”
The Omega boy could smell gunpowder being recently exposed from being stored in barrels for too long, there were puffs of black smoke that kept getting thicker and thicker due to the boy smelling fire that could easily make him choke. Sherlock felt his eyes watering when a wave of gasoline and blood clogged his ability to breathe and fogged up his vision, he could taste the copper on his tongue and the cloud of flammable gas that would easily burn the Omega boy if someone dropped a lighted match.
It over-complicates an already ridiculously complicated plot that is on its way to becoming UNcomplicated.
After failing to come up with anything on his own, ready to call in a favour to one of his former clients for a seat at a swanky restaurant, he happened to mention to Mrs Hudson yesterday that it was going to be their First Date Night as a Couple, and Mrs Hudson then promptly squealed in excitement, immediately beginning to plan for Sherlock something he can’t believe he never thought of doing.
This mind palace sequence is VERY similar to when Sherlock was explaining to John about how he was breaking into Magnussen’s office in
The entire diner scene, in fact, seems to me to be Sherlock trying to appeal to John’s love for the secrets and danger of their past lives. This is still early in the episode and Sherlock still doesn’t understand that what he did was wrong. Because John always forgives Sherlock, right? No problems, let’s just move on. However, John’s just fresh off of a
a very low self-esteem, probably due to being a bit of an outcast who’s not ever been appreciated for his talents. This is made clear in
Though I thought here they all were looking at someone (a client) telling what happened with the bride, Sherlock stopping them from talking because there was an incoherence about their story - but your theory is valid.
Alright I have been wanting to write this for a really long time, as I actually have been asked for my thoughts on the Extended Mind Palace from a number of my own mutuals and followers and have been tagged in posts about it in the past. It took me so long to do this because I just had NO IDEA how to start or how to collect my thoughts together into a cohesive string of thoughts. Then
John’s completely wrong belief is that he was kept out of the loop for the past 2 years because he just wasn’t trustworthy enough for Sherlock. It explains his cautious behaviour towards Sherlock the rest of the season – he forgives Sherlock, that I believe, but the tension is
Sherlock must have seen something that pleased him, because his eyes twinkle, and the eye corners crinkle in that way that they do when Sherlock is genuinely, truly happy. He pulls John’s head to himself again, and touches their foreheads together, closing his eyes and breathing through his nose. Sherlock’s arms come up around John’s neck and plays with the hair at the base of his head tentatively. It sends a shiver down John’s spine, which Sherlock must feel, because Sherlock continues to do it a little more confidently.
!” John reached over and grabbed the teacup from the table. “I’m not having you burn yourself too because you’re in a stubborn strop. Now sit up proper; you can’t drink your tea upside down.”
“I agree!” said John, responding to something Sherlock apparently said out loud. John looped his arm into the crook of Sherlock’s elbow as they began to walk.
Now, don’t misunderstand me. I truly think that Sherlock has always had a stronger emotional attachment to John than vice versa.
and during the first cab scene when Sherlock deduces John and John subsequently expresses his fascination. Sherlock’s “weirdness” is reaffirmed again in
about John’s sexuality and previous infatuation with him, and rather than dealing with that, he decides, well, what’s the point. I’ve ALWAYS thought Sherlock has pined harder for John, than John ever has for him, largely due to the fact that Sherlock realizes he
. From there it had spiralled into something Sherlock needed to make absolutely perfect, lest John hate it and never want to do a Date Night with him ever again.
When they snuggle up, sated and sleepy, under the blankets, Sherlock in his customary “Little Spoon” position, he reflects upon just how lucky he is to be held by the man nuzzling his nose into Sherlock’s neck.
Listen, I have respect for those of you who have made it work, who take the time to write the theories and examine the series with as much passion as I do for TJLC. After all, I do stand by the principle of
Mrs Hudson looked up from her place and took in the anxiousness emanating from Sherlock’s tense body. “Well of course he does, Luv,” she stated, as if it were the most obvious fact in the world.
. As a creature of logic, I just can’t see that happening, and quite frankly, I will be very disappointed if everything I and many other spent years picking apart obvious textual and subtextual clues
, no, but Sherlock had so much of John’s heart that any relationship John tried to make while Sherlock was alive was doomed to failure. So, Sherlock being gone = John’s heart is able to belong to someone else.
happened during the Hiatus, mainly because it was a short webisode and was mostly played up for comedy value. However, I think it contains an important piece of evidence as to why Sherlock was so taken aback about the reunion: Sherlock thinks/knows all of John’s friends hate him, and he TOLD John that they hate him; He says he wrote an essay based on their suppressed hatred and gave it to John as a gift. Because of this, Sherlock feels he is John’s ONLY true friend
he’s probably feeling the weight of everything in his life, and the only thing keeping him going is Lestrade’s encouragement and “The Work”.
“Now, please tell me where you put my keys, Sherlock,” John stated softly, stroking his fingers soothingly on the spot behind Sherlock’s left ear that he loved so much. “I know you hide my keys every morning, Love.”
Here’s what I speculate: Modern bits will bookend the episode. The episode will start with John and Mary at the graveyard, giving us more questions than answers. Mycroft comes to get them. Fade to the airport and Sherlock standing by the plane, watching the car arrive, with the camera then panning to behind Sherlock to help establish that from here, this is in Sherlock’s POV. Literal fast forward to Sherlock sitting in the plane on the runway, and Sherlock’s hand touching his mouth. We then realize the “fast forwarding” was Sherlock storing away the entire tarmac scene within his mind palace. That’s the first 30 seconds or so of the 4 minutes. As he’s taking off, he’s thinking about John, Mary, love, whatever, and somehow we transition into the mind palace. Episode happens, transition out of mind palace, Sherlock realizes the attendant was talking to him. Modern bits of him coming off the plane, returning to Baker Street or whatever, and tie it into S4x01 somehow.
One of the men behind the woman came forward and punched John across the face, John bit his cheek as he let the pain wash over him. Once the pain passed, John spat a good amount of blood onto the floor and faced the woman in front of him.
John made a thin line with his lips, running over the evidence in his head and wondering how on earth that made no sense.
Professor Cairns turned around, placing a hand over her eyes to see through the projection light but she saw no one approaching her. The woman shrugged and continued with her work. The Golem suddenly appeared behind her, slowly approaching the woman when his massive hand came over her face, suffocating the woman.
They entered the window; the detective went in first and knocked over a vase but luckily, he grabbed it before it hit the floor.
The detective removed his gloves. “It was the wife. She learned the nature of her husband having an affair with her best friend and to get revenge, she murdered her husband. And she framed her best friend so she can rot in jail. The wife tortured her husband first, if you see the deep lacerations on the man’s wrists, its obvious that she tied him up and proceeded to acquire a knife and slash the man’s stomach. Congratulations, another case solved. Have a nice day Lestrade.”
Lestrade rolled his eyes at the detective. “And you can’t withhold evidence. And technically, I didn’t break into your flat.”
Sherlock adjusted the strap of the camera bag on his shoulder and took out the camera. “Very good to meet you. I’m Sherlock Holmes and this is my husband, John Watson. Sorry if he’s a bit quiet but he’s mute.”
Sherlock looked towards the closed door and waited for the perfect moment to move; Victor was halfway across the bed when the Alpha lunged towards the frail boy. The Omega boy moved to the side and went around the bed, he tried to move his scrawny legs as fast as he could but a large hand wrapped itself around his bony ankle.
Sherlock slammed the door of 221B Baker Street and squinted at the bright sun shining over him, the Alpha covered his face with his hand before foolishly stepping onto the street and bumping into someone. “Watch where you’re going, you idiot!”
John laughed as he hugged the detective, burying his face in Sherlock’s chest and holding the man tightly against him.
John bit down on his tongue and took the pain, shutting his eyes closed and not daring to give Jim the satisfaction of hearing him in pain.
So, with the usual insults of people who hated him, Sherlock went towards doing drugs, mostly heroin because once Sherlock injected the deadly poison into his veins, all the name calling and mockery faded away. And its exactly what he wanted, an escape to where the pain no longer invaded his brain. The only thing overrunning his thoughts were bliss and pleasure.
Sherlock turned around, his shirt covering his forearms as he looked at the blond. Already, John could see that something was bothering the detective and one wrong move or word could make Sherlock blow into raging chunks of anger.
John was barely entering the flat and heading towards the kitchen, repeating Mycroft’s unanswered question in his head and feeling absolutely lost.
John quickly straddled himself on top of Sherlock and the two men rolled around for bit, both trying to dominate one another but the blond managed to be on top. John straddled the detective’s hips and tightened his grip on Sherlock’s wrists, which were currently pinned to the floor. The detective thrashed against the blond’s hold but John simply tightened his grip.
“We’re the only ones left, Sherlock.” John was panting heavily while he rested his hands on his thighs.
Soo Lin gasped in shock, throwing the pot but luckily the detective grabbed it before the relic broke into pieces.
Sherlock faced Greg in full rage, walking past the D.I. and entering the flat. The detective slammed the door shut behind him, stomping his feet up the stairs and reaching for his silver gun. In a matter of seconds, bullets were flying towards the wall.
“Of course, anyways the boy, Carl Powers, had some kind of fit in the water, but by the time they got him out, it was too late. There was something wrong and I couldn’t get it out of my head.”
“What, and I didn’t notice it? Me? I didn’t notice?” Sherlock looked at John. “That’s impossible, John sent a text message to the phone and he called back.”
Sherlock placed the paper flower inside a plastic bag for evidence when a Detective Inspector came in.
Awkwardly, the blond left, leaving Sherlock puzzled. John closed the front door behind him and decided to walk around the park for a bit.
Since the man wasn’t answering, the detective continued talking. “Okay, tell me this, your sponsor. Who was it? The one who told you about me — my fan. I want a name.”
Sherlock, John, and Greg stood inside 221C, eyeing the vacant flat. It seemed more like a basement that was empty of furniture, an abandoned cellar with patches of paint peeling off the walls and mold gathering everywhere. The only thing out of place was a pair of shoes resting in the middle of the living room.
Jim made small dance movements while his hands were in his pockets, taking baby steps towards Sherlock. “Oh, did you like the little touch I added by giving Johnny boy my number. You see, my number was meant for you sugar plum but when I saw John Watson… oof, he struck me like lightning and overrode my attention for you to him. Touch of jealousy never hurt anybody, did it?”
Mycroft tightened his grip on his umbrella, he fucking loved sweets but his physical form was prone to gaining more weight if he indulged himself in sweets. “Is this some sort of a bribery?”
Moriarty looked back at Sherlock and rolled his eyes. “Don’t be silly. Someone else is holding a rifle. I don’t like getting my hands dirty. I’ve given you a glimpse Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse of what I’ve got going on out there in the big bad world. I’m a specialist, you see. Like you.”
Sherlock immediately noticed the change in the blond’s body and complimented John’s progress. The detective couldn’t help but test a theory that concerned the blond.
Sherlock was inches away from taking the pill, when John busted into the room, not hesitating to shoot the killer, pulling the trigger and letting a bullet fly towards the man’s chest. The detective was not prepared for the sudden outburst, but he quickly threw the pill to the floor and loomed over the dying man.
“Oh good! You’re finally catching up. I’m sorry I was internally vomiting at the sight of you displaying sentiment towards a nobody.”
gender was highly thrived into. But London needed stability, power, and dementia. All the people scurrying around London didn’t have the slightest requirements to even taking the position of controlling London.
John motioned for Sherlock to come closer. “Where is it?” Sherlock questioned as he rushed over to the blond, looming over him to see the screen. For a split second, the detective took a whiff of John’s cologne lingering on the man’s jumper and he seemed to enjoy the smell.
John was surprised as to how this man knew he wanted to get the knives. He backed away and tried to see what else he could use against this Sherlock.
But the main question that scurried throughout his brain made him wonder if he made the right choice.
John hesitated but one look into Sherlock’s ocean blue eyes and he gave in. They both walked quietly. “You know, we haven’t actually met properly.” The detective stopped and extended his hand. “I’m Sherlock Holmes.”
John brought the engine to life and drove out of the garage, heading to Roland-Kerr Further Education College.
John shook his head, not knowing what the hell she was talking about or… actually was she talking about the jade pin?
Three years later, John moved houses and since then Sherlock has never laid eyes on him again. To a certain point, Sherlock forgot about the existence of John until his attendance to boarding school forced him to encounter the one boy who managed to slip away from him. Their encounter was not equivalent to love at first sight; in fact, their first encounter was like two forces deciding whether to collapse against each other or repel from one another.
John continued his education and he got his degree in medicine and pursued the desire to be doctor. With his heart in his mouth, he went from hospital to hospital trying to get a job. Each hospital wouldn’t give him a job because he was mute. John tried his best to convince those who rejected him that he can flourish in a hospital environment but he was harshly waved away. He gave up trying to get a job as a doctor, then one day he decided to join the army.
John had to work an early shift this morning, so after he left work, he bought two sandwiches and trudged up the stairs.
Sherlock apologizes but he’s expecting John to accept his apology with open arms. He was mistakened.
Greg sighed and showed Mrs. Hudson a folder that contained a bunch of cases. “Let’s see if these babies will snap him out of his trance.” Lestrade went upstairs and didn’t bother to knock as he entered Sherlock’s flat. “Sherlock?”
John stopped talking, not wanting to give the detective the satisfaction of letting Sherlock learn about his feelings towards the detective. Sherlock simply stared at John… waiting.
The King from the unknown kingdom who reached out to Siger Holmes came from the outskirts of London, the man’s kingdom pertained to agriculture. The negotiation of agriculture was disappearing, which meant that the man’s kingdom was on the verge of dying. Securing the marriage between the Holmes family was their only chance at surviving.
The detective tried to approach John but the shorter man was not having it. Sherlock panted out, “You can talk.”
Sherlock pointed at the man’s back. “Flabby, you’d think he led a sedentary life. Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent varicose veins in his legs show otherwise. So, a lot of walking and a lot of sitting around. Security guard’s looking good. The watch helps too. The alarm shows he did regular night shifts.”
The day had passed by quickly, the result of morning faded away in a blink of an eye. It was night already when Sherlock stepped out of the flat and saw the same homeless woman he approached earlier at the corner. Sherlock smirked when he saw John approaching 221B in a cab.
Before Soo Lin followed Dimmock inside his office, she faced John, cupping his face. “Thank you. For what you did. It was very brave of you. A man such as yourself is considered beautiful in my eyes. You are a diamond in the rough. Don’t let others tell you otherwise.”
“First of all, when I came to tell you about this case, you didn’t care. And now you do, why the sudden change? Never mind. You know how they never leave notes?”
They continued running on the roofs of every building in their path, John saw another gap ahead, but it was much bigger than the last one. With no fear, he leapt across the gap and landed perfectly well, while Sherlock simply jumped across the gap with no trouble at all.
Sherlock decided to change the subject; he didn’t fancy the idea of bringing up his failed attempt at letting John kiss him.
The first one to wake up from the bomb was Sherlock, black ashes of burnt paper were fluttering before him and the Alpha strained to move a muscle. Sherlock’s eyes flickered everywhere, his lashes fluttering quickly as he tried to compose himself.
Before Kirk could even comprehend what was going on, the doors leading to the main bridge were opened and phasers were going off.
“I never said that.” The detective opened the man’s mouth and retrieved a flower made of paper. “And yes, he was being threatened.”
The detective got up from the couch and stepped over the small table before him as he went towards the window, watching John leaving 221B.
John quickly went to take away the scary cat from Sherlock when John noticed the distinct smell clinging to the cat. Sherlock noticed the slight halt John took to smell the cat before John gave the cat to Mr Prince.
John couldn’t help but laugh, already feeling the adrenaline coursing through his veins and intoxicating his body. “You couldn’t beat me up even if someone gave you an instruction manual.”
Sherlock smiled widely, basically feeling his round eyes transforming into palpitating red hearts that spoke the silence of his adoration towards John. “Excellent.”
John went through tunnels that were decorated with graffiti, trying to find the similar paint but to no luck, he found none.
John shrugged at the detective’s absence and went to make his tea. Once his tea was done, he sat down in his armchair and blew over his hot tea. He took a few sips and remained quiet until his eyes reached over to where Sherlock’s violin was resting. The violin was next to the detective’s armchair and John simply stared at it.
The blond faced Angelo trying to explain that he wasn’t Sherlock’s date but the man misinterpreted John’s hand gestures. “Oh, no worries. Order anything you like, don’t worry.” Angelo faced Sherlock. “He’s a bit quiet but I like him. Good job, Sherlock.”
Don’t get John wrong, he loved Jim —who was an Omega— talking about his bonded life but at times the Alpha drifted off and searched for eye candy in the crowd. John was keen on finding someone to have rough sex with but that all changed when his eyes landed on the most beautiful creature that existed in the middle of this huge party.
John shoved Sherlock to the side and disappeared inside the kitchen, clanking the utensils and slamming the fridge door shut.
“Well, that’s wonderful to hear.” Mycroft happily remarked. “It seems Sherlock’s business is booming since you and he became… pals.”
Sherlock left Mr Ewart’s side and gleefully approached John; standing behind the blond and placing his large hands over John’s shoulders, sweetly lowering himself to John’s level.
“Well, that’s where this gets really interesting. Every door that opens in this bank, gets locked right here.” Sebastian gestured to the front desk. “Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet.”
John felt the raw aggressiveness bursting through his bloodstream, a shot of adrenaline converting his aggravated demeanor into one that even demons couldn’t conjure up. John threw his head back, hearing a loud crack that was probably due to the force of his head meeting Sherlock’s nose. The rebellious action caught Sherlock by surprise and my fucking god, Sherlock felt himself acquiring a sweet tooth for John’s insulant responses and he never wanted John to stop surprising him.
Alphas, Omegas, and Betas were fighting amongst each other to see which gender was capable of running London by themselves. Already the war between genders was a disaster; the murder rates of all three genders spiked up in a heartbeat, brutal violence was common between the three genders confronting one another, the destruction of the homes belonging to vulnerable Omegas were bloodbaths filled with carnage, and the respect that all three genders fought hard for, was destroyed.
Sherlock kicked down his chair and yelled as he felt a twitch of pain in his nose. Sherlock felt angry at his failed attempt to apologize and with all his force, he punched the wall, leaving a prominent dent.
Sherlock stopped circling John and stood before the boy, brushing his thumb across John’s cheek. “Do you have any idea who I am?”
A young woman entered the lab, poking her head from behind the door and happily approaching Sherlock. “Any luck? Oh, Sherlock, I didn’t know you had company.”
In a small panic of fear, Joe took Andrew’s body into his flat and a neat little idea popped into his head, an opportunity to get rid of the body. Joe opened his window, dragging the corpse with him and placing Andrew on top of a train, praying that the train would take Andrew’s body far from his home and Joe would feel the weight being taken away from his shoulders.
John stood his ground, pointing at the enemy besides James Kirk. “You have no idea who he is, he’s a consulting criminal and he’s responsible for all this!”
Once Sherlock saw John enter the car with Mycroft, he went over the conversation he had with his brother and wondered if he was growing feelings for the blond. A buzz from his phone caught his attention and as expected, Lestrade had a new case and needed the detective’s help. Sherlock grabbed his coat and left the flat.
Sherlock found a note directed to Soo Lin Yao and saw that it came from the National Antiques Museum. “This might help us. Let’s go.”
The storm was getting worse, the clouds were black and angry, and to Sherlock’s annoyed luck, the rainstorm outside was becoming a thunder and lightning storm. Sherlock looked out the window and calculated that every nine minutes, there’d be an enormous thunder roaring across the sky. The rain was getting heavier and Sherlock could already feel the dirt road underneath the coach turning into sludges of mud.
John thinks as Sherlock leans back into him, looking anywhere but at John. “You know that that’s not true.” John is sure that Sherlock
. Suddenly Sherlock is essentially rendered delusional and the theory threads essentially fall apart.
I started studying the narrative extremely closely, I would have quite possibly been behind it. It’s got many very interesting theories that tie up a lot of loose ends that I could have seen myself standing behind. But, and
The day was bright and the air was filled with smells that reminded Sherlock of his youth. He and John were in a small seaside town in the country for a case that happened to be having its annual carnival which brought many to its shores.
with him until season 3, but he knew at this point that he was the most important person in John’s life, and that’s got to mean something, right? This episode, Sherlock’s been forced to face his long-buried emotions after realizing the importance of John in
The case had ended spectacularly, with John finding the perpetrator before Sherlock even deduced who it was. He had proudly announced to Sherlock how he figured it out, not forgetting to praise Sherlock's skills
– something a strictly straight man probably would not do – and then subconsciously reveals his possible bisexuality to Sherlock in the episode following his “not gay” proclamations.
John’s eyes twinkle. “Sounds delicious,” he answers, walking into Sherlock’s outstretched arms. “All I had was a reservation at Angelo’s and this bouquet of flowers.” He nods to said flowers lamely, then puts them on the table at Sherlock’s place-setting, only then seeing the sunflowers and card Sherlock had put at John’s. John smiles back up at Sherlock, and Sherlock tugs at John’s hips to move him closer. John reaches one arm over Sherlock’s shoulder, and the other hand up to the stray curl, brushing it back into Sherlock’s other curls.
– John may not necessarily be unable to lie, but he has a lot of physical tells that, if anyone were to observe John, they would be able to discern whether or not he is hiding something
And yes, it is extremely frustrating that they use them so openly in the episode. The thing is, when examining the series as a whole and going in

won’t go unappreciated,” Sherlock mumbles, now making sure John sees him take a hearty gulp of tea. He turns back so his spine is now leaning once again into John. John chuckles and sits deeper into the sofa.
Mrs Hudson’s eyes watched Sherlock’s hands quickly play with the clicking bits on the cube. “Oh, Sherlock,” she sighed, putting down the celery in her hands and walking over to Sherlock. She placed a gentle touch on his shoulder; his fidgeting calmed slightly. “That man is so gone on you, and he knows how much you care about him.”
John sighed contentedly, patted Sherlock’s head, and pecked him one final time. “Love you, Sherlock. Have a good day.”
My theories pretty much follow theirs, so it’s silly for me to say something already perfectly said.
, because it is my thoughts completely. Read those, and then come back here and read my thoughts on it after, because I will be writing on the assumption that you understand some of the core theories about EMP.
That didn’t mean he wouldn’t indulge a bit first. “Under the sofa, left hand side, behind the front leg,” Sherlock replied, reaching around John’s waist to give him a light parting hug.

“Let me take off my cast, John.” The ‘obviously’ is implied in the statement. John rolls his eyes as he puts water into the kettle and flicks it on.
As warmth-and-constancy said, there’s always BLATANT visual cues and abrupt transitions that Sherlock is in his mind palace, and the writers have rarely strayed from this pattern.
Sherlock knows it’s his fault for that. He leaned his head onto John’s shoulder, a silent apology, and John returned the gesture by pressing his face into Sherlock’s hair, whispering “it’s okay” and then turning his head to face forward but still against Sherlock’s skull.
filled his space again as John leaned over to kiss his forehead. “Thank you, Sherlock,” John replied, caressing Sherlock’s cheekbone as his hand brushed down to Sherlock’s shoulder, where John squeezed gently. He wandered over to the spot Sherlock had directed him and bent over, his trousers pulling tightly around John’s beautiful, muscular arse, and bunched up suggestively near John’s groin, from the angle he could see.

“I just want to impress John,” Sherlock muttered as he returned to the kitchen, showing the recipe he had chosen to Mrs Hudson.
John bundled himself in a black leather jacket, a beige jumper beneath, dark blue jeans, and brown dress shoes. He occasionally had to sneeze and he hated that he’ll show up at Sherlock’s flat, sick. John reached 221B Baker Street and stuffed his tissues in his pockets and knocked on the black door. He waited patiently until he heard footsteps approaching the door.
Sherlock was rather confused at the proposition and immediately felt uncomfortable, he kept asking what was the purpose of this meeting. Victor smiled coyly and told Sherlock that he wanted to see the Alpha’s cock, and if Sherlock did what he asked then Victor would show his penis to Sherlock. The Alpha shook his head and decided to leave when Victor pulled Sherlock back.
“Woah. Woah.” The Omega fell to the ground, he cradled Sherlock’s head and tried to stop the foam from getting worse.
Lestrade began to give the detective basic information about their victim. “Her name is Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards. We’re running them now for contact details. Hasn’t been here long. Some kids found her.” He entered the room containing the body, with John and Sherlock behind him.
Sebastian threw himself back in his chair. “Go on, enlighten me.” He smiled at John. “Let’s see your husband in action. Two trips a month, flying all the way around the world, you’re quite right. How could you tell? Are you going to tell me there’s a stain on my tie from some special kind of ketchup you can only buy in Manhattan?”
“This is a witness, she was close to being murdered if it had not been for John. She can tell you everything about the killer. Van Coon and Lukis were working for a gang of international smugglers. A gang called the Black Lotus, operating here in London right under your nose.” Sherlock said as he approached Dimmock.
The Omega boy noticed that his eye was on the verge of being completely shut and his lower lip was viciously split open, he continued pouring water over his wounds but even the process of cleaning his injuries felt like red hot pokers burning through his dainty skin. The pain made the boy whimper loudly. Sherlock grabbed paper towels and dried off his face when the Omega exited the stall and stood next to him.
Jim came to stand on his feet, John’s blood covering his fingers while he walked towards Sherlock. “Mm? Oh… that? The missile plans.”
Before John could answer, John felt an unbearable pain at the back of his neck followed by the sight of pitch darkness.
“Ah, right. Labels. No need to explain. Well, I’m glad you could make it over, we’ve had a break in.” Sebastian got up from his seat and led the way. “Sir Williams’ office — the bank’s former chairman. The room has been left here like a sort of memorial. Someone broke in late last night.”
Sherlock took a peek before facing John. “Well, he has a distinctive look. He has to hide somewhere where tongues won’t wag… much.”
John had a busy late-night shift; the heavy impulse of sleeping was overwhelming his body. John sat down at the desk, watching the detective examining the symbols when in a matter of seconds, John fell asleep. The softest snores were escaping his mouth.
John exhaustedly shook his head when his body fell limp, his breathing barely audible. “No! John! Stay with me! Come on! Don’t do this to me!”
John panicked at the sudden force and instinctively used the heel of his hand and thrusted it upwards, meeting Sherlock’s nose. Sherlock released John and held his nose while he groaned at the pain. John took the opportunity and ran away. The detective’s eyes were watery from the pain in his nose, at least it wasn’t broken but it would swell horribly. He shouldn’t have grabbed John,
The detective observed the blond’s chest and stood up from his seat. “I see the constant fighting lessons has improved your physique.”
Golem remained still, placing more pressure on the woman’s face and tossing her dead body aside. The tall man pressed all the buttons on the machine, making the entire theater go black when flashes of light appeared everywhere like broken flickering lights that never stop twitching. Sherlock and John couldn’t see the Golem throughout the blinding lights.
Sherlock crouched forward, hugging his abdomens when he felt John jumping on his back. The blond wrapped his arms around the detective’s throat and hugged Sherlock’s abdomens with his legs.
The detective looked at his watch again. “Thank you. Now, in about seven seconds your uncle will appear and you will leave.”
Sherlock immediately pocketed his flashlight and faced John, placing both hands at either side of John’s head, holding him in place.
This was the second step to starting a revolution and the last step to commencing a full rebellion against the government was the removal of rights for Alphas. Once that statement was pronounced throughout London’s televisions, radios, internet, and social media; Alphas lost their position in supremacy.
But that primal instinct was hindered when he managed to catch a whiff of the boy’s scent; the Alpha snarled when he smelt a river of watermelon sugar, its as if the gods gifted the humans with an abundance of ripe watermelons that were crushed and transformed into silky juices mixed in with buckets of sugar.
The detective simply stared at the blond, fascinated by John’s intelligence. He was happy to have rudely insulted this man and apologized afterwards, for now they can become closer. “Would you like to live with me?” Sherlock noticed that John didn’t say anything, so he continued talking. “As I said before, finding a flatmate is quite difficult and I feel like we both get along quite nicely. Plus, we can split the rent and you won’t have to worry about getting too many shifts in order pay the rent for your flat.”
The blond was reaching for his jacket when he saw a drawer slightly opened, his curiosity got the better of him and he opened the drawer, revealing a gun. John checked if it was loaded and he figured that he might need the weapon. The blond tucked the gun behind him and slipped on his jacket when the clock stopped, exposing the location of where the killer was. He checked the location and immediately knew where this was, now, he just needed a car to get there.
The detective offered John to sit in the armchair, “Please, have a seat.” He sweetly smiled at John and faced the door. “Mrs. Hudson!”
Sherlock displayed all the photos taken at the bank on the wall, studying them and going through all the symbols that belonged to each culture, wondering what they meant. He remained quiet as he entered his mind palace.
The burn from the bullet wasn’t a lovely experience. Joe had no other choice but to sit on his couch and explain the death of Andrew West. Joe explained how Andrew flashed the memory stick before him and since Joe had many debts that revolved around owing money to wealthy and dangerous people.
Sherlock felt his breath stuttering, his throat was thickening as his brilliant mind began to fade into despair and fear. “John? John, wake up. We have to go.
John rolled his eyes and slipped out of his seat, coming face to face with Sherlock. “Bold of you to assume that my only topic of conversation involves you.”
, their ‘guest of honor’ was John Watson. Sherlock felt his heart stopping when he realized it was John...
Bainbridge was reloading his gun in a hurry, trying not to get killed. During the shootout, John managed to use the protection of the train to stay hidden. John reached for his gun and waited for the perfect moment to abduct at least one of the werewolves. Fucking hell. John looked at the pillar where the apparent vampire was hiding behind and snarled, no wonder the pale Alpha seemed so off because like him, the Alpha was an agent.
Of course, he needed to pay at the stupid chip and pin machine, a technological device that never cooperated with him.
Don’t get Sherlock wrong; he never cared for love interests or infatuations that usually lasted about two weeks for any average or shall Sherlock say, boring person. In fact, Sherlock believed that the reduction of one’s attention towards a single person was an opportunity to let others take a knife and stab you from any blind spot available to them.
Then Sherlock noticed a book that was checked out from West Kensington Library, taking the book with him while calling out John’s name.
Mycroft quickly deduced John’s impatience to ask questions. “Please John. You can speak. I know sign language.”
Sherlock cocked his head to the side. “I was just chatting with your secretary outside. She told me.”
John knitted his eyebrows together, shrugging his shoulders, not really knowing what Shan was asking.
“Perhaps. I like the way you normally dress; you always manage to combine an outfit with toned down colors. They always look nice on you.”
The detective was this close to becoming angry, if John thought that he needed to publicly announce that he would run after Soo Lin and proceed things with her, then John was mistaken. Sherlock was about to speak when John came back, oddly enough, Soo Lin wasn’t clinging onto John’s arm or kissing John on the mouth.
The Alpha made the effort of looking at John and continuing with his deductions. “Obviously, your face is tanned but there’s no tan above the wrists — you’ve been abroad but not sunbathing. That suggests the original circumstances of the injury on your left shoulder is probably traumatic since you favored your right shoulder to carry me on.”
John took in calm breaths, not showing any inch of fear to the man licking his face. The blond threw his head back, head butting Jim in the face and elbowing Moriarty in the ribs. Jim stumbled back at the sudden hit but immediately held his hand up, signaling the snipers to not shoot John. Moriarty rested his hands on his knees, laughing lowly as he watched droplets of blood dripping from his nose.
But because Sherlock absorbs everything “John” like a sponge, that first negative reaction put him off and
I can’t help to think that, “mind palace” is basically being used as quick explanation for all the things that happen that doesn’t make sense
Just as Sherlock readjusts the sunflowers in the vase again, he hears the door to 221 open, and John’s angelic voice calls out a greeting to Mrs Hudson. He hears John’s voice rise up in an intonation – possibly asking her if she’s making something
while explaining the situation to the local police. John had stood tall and proud, maintaining his military bearing throughout the entire conversation, taking charge of the room and filling it up with his presence.
Sherlock subtly adjusted himself as he stood up and walked over to pick up his iPad on the living room table, opening up the web browser where he tabbed a recipe for vegetarian shepherd’s pie, something John had mentioned once that his sister used to make for him whenever she was sober and he stayed with her on leave from service. It’s not that he ever expressed a particular fondness for the meal, but John loved all the food that went
, John uses a lot of terminology to describe his getting married to Mary that suggests that he was in love with Sherlock
makes a change in their relationship status until John does, all because of one singular incident that I think Sherlock has never “deleted”: When Sherlock calls John his friend in
“I made you dinner.” Sherlock straightens up to his full height, putting his other hand in his pocket and subtly pushing his rear out just a bit to enhance it. His untameable curl pops out of place and drops in front of his eye. He tries his best to ignore it.
He smiles at his reflection giddily, noticing the flush high on his cheekbones; he pinches them a bit to keep the flush there long enough for John’s arrival home, and then rubs some vanilla-scented body lotion into his face and neck, rubbing the remainder into his hands. He decides against shaving, thinking the light dusting of stubble he managed to grow makes him look rather dashing; he has a hard enough time trying to grow it at all, so he thinks perhaps tonight John wouldn’t mind seeing a bit of it.
Well, glad you asked, because I think that these little snippets point us directly to an underlying subplot beginning in
I think this is spot on, but the larger question for me is is it for show and protective… or do these characters actually believe this faulty self-analysis to be true,
smile that Sherlock had yet to build up a defense against, and he always inevitably gave in to whatever John wanted.
where John gave his heart to a man and it hurt him, so he really did try not to fall in love with a man again.
“Well, since you asked so nicely,” John admonished halfheartedly, not really annoyed at all since Sherlock’s mood was already immensely improved all because he could now be closer to John. Imagine that.
, but he will not forgive her, not for real. Mary plays an important role in the whole Moriarty debacle, that I am certain, and she’s literally a plot device put there as an obstacle to Johnlock.
and her role completely makes sense to fall exactly where it does in the current narrative arc. John has realized that Sherlock will always be his option, he’s just waiting for a word from Sherlock
“Oh, Sherlock.” John shuffles his arm out from under Sherlock and wraps it around him, his other hand taking Sherlock’s teacup from Sherlock’s shaking hands and putting it on the side table next to John’s. He feels Sherlock shudder a breath as John wraps his other arm around Sherlock, and nosing his face into Sherlock’s hair. “You silly, silly man.”
John was spending too much time around Sherlock, he decided, if he was getting too observant to know yet another thing Sherlock thought John didn’t know he did. Sherlock found, once again, that it didn’t bother him as much as he thought it should – he loved that John was the one and only person who knew Sherlock better than himself. He
Sherlock’s butterflies twittered happily in his stomach. “Mmm,” was his reply, grabbing his pen to jot down a note in his Moleskine. John knew Sherlock loved him, silly to repeat something John already knew… right?
Sherlock is relaxed and content as he succumbs to sleep from the feeling of their two heartbeats becoming one.
Anyway, are you seeing how convoluted this is getting? We’re turning Sherlock’s head into a whole other world, which poses the risk of becoming a reboot. There’s a lot of stipulations that must be taken into account, all of which REALLY destroys the current narrative and over-complicates things.
The point I’m trying to make is that John tells half-truths rather than full out lying – white lies, if you will. Sherlock
He sets about to light the candles around the flat, closes the curtains – it would be dark in an hour or so anyway – and starts a fire. He pushes their chairs closer together, setting them at perfect 45˚ angles to the fireplace. He walks back to the table to realign the utensils, then pops the cork on the wine to let it breathe.
“Well, it certainly smells like it is most definitely your area. The flat smells divine.” John pulls back, much to Sherlock’s annoyance. “Why don’t you get us some of your delicious concoction, I’ll cancel Angelo’s and we’ll have a night in, just you and me. A perfect first date night, wouldn’t you say?”
Sherlock couldn’t help but giggle to himself deliriously, which caused John to look over at him over his shoulder and beam a toothy grin. Sherlock’s stomach did a small somersault as he stupidly held up his phone, showing John what he was doing. John nodded and resumed the pose and held it, cheeky grin still present on his face.
It has to be a special circumstance the requires him to think in terms of 1895. Maybe he took a bad hit of…
John can’t help but giggle at the seriousness of Sherlock’s demeanour. He moves his head so that they’re touching cheek-to-cheek.
John released Sherlock when they arrived at the booth, and reached into his pocket for a tenner. “I know you like seeing me shoot, Sherlock,” John whispered coyly to Sherlock, glancing at him and smirking.
explained a bit more about the unconscious theory that Mia presented in this post, and it led me to have another epiphany on a secondary theory for the Mind Palace.
of the food John liked and put it into one place, something domestic and comfortable, and make John want to stay with him forever.
And now as I reread this, I’m seeing I went all over the place, but I hope I touched upon your point, Nonny. If anyone cares to expand upon or offer a different view for Nonny, have at it! :)
John gulps, inhales heavily, ogles Sherlock’s lithe form up, down, up again and stops his leering on Sherlock’s face. “I’ll say. Actual food, or you?” John jokes as he closes the door behind himself. He starts slowly towards Sherlock, his tongue licking at his lips.
“I think it would be better with you there.” Sherlock rubs his thumb over John’s knuckle as he heaps another forkful into his mouth.
I agree with you 100% that this is a special mind palace, and it does go a bit out of control. Why, I don’t know; perhaps Sherlock’s feelings are overwhelming him and this is how he’s dealing with it.
: 4 acts means resolution in S4, ergo EMP is the resolution. I concede that point 100%. BUT. I have also been following setlock, and from what I see, S4 is anything BUT a

Sherlock wasn’t sure if he was supposed to feel touched or turned on. Was both okay? He hoped so, because his penis had its own opinion on the matter.

A pillow hits John in the head. Apparently not; Sherlock sees John perfectly fine enough to aim directly for his head and have the pillow land on top of the newspaper he was reading so that it crunches out of his hands.
Besides, Sherlock had a Very Important Thing™ he had to do today, and John needed to be away for a few hours, as much as it pained Sherlock to admit.
I think it will be proven that John is, in fact, a great liar, since, you know, it has subtly already happened. No man is a doctor and a soldier AND Sherlock Holmes’ best friend without being able to hide SOME things. Either way, I’m rather enjoying the rather meta way that TPTB feed us their own half-truths and lies to protect what they love and look forward to having the real truths revealed.
He and John liked to share meals, and they liked spending time together, alone, away from everyone else. When she said, “Oh Sherlock! You can cook him something! That would mean the world to John, what with him always making dinners for you!”, Sherlock promptly began scouring his John Files for '
Sherlock merely returns his gaze back to John’s eyes, sadness ever-present within the depths of his stare.
which signifies John’s emotional distress). Sherlock knows that John was and probably still is constantly followed and watched,
It’s all about the narrative structure essentially falling apart. To rewrite the series as it is now is to prolong the Johnlock arc when it
Even at the end of the episode, Sherlock sort of confirms John’s assumptions of Sherlock’s constant following:
wants. Remember, to him, love is a vicious motivator in many of the murders he investigates, so he probably has a very negative view of what true love really is, and probably is refusing to call what he’s feeling love. If you’ll notice, after Sherlock realizes Molly was in love with him at Christmas, he stopped being callous and conniving with her the rest of the series: He was blindsided about the fact that people just may actually like him for being himself. So when Sherlock hears Irene’s declaration of his and John’s coupleness and John’s not-denial of her “look at us both”, Sherlock’s head is in a weird space – for the first time this series, his eyes have been opened to John’s feelings for him.
That last one wasn’t very helpful, in hindsight, since most of their pre-couple dates involved Sherlock pining hard for John standing all sexily with a gun in his hand and sharing Chinese takeaway at 3 a.m. ‘
I have a theory / headcanon that a huge reason why we haven’t seen Harry yet is because I think she’s going to serve as LITERAL MIRROR for John… I think she might be John’s TWIN sister, and a lot of the reason he stays away from her is because he literally sees himself in her. He needs to face that in order to move forward with his life with Sherlock.
scenes is arguable when EMP essentially erases it from even existing, so I think a lot of my confusion lies in this as well: why argue about the validity of a scene in an episode that essentially doesn’t exist in a theory? EMP was brought to light
Sherlock thought weakly as he was coming down from his orgasms, watching John walk to the trash bin to throw out the dirty dog. Sherlock slouched on the bench blissfully and inspected the bee plush to ensure he didn’t ruin it too. Thankfully no, but a quick glance at the wet spot on his trousers and the uncomfortable wetness in his pants indicated that said pants were a lost cause.
indeed attracted to Sherlock as more than friends that Sherlock realizes that not only does Sherlock LOVE John, but he is
didn’t work. So what was left for him to do but tell a half-truth? Understand this and take it into consideration: I REALLY believe Sherlock DID NOT KNOW ABOUT MARY UNTIL
YES! I’m so with you on the inception part. (I think that’s what AA alluded the whole year in interviews and Michael Price, I think, tweeted we were about to get our minds bend.)  I’m still not sure, if the mind palace is the only explanation.
“Yes, Doctor,” Sherlock muttered under his breath. He heaved himself up to a sitting position, and, to John’s surprise, scooted his bum into John’s hip and pressed his back against John’s shoulder. “Tea, John,” Sherlock demanded as he held his hands out to his side, awaiting John to pass his tea to him.
The kissing starts softly, with Sherlock’s upper lip braving at joining in on the action. Sherlock wiggles his hands free from under John’s grip and replaces them back on John’s head, pushing John into his face once again. He becomes slightly more enthusiastic at this point, now insisting on sucking on John’s lips.
I mean… those six months. Are still completely unaccounted for. And that would have been the only logical time he would have been on drugs after finding out about Mary. I was going to suggest it takes place while he’s drugged in the den, but he was surprised about Mary true self, and I think in the Special he knows Mary is a murdering psychopath, so my next logical timeframe was the six months.
He scans his surroundings again – perfection. John would definitely want to stay forever now. It was homey and lovely and smelled like happiness.
Mrs Hudson tisked and flapped her hand at him dismissively, “Now, none of that Dear. John can’t possibly hate it, and it will turn out spectacularly. Besides, you know what he likes better than anyone, Luv.”
Now the way I see it there are two immediate reasons why -that are canonically possible- why he should be crying.
just the two of them at the end of it all – and I feel the it was a message to us that this is the endgame, and now is time to make the fantasy a reality.
“…And so are you,” Mrs Hudson tutted, straightening herself up and patting Sherlock’s shoulder. She walked back to the counter and continued to empty the bag’s contents onto the counter. “Cooking is just chemistry, Sherlock. You’ll enjoy it! All its preciseness will help you with your anxiety over tonight.” She glanced up and raised up her index finger. “But, you have to have
ANYWAY, nothing is EVER coincidence on this show. The fact that the mind palace made SUCH A HUGE reappearance in Season three is not a coincidence. They wanted to get viewers used to how Sherlock works within his mind palace when it’s his POV.
“Really?” John’s voice intonates as he feigns incredulity, which for some reason always flies right over Sherlock’s head. “And what would make you not bored?” John starts to get up out of his chair and heads to the kitchen to make some tea.
“And you were so looking forward to today, Luv! You wouldn’t stop talking about it! So, how about we get started?”
was basically an hour and a half of exposition. All that’s left is for Sherlock to confirm to John that he needs him and for the completion of the subplot arc of “Redbeard // I made me” that they were starting in full swing in TSo3 and hinting at since ASiP (“you know how it always upset Mummy.”) As for John’s character arc, it’s a LOT slower than Sherlock’s, and this is because we have to essentially establish that John:
To Sherlock, however, the casualness of mentioning John’s inability to lie may have been his way of trying to re-instil a sense of familiarity with John, like
His confidence started to rise as Mrs Hudson showed him all the measuring devices and how to prep each item that would go into the pie. He did have to concede that she was right – the preciseness of the recipe calmed his mind, enough that he even braved adding extra wine to the sauce, as well as some spice to the pie that he knew both he and John would like, which caused Mrs Hudson to praise him.
“Date night!” That’s what John had stated this morning after he kissed the top of Sherlock's head on his way past Sherlock hunched over his microscope. Sherlock had glanced up, and took in the morning paper rolled under John’s arm
with telling John lies that end up hurting him in the end. Which is why he did not hesitate at all to reveal Mary at Leinster Gardens, but because Sherlock still feels he needs to protect John, he’s now trying the “half-truth” method and tells a blatant lie later at Baker Street to convince John of Mary’s "not-so-crazy” streak and to get Mary on his side to assuage her suspicions about Sherlock and so he can also see what she’s up to.
at the contact. Sherlock is breathing heavily through his nose and John can feel his rapid pulse beating through the fingers holding John’s head in a death grip. John tries to pull away, but Sherlock grunts his disagreement and pulls John tighter to his face, wanting John to feel all the things he cannot say.
to name a few. These examples I cited are John’s half-truths used to survive: he lies about Hope so he won’t go to prison; he plays a role to gain trust with Connie Prince’s brother; and he’s
“Well, I wanted to be certain, you see,” John replied, taking the toy from the man, “Sherlock really likes bees.”
Sherlock snapped the photo, muttering a “thanks” under his breath. He gratefully didn’t melt into a puddle of goo, but his knees did weaken when John took his first shot, a
As they had left the local constabulary, John had suggested to Sherlock that they check out the carnival, for he hadn’t been to one since he was a child, and they didn’t have to leave until the morning, so why not?
But then Sherlock comes prancing in like a messiah and dredges up John’s old feelings again. Simply put, his marrying Mary was John trying to convince himself that he was over Sherlock, but that didn’t turn out so hot, John becomes bitter – which probably also factored into Mary’s growing frustration with him
“Mrs Hudson helped a little.” Sheepish, but not ashamed. “I’ve never cooked a big meal before… I needed a bit of, ah, instruction on how to decipher the recipe. Not my area.” Sherlock rests his nose on John’s head, inhales. Bliss.
, he knew it was some form of deep emotional attachment, possibly love. His time away only made his longing for John’s companionship stronger because now that he has experienced friendship then loneliness so the pining becomes a little worse. He gets John back, but John’s not
And boy, did he see. Sherlock's mind blanked briefly, his eyes blinking rapidly as he tried to regain focus of this monumental moment. How was the world still turning with John Watson –
See, one of the things that bothers me as a whole is that a lot of proponents for EMP are also the same people who accuse Mofftiss for being shitty writers, yet they believe that Mofftiss would be clever enough to come up with
I said,” replied Sherlock, swallowing another bite as if trying to prove a point. He showed John his chewed corn dog. John nodded, and proceeded licking at his own, which Sherlock just now realized was coated in mustard. Up, and down, John tongue went along the shaft – DOG. Along the dog – stopping to suckle at the tip again, then biting into it.
. If they’re willing to fill in the blanks after-the-fact in an S4 intro episode, then they’ll do it again.
Sherlock shoved the cube into his trouser pocket and shut off his microscope, sighing heavily. He lifted one of his hands up to Mrs Hudson’s arms around his neck, gripping it gently. “You’re right, Mrs Hudson. I just don’t want to ruin this. I’ve never made a full meal before, and John is so amazing and…”
John is angry about the accusation of his inability to lie, don’t get me wrong, but I believe that, at this moment in time with his own emotions clouding his thoughts, John possibly thinks that Sherlock may have actually been following him around for the past two years,
all day. Maybe check his prostate a few times. Many times. Why did John have to put his hands on other people? John’s hands were for
becomes the sole reason for Sherlock’s very being – his pressure point – which causes Sherlock to almost confess the depth of his care for him.
And there they sit muttering sweet nothings and confessions between kisses, tasting the sweetness of “I love you”, the bitterness of revelations and unspoken words, the tang of confessions of love discovered. They share in the glow of love confirmed, and the warmth of hearts once broken now made whole. They fall asleep together, there on the sofa, wrapped up in each other’s hearts.
, but now he can’t, and surely that’s enough to make anyone hate themselves, especially when they are one of the most observant people in the world and they couldn’t even figure out their own best friend’s intentions.
It was a silly thing to be happy about, but it really did help him feel better about sharing his creation with John tonight.
Said man, still holding his phone up in the air like a love-smitten statue, startled at the mention of his name. “Yes!” he may have said a bit too loudly. “Bees. John, bees, John. Bees. Yes.”
once Sherlock is discovered to be still alive: John HAS always been watched, and though he might not realize it, he did let the
John’s face brightened,”Ah! I haven’t had one of those since I was a kid! C’mon Sherlock, you’ll like them. They’re very sweet; you like sweet.”
. To bring us to your point, Sherlock can’t really understand why John has pushed him away because doesn’t he care about Sherlock? They’re friends right? This was always how they were with each other… and now for some reason John is angry with him, not delighted like he thought. Eventually they make up but their dynamic has changed.
as if it’s a given that whatever John knows, Sherlock knows. It’s just such a casual and random line, like Sherlock always following John is a normal occurrence in their relationship. And John doesn’t even flinch or seem bothered by the fact that Sherlock followed him.
And the set is very similar, as I said several times they reconstituted Irene’s living room in a field to mark the transition from reality to mind palace, and same with the bed appearing in that same field.
and having John realize this in Sherlock’s mind palace makes it a completely useless plot arc, in the end.
ASDASD NUMBER THREEEEEEEE OMG. Sorry, I had to add this to the main post because it was amusing to me. I still hold strong that the special is taking place in his MP during the plane trip. But there have been other theories, presented in this version I’m reblogging of this post, that are also very very plausible and a good alternative to my theories!
The pout on Sherlock’s face was, John admitted, annoyingly adorable. “But I caught the criminal and solved the case, ” Sherlock mumbled.
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mrs Hudson cooed, wrapping herself around Sherlock, giving him a hug across his back. “Now, none of that, Dear. You give the world to John, and he knows it. And he loves you just the way you are.” She squeezed him gently. “Now! We have big plans today, and you will show John just how much you love him! You know he adores it when you
Anyway. The point I’m trying to make is from a narrative stance, it doesn’t make any sense regarding character and world building, and from a financial stance, it’s a HUGE financial risk to the BBC if this was going to all be in Sherlock’s head –
, the part I’m interested in is the idea that there are different levels of your brain, that run at different rates of time per each level the deeper you go. It’s a good movie, read up more about it at the Wiki.
unattainable, that he is just as much a man as John. And we need this moment to happen when it’s just the two of them.
We won’t see the plane landing, but instead Mary, John, and Mycroft gathered around unconscious Sherlock in a room
. We don’t know when Sherlock got out of hospital. John has been established as a BAMF who doesn’t take any shit from anyone anymore, yet he’s seemingly okay with his not-wife killing his best friend. And Christmas is just such a transparent set up for Mary that it’s ridiculous people think it's actually genuine.
, when Irene goes literally in Sherlock’s mind palace to deduce the boomerang case. She was a construction of Sherlock’s mind, otherwise her presence is just impossible.
Flushing slightly, Sherlock exclaimed, “Yes! Yes, sorry, John, I just saw something I really liked and I just was surprised, is all.” It wasn’t a complete lie, after all. Sherlock liked John. A lot. Much more than humanly necessary, if he was honest with himself.
. John trusted, and Sherlock broke his trust by not trusting in return. For all intents and purposes, Sherlock was his brother-at-arms… in battle you can only trust your comrades, and John thought that’s what they were, but from John’s POV, Sherlock’s apparent indifference of the situation
The summation of my theory is this, based on what I know right now about the special from setlock and other people’s meta, and the 4 trailers / clips that have been released:
John hands Sherlock his teacup, which Sherlock delicately takes and brings around himself to his lips. He hums contentedly, which John feels through his shoulder. A second, bigger sip is heard, and a surprised “oh” escapes Sherlock’s lips. “You added extra honey!” he says, turning his head so he can see John in his peripheral vision.
Sherlock thought, flushing so red that he was pretty sure his clothes would catch fire. If that wasn’t one of Sherlock’s many fantasy lines coming from John’s mouth brought to life in unexpected ways, he wasn’t sure what was. He sat down on a nearby bench, wincing a bit as he realised he was now uncomfortably hard. He sat the bee plush on his lap to cover himself up and bit into his own corn dog delicately, nipping the top of the cornbread and dog off.
and pointed with the fingers of the hand that was holding Sherlock’s, as if John was deliberately doing it to ensure Sherlock saw.
. Imagine this if you will: John gets stabbed / shot, shit hits the fan, Sherlock goes to John and presses their heads together muttering how much he cares for John. That for me is the start of canon Johnlock. It’s fanfiction fodder, but hey, we all have our headcanons.
. Perhaps at first it was genuine elation at finally having someone around who could tolerate him, and in turn he became very attached to John, which was, judging by other characters’ reactions to John being around,
He shuts off the oven, leaving the pie in it to keep warm until John arrives home. Still a bit worried about the crispy bit, Sherlock pockets his cube and thumbs over the smooth, concave side of it, which he uses to ‘smooth away intrusive thoughts’.
For a tl;dr: my conclusion is that considering the shitloads of evidences, this is not a stand-alone episode at all. And the fact it will be set in Sherlock’s mind palace is more than probable.
“Well, you’re doing your best to try to convince me that you’re ill and deserve pampering,” John chuffs as he sips his own tea, holding it steady as Sherlock attempts to turn his torso around to look at John better.
“But I never tell him. I haven’t told him since I told him the first time!” Sherlock reached for his fidget cube John had got for him and began to twiddle it in his hands. It didn’t do much to calm his sudden bout of anxiety, but John had assured him that it would help.
never actually going through the character development, still stuck at the place he was when Sherlock started the simulation
John chuckles, and presses his lips onto Sherlock, caressing them, sucking on them, and finishing with a couple soft pecks. He pulls back, looks into Sherlock’s eyes. “You taste like cherry lip gloss.”
sort of plan in play at Christmas – Billy the chemist is there, C.A.M. has been summoned, Mycroft suspiciously leaves his high-security laptop out for his pick-pocketing brother to pilfer, and John forgives-but-not-really Mary for her transgressions. The only thing we are shown in that six month gap is Sherlock making a deal with C.A.M. which was the
With a Cheshire grin, Sherlock pushes forward once again, this time seeming a bit better at the kiss now that he’s at a better angle.
The WHOLE BLOG ENTRY is literally John being bitter at Sherlock because Sherlock didn’t trust him. The.

But if John is so terrible at telling lies, how did he convince Mary, who in
The 3G scene will be a solo John-and-Sherlock moment: no Mary in the middle, no Mycroft meddling…  just the two of them proving SOMEHOW that they need each other in their lives. To me that would be even closer than the tarmac was: It’s Sherlock revealing to John that he does have a heart, that he just really cannot function to his best without John in his life. This will be John realizing that Sherlock actually

Listen, if John didn’t go through his own character arc the past 3 seasons, wouldn’t it seem REALLY,
Sherlock looked at her thoughtfully, and stood up. A thought niggled at his brain: “What if it doesn’t turn out? What if John hates it?”
’s sequence, ALL of these characters are watching Sherlock’s thought train. HOW? John is the ONLY one who is the closest to knowing how Sherlock thinks and is able to follow his process. Mary, well, don’t get me started on that, and Lestrade just knows Sherlock does amazing things and that’s that. So how can they all be witness to this scene?
John returned, still smiling that stupid John-smile that made John’s face look ten years younger and was only for Sherlock. He reached out a hand to help Sherlock off the bench. “Coming?”
Sherlock frowned and watched John meander around the common room, lifting and replacing papers on the various tables and griping under his breath about someone being a “git” and where his keys were this time. If John wanted to do some doctoring so bad, he could stay at home, be one of those online consultants or something. Or better yet, Sherlock could lay out naked on his bed and let John examine
Glancing back up at the flat’s entrance, Sherlock furrowed his brow as he heard John descend the stairs. He then heard John call a cheerful goodbye to Mrs Hudson, whom he bumped into as she was coming up the stairs. John didn’t

I’m going into more detail about this in an upcoming meta, but long story short, by act 3 of HLV we already begin seeing John taking control of his own life. There’s a plan in the works there, I believe, and I don’t think anyone
Sherlock pinches his own cheeks again to regain the flush, smacks his lips to ensure the taste of the gloss is still there, and then thinks about where he should stand for John’s arrival. He has about 3 seconds to decide, for he could hear John tread his way up the stairs to their flat. He decides upon leaning his hand on the table, just slightly off to the side so John could see the sunflowers when he got in. He puts his other hand into the pocket with his cube, and fiddles with the five-buttoned side of it, which he pushes in time with John’s steps on the stairs. In the last second, he settles on putting a smouldering expression on his face.
“Yes, Sherlock, were you requiring my attention?” John asks sarcastically, turning slowly to look at the man pouting on the sofa, his casted, broken foot propped up onto one of its arms, and the rest of him sprawled out dramatically across the length of it. The look of utter annoyance on Sherlock’s face is more than enough to know what John is about to hear next.

Sherlock was surely drugged off his rocker. What if it’s an “Alice in Wonderland” type thing? Wasn’t there an opium-smoking caterpillar or something in that? I’m not super familiar with my fairytales, but surely someone can come up with something for that?
classmate’s face… but John shot him down, cue the internal little Sherlock crying alone in a corner of his mind palace. From there on out, Sherlock has NEVER elevated their friendship vocally to the next level until John does:
Love this, and I agree, though I would like to point out that Sherlock also says he’s a sociopath in his conversation with David. And refers to it when he tells Molly that not all the men she falls for have to be sociopaths. Still I agree!
that John was purposely flexing even harder just for Sherlock. John had even placed his free hand on Sherlock’s and gripped tightly, Sherlock knowing that John secretly wasn’t comfortable with heights either.
John had suspected awhile ago that Sherlock had at least some affection for John, at least where touching was concerned. Sherlock seemed to, since John’s return to 221B, go out of his way to create situations wherein John either touched him or make John notice him. John thinks it’s an underlying fear that John isn’t actually living there, that Sherlock is dreaming it all, and needs to prove to himself that John does, in fact, reside with him once again, and the only way Sherlock can do that, in his mind, is to experiment.

John halts in the doorway, taking in his entire surroundings with his mouth in awe, dropping his briefcase on the floor next to him. A lingering doubt starts to creep into Sherlock’s brain – fidget cube flipped to the dial side, spun counterclockwise, rewind the doubt back to its cave; better.
Now, I know not every EMPer is a TJLCer, and that’s fine. However, there is still subtextual evidence in every season of something going on in the background that MADE Johnlockers ship Johnlock; chemistry, running gags, “just have always shipped them”. Johnlock is about our love of these two together and being together, and EMP removes that all together
, and it’s clear to me that Mary is John’s crutch. All that aside, I think he had truly felt he was ready to come to terms with his previous feelings for Sherlock, admit them to himself, and is actually ready to move forward in his life.
“I did it because I love you,” Sherlock explains, leaning his forehead into John’s. “I don’t tell you ever, but I really do. Love you. So much that it hurts sometimes, John.” Sherlock tries not to panic.

Now, I’m sorry if it seems I got a bit off track from your initial observation, but I thought it important to see how
That said, I don’t understand why people think John has changed in S3; the progression, for me, was a logical next step; of course John is going to be angry at Sherlock for abandoning him. It’s stated RIGHT in the first episode that
The Alpha wanted to drown himself in the fragrance of wildflowers being covered in honey. The scent alone made John desire to suckle on the aroma while hearing the boy’s high-pitched cries below him as John’s colossal cock would tear apart the boy’s tight and virgin ass. It was truly, a dream waiting to come true.
Once Sherlock uploaded his findings, he posted the solution to the case on the website he used when Sherlock’s phone rang.
John wiped away the blood on his nose with his fingertips and saw the warm liquid staining his fingers.
“We were having a night in. Just watching a DVD. He normally falls asleep, you know, but he sat through this one. He was quiet. Out of the blue he said he just had to go and see someone.”
Mrs. Hudson giggled. “Oh, don’t be shy around me. Is he your boyfriend? Is he coming to live with you?”
The detective was studying the antiques behind the glass cases when he faced Andy. “What was the last thing that she did on her final afternoon?”
Soon after, John joined the detective and Soo Lin and to John’s happiness, Soo Lin knew sign language.
Sherlock nearly dropped both bee plush and corn dog as his cock made a bold attempt to let Sherlock know it was interested in the current proceedings.
“You did indeed, Sherlock. But that’s no excuse for hiding a broken foot for almost two hours. You’re lucky it wasn’t anything more serious than a hairline fracture.” The kettle boiled, and John poured Sherlock’s tea, adding extra honey into it. It was a treat he often gave to Sherlock in times when Sherlock’s moods were really black. It was also useful in making an impending dark mood dissipate immediately, for some reason. He poured his own tea and added milk, then grabbed the two mugs and proceeded out into the common room toward the sofa upon which Sherlock was liquefying. Sherlock’s gaze watched him the entire time, John noticing it already losing its irritated gleam now that John was paying him attention.
shortly before John’s arrival. The beauty of Sherlock and John’s story is that they have both come into each other’s lives when they each needed each other the most; suddenly, along comes this strange little discharged army doctor with a limp who
. “Don’t forget, Love.” John was searching the flat for his keys, which Sherlock secretly hid every morning, hoping that if John couldn’t find his keys, then maybe he wouldn’t leave Sherlock to go do something as banal as working at the surgery, away from 221B and, more importantly, from Sherlock.
And so, as the two men shared in food and drink, they chatted about each of their days, about everything and nothing, and about how happy they each were in that very moment.
Back to your ask. I’m so glad you mentioned Sherlock, because I love his character arc so much and he somehow wiggles his way into every point I’m trying to make.
, and something’s gotta give. If we hear these lines uttered again, I sure as hell believe we’re going to be this_close to our Johnlock Moment™.
Sherlock did like corn dogs, very much. And so did Sherlock’s cock, apparently, because it absolutely decided that was the perfect time to express its excitement by making a mess in his trousers. “Hnng!” he grunted, dropping his corn dog as John licked the mustard off his lips.
The thought breaks John’s heart, if he’s honest with himself. He’s loved Sherlock for so long in every imaginable definition of the word, and the thought that he himself had instilled that insecurity into Sherlock tears him up inside.
. Subtext and hidden meanings play such an important role in this series, and as with many things we as a fandom are learning, a lot of it really only becomes clear after viewing the series WITH series three in mind since subtext and hidden meanings are a HUGE part of making sense of
This man was gorgeous; his height kept going on forever and his body was nothing more than pure solid muscles. The stranger had blond hair that reached his shoulders and a well trimmed blond beard that nicely decorated his face. The man had crystal blue eyes; John swore that he could see the beautiful beaches in Hawaii through this man’s eyes.
and his brain levels would appallingly decrease to that of an ignorant human being. He couldn’t have that. Thanks to his brother’s ramblings, Mycroft managed to convince Sherlock to quit drugs and stick to cigarettes.
“Funny, to think that the only person to catch Sherlock’s eye would be a nobody. A man not even capable of forming words.” The woman laughed loudly.
The detective made an adorable puppy face and made his voice lighter, a friendlier tone assured the acceptance of a stranger. “Hi, um, I live in the flat just below you. I don’t think we’ve met.”
Sherlock sat down and opened his computer notebook. “Oh, I’ve been too slow. She didn’t have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone, so it’s a smartphone, it’s email enabled.” He pulled up the Mephone’s website. “So, there was a website for her account. The username is her email address…” The detective typed in the email address. “… and all together now, the password is?”
Sergeant Donovan wanted to punch Sherlock in the face. “I don’t…” As she was about to insult the detective, she noticed John. “Who’s this?”
A man by the name of Sebastian Moran came into the pool, a cigarette hung lowly on his lips while he dragged a person behind him. The unknown person had a black bag over his head, his hands were bound behind him and the probabilities of the person being gagged was highly possible. Sebastian dragged the person across the floor, throwing the man on the cold tiles of the pool and keeping the person in between Sherlock and Jim.
It was unnecessary to take such good care of an item that could easily be thrown away but it was all Sherlock had of
Sherlock was running out of options, he seriously wanted to know why John was not accepting his apology, it was bothering him. He wasn’t thinking correctly, which is why his next move was probably the worst choice. The detective lost his patience and grabbed John, “Just accept my apology, please!”
“Sherlock.” Mycroft crossed his legs. “I know that we both thought that we didn’t need companionship or partners to keep us happy. I was wrong about that, since I met Gregory, things have rippled out nicely. It may not show but I am happy with him. What I’m concerned about is how you’ll react when you reciprocate the same emotions of… sentiment towards John.”
“Jewish folk story; a gigantic man made of clay, its also the name of an assassin. Real name — Oskar Dzunda. One of the deadliest assassins in the world. That is his trademark style.”
“With pleasure.” Sherlock locked his gaze onto the smaller man approaching him and Lestrade, and continued his deductions.
Lestrade still didn’t comprehend Sherlock’s point. “But what has this got to do with that painting? I don’t see…”
Sherlock invaded John’s personal space and whispered into John’s ear. “How does it feel to have daddy’s cock stuffed inside you? Do you scream in pain or does daddy’s good boy beg for it like a pathetic whore?”
Sherlock simply leaned against the window, resting his hands behind his back and watching his beautiful city coming to an end. The Alpha watched a group of people running across the streets and lighting a vehicle on fire, Sherlock counted down the seconds before the engine made an enormous explosion and pieces of burnt metal flung everywhere.
Sherlock smirked, taking a pause in his deductions and enjoying the slight twitch running through John’s hand.
They walked away from the market stand when John noticed the same woman taking pictures of the detective and him. But as quickly as she appeared, she vanished.
Sherlock kept looking towards the back of the bus, trying to meet John’s gaze but his sunshine was stealthily avoiding making eye contact with him. After being on the road for a couple of miles, Sherlock couldn’t help but create chaos on the bus.
