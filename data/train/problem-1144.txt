"Ca'h we ma'ge some ya'der?" Sherlock asked as he took Greg's hand and began to slide bracelets on his wrist.
Mycroft, who had been leaning back against the kitchen counter, sighed as he pushed himself away from it and came over. "Go take a deep breath," he whispered to Greg as he passed him on his way out of the kitchen, and picked up the flannel.
Mycroft swatted a bare thigh with his fingertips. "Stop that. For the lavender one, we're going to try two red drops, then one blue one, and see what color that gives us. Can you do that?"
"You're not? Then who is this nappy for, hm? And who's going to wear that warm, cozy sleeper?" Mycroft asked, and began to rub lotion all over Sherlock's nappy area, as well as the backs of his thighs.
Sherlock gaped at Mycroft for a moment before twisting as best he could to see his own bum. “F'wowers?”
The baby whinged behind his dummy and tried to wiggle away...he didn't like nappy cream on his bum, and he
The kitchen was dimly lit by the light above the stove. Sherlock scurried over and put Baxter in his booster and sat himself at the table.
"Is not mad at you. In fact, I know he'd love nothing more than a cuddle right now." Mycroft turned him around and patted his bum. "Go on."
"No. But maybe we can have a digestive biscuit in a little while." Mycroft got up and took his plate to the sink.
"My'cob sh'ange?" Sherlock tilted his head back to look up at his brother, crumbs coating the corners of his mouth.
"Well, doctors don't actually bind broken ribs anymore, because they want you to be able to breathe deeply," Molly said, taking a small penlight from her bag. "BUT, if it gets really painful, you can use one of those, what'cha'call'em, ace bandages and wrap him in that. Just keep it to a half-hour at a time, then take it off and let him breathe."
Sherlock sat cross-legged on the couch, trying to lean to the side and watch what Myc was doing. When Mycroft stood back up, dummies in hand, he reached for them.
“He’ll change…both of us?” he asked. He liked the man well enough at times, but, well…their interactions never involved his bits before.
"They're in the drawer in the closet." Mycroft, already dressed in a tshirt and sleep pants, put on a dressing gown. "I need a cup of tea. Gregory?"
"Here," Greg said, handing Mycroft a dampened paper towel. "We were supposed to share, you little chocolate gremlin."
Sherlock turned his head away and grunted as he tried to sit back up…he wasn’t a fan of being restrained, never had been. “No…NO, Myc’off...up, up!” he pleaded when twisting and turning didn’t work. He didn’t like how his brother always (or at least 80, maybe 85% of the time) managed to be stronger than him. “Up now!”
"No'd sui'd an' no'd poo." Sherlock yawned, rubbing the uninjured part of his face on Greg's t-shirt.
Sherlock snuffled sadly and felt his eyes well back up with tears. “But…But, you said punishment is over?”
Mycroft got past the DVD menu and pressed play, getting the movie started. Once it had, he selected one of the soft, fuzzy throw blankets from the pile they kept in the room, and tucked it around his little brother before joining them on the couch.
Mycroft came in a moment later, hauling the nappy bag they kept downstairs. "Perhaps we should lay him flat."
are, therefore your hands are little, too." Mycroft handed him a plastic fork while Greg set a cup of applesauce next to his plate.
Fifteen minutes passed before Greg stretched in his chair. There was a limit to how far he could push ‘five more minutes’ before he ended up with a proper strop on his hands.
Mycroft thought as he hoped he didn’t have to pick him up and carry him. “No, they won’t,” he said, trying to coax Sherlock along.
"That's where all the jewelry is," Greg told her, patting Sherlock's hip while he sucked on his thumb and watched Molly.
“Shhhh, Jawn…don’t rile him up.” Though, looking down at Sherlock’s face, nothing short of a volcanic eruption could have disturbed him.
“You! You think you can tell everybody what to do! Tell ‘em what’s what, even if they know different.” Jawn had started to pace the length of the bed, waving his hands emphatically.
"You've had a smoothie before, silly goose," Mycroft said, using his own fork to feed Sherlock the rest of his chips and
"Ohhhhhh, CANDY worms." Greg instantly regretted not putting a bib on Sherlock as he used his hand to brush the milk off his chin. "I love candy worms!"
Jawn took a deep breath and blew a giant raspberry…he wasn’t getting to do anything now, and he wasn’t even in trouble. He turned sideways and squeezed beside Mycroft and Sherlock on the stairs; “What’s he cryin’ for, anyway?” he said, having to raise his voice over Sherlock now.
In the cab, John let’s go of his arm and sits as far away from him as possible, his small frame pressed firmly against the door. Sherlock aches to put his head in John’s lap and be stroked, he’s dreamt of it many times during the last two years, but he knows he wouldn’t be welcomed now. Instead he twists his hands in his lap until his knuckles pop in protest. A glare across the chasm of vacant cab seat leaves him cold and he settles for clutching them instead.
"Indeed. One caramel, one currant. Try them," he said, and popped the lids off of each one. "Just the tip of your finger."
Sherlock squinted at Greg before steepling his hands beneath his chin and surveying the yard. Greg choked on a laugh. The worlds greatest detective in a T-shirt and soggy nappy, with sand sticking to his legs.
"The peanut butter is crunchy; that's good enough." Mycroft picked out the biggest chunk of crushed shell, still in the shape of the whole egg, and tossed it into the sink.
Sherlock huffed and curled around Jawn. The nappy change had left the little doctor subdued, which left it up to Sherlock to air their self-righteous indignation.
"Poor little lamb." She cooed, her fingers carding through his hair. "Daddy will be back before you know it. And in the meantime, you and I can have a wonderful time."
The little detective twisted a curl around his finger. Rare treats were tough. 'Cause you didn't want to waste it. "I y'ike Cora'yine."
"One...you have to wait until ALL the cupcakes are frosted before eating any of them." Mycroft paused and waited for Sherlock to finish groaning. "And two...I don't want to see this knife anywhere near your mouth, understand?"
“Don’t yell at the baby. The only sharks here–” Mycroft took his gaze away from the conductor of their little parade just in time to see the last bit of composure on Sherlock’s face to collapse, and the first tear slide down his cheek. ‘
“Do you need to use the loo?” John asked. He let Sherlock stand in front of the toilet as he moved around him to run the bathwater. With a huff, Sherlock started to undo his robe. He had almost got it off his shoulders when John was behind him, helping him out of it. He was about to hook his thumbs into his lounge trousers, but John jerked them down to his ankles and Sherlock was forced to step out of them. Then the worst part came, John stayed in the room. He busied himself folding Sherlock’s things and putting bubbles in the bath, but he was still in the room. How did he expect Sherlock to have a proper manly piss with him walking around? He didn’t. There was nothing manly about Sherlock at this moment. He was about as little a boy as he could get. Blushing, he took a wee.
“No mooooooooooooore!” The little detective howled, and twisted out of Mycroft’s grip…well, Sherlock twisted, and Mycroft let him go because 1)he didn’t want him to hurt himself, and 2)because he was done with his hair, anyway. “I know, I know, I’m awful,” he tutted and, after taking pity on his little brother while watching him try to wipe the water out of his eyes with wet hands, took one of the fresh towels and offered him a corner to dry his face with. “And you’re overtired. Which is why we’re done.”
don't want to get in trouble, either." Greg set the plate down. "That's the thing about plea deals...one party is always going to be unhappy."
Greg noticed. "C'mere, baby," he said, sitting on the end of the bed and pulling Sherlock into his lap. "Let's see what else Molly comes up with."
"Yes, that would make it easier." Mycroft led them into the master bedroom and popped one of the dummies free of the plastic. "Climb onto the bed and sit there with bunny while I give this a quick wash. Wait for Gregory."
"Da'yee says, 'Sher'yock! I tan your hide'!" Sherlock made a mock-stern voice and shook a threatening finger.
"I know that, too." Mycroft handed the nappy cream to Sherlock to hold and went to dig in the dresser next.
"Oh," Sherlock pouted. "I wan' 'em on now," he said, and tried to shove his ring-covered fingers into the opera gloves...which, of course, quickly became stuck. "Oh no!"
Mycroft closed his eyes and took a slow, deep breath through his nose, his chin cradled in his hand. "...We may take you up on that."
“Jawn, please…let him borrow it, just for now.” Mycroft could hear Sherlock crying quietly and sniffling near his ear, while trying to watch where he was stepping as best he could with his little brother’s shoulder blocked 40% of his view.
“Yes, I know he did,” Mycroft sighed…he knew where this was going already, having had the same circular argument many, many times over today. “But I’m asking you to pick it up, because you’re a very good helper, aren’t you?”
“Come on Pet. Let’s go to bed.” John soothes as he feels Sherlock balk for moment, worried that Daddy is going to leave him on the naughty step, but John simply tugs his hand until they are heading up the stairs. “You’re going to sleep up here with Daddy so that he can make sure that you spend the rest of the night in bed.”
"Billy and Baxter soon came to a clearing full of wildflowers, where every color of the rainbow swayed in the breeze."
Sherlock waddled back to the table, where Greg had left his cup sitting. He picked it up in both hands and shook it; "A y'iddle."
"Nope." Greg picked up a plastic fork out of the bin, and made two little eyes; "...It's an Elephant Snow-man."
“This way men! We’re 40 leagues from shore!” Jawn turned and marched across the street, heading for Baker Street.
“It’s different to want a thing, than to actually have it, yea?” John murmured as he stroked gentle circles into the nape of his neck.
Sherlock stood at the bottom of the stairs, his eyes like saucers as he watched Mycroft haul Jawn down, smacking him the entire way while the little doctor squealed like a trapped animal and tried to kick out at anything in his path. When his older brother breezed past, Sherlock unglued himself from the bannister and scurried along after. “My?” he asked worriedly. “My, what doing? My? My’coff?”
Mycroft blinked at him for a moment before shrugging...it was likely to end in tears regardless, so why not. “Alright. Have at it.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes, but got up and returned to the kitchen. “A headache?” he asked as he retrieved another ceramic mug from the cabinet.
"Use your sharp eyes. Did we get all the shell?" Mycroft held the bowl out and Sherlock nearly touched his nose the the rim to examine the eggs. "I f'ink so."
The little detective sat on the floor, hugging damp sippy cups to his heaving chest as he struggled to keep from sobbing.
“I heard you loud and clear.” Ah, there it was. Mycroft pulled the slim book from the shelf and looked at the cover; ‘The Tale of Peter Rabbit.’
Sherlock pouted and looked down into the cup, where the water looked more black than green. "Waste?"
“Hm, I wonder if your bottom still warm?” Mycroft asked amicably, releasing the hold he had on Sherlock’s ankle to cross his arms over his chest.
"Good boy, such a good boy!" Greg pulled Sherlock close and wrapped an arm around his waist, then kissed his cheek. "I promise, no matter what Mycroft says...you're going to get a piece of that biscuit for breakfast."
"Such a tough little bean," Greg said as he brushed Sherlock's hair out of his face. "Have a few bites of cereal and then you can have medicine."
Mycroft sighed to himself; so much for that being a distraction. “Alright, if Jawn wants to sit and stink all day, that’s fine...”
Sherlock let out a disgruntled squawk about being rattled around, which for some reason made Mycroft laugh even harder. “I need to go to bed; I'm nearly as badly as you lot,” Mycroft said, wiping at his eyes.
Sherlock did a happy wiggle and held the egg over the bowl, biting his lip in concentration...then squeezed as hard as he could until it broke with a loud 'splat'. "I di'id!"
"Drama queen." John mutters as he lines himself up and leans into Sherlock, balancing his weight on his good shoulder. "Are you ready for Daddy's cock, boy?" And before he receives a response he pushes in, fully seating himself in Sherlock in one movement. The body beneath him writhes and it takes every part of John's reserve to keep from coming. No one can say John Watson isn’t one tough soldier.
"'Of course we can swim. It wouldn't be a trip to the pond otherwise.' Billy and Baxter walked through the forest, stepping over stones and mushrooms and the occasional peep toad, all the while staying very close together."
Jawn looked up as if he wasn't aware of Mycroft until that very moment. A big, lazy smile slowly spread across his face, and he nuzzled against the man's shoulder. "Hiiiii, My'coff!"
Mycroft put a nappy under him and settled his bum on top of it. The rest happened with the same clinical ease Mycroft seemed to give all tasks, and he frowned at that...Mycroft could have been doing some filing as far as anyone could tell.
Greg passed by them on the way to the front door. "Table's all set; he's got a bib laying on the tray of his booster."
"And really, what's owning a business I've never heard of after six of the loooongest years of my life!"
Sherlock chewed his lip for a moment, twisting the jumper in his hands mercilessly, before finally crawling into the crib. He flopped onto his belly and tucked Daddy’s jumper beneath his chin.
"No Pet, you didn't do it wrong. It's perfect. The most wonderful valentine I've ever received." John murmured as he pulled Sherlock to his chest, peppering his face with kisses until the detective was squealing with giggles.
Mycroft rubbed his little brother’s arm, half expecting a strop over whose turn it really was, but instead Sherlock watched Jawn for a moment before pushing his ‘bubbas’ into his big brother’s hand. “Open, My? P’ease open?”
Sherlock sucked in a breath as he stepped into the water. "I y'ike ships," he said, staring down into the water and looking unsure on whether he wanted to sit down in it or not.
He banged on the front door and Sherlock jumped, dropping his phone, then scrambled up from the floor and ran to open it. After fumbling with the lock and chain, Sherlock let Greg into the flat. Greg rushed in, nearly breathless, but immediately saw Sherlock staring at him, wide-eyed and shaking, and he tried to keep calm.
The battered little detective's breathing was slow and shallow, and he still held his cup in his mouth with both hands. His eyelids looked bruised, despite having slept heavily last night, but as far as Mycroft could see, the swelling on his eye had gone down a bit.
"Because I'm sure listening to you making threats upon his person is going to make him show himself again any time soon," Greg said dryly, putting a comforting hand on the baby's hip and rubbing.
“Not allowed,” Sherlock whispers, his hips working vigorously into the silicone cup. “Only can come from my cock… or not at all.”
"You hush, too." Greg laid on his back and scooped and pulled Sherlock on top of his chest so he could pat his back. "Everyone, go back to sleep."
"He'll live," Greg chuckled as Sherlock sat on his bum on the mud room floor and imperiously held up a foot, waiting for his bees to be put on.
"They gave him medicine so he's not in pain. Uncle Gregory says Jawn is very loopy." Mycroft glanced at the other patrons in the sitting room. They were all too consumed with their own grief to notice them. Sod it. He pulled Sherlock into his lap.
Sherlock giggled and bounced over to the sink, thankfully unbothered that his job had been taken from him. “No want cake?” he asked, feigning innocence.
Jawn immediately dropped onto the floor next to him and snuggled him close. "Lemme see it quick," he said, and tugged gently on Sherlock’s foot. The little boy whinged but allowed Jawn to pull his toe from his mouth and examine it.
"Gently." Mycroft intercepted and took it from him before Sherlock could get it into his mouth to chew off the cap.
Jawn barely breathed, and Sherlock didn't dare move while he clutched Mycroft's phone to his chest to hide the light...neither of them wanted Mycroft to wake up and reignite the fire in the backsides before sending them back to bed.
The little detective dropped his bottle and folded his arms across his chest, then shook his head. “I do movie,” he said, brushing past Jawn.
Mycroft shed his dress, picked it up from the floor, then folded it and put it away. "Sherlock," he said gently.
Greg hurried to follow Mycroft down the hall, bumping his nose into Mycroft's back when the man came to a sudden stop.
He carefully placed the large paper bag on the table and quietly tread his way over to the couch, where he took the blanket Sherlock had used to cover Jawn (which had been kicked aside during his absence), and spread it over the both of them. "You're both going to be grumpy and sore in the morning," he whispered, and stood back up. He was going to put the food away for now, and then go judge how clean the sheets on his little brothers' bed were before turning in for the night.
"No-no-no, you come stay with me, pet. Come here, come stand with Greg." Greg motioned with his head, and Sherlock slowly inched his way back and cowered behind him, trying to hunker himself down with his bottle and his bunny.
Sherlock watched as Mycroft carefully scooped two cups of flour into the sifter. "Go on then...in the bowl!"
“I think we’ve just officially counted out ice cream, don’t you," Mycroft said with a roll of his eyes. “Step down before you fall, Jawn.”
"Ah, yes, that's right...Baxter, that was his name." Mycroft wiped a dribble of milk away from the corner of his little brother's mouth. "Well, Baxter was a curious bunny, and his favorite thing to do was to go exploring. And his boy loved going with him, most of the time...but unfortunately, Baxter could be forgetful, and he would often get lost when wandering..."
“Bubba’s not a outside toy but whistle is?” Jawn sassed, moving his green car in lazy figure eights on the table top.
“Green.” Jawn watched Mycroft rifle through the cupboard, pulling out a pair of dark green trousers. “I should sit on the step with Sherlock so he’s not lonely. He’s always lonely without me.”
Jawn mumbled something that sound like "Sh'lock," which Mycroft took to mean 'Sherlock'...fingers being in their mouths made it harder, he admitted. "Will you lie with him and keep him company?"
" 'eeeeeggggg." Greg found Jawn sitting on the floor of the nursery, his tomato red little face covered in snot and tears. He held up his uninjured arm in a plea to be picked up. The other he held close to his chest.
There was a long silence that fell between the three men, all sharing the same sentiment, but none wanting to give voice to it.
"I'll go first then," John announced boldly, tapping the pen on the paper for emphasis. "Sherlock should always respect Daddy and others. He should not be rude or disrespectful."
"Nice diversion, dearest." Greg kissed Sherlock's silk covered knuckles and then helped him put on the other glove.
Mycroft kept his back to them as he placed the cupcakes on to a tray, and began to light the candles. "I'm sorry, pet...I don't sing."
“You don’t? Hm, there are an awful lot of cute, very comfortable-looking ones in here…and it would make it easier for me to see when you need a change.” Mycroft turned back to the bed, where Sherlock was laying on his back, playing with one of his feet. “What if Jawn gets to pick his own clothes out…would you like it better then?”
Jawn tried to wiggle out of the man's reach, only to receive the same swat on his bottom that Sherlock had received. “Settle down, Jawn.”
Sherlock wrinkled his nose at his brother. "Am dry. You soppy," he said, then squealed and scurried back to the table when Mycroft pulled his arm back and made as if he were going to swat him again. "Brat."
Sherlock hummed his agreement as he upturned a tiny porcelain frog and poured a small mountain of salt onto the table. "Maybe My can do that."
Mycroft rolled up his sleeves and slipped on a pair of gloves while the baby watched, enthralled, and he had a sudden flash of memory back to the days where both Holmes children would sit and watch Mummy in the garden; when it became his job to make sure a small, barely-toddling Sherlock didn't pluck all of the just-planted flowers.
Mycroft took a deep breath and reminded himself that this was Jawn; he was naturally protective of Sherlock. “A red bottom doesn’t stay red forever, lad. Look at Sherlock…does he still look bothered? Does it seem like I overstepped?”
Greg checked the temperature with his wrist and found it fine. That's when he noticed the pink-ish, sun-kissed look that started around Sherlocks' shoulders and trailed down towards the middle of his back. "How long were you outside before Mycroft remembered sunscreen?"
“More buttons, hmm? Still…very cute,” Mycroft said with an approving nod. He sprinkled Sherlock with a liberal amount of powder and taped him up, then helped him sit up to get him dressed. “Are you going to let me pull this over your head without a fuss?” he asked playfully, “…or are you going to scream bloody-murder again?”
"That's right, she's a little baby just like you." Greg rubbed his hand up and down Sherlock's back.
Sherlock toddled along after him, his cheeks flushing a splotchy shade of red. "I'sh no'd a goo' hiding p'yace, G'eg," he said, wiping the sheen of sweat from his forehead.
Sherlock lifted his head and turned to look at Greg with big, glistening eyes; "I, I j'us' wan'ned a hel'b," he sniffled, blinking back tears.
"Yes." Mycroft shifted them so he could pat the back of Sherlocks' nappy. "Admittedly, we both are."
“I y’ove ‘em.” Jawn holds the mobile of frogs up that Nana made for him up, “they hasta go o’ber our bed bu’ you dumb bees taked alla room!”
Sherlock whinged, eyes still closed, and Mycroft shushed him; "Shush," he tutted. "It was empty, anyway."
Mycroft dropped himself back into Sherlocks' chair and went back to his own cup of tea. “Jawn seemed interested in playing in our garden," he mused.
Now that he had Daddy’s full attention, he didn’t want it. Sherlock felt tears prick his eyes as he made his way back up the stairs as slowly as he dared. He wished he’d just sat on the stool to begin with, or better yet, just gotten into the crib.
Greg moved to the closet and pulled out the shopping bag with Sherlocks' change of big clothes in it.
"Uh-huh, chocolate...and it's warm, so it's all soft and gooey." Greg held the pills out in his hand. "Just really quick, sweetheart."
“Yes, you do,” he repeated, his voice soft, coaxing. “You do because you’re a good boy, aren’t you…yes, you are.”
Mycroft held his breath and waited, but Sherlock only turned onto his side and curled into a fetal position.
Jawn huffed a sigh before plopping his stuffed puppy onto Mycroft’s chest. “Where’d all'a ones you had?”
John tugs Sherlock behind him, flipping off the television and the lamps in the living room. He can feel the little detective trying to work out what’s happening and has to keep himself from laughing out loud. He’s always been impressed by the detectives keen mind, but he isn’t to proud to admit that he enjoys keeping him stumped when he’s little.
Greg made an uncomfortable sound in the back of his throat that sounded suspiciously like a whinge. "I just, I dunno," he mumbled sheepishly, "...thought that maybe you'd want to finish that story from before."
“He’s different, not better.” Mycroft refused to let Sherlock pull away from his hold. “I…haven’t been the best example of a brother.” Hard as it was for him to ever admit fault, it was true. “And John has never had one. I was attempting…” The implicit “to make up for it” was left unsaid, but it was there. He sighed. “I’m sorry I didn’t recognize how it was making you feel. I do now. Let’s go fetch Jawn and apologize to him, too.” Mycroft climbed to his feet with a series of grunts that were at best ‘undignified’, and held down his hand for his little brother.
“Are your head spaces always this inconsistent?” Mycroft asked, helping him off the floor...not even ten minutes had passed since this one had been shouting at him, and now...
"Four, four gen'le ones," Sherlock said to himself as he held the yellow bottle above the water. He gave it a gentle squeeze...barely enough for a drop to well up in the little nozzle, let alone fall into the water.
"Baby powder works for sand." Greg said, coming in through the kitchen door with two laden shopping bags. "I bet it works on grass."
Sherlock flopped down on the bed, fuming. His bees weren't stupid. Jawn was stupid. He and his dumb frogs could just stay down there forever.
“Good job, baby.” John knew how much Sherlock liked his words of praise, and he tried to offer them as much as possible.
Sherlock was sound asleep, his dummy making little bobbing motions in his mouth, but Jawn was wide awake as ever and focused on the picture of Mother rabbit dressing her little one’s up for the day.
John jumps at the sound of his little boy's voice, not realizing that he’s been standing there for a few minutes. He drops his paper and fixes him with a rock hard glare.
Sherlock tensed up and was about to protest again, but Mycroft put a finger against his dummy and held it there. “Hush.” He waited until Jawn stood (albeit it slowly) and looked up at him with a determination in his eyes.
Sherlock stopped his struggling and went limp, laying belly-down on the floor. Mycroft, having gotten wise to such tricks in the span of the afternoon, kept his hold on his ankle.
Sherlock clutched the back of his brother’s waistcoat in a tight fist and watched the goings’on while quietly sucking his thumb, not wanting to draw attention on himself.
“Good boy.” Mycroft kissed one of the only dry spots on the little boys’ face, on his forehead, and wrapped him in a huge hug.
“Ohhh,” Sherlock whinged, putting his chin on the edge of the tub while he gave his duck the stink eye.
Greg sighed...those spots were going to be smarting something terrible later. "Yeah, we're done...let's rinse the bubbles off and you can get out, okay?"
"My only issue is that all the crumbs seem to be on my side of the bed." Mycroft swept the biscuit crumbs off his pillow.
"You have a loose definition of 'behaving'." Mycroft turned to Greg and mouthed the words, 'Take that from him'.
"Here..." Greg gently laid Sherlock's hand on his chest, then slipped his arm under the baby's knees in a half-bridal carry and lifted his bottom.
Mycroft took them into the nursery and sat in the rocking chair, arranging Sherlock so he was cradled on his lap. A pang of regret made him kiss the baby's forehead as he latched onto the bottle and took a tentative suckle. This isn't how he'd wanted them to end up in the rocking chair, but...well.
“Again.” Sherlock whispers, the specks of silver in his blue eyes glimmering with seduction, begging John to go again. This time harder, faster, and as many times as John wants.
His hand shot up to clutch his side as he felt all of his breath, his mind, and his spirit leave his body in one great big, crushing wave of pain, and he stumbled backwards until he felt his arse bump against the edge of the counter-top.
“Very clever, little boy.” Mycroft traded it for an adult-sized one, as well as an adult-sized fork, and set his place again before taking the figure Jawn was gnawing on from him. Ignoring the indignant squawk, he lifted the little doctor from the floor and nudged him over to the sink, too. “Let Sherlock help you wash up,” he said, giving his still-warm bum a friendly pat as a ‘reminder’, before going to fill their plates.
Molly slunk back in front of them, the dress swishing around her legs as she held the front up. She hunkered down in front of Mycroft, who held her hair up out of the way and smoothly zipped the dress up. "There, pretty as a picture."
"Let's go eat our pizza before it gets cold, little man," he said, not willing to argue about medicine anymore at that moment, and guided Jawn into the dining room.
"Sure, sure," Greg said, grunting as he repeated the same process and shoved the other boot onto Sherlock's foot.
"So, you fill up on junk." Mycroft held his arm around Sherlock's waist, patting his hip as he held his half of the sandwich to his lips.
"You don' nee' my hel'b!" Sherlock tried again to wiggle out of Greg's arms, and started to cry when it became obvious that he wouldn't be getting free. "S'obb'i'd, G'eg!"
Mycroft had the bowl of batter in one hand and a scoop in the other. "Oh, and here I thought I was baking for people who appreciate me."
Sherlock toddled over, his cup held tightly in both hands...as soon as he was close enough, Greg pulled him into his lap. "I'm not mad at you," he said again, and kissed his cheek.
Sherlock stayed on his hands and knees, looking over all the pretty white blooms in front of him. Mycroft said to pick the prettiest ones...but how could he do that, when they were
"Yea. G'eg halp." There was suddenly a lot of activity on the other end of the phone, Greg shouting at someone Sherlock couldn't see.
Mycroft sighed, and rubbed his temple. This one was going to be a doozey. “Jawn, one more time, and I will spank your bum.” Hell, Sherlock had already earned two on his own, why not go for a three-fur?! Still…Mycroft held out his hand; “Come on, Jawn…help us look.”
“Look’id, Sher’yock!” Jawn babbled excitedly as he showed off his new plastic-moulded friend. “He’s a shar’b tooth!”
Greg opened his eyes a crack. He was still in the nursery. Jawn was sacked out in his lap, and both of his legs where asleep.
Greg forced himself to smile at the baby, then turned towards the open window again; “HEY MYC. WE’RE GUNNA NEED YOU OUT HERE," he hollered.
"Sherlock is a very smart boy. He is very capable of picking four lovely flowers." Mycroft knew without looking that the praise caused Sherlock to blush and dip his head.
Mycroft really, really needed that paracetamol now. “Alright. Up now," he said, gently trying to scoot the little Doctor of his lap.
"Come on, love. You're going to have to go in your jams." Greg slowly eased Jawn off his lap, rubbing his back when Jawn tried to cling to him. Greg was strong but he couldn't get off the floor and lift Jawn at the same time. "It's alright, sweetheart. You're going to be okay." Greg stood quickly and tugged Jawn off the floor with his good arm.
“Gunna ba'ff wif’ lettuce?” Jawn had been about to get back into the tub when Mycroft pointedly cleared his throat.
As the pair reached the stairs, Mycroft pushed Greg ahead and urged him along, keeping a hand at the small of his back. "Wait...you didn't know Baxter quacked, or why they were swimming? At what point did you sneak upstairs and start eavesdropping?"
"You can age up and stay by yourself if you prefer." John said absently, taking care to button his cardigan.
Sherlock slid off the step and onto his hands and knees, then started to crawl after Greg...but after just two strides forward, he paused mid stride; "Owwwwwwwww'sh," he whimpered, and looked up at Mycroft with a wobbly lip.
Mycroft pulled a pair of grey pajama pants from the cupboard and moved to his little brother, who was making an admirable effort to keep his eyes open. “Lie back," he said, nudging Sherlock until he was laying down and then tugged the pajamas up his slim legs and over his padded bum.
"No, sweetheart...Jawn needs to sleep. Did you turn on the baby monitor?" Greg asked Mycroft, who had started to undress.
Still blushing, Molly looked down at her soup, so at least she couldn't see all the eyes that were on her. "There's a party in my tummy..."
“Yes, those are wonderful,” Mycroft said, rubbing Jawn’s back in small circles. “Close your eyes while you tell me.”
"No," said the other man as he unbuttoned his shirt. "But if you wake the other one up, so help me-"
“Jawn is eager to join the ‘Sore Bottom’ Club,” Mycroft muttered, ignoring the hands pounding at his back. He waltzed into the kitchen and used his foot to hook one of the chair legs and turned it around, facing away from the table, and sat down heavily. With as much grace as a Russian-trained dancer, Mycroft slid Jawn off of his shoulder and laid him flat across his lap, where he noted that this was going to be much easier than disciplining his long-limbed little brother. “And Sherlock needs to go watch the rest of his dinosaur movie, please.”
Sherlock sighed again, with all the disdain a soggy pants tot could muster, the scooted carefully across the bed and into Greg's arms.
Then there is the steadying weight of a forearm across his lower back, a strong hand clutching his hip through his suit coat and he relaxes back into position. The whipping continues long past the point of pleasure. His cock, which had been hard since John gripped his arm in the tube station, flags in disinterest. He’s lost count by the time John tells him to be quiet. He’s no longer able to keep from making noise; so he fills his mouth with the leather of the back of the sofa. It tastes of dust, but it allows him to obey.
The doorbell rang just as Mycroft was coming downstairs, dressed in a pair of trousers and an emerald green jumper.
"Yeah, 'ohhhhhhh'." Greg stuck the bowl in the microwave and set the timer. "Alright," he said, turning around; "let's get a bib on you big bo-"
Sherlock froze in place, hand inches from Jawn’s nose as he processed his damp nose. Sensing the impending doom, and unwilling to leave them on their own again after the last time, Mycroft came into the sitting room and pulled them to their feet. "I’ll never be able to find it on my own. I need the world’s greatest detective’s to find it for me.” Mycroft tried to usher them toward the bathroom, but it was like wrangling cats.
“Big Mean Jawn Green does sound pretty good though. Can I change my pirate name?” Jawn asked, nearly jogging to keep up.
Sherlock's chin wobbled as he pulled his hand back and he turned towards Greg, hiding his face against his chest.
While the two boys where scuffling with each other–Sherlock trying to push Jawn’s hand out of his face and Jawn trying to pull his head back down–Mycroft used the distraction to fetch a tube of rash creme from the nappy bin, squeeze a good amount onto his fingers, and apply it to Jawn’s nappy area.
Sherlock quickly stepped back and hugged his bunny close. "...I scare G'eg?" he asked quietly, looking like he very much knew that he had.
Greg got the glove off and started to take off Sherlock's rings, lining them up so they could go back on in the 'right' order.
“Mr. McGregor. You’ve never read Peter Rabbit?” Mycroft frowned as he put on a pot of water to boil.
Greg stuck out his tongue and blew a raspberry at his boyfriends' back, making Sherlock giggle and repeat the noise.
“You can’t stay in a wet, smelly nappy all day, Jawn,” Mycroft said gently, coaxing him.  “You don’t want a nappy rash, do you? No, I would think not…that would be a terrible, awful experience. Look, Sherlock’s going to stay right here, yes?”
Jawn sat very still, tears building in his throat that he refused to let out. He was not a crybaby!  “Y..yo..you’re a jerk,” he stuttered, wrenching himself off of Mycroft’s lap. He turned in place once, unsure where to hide to lick his wounds, before stomping down the hallway and slamming the nursery door. Repeatedly.
Jawn was still crying and clutching his elbow, but it was becoming obvious that the whole experience was starting to take a toll on him. Greg suspected that if that elbow was broken, like he thought it was, Jawn might be starting to go into shock.
Greg smiled and took Sherlock's hand, then gave it a squeeze. "Yeah; Jawn's a good hider but your brother's a good finder."
been awhile since he could last remember letting Sherlock pick a prize…but that wasn’t really his fault. “Well, you just gotta try harder, like me.”
"Hea'ben," Sherlock agreed, shoving his chicken into his mouth and then sucking his fingertips clean.
"Tha'ds no'd faaaaiiiiiir, G'eg!" The baby whinged, putting his hand on Greg's shoulder and shaking him. "How I s'po'ssa knooooooow?"
Much to Mycroft's surprise, Sherlock was still on the bench where he'd been left, talking softly to the flowers; "... an' Hu'k F'yower gunna y'ive at my house. So Jawn can ha'b g'een f'yower. And a res' can y'ive wif' G'eg and My'coff."
Sherlock frowned and put his hand on Greg's shoulders for to balance himself; "Bu'd I don' wan' c'yothes."
Greg was reaching for a bib when the realization stopped him, and he sighed. "Nope, didn't think," he said, pulling the bib down over Jawn's head quickly before the little bugger could dodge it.
"He's quacking," he explained, belly-laughing at the affronted look on Mycroft's face. " 'Cause I called him an 'odd duck'."
"Boy, are you daft?" John snaps violently. Sherlock's moves his hand quickly, his fingers shaking as they retract.
! Gi'b it back!!!" Sherlock reached over his brother and struggled to get the back, yelping when Mycroft smacked the back of one hand.
"See...he's looking for you," Mycroft said, placing an encouraging hand at Sherlock's lower back. "Let's go get you changed; you'll feel a lot better."
Mycroft simply worked with the facts: He was changing his little brother. He was wiping his little brother clean. He’d done this before, numerous times. So what if things were a little…bigger, and there was more hair now? He tapped on Sherlock’s hip; “Bum up."
"Looks like you get your wish, brother-mine." Sherlock cut them off as he rounded the counter in a rush, collecting his things as he went. "No more cupcakes for me at the moment."
The ride is mercifully short. John is out of the cab and in the door before Sherlock even has time to pay. He shoves all the money he has in his billfold at the driver, murmuring a rough voiced thank you as he bounds after John out of the cab and up to the flat.
"He's not that bad," Greg replied. In the same moment Jawn tried to stand up, and Greg quickly put his hands on his shoulders. "No, no, no, no...Jawn sits."
"Sher-"Greg could hear a shuffling noise, but couldn't see the baby. "Now where did your little behind disappear too?" Greg grumbled to himself, poking his head back out the kitchen door.
Another cursory search of the room also left Mycroft with a pair of clean pajama bottoms, and a t-shirt. "Oh, thank God," he muttered, burying his nose in the fabric and taking a deep breath. "No baby powder."
"Tired baby," Greg tutted, while trying not to groan as he stood up (although it probably would have drowned out the creaking sounds from both knees) and took Sherlock's hands "And so thoughtful."
“We’ve clearly missed something simple. Did he climb a tree?” Mycroft said putting his hand up to shield his eyes from the sun while he glanced up at the branches of the huge oak in their backyard.
Jawn was on his back, sore arm slung across his chest, snoring lightly. Sherlock made to bolt into the room, but Greg pulled him up short. "Remember. One kiss through the bars. If you wake Jawn, you won't get your special treat," Greg whispered.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose and shifted again, this time cracking an eye open to glare up at Mycroft.
Yet, Mycroft knew that it wasn't 'nuthin'. "We can hardly be festive with a badly damaged toddler sleeping between us," he said, and sat down with a sigh.
John comes forward and unzips the onesie to mid-thigh.  “I think if Daddy has to help you with your pajamas you’re probably too little to stand up to have a wee Pet.”  John says, guiding Sherlock’s arms out of his sleeves. Sherlock huffs at him and makes to retort but John’s cocked eyebrow stops him. John helps him tug his trainers down and then leans against the sink, trying not to smirk at the bright blush across those impossibly high cheekbones as Sherlock places his bum down on the toilet. When Sherlock is finished John helps him up and back into his clothes.
"Noooooooo, Greg is not wearing a dress...Greg'll be the judge for your fashion show, yeah?" Greg said, bouncing the baby in his lap.
"Nothing too spicy for him," Mycroft said as he stood up and brushed away the glitter that his little brother had transferred onto him.
Sherlock pretends to pout but is clearly pleased by the turn of events, squeezing John’s hand in pleasure. John opens the door at the top of the stairs and is almost toppled over as Sherlock rushes into the room, flopping onto the bed.
"Good, we'll go get those first." Greg kissed Sherlock's forehead. "Or do you want to wait here while I go get them?"
Sherlock stood on the landing, watching mournfully as John disappeared down the stairs. The tears that he'd barely been containing began to roll unbidden down his cheeks as he heard the front door click shut. He could feel himself moving forward, ready to bolt after Daddy when a gentle singsong voice called to him from the sitting room.
Jawn eyed the umbrella and sucked on the dummy as he weighed his options, then finally spat it into his hand and held it out. “‘Kay, trade.”
"You're welcome. That was a good idea," Mycroft said, nodding at the sandwich, and handed Greg a napkin.
Mycroft swatted behind him without looking and smirked when he connected with something puffy, then heard a yelp. “Let’s go find your Sherlock before he gets into anything, and you both probably need a chan–”
"Pick some for Jawn too, please?" Greg grunted as he held Jawn's waist and taped one side of his nappy.
Sherlock went over to the drawer that held all the bibs and rifled through it. "Y'is one," he said, holding up a purple one with an owl on it.
"Smar'd," Sherlock nodded, putting three spools of ribbon into a play purse. "Ro'gs are ou'dside. Bee'ds? I y'ike y'ittle ones and big ones."
“Sherlock did it,” Jawn said absently before crowing in victory as he pulled a large plastic tub of crayons from underneath a stack of half finished ‘arts’.
Jawn crossed his arms and gave Mycroft an upside down glare that could rival the detective’s when he was in full sulk-mode. “Wipe that look off your face…wait, I can do that for you,” he said, and proceeded wipe one of his wet hands over Jawn’s face, then smirked as he sputtered.
Molly frowned and rested her chin in her hand with a small huff; "...Wouldn't be a mess," she mumbled as she picked at the sequins along her dress.
"Can Uncle Greg put you down to change your bum, hm?" Greg covered his cheek and the side of his head in soft kisses as he carried him back to the bedroom.
Molly's excitement deflated. "Oh. Yeah...I, I do," she said...she hadn't meant to get that excited, but, well...dress-up
"When was it that you gave him his medicine last?" Mycroft asked Greg, watching Sherlock and Molly both as he ate.
"He gets extra, because that's more than likely what he's going to eat the most of. And that's fine."
Jawn set it reverently on the kitchen table before digging through the wares with both hands to find the 'treasure’ he was looking for.
"Yea, I know. It's alright though, i'nnit..." Greg tipped his chin as Sherlock, who was feeding a bite of roll to one of his fish.
Greg made a face as he powdered Sherlocks' grass-free bits, then pulled his nappy up and taped it into place. "You don't want a bit of hot sauce or honey mustard?"
"Let's clean up you're noodles first," Greg wiped as much of the mess off the table and into Sherlock's bowl as he could.
," Mycroft sighed, and reached over to flip a switch on the wall next to him, turning off the lamp on Greg's side.
Sherlock glanced at him out of the corner of his eye, then went back to reading the cascade of text messages. "Do you?"
Greg plonked a couple of pieces of bread in the toaster. "You want to put ribbons on the houses, too?"
Sherlock hustled back to the bench a few minutes later, five clovers held as delicately as he could. "G'eg! F'yowers!!!"
"I think three yellow drops is okay. It will be pastel yellow." Mycroft put the cup down and took the bottle from Sherlock, then recapped it.
“Oh-KAY,” Sherlock snapped. There was a lot of attitude from the little detective today, which was only
Mycroft frowned as he finished washing Sherlock’s hands. The sniffles that had abated began in full force. “Shhh, don’t start,” he said, reaching into his pocket for Sherlock’s dummy and popping it in the sniffly detective’s mouth with a practiced hand. “You let me take care of Jawn.”
Despite a strong desire to clean them up himself, Mycroft handed each boy a wet nap; "Wash your hands, and Jawn, you’ve a chocolate mustache to remove.”
Sherlock had sprawled sideways and was stretched the length of the sofa. Jawn was laying on top of him, drooling on his neck.
“NO, that one’s g’een!!! You can’t have it!” Jawn was standing at one end of the table and leaning over it, his open hand thrust out at Sherlock. “Give back!”
“You are never getting a treasure again!” Jawn snapped, pointing a menacing finger at the little detective.
Sherlock dipped his head, looking appropriately reprimanded. "My'coff say g'enle," he said quietly, putting a green-speckled finger to his lips.
"Molly?" Greg glanced over at Sherlock's bruised face. "Right. Good. Trousers. Can I have a sip of that?" He held his hand out for Mycroft's mug and proceeded to down the entire thing.
"Okay, okay...we're done, all done." Greg wiped his fingers off on his trousers. Oh, Mycroft was going to get an ear-full later tonight.
“Perhaps I should teach you how to savor your treats.” John was laughing as he put the cupcakes in the icebox. “Alright messy boy, into the tub with you.”
"You were supposed to wait for Gregory ON the bed." Mycroft had his arms crossed over his chest, while staring down his nose at the baby.
"Shhhh, yes, you did a wonderful job...go brush your teeth now," Mycroft batted his padded bottom out of the room and towards the bathroom.
"I don't think there's any chance of that happening." Mycroft entered the room, his sleeves still rolled up and carrying a glass in each hand, one of which he handed to Greg. "Did we decide on a movie?"
Sherlock stayed at the table and craned his neck to watch what Greg was doing, and gave an excited clap when he saw the plate of little cakes coming back out. "Cu'bca'ges!"
"I know, baby, but he likes playing in the water barrel." Greg walked back to the corner of the greenhouse, though it was already very apparent that Jawn wasn't in there.
does, and then he'd either get a time-out out here, or maybe even a spanking, if G'eg was fed-up enough.
Sherlock relaxed under the familiar ministrations, going boneless against the mattress. He was still for a few moments, soaking up the affection before huffing at himself in frustration.
Molly came back and crouched down in front of Mycroft again, so he could zip up her new dress. "That's beauty PAGEN'S!"
"Sh-sh-sh, it's okay...okay, just sit back and let Uncle Greg open it, sweetheart." Poor lad's pain meds must have worn off; that was the only reason Greg could figure that would have woken him up out of that haze.
"Do you have any fun activities planned for this week?" Molly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and watched Sherlock closely.
“I can’t stay with Sherlock?” Jawn asked, staring down at where his and Sherlock’s hands were joined.
"We can't have birthday cake without candles," Mycroft griped as he sifted through rolls of tape, bits of wire, and pen caps with no pens once more.
Luckily, he didn't have to go far before catching up...they'd only made it halfway up the stairs, with Sherlock taking each step one at a time and his brother right behind him, holding a hand on his backside in case he toppled.
"Come snuggle with me, my love," Mycroft smiled at him carefully. If Greg caught a hint of condescension, they'd have a row. "You're not the only one who needs caring for."
“Nigh’time is for sh’eeseca’ge!" Jawn crowed, putting a lopsided bite of cheesecake up to Mycroft’s lips. “Hurry! The sau’sh!”
"Yeah, you are," Greg shook out the other boot and wiped down Sherlock's legs and feet as best he could. "Our cleaning lady is gunna have a fit. Come on."
"John, that is unreasonable, nobody can make someone sleep." As John had predicted, Sherlock had an objection and was attempting to show his displeasure by thrashing around on John's lap in a desperate attempt to get up. John held him tightly, until he finally settled, his chest rising rapidly in quick, defiant breaths.
Greg laid him down and Sherlock immediately rolled onto his belly, rubbing the uninjured half of his face on his pillow.
"Old soppy," Mycroft called after Greg as he disappeared out the door. "You've got Uncle Greg wrapped around your adorable little finger."
Mycroft smiled to himself. “It always did. I mostly hum, myself…Sherlock’s awfully lucky he has someone who can carry a tune now.”
Mycroft turned eyes onto his baby brother who was standing in front of the sink, eyes closed, dummy barely moving. He gently nudged him forward and used his own hands to lather the soap for Sherlock. “It works better if you don’t allow it to air dry.”
Greg held Sherlock's hand as they slowly made their way downstairs. He tried counting the steps in a silly voice to help distract the baby, but he was too distraught.
Greg led the bouncing babies down the hall to the first floor guestroom that sometimes substituted as a play room. While Molly looked around, mouth agape at the sheer size of the room (it was as big as half of her entire flat), Sherlock scooted around her and hopped up onto the bed. "Maw'yee! Two y'iddle mon'gees jumpin' on'na bed!"
"I'm-" A warm hand on the nape of his neck made him falter, his headspace a jumbled mess. "Med'cine."
"Well, yeah...that's a good rule, I suppose." Leave it to Mycroft to take the only fun out of having a cast.
"Anything for you, gorgeous!" Greg kissed Mycroft's cheek and shimmied out of his dress, leaving it in a puddle on the floor.
“Nothing, never mind…go get your trousers, and I’ll help you into them.” Mycroft sat on the side of the bed as he watched Jawn pick up the horribly wrinkled garment, and wondered to himself if it was really a good idea to take them out while they were this…tiny. They could cause an even bigger scene, in an even more crowded place than some hole-in-the-wall chip shop…but on the other hand, it might take less effort to make them obedient.
washed that table not but a few hours ago. "Which one do you want on your ca'ge--" Mycroft stopped and gave a slight shake of his head; he supposed that that's what an entire day of baby-babble did to your head. "Your CAKE," he said, carefully enunciating the word.
Sherlock giggled and reached for him the second he was back, clinging to his older brother like a little monkey with his mounds of pink skirt bunch around his hips. "G'eg turn, fina'yee!"
“Yes, I see that. It’s still getting turned off.” Mycroft searched the sofa cushions for the remote Jawn had dropped.
Mycroft grabbed the nearly full bottle next, then wordlessly walked out of the kitchen, leaving Greg alone with piles of play-doh and a greasy table from the crisps.
Jawn had his bum back in his seat before Mycroft could finish his sentence, and the man couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “You’re both awful little brats!”
Done, he takes a step back; "Alright, let’s get it over with then. Tell Da' why he's such a dickhead for not allowing you to wake Mrs. Hudson at nearly four in the morning to retrieve your hedgehog." He says, crossing his arms over his chest.
“And that’s a chocolate cake for a mountain. We’re not going for realism, lad…we can have a green sky, along with fish, and an army of cherry snowmen.”
“So good. So tight… so…” Sherlock screams as John begins to rapidly massage his prostrate with no mercy. He cums, loud and with energy, but John knows that it’s dry and it must hurt.  This time when Sherlock falls onto the bed, John lets him lay. He pulls his fingers out, causing Sherlock to moan. Wanton little shit; he's spent and still wants Daddy’s fingers in his arse.
Mycroft continued to glare at him and reached down to collect the small toy Sherlock had won, then put it in his coat pocket. “We’ll finish this little discussion at home,” he said, putting his hand on the small of the younger man’s back, and then turned to Jawn. “Let’s go, Jawn…bring the food with you, please.”
Mycroft began to place foil cupcake liners into the muffin tins. "Hurry, children...let's get these in the oven before our dinner arrives."
Sherlock’s face crumbled while watching him…he never managed to be brave when facing a smacked bottom. A sob bubbled out of his throat and he wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand. “B-but I, I d-don’t want one!” he cried.
"Sorry Pet. Daddy is exhausted. Neither of us has been sleeping well, and I know you don't feel tired but you need the rest." John runs his fingers over Sherlock's cheek before cupping his face. Sherlock turns into the touch, nestling against John's palm.
"Brilliant, thank you." Greg smooched Sherlock's cheek. "Do you wanna know the most smart thing Mycroft's ever done?"
Jawn was on his knees in one of the chairs, his entire face buried in the open bag. "Where ca'ge???"
"I'm aware." Mycroft used his teeth to nick the plastic on the package, then pulled it open. "How do you keep track of them at home?"
"And the rats," Greg said, sounding less enthused as he popped open the snaps on Sherlock's onesie and hiked it up around his waist. "I didn't even know rat adoptions were a thing."
“No more lettuces!” Jawn cheered as Sherlock scooped the last bit out of the water. “Bubbas, p'ease, My'coff!" he added, before he dropped his net beside the tub and half belly flopped into the tub, water sloshing dangerously close to the edge.
He spooned one more bite into Sherlock’s mouth, then cleared his throat. “You’ve both had two bites, now eat your own.”
But Greg had no time to sit and sink back into his maudlin funk; Sherlock was there, tugging his hand towards the back door. "C'mon, G'eg!"
Sherlock sat in Greg's arms and squealed around the fingers he'd placed in his mouth, rings and all, while Molly sat on the floor next to them, belly-laughing and holding her stomach.
“Another prize, too?” Jawn scrubbed at him bum, trying to rub out the sting. Sherlock looked up hopefully, showing off the freshly rinsed bath toys.
These were intense negotiations. Jawn put his hand over the dummy in his mouth, thinking. “Wan’ bo’ff.”
“Let’s go back into the sitting room. We can watch another film while you play with your treasures.”
"Here. I got these for you a few weeks ago and kept forgetting to give them to you." After a quick search of the top drawer, Mycroft handed Sherlock a pair of purple stripped socks covered in sloths.
"You will still get plenty of cupcakes before bed, I promise." No sooner than Mycroft had spoken, the timer on the oven beeped. "Speaking of," he said, getting up. "I'm going to go set those out to cool."
"Aw, c'mon," Greg chided, and crossed over to Mycrofts' side of the counter. "Be my little beach bunny," he said, cozying up to his lover's side and putting his arm around his shoulders.
"Jawn...Jawn, p'ease, G'eg say can you bent you arm?" Sherlock hollered over Jawn's wailing. Sherlock nudged closer but Jawn hid his sore elbow between the vee of his legs.
Mycroft scrolled until he found it. "Oh, is this about a mermaid, too?" he asked, peering at the thumbnail.
"But you have to promise, with all your heart, that you'll take the second one when we tell you to," Greg added.
"Nooo, not with your slobber all over it. I'll be happy to take the bowl and give it a good scraping."
are p'etty, My'coff!" Sherlock could not seem to stress this enough, and yet his My'coff still didn't seem to get it!
Sherlock nodded but he was far from convinced. Without his thumb or a dummy, he had few options to self sooth. Mycroft pulled him into a one armed hug and rubbed his arm. "After Jawn is all patched up, perhaps you both can come spend the night."
"Y'ooks a'lishis!" Jawn babbled, and began doing exactly that...picking the pieces of pepperoni off. Greg sighed...maybe that was better for now, until the pizza cooled.
"Probably, squealer," Greg dropped a kiss on Sherlocks' forehead. "Luckily he already knows my opinion on that."
Mycroft gave him a squeeze and they sat quietly until Greg pushed a wheelchair bound Jawn into the waiting room. The little doctor's arm was in a sling across his chest and his pupils were blown wide from his meds.
"Hey, Sherlock, look!" Greg tore open the package of biscuits and put one in Sherlock's hand. "Look, there's a biscuit!"
Jawn swallowed, looking nervous, and tried to sink down into the bathwater. When that tactic obviously failed, he tried another; he gave a forced, half-hearted yawn, and rubbed his eyes. “I really, really tired,” he said, and peeked between his fingers to see if it was working.
"Well, let's go check anyway, because I can already tell you he's not in the greenhouse or the shed, or fuck'all out here," Greg snapped.
"Pet, I don't remember buying glitter for our art box." John said, head in the broom closet, digging for the broom.
Greg waited until he was out of earshot. "He's going to need medicine soon," he spoke lowly as he put the jar of peanut butter on the counter next to Mycroft. "He was hurting upstairs."
“There’s a difference between ‘want’ and ‘need’, Sherlock, and it’s certainly a ‘need’ in this case,” the older brother sniffed. He’d already been elbows deep in tears, snot, drool, powder, and nappies…he was NOT going to clean their place for them.
Jawn looked towards the garden, and after a moment's consideration crawled towards it, letting his sunglasses drop to ground while paying no mind.
"We didn't mean to scare you," Mycroft apologized, his voice soft; "but little boys don't touch the oven."
Jawn clapped his hands before falling to his knees in front of the bathroom cupboard, rooting through a large bucket of toys. “I foun’ em!” he crowed, holding up two small nets.
“Can I try some? You can try mines.” Jawn hastily plucked a gummy worm off of a spoonful of green ice cream before offering it to Mycroft.
…Jawn didn’t quite know how to respond. He knew how it was different, of course, and how each hero had their own qualities to bring to the team, but he couldn’t quite think of how to put it into words.
Mycroft pulled the nappy bin from beneath the bed and took out what he needed to change two nappies. He ignored the huff the little doctor put on while rummaging through the drawer for something to wear.
Another full cup of tea and twenty minutes later, Mycroft was looking through his phone when he heard the tell-tale creak of footsteps in the hallway. “You," he said, "are supposed to be in bed, little boy.”
"All you need now is some feathers." Greg squeezed some of the pinkish lotion out onto his fingers. "I'm gonna put some of this on your shoulders, baby boy...think you can sit still?"
"Y'ah!" Molly said before Sherlock could answer. "I c'n dress him u'b!" She finally came up for air, her hair in her face, and pulled out a long, bright pink taffeta dress that would have made 1980's Barbie think about toning it down. "He c'n wear this one!"
Sherlock tucked his thumb in his mouth and looked longingly down the stairs...then sighed as well, and reached for Greg's hand.
"Yes, that's what I was expecting next," Mycroft said, now resigned to at least another hour and a half of whingy, sleep-deprived toddlers demanding his attention. He looked up to see his little brother standing in the doorway, squinting at the lights and dragging the blanket from the couch along behind him. "I suppose you're 'starving', as well?"
“There’s no need to shout.” Now that his little brother was sufficiently distracted, Mycroft walked over to the bookshelf at the opposite side of the room, and began to look for a book. A particular book.
“That’s right, Peter was the fourth little rabbit. And they all lived with their mother in a sand bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree.” Mycroft paused, and looked down at the boys…
"No. Greg and Sherlock are going to stay home with me." Mycroft gave Molly the last bite of her sandwich and then got up to wet a flannel.
"Oh lord," Mycroft sighed as his big, black car pulled up. He opened the back door and ushered Sherlock inside. "What did he say?"
"Apology accepted, even if it was a little warranted," Mycroft admitted. "It was not my intention to seem like I was keeping things from you."
Greg saw his chance and picked up one of the snap peas in Sherlock's food, held it to his lips, and silently cheered when he opened his mouth and ate it without fuss. He alsomanaged to feed him a bit of carrot and broccoli floret before Mycroft came back to the table, seemingly breaking the spell.
Mycroft read the story slowly, hoping that his tone would lull the little doctor to sleep. But Jawn stayed wide-eyed and alert through the whole thing, gripping Mycroft’s waistcoat in fear when Peter was almost captured and quietly (after being reminded that Sherlock was sleeping) cheering when Peter escaped back through the fence and made it home.
"He's nearly done with his bottle; we just need to be nice...and quiet...and not rile him up anymore before then," Mycroft said, thunking his hand against Sherlock's back.
Jawn folded his arms and stood there, glaring at the empty doorway until Mycroft was sure that he saw steam rising from the little doctor’s wet hair. “Wasn’ funny,” he grumbled.
Jawn wiggled in his seat, ecstatic. “I do’id!” He picked up a cup in each and poured them both onto the center of the slice of cheesecake. “Bes’ Sh’eeseca’ge e'ber.”
Greg got the baby back into his own seat and went to wet a flannel; "Are Baxter and Peanut full too?"
“That’s a perfect rule.” John dropped a kiss on his forehead. He read the rule aloud as he wrote it out. “Sherlock will not unnecessarily risk his health or safety. Daddy will be the one to deem whether or not a risk is necessary.”
“Bed is back that direction, Sherlock.” John said, pointing a thumb at the nursery, “And I suggest you go.”
"That's not why he fell, Sherlock." Mycroft gave his hand a squeeze, then reached for the small box of tissues that every table had and plucked one out. "Jawn is going to be fine, and that's because of you," Mycroft said as he dabbed his little brother's cheeks.
Jawn scowled at him, then slammed the remote down into Mycroft’s waiting hand before crossing his arms and flopping back against the couch with a disgusted groan.
"Next time, dearest...I promise. What was the other movie called?" He put the baby's bottle in his hands and picked up the remote.
“But…” Mycroft continued, and Jawn’s brow furrowed even deeper. “Only little boys with dry bums can play the game I have in mind. Wet little babies…like you…would have to sit and watch.”
“Little hobbit, come out come out,” Sherlock sing-songed as he scanned the lawn again. He walked over to the lawn chair where Greg had been sitting earlier, the last known place Jawn had been, and carefully scanned the ground around him.
Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose. “I promise, I won’t yell at you.” What could he have possibly said??
"I need my medication. And to get out of this wet nappy." Sherlock steadfastly avoided looking at Gregs' face as they slowly started out of the kitchen.
"You know what you have to do if you want to discuss this like adults." John's face softens as he says this, watching his boy fidget in front of him.
“I told you that it was a toy for outdoors. Are we outdoors, Jawn?” Mycroft asked, his eyebrow cocked.
"Tha'ds Peanu'ds sea'd." Sherlock shuffled back and sat at the table next to Molly. "Maw'yee wan juice?" he asked, and slid over his cup.
“Boyfren s’duffs.” Jawn shrugged. Sherlock may have already known, but Greg had let slip the secret several weeks ago after having one too many pints during the football match, so it was news to him.
"I c'n picks them?" Sherlock asked, clearly skeptical. He'd been in trouble for picking the flowers in the garden before.
Greg started the movie and leaned back against his pillows, bringing the baby with him and tucking him under his arm. "Hang?"
Sherlock blushed heavily and looked down at the floor instead, blinking furiously to keep the tears that were forming at bay.
Mycroft’s hard expression fell. Popular opinion to contrary, he really wasn’t a brute. “It’s alright. But I need you to listen to me.”
"My'coff!" Sherlock whinged, putting his hand back on Mycroft's hip and shaking him. "Make him gi'b i'd back!"
"Okay, but Greg's going to pour them in the cap for you, alright? Because if we end up with a bubble-mess the way we had a glitter-mess, your brother's going to spank both of us."
Greg shut the DVD player off and queued up Netflix instead, then decided to let it sit there until His Royal Highness returned. He leaned back and looked down at Sherlock, who was completely sacked out. Probably the first restful sleep the poor thing had had in days.
"It's easier to say 'powdered sugar', isn't it." Mycroft picked up the bag of sugar that Sherlock had fetched earlier and tore the corner open.
"We could move the crib into our room, if needed," Mycroft drawled, judging Greg's reaction. "But we would have the bed to ourselves again."
Jawn crowed as he caught the handle of the bucket and swung it off the top of the refrigerator. He turned and hopped off the chair, ignoring Mycroft’s proffered hand and cocked eyebrow.
"Don't repeat that," Greg scolded as he set Jawn on the floor and made him sit. "You stay here...you gonna be okay with them both?" he asked, turning to Mycroft.
Mycroft put it back in his mouth. "I'm sorry, darling, I've already shut it off...it's very late, and Moana was tired."
"He had a bad dream. Don't worry about it. Can I see this for just a moment, please?" Greg tried to take the phone and slip it from the baby's hands, only to make him clutch it tighter.
“Mmmm, I remember.” Mycroft put the book on the nightstand and gently encouraged Jawn onto his tummy as he rambled on about vegetables.
Mycroft startled a bit, having been taken by surprise, and then his entire demeanor changed. "I know that," he said quietly, looking pained.
Sherlock nodded...if Myc'off said it, it must be true. He finally reached down and carefully plucked a Daisy that had several extra petals growing from the center of it by the bottom of the stem, the way he'd seen his brother do it, and placed it with the others.
"You were talking about man handling me on the beach. You thought to do that in front of Jawn and Sherlock?"
“Yes, fine. Up.” Mycroft released his hold on his baby brother and watched him bolt out of bed. “How shall we spend the rest of our afternoon?” he sighed...if only he still had that sort of energy.
Mycroft cleared his throat, and went on with washing his little brother's hair. "You are right now, and that's very good."
Sherlock starts to panic as he sees John move out the door and he strains to hear where John's going but can't hear the footsteps over his own racing heart. He notices, belatedly, that his very open groin is facing the door and moans loudly. Sherlock tries to still his mind, running through the elements on the periodic table, but can't get his mind to stop spinning; and just as he's made up his mind to roll out of position, John steps through door, naked save a pair of red pants. Sherlock hears him growl deep in his chest, which causes Sherlock's painfully hard erection to twitch.
Sherlock, ever the little observer, continued to watch his brother’s every step while his current dummy fluttered against his mouth. When he could no longer see him, he unfolded himself and climbed down onto all fours, then crawled after him.
"You want me to touch you, don't you, Sherlock?" John whispers into Sherlock's curls. John’s hot breath travels down, over his ear and across his neck, working up goose bumps on the flushed skin. "You want Daddy to do all sorts of dirty things to you?"
Greg stared at the baby for a moment before realization dawned; "Shit, sorry, honey bear. Greg will help." Greg took the cup and spoons from Sherlock and set them down, then held Sherlock's hands as he carefully knelt down and then twisted onto his bottom with a groan.
Greg peeled the foil back off of another container of applesauce and placed it within Sherlock's reach. "I thought he'd be putting up a lot more f-u-s-s because of the s-u-n-b-u-r-n."
Sherlock just nodded and nuzzled closer to his brother's chest, and all three men remained in thoughtful silence until the car rounded the long driveway to Mycroft's estate.
Sherlock laid there and sucked his thumb while going through the motions--bum up, bum down, bum up, bum down--as Jawn rattled around the bottom of the changing table, where all of their supplies were kept. Mycroft snapped Sherlock's onesie closed, then bent down to take the bottle of baby powder that Jawn had picked up, but thankfully (frustratingly for him) couldn't figure out how to get open with only one hand.
Now that the boxers had been sent to their respective corners of the ring, Mycroft took his time in getting both Jawn’s cup and Sherlock’s bottle, then returning to the nursery to collect two blankets…the green one being Jawn’s, obviously, so that must mean the purple one was his little brother’s. He left them on opposite ends of the couch, and then put the DVD into the player. “…You may both come out now.”
"I know, me too." Greg batted his hands away. "We'll take our cereal in the sitting room and wrap up in blankets, how about that?"
There, he found Greg sitting on the floor of the bathroom and holding Sherlock on his lap, petting him as the tub filled. He'd taken the baby's shirt off and the kaleidoscope of bruises from his shoulder to his hip made Mycroft feel physically sick. "Here, sweet pea," he said, swallowing back the bile he felt in his throat with a smile. "Are you going to be very helpful and take your medicine without a fuss?"
Sherlock was standing as close to Jawn as he could get without touching him. He whispered something into the little doctor's ear that made him giggle.
"You'll see. Eat your food." Mycroft gave him a quick kiss on the forehead, then waited for Greg to get his food before serving himself.
"In a manner of speaking." Mycroft handed the little bottle of red drops to Sherlock. "Just two red drops, and we'll see what that gives us."
"Yea, don't let your brother see you do that," Greg chuckled, screwing the cap on Sherlock's cup. "Can you carry our spoons and your cup?"
Sherlock's eyes were wet, but he hadn't started to cry...yet. He leaned against Mycroft's chest and started to suck his thumb.
Jawn was slightly surprised at himself for forgetting his own friend; that’s just how deeply he’d been engrossed in his storytelling. Now that he was thinking about it, it had been awhile since he’d heard any snide remarks mumbled from behind a dummy, and in this case…silence was not always golden. There were no crashes or odd smells or discoloured smoke, so it couldn’t be
Jawn was nearly asleep, again. His fist full of cookie poised in front of his mouth, as his head bobbed forward sporadically.
He takes Sherlock’s lips against his own then, parting them with his tongue. There is no fighting for dominance in this moment; Sherlock let’s his lips be opened and his whole mouth be consumed by John. John had expected Sherlock to moan and whimper, but he isn’t prepared for the muffled cry against his lips as Sherlock arches his back, thrusting upward, and coating his own belly with cum. Blinking, John pulls back from the kiss and looks down at Sherlock's prick, which is twitching back to its normally flaccid state.
“Yes, yes. All done.” Mycroft rolled his eyes again at the hysterics, but gently helped Sherlock stand up.
"Leave my CandyCrush alone; the rest you can play." Mycroft rolled over and buried his face in his pillow. "You're not to download anything, either."
The familiar fire licking low in his belly moves from a slow burn to a house fire as he watches John growl down at him possessively. "d-d-d-d-addy" he stutters out around the staccato of John's pounding thrusts. "P-pl-please....c-c-cum, I-I-I...pl-please."
Mycroft rolled toward them and put his hand over Greg's. Together, they traced slow, random patterns over his little brother's sleeping back.
Using the same concentration he used to solve locked room mysteries, Sherlock tapped the plastic spoon on the side of the bowl until the peanut butter plopped off. "I di'id!" he hooted, dropping his cup onto the floor. "Ooo'bs. S'aw'ree."
And it’s the sound that draws John's attention, and if he didn’t possess excellent self-restraint, his chin would have dropped. Despite himself, John’s tongue darts out and across his lips as all the blood in his body rushes south, causing his prick to strain in his pants. Sherlock is an attractive man, but in this moment John can barely contain himself. Seeing Sherlock wet from the shower and uninhabited by any form of modesty is almost too much to bear. John watches silently, keeping his arms crossed firmly over his chest.
"I mean 'plan', as in what to do for dinner, and how to keep Sherlock entertained until then once he wakes up." Mycroft turned to enter the kitchen, finding that all the play-do had been put away, and the table cleaned. "I was thinking, we should take him outside for a bit of fresh air."
Jawn frowned down at the drawing he was making in the sauce on his shirt. “I eated the carrots. Y'abbits y'ike it.”
Sherlock sneered at him; "Shut up.” He then slouched low in his seat and folded his arms across his chest; "…I only wanted to play a game, just one,” he mumbled. “Not even a long one.”
“Only the funny things!” Jawn skittered past Mycroft and into the nursery. He pulled open the closet and dropped to his knees, half crawling inside, and began tossing items that were not ‘co'ders’ over his shoulder.
Mycroft adjusted the door leading to the bathroom, leaving it ajar with the light on, before heading for the stairwell.
Sherlock stuck two of his fingers in his mouth and nodded; "O'gay," he mumbled, and turned back to the stairs.
"What? No!" Greg kissed him again and was just this side of giving him a squeeze before remembering his broken ribs in the nick of time. "No, muffin," he said again, using his thumb to wipe Sherlock's cheeks. "No, no, no, no. Greg's not mad at you, or your babies, or at anyone else. Not at all."
Jawn carried over his trash and put it in the bin, while Mycroft turned on the faucet at the sink and squirted soap into his hands for him.
“His hands were covered in soap, and he decided to suck his thumb before I could clean them. He soaped his own mouth this time,” Mycroft said, drawing Sherlock into a hug and a quick kiss on the forehead before turning him back to the door. “And now, he has a mess to clean up while Jawn gets a treat.”
Sherlock pushed himself to his feet and moved tentatively to the side of the crib. The mattress sat higher than his old bed so that there was room for the side to slide down. Sherlock gave the railing a small kick before snatching the jumper off the pillow and backing away from the crib quickly.
Sherlock stood next to Greg while looking up at the window that his brother had just vacated. "G'eg?"
Jawn stared up at him, a tiny little wide-eyed thing covered in streaks of toothpaste and the tip of his finger hooked in his mouth, when his chin started to dimple.
Greg slipped the big, chunky one off and handed it to Molly, then helped Sherlock work the bangles over his wrist.
"I know, this is what you always hate," Mycroft said as he used his fingers to help rinse the shampoo out. "But you're doing so well and being such a good boy right now."
“The lavatory. You both have tasks to complete. Behave!” Mycroft slipped into the bathroom, closing the door. It was a huge gamble, leaving them alone, but nature wouldn’t wait any longer.
Mycroft put a large squirt of baby wash onto the flannel and began to gently lather Sherlock's shoulders. "Did you decide what kind of potatoes you want?"
"This one as well. Come on, Sherlock." Mycroft tugged on his baby brother's arm until he was standing.
"Hmm. No, you are Sherlock Holmes, after all," John Watson rolled his eyes as he dismissed Sherlock's words. "That doesn't matter anymore, love. Little one's have rules, and I intend to make sure they are followed."
"Molly's gonna have to come back when she has more time," Greg said, grinning and bouncing Sherlock in his lap.
"I'm a'w dun'. My be'yee is fu'. I s'ill ha'b room for cu'bca'ges though," Sherlock turned his face away from the offered bite.
Sherlock finally turned to face them, a faint smile on his face. "Top-notch commentary, Gavin," he said.
Mycroft turned him towards Sherlock, so he could latch on to someone else. “Yes, green.” He should have known that would be a magic mute button. “What else would you like?”
Jawn still wouldn’t look him in the eye, but at least Sherlock didn’t feel as if he was still in danger of getting punched. “Jawn?” He sat up on his knees and inched closer. “Jawn?” He was as close as he could get without wearing Jawn’s clothes with him. “Jawn?…Jawn? Jawn? Jawn, Jawn, Jawn, Jawn.” Sherlock was now pressing his face right against Jawn’s, making his nose squish downward. “…Jawn,” he whispered.
“Your brother doesn’t think he did, so probably not. Though he’s a tricksy little hobbit, isn’t he.”
“Not what I intended, but that works. Good job, Jawn.” Mycroft turned to the sink of dishes and put in the stopper. “Sherlock...if you want another prize, you’d better hurry up.”
He dropped another kiss on Sherlock’s forehead before he wrote that at the very top, making it bold and visible to Sherlock. "The Daddy Loves Sherlock Rules."
Mycroft cocked an eyebrow, closing the umbrella and setting it behind him in one fluid motion. “Captain Jawn needs his own coat on if he’d like to join us for ice cream.”
Mycroft nipped the tip of that finger, causing Sherlock to squeal again and yank it back. “You’re yellow.”
"You are being far too disgustingly adorable tonight." Mycroft reached over and pinched Sherlock's cheek, making him squeal.
Greg looked down at Sherlock as well, and tipped his head to the side, thinking. "...Bring me a clean nappy. And a washcloth. We'll just wipe him down best we can right here."
Mycroft cracked open an eye to see a giant dancing crab with terrible teeth. "...He sounds like Bowie."
"Billy followed the thumping and came 'round a tree, hoping that the thumping was Baxter...but no, all he and Sally found was a tiny squirrel thudding a big walnut against a tree. Billy was so disappointed, he felt like he might cry."
"We'll put them on downstairs." Slippery socks and a wibbly-wobbly toddler did not bode well on a marble staircase. "What color?"
Mycroft rolled his eyes and turned his head to look down at the baby. "Your Uncle is a bit touchy, isn't he?"
Mycroft had to tighten his grip and clasp Jawn’s clenched fist so it wouldn’t collide with his brother’s face. “Oh, Sherlock…really?! How do you both survive living with each other?!”
They ate in companionable silence, Mycroft feeding ever other bite to Sherlock, who built small cottage with his chips.
"Ain't that the truth," Greg said, tilting his cup back and draining the last of his tea. "Coffee?" he asked Mycroft.
Sherlock nodded seriously and went to find them the perfect table, inspecting each carefully before moving on to the next.
Sherlock shook his head sadly, "I din' halp wif da' f'wogs." Sherlock's face crumbled, tears rolling unbidden, "I dun' e'ben know they names."
“Do so!” Jawn insisted, even as Mycroft reached under his chin and made him tilt his head back, anyway.
"The p'ish wan'ned go bay'cation. No'd be food," Sherlock cried, huge alligator tears rolling down his cheeks.
"No." John said plainly. Sherlock shrugged and hummed his assent, leaning back into daddy. "One last thing before nap time, Pet," John kept talking over the sudden fuss happening in his lap. "Daddy reserves the right to change or add to the rules as needed. You are always allowed to respectfully object to any of my decisions, new rules, or punishments and rewards, and I will always consider your points, but ultimately it's my decision. Alright?" John pulled back to look at Sherlock's face; he’d stopped fussing and his whole attention was on John. "We're also going to have a safe word, a word to keep Sherlock safe. If we are doing something you cannot handle then you can use our word and no matter what is happening, we stop."
Sherlock glared at him with all of the impotent rage a two-year-old-at-heart could muster, but when he realized that wasn’t getting him anywhere, he finally settled back and watched the action unfold (for what must have been the 50th time) while taking long, slow drags from his bottle.
"Good, because we're going to do as many as you like." Mycroft walked back over and handed one of the damp cloths to Greg.
Within seconds, he was pushing coins into the claw machine and guiding the claw expertly. He dropped it over his selected prize and the machine scooped it with ease and dropped it into the bin.
Jawn pressed into the touch as he chewed on his own thumb. Why did he think this would be ok? Mycroft and Sherlock were brothers, so at least that made it a little less weird. Tears prickled his eyes as his nappy was stripped off and his bits felt the chill of the room. Damn...he really was a cry baby. Why was he always crying?!
“Are vegetarian,” Mycroft added dryly as he popped Sherlock’s dummy into his mouth and put a comforting arm around his shoulders to shield him from as many prying eyes as he could. “So we have nothing to worry about.”
…’ Mycroft saw that trying to get Sherlock to do anything for himself right now was utterly useless. Oh, well…if the woman at the counter was still watching, she’d already seen enough, including Sherlock sucking his thumb, so what did it matter anymore? He took the wet nap and wiped Sherlock’s face and hands, trying to sooth him in a low voice the entire time. “Shhhh, what’s all this, hm? What’s the matter…is it because your ice cream melted too fast?”
"Mmm," Mycroft hummed. He opened a nearby cabinet and pulled out the big metal mixing bowl that went with the stand. "What do you think? Can he wait long enough to decorate cupcakes? I would hate for him to--"
“Jawn, come here lad. Let’s get you out of those trousers,” Mycroft called, already digging in the cupboard for pajama bottoms. He glanced up to see Jawn frowning at him over his shoulder in the mirror.
“Of course,” Mycroft put a hand on the little detective knee. “Jawn, keep your spoon in your own cup,” Mycroft said, gently smacking the back of Jawn’s hand as it made its way into his cup for the second time.
While Mycroft was busy scowling at Sherlock, Jawn helped himself to another spoonful of Mycroft’s ice cream, leaving behind a trail of green whipped cream.
“See, it works. Now eat, please.” Mycroft turned to his younger brother, who was sticking his fingers directly into his sauce, then licking them off. “That tastes better on the pasta, you know.”
The smaller bite did prove to be more helpful, since the baby didn't have to open his mouth as wide. Greg gently spooned the cereal into Sherlock's mouth and watched as he chewed slower than usual. "Poor baby. We'll give your your medicine soon and that'll make it not-hurt, yeah?"
"Yes. Sherlock would never bump your arm on purpose. But it doesn't matter if it was an accident, it would still hurt our Jawn."
"...They'll all be happy no matter which you pick, Sherlock," Mycroft said, seeing the worried lines on his little brothers' face.
“Everything smells of baby powder,” Mycroft grumbled to himself as he pulled his coat on anyway. Then, with a dubious look, he lifted his umbrella to his nose and sniffed; “…everything!” he hissed.
Suddenly, Sherlock's hands are trailing all over his body. The detective’s long fingers digging into his skin only spur him on, and he thrusts particularly hard, angling up to hit Sherlock's sweet spot. Sherlock responds by growling and digging his fingernails into John's shoulder blades.
"And beads and seashells. These are going to be homes that any little fairy would be proud to live in."
"I'm not mad, either," Mycroft said, his tone measured, and skimmed through the selection of baby-approved movies they had until he found Kung-Fu Panda.
Mycroft took a moment to glance down as he held his insistent little bugger–er, brother at arm’s length. “Nicely done, Jawn…you get another prize.”
"It's just so sparkly clear, you can see all the way to the bottom," Mycroft said, leaning in close.
The phone played its theme, and the homescreen popped up. Sherlock entered his passcode. "It's the perfect time, George," he said, and looked at his screen. "And a good one, at tha--" Sherlock's mouth snapped shut, and he held his phone closer to his face.
Sherlock steadied himself with one hand on the floor, the other he wrapped around Daddy’s ankle. Tears still rolled down his cheeks and his breathe hitched as he repeated his crimes.
“Jawn.” When there was no response, Sherlock opened the door and peeked in. Jawn was on his side on the bed, frowning his little heart out. Sherlock sneaked into the room and curled on the bed behind him.
Sherlock’s mouth opened and closed but for once, he didn’t have a clever retort. His hands drifted back over his bum…not that it had hurt, not over his coat, trousers, and his nappy, but it had shocked him nonetheless. He looked out over the rest of the restaurant to see if anybody had seen only to find that each and every one was staring back at him before they all politely averted their gaze.
“That’s what he implied,” Sherlock said with a shrug as he dug out a package of wipes, a bottle of talcum powder, and two nappies. Truth was, he sounded more blasé than he felt…it wouldn’t be the first time Mycroft had changed him, but that had been when he was actually small. “Why…do you
Sherlock hopped off the bed, half-eaten biscuit left behind on the duvet. "In'bestigation! I can fin' it fa' G'eg!" Sherlock rubbed his hands together and turned in place, taking in the room.
"Hey," Mycroft leaned in next to him, still whispering. "Uncle Greg and I have a surprise for you after dinner." Sherlock turned and blinked up at him, still holding his pizza to his mouth. "But shhh...it's a special helper surprise."
Mycroft unlatched Sherlock's tray and carried it to the sink. "I don't think either of you need the extra sugar tonight."
“What did I tell you?!” Mycroft scolded, all but wagging his finger in his little brother’s surprised face. “‘Stay in your seat’ means stay in your seat, not ‘get up and do as you please!’”
Molly stepped in, looking around and trying not to gape at the sheer size of Mycroft's house. "Oh, uh, no thanks. Do I, do I need to take my shoes off or something?"
He nudged Jeffrey over and pulled his take away container out of the bag, then put it on the top shelf. “Goodnight, Jeffrey.”
Congratulating himself on being brilliant, Sherlock spared one more glare at the crib before he made his way down the hall. He was through the kitchen and on the landing before Daddy noticed him. “Little man, where do you think you’re going?” Daddy didn’t sound amused.
Sherlock fell into the little doctor’s embrace, burying is face in Jawn’s shoulder; “So'wwie, Jawn.”
"He needs a bath," Greg said, tossing the rag aside as he finally gave up. He was likely to hurt the kid if he kept trying to scrub, and that was the very last thing he wanted.
"Ok! I c'n do'id!" Molly took two steps and had to hide her face in her hands from the hoots and hollers.
Sherlock nodded, and Greg led him back to the bed and got him to climb back up before sitting down next to him.
Sherlock continued to pout up at the ceiling and, by the shift in his breathing, Mycroft knew that a fit was beginning to brew. "Come here," he sighed, urging Sherlock to sit back up, and pulled him over into his lap sideways. "Where's the damned bottle?"
Mycroft pushed the point of the umbrella down. “I’m going to be taking MY umbrella back, if neither of you can treat it properly…and you can have your dummy back later, not now.”
"I'm not wearing pants, remember...oh!" Greg's hands flew back to cover his underwear and he did a neat pirouette, turning to face the crowd, red-faced and sputtering.
Sherlock beamed, smiling so broadly that Greg was afraid he was going to hurt his face, and wiggled happily.
“He is small. But don’t tell him I said so.” Greg put his hand on Sherlock’s back and guided him back out of the of the greenhouse.
“You’re Daddy’s smart boy. I’m sure you’ll manage.” John said as he wrote out the rule in his looping long hand.
Mycroft arched an eyebrow. Texting was smart. John knew a call would likely be met with a hostile remark, or flat-out ignored...but it was nearly impossible to ignore a text without reading it first.
Sherlock fumbled his phone, nearly dropping it. He couldn't remember the last time he'd heard Mycroft curse like that.
John glanced in the kitchen, and groaned. What a mess. Sherlock had meant well, but he was not looking forward to cleaning it up.
"I could be a faerie at this point." Greg brushed his hand down his shirt, adding another cascade of glitter to the piles on the ground.
Mycroft quickly reminded himself that this meant he was going to have to change yet another nappy, as well as another set of clothes. He began to roll up his sleeve; “I told you to put the sippy cups in the sink…is this the sink, Sherlock?”
"Perfect. Neither of us will remember."Mycroft sat down on Sherlocks' other side, with a plaster, ointment, and scissors in his lap, as well as a wet flannel. "If we wet it, it may not hurt to take off."
“Oh no, I think not!” Mycroft growled, hefting Jawn up and over his shoulder in one fluid motion, causing the wailing little doctor to shriek again. A sharp swat to the back of his leg cut him off.
“Oh! Ye’sh!” Jawn clapped before turning back to Sherlock. He popped a quick kiss onto Sherlocks' nose before touching the tips of their noses together and rubbing back and forth gently. “Bunny ki’shes!”
Taking several deep, slow breaths, Mycroft turned into the bathroom--and found his little brother sat, fully clothed, in the rapidly filling tub, drawing on the tile with his bath crayons. Floating amongst the bubbles and bath toys, were several sippy cups.
And heaved a sigh in relief as he discovered Jawn, fast asleep and curled into a position that was going to have his shoulder in agony later that night.
Mycroft brought Sherlock into a hug and began to rub his back. "Alright, we're done down here...time to go upstairs. Maybe Gregory will bring a nice bottle with him when he joins us," he added, eyeing Greg over Sherlock's shoulder.
Greg placed the tube in Sherlock's hand and turned to look at Mycroft's faerie house; "That's-" in the next instant he had face (and mouth) full of glitter. Greg spat a mouthful; "SHERLOCK...!"
“And we’re done here. Jawn, will you get out the hero movie we’re going to watch and put it in the DVD player?” Mycroft guided him out of the bedroom.
"Good for you, that's my smart boy," John praised. He turned to pick up one of the paper bags. "I've brought a surprise for you too, should we have a cuddle on the sofa and share our surprises?"
John cocked an eyebrow at Sherlock, causing him to look at the floor and shuffle his feet. John took the phone from Sherlock and pressed it to his ear. "He's right Mycroft. He can't be punished for what happened at Baskerville again, but if he isn't careful he'll be in trouble for his current attitude."
“To keep them safe; but really it’s to show you that Daddy loves you and is going to take care of you.”
Greg helped boost the baby so he was sitting on the counter next to the mixer. "I get one of the beaters too!"
"Oh, stop. You love them." Greg turned his head so Sherlock couldn't flash the little penlight in his eyes.
. It gave him an odd sort of comfort when he was in littlespace, having people talk about him like that as if he wasn't right there to hear everything...it infuriated him to no end when he was big, the condescending nature of it, but when he was small, it only made him feel smaller, and cared for.
Greg shrugged at the glower he got from Mycroft. "It's a short enough walk across the yard; he'll be fine."
Sherlock pulled the plug and sat watching as all the bubbles started to swirl and create a vortex over the drain. "Bye-bye bubb'as," he said with a little wave.
Greg sneered and turned towards the small shed at the back of the yard. "I'll show you a greenhouse," he muttered, even though he didn't quite know what that was supposed to mean, himself.
Greg stared at the little robot sitting on their kitchen counter. He didn't know where it had come from or why it was there, but...well, there it was, sitting there, blinking its lights at him.
"See, that proves it." Greg carefully inched himself down further into bed. "Stop worryin' yourself over it. He won't even remember come morning."
"I love you because you are terrible at bargaining." Mycroft kissed the side of Sherlock's head and stood up. "Come on Jawn, it's time to get cleaned up and lie down in your comfy bed."
John's still in such a fucked up headspace, he doesn't notice the way Sherlock's breathing has changed, just on the verge of tears. Or the shifty little fidgeting.
Jawnn giggled, and barely, sorta'-almost-not-at-all noticed when Mycroft closed the front of his nappy and taped it shut. “I love sprinkles.”
Mycroft turned the tap back on, but just at a trickle. "My hand is going to 'oops' all over your bum if you make another mess," he said, and brushed his hand at the water droplets that had splashed onto his waistcoat.
her favorite game, and she didn't have many clothes of her own to dress up in, or other little friends to play with, and Toby didn't really like it after one outfit, and, oh! It had been
Sherlock day quietly, for so long that Mycroft didn’t think he was going to answer; “...It makes thing quiet.”
"The muscle relaxer may make him constipated. That's what they do, relax your muscles, so it may make it hard for him to, y'know,
"Maybe later; this nappy is gunna split," Greg said as he tore the tapes open. "When was the last time Myc changed you?"
Despite a heavy dose of pain medication, Sherlock groaned as Mycroft helped pull him to his feet. "Owwww'sh."
The little doctor’s face and ears turned three shades of red. Mycroft didn’t bother waiting for a response and instead tugged Jawn close by the top of his trousers and checked the state of Jawn’s nappy for himself. “You need a changing as well. Come along, lads.”
Sherlock preened at the praise and allowed John to guide him into the sitting room. John sat down and found himself with a lap full of squirming detective.
Sherlock paused at the bottom of the steps and frowned and, for a split second, Greg was hopeful that he was regressing again and the next words out of his mouth would be 'Hel'b, G'eg.'
"I think that's more to keep your fingers off his chips than anything," Greg carefully brought over the two halves of the cupcake and sat it in front of the stuffies. "Should we sing happy birthday again?"
Sherlock's chin bobbed up and down as he gripped John's wrist and dragged towards the sofa eagerly. John laughed, as he was drug along. When they arrived Sherlock waited patiently for him to take a seat and pull him down on his lap, which he did promptly. John got a glimpse of the card, but did not say anything. "You first then."
Sherlock beamed as Mycroft knelt down next to him to help him pick. "Look, this one has shorter petals on one side..." he said, pointing one of the little white flowers out. "I think making it yellow would take the attention away from that."
John read the words and felt his eyes mist over and he had to take several deep breathes to keep from sobbing.
Mycroft shook out the cramps that were building in his shoulder and went back to patting Jawn’s bum. “Your Nana is a brilliant woman.”
“He doesn’t need nagging to get him to eat chips. He’ll eat his and mines and yours, if we let him," Jawn said, tugging ineffectually at his jumper to cover his nappy.
Mycroft rolled his eyes at the obvious manipulation, but decided to let it slide. “What shall you draw for my fridge?”
Sherlock went stiller than a stone and stared up at Mycroft with wide, shocked eyes…eyes that started filling up as the rest of his face crumbled and quaked with what promised to be a massive squall.
"For your hair, silly boy. It looks like you put your finger into an electrical socket." Mycroft carefully started to undress Sherlock, having to pry his hands off his bum to pull his arms out of his sleeves.
"Oh, yeah." Greg set down two cups, each with their own teabag, and poured steaming water into them. "One thing you could do," he said, replacing the kettle while letting the tea steep; "is finish that story, proper. Where'd you learn to make up stories like that, anyway?"
"We're going to change your wet pants as well." Mycroft moved quickly, stripping off the sodden puff. "At least we know we've been keeping him well hydrated."
John barely looks up from his computer when Sherlock enters the sitting room. He’s used to Sherlock walking around in a towel after a shower. A quick glance up tells John that he’s doing it again.
"I said I wasn't gon'na," Greg whinged, and Sherlock whipped around in his seat to see his big brother walking into the kitchen.
Sherlock stopped; “Shade...shady.” His eyes lit on the wheelbarrow. Greg had let them take turns riding in it that morning and now...now it was turned over, half propped against a huge terra-cotta pot.
“Sherlock, no need to be rude about it…you both need to use kinder words with each other.” Mycroft held them close to each side, no longer caring how the trio might look to passersby and wishing he hadn’t already said ‘no’ to giving the dummy back. ‘Just get them to the parlour…just get them to the parlour…’
Greg turned towards the house, where a single window remained open. “Hey, Myc? We could use some help out here.”
"We'll wipe em down and they'll be all yours," Greg took the bow off the present and watched Sherlock cram half a cupcake into his mouth so he could shred the paper with both hands.
The much coveted ‘prize bucket’ was a plastic purple pail, covered in cartoon skulls--Nana had given it to them last Halloween, full of sweeties, and now it held an assortment of small toys and 'treasures’ as well as sweets.
Sherlock blinked up at him, wide-eyed and attentive. “Cup?” he asked, nodding, and scurried off to another cabinet. “Cup! Cup, cup, cup, cup…” he chanted and, opening the one that contained all of their sippy-cups and bottles, selected one for Mycroft and brought it back “Cup!” He held it up proudly.
Mycroft had secreted his phone back into his pocket, the video hidden inside an encrypted file, just in case tiny hands (very large hands, actually…) found his phone. “That’s a beautiful lullaby, Jawn," he said, and picked up his crayon back up to put the finishing touches on the frosting on his cake.
Sherlock leaned back against Mycroft's chest and sucked on his finger, going cross-eyed a few times as he tried to focus on what Greg was doing. "G'eg?"
"The lilies did come in very nicely this year," Mycroft agreed, snatching a piece of toast from the plate Greg put in front of Sherlock.
Mycroft heard a soft noise and turned to see Greg standing in the doorway, hands shaking so badly that it was quite an effort to keep a hold of the sippy cup.
"Did you? I am sorry. Are you better now?” Mycroft struggled to get the squirmy little detective back in his own seat, so he could give Jawn his full attention.
It took every ounce of reserve to keep from racing into the pantry and back again, but the baby had promised and Mycroft had to show Sherlock the same trust that he himself showered Mycroft with everyday.
Sherlock's freezes in panic for a second before he looks up at John with a wide smirk. Before he’s able to utter a single syllable of the pithy remark he has planned, John is across the room and pulling him up.
"C'mere, sweetheart, yea, such a good boy." Greg gently pulled Jawn to his feet. Jawn lifted his arm, expecting to be picked up. "I'm sorry baby. I can't pick you up without hurting your arm."
"Thank you," Mycroft said, running his hand back over his thinning hair. "Why don't you stay for lunch, Molly? I'm sure Sherlock would love to have someone else to talk to, for once."
"Support him. Support John, when he decides that he needs help as well. Let them both know that another 'episode' will not be tolerated."
Sherlock leaned back with his cup and watched the spectacle Jawn was making, and Mycroft noticed his eyelids starting to look dark and heavy.
Sherlock closed his eyes and started to snuffle behind his cup, gearing up for the figurative dam to burst.
Mycroft shrugged. “Well…it’s partly true. You do tend to bottle up every emotion you’re faced with until they result in tears and wet nappies.”
"But not that good." Greg took the dummy and popped it into his own mouth, popped it out, then popped it into the Sherlock's mouth in one fluid motion. "Maui's going to have to find his own hook."
“Oh look! We’re here! Thank the bloody lord!!!” Mycroft practically shoving both little boys in the door of the ice cream parlour.
"One," Sherlock counted, his tongue poking between his teeth as he painstakingly dribbled four drops of blue dye into the third cup. "I di' y'it!" he shouted, throwing up his hands and raining blue droplets everywhere.
How would Mycroft end up babysitting to begin with? I feel like he'd want to interact with Sherlock when he's small because it'd let them both be as affectionate as they want without their usual reservations. Jawn would be incredulous at best about My. At least at first.
“My’coff na’ da’ boss of da’ kitchen.” Jawn grumbled, pouting when his soapy thumb touched his tongue.
Sherlock took held onto Greg's wrist and sucked all the soup off the bread before biting down and chewing it.
“Right now, in stature only” Mycroft sighed. “I managed to walk up behind him without him noticing, after all.”
“There is one last rule I’d like to add, Sherlock. This one is a bit different but just as important as the rest.” John glanced down at the soft face of his boy and steeled his reserve. “Sherlock will not manipulate or lie to Daddy.” He jotted it down on the list quickly, trying to gauge the response coming from his lap. He could see the younger man’s eyes working, mind sifting through their past, and their possible future.
"I know." Mycroft tried to sit Sherlock on the bed but the baby clung to him, his sobbing ramping up again. "Alright, I hear you. You're alright," Mycroft turned and sat on the bed, arranging Sherlock in his lap. The baby wiggled as close as he could get, huffing a sigh against Mycroft's neck.
“Yes, Jawn can help me as well.” Mycroft eased the baby off his lap and back onto the floor. “Can you create the snowman with the head cherry?”
Mycroft finally picked his own mug up and stared down into it as well. He tilted it, watching the dregs that had settled into the bottom slide. "You remember that, but you don't remember eating two days worth of calories in sweets."
Jawn stared at Mycroft’s outstretched hand for a moment before puffing his chest and turning to take the stairs two at a time.
"Perfect." Greg went over to the pantry and found the individual cups of applesauce, then took one and placed it in the freezer.
"There's only so many places in the yard, Gregory." Mycroft appeared in the window, leaning on the sill. "How many of those places have you actually searched?"
"I'm going that way anyway," Mycroft said, gathering the soled nappy and wipes, and rolling them all up. "Just the plasters?"
"No, f'ank 'oo. I c'n do'id!" Sherlock grabbed the noise maker for his bugs and started to waddle out of the kitchen. "Pa'ber?"
“Shh, keep playing with your bubbles,” Mycroft replied, and held down the little bottle for Sherlock to reach--while he didn’t cut the movie completely off, he made sure to fast-forward and skip the more, er,
Jawn turned away from the dark hallway and faced him. "My'coff," he pleaded in his tiny, watery voice, hands clasped in front of him as if he were begging (and in a sense, he was); "I'm star'bing, I rea'yee am!"
He reached down to rub a sharp cheekbone with his thumb, attempting to settle him. "Have I ever been cruel to you before, love?"
Sherlock did one of John’s rage sniffs, throwing the onesie onto the sofa and pulling a horribly wrinkled dressing gown from between it’s cushions. “I’m not little anymore, I’ll speak however I please.” He wrapped himself in the silk and then flopped down.
"Shh-sh-sh...c'mere, muffin," Greg said as he sat up, eyes still closed. He wrapped his arm around the baby and pulled him close, his hand rubbing up and down his back. "We'll watch it from the beginning again tomorrow, sweetheart...Greg promises."
Sherlock nodded. "Be ri'de ba'g?" he asked before suckling down on his cup as he if hadn't had a drop to drink in days.
"Can't I just have a spanking and stay up with you instead?" Sherlock's voice is impossibly small and for a moment John almost relents, but in the next instant Sherlock is yawning wide enough to pop his jaw.
"It probably loosened when he was glittering his own faerie house," Mycroft rubbed the baby's back. Sherlock had mostly quieted, to exhausted and unwell to fuss for long.
Greg sighed, as well. "Yeah, alright," he agreed, even though he knew that Jawn was nowhere in the greenhouse.
"Good boy, go with Gregory," Mycroft said, and waited until they were out of eyesight to pull his phone out. He tapped in a number and waited nearly a full minute for the person to answer.
Mycroft cocked an eyebrow but turned and swung the door wide, ushering the little boys out before shutting the door.
Sherlock held up his hands and looked from one to the other. "My han's aren't y'ittle," he said, showing his brother.
Mycroft looked down at Sherlock, who still had his fingers locked together over his head. “He doesn’t want it.”
"Like I said, your meds are on my nightstand. Are you going to sleep on your cot or do you want me to make up the guest bed?"
, his clothes were changed, and Mycroft was at last able to climb into bed. He sighed as he sank down onto the mattress and pulled the duvet over his legs...it may not have been his own bed, the best bed, but right now it felt like absolute heaven.
Jawn looked massively offended at the implication. “We don’ pee on the floor,” he said as Sherlock scurried around him to drop their bath toys back in basket. “Tha’s gross!”
"You've had a little too much sun today...we're going to use a bit of cream on you, so you tan nicely."
He reached up and gingerly brushed his hand over his cheek, over the myriad of purple and brown and yellowing bruises, the swelling under his eye, the...
He’d be gone and back with chips before she even knew he was gone. “What’s the worst that could happen?” He grumbled to himself as he slipped out the front door.
"Yeah, there's Sherlock...I told you he was still here," Greg said. "So he doesn't need to be found, and you need to stay put."
Greg felt the sweat prickling the back of his neck, but unlike Sherlock, he knew it wasn't all from the heat. But no, Sherlock was right of course...Jawn wasn't at the large, man-made half barrel full of waterlilies, or among the benches of ferns and assorted orchids and gardening tools. "Jawn, sweetheart, please come out?" he tried anyway.
"No you weren't touching it... What were you doing Sherlock? Were you imagining fucking Daddy? Hmm? Were you thinking about your baby boy cock up Daddy's arse? Do you think Daddy is going to allow that? Especially when you were so naughty that you could not even wait for him?"
"Right, good on y'ah for remembering that." While Sherlock stood in front of the changing table, Greg took his towel and began to pat and rub him dry. "But if you're gon'na help make cupcakes, you're going to be around the oven. Plus, it's just better to be dressed in the kitchen, anyway."
John just chuckled and continued to stroke Sherlock until his breathing had evened out. “Sweet dreams, Pet.” John murmured as he pulled the side of the crib up and into place with a gentle click.
“I really don’t want too…” But a glance at Daddy’s face stalled Sherlock’s argument. “Safe…you said being safe.”
"But your rewards could be picking out our takeaway supper, or getting extra time for your experiments." He could feel the boy's smile through his jumper at the last one.
"Language." Mycroft let them into the kitchen and went to the cabinet and pulled out a pink cup. "Will this one work?"
Sherlock made distressed sounds behind his dummy before selecting a pink dummy covered in geometric shapes.
"We'll be going home as soon as they're done," Mycroft murmured, pressing his lips to the top of Sherlock's hair. "They won't do the cast until tomorrow, anyway."
Mycroft helped himself to one last bite, he’d make the driver stop for take away on the way home. “Is everyone full? Good. Put your plates and silverware into the sink please.”
"He'll be back soon, honest. I want him here in bed with us too. So if he's not back in half an hour I'll go fetch him myself. Deal?" Greg stuck out his pinky.
”Because…” Mycroft mentally sprinted to find a reason that didn’t include ‘because people would stare, and if you’re that worried about your nappy showing, why would you want your dummy?’…now was not the time to be so biting. “If you had your dummy in your mouth, how would you be able to eat your ice cream?”
Mycroft felt a twinge of guilt at the thought of leaving them here by themselves, at least while they were both Little.
"Be'yee y'ubs sh'ips." Sherlock shocked the both of them by opening his mouth for a bite of salad. "Y'ettuce is on'y o'tay."
"It's very charming," Mycroft kissed the plaster. "Would you like a biscuit now? They are butter cremes."
“Sorry, Pet. Daddy shouldn’t tease that way. We are going to lay out the rules because it helps little boys behave if they know what’s expected of them, and what’s going to happen if they don’t follow the rules.”
ouchy," Greg said as he put the small tube aside and sat up, taking Sherlock's face in his hand and turning it to get a better look at his stitches. "It's gonna make the ouchy go away."
"G'eg take'd goo' care o'b me," Sherlock slurred, and Greg noticed that his eyes appeared unfocused. He handed him his cup and kissed his forehead. "You just rest and watch your show, muffin."
Sherlock looked down at his cup full of…well, it was more chocolate soup now than ice cream. He picked out another worm with his fingers. “Is’all melted.”
“It may seem as if I’m being unkind. But following the rules is imperative. They are there to keep you safe.”
"Yes, big ones, much bigger than our boat, with millions of teeths!” Jawn added, oblivious to Sherlock’s distress.
“Yes, I can see that.” John moved him to the side of the crib and ran a steadying hand down his back when he froze. “Come on, into bed.”
Mycroft read the story slowly, pausing on every page to make sure Jawn got a good look at the pictures before carrying on. By the time he closed the book, both little boys were snoring softly, with Jawn still hugging Sherlock to his chest.
Greg's shoulders slumped as he relaxed. "Yeah, I promise," he sighed. "Won't happen again, love, I swear."
"P'ease, p'ease, p'ease..." Jawn let Greg nudge him out of the way of the bars, but the second they were down he was right there, trying to climb Greg's front.
"That'd make i'd easier!" Molly chirped as she scurried back with a handful of jewelry. "I did i'd!"
Sherlock's face scrunched and he wriggled under the touches. "Noooooooo," he whinged, and Greg slipped his dummy back in his mouth...which he promptly spat back out. Greg left it alone. "Yeah, same day you saw him last."
They were going to take the first-aid kit and tape some gauze around that poor baby's stitches, he decided. He couldn't take listening to anymore crying like that.
"You are a sock-losing magician." Greg eased the second boot over Sherlock's long foot. "I don't think we have a single set we started with."
"That's alright. No harm done," Mycroft bent and grabbed the cup, then put it on the counter next to the baby's hip. "Now we need butter and the confectioner sugar."
"Turn out your light and lay down. I'll help you." Greg opened his mouth to protest, but Mycroft just rolled his eyes. "Lie down, Gregory."
Greg huffed...well, that was good news, he supposed? He turned away from the window back to the yard, cupped his hands around his mouth, and hollered "JAWN!!!"
Sherlock's mouth is suddenly dry. He's only ever fantasized about topping Daddy, but to actually do it...he'd do anything to get the privilege.
“Captain Jawn!” The esteemed Captain wasn’t going to let his title go so quickly, especially not while he was on duty.
“That’s what I thought.” Mycroft stood with them, looking at the different tubs of ice cream and quietly deciding on his own. A youngish woman, probably late 20′s, came over and gave them a commercially-bright smile. “How can I help you gentlemen today?”
“Jawn…” Mycroft took around, expecting the worst…and saw Jawn sitting on the floor, fridge door wide open, and eating the slices of carrot from the bag of pre-mixed salad. Okay, not the worst. He put his hands on his hips and stared down at the worried-looking little boy; “…I thought you said you weren’t hungry, you little thief. Get out of Mr. McGregor’s garden!” he said, and playfully snagged the bag from him.
Sherlock grunted as Mycroft helped him to his feet and undid his trousers. Now that the bruises on his ribs were no longer a surprise, Mycroft took note of the iodine stains where his brother's IV's had been. "Did you take a bath after you can home from hospital?"
"My big, strong knight in shining armor." Mycroft unfolded one of their thicker bedtime nappies and laid it in the bottom of Sherlock's sleeper. "A bit of powder...and you can set him down."
"The boys have watched this movie no less than six times while they've been here. Are you really telling me you've never seen the end."
"Yes, such pretty flowers, they couldn't resist. So, they both sat down, and while Baxter snipped the flower stems with his teeth, Billy would gather them in his hand. And then guess what happened??"
Mycroft smirked. "Power sugar is a good name, too." He shook some out of the bag, and into a measuring cup. "We're going to pour a little bit in, and then turn on the mixer, okay?"
Both little boys eased into the room on their tiptoes...though, as tired as Mycroft was, he was practically dead to the world by now. They could have stampeded into the room with Jawns' whistle, and he would have been none the wiser.
Sherlock moved out onto the landing, placing the stool at his feet. He glanced at Daddy, still doing the washing up from breakfast. He nudged the stool with his barefoot, almost gleeful at the dull scrap it made against the hardwood. He nudged a few more times until one of the four stout legs was dangling over the staircase. Sherlock thought of sitting on the stool now. It might be fun, like riding a bucking bronco. He glanced again into the kitchen and Daddy still wasn’t paying attention to him, probably assuming Sherlock was sitting on the stool as he’d been told. Daddy was always crap at deductions.
Sherlock straggled behind for a moment, and took ahold of Mycroft's sleeve. "My'cobb p'yay too?" he asked, peering up at his brother with big, hopeful eyes.
Mycroft curled his lip at the whole spectacle, and slowly pushed his plate away. "Neither am I, suddenly."
"It really didn't." Greg picked out the bottle of painkillers from the bag, and shook two pills into his palm before handing Sherlock his sippy cup. "Real quick, before our cereal goes soggy.
Sherlock giggled at him, gripping the front of his jumper and wiggling excitedly. "No, no, no, Daddy! I want it! You're not allowed to return my treat! Pretty please!"
"You can have as much cereal as your greedy little heart desires." Greg zipped up Sherlock's jams and gave the front of his nappy a pat.
Mycroft gently moved Sherlock’s less than dexterous fingers out of the way and closed the front of his trousers. “Buttons can be tricky.”
“Bu’ I don’t want tooooo!” Sherlock fussed as he collapsed into the vacant space Mycroft’s bum had left on the couch facedown, bottom up.
Sherlock snuffled and rubbed his wet cheeks against Greg's shirt as he readied himself to go to sleep, then turned to look at his brother at the sound of his voice...and instantly perked up at the sight of his phone. "I see?" he asked, lifting his head and reaching for it. "I see, My'coff? P'ease?!"
Greg was quiet for a minute, while he ran gentle fingers through the dozing little detective's hair. "...Are you just making sure I don't give him cupcakes for breakfast?"
"On second thought, I will have your fish with me in my bath," Mycroft took the fish from Sherlock and headed into the bathroom. "I'm going to show the fish what the stork saw while Gregory helps you with your toys."
“Um…” Jawn turned back to the cabinet that held all of their toddler cups and bottles and looked over all of them, tapping his finger on his chin. “This…no, this one!” he said finally and held up an insulated cup with a blue insert, decorated with sea turtles. He was very proud of his choice.
Sherlock accepted the bite, and the next. "Thas a'licious," Sherlock yawned around the spout of his cup.
Greg was quick to move it away from him while he brought up the music app. "What do we want to listen to tonight, gents?"
Sherlock had wiggled his way fully onto Mycroft’s lap and now had his brother’s face cupped in his hands. "My?”
John instinctively rested one of his hands on the back of Sherlock's head, his fingers pulling through the knotty curls. "You're a good boy." He praised as he gave Sherlock a quick kiss to the top of his brow.
Mycroft pinched his lips together tightly in order not to laugh and disturb either of the little ones.  He plucked the blanket Sherlock had been nuzzling up from the floor where it had fallen, and went to follow behind Jawn closely, just in case of a tumble.
Sherlock kept grinning in spite of himself as he pulled the tiny device from the box and, while ignoring the shouts of "WELL HE'S NOT LITTLE ANYMORE, IN'NIT HE??!!" and "THAT'S NO EXCUSE!", plugged it into his phone and began the process of installing the corresponding app. Though he'd never admit it out loud...he was actually pretty interested in trying out that fart-thing that Greg had suggested.
John has stopped spanking, and his hand is trailing down his stomach towards his own erect prick. “Mmmm…. Daddy is going to touch himself….”
Greg gave him another turn and painstakingly walked out into the hall, unable to move his legs much above the knee.
Sherlock took Greg's hand and waddled beside him, checking their route with his telescope. "O'gay. So ba'dd'ries a'morrow then?"
“Apologies Mycroft, he’s in a mood. Cuppa?” John moved about the kitchen efficiently, putting on the kettle and looking for cleanish mugs.
Mycroft looked up from powdering his bottom just in time to catch Sherlock's hand before he could rub his face with it. "That's just the medicine, sweetheart. That's how we know it's working...just don't rub."
"Seriously, the cutest thing on the whole planet, oceans and all," Greg sighed, turning onto his stomach and closing his eyes.
Mycroft held sherlock's hands and helped him step into the tub and lower himself into the water. "Poor love," he said when he heard the slight hiss of breath as the warm water touched upon what had to be some very tender spots. "We'll be very, very careful with this bath, hm?"
Greg shrugged and held up two different boxes of ice lollies, then opened the box of tropical fruit flavored ones for Sherlock.
Sherlock made sure Baxter was buckled in while Greg pulled take-out boxes out of the fridge. "We ha'b cu'b'ca'ges firs'?"
"Be still, wiggle worm," Greg chuckled as he coated the baby in powder. "You're gonna make me do your nappy crooked."
"Tight enough for support, but you should be able to slip a finger in between the bandage and his skin. Can I take a look at your eye, sweetness? I just want to make sure the pupil contracts," she said, holding the penlight in one hand while she took Sherlock's chin in the other.
Greg frowned at him before gently scooping him up, both arms under his bottom. Jawn shivered and moaned but otherwise snuggled closer.
Sherlock didn't look like he believed that, but he didn't argue. "He said in this message that he's sorry," he said. "And this one. And this one as well. And this one."
"I do'nah 'member any mon'sers," Jawn said, scampering past Mycroft and nearly knocking Sherlock over in his hurry to get to the kitchen.
"G'eg in trooouuubbbllle," Sherlock sang quietly, dragging a finger through the cheese sauce on his plate and licking it off.
“Doesn’t live here with us. His opinion doesn’t count.” Sherlock offered Daddy a small smile at this and tried to stifle a yawn. “Come on, love. Daddy will sit with you until you fall asleep.” John said, finally managing to nudge Sherlock off his lap.
“Christ Mycroft! I said no pets! Especially not exotic pets! Couldn’t you have got him a goldfish instead?”
Lordy. Being in pain must have knocked him younger than he'd been in ages. "Yup, wake Mycroft." Greg brought him into the bedroom and went around to Mycroft's side.
Greg picked up their bowls and led them out of the kitchen and down the hall; "If it's not on telly, it's on Netflix." Once in the sitting room, he threw down a whole mess of pillows and blankets onto the floor, while Sherlock stood and watched him as if he'd lost his mind; "...G'eg?"
“Darling, you’re going to break all of these rules at one point or another. That’s just something that’s going to happen.” Sherlock looked up at him owlishly, huge unblinking eyes, looking for something. John tried not to fidget, he’d expected to have to spank Sherlock to get him amenable to this last rule, but this was much more unsettling.
The little detective jumped and landed on his knees, bouncing heavily on the mattress, and tossed the dummy at Jawn, hitting him square in the nose. Sherlock started laughing maniacally.
“The more quickly I find another dummy, the more quickly we can have juice and a snuggle.” Mycroft patted the little detectives bum and found him wet. No doubt Jawn was wet too. Changing him while he was having a tantrum was going to be a nightmare.
"I know, but I don't want your tummy to hurt later, and you don't want that, either." Mycroft kept patting until, just as Sherlock was working himself up, the tiny detective stopped still as his tummy gurgled and burbled all the way up his throat and, as Mycroft watched, a small burp puffed his cheeks out.
Mycroft sighed. "I feel the same," he said, reaching into the crib to give Sherlock's upturned bottom a pat. "Let's go, before he actually does sit up and start crying."
Mycroft gave Sherlock another slice of pizza, eyeing another piece for himself before closing the box.
"That actually sounds pretty good right about now," Greg said, and reached up to stretch one of Sherlock's curls out, then let it spring back.
John scoped the large coat off of the coffee table and left a cup of tea there. “So is this a social call or have you come about a case?” John asked as he hung Sherlock’s coat on the peg in the hallway.
Sherlock hurried over, his own cheeks tearstained, and crowded in on Jawn’s other side, surrounding him in snuggles.
“Noooo, no, no, no.” Jawn erupted in gulping sobs, clinging to Mycroft. “No bubba’s, Mycoff! P'ease no bubba’s.”
Mycroft gave him a look, since he had his hands too full to swat at him. “If Jawn draws worms, they will not be going on my refrigerator.”
...A few minutes later, Sherlock was gently snoring and Greg was having a hard time keeping his eyes open. "This Peep guy sure has a lot of friends he'll probably eventually eat."
"I dun' f'ink he y'ike me n'e'mo." Sherlock sighed, wet and exhausted against Greg's chest. He'd used up all of his feelings today.
“You didn’ do it right,” Jawn said, winding up another fish and placing it in the water, the spinning fins making soft plopping sounds on the surface as is ‘swam’ in a weak circle.
“And gummy worms. Thank you." Sherlock gave the girl behind the counter one of his best sham smiles.
"Maw'yee ea'ds wif Sher'yock an' Peanu'd," Sherlock nodded definitively and wiggled off Greg's lap. He took Mollys' hand and started tugging her to the kitchen.
"Yeah, you did...nobody knew where you'd gone off to, little boy," Greg said as he smooched the side of Jawn's head. "We didn't know what had happened!"
"Come on, nugget, up you get." Greg helped Jawn stand up and then looped an arm around his waist to keep him on his feet. Mycroft followed him out, straightening his jacket.
“Here we go, Pet. Hop in.” John said, letting go of Sherlock’s hand to hold open the pull-up he’d retrieved from the closet. Sherlock stepped into the pull-up and grit his teeth as it was tugged up over his very sore bottom.
"Two spoonfuls and that's it," Greg whispered, and held out his pinky so Sherlock could hook his own pinky to it.
Jawn’s mouth hung open before snapping closed with an audible click of his teeth. “I don’t want this anymore," he said, shoving the umbrella into Sherlock’s hands before turning on his heels and walking away.
"I didn't trick you. I asked a question, and you answered." Greg took him by the hand and gave it a squeeze. "C'mon, muffin...Let's get you your seven cereals." He then led Sherlock into the hallway; "Stay right here for ten seconds while Greg gets your medicine."
“Nuh’uh, you don’!” Sherlock tried to sit up and glare at Jawn accusingly, but the grip Mycroft’s hand had on his hair made him reconsider. “Jawn doesn’t c’ean!” he insisted as he glared up at his brother instead.
"Con'rarian," Sherlock agreed, hunkering over a pail of toys with a groan. "P'ish coun'd as one?" The baby held up a 'school' of wind up fish.
Molly sat on the floor next to Mycroft's chair, fiddling with her hair and eyeing more of Sherlock's rings. "Do you have make-ups, too?"
old," he said, amused. He fiddled with the childproof cap until he managed to forced it open, and shook out three pink tablets into his hand. "Here we go, dearest," he added, walking back over to the table. "This will help."
"You'll see." Greg swatted his backside and urged him towards the stairs where Mycroft had just reached the top with Jawn in his arms, and was continuing to carry him towards the nursery.
“Well, you’ve sat quietly on a very sore bum for about ten minutes. I was only going to have you sit on the naughty stool for five, so I think we’ll call it even, yea?”
Mycroft looked over to the side and there it was…the sippy-cup that he’d filled for naptime and then promptly forgotten about in his hurry to get the little detective into bed before he conked out in the middle of the floor.
“Well, that’s far more adorable than it has any right to be." Mycroft smiled as he fed Sherlock another bite of fish.
John began to pet Sherlock.  They stayed snuggled on the sofa for a bit before John moved to usher the little detective off of his lap. "Alright Pet, nap time." John said around a yawn. The younger man immediately started to huff his displeasure. "Whinging isn't a good idea if you'd like to pick our takeaway, Pet." John stood up stiffly, his legs protesting loudly.
Sherlock perked up as Mycroft turned off the mixer and stuck his little finger in for a taste. "Hmmm...you tell me," he said.
"Awww, baby," Greg said again, and sat on the floor with his back against the couch and gently pulled Sherlock up and into his lap. "Where did you lose your sloths hmm?" Greg rubbed his back. "You had em on when we laid down."
But, Mycroft was not a completely heartless man…just a dutiful one when it came to necessary measures. He sat and rubbed Jawn’s back (and his bum, just a bit) while he let him cry it out, and waited until the little doctor had regained a bit of composure before helping him sit up and straddle his lap. He held Jawn steady around the waist, and asked him; “…Are we done with the defiant attitude today?”
Sherlock squalled as Mycroft dumped two cups of water over his head in quick succession, rinsing out the conditioner.
"What else did you get at the market?" Sherlock shoved the last bite of the cupcake in his mouth and was licking his fingers.
He didn't remember it hurting this badly earlier. But if he were being honest with himself, though, he didn't remember much from the past two days: he remembered Gavin, and leaving his flat in a hurry. He remembered the car ride. A warm bath. A lot of food. Sleep. More food. More sleep. Mycroft fussing over him. Molly. He remembered laughing and a dull ache in his side, but nothing like this.
Mycroft dropped his hands that he’d been holding in the air, trying to keep Jawn in place through sheer force of will. “I told you to lie back down.”
As soon as he regains his bearings he resumes thrusting, harder and faster than before. "I. Said. Not. To. Bite. Daddy." He grunts as he drills himself deep into Sherlock with each word.
Mycroft paused in reaching out to help Greg down from the counter; that had almost sounded...disappointed. "I thought you were exhausted, as well?"
Mycroft scooted the little boy off his lap. “Perhaps. Though teasing will end in tears," he said with an imperious sniff.
The little detective sniffled pitifully; “Bye, Jawn," he whispered as he walked very slowly back into the sitting room.
"I know," Greg moved carefully into the kitchen, nudging antacids out of the way with his foot. "He's very bright and we will take care of him, even if he's not in our house."
Mycroft stood in front of him with a squirmy, sparkling tyke in his arms, and was trying desperately to keep him from rubbing his face. Greg could barely hear him over the fussing; "No...no-no, let big brother do it---Sherlock,
"G'eeeeeeeg," Sherlock whinged, and reached down to cover his bits when Greg took more than a minute to get on with it.
"Y'ots o'b p'etty f'ings,' Sherlock said, beaming as he opened his purse and began to show Mycroft everything he had packed, while Greg caught up to them.
The breakfast table was laid out with plates and napkins, and Greg was valiantly trying to pry four breadsticks out of Jawn's greedy little hand.
“You’re wearing half a tube of sun creme. The sun is fine.” Greg leaned further back in his chair, browning like a nut.
"Jawn is fine, Gregory has him." Mycroft could feel his younger brother shaking with nervous energy as he held him still. "You need to take a deep breath, and slow down. The worst part is over."
"That means you'd be walking on your own two feet too, muffin," Greg teased, and bounced Sherlock in his arms...right before he remembered that he probably shouldn't do that as Sherlock gave a squeal of pain and cried fresh tears.
"We'll see how you feel later, muffin," Greg said as he walked over. "Can you let Uncle Greg wash your face and hands?"
“I wasn’t looking at pornography. I saw it on Sally Donavon’s Tumblr account.” Trying, and failing, to sound huffy.
Greg set about helping Molly with getting her tiara to stay in the right place, but she had the same issue that Jawn suffered...her hair was so straight and fine, the tiara was just to heavy to sit without tilting. "I think it adds character," Greg said. "Like a sassy princess."
Jawn blushed beet red from his hairline down to his toes and scowled at Mycroft, then spun around as Sherlock started cackling. “Shut up!” Jawn shouted at his back as the naked detective dashed from the room and down the hall.
"Thank you for letting me rest for a bit longer." Mycroft turned Sherlock back towards the table with a pat to his bum. "Will there be tea?"
"I know, you were going to help, but I need you to listen." Greg carried Jawn past him, then set him on his feet while he opened the car door and bundled him in. "Climb in, Sherlock."
Mycroft watched as a shard of lettuce wiggled its way out the leg of Jawn’s romper. “...It’s most certainly time for a bath.”
"Well, hello to you little love," John greeted, opening his arms. It was always a surprise to come home and be greeted with Sherlock's little headspace. He welcomed it, compared to coming home to a sulky broody Sherlock, his baby was a delight. He took Sherlock into his arms and held him tight, planting a kiss on top of his head. He then saw the flecks of glitter mixed in with his curls. Reaching up, John brushed some of the glitter away.
“Y-you, you m-mean it?” Sherlock whispered, his voice sounding strained, and Mycroft could practically feel that awful throat-clenching sensation one gets before a big cry for him.
Jawn stared at Sherlock, wide eyed before gently picking up the crayon and cradling it to his chest. He licked his lips and began; “If I had words to make a day for you…” Jawn paused to glance nervously at Mycroft before going on. “I’d sing you a morning, golden and true.”
"You already don't. And you don't have to. But I'm going home just the same; clothes or no clothes, phone or no phone."
"I'mma need to record you sayin' that, or get it in writing or something." Greg pulled himself out a regular bowl, then clapped his hands once, sharply; "Now! Cereal!"
Greg snorted as he shoved three more cups of applesauce into the freezer, and Mycroft gave him a look which only made him laugh out loud.
"Well, I usually like doing them at the same time," Molly held out her hand and Sherlock put her penlight in it.
“No, you’re still a tough little soldier, aren’t you?” Mycroft cleaned Jawn up thoroughly, getting all the little nooks and crannies as he’d been well and truly soaked to the point of almost leaking.
The two men just stared at each other for a minute, neither saying a word. Greg's breathing was harsh, and heavy.
"Right, right," Mycroft said, keeping a steady hand on the small of his little brother's back. "But what are we going to be when we dig them up?"
Mycroft sipped the rest of his coffee before calling for a car to pick up Molly. Then, after refilling his mug, he headed into the sitting room and made himself comfortable on the sofa before leaning down and tweaking Greg's nose.
Mycroft chuckled; “You’re cuter this way…I should have bribed you sooner. Did Sherlock find his shoes yet?” he called out. “I’d hate to leave without him!”
John closes both eyes hard for a moment and takes a breath before maneuvering Sherlock under the covers.
“NO,” Mycroft said firmly, and pulled him back. “What is it with you both and climbing in fully clothed?!” He unsnapped the dripping, stained onesie (another chore for Ms. Hudson; they seemed to keep piling up…she must really care for them if she hadn’t booted them into the street by now), and tugged it over Jawn’s head, the smaller man squawking and fussing the entire time until his head popped free.
"I don't want a bisque. I don't even know what that is," he grumbled, throwing his arm over his face. He stayed that way for a few moments before huffing and sitting up. It wasn't fun to pout if no one was paying attention.
He leans over, bracing one hand on the bed. The other, still fisting the toy, braces against the mattress for leverage. Sherlock presses the tip of his cock at the entrance and catches his breathe before thrusting forward and finding himself buried to the hilt. Sherlock thrusts awkwardly a few times, trying to catch the angle. He stops and thinks of John sprawled below him, trying to decide if he wants to take Daddy from the front or from behind. He settles with Daddy on his back, legs open, moaning soft encouragements.
Greg's face turned an impressive shade of red. He could feel the baby start to tremble against him, and when he ran a hand up Sherlock's back, gritted his teeth when Sherlock winced and gasped. Greg lightened his touch and put kisses onto his nose in apology.
Mycroft took Jawn's hands and sat him up, then smiled when the tiny little thing wrapped his arms around his waist and snuggled his face into his belly. "We're going to have a midnight snack," Mycroft sighed, petting Jawn's hair. "Would you like to join us?"
"The only bit of your clothing you're changing is your nappy." Mycroft moved across the room and pulled the supplies from beneath the changing table.
Sherlock’s bottom lip stuck out, and just when Mycroft thought he was in for another squall of a tantrum, his little brother surprised both of them by putting his green crayon on the table and pushing it over to Jawn. “…P’ease?”
Sherlock craned his neck to peer into it again, then made a slow, deliberate reach and came out with a miniature bottle of scented bubbles. He held it up for his brother to see and made a small noise around his thumb; “Hm?”
"Sure you can..." The pair reached the bottom of the stairs, and Greg waited until Sherlock's feet were firmly on the bottom landing before reaching back and tickling his belly. "...If you think your tummy's big enough to handle it."
Well, they were most certainly not getting adult forks. Mycroft was about to say one thing he’d never in a million years thought he’d ever say (again, on a day full of first-time-ever’s…): “Just use your fingers.”
“You an’ My’coff?” Jawn spooned himself against Mycroft’s side, snuggling in with a stuffed dinosaur, puppy, and frog.
Greg threw back the blankets and made a face at how cold the room was. Then he stood up and reached for Sherlock; "C'mon, muffin. No one wants a soggy bottom."
Sherlock's bottom lip poked out farther as he mirrored Jawn and snuggled up to Mycroft's other side. "I don'd," he whispered, making sure to hide his face.
Sherlock mumbles around his fingers, gently rubbing his chin on the tiny ball of quills snuggled there.
Greg stared at him for a moment, then started to laugh while he tried to lower his heart rate. "Christ, yeah...I mean, yeah, just a bit, lad." He picked up Sherlock's bottle from the floor where it had fallen; "What are you doing back down here? Where's your brother?"
’ Mycroft thought. He strode over to the pair, fully anticipating the moment when Sherlock would burst into tears (and he couldn’t really blame him this time; that jab had looked hard from all the way across the room!), when the overgrown tyke surprised both of them by dissolving in huge, gut-busting belly laughs. “ ‘gain! ‘gain!” he chanted, moving his hands out of the way and Jawn, grinning like the Joker in a pack of cards, poked him again.
"Hello, sweet boy." Mycroft kissed the top of Sherlock's head. "That sounds like a wonderful idea. Go and finish your snack, please."
"He glowed, did he?" Greg grinned and stood back up, unfolding one of their big, puffy adult nappies that he'd grown so fond of. Sherlock sat back as well, causing a mass of sleep-mussed curls to fall over his eyes. "That reminds me of another bunny we knew. Lay down for Greg, muffin."
"Chocolate will help? What am I talking about; a'course it will." Greg put their bowls on the counter, then walked Sherlock over to the pantry ans swung the door open; "Ta'daaaa!"
Mycroft undid the snaps of Sherlock's onesie and carefully rucked the whole thing up under his arm pits.
“My turn, my turn! My'coff, off p'ease!” Jawn tipped his soapy head out reach. “I dun’ wanna c’ean a’ kitchen!”
Sherlock squeaked, bit his lip, and blushed. Thankfully John had self discipline or he would have taken Sherlock Holmes right there on the couch.
Jawn stared at him with doe eyes. The swat hadn’t hurt, not really...but it had been surprising, and suddenly he could feel his own eyes watering.
"A plastic one," Mycroft reminded him, and looked back down at Sherlock: the overgrown tyke had pretty much fallen back to sleep, his breathing having grown slow and shallow. His cup was barely dangling from his slack lips.
Jawn walked to the doorway of the sitting room and stared down at the little detective. “Yea. He’s not a big boy like us.”
"I know, I know!...I careful! I ca' do it!" Sherlock lifted Jawn bridal style, hugging him close, and carried him the few steps the crib.
He hugged his arm around his torso, feeling the tenderness at his side, underneath his fingertips, and made his way to the stairs. He went to step down on the first one and, for a split second, he hesitated and the clear phrase "no'd a'yyowed" flitted through his head.
Greg carried him over, and Sherlock leaned down to grab his fuzzy yellow Pooh blanket and a stuffed bunny that lived at Mycroft's house, since both Bumble and Gladstone were back home at the flat.
"Shud'dup." Greg tried valiantly to brush more grass away from Sherlock's nethers, but it was simply a lost cause.
"Only because you have no patience." Mycroft frowned as his fingertips brushed over something that felt hard, crusty...almost like a scab. But, seeing as Sherlock wasn't immediately reacting to it, he rubbed at it a little more, and was disturbed to see the foam around it turn pink.
When he finally entered, Sherlock was cuddled in at Greg's side in a nest of his blankets and his bunny, looking half-asleep while he suckled on his cup.
Mycroft shook his head; “No, don’t ‘My’coff’ me…you knew what you were doing was a no-no.” He stooped and reached into the tub to find the plug, pulled it out, then reached for an increasingly worried little detective and lifted him out, as well.
"Th'o yum'ee, th'o yum'ee!" Sherlock did a wiggle dance in his seat and accepted another bite of soup drenched sandwich. "Peanu'd bi'de!" Sherlock shoved Peanut at Greg's spoon, nearly coating the spotty elephant in soup.
“Come here Pet.” John said softly, putting his cup on the table and tipping his head. Sherlock whimpered at him. “I know Love. Come on.” Without further invitation he bounded over the coffee table, barely missing the full mug of tea, and was in John’s lap in two strides. He buried his face in Daddy’s shoulder and gripped two handfuls of his jumper. Daddy stroked him and murmured nonsense into his curls.
Greg caught his wrist before he could rub over those stitches. "I know, but it needs it, muffin," he said, and kissed Sherlock's fingers.
John just shook his head again; he refused to be drawn into an argument. He walked into the kitchen. “Tea?”
