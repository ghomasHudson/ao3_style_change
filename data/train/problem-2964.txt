took a couple more shots from a tequila bottle he bought on a whim about a month back. Dean grinned as the alcohol flowed through him. He was
, and he has to stop himself from laughing at every dumb joke aimed at twelve-year-olds. He glances over at Cas at one point, and Cas is
"I think you're having a panic attack," Cas replied softly.
Dean walks over, still smiling. “Dude, you guys are awesome! The crowd was into it the
Having no time for Cas has nearly destroyed Dean. But he can do it. For his kid. Dean tried to be rude to Cas, so it would hurt less to keep ignoring him. It didn’t work. Cas is…Cas is so
. Of course, Dean never tells Cas this. Whenever Cas asks if his piano playing bothers Dean, Dean just says no. Dean’s always wanted to tell Cas he thinks he’s amazing at the piano, but he hasn’t had the chance. He’s not the best at words. But Cas seems to understand this by now, which is usually fine—great even—but it’s not great when Dean has things to say and can’t summon the courage to say them. And the longer time goes on, the more awkward Dean feels about mentioning Cas’ piano playing.
"With what?" Cas asked. He asked it so innocently as if this whole thing wasn't eating Dean alive.
“Yeah, you could say that again,” Dean agrees.
Castiel leans closer. "Dean, what's wrong?"
Dean reluctantly meets Cas’ gaze. “What.”
Another awkward silence fills the air again. Castiel goes back to tracing the table. Smelling all the food surrounding them is making him even hungrier. It feels like ten years have passed.
Cas shakes his head. "You're just saying that."
Castiel was next to me in seconds. He put a hand to my chest. "It's a curse."
Dean laughed. It was all so stupid. Sam was safe now. Sam
left and not Cas'.
They went through an old town, and Cas found a pharmacy that was practically untouched. He got supplies that would last him months. He was very happy that day.
There’s a couple more steps, and the sound of clothes rustling. Dean feels body heat next to him. An arm grips onto his shoulder.
Cas? Well, one of his problems was Cas. He could start with the other.
Jack said he was going to build a car with his LEGOs, so he can drive like me. I won’t pretend that I didn’t tear up when he said that. Besides, Cas is gone since it’s his turn to get groceries while I watch Jack, so no one was around to see me get emotional over LEGOs.
Dean summoned the courage to open his eyes. Cas was still cradling his face. His blue eyes stared worriedly into Dean's.
Silence.
Castiel stops. There’s no way Dean is actually here. Is this just someone who looks like Dean? Castiel really wishes he had glasses now.
He looks up at the beams on the ceiling, struggling to swallow the blood in his mouth. He wishes this isn't the last thing he'll see before he dies. He always knew this day would come, but he didn't want it to be today. There are so many things he still wants to do.
"I don't know," Dean said then passed out.
"Dean." It was quiet and uncertain.
"You're a mess," Dean growls, letting go of him.
Dean frowns and stares. "Are you high again?"
Ah, that explains a lot. “That makes sense, seeing he’s a lawyer.”
"What are you doing?" Dean rushes over to him, a glass of water in his hand.
"Why are
“Dean,” Castiel interrupts. “You need to tell Sam.”
“Oh, so he was listening this whole time?” Sam teases.
"Are you drunk again?"
Dean looked away. His adrenaline picked up. Why did he like that Cas thought about him? He shouldn't. Besides, Cas shouldn't be worrying about someone like him.
"I worry about you."
Oh, boy. Dean is so in love with him. Dean grins. “Wait, I have presents for you.”
Castiel stares. “You haven’t heard me play. I could be terrible.”
"Are you okay?" Cas asked.
do you see?” Cas asks, snapping Dean back to the present.
, his drunken mind figured.
“Oh, so this Charlie is smart then.”
The angel blushed.
"Your food will be there soon," Dean interrupts then hangs up.
better.” When Dean finally reaches him, he pulls Castiel into a hug.
Dean rolled his eyes, his arms still firmly crossed over his chest.
As Castiel walks back outside, he finally feels as if he’s taking a step in the right direction. Maybe he’s finally getting his life together.
The droning of the movie drowned out his thoughts. But he still wanted to forget. He wanted another drink. Maybe Cas forgot their little deal. Dean peeked his eyes open in hopes of trying to sneakily snatch the whiskey back but was surprised to see Cas staring at him. Dean didn't know what to say, and he was too tired to try and come up with something, so they both stared at each other. The alcohol was really starting to take effect. Dean yawned.
“You’ve told him about me?” Cas asked.
“Bother with what?”
“I think Dean and I need to talk,” Cas said.
“But this is Cas we’re talking about. He’s come back from The Empty before and—”
Cas’ lips parted in a gasp. For a long moment they just stared at each other and there was no doubt in Dean’s mind that they were both marveling at being together. Because despite everything that had occurred, the whole of it still felt like a dream. There was no looming threat. there was no danger to either of their lives. They could just be.
It was a honey crumb muffin and it looked delicious.
Dean didn’t regret it. He just didn’t know if he wanted to stay that way or if Jack would give him the option to return to his old self. In the end, he knew it didn’t matter as long as Cas was alive and as long as he was at Dean’s side.
“Cas, you didn’t have to,” Dean said at once.
“But, you didn’t know me…”
Things were different and yet the same. There were still things to hunt and people to help. The Impala was always ready to go and if there was one place where Dean felt happy it was driving his Baby with his music on and his brother at his side. But even then, when his eyes locked on the rearview mirror, there was an angel missing in his backseat and that never failed to make his chest ache.
It turned out that Claire didn’t need as much help as she thought, so because Claire demanded that Cas hang back, Dean stayed with him. Dean felt a little weird doing so when he had all the angel mojo at his disposal, but Cas pointed out that Dean didn’t want Claire to know about it anyway. Either way, they were a call away and Dean could fly them in if there was any real danger. In the end, he and Cas weren’t needed and it made Dean think.
Cas’ eyes narrowed and his head tilted slightly. “I am. And if you have a problem with that, I’m sure that I could find someone else to enjoy that apple pie because if—”
“So, where is all this stuff going?” Dean asked.
Cas ducked his head bashfully, but Dean nudged him and got a smile sent his way for his trouble.
“Like I guess I understand because I keep making you pies, but I haven’t even been baking lately and I’m trying to, you know, handle things and yet you’re still helping me and you came today and…”
Jack rounded the table and he pulled out the chair next to Dean. He sat down slowly.
Pink tinged Cas’ cheeks. It was almost subtle, but Dean could see it and it was adorable. He was adorable.
Dean pulled harder and his elbows were out, covered in black goo but out and Cas was still in his grasp.
“I want to go back to being human,” Dean said.
“They took care of the ghost. But, they wanted to let us know there’s a pie fest tomorrow.”
“Dean, I’m here now,” Cas said. “I will never regret saving you, as I am sure you don’t regret this.” Cas waved a hand at Dean’s wings.
“But I know it is possible,” Jack added. His hand reached out to grab Dean’s.
Cas saved him.
Cas hummed and he talked to his plants. He spent a long time checking on all of his plants, attentive in a way that Dean had never known anyone to be with plants.
They shared another quick kiss. Dean had never expected to experience a relationship the way that it was with Cas. The ease that came with it that told Dean he was exactly where he should be. They had gone on a few dates since Cas’ return. Out to eat, or to the movies, bowling, and once — while Dean could still fly them places — Dean had taken Cas out to the beach. And those things were fun and doing them with Cas was even better, especially when he got to introduce Cas to something new.
For some reason they didn’t tell Claire about Dean being an angel, but she did have a long conversation with Cas and afterwards when she hugged Dean afterwards, Claire muttered how happy she was that they were together.
He was aware that he didn’t know all, but the comprehension of himself and everything that he’d ever experienced in his life came with a deep awareness of his failings and his mistakes and how none of that mattered in comparison to knowing that his intentions had always been good and that few things had been under his control. It all settled on him at once. Understanding that Cas had always loved him and that Dean’s very soul had been pulled towards the angel from the first moment he laid eyes on him. There was also a lot more about his parents and Sam and the universe at large.
“Do you...do you want to see them?” Cas asked. He looked bashful, but excited.
The money had been sitting in the bank for years. It gave Cas options.
Dean let his eyes close and he could see Cas with his tears and the way that he had kept his eyes so fixed on him.
Dean was suddenly hit with the pang of knowing that he had never been able to see Cas’ wings and that Cas no longer had them.
“Everyone needs to take a breath sometimes, Cas.”

“I have no idea. Maybe,” Castiel said with the confused tilt of his head that meant he didn’t understand what Dean was talking about.
Cas pushed himself off the wall and walked over to Dean. "Dean...you've been distracted all night."
"You won't lose me, Dean. I promise."
Cas nods. It takes so much effort to even move right now.
"Mmhmm," Dean lies again. But he knows Cas remembers. The angel has a knack for remembering Sam's weird healthy food orders.
“She didn’t make it,” I say.
Castiel leans into Dean’s touch and rests his head on Dean’s shoulder. They watch a few more movies, and Castiel knows he has to head to his apartment soon, because he keeps dozing off, but he can’t bring it in himself to leave.
Garth shrugs nonchalantly and pulls a set of keys out of his pants pocket. “Anyway, that’s been dealt with. Police finished cleaning up on Tuesday.”
Dean sighs. "Yeah, yeah." He opens his eyes and looks at Cas again. Cas is staring at him. Dean smiles. "What?"
"Yes, Dean," Cas answered, the annoyance in his voice was strong. "I wouldn't bother you otherwise."
Dean wanted to tell Cas that he and Sam had had a fight. And that was the reason why Dean had been so irresponsible. So stupid. So inconsiderate. But they were all excuses in the end, and trying to make thoughts into words seemed impossible at the moment.
Every morning Castiel wakes up with that anger-sad feeling. He’s still mad at Dean for being rude and cutting him off like this, but he’s sad that it’s over. And that it ended like
in love with Dean after all. He'd literally do this for no one else.
Castiel grabs Dean’s jacket. It’s warm and smells like Dean. “Thank you, Dean.”
It stands there sadly.
Cas beams. “Thank you, Dean. It’s very thoughtful. I desperately need this.”
“Noted,” Cas says.
"I pushed you away a long time ago. And then I lost you to whatever high you were on." Dean looks away and swallows before returning his gaze to Cas'. "I haven't seen my best friend in years."
Someone opens the door to the apartment complex and walks out. Dean doesn’t even care. He just hopes whoever it is just ignores him. He keeps his face in his hands. Dean hears the door close and footsteps approach. They stop when they reach him.
"Oh." Castiel knew he was missing something big, but he didn't know
“Merry Christmas,” Dean replies. “This is, uh, this is Castiel.”
“Dean, wait.”
Dean felt his cheeks heat up. He couldn't tell if he was embarrassed that Cas noticed, or if he was even more turned on that Cas didn't seem to mind. He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Can we go back inside?"
The kiss stays soft, but Dean shifts closer and moves one of his hands through Cas' hair. Cas is running out of air and reluctantly pulls away. His heart his pounding, and he can't stop smiling. He can feel Dean's eyes on him, and he blushes and looks up.
have sex with you." His eyes fly back to Cas'. "Don't get me wrong, I do, believe me, but...I want to date you." The phrase feels so foreign. Dean never imagined dating someone. Let alone the one person he's wanted for so long.
April turns to him and smiles shyly. “I’m glad you don’t think I am.”
"Yeah, sorry, man."
Dean grins. “Thank me after you’ve tried it.”
“Just this once,” I growl and shove past Cas and Sam down the stairs.
Dean smiles and looks down at their hands. "I don't want to
“Dude, I’m serious! You have to be the best damn piano player in the world.”
Someone is taking Jack from me. I wake up with a startled jerk and automatically reach out to take my kid back. I didn’t realize I feel asleep.
Castiel frowns. Does that sound sober? He rereads it. No typos, so it should be good. He stares at the price spot. How much should he ask for it? A thousand? Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Just as long as it’s gone. He types in $1000 and posts it.
Castiel grins and looks down at the music. “Thank you…again.”
“…I suppose it isn’t.”
. Maybe Castiel should have reached out to Dean after he canceled dinners. But then he gets angry again before the sadness can really take hold. He’s a confused mess, and he’s trying to avoid the word heartbroken, but the longer he goes without seeing Dean, the more it feels like his heart is breaking.
Dean puts his phone in his pocket and looks at Cas. “So,” he begins, “where are we going?”
He grabbed my arms and unfolded them from my chest and held my hands. He was warm, and it took all my willpower to stop me from interlacing our fingers.
She smiles. “It’s me April Greene.”
Dean's gaze softened as he looked at Castiel. "Yeah." He held out his hand. Castiel took it. "Want to make up for lost time?"
I look down. “Look, Cas—”
Dean is getting antsy. When he gets like this, it means he needs to go out. He used to go try and pick up some girl and spend the night doing that…but he hasn't done that in some time. In a long time. There are...reasons for that, which Dean ignores. So, he ends up going into town and getting a pricey bottle of whiskey and ingredients for brownies. He considered making pie, but it'd be too complicated. Especially if he is planning on getting as drunk as he's hoping to.
"No, Dean," Cas said still glaring at him. "You were stabbed. If I hadn't gotten there when I did, you'd be dead."
Cas attempts to wipe it away, but misses it completely.
Dean nods. "Good." But his features remain hard.
Dean needed to be closer to Cas. His hands scrambled forward, and he gripped onto the angel's shirt with closed fists. Tears prickled his eyes, and Dean closed them. He focused on Cas' hands on his face. The grip he had on the angel's shirt. He forced himself to unclench his hands, so his open palms were pressed against Cas' chest.
Cas blushes and ducks his head.
“I hope I can meet them in-person one day.”
"You just noticed?" Cas asks sweetly, slowly dragging his eyes up to Dean's.
Then he realizes it's snowing. Cas smiles. He loves the snow. It's so beautiful. He raises his hand up to let some snowflakes fall into his open palm.
Embarrassment flashed through Dean's chest, and he blushed. "Yeah, I'm fine," he quickly answered, hoping the moment would just end. Then he realized how close they were. Cas' face was inches from his. Dean could make out his pores. He also noticed Cas' eyes had little streaks of light blue mixed in them. His lips also looked a lot softer this close.
"Because I'll have you back," Dean says quietly.
“What?”
“Thank you.” Cas grins at the floor. “I know I keep saying it, but…well, no one’s come to one of my concerts before.”
"What?"
“Hey,” Castiel repeats.
“Yeah, okay.” Dean quickly pushes the blanket away and stands up, looking at Castiel with wide eyes.
Dean nudges one of Castiel’s feet with his one of his own. “Well, yeah. I couldn’t miss the concert!”
"I'm going to kiss you now."
if she broke his heart.
Cas stared at him. "Dean..." It was gentle and soft, and the way Cas said it like it was a sacred word sent a chill up Dean's spine.
"Mmm."
"You got drunk again."
Lisa flashes him one last smile before turning away and leaving. Is she wearing tighter clothes than normal? It really looks like she is. Dean blinks back to the present and grins. Tonight’s gonna be a good night.
knows he’s bi.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean laughed.
Dean had to Google what to wear at a concert, and why the fuck is it so fancy? Dean hates dressing up. But whatever. He has one good suit at least. He never uses it anyway, so any reason to wear it is a good one. Dean reties his tie for the hundredth time. He hates suits. They remind him of courtrooms. He smooths down the tie and glances at his watch. Well, it’s now or never. He takes in a deep breath before grabbing the ticket he printed off along with his keys from the counter.
"You always say that when you're not."
He used to shove down those thoughts and feelings like they were something toxic. But, over time, he stopped doing that. He's not exactly sure why. Maybe he's just getting more comfortable with himself. Maybe he just doesn't care enough to push them away. Maybe he's just getting old. Maybe it's all of those things. Dean doesn't really know. And he doesn't really care.
Cas lifts his head up from where it was resting against the wall. "I don't want to intrude."
me to challenge him.
"Dean." A soft hand grabbed one of Dean's. Dean had been gripping onto the steering wheel so tight that his knuckles had turned white. He hadn't even realized he'd been holding it. Dean let Cas take one of his hands off the wheel. The angel held Dean's hand in both of his own. "You're upset about something."
Seeing Cas absolutely in-arms about this is making Dean feel tons better. He wasn’t exactly sure if all his anger towards Lisa was justified. Dean is a shitty guy, so maybe he deserved what Lisa did to him, but…it just seemed
Dean suddenly clears his throat and quickly pours a bowl for Castiel without looking him in the eyes.
Dean rolls his eyes, but he’s still smiling. “Since I can talk to you now,” he begins with a cheeky grin, “what are you going to buy today?”
. Like, a nice long sleeve sweater and cuffed jeans outfit.
They both grin at each other, and Dean has to look away. Cas is looking at him like he just saved the world or some shit.
And if it isn’t the food, then it’s himself.
Don’t get him wrong, Castiel likes his new apartment. It’s in a town he likes, and it’s
"Ok."
The grin stays on his face until he sits back down in the back office. Fuck. Cas. His heart sinks down to the floor. He’s going to have to cancel dinner. He shouldn’t really be
Castiel nods. “Yes, of course.”
"Because I know both of you, and I know you always find your way back to each other."
He didn't want to be alone. Not after that dream. It was something he was very ashamed of. He had that buried even further down than the thoughts he had about Cas. Or so he'd thought. Dreaming about it tonight only moved it to the forefront of his mind. He needed to think of something else.
Castiel raced after him. He was not letting this go. Not now. He had to know how Dean felt. The hopeful feeling was dangerously become more desperate. Castiel caught up to him and grabbed his shoulder. Dean stopped to look at him.
Realizing he's been staring into Cas' eyes for just a little too long, Dean clears his throat. "Anyway, I, uh, just wanted to show you this."
Cas frowned. "We should go back inside."
Nightly dinners with Dean return, and Castiel has never been happier. Getting to come back from work to be with Dean makes him feel lighter. Whenever something unexpected happens during his day, it’s less of a bad thing and more of a story he’ll get to tell Dean later. And, instead of just dinner with Dean, they watch movies, too. Castiel has never seen
Sam coughed loudly.
Dean wanted him to be more, but it was enough for the moment, especially when he got a close look at Cas and realized that what Castiel really needed was to stop worrying and stop stressing.
Dean was actually over at Cas’ house on a Friday afternoon when Cas got the call that his offer had been accepted. Dean insisted on getting a bottle of champagne to celebrate even though it meant that he had to drive to the nearest liquor store to pick it up first because Cas just didn’t have any on hand. Castiel’s smile didn’t fade from his lips for the rest of the night. He told Dean all of his ideas. How he wanted to set up the kitchen and the display counters and the kind of mixers and ovens that he’d been researching.
Cas frowned at him. “I know some of it already,” Cas said. “But not all. Where is Jack?”
Dean dropped his head into his hands. None of it was right. Jack couldn’t do anything and he was God. If Jack couldn’t bring him back there was no hope and no way to imagine that it could ever happen at all. His face was wet. Dean had cried for Cas so often since the day he was taken that as he wiped them away angrily, he was well aware that they would not be the last tears.
They filled in Sam and Eileen. There were questions and Dean could tell when Sam was holding back anger or when he was filled with sorrow that was aimed at Dean and at everything that he’d gone through the last few months.
The way that Dean had landed had kept them connected but had banged up his left knee on the table hard, but it was his wings that had done the damage of throwing everything off the table. They had smashed other things too. All of it had made a great deal of noise, so Dean wasn’t surprised when a half-dressed Sam with a gun in hand showed up.
Jack jumped back from the chair and it toppled to the ground. “You think I don’t know,” Jack said.
Dean didn’t see himself like Cas did. He understood himself and the things he had done and the choices he made. He could connect more dots to fully comprehend that there was more driving him than ego or anger or believing he could never have more than that life John Winchester had put him on.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean said.
Dean told her what he could. He held her when she cried and tried not to also break down into tears. Since then, Claire didn’t bring Cas up. She called when she needed help whether that be because what she was hunting and it was too much for her or because she needed them to look something up for her at the bunker. Dean had only seen her once since and it hadn’t been for long.
“Thanks,” Dean said and didn’t know if he meant it.
When Sam found him and handed him a mug of black coffee, his brother just lifted an eyebrow.
It had been a while since Dean had been with a guy. Before Lisa there had been a string of one night stands mostly of the female variety but there had been a guy or two in the mix. In all actuality, Dean had never dated a man. He’d never done the relationship thing with a guy. Looking at Castiel and his pink cheeks, the way that his blue eyes glittered, and how his lips lifted up at the edges as he opened his oven.
He was trying to be patient. Cas seemed excited about this, and Dean wasn't going to let how he was feeling get in the way of Cas' good time.
He turns back to get more mix, but Cas is standing right there. Dean's breath catches in his throat. They're really close. They're so close it would take Dean barely any effort at all to lean forward and... Dean snaps his eyes up from staring at Cas' lips.
He steps closer to Cas and gently wipes the batter from his cheek. Cas' skin is soft, and Dean wants to feel more. But he swallows and pushes that thought aside. He should've gone to a hookup tonight. Dean is about to step back, but is surprised to see Cas staring at him.
drunk yet, but he left without any further resistance. Dean was glad he'd stashed more alcohol in Baby. He glanced around the parking lot, and after seeing no one,
That didn't seem right. Dean frowned. "From alcohol poisoning? I don't even think I could drink enough alcohol to kill me."
“I’m pregnant.”
. That his gentle touch is something Dean never thought he'd feel. That he wants more. He wants Cas forever. And only Cas.
Castiel frowns. “I’m only familiar with roleplay in the sexual sense.”
about his life. “So, what? You sleep with me and let him have my leftovers?” He knows what he says is fucked up, but he’s having a bit of a crisis right now. Actually, a really big crisis.
. Breaking your hand isn’t like breaking your arm or your leg. Hands are complicated. There are a lot of little bones in there. When Castiel went to the doctor, he thought he’d just get a cast, and he’d be done. But no. He had to get fucking surgery. He had to wait a whole week to get it, too. They had to rebreak the bones and everything to align them properly. Castiel was a total anxious mess the night before his surgery and—unwisely—got very drunk to cope with that anxiety.
"No," Cas answered. "Not really."
Dean scoffs. So she lied. She’s a liar. “Then whose is it?” Dean clenches his hands into fists to stop them from trembling.
. He can’t just do this! He can’t just cut Castiel off after months of seeing each other every day. It’s not Dean’s fault he doesn’t know Castiel is in love with him, but even on a friendship level, this is harsh. What an asshole.
But there is no next time. They must’ve broken up or something.
"I really like you."
worth the money after all.
“I mean, what is marriage? Is it running around rooftops in Paris? I don’t think so, no. It’s pushing a cart around the Home Depot.” -Nathan Ford
," the angel growled. It was most definitely cute.
"It's like 3am, why are you outside?" Dean asks harshly.
“Oh…well,” Castiel begins uncertainly, “I haven’t played in almost a month since I broke my hand, so—”
"...No. Then what?"
I blink and look up. Cas is lifting Jack into his arms. The kid is still out like a light. It’s adorable.
There had always been feelings when it came to Cas. Dean wasn't exactly sure when they had started. But one day, being with Cas wasn't the same as being with Sam or Bobby. He could usually shove these feelings aside. Besides, he was always busy. There was no time to think about things that would never happen. But sometimes his mind would wander before he fell asleep. At first, he used to drink to keep these thoughts away, but he doesn't anymore. Now these thoughts are like a safe haven. Something he can wish for before sleeping.
Dean grabbed some clothes from his bag. "I'm gonna change. Are you staying?"
"Cas?" Dread settled in my chest.
"Happy."
Dean turns from his spot near the thermostat. "Keep it for now. I have my flannel."
Lisa grins. “I’m okay. You look good.” Dean can’t ignore how she slowly drags her eyes down his body. You can’t even make out his body in this uniform. She is
How the hell did this happen? How did I get everything I ever wanted?
"I love you," Dean said.
Castiel smiles. “Thank you, Dean.” He looks at the piano once more. “And thank you for helping me bring it in.”
“I want to be with
I wince as I continue to stare down at the sink. “Cas, I’m
"We're on our way back," Dean lies and grabs Cas' hand, leading him back to the car.
Something was definitely wrong. But Castiel didn't know what it was, or what to say to help Dean. So he just stood there. Uselessly. And watched Dean as rain pattered on the overhang above them, the soft music drifted between them. The gas finished filling up, and Dean took the fuel pump and replaced it.
“Please.”
Dean crosses his arms and glares. “What isn’t true?”
Castiel grins. “Yes, I would.”
He refuses to answer. "Why are you asking me these questions, Dean?" Castiel asks instead.
Castiel answers, "I'm not hungry." Another lie. The only other food he's eaten today was a Nature Valley bar at lunch. He's never buying Nature Valley again. Those bars basically crumble to dust before you can even bring them to your mouth.
Castiel raises his eyebrows and glances at the photo again. “Wow. That’s amazing.”
“Besides,” Garth says and gestures for Castiel to follow him. “We don’t do a lot of performances anyway. Like, right now we’re practicing for Christmas.”
"I really like you, too."
“By yourself?”
Dean nodded, finding himself unable to speak with Cas right next to him. He grabbed the motel keys from the table and opened the door. Did he leave the bathroom light on? Dean spun around and nearly hit Cas. They were only a few inches apart.
"Can I?"
"Sorry."
Cas isn't sure how to take this, but he needs Dean to know he's not in this just for the...physical benefits. "Friends don't kiss."
to smile.
"Cas?"
. He isn’t gone.
Dean is—or
Dean immediately grinned at Cas and raised his eyebrows, trying to hide just how jealous he was. If he wasn't playful, Cas would definitely suspect something.
I set Jack’s car on top of the LEGO container, which is now next to the rest of his toys. Spoiled kid. I never had this many toys. Ever. I can’t help but smile. I guess I’m doing something right if his childhood is nothing like mine.
Dean barely manages to find his voice to ask, "What are you doing?"
, but… I’m not letting it slide when the world is ending, and it’s because of that thing.
I’m even more confused. “The LEGOs?”
So here I am, sitting against the living room wall, surrounded by hundreds of LEGOS with Jack asleep on my lap.
“Okay.”
“Yes, I’d love to.”
Cas hates everything. It feels like he's dying. Maybe he is. Good.
“It’s nice to finally put a face to your name,” Mary says.
“Hey, Cas,” a voice to his right calls. It belongs to Dean Winchester.
Cas smiles brightly and pulls Dean closer. They kiss. Again and again and again.
“Well, I’m here.”
"I left the bathroom light on," Dean said and brushed past Cas.
Dean leads them outside, and Castiel follows him to the Impala. He gets inside the passenger side. Dean turns the car on, and they start driving. Castiel feels himself relaxing. Being next to Dean back in the Impala is so familiar. And safe. He glances out the window. The snow is thick and heavy.
"Dean," Cas repeated. Dean finally looked at Cas. Dean's eyes sparkled with tears. "What happened?" Cas leaned forward in alarm, his hold on Dean's hand tightened.
And then I realize how close we are. We’re still basically hugging. We have our arms wrapped around each other, but Cas has pulled back just enough to look at me. This is…this is intimate in a weird, romantic way. Well, it’s not
"Are you ok?" he asked.
Castiel shook his head.
. Dean looks up at his face with wide eyes, but Cas is watching the movie. Dean sits back in his seat and tries not to have a heart attack. He has no idea what happens the rest of the movie; he’s too overwhelmed with the fact that he’s holding Cas’ fucking hand.
Dean smiles. “Awesome! I knew you would.”
He’s trembling, and I realize he’s crying. “Whoa, hey,” I say softly and pull back. He ducks his face from me, so I gently lift his chin to look up at me. “You’re the best person he can have. You know that, right?”
Garth holds up his hands. “Whoa, whoa. Dude, take all the time you need. The orchestra isn’t going anywhere.”
Dean takes it and stares at the empty floor in front of them. "This is the best day ever," Dean decides. He takes a drink and hands the bottle back to Cas.
." Dean doesn't look Castiel in the eye.
Dean groans again.
“Well, its, uh…roleplay.”
"Me either." That caught Dean's attention. "I've always
“Thanks,” Dean says.
The moment Lisa returned, Dean knew whatever he had with Cas was over. He wasn’t about to leave Lisa high and dry with
“Don’t wake him,” Cas whispers.
“I don’t know an April.”
Cas looks around the room while he tries to get his body to wake up faster. He's in one of the many spare rooms they have in the bunker. It's bare except for the bed and the desk with a lamp next to him. The desk chair is facing the bed. Dean had been sitting there watching him. Cas knows Dean finds it creepy whenever
“Dean,” Castiel chides. “Eat your food first. Remember?”
"Yes," Cas repeats.
But the reality of Dean leaving really hit Castiel after one rehearsal. Everyone was talking about their friends and families and who was going to be at the concert. Castiel has no one. Dean would’ve been the only person to come see him. When people asked Castiel who would come for him, he made up some story about his mother being sick, and that he’s visiting his family after the concert.
No, no,
In that moment, it had made Dean smile. He could picture Cas' excited expression. He didn't think he'd actually have time to take Cas there, but they finished their hunt early. Dean volunteered to get dinner and told Cas to come along.
“Dean,” Kelly rasps. “Take your shirt off.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Shut up. Here he is.” Dean scoots closer and tilts the phone, so they’re both in frame.
cut into his expenses.
But Cas loves Dean. Or is in love with him. He doesn't really know. That feeling got all mixed up with the drugs, so he can't really tell anymore. All he knows is that Dean is still everything to him. Cas is willing to die for him. He craves moments alone with Dean, and enjoys every interaction they have together. But, again, it could just be the drugs.
"You don't need to apologize, Dean." A pause. "Are you okay?"
“No, you are not.”
Dean points at Castiel with his spoon. “If I make you dinners, will you do my taxes for free?”
"Dean, what's going on?"
"Oh, uh, I'm good...thanks," Cas answered.
He rapidly blinks back tears. “When I come back, I want you
Dean looks up, and his shoulders slump. “Yeah, but I wanted to.”
"Okay, then," I muttered through chattering teeth.
Everything.
“Shut up.”
Cas continues to smile at him. “You don’t look gross, Dean. Just human.” Cas squeezes Dean’s shoulder and shuts the bathroom door on the way out.
He looks up at Cas. Cas licks the whisk tentatively, his tongue darting across it. He stares thoughtfully before taking another taste. This time he licks the whisk slower.
Cas blinks up at him. "Are you alright?" Cas asks, his voice deep with sleep. Well, deeper than usual.
When the night of the concert rolls around, Castiel is excited, nervous, and dreading its ending. He wants to play. He’s practiced, and he can’t wait to perform with the orchestra in front of an audience. He hasn’t played in front of people in a while, so he’s a bit nervous. He’s also nervous he won’t be able to read the music, despite practicing it for months. Castiel can’t deny that he needs glasses, but he keeps pushing it off. But now he’s having trouble reading his music that’s just a foot away from his face. Castiel forces his nerves down. He has faith in the orchestra. He knows they’ll perform well even if he makes a few mistakes. But, even though he’s nervous, Castiel also doesn’t want the night to be over. Because then he’ll be alone. He’d seen Dean last night for dinner and a movie. His bags were packed, and he had wished Castiel good luck. Dean even sent a text this morning saying he knows Castiel will sound great at the concert. But it’s just not the same without Dean here. Castiel can’t dwell on this, though. It’s almost time for the concert.
“Of course, man. I mean, you broke your hand! Healing is more important than a few songs.”
Cas did as he was told. "How are you feeling?"
Dean's throat was tightening, and he was breathing in short, rapid gasps. Why couldn't he breathe? What was happening? The panic was only causing his throat to tighten more.
Dean looked away.
"You sound...really happy."
Dean gives Castiel a small smile. “Nice coat.”
"Wait, I'm not done," Dean protested. He lifted his arm in the direction of the bottle.
Dean swallowed and looked at the ceiling.
He's lying on top of his sheets, covered in sweat. He's finally doing it. He's finally getting sober. After what Dean said, Cas tried to stop using. It wasn't easy, and he had to slowly lower himself off the drugs, but today is his first day with nothing.
Dean’s car is old. But it’s far from falling apart. Dean has taken great care of his car, anyone can see that. In the three weeks Castiel has lived here, he hasn’t seen the car dirty once. Which is saying something since it’s spring time in South Dakota, which is basically winter 2.0. Slushy snow still covers the streets. It’s one of the few things Castiel doesn’t like about the town.
Castiel nods. “Yes, I would.”
Dean was suddenly very aware of how close they were. They were barely a foot apart. The Impala seemed to be shrinking around him, and the air became stale. "I need some air," Dean said, withdrawing his hand from Cas. He opened the car door and took a few desperate steps away. He breathed in deeply. He had to focus. He couldn't ruin this now. He couldn't let this one moment destroy his relationship with Cas.
Dean blinked and waited for the dizziness to pass before glaring. "What the fuck, Cas?"
“Yes. Exactly.” Cas continues to stare at Dean.
"Ok. I'll come with you."
We took Jack out to the store once. It took him all of five minutes to get sensory overload and have the worst breakdown of his life. So, uh, yeah, no more of that any time soon. He’ll have to learn someday, but, I mean, he’s still just a kid, so I’m sure it’s fine if we spoil him a little.
Cas slowly looked over Dean as if he was taking note of every inch of him to see what he could compliment. This was one of those things Cas did that would drive any girl crazy.
Dean stops in surprise.
But now Dean was too busy looking at how
“Yes, just—” Castiel huffs in frustration. “I can never cook
Cas laughs. "When am I
“I mean,” I begin, “you haven’t tried to kill him, so you’re clearly the better one here.”
He types a description on his phone. He sniffles as he does. He will
I don’t get a response. I look at the bed. Her form is still. I swallow down the lump in my throat and look back down at the baby. It’s still smiling at me.
"Tell Sam..." My voice faded, and I crossed my arms, still shivering. "Never mind. He knows," I quietly finished.
“Yeah, no problem.”
Cas tugs on him. “Let’s go inside.”
"Dean, please."
“Dungeon Master?”
Cas followed Dean as he walked up to Sam. "Let me heal you," the angel offered.
But Castiel pushes that aside. Dean returned just a week after he left the first time and took Castiel to dinner without an explanation. So now they're sitting across from each other in a booth at a diner Castiel has never been to. He can't really afford to eat out anywhere, but Castiel doesn't tell Dean. He can probably pay for this one meal if he doesn't eat a lot. The appetizers look affordable. Embarrassment and shame strike him much more deeply now, and he really cares what Dean thinks about him, so he doesn't want Dean knowing this will
"Sam hasn't contacted me."
He punches the wall.
"Dean!"
“You mean the
"Which one?" Dean's tone is short.
Dean look his time, he didn't want to ruin this. He wanted to remember every detail. He wanted to know what Cas liked, so he could do it again. Dean ran a hand through the angel's hair. He never wanted to forget the taste or the little noises Cas kept making or how soft his hair was.
“It smells amazing,” Castiel says the second he steps in.
Dean slid his hands up around Cas' neck and tugged him a little closer. "Cas, it's fine."
know what to do. As much as Dean hated the idea of Cas being with someone else, Dean wasn't just going to abandon him.
"Oh, wow. Thanks, Sammy."
Dean holds his hand out for Cas to return the whisk. Cas hands it back. Then Dean notices Cas got some of the batter on his face.
be happening. “But
"Why are you so sure?" Cas is feeling nothing but terrible. He wishes Dean isn't seeing him like this. The embarrassment is too much. He just wants to escape in some drugs to feel warm and numb again.
Okay. So maybe Cas
He didn't want be left alone here while he and Sam were at odds.
He’s already struggling with losing his grace. He never complains. But he still gets nightmares sometimes. Just the other day I found him crying in his garden. He didn’t see me, and I didn’t bring it up, but I know this isn’t easy for him. He’s being so strong for Jack, and it hurts me to know Cas isn’t okay. I know he’s never been okay. None of us have. But this—this is hitting him hard.
Castiel follows Dean into the hall and closes and locks his door. Dean waits for him before they go upstairs. Predictably, Dean is just above Castiel.
Dean kinda measures the things he puts into the mixing bowl, taking sips of his whiskey in between each item he adds. Once he finishes that, he turns on the mixer and starts mixing. The whisks easily plow through the chunky batter, blending it all perfectly. It's fun to watch, and Dean grins. He mixes longer than is probably necessary. The whiskey has definitely taken effect. He sets the bowl down.
Dean rolls his eyes. He finds Cas' naivety endearing most of the time. Cute even. But Dean doesn't call other men cute.
They stare at each other. Cas blushes and looks down.
They both smile. And Dean has that warm look in his eyes again. It seems as if there’s a candle lit behind his eyes, making them a brighter green. It’s too much, and Castiel has to look down.
," Dean said. He stared at Sam intently, hoping Sam would get the message that Dean would drop what he was doing if Sam needed him.
"We'll fix this, okay?" Dean says, pressing a hand on Cas' wound to stop some of the bleeding. "Just stay with me." Dean squeezes one of Cas' hands.
"Is this okay?" Cas asks.
Dean licks his lips nervously. “Yeah, well, I wouldn’t know. I never got to try.” He looks out the window and feels his cheeks heat up. Oh my god, he just admitted to Cas that he likes guys. He’s never told anyone that. Not even Sam.
“Jesus Christ—oh! I mean, uh, sorry.”
Castiel takes one more deep breath before tapping Naomi’s name. The phone rings once before she picks up. “Hello, Naomi,” Castiel says.
Things with Cas had been weird lately. Dean found himself using any chance he got to touch Cas, even if it was just stuff like touching the angel's sleeve or placing a hand on his shoulder. Sometimes, Cas would give Dean this
“No, that really is fucked up, though,” Dean says and then grins. “But! You know that means you’re really good at fucking, right?”
Cas' breath hitches. "Dean," he begins.
The waitress returns, and they both order.
Castiel finds he wants to spend as much time as he can with Dean to feel the good emotions, despite knowing he'll feel the bad ones, too. Especially right after Dean leaves. Castiel thinks loneliness is one of the worst feelings.
Cas put a hand on my shoulder, his eyes searching mine. He realized how bad I thought my condition was. "We can fix this," he promised.
I frown. “What?” I whisper.
"I like your boots," Cas finally said.
Dean grins. “Yeah, I do.”
. I am not letting this slip out of my grasp. Not this time. Never again. “Wait, hold on, you think I didn’t like that?”
“That’s completely different.”
Castiel laughs. “I’m not religious anymore, Dean.”
Cas gazes at the flowers for a moment. "I suppose we should get going now."
"Are you listening to me?"
“Thank you, Dean.”
Dean doesn't want to. He wants to save this soft, happy moment forever. Just a sweet, unplanned moment with him and his angel.
"Nothing," Castiel lies. "Why are you here, Dean?"
"What?" It sounded more annoyed than Dean meant it to be.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel greets as Dean locks his car and walks over.
“Fixing cars is cool,” Castiel agrees. “I think your car is cool.”
But, thankfully, Jack seems to get it out of his system while I clean up the kitchen. He says his new word every four seconds, and by the time Cas gets back home over two hours later, Jack’s asleep. He fell asleep in my arms as I’m sitting at the kitchen table, looking up new ways to make spaghetti. I hear Cas walk into the room and pause.
Cas stares at him firmly. “Yes. No one should treat you like that.”
Lisa shrugs. “I like him.”
“April?” he asks.
I sit up and yank the bedsheets off of me. I walk down the stairs and see Cas holding his blanket in a death grip. He’s yelling something in Enochian, and just like all the other times, it’s loud enough for the baby to hear, and he’s crying now.
"There are coats for sugar?"
Reassured, Dean opened the door, and he and Cas left the room.
"You're not getting much," Dean comments.
Cas suddenly pulled away, his cheeks red. "S-sorry I don't know what I'm doing."
He gripped the steering wheel angrily. This wouldn't be happening if he was normal. Why was he like this? He just had to like guys, too, huh? Fucking disgraceful. Dean bit his lip and focused on the pain. He was a man. Men didn't cry. And men didn't fall in love with other men. That's what Dad had said, right? The tears came back, and Dean bit his lip harder and tasted blood.
“Taking me here. I really enjoyed it.”
"Would it kill you to knock?" Dean asked while walking over to his duffel bag to grab some clothes. He sounded annoyed, but he was secretly glad Cas was here.
"Here," Dean said, taking a step closer to Cas. "Pretend I'm her."
“Hello. I’m Castiel,” Cas says.
When they finally return to the car over two hours later, Castiel says, “Dean, thank you.”
“But you…” Castiel stares. “I thought you were leaving today.”
“I appreciate that. Thank you.”
Of course not. Dean closed his eyes and angrily pressed his palms into his eyes. He wouldn't cry over this. But every day it felt more and more like when Sam left for Stanford. Maybe he was never coming back. The bed moved, and Dean looked over to see Cas sitting next to him.
“Dean,” Bobby calls, “we got a customer.”
“I’m Garth,” he says breathlessly once he reaches Castiel. “Wait, you
Last night Dean went to sleep in the same bed as Cas. Dean thought Cas wanted to sleep with him, not literally just sleep
"They don't feel cold to me." He looked up at me. "I can't find what's wrong with you to heal you."
Cas frowns in thought. He remembers being stabbed by an angel blade. He places his hand over his injury. He can't remember much after that. He knows he killed the angel who attacked him, but it all gets hazy.
—too much—for Dean. Besides, Sam is a lawyer with a wife and a fancy house in Vermont. Dean is an ex-con with an unplanned pregnancy. Sam would never, ever judge. But the guilt Dean would feel for getting help from his brother for his own actions would eat him alive. So Sam stays in the dark. For now at least. Until Dean can get his head above water.
. Dean doesn’t really mind the affect Cas has over him.
One thing led to another—the details are hazy—and they ended up fucking. Cas decided he likes that feeling a lot, too. In a way, it's almost more rewarding than a high. The effort leading up to orgasm and the following release is something no pill can replicate.
He sauntered into the bar and took shot after shot after shot until the bartender told him to go home. Dean told the bartender to fuck off, because he wasn't even
Cas tilted his head in confusion, but answered, "It's rare, but it can happen. Why do you ask?"
“Mornin’, sunshine,” Dean says.
Cas pulled his arms free, and Dean's back was cold as Cas stopped touching him and moved away. Dean rolled onto his back and opened his eyes. Cas was sitting next to him on his motel bed. And glaring.
“You know who. The guy you ditched me for. The one you’re in love with.”
Dean chuckles and looks over to him. "Yeah, I think so."
Sam and Cas both smile.
They both look at each other again. The guilt in Dean's eyes is so clear. Castiel stares. What's wrong with Dean? Why is he feeling this way? And why is he feeling it so strongly? There's movement to Castiel's left, and he glances at the waitress as she takes Dean's card.
I go into the next room, and the baby is in one of those circular mobility things with wheels for it to walk around in. The baby is staring at the wall and just
"That's...we can work with that. Now compliment me, uh, her."
"I'm fine," Dean quickly answered.
Dean takes the glass from Cas then places his free hand on Cas' forehead.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever.”
“Dean, I—it’s a lot to ask, I know, but
"Hey, uh, Cas, any word from Sam?" Dean prayed tentatively.
Dean grabs onto Cas as tightly as he can. He’s probably hurting him, but he doesn’t care. He buries his face into Cas’ shoulder and weeps. Cas rubs calming circles on Dean’s back and gently rocks them back and forth. Dean’s not sure how long they do this. Cas holds Dean even after he’s done crying.
"Dean!" Cas rushed to his side. Dean reached his arms up for Cas to help him up. Cas grabbed him.
weird, but it’s weird because I’m the only one to notice or really care, so—
Cas' hands cupped Dean's face. "Dean.
"Maybe we should slow down," Dean says breathlessly.
Cas' eyes narrowed in suspicion. That was also cute. Everything Cas did was kinda cute anyway, if Dean was being honest with himself.
“Ah, Castiel, how are you?”
Dean had seen the park on the drive there. He immediately thought of Cas. It's practically infested with flowers of all types and colors. Bees were merrily hopping from one flower to the next.
Dean grabs the front of his shirt and kisses him back. Cas is stiff in surprise at first, but soon his hands are cupping Dean's face. Dean pulls them closer.
But it was these moments when Cas had his leg up against Dean's or their hands would brush while searching for books that almost made Dean lose it. He could pick up any girl he wanted, but Cas drove him crazy with the slightest touch. It was fucking annoying.
call it that.”
Dean catches him staring and smiles. “What?”
Castiel knows he can't answer this. The embarrassment will be too much. He can't even get a place to sleep. Dean will think he's pathetic or something similar. Castiel grabs his beer and drinks, hoping to stall. He slowly sets the bottle down once he's finished.
Cas can't help but smile. Dean's here. He's safe.
"Because, this is happening to you because of me," Dean answers.
Cas is going to die. He's lying on his back on the cold, concrete floor, the wound in his abdomen is worse than anything he's ever had. It's not the most painful thing he's ever experienced, but he can feel himself fading away with every second that passes.
"Dean," Cas says softly. He feels that if he's too loud, he'll break this moment like glass. He doesn't want this to end.
Castiel follows. Garth is…something.
Sam's shoulders were slumped, and the bruises and scratches Dean could see shone in stark contrast to Sam's pale skin.
Dean Winchester
want to misinterpret this. He wasn't going to ruin their friendship and make things awkward between them forever.
“Shut your face.” Dean points his spoon at him again, but he’s smiling now.
"I just never thought this would happen," Dean admitted. He absent-mindedly rubbed one of his thumbs through Cas' hair. The tension from earlier was already starting to drain away. Dean didn't know how he felt about Cas being able to calm him down so well.
At least Dean admitted he pushed Cas away. "I'm not your best friend," Cas replies. He just wants Dean to leave him alone in his miserable bed full of sweat and sadness.
"Fuck you, Cas," he muttered under his breath.
"Fine." This time it isn't a lie. Work's not great. Castiel would rather be helping Dean. But it's also not terrible. It's just fine.
Dean looks back down, and he feels just the smallest bit better. “Yeah, you are.”
I don’t even know why I’m not constantly fighting Cas about raising it. Maybe because it’s Cas, and when it comes to Cas things are—things are different. It also might be due to the fact I thought Cas had been killed before the baby was born. He went into that other dimension and didn’t come out for a long, long time. I was
"Got us a motel room," Dean explains.
Dean swallows thickly. “I have a flat tire.”
Lisa bites her lip to hide a smile before speaking, “I was just in town and heard you moved here, so I thought I’d drop by.” Dean ignores the warning bells going off in his head. He should be wondering how Lisa found him exactly, but he doesn’t care.
Her smile is contagious, and Castiel grins.
I look up. “What?”
He’s devoting all his time to working. He’s never been well off, and he’ll need all the money he can get to support Lisa and the baby. He even cut D&D out. He never told Lisa about that. Dean knows she wouldn’t be so…unjudgmental about it like Cas had been.
Dean glances over. "Yeah?"
Dean shakes his head. “She—” His voice breaks. “She
Dean's blood runs cold. "Wait, am I
of all people. Cas hadn't said Sam had prayed to him, so what the hell happened to his little brother?
equipped to be a father. In fact, you’re the best person I know to be a father.”
Dean flips him off.
Tears springs into Castiel’s eyes. Someone should be playing it. It shouldn’t be neglected like it is now. He hasn’t played in
Cas and Sam are standing breathless in the doorway.
. I don’t know why I’m spilling my guts to you today, but, uh.” He looks down and swallows.
Dean's gaze flicks down to Cas' lips. "You don't remember at all?"
Dean faces the mirror and winces. Yeah, he looks gross, but he’s
Castiel frowns. “Tuesday? This Tuesday? Today is Thursday. Do you mean two days ago?”
“Tell her to leave.”
Castiel frowns and looks up. Dean is staring at him with eyes just a shade too bright and more freckles on his face than Castiel remembers. This is a dream.
Dean looks back at Cas. Cas' eyes flick down Dean's body. Arousal strikes through Dean, and he tightens his grip on Cas' hand. Dean realizes Cas probably didn't mean for him to see that. Cas' immediately looks back up at Dean and blushes. Damn. It's cute.
“I didn’t think I wanted that. Now, I—” he motioned at Dean’s wings.
Dean’s wings were folded over him, covering him when the soldiers arrived and Dean felt the way that they came at him. His wings fluttered to push them away and yet Dean still felt the sharp something that kept hitting him over and over and then the grasping hands that were trying to pull him away.
“I told you it would,” Dean said and nudged his shoulder.
“Come on, your pie is probably cooled off enough.”
Dean rearranged them. He sat up a little and pulled Cas into his side, marveling just a little at how electric it felt to touch Cas, but also how physical contact had never been easier.
“Castiel told me that his father brought him back. Chuck brought him back from The Empty. And I played a part in it the last time that he — I just don’t know how.”
“You’re a beekeeper too,” Dean said. “That’s amazing.”
“Wait, you’re gay,” Dean said and his eyes widened because that was not at all the point of what Cas had been saying. Not to mention that there was some other emotional undercurrent there.
Thinking about Cas ignited something, a spark that appeared as the singular thing other than Dean in the space. It beckoned and Dean followed.
“So you became an angel,” Cas said and it wasn’t a question, but he still tilted his head just so as if it were.
drug-free today.
. The pantry alone could house all the spices I want and then some. And, are there
“That’s fair,” Dean says and eats another spoonful. He talks while food is still in his mouth, “So, Cas, what do you do?”
"We might have to stop somewhere," Dean says.
“Alright, say it,” Dean says and hardly meets Castiel’s eyes.
This day is somehow even better than yesterday. And, who knows? Tomorrow might even be better than today. But one thing Dean knows for sure is that they have all the time in the world, and he's not going to waste a single minute.
Garth nods. “Yeah.” He unlocks the door and steps inside.
was. There was a rustling of clothes, and the bed shifted. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean like he had a few minutes ago. Dean leaned against him. Right now he didn't care if this was clingy or pathetic or whatever. He didn't care if Cas didn't like him back in the same way. He didn't care if Cas didn't realize just how romantic this all was. Dean was just so lonely and needed to be close to Cas. Dean placed his arm on top of Cas' and interlaced their fingers. Now Cas couldn't leave.
The orchestra he’s visiting now is the last on his list, and he honestly just wants to go home, but he knows he won’t be able to sleep knowing he didn’t try every possible way to become part of a musical group again. Castiel set up meetings with each of the conductors of the orchestras he wanted to join, and they were all either too serious, intimidating, or demanding. They all also wanted him to audition, but he hasn’t played in nearly a month, and he didn’t feel comfortable playing. So that was also really awkward. Castiel hopes this next group will work out, but he doubts it.
Dean suppresses a burst of laughter. He doesn’t want to interrupt the quiet, emptying theater. “Yeah, I do, Cas.”
“Dean—”
will last.” His sarcasm isn’t lost on me. I glance back up at Cas, and he’s smiling. “I’m going to take him to bed,” he says.
Dean blinks at him in surprise, and they stare for a moment too long. Dean says hurriedly, “Oh, uh, it’s fine, Cas.”
Castiel now knows it’s a 1967 Chevrolet Impala. Dean spent an entire night talking about his car. As Castiel thought before: heterosexual. Dean unlocks the car and they both get in. It’s very clean inside, and the seats look brand new.
"Of course." Cas helped Dean stand up, but never stopped holding his hand and led them back inside.
in here? The meals I could cook in a kitchen like this. I set down the bags on the island in frustration. Cas can’t even cook. What a waste.
“What did you say?”
Cas’ other hand grabs Dean’s arm just below his shoulder. “Dean,” he says gently. “The flat can be fixed.”
I leaned my back against the wall and closed my eyes. It wasn't so bad like this. I could just rest until Cas came back. At least this will give me something to think about besides him.
“Did you go to college?” Castiel asks.
“Did it hurt?”
going to have to settle.
“Well…yeah.”
Cas continues, "I think we missed the movie."
Dean smirks. "What, and that's how you see me?" he teases.
Dean blinks, and Cas opens the door and steps into the hallway. “Uh, yeah, goodnight!” Dean says belatedly.
"Are you hurt?" Cas frowned in worry.
of the classics. As they’re watching the movie, Dean comments on certain scenes, but every time he looks at Cas to talk to him, Cas is already staring at him. Dean thinks he’s going to have a heart attack. But a good heart attack. When the movie finishes, they talk a bit about nothing in particular. Cas is getting sleepy, so he eventually gets up to leave. Dean walks him to the door.
Castiel opens his eyes, and Dean is sitting across from him.
Castiel took a step towards the box. He stopped, no doubt reading its inscription. "You didn't touch it, did you?" He spun to look at me.
I kissed him again. The heat finally reaching my fingers and down toward my legs and...other places.
"Cas, stop," Dean says.
"Winchester?"
"How's work?" Dean asks.
“Thank you,” Cas says. “And you as well.”
Dean clears his throat. “Glad we could share childhood traumas, but, uh, we should probably head back.”
Dean clears his throat again. “Yeah, uh, like the person who creates the campaign your group goes on.”
How are all these bad things happening at once?
earlier for fuck's sake. And now Cas was apologizing? Why had Dean freaked out again? Everything was fine.
Dean held his breath. "Yeah?"
"I need a drink," Dean stated and turned around before Cas could reply. He remembered the way to the bar. It wasn't a long walk.
into it.
They stare at each other again, but Dean is too tired to care. He closes his eyes.
Dean clears his throat. “The room’s ready.”
Sam and I don’t talk about it. The fact that I suddenly changed my mind and let the thing live. I’m glad he doesn’t say anything. The most he ever got to acknowledging it was,
Castiel turns his attention back to his menu, swallowing down the dread building there. Now he's going to have to pay for that, too.
“Kelly,” I say quietly.
Dean sighed. "Cas, I didn't mean in a friendship way."
Dean slowed down a bit. He'd been walking down the sidewalk at a frantic pace. He didn't even have a destination in mind. All he knew was that he just had to keep walking. He turned to look at Cas, but he didn't stop.
"You're still here," Dean commented.
"I'm Marco," the guy—Marco—introduced.
“I’m just laying down facts, man.”
"No," Dean answers too quickly. "Let's go."
“I’m not carrying you to my room, princess, so you gotta stand up.”
They slowly make their way back to Cas' cabin. It's the first time Cas really enjoys walking through camp. He can clearly feel the slight breeze on his skin, and he watches a bird fly overhead. It's really quite peaceful. Cas is actually a bit sad when they reach his cabin, but they both head inside.
Dean blushes. “Who?”
"Absolutely not!" Dean is just as surprised at his outburst as Cas is. He takes a deep breath before continuing, much calmer this time, "Cas, I have a hard time saying, 'I love you' to
"Dean," Cas says again, gently.
Dean jerked his head up. "Geez, Cas. That was quick."
Mary smiles knowingly. “Yes, I’ve heard.”
Dean snaps his head back up. “Uh, what?”
Dean heard Cas running to catch up with him. "
"Dean," Cas called firmly.
“Coffee is good,” Castiel agrees as they reach the door. He opens the door, and they both step outside. It’s freezing. Mornings are always too cold.
"When you were talking about being under the witches' spell. Why were you so upset about me?" Castiel didn't want to say anything in case he was wrong. He had a habit of misjudging social situations, and this was something he couldn't afford to get wrong. But he could already feel the bright rush of hope swelling within his vessel's chest. He did his best to tamper it down.
“Kelly,” I say sternly, “I have to do this.”
Castiel stirs around the contents of his soup. He can’t help but feel embarrassed when he says, “Get drunk and watch Christmas movies.”
have panic attacks. Dean snorted. "Yeah, right."
I swallow down my guilt and slowly turn around. “Sorry, it was just—the crying was sort of loud, and, uh…” I glance back down at the mobility thing on the floor. I should put the baby back.
Dean immediately turns to look at Cas. Cas sounds…Cas sounds
Castiel sits back and watches the town go by as he sips on the coffee he stole from Dean. Despite how terrible they are, mornings are quite peaceful. The sky is glowing in the cool blue of pre-dawn. The quietness paired with the soft light makes the town muted and sleepy. Castiel finishes the coffee and turns to look at Dean. The dim lighting softens his features. He really is beautiful.
“That’s—yes, that’s good.”
“Oh, yes. He loves you very much,” Cas says.
Lisa lives with him now. She says she’s looking for a job in town, but Dean has his doubts. But after arguing with her about it four times, he’s given up. It only leads to tension, which is the last thing Dean or his baby needs.
I clear my throat. “Uh, yeah, I can see that. But they’re not
I grin as I brush past him to the baby’s room. “Plastic nipple!”
Castiel sighs. “Trying to think up a
Dean lets Cas pull him up and lead him to his apartment. He still can’t look Cas in the face. Cas guides Dean into the bathroom and sits him on the toilet. He places a box of tissues on Dean’s lap. Dean wipes his eyes and blows his nose. He bites his lip in frustration.
“We didn’t get along all the time,” Dean said. “But when we were fixing up Baby or one of the other cars, that’s when I felt like I knew him best.”
“Sam texted earlier,” Cas said.
Dean dreaded returning, but life on the road wasn’t some balm that made everything easier. It just meant that at least he was on his own. It was on the road that he started to pray. He prayed to Cas knowing it wouldn’t be heard and every prayer ended with: “you idiot, how could you think I never felt the same.” But Dean never said those three words, not when they would never reach Cas’ ears and that was the only way that he would ever say them outloud.
“Well that and because I like you and I’m a good person. And I think after today, we are friends? Right?”
“Let me get this straight,” Sam said. “Well, I guess not straight.”
(See the end of the chapter for
By the time that they left The Roadhouse, Cas did look more relaxed. He didn’t ask Dean where he was taking him, but he looked curious as they drove. Their drive was silent, broken only by Led Zeppelin playing low from the radio.
“What was—”
Dean’s brows furrowed and understanding was settling in him. “What are you talking about, kid?”
Castiel laughed. “No, actually. But I was born on a Thursday and throughout the pregnancy she was sure I’d be a girl and that she would name me Wednesday.”
“It’s really happening,” Cas said eventually, looking at Dean with wide surprised eyes.
There could have been no other answer, not when saying yes meant that he could have Cas back and that he could tell him the most important three words that Cas would ever hear. It ate at him, knowing that Dean had been so shocked and struck by Cas’ words that nothing had come out of his mouth to dispel what Cas had clearly believed. Cas had been so sure that Dean would never see him that way, that his feelings were one-sided.
The way that Cas lit up when he looked at Dean, then, made Dean realize all at once that he had known Cas for maybe an hour, but that he was already gone for him. He was infatuated. He had a big fat crush the likes of which Dean didn’t think he’d ever had before.
“Been in heaven, hell, and purgatory. Makes sense I’d get to come here too,” Dean said more to himself than anything because there really was no one and Jack hadn’t given him any instructions.
“I come here to think,” Dean said. “Whenever everything feels like too much. It’s peaceful and then there is just this. Nature, the water, how it isn’t quiet, but my brain can be quiet.”
Cas was still moving around grabbing things left and right and Dean felt weird sitting there not doing anything. The whole thing just felt strange.
Dean watched him. Jack ran agitated hands through his hair. His eyes flitted this way and that before they were on Dean again.
“Cas, can I help?” Dean found himself asking. “I can’t just sit here.”
“Sam, I’ll explain after.”
“My permission?” Dean asked, bemused.
“Lisa’s nice,” Dean said. “And it was nice to be with her but there was something missing. We’re better as friends. I think we were both just lonely.”
Dean had forgotten how much Jack looked like Cas. He had changed little in his time away, he still even wore jeans and t-shirt. He could have just been coming out of his room to see why Dean was still awake, curious and puppy-like in his excitement to help. That was missing from him, because his lips were pressed into a line and he looked serious.
They left Sam and Eileen a note at the bunker and then Cas explained to Dean how to fly into heaven. And then Dean wrapped his arms around his angel and Dean was flying with Cas in his arms. They arrived in a clean, very white and empty room. At least, it seemed empty at first until Jack appeared, running towards them until he could throw himself at Cas who only just managed to keep his balance.
Dean cut him off. “No. I’m here because you were kind enough to bake me a pie. It’s the least that I can do.”
“Kid came back with a dog. Bones. My mom made our dad let us keep him but somehow I was the one that ended up taking Bones out on walks all the time.”
“I needed to,” Dean said back.
“I know about the deal,” Jack said. “What he did for me. What he did for you.”
A light pink tinged Cas’ cheeks, but he was smiling.
“If you don’t, opening day will be here and you’ll be so run down you won’t even enjoy it. You don’t have to do this alone. I’ll be here and I’ll get Sam to come help too and I’m sure if you ask Lisa she’ll help. And your cousin, what was his name? Gabriel. You bake enough for him that he owes you.”
“We do have to talk, Dean,” Cas said, removing his hand from Dean’s feathers and then taking a step back.

Dean scoffed. “Cas, you are the only person I know who has bees in his backyard. You bake and give away freshly baked goods to shelters and soup kitchens. You have a dream and you’re making it happen.”
Castiel chuckled. “Sure. I will bake you anything anytime anywhere.”
The anger that should have come at hearing that stayed at bay, kept back by his pain and by the pain that was reflected in Jack. For Jack, Cas had been a father. Maybe it was unconventional in the way it had come to be with Jack being Lucifer’s son and with Jack not being an actual baby when he was born, but Jack had chosen Cas and Cas had always loved and protected Jack. Not to mention that Dean’s anger at Jack had done more harm than good in the past, so Dean let it simmer and then just turned off the flame entirely.
Castiel’s kitchen was a mess. There were piles of dirty bowls and other odds and ends in the sink. Very counter space was taken up with trays or cooling racks. Even the top of the stove had trays on it. On the island sat a Kitchen Aid mixer.
“I don’t know if that’s better or worse than being named after my grandmother,” Dean said with a grin.
“And it’s only happening because of you,” Castiel said. “Really, Dean, that money would have sat in the bank and I wouldn’t have done any of this, but you...you made it possible. If anyone is amazed by anyone here, it should be me. And today...you brought me here. Dean, it’s like you know just what I need.”
Cas head tilt was back and he narrowed his eyes. “For payment in pie and other baked goods.”
“Wow,” Dean said.
Dean hadn’t realized that Cas had been giving him and Jack the space to talk.
“Dean, you just broke up with Lisa a couple of months ago and this guy lives right next door to her. Isn’t it a little—”

“Anyway, I thwarted her plans by being a boy and being born on a Thursday. Dad always said it was the meds that made her loopy.”
Dean turned. “Not my boyfriend.”
“That place where someone opened that hardware store,” Cas said.
“We’ve been over this. I like you and I think you’re a fantastic baker and I think the whole world should know it. Or, at least the whole town.”
“No, I’m kinda paying him back. Doing him a favor. He has a few loose steps in his backyard. I noticed them yesterday when I was here and I offered to fix them.”
Castiel nodded with a big smile. “That’d be great.”
Cas just nodded.
While Cas tried to protest and tell Dean he would just hire someone to fix it for him, Dean pointed out that Cas had baked Dean a pie and refused payment. By the time that Dean left, a few hours later because he decided to start on the pie right there and then, and then he and Cas got caught up talking about Cas’ bees and other things, Dean had gotten him to agree to let Dean come back the next day to fix his steps.
On a Saturday, when Dean hadn’t gotten a response from Cas about getting breakfast, Dean drove straight to Angel Bakes. He found Castiel there at the back entrance where he seemed to be in the middle of carrying a heavy looking box inside. Dean rushed and grabbed the other end of the box to lighten the load.
Cas put the box back together after a moment and then he looked at Dean again with a grin.
The smile had grown. “I know that you’re only saying that because you want access to my pie all the time, but thank you.”
“So, you don’t want to be an angel,” Jack said.
When they pulled away, Cas’ cheeks were pink, but his smile still hadn’t left his lips.
Cas took him outside through the back door. He had a small deck in the back similar to the front, and Dean had to stop just at the top of the stairs because Cas’ backyard was like nothing Dean had expected. Dean had expected it to look like Lisa’s, to be just grass and nothing more. He should have known better.
“Dean, you’re...” Cas trailed off.
It was nearing morning by the time that their conversation ended. Dean hadn’t slept in over twenty-four hours. It was a strange thing to know, but stranger to know he didn’t need it at all. And that he wasn’t hungry.
He did tell Cas about the time that Sam ran away. How worried he was and how when he returned and their dad was still screaming and yelling not just at Sam but at Dean as well, Dean had only wanted to hug Sam and he didn’t care that his dad blamed him because Sam was okay.
His fingers itched to grab onto Cas again.
He told Cas about everyone being gone and about how in the end it had come down to Jack.
“Oh,” Cas said and his hand reached outwards and one of Dean’s wings moved towards Cas’ reach without Dean realizing it.
“What the hell is going on?” Sam asked.
“We’re friends, Sam,” Dean said.
“I can’t be here right now,” Dean had muttered as he watched the coffee drip down the wall.
Dean hugged him back at once, his arms wrapping around Cas to rest at his back and he never wanted to let go. Castiel had an earthy smell to him, but something flowery too in his hair. He felt amazing in Dean’s arms and they stayed that way in that hug for longer than was socially normal.
“He did,” Dean said. “Just as delicious as I remembered it.”
And then there was the other aspects. The sex. Dean wasn’t shy about how much sex he’d had over the years and although it had happened very few times, sometimes it hadn’t been all women. With Cas, just like everything else, it was different. It meant more and it was satisfying because it brought them closer emotionally and physically. It was the most perfect thing.
Cas turned so that he was facing Dean, the space between them practically nonexistent. “This is only happening because of you,” Cas informed him before wrapping his arms around Dean’s shoulders.
For some reason, Sam never pushed after the first few days. He never asked questions or tried to get Dean to talk about Cas probably because the first time Cas came up, right after everything went down, Dean had yelled and thrown things and then he’d picked up a bottle of Jack Daniels and when that one was gone he drank another all spaced out with beer and yet the pain was never dulled. The headache and nausea from the next day made him forget for a few moments and then it just added on.
The kitchen looked far better than when Dean had first seen it by the time he had finished drying all the trays and pans. He was putting the trays away where Cas had pointed when the oven timer went off.
“I want you,” Cas said without hesitation.
“Why Angel Bakes?” Dean asked after the sign was up and he and Cas stood outside looking up at it.
Dean had imagined how seeing Cas would feel, how happy he would be and how things might play out, but his imagination didn’t account for Cas himself and for how the reality would feel. How all his emotions would become a tangled ball of yarn with so many starts and ends that no single thing took precedence. There was so much to say. So much that needed explaining. Cas had been gone months, long months that Dean had somehow existed through. But one required repeating.
Thank you to everyone that read this. I truly appreciate it.
“Then we keep looking,” Dean said. “Where did you originally have in mind the first time around?”
“I need your permission,” Jack said.
“I can’t,” Jack said in little more than a whisper. “And I have to — they need me back in Heaven, Dean. I…” he trailed off and his head tilted to the side as he looked directly at Dean. “I can’t go to The Empty.”
Castiel got back to piling up his dirty trays and bowls. He moved with such fluidity that Dean could have just watched him for hours. He was so clearly in his element and Dean could picture him in another kitchen. One in the back of a bakery full of the industrial equipment it would need. Dean needed that to happen.
Apparently, Castiel’s grandfather had been very well off. So well off that when he died, he left a sizable amount of money to his favorite grandchild.
Dean absolutely did know Carver Edlund. So, his silence at the reveal made Castiel chuckle.
Dean knew his brother and he knew his brother meant well, that Sam had cared for Cas too, but that didn’t change the facts and in those first initial days when he was still trying to wrap his mind around the other thing, hope that they could bring Cas back was the last thing on his mind. He didn’t need Sam making unfounded promises that they would find a way when Dean knew their chances were slim and that Jack would have interfered and brought Cas back if there was a way.
“Do it,” Dean said.
Slowly, he moved off the table, but couldn’t get himself to let go of Cas’ wrist as if doing so would mean that Cas would just disappear, so as he moved Cas moved with him, sitting up on the table. His trenchcoat was still streaked with back and under it his tie was rumpled and askew.
“No. You are human, Dean. The best human. If they were all like you, this world would be very different. But my wings are gone and one day I won’t even have what is left. I’m appreciating them until they are gone. That’s all.”
So, Dean explained. He didn’t go into detail to how Dean had dealt with Cas being gone, but he mentioned praying to Jack and about how Jack hadn’t answered until he just showed up. How Jack had struggled to find a way to bring Cas back because he couldn’t personally go and fetch him and so it had fallen to Dean.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean called over when he was on the last step.
Cas had loved him.
Dean pulled and in that moment a few things happened. The darkness around him intensified and there was noise, a ringing that meant his time was up.
“You still have a soul,” Jack said. “It is an extension of your grace. My father was right, there is no soul quite like yours. That has made this easier, Dean. And now,  I will send you to The Empty.”
“What is — Dean?”
And that was the moment when Dean lost it.
Cas turned and set his mitts aside. “Bees are really important, Dean. I, uh, I have an apiary in the backyard.”
“I, um, I had a plan. It was a long time ago, but we had been looking at places to rent. My, um, my boyfriend at the time, he and I were going to do it together. And things were falling into place except that then...well, things happen.”
“Yes.”
“Yup. Beekeeping and the bakery were always the things I wanted to do the most. I achieved one goal, at least.”

“I see you finally called Cas,” she said. “He made you pie, didn’t he?”
“They won’t sting,” Cas said, “but there’s protective gear over in that shed if you want any.”
Dean felt his stomach drop. The small sprout of hope that he’d been nourishing inside of him shrivelled and wanted to die.
“It’s Claire,” Sam said and looked at them with wide eyes.
“You’re a guest and—“
“It is complete,” Jack said.
Dean hadn’t been a reader like Sam was a reader, but that didn’t mean that Dean hadn’t read anything and Carver Edlund had written books in many different genres — it was what had made him so popular — but he’d also written a series of books about two brothers who travelled the world hunting ghosts and other supernatural beings and Dean had been obsessed with them for a long time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean ran into Lisa the very next day when he was getting out of the Impala in front of Castiel’s house.
“Yes, yes, you’ve said. You’re too busy,” Dean said and he rolled his eyes.
“Come on, come on,” Dean muttered.
“If you were an angel with angelic power, then I can send you into The Empty and you can bring him back,” Jack said. “You can find Castiel and bring him home.”
Dean didn’t respond. He did kinda hope that his friendship with Cas would develop into more, but it was something he was keeping close to the chest for the moment even if to his brother he would always be obvious.
“It’ll need to cool still, if you want to hang out for a while. Unless you need to go because that’s fine too and I really shouldn’t keep you. It’s Friday night. I bet you have plans and yet you’re stuck here instead when I said I would—“

Cas had been crying.
When Cas touched his shoulder where his mark used to be, Dean reached for Cas’ wrist where his mark had been too and they smiled at each other. Things were good.
Somehow, Dean had begun spending every single Friday with Cas. Watching him bake, and helping him clean up all the meanwhile discussing Castiel’s plans for the bakery. He even started driving Cas to drop off baked goods at the shelters and soup kitchens on Saturdays and then they would go out to get brunch. Early on, those Saturdays had also involved Dean fixing things in Cas’ house for him. Once the remodel at the bakery started, Dean joined him there where he could to see how the work was coming along and after a few weeks, Dean started to see Cas’ vision. The large work space in the back with gleaming countertops, the huge industrial ovens, and the giant mixers.
Heat washed out of it, and Cas put on oven mitts that matched his apron and his mailbox because bees of all sizes were on them.
“Molecules,” Cas said. “I don’t know that it will be the same for you.”
A call to Sam’s cell interrupted their afternoon.
On their way back, Dean pointed out the trouble with Cas’ stairs.
“I’m just getting everything together. It’s been so much, Dean. I’m starting with all the pans and stuff I’ll need but I’ve been looking at suppliers and there’s just so much to order and to figure out. And I have to start getting a menu ready. It’s been a lot.”
“You did it,” Jack said to Dean with an excited smile.
It was important that Sam and Castiel got along. Dean expected they would.
Dean said yes.
On the days when Sam was gone from the bunker, when he was off helping another hunter or with Eileen and on the nights when it was well after midnight and Sam was in his room for the night, Dean hit the books. He was reading up on everything he could about The Empty. There wasn’t much. And then, like every night, he prayed. To Cas at first even though he knew it would never be heard. Then, to Jack.
“Billie would have killed us both,” Cas said, interrupting. “I had the option to save you and you can’t blame me for taking it.”
“I’m just wondering if I’m really needed anymore as a hunter,” Dean said. “And if I could actually do it and walk away. Retire.”
“Some for neighbors and friends. My cousin Gabriel asked for chocolate muffins too so that’s here somewhere. But a lot of this is for the shelter and the soup kitchen downtown. I’ll take it over in the morning and bring the rest to work on Monday.”
It was painful, but it wasn’t the kind of pain that Dean had expected or been prepared for. The pain came from inside like a burning ember that started at the center of his chest and then spread all over. It was his nerves caught aflame and a tingling sensation that climbed to his eyes and that grew tighter and hotter over his shoulder blades.
Dean had thought about it before. It was what had prompted him to pray to Jack and ask for him to bring Cas back. If Jack was on that level of power it wasn’t implausible to think that Jack would be able to do it.
It made him think about the life that he and Sam had led for so long. The constant moving and chasing down leads for possible supernatural threats. How never settling down had hurt any chance of a normal life. Even the Men of Letters bunker was so far away from normal that it couldn’t fully function as a home.
Cas laughed. “I already told Sam we’d meet him and Eileen there.”
Dean was considering the alternative. If he went back to being a human and he left the life. Perhaps not fully, but he might take it slower and be a resource more than someone out there putting his life on the line and doing the work. He could man those agency phones like Bobby had done. There were so many hunters out there. Younger men and women that could take on the mantle. Dean had no idea how Sam felt about it, but Dean could admit that he was tired. Of course, he’d tried the normal life once with Lisa and Ben and it had failed spectacularly. But it had worked in some ways and Dean had cared about Lisa and Ben both. It just hadn’t been enough for him.
“Cas, you can’t—“
“I think you see it now,” Cas said. “I think you see how absolutely unfounded the things you believed about yourself were.”
“You’re not going to put on one of those mesh things?”
It happened slowly, and Dean could tell he was changing almost entirely because of how food tasted and how he started to want food and sleep. His wings were one of the last things to go and having their weight removed from his back was weirdly freeing. Cas seemed more affected by them disappearing. Sometimes, Dean caught him reaching behind Dean as if to touch them only to remember a moment later that they weren’t there.
“I want you too,” Dean said and he couldn’t help but break out into a grin.
So, ignoring his brother’s calls of his name, Dean walked away. He barely even packed and then he was off. Dean turned off his phone. For two weeks he drove going from one shitty hotel room to another. And every day his mind replayed Cas’ last moments.
“She didn’t know,” Dean said. “I just never found a good time to tell her. Tells you a lot about how suited we were for one another.”
“If I changed you, then you changed me,” Dean said. “And from now on, I think we stick together.”
Sam had given him one of his patented looks that screamed of pity and sadness. “We saved the world. There has to be a—”
Eileen appeared behind Sam. She had taken the time to dress and she stopped just next to Sam. Her soul was just as nice as Sam’s and when they stood next to each other they seemed to get brighter. It made Dean wonder about his own soul in relation to the angel whose face he still tenderly held.
Time moved because there was nothing else for it to do, but to Dean that meant little. He tried not to think about it because if he stopped to think about how many days or weeks or months had gone by since, then he would need to consider that eventually one day the number of years without Cas would eclipse the time that he had had with Cas. That felt unacceptable.
In The Empty, his wings had been huge. Their scope and size had been able to wrap around him and shield him from The Empty’s soldiers. They had been so big and Dean had just known it. In the bunker they were smaller and fit in between dimensions and as much as Dean could feel them on his back, he knew they were actually invisible to humans. But Cas was an angel and it must have been jarring for him to see Dean with angel wings.
Cas took Dean into the kitchen.
Dean’s eyes snapped to Jack’s. He saw them flash gold and blue light burst from where their hands connected.
It was strange, turning to face Sam. For one thing, Dean could see his soul, and he could also see that Sam was confused and deny it all he wanted, scared. And worried.
Dean couldn’t help but gasp. “Are you—”
They had stepped away from the boxes, but Cas stopped and he looked directly at Dean. “You really mean that, don’t you?”
So, he told Cas about all the weird myths and things that he’d been really into when he was younger. About how Dean had at one point been convinced that werewolves and ghosts and vampires, and shapeshifters were real. Cas chuckled as Dean explained the lore and the legends. They shared a look and Dean knew that Cas understood why Dean had been so into his grandfather’s books. Then, Dean told him other things. He told him about how it was his dad that had started teaching him how to fix cars, and how it was one of the few things that Dean had held on to after his dad was gone.
“But, take a seat, and if anything catches your eye feel free to eat it.”
It was far more like flying than Dean had imagined it would be. His wings were moving and he was moving and it was all happening at a pace that humans would never be able to comprehend, but Dean wasn’t human anymore and he could understand. But The Empty’s soldiers weren’t human either and Dean rising up his single hand still grasping Cas’ wrist didn’t keep them from coming at him and throwing themselves at him and trying to rip Cas away.
“He was a writer,” Castiel told Dean. “You’ve probably heard of him, actually. Carver Edlund.”
Dean flew them back to the bunker after Jack filled them in on all the rest of his plans and then told Dean that he didn’t need his help to become human again. It would happen on it’s own in a few days — maybe a full week or two — so long as it was what Dean really wanted.
Cas looked down to his feet. “You’ve done so much already,” he said at last. “Too much. And Lisa said...well, she said that I was monopolizing your time and then I realized that of course I was and of course there are other things you’d want to be doing. This isn’t — the bakery isn’t your dream. As much as I love the push you gave me, I shouldn’t be relying on you like this. It isn’t fair, not when there’s other things you should be doing.”
"You were very drunk last night."
Eventually, people start leaving, and soon it’s just me, Cas, Sam, and Eileen. Cas and I decided to stay the night, and we put Jack to bed about fifteen minutes ago.
Dean cleared his throat and took a step back. "Hey, Sammy."
My phone jars me awake. I automatically reach for the gun under my pillow, the sound of werewolves howling is still ringing in my ears. I blink as I realize I’m fine. It was just a dream. I slip the gun back under the pillow and grab my phone from my nightstand and answer the call. It’s only when I put it to my ear that I think I probably should’ve checked the caller ID first.
Sam huffs. "Okay, but I told you I'm hungry. Do you remember what I want?"
"Is something wrong?" Cas asked.
is exciting?”
Why did I think I could do this?
Castiel fumbles for his phone charger in the dark room. He finds it on his nightstand and plugs in his phone, but he pauses when he sees he has a message from Dean.
Dean finally catches up. The movie is already playing in this theater, and they almost don’t find seats. It’s a kids’ movie, but Dean is downright
“I guess we both have poor taste in women,” Cas says.
"Cas?"
Cas kneels in front of Dean and gently pulls his injured hand forward. Dean hisses when Cas sterilizes the wound, but they don’t say a word to each other as Cas patches up Dean’s hand. Cas is gentle and holds onto Dean’s hand as if it’s something precious. Cas is delicately washing the blood off Dean’s hand when Dean notices a white jagged scar on the back of Cas’ left hand.
Castiel smiles. “I don’t know what to say.”
“Mom,” Dean scolds.
Castiel smiles before he types.
Dean looked at Cas. The angel's eyebrows furrowed in concern, and he frowned. Dean was going to say the current case or something, but his mouth moved faster than his brain. "Can angels fall in love?"
“How irresponsible I’m being, and how I’m unequipped to be a…to raise a kid.” Dean swallows, and his eyes flit around the hallway, refusing to look at Castiel.
Dean wakes up, and he can't remember where he is. He knows it isn't the bunker. He feels a body next to him. He's not even fully awake, and he can't bring himself to remember who he's in bed with. Damn. It's been a while since he's had a one-night stand. Loneliness stabs him in the chest, and he shifts towards the warmth of the person beside him. He reaches on arm out, and touches their back. He snakes a hand around their waist and pulls himself against them. Dean feels them begin to stir.
"I never thought I'd be happy again."
After his third alarm goes off, Castiel angrily grabs his phone, blinking at the screen as he turns it off. He pauses when he sees a message from Dean. He unplugs his phone and sits up then runs a hand over his face to try and wipe the sleep away.
"Cas!" Dean greets.
Dean's pillow feels weird. It's lumpy but soft. It's very warm. It also smells like Cas. Which is also weird. Why does his pillow smell like Cas? Cas is dead. But, no. No. Cas is alive. He has been for months now. Dean just forgets when he wakes up sometimes.
“I’m not,” Dean immediately answers.
"No. I'm fine." Dean didn't even look at him.
"I wanted to see," Cas replies. He can feel his cheeks heating up in embarrassment.
you, Dean. I never said anything, because I knew you wouldn't feel the same."
Dean shrugged. "More for me then."
The man raised a playful eyebrow as he took a sip of his drink, his eyes wandered down Dean's body. Dean felt his cheeks heat up, but he had enough alcohol in his system for the shyness to pass quickly in place of confidence.
“I mean it, Dean,” Cas continues. “What she did to you was manipulative.”
"It's just..." Dean began. "It's just what you say."
"It does?" Dean answers in surprise. He doesn't stop the smile that stretches across his face. Cas isn't looking anyway. "Why?"
“Dean talks about you, too,” Cas says. “He thinks very highly of you.”
“Let’s, ah, what’s the term? Play hooky?”
"Did you just hang up on your brother?" Cas asks suspiciously.
"You don't have to."
"Dean," Cas said uncertainly and looked at the floor. "I don't know how."
It’s only then that it occurs to Castiel that maybe Dean just doesn’t want to hang out with him anymore. Cooking for two isn’t easy
Dean looked up. "The spell the witches put me under." He swallowed and backed up. He went to the rear of the car and put the cap back on the fuel tank. Castiel followed.
I shake Cas awake. He sits up, and I step back as I wait for him to come back to reality. He takes a few minutes to get his breathing under control, but the second his eyes regain their clarity, I grab his arm and jerk him off the couch.
“And you think
"Dean?" Cas' voice was so fragile.
He broke away from me. "We need to find a cure for you... Dean!" I started kissing his neck. I needed more. He was so soft and so delicate and so warm. He pushed me away, so I was pressed against the wall.
He nods. “I-I know.” He grabs my arms and pulls me into a hug. I let him cry into my chest.
"Stop using."
"Something is pulling me," Dean said.
Dean’s going to be late for work. He quickly zips up the front of his uniform and rushes to the door, grabbing his keys on the way out. He locks his apartment door and races down the stairs. He’s all but sprinting down the hallway, and shoves the door open with a little too much force. He stops short.
"You're crying."
like Sam was there. Almost. After an uneventful breakfast, he got back into the Impala and drove around town. He prayed for Cas a couple more times. No response. As he was driving down a road near the downtown area, a flashing neon sign caught his eye. A bar.
. Maybe Cas didn't notice.
Sam grinned. "I just needed the keys for a coffee run. You want anything?"
He punches the wall.
“Dean?” Cas is grabbing his arm again, and Dean realizes he never answered Cas’ question.
Dean lifts his gaze from their hands. He’s still blushing. “Yeah?”
mean for Cas to stop playing altogether. But maybe Cas stopped because he’s gone. His car is gone. Dean never sees him. The piano playing stopped. It doesn’t take a genius to figure what that means. Cas moved. He’s gone. Forever.
Castiel hates the blush that creeps into his cheeks. “Thank you, Dean.”
"I love you, too. When I thought I lost you—" Dean's voice breaks.
“Hey,” I greet without looking up from my laptop. None of these cooking articles are helpful. No one needs to hear your life story,
Cas eyed Dean in concern. "You've been reading the same chapter for three hours," Cas replied.
Castiel wakes to insistent knocking. He groans, and the world spins. He has a horrible headache, his mouth is dry, and it feels as if he drank a cup of battery acid. He grabs the glass of water from his nightstand and takes a few sips as he stumbles down the hallway. He feels a little better.
"Uh... Hi, Christine." Cas stood stiffly.
Dean smiles. “Awesome. You ready now, or do you want to come up in a few minutes?”
"You're more than a little drunk," Cas replied harshly.
cold. And then I felt the cold spreading up my arms. I immediately dropped the box. It hit the ground with a thud. Castiel came running into the room.
Cas gave him a small smile. "Sam's going to be okay, too," he reassured.
good.” He eagerly eats another spoonful.
Dean eventually pulls away when his pride finally returns and reminds him how weak he’s being. Dean swallows. “Sorry.” He looks at his shoes.
"A few hours ago," Castiel answers. It's the truth. He just didn't tell Dean exactly how much or what he ate.
"Okay...are you alright?" Sam asks.
"You can stay if you want. But I think Sam's still asleep." Dean turned to Castiel and paused. "What?"
Dean turns to look. Cas is standing in front of him, the lights from the hotel outline him. He's so pretty. "Sorry," Dean says. "Just don't want this day to end, you know?"
"You'll never lose me. I promise."
"I think you have a fever," Dean states. "You're very warm."
This is getting weird. “Cas?”
Cas put his hands in his pockets and thoughtfully bit his lip. He really was pretty. Dean wondered how soft his lips were. They were only a few feet apart, and he could close the distance pretty fast. Heat rose to Dean's cheeks as he realized what he was thinking about. He hadn't been alone with Cas for this long in ages, and it was really starting to fuck with him.
Dean grins. The angel is even more excited than Dean thought he'd be. Cas races over to the nearby yellow ones.
Castiel sets an alarm for his phone at 6:00 but then decides that won’t be enough since he hates mornings. He sets an alarm for 5:30 and 5:45 in addition to the 6:00 one. Hopefully, he’ll be up by then.
“Can’t imagine what you’ve been eating to think this is as good as you say,” Dean says before taking his first bite.
“Oh.” Castiel hates the heat rising in his cheeks. “I suppose I like you, too.” He looks up at Dean. “Well, I like your cooking anyway.”
Castiel nods. Anything he wants to say gets stuck in his throat. Dean looks…well, horrible. He’s got bags under his eyes, his hair is messy, and his clothes are wrinkled. Something’s wrong.
"I thought 'fine' meant 'generally well'."
Dean snorted. "It's not a maybe."
His lips are wet and swollen, and he looks up at me with heavy-lidded eyes and blown pupils. All I want to do is kiss him again.
Cas pulls away and squints at me. “Dean,” he chides.
He idly moves his hand from his injury and looks up at the blood on it. His hand is completely red. He chokes down more blood and closes his eyes. This is it.
"So what's your plan?" Dean asked as they walked into his room.
"Nothing," Dean answered. "I don't know what I was saying."
Dean feels as if he’s been stabbed in the heart. “Fuck you.” It comes out soft and weak.
I rush up the stairs. Kelly is screaming, and the lights are flickering. It’s happening. Satan’s little hell-spawn is being born. I reach the upstairs hallway and follow the sounds of Kelly’s screams. I don’t even think I’d need to hear her to know where that thing is. The energy coming from the room it’s in is unlike anything I’ve felt before. It reminds me a bit of when Cas used to fly. How the air would feel electric right before he landed. It’s like that, but times a thousand. It feels like lightning is about to strike. Maybe it is. My footsteps thunder down the hallway, and there’s one final scream. All of the lights burst.
"I'm sorry," Castiel feels himself automatically respond. It's as if the phrase has the power to make everything better. Castiel chances a glance up at Dean. Dean is running a hand over his face. Their eyes meet.
Dean wasn't going to lie and say things had been going great between them either. They'd been bickering more and more during hunts ever since Sam took up the trials. In reality, Dean was worried for Sam's health. The trials were really taking a toll on his little brother, and he couldn't lose Sam. Not after everything. Dean hadn't meant for his anger to be taken out on Sam. His stress kept coming out in short bursts of anger. But it was no excuse. Dean had stupidly taken his anger out on Sam, and Sam thought it was just Dean being angry that he took on the trials instead of Dean.
It takes so much more to get a good high now. Every day he has to take a little something. Every time he feels himself coming down, the anxiety is almost paralyzing. He begins to
Ruin everything? How is this going to ruin everything? If anything, this just
Castiel has never broken so many traffic laws in the name of speed before. His new Jeep is amazing. When he gets back, he sees the Impala in her usual spot. How had Dean beaten him? He races to his room, throws on pajamas, and goes up the stairs two at a time. The door’s unlocked, and Castiel lets himself in. Christmas music is softly playing in the background and something sweet like pastries is cooking.
"You're hot," he stated like a dumb teenager after his first kiss.
April sits down on the bench and lifts the piano cover. She plays a couple scales and a short little melody. It’s lovely.
"Dean, you're not making sense."
“Dean, you don’t ha—”
That only earns more staring.
Cas has never been
—a great man. Kind. Loving. Loyal.
Castiel glances up at him to confirm it's okay to take it. Dean nods, and Castiel grabs it and puts it on. It's a little big, but it's warm, and it smells like Dean.
"Mhmm," Dean answered.
. They were all too complicated. And a waste of time.
He’s right behind Cas when Cas suddenly turns around. Cas’ back is at the door, and, fuck, they can’t be more than a foot apart. “Dean,” Cas says. And he’s looking at Dean with those eyes. The spark of happiness is still there.
Cas blinks again. "Oh." He reaches up with one hand and cups Dean's face. "Well, I'm alive."
a voice in Castiel’s head chimes in unhelpfully. It sounds eerily like his father.
"Yeah, not so fun being on the receiving end of a love confession, is it?"
“I haven’t had a meal this good in a long time,” Castiel explains.
"Looking at the snow," Cas answers.
Castiel is slammed with insecurity. She’s beautiful in a commanding way. And Castiel is still in his clothes from yesterday, probably looking haggard from his night of drinking. “Yes?”
Dean smiles back before eating more soup. “So,” he says with his mouth full.
“No. He wouldn’t,” Dean said and left it at that.
“Yeah, Cas. I’m a fan.”
Pie fest was everything that Dean had expected it to be and being able to fully taste all of the pies made it even better. Having Cas next to him and a tray full of plates of every pie that there had been and with Sam and Eileen signing at each other, Dean didn’t think he would ever feel happier. It was exactly how things should be.
“You didn’t give me time to say it back,” Dean said. “But I do love you, Cas. And isn’t it better reciprocated. To have it and know it.”
They stood side by side and looked at the sign and Dean couldn’t help the feeling of pride that filled him because he had known Cas for a few months and yet even from the first night, it had been easy to tell that Castiel didn’t feel confident enough to go for it. But a few nudges had been enough to make him decide that yes, he could do it.
Jack’s hand landed on his shoulder, squeezing gently. Dean looked up.
His hand lingered on Cas’ cheek and Cas was staring at him unblinkingly first looking at Dean’s face and then past him.
As he and Cas rose and Cas’ was completely out of the substance, Dean felt the weight of the soldiers on his wings and the ringing from before rose in pitch into a painful screech that Dean realized was supposed to wake The Empty itself. And if that happened, Dean knew he and Cas would never make it out.
“You do? You know, most people...they don’t like bees.”
She would deny it later, Dean was sure, but her eyes teared up when she saw Cas right before she launched at him and pummeled his chest twice before Dean grabbed her around the waist and pulled her away.
Dean threw the mug at the nearest wall. The ceramic shattered and the coffee splattered on the wall and dripped down.
“I don’t know what Lisa told you about me,” Dean said. “But, I will pretty much do anything for pie. And I’m really handy with a tool. And I kinda own my own business. I think we could be good friends…and I like to help my friends out.”

In reality, Dean knew that his mom’s pie hadn’t been anything truly amazing. It was that she made it and that she made it for Dean. The memory of it. He didn’t tell Cas about how often his parents fought or how sometimes it was him getting them to stop or consoling his mom when his dad took off. Or how once Dean had seen a few things in the garage that suggested his dad might have cheated on his mom.
“And so you felt like you could add in a pie for me to your already high pile of baking,” Dean said. “You really didn’t have to.”
“Look, we can get a little of that done, but then after that we are going out to get some food and then I’ll take you somewhere where you can have a little peace.”
“Lucky for you, I am,” Dean told him.
He must have been feeling tired, because Castiel relented without arguing and so after Dean helped bring in the rest of the boxes from Cas’ car, Dean made Cas get into the Impala and then drove him to The Roadhouse for an early lunch.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hi, Dean,” Jack said. “I’m sorry I didn’t come before.”
Dean dropped the spatula in his hand. “Pie fest,” he repeated. “And you’re only just now mentioning this? I think we have the location of our next date, Cas.”
He heard Eileen pull Sam away and they must have been signing to each other because he didn’t hear anything except their footsteps. Dean would need to do something really nice for Eileen when it was all said and done because without her there, Sam would have demanded answers in his stubborn way.
Cas was no more than dead weight. His head hung down against his chest and his tan coat was streaked with black sludge. Dean was never going to let him go.
Knowing fully well that there could be nothing to do to bring Cas back, Dean returned to the bunker and promised himself that he would try. Not with any expectation or hope, but just because not trying felt like giving up on Cas altogether and that was one thing that Dean would never do.
“Hi, Dean,” Cas said, all smiles. “I brought something for you.”
Jack didn’t respond. He didn’t appear and he didn’t send any messages. Dean prayed to Jack every day for two months until he finally just stopped.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas said. His blue eyes were filled with unmistakable sadness.
“I think we’ll have to talk to Jack,” Dean said. “We’ll have to go to him. But Cas, this affects you too. What do you want?”
Dean had spent a lot of nights sitting on the hood of his car watching the stars there. He’d gone there to make hard decisions, or when life got hard and he just needed a place to go. It was not a place he had shared with anyone. Not Sammy. Not his mom. Not his dad. Not Cassie. Not Lisa. And it wasn’t like the spot was hard to get to or a secret, it was just that Dean had never told anyone that it was a place where he went. Cas was different and the number one thing that made him different was that while any of the others would understand why Dean went there or even appreciate the peace and quiet or how little light pollution existed there, they wouldn’t get it. Not like Castiel would.
“Perhaps.”
“You…” Castiel begins. He blinks. Dean stayed. Dean stayed
“Sam!”
Cas smiles at him again. But it's one of the sad ones. "Thank you, Dean."
want to hear it, Cas.” I spin around and walk towards the baby’s room.
Dean makes the mistake of looking at Cas again. They stare at each other for too long.
"Alright, sit down." Dean pulled Cas over to the bed and pushed him onto it. Dean sat but sort of fell onto the bed next to Cas.
"It's Sam."
"We can try as many times you want."
"Light," Dean said.
hit me how bad it is until I hear him screaming.
The crying seems louder and, with a glance to make sure Cas isn’t looking, I follow the sound.
I have a house. I have a freaking kid. And I have someone I can spend it with. Who loves me. Yeah, never saw that coming.
Dean flicks his eyes over Castiel. “You just seem like the particular type, so that surprises me.”
“Thank you,” Castiel says automatically before realizing he’s wearing Dean’s. “Do you want it back?” he asks stupidly.
Dean's mind was still reeling from the dream. He hated that memory. Why did it have to resurface
Castiel is confused. Dean has nothing to do with his food and sleeping situation. "What do you mean?"
"Whatever," Dean huffed and grabbed Cas' sleeve, leading the angel to the door. "See you in a few hours." Dean paused by the door. "And Sam?"
"Do you think Sam left for good?" Dean asked.
," he called again.
"Okay," Cas said thoughtfully. "I think I will."
Because, no. No, he is not going to be okay. Not unless he can spend every day watching movies with Cas for the rest of his life. …Alright, that might be a
“You two made a mess.”
I’m damaged goods. Like, very damaged. Whenever I allowed myself to picture a life outside of Hunting, it was always like my time with Lisa. I’m with a woman I really like who really likes me back. Maybe a kid or two. I’m more at peace than I am when I’m Hunting, but it’s all sort of a façade to ignore who I really am and what I’ve done. But with Cas…
"It will be a little difficult with this." Cas grabs Dean's hand and places on his growing erection. He knows he wouldn't even be close to having this confidence while sober. He sees Dean swallow, but Dean doesn't move.
"Cas," Dean says while pointing at his cheek. "You got some, uh, there."
"So, you're completely warm again?"
Cas raises is eyebrows and smiles. "And here I thought nothing surprised you anymore."
Dean continues to scoop the rest of the mix onto the pan. His thoughts drift back to a few moments ago. Had Dean just missed his chance with Cas? ...No. Cas doesn't feel the same way. Dean likes to think he can read Cas pretty well, and he'd
Cas keeps leading them to movie after movie, and Dean thinks they’re going to be caught at some point, but they never are. They don’t hold hands again, but Dean thinks about reaching over and snatching Cas’ hand during every single movie. They spend the rest of the day there, and it’s one of the best days of Dean’s life.
“What? No. She left a few weeks ago.” Dean leans closer. “Wait, why? What were you going to do?”
Cas is asleep, but he’s thrashing on the couch. My heart jumps to my throat, and I can hardly breathe. I’ve never seen him in such anguish before.
"Where are you staying?" Dean asks quietly.
“Well, good. I look forward to hearing about it on Wednesday.”
Dean's heart sank lower than he expected. "Good." He couldn't match Cas' gaze, knowing his looks would betray what he just said.
Fuck. Well, Dean hadn't meant to ask. But he was here so, he might as well keep going. "Can they fall in love with humans?"
Dean's breath hitches and he leans in, too. There's barely any space between them now. Cas knows what this means. If he closes the space between them, their friendship is over. It will all be different after this, and it scares him. But it's also everything he wants.
"So, you're Sam's mediator now?"
Wait, that is Dean.
Dean passes the travel mug to Castiel. “It’s coffee. You can have some if you want.”
biased, but I think we’re good. But we like to take our time and just play music together as a group. I mean, that’s what it’s all about, isn’t it?”
"You're doing great." Dean traced Cas' bottom lip with his thumb. The amount of times he'd thought of doing this exact thing was countless. And the real thing was so much better than anything he'd dreamt.
Lisa waves and smiles shyly. “Hi, Dean.”
"But?"
"Okay."
Dean let go of Cas' hand and rolled over. They were inches apart. This was probably the closest they had ever been. Dean stared into Cas' eyes, taking in the moment. He'd probably never get to do this again. They stared breathlessly at each other for several seconds. Dean couldn't tell if rolling over was a mistake, or if this was the best idea he's ever had.
I’m so fucking happy.
“The one with the carrots and broccoli?” Castiel asks apprehensively. “I thought you didn’t like it. Do you like it now?”
These thoughts are swirling within Castiel’s mind as he’s riding his bike back home from the library. It’s only a fifteen minute ride, and Castiel enjoys being outside. But he’s too distracted by his thoughts that he doesn’t see the
“Oh…I mean…I will try to be performance ready by then.”
"No!" Dean didn't want the hug to end, so he held on tighter. "You're warm." It was true. Cas was like the perfect bed. Soft and warm.
And Cas forgets how to breathe. That's all he's been thinking about. He swallows. "Yeah."
"What?" Castiel asks when Dean continues to stare.
so upset?" Dean asked.
"What did they do?" Castiel asked.

"I'm fine," Dean answered quietly.
to bring it in.”
"Why?"
“Merry Christmas, Sammy.”
As I walk towards the stairs, I notice the kitchen is spotless. Cas must have cleaned
She was cute, so why not? "Yeah, actually, uh," Dean quickly read her name tag, "Christine, I would." He winked at her.
He follows a nicely dressed couple inside a big building that doesn’t look as artsy as Dean was picturing. He presents his ticket to the lady at the door scanning them with a gun-looking thingy. She scans the barcode on Dean’s ticket with a beep and tells him to have fun. He’ll try. Dean’s seat should be in the middle of the theater, and he easily finds his row, but has to awkwardly scoot past everyone who’s already seated on his way. It’s ten million times more embarrassing than at the movie theater.
Castiel stares at his phone in surprise. His hearts skips a beat. This is exciting. It’s been years since he’s been on a date. It feels…nice to have someone take interest in him. But then he frowns. She’s only seen him hungover and gross.
"Dean, stop worrying," Cas said warmly. "I'm not going anywhere."
"Sorry to interrupt," Crowley drawled with an obnoxious twinkle in his eye. "Just thought you'd want Moose back."
Dean sighed. He knew Cas' interpretation of him following Dean's instructions probably varied from what actually happened.
Castiel waits, but Dean doesn’t say more. He swallows and gets out of bed. He can’t shake the sinking feeling in his stomach that something is
Castiel nods and subconsciously grabs his injured hand, rubbing his thumb along the scar. “Yes, but I anticipate I can play beginning next week.”
"Can I get you boys anything?" a young preppy waitress chirped. She stared at them expectantly.
"Well, if it isn't my lucky day," the man drawled.

“You’ve never called him Jack before.”
in the sidewalk until it’s too late. He tries to swerve out of the way, but only manages to fall right into it. He holds out his arms to cushion his fall and there’s a loud
Castiel frowned. "How long what?"
Cas stops to contemplate this. He supposes it is. He shrugs. "I guess."
“How could I
"Yeah," Dean heard himself answer before he realized he had spoken. It was all happening so fast, and he could tell his grip on time wasn't exactly right. Maybe he was a bit drunk. But, did it matter? He was having fun and felt better than he had in a long time.
