Castiel’s answer is nearly inaudible, but Dean can just make out, “
“Yeah,” the angel grunts.
“Yeah, we can talk later! What the fuck, dude?! How’re you gonna get down?” The section of roof that Cas is on is unsettlingly narrow. If he were to fall, Dean thinks, he probably wouldn’t die, but it’s definitely high enough to break an ankle or worse.
His nurse brings him lunch sometime later, releasing him from the restraints, but he isn’t hungry.
“Yeah.”
way I ever wanted Sam to find out about us,” Dean groans. “Shit. I gotta go talk to him.”
“Bobby? It’s Dean, sorry to bother you so late,” Dean rushes to say, relieved that his boss picked up the phone.
Me back again…
” Castiel curses. Dean just laughs, thoroughly amused.
“Oh,” Cas lets out a surprised breath. “You don’t mind?”
“His name is Cas,” Dean says, trying to keep his voice steady, “he’s my boyfriend.”
“Uh, I dunno, Cas, maybe sometimes?” he replies unhelpfully. Castiel huffs and sinks dramatically back into his pillow.
"I just got off the phone with your mother," Missouri begins to explain, and Castiel feels like his stomach has been dropped into a bucket of ice water, but he nods as she continues. "She said that your father will be here tomorrow morning to pick you up." Nothing could be further from "good news" in Cas's mind.
"I'm sorry," Cas says quickly, still smiling.
"I'll look forward to that," Cas replies with another sniff.
“I don’t think so,” Sam sobs, “there’s a lot of blood everywhere. Please hurry!”
“Do you know their names?” Cas presses on.
touch you... especially given your… condition.” Castiel grits his teeth. There are a million words crowding his mouth, at the tip of his tongue, begging to be set loose, but he manages to hold back for fear of where his father is taking this whole thing.
“I guess anything’s possible,” she shrugs, “wouldn’t know, personally; I’m gay for lots of women.”
Finally, Cas and Dean find themselves back in the Impala in the parking lot, where Dean lets out a long sigh, resting his forehead briefly on the steering wheel between his two hands.
“Ah, well,” Dean sighs, his breathing seeming at least to have returned to normal. The two sit quietly for a few minutes until Dean speaks up again.
“You wouldn’t understand,” Dean manages, answering John’s original question as he hauls himself to his feet, wishing he were just a little taller so he could truly stand eye to eye with his old man.
“Yeah? What way?”
" he continues, an edge creeping into his voice, "he would value your 'friendship' a little more if you weren't constantly torturing him."
“How many partners, and of which gender, have you had in the past year?” Leah continues professionally.
Cas and Dean brush their teeth before turning the bathroom over to Sam. As Sam gets in the shower, Dean dries Castiel’s hair with a towel before helping him remove his wet jeans and flannel shirt. In tee shirts and boxers, the pair collapse into bed, Cas with a long, satisfied sigh.
“Cas,” Dean murmurs, scooting closer, so his body is flush with Castiel’s side, “would you think it’s fucked up if I told you it turned me on? You takin’ it so well, ’cause you trust me,” he elaborates, and Cas’s cheeks turn pink as his breath hitches.
to be causing this."
on it, which is the one Zeppelin song he is already familiar with. Next, he adds a compilation album:
and his little brother already paid for it.
“S’ not stupid,” Dean asserts, “meant a lot to me too.”
“Wasn’t thinking straight,” Dean murmurs, “was a mistake.” The words feel all too little, too late, but anything more substantial eludes him.
"Portland, Oregon."
He has completed a sizeable pentagram, the width of the hallway outside the bedroom door, and is studying the sigils that are to circle it when Sam enters the front door.
“Will you -,” Cas begins hesitantly.
“Well, is there something wrong with me? Did I wreck my liver or something?” Dean inquires impatiently.
“Dean?” Castiel questions, voice rough and low.
“You’re awesome too, Dean,” Cas says sincerely.
Once Cas is thoroughly washed and rinsed, Dean quickly washes himself before shutting the water off. He reaches out of the shower, grabbing a towel and begins to dry Castiel, rubbing him all over, ruffling his hair before wrapping the towel around Castiel’s shoulders and kissing him gently. Cas stares at him as Dean grabs another towel and begins to dry himself.
“Oh, well, I don’t mind. Just used to being fucked with, I guess. But, hey,” Cas says, “ I got some new music to listen to.” He tosses his iPod to Dean so he can scroll through the track lists.
“Dean, why do you get up so fast whenever another person is at the door?” Castiel asks one morning over breakfast.
“Yeah, I get it, Cas,” he says, wandering into the kitchen where he pulls a bag of frozen peas out of the freezer, wrapping it in a towel. “This should help some,” he says, resting the makeshift ice pack gently across Castiel’s ankle. “I’ll grab you some Tylenol or something too, hold on a sec,” he adds, heading down the hallway. He pauses before stepping into the bathroom. The last time he was in here, he had decided to end it all. For a moment, he takes a deep breath, thankful it hadn’t ended the way he had planned.
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" John asked, clearly irritated.
Against all odds, Dean manages to heft Castiel into the back seat before running back up to the room for a blanket, his gun, and one of the fake IDs he'd left on the nightstand. Back in the Impala, he throws the blanket over Castiel's near-lifeless form and peels out of the parking lot, cranking the heat in an attempt to keep the angel's body temperature up.
“Dunno,” he mutters.
“Just do it. Just end this,” Dean begs, trembling on his knees, his brother’s body still held tightly in his arms. “Just, spare Cas. Please. Spare Cas.” And Dean watches helplessly as the demon wearing Cas’s body raises the knife above him, freezing for a moment, and then plunges it into its own belly,
It's gonna be a drag, misery
“What are you afraid of?” Dean asks when Cas pauses.
"Well, I have never seen anything like this," she says at last. "If it weren't for the temperature, I would give you a clean bill of health and tell you you're free to go. As it stands, however, I would be remiss if I did not urge you to be seen immediately in the emergency department."
“I know, Sammy, I want that too, but I don’t want you gettin’ hurt again.” Dean can hear Sam sniffling on the other line, which causes the onset of his own damn tears.
“Cas, I’m still standing right here, but sure,” Dean says, rolling his eyes before walking across the room to start pulling stuff out of the mini-fridge.
“Well, thanks,” Castiel says, “I’m not usually satisfied with my drawings, but I think this one is turning out alright.”
“I’m not acting weird,” Dean replies through clenched teeth.
“Okay,” Cas breathes, nodding quickly.
“Dean...” Cas utters softly, but he doesn’t know where he’s going with it. Instead, he scoots closer, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder, and they sit in silence for the rest of the ride.
So Cas jams his earbuds into his ears and slams his head back into his pillow, gazing up into the darkness.
“Oh, child,” she sighs dramatically, “it’s not even breakfast time yet!”
“What?” Dean says with his mouth full. Cas just rolls his eyes and shakes his head, grinning. “Whatever,” Dean smirks, “you
“It’s you…well, me…And you.” Castiel struggles for the words, his brow furrowed, a look of confusion etched across his face. “They warned me…about getting too close to you, Dean.”
jealous…” Cas submits then.
"Castiel," Missouri replies, concern knit into her brow, "I'm surprised! I thought you would be glad to get out of here." Cas just shrugs. "Why don't you want to go home?"
“I dunno, but my parents want me
“Sorry, you two, but you’re needed back downstairs, Sam,” she says apologetically. “The doctor wants to check you out once more, make sure those meds are wearing off alright before sending you home.” Sam sniffs and nods, finally letting go of his older brother.
“Yeah, Cas, I’ll be fine. I’m sure you’ve had enough of hanging around medical buildings anyway. Wouldn’t you rather stay here and rest?” Dean says, giving Cas a reassuring kiss.
right?” Dean says dryly.
“Hey, Sammy, that wouldn’t be the same John Day where you threw a bitch fit when dad wouldn’t stop at that fossil thing, would it?” Dean teases; he knows it is.
Most of this is going over Dean's head, but he knows Sam is taking it all in and will be glad to explain it all to him in obnoxious detail later.
have control over, and
“Yeah, Cas, ‘course I am,” Dean manages to say more confidently than he feels. “It’s just complicated. They don’t exactly make ‘Hey little brother, I’m fucking an angel’ greeting cards, you know?” Dean attempts to joke, which Castiel, of course, doesn’t understand.
“Jesus, Dean!” Bobby replies, “what happened? I’ve been calling your house and your cell phone, and no one’s picking up either line.”
"Alright," Sam sighs, putting a hand on his brother's shoulder, "I'll get a room and text you with the details in case you change your mind. But, please, don't put all this on yourself. You can't protect everyone from everything." Dean nods stiffly and Sam turns to leave.
"I understand the feeling," Cas says, "I just hope you don't get sick of hearing me complain about my shitty family."
“As you wish, princess,” Dean says, kicking his shoes off and rolling his eyes.
for God knows how long. He can't let that happen. He needs to be here when Dean is released. He resolves to call and ask to speak with Dean as soon as he regains the ability to move.
“Really, Dean?” Sam says.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas replies, and Dean lets out an audible sigh of relief.
Castiel can’t even look at him. He sinks to a seat on the bed instead, tears flooding his eyes as shame burns his face. He buries his face in his hands.
“You haven’t ejaculated yet,” Cas says calmly, moving to kiss Dean again as he gropes at the front of Dean’s pants.
“For my part, I will try to be quieter the next time Dean and…” Cas begins.
“Uhh, I dunno if I’m allowed,” Dean stumbles over his words.
“I mean, don’t you feel like maybe you’re taking advantage of him?”
As they stand in the hallway, they are both struck by the likelihood that this is "goodbye." Cas ducks into his room for a second, reemerging with two sheets of paper in his hands. He hands them to Dean.
“Oh, Sammy’s always getting scraped up. I love the kid, but he’s a damn clutz. Probably ’cause his legs are growing like five times too fast,” Dean laughs, and Cas manages a smile. “Speaking of that, I got an old bandage from when he hurt his knee playing soccer. I’d like to try wrapping your ankle up with it.” Cas nods gratefully. “Also, uh, I wanted to make sure your, um, other cuts are okay...” Dean says hesitantly. He can feel Cas tense beneath his fingers. “I know they’re in an awkward area, and I don’t wanna make you do anything you’re not comfortable with; I’m just worried. An infection is really the last thing you need right now with everything else you’re going through.” Dean feels Cas beginning to tremble harder, and he feels awful about it. “I’m sorry, Cas, really. If you’d rather take care of them yourself, I understand; just as long as it’s being taken care of. Trust me, this isn’t exactly how I’d like to get your pants off for the first time,” he attempts to joke, and he actually hears Cas huff a small laugh. Turning Cas to face him, Dean asks, “what do you want? What do you feel okay with?”
“M’sorry, Dean,” Cas sighs, tears springing to his eyes.
“Well, she was
“Hah! No,” Dean snorts, “she’s got Ativan; it’s for anxiety and should help you sleep.”
“I hope that starts to feel better soon,” Dean says softly.
“Oh, hi sugar, speak of the devil!” she says warmly after a moment, a grin spreading across her face as she looks up at Dean. “Now I don’t suppose you are calling to speak to the young man who happens to be standing here at my desk asking about you, are you?” Dean flushes bright red, but his heart leaps at the same time.
Dean looks exhausted, and Castiel wonders again why Dean is here. He finds himself staring at the bandages on Dean’s arms. It seems like maybe Dean notices, because he abruptly stands, returns his tray, and exits, leaving Castiel feeling like shit. He really hopes it was a coincidence, but he fears that it isn’t.
"Let's go warm up," Dean suggests, knowing Cas is likely tired as well as cold and wet. Cas smiles at the suggestion, and the pair walk closely side by side, hand in hand back toward their room.
could see us! You’ll go to jail, and my life will be over,” Cas bursts out.
“Yeah, Dean, I’ll be fine. Not like I’ve never hunted on my own before,” Sam replies, fighting the urge to be irritated by Dean’s overly protective nature. “You and Cas gonna be alright without me for a little while?”
“I guess it isn’t too different from mankind,” Cas replies in an oddly lighter tone. “Although humans reproduce, they will cease to exist at some point as well.”
“Got you some bitch beers in the fridge,” Dean laughs.
First, he shakes a generous amount of salt out in a line across the bedroom door before pouring another line along the windowsill. Tossing the empty salt container aside, he flips through his records until he reaches Zepplin’s first album. From within the record sleeve, he retrieves a sheet of paper on which he has drawn out detailed sigils and markings. Slipping his hand gently between his mattress and boxspring, he rapidly finds and withdraws a small bronze amulet on a leather cord. He carefully slips it over Cas’s head without waking him before returning to the hallway, where he vigorously shakes the can of white paint, studying the paper he holds in his other hand.
? That can’t be right. Cas is lonely, or at least that’s what he said. His humanity must be fucking with his head, making him want some sort of partner, and Dean is the only person around. He guesses that makes sense. Dean doesn’t figure Cas has ever been in a human-type romantic relationship. Do angels even fall in love with each other or have sex or anything? Dean doesn’t think so, but again, he’s been too self-centered to think to ask.
“I wanna be fuckin’ left alone,” Dean growls. Sadly, Castiel retreats, returning to his own room and shutting the door. He tries not to take Dean’s words personally. Meg had reported gleefully that Dean had had some sort of outburst earlier, something to do with his brother. Still, Dean’s words sting. Castiel doesn’t know what he expected. They’d had one conversation; it isn’t like they’re close. Maybe Dean felt like one conversation was enough.
“Dean, what’s a hipster?” Castiel asks seriously.
“I’m at my best with one drink in me,” Dean deflects, winking at Cas. The whole situation is
He made a little money at pool before a couple of guys started asking questions he didn’t care to answer. It was time to move on, he decided. As he was making for the back door, however, a rough hand caught his forearm.
“No, there was, but it wasn’t started the way Dad says it was; it was a demon.” Sam looks shaken, unsure what to believe. He always believes Dean; he
“Sorry. You don’t have to tell me.” But something about the look on Castiel’s face seems to change Dean’s tone.”
“Cas, I think Sammy’s in danger,” Dean manages to get out.
"Yeah!" Cas responds, probably too enthusiastically, he thinks, Dean's definitely gonna figure out he's into him. "I'd really like that." It seems like Castiel's tears may actually be drying for a moment, so the two head to breakfast.
“When it started, yeah,” Cas admits quietly.
"Alright," she answers, her tone serious, "to be perfectly blunt, the fact that your brother is still alive right now is, well, almost miraculous." Sam and Dean exchange looks, knowing the doctor's words are probably far more accurate than she realizes.
“Good,” Dean says simply. “You want some coffee?”
he thinks to himself after a quick rummage through the cabinets.
When Dean climbs into bed next to Cas, he is startled when Castiel practically pounces on him, burying his face in Dean’s neck, his arm flung over Dean’s chest. Dean doesn’t push him off though, he just laughs softly, reaching over with his free arm to turn out the light.
“Oh, yeah that’s good,” Cas says simply. He had completely forgotten about the tests amid everything else.
“Cariño,” she sighs, brushing the hair back from his forehead. Castiel can see tears forming in her eyes. “I don’t understand. Was it your father?”
"Yeah," Dean agrees, and then he admits something else. "Cas, I really would have liked to talk to you last night. I'd been hoping I'd get to talk to you soon." Cas is quiet on the other end of the line, and sounds a little breathless when he finally says something.
“Apparently you aren’t supposed to have your bare foot on some dude’s crotch under the table during craft time,” she says gleefully, flipping her curly hair over her shoulder. “I still don’t know who narced, but if I find out…”
“Cas, I’m so sorry,” Dean gasps, “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“Uh, Cas?” he says softly. Cas mumbles something from under the pillow that Dean can’t make out. “I brought you some water and a couple more pills. Should help with the headache.” With another pained sound, Cas struggles to sit up, head hanging. Dean doesn’t blame him for avoiding eye contact. As Cas drinks the water, Dean returns to the table for the food and coffee.
"Sugar, you look like a trout. Do you have something you want to ask?"
“What do you want?” he asks harshly, knowing it’s too soon to be Missouri.
Castiel rolling his eyes.
“Great. What about alcohol? How many alcoholic beverages do you consume in a week?”
"Hey, Dean," Sam says, finally, "when's the last time you slept?"
"Naomi, I am sorry," Zachariah says to his sister, "but it appears that I have failed in my many attempts."
“Good,” Dean says, washing his hands. “Wait here for a minute before following me out,” he adds with a wink. Cas nods.
“Oh, Cas. What happened to you?” Dean’s voice barely escapes him as he gazes at his suffering friend. Castiel’s naked torso appears thin and frail; he seems much smaller than usual, hardly like an angel at all.
,” she chuckles.
The next time Dean opens his eyes, early morning light is seeping through the blinds. Cas is breathing softly, sleeping peacefully curled against Dean’s side, and for maybe the first time, Dean tries to push all the doubt from his mind and simply enjoy the quiet moment. Cas is a warm, familiar presence, and Dean has to admit that waking up with him beats the hell out of waking up cold and alone, and what’s so damn bad about that?
About ten minutes later, they are pulling up to a quaint little beach-town inn. Dean leaves Cas in the car to go check in. If he were honest with himself, he would acknowledge the fact that he still isn't ready to check in with Cas at his side like they're a couple of goddamn newlyweds; instead, he tells himself Cas still needs rest.
“Yeah, actually I could go for some food, but after the past few days on the road, I’d kinda like a salad.”
Carefully, Sam crawls into the backseat of the Impala, locks all the doors, and curls up with his blanket and pillow. Being a teenage boy, Dean has left plenty of junk in the backseat, including an old sweatshirt. Sam would never admit it, but he buries his face in that sweatshirt; it smells like Dean, and it calms him, if only a little. Sam shifts a little and feels a lump in his pocket. It’s his cell phone.
"Exactly. We've talked about this. Most humans don't believe in angels and demons, and even the ones who do, would probably think you're crazy if you claimed to see one, let alone,
“Yeah… who needs plans though? In my experience they usually fall through anyway,” Dean responds casually.
“Yeah, she’s a little crazy.”
“Meg, don’t!” Castiel says threateningly through gritted teeth.
At last, the day arrives, and Cas is going home, although “home” probably isn’t the right word for a cheap motel room containing a small table, two chairs, two queen beds, a mini fridge, and a bathroom; but he is not alone, and really, isn’t that the important aspect of “home?”
“Alright, almost done,” Leah continues. “Do you feel safe at home and in your relationships?”
“Yeah,” Dean says, “listen, I uh, was having a hard time last night, and… it was nice having someone there. Was nice talking to you.” Castiel smiles broadly like he can’t help himself. “So, if I can ever return the favor…” Dean trails off.
“Huh? When?” Cas asks, confused.
“Well, you better make your move quick, Cassie; I won’t be able to control myself for long…” Meg grins at him.
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Castiel agrees.
“I’ve known Bobby for years, Cas. He came and picked me up from the hospital when my dad wouldn’t pick up the damn phone. He’s a good guy, believe me.”
“Shut your damn faggot mouth!” John shouts as he grabs Dean by the throat, pinning him up against the wall again.
“Oh, okay,” Sam replies, smiling a little at Cas.
“I’m sorry I’m so fucked up, ok?” Dean says with an edge in his voice he didn’t intend. As he gazes at Castiel, the bruises he left stand out dark on Cas’s pale neck and chest, and he feels like shit for letting himself get so carried away.
When he finds the ICU, Dean is directed to yet another waiting area and is told he'll be notified as soon as his brother arrives and is ready to be seen. He finally accepts a cup of coffee. Emily was right; it sucks. But it's hot, and it's technically coffee.
“Fish,” Dean tells Cas, as they approach the front door, “is almost a vegetable.”
“You’d better. Now, what time is it, anyway?”
“Fine,” John huffs, crossing his arms, “I’ll get out for now, but I want you out of here before I return tonight. I mean it, Dean. Pack your shit, take your
“Yeah?”
Once, what now seems like a long time ago, Castiel had gone looking for Dean. Upon locating him, Cas had appeared abruptly in Dean’s motel room, at the side of his bed, like usual, only that time Dean happened to be watching some sort of porno with his dick in his hand. Cas didn’t understand what made Dean so furious, but something did.
“Awesome! Thanks, Cas. You know,” Dean says, “even if it doesn’t work out, I’m still really grateful you even thought to try. I don’t have a lot of people offering to try and help me.”
“Fuck, yeah it does, angel,” Dean moans in reply, picking up his pace, grinding his hips against Cas as he continues to jerk them both off.
“I… I don’t… I’m so sorry Cas,” Dean chokes out as he clenches his jaw, trying desperately not to let his tears fall.
“You are remarkable,” Cas adds plainly, continuing to study Dean’s face with his gaze.
"And if I want a shot of bourbon?" Dean half-smiles at the young woman with a hint of that Dean-Winchester charm.
“What happened this time?”
“Speak for yourself, Sammy,” Dean retorts.
“Hey, you know you can hike to the top, right?” Dean and Cas turn to see a petite red-headed woman with intricate tattoos up and down her arms smiling bemusedly at them. “Sorry, couldn’t help but overhear. Only 11 switchbacks and you’re up there,” she adds, winking.
“Us, Cas. The kiss… you know the other night when you… and last night. I mean, what… we’re not, I mean, we can’t be a
“I could change that,” Dean’s susurrant voice states as Castiel’s mind struggles to keep pace. “Want me to?” Dumbstruck, Cas gives a quick jerk of his head, a tiny nod meant to convey
.” Quickly, he runs around to help Cas out of the car. Cas attempts to put some weight on his ankle, but immediately regrets the decision, yelping and stumbling into Dean again. Dean supports him on the injured side, and they clumsily make their way up to the front door.
“Fuck, yeah, that’ll do it,” Dean gasps, leaning his head back against the shower wall. Of course getting head is
“Cas, what happened? What’s wrong?” But Cas only shakes his head, unable to formulate a sentence. Dean settles in next to him then, sitting quietly, rubbing Cas’s back as he continues to shake.
“Well,” he clears his throat. He can’t believe he’s gonna do this. “So I’ve always been into chicks, you know? I’ve had a few girlfriends that lasted for a little while, and I’ve hooked up with a lot of women I never saw again, and I’m still into women, don’t get me wrong, but...” Dean pauses for a moment, trying to figure out where he’s going with this, sure Billie is completely thrown by how out of left field this whole topic is.
"Maybe you should see Missouri," Cas suggests.
“Sure,” Castiel replies, again trying his best to seem casual, like a regular friend who
“Thanks. That’s reassuring,” Dean says sardonically. They sit in silence for a while, traffic finally moving as Dean heads east on 84 toward the Columbia River Gorge. It’s a beautiful day, cool and sunny. As they leave Portland behind, the traffic thins, and Dean can begin to appreciate the scenery. The Columbia River is vast, Washington State seeming rather far away though it’s just on the other side. Amid the evergreen tree covered hills, there are pops of red and yellow: maples and oaks in their fall colors. The hills grow steeper as they continue east, forming cliffs that tower above the highway. Every so often, the trees part and Dean can spot a waterfall pouring down the side of the rock wall.
?" Castiel asks pointedly.
“Now, you take as much time as you need to get yourself back together, but whenever you’re ready to come back to work, you let me know, ‘kay?”
“Yeah, Cas?” Dean replies, voice low and rough. “How’re you feeling?”
"Try to get some rest," Dean breathes against Castiel's temple as he pulls the thick comforter up over both of them. Cas sighs contentedly, curling up against Dean's chest.
Slowly, Dean works at Cas’s shirt, one button at a time. He’d never admit it, but the task is made more difficult not only by his stupid injury, but by the trembling of his hands, all nerves and excitement. This is all so new. Dean thinks he can feel Cas’s body trembling too.
“Cas,” Dean says softly. Castiel stirs, face nuzzling into Dean’s chest. Cas inhales deeply, smelling Dean and smilingly, eyes still lightly closed. It hurts Dean to end this. “Cas,” he repeats, and Castiel’s eyes flutter open, looking up at him. “Morning, angel,” Dean says almost wistfully. He sits ups, pushing Cas up too. “We should probably get back on the road,” he says to Cas, avoiding the subject that really needs to be broached. Dean pulls his tee shirt on as Cas sits motionless, wide blue eyes fixed on him, questioningly. Dean sighs heavily, falling back against the seat, leaning his head back and rubbing his face. He fights the tears in his eyes, groaning. “Cas,” he breathes, blinking up at the roof of the Impala.
"Really?" Cas asks, sniffing and wide-eyed.
"Go away, Meg!" comes a pissed off voice from within, and Dean has to smile to himself.
“What am I supposed to do with the holy water?” he queries.
“I’m sorry, Bobby. I’m sorry; I should have called you sooner, it’s just been so…” Dean trails off fighting the tears in his eyes.
“Awesome,” he says softly, and Dean, completely absorbed in the simple joy on Cas’s face, has to agree.
“Sugar? You still there?” Missouri asks after a moment.
My writing about anti-depressant discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal) comes from personal experience. Back in 2016 I foolishly stopped taking my medication without weaning off of it, a common occurrence that happens when people think "oh, I feel better now, so I don't need this anymore." Well, it was abso-fucking-lutely awful. Calling out "sick" to work because you literally can't stop crying or get out of bed is embarrassing, so of course, I lied and "had the flu" that week. I am extremely grateful for my partner who amazingly stuck with me even though we hadn't been dating that long; he drove an hour each way to come be with me when I couldn't crawl out of bed or feed myself. Five years later, we recently got engaged, so happy ending to that tale of woe.
“You like that, Cas?” Dean grins as Castiel continues to grope him.
"Yeah, of course," Dean says. "Cas, talking to you is the one thing that gets me out of my own head."
“Dean?” Sam whispers eventually.
Dean grabs a blanket and helps Cas to the couch, settling him on one end.
"So, you're saying there's a chance he'll be back to normal. And worst-case scenario?" Sam questions, knowing Dean needs to know, but is hesitant to ask.
“You are the one who wanted to clarify things, Dean; I am sorry if you are not mature enough to handle non colloquial terminology. I can just say ‘fuck,’ if that would make you more comfortable,” he offers with a raised eyebrow.
you see?” Dean asks hesitantly.
"Pardon?" Sara’s eyes are wide.
“Yeah?” Cas breathes, “what exactly did you have in mind? I think I’ve had enough pain and/or danger for one day...”
"Yeah?" Dean asks, raising his eyebrow. "Like where?"
Eventually they rejoin the newer, larger highway 84. As they travel further east, the cliff sides become less steep, and the trees begin to thin. Eventually they are surrounded by treeless, rolling hills and lava rock outcroppings. They can see vineyards across the river on the Washington side. When they come to Biggs, an ironically small town, Dean leaves highway 84, taking the long bridge across the river into Washington. The bridge is tall enough that large barges pushed by tug boats can pass beneath, carrying whatever it is they carry, and Dean can feel a stiff wind trying to shove the Impala this way and that. Once in Washington, the road climbs steeply up and up until they are once again looking down on the river. Soon, Dean is turning, pulling onto a gravel road, dust billowing up behind them.
"He can't help you, you know," a voice says from across the room, snapping Dean's head up.
Dean asks, and Cas has to fight the urge to snap at him, exasperated.
Moments after the injection, Castiel’s eyes soften and he seems to sink back in his pillows, his body releasing much of the tension it had evidently been holding.  Sara reminds him once more to alert her when the pain begins to return, and Castiel nods his understanding before letting his eyes fall gently closed. Before she leaves, she gestures to Dean, indicating that she’d like to speak with him outside for a moment.
Cas agrees and they return to the Impala. Dean jogs ahead and opens the passenger door for Cas, who laughs softly.
I won't see her no more
“Hah!” Dean scoffs, “good luck keeping ‘your roof’ at all without me. I’m the reason the fuckin’ lights are on.”
,” Dean says hoarsely.
"That's great," Dean says to Cas, though Cas looks crestfallen at the prospect of spending
“Cas is the only one who earned pancakes,” Dean teases, raising an eyebrow, “you were spared for being ‘too young.’” Sam shoots him an epic bitch-face from the back seat. “Sammy, I’m just kidding,” Dean relents, and Sam looks happier.
“I assure you, Dean, that I am
“Cas, I’m so sorry,” Dean rushes to say as the brothers nearly tumble through the room door. To their surprise, Cas isn’t alone.
“About Cas,” she glares, “do you ‘like’ like him?”
“This is more important,” Dean snaps. When he looks back up at Sam, he sees dread in his eyes. Sighing, Dean pauses his work. “I’m sorry, Sammy, didn’t mean to sound like that. Just tryin’ to keep you and Cas safe.” This does little to nothing for Sam’s anxiety.
"Oh, sugar," she sighs, clicking her tongue. Cas shifts uncomfortably under her gaze, his eyes remaining fixed on the floor. "Castiel," Missouri sighs again, and Cas begins to grow impatient waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“If you drink enough,” Dean answers, helping Cas off with his shoes as he sits on the edge of the bed. Suddenly, Castiel leans forward, wrapping his arms around Dean, who stiffens in surprise.
"I think my body wants to do other things," Cas murmurs against Dean's tee shirt.
"Nah, I don't think so," Dean replies. "I mean, before he went unconscious, he said it was 'other angels'."
As Castiel is turning to walk into his own room, however, he hears what sounds like a strange, muffled scream, followed by the sound of a person gasping for air. Castiel rushes to Dean’s door, freezing in the doorframe. Dean is sitting on the edge of his bed, facing away from the door, struggling to catch his breath.
“Yeah, I know, crazy,” Bobby replies, “I know the description of the car was off, just the plates sounded familiar, so I was curious.” Dean groans.
“It’s gonna be okay,” Dean says, trying to sound confident, “as soon as I’m out of here, I’ll figure something out.” Sam nods and leans back in, tightening his grip again. Then there is a gentle knock on the door, and Missouri enters, smiling at the brothers, Sam, apparently not ready to let go.
"You sure as fuck do!" Dean shouts, standing abruptly, "I'm not the crazy one, you psychotic fucking bitch!" Before he knows what is happening, every eye in the room is fixed on him, and you could hear a pin drop, then he is being ushered down the hallway by two security guards.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says.
“Dean, do you find homosexuality shameful?”
Before Sam can reach for the doorknob, Dean catches him in a tight hug. Sam reciprocates.
“It’s not a bad thing,” Dean replies, “just means you get me excited and also make me nervous cuz I don’t wanna fuck this up.”
"Anna, anorexic. Kind rhymes," Dean chuckles, and Cas gives him a weird look. "I'm sorry. I know; it's not funny-" Then Dean looks up again. "Oh god, they're coming over here."
you know?” Cas doesn’t know. He has a difficult time understanding; the thought of taking a sharp instrument to his own arm gives him chills. He doesn’t think he’d be capable of cutting his own skin on purpose.
"I would say, that sounds great," Cas answers with a broad smile.
“Hmm, yeah, I guess that’s funny, Cas,” Dean had answered.
If he had been panicked before, it’s nothing compared to the panic that consumes him now. It’s paralyzing, the thought that his own mind could turn on him. All his life, the only thing Dean knew he could rely on had been himself, and now he is doubting his own grip on reality, and it is utterly terrifying.
“Oh, Cas,” Dean replies quickly, wrapping his arms around him again, “you didn’t do anything wrong. None of this is your fault. I’m just a broken piece of shit.”
“Cas?” Dean whispers, and Castiel blinks up at him in the dark. Dean slides a hand slowly up the side of Cas’s neck, his thumb gently massaging Cas’s jaw.
Slowly, Dean’s mind returns to the present where Castiel is sleeping peacefully at his side, and he’s hit with another pang of guilt and anger.  He hasn’t spoken to his father in years, and
“Well, then what?” Dean replies, deflated.
The day crawls by with no return call from John. Dean even talks to Sam, who says he hasn’t seen their dad in a few days. It isn’t until after dinner that Dean has an idea. Reluctantly, Missouri agrees.
“Don’t blame ‘em,” Dean replies with a cold laugh.
“Fine! If you leave now, you’re out! Out of the will, no trust fund, nothing! And don’t even think about coming back,” Zachariah threatens, Cas’s mother, now out on the lawn as well, nodding in agreement.
Dean runs his tongue unconsciously over his own lip. He tastes salt: Cas’s tears, Cas’s fear-induced sweat. He can hear Castiel’s breath catch as he raises both hands to Cas’s neck. Dean’s heart is thumping in his chest so hard, he almost wonders if Cas can hear it. This is a bad idea, a part of his mind tells him, but he can’t stop this time; he could see the want in Castiel’s eyes all day, and while part of him tried to ignore it, another, stronger part of himself was drawn in by it.
"Good. Keep that chin up, sugar. I know everything looks pretty bleak now; growin' up is rough, but it gets better. You're a talented, interesting, sweet, caring young man. Eventually you'll find lots of people who appreciate that." Castiel manages a weak smile at that, though he has his doubts.
“Well... this is all confidential, right?”
“Dean, we’ve been over this. It’s not your fault,” Castiel replies, eyes still focused on the river.
"Why can't Missouri walk in on
“Your
“Dean, everything you do, you do for other people; you aren’t a selfish person. You’ve done so much for me, and I know how much you have sacrificed for Sam,” Cas says quietly. “Nobody is perfect.”
"Ugh, fine," Meg shrugs, "see you around!"
Cas curls in on himself, pulling the blankets around tightly, but he’s still cold, still shivering. He feels like vomiting again, but there’s nothing left to come up, so instead, he sobs into his pillow. His head hurts, his chest hurts,
“Okay,” Castiel says, opening the door fully, but he won’t make eye contact. Dean steps into the room, glancing around. Cas has taped drawings up all over his walls. Most of the drawings seem to be of a young Paul McCartney, but there are others too. Dean steps closer to inspect an intricately drawn flower with a honey bee landing on it.
"Weird dreams?" John asked, exasperated.
"Wow! That was quick!" Sara says in greeting before leading them into an unoccupied room. She explains that she needs to speak with them briefly before they go in to see their brother.
"Dean, co-"
“Yes, Dean,” Castiel nearly whispers, “my grace.”
“Oh,” Dean says, his brow furrowing, “Cas, what’s going on?”
“‘Course you did,” Dean grins.
“I ran out of my prescription a day or two ago, and I couldn’t get it refilled.”
“Oooh, this girl got a name?”
“What?”
“Wouldn’t be here if I was that good,” Dean responds darkly.
“Yeah, yeah, hope it helps. You free to drop by the shop tonight after closing?”
“Oh, oh fuck, Dean, I’m so close, oh Dean,” Cas begins moaning.
” Cas groans. "Did you
“Cas only knows me a little better than you do, which is not at all.”
“Goodnight, Dean,” he replies, “night, Missouri.” And he crosses the hall, shutting himself inside his room to, no doubt, mull over their conversation for hours.
was. Whatever it was, it was bad. It was really fucking bad. So… Cas
“Yeah. They’re real,” Dean says quietly, averting his gaze and scratching at the bandages on his left arm.
“Don’t wanna talk about it,” Dean replies petulantly, “just drive.”
“Why don’t you take a shower, and then we find some breakfast around here?” Dean suggests and Cas nods. “Holler if you need anything,” he adds as Cas slowly walks to the bathroom.
two and a half times his age. Dude was skinny though, and Dean knew how to fight, and refused to let some punk mess with him.
“Cas!” Dean interrupts, “no, I don’t want you to go anywhere!” And Dean knew that was the truth. “Cas, when you were in the hospital, before you woke up, I was a friggin’ mess. Ask Sammy! So, no, I’m not leaving, and I’m not telling you to leave. Hear me?”
“I know. I’ve already asked so much, but I’d like to call my boss. Let him know why I disappeared without notice.”
going to the hospital," he adds suddenly through gritted teeth.
“I’ll order pizza with whatever you want on
“I’m Dean, and this is Cas,” Dean replies.
“It’s just, you really think it’s a good idea? I mean, Cas is in a very fragile place.”
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean says softly, ruffling Sam’s hair as the kid nearly wrings the breath out of him.
“No,” he says truthfully, “I’m his friend, Cas.”
“Do what?”
“Dean?” Sam questions urgently, “what happened out there?” But Dean remains motionless. The only sound in the room is the familiar hiss of Dean’s old record player. It has reached the end of the album. The stench of whiskey and vomit pervades the air, and a sinking feeling seizes Sam. He struggles to breathe, a vice-like pressure crushing his chest.
“Thanks for everything, Cas,” Dean says softly. “Stay safe.” Castiel looks confused, but nods before turning sadly to follow the man who must be his father. Dean watches with a feeling of despair as they exit through the door at the end of the hallway, disappearing from view.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says, “I understand if you want me to go.” But Cas looks up at him then, dark circles under his bloodshot eyes. He looks almost as bad as he did that first time Dean saw him in the ICU, and Dean is taken aback.
Cas mutters under his breath, and Meg rolls her eyes.
“Oh, I apologize. I didn’t realize I was-“
“Thanks, Dean,” Cas replies. “It’s stupid, really, I was just… Meg always embarrasses me. I mean, we’re kind of friends I guess. She’s fun sometimes, but she’s pretty irritating too.” Dean laughs softly.
"Sure, Cas, what is it?"
"Thanks for being so damn patient with me; so much more than I deserve. I was such..." Dean trails off, his voice becoming choked by emotion.
“Anyway, Dean, I uh, think I found a case out in central Oregon. Haunting. Nothing too out of the ordinary,” Sam says, oblivious to the irony in his own words. “I was thinking I’d head out there and check it out. Give you and Cas a little more space. Figured you two would stay near the hospital for a little while at least.”
“Do you mind telling me what all he did?” Dean asks, “I mean, obviously, you don’t have to; just wanna understand.” Cas looks up at him again.
“Yes, she is,” he replies with that cocky Dean Winchester grin, patting the top of the car with his hand before reaching out to take the rose bush from Cas, placing it in the car.  Then he offers his hand to Castiel, helping him stand. The aide wishes them well and Dean walks Cas to the passenger’s side door, opening it for him. Cas slides into the seat with a groan and Dean shuts the door before circling back to the driver’s side. When he climbs back into the car, Dean turns to look at Cas for a moment, a hand on his shoulder.
things to worry about; either way, it's a refreshing change of pace.
“Wow,” Cas says, awed, “have you ever been to one?”
"You wanna take a nap before dinner?" Dean asks, seeing the fatigue written across Castiel's face.
"Rob," she begins, "your brother is out of surgery. He remains sedated, but he is stable." Dean exhales heavily, a little tension leaving his shoulders.
"Yeah, it is nice," Cas agrees. "Gotta say, though, I
“Actually, that sounds kinda nice,” Cas replies.
“No, thank you,” Cas says quietly. Dean lays down then, rolling onto his side, away from Cas before turning off the lamp on the bedside table.
"Yes," he says. "Can I talk to Missouri?"
-Black Sabbath (from the self-titled song, off the self-titled album... hah!)
After a while, the wind picks up, and Dean can feel Castiel shivering beside him.
“What!? How can he do that when you basically pay for everything?” Sam’s anger touches Dean, but it hurts too, knowing that Sam will be put in a precarious position now.
"Okay." Dean fidgets in his chair.
"Great," Cas says sarcastically, "what would I do without you? Whenever I feel like shit, at least you're here to show me I could always be
“Yeah, I will, just a sec,” Dean replies, but Cas is already asleep again.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean swears quietly, “well, we can’t keep that here. My dad would take it for sure if he found out. He doesn’t have any access to my account, though, so we could keep it there if you’re okay with that.”
Dean fumbles with the key in his hand as he juggles the paper bags in his arms. He is taking a break from a case, and it is time for a drink. Maybe more. As he jams the key into the lock, he kicks the door and it flies open. Dean stumbles into the room, dumping the bags on the table. Massaging his brow with one hand, he shuts the door, locks it, double checks that it’s locked, and turns slowly toward the bed. He freezes. For an instant he wonders if he has broken into another person’s room, but quickly pulls the gun from his waistband and takes aim at the figure he has found lying in his bed.
“No, Cas, that’s not true,” Dean says quickly.
“Yeah Cas, you have to go,” Dean replies in a tone that says there’s no point in arguing. “Hey, man, I know it sucks, but I gotta take care of you. That means getting you in for this follow-up.”
Sam didn’t say anything when Dean wrenched the door open and collapsed into the driver’s seat.
begins to play, Cas begins to wake, stretching, slowly realizing whom he is pressed up against.
“I guess it just needed some water,” Cas says casually.
“I think so,” Dean says, finally looking up with an eyebrow cocked raising the coffee cup to his lips.
"'M sorry," Dean murmurs without raising his head.
“I knew it!” Cas shouts suddenly, startling Dean, “I knew they’d change their goddamned minds about letting me go! Fuck!” Dean looks over at him, concerned as Cas falls apart. “I can’t handle it, Dean, I can’t fucking handle this!” Dean reaches over, gripping Cas’s trembling hand firmly.
“Someone in the room with you?” he asks.
“Not this bad,” Cas responds.
“Seriously, Cas? I thought you’re supposed to be on my side here,” Dean jokes.
“I can’t imagine how fuckin’ hard that must have been,” Dean says, his voice hoarse.
The small house is eerily quiet as Sam steps inside, locking the door behind him. His dad’s old truck is gone, but the black ’67 Impala Dean drives is in the driveway.
“Angel, wake up,” Dean murmurs, a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. Cas moans something incoherent before his eyes slit open. “Cas, you gotta help me get your boxers back on; Sammy’ll probably be back soon.” Cas grumbles but manages to lift his hips off the bed just enough to shimmy his way into some clothing, then he’s back out.
“Oh, well, I don’t think I can get that anyway,” she says. “I don’t think it’s one of the pills with any street value.”
“Good.” Dean can feel Castiel’s body begin to relax beneath him. Cas gasps softly as he feels Dean slide a finger gently into him. His mind spins; the feeling is so foreign, but Dean’s lips ground him, and he wants more. He rocks his hips, pressing Dean’s finger deeper. Dean works slow, massaging Cas from the inside, savoring the way each tiny movement makes Cas whimper and moan.
“Sex. You’re asking me if angels have sex with each other,” he says as if
“The kiss,” Cas clarifies, sensing his cheeks tinging pink, “I can’t keep kissing you if it isn’t really what you want.” Castiel fights, but he can feel panic creeping into his chest, ignited by self-doubt.
“Huh,” Dean says, “shitty parents?” Castiel snorts.
Castiel, mainly because he is polite and speaks to them as if they are real people with lives outside of cleaning the house, but also because they rarely have to do anything in his bedroom or bathroom; he does it all himself.
“Sick of laying in bed, worrying, lonely…” Cas trails off. “M’sorry I’m such a burden.”
“No, Cas, no,” Dean pleads as he lays his brother down gently, rushing to Cas’s side. “Cas!” Dean cries as Cas’s glassy eyes beg him for something he can’t provide.
“I’m sure he’s alright. He would have called or texted, right?”
“I am fairly certain I don’t,” Cas replies, serious as always.
“But I’m going to take your refusal to answer as a ‘yes,’” she adds.
“Really?” Cas whispers, closing his eyes as he takes in Dean’s words and hands all over him. “I thought maybe… it was just me…”
Then the guilt hits. This is
“Sam did mention that you were not home. I’m glad you are doing alright, though. Is your father out of town?”
They luck out, and the weather is decent on their stop-and-go walk back to the motel. By the time they arrive back, it’s dark and quickly becoming cold.
-Led Zeppelin
“Well, what then? Do you mean like the Devil or something?” Sam replies apprehensively.
“Yeah! Finding his grave was a bitch, but I managed to track it down.”
“Uh, it’s me. Is everything okay?” Castiel asks hesitantly. Maybe this is a big mistake.
“You can come in if you want… if that’s allowed.” Castiel’s heart feels like it does a somersault then, and he steps into the room, walking around to stand in front of Dean. Even in the dim light, Castiel can see that Dean has been crying.
Castiel breathes again and again, and Dean can’t get enough of it, hearing his own name gasped in pleasure from the lips of
“Holy shit!” Cas yells as they continue to spin, but when Dean glances over, Cas is actually grinning though he has a death grip on the door and the seat.  When they come to a stop, Dean looks over at Cas, laughing.
Dean stumbles across the hall to his own room as if in a fog. He feels like he doesn't recognize himself; he definitely doesn't recognize his own actions today. I mean, Dean Winchester
“I see. That can’t be easy, having that in the back of your mind while trying to sort out your new feelings for this friend.” Dean just nods, letting out a slow breath. “Well, I am proud of you, Dean,” Billie says sincerely, “you have made good progress in even the short time I have been seeing you.”
” Castiel groans. “You are … I just… I have no words.”
“But you’re afraid of what other people would think of you if anyone knew you enjoyed relations with a man.” It isn’t a question, and Dean doesn’t answer.
“Hey!” Dean says urgently, a hand on Castiel’s shoulder, “hey, man, it’s alright, wake up!” Cas cries out again before his eyes fly open, fixing on Dean’s face in the dim light. Without warning, Castiel again wraps his arms around Dean’s waist, pressing his face into Dean’s chest as he struggles to regain control of his breath.
- Led Zeppelin
Just then Emily approaches him through the crowd. She looks exhausted, but she has a gentle smile on her face.
"Thanks, Sammy," Dean breathes, his arms still wrapped tightly around his giant little brother.
“Are you sure you’re okay?” Dean asks, running shaking fingers through Castiel’s blood-matted hair, “you might have a concussion.”
After a while, Sam looks down at the watch Dean had given him one Christmas.
“Good,” Castiel says defiantly. “I mean, really, are they happy about
“What? Are you serious?” Castiel sounds cautiously optimistic.

“Huh?”
“I’m just so glad you’re okay,” Sam replies. “I’ve missed you so much.”
be true. Dean
miserable."
"Dude, I can teach you. I pretty much taught myself, and I'll be teaching Sammy in a few years," Dean shrugs, but the smile on Castiel's face makes his heart race.
“Don’t want you to leave,” Sam whispers.
Sam’s nerves, his excitement, as this seemingly mundane moment will loom momentously in his young life. Dean hopes this is good; Sam deserves something good.
“Wait, what?” Cas asks, furrowing his brow and tilting his head.
“Hey, Dean,” Castiel says as Dean hands him a plate of enchiladas and rice, “why is it considered attractive for a woman to wear rabbit ears and a tail?” Dean gapes at him before his face breaks into a grin and he laughs.
"No, you're right," Dean says gently, "I should have asked... I just... you're so good. I wanted to see more, and I didn't think you'd mind, but I guess I shouldn't have assumed."
about his life. Speaking of which, Cas dreads the coming “session” with his uncle. They’re always unpleasant at best.
“You need a ride?” Dean offers, but Sam shakes his head.
“Give it here,” Dean says calmly, extending his hand. “Guess it’s not just childproof. You think you can manage the water bottle?” Dean teases gently as he hands two pills back to Cas.
Dean starts the car, pops a new cassette into the player, and pulls back onto the road which descends a little through more sharp curves. The road snakes it’s way along the cliff side before retreating back into more heavily wooded scenery. Soon they see signs for Latourell Falls, but Dean doesn’t want to drag Cas out of the car again so soon, and Sam had told him about some other places they
“What is it?” Cas asks, picking one up.
“Oh, uh, I dunno, maybe,” he mumbles, but he knows it’s a lie. He knows what his dad is
about it. He hadn’t really thought past sex serving as a means of reproduction for humans, all mammals, really, and plenty of fish and birds and reptiles, and to a certain extent, some plants. He knew humans tend to think a lot of it, ascribing all sorts of meaning to it, made laws regarding it, even wrote down what god intended it for, for whom he intended it to be between. That was all nonsense, of course. God wasn’t watching anyone have sex. God didn’t seem to care what humans did in general, I mean, that’s why angels were put in charge of watching over them in the first place; God had become bored with his creations, wasn’t offended or pleased by them, simply indifferent.
"What? No! Of course not," Dean says, dropping his bag and stepping up to Cas.
"Cas..." he chokes out but gets no further, pulling Castiel into a desperate embrace, burying his face in the soft fabric over Cas's shoulder.
,” Dean gasps as he struggles to regain control of his breath. He can’t wipe the smile from his face, but when he turns to look at Cas, tears are running down Cas’s flushed cheeks.
I… I’m…” Cas’s voice is shaking. Dean knows Cas is about to lose it, and damnit if that isn’t a
“Damn,” Dean replies. “They don’t know lying is a sin?” he jokes.
“My memories are fading. I suppose the knowledge I once had cannot fit inside a human mind.” Castiel’s voice is hollow, and something begins to dawn on Dean. He feels foolish and selfish for not realizing sooner what this all means for Cas; it isn’t like Cas just lost the ability to do some magic tricks. Castiel has lost almost everything about himself. Sure, being human is cool if that’s what you’ve always been, Dean figures, but now he tries putting himself in Castiel’s place: maybe it would be something like if a human woke up one day to find himself turned into a chimpanzee. First you’d remember being a human, having all that knowledge and ability. Then you’d begin to forget, but you’d still remember that there is all this stuff you used to know, and this sense of profound loss would just stick with you as you began doing chimpanzee stuff while trying to remember the stuff you’re actively forgetting. It makes his head hurt, and he turns to Cas.
Notes about this chapter:
Castiel thinks, he
“You weren’t at dinner,” Cas says for lack of anything better.
“I think we’re good, thanks,” Dean says, putting an arm around Castiel. Charlie brings them the check, and soon, they’re walking a little unsteadily back to the motel.
“That’s great, Cas,” Sam says through his laughter as he watches Dean trying to compose himself. “Uh, Dean, I've been meaning to ask, what happened to your hand?” Castiel turns to look at Dean, feeling that it’s best he stay quiet on this matter.
“Praise Satan!” Meg exclaims, “I
“C’mon Cas, let’s get in the backseat.”
“Used to, but I dunno anymore,” Castiel says sadly. “What about angels?”
"You said I wouldn't have to go back!" Cas chokes out.
hook-ups. Private Christian school isn’t exactly a great place to meet guys.”
“You’re doin’ great, Cas,” Dean soothes, “just keep breathing.”
“Dean!” Cas cries, relieved when Dean’s eyes blink open, but in seconds, Dean is pushing him aside as John lunges toward them. John wraps his hands around Dean’s throat, straddling him, squeezing until Dean’s face is red and he’s gasping for breath. Dean struggles in vain but is quickly feeling his consciousness slipping away. It seems distant, but he thinks he can hear Cas screaming, and then the hands disappear from his throat, and he sits up in time to see his father throwing Castiel off his back. Cas’s head makes hard contact with the wall, and he slumps to the floor.
“Your face is cute,” Dean teases again, eliciting another blush from Cas, who wrinkles up his nose. Then they’re interrupted by Dean’s phone alerting him to a text.
"Dean," Castiel says firmly, sitting up and leaning in closer to him. Cas reaches his free hand out and places it at the side of Dean's neck. They are so close, closer than Dean would feel comfortable being to anybody else. "Dean," Cas says again, and they hold each others' gaze. "You're the only thing I still have faith in." Dean's breath catches for a moment as the words hit him like a semi truck, and he doesn't know what to say. When Cas leans back against his pillows again, his hand sliding from Dean's neck, Dean is unsettled to find he misses the touch.
In the living room, they find Sam talking to a dark-haired girl who looks
“Yeah, but also, I honestly never thought anyone would ever get off doing that with me,” Cas admits, burying his face in Dean’s neck.
“That’s not what I asked.”
"Castiel, honey, like I said, you can still talk to the boy; you just need to 'leave room for Jesus,' as they say."
“Meg,” Cas says, “I, uh, I’m pretty sure she said something about a sister named Ruby.” He
“Dios mío,” María utters under her breath. “Castiel, this is very bad.” Cas doesn’t say anything, only hisses through his teeth when she reaches a spot that particularly stings. “I just don’t understand how anyone could do this to a child.” Cas glances back at her. “Yes, I know you’re nearly grown, but you will always be a child in my eyes… much like my own children.”  Cas smiles at her sadly until she reaches another very sore spot, and he buries his face in his pillow. Once he’s cleaned up she carefully applies antibiotic ointment to the worst spots; it helps some with the pain as well as warding off infection. Once she is finished taping gauze over the ointment, Castiel rolls onto his side, wiping the tears from his eyes before looking at her.
“I’d prefer he stay,” Cas says firmly.
“Sammy saved my life. I was pretty much dead when he found me. And he’s just a kid. No kid should have to experience that, you know? He called 911 and did CPR and all that shit. When I woke up in the hospital and they let him in to see me, he still had blood all over his clothes. My blood. And I know he blames himself for what I did even though I’ve told him again and again that nothing is his fault. Fuck. Sammy’s such a sweet kid, and all I’ve ever wanted was to protect him. Keep him innocent, and now what? Feel like I’ve fuckin’ destroyed him.”
Dean breathes nervously. Cas is so close! If he can just get close enough to the downspout, he might be able to climb down far enough to jump safely to the ground. But, of course, his foot slips, and Dean watches in horror as Cas rolls over the edge, managing to catch the gutter, which is now threatening to come off the side of the house.
“You look good in real clothes again,” Dean says happily, once Cas is dressed and sitting on the edge of the bed in one of  Dean’s old Zeppelin tees and a pair of Sam’s old pajama pants that have shrunk far too much for Sam, but fit Cas decently. The Zeppelin shirt is one of those featuring the iconic image of Icarus, which Dean only now realizes is almost too ironic given how closely Icarus resembles a fallen angel.
After a number of calls to John that remain unanswered, it is decided that the school’s guidance counselor and social worker will drive Sam to the hospital.
Dean sighs as the city grows up around them, already missing the peace and quiet they’ve just left behind. Cas has been awake for a while now, sitting up in the backseat and staring forlornly out the window. The knot in his stomach tightens as they draw nearer to the motel. He wonders what Dean has been thinking about this whole time. Has Dean decided to cut it off with him for good?
"No, m' not, Cas," Dean says quietly, surprising Castiel by reaching out for his hand. "Just worried. Thought we were out of the fuckin' woods, and here we go again! I don't want you back in the hospital any more than you do; I just hope we're making the right call here."
“No, I’m sorry. I said you could ask. I dunno though. Never thought much about it, ‘cept to hide it from Sam. Guess it just feels good to feel
“Well, I’m nothing if not thoughtful,” Dean answers with a wink. “Just, do me a favor?”
"So when do I get to leave here with you guys?" he asks, and Dean can sense his frustration.
“I can’t go in to see my doctor. My parents wouldn’t take me, and I definitely can’t go now; I’m afraid they’d tell my parents I was there or something.”
“Yeah,” is all Cas says in return before resuming his passionate kisses. Truly experiencing human love for the first time is a feeling that Castiel never could have imagined. Sharing a mutual respect with Dean was incredible as it was, but
He’d been 16, making Sammy 12, John was gone yet again, and they were hungry. No. Starving. He could deal with it. He could wait another day or two, but he couldn’t force that on Sam. They were somewhere in Alabama, so at least it wasn’t cold, but he couldn’t stand Sammy’s too young to be so somber eyes, and the way he stared at every food advertisement they passed. So finally, he grabbed his fake ID, putting him at 21 years old, and pulled to a stop in front of the first bar they came to in the first little shit town.
“The truth?” Sam repeats, a chill rushing through his body. Dean can feel it and pulls Sam closer.
Cas decides to wrap himself in the comforter from the bed, bracing himself for the cold air he knows he is about to step out into. He slips outside and makes his way as quickly as he can down onto the beach. The cold sand is almost painful under his sensitive, bare feet, but he grits his teeth and continues toward Dean. He pauses when he is about ten feet away. Dean is sitting, hunched over his knees, and if Castiel didn’t know better, he would swear that Dean is sobbing.
“Cas, are you alright?” Dean’s voice is tired.
“At least now I can scratch myself,” Cas says dryly to Dean. “Are human bodies
“Me too.”
"Cas, maybe you should get checked out," Dean suggests quietly. Cas looks as if he's been betrayed.
"You've spent all that time talking to him, and you don't even know what team he's playing for? Jesus, Cassie, you're never gonna get laid at that rate."
“At least you all agree on which god you’re talking about. Humans also think they have god on their side, but we can’t decide which god, and each group of humans has a different side.”
"I told you, my name is Castiel," he says to her, clearly frustrated. Sara glances at Dean. "Dean, tell her! My name is Castiel, and I am an Angel of the Lord." This time it's Sam desperately trying to evade a fit of laughter.
"Who the fuck is Cas?" Meg asks incredulously.
“You really think so?” Cas asks sincerely.
“Yeah,” he confirms, “no more running away.” At this, Castiel’s face cracks into a wide smile, and Dean knows he’s making the right decision; he can feel it deep down. “Cas, I’m gonna say something I’ve never said to anyone before: let’s take things slow at first, okay?”
“Maybe I could help,” Cas says.
Dean cries himself to sleep eventually, wondering what his dad meant when he said, “they’ll be keeping you here for a while.”
"Go away," Cas grumbles.
They make their way back up the beach, and Dean flops himself down in the warm, dry sand, tugging Cas down with him. He lays on his back, gazing up at the clear blue sky, drawing Cas in close to his side. Cas rests his head on Dean’s chest, lulled by its gentle rise and fall, like the roar of the waves, ever present in his ears. Dean lets his eyes fall shut, tangling his fingers lazily in Cas’s hair, and wrapping his other arm comfortably around Cas’s torso.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel says in reply, “for everything.” Dean grins and looks down.  He always feels embarrassed to receive thanks or compliments.
Quietly, Dean tugs on his jeans, a tee shirt, and jacket, and gently slides the glass door open, slipping outside and shutting it behind him. The storm has passed, and the moon is bright. Dean can see its reflection glinting on the crests of the waves that continue crashing on the empty shore. Dean takes a deep breath, sucking in the salty air and folding his arms tightly against the cold.  His feet carry him closer, padding through the grass and down the steps onto the sand. The world is silent except for the roar of the sea, which Dean hopes will drown out the cacophony in his head. He digs his toes into the cold, wet sand and stares out at the dark horizon. Suddenly, there are tears in his eyes, a fact that makes him furious.
"Fuck, yeah," Dean swears, and Missouri raises an eyebrow before returning to her work. "Meg tried to tell me I just
Castiel buries his face in his blankets, unable to hold back his tears any longer. Terror has rendered his entire body painfully rigid. He begins to sob when he hears Zachariah unbuckling his belt. He pleads silently to a God he isn't even sure exists to
"Cure?" he spits, wrenching himself free of his uncle's embrace. "You two realize I don't have a disease, right!?" His eyes flash angrily between his uncle and his mother. Without warning, he is backhanded across the face by Zachariah, but he can't stop himself. "I don't know what I've done to deserve your hatred; I've never even kissed anyone, and you act like I'm a whore! Why don't you go talk to the slut next door?"
pleasurable.”
“Hi, Castiel, how are you doing?” Missouri smiles fondly at him.
Trays in hand, the two sit where they had the day before.
“So good,” Castiel replies, beginning to straighten himself up.
As the SUV winds its way up the family’s long, tree-lined driveway, Castiel is unable to recognize the beauty present around him, the pristine lawns, manicured flower beds, and bright sunlight twinkling off the spotless windows lining the front of the family’s palatial home. It all seems suffocating to him; he feels hopelessly trapped by this perfect façade of a life.
, Dean?" But the doctor continues, unfazed.
“I love you, Dean,” Castiel says when the kiss ends.
“I know,” Dean replies, “just teasin’. Really, Sammy, you’re so brave and smart. Smarter than me. Way smarter than Dad.” Sam shakes his head. “Yeah, you are. Sammy, you saved me. I’m still here ’cause of you,” Dean says quietly, tears falling once more. Dean manages to reach one of Sam’s hands, gripping it tightly, and they are both quiet for a while.
“Alright. Don’t make me regret this.”
“Alright!” Dean concludes excitedly. He finds Cas a pair of jeans that fit decently and another of his tees and a long sleeved flannel shirt.
“Well, that’s great to hear!”
“Okay, Dean,” Cas whispers.
"Guess you got a point," Cas concedes, though he sincerely doubts that Dean would have any trouble finding a date on the outside either.
“Alright then, we’ll start easy. How many times a week would you say you exercise for at least thirty minutes?”
Dean takes a long, shuddering breath. Sam blames himself.
“Cas!” he repeats, “wake up, Cas!” And finally, he does, gasping and shaking, not sure for a moment where he is, who he is with. “Cas, I got you man, it’s okay,” Dean murmurs, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s trembling shoulders.
"Is he gonna..." Dean's voice is hollow, hoarse, and his question trails off before he can finish it.
Earlier that day:
Dean swore as he scrambled to pull the sheets over himself, slamming the laptop shut. “Can’t a guy get any goddamn privacy anymore?”
“Wait! What’s the plan?” Cas asks quickly.
“Thought so,” Sam says, winking at Dean.
“You’re incorrigible,” Cas mutters, feigning a beleaguered expression.  He rests his cheek on Dean’s chest and allows his eyes to flutter shut. The sounds of the movie and Dean’s steady heartbeat pervade his ears, and he lets the sensation of Dean’s fingers in his hair take him somewhere warm and safe. This snapshot is perfect, this moment in time; he feels he could live in it forever, just caring and being cared for. Despite what Dean may think, Dean is flawless, in Cas’s eyes, at least.
"Shut up!" Dean nearly shouts.
"It's like dreams, but l'm awake," Dean said quietly, eyes fixed on his own feet.
But when Cas tightens his grip, and his breath against Dean’s neck becomes a little
“It’s so good to be back,” Dean murmurs into Sam’s shaggy hair, as Sam still refuses to let go.
likes him. Jesus, it's like middle school all over again. But Cas is great. He's effectively kept Dean from climbing the walls in this place.  People suck; Dean knows that, but he still finds it hard to understand why someone like Cas would be treated like crap by so many people, including his own goddamn family, all for no real reason, and Dean suddenly wants to beat the hell out of anyone who has ever given Cas shit. The desire is fierce, rivaled only by his mama-bear like ferocity when it comes to Sam. Dean doesn’t let a lot of people “in,” but when he does, he’d sacrifice almost anything for them, and now, Cas is “in.”
Trigger warnings for:
“They’re your mother’s. She leaves bottles of pills laying around
“I am not on Facebook,” Dean deadpans.
be bi or something. It’s possible. Probable? No. And Cas knows he already has enough problems; he doesn’t need to be pining after one more guy who isn’t into him… but oh, what wouldn’t he give for Dean to want him too? He can’t think of anything he would rather have than for Dean to kiss him, to offer to run away with him, just the two of them on their own, and… shit! He’s doing it again. He does this
“I dunno,” Dean mutters.
"Did... did I just get sexually harassed?" Dean asks with a thousand-yard stare.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Cas replies irritably.
“No,” Dean grumbles his concession.
"Yeah?" he answers. He sounds and acts as if he has been sleeping, but he hasn't, and Missouri knows it; she'd only asked him to return to his room ten or so minutes ago. He doesn't know why he does it, but then again, he doesn't know why he has done a good number of the things he has done lately. So he sits up, rubs his face, and blinks up at Missouri, the picture of innocence, a mask hiding the embarrassment he feels brought on by his own vulnerability, and his worry that Missouri may have wheedled some information about him out of Cas. For some reason though, he feels like he can trust Castiel.
“It’s okay, Sammy,” Dean states groggily.
"We're here now," Cas says simply with a smile before adding, "and now I would like you to flip me over and fuck me until I come, screaming your name." Dean doesn’t hesitate; he rolls them over with ease, without pulling out of Cas. He rolls his hips in a steady, solid rhythm, driving increasingly louder cries from Castiel’s soft lips.
And by now, Cas has pretty much figured out that
"What?" Cas protests, his eyes finally darting up to meet Missouri's gaze, "but we're just friends!"
The nurse is gentle as she unwraps Dean’s arms, inspecting the wounds for any signs of infection. He avoids her eyes as she works; he doesn’t want to see the pity he knows is harbored there. The fresh cuts are red, and Dean notices that a few of them have been stitched closed, but before he can get a good look, they are being rebandaged.
“Wanna try that, Cas?” Dean asks.
"Dean," Cas says after a while, "this 'shivering' is very... unpleasant."
“You hungry?” Dean asks, turning to Sam, “thought maybe we could check out the bar down the street.”
“Oh,” Sam repeats, little wrinkles traversing his forehead, “but Cas is gonna be okay?”
"Good morning, adolescent psychiatric unit," Missouri answers.
“One of my brothers reached into me and tore it out. They’ve trapped me in my vessel, powerless.” Cas laughs darkly to himself, “I’m sure they thought it a fitting punishment.”
“Salt repels evil spirits. Thing in the hall is a devil’s trap; demon tries to get in here, and it’ll be trapped within the circle,” Dean asserts confidently, standing abruptly from the bed. “One more thing,” he says, reaching up to a shelf in the top of their closet. He pulls out an old water bottle with the words “DO NOT DRINK!” emblazoned on it in bold Sharpie lettering.
“My one true love,” Dean says dreamily, and the color drains from Cas’s face. Meg, on the other hand, looks disgusted. “She’s gorgeous! Black and chrome. Fixed her up myself. ‘67 Chevy Impala.”
"Are you alright, Dean?" Castiel asks after a while.
"That is not true," Dean protested. "I really care about you. I’m sorry I don’t always show that. Come on, Cas, we'll figure this out."
They order pizza: half some fancy ass portobello mushroom and truffle oil thing with white sauce for Cas, and the other half “all the meat you have” for Dean. When it arrives at the table, it’s amazing, particularly the mushroom half; Dean has to admit it is “goddamn delicious.”
“You bet, Cas! You sleep pretty well?” Sam asks, stifling a laugh.
“Okay, Sam,” Cas says after a big gulp, swallowing the huge bite he’d taken.  He eyes the sweet and sour chicken on his plate before taking a bite and declaring with a full mouth, “oh, this is quite good.”
“Jeez, I’m only joking, chill out.” Dean glares at him.
“Fine,” Sam grumbles but quickly asks, “can I stay here like this if I’m quiet?”
“A demon. He’s followed me my whole life, but now he’s threatening the people I care about. That’s why I need you to tattoo Cas and Sam with the same protective symbol you did for me,” Dean explains, pulling at the neck of his shirt to show Pam which symbol he’s referring to. She doesn’t look as shocked as Cas would have expected a person to; she only looks hard at Dean, taking in the panic that is plain on his face.
Later, Dean pulls off at a gas station. He fills the tank, parks, and drags a reluctant Cas into the bathroom. They receive a few odd looks as they walk in, and once they’re in front of the mirror, it becomes clear why that is. They both look like hell. Cas’s eyes are red and swollen, a byproduct of the extreme “ugly cry” he’d engaged in earlier,  his hair is matted with blood over his left temple, and dried blood is crusted over his ear and cheek. Dean, perhaps, looks worse. His cheek is turning a deep purple, almost black, with a matching bruise under his eye, which has swollen halfway shut. Due to the near-strangulation, his eyes are bloodshot, and a distinct pattern of bruising rings his throat.
“That feels good,” Cas murmurs.
“Who was that?” Cas asks with worry in his voice.
Here comes the sun
"Cas," Dean says, running his fingertips across Castiel's cheek, "I fuckin’
jealousy. Dean clears his throat, jolting Cas back into the present.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean asks, his tone indicating a change in the topic of conversation.
Cas. He is surprised that this revelation hasn’t sent him into a full-on panic, but at the same time, he refuses to think past today, living in a world in which he can love Cas and no one has to know. Specifically,
“Thanks, but I don’t wanna look even more pathetic than I already do,” Cas groans but accepts Dean’s arm to lean against and take at least a little weight off his ankle.
Missouri gently closes the door and takes a seat in the desk chair, facing Cas.
“Yeah.”
“What are you talking about, Dean?” Cas says, not looking up from the game.
"He's coming. Just had to find parking and he wanted to talk to your nurse." Sam eases himself into a chair in the corner of the room. If he didn't know any better, he would think Castiel looks
“Cas, are you
Eventually, Cas suggests they start walking again, and Dean pulls him to his feet. The second half of the walk seems a little easier as Cas is bolstered by his good spirits. When they finally step out onto the bridge, Cas is pretty sure the feeling is unadulterated joy.
“Okay,” she acknowledges simply. Dean is surprised; he wants to hate her, but he doesn’t for some reason. “Could you just tell me a little about Sam? What’s he like? Are you close?” Yeah, Dean can do that if it’ll lead to a quicker end to the conversation.
Dean manages to get out.  It’s barely a whisper, his eyes downcast, but when he looks back up, he is met by Castiel’s radiant smile. The warmth he feels spreading through his chest is like nothing he has ever felt before, and the tears are back in his goddamn eyes as he realizes how strong his feelings have been for his friend this entire time; Dean had managed to deny his feelings for so long that he’d almost even had himself fooled. This fact breaks his heart, knowing how much he
He's asked the usual questions: the "do you know of anyone who would want to hurt him" sort of questions and the "has he mentioned anything unusual lately" questions also. Since "archangels" and "celestial civil war" are not acceptable anwers, Dean simply answers "no" to everything. It would almost be funny if the whole thing weren't so fucked up. When the officers are satisfied, Dean is left alone again. He stands and paces in the small room, unable to sit still.
“Mhmm, this tastes
“He wasn’t ‘assaulting’ me,” Cas says, taken aback, “and he’s just a friend.” This answer doesn’t satisfy his father in the least.
anything," Cas utters through gritted teeth.
“I’ll give you all the time you need,” Castiel replies gently, his voice full of warmth.
“Yeah. So, are we good?” Dean asks hopefully.
” Cas gasps before groaning and falling back on his bed, hands over his face in shock and disbelief. "That's not even true!"
“You alright leaving your shirt off to let that soak in a bit?” Dean asks, and Cas nods again. As Dean takes the supplies back to the bathroom, Cas pulls a blanket up to his chest, hugging it to himself, a little dazed by everything that has just occurred.
“Jesus Christ, Cas,” Dean says, shaking his head. “My dad is an evil sonofabitch, but I can’t say your parents sound a whole lot better. But you said Gabe is an alright guy?”
"Uhm, hi!" Becky cheerfully greets them as Anna stands by quietly. "Dean, right?"
“Maybe stop saying ‘hell’ so much,” Cas says with a smile, unable to hide the giddiness Dean’s answer has left him with.
"Do you feel that you can behave in a safe manner?" Dean has to stuff the urge to snort and roll his eyes deep down inside himself.
“Have a seat, Cas,” Dean says in a tone that tells Cas he’s trying very hard to hold himself together. Carefully, Castiel sits cross legged at the foot of the bed and watches as Dean rubs his face vigorously with both hands.
When the belt cracks across his back for the first time, leaving a searing burn in its wake, Castiel lets out a startled, strangled cry, but the truth is that he is actually
“I said ‘no,’ Sam! The whole fucking house is a mess. I don’t know what Dean does all day. He dropped out of school, you’d think he could at least keep the place clean,” John says coldly. It’s the first time he has mentioned Dean all evening.
“No,” Dean says bitterly, “actually, everything’s fucking awful.” He doesn’t turn to face Cas. He can’t. He can’t face anyone right now.
“Painful memories.” Cas reaches up, the tips of his fingers touching Dean’s cheek softly.
“Mornin’ sugar,” Missouri greets him, “sorry to wake you so early, but I’m having a bit of an issue getting a hold of your dad.”
“Cas!” Dean gasps, clearly horrified at what he’s seen, “what the fuck?!”
“I’m not sure. Maybe,” Cas says, biting his lip. “Is it dangerous?” he asks, “like, could I have a heart attack or something?”
“Holy shit, dude!” Dean exclaims. The rose bush has fully bloomed, its leaves suddenly dark green, a sweet smell filling the air around them.
was the better pool player.” Sam just rolls his eyes, and Dean presses his body closer to Cas out of spite.
“Huh, well, uh, I'm gonna go, uh, shower,” Dean says hurriedly, jumping up and heading toward the bathroom.
“Well, maybe a little,” Castiel admits, “but I know a lot of people do it.”
"Has he been talking?" Dean asks urgently. "Is he alright?" The nurse pauses. Her hesitation fills Dean with dread.
“Uh,” Castiel replies, “I don’t think I can do it while you’re staring at me.” Dean huffs and turns around. “Thank you,” Castiel says calmly, and Dean can hear him unzipping his jeans.
“I am on your side, Dean; taking care of yourself would be in your best interest,” Castiel replies.
“Castiel, you need to speak clearly if you want to make it in this world; mumblers never become successful,” his father lectures, and Cas sighs internally.
“I don’t know his last name,” he finally lies. He receives a glare from his father through the rear view mirror.
“Love you so much, Cas,” Dean rasps against his neck as he feels Castiel’s fingernails digging into his skin as he comes hot and hard between them, his muscles spasming, hips jerking. “Yeah, that’s it, that’s it, Cas,” Dean murmurs to him softly, running his fingers over his cheek and through his sweat-dampened hair. “Gonna come too, Cas,” Dean groans, low and rough, trembling as he spills into Castiel, holding him so tight.
“Just wondering. Dunno how long they’re gonna keep me.” Dean seems somber again.
“Water would be nice,” Castiel answers. His mouth and throat feel uncomfortably dry, though his palms and feet are uncomfortably damp. Dean hands him a glass and sits opposite him.
There’s another knock at the door.
“Dean!” Sammy shouts as he rushes in then, effectively tackling Dean, who is already splayed out on the floor. “I didn’t know you were coming home today!”
"Yes," he answers simply, and Dean takes his hand. There is something beautiful in Dean's eyes, something that Castiel isn't used to seeing there. It's genuine happiness, Cas realizes after a while, and his heart leaps a little in his chest. Dean's hand is warm, grasping Castiel's firmly, and Cas can hardly believe the comfort and joy that such a simple touch can impart.
“Cas,” he chokes, his throat suddenly tight with emotion, “you’re right; I’m scared. I’m a fucking coward, and I’m so sorry.” Castiel’s face falls. He looks broken. “No, Cas! Listen. I
“Dude, I don’t know if I’d
“Huh. Sorry, Cas, that’s some heavy shit,” Dean says, at a loss for something decently appropriate to say.
“Oh god,
go?" Dean asks, "like legally speaking or whatever."
“Yeah?”
,” Cas cries out, and Dean grins again.
"How are you feeling, Dean?" she asks.
“Well, I know what I’m gettin’,” Dean announces. “Cas?” Cas looks up, uncertainty written across his face. “Get the bacon cheeseburger,” Dean suggests, “probably a safe bet.”
“No. I don’t think so. At least, I can’t feel his presence.” Castiel drops his chin to his chest, sighing. “But I can feel a… I don’t know, it’s irritating.”
“No,” Castiel replies, “I’m not sure where you all got those ideas. It’s almost impossible to explain heaven to a being who has never been there. But, no. We don’t build anything in the way that you mean.”
“I went to one of Pam’s séances. That actually
“Oh, fuck, Cas,” Dean moans, leaning his head back, “you look
he thinks, probably a little too excitedly for how commonplace this is for most people. But Cas isn’t most people. And
“Good. Now let me see that hand, sugar, then we can try to see about a visit with your brother.”
“Looks good,” the nurse says kindly, “they’ll heal well.” Dean doesn’t reply. He just feels numb.
“Yeah, Dean, I know your order by now. Cas? Wait, I’ll surprise you,” Sam says as he shrugs on his jacket and walk out into the cool, damp Portland morning air.
“Cas, you get to sit there,” Dean says quietly, indicating the table, not realizing he had just said the wrong name. “He’s kinda new to this whole doctor visit thing,” Dean explains with a laugh.
“Why are you here, anyway?” Sam asks. “Dad hasn’t told me anything.”
"It's so cool that you have tattoos," Becky says next, "did they hurt? I bet it did. I heard that rib tattoos hurt the worst! Do you have any on your ribs? I've always thought that would be a pretty cool place to get a tattoo, but I don't think I'm brave enough. Maybe I should just get one on my shoulder, but they're so permanent! Do you regret any of yours? OMG, like what if you got one and they spelled something wrong? Ugh! That would just be the worst!" Dean looks like a deer in the headlights as the verbal tidal wave crashes over him.
“You bet. You take care of yourself now, you hear me?”
“Well, that’s good...right? Is it possible to regenerate your grace from the leftovers?” Castiel tilts his head, eying Dean seriously at the word “leftovers.”
Dean fights to hold his hips still, but Cas pulls him forward, urging him to thrust into his mouth.
"Meg, don't be an idiot!" Cas finally speaks up, bolstered by Dean's defense of him. "Do you really think Missouri would allow us to look at each other, much less speak to each other again if she'd caught us... doing
"Yes," Castiel answers without hesitation. Whether they are real entities or simply hallucinations, Cas figures he isn't qualified to decide, but Dean is so sincere, the fear in his eyes so real, that Castiel has no doubt that Dean is telling him the truth as he sees it.
"I... I'm going home tomorrow," Cas finally chokes out. To his surprise, he finds panic in Dean's pretty eyes.
...and yeah, everything
“Yeah, but that doesn’t make it okay,” Dean sighs. “Just know I don’t regret anything, Cas, when it comes to us, okay?”
