John pouted. “Again?  Hookers are like Belgian Chocolate. It’s great at first and then, after a while, you feel a bit queasy and think, ‘meh’.”
Sherlock twirled on the spot. “So, he has mixed thoughts about his homosexuality and, possibly, about homosexuals in general.  It is something to be hidden, a desire that can only be indulged in secrecy. He is closeted and, as a result, probably more likely to suffer mental health issues, substance abuse problems and is open to blackmail.  Continue.”
Mycroft walked around the worn rug at 221B Baker Street and looked at his brother. Sherlock was hurt. He knew Sherlock was focused on the case because he needed to push his pain and confusion aside.  He made a mental note to have a serious word with John Watson when he returned.
Thankfully, the nurse returned with a tray filled with sandwiches, drinks, crisps and chocolate. Clearly, the Health Centre didn’t want John to pass out either. John munched a ham sandwich and tentatively, casually, approached the special chair. The thud of the room doors halted him. Sherlock was wheeled in on a wide bed and, without a steady thought, John headed towards him.
“Not Jason so much,” Candlar admitted. “I’ve seen him there, of course.  I preferred it when Marianne worked reception, truth be told. I thought she brought an air of class to the place.”
John frowned.  He hated doing what Mycroft wanted. He waited until the Jaguar was out of sight before he went back inside.  When John walked into the flat, Sherlock was feeding Rosie.   John squeezed his shoulder by way of apology and ordered takeaway curry for dinner.  He poured two glasses of Kingfisher, set the table and watched his daughter and his best friend interact.   His blood pressure dropped little by little.  His ghosts returned to the shadows.
“I thought of last time,” Sherlock said. He had no idea why he was talking. his words came in between the times when all he could do was catch his breath. “I thought about you inside me. Oh, yes, there, there, there. I’ve thought about it a lot. Here and when I was gone. Every single time I had a moment to just, well, y’know, I thought of you.” Sherlock’s body was silk beneath the hands of a master tailor who seemed content to shape and stretch him into every curve of their combined bodies.
“No, it isn’t.” John sighed.  “You know what I said to Piero that I loved you and you died and then Mary and then you saved me?”
“Gah, you’re good. Can’t wait ‘til I’m in heat and you knot me and fill me.” John stroked Sherlock’s face with a shaky hand.
“Unlikely,” Sherlock replied.  “An international gangster would tell us to back off in a more sophisticated manner.”  He pulled his phone out of his jacket pocket, swiped and jabbed at the screen.  John heard ringing; Sherlock had put the phone on speaker.  Mycroft replied before Sherlock said a word.
Rosie was fractious and whiny as Sherlock peeled her out of her clothes. Her nappy was a horror and she managed to wee on the satin settee.  Sherlock giggled and when Rosie picked up on his glee she too, finally, smiled.  After that, the whole process went far more smoothly. Within ten minutes, Mycroft, Sherlock and Rosie swept out of the suite and left Anthea sponging child urine from the gold sofa.
“All of it. Whatever you want.” John’s response was automatic and surprised even him. He’d always rejected all that stupid Alpha bullshit, but he knew he’d take it all from Sherlock and love every moment.
, John thought. He let go of his foot, stood, and grabbed the front of Sherlock’s shirt again. “Where were we?”
John met Sherlock’s eye.  “Calm down,” he said immediately.  “Nathan’s here to teach me a few things. No, not those sorts of things.  Just come through to the bedroom, okay?”
John and Sherlock walked up to the blackout area together.  When they entered the main room, they seemed to be almost alone.  Sherlock and John put on what looked like normal glasses but were, in fact, highly sophisticated night-vision goggles.
“Only if the beans are low sodium, low sugar ones.  She can have egg as long as it’s cooked to death and there’s no salt in it.”
“Sodium oxybate is used as a medication in some countries,” Sherlock said. His inspired, shrewd look made John want to rip off all his clothes.  “Would it be possible to isolate whether the concentration in these drugs were manufactured for medicinal use and where?”
Sherlock was awoken to an insistent beeping noise. He opened his eyes. He was alone on a huge bed and the console by the door flashed. Sherlock pulled a sheet around himself and scrabbled on the bedside table for the remote.
“Quite so. I’m not sure I approve of him taking his daughter to spend time with an alcoholic, of course.” Mycroft thumped his umbrella against the floor.
Sherlock mirrored of John’s steps, keeping his legs slightly flexed, until they reached the bathroom. John called a halt when they were next to the bath.
“Do you have any idea of how much I’ve thought of penetrating you since you told me you wanted that to happen? It’s tormented me, John. I’ve never done that before. Bertie wouldn’t let me.”
“He does have very sensitive nipples though,” John said. He wiped his face and gave Sherlock’s nipple a tweak.  Sherlock jumped.  John looked down. “Is that a phone in your pocket or..?”
Sherlock stood and took the tiny step he needed to be directly in front of John. He took John’s face in his hands and gave him a kiss. Its gentleness spoke of love. The softness of Sherlock’s mouth said he’d listened. The gentle push of Sherlock’s tongue against John’s lips told him that he was comforted by John’s words. The way Sherlock tilted his head and deepened the kiss communicated that his body and soul belonged to John. The very feel of the kiss promised John that Sherlock would forever care for him and for his child. And the way Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and pulled him closer told John countless other things that words simply couldn’t say.
“Fuh-fuh, ow!” John let go of Sherlock’s shirt and hopped on one foot as he grabbed his injured heel.
“You visit Doubles too?” Sherlock asked.  A faint tremor shivered across Candlar’s fingers.  Sherlock narrowed his gaze and thought about stimulants.
Sherlock was like James in a few ways: Blunt, unapologetic, and John wanted to climb into bed with him. Not that he ever allowed himself to think it until Mary died.  He’d found himself on the wrong side of forty, heading towards fifty, with a child and life that’d passed him by.  'It's not fine but it is what it is', turned into 'it's not fine and I don't want to die with regrets.'  And the truth was that as soon as he had come to Langridge's to sleep with a man, their fingers became Sherlock’s fingers, their face his, their bodies his and their cocks definitely his. When Fabian had arrived, his appearance so similar to Sherlock’s, it’d been far too easy for John to pay stupid money to indulge his deepest fantasy.
Sherlock bore down and nodded when strange turned to something more.  John’s fingers only ghosted over his prostate, but it was enough.
“It’s true though. You went to a hooker to learn how to shag him so you didn’t upset him, but you’ll happily shaft him emotionally.  If he relapses it’s your fault.”
“Best not,” Sherlock took the cuffs from John, slapped them around Fabian’s wrists and pulled him to his feet.
“No use giving me that look,” Bailey replied.  “Come on, Dr Watson, give me a firm ‘and-a one, and-a two’.”
“I’m sure the police will do everything they can.” John patted Fabian’s back.  He blushed when he noticed Sherlock’s gaze.  “Have you met Sherlock?”
“I approve of your methods of investigation in this matter, Doctor Watson.”  Sherlock carded his fingers through John’s hair.
“On it,” Sherlock said sprinting from the floor. He’d opened the front door to the ambulance crew before Mrs Hudson appeared. “Upstairs,” he instructed.
“John,” Sherlock whispered as the hot, slick channel engulphed him. He gripped John’s hips and drew back and pushed in slowly. His still-damp skin clung to John’s.
“Clothes. Off.”  Sherlock said as he worked on his cuffs and shrugged off his jacket.   He’d wrestled himself free of everything but his pants when he looked up to see John squeezing lube into his palm.
Lestrade waved Sally Donovan into his office and tasked her with retrieving the butt plug from evidence.   He sat back and rubbed his face with his hands.  “I don’t mind telling you that this case is doing my head in.”
John and Sherlock left.  Lestrade followed.  John caught his eye and suppressed a laugh until Lestrade started to giggle. Mycroft found them in the corridor, clutching either the walls or their stomachs, having dissolved into fits of laughter.  He rolled his eyes, tutted and left them, which, of course, made them laugh even more.
“I can see your fucking spy on this train, Mycroft,” Daniels texted.  “You said I wasn’t going to be arrested, but I see him, the bloody spook you set on me at Langridge’s.”  Daniels scratched at the injection site on his arm. It was bleeding. There was always bleeding.  “I’m going to kill your fucking agent,” Daniels texted to Mycroft. “Him and his accomplice.”
Since he’d moved back in, Sherlock noticed the tell-tale redolent signals that John’s hormones were reawakening. However, Sherlock pushed it to the back of his mind with the aim of making John and Rosie’s life at Baker Street perfect. In the desire to have John’s scent remain in the building, Sherlock neglected reading the tonal changes in that fragrance. And one should never, ever, neglect one’s beloved.
Sherlock heard the downright embarrassing noises he made against John’s neck.  Not that John seemed to notice; he grunted with every thrust of Sherlock’s cock.  His free hand grasped Sherlock’s backside so firmly it was almost painful.
The first few strokes were measured. Sherlock watched John’s face turn into a grimace of self-control. So Sherlock shoved back, and John’s body, at least, got the message. Sherlock watched John in the mirror, his eyes squeezed shut never looking at their reflections. But Sherlock couldn’t look away. He focused on John’s white-tipped fingers as they gripped Sherlock’s hips, the glistening droplets of sweat beaded on John’s brow and upper lip, and the bitten-off grunts John made with each thrust.
“Stop hanging around,” said a familiar voice from the sofa. It was the man who’d spoken earlier.  “He wants you to fuck him.”
The tension is building, though there is a bit of a reprieve in the form of the Met's radio operative.  For those of you who don't know who he is based on, I offer you a link at the end so you can experience the joy this man brings.
“I fear that, while Sherlock’s upbringing was good for his mind, it left gaps in other areas,” Mycroft admitted. “I admit that I have not encouraged his emotional development as, perhaps, I should. I, too, am rather short on that score.”
“Ta.” John took a sweet. Someone thumped on the cab door behind him.   And again.  And they screamed out various colourful curses.  Several others shouted, then the sound of footsteps.  “I don’t want to scare you, but he’s got a gun.”
John threw his head back as if in ecstasy.  The newcomers came in, went straight past them and walked towards the sex swing.  Sherlock could just see around John.  He recognised Jamie Reid, Dan Murphy but not the third man.
“Roll him over,” Sherlock barked.  Reid rolled, grabbed Murphy’s arms and waited.  Sherlock pulled Murphy towards him and slammed him over the side rail.  He heard Lestrade clatter downstairs towards them.
“I used to work in a sex show,” Nathan said.  “I’ve also worked in Avant-garde erotic theatre. I know how to make it look like it’s real, baby.  And, you know, I’m sure you’re great at ‘shamming’ in normal situations.  Sex is different though. It’s not words and acting. It’s obvious when someone’s moaning and groaning badly. John did the right thing in calling me.”
John paused. “You know what’s worrying me? The mess we’re going to make of your bedroom floor when your stonk-on goes down.”
(And, for all my cautious wording, I am not a Mary hater per se. I think there are flaws with the portrayal of all women in Sherlock, save for, perhaps, Mrs Hudson. That is not unusual; the TV and film industry is dominated by men, so we can't be surprised if they're not always great at writing female characters. I'm being very polite; just don't get me started on the portrayal of Irene Adler... Unless you want to hear a rant on how lesbians are represented by men, and, in which case, just say the word!)
John crawled over Sherlock’s body from the feet up. He peppered the skin he passed with random, dry little kisses.  He took a rather sinful suck at the head of Sherlock’s cock, then kissed the centre of his chest.
“Good,” Sherlock replied.  “Ask about money laundering too. I suspect it’s linked to the drugs and to Mark Tyler.”
“Yes, yes, yes,” Sherlock intoned.  He rested his forehead against John’s and breathed in his breath.  The heat, the sweat, the delicious friction; it all intoxicated Sherlock. He didn’t know up or down, black or white, nothing but the impending release getting closer and closer.
“’Course.” John put his hands under Sherlock's arms and dragged him, unceremoniously, to his feet. “You’ve made me wet.”
“You won’t tell my agent about this, will you?”  Candlar said before he’d even shaken Sherlock’s hand.   “She knows that I, well, dabble, but I don’t think she’d like me to be a member of Langridge’s.  The media are so judgemental about these things.”
“And you’ve shared your body with me and one or two other people,” John replied. “I don’t like the idea of one other person seeing you, let alone anyone else.”
John stood, stretched out his neck, and then got to his knees.   Sherlock’s breath hitched when John kissed the inside of his thighs and ran his strong fingers up Sherlock’s calves.
Sherlock took his weight on his elbows, burrowed his forehead against John’s neck and quickened his movements. John’s cries shook with the speed of Sherlock’s thrusts and he came again. His release added to a growing pool of warmth between their bellies.
“I expect we could just ask someone to come and deal with it,” Sherlock said. “We can have fun in that enormous bath again.”
“Do I?” John asked. He attacked an onion with his sharpest knife.  “I don’t like the idea of anyone but me seeing you naked or watching us.  You’re mine, Sherlock, aren’t you?”
“You need to turn the chair on first, before you sit. It’ll make sure you’re lined up properly.” Sherlock sat up in bed and watched John undress. “And put the hose thing on your…”
Sherlock flopped sideways and his softening dick slipped free. John moaned at the loss and crawled over to Sherlock. He didn’t say a word, just snuggled close until recovered from their exertions.
“Jason came to us as a result of a meeting I had in Milton Keynes.” Charles stroked his beard. “I invest in casinos, nightclubs and the like.  I met Jason at one of those venues.  He was, well, servicing a client at the time.”
The next few minutes passed in a blur. Rosie was breathing and on oxygen when John carried her downstairs and into the ambulance. Sherlock grabbed phone chargers, his wallet and keys, and then followed. When he got downstairs, the ambulance doors were still open.
“You’re special,” Sherlock said. “You’re my best friend. I care for you with a depth of affection I didn’t have for them.” And, oh bugger, he wanted to tell John that he loved him with every ounce of reasoning, or anything else, he had, and even some more besides.
“But we can hurt him, Lesley. And we can protect you and get you away from all of this,” John pleaded.  “But you need to help us because innocent people are dying.”
The CCTV monitoring room seemed even smaller than it was last time John saw it.  Donovan puttered around in the corridor, eyes focused on her phone.   She gave John a brief wave.
Sherlock’s death had triggered John’s second heat. He’d forgotten his suppressants, just as he’d forgotten almost everything but pure, sinking pain. In the end, John picked up a bloke from Grindr, wrapped industrial strength condoms around his Alpha cock, and ridden him until a broken, heat-ravaged John Watson had cried with exhaustion and sadness and sheer bloody desperation. Because,
“Is this about Peter?”  Nathan lifted his chin in defiance.  “Mark laughed it off, but I did hear it all, you know.”
’s in my day, called herself the dyke with a pipe.  Anyway, she wanted a kid, Charles offered and Elizabeth was born.  Elizabeth takes after her mother, I can tell you.  She’s a fan of the fairer sex.”
Piero shook his head.  “I hear his name and that he give money to Doubles.  My boss, Peter Matthews, is nervous of him.  He said he wanted to not need his money. Ah!  He also said Nathan, my colleague, liked him. I think they are lovers. I do not know if Tyler pays for Nathan’s time or whether he gives himself for free.”
Fabian’s mouth and chin glistened with saliva and his pink lips dropped open.   He wiped his mouth and nodded.
“Quite the contrary, John.” Sherlock put a hand on John’s shoulder.  “Mr Langridge may give something away in his jibes. Indeed, he may have done so already. I know this is…” Sherlock paused and sighed. “Uncomfortable for you.  However, I value your input.”
John grinned.  “No sorry.  Put your hand back here.” John steered Sherlock’s hand back to his erection. “Touch me. Fuck me. Make me come.” With one smooth motion, John rolled himself back until Sherlock was fully inside him again.  “Want me to take it slow?”
Sherlock turned them both around to look at Rosie.  She grinned as their attention focused on her. John leant back against his lover and looked over at his beautiful daughter, who was trying to pull her sock on her head like a hat.
“But it also means that there’s a way to pass messages that might be found. I wonder if Jason was involved in that. He may not have even known he was doing it, of course.” Sherlock paused.  “John, we need to speak to Lestrade.”
Dan Murphy had dark hair, almost black. His eyes were bright blue. He was quite beautiful.  Too beautiful not to miss.  Sherlock would have been attracted but Murphy wasn’t blonde enough, or short enough, or John Watson-y enough. Sherlock watched him through a two-way mirror as he was interviewed by Lestrade. Murphy had only just arrived back in London. The only way to make him return was to send a car to collect him. Lestrade was not impressed.
Sherlock had simply raised an eyebrow. “Don’t be absurd.” Downstairs, he’d grabbed his packet of Alpha condoms, thrown off his coat and toed off his shoes. When he got back to the bedroom, Ian had been on his knees with two fingers in his arse.
“And because we’ve shown some skin, people think we’re uninhibited,” Sherlock continued.  “Faking it will be even easier with me in your lap.”
John remembered the story and his cock twitched.  He fully intended to act out that particular fantasy entirely for Sherlock one of these days.
Sherlock washed John slowly.  He massaged his way down John’s back until he reached the crack of his arse.  John leant forward in an unmistakable invitation. Sherlock swept soapy fingers down into the cleft of John’s backside.  When his fingers skirted his hole, John pushed back until Sherlock’s forefinger entered him.
Sherlock snuggled closer. “Not necessarily. You just acted according to the information you had at the time. Besides, I think you met the right person at the right time. Sholto was right for you when you met him. Mary was the right person for you while I was gone. No one ever said it had to last.”
The Lounge comes equipped with sex toys. Of course.  And there's breakfast and there's heading back to Baker street. Oh, and some more smut. Just a soupcon.
“Shut up, the fucking lot of ya,” the reality TV star retorted.  “He’s gorgeous.  Go on love,” he yelled at the man on stage who stood motionless rubbing his head.  “Carry on, you’re doing well.”
Sherlock snorted. He wouldn’t have ever expected John to leave.  John was a doctor, a soldier. He was supposed to be good in a crisis.
“Protection from what?” Tears ran in thick lines down Nathan’s face.   John felt guilty that he and Sherlock had carefully not pointed out that Tyler and Shaw were not at liberty, even if they hadn’t been arrested in the fullest sense.  “Neither of them would hurt anyone. I know it.”
Tears ran down Sherlock’s face.  John knew they weren’t real. “He has sex with a man who looks like me.”   Sherlock patted John’s knee.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John groaned out. Sherlock looked up as John watched him in the mirror. There was something there, in that look, but Sherlock wasn’t skilled enough in reading softer emotions to decipher its meaning. Then John’s gaze dropped to take in Sherlock’s hand frantically pleasuring himself and, almost as if he were mesmerised, he began to thrust in and out of Sherlock’s body in response.
Sherlock shrugged.  When he looked back at John, he noticed he’d only undone his top two buttons.  “Can I undress John, maybe?” Sherlock smoothed the placket of John’s shirt.  “We could help undress each other, but I’ve rushed ahead.”
“Or, perhaps, ‘I’m sorry that you’re stressed about this situation, John. It was a shitty time to wind you up’.” John reached round to push his fingers into his own arse. His eyes fluttered shut.
“How about a little above the waist touching?” Nathan asked.  “Work your way down the body; it’s easy to remember and you’re not going to reveal anything sensitive.”
John mind was overtaken with a sudden image of Sherlock attempting to walk with the stonking erection John knew he had. He smiled and then stopped when he released the bed sheets beneath his arse were rather tacky.
“Leave it to me,” Mycroft interrupted.  “That is, if you were unsure, an order. I can add threats of violence if necessary.”
“John,” Sherlock gasped out, his head sagging between his arms. And the fingers were, almost immediately, gone. In fact, the draft of cold air behind him made it clear John had walked away.
“You know that you’re in increasing danger of spending the rest of your life with me,” Sherlock said.  “Especially if you make me come like that.  Cocaine is rubbish next to that sort of high.”
“And now he’s made his escape, leaving my addict brother in a fragile emotional state.” Mycroft narrowed his eyes.  “I really must tell Dr Watson next time I see him not to apply for work at any addiction treatment centres. I don’t think he’s ‘on-message’ as they say.”
“Yes, yes!” John threw back his head, his fist firm around his dick, and slicked their bellies in long surges as his body released years of sexual tension in orgasm. “Wow.” John chuckled. “Wow.”  He pulled Sherlock’s face down into a tender kiss that he hoped would convey how bloody amazing he felt.
“Found your prostate properly then,” John remarked. He screwed his fingers inwards and Sherlock hung on as his nerve endings twanged.
“According to Jason’s boyfriend, Simon Turner, Jason was afraid of heights, so tended to walk close to the walls as he navigated the upper floors.  It’s unlikely he fell.  We’re taking Simon’s statement tonight, and we’ve told him you and John will visit tomorrow. He seems fond of John, so it’s possible he’ll get more out of Turner than we did.  I’ve put an asterisk next to the gentleman who was entertaining John at the time of the incident.”
“We’re here to see Piero?” Sherlock said.  “We’re a bit early though. Do you have anywhere we can sit and just chill for a bit?” His accent was rougher than normal, his tone a maybe an octave higher.
When John came, it was with an intensity he didn't know was possible. Sherlock sucked and stroked John through his aftershocks.  His hands caressed John’s thighs and he moved up his body with a trail of kisses.  Sherlock circled John’s navel with his tongue and sucked his right nipple.  John’s body, spent from his orgasm, virtually jack-knifed in response.  Sherlock sniggered and lay across John’s legs.  He tugged at the nipple with his lips and grazed it with his teeth before he sucked it back into his mouth.
Mycroft glared at the woman through his eyebrows; Sherlock noticed and realised that his brother didn’t like her.   He looked back at the woman.  The suit really did look awful on her.  Sherlock wished he’d attended this meeting naked, he felt sure her response would have amused him.
John worried his lip with his teeth. He and Sherlock knew it wouldn’t be that simple. But, for now, they had to manage Nathan’s anger.
“Mycroft Holmes, you need to level with me because I’m tired and I’m fed up and I’m sick of everything to do with this case. Why is there a fucking Europol agent in a cell on my authority without you tipping me off on it?”
John pulled a face. He didn’t need to be told that the Holmes’ had a lack of emotional intelligence.   “That’s lovely, but what are we going to do?”
“The condom was from the dish of them on the glass wall,” Tyler answered.  “I think the police have them.  I didn’t see who gave me the lubricant. One of the guys on the sofa just passed it to me. There was a bright light on over the bed pit and I couldn’t see anyone around us.  Someone gave me the bottle and I used it.”
“John,” Sherlock whimpered. He spread his arms out wide and almost convulsed as he came in a hot rush inside John’s body. John sighed at the contact as he trailed his fingers of Sherlock’s come-streaked skin. “Happy?” Sherlock asked at last.
Sherlock shook his head and looked at Rosie, who mimicked the action.  “This, John, is a piece of probably Roman pottery.”
“Do you want a cuppa, before you go?”  John stood, desperate to stop the whole conversation.  He pressed his fingertips into his eye sockets until he saw grey mist.  When he took his hand away, Simon was gone.
“I don’t want to have this conversation,” John replied. “Why would I want to speak to you about Sherlock?”
John saw the jealousy in Bouchard’s expression.   He felt sad for him, in a way. He knew the feeling would not last for long. He wasn’t disappointed.
John flung his arms out. “Of course, I do, you doughnut. But we’re supposed to be trying to get you to out of me, not stay in there forever.” John’s exasperated movement caused his weight to shift and, with a slow but certain tilt, he started to roll off Sherlock’s body. Prone as he was, Sherlock couldn’t stop him. “Fuck, fuck, fuck!”
“A look at the prostitutes he visited showed that Justin Ellis took part in an S&M session with Daniels in Langridge’s dungeons.  He was assisted, probably unbeknown to Daniels, by Cox.  Brandon was under pressure; he owed money to Bouchard, to Candlar and to Daniels.  He may well have wanted to hurt or scare Daniels. My suspicion, and you must question Justin, is that Ellis left the room at some point and Daniels was alone with Cox, who lost control. Daniels knew Cox was allergic to Ibuprofen, so he later put some of his ibuprofen gel into a lube bottle. He stayed on at the club and made sure Tyler used it during sex with Cox.
John smiled. “I like the feeling of just clenching around something. It’s so good.  Mind you, we used a prostate massager on you last night, didn’t we love?  You came pretty ferociously as I recall.”
John clambered off the bed.  “I should think so,” he replied.  “I do have a reputation to consider.” And with that, John picked up the damp towels from their bath and threw one in Sherlock’s general direction. It landed squarely on his head.
Sharan looked into her side mirror.  “I think your friend is going to try and get in from the side or through the front window.”
John crawled up the bed a little way and flopped onto his back. Sherlock threw a leg over his hips and squirted lube into his hand. Then he leant forward until his and John’s cocks were side by side and wrapped his hand around them both.
“Do what you want with me,” the agent said in a voice that was nine-tenths wheeze. “Just let my daughter live. Please.”
As the week that John was in hospital progressed, Sherlock relaxed more.   The papers Mycroft had brought in were signed and returned.  It didn’t go unnoticed by Sherlock that the papers made John very happy indeed.  As for Sherlock, he was quietly relieved.  In fact, by the time John returned home, all the staff called Sherlock Rosie’s daddy. John did not seem to mind.
Sherlock and John go interview Mark Tyler's wife and the case takes a new turn.  Sherlock and John visit the Tyler's home and that just opens yet another can of worms.  Lestrade gets mangry.  Yes, mangry.  More bedtime things happen.
“Not important?  He’s just lost the person he loved and he’s not important?”   John stood and grabbed his coat from the arm of the settee.  “Sometimes, I really dislike being around you two.” John Watson walked out of the flat and down the stairs.
“I thought you might like one of your own,” Sherlock mumbled.  “We could have shared but that seems a bit, well, unhygienic.  This one can be programmed to your iPod, if you wanted to, of course.”  Sherlock realised he was gabbling and was silent as John ripped the foil free and opened the box.
“Vibrator, now,” John demanded, his eyes open.  Sherlock paused as he scrambled for the toy.  He leant back on his heels and John’s legs slipped down to the bed.  “Let me turn,” John said, and he rolled onto his front.  He got up on his knees, his elbows on the mattress and he presented his arse.  After he’d re-lubed the vibrator and his dick, Sherlock re-entered John.
“I was with Jean in my room on the third floor.  I give him a massage on his back and then the happy ending, I think you say it, with my mouth.”
“Salt and vinegar. Cheese and onion would have been too cheesy.” John chimed in on the last two words.
“Detective Inspector Lestrade,” Mycroft began in a booming voice.  “It is my duty to inform you that from this moment forward, this investigation will be taken over by the Organised Crime Tactical Support Team
Sherlock’s come oozed out of John and into his palm.  He kept his fingers in place until the intimate squeezes stopped, then wiped his hand on one of the dust sheets and used it to swipe at John’s chest and belly.  He helped John up and wrapped them both in their robes.
Sherlock couldn’t feel his right leg. Perhaps it was referred pain from his heart. The right side of his lower lip twitched.  It could be a stroke.   When he closed his eyes, he saw flashes of light. His pulse had risen, he knew it. He put his hand around his wrist to surreptitiously take his pulse.
“Just be calm and relaxed and she might get sleepy. We just don’t have to excite her.”  John flicked Sudacrem up his nose by accident. Rosie squealed with laughter.   Sherlock raised his eyebrows.  “I’ll just pop her back down in her cot and we’ll go downstairs.”
Sherlock sat back. He was on his knees, John was on his back before him, his legs draped over Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock grabbed the lube with slick fingers and immediately sent it flying. John caught the bottle and smiled.
“See all your spunk dribble out of my stretched hole?” There was a smile in that voice. “Fine, get on with it, then.”
“It seems daft,” Simon said.  He sat in the client chair. “But Charles is like me dad.  He picked me up off the street in Manchester, told me I was better ‘an ‘at and he bought me ‘ere.  I know sellin’ sex is sellin’ sex, but it’s still safer than a street corner. Or so I thought.”
“It took a while.” John shrugged. “Mary was good for me. She got me over you, you berk. But since, well, my old feelings have come back.” John looked down at his knees. “The truth is, I’ve remembered what it is to want you.
Sherlock texted Lestrade to ask to speak to Piero.  Lestrade told him it was the weekend and to fuck off. He also said that Dan Murphy would be back in London on Monday, so Sherlock could wait until then.  Sherlock stomped around the flat, yelled at the TV and generally behaved like a spoiled brat.  What surprised John was that Sherlock only did it for quarter of an hour.  Then, he sat down in front of the TV with Rosie and watched ‘In The Night Garden
“You’ve still got bloodstains on your chest.” John pointed to the marks and Sherlock looked down. “Oh, and a lovely crumbly spunk stain on your leg.” Sherlock lifted his leg. Flakes sloughed off onto the floor. “And, if we stay in here, I’ll call and ask for the sheets to be changed. That way, we start today clean and fresh.”
Sherlock lifted his head for a moment.  “Would I be correct in my deduction that you are experiencing some anal discomfort from our love-making yesterday?”
“I won’t last long.”  Sherlock’s arousal curled inside him into constricting cords that started to pull tighter and tighter.  He focused on control.  “I want you to come all over me.”
“A miscalculation. On Mary’s part. Pregnancy. Hormones. Heat. A mistake.” John closed his eyes and shook his head. This had all gone dreadfully wrong. Sherlock put a hand on John’s arm.
“The bottle needs to be checked for prints and, if you find Ibuprofen gel at Daniels’ office or home then it needs to be tested to see if it matches the gel used to kill Cox. You should interview Justin Ellis too.   Questions?”
John smiled and rubbed Sherlock’s somewhat diminished cock with his hand.  He winked.  “Another time.”  John sucked the head of Sherlock’s dick between his lips and swirled his tongue around the head.
John was in bed when Sherlock returned.  The room was dark, but John's eyes were acclimatised to the dim light. He stroked the small of Sherlock's back when he sat on the bed and took off his shoes and socks.
“Uh,” Sherlock moaned. “You’re not the only one.”  The heat and tightness of John’s body made him gasp.  John didn’t take it slowly.  He rolled his hips, rose and fell, as he fucked himself on Sherlock’s cock.   A clear drop of precome dripped from John onto Sherlock’s stomach.
“Just married,” Sherlock said, unabashed. He reached over and took John’s hand.  “We’ve  been together four years now. Seems like yesterday.”  Sherlock kissed his cheek. John blushed.
Daniels squinted at Mycroft’s image. “I fucking hate Doctors.” He held his phone so Mycroft could see Dr Watson unconscious on the floor. The Doctor started to twitch. Daniels put his foot on his neck.  “Make the girl stop screaming,” he demanded from Mycroft. He turned the phone towards the little girl.
The bathroom seemed bright. Sherlock didn’t know if John had followed him or he’d followed John, but they both stood on the black and white tiles while they stripped off their clothes in silence. Sherlock steadied John as he stumbled as he climbed in the bath by grabbing his arse. John smiled.
Sherlock nodded. He turned and looked up.  On screen, a muscular, tanned man had his back to the camera.  A similarly fit man sucked his dick.  It all seemed ridiculous, staged and sordid.  But, more than that, it occurred to Sherlock that sex was an act of trust.  Was that the reason it had never appealed to him?  He looked back towards John.
Sherlock remembered the choking. He looked at John, who’d blushed up rather gorgeously. “Sounds good to me,” he said. “If you still want that.”
John sighed and closed his eyes again. He shook his head, smiled and opened his eyes as he leant forward in his chair. “Sherlock, I don’t want you to protect me during my heat. I want you to have sex with me.”
John rested with his legs astride Sherlock’s waist.   “You know, I wondered if I should come in here and forbid you to touch me while I opened myself up and fucked myself on that dildo you have in that drawer.” He motioned to the bedside cabinet.  “Thing was, that conversation with Nathan made me realise that I wanted you inside me. I didn’t want to be apart. I wanted us to be together. Joined.”
“I’m a doctor,” he said as he approached the people that encircled the fallen.  “Let me through, I’m a doctor.”
Sherlock smiled.  “It seems that you’ve described us both.  Since I never expected to be happy at all, what you’ve done verges on the miraculous.” He turned off the shower and reached for towels.  “Might I suggest we make a drink and read for a while? I do have a fascinating book about murder rituals that would suffice for some bedtime reading.”
but the fact Daniels had waved a gun around on a train must have been a convincing reason to keep Daniels in prison.
“Mrs Hudson,” John said with a smile.  “If everything went wrong, I was going to call her.  If she didn’t hear anything, then she knew it all went well.”
Sherlock chuckled.  He’d only lasted so long was because he kept picturing his brother in a PVC faux-nurses outfit.  “You can’t speak. The noises you make, should be illegal.”
“Come on,” John said.  He looked at Sherlock, his face as flushed red as his eager cock.  The sounds of his hands working over and inside him filled the air.  “Uh.”  John’s hips lifted again.  “Please, Sherlock. I need you.”
“I never thought I’d be able to tell you that I love you,” John replied. “That way, anyway.” John let his fingers barely brush Sherlock’s skin.  “I like it.”
Sherlock looked up at him. “I told you, I’m not the typical Alpha.” He licked a bead of precome from John’s cock before he took the tip into his mouth and gave it a long, pleasing suck.
Later, after his statement was taken, John went back to Lestrade’s office and found Sherlock and the DI poring over paperwork.
When John met Sherlock, he’d started the suppressants again. The Alpha scent of Sherlock had intoxicated him; he smelt of cleverness, occasional moral turpitude, and dirty sex. John Watson wanted all of it.  Sherlock wanted none of John, or at least that’s what he’d said. However, John had sensed Sherlock’s arousal no matter how much Sherlock tried to mask it. But, in the end, John was too scared, too wounded, and too ready to be pushed away. Lust turned to love, and that love had become too important to risk.  The suppressants and a constant stream of Beta women kept John’s libido in check. Just. But still, John had
“And once Fabian met Daniels, he found the one he loved, and you couldn’t save him either,” Sherlock added.  “It must have killed you to know he loved someone so cruel.”
“Well, we’re going to have your heat together and then, afterwards, what will happen?” Sherlock shrugged and spread his hands wide as if this would, somehow, make his question clearer.
“Last time I let you do a urine test in private, I discovered that you had a bottle of someone else’s urine you use for these occasions. You’re doing this test in my presence.”
“No,” Candlar said.  “If you ask me, they’re accidental. Horrible and coincidental, but accidental. Brandon was dreadfully allergic and Jason hated being on the upper floors of the building. It all seems logical to me that these were entirely accidental incidents.”
John pushed a knee between Sherlock’s legs and thrust against him. The slipperiness heightened the feeling when their bodies rocked together. John wriggled his hand between their bodies to align their cocks.
The Ambulance Technician, who was driving the vehicle, yelled back from the front. “I can’t believe it, it’s like all the traffic lights are on our side.”
Sherlock’s stomach flipped. “If you think that sort of slutty behaviour is going to reduce my refractory period, you are mistaken, John.  To use your vernacular, I couldn’t get it up with a splint.”
“He will be okay, won’t he?”  Sherlock said.  He wasn’t even sure he’d said it until he heard Mycroft’s voice catch.
Sherlock chose that moment to take John’s penis into his mouth as far as he could.  He rolled John’s balls in his hand and lifted his head until just the tip of John’s dick was between his lips. He then lowered and sucked him into his mouth. He did this over and over until John started to slightly thrust into Sherlock’s mouth.  He tried his best not to, but it was impossible not to entirely.
Sherlock sucked John’s fingers even as he pulled them slowly from his mouth with a filthy pop. “John Watson,” he replied. He planted his hands firmly on John’s hips and encouraged him into a more regular rhythm. “Every time.”
“Wassup, bro?” Sherlock said as he flung open the office door.  He flopped into a seat as John caught the swinging door and closed it gently.   Mycroft waited until the good doctor was also seated.
“Can you reach around me to the dildo?” Sherlock slid close to John’s back and his cock slipped between John’s arse cheeks. “Try and, oh!” John rotated the toy slightly. “Well, I think we can class that as a success.”
It was in this state that Mary appeared, pictured by John at the foot of Sherlock’s bed, arms crossed and wearing a warm smile.
"You mean you don't want to sleep on thousands of pounds every night?"  John opened the covers for the naked Sherlock to slip under them.   Sherlock lay on his back, John on his side. "I asked Mycroft. Apparently, no bank will accept all that cash. He's looking into options for me."
Sherlock giggled. He tried to talk but laughter took the place of words and soon he was almost in tears, gasping for air.
Sherlock looked at John. The EpiPen was unused on the floor. John concentrated on CPR. His own intervention. No rescue breaths. John was panicking. Rosie. Mary. Rosie.
Sherlock propped himself up a little. The kitchen floor before them was puddled with arcs of John’s come, and Sherlock’s inner-Alpha preened with the visible evidence of his virile deeds.
Before the fall, John had taken heat suppressants and so Sherlock was spared the indignity of resisting John at his most tempting. When Sherlock had returned to London afterwards, John was with Mary, and, soon after, the heat suppressants were gone. Whatever self-control, whatever strength Sherlock had thought he had, was tested. After one particularly close shave, when a case had finished only just before John’s heat began, Sherlock’s rut had been triggered, and he’d nearly rubbed himself raw with several newly acquired items of John’s wardrobe. Eventually, Sherlock had cracked before his penile skin did. He found a surprisingly nice man on Grindr, who’d wrapped Sherlock’s cock in industrial-strength condoms and ridden him like a man possessed.
Two weeks after his relationship with Alex had fizzled into nothing, a man, Peter, who’d heard about Sherlock’s irrepressible cock, asked him to share his heat. In the spirit of experimentation, Sherlock had agreed. Four days later, Peter had fancied himself in love and Sherlock had been utterly appalled. In retrospect, leaving Cambridge and his possible life in academia was an overreaction on Sherlock’s part, but it had succeeded in removing Peter from his life.
With Sherlock on a case and John sharing his time between babysitting Sherlock and being a daddy to Rosie, there hadn’t a repeat of their pre-heat warm-up sex. Indeed, when Sherlock and John finally returned to 221B Baker Street with the case solved, they did little more than share a takeaway, have a quick snog, and head to their own respective bedrooms for some well-deserved sleep.
“Good.” Sherlock’s voice was a high-pitched little murmur.  He cleared his throat and said it again, “Good.”
“Sure thing, pal,” Jamie said. He drank his coffee in one long swig and stood.  “See ya’s soon, yeah?”  And, with a cheeky wink as a parting shot, Jamie left the café.
“It was a strategic fall,” Sherlock added. “The bruise. I fell strategically in order to shift the body-weight of my attacker in such a way that I could…”
“That was the most unsatisfying orgasm I have ever had,” John said. “I’ve got to have you, Sherlock. Fuck the last mouthful.
“Roger was worth his weight in gold,” Sherlock muttered John’s tongue flattened against the base of his cock and he lowered his mouth as far as he could. It was good. Very good. John followed his mouth down over the shaft with one hand, then lowered his mouth down again. His hand naturally covered the section John’s mouth couldn’t comfortably reach. Roger deserved a sodding knighthood.
John opened the box with a silly smile.  Sherlock had bought the ring from a jeweller who owed him a favour, while John was in hospital.
“So, nothing.” John cut him off. “Come here.” John leant forward, eyes on Sherlock’s lips.  The gap between them closed inch by inch until those beautiful, crooked, soft lips were against his.  John didn’t have time for tentative. He tilted his head, opened his mouth and slipped his tongue between Sherlock’s lips.   He tried to put every ounce of emotion he held into the kiss, to show his love.  It wasn’t enough, not for him and not for Sherlock. He drew back. They were still so close Sherlock was a little fuzzy.  Sherlock’s breaths ghosted over his wet lips.  “I love you,” John said, inches from another kiss. “I love you so much.”
John lifted his head and dragged Sherlock down into a kiss.  “I recognise his voice,” John said.  “From the pit, when we caught Fabian out.  He was there.”
“Thank you.  Now, if you will excuse me, I need to be debriefed myself on what information I can share. For now, Mr Tyler is merely a suspect. In the interim, Detective Lestrade, might I ask that you allow Sherlock and John to speak to Piero Fibonacci tomorrow? I think the conversation might prove fruitful.”
Charles Langridge looked harried.   The thick bags beneath his eyes betrayed to Sherlock that the murders in his club had clearly affected his bottom line.  The rather buoyant mood he’d exhibited in their previous encounters was no more.
John giggled.  “I’ve done no such thing.  You didn’t need any encouragement at all.  I’ve started to get all leaky.”
“Thank you for your cooperation, Sherlock. I did worry that you might feel territorial in light of Mr Bouchard’s relationship with John.”
“Like I give a shit what they think,” John answered. He tried to get his volume control back down.  “As far as they know, it’s shamming. Only we need know the truth.”
“Let’s leave it ‘til last,” Lestrade suggested.  “I want to get a picture of how large an area we need to control along with all the entrances and exits.”
Sherlock’s brain bubbled with the knowledge that when John came Sherlock’s body would absorb more little bits of his DNA. If there was anything Sherlock needed, it was more and more John Watson. His balls tightened and he squeezed the root of his cock to halt his impending knot and release. “Come inside me, John,” Sherlock whispered. “Fill me with you, John. Do you remember what comes next? You’re going to come inside me and then sink down on my cock and fuck your release, your DNA, John, into me. You’re going to fuck me in every way you can and I will love every single moment.”
“You ought to see the wedge of cash my missus’ got. She used to work with Rosa. That’s how I met her,” Mark said.  “She knew we’d be a good match, even if it is mostly a professional relationship.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “She doesn’t do it anymore,” Mark said quickly.   “I promise.”
Madame Jojo’s was a legendary burlesque/cabaret/comedy/music club in Soho in London. It’s apparently reopening in 2018.
The loved LockedinJohnlock is responsible for shepherding my commas and odd wording into some semblance of grammatical effectiveness.  I take the dubious credit for any remaining errors.
“Bitter and twisted sounds more like us,” Sherlock said.  “There’s nothing straightforward about us. Nothing conventionally romantic or sweet.  I jumped off a roof in front of you, your wife shot me, and you blamed me for her death before having copious amounts of sex with a man who looked a bit like me.  I think bitter and twisted sounds fine.  At least we’ve twisted together and not apart.  God, that sounded trite. You should shoot me now.”
Doesn't it seem like ages since I posted the last chapter?  Two weeks of Friday posting and suddenly, Saturday seems ages away.  Even for me, and I know what's going on.  Maybe.  Anyway, thank you for everyone who has held in there with me so far. Your enjoyment of this little story makes me very happy.
Sherlock didn’t respond. He got up and readied himself to sleep, touched when John followed him. They stood side by side at the sink and brushed their teeth. They got in bed, and John curled up at his side, head on Sherlock’s chest. All the same, Sherlock couldn’t quite shake the notion that he’d wake up alone. He thought about it for a long time but, eventually, drifted off to sleep.
Sherlock grinned and then repeated the action while rubbing John’s perineum.  His blue eyes radiated enjoyment.
“I don’t know,” Fabian shrugged. “Jean is very vocal, you know?  I didn’t hear anything until Simon screamed.  Jean had just come. Would you like to see the condom?”
“A drug drop,” Sherlock replied.  “We have to assume that if the Marquês even knows that Daniels has been arrested, he’s arranged to have someone else collect the drugs. We have to hope he hasn’t cancelled the drop altogether.”
Nathan’s pants were still in place but, over the top, he wore a strap-on harness complete with a bright blue dildo in front of his cock. He reached back and grabbed the chair Sherlock kept in the corner of the room.   Nathan pulled up his trousers but left them open.  “Can we dim the light in here?”
“Shush, John,” Sherlock said. He took John’s jeans from him and stuffed them into an evidence bag.   “I’ve already spoken to Mycroft.”  He started to pull at John’s jumper. “Besides, this really is a very classy brothel as these things go.”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. She had the good grace to blush before she walked out of the room.  Sherlock noted that her Louboutins were fake.
Sherlock reappeared.  “Are we getting up now or not?  I thought I might make tea. Would you like a bacon sandwich?  I can start washing Rosie’s fruit as well.”
Sherlock stood. He put both hands on the table and leaned over until he was close to Fabian’s face. “You deserve nothing,” he said.  “And you’ve had quite enough of John Watson’s time.”
“Sherlock, for God’s sake, I…” The phone went dead. Sherlock was gone. “I love you,” John whispered.
“Bullshit,” John said.  Lestrade stood next to Mycroft and he at least really did look surprised.  “You know I’ve been coming here for weeks.  I know you, remember?”
“You worked as a prostitute at first?” Sherlock asked.  He looked at John, an unspoken question hung between them.   John knew that Sherlock wondered just how many of the men he’d slept with.
“So, Detective Inspector Lestrade said that you were worried there would be another assault?”  Charles said.
Sherlock walked over to this chair and looked at the Doubles card on the armrest. Candlar would cancel it now. All attempts to visit the club discretely would be lost.  Sherlock picked up his mobile. It was time to call in a favour.
John’s scent intensified, and Sherlock’s cock got stiffer. John’s motions made the cupboard door rattle, and Sherlock took the biggest bite of banana he could.
Doubles wasn’t any classier on the return visit.  Sherlock and John were asked to wait in the bar area to be entertained by a gentleman called Billy who demonstrated his ability to insert his own penis into his bottom.   Sherlock didn’t know whether to be impressed or alarmed. By the look on John’s face, he felt the same.  When Nathan, a fit-looking man with ebony skin and a warm smile, collected them from the waiting area, Sherlock bundled John out while he was mid-lecture on penile fractures.
“And what were Jason’s duties at the brothel?”  Sherlock put his fingertips together and turned his gaze to John.  The two men focused only each other as Simon began to speak.
John took a hanky from his pocket and used it to lift Matthews’ head.   “Blood vessels in his eyes have burst.”  John used the hanky to feel at the neck of the corpse.  “Hyoid’s broken.” He lifted one of Matthews’ hands.  “And abrasions on the fingertips.  He tried to pull the garrotte away from his neck. From the looks of the marks, I’d guess the garrotte was a cord or a thin rope rather than wire. The abrasions are rope burn rather than wire cuts.”
Sherlock rubbed his knees; they were dinted and sore from the hard floor. The bedroom was definitely an excellent idea.
“I’ve wanted you for so long,” John said. He reached out a hand, which Sherlock took, and dragged him down onto the bed.  The kiss they shared started gently and then turned desperate. John rolled Sherlock onto his back and kissed him with real passion.
“Until just now, he’d been unconscious for the past…” John checked his watch. “Eleven minutes. He’s somewhat agitated and, in his distress, has just banged his head on the floor. Original injury was caused by, well, er…”
Mycroft looked a little pale.  Sherlock knew damn well that Mycroft rather liked Lestrade.  He would even grudgingly admit that they were connected because they both cared for Sherlock.  Even though Sherlock could interrupt, the truth was that Mycroft had kept Tyler being a Europol agent quiet from them too.  As a result, he was happy to sit back and watch Lestrade rip Mycroft a new backside.
“The Englishman will not get into the Mercedes with the doctor and his daughter unless you ask nicely. SH”
“Ugh.” Sherlock waved his hand in front of his face.  “Whenever.  I spoke to your…” Sherlock stopped abruptly.   “Lestrade. We have to speak to Simon today.”
A cord swished as it went around Sherlock’s neck and he jammed his fingers beneath.  Above him, he spotted a familiar pair of feet.  Sherlock dropped to his knees and he saw John jump over him.   Murphy flew backwards when John hit him. Rather than be choked by the cord, Sherlock threw his body back too.  The thin garrotte brushed harmlessly upwards, over his face and head.  Sherlock turned to see Murphy balanced on the edge of the fire escape railing.  His body tipped backwards but not before John grabbed one of Murphy’s arms and Reid the other.
“This is shit,” said one of the men on the sofa.  He had ginger hair and wore an Anthrax t-shirt.  “If this is what passes for VIP entertainment, can you imagine what it’s like in the main lounge?”  He hooted with laughter.
“We were making a point,” John replied.  “Nathan’s the expert. You and I don’t know how to fake this.”
“I think it were inconvenient.”  Simon looked at his shoes.  “But I think he were ‘appy, in a way.  I mean, Jase was the baby of us all, you know?  I think we all liked to look after ‘im and Charles were no exception.  Besides, he needed people on reception after that bloody woman left.”
Sherlock handed Mycroft a cup of tea and walked around the living room in the opposite direction, occasionally sipping from his own cup.  “Tell me about Stephen Daniels,” he demanded.
Sherlock sat back, fingers steepled beneath his chin.  The low light made his cheekbones more pronounced.  John was captivated.
“Oh, Sherlock.” John gripped the armrests of the chair and made silent ‘o’s’ with his lips with each stroke of the chair and pass of Sherlock’s lips. “Make me come, sweetheart. Please.”
“Faster,” John whispered with a desperation that made Sherlock respond. “Faster.” He reclined and Sherlock saw John’s pale form spread before him in the dim light.  He clutched John’s hips and drove in and out.
Sherlock pressed in a little, then withdrew. He swept soapy fingers all over John’s backside and rinsed.   Sherlock inserted a wet, soap-free finger into John.   After a few thrusts, punctuated by John’s gasps, he lifted John’s bum and lowered his head.  Sherlock pushed his tongue into the opening. The reaction was instantaneous.
“Not really,” Nathan replied. “But thank you for asking.  How confident are you that all that stuff’s gone?”
At this precise moment, John Watson worried that it wasn’t the mechanics of sex with a man he should have practised.  One word stopped his heart and made him want to cry.
“Do that again.  Yes, yes.”  John pressed his open mouth to Sherlock’s neck.  He moved forward against Sherlock’s cock, then back against his hand.    Sherlock pulled out his finger and pressed another alongside it and into John.  He found the spot again and John roared.
John nodded and disappeared to the bathroom to brush his teeth and hair and then put on a squirt of aftershave.  He grabbed his mobile and then went back out into the living room.   John watched Sherlock do Rosie’s nappy. She giggled and kicked as he puffed out his cheeks and tried to wrestle her into a fresh nappy.  He realised that if anyone told him a year ago that Sherlock would be his lover and that he’d willingly change Rosie, John would have called them a liar.  Now everything he’d ever wanted was in front of him and they were pulling faces at each other.  Time was a strange thing.
John wore an odd smile and he reached up to stroke Sherlock’s cheek.  “You got it right.  I wanted sex every single time.  Just lately, I’ve wanted you so badly I can’t tell you.  I woke up yesterday morning shagging your pillow. You were in the shower.  Did you not wonder why I was changing the bedclothes at that time of the morning?  And what about last Wednesday?”
“At a pinch, Imodium will stop the digestion process, but I don’t buy it,” Nathan said. “I mean, why go there?”
“In more ways than one,” John said. “Look, I’m sorry I left you to sort yourself out.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “You did sort yourself out, didn’t you?”
“Oh fuck, fuck, fuck,” John gasped out as he climaxed again. His body shuddered with ecstasy and he pulled Sherlock’s arms closer around him. “Bugger me, that was great.” John twisted his head for an awkward sideways kiss. Seemingly content, John wriggled against Sherlock’s body and pushed his hips back, which, in turn, shoved Sherlock’s cock deeper. They both tumbled into orgasm again, expressed in nuzzled, moaned chuckles and soft kisses.
Sherlock walked into the bathroom and took his place sat on the closed loo lid. John put the light on and retrieved the kit from under the sink.
“In,” Sherlock moaned. His body felt boneless but now utterly empty. “In.” John pressed in a warm finger and even that made another softer wave of ejaculation.
John and Sherlock had been sat in the front room of 221B for forty minutes, silently sat in their chairs, staring into space. They’d just returned home from the former Holmes family home. Eurus would be back at Sherrinford by now, Mycroft would be in the arms of Lestrade and here, silently, Sherlock and John just sat.
“It’s perfect,” John said. “You’ve got no idea how many arsehole Alphas Omegas deal with on a daily basis. Believe me, I love that you’re nothing like them.”
However, eighteen hours later, Sherlock was awoken by John shaking him violently. It was eight in the evening and John smelt
“Listen to me,” Mycroft said. “I promise you that I’ll stop the train and send a car to pick you up and take you anywhere you want to go. Or a helicopter. Just let Dr Watson and his daughter go free.”
Sherlock stretched.  It was nine fifty-seven in the morning.  He’d only climbed into bed a few hours prior, but his brain whirred at full speed.  He heard John pottering around the kitchen and Rosie throwing something around in the living room.  Sherlock smiled.  He’d never have thought that domesticity suited him.
“Ah, ah.” John rolled forward and Sherlock took his hands.  His body spasmed around Sherlock’s cock.  John’s head lolled.   “You need to take over,” John said.  “Take what you need.”
“Rosie’s going to stay with Harry and Mrs Hudson is going to her sister’s place,” John replied. “All sorted. Did you have any, y’know, questions?”
Once Mary got pregnant, John stopped the Alpha hormones. He and Mary had been told that, as her pregnancy progressed, she would become increasingly affected by John’s recovering heats. Even though Mary had been a Beta, John’s oestrous would trigger a response in her that was more commonly associated with Alphas. Her own rising hormone levels would make her more susceptible. It was just one of those things that might, but probably wouldn’t happen. It’d all seemed fine. Then, a month from Rosie’s birth, there was a change.
“So, Mr Holmes, as much as I appreciate your concern, fuck the hell off.” John took a deep breath.  “I was a soldier, Sherlock, and I am a medic. I know how to look at what I’m asked to do and calculate risk.  Just because I’m not a genius doesn’t mean I haven’t analysed the risks and the benefits of this operation. I have.  We’re going to be in a room, snogging, surrounded by policemen. So, get a fucking grip with your ‘alone saves me’ bullshit and look at the people around you who you can rely on.”
“Not that we know of.  It is possible that Daniels visited Liverson in Milton Keynes for his services, but we can’t be sure.”
“You know, I was quite willing to leave you out of the drugs bust if you’d asked,” Sherlock said.  “I’m glad you didn’t, but it’s strange. I’ve never felt this way; the way I feel about you and about Rosie.  Of course, I was always willing to lay down my life for you and your family.  I expected this to feel the same. It isn’t. Not at all.  My thoughts of you consume me.
John lifted his head and felled Sonny with a classic rugby ankle-tap.  Sherlock leapt from the sofa and brought down Murphy metres shy of the exit.   He heard Lestrade shout in his ear but focused on trying to get control of the wriggling Murphy, whose legs were splayed beneath his chest.  Sherlock needed to change grip.  When he did, Murphy kicked Sherlock in the sternum.  Sherlock cried out in pain. Unable to stop himself, he let go and felt, rather than saw, someone clamber over him.  He looked up to see the tattooed leg of Jamie Reid disappear out of the exit behind Murphy.
“Are you coming in with us?” the female paramedic asked Sherlock.  “What d’you think’s best for the little one?”
John leant forward and took both of Piero’s hands in his. The police officer sat up and looked a little suspicious about the contact but did not intervene.  John glanced at him. Sherlock knew the Watson warning glance well enough and it worked as effectively as it normally did.
Without further hesitation, John wrapped one hand around the root of Sherlock’s cock and took the head into his mouth.  Sherlock tasted salty and warm. The skin beneath John’s tongue was soft and responsive with each flick, suck or movement rewarded with an intake of breath or yearning sound. It might have been the hottest thing John had ever done.
Moobs. Do we all know that moobs are man boobs?  If you don't, please consider this your translation. :-)
John quirked his lips. He walked around the bed and opened the drawer. Sherlock had forgotten about the photo. It’d been taken by Molly. Sherlock’s birthday. Sherlock was wearing the hat and John looked tired after his outburst of emotion. Their arms were so close together on the pub table it looked like they were holding hands. John stroked the glossy surface of the image and put it on the top of the bedside cabinet. The lube was underneath. Sherlock knew what sort of picture that painted. John didn’t say a word.
“It’s only when he’s angry,” Sherlock said through tears.  He stroked the inside of John’s thigh and oh, that was dangerous because of the just-wearing-pants-thing.
John let him go.   He scratched his bollocks and then picked up his daughter.  “Morning beautiful.  How’s your nappy?  Poo! We’ll change that, shall we?”  He pulled her changing mat over to his still-made bed, undressed her lower half and started to deal with the napocalypse.
Piero Fibonacci looked dazed.  His dark hair was dull and his olive skin looked pale. He looked unkempt.  Even though he’d met him only once before, Sherlock deduced that Piero was a man who cared about how he looked and presented himself. Therefore, his appearance was both a bad sign and a useful, illuminating one for Sherlock.
“Quite,” Sherlock said.  “The doors are about to open.  John and I will stay in the locker room until the doors have opened.”
With a quick glance at the retreating form of Daniels, John grabbed the handle of Rosie’s chair and ran in the direction of the train driver’s cab.  His mobile rang. Sherlock. He answered on the hoof.
Sherlock had been home a little over four months. The wedding arrangements had begun. Things weren’t back to normal, but they were headed that way. Sherlock liked Mary. Mary liked Sherlock. And Sherlock was in the process of settling. He never expected to be with John, not in the way John and Mary were, but he had hoped he and John would remain together without a third wheel. That said, if there was a third wheel to be had, Sherlock was pleased it was Mary. All the same, he resented John not living at Baker Street.
John took a deep breath.   He remembered the length of the journey to Sherrinford.  The journey simply wasn’t possible if they were to be at Langridge’s before the brothel officially opened.   “Fu-u-udge.”
“Sherlock, are you attracted to me?” John crossed his legs. His V-neck jumper was dark blue, and it made John’s eyes look like stormy seas. John’s hair shone silver and gold in the strengthening spring sunlight. Sherlock had loved John Watson for so long that unrequited love was now just another facet of his personality.
“Hell yes,” the stranger behind John agreed.  Murphy didn’t need to be asked twice.  Sherlock winced at the force Murphy used.  Reid grabbed Murphy’s hands, which were digging into the stranger’s hips, and used them to pull himself onto the stranger’s cock deeper.
Sherlock leant down and, just before their lips met, said, “About here.”  Sherlock kissed well. He kissed as if he had all the time in the world, and that he wanted to taste and caress every millimetre of John’s mouth. It was thorough, arousing, devastating.
“Not a word,” John said, his expression stormy.  Without another word, he pressed his mouth against Sherlock’s. His tongue bullied Sherlock’s out of the way and flicked around Sherlock’s mouth in a not entirely good way. As if he noticed Sherlock’s ambivalence, John dropped to his knees and dragged Sherlock’s pants and pyjamas down.  He wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s not disinterested cock and shoved it into his mouth.
“You stay there, Dr Watson,” Jacob said. “You let Jacob take care of you.” He draped their clothing over the foot of the bed, then let off the brake. “Could I take the remote from you, Mr ‘Olmes?” Sherlock handed it over and Jacob pressed a few buttons and the hospital room doors swung open.
“I want to reassure you, John, that I have excellent control,” Sherlock said. He walked over to the bed and sat down next to John. “More than many Alphas. Maybe all others. I don’t know. But won’t hurt you.
John chuckled and motioned to their waiter who swiftly delivered dessert.   It was well-worth every second of lost romance.
“I know, sweetheart, I know.” John reached around Sherlock’s body to ease out the vibrator and turn it off.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. John merely raised an eyebrow and tilted his head towards Jamie.  Reid lay splayed on the metal landing. Impressively, he’d managed to maintain an erection throughout the chase.   Sherlock offered him a hand to help him to his feet.  He accepted Sherlock’s hand, let him help him to his feet and then nodded down at his dick.
“For a bit,” Simon admitted. “Then Jase came.  When I met him, I knew I couldn’t go shaggin’ other blokes. Neither of us could.”
“They made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. The Marquês was suspicious. It’s been a slow process to make it back into his circle.”
John moved his hand in time with his head up and down Sherlock’s cock. He hollowed his cheeks, sucking hard, for a dozen relentless strokes and then pulled away.  “That seems to be in order.” John’s voice sounded breathless and aroused, even to his own ears.
“Do you know, some people swear that conditioner makes the best lube?” John asked him.  “A lot of guys in the army swore buy it. None of it smelled this nice, though.”
“I’m not good at delayed gratification.” Sherlock tried to lift himself up again to meet John’s body with his. “I don’t like being teased.”
“And that’s precisely why you’re wearing them,” Sherlock replied.  “You can’t ponce around in Soho the way you normally look because you look like a middle-aged doctor called John Watson.”  He walked into the room.  His hair was slicked back. Before John registered what he wore, Sherlock’s coat was on and he’d marched out of the flat.  “Come along, John.”
The road here was a strange one. His sister was gay for fuck's sake. If it was good enough for her, then it was worth a try. When he’d first kissed a boy, to John it felt like an act of unity. Harry’d thought he was taking the piss. John and Harry just never did get along. Not until recently.
Sherlock nodded, grimly.  “So, why don’t you tell me about where you were at the time of the murder?”
“Hmm,” Mycroft’s voice came from behind Sherlock. “Rosie looks rather messy.  She may have to stay with Anthea.”
John twisted in Sherlock’s arms, his eyes and mouth open, and he came against the headboard. It was, quite possibly, the most erotic thing Sherlock had ever seen, and, in sympathy, he was wracked with another orgasm himself. The extra flood of release made John’s eyes flutter and yet more semen gushed over Sherlock’s hand, which was still wrapped around John’s pulsing cock. They both collapsed forward and grabbed at the stained headboard in an attempt to stay on their knees.
That said, Sherlock was tired. He lay in bed and considered the events of the day. He’d dismissed Simon as a suspect immediately. He had nothing to gain from Jason’s death and his dominant emotion had been grief.  As it was, with his lover and second income gone, he’d probably lose his flat and return to prostitution.  There’d also been a number of witnesses who vouched for Simon being on the ground floor at the time of the incident. His reaction to the death of his lover was entirely consistent with bog-standard grief and shock.  Simon, then, was of little use.  He also wore ghastly shirts.
“Who would stand to lose from Brandon and Jason’s deaths?”  John asked. He wasn’t expecting an answer.
As gently as he could, Sherlock eased his teeth from John’s neck, then laved over the wound, cleaning it with his tongue.  He wrapped one arm around John while he gripped the headboard with the other.
“How many times can you come?” John tipped his hips back and forth, using his muscles to milk Sherlock’s cock. “I want you to fill me up until it’s leaking out around your knot because I can’t hold anymore. I love feeling full, Sherlock. I want it all. Every bit of you.”
“It’s an Omega chair.” Sherlock grinned. “I haven’t seen one in some time. Had a case once where a lady had hers stolen and, of course, I was able to return it. She paid me incredibly well. Said the chair was better than her husband and cheaper to run."
In this chapter, Mycroft is protecting people in power and Sherlock and John receive some alarming news from Molly.  There are sexy times and then there are some not so good times courtesy of Dr Watson.  Mycroft is a surprisingly good brother.
“No need. I still get your blood test results,” John replied. After Mary, Euros and Sherlock’s fall off the wagon, rebuilding trust was, well, a process. “You’re clean and so am I. I had a blood test before we spoke about sharing my heat. Results are…”
“Please,” John whimpered after a while. Sherlock stroked John’s cock faster, with more intent, and John cried out with each thrust.
“I phoned Mr Langridge last night and he agreed to pop that up,” Lestrade said.  “That way we can have a good look around without being disturbed.”
John closed his eyes. Everyone clearly expected him to be gagging for sex. However, John was more concerned by Sherlock’s absence. As soon as they’d separated, John started to feel panicky, lost and alone. His need for Sherlock’s return was absolutely palpable, and, at least for the present, that was all that concerned him.  John walked to the bed and started to rearrange pillows and sheets into a nest before he caught himself.
Simon was a thin, blonde man of average height and in his mid-twenties. He’d grown up in Manchester and been brought to Langridge’s brothel by Charles.
“You sexy bastard,” he heard John whisper as his heart rate slowly returned to normal.  John had moved and lay on his side facing Sherlock.  His head was rested on his hand and he looked ruffled and gorgeous.  “You look like an angel and fuck like the devil. I bet I’ve got spunk in my fucking windpipe, you were so far inside me, you mucky git.”
“Good,” John encouraged. “It’s all okay, just inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth.”
Rosie woke up at five in the morning.  When John got to her cot, she interspersed yells with talking to her feet.
They walked back out into the main corridor, then took the door on the right. Again, there were three doors that led from the right-hand wall.   All three rooms were small; the first and the third included two-way mirrors that faced a central space which housed a large bed.
“Love you,” John replied.   Sherlock reached around to take John’s cock in his hand.  John’s grasp dropped to his balls and he groaned.  Sherlock nuzzled into his neck. John pushed back into every thrust he made.  Sherlock’s nose was pushed into John’s neck and back and licked he a stripe over the warm skin. Even the rich, clean, masculine smell of the man intoxicated Sherlock. His own skin was hot and flushed and Sherlock could feel sweat begin to leave a sheen over both of their bodies.   They slid together.
“I just want to make sure,” Sherlock said eventually. He spread his fingers a little way inside John.
“Unless you’re still struggling with self-control, Sherlock, I need you to just fuck me,” John said.
water-based lube. One sec, let me give you a bottle.”  Simon disappeared behind the reception desk and appeared a moment later with several small, brown boxes.  “On the house.”
“Relax, love,” John tapped Sherlock’s clenched hand. “It’s no more than I had inside you last night.”
He stood on the edge, but his adrenalin won. Sherlock knew what he was going to do was out of character. But fuck it, he thought. It was that sort of day.
“I’ll have a team of operatives pick him up within the hour and return him to London. Just say the word.”
“I haven’t been entirely honest about my relationship with Roger,” John said in a halting voice. Mischief shone in his eyes and Sherlock smiled.
“I’m sorry too.” Sherlock dug his thumbs into John’s heels, which resulted in some downright filthy sounds that emanated from the tap end.  When Sherlock spoke again, his voice was notably huskier. “I don’t want to hurt you if my deduction is incorrect.”
John lifted the flesh-light. His dick was hard and drooled thin trails of precome down his shaft. John wiped the slick he still had on his hand over his penis, then pulled the flesh-light over the top. He jumped when it tightened around him and more lubricant oozed onto his cock.
“Do you know, I thought about this not so long ago,” Nathan replied.  “He’s really particular about his phone. I’d ask why. I’d love a poke around his phone.  And he’s got a Safe Deposit Box somewhere too. He doesn’t know I know that. I’ve seen the key. I found it once when he fell asleep on my couch.  I was putting his coat away and it fell out. It said Harris Safe Deposit on it, that’s the only reason I know what it was.  So, yeah, I’d ask to see his phone and to see what’s in that box.”
“I’m almost there.  Kiss me.” John turned his head to face Sherlock and lifted his hand from Sherlock’s arse to his hair.  Sherlock leant forward and gave him a searching kiss.  It changed the angle of his thrusts and John cried out against Sherlock’s mouth as his climax wracked his body.  Come splattered the inside of Sherlock’s arm and John’s arse gripped his cock.   Sherlock grasped John’s body to him, dragging him into his arms. This moment was one Sherlock had never expected to have and now his world narrowed to the short, ex-Army doctor plastered across his chest.
A MINOR WARNING: For rough sex between Fabian and Mark Tyler.  It's rough enough that John gets slightly concerned, but it's pretty tame stuff, really, and no one's hurt.  Personally speaking, pain makes me utterly furious and, as a result, I find it very hard to involve it in sex, even on the page.
Sherlock immediately relented.  “Okay, we’ll do that.” Sherlock sat back on the bed.   “John, you can have whatever you need. I promise.”
“Yes, yes.” John made a strangled sound of loss when Sherlock’s fingers finally slipped free of his body.
Sherlock’s cock hardened.  He sought control by concentrating on the men around the sex swing.  Murphy finger-fucked the stranger while he buggered Reid with shallow strokes.  Sherlock circled his finger inside John.  His actions were covered by John’s dressing gown, but he knew that John was enjoying what Sherlock was doing.
“I was thinking we might move on to an examination of the perineum?  Now, I’ll take your cock in my mouth to best gauge the responsiveness. Would that be acceptable?”
“Did you have to get him involved?” John asked as they attempted to hail a taxi.  “He’s a drama queen.”
“Let me,” John said. He sat up a little, pumped lube into his palm, and slathered it over Sherlock’s penis.
“When Rosie’s awake, she’s awake.  I’ve noted that she will wake up and wants to get up immediately.  Unless the flat is entirely quiet, or she has body contact with you or me, she normally stays awake until lunch.  She gets drowsy afterwards and will go to sleep for an hour or two before dinner. Then she’s awake until it’s time for bed.”
“Hey,” John said.  He didn’t touch Sherlock, he just started to talk with an even, kind voice. “Hey, love.  You’re having a nightmare.  You need to wake up now, honey.”  Sherlock turned in John’s direction. His eyes fluttered beneath the lids.  John continued to talk.  “Come on, come back to me.  You’re fine, you’re in bed at Baker Street.  You’re in bed with me and I love you, so much.”
There's also a reference to a Beyonce song in this.  That song is, of course, the very angry and brilliant 'Don't Hurt Yourself'.  If my John Watson ever cheats on Sherlock, this song is, in my mind, Sherlock's riposte. And John will be sleeping with one eye open and his hands protecting his 'nads for weeks. Anyway, I digress!
“I never said you were but being in love with someone of your own gender changes everything. That’s especially true when you’ve been in love with them for fucking years and never accepted it.”
“Right,” John said. “Give me your hand.” Sherlock lifted his hand, palm up and waited for John to dribble the slick liquid into his palm. John then tipped lube onto Sherlock’s crotch and into his own hand. He capped the bottle and threw it on the bed, then rolled on top of Sherlock.
“I do,” Sherlock agreed.  “But, as I said, I can’t guarantee it.  I believe that the story should now be told by Mr Tyler.  And I will do everything I can to make him tell you.”
John, unable to do anything, let go of his cock, so Sherlock reached out with his free hand and worked it with efficient strokes. The firm flesh throbbed in Sherlock’s fist, while he moved his other, curled inside John, with gentle, rocking motions. Sherlock could barely take his eyes from the vision of his hand inside John, but when he looked up, unnerved by John’s silence, he found an equally arresting sight. John’s mouth was open, his eyes locked on the ceiling, unfocused and lost in sensation.
“He hardly has a monopoly on heartbreak, brother dear.  Someone running away after taking your virginity is hardly a recommendation of your prowess.”
“Your guess is as good as mine,” Sherlock replied.  “But I think it would be useful if we perhaps spoke to Mr Reid?  You know him, don’t you?”
“I miss him already,” Simon replied, voice thick with emotion. “I don’t want to go ‘ome because he won’t be there.  How do I carry on, John?”
“Always,” Mark replied. “She was good to know.  She worked for me every now and then.  And I know you probably want to know more about Rosa. The truth is, I only know so much.  She didn’t have that sort of life.  There were always secrets, yeah?   No one really knew Rosa. I can’t say I did.”
“Why this way?” Sherlock asked. He only just had a grip of his control and if he concentrated on talking to John, he might distract himself from the sensation that threatened to overtake him.
“Surely this isn’t supposed to feel this good?” John’s voice was croaky. He pushed back against Sherlock with each thrust inward. “If I wasn’t so pleased, I’d be annoyed that you’re brilliant at this. God, God, I’m nearly there already.”
“John’s gone out, I’ve got Rosie, here are some scones.” She passed him an old, battered cake tin.  “Try to save some for John.”
“And I, you.”  John pushed up Sherlock’s t-shirt to expose his stomach and pressed his face against the revealed skin.   “You smell amazing,” he whispered. He dipped his tongue into Sherlock’s navel and
“You will not use toys on me without my express permission,” John continued. “Now, what are your thoughts on bonding?”
Lestrade’s jaw dropped. He took a pair of latex gloves from his desk drawer and removed the note. He unwrapped it. Sherlock dropped the pieces of the sex toy back into the evidence bag.  Sally resealed the bag.  Lestrade lay out the note on his desk.
When Sherlock and John arrived home, John thanked Mrs Hudson for babysitting Rosie and went straight to bed. Sherlock stood in the living room and thought about the conversation with Piero.   He knew he should think about the case, but an army doctor had crawled into his head and refused to move.
“I only went once.” John started to button his shirt.  “I went with a mate. We ended up just getting off with each other. I learned nothing.”
“I’m not sure how much movement I have,” Sherlock replied. He pulled back as far as his knot would allow and then thrust in.
“Fuck, look, I think he does,” Lestrade replied.  “Read the damn post and then let me know if you need me, yeah?”
John stood in front of Sherlock, a sleepy smile on his face.  Sherlock watched him and smiled back.   They were standing in the darkened room, grinning at each other, when the door swung open.
Without doubt, Sherlock felt wounded. His Omega was supposed to be desperate for him, not ordering him around and forcing trivialities like eating upon him. However, he also knew that John Watson was a force of nature and, like all such forces, he was uncontrollable by man, small child, or woman. Sherlock sat down and picked up his toast. His wet skin slid around on the wooden chair.
Sherlock released an exhale he didn’t know he’d been holding in little bursts. Then he stopped breathing entirely. After several gasping moments, John dove towards him and landed between his knees.
“Always, brother dear,” Mycroft replied as he walked in.  “We’ll secure Mrs Shaw and these premises.  Lestrade awaits your arrival.”
“Hello gorgeous one,” Molly said, as Sherlock, John and Rosie arrived.  She walked straight up to Sherlock and took Rosie from his arms.  “You’re just the best thing I’ve seen all week aren’t you beautiful?”
Sherlock’s forehead creased into a frown and each inhale was ragged with arousal.  His gaze met John’s and his fingers dug into his biceps. When Sherlock finally came, it was with an unstructured yell and a look of complete surrender. He shuddered until John managed to turn off the massager and then he flopped lifeless on the bed.  Both of their stomachs were wet with spunk, lube and sweat.  The air was heavy with the warm, sharp-sweet smell of sex.
Sherlock rubbed his face.  He was still trying, in vain, not to think about John when his mobile rang.
John undid his dressing gown and threw his leg over Sherlock’s lap.  He pulled Sherlock’s gown open and nuzzled his neck.  “Everything’s fine.” John voice was scarcely audible.  “Just a little confusion.  We’re all good.”
“Just one thing,” Murphy said. “That TV bloke tried to fuck me in the toilets one day. He gave me this stuff to take and I flushed it down the bog. I was about to leave and he pushed me back into a stall and tried to undo my trousers. I told him to fuck right off.  I meant to report it but Charles wasn’t in, then all the shit kicked off so I didn’t bother.”
“Leave it there!” John smacked Sherlock’s hand away. The sound of heavy boots on stairs hammered through the old walls and up into 221B.  John immediately restrained Sherlock, who was attempting to get up off the floor, hampered by his trouser bondage. “You’ve hurt your nose, and now your head, and stop sodding moving! I’m warning you, I will put you in a headlock if you don’t stop wriggling.”
Sherlock led them in the direction of Donovan, but before they reached her Fabian ran over and threw his arms around John’s neck.
When I wrote this, it was the first sex scene I'd written for eight or nine years, so please be kind.  I should also say that I hope no one feels that John's wibble isn't emasculating him; new relationships are hard on newly single parents. Season four showed John struggling with guilt and putting high expectations on himself and so I've worked with that. It's something I've noticed in the relationships I've had with people who are also parents, so it felt right to include it.
John’s complexion turned a little bit green. “Why did I fall for a man whose family has no sense of boundaries? Not that you do either. I expect your brother will send the footage to your mother and father. Or maybe some stills for the family album.”
There was an air around Mark Tyler.  He was an unexceptional man.  The vintage Rolex was gone. He wore a grey, prison issue tracksuit. His thinning dark hair and his somewhat rotund stomach seemed lessened.  His skin was pitted, a result, Sherlock thought, of teenage acne. His skin looked grey. Despite his careful treatment, given his background in Europol, Tyler was a worried man. Somehow, though, he still had charisma.
“Mr Langridge,” Sherlock said.  “Do you happen to ask the people who work here for lists of allergies?”
Sherlock’s death had broken John.  He wasn’t proud of the fact that Sherlock’s loss had hit him harder and deeper than anyone before.  Sherlock had given John the life he needed, the life he thought he was incapable of after he lost his life in the forces.  As a medical man, John had helped his men, had even helped sick relatives.  To not be able to stop the suicide of his best friend had been simply and utterly tragic. Sherlock’s death had been so wrong, so unexpected, so ridiculous, that it plunged John into a morass from which he’d thought he would never emerge.
Zach had been an accident. A night of pleasure that just went wrong. Jason had been a mistake. He’d been too heavy-handed.  However, Daniels regarded Cox as a bad man. It had surely been kill-or-be-killed.  Mycroft would understand.  That was his job, wasn’t it?  To clean up the messes the great and the good made, to manage the country in their stead and take none of the credit. Mycroft would be on his side.
“John, how distinctly mediocre it is to see you,” Mycroft said.  “I was just on my way to see Sherlock and thought I would offer you a lift as we were passing.”
“We take in all the money and take a percentage of the fee for the room hire.  I understand that many of the workers charge more, or less, money, depending on how much their company is valued.”
WARNING: There is a moment in this chapter where Sherlock observes what is happening and becomes concerned about whether someone he's watching having sex is feeling discomfort.  It's a short-lived moment and it all turns out okay.  There isn't really any detail, however, if you want to skip that moment, the worst of it's in a paragraph that starts with the speech: "Fu-uck."  It's referenced (getting better) a few paras later.  I have to say, I'm a wuss with sex nasty, so it's really not that bad.
“Yes, it does, but I don’t want to be an experiment, Sherlock, I want you to do this because you care for me.”
Charles nodded.  “I agree.  We installed the security room several months ago, after there was an incident up there.  It started in the WAM room; a custard pie fight became rather bad tempered and two of the men started to run the place. It took us three days of cleaning and over a thousand pounds to repair the damage. After that, well, we installed the cameras. I’ll be honest, we only use the cameras at weekends when the club is busier.”
Jacob wheeled them to the lift. Everyone was silent for the minute it took to travel down two floors. When the doors opened, all traces of hospital were gone. Jacob wheeled the bed over wooden floors which mirrored wooden panelling on the walls. The lounge doors were cushioned burgundy leather, and the stark strip lighting made way for wall lights that emitted a dimmer glow. Jacob came to a stop outside one of the red doors.
In terms of Omega heat, John had relied on his chemical safety blanket to hide him from its rigours. In fact, John’s first heat had taken place after he was sent home injured, and his rehab centre allocated him a therapeutic Alpha: a man who’d looked politely bored but had a nice, hard, thick cock.
“I don’t know what you mean,” John replied. His hand stroked idly through the mess on his stomach.  “I’m incredibly sweet and innocent.”  Come dripped from his index finger as he lifted it to his mouth and licked the tip.
“Have I killed your power of speech?” John asked.  Sherlock nodded.  John raised his hand and suddenly there was more wine and John smiled and smiled.  He took Sherlock’s hand, slid the ring onto his finger, turned the hand over and kissed his palm.   “Are you okay?”
“Erm.” The woman floundered.  She looked at Mycroft and raised her eyebrows.  “I think, maybe, that, well, er, Mycroyd?”
“Can you help me out?” Sherlock asked. He had just one eye open, the other was hidden behind a bubbly eye-patch.
Sherlock’s knot formed so fast it almost made him dizzy. He huffed out heavy breaths with each rock of his hips, confined as they were by his knot that locked him into John. Sherlock heard wild, shapeless noises when he came, noises he suspected were his own. Involuntarily, his spine arched inward, his hands on the bed, arms locked, and body stretched, inverted. Sherlock’s cock pumped load after load of release deep into John’s body.  He shuddered, taut, for a moment, until his arms buckled, and John wrapped his arms around him.
Sherlock sat up.   “I need to see,” he said. He moved to the side, so he could see John’s fingers disappear between his arse cheeks.  “I fantasised about you preparing yourself for me.”  He watched John’s capable fingers push inside his hole and his expression go slack.  “It didn’t do you justice.”
“Hold your horses.”  Tyler pulled his fingers free of Fabian, who whimpered at the loss.  He slicked himself up and slid inside Fabian’s arse.  He took a few slow, steady thrusts.
“Did you know you can have prostate orgasms without the penis being involved?” Nathan asked. He leaned forward towards John.  “I love them. I can just lie with my vibrator right up there and just hit it over and over. No semen, no coming, just these waves of pleasure. I call them arsegasms.”
“You’re an Omega on the first day of your heat,” Sherlock replied. “Naturally you couldn’t wait. You’re a man, John, not a God.”
John let Sherlock position him and almost sobbed with relief when Sherlock’s half-hard cock slid inside. If earlier was sheer, rabid desperation, for Sherlock this was pure love. He draped his body over John’s and rocked inside, nudging John’s prostate, not jabbing it with hard thrusts.  His hands slipped around John’s feverish skin and caressed his cock with tender touches. John’s breathy gasps increased when Sherlock started to thrust in deeper. Sherlock kissed his shoulders and the back of his neck, then followed the contours of John’s bullet scar with his tongue.
Sherlock handed the black card over.  “Aaron Sommers.  Lovely name,” the receptionist said.  He pouted a little at Sherlock who winked back.   “You’ve got a lively one here, Colin.”
“Oh, fucking hell, Sherlock that feels amazing.” John spread his legs to give Sherlock easier access. “And yes, you are sodding lucky, you wanker.”
“Me too, me too.” Sherlock’s knot was rapidly thickening again and stopping him from thrusting as he had before. He rocked against John, each breath a whimper.
“No,” John said. “You deflected earlier. You’re asking this question properly.” He crossed his arms and nodded in a manner that suggested that Sherlock should just bloody get on with it.
Shirley Patterson was a small, dark haired woman.  In John’s mind, she looked like a mole, all myopic behind thick glasses.  Her demeanour was friendly and delighted that someone had an interested in her work.
Sherlock smiled.  He felt drawn into John’s gaze.  Later, he realised that his actions were a reflection of what John gave him.  At the time, he struggled to fit words to his thoughts at all.  Blindly, he reached for John, who sat back on the top of Sherlock’s thighs.  The movement pressed their cocks together.
“Because you’re a man,” Mary replied.  “Because you and Sherlock are idiots.  Because I jumped in front of a bullet meant for him. Because you were confused and conflicted and hurt.  I’m sorry for that, I really am.  I couldn’t let you lose him again though.”
His clothes now bagged, John dressed in clean clothes.   Sherlock turned to look around the room.   John hadn’t been in this room before, though it was one of the few he hadn’t.  The walls were covered in striped green and gold wallpaper. The ceiling was white and gilt, with thick plaster carved into flowers, leaves and swirls.  In the centre of the room was a large bed made up with deep red cotton sheets. On an ottoman was a dish full of condoms.  On a carved wooden chair upholstered in navy fabric, sat a purple prostate massager. It looked used.
Almost without warning, Sherlock came in a white blaze of searing pleasure. He reached out both hands to grasp the wall and stop his trembling thighs from failing. And John didn’t stop, he just took a step forward and his soft grunts became cries. His dick seemed so deep, so forceful, it made Sherlock’s body rock. And then there was the look, the open-eyed gasp as John came. His face drooped into blissful relaxation and he rested his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder while he got his breath back. A twitch of the hips pulled John’s cock free of Sherlock’s body, shortly followed by John’s fingers being pushed into Sherlock’s sopping hole.
Sherlock resisted the urge to point out how effective it’d be to stop the sort of drug drop they were investigating. Of course, he didn’t want Charles to know that right now.
Sherlock stood and swooped his coat around his shoulders. “I’m sure I really don’t know what you’re suggesting with that comment, Detective Inspector.”
“It’s been a bore as normal, Mycroft,” Sherlock shouted as he swept out of the room and out of the Diogenes.
“You absolute fucker.” John kicked his feet and splashed them both in the process.  “I do love you though.”
“As soon as my knot’s gone down, you turn onto your belly and I’ll push it in.” Sherlock shifted his legs, so John could roll easier.
John grinned, his eyes sparkled. “I looked around while you were asleep. I’ve got a list of things we can try.” Sherlock blushed. His sexual confidence wasn’t genuine, especially free of the rut, but he wanted to be. He removed his sheet and passed it wordlessly to John, who gave him a soft kiss and chuckled as he left the room.
“If you could put us in a room with Tyler and we could ask him anything, what would have us ask?” John said.  “I feel like he’s a bit of an enigma. What would you like to know?”
Tyler smirked.  “Europol have arrested him before. He always gets away with it. The issue we’ve got is to find the first port o’ call. We know Daniels didn’t take control of the drugs immediately; they come through a third party. If we can find that person, we might have a chance. The link then is complete from the Marquês in Portugal to Daniels in London.”
Indeed, for a week, John thought of nothing but how to ask Sherlock if he’d share his heat. And, for the first time in a long time, John started to feel happy. Aroused.
“Good morning,” Sherlock said.   “Breakfast is almost ready.  Rosie’s had some fruit and I thought she might have some scrambled egg and baked beans. What do you think?”
“A lot of the boys like different ones,” Simon said.  “Some are better than others for use with toys and that.  But, as a general rule, we always use Coco de Mer
John choked on his tea. The ‘bloody woman’ was Marianne, the previous receptionist.  She’d acted as though the brothel were the Ritz and she was the manager. Not even clients had liked her, despite her simpering at them.  The whole atmosphere changed when Simon and Jason took over reception. They may not have had Marianne’s class, but they put people at ease and that was essential when you were facilitating criminal activities.
“Don’t look at that one,” John said. He pulled the empty bag from Sherlock’s hands and tried to shove the thing back in.
Sherlock grumbled then thought about what John had said. Prep the bedroom meant John’s omega side wanted to make them a space, a love nest so to speak. Sherlock shouldn’t get in his way. He pulled himself to his feet. “I’ll do the kitchen. You sort out my room.”
“No, no.”  Simon shook his head. “There are hampers for sex toys in each room. We collect up the hampers at the end of the day. That way we make sure the right toys return to the right rooms.  We’ve got a steam cleaner and a dishwasher in the cellar for ‘em.  We don’t touch ‘em til everyone’s gone.  They’re not always, well, clean, if you get my meaning. So, you don’t walk around wi’ ‘em.”
“Evora,” Sherlock correct.  The woman smiled fatuously. Sherlock assumed she was important. Rosie sniffed and pulled a face.
Sherlock huffed with displeasure. He decided he hated bananas and was infuriated by how slowly tea lost its heat.
John looked up from his notebook.  He resisted the urge to look uncomfortable, to feel uncomfortable. He stretched his neck.  “£190.00 an hour.”
Sherlock did not verbally reply. He simply looked at his erection and at John’s, then raised an eyebrow.
“I think what Sherlock is getting at, Charles, is that when Jason and Simon got together, they stopped hiring rooms from you and ended up on your payroll. They no longer earned you money and started to cost you money.  Was that frustrating for you?”
John’s arm moved in a manner that suggested he was still rubbing his cock, so Sherlock continued to fuck him, as much as he could. Sherlock licked and suckled at John’s neck, salving the wound there.
John nodded.  “C’mon,” he said to Rosie and led her into the living room.  “You sit on the sofa and I’ll fetch you some juice.” He went to the kitchen with the shopping bags and brought Rosie a drink, then walked over to Sherlock.  He put the palm of his hand on Sherlock’s lower back.  “Tea?”
And, God, even though it hadn’t pleased him, John’s heat-ridden body had taken it. John’s consciousness had retreated behind his animal urges until, and only until, he felt the hard shove against his arse and he’d known it was the huge, red dildo.
Sherlock nodded.  “Thank you.  Just one more question.  Can you think of any reason why Brandon or Jason may have been murdered?”
Sherlock crumpled the letter and was about to throw the damn thing across the room when his phone rang. Lestrade.  It was Sunday; it was worth answering.
. His cock throbbed, and he surreptitiously rubbed it against the leather of Sherlock’s chair.   He quickened his movements; his jaw ached, his chin was covered in spit and he wanted to feel Sherlock come in his mouth.  John looked up. Sherlock’s legs twitched and his chest heaved. He met John’s gaze with heavy-lidded eyes.  His teeth dug into his bottom lip. He came with a gasp.
“And why on earth should I do that?” Mycroft asked.  Marion walked into the office and the conversation paused while she brought in refreshments.
Thank you to Lockedinjohnlock for proofing this chapter. There were probably more corrections to this chapter than many of the others combined. I was clearly very hard of thinking at this point!  Needless to say, remaining errors are mine.
Hands-on, it seemed, meant that John and Sherlock should be naked apart from their pants, and that it involved them touching with every comment they made.  Sherlock, under the guise of Aaron Sommers, had booked them in to see Piero Fibonacci, who specialised in couples’ sexual therapy.   According to Sherlock, this was the best possible way to get some insight into any role the staff of Doubles might have played in the murders at Langridge’s.
“Sounds right. He’s not answering when I call him,” Lestrade said.  “Anyway, I’ve been sent links to three different news websites that are talking about you both. It’s not really like John to post things like that.”
“Are you a famous actor or a politician or something?”  John couldn’t place the girl’s accent. He didn’t think she was from Surrey.
“A normal, everyday suit or a really good suit?”  Sherlock got to his feet and stood in front of John, who wore a charcoal grey suit.  He looked trim, fit, happy and ridiculously sexy.
“My brother sent us here, John,” Sherlock said. “I hate to give him credit for anything, but if he sent us here it’s the best and most reputable place for us to be. We’re probably less likely to be filmed here than we are at Baker Street.”
Then, yesterday, Lestrade told me that someone handed themselves in for it. A bloke called Pero or Piro or something.”
“I want you to lie behind me and get your dick in me right now.” John’s eyes were dark blue. He stroked himself while he waited for Sherlock to move behind him. Once Sherlock was in place, John pushed out his bum, lifted his right leg and pulled him in.
“Fine.” Sherlock wobbled to his legs. He found himself to be wearing pants and, for some reason, a pair of green fluffy socks. Sherlock weaved his way to the bathroom, had a wee, brushed his teeth, and then attempted to find the kitchen. There was an abundance of groceries on the table. Mrs Hudson had clearly stocked up in light of John’s heat. After Sherlock had dropped two tea bags in the toaster and struggled to shove slices of bread into mugs, John smacked his arse.
“I can tell you here and now, who knew about Brandon’s allergies,” Langridge said.  “We all did.  He even asked his clients if they used the stuff.  Even when he helped out Justin Ellis, our BDSM specialist, and he asked his clients too.  Brandon wasn’t shy about it.”
“Harsh,” Piero said.  “I just walk out for just a few hours. To pretend you are dead and sulk for two years?  That is next level.”
“I knew you were going to sodding deflect.” John grinned. “You know damned well that I fancied you from the minute we met.”
In all other respects, this is not the calm before the storm.  It's the storm before a bigger storm.
“That was nice,” Nathan said.  “You can use those hands as a shield or to steady each other if you’re nervous. If one of you freezes, the other can move your head with his hands.”
“There were moments.” Sherlock paused.  He didn’t want to go down that road.  He changed tack. “I’ve had sex.  Done things.  Even with a woman. It was dull.”
Sherlock called Billy Wiggins just to see if he could throw any light on the drug supplier. He said he’d ask around. With nothing else to do, Sherlock and John headed home.  To his continued annoyance, Sherlock had more questions than ever and most of them revolved around John.  He spent the taxi journey back to Baker Street thinking about John demanding to be fucked immediately.
The console of the chair beeped. “I-n-s-e-r-t—y-o-u-r—p-e-n-i-s—i-n-t-o—t-h-e—h-o-s-e—a-p-p-a-r-a-t-u-s.”
“Those experiments do help me solve crime.” Sherlock could feel himself deflate. They’d just bonded, and this was neither romantic nor sexy. “Those Petri dishes save lives, John.”
“Well, it’s going to be. You might end up with some extensive facial bruising, but there’s nothing broken. Your scans look fine. There’s no reason to think you have concussion. So, I want you both to have something more to eat and drink. Someone will be along in a few moments to take you down to one of our lounges. After that, if you wish to return home, we’ll arrange transportation. Otherwise, you can stay here for the remainder of your heat should you wish to. The benefit of staying is that we’ll make sure you’re fed and hydrated. But, of course, it’s entirely your choice.”
There were three men in the room, all of whom were so clearly policemen, the fact Sherlock had met them an hour or so earlier was irrelevant.
“We’ve got the ear-pieces and mics on already.” Sherlock’s voice echoed in the receiver.  Bailey stood and crowded in on Sherlock.
“Mr Holmes,” Dr Marshall said. “You look much better already.” She walked over to check Sherlock’s drip stand. “And you’re certainly far more hydrated. How do you feel?”
“Come for me, John,” Sherlock stroked John’s cock firmer. Faster. “I want to feel you come undone. I’m so desperately, utterly yours, John Watson.”
Sherlock upended the bag. John’s stomach made an unpleasant lurch when a thick, enormous red dildo fell out of the bag and rolled towards him.
“Of course not, John.” Sherlock fiddled with his phone.  “Drake plays cricket. You can tell by how misshapen his fingers are.”  He paused for a moment.  “Ah, Mycroft,” Sherlock said into his phone as he walked through into the kitchen.
“Oh, that’s good.”  John sighed.  Sherlock’s hand was around his cock, bringing it to full hardness with long, lazy strokes.   John wriggled his hand between them to reach Sherlock, but found himself rolled onto his back.  Sherlock kissed him with warm, dry lips. He opened his mouth and sucked John’s tongue.  John heard Sherlock rifle through the bedside table for a moment before the teasing movements over his erection began again.
“I don’t know when it changed,” Fabian said.  “I learned Candlar did very bad things.  I knew it when Brandon owed us money.  But I don’t think Kevin is in charge. And Candlar is not brave enough to kill, Jean.  I know it. He’s a druggie and he is an arsehole, but he’s not a killer.  I think it is Tyler who kills, yes?”
“Sherlock, Mrs Hudson isn’t here.  She doesn’t save cake for me. She knows I love her cream horns.  Oh, grow up, John! You are
Sherlock was making his violin squeal with anguish when John returned from the supermarket with Rosie.  They’d woken relatively early and John had nipped to the shops so that they could be back to see Mark Tyler before they prepared for the drugs sting that night.
“It is,” Sherlock said.  “That’s all that matters.  If you tell me what you want, I will try to do it. Always.”
John pulled the sheet draped over the chair until the thing was revealed.  In the seat was a hole and beneath that was black, shiny dildo. On the front of the chair was a control unit and, hung over the top, a long hose with a flesh-light at the end. John blushed, and, to his dismay, slick began to ooze from between his arse cheeks. He looked at his watch. They’d last had sex just over an hour ago. John had never experienced a heat where he’d felt so desperate, so aroused. He felt like a prisoner to the needs of his body and yet, he didn’t really care. All he wanted was sex. Sex with Sherlock. Sherlock, who he’d already fucked into hospital.
“So, I’ve been thinking about what I can do to manage my heat,” John said. Sherlock took a subtle inhale; John’s heat was three or so weeks away yet.
“Get out of the way,” John ordered. “I’ll do it.” Before Sherlock could react, John had fished the teabags out of the toaster and rinsed the crumbs from their mugs.
Sherlock spread John’s buttocks a little, grasped his cock, lined it up and pushed slowly inside the tight heat of John’s body.  He panted with the effort required to move gently and smoothly. Sherlock pushed in a little more. “Okay?  Am I hurting you?” he whispered.
Sherlock did not reply in words. He simply walked towards John, reached out, took his arm and led him into his bedroom. They made it as far as the mirror before John stopped.
“We could do more, I suppose.  I do wonder about whether we should start Aaron with something like different size plugs, or Kegel balls?”
“His name was Bertie,” Sherlock said. His brain had decided, now it’d thought about Bertie, to talk about him too. Still, if not coming immediately was the issue John thought it was, maybe the odd thought about Bertie Stibbons might help. “He was a snobbish, arrogant moron who had the most fantastic cock.”
“Must be coming on for a year now,” Charles replied. “Some of the senior members are asking us to make locker usage compulsory now. I can see why,” he admitted. “It’s sad to think that we need them.”
Langridge’s was the same as ever.  As John stood in the ground floor lobby, looking up at the floors of rooms above, he heard various moans, cries and laughs.  The bricks seemed to be infused with sex and decadence.  Simon ran downstairs from the first floor and rushed over to John, Sherlock and Lestrade.  His eyes glistened with barely dammed tears as he threw his arms around John.
“Please, John,” Sherlock said. He looked up without a clue of how well he hid the roil of emotions and thoughts he felt. There was the slightest nod and John’s hand in his hair turned from a grasp to a caress. Sherlock tugged John’s twitching cock through the gap in his pants.
“You do have a theory about all this, don’t you?”  John took the photos from Sherlock and shoved everything back in the box.
“Lube?” John asked.  Sherlock scrabbled for the bottle and pressed it into his hand.  John drizzled the cool liquid on their cocks and wrapped his hand around them, stroking them together several times.  The sensation of their softest, most intimate skin against each other was wonderful.  Sherlock curled at the waist and pulled John into a breathless kiss. When their lips parted, John whispered, “Relax.” He pushed Sherlock back down on the bed and rubbed his balls, perineum and then his backside against Sherlock’s cock.
“I’ve left you and Rosie enough money that you’re on a par with Sherlock financially,” Mary continued.  “That means you haven’t got to feel like you’re the poor relation.  So, look after him, John. I know he’s the best chance you and Rosie have of real happiness, so don’t mess it up.”  Mary smiled.  “He’s loved you selflessly for so long.  He doesn’t know it. He thinks he’s a brain on a stick and no one gives a toss about him apart from when he’s useful.  He learned that from the outside world. You and I had shitty parents and we learned only bad things from them. And both of us went to the military and they taught us. The army brought us up.  Sherlock didn’t have that chance. He had addiction, a snotty older brother and a lot of dead bodies.”
“I’m coming with you, Sherlock. Fabian, stay here.”  John pulled his hand away from Fabian, straightened his collar and followed Sherlock and Donovan through the lobby and out to a doorway on the left.  They found themselves in a large room.  Sherlock guessed that it may have been a lounge in the days when Langridge’s was a more conventional gentleman’s club. Prior to that, it had probably been a ballroom.  Langridge had split the large space into three distinct areas.  They walked through the first part, where curved couches had been arranged around tables to form private booths.   It reminded Sherlock of a bar or even a restaurant with cool, blue lighting.
John followed Sherlock to the kitchen and pulled out a packet of chocolate digestives.  It was going to be an interesting day.
“My colleague and partner, Dr John Watson is presently undergoing emergency surgery at St Mary’s Hospital,” Sherlock said. “This is his daughter, Rosie. Doctor Watson was in the RAMC and served in Afghanistan. He works for the NHS and is an everyday hero and a wonderful father.  It is his intent that I am his next of kin and that I am legal guardian of Rosie along with him.  We need this to be arranged as a matter of extreme urgency.”
“You go with Fabby?”  Piero asked.  “I love Fabby. He’s always telling me to quit here and go to Langridge’s. However, I like that I work with normal people, you know?”
“John,” Sherlock moaned on an inhale.  The kiss seemed more intimate than anything they had done so far.  His cock thickened and he arched his body up to find friction. In the end, he simply grabbed John’s hand and drew it down to his crotch.  “More.”
“Fine.  We’ll see you up there.” Lestrade shook John’s hand and then Sherlock’s.  “Break a leg and all that.”
John shook his head. “Enough, Sherlock.  I told you last night that I fell in love with you as you are.  The fact we’re having sex doesn’t change that. Rosie’s used to your temper. This is your home.  And we,” John said and gestured to himself and then Sherlock, “will fail unless you stop trying to be perfect.”
Sherlock’s mouth twitched at the memory.  John had mentioned Sherlock’s floofy hair earlier that morning when they’d showered together.  “Maybe we ought to try a few on?”
“They’re password protected and kept on the hard drive in the security room. Only I have access to them and I only review them if there’s an incident. The recordings are overwritten every four weeks.”
“We’re going to start Mr Holmes on saline with some glucose to maintain his blood sugar and hydrate him. The results of his scans will be expedited, but that chair is yours if you need it.” She pointed to a chair in the corner of the room. There was a blanket draped over the seat and what looked like a vacuum cleaner in front of it. John looked at the chair and then at the nurse. She laughed. “It’s really not as bad as it looks. I promise.” She walked towards the door. “I’ll be back in a minute with a drink and sandwich for you. Mr Holmes should be back very soon too. Just so you know.”
“Was there, y’know, anything that happened?”  John picked up the bedspread and threw it over the bed.
Sherlock looked up. John was rumpled, naked, cheeky-looking, and very, very beautiful. He smiled. John stuck out his tongue. From the floor, John’s phone rang.
“Good, as I expected.  In that case, Rosie, the fry-up is on!” Rosie squealed with delight.  She probably didn’t understand the concept of a fry-up, but she responded to his joy.  “You sit here, John.” Sherlock led him to a seat.  “I’ll bring breakfast over in a moment.”
Sherlock, John and Rosie were in the car and heading back to Baker Street when Molly texted.  Sherlock rerouted the car to Bart’s.
“Good afternoon,” Mycroft replied.  “I hate to inform you of this, Sherlock, but the British government isn’t required to run its decisions past you.”
“I didn’t even know that was possible,” John said when he’d got his breath back. “You’re a fucking wonder, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Want to help?”  John asked. He rocked back against his fingers.  “I love this, you know,” he said.  “And you’ve got the most lovely, long fingers.”
Sherlock had planned a gentle, slow night of sensuous pleasure.  John had other ideas.  He writhed against him, fucking himself until Sherlock’s body reacted.   Each rolling thrust began carefully, but ended with a sharp jab of his hips, his cock plunging inside.
“You are my love,” John said. He tilted his head back and clumsily kissed the bridge of Sherlock’s nose. “And I do love you.”
“Well that’s good. But here’s the thing, if I was going to come to you and say, ‘Hey, Sherlock, let’s make love’ and all of that, then I needed to be able to show you how to do those things. I know how to live with you and to love you because you’re my friend.  I just didn’t know how to make love to you. I always knew that was my job. If we do bedroom things, I need to take care of you.”
“Been a long three days.” John looked up. “I reckon you’ve seen me at my best and worst and everything in between.”
John was stood in the hallway, outside of Sherlock’s bedroom. He was, evidently, a man lost in shock. They’d just got home from the swimming pool. Somehow, despite John having been wrapped in explosives, they were still alive. Sherlock was sure he wasn’t the only one who couldn’t quite believe their luck.
John’s eyes fluttered as Sherlock drove in again and again. His legs flailed against Sherlock’s body with each precise thrust and he couldn’t bring himself to care. He did, however, weasel his hand between their increasingly sweaty bodies to wrap his fingers around his own throbbing prick. After just a few strokes, the precipitous tingle of John’s building release made him arch his body up towards Sherlock.
For a few, long, comfortable moments, they just ate. And, when breakfast was done, they got up and out of the bath. John wheeled the trolley out while Sherlock brushed his teeth. And still, not a word was spoken.
John and Sherlock walked into the back room.  A man wrapped in a blanket waited, seated at a chipped table on an uncomfortable-looking chair. He turned and acknowledged them.  Immediately, Sherlock noted that he wore a vintage Rolex watch.  He had manicured fingernails and a tattooed wedding band on his left hand.    Sherlock also noted that the man recognised them. It happened, of course, but this man was very interested in John in particular.
Mary, the real Mary, had realised almost immediately. Her voice as she’d said, “John?” confirmed it. She’d trailed behind him, plunged into forlorn horror.
“Oh, John.” Sherlock thrust again, then again, shallower, faster.  John’s hand reached back and grabbed Sherlock’s hip and pulled him in, deeper until it reached the heart of them both.  Sherlock came with an intensity that buckled and surprised him.  For a while, all he knew was searing pleasure that seemed to radiate outwards and made his mind and limbs feel warm and liquid.
When John pulled Sherlock into the room, he did so walking backwards, their lips connected and their hands tugging at clothing.  It wasn’t entirely surprising then, that John bashed his heel against one of the legs of the bed.
“You know as well as I do, John, everyone loved Jase. He were the other lads’ kid brother. Charles treated him like a son.  The clients liked him. No one could stay angry wi’ ‘im. I used to make ‘im deal with the blokes whose cards got declined ‘cause I knew they wouldn’t be arseholes to Jase.”
“I know that Brandon wasn’t seeing anyone who wasn’t a regular client unless someone else vouched for them.  When I saw him, he was a bit nervy, like. But hookers are like actors, aren’t they?  There was a punter who was being a right tosser. He was a right posh bastard.”
“How could I have known?” John pushed a few stray curls behind Sherlock’s ear. “How on earth could I have understood?”
“Tired.” John nestled his head against Sherlock’s shoulder and closed his eyes. In seconds, his breaths had evened into little huffy snores. Sherlock pushed up his hips experimentally. “Sore.” John moaned. “No more.”
John Watson liked to think of himself as a pragmatic, capable man. He was widow. He was a father. He was an Omega. And, since his wife’s death, and no matter how stressful being a single father was, he worried about his daughter not having a sibling.
“No time,” John replied. “Please.” He lowered his weight from his hands to his elbows and pushed his arse into the air. Sherlock didn’t need asking twice. He slipped behind John, dropped to his knees, lined up his cock, and slid inside.
“I’m telling you that it’s time for you and me to decide what we want from our relationship.” John took a massive exhale as if he’d let all the air out of his body in one deep breath.
Lestrade sat behind his desk and put his head in his hands.   “We’ve got one shot at this,” he said.  “We can’t pretend we don’t know what’s being delivered again.  If there’s a sniff that this is going to be a drug delivery, then I’m in deep and complete shit.  So, what am I going to tell the boys upstairs?”
“Not that,” John had mumbled. Mary probably hadn’t heard. His conscious mind struggled in the heat fog, the same fog that had taken hold of his body as it tried to accept the painful intrusion. John had screamed in pain.
Sherlock shook his head.  John Watson seemed determined to upend his life.  Biscuits in bed?  Was nothing sacred?
“We’ve lived together on and off for years, John,” Sherlock replied. “You’re my best friend. We’re compatible.
John grinned. “Then hold on tight.”  He leant back and bounced against Sherlock’s pelvis. John cried out when Sherlock stroked him with firm, fast strokes.  “Yes, yes.  Want you to come in me.”
John put down his fork. He looked at his plate. If his voice was thick when he said, “Thank you,” Sherlock was willing to let it go. Just this once.
“The thing is, John, if you’ve got this disc then somehow you’ve met my brother. My guess would be that it’s a case, but it could be that Sherlock’s got himself mixed up with prostitutes or drugs.”  John felt himself blush.  “See I think you two should be together, but I also think Sherlock will struggle with it. Remember that he saved you?  Please, John, save Sherlock right back.  He’ll be a great husband for you and wonderful father for Rosie. But you need to convince him of that, John. He doesn’t know.  He’s outside the realms of his experience.  He doesn’t know he’s worth you two being together and he won’t until you convince him.  Personally, I think you should marry him and get him to adopt Rosie, but you know Sherlock best.”  Mary raised an eyebrow in a way that suggested she knew Sherlock incredibly well.
“Died when I was twelve. Rosamund was fifteen. She got her own flat, finished school and she joined the army.  I was fucked,” Tyler admitted.  “No one wants to adopt a twelve-year-old kid who’s being an arsehole because he’s grieving. I was arrested for the first time when I was twelve. I didn’t even manage a year before everything fell apart. I went to twenty-seven foster homes or residential units before I was sixteen.  And I was already part of the criminal underworld.”
“I helped design the system myself,” she said in a soft and lilting Scottish accent.  She explained that the software issued an invoice as soon as the customer’s name and needs were entered.   “It means that Simon and dear Jason, God rest his soul, would simply give the customer their invoice and receipt immediately.  A lot of our clients don’t want the paperwork, but we keep their copies if they don’t take them. I run a tight ship, Mr Holmes.”
John stood outside 221 Baker Street and paced.  He was tired and fed up of the bloody Holmes’.  They didn’t mean to be so callous; John had accepted it as a side-effect of genius years ago.   There was no malice meant and, generally, John ignored them.  But John Watson knew what Simon felt, because John Watson knew grief.
“Well, you’ve already told me that you don’t always like anal,” John said quietly.  “Why don’t we just use that as a reason?”
Sherlock waited for Mycroft.  John was in surgery at St Mary’s Hospital and would then be transferred, courtesy of Mycroft, to the private Lindo Wing next door for recovery.  When he mentioned his status as John’s next of kin and as Rosie’s guardian, Mycroft simply told him to wait.
“No, you don’t. You love me, and you’ll love me even more when you wake up tomorrow not stuck to the sheets.”
The next few minutes seemed to pass by so quickly.  John continued CPR until the paramedics were unloaded and ready.  The lead paramedic gave John the look but they still collared and immobilised Jason all the same.   They bundled him into an ambulance along with crying, crying Simon.  And then John leaned back on his haunches, pulled his knees out of the puddle of blood, and he stood.
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock agreed. He opened the kitchen door and ushered John through.  “Let’s find Matthews.
“Somewhere in Belgium and Portugal, I think,” Nathan replied.  “Les never goes with him.  Me either, come to think of it. It used to annoy me. I wouldn’t mind a little holiday to Portugal.  I’m not so bothered about visiting Belgium. Unless there’s chocolate.”
“Oh!” John seated himself fully on both chair and dildo. Sherlock, who was lying in his bed, absently rubbed his crotch through the sheets.
“Because I was brilliant at keeping your wife alive, wasn’t I?” Sherlock responded.  He stared across the room at the smiley face shot into the wall.  “You have too much faith in me.”
“Okay,” Nathan said with a smirk. “When I was younger, going up the Heath was just what you did.  I learned quick what a long look meant, a touch or a double tap on the arm.  But one of the rules of cruising was that if you’re noisy, you’re telling other people that you want ‘em to watch or take part, yeah?  So, my suggestion is to stay pretty quiet.”
“I don’t wear clothes like this, Sherlock,” John said.  He stood in the living room and ruffled his hair.  “I wore combat trousers in combat, not for poncing around in Soho.”
“Well, what if you buggered off to do a recce on a transvestite club one evening without telling me and, as a result, I said, no, Sherlock my darling, I don’t want your penis up my arse tonight, thanks very much.”
“How can I help the intrepid duo today?” He clasped his hands and put them on the desk in front of him.  “Or, I should say, refuse to help?”
Sherlock pulled his sticky body away from John’s and struggled to a stand on rubbery legs. “I need a shower and a drink and then, Dr Watson, I need to think about…”
Sherlock lifted John’s hips a little. Sherlock lined himself up and slowly, millimetre by millimetre eased himself inside John’s body.
“My apologies, Dr Watson, for my insensitivity,” Mycroft said.  “I’ll leave you now.  Please, return to Sherlock, he regrets what he said.”
“Bedroom,” John agreed. Sherlock led the way. “Clothes off,” John added when they were beside the bed.
“You’re not a practising addict, Sherlock.  Harriet Watson used mouthwash two weeks ago when she had gastroenteritis.”
“I know, I know,” Mark said.  “She sent dozens of the fuckers.  What the hell was that about?”  John shrugged, but took the disc.  “Oh, and there’s this.”  Mark handed over the thick wodge of cash that Sherlock and John had seen in Tyler’s safe deposit box.   John took the money and stared at it.  “It was Rosamund’s cash. I looked after it for her.  It’s yours now. Yours and your daughter’s.  Rosa never wanted there to be a will for this lot; she never wanted anyone asking questions about how she earned it.”
The next thing out of the box was a mobile phone.  The battery would be long dead but since the box that contained the phone was still shrink wrapped, it was clearly unused.  John threw it on the desk.
“The hospital will call when he’s out of surgery,” Mycroft replied. “They’re quite relaxed with you being his next of kin. Apparently, John kept repeating it over and over until he was anaesthetised.  They got the message. Still, it doesn’t hurt to make things official. And, we will have to ensure you retain care of Rosie.  I can’t see anyone challenging it, but let’s make sure, hmm?”
One more thing, Sherlock's reticence with regards his bum isn't necessarily going where you think it is. I'm writing the follow up to this fic, and there's no traumatic rape scene or anything. So, if you're worried, chill babes.
Sherlock humphed with pretend displeasure. The truth was, his groin was already itchy after its unconventional shower. Sherlock scrambled to a stand on the slippery porcelain and squeaked when the first splashes of cold water hit his skin.
“Hey, hey,” John said. “I don’t think that way. I’m with you now. People make too much of the whole penetration thing. If all you and me ever did was frottage, hand-jobs and blowjobs, I would be perfectly happy because I’m with you. I’d be happy to be with you if we never had sex. I’ve still got my left hand, mate.”
“Which is where Daniels has been hiding. His grandmother lives in Lisbon.  I’ll get in touch with the Portuguese authorities, see if they have any intel.  I may have leverage if I offer help with the Marquês.”
John reached between their bodies and grasped the two fake cocks.  “Feel good?” he said at normal volume. It reminded Sherlock that he had to act too, and he moaned his assent.
John turned onto his belly. Sherlock wriggled down the bed and pulled John’s bum cheeks apart.  John’s hole was still stretched and their mixed come and lube trickled free.  When John bore down, a firm ooze of the stuff came out.  Sherlock caught the substance in his hand.  He smelled it and rubbed it between his fingers.  He knew the back passage absorbed liquid and enjoyed, for a moment, the notion that his and John’s DNA had merged at least a little.
“Now, I understand. He should be on his way from Portsmouth now.” Mycroft took his phone from his pocket and read a text.  “Hmmm, we may have a problem.”
. “My last boyfriend, Peter, used to fuck himself with a dildo to get ready. He had three in different sizes. He used to make me watch. It was like torture.
“Kevin Candlar.  They met at university. They were once lovers both of each other and of drugs.  We know that their sexual relationship was kept quiet and that they don’t speak of it publicly to maintain Daniels’ secrecy over his sexual predilections.   We also know that Candlar was present during an episode in which Daniels overdosed after speedballing.  I know because my office kept the press unaware of the story.”
“Jean, I am so happy to see you,” Bouchard buried his face against John’s neck.  “I am so scared, Jean. Who will be next?  Can you protect me?”  Sherlock watched and scowled.
When Sherlock entered 221B Baker Street that evening, music was playing.  He turned to John who’d walked upstairs behind him and quietly shut the door.
“Just let her calm down again.  If we don’t go up she’ll quieten down.”  John put his hands behind his back and waited. Sherlock took a single, cynical nod and crossed his arms.
“Is that good?” Sherlock asked. Many Alphas did tend to be more aggressive, arrogant, and dominant than the general population. While Sherlock could be all of those things, it wasn’t done with sexual predatory machismo.
Daniels screamed. He found Mycroft’s number and video-called him.  Mycroft was quick to answer. Daniels threw himself into the seat next to the agent.   “If you’ve got no one on this train, you lying bastard, who the fuck is this?” He tilted the phone to bring the agent into view.
“With your gracious consent, I’ll take care of it,” Mycroft replied.  He withdrew a sheaf of papers from his pocket.  “I just need your signatures here and here.”  The woman squinted at the papers but signed them anyway.
Mycroft closed his eyes.  “Alright, I admit that I know that man,” he said.  “I didn’t send him to spy on you.  Ask him yourself.”
Sherlock frantically chewed the last bite of banana and resolved to drink his tea whether it burned his tongue or not. He paused at John’s cry and looked up to see him shoot semen across the kitchen floor.
“Thank you.” John took Sherlock’s hand and the connection somehow made it all a bit better. The tempo of the machine picked up and the sleeve around John’s penis started move up and down his shaft.
Sherlock walked in with Rosie.  “It’s a question I frequently have when I talk to my brother,” he said.  “Why are you saying it?”
“More,” Sherlock demanded. John fucked himself on Sherlock’s dick with shallow, rolling thrusts, and, as he did, he slipped a second finger inside of Sherlock. The stretch wasn’t entirely pleasant. “More lube.” John’s fingers left Sherlock’s arse to gather more slick from where their bodies met. Another stretch but one smoother and less uncomfortable. John rolled his hips and coordinated his movements, so he thrust his fingers in when Sherlock’s cock sank into John’s body.
Mycroft’s face showed annoyance but also understanding.  “We can’t make him comfortable with it overnight, John.”
“We’ve got secret weapons,” John said.  He lifted the bottom hem of his dressing gown and gave Lestrade a flash of his dildo.
John turned towards Sherlock, who was half hidden behind the door. “Hell of a day,” he said in croaky tones.
“Of course, Mygroin” the woman said.  “Make it happen.”  Mycroft passed her several more papers to sign.  “Lovely.  Now, Mr Holmlock, please have faith that Mychord here will arrange it all for you,” the woman said with look of relief.  “Now, I simply must go. I am trying to run the country, you know.”
As always, proofed by Lockedinjohnlock, who has worked hard to tell me why I should use 'lie' instead of 'lay'.  Remaining errors, chickens, and eggs, are my problem only.
“Except you can, John,” Sherlock replied. “I won’t take up anymore time of yours than I currently do. The only difference is that we sleep together. And what does it matter if I know her routine? She has you and me and Mrs Hudson and Molly and even Lestrade and Mycroft make allowances for her.  My parents have offered to look after her if we need them to next time they’re in town.”
“As great as that was, the raging bloody Omega in me wants your knot. So, you, Sherlock Holmes, need to do that.” John rolled onto his side. “Maybe you could lie behind me and just do it that way?”
“Mister Holmes, it has come to our attention that you and your colleague have played a crucial role in the arrest of the Marquês de Flora.”
“Fine,” Sherlock said.  John sat down next to him and Sherlock moved in for a kiss.  “We can do kissing, right?”
The third-floor landing was full of gawpers.  John took a quick glance over the balcony. Below, other people emerged from rooms looking puzzled and worried.   Down on the ground floor, in the lobby, Simon was leant over a naked man. A puddle of blood grew beneath him.
“I’m good thanks.”  Greg took a wide-line around the bed pit.  “What’s the matter with him?” he asked John under his breath.  John shrugged.   “The nutter just reminded me, Sherlock, I got the lab results back on the butt plug.”  Sherlock gave Lestrade his full attention.  “DNA belonged to Gabe Smith, Gabriel. He was with Stephen Daniels at the time of Jason’s death.  There was also Jason’s DNA on it. A lot of Jason’s DNA on it. Oh, and lime scale deposits. That could be from washing, or from any other contact with water.  There was chlorine though, which is odd.”
“Daniels had been a loose cannon for months. He liked to drug boys to have sex with them. Thomas was a mistake. He manipulated others to take the blame. He did it.”
John heard the street outside and the keystroke-sound of Sherlock texting.   “You can’t text an ambulance, you prick,” John yelled.
“Good.” John planted a hand on Sherlock’s bum to pull him closer.   “I wish I knew how to pay you a compliment without freaking you out.  I wish I knew what went on in that awesome brain of yours.”
Charles Langridge was seventy-eight years of age and almost as round as he was tall.   His teeth were stained and looked worn. He had a close-cropped beard and a thick sweep of grey hair atop his head.  His suit looked expensive and his shoes were polished and pristine. He wore a gold chain dangling from his waistcoat, presumably linked to a pocket watch.  He didn’t look nervous.  John wondered whether Mycroft had made a deal with Scotland Yard for Charles’ sake too.
“Don’t you dare do that yourself,” Sherlock said.  He took the lube from John and motioned for him to get onto the bed.   After crawling over, Sherlock kissed a line down John’s chest and groin.  He grasped John’s cock and licked a stripe down its length before sucking the head into his mouth.
John ordered a bottle of Hambledon Première Cuvée.  For dinner, they had black pudding and broad beans to begin, followed by wild garlic and sage chicken with boulangere potatoes and purple sprouting broccoli. Before their dessert of treacle sponge and custard could be delivered, John smoothed his tie, cleared his throat and took Sherlock’s hand.
The army had brought with it John’s first experience of dating an Alpha: James Sholto. Their relationship had been doomed to impermanence; a moment of love in a bleak, relentless desert amongst men who might die at any moment. When death and destruction were so close, a soldier focused on the moments of happiness and not on whether they would last back on civvy street. In the end, the rawness, the despair, caused by Sholto’s fall from grace and John’s injury had been simply too destructive for their love to last, especially when that love was as fragile as a rose blistering in desert fire.
“You still love me?” Sherlock’s dick stopped softening and gave a pleasurable twitch. “Even when we’re not mid-coitus?”
Sherlock took a deep breath and was about to talk when John took over.  “Aaron and I have been together for a while. We took Piero’s advice on getting our relationship back on track emotionally and sexually, to some extent.  Even though I don’t think it’s a problem, Aaron is worried that he doesn’t always like to have anal sex.  I think he’s concerned that he’s disappointing me. He isn’t, but it worries him.”
“The shirt covered in your spunk is upstairs. It’ll do.” Ian had finished his tea and turned around. “You should at least try. If not, then I’ll be John for you any time you need. You know where to find me.”
Sherlock eased in as far as he could.  John rolled back and Sherlock leant with him, which gave him increased access to John’s body.  When Sherlock shuffled down the bed a little, the new angle pushed his cock in a little further. “Give me a minute.” He gasped. “It feels amazing. I want to just lose control and fuck you hard, but I want this to be good for you.”
Lesley tugged at her pearls. Sherlock knew they were fake. It was all fake. She didn’t have the posh accent she put on. She played a part because a rich man in another country blackmailed her.  She’d taken a wrong path and that led her to this point.
Sherlock replied with another kiss. The touch of lips was tender and soft; a dozen little kisses peppered John’s lips.   He held Sherlock’s head and pulled him in for a deeper kiss until Sherlock collected his wrists and held them over John’s head and against the mattress.  He tipped his hips to rub their cocks together and John tried to thrust up to meet the action. Sherlock lifted until John stilled.
“Well that’s hardly making me hard.” Sherlock crossed his legs and arms.  “Someone who sounds like they can’t be bothered to want you is perhaps the least erotic thing there is.”
“I want your fingers in me,” Sherlock said, his voice husky from silent shouts and gasps.  “Push your juices inside me.”
“He seems to be preoccupied with hurting me and Rosie,” John replied.  “I think the other passengers are fine as long as they don’t try to help.”
“What? Whatever it is, we’ll talk about this later.” John looked over his shoulder. “But, for now, just fucking fuck me.”
Over and over Sherlock’s mind replayed the vision of John stood before him, a suicide vest around him; John, telling Sherlock to shoot; John with those little red laser pinpoints skittering over his body. Sherlock’s heart thumped in his chest and his brain tiptoed on the verge between fear and the consuming problem of James Moriarty.
“Of course,” Sherlock answered. He picked up his phone and ordered Chicken Bhuna, Murgh Bemisal, mushroom rice, pilau rice and Kingfisher beer. He and John had already discussed the benefits of foods that aided digestive transit without too much pain and medium-hot curry had ended up on top of the list. Sherlock walked through to his bedroom and changed into his pyjamas. He’d taken a shower before they’d left the ABO Health Centre; the baths were purely for comfort’s sake. If his had to wait until the morning, he decided it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. He picked up John’s laptop and checked his emails.
“You’re a very singular man, Sherlock Holmes.” John kissed him tenderly, then swept his tongue over Sherlock’s. He pulled back, eyes warm and soft. “I love you something rotten. But, right now, I really want a shower. Much as I know you love all the ooze, I want to be clean.”
“I’m afraid I will simply not allow you to leave until I’m satisfied that you’ve both taken on adequate nourishment,” Dr Marshall said. “Mr Holmes’ brother has given me strict orders to make sure that you’re both fit and well before you leave. Even if you are a Doctor.”
John nodded.  He took a couple of deep breaths and felt the sharp prick of tears behind his eyes.  Sherlock reached over and squeezed his hand.
Whether it was the circumstance or the timing, Jason’s death made John wonder how he’d cope with Sherlock’s death again.  It hurt. Yes, Mycroft’s jibes about using sex workers hurt. John knew Mycroft might, at some point, use it against him. Oddly, he knew he’d handle Mycroft when it came.  He’d taken, and would take, responsibility for his actions. However, in that moment, when Jason’s body lay on the marble floor, John had seen Sherlock’s body all over again and it had shaken him.
“Just remember genie, that I taught him everything he does to you.”  Fabian smiled a dark smile. “Every time he makes love to you, it is with hands that touched me first. Je lui ai tout appris.”
“Of course,” John grumbled. He leant forward and put his forehead to his knees. Sherlock bent over and started to smooth the liquid over John’s hair. He worked it into bubbles and massaged John’s scalp with his fingers. “God, that feels nice.” Sherlock carried on washing. He used the lather to rub the tense muscles in John’s neck and then shoulders. “Fuck me, if you’re trying to seduce me, you’ve already done it. Not that you’re getting anything tonight, boy-o.”
.” John’s eyes were firmly shut, the words forced out by Sherlock’s thrusts. He licked his lips between words. Sherlock’s forming knot pressed in and in, and John’s body capitulated with grasping contractions which drew Sherlock in even further. “Come,” John begged, and Sherlock’s body wanted to deliver.
“He’s on the telly, Sherlock.  He does that show, y’know, the quiz thing.  The one you don’t like because you always say that the right answers are always wrong.”
Sherlock continued. “I don’t want people to see us have sex. As I said, this will be a sham. It will be a performance that you and I give. I don’t intend for what happens to truly reflect our sex life. That’s why, for example, I plan on deferring entirely to you. Lestrade pointed out that you were uncomfortable with the whole plan. As a result, I intend to give control over what happens to you. We will do only what you are comfortable with.  You’re in charge, John.”
“Boring. I put my phone there, the person who changed the bedding put the mints there. I don’t know why. Still, my turn.” Sherlock grabbed lube and the slim dildo from the bedside table and plonked himself flat on his back on the bed. “Go on, then.”
“Are you doing all the hard work tonight, then?”  John asked rhetorically as Sherlock thrust against him achingly slowly. There was only just enough friction and it was already maddening.
“It’s alright, Rosie, Daddy’s just feeling unwell,” Sherlock said.  “He needs to go to hospital, which is a big place where there are lots of doctors…” The bell downstairs went and Sherlock left the room, Rosie still in his arms.
“Do I want to ask?” John grinned and pulled his gun from the back of his trousers. He reached into Sherlock’s coat pocket to retrieve his handcuffs.
“He and Les made a fortune from the hat business. Now he invests in other firms when they need monies. He always makes a profit,” Nathan replied.
“You did until you emptied the bills bank account by buying five hundred Petri dishes.” John shook his head. Sherlock began to talk but was swiftly interrupted. “I know, I know, there was an experiment. There’s always a sodding experiment.”
He came with a whimper rather than a cry. He buried his head against John’s neck and flopped down onto the bed.
Sherlock pumped a decent about of lube into his palm, sat back and wrapped one hand around his dick, the other around his balls. He sighed and closed his eyes. He’d managed to do this, once, handcuffed to a radiator, his crotch thrust forward below his constraints. It was familiar, this method of pleasure. It was the preferred, reliable way. When Sherlock opened his eyes again, John was sat in front of him, slowly stroking his own penis.
“Please,” Sherlock whispered when John’s lips moved down, down to Sherlock’s neck and collarbone where he gently nipped the tender flesh. He kissed along the curve of Sherlock’s sternum before detouring to take one puckered nipple into his mouth. John flicked the nub with his tongue and then sucked, then flicked some more. Sherlock moved with the intention of taking his own cock in hand, but John must’ve realised because both of his hands were swiftly pushed away and into the mattress.
“Mycroft Holmes, if you don’t get Sherlock to a hospital immediately, I will find you and pluck out your public hairs one by one and then ram the itchy little fuckers up your nose.”
Sherlock yawned as he stuffed a pillow into a clean case.  John tucked in the last layer of sheets and blankets.  He stood.
“Oh.” Sherlock’s heart was a machine gun and it rat-a-tat-tatted through his body. Blood rushed to his head, to his heart, and to his groin. “I never forgot.”
When Mary died, John had stopped the suppressants again with the intention of hooking up with his Grindr heat buddy. His heat never came. As John’s heartbreak eased and his relationship with Sherlock healed, John lost his interest in casual hook-ups. John and Rosie had moved to 221C Baker Street and they shared their days with Sherlock.
“It’s complicated,” John replied.  “I lived with Aaron, but he died. Then I met Ma-Marilyn. Then she died. Now Aaron and I are busy bringing up Marilyn’s and my daughter.” John pulled Sherlock in for a half-hug and snuck another look at his groin.
“I try not to hurt you.” Sherlock softened his touch and let his fingers ghost over the arch of John’s foot making him laugh and squirm.
Mary was a Beta. She was different; she was fertile, and she acted more like an Alpha than most Betas ever dared. She’d tempted John in a way he thought he’d never be tempted again. When Sherlock returned, in a fit of pissed off fury, John had stopped his suppressants and started on ‘Alpha’ hormones until Mary fell for Rosie. Afterwards, as his and Mary’s relationship had yawned apart, John quietly started the suppressants again. Mary hadn’t noticed. No one noticed. Not even that one.
“Look, Nathan, is there anything else you haven’t told us?”  John said. “I don’t want to be a bastard about this, but you really need to just tell us if there’s anything else.”
The edges of Sherlock’s vision fuzzed into hazy-red and he shook his head to clear it. Sherlock would not let the frenzy of a heat-induced rut to take over and, potentially lead him to hurt John. All the same, within a few strokes, he knew that his hips were taking orders from John’s body and John’s body alone. Their fast fuck was punctuated by only the sounds of slick slaps as skin kissed skin. With every stroke, John made an ‘ah’ sound and, for Sherlock, it was music, poetry, and an aphrodisiac all in one.  His knot started to form.
“Not for Lesley Shaw,” John replied.  “Her husband owns shares in Doubles.  He was the man who buggered Brandon Cox to death.”
At school, John's best mate, James, was gay. He had been the captain of the rugby team; a prop. James had joined the army with John; he was a man's man, tall, muscled and dark haired. More than once, after a night out with the rugby team, he and John had ended up in bed.  It was just wanking and the odd sloppy kiss. In the morning, James told him to make up his mind. So, he had. He’d quickly bedded a girl called Natalie and fancied himself in love. That's what John Watson had done for the next twenty odd years. He’d made up his mind and settled for girls.
“Consider me seduced.” Sherlock backed John up against the bed and they fell in a heap. “God, I want you.”
“I always knew how much you loved him. You loved me too.  I know that. I want you to be happy. I want Rosie to be happy. And Sherlock.”
“So Liverson stopped Daniels from indulging in his desires in privacy.  Did Daniels and Liverson ever have a sexual relationship?”
“God, Sherlock.” John reached back with one hand to work his cock again, and his hips met each of Sherlock’s thrusts. “I’m close, really close.”
“You don’t have everyday suits,” John said.  He pulled Sherlock’s head down for a quick kiss.  “Just put on a suit that you like.”
Much to Sherlock’s horror, he started to swoon. He’d had a bloody nose more than once but never before had it made his vision swim in such an alarming way. Sherlock noticed his hands shake and tried and failed to speak. He waved a single arm in the air like a conductor guiding his own collapse. And then, Sherlock fainted.
John returned to his seat. Sherlock stood, looking at the paintings on the wall of Langridge’s office.
and between John’s legs. John spread his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders, rested his head on Sherlock’s and waited. Sherlock didn’t know when his sobs stopped. He cried for his sister. He cried for Mycroft. He cried for his parents. He cried for John and for Rosie, who could have so easily ended up without him. And he cried because John warned him and Sherlock did not listen, ever drawn to the darkness.
“So, you want to see if our sexual needs match before I, essentially, give you my cock for three days.” Sherlock’s lips twitched.
“We got briefed on it,” Lestrade replied. “Sometimes cases like that give other people the courage to report people.  We only got a few. One of ‘em was a bloke who asked if we’d arrest his flatmate for using his Stork margarine to wank with.”
“Touch my balls,” Sherlock demanded.  His eyes slipped shut and his hands fluttered in the air.  He seemed utterly overcome.  John took one of Sherlock’s bollocks into his mouth until the undulations of Sherlock’s writhing body became too much.  John turned the prostate massager up to the second level.
“I bought you a present,” she’d said, and pulled a box from the bag. From out of that box, Mary pulled a thick, red dildo with a flared base.
Much to John’s surprise, Sherlock continued to act as normal, despite the move they were going to make. But this normal was also a bit abnormal. Sherlock stopped hiding his affection for John or Rosie. He took out the rubbish, made breakfast and even washed up. Moreover, Sherlock’s occasional uncertainty, tender touches, glances, and little smiles made him absolutely fucking adorable. All at once, John seemed to be as mad about Sherlock as he’d ever been. Possibly more.
John and Sherlock return to Langridge's to visit the Blackout room and to talk to Charles Langridge.  Back at home, John has a surprise for Sherlock.
Inside, John circled his finger. Sherlock had observed that John’s cock was larger than the average Omega cock, but, even still, it wasn’t much thicker than the dildo laid on the bed.
“Take the hose thing off,” Sherlock demanded with a wafted hand. He wiggled his bum to the edge of the bed and got to his feet. He was a little unsteady, but not for long. Sherlock collected his drip stand, dragged it around the bed and then walked to John. He peered myopically at the console of the chair, pressed a few buttons, and the ‘hose thing’, as Sherlock so eloquently put it, flopped off of John’s cock.
John’s authoritative tone woke Sherlock from his sleep. He opened his eyes. John was in a towel, here in Sherlock’s bedroom. He hadn’t left.
“But John, it’s better than without it, surely?” Sherlock’s expression switched from unhappiness to concern. “Without that, you’ll be in pain. Inside of ten minutes, you’ll be begging strangers…”
“Not quite,” Sherlock said. “You’ll be entertaining Mr Tyler in the film room. Although Mr Tyler won’t be able to see us, John and I will be present. We simply want to observe his behaviour.”
A few more strokes and John cried out as he too came.  He threw his head back in ecstasy and so close were they that, in doing so, John headbutted Sherlock’s nose.
“Mycroft, you’ve got to be able to do something.”  John’s hand around his phone was almost crushing it.  He was losing his temper. He knew it.  He was approaching a car crash and didn’t know how to stop.  “What’s the point in you…”
“I trust that you would like to know where your Dr Watson presently is?”  Mycroft raised an eyebrow.
