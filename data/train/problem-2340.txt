“Sherlock.” John complained, even though he’d resigned himself to let Sherlock have his way with this, five was just too many.
Sherlock broke in that moment, hesitation forgotten in the sight of John breaking apart and he was suddenly standing beside the bed near John's head. Falling to his knees, Sherlock bowed lower, pressing his nose against the exposed ear before him, nuzzling against it. A hand reached out and clasped a hold of John’s. Sherlock carded the fingers of his free hand through damp blond hair and cradled the back of his head.
Sherlock, withering, brought John flush against him. John puffed out a heavy breath, his pulsing cock jammed between their bodies, rubbing against their stomachs, thumping harshly between them with each one of Sherlock’s sudden and chaotic thrusts.
This woman and John weren’t going to get along. A growl choked deep in his throat, restrained, just barely.
John remembered the alpha saying as much the night before, but it was hard to consider that the man had been speaking truth.
“No, has it occurred to you that the bomber's playing a game with you? The envelope, breaking into the other flat, the dead kid's shoes. It's all meant for you.”
“I saw it on the telly. Are you okay?” John was winded; he hadn’t had enough time to catch his breath after running like mad to the flat.
John hummed, voicing thought, and suckled at the omega's flesh, pressing his pelvis into Sherlock's side.
The tension written on John's face softened to one of pained understanding and Sherlock cursed the alpha then. He didn't want that.
He quickly stocked up on food. Since he wasn't much of a cook and didn't know what groceries to buy to make a full balanced meal, Sherlock opted for buying frozen pre-made food, four batches of bananas, and called it a day. Waddling back home and discarding the grocery bags on the kitchen counter before hurrying back to their bedroom.
“I know.” Sherlock gave John a rare and kind smile, because seeing how much John truly worried over him made Sherlock feel light.
Sherlock felt that pain, the same pain he’d felt the moment after he’d faked his death and John had slipped into his first omega drop. It was always there, pulling, tugging, needing the strength of their weakened bond. John’s eyes looked sad in the photograph given to him, lonely, in need and it pained him greatly they’d been separated for so long, but it had to be done.
"On my omega hole." Sherlock added with a devious smirk when the alpha inhaled sharply. "See you home, John." Sherlock rushed and quickly hung up. He giggled to himself as he finally unlocked himself from out of the bathroom and went to see his mother waiting for him.
When Sherlock had finished cleaning up after himself and changing the alpha's sheets, he'd gone to his bathroom to shower and change his clothes. Once finished, the omega went to the kitchen and found the alpha mixing chicken with the freshly made salad and quietly moved to stand behind the alpha. Startling the older man when his arms wrapped around a hard and muscular waist.
"J-John, really now." Sherlock gruffly admonished, a quaking hand moving to hesitantly rest against silk blond hair.
“I won’t give in.” John swore and buried his head in the pillowed cushion of the ground, his cock still hard, never flagging for a minute, hot slick sliding down his thighs and soaking his ass and pants further.
“One of our men died getting this information. All the chatter, all the traffic concurs. There is going to be a terrorist strike on London, a big one.”
” John growled, sliding his tongue back in Sherlock’s mouth and consuming him wholly. Mumbling against Sherlock’s mouth, breathing raggedly and licking pale pink lips, “
Sherlock accepted John’s scenting. Sherlock shared his room with him. Sherlock never flirted back with Irene. Sherlock stayed, even if Irene was alive, Sherlock chose John. Sherlock never rejected John’s help on cases when John had gone. These meant things, though not as grand as a sentimental confession, Sherlock was demonstrating he cared.
The silence... That was answer enough, but Sherlock wanted it confirmed so he remained silent and waited until John finally dared to say what he realized.
“There is a contract stating the terms of which this marriage will be performed under in the back of the folder. Sign the contract and I’ll have someone pick it up tomorrow morning. It will be notarized and someone will send you back a copy.”
"Yes, but they all soon realized their mistake and divorced to be with their true mates. Tell me, has John mentioned anything about divorcing his wife?" Sherlock turned to glare at Mycroft.
"Come back, John." Sherlock rushed out, the plea in his voice so clear that John's heart throbbed painfully.
John wasn’t the best of cooks, but he was acceptable and he did have signature specialties. He was also great with grilling meats. John typically cooked all their meals and remained sitting eating alone while Sherlock left him after the bites of his meal to occupy his time with something else.
“Please, there’s just one more thing, one more thing, one more miracle. Sherlock, for me. Don’t be… dead. Would you do that,
“I’m just taking the days as they come. I took some time off from work. I don’t really want to go out all that much these days.” John answered honestly.
Sherlock differed from John in every way imaginable. Sherlock prided himself for his intelligence, was cunningly arrogant and prideful. John liked to hide in the background, was studious, modest, and bright. Sherlock liked the finer things and always dressed to the nines. John didn’t care for the materialistic designer clothing and chose more efficient durable fabrics. Why buy expensive delicate clothing when there was cheaper clothing out there that could last longer?
“John, dear!” John recognized the voice as Mrs. Holmes and the woman bounded down the steps of her home to reach him.
John bit back a whimper, palming the hardness of his cock as he hurriedly made his way to the bed. Toeing off his shoes, John knelt on the comforting mattress and crawled closer to the slim lump of a body. Hard-pressing himself against the heated lump, John couldn’t choke back a needing sob. The body shifted against him and a gravelly moan of confusion was his answer.
Sherlock shook his head. He needed his work; he’d have to make it work, on his terms. He’d agreed to marry, but that didn’t mean he agreed to change. What was marriage really? Some papers that said you were recognized as legal partners, a sharing of possessions that was all really. Sherlock could do that. He’d still take his suppressants; he’d be civil with his alpha, but he’d make it clear to the man that their union would be on paper only, and that there was no need for any more than that. If this alpha submissive decided he couldn’t wed under such conditions, the alpha could call off the wedding, than Sherlock wouldn’t have broken the rules of the contract he’d signed and he’d be free to live his life as he’d wanted to, alone.
“John!” Harry worriedly spoke, arms holding onto John tight as the omega’s knees gave way to such damning thoughts.
John couldn't believe it. The amount of care Sherlock laid on him, he didn't... He had never dreamed Sherlock could be so forgiving, but he wouldn't fight it. God, no. John would strive to work on deserving Sherlock's care. Even if it were only this much the omega could offer, he could take a life of friendship and kind touches as this for the rest of his life, if it meant he would always have Sherlock.
wronged Sherlock so immensely that he couldn't even see a way of redeeming himself, so if it meant Sherlock would bond with him and further heal himself through degrading him, John would take this punishment. He deserved worse.
"Sherlock! Where is Sherlock? I felt the bond break... Is he...?" John was trembling, voice wavering on tears, as he scrambled out of the bed and reached out for Mycroft. Grasping at the offered hand used to stay him and clenching it viciously.
Several hours later when John woke, he found Sherlock curled up close to him, breathing steadily in a deep sleep. John knew he should slip out of bed and get ready, but instead he spent several more minutes in Sherlock’s embrace, running his fingers through dark curls. Sherlock shifted slightly against him, released a content sigh, but his rest remained undisturbed by John’s attention. When John couldn’t hold off leaving their bed, he pressed a gentle kiss at Sherlock’s hairline and left Sherlock to his sleep while he readied himself for work. A smile tugged at the ends of his lips and remained, no matter how hard John tried to hide it.
Sherlock squirmed, tugging the sheets from the bed, creating a mess around them. One leg jerked, sliding down the bed before he raised it back and in place, keeping himself open.
“Right now… I hate you.” John whispered, voice sore, his shaky hands taking hold of Sherlock’s hands and removed them from his face.
“I have a therapist already.” John graveled, knowing that Mycroft worked for the government and most likely already knew this.
“He’s treating her to a meal, but his own portion is small. That means he wants to impress her, but he’s trying to economize on his own food.”
He'd left Sherlock to be miserable alone, all so he could speak to Mycroft, and what he meant by speaking, he meant-
"Right. Two French toasts, eggs, sausage, with coffee and orange juice, isn't enough substance. It's been two hours since then, of course you need to replenish." John moved to stand by Sherlock's side and smiled at the wall instead of at the flustering omega.
Time passed, but John wasn’t the same, his appetite decreased, he slept little if at all. Months passed and John tried. He really did try, but he knew it was futile. This wasn’t about fighting and winning. It was about trying to gain a little more time for his loved ones and that’s all he could do in the end.
“Waiting for you.” John rasped and dolefully watched as Sherlock shrugged off his coat and scarf, retrieved his nightwear and began changing in front of him.
John winced when claws dug into his scalp, but he refused to answer. If he did, it would only hurt his omega. He wasn't sure on the exact number, but he could round as the omega had asked of him before, but he wouldn't. Sherlock could beat him bloody and John would never tell Sherlock.
John grumbled with dissatisfaction. Figuring his feelings were far too confusing to understand at this very moment, he decided to sleep on it. John just needed to sleep this off and things would hopefully make sense later.
“I… Sherlock… I…” John tried; wanting to put those confessions within his mind out there in the open, reveal just how deeply he felt for Sherlock, but the words choked up in his throat.
"Good shot." Sherlock stood before the alpha, surrounded by the hysteria of a crime scene, a crowd of police, curious civilians, and reporters.
“I swear, I didn’t mean to hurt you.” Sherlock murmured against John’s mouth before claiming his lips in an ardent and gentle kiss.
The chiming of his mobile rang and John retrieved it to see he’d received a text from an unknown number, but not an unknown sender.
“None of that matters now. That is the past. We can still work through this. You can make it up to me by staying with me and accepting me.”
John felt Sherlock’s knot, it grew steadily, and pressed his inner walls, closing around him, sealed them together and John knew Sherlock was close, so close. John unwound one arm from around Sherlock to take hold of himself and was immediately joined by Sherlock’s own hand. Their fingers threaded together while their thumbs worked as one, after every upward tug they rubbed the glistening head of John’s cock before stroking back down.
Mycroft’s smile was smug, much like a cat that’d caught its canary. Handing over the folder he’d been given earlier, Mycroft waited for John to take it.
"You're a right horror." John snickered against the shell of Sherlock's ear and nipped at it, feeling flirtatious.
"Sherlock?" John called out in the darkness of their bedroom after a long time of silence, but they both knew each was awake.
Sighing heavily, John decided today had been a long day and right not he didn’t want to deal with Sherlock’s mood swings. Instead, John left the omega alone and went to his room, hoping some sleep would help clear his mind.
The moment they'd left Harry's place and entered the cab, heading home, Sherlock's act disappeared and the omega exhaled a heavy breath. Pressing himself deeply into his seat, his eyes shut, and his head tipped back.
John’s eyes stung from sleep deprivation and having cried. He knew he looked a mess and yet, he couldn’t bring himself to care when the front door of the flat opened. Sherlock stood beyond it, head bowed low enough that John found it difficult to get a good look at him.
It didn’t take long for Sherlock to find John; he was out in the yard, admiring the beauty of Sherrinford blanketed in a thick layer of white snow. The leather black coat his omega wore seemed to be keeping him warm in the chilly winter evening.
“I must be mad, because I think you’re absolutely stunning in whatever you do. I think I like watching you drive more than I like staring out at the scenery.”
Inhaling a deep breath, Sherlock held it in his chest for a long pause. Exhaling it heavily, he moved to open the door and entered the well-lit room. His gaze hardly met John's own before the alpha was on him. Hands shot out to palm his battered face. Dark blue searchingly took in the damage, lips parted in a breathless gasp as John took notice of the bandaged gash on his head, the bandage already turning red.
John's eyes widened with horror. Sherlock couldn't mean... This wasn't right. Sherlock's mind... This was dangerous. Sherlock needed more help than what he could provide. Something needed to be done or Sherlock's health would further deteriorate. This jealousy stemmed from feeling inadequate, John could see that now. For a time, things were looking up, Sherlock faltered some, but nothing like this. If not for... If not for John's mistakes. If not for the fact Mary was pregnant and they could divorce immediately, Sherlock wouldn't be like this.
Clare sat beside Harry and for all that John was worth he focused passed the rapid pulsing of his heart and the rushing of his mind to keep up with their conversation.
Lesson 3 was a part of the series of the documentary he’d been watching. The same alpha and omega couple were shown once more. Though this time, the documentary spoke more in depth about the omega’s heat cycle. John knew this documentary well, he’d lived it twice, but it was helpful to hear the scientific outlook. When the DVD ended, he paused on the fourth and reread the title again.
John whimpered, hugging one of Sherlock’s legs, and pressing it closer to his head as he tongued the underside of Sherlock’s cock, grooving over it with the roughness of his tongue.
." John whimpered piercingly and that sound, the pain, joy, and love circulating the utterance of his name tugged at his heart.
"I want to name these pups, including the ones you've given me to carry. But right now, what I want most of all is to have you roll me on my hands and knees, scratch my back with those tender hands, and fuck me until I'm a pile of sweat and sex juices." He might be jealous of the attention John was showing the pups, but he was pregnant. Of course he could be greedy of his alpha's affections.
It’s quiet for a while, save for the thumping of Sherlock’s heart loud in his ears.  He can’t seem to come down, and John is stroking his hair, running a hand up and down his back, kissing him, petting him, murmuring.
inadvisable, especially to enemies. Your name is the path to your soul. Your birthday is the path to your past and future.”
“Yes,” the man says.  “In fact, he considers me something of an enemy.  He’s quite melodramatic, actually, so perhaps archenemy would be a better descriptor.”
“Not particularly,” Sherlock says, shoulders relaxing a fraction when John takes up the conversation again. “My tutors were idiots, and my parents were annoying.”
“Of course it was,” John says.  His hand is shaking on Sherlock’s shirt, but he can’t bring himself to let go.
“Oh,” John says, startled.  He’s not surprised, not really, but it’s still shocking to hear it said so plainly.  “So, the place she was trying to go – it was all green and black, that was where dead people go?”
John smiles at him tiredly. “I couldn’t help it,” he says. “I’m lonely, too. I like seeing you. I feel better when I see you. It’s like having a family, isn’t it?”
“Budge up,” he says, and Sherlock obediently bends his knees so John can sit on the couch. John sets the bag and cutlery down on the table next to what looks like a large paper lantern, though the material is too thick and smooth to be paper. “What’s this, then?” John asks, pointing to it.
lifetimes ago, but Sherlock is doing his best not to draw parallels. Instead, he focuses on the present. He strides forward towards John’s taxi, but takes an awkward step back once he’s gotten close, his hands clasped behind his back, his heart beating unusually fast.
He’s so focused on her that the world around them ceases to exist, something that often happens when he concentrates so fully, but this time, he’s made aware of it by a sound that has him blinking and coming back to reality to look up and see John.
Mrs. Hudson is still silent, holding her tea tray as she watches, and John feels trapped under Sherlock’s gaze. “Why?” he asks.
John comes back a moment later, menu in hand, and sits in the little space between the edge of the sofa and Sherlock’s back. He peers over and sees the lights, and smiles. “That’s lovely,” he tells him.
“You’re very brave,” she tells him after a moment of staring at him in clear scrutiny. She smiles, though it’s a bit teary. “Sherlock is your most precious treasure, isn’t he?”
When they finally leave the bed, after showering and dressing, John urges Sherlock to finally make the tea while he shaves. Sherlock rolls his eyes and complies after a lot of complaining, but he finds himself going to the living room instead of the kitchen and heading straight to his violin. He smiles and takes it out of the case, tunes it quickly, plays a half-hearted scale and a few fragments of melodies he’s been playing the past few days before he turns to his music stand. The Bruch is still open, and he turns to the second movement.
“Yes, thank you, you’ve overstayed your welcome as usual,” Sherlock snipes, and John can’t help the way the corner of his mouth twitches even though he’s still struggling to breathe and understand what’s going on.
, and he went somewhere unbelievable, and his heart clenches in sadness when he realizes their night is coming to an end.
John laughs, closing his eyes against the warmth of the sun as he does. “I was normal before I met you, I think,” he says, once the laughter has passed. He opens his eyes to turn and look at Sherlock once more, taking in his profile as Sherlock looks up at the sky.
Mary giggles, and John turns to her in surprise. “Sorry,” she says. “It’s just – you two are rather close, aren’t you? And don’t worry, John, it’s really not lonely. It’s fine.”
Compared to the surge of spirits and ghosts he knows he’ll face if he leaves, he thinks indulging in this strange man’s conversation seems favorable, and so he takes a step forward as he puts his hand in his pocket, fingers curling around the cold metal of the dog tags that lie inside.
“Are you crazy?” John says when he realizes that Sherlock is leading them out of the forest, back to the procession of spirits.
Sherlock nods tightly, but can’t help but rock back and forth on his heels, all the magic of St. Mungo’s coming further into his awareness like it’s crushing him; the clinical magic of the monitors in John’s room, the magic from the Healers, the magic from the wards, the magic from the people filling the hospital. It’s a bit much for him, especially on top of the anxiety he’d felt when Mike texted.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “It’s a hollowed out fruit from last year’s harvest. This tree only comes into full bloom once a year, and when it happens, the fruits produce a nectar you can only get from this particular ceremony. It’s very lucky to be invited.”
Sherlock nods. “Think of the good things they’ve given you,” he advises. “Get them on your side. When you’re in Moriarty’s presence, set them on him. This part is crucial, John, because while Moriarty can’t kill you, other forces can.”
“Oooh, how exciting!” Moriarty says. He grins widely and winks at John, but John can only stare at Redbeard, confusion washing over him.
Redbeard responds by settling back in against his neck, pressing a kiss there. John feels optimistic and he goes to the left, but it’s just like it was before: endless darkness.
He takes it out and looks at it for a moment, then holds it up towards the one he sees.  Inexplicably, it defies gravity and stretches upward out of his hand, elongating until it meets the other.
“Are we ready, then?” Billy asks, clearly excited and moving his lower jaw rapidly so it appears he’s bouncing on the table.
“Take him,” Sherlock says, thrusting his hand out closer to John. “He’s yours. If I want to see him, I know where to find him. It’s your turn to have him.”
“Sherlock,” John says, his voice rough and low. “You –” He stops and clears his throat, tugs on Sherlock’s hair again, and Sherlock goes boneless. “Touch yourself,” John says.
“He’s away,” John says. He picks at his sandwich, but doesn’t move to take a bite. “He left Sunday morning, and hasn’t been back.”
“Of course I do,” Sherlock says arrogantly. Billy laughs, and Sherlock scowls at him. “It’s Geoffrey.”
And then John’s lips are moving beneath his, slippery and real and beyond anything he could’ve imagined, and then they part and Sherlock doesn’t know what he’s doing, but he wants to taste him, to catalogue everything about him, and his tongue pushes forward a little bit, lining the soft edges of the insides of John’s lips, brushing lightly against his teeth, and was that
“Starving,” Sherlock says, and then they’re off, John leading them confidently through a maze of hallways, their footsteps echoing off the stone hallways until they finally enter a giant kitchen.
He opens his eyes and looks at John questioningly, but John just smiles and comes to the bed, sitting up against the headboard, a screaming Iris in one arm and a bottle in the other.
“Ah,” Mycroft says, looking at John in a knowing way that makes John throw his hands up in frustration and turn away from them, walking in the other direction.
, when he’d thought having John would make these black moods go away. It hasn’t, and in some ways, it makes them
An old man is standing next to the steps of 221B, staring up at the building in confusion. He doesn’t reply to John, so John clears his throat. “Sorry, sir, can I help you?” John asks again, and this time, the old man looks up. He looks at John with raised eyebrows before looking to the left and right, seeing no one nearby, and then pointing to himself questioningly, looking back at John. John nods.
“I know,” John says. He hesitates, then continues. “You’ll need something in your stomach if you’re going to fix my leg, right?”
“Mummy’s,” Sherlock interrupts, eyes widening. His heart is beating fast; he rarely allows himself to think of this night, let alone speak of it, and yet here he is, discussing it with someone who not only believes him, but was
“No,” Sherlock says sharply. “Of course I wasn’t at Hogwarts. I trust Mike has informed you of my last name, and I’m sure you’ve heard rumors of the younger Holmes brother.” He feels on edge suddenly, sure John is going to leave. Everyone does, once they realize who he is.
“I can hear you,” Sherlock says suddenly, loudly and pointedly towards the kitchen. “At least be useful and bring tea!”
“It’s not exactly a bachelor pad,” John says. “My flatmate is a little – he’s a bit odd. But I don’t feel so lonely anymore, not with him around.”
to, really, it was weird…” He trails off, unsure, and Sherlock smiles, leading him into the living room.
“I’m a bit different from Sherlock and Mycroft,” Greg says. “I don’t do flashy things like they do. I can do the occasional bit of small telekinesis or things like that, nothing fancy.” He shrugs and takes a drag of his cigarette, which smells of regular tobacco, not like Sherlock’s special blend.
She looks down again and takes a deep breath. “One time, when I was young, I visited my grandmother. I made her a cup of tea. She choked on it and died. How does someone die choking on tea?” She pauses, still twisting her bracelet and not looking at John. “A few weeks later, I had a new babysitter. She came over to watch me while my parents were out. She died in a car accident on her way home; drove off the road. A few days later, my neighbors got a new dog. I pet him, and he got hit by a car not five minutes later. One time I made a new friend on my street. She was my age, too, and we took a walk together by a river. We held hands, like little girls do, and then as soon as we let go, she fell into the river and drowned. There wasn’t even anything nearby for her to trip on, and the river was hardly deep.”
“Take off your shirt,” Sherlock says, breathless, and John obligingly pulls her shirt over her head, tossing it aside and then running a hand through her shoulder length hair, letting it settle. Sherlock’s mouth waters at the way John’s breasts hang free, and she longs to touch them. She runs her hands up and down John’s sides, maintaining eye contact, and John’s expression goes soft in pleasure. Sherlock swallows, the sound loud in the soft quiet of the bedroom, and then John leans down and kisses her. Sherlock arches her back eagerly at the press of John’s body against hers, and then John breaks the kiss to tug at Sherlock’s shirt.
John is surprised by the sudden change in topic, but Sherlock is watching the man with an unwavering, hard expression. It’s not friendly, like his invitation would suggest.
“I suppose you wouldn’t, between sulking on the sofa and sitting there staring at the door waiting for me to come home,” John says before blowing across the surface of his tea. Billy laughs from the bookcase, his jaw thumping against the shelf, and John grins.
John frowns and turns back, noticing that the lower and deeper into the plant he looks, the more red the plant becomes.  He reaches in towards the center of the plant and frowns in alarm when he feels something brush his wrist.  He pulls away, but something wraps around his wrist and pulls him back.  His eyes widen in alarm and he sees that it’s a branch, and he looks up towards Sherlock in fear, but before he can catch a glimpse of his face, John is somewhere else.
John just stares for a moment. He opens his mouth to speak, then closes it, unsure how to proceed. “Right, hello,” he finally says. “Listen, I haven’t meant to come in here, so I’ll just go,” he adds, though his feet aren’t moving and something about this flat and this man are making it hard to think of being anywhere else.
I hope you enjoyed this part!  I'm sorry about the delay for this chapter; it's quite unusual for me and won't happen again, but I had some difficult RL circumstances last week.  But things should be back to normal now!  Also, the past few chapters have been a lot of world-building, but a lot of the bigger plot points will start kicking in soon, so get ready. :)  Thanks for reading!  As usual, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the story!
John strokes the side of his face and kisses him again, gentler this time. “Sorry,” he murmurs after a moment. “I got a little – is this too much?”
John breaks the kiss and he’s panting, still coming down from his orgasm.  “Christ,” John says. “Can’t believe you – can’t believe you tasted it.”
“Your wedding,” Sherlock says, keeping his eyes on his glass, then taking a long sip and avoiding John’s gaze.
“There’s nothing you can do to help me,” Sherlock tells him. His voice is gentle. “Maybe we’ll be able to meet like this again sometime, but I have to pay for my wish. It’s easiest for all of us if you just let me disappear.” His voice is soft and his eyes are trained on John’s. There’s something in them, a bleakness, that John doesn’t like.
“Less than a year ago,” John says. “It’s been…god, it was hard coming back. I had a terrible bedsit I hated being in and no friends. I was miserable and lonely. To be honest, I’ve always been lonely, ever since I was a kid. But it’s a different kind of loneliness when you come back.” He pauses and clears his throat. He hasn’t admitted this out loud, not really, but he thinks this old man knows what it’s like. He furrows his brow and trains his eyes on the ground. “I had nothing here, nothing to live for. It wasn’t…it wasn’t good. I felt like I had no place in this world, nothing to live for. Wasn’t sure I wanted to live.”
“So you don’t like competing?” John asks, unsure if he should be offended and ignoring Sherlock’s statement.
It seems so long ago now, and more vague thoughts of Sherlock pass through his mind; he thinks of Sherlock’s skin in the moonlight, Sherlock’s eyes crinkling with laughter, Sherlock’s hand wrapped around his. He feels something twisting in his chest and he thinks of Sherlock’s hand against the side of his face, and he stops, takes a deep breath and closes his eyes for a moment, overwhelmed by how strong his feelings are, letting them wash over him even though it’s terrifying and painful. When he opens his eyes, there’s a door in front of him, looming tall and foreboding in the darkness.
As soon as he’s outside, John flags down a taxi; he’s much too tired to walk. He sinks into the seat eagerly. He’s glad to be off his feet and able to relax for a moment.
The wine is sweet, but complex and earthy. It’s a beautiful taste, one John’s never experienced. “This is good,” he says, looking at the glass curiously.
Sherlock shrugs. “It’s very… it can be… overwhelming,” he says. “Magical signatures are very strong to me. Magic moves through the air in currents, and I’m constantly aware of them. Mummy used to put Sleakeazy on my head when I was younger, and it gave me a headache every time, having all that magic rubbed all over me. When she cast cleaning spells, it felt like there were ants all over my skin. Someone would simply
“I know you think I’m horrible,” Mycroft says. He’s sitting on Sherlock’s bed, and Sherlock is curled away from him, trying to ignore him. “But I constantly worry about you, Sherlock, all alone here while I’m at school. I know you don’t get along with the kids at school; I never did, either, but now I’m not even here at home to be with you.”
Greg runs forward as if freed from a spell. He takes John by the hand and yanks, hard, and then John knows no more.
That’s the only place for the words he wants to say to John and the things he feels for John, he thinks, deep under lock and key, where his miserable self won’t taint them.  He knows he ruins relationships.  He knows it’s only a fluke that John has somehow decided to make Sherlock his best friend, and so he couldn’t say those things and wouldn’t do anything to risk it.
; the guilt of feeling this way when he is finally with John and he should be happy claws at his insides and threatens to tear him apart.
Sherlock’s eyes crinkle in the corners, and his eyebrows soften. “I told you, John. Normal’s boring. You’re quite the opposite.”
But then he hears the door close, and Sherlock eases him up a tiny bit then sits beside him, one hand still cupping the back of John’s head.
That's all!  The end of this story has finally come!  I'd love to know what you thought of it, and I hope you enjoyed reading it.  It was fun to write, though it admittedly took me a lot longer than I expected.  :)
Dinner is quiet, with a few more touches than usual but nothing too out of the ordinary. Sherlock isn’t sure how to act or what is supposed to happen when he feels fundamentally different but everything around him remains the same. When John comes back downstairs after bringing Iris to bed, though, he seems just as unsure. He sits beside Sherlock on the couch, nudges his knee with his own. Sherlock puts aside his laptop and focuses his attention on John.
Sherlock swallows again and turns around, but John is no longer in the doorway; he’s gone to the kitchen, so Sherlock sits heavily in his chair, still half in the Bruch and half in his own head. He feels oddly exposed from John hearing him play with such abandon; his heart is pumping fast in his chest.
“Sherlock,” John says as he drops his hand, a thin patience in his tone that sounds ready to snap. “Do you know why you’re saying that?”
“No?” John asks.  He looks up and sees that it’s only raining in the area around them, nowhere else.  There is a patch of brightness above them, and the rain is falling through.  In the center of the rain, a ribbon hangs down.  It’s longer than seems possible, and with a start, John remembers the ribbon in his pocket.
“You are the best man I’ve ever known,” John murmurs. His voice is soft and tremulous. “You are incredible. You are the least selfish person I have ever met, Sherlock, Christ. Just – just shut up.”
“Sherlock,” he murmurs. He rubs his thumbs along Sherlock’s cheekbones, and Sherlock opens his eyes, his heart pounding. John’s hands are shaking now, too. “Sherlock, I – what have I done to deserve you?”
“Thanks,” the boy says, his voice barely above a whisper, his cheeks flushing.  He’s still staring at John with wide eyes when the curtain rustles open.
on his back, and so he slowly turns his head to check, afraid of what he’ll see, his body quivering - but there is nothing behind him.
“Christ,” John says. He takes another sip of beer, then a deep breath, then puts on a smile that isn’t quite right and turns back to Sherlock. “It’s alright,” he says.
Once outside, he swallows, nausea building in his stomach. He decides against the subway because it’s bound to be filled with more spirits than this one; they seem to like the underground, and he doesn’t want this lone spirit to turn into a cluster. He doesn’t fancy being trapped in a taxi with this thing, either, so he sets off at a brisk pace towards Baker Street. It’s about a ten-minute walk from the clinic, but at his current pace, more like five. Even so, it feels like hours.
Tears fill Mary’s eyes, and she turns away. “You are the stupidest man I’ve ever met,” she tells him, looking back at him suddenly. “I
“Oh,” John says. It’s awkward, suddenly, and Sherlock doesn’t like it. He takes his plate, mostly finished, and goes to the kitchen.
The door closes behind them and John and Sherlock are left in silence. It’s strangely anticlimactic, John thinks, to suddenly be back on their couch, surrounded by the familiar detritus of their everyday lives, back to the same banter as usual, the same familiar sounds of the London traffic.
Sherlock nods, but doesn’t move. “Your leg?” He manages once he feels a bit more composed, his voice quiet and muffled against John’s shirt.
Sherlock holds his hands over John’s leg, right over where the curse lies. Gently, he probes with his magic, feels the shape and contour of it. It’s cold and steely, and makes him shiver when his own magic comes too close to it. He knows he can remove it, but it will certainly take concentration and effort. He’d told John it was like a knot, and it is, but it’s like an intricate knot of steel, one he’ll have to work very hard to untangle.
Before John can say anything, a dial tone cuts across the line, and he musters up the energy to lean forward and put the phone back on the receiver, then leans back, holding his hand up and looking at Redbeard, who’s sitting on his fingers.
Sherlock shakes his head and swirls his glass, watching the shifting light reflect off the surface of the wine. “I haven’t,” he says.
Greg nods thoughtfully. John realizes that even with all the questions he wants to ask Greg, they’re only talking about Sherlock. While there’s infinitely more he wants to ask about him, he tells himself he’s being ridiculous and decides to change the subject and try to get some answers for once. “Why are you here? I mean, what is this, a dream?”
Suddenly, though, a loud whistling fills the kitchen and they break apart, hearts beating fast, breath coming in shaky gasps. They share a moment of charged, shocked eye contact before John blinks, then remembers the tea, and steps away for a moment to turn the heat off and stop the whistling. His body feels shaky and cold in Sherlock’s absence, and the world feels like it’s shifting around him. The kitchen feels foreign with this newly awakened
His body jolts with the shock of it, and he blinks a few times to orient himself before he realizes that he’s standing in the park.  Mycroft is standing nearby, watching him with one eyebrow raised.  Mycroft has moved Sherlock to lie across a bench, and John hurries over and kneels beside Sherlock, his hands still wrapped around the warm, faintly glowing cupcake.
“I can guess,” Mummy says. “He’s only a child; he’s allowed to play,” she adds. Sherlock holds his nutcracker tighter and leans into Mummy’s touch. He doesn’t like being called a child, but he knows it will get Mycroft into trouble if he goes along with it, so he allows it this time and glares at Mycroft, who sighs, which he’s been doing a lot ever since he became a teenager. Sherlock hates it.
John’s brow furrows and his lips purse as he wonders if that explanation is supposed to make sense to him. “Right, okay,” he says after a moment, and Billy laughs in his hands, which makes John grin despite his confusion.
The taxi ride back to 221B is uncomfortable. Sherlock is slumped in his seat, gazing out the window, ignoring John. John glances at him now and again, but he knows Sherlock is probably watching his reflection in the window, so he keeps it to a minimum. He’s
He goes through his scales again just to relish in how good it feels to play them without fighting himself, and then plays through his arpeggios, his fingers moving much more easily up and down the neck than they had before.   By the time he’s finished, his heart is beating in exhilaration, and he eagerly pulls out his Mozart.
She sounds cheerful, but John’s quite sure he just got rejected. He remembers her playful smiles, though, and the way she’d looked up at him through her lashes, and he feels like they’d been flirting. It’s quite confusing, and he’s not sure which signals to pick up on. Either way, he doesn’t want her to meet Sherlock. It would be too strange.
John blinks, feeling like he’s somehow caught in a spell, and in that moment everything registers – the icy grey of Sherlock’s eyes, the milky white of his skin, the feeling of his long finger against John’s own cheek, the sounds of their breaths in the small space between them – and he steps back suddenly, snapping back into his own mind as Sherlock’s finger falls to his side. “But I haven’t received anything! I haven’t asked you for anything!” he says, anger clouding his thoughts. “You’ve just taken!”
“He should stop being boring for Christmas, too, then,” Sherlock says. “Just because he’s sixteen doesn’t mean he has to act like Great Uncle Alfred.”
Sherlock stares at him and then sits beside him. He looks like he wants to reach out for John, but he hesitates, unsure.
“Curse was cold,” Sherlock says. He closes his eyes, furrows his brow. “Cold and dark.” He shivers, the feeling of the magic still too close to his.
“Mm,” Sherlock says, taking a sip of tea. “It’s a sensory issue; I’m overly sensitive to magic, obviously, and because of the way my mind and my own magic process external magic, it can become quite overwhelming in large quantities, and it can become very… it can be abrasive and painful in certain ways. It’s… however, it can also feel very good. It’s… difficult to explain, and few people have ever asked me to and actually cared to hear the answer, so I don’t have a lot of experience describing it.”
John shrugs again, a bit uneasy. “I think it’s just a coincidence. Mary’s quite sweet, really.” He pauses, thinking for a moment, glancing at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. “Actually, she said she’d like to meet you tomorrow night, if you’re free.”
in 221B Baker Street. He glances at Sherlock, but Sherlock is watching the fortuneteller, his expression closed off and unreadable.
“Yes, it has,” she says, then turns toward John. She frowns for a moment and takes a step towards him. “Oh, you’ve certainly got a lot to worry about, don't you? With so many…
“Right,” John says, straightening. He glances at Sherlock, who’s looking at him with that small smile again, and his heart seems to float in his chest, his adrenaline leaving him but the magical ambience of this place replacing it with a sublime, floating, ethereal warmth that makes him feel unsteady and overwhelmed but nonetheless relieved. He looks down at the little fox-boy. “Thanks again,” he says. “I’ll see you soon, yeah?”
“Ah,” Sherlock says suddenly. “I believe there is one more guest who should attend our party. John, why don’t you go and get him? He’s down in the warehouse.”
He doesn’t know why it feels this way; he just knows that something is happening he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t know why Sherlock was apologizing, or why Sherlock is behaving so strangely. There’s so much he doesn’t know that it’s overwhelming.
“Well, next time, don’t just sacrifice yourself,” John says.  “You’re much more than  a learning incentive.  You can’t just do that, not for me.  Not for anyone.”
“John,” Sherlock gasps when John breaks away from the kiss. John looks at him, at his flushed cheeks and wet mouth, and desire swims through his veins, makes it feel like the bottom drops out of his stomach. He shifts down and kisses the base of Sherlock’s neck, licks along his collarbone, the salty sweat of Sherlock’s skin like heaven on his tongue.
John’s jaw drops for a moment and he just stares.  “Are you serious?  Are you bloody serious?  You don’t have to almost die to show me that some spirit I could care less about cares about me.  I don’t care if she cares about me!  What about you?  Don’t you see that people care about you?”
“Oh, you two get along so well, don’t you?” Mrs. Hudson says fondly, exchanging a conspiratorial glance with Billy, who’s resting atop the kitchen counter.
“Don’t be thick,” John says. His heart flutters in his chest and he’s sure once the shock of this all wears off he’ll have questions and fears and worries, but he has no doubt that this is the best thing that could have happened to him. He’s overwhelmingly happy to have Sherlock here, to touch him like this, to be close to him. John feels nervous; they haven’t talked about this, there are so many things he doesn’t understand – but being with Sherlock is astonishingly simple and
And in a flurry of movement, the soldiers obey, running past Sherlock as if he’s not even there to attack the mice while the nutcracker fights his way through to get to the king. Sherlock watches, entranced, as the nutcracker’s black boots move in a flurry of graceful movements while he fights, but Sherlock frowns because he’s clearly weakened from what happened to his arm. Nonetheless, he’s a strong fighter, and it seems like he’s doing well – but Sherlock realizes in horror that the mouse king is beginning to defeat him, and though the nutcracker is fighting as hard as he can, he’s starting to flag, receiving more hits than he’s landing.
he’ll be needing it, while simultaneously causing Sherlock to feel something in his stomach he hadn’t quite understood.) Sherlock listens to the unfamiliar sounds of uneven footsteps above him, and doesn’t know what to do with himself. He busies himself with looking over some potions notes he’d taken earlier in the week, but it’s hard to focus, distracted as he is by the sounds and the signature of unfamiliar magic drifting about upstairs. Interestingly, John’s magical signature isn’t harsh or strange to him, but he needs to observe it up close to examine it more thoroughly. It’s tainted, anyway, by the curse on his leg, which Sherlock would really like to investigate.
John swings both legs over the couch easily, but doesn’t take time to dwell. Instead, he stands on his own two legs without his cane and doesn’t even take a moment to rejoice (
The man shakes his head, and Sherlock leans forward. “But you do,” he murmurs. “Here,” he says, reaching across the table and tapping the side of the man’s mouth with his index finger as the man jerks away from his touch, “and here,” he finishes, tapping the man’s chest.
Sherlock sighs and forces himself to sit up. He takes the tea John’s holding out, and watches as John goes and sits in his chair.
He feels connected to his violin in a way he never has, and he’s so connected to the music that he doesn’t even realize a whole day has passed, doesn’t realize where he is or what he’s doing, only feels an energy he didn’t remember he could have buzzing through his veins, singing inside of him. He plays with everything inside of him, with his whole body, with his whole
The man frowns. “Right. Er, thanks, I guess,” he says, leaving his barely touched tea on the table and standing up. He heads towards the door, and Sherlock doesn't follow him, he just watches him go through narrowed eyes.
He freezes, listening very attentively when he hears a second voice with Mike, one he’s never heard before. He can sense the unfamiliar magic as well, and his heart picks up just a bit, unsure why Mike would be bringing a stranger with him. Surely Mike wasn’t like everyone else; surely Mike wasn’t expecting to treat someone to a freak show, and yet, he’s brought someone with him, and Sherlock can't think of any other reason why.
John smiles. “It’s alright, really; I enjoyed talking with you,” he says. He’s surprised to find that he’s being honest. He thinks of the old man, all alone in the world after having risked his life to protect, and he feels protective, somehow, eager to make it up to him somehow. “Would you like to meet tomorrow? I work until around 3, but if you’ve nothing else on…”
“John,” Sherlock breathes, barely audible. He doesn’t dare lift his head, lest this whole moment end.
Sherlock makes a look of disgust, and to his surprise, John laughs. “I’ll take that as a no,” John says in amusement. “I don’t these days, either, if you were wondering,” he adds.
do something, can’t he? John has given him the clues to what’s possibly the greatest case he’ll ever solve, a case he couldn't possibly have solved before meeting John: his heart.
“Teaching her to deduce already?” John asks. He’s standing close, and his eyes flicker between Sherlock’s. He reaches out and cups the back of Iris’ head, and Sherlock knows intimately the fuzzy warmth John feels under his fingers, which are just centimeters away from Sherlock’s body, and it feels like a shared secret.
He’s blinking at his phone, fixating on the “for us” tagged onto the text, his own bias towards John making him read into things he knows aren’t there. This closeness between them feels cruel, suddenly, and his vision blurs for a moment and there’s a sharpness in his chest and heaviness in his throat he doesn’t like before he blinks and blinks and it’s clear again.
“Enough!” Moriarty roars, his face twisted in anger and his voice suddenly harsh and demanding, the singsong lilt from earlier gone. He makes a jerking motion with his hand, and the entire web twists, pulling Sherlock’s arms and legs out. He grunts, and John’s hands twitch at his sides. He wants so badly to help, but he hasn't yet figured out how he can.
“Not everything is about Sherlock,” John interrupts. “There haven’t been any spirits. I’ve been doing fine; I even made a new friend.”
the door, dying in these miserable tunnels without even saving Sherlock – when suddenly Redbeard uncurls from his neck. He pokes his head out and cranes it to the left, jerking in that direction quite forcefully.
“Hello, Oliver,” he greets, holding his hand out for the owl, who coos at him gently but seems impatient as he rests on Sherlock’s finger, tapping one of his talons imperiously. “Yes, I know you’re in a hurry,” Sherlock tells him absently as he rushes off to the kitchen with the owl still perched on his outstretched hand, ignoring the way John is watching him.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say; he can only stare. He thinks of John’s face at Angelo’s last night, of the way the candle Angelo insisted on bringing over illuminated all the wrinkles John’s earned since the very first time they sat with a candle there so long ago. He thinks of the way John looked just a moment ago, standing in the doorway staring at Sherlock like he’s never seen him before. He feels his heartbeat speed up and he is filled with a flush of love and longing that takes him by surprise, that he can’t misunderstand, that he wants to cling to even though it’s painful.
“Sherlock,” he says placatingly, eyes widening when he sees that Sherlock is so upset. “I didn’t mean to – I’m sure Uncle Augustus can fix it –”
He stops abruptly and closes his eyes, forcing himself to take as deep a breath as he can, though his chest tightens and his breath stutters halfway through his inhale. Mycroft’s right; he knows he’s of no use to Sherlock like this, but he doesn't even know if Sherlock’s
“We do?” Sherlock asks. He’s very excited because he’s never celebrated a victory before, and certainly not in the company of someone else his very own age who smiles at him and laughs with him, and he finds himself drawn to John, eager to hear every word that comes out of his mouth.
“That’s not allowed,” Sherlock says. “The things you think you want to know are exactly the things the fortuneteller can’t tell you. It would alter the path you’re destined to take. It’s what’s so dangerous about people like the first fortuneteller, pretending to be able to do things they’re not. Not to mention, it’s disrespectful of them, acting like they can do something someone else takes so seriously when they’re doing nothing but harm.”
It’s a rather large closet, and on the left side are countless suits, hanging neatly on their hangers, but on the right is another door.
A furry, snakelike creature tumbles out, with a tiny face like a fox on one end. It has small pointed ears and a little pointed nose, and it curls into John’s hand and cranes its neck to look up at him, then surges forward, slithering up his arm and making John twitch until it gets to his shirt collar, where it winds its tail inside for leverage and then cranes its head to look John in the eye.
Sherlock relaxes further against John, his stomach fluttering, his mind quiet, his veins thrumming with John, his heart pounding.
They’re quiet for a moment, and John feels a strange connection with the man after the serious topics they’ve strayed to. He hesitates, but slowly starts talking. “I know what it’s like to be lonely,” he says. “We all do, don’t we? Coming back to...to this.”
John kisses just below Sherlock’s ear, tasting the skin there, gasping when Sherlock shifts beneath him, spreading his legs, making John settle between them. Sherlock hooks one leg around John’s, his heel pressing behind John’s kneecap, and John groans when the movement presses their cocks together. He goes back to Sherlock’s mouth and kisses him hard, both of them thrusting toward each other, friction building hot and delicious between them, though the movements are too shallow to be what they need.
His heart is still pounding and he’s still trembling, but he picks up his head and John cups his face, his thumbs sweeping over his cheekbones, wiping moisture away from his eyes that Sherlock hadn’t been aware of until that moment. John leans forward and kisses him tenderly, and Sherlock sighs into the kiss, shivering at the bitter taste of himself in John’s mouth.
When John is aware of himself again, Sherlock’s fingers are still circled around his wrists, and he almost chokes until Sherlock tightens his grip. John opens his eyes and realizes he’s underwater, staring across from himself at Sherlock, who is grinning as air bubbles drift out his nose.
“I think telekinesis counts as fancy,” John says. “It may not mean much coming from me, though. I can’t do anything.”
“It will open for you,” Sherlock says. He must be drunk, he knows, because surely there’s no other reason he’d do something like this. “All you have to say is
It’s too much at once – John tastes of rain and spaghetti, and the feel of someone else’s lips against his own is so unexpectedly wonderful, especially when it’s John – but he’s not sure he’s doing it right. John is motionless beneath him, he hasn’t moved, and so Sherlock thinks he must’ve made a mistake and his hands begin to shake more as his heart pounds, and just as he’s about to pull away, sure he’s ruined everything, he hears a clatter and realizes it’s John’s umbrella hitting the ground, and then one of John’s hands, steady and warm, is against his lower back, pulling him closer, and the other is winding into the wet curls on the back of Sherlock’s head, pulling him in.
He’s only bought beautiful plants this time, some of which he needs for potions, but some of which he just likes. He remembers when he was small, before he turned eleven and didn’t get a Hogwarts letter, before everyone knew the truth of his magic, how when it was just him, alone in his room, he’d play and decorate his room with magical flowers and lights, how he’d go outside and the magical creatures would come to him without prompting, how he had such an affinity for magic that even the creatures noticed and responded, how he loved magic more than anything. His heart aches, but it isn’t unpleasant.
John turns away and coughs wetly into his hand. He can’t stop coughing, and it comes faster and faster, so much that he can barely breathe. He gasps to get air, but his lungs feel constricted, and Arthur’s hand is hovering over his shoulder, ready to help, when someone else speaks, voice sharp with authority.
, but it feels as if he’s watching them happen to someone else from far away. He feels strange, as if his very being is slowly filling his body back up again. Though he’s travelled astrally before, he’s never done so while he’s awake, and returning to his body is a peculiar experience.
“John,” Sherlock says.  It sounds like a moan, like a prayer, like a plea.  “John, it’s – you –”  He can’t bring himself to talk so he picks up his head to look down at John.
“Yeah, to be honest, I had no idea he did archery until this morning,” John admits.  “It was a shock to see him wearing anything besides a suit or a dressing gown.  He’s got no in between, this one.”
“I think we’ll put him away for a little while,” Daddy says. “Besides, Uncle Augustus needs to fix him up, doesn't he? We’ll put him away until then.”
John’s heart twists in desperation. “Yes,” he chokes. “Yes, he is. Please, Zosima, I have to find him. Please help me.”
John sighs.  “I can hear you, you know,” he says.  “Mary said her mum used to make her a cupcake just like that when she was little.  She would’ve loved it.”
It stares back, of course, and John runs his hands over it, wondering whether or not it’s real, and then jumps when he hears a voice say, “Oi!”
“You should try anyway,” John says.  He rubs his leg along Sherlock’s again, slowly and deliberately this time.  “We can have another go when we wake up.”
“Not to mention, we can just add your rent to your work. It’s not a problem,” Sherlock says with a flippant wave of his hand.
. He reaches between them, and though it’s an awkward angle, he wraps a hand around Sherlock’s cock, moves it up and down, and bites gently on Sherlock’s nipple again as Sherlock groans, louder than before, his head tilting back.
“Have you filed that away under ‘appropriate responses to uncomfortable situations’ in your mind palace, then? Have you actually thought about how I must feel, about how I’ve been feeling-”
John is relieved to see a small smile form on Sherlock’s face. His eyes just barely crinkle, but it’s a start, and John can’t help but smile in return.
?” John asks, holding his own plate out when Sherlock holds up a second scoop of fried rice with an inquisitive head tilt.
“She hasn’t picked up her paper or her post today,” Sherlock points out.  “Maybe she’s even gone away for the weekend.”
Sherlock smiles at him but says nothing, and the smile doesn’t reach his eyes. John feels unaccountably nervous.
Sherlock’s heart floods with warmth and he reaches out and hugs John, holding him close. John hugs him back tightly and they stay there beside the tree, the fairy lights casting soft patterns on their skin, clutching each other with their small hands, until finally, they pull apart.
Sherlock’s world shrinks to the feeling of John’s mouth on his, to the feeling of John’s hands cupping his head, to the feeling of John’s mouth parting against his. He feels as if he’s in a haze, and he eagerly opens his mouth to John’s. The silky smooth feel of John’s tongue is heavenly when it slides against his own and he sighs into the kiss, pressing closer to John. He lets his hands settle on John’s waist and then shifts closer still, eager to feel more of John against him.
“Your clothes will be fine,” Sherlock says dismissively. “This isn’t regular water. It dries quite quickly and leaves very little evidence of its presence. But we have two things to accomplish here. I believe one is accomplished already.”
“Christ, look at you,” John says.  He sounds awed, impressed, and he’s still running his hands up and down Sherlock’s sides, leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake.
Sherlock pulls away after a moment, but he doesn’t go far; he keeps their faces close together, so close John can feel his breath, warm against his own lips.
“She respects a lot more about you,” Billy’s muffled voice says from inside the tote bag. John snickers.
know all about going to the kitchen,” Sherlock says. He reaches out and smacks Mycroft’s stomach and then twists out of his arms when Mycroft instinctually flinches back. Giggling all the while, Sherlock runs down the hallway, narrowly missing a collision with one of the decorators Mummy hired, who is carrying some last minute baubles up to the main party room.
He doesn’t know where these reassurances are coming from, but they seem like the right thing to say, and he takes a deep breath before taking the final step out of the forest, squinting against the bright light of day. His head is pounding and the sun doesn’t help, so he takes a moment to let his eyes adjust before he looks around.
“No,” John says, unsure why they’re talking about Mary, but glad not to be thinking of his dead patient. “She mostly does billing and scheduling over the phone and stays behind the window at her desk.”
.” Moriarty pauses, drumming his fingers along the arm of his chair as he stares at John with a small, smug smile. “Have you liked this little game so far? I can’t imagine why Sherlock has been so obsessed with you for so long, but it
, and in turn, fully believe in himself. The advance of the spirits stops almost as suddenly as it began, and he can feel them focusing on him, connected to him once more, prepared to listen to him now that they see the command he has over his strength.
“Yeah, don’t know why.  That lazy git didn’t even do anything, and he’s acting all annoyed with me for taking so long,” John says.
John shakes his head, his cheeks flushed with fever. “It doesn’t matter,” he says. “He’s a good man, you don’t understand.”
He squeezes his eyes shut and ignores the way his hands shake, ignores the fear clawing at him, and stands. He makes his way to the bathroom on shaky legs and washes his hands thoroughly, then changes into jeans and a jumper. Redbeard is making frantic sounds, and he’s slithered along the floor to wind up the leg of John’s trousers. He’s made it all the way to his belt before John takes hold of him with a shaky hand. He holds him carefully and ignores his squirming, and takes him downstairs and deposits him on the mantle.
John frowns in thought.  Sherlock is uncharacteristically serious, and he’s not sure how to take this.  John’s angry, yes, but something about the way Sherlock is looking at him makes him pause for a moment; for the first time since he’s known him, he sees Sherlock as vulnerable, and he’s not sure how to process this.
John rubs his forehead, trying to keep track of all of this and having difficulty. “How? I don’t even have a weapon,” he finally says.
The sight of him is too much and Sherlock lets his head fall back again, closes his eyes, focuses on the feeling of John around him. John wraps his hand around the base of his cock, and works it up and down as he bobs his head.
, and so he doesn’t use any more magic after that. He brings him inside and notices the way Sherlock is tugging at his hair, groaning, and he brings him into the bathroom and rinses the Sleakeazy away with gentle, warm water. It feels good and Sherlock likes the way the towel feels against his hair instead of the staticky sharp prickle of a drying spell.
“Are you wearing a suit to the park?” John asks, his brow furrowed as he takes in Sherlock’s attire.
They’re giggling as they go home, laughing over silly things in a way that Sherlock never dreamed he’d do in his lifetime; that was always something
John sighs. “It’s a little early for this,” he complains. He looks at the phone again, then turns to Sherlock and tilts his head with a furrowed brow, narrowing his eyes and trying to assess whether or not Sherlock is playing a trick on him. “Sherlock, that phone’s not plugged into anything.”
“Take it easy, I’m not trying to take the piss or anything,” John says, taking a sip of his tea. “I’m just curious.”
Sherlock blinks in surprise. “Yes,” he says, still feeling uncertain, but feeling something unfamiliar blossom inside of him. “They are.”
“No,” John says, though he’s not sure if he’s being entirely truthful. “But I don’t get it, to be honest. Maybe there’s something I’m missing, something about her, but she’s never – I don’t understand why he and Mycroft are so put off by her. It seems like she’s a bit…I don’t know, misunderstood.”
He knows he has time; John will be in the bathroom at least four minutes longer. He’s risking a lot here because she could (and probably will) cry when he picks her up, but John will believe she just woke and started crying with no prompting because there’s no reason not to think that.
Sherlock comes down the hallway then, finally dressed and ready to go, buttoning his suit jacket as he walks.
And then Sherlock’s face screws up and it’s all rushing at him – torture, isolation, fear, worry, death, murder, Mary – and something opens inside of him, something terrifying. He feels like he’s been shot all over again.
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “Yes, of course,” he says. “More important than studying for geography tests.”
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, and his face is closed off.  He’s watching John with a sort of apprehension John doesn’t like.
Slowly, softly, his hand drifts up from where it lies around John’s waist.  His fingers just barely touch John’s skin; he doesn’t want to wake him, but he can’t resist the temptation to touch.  He never can.  In fact, he covets the feel of John’s skin against his fingers so much that he wants to close his eyes and put this moment in his mind palace, but then he’d miss the way the light peaks just-so against John’s nipple, so he resists.
“There’s no need,” Sherlock replies. “Anyway, John, I won’t have mobile service, but if I need you, I’ll call the landline.”
It had been wonderful, really, examining the crime scene. Sherlock had seemed to think out loud more than usual, explaining things to John more frequently than he’d done before. He’d seemed surprised and pleased every time John replied.
Arthur stands, looking at John in concern. He makes his way to John and carefully takes his arm, leading him to the bench.
“No, not as such,” the man says. “But I’m most certainly a stranger, aren’t I? After all, you don’t even know my name.”
John is silent for a moment, and the only sound is the crackling over the line. He covers his eyes with his hand and feels Redbeard press a kiss against his hot, feverish neck. “He told me that, too,” John admits, feeling a wrench in his gut upon saying it out loud. His voice is more constricted than he’d like to admit, and his eyes burn, though it could be from fever. “He said I should stay home and rest.”
Suddenly, cars are coming fast, turning onto the street and unable to see the crosswalk, and without warning, John covers his mouth with his hands and watches as the inevitable happens. A truck comes fast around the corner, slams on its brakes, but can’t avoid the man. Phil Anderson gets hit, and the ring flies out of his hand in an arc, hitting the pavement with an innocent little ding not far from John’s feet. His hand shaking, he picks it up and puts it in his pocket.
“Oh, er, hello,” the customer says just as Mrs. Hudson closes the door to the kitchen partway, leaving it open just enough that they can see through into the living room.
, I – I’m not – I –” He stops, shakes his head, closes his eyes for a moment, reopens them. John is still there. “Please,” he adds, though he’s not sure what he’s asking for. There is something that feels like a rock in his stomach, churning unpleasantly. He forces himself to keep speaking. “I – I missed you. Very much. Please.”
The feeling of Sherlock beneath him is divine, unlike anything he could ever imagine. Sherlock moans and John thrusts against him, hot desire rolling over him in waves. He trails kisses along Sherlock’s jaw, eager to taste him, and stops at his ear, nipping the lobe. He twists his hips forward helplessly when Sherlock moans and tilts his head to give John access to his neck.
on the door. It sends a tingly shiver down his spine, feeling John’s magic trickle through his wards, and his palms grow sweaty.
Sherlock’s breath is coming faster, and then John’s tongue slides past his lips, warm and insistent, and Sherlock feels it at the very base of his spine. He doesn’t mean to, but a low sound slips from his throat, a moan that makes John’s tongue more insistent, makes his lips move faster and harder.   Sherlock feels like he’s coming unraveled; this is like nothing he’s ever felt before, and he needs
“No,” Sherlock replies. “But you’d been sleeping for two days before you woke up earlier and you still have dried blood around your nose; I thought you might want one.”
“You made your choice, John, but you’ll need to make another one soon,” Sherlock says after a moment.
Sherlock staggers beside John, holding the blankets as tightly around himself as he can, allowing John to help him walk the short distance to the hallway. “You’re not using a cane,” he manages, ignoring the pain in his head.
John nods, though he knows Billy can’t see it.  His skin feels prickly, and every time he tries to focus on the woman from the park, he’s overwhelmed by the dark energy surrounding him.  He swallows, his throat constricting.  Goose pimples are breaking out over his skin, and terrible memories are coming at him unbidden.  He sees guns, hears bombs, feels a bullet tearing through his shoulder –
By the time the day is over, John is rushing out, eager to leave work and stop endangering everyone around him with the spirit that’s attached itself to him. This one is different than most; it seems particularly malicious, making him colder and more nauseous than most spirits, and yet it hasn’t made any move to hurt him. It’s terrifying, really, and he feels frantic to get back to Baker Street.
“Take my waist,” John murmurs. Sherlock has never heard this soft, warm, lush tone of voice before, and he is entranced. His hands move before he can even realize what they’re doing, and suddenly they are resting on John’s waist, and Sherlock’s eyes flicker away from John’s for a moment down to where his hands rest, and he takes in the sight of his large hands on John’s compact waist and he swallows hard, feels his breath quicken, and looks back at John’s face with wide eyes, unsure.
“Here, Love, I’ve made you a cuppa,” Mrs. Hudson says. John lifts his head and squints up at her. He gratefully takes the cup from her, wrapping his hands around its warmth and breathing in the comforting steam.
John shrugs, eyes somewhere to the side of Sherlock rather than on him. He hesitates. “You didn’t dance, did you? At my wedding.”
Sherlock chuckles and exchanges a glance with the skull. “I suppose you could call it that. Anyway, John, shouldn’t you get to the shops? Why don’t you take Billy with you?”
“Right, archenemy,” John says, not curious enough to stick around this man.  “Have a nice day, then,” he adds, looking pointedly at the man before walking past him.  The man, however, follows him.
“Oh, you’ve made a bench?” John says cheerfully, heading over. Sherlock follows behind, feeling a bit dazed, and sits beside him.
With his thoughts as disjointed as they are, he can’t keep track of them. He doesn’t realize he’s holding his breath until he suddenly exhales fast and hard, his posture breaking, and he drops his head almost unwillingly against John’s.
“Don’t worry, you don't have to hide it from me,” Angelo insists with a waggle of his eyebrows.  His big, bushy tail twitches behind him.  Sherlock says nothing, and John’s shoulders slump in resignation.
when John pulls away, a sound he doesn’t recognize, and John strokes his lower lip with his thumb again, shushes him, presses a soft kiss against the corner of his mouth that makes Sherlock want to cry.
Mary waves her hand flippantly. “You’re a veteran, too, John, and you like helping people. It’s not that surprising,” she says. “But why was he outside your flat?”
“Then what do you mean, there’s no sense in explaining where we’re going?” John asks. When no answer is forthcoming, he continues. “I don’t have the patience for this right now; it’s been an absolute rubbish day from the moment I saw that stupid head in the fridge until now.”
“You’re not gross,” he murmurs to it, feeling a few tears leak from the corner of his eye.  “It must’ve been awful being alone for so long.”
She smiles at Sherlock, tucking a strand of blond hair behind her ear. “Will you be getting a reading, too?” she asks.
“See you, then,” she says, giving a small smile and a wave before turning and going in the other direction.
“Relax,” John murmurs.  His mouth is so close to Sherlock’s cock that Sherlock can feel the hot air of his words against his skin and he shivers.
He nods, determined, and carefully reaches towards the crib. Iris watches him in the same blinky way she watches everything, and he pauses for a moment, bent over her little form, and swallows. This is the closest point from which he has viewed her, and carefully,
Sherlock watches as John spreads the lube over his cock, his own cock hard and leaking against his stomach.  He groans in anticipation, his stomach fluttering.  He lets his legs relax so John can move and he wraps them high around John’s waist as soon as he can, and John leans down to kiss him, slowly, and Sherlock reaches for him desperately, eager to touch him, to feel him.
Once they’ve had breakfast and showered, Sherlock tries again. “Come on, John, we’re going to see a fortuneteller,” he says.
He could take a taxi, he knows, but he doesn’t feel like it. Somehow, the rain feels fitting, and he pushes through, almost back to the flat. When he finally gets there, he shakes his umbrella off and heads in. The only part of his body that isn’t soaked is his hair, which has been sheltered enough by his umbrella to avoid the sideways rain coming down in sheets.
John tilts his head until he finds Sherlock’s mouth again. He kisses him, slow and soft and gentle, a different kiss than the ones they’ve already shared. Sherlock slides his hand up the back of John’s shirt again and John shifts closer to Sherlock, rubs his thumb over Sherlock’s nipple again, feels Sherlock gasp open-mouthed into their kiss, and he breaks away, breathing heavily.
“Oh? How so?” John asks. He looks intrigued, and while he still doesn’t seem malicious, Sherlock knows how quickly people can turn, so he feels very little hope from his attitude.
A while later, Sherlock is showered and dressed, and John is in the sitting room, reading the paper but obviously not taking anything in. Sherlock’s eyes flicker over him and he draws in a sharp breath, about to speak, when John looks at him.
Sherlock looks down, flustered. “I don’t… you must have been so shocked that you didn’t hear me,” he says.
“Don’t be an idiot,” Sherlock says. “I’m not testing it on anyone. There are other ways to test antidotes, which you’d know if you’d paid attention in potions.”
John doesn’t want to take his eyes off of Moriarty, not for a second, but he needs to see Sherlock. He stares at him, and suddenly Moriarty claps, the sound so loud that John jumps, his heart speeding up. Sherlock’s head jerks upward at the sound and he looks around in confusion for a moment before he sees John. His eyes widen and immediately settle on him, and John’s heart speeds up in a mixture of relief and fear. Sherlock looks shocked to see him there.
it’s John, and Sherlock has been so intent on keeping himself together he’s failed to notice the clues of his presence, something which unsettles him more than he’d like. Another mistake. He swallows and holds himself still for a fraction of a second and then turns to John, who’s sitting in his chair. Sherlock melts into a familiar position of confidence, hoping he doesn’t seem surprised to see John.
A different sort of discomfort settles over him when he remembers that John is there, that John has witnessed all of this. “John?” he whispers, voice harsh.
Sherlock moans helplessly and his hips jerk upward when a second finger joins the first and they unerringly find his prostate.  Sparks shoot up his spine and he bites his lip helplessly.  “John, I can’t – you need to –”  His voice is rough and he’s desperate for friction, desperate for John to be inside him, desperate for release.  His entire body is wound tight and he’s trembling, shaking with need.
Sherlock makes a noncommittal hum of agreement as he watches John pour, and his hands tight around the urn, keeping it in place.
John sighs and hangs his umbrella over the door handle, the water dripping down onto the floor. “Can’t you deduce it?” he asks, an air of defeat clinging to his words. He goes over to his chair and sits heavily, looking up at Sherlock and resting his chin on his hand.
“Took you long enough,” Sherlock says, but he sits up upon seeing the skull in John’s hands. “Ah, Billy!”
His heart begins to beat faster when he sees that a door has appeared in front of him.  It’s a plain, white door, and he can’t help but stand still and stare, relief flooding him even though he’s unsure of what lies beyond the door.
“You’re worried about a woman, too, one you seem to think is wonderful,” she continues. “But stop trying to figure out your future. Just let what’s meant to happen happen. And then, of course, you have a new friend. A man. One you fight with quite a bit, don’t you? But your relationship will only grow from this point on.”
Sherlock looks up and sniffs at his Uncle Augustus, picking up the pieces of his nutcracker and holding them out. “Mycroft broke it,” he says. He pretends his voice isn’t trembling.
“Yes,” Sherlock murmurs. It’s barely a whisper; he doesn’t think he can handle more. John kisses him again, soft and sweet, his lips opening against Sherlock’s, and Sherlock parts his own lips eagerly, welcoming the buzz that builds in his stomach and under his skin.
“I’m fine,” she says without turning to look at him, and she leaves, closing the door fast behind her. He can hear the muffled sounds of crying through the door.
me; he’s too arrogant to realize he’d have to. If he’s alive, then he can manipulate the terms as much as he desires, but upon his death, that clause disappears. Without your wish, I’d have no way to return, but your wish allows it. So, John, fight Moriarty. Kill him.”
“You need to calm down if you want to help him,” Mycroft says with infuriating steadiness. “Let’s go upstairs and I’ll explain.”
“What was your first magic?” Sherlock clumsily asks after a moment, suddenly deeply curious but finding that his words are having trouble traveling from his mind to his mouth. “I mean, accidental.”
Sherlock doesn’t know how John can be thinking of wine right now. He waves a hand in the air distractedly. “Yes. Fine. Sure.”
Mrs. Hudson beams. “Always so kind, John! You’re just what we needed around here! But no, thanks, I’m just fine.” She turns from him and heads up the stairs, and John watches her go for a moment before leaving the flat, a puzzled frown on his face.
“John,” Sherlock says, but his voice is foreign, strange, wrenched from deep inside of him, rough with the emotion he’s tried so hard to stop. His hands are beginning to shake now, and his breath is getting fast. He’s rooted in place; he can’t move, can’t do anything except think of
It’s just a chaste brush of dry lips, quiet and soft but warm and perfect. It’s gentle, but Sherlock feels it down to his bones. He remains still, processing, and John pulls away and watches while Sherlock sits frozen with closed eyes. After a moment, Sherlock’s eyes fly open and he stares at John, searching, something wild in his expression, and John smiles. “Alright?” he asks, his voice a bit rougher than usual, anxiety in his expression he’s trying hard to mask.
“No,” John says. He pauses outside the blank stretch of wall. “You did a perfect job,” he says warmly, and a flush of something pleasant manages to work its way through Sherlock, though he still feels weak and horrible, but it’s worth it, he thinks, just for that moment. John then casts
“You two better hurry up if you don’t want to be left behind,” it tells them, glancing down at them and then flying quickly to catch up with the pack.
“Oh, a butterfly,” Sherlock says. He sounds pleased and he takes the disc from John, tucking it back into his jacket. “That means we’re close. Otherwise, it would have been a bird.”
There are so many strange things happening in this conversation that John doesn’t even have time to dwell on them. Instead, he focuses on the question asked directly of him. “I don’t have a wish,” he says.
“He won it in a bet,” Sherlock says sourly. “Also, he said I couldn’t take care of it properly. He was just jealous,” he adds with a scowl.
on purpose?” Sherlock asks, so testily that John can’t help but wonder at the fact that he very clearly
“I had Redbeard,” Sherlock says with a shrug. Redbeard peeks his head up from John’s wrist, glancing towards Sherlock, who reaches out and gently scratches him underneath his tiny chin, his fingers intimately, tantalizingly close to John’s neck for just a moment until they retreat. John fights the urge to lean into them.
“Er, right, not a spirit then,” John says.  He glares at Sherlock.  “Thanks a lot, mate,” he adds.  “Some kind of demon, then?”  He’s half joking, just making a comment on the man’s personality, but Sherlock nods.
“Right,” John says. He clears his throat, squeezes Sherlock’s shoulders. He doesn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes, just gives him a quick once-over, as if to reassure himself that Sherlock is there and whole and safe. He gives Sherlock’s shoulders an awkward pat and then lets his hands fall inelegantly by his side. “You – you’ve nothing to say, then?” John asks. He’s hesitant, unsure, and Sherlock doesn’t know how to respond.
To his surprise, the flowers at the bottom are red.  “I’ve never seen a red hydrangea,” he muses, glancing up at Sherlock.
Sherlock takes the parcel and sets it down, opening it by hand rather than magic since he has guests.
, he knows it. The cut on his cheek is still bleeding, and he feels another on his leg, just above his knee. The blood is soaking into his trousers, but he doesn’t mind. He doesn’t even know if the spirits will help him when they leave the forest, but he knows he’s doing all he can, and that’s enough for now.
And now, Sherlock is standing on the tarmac with John. It’s silent, a stark contrast to the chaos of Appledore, and yet his entire being is on the same level of chaos it had been then. His mind palace is in ruins, swarmed by endless inner battles. The rooms and corridors and wings filled with John are threatening to crumble. He keeps his exterior calm and disconnects from the core of emotion inside of him. It’s what he has to do; he must protect John.
“Right, obviously,” he says, eyes crinkling in the corners. “And why did we come here? Don’t get me wrong; I’m happy to ruin my clothes in a pond, but I
“Sherlock,” John says when he steps inside, a touch of awe in his voice. “Sherlock, this is beautiful.”
John’s tongue is relentless, flicking against her clit, swirling around it, never ceasing in its warmth and pressure and all too soon, Sherlock feels a tension in her legs she knows means that she’s close, feels her back start to arch of its own accord, feels a tingling wash over her. “John,” she says, her words practically a sob, and then the pleasure is too much and her hands clench in her hair and she throws her head back, her back arching up off the bed, her cunt tightening and pulsing as pleasure washes over her. John is moaning against her, not stopping, licking her through the orgasm and then just as Sherlock’s body starts to calm, John pulls her mouth away and replaces it with her thumb, pressing just below her clit, making the orgasm wash over her once more until Sherlock is a heaving mess on the bed, trying desperately to catch her breath, her head spinning, her eyes squeezed tightly closed, stars blooming behind her eyelids, her clit pulsing in the aftershocks of her orgasm.
Iris is crying and she won’t stop. She’s eaten, her diaper is fresh, she’s had a nap, and she has no signs of illness. John is bouncing her up and down and cooing endearments in her ears and rubbing her back, but nothing is helping. Sherlock is watching uncomfortably; he doesn’t know how to help or if he
Before he knows it, though, there’s a shadow looming over him, and Sherlock opens his eyes to see John standing over him. “Come on,” John says, holding out his hand, smiling.
. The word irks him, the connotations irk him. Mrs. Hudson is a Squib, but she’s smarter and more capable than any witch or wizard he’s ever met, he thinks. “You’re right,” Sherlock says, though he still feels defensive in a way he doesn’t understand. “I’m not a
Sherlock swallows hard.  John’s lips are swollen and shiny with spit, and Sherlock feels a jolt deep in his stomach at the sight.  “John,” he says.  He feels like he’s begging, and he doesn’t understand what for.
“Clearly not,” Sherlock says with a small smile. Carefully, he sits up, swinging his legs down beside John’s form on the floor.
John kisses him and Sherlock curls his leg around John’s waist again.  John reaches for the lube, still within arm’s reach from the night before, and breaks the kiss to get some on his fingers.  He giggles when half of his squirt lands on the bed sheets, and Sherlock can’t help but join, and then John is collapsed on his chest, giggling and giggling, and Sherlock is laughing with him, tears coming to his eyes, his chest shaking, his arms automatically curling around John’s back.
It’s a while before Sherlock comes back in, and John’s almost drifted off to sleep, but he blinks blearily at Sherlock’s form when he sits on the bed, close enough to John that John can feel the heat of his body. John smiles at him. He’s unspeakably glad to see him.
John sighs. He lets go of his shoulder in favor of rubbing his hand over his face in exhaustion. “Right,” he says, voice flat, his hand cupping his chin as he watches Sherlock. “And where is it that we
“I wished for you to live, John, and as a result, your power became much stronger because in order for my wish to come true, you
When they arrive at Baker Street, Sherlock hustles out of the cab, leaving John to pay. John’s not angry; in fact, it’s somewhat of a relief. He pays the cabbie and trails behind, walking slowly. Sherlock’s already in the apartment by the time John is starting up the stairs.
The man raises an eyebrow.  He doesn’t seem to appreciate John’s response.  “No,” he says.  “But you should.”
He’s seen John hold Iris many ways, more ways than even that, and yet he hasn’t yet held her. John has been back at Baker Street for two days now, and while they’re comfortable with each other, it’s not like it was before. They’re treading softly, carefully, and Sherlock doesn’t know how to change it. He wants to desperately, but every time he thinks about how he can possibly make John feel more at home, his heart starts pounding and he feels lost.
Mary laughs in agreement.  “He’s certainly a bit quirky, isn’t he?  But either way, he’s quite good,” she says.  “I don’t think he’s missed the exact center of the target once.”
“John,” Sherlock says sharply. “There are no coincidences in this world; the universe is rarely so lazy. There is only the inevitable.”
John turns to him, takes in his expression, and then looks straight ahead again. “You’re good at this,” he says.
“John, now that you’ve moved in, we should discuss a few things,” Sherlock says, sitting across from John at the kitchen table and sipping his tea.
John frowns, mulling over Sherlock’s words as they begin to walk again. He feels a bit foolish for having been taken in by the woman.
The music is soft and soothing. He hasn’t heard anything like it before, but it’s beautiful. He takes another sip of his tea, and then sets the cup on the table beside the couch.
and his new friend is in trouble. He looks around for a weapon, but sees nothing of use. Desperately, he stands, pulling his slipper off, and even though his heart is pounding in fear, he runs as fast as he can into the chaotic fight and throws it with all his might. It strikes the mouse king right in the chest and he falls over, then the nutcracker triumphantly finishes him off with his sword while the mutant mouse lets out an almighty screech and Sherlock can only stand beside the nutcracker and stare, his heart pounding.
“I’d love to,” John says whole-heartedly, his eyes locked with the little fox’s. The little fox’s face flushes once more, and to John’s surprise, he rushes forward and gives John a hug, which John barely returns with one arm before the fox-boy pulls away, looking shy again, his tail twitching.
“Then what’s the problem? She seems to like you just as much now as she did before, wouldn’t you say? Only now, you have nothing to hide from her,” Sherlock says. He’s not looking at John; he’s looking up at the sky. It’s dark by now, and the crescent moon is peeking out from behind a cloud. “It’s quite nice out tonight, isn’t it?”
Sherlock is left feeling hard and desperate and aching as John pulls away and he reaches out for him, pulling off his jumper, feeling a thrill that he’s allowed to do this. They kiss again as soon as the jumper is out of the way, but Sherlock doesn’t like that John is still wearing his undershirt and so he breaks away to pull it over John’s head. This time when they kiss Sherlock can’t help the breathy moan that escapes him at the feeling of John’s bare skin against his; it’s electrifying.
“That’s the only thing you’re going to comment on?” Sherlock asks, looking away from Redbeard for a moment to peer at John, one eyebrow raised.
,” he makes it say, and Mycroft swats at it in annoyance, but Sherlock’s grip isn’t tight and before he realizes what happens, the nutcracker is sliding out of his hands and his eyes widen and he gasps when it crashes to the floor. He looks up at Mycroft in angry dismay and then crouches down, feeling his lip tremble when he notices that its left arm is no longer attached to his body.
John wants to ask, but he knows that he is on edge and frazzled, out of his element and worried. “But he could be anywhere,” John protests. “I have to find him. I don’t have time to waste; he could be hurt –”
something and I could feel the magic in the air twist and pull in that direction. I thought it was how everyone experienced magic, but when I’d try to talk about it and no one knew what I was saying, I began to realize it wasn’t. The first time I went to Diagon Alley, it was – all the magic everywhere was too much for me. It
Sherlock swallows. “I – I can’t,” he says. His voice is softer than he’d expected, and there’s a tremor to it he’s unaccustomed to hearing.
Redbeard, though, doesn’t want to leave John’s hand. He squeaks and burrows into John’s sleeve, causing John to wrinkle his nose in discomfort and holds stock still as the little pipefox crawls up his bare arm; it’s a strange sensation, knowing the creature is inside his clothes, and the hair on the back of his neck stands up as Redbeard slithers along his bare skin, pressed close because of the constriction of his sleeve.
John just stares at her and his mouth drops open. He clenches and unclenches his hand at his side, his heart beating fast in his chest. “Mum?” he asks, confused. Why is he confused? He’s not sure, but his head is swimming. There’s something wrong with this, he thinks. He’s not supposed to see her.
to see only John). His heart speeds up a bit at the sight of her – there is just so much raw data to analyze and memorize and file away – but he takes his eyes away to look at John.
Sherlock shakes his head, his breath coming fast again, his hands beginning to tremble. “John, you – it’s all – always, don’t you -”
“Oi, come on, we’re going home,” John says. He sits up and swings his feet over the side of the bed, just as the nurse comes in.
“Come on, John, we’ve got to keep up. Remember, don’t let go of the handle,” Sherlock says, ignoring John’s statement, and tugging him along. John follows because he’s sure it would be much worse to be left alone than to go along with Sherlock, but his anger increases as they rush up the hill, quickly approaching the top. He’s silent until they’re almost there, and though he’s breathing a bit heavily, he can’t hold back any longer.
“Don’t be a git,” John murmurs, and his tone is so intimate that some of Sherlock’s anxiety melts away, and just like that, they’re kissing again, the atmosphere of the room changing abruptly. Sherlock has been craving this feeling since he felt it only hours ago, and it’s no less transcendent the second time around.
Dad picks him up and stands tall, then says something to Mummy. Sherlock clings to the folds of his robes, groans against the onslaught of magic all around him, doesn’t hear anything Dad’s saying.
And then, after an indeterminable amount of time that seems like seconds and hours and years all at once, the phone rings, and he can’t even begin to comprehend what it means when Mycroft says he’s going back.
he would ever make in his life but he can’t stop them, can’t stop this, can’t stop the spiral of pleasure starting at the base of his spine and spreading over his body and then his hips are jerking even though John’s trying to hold them down and his legs tremble and spasm and he’s coming, hard, into the wet heat of John’s mouth and John isn’t picking his head up, he’s not pulling away, and it makes Sherlock moan helplessly and thrust up into John’s mouth and come harder, his legs jerking out, his head thrown back, until finally,
The boy’s eyes light up and his tail twitches back and forth in excitement, and John smiles.  “Go on, then, you can have it.  It wasn’t even mine in the first place,” he says, holding it out to him.
“The same reasons anyone would,” Sherlock says. “Laters!” he calls, his appearance changing from deadly serious to facetious in the blink of an eye, and then, before John can even process the morning or the strange sendoff, Sherlock and Billy are gone, and John is alone.
“What?” John asks, confused. He’s having trouble keeping up with Sherlock’s line of conversation, but that’s nothing new, but he feels torn apart and raw, too, and uncomfortable under Sherlock’s close watch.
Mary, he’d stop it with all the nonsense he’s been spouting. John knows Mary has nothing to do with the spirit he’d met that day, he just
John sets to work, cleaning pots and pans and clearing off the countertops, pausing only to sip the tea Mrs. Hudson brings him. He studiously ignores Sherlock’s whinging from the living room.
John stands a moment later and looks at Sherlock. He hesitates for just a moment, then reaches out and squeezes Sherlock’s shoulder. “See you in a bit, yeah?”
Suddenly, the handkerchief twists and rises of its own accord, taking on the shape of a butterfly, and John stands hurriedly, still holding the disc.
“This again?” Mycroft complains. “If you think I’m boring, that’s fine, but I’m getting an education and preparing to enter society. That’s
Just as he’s taking a step over the threshold, Sherlock speaks. “John Hamish Watson,” he says, voice low and silky.
Sherlock had wanted to say as the world spun around them, somehow moving forward while the two of them remained locked in one moment that seemed as if it would never end.
The fortuneteller smiles. “Don’t worry,” she says. “It will be fine. As long as you have courage, you’ll be able to face anything that comes your way.”
” Sherlock shudders, and when John starts sliding his fingers up and down the back of his head again, he mirrors the movement with his hand, slow and torturous, his breath shaky. When John plays with the curls on the crown of his head, Sherlock swipes his thumb over the head of his cock, moaning as the moisture spreads, his hips bucking up of their own volition as his knees spread open.
Greg takes a seat on a small raised area of the roof, his shoulders hunched in a little bit because of the cold, and grins up at John. “Now that you’ve decided not to fight me, why don’t we sit and I’ll tell you?” he says. He gestures for John to sit near him, so John goes, a half smile on his face. He sits, but leaves a safe distance between them.
“John,” Sherlock finally interrupts. John’s eyes flicker from where they were trained on Iris’ face up to Sherlock’s. Sherlock is holding her expertly, feeding her a bottle in his armchair. “I highly doubt that in the thirty minutes it takes you to go to Tesco, Iris will suddenly develop a fever, and if she does, I'm quite sure you’ll be home in time to take care of it.”
“Greg Lestrade,” he says. “But if you mention me to Sherlock, don’t call me Greg. Bastard can never remember my first name.”
John treads water and looks over at Sherlock, whose hair is flat against his head and dripping down his sharp cheekbones. He can’t help but giggle, the absurdity of the situation overwhelming him. Arriving in a pond full of suspended crystals staring at a madman is absurd enough; looking at said madman with his sopping wet hair plastered on his head and dripping down his equally absurd cheekbones is icing on the cake, and it’s almost too much for John to process.
“My apologies,” Mycroft says stiffly, giving a slight nod of his head in deference, though his raised eyebrows suggest he’s not sincere.
Sherlock nods. “Exactly. You manipulated the connection. Find Moriarty. I think you’re close; I can’t be sure, but if you’ve connected to me astrally this early in your exploration of the connection, our physical bodies must not be far from each other. Where are you?”
There’s no answer, but suddenly he trips over a piece of wood sticking out of one of the shelves, and just as he’s about to lose his footing, something falls from the top shelf. Instinctively, he catches it in his hands as he manages to regain his footing, and he almost drops it again when he realizes it’s a human skull.
It feels good to talk about this, John realizes, to give voice to thoughts he’s had but had been unwilling to admit to. He’s been so caught up in his life with Sherlock that the problems he’d faced upon his return to England had seemed fuzzy, a distant memory he didn’t need to revisit. But now, in Sherlock’s absence, it’s easy to remember them in startling clarity, and it’s
He goes up to the door and opens it fearlessly, entering with a straight back as if he owns the building. John shakes his head and follows.
“You’re welcome,” Uncle Augustus says, patting him on the head. Sherlock barely pays attention when Uncle Augustus tells Mycroft it’s his turn, but he looks up when Mycroft opens his box and says, “Ah. Thank you,” in a tone that makes Sherlock want to shove him. Sherlock looks away from his nutcracker long enough to see that there are little toy soldiers inside Mycroft’s box, little wooden ones that Uncle Augustus clearly made.
“Mrs. Hudson,” John breathes, his head swiveling to look at her as he remembers shaking her frantically, trying to wake her. “You’re alive.”
“You can’t just order me around,” John says, annoyed. And then, a moment later, he groans. “I’m talking to a skull,” he says.
The sound of the harp seems distant, and he’s barely aware of the cottage. The only thing he can think of is Sherlock. He imagines the warm twist of pleasure he feels when Sherlock is nearby. He imagines it so clearly that he feels it now, a fluttering in his stomach and twisting in his chest. He imagines the feel of Sherlock’s hand in his, his fingers long and reassuring. He imagines standing in front of Sherlock, so close that their breath mingles in the space between them, and he imagines reaching up, cupping Sherlock’s face, feeling Sherlock’s curls slide between his fingers. He imagines the way his breathing would quicken, the way his pulse would speed up. He imagines the way his breath would hitch, the way he would tilt his head. He longs for it so badly that he feels like his body’s on fire. He imagines leaning closer, shifting his hand to Sherlock’s neck, sliding it through his curls until he can take him by the back of his neck and pull his head down to meet his.
John stops himself before his emotions get the better of him more than they already have. He takes a deep breath again and closes his eyes, focusing on the feel of Redbeard against his neck. After a moment, he opens his eyes again, though he still feels dangerously on edge. He clears his throat. “Right. Okay. How can I find him if I don’t leave?” John’s speaks in a low, measured tone.
She shakes her head. “It’s only a few minutes, but it feels different in there,” she tells him. “It’s…it’s horrible, really.” She shivers, and John feels his worry grow stronger again.
lost a significant male family member at some point in their lives. Considering that you’re an adult, ‘early in your life’ is quite vague, too, isn’t it? And
He walks back to where Sherlock and Billy are sitting, looking up at the clear sky as he goes, but then stops short when he glances ahead and sees Sherlock licking chocolate frosting off his thumb.
Sherlock looks at him inscrutably and nods, slowly. “Yes,” he says. “In fact, she’s here, just outside the door. Would you like to speak to her?”
John leans forward and gently, reverently, he lets his lips press against Sherlock’s. It’s quiet in the flat, and John lets the familiar quietness wash over him for a moment as the new feeling of Sherlock’s lips against his own sinks into him, somehow earth-shaking in its intensity even though it’s just a gentle press of lips. He feels something deep in his stomach twist, feels his heart flutter in his chest. He relishes the feeling of Sherlock’s curls beneath his fingers, feels his own ribs expand beneath the warmth of Sherlock’s palm. Their lips open to each other, warm air shared between them, the soft sounds of their breaths and mouths weaving into the atmosphere of the flat. John shifts closer until their chests are flush against each other, the taste of Sherlock’s lips heady and sublime and
Sherlock is trembling and he needs John, needs to be near him. He lets go of John’s hands and he pushes against the arm rests of the chair and moves forward until he’s sliding off the chair entirely, sliding down to the floor, reaching for John, burying his face in John’s neck, clinging to him, still trembling, still breathing hard.
Greg shrugs and turns his head, giving John a half-smile that seems too omniscient for John’s liking. “They may come in handy,” he says.
And then John’s tongue traces Sherlock’s lip, and Sherlock trembles, his own tongue sliding forward to meet John’s. He’s kissed before, of course he has, but it’s never been like this; it’s never reached into the very foundations of his being and pulled feelings and emotions out of him he’s never thought he could feel, it’s never invaded his mind palace, it’s never soothed the overwhelming flood of emotions he doesn’t know how to control.
all the things he’s trying so hard to push away. His skin is on fire, his insides are on fire; he can’t handle this.
Sherlock doesn’t reply, just pulls his sheet tight around him. He thinks about the night before, then opens his eyes wide when he remembers that he’d let John into the wards of his room. He can’t help but stare at John’s back as he makes tea, thinking back. He feels his face heat when he remembers the things he’d said to John, the way he’d acted. He folds his arms on the table and rests his forehead on them, squeezing his eyes closed.
He stares in the direction of Sherlock’s closet for a while, thinks of the bread waiting to be toasted in the kitchen, shakes his head, and goes back to eat breakfast. He definitely isn’t awake enough for this.
“Okay,” John says, reaching out and taking Sherlock’s hand in his. Sherlock squeezes it for a moment and John squeezes back. Sherlock steps onto a large, flat rock next to the pond, and tugs John’s hand until John joins him.
“I’ll take you to a real fortuneteller,” Sherlock says. He suddenly turns and goes down a side street, then crouches down where no one will see him.
Again, he stops. He’s bad at this, at talking about emotions, but he can see that Sherlock’s in need,
Sherlock shrugs. “She tried to, and she arguably succeeded in her own way, but the results weren’t what we expected them to be.”
He lays a gentle hand on her shoulder.  “It doesn’t seem very nice over there,” he says gesturing towards the green and black area.  “Let’s go a different way, alright?”  He can’t muster a smile for her.  He feels tired and weary.  His heart is no longer pounding; he’s no longer sweating.
Sherlock places a hesitant hand on John’s back, and John takes a shuddering breath, leaning into the touch.
Sherlock glances at him and tilts his head, blinking a bit. “You didn’t have a lot of friends growing up,” he says.
Sherlock shakes his head and squeezes his eyes closed. He feels overwhelmed, like someone is grabbing hold of his heart and twisting. He wants to stare at John, to take him in, to memorize this moment down to the very last hair on John’s head, but he finds that he can’t, that his throat is tightening, that his lip is twisting. John pulls him forward and holds him again, the same way as before, and he finds it easier to breathe, somehow, with his face pressed against John’s neck.
Mycroft looks at him for a moment, then turns to Sherlock.  “I thought he was intelligent, Sherlock.”
John shakes his head and swallows shakily. “No,” he says. It’s impossible, isn’t it? He saw Sherlock, after all, met him on the roof. On the
“Er, that girl today,” John begins as they walk, glancing at Sherlock to see if he’s receptive to the topic.  Sherlock makes no indication he’s even heard John speak, so John continues.  “That girl – where exactly was I?  It felt like just ten minutes; I can’t understand how eight hours went by.”
Mary smiles, but it doesn’t reach her eyes. “When you put it that way…” she says. She’s quiet for a moment and she hesitates, still standing in his doorway, but then she turns and follows him as he heads down the hall. “You’re in a good mood,” she says as she catches up with him.
John’s blearily pouring himself a cup of coffee and stifling a yawn, the early morning light of the kitchen window just bright enough to highlight how much the counters need a good cleaning, when Sherlock bustles out of his room. He’s dressed impeccably in a charcoal suit that almost seems sculpted to his body, and his hair is in perfect order, every curl in line. John’s eyebrows rise up on his forehead at Sherlock’s immaculate early morning fashion, and he can’t help but stare, coffee pot still in his hand and poised to pour.
John takes advantage of his distraction and deepens the kiss. He trails his fingers down Sherlock’s spine and back up again, basking in the way Sherlock’s breath hitches and his spine arches subtly. He sweeps his hand up Sherlock’s side again, Sherlock’s flesh and bones warm and real under his fingers, and lets his thumb rub over Sherlock’s nipple. Sherlock gasps and John presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth, then lets his thumb rub over the hard nub again, his other hand twisted into Sherlock’s hair, and he kisses beneath Sherlock’s ear with a hot open mouth.
Sure enough, by the time they leave, the sky is clear, and the moon is reflected in the puddles they walk through on their way out to the main road.
John sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face in frustration. “Then what is it? I mean, I’m sleeping right now, aren’t I?”
John lets out a surprised moan and tangles his fingers into Sherlock’s hair.  He breaks the kiss to rest his head against Sherlock’s neck, his breath hot and moist against Sherlock’s skin.  Sherlock loves it and he knows if he hadn’t just come, he would be hard already.
John drains his glass and reaches towards the lantern to carefully refill it. It’s a bit awkward to pour, but he makes do. “
Sherlock doesn’t play all weekend because he’s embarrassed to play in front of John, embarrassed to fumble around on the strings and fight with his violin for control. His violin felt so uncomfortable last time that he’s almost afraid to try again on Monday, but he remembers the warmth of the wood in his hands and the resonance of the strings, even with his clumsy technique, and so he reverently takes it out of its case. He closes his eyes and lets his fingers close around the neck for a moment, and imagines the effortless way in which he used to play.
When John gets to the landing and opens the door, Sherlock doesn’t move, a strange sort of apprehension coming over him because he knows that he may have to comfort John. He doesn’t know how.
John shakes his head. “Not really. I was never very good at keeping friends, and after all this with my leg, it was… it’s been a bit… rough the past few years. Wizarding society isn’t always all that accepting of people who don’t fit a certain mold.”
him, I don’t know why she was apologizing. She looked like she was practically in tears…it was a bit strange, actually,” he admits. “When he – you know. When he – when he
“It’s a fox spirit,” Sherlock says. “It has two forms; this one, and a much bigger one. The second form requires a lot of energy, so it’s best used for emergencies only.”
“I’m glad,” Sherlock manages, feeling as if he might collapse forward onto the couch, as if someone is hammering his forehead with an ice pick.
“I’m sure Sherlock explained to you that to many people, this building doesn’t exist,” Mycroft says, his tone more forceful than before in the face of John’s near-hysteria. “The selective nature of who sees this building and who doesn’t is due to Sherlock’s magic, which built this flat, and also sustains it. With his magic, Sherlock created both the building and everything inside it, including Mrs. Hudson and that ridiculous skull,” Mycroft says.
John lets go of his wrist, and Sherlock feels the absence of his touch like a punch in the face, like a fall to a restaurant floor. He swallows hard.
“That’s it,” John says, kissing him more, his hands moving up and down his back, threading into his hair. Sherlock feels lost to the sensations and when John’s lips trail kisses, warm and open-mouthed and wet, along his jaw and down his neck, he shivers, and then John reaches for the waistband of his pants and tugs, pulling them carefully over his cock, and their legs untangle for a moment and Sherlock kicks off his pants. He pulls eagerly at John’s, and between the two of them, they get John’s off, too, and then they immediately tangle together again and Sherlock squeezes his eyes closed, panting when he feels John’s cock press against his own with nothing separating them. The feeling is sublime; nothing he’s ever imagined has even come close to this, and he’s shaking, breathing fast, making sounds he’s sure he’s never made before.
“Take her a mo while I put the groceries away?” John asks, his fingers still dancing over Sherlock’s scalp. “I’ll make a bottle up for her, too.”
When the lantern is full, they’re both still giggling. “We shouldn’t be laughing here,” John whispers, their heads still close together, but that only makes Sherlock laugh more, and John can’t stop,
“Be careful,” Mrs. Hudson says, and she covers her mouth with a hand as he turns away, an emotion John doesn’t want to think about sliding over her features.
,” Sherlock says. His fingers are moving in slow circles on John’s hip and he’s thinking about what John’s cock would feel like in his mouth.  “Approximately how long is your refractory period?”
"No!" John's vocal cords strained to break the silence of his shock in that moment, because the very thought of Sherlock finishing that sentence, of actually taking those actions, destroyed him.
The shock and then misery that filled Gregory's warm eyes did not give Mycroft the vindication he thought his statement would. Mycroft couldn't stare into those eyes longer than a few seconds, and instead focused on staring at his folded hands resting on the desk.
“Just mine — My pretty Sherlock.” John moaned, the fingers of his left hand smearing the globs of cum at the bulb of his cock, his right moving so fast over his slickened shaft it was nearly a blur.
John looked back up and watched as Sherlock loosened his tie, popped open the first four buttons of his shirt and yanked the left collar away to reveal more untouched milky flesh. John’s mouth watered with the treasure open to his taking.
John’s body was jerked by the powerful wave of need as it overwhelmed him, it had been so long—his whole life on suppressants and suddenly stopping after their wedding, was bringing about his heat quickly now.
Today was no different. Mycroft reclined back in his leather chair at his desk, palming his shut mouth with his hand as he watched Gregory reading an open file placed in front of his own desk. The DI’s eyes were heavy with sleep, but he stubbornly blinked them with purpose, attempting to remain awake. Gregory spent another forty minutes reviewing the case file, jotting down notes and researching things in relation to it on his laptop before finally calling it a night and putting everything away.
Sherlock said nothing, but there was a tension is his shoulders John hadn’t noticed before, but John wasn’t going to fool himself. He wasn’t going to read too much into it, because it had nothing to do with him.
John's gut roiled, unsettled, and yet eager. He'd dreamt of this day. Always having longed to find an omega counterpart who would love him and care for him as strongly as he would them. Sherlock might not love him, but John had more than enough love for the both of them.
He shouldn't... He really knew it was meaningless in the long run, but seeing this settled much of the unease within.
"Sherlock." John gasped, apprehension written in his eyes outside of view of the camera, but there was no fear.
"Today then? Right... Give me an hour at least to set up things." Mycroft said rising from his seat and retrieving his cell phone to make some calls.
“You know.” Sherlock stared back down the hall where John exited the bathroom in a rush then did an obscene hand gesture to imply…
John’s eyes wandered the expanse of Sherlock’s long lanky body, porcelain smooth skin, and toned lean muscles.
Sherlock clamped his eyes shut, bit into his bottom lip to hold back a whimper of need and shakily carded his fingers through John's hair.
"Good?" John's voice had gone low and rough, and God help him, Sherlock's cock twitched at that sound alone.
A spark of understanding and horror flickered in Sherlock’s eyes before he spoke clearly, “Stop it.”
Sherlock was in heat. John realized now why his husband hadn't wanted him to come, but it was too late. John had come and in so doing, enacted his own heat. Syncing their heats. That wasn't possible. None of this was possible.
When John entered the flat he hadn’t expected to see Sherlock and Mycroft sitting across from one another.
John sat listlessly in his red chair, within 221B, staring out the window vacantly. Sherlock remained unmoving, seated across from him in his leather chair, hands folded, the tips of his fingers pressed at the edge of his chin in his famed thinking pose, analyzing John.
Sherlock tugged softly at the alpha's hips and John seemed to understand the voiceless request. Leaving his salad to rest, the alpha spun to face Sherlock then and the omega moved to embrace John again.
"Now this is how it's going to work. When I call you over you are going to listen to every request I make. You are not to mention anything about our personal lives, because when I call you over that is when we will play our roles. I will be the master and you will be my slave. To the viewers we will seem like a BDSM couple. You, my slave, will be obedient and not contradict anything I do or say. You will degrade yourself in the eyes of this camera and you will play your role well. You will love it. You will accept all my cruelty with need and the viewers will remain none the wiser. Am I understood?"
“I’m sorry about the reporters. Mycroft’s been working hard at keeping them away from the flat, I didn’t realize they’d figure out we came here. I’ll get rid of them.” Sherlock explained, pulling away from John long enough to retrieve his cell phone, entered a quick text message, before taking hold of John’s hand once more and leading him back to the victim’s body.
Those tight arms around his waist loosened. John gently tugged Sherlock's arm, turning the omega around to finally face him. Sherlock's eyes snapped open and he met John's searching blue.
"Such a good pet. Love, you are so obedient." Sherlock smiled softly, and leaned forward to palm the alpha's chin, raising his head to meet his gaze.
John missed Sherlock so very much. He loved Sherlock and would never stop, but this kind of love was unhealthy. How could he still love a man who hadn’t cared for him enough to be faithful? True they might have been friends with benefits, but never had it felt like it was that. It felt… real, untainted.
.” Sherlock was sobbing, honest to God tears falling from his pale face and John’s vision was now clear enough to see that Sherlock was close to hyperventilating himself.
"Sherlock?" John spoke softly, eyes warm when they connected with Sherlock's responsive but cold gaze.
Sherlock nodded unsteadily, releasing himself and grabbing the bottle to squirt more lubrication, this time on his fingers, before setting the bottle on the mattress and shifting closer to John.
John groaned low, head bowed, watching Sherlock feast on his cock like it were ambrosia, and shuddered. Canting his hips, he shoved his head in Sherlock's accepting mouth and sighed shakily as a heated tongue slurped up more of his pre-come.
John sat in silence, staring blankly at the door leading out of the bedroom. His alpha didn’t want to claim him now? He’d implied as much to their parents.
Irene pulled away at John’s presence, clearly scenting his irritation and sat herself in a chair across from Sherlock. She eyed him as if he were a piece of candy. John wanted to grab Sherlock and drag him out of the home and force Sherlock to drop the case. John’s omega growled within, territorial and protective of what was his, and Sherlock was his damn it.
The edges of John’s lips twitched a mere fraction of a millimeter before he forced it into a firm scowl.
“You are,” Lestrade grumbled, pursing his lips in a frustrated scowl. “You’re angry, and for the life of me I can’t figure out why.”
“You’re an alpha.” John shot back, giving up the pretense of sleeping and shifted once more in the bed, but he couldn’t move any further off or he’d fall. Distracted with his efforts in creating further distance between them, John wasn’t sure if his ears were playing a trick on him, but it almost sounded like the alpha whimpered.
After their second go that night, John still couldn’t bear to stay longer than it took for him to crawl off the bed. And when Sherlock grasped his wrist this time, John didn’t look back as he pulled away from the touch and began the long path to his room.
him for him. No one had ever wanted him or appreciated him, not until John. Now, he hurt. Sherlock hurt deep. Within himself something gave to excruciating pain at the realization that it had all been a lie. John
“I have no forgiveness to lay out. I am exhausted. I’m so very tired of this marriage. Please, just go. I’m sure that… over time, your love will fade. You will find someone else.”
The copious amount of pre-come at his head gently rubbed at the folds and coated Sherlock's hole in his essence, and without further thought, John plunged his monstrous alpha cock within.
“But we both know that's not quite true. Well. I'd better be off. So nice to have had a proper chat.”
John and Sherlock felt like prisoners in their own wedding, forced to sit and listen to Sherlock’s parents and Mycroft give acceptable speeches and watch their guests mingle and dance. At one point, Mrs. Holmes attempted to have Sherlock take John to dance with him, but that was where Sherlock drew the line and promised his mother he would walk out of this wedding if he were pushed into doing so. John held back from speaking, because as painful as it was to acknowledge, John had always thought about this moment. The day he would marry for love and have his first dance as a wedded couple with his bond mate, but that wasn’t going to happen and John was just a bit disappointed about that.
John sat himself at the kitchen table, eating his apple, and began texting Harry, all while ignoring the alpha.
A warm hand palmed his shoulder blade and John buried his face deeper into his pillow stifling the strangled sob that broke free. Wordlessly, Sherlock moved closer, pressing his body up against John’s back, strong arms wrapped around his upper chest and held him close.
"Leave me alone." Sherlock sobbed pitifully, tears breaking free, his mind palace quaking under the weight of so many stressors. It was already just barely staying together. If his mind palace fell, he didn't know what would become of him.
“That doesn’t mean I like him. Just because people can be attractive doesn’t mean everyone wants them.”
. To follow his alpha’s lead and that he should never directly demand anything of him. That was what Mycroft was for. John was to tell Mycroft what it was he needed. Mycroft would offer whatever that might be to John. However, if it was something that directly concerned Sherlock, Mycroft would need to discuss the matter with his alpha, supporting his wishes. Then his alpha and Mycroft were to come to some agreement on such request.
John pressed the heels of his feet against the bed and caught more pre-ejaculate with the palm of his hand to dampen his cock further.
Sherlock looked pale, paler than what was normal for his complexion and that just wasn’t right. He looked ill. Pale silver eyes stared back at him, the lids of his eyes holding the only color in his colorless face. Sherlock’s lids were an angry red and puffy, eyes tired and clearly showing that Sherlock hadn’t slept at all.
“Oh?” Sherlock vocalized, frowning at his own vocalization. He sounded off, and it bothered Sherlock because he didn’t seem to know himself all that well anymore. “When will you be back?”
Even so, John didn't complain and allowed Sherlock to turn their home into a freezer. It wasn't enough though. His tie was cutting into his throat and made him feel stuffy. Sweat beaded at his forehead and he hated feeling damp under the collar. Removing his tie and unbuttoning his first three buttons helped a fraction, but it still felt intolerable. Next to be discarded was his coat, then his shoes and socks.
Sherlock hummed louder, growing all the more confident, smile tensed as he took in John to the hilt, nose burying deep in blond hair and driving John wild by the sight of it.
John watched as long dark lashes fluttered and pale gray eyes revealed themselves, staring at him in a daze, a grin spread over pale lips. John wanted to kiss the hell out of those thin lips, bruise them, claim them as his own, but he wanted to fuck Sherlock more.
As Sherlock strolled down the streets of London city, he dialed a number ferociously and the moment he heard the sweet greeting of his mother, he snapped.
"You're in no shape to stand. Let alone walk." John smiled, pressing his face against Sherlock's hip and nuzzling him with much love. Shrugging his shoulder against the hardness poking him and the stuttering groan that was his answer sent a pleasing chill through him.
"My personal assistant just reminded me I needed a check up and I thought it'd be nice to meet up again, two birds with one stone." Victor smiled with his eyes, his features softening pleasantly. Kindness in his demeanor, yet John felt an almost animal slyness with his approach.
Something hard, cold, and wet hit the back of his head, bursting on impact. Sherlock froze, momentarily surprised, having never seen this coming, and then turned to find a smugly grinning John behind him.
When Sherlock slipped back into the bed, John scented sweat and satisfaction on the alpha. He exhaled a heavy sigh when the alpha wrapped his arms around him and pressed up against him and found there was no unwanted pressure.
John's legs felt week and he staggered to a nearby wall and pressed a hand to it, balancing himself as he took in calming breaths. Trying to gather his wits. Trying not to recall how he'd nearly slipped into another omega drop a week and a half ago.
Yes… Harry came and they’d left to Sherlock’s flat… There was an old woman… Sherlock’s landlady… John couldn’t remember much, but he did remember she’d been kind. A nice woman, but Sherlock wasn’t home and… and his fever was horrible. He was delirious, slipping in and out of awareness.
for him. He was something Sherlock hadn't realized he'd needed, but after meeting him, after working with him, after developing... whatever it was they had, he couldn't be without him.
"I'm sorry. I should have told you, but don't question my feelings Sherlock. You have never been a contract to me. I always wanted you. I've loved you from the beginning. Victor-"
“That’s good then.” John said, deciding to let his resentment go. What had he expected of Sherlock? Everyone had a past, Sherlock might have had lovers, but John was his husband now. That had to mean something? As Sherlock said it was,
“Lestrade, may I come in. I have some things I’d like to discuss.” Mycroft pursed his lips. He hadn’t spoken to Lestrade much as of late. They had communicated more in the past when they’d both been monitoring Sherlock as he’d been addicted to drugs and working cases.
John sneered, a malicious smile sprouting upon his face. This was it. This was what John had been waiting for, the moment Sherlock would give up the façade of being a kind alpha and show his dominate side.
"He will not agree. Sherlock hasn't transformed well... since two years ago. It is one of the reasons why I believe he is so... aggressive with you," Mycroft contemplated.
John stared back warily. Had he gone too far? It was unnatural for an alpha to be dominated in such a way, but since Sherlock had literally never once taken the dominate role, he’d thought...
“Not really, John’s scent is affecting my alpha instincts.” Harry palmed her forehead, wiping the sweat from her brow, breathing heavily.
It had just stopped snowing when Sherlock arrived at Sherrinford. He was feeling a bit exasperated with how Sally and Anderson felt the need to interrupt him as he made his deductions at the crime scene. It had thrown off his groove of things; still, he made snide remarks back at them that caused their faces to go red. God, Sherlock truly enjoyed that.
. Sherlock wanted his moody, hesitant, withdrawn John back. That John he was familiar with, that John he knew. This John… This one made no sense.
“Oh, Sherlock! We were wondering when you would arrive. Come sit, eat.” Mrs. Holmes giggled, finding something amusing about the situation and John was at a loss as to what.
John shook his head, clamping his wet eyes shut, and removed his hand from his chest to angrily wipe away the tears.
John could appeal to Sherlock's omega, care for it, love it in the way it needed to be loved and supported. It might just be enough to heal Sherlock's mind. Sex didn't have to be the only option from what Dr. Swartz believed.
Deadening silence bled through the room and John breathed heavily as the alpha remained voiceless.  The tall man bowed his head and let out a wavering breath.
“I—that’s all fine.” John reassured warily, not liking just how detached Sherlock seemed about all this. Surely he could open up a little. John wouldn’t dream of asking for too much so soon, but some…
Sherlock choked on his tea mid-sip, unwinding his arm around John to retrieve a napkin from the coffee table and covered his mouth to cough, attempting to clear his throat.
Sherlock felt only slight remorse when his father looked at him as he did now, with horrified understanding. His father never pressured him to marry or mate an omega, but he’d always wished for Sherlock to know the joys of fatherhood.
The door opened and Sherlock's head snapped up. He sent a ferocious glare at the man standing beyond it.
Deep within his omega howled in rapture, spasms rippling through him, joyous and proud to be claimed at last. John refused to give into his omega’s desire of paying respect to this alpha. Clenching his eyes tight, John focused on his breathing, and restrained the whine choking itself in the back of his throat from breaking free.
John thought as much and, at the guilt in Sherlock's eyes, John's anger made a reappearance. He didn't care how many times Sherlock apologized to him, this wasn't right.
Sherlock's thighs strained, holding himself upright, just enough so John could work himself in him, taking on all the work. John's needing, insisting thrusts turned into rabid powerful thrusts up, surpassing the space in which Sherlock gave and shoved the omega up higher. Striking that tender place within that made Sherlock into a pile of mush. John bounced up, throwing Sherlock forwards and the omega lost his balance, falling over John's chest.
The day begun like any other, Sherlock woke earlier than was sanely agreeable and made it a point to carefully remove himself from bed as to not wake his husband. After readying himself for the day, he took to drinking two cups of coffee and began working on a human skin cell experiment in the kitchen. Several hours passed as he lost himself in experimenting and noting his observations.
“Please dear, don’t start this again. Your poor mother’s nerves wouldn’t be able to take it, not after the last time you sent Mycroft to hospital.”
"Sherlock please." John didn't like what Sherlock was implying. He meant if they'd discussed him in a degrading nature.
"Sherlock." John whispered, attempting to draw the omega's sights from the wall and to him, when he finally stood bare, in his most primal of states.
Sherlock knew. He knew that John’s change occurred because of Irene, because of the way he’d behaved. If he’d known that by ignoring his instincts and the silent request of his omega John would pull away as he was now, he wouldn’t have responded so cruelly. But it had frustrated him, frustrated him to know that John affected his alpha within. How could his instinct push him to respond so readily for a complete stranger, because that was what John was to him.
John’s words fell apart then, looking at Sherlock’s straight face, void of emotion, but for his eyes. His eyes seemed to say something, but John couldn’t quite figure out what, until it hit him suddenly. He knew that look well; in Sherlock’s eyes was shame.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't be saying this to you." John realized his mistake when the scent of sadness came from the beta before him and he sent out his alpha pheromones to soothe the beta. John couldn't risk stressing her and their child.
John let out a relieved sigh once he was within his own room. He never would have thought Sherlock would agree so readily with the ruse they’d have to play out, especially with the fact they’d have to reaffirm their vows with another wedding, but Sherlock had. John would forever be grateful that Sherlock would do so much for him.
“I’m fine Sherlock. I’m sorry to have caused you trouble.” John brushed past the omega, making sure to never meet Sherlock’s eyes directly, and quickly headed for the kitchen—because he was actually starving.
John followed Mycroft in complete silence, holding the laptop and DVD’s with a lost expression across his face. He hardly heard what the man said, but he noted they’d finished their tour facing the familiar door leading to the bedroom he now shared with the alpha.
"I know this might not be the way to say it, but I want to have sex. I... I tried reading books about how to set the mood and I... I tried to be subtle, but that didn't really work, so... I really need it. John? Can we at least try? I... I don't know how to really... I mean there was our heat, but that was more instinct than anything else, and I might be utter rubbish at it, but I promise to get better. We can practice and if you find that I'm lacking, I could go to the store and buy books. That should help. I think? I'm sure I will learn ways to please you, so-"
John needed to shower, wash off the scent of his alpha, because this was all so painful. It hurt to leave. It hurt to be near his Sherlock. It hurt most of all to be misunderstood. John didn't know if he made the right decision. All he knew was that his heart always hurt when it was in regards to Sherlock.
Mycroft huffed in annoyance, leaned back in his seat, folded his arms, and continued to watch the rugby match.
John could feel his cock beating the hurried rhythm of his heart against the zipper of  his jeans, weeping from the lack of touch. Teenagers got more action in their short lives then John had allowed himself to feel and that was a terribly sad thought to have.
John sighed and shrugged his shoulders. Any pet name Sherlock wished to call him was more than welcome, because it was proof of his endearment.
Breathing through his anger, his body strumming, trembling uncontrollably, Sherlock was faced with the truth he'd always known. Victor Trevor was the perfect embodiment of what an omega should be, so of course John would be tempted. Submissive alpha or not, John was attracted to that...
John knew he should be focusing on other parts of Sherlock’s declarations, but one struck out to him the most, far more than the rest.
“Hmm? Not sure, I must have lost myself in my mind palace for some time, but when I became aware of my surroundings I was in a cab, heading back to Baker Street.” Sherlock explained, entering the flat and moving to the bedroom.
“Where do you think our clients come from?” John countered Sherlock’s question with his own, feeling victorious by the look Sherlock sent his way.
Sherlock moaned painfully, half hurt, half bliss, it felt like too much pleasure, and sometimes an overwhelming amount of pleasure could equally be painful, because things weren’t supposed to feel this good. John understood. It was how John felt every time Sherlock touched him. John’s nerves vanished the more needing and pleading Sherlock became. John sloppily sucked in more of Sherlock; unwinding one arm from Sherlock’s leg to stroke three quarters of Sherlock’s cock, John could not take in his mouth.
Gregory didn't want to talk anymore and pressed his lips softly against Mycroft's own. The alpha's lips were warm, soft, untouched and
John wanted to be worshiped and adored by the affections of his alpha, because he would give Sherlock kin, countless pups.
John paused at Sherlock’s words. Did he really know? Would he trust him not to let his alpha back out?
Sherlock's hands trembled noticeable, far more than his body as he clasped them together and clenched them tight. Glancing over to their respective chairs before meeting John's stare, the omega moved to seat himself and waited for John to do the same.
" Sherlock's vulgarity was more than a turn on for John, but he was done in by the lustful silver eyes that devoured his soul.
John wanted to have Sherlock keep a low profile now, just until another story took the press’ attention from Sherlock. Only that wouldn’t happen, not when he’d received the news he’d wanted and dreaded in equal fervor.
John grew used to Mycroft's text messages giving him addresses. He'd soon learned that those addresses were locations Sherlock had snuck off to and John would always find the omega working on a case. Every now and again Sherlock would leave him stranded in a part of the city he wasn't familiar with. Thankfully, Sherlock didn't do it often. John suspected it was because of the consultant's lacking mental health.
“It’s just so… marvelously dark as night and wildly beautiful. I like the way it wraps around my fingers and I just—our pups would look so adorable…and…yeah.” John’s words fell away; maybe he shouldn’t have been so candid.
Mycroft smirked, "It's his way of storing all he views as important. He can dissociate from his body and slip into his mind."
“Look, I made a mistake. I sent something to Sherlock for safe keeping and now I need it back, so I need your help.”
John glared. Of course he was jealous, in pain, grieving the loss of Sherlock’s love, but he wouldn’t acknowledge these things to the very woman who’d stolen his husband.
Sherlock made it clear that their children and their personal relationship held no importance in regards to their work and that the press should leave it at that. If they wanted to know about the cases they solved and how they did it then that was all fine because it was part of their work. Their personal lives, not so much.
John mutedly took notice that they exited the maze and now stood in another maze, this one not made of tall bushes that seemed to reach for the sky, but of a colorful array of roses. The rose bushes were low enough so that they could see the path leading out and to the lush green grassed lands. In the center of the rose garden maze was a beautiful water fountain.
Clanging his fork against his plate, Sherlock's posture straightened in preparation, and he voiced his dissatisfaction in his demand, "Alright, tell me what's wrong?"
“Now in ten weeks you’ll get to hear their heart beat. You’ll be able to take photos with you today too.”
"Sherlock, please, don't. This won't help you. My past sexual experiences hold no grounds in our relationship. I will never be with anyone else. I swear, I won't betray you."
Sherlock hates how his sight blurs, but he hates the man he's become even more. He needs to take drastic actions to correct himself, but those same actions will cut the line that binds him to the one he loves more than anything.
"Don't." Sherlock whined, shivering when that same thumb slipped in further, circling the bead within, a persistent hard circle. Round and round it went, pressing against and rubbing it, before proceeding with that same torturous process.
“Sherlock… Sherlock… Thank you… Thank you… Thank you…” John wept, smearing his tears against Sherlock’s shirt.
Mycroft wasn't so sure that it would come to pass. He knew his brother before and after his illness, and he knew that Sherlock would not have responded to John's wrongs the same way if he was the Sherlock he'd been before his mind became sick.
That bitch would see just how angry he was. Just how far Sherlock would go to hurt John and shame their child. He'd shame the alpha's family and it might dull the pain.
“Move. Slowly.” John encouraged, lowering his hands to grip to the alpha’s shoulders, holding tightly, expecting the flare of pain that would undoubtedly come.
John blushed having walked himself right into that one. Victor did flirt with him, but John knew Victor understood dating wasn't something he was open to. So it was all harmless.
John seated himself and waited for Sherlock to join him. When he did, John’s lips pursed unhappily. Sherlock took to seating himself at his left, where the benches armrest worked as a divider between them.
“Well this is all so fascinating and I really would like to see what develops, but sadly I’m here with some clients, so I must be heading back to them. I did tell them I only wanted to say hello to an old friend.” Victor graciously elucidated, lightening the mood.
He at least hoped his alpha would be kind when he bred him. There were so many stories of alphas being aggressive and cruel when bonding with their mates. He didn’t want his first time to be like that… He’d waited; or rather his parents had forbidden him of dating or being intimate with others.
John sucked in a hissing breath, biting his full bottom lip and jerked his hips up, cock sliding in Sherlock’s loose hold. Swooping down, John claimed Sherlock’s lips in a hard kiss, full of wet noisy slurps and harsh pants. As soon as the kiss began it broke and John reared back tapping Sherlock’s leg caught between his own and raised his own to give Sherlock enough room to move it from under him. John settled himself between the taller man’s legs and took hold of the back of his knees and shoved them up until Sherlock bent his long lean legs. Sherlock grabbed the pillow as his side and placed it under his lower back for further support and waited for John’s lead.
"God, Sherlock. I love you." John sighed lovingly and raised his hands to frame Sherlock's pudgy cheeks.
“Dear...” Mrs. Hudson blubbered, rising from her chair and bringing John in close, embracing him warmly. “You look awful.”
John stared blankly at the alpha. He'd felt it, but he had thought... He wasn't sure what he'd thought, but it hadn't been that Sherlock was trying to comfort him.
On his fourth year of his third tour, he’d been transferred to Afghanistan and everything changed after that…
Mrs. Holmes managed to calm herself enough to invite John over for dinner the following night and informed him Mycroft would be sending a car to pick him up and take him to her home. John had promised he’d be there before they’d ended their call.
, Chapter Eight: Seduction. Option one: Strip-tease." Sherlock explained, a quiver of a smile at the corner of his lips. The omega was nervous and John couldn't see why. Sherlock was a vision.
long. John was forty for God’s sake. His alpha was ready to love, ready to give his mate everything, ready to have a family. It had been impossible for John to pull back his alpha when finally claiming his mate. His alpha, John, both human and animal side wanted to love Sherlock and he’d been helpless to control his need.
Cuffed groans and whines spilled from his lips, muffled by the cushion of the pillow, but only slightly. He couldn't help it. It felt wonderful, John working out the kinks and knots of tightly corded muscles, loosening and releasing all the tension and pain that had built up over the weeks.
John stepped forward, wanting to comfort the emotional omega, his alpha pheromones permeating the room, attempting to set Victor at ease. But John wasn't ready for Victor's eyes to meet his with absolute rage.
“I won’t stop proving myself to you.” Sherlock’s resonating voice softly followed John in the darkness of sleep.
John didn't talk as much during their walk. Mostly because he was taking in the scenery with a pleased smile upon his face. After they'd made several laps around the park John wordlessly led them to a bench to take a rest. John seated himself to the left and Sherlock moved to seat himself further to the right, past the dividing armrest that separated them. Though he'd agreed to join John on this... whatever it was, he would not seat himself next to the alpha. There were formalities that even he could not conform to.
When John's knees hit the edge of his bed, Sherlock broke their kiss and pressed the alpha down. John sat himself on the bed and stared up at his husband.
Sherlock unburied his face from out of his hand and turned to kneel over the toilet, hands pressed against the seat, keeping himself balanced. A sudden lurch of his stomach warning him of what was to come. Raising his sights up, Sherlock glared at the smugly grinning alpha, knowing John intended to comfort him. Sherlock didn't care about the logistics. He'd spent the last half an hour chucking his guts out and it was hell.
“John is two months pregnant.” Sherlock started to insist, but the look the doctor gave him told Sherlock all he needed to know.
Omegas didn't tend to sleep around, most hated the idea of being intimate with anyone beside their true mate and were willing to wait for them. However, it wasn't impossible.
"Yes... No. Sorry, it's not. It's just... couples usually talk about this sort of stuff before going out and doing anything."
John met Sherlock's eyes and knew he couldn't listen to his omega's demands this time. He'd be unable to enter Sherlock without at least
"Say something, please, Sherlock." John's eyes looked pained and for whatever reason that didn't sit well with Sherlock.
John was blushing and so was Sherlock. Groaning with embarrassment, Sherlock ducked his head in his pillow and muffled out an audible, "You can't say lewd things like that!"
Sherlock gestured to John’s reserved red chair and John hesitated momentarily before breaking the distance between them and sitting himself in the chair opposite of Sherlock.
John ignored him, not having the courage to admit how he wanted to believe what the alpha said. Except… It would go against everything he’d been taught to believe about alpha/omega dynamics. How could he trust a stranger?
Sherlock gave a terse nod in concurrence and that was all John needed before he seized Sherlock’s lips with his own. Shoving his tongue deep inside Sherlock’s welcoming, warm, wet mouth, Sherlock released a needy groan and fisted the back of John’s jumper, kissing him as if his life depended on it. Sherlock’s tongue was there to greet John’s in an instant and they familiarized themselves with each other after so long an absence. Their lips slid up and under the other’s respective one, sensitive flesh running along sensitive flesh, breaths mingling with every soft sigh that spilled out of them, a melding of lips, of bodies that felt predestined and so… so marvelously matched.
"Blimey!" John couldn't say much else but curses, as Sherlock hadn't let the alpha have a moment of rest. They'd been at it for hours.
Sherlock remained tense for several long minutes, in that time he listened to the alpha's breathing even out in slow deep breaths of slumber. Swallowing audibly, Sherlock slipped his hand away from John's and raised it up close to his face. Unable to see much, but even if there was light, it could not illuminate the taint of his hand from the soiled alpha.
Sherlock’s swelled pulsing cock resting heavily against his own belly, and John’s thickly engorged alpha cock hard-pressed itself along his, overwhelming Sherlock. He could feel each pulse strum through and against his own. The heat, the slickness of the alpha’s pre-cum, the feel of every grooved vein along John’s length strumming and his mind was suddenly spinning, on the edge of losing complete coherency. Each beat another vibrating zing down to his balls, and —
This was okay. It was time John let go of all the anger and self-hate. Sherlock was giving him back his life, it was time he accept everything. Tomorrow he would start a new life as Sherlock’s omega. John would truly open himself up, truly allow Sherlock in, and validate him as his husband. This was John’s New Year’s resolution. Allow his omega more freedom, accept himself for who he was and accept the goodness that was his alpha. Love may or may not come, but affection, care, friendship already existed and that was
John heard the dull beeping of a heart monitor, something so familiar and strangely soothing, as its beat was stable. Closed eyes squinted as he came to the full awareness of his body and the throbbing pain of his abdomen grew agonizingly stronger.
John smiled up at at the glare Sherlock gave him, tenderly twirling his fingers in the omega's hair.
Since he was up earlier than usual, and feeling refreshed after his shower, John put more effort into the meal he prepared for them. It didn’t take him long to prepare them homemade strawberry waffles, eggs, and freshly squeezed orange juice. When he’d finished preparing their meal, John headed back over to their bedroom.
Sherlock’s fork clanked softly onto his plate, body twisting to face John’s as the omega stared him down. John felt the heat of the man’s gaze though he didn’t raise his eyes from his own plate.
“Come along, John.” Sherlock beckoned after him, making his way to the door in hot pursuit of the departing D.I., but when he’d reached the door and John had yet to move, Sherlock stopped in his stride out the flat.
Once Mrs. Holmes released him of her bear hug, he was ushered inside the home where he was kindly introduced to Mr. Holmes. John liked Mr. Holmes the most. He was a rather quiet man, who picked up on the unvoiced, and he came to John’s rescue several times as Mrs. Holmes bombarded him with questions and affection.
piercing look. John shouldn’t have asked. Sherlock wasn’t pleased with him. He’d done wrong. Of course Sherlock didn’t want to talk about such things with him. John should just bear it in silence.
By the time Sherlock had finished, John was already lying in the bed…in the middle. Sherlock slid under the sheets and after a moment’s pause, wrapped his arms around John’s middle and buried his head against the omega’s neck. John exhaled a shaky breath, trying to rid his nerves, but still trembled slightly in the alpha’s hold.
John knew he was a horrible husband. He'd been lying to Sherlock since the day they'd met and although Sherlock wasn't a saint, he didn't deserve to have this. Have John being friends with a man he didn't like. John tried to reason with his guilt. If Sherlock only trusted him, than this friendship couldn't and shouldn't be viewed as a betrayal. John never won out with his guilt, but his stubbornness and need for kindness didn't yield either.
