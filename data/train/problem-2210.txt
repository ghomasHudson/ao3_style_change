The memory wing of Sherlock’s mind palace was in much the same state as Baker Street and Sherlock had made no attempt to rebuild it. He pictured his childhood as a map: parts of it clearly delineated—the library, the garden, the shore where he’d played with Victor—and others shading into mystery:
John fell silent. He watched as Sherlock drew into himself, his tall elegant form somehow shrinking into something small and hunched. He hated it, but at the same time he knew it was the most effective disguise Sherlock could adopt, all the more believable for not really being feigned.
Sherlock didn’t usually drink--the half whiskey he had sipped the night of the pool was the only alcohol he’d touched in months--so he felt the effects quickly. He ordered another drink. Now that he was no longer hyperventilating, it was easier to evaluate his surroundings. Sherlock took a slow scan of the room, assessing and cataloging:
Sherlock thanked her and escaped up to his room. A few weeks ago this prospect would have delighted him, but now he was too busy thinking. The man at the bakery had warned him off the tart; there must be something about it: poisoned? Sherlock had detected only raspberries and a faint scent of almonds, probably in the crust. Cyanide was meant to smell of almonds, but surely that was bitter almonds—Sherlock had never actually sniffed cyanide—and this had smelled quite sweet. Still. Sherlock was never given pudding: ancillae were meant to eat only the healthiest of foods, to increase their chances of conception, so presumably whoever had planned this had known he wouldn’t be called upon to eat the tart himself. But others would. Mrs. Turner and Cook at least, maybe even the other servants if Mrs. Turner were feeling generous. Surely they weren’t planning to kill off Commander Pitts’ entire household, would they? What exactly would that accomplish?
The test was negative. The whole family seemed to release a collective exhale, and the sense settled over them that it was time to put it behind them and move on. Sherlock’s father tentatively broached therapy, but Sherlock was incredulous: “What, at school? Are you joking?” and so the subject was dropped.
Sherlock let John fluff up his pillows and arrange him so that he curled on his side against them, the position that seemed most comfortable, and tucked the blankets around him. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here. The night you woke up confused.”
When other people’s lives fell apart, there was maybe a little bang at the beginning—the sound of a shot, of a bullet hitting flesh—but then mostly it was the long whimper of the invalid discharge, the half-pay pension, the limp and the tremor and the bleakness of losing everything that had mattered. Not Sherlock Holmes. When his life fell apart it was with the colossal drama of a supernova: police, press, publicity, everyone abandoning him in the end. Even his best friend.  When Sherlock’s life fell apart, John thought, striding furiously toward the door of Bart’s, it took everyone else down with it.  John was still so enraged with Sherlock and frantic with worry about Mrs. Hudson that he didn’t even notice the perfect timing of the cab that slid smoothly up to the curb the moment he appeared.
Mycroft finally seemed to realize he was gaping. “If you will excuse us a moment,” he said to Trevor and dragged Sherlock off down the hall. “What are you,” he hissed. “you can’t—how can you
Sherlock was already on his feet. He stowed his lockpicks and caught John’s arm again, tugging him into the room. John caught a brief glimpse of a desk and filing cabinet before the door swung shut, leaving them in total darkness.  John felt the wall at his back and wondered if there was a light switch. He reached out for Sherlock, but his hand touched only air. “Sherlock—“
“Oh.” Sherlock sat up and leaned over to rummage around in the bedside table, coming back with his phone and a set of earbuds. He handed one to John and settled back where he had been before, fitting the other earbud into his ear. John tucked his in and listened. He was no expert at chamber music, but he could pick out the violin, plaintive and longing, and the answering steady song of the cello. It was the most soothing thing he had ever heard. The piece was brief, and when he realized it had ended he picked up the phone from the bed and played it again.
John did not seem shocked, though his jaw had tightened in a way Sherlock knew all too well. He stood up and walked forward, glancing clinically over Sherlock’s body as though checking for dangerous moles, circling all the way around to inspect the backs of his knees. He stopped a few inches away and Sherlock, suddenly feeling cold and exposed, swallowed hard.
“Yes.” Mycroft looked no different than usual in the pallid light of the street lamps, but his voice was tight. “The Americans have a recording of a conversation that took place among members of a radical Islamic group in Chechnya. The gist of the discussion is that members of their brotherhood in the location we were discussing previously have captured a spy matching Sherlock’s description.”
“Because it was my night off, Sherlock,” John said patiently. Actually it had been his birthday too, but he hadn’t mentioned that. “Anyway, John Culpepper told Sally he’d be harvesting his hops today. The other men say they’re waiting another week, so I think he wants to get a jump on the market. So if we swing around by his farm, you should be able to get a specimen.”
Sherlock’s vibrating muscles immediately calmed under John’s hand. He stopped pacing, leaned forward, and nuzzled his forehead against John’s, transforming from anxious racehorse into docile housecat. He took a deep breath and said, “Well, if you look at the arches…”
John groaned and covered his head with his arms. Sherlock had finally finished cataloging every naturally occurring substance in the south of England, and had decided to create an index of tobacco ash. He had convinced John to assist him in smoking his way through the vast collection of various types of tobacco he had amassed. John found this disgusting, and though Sherlock claimed to like smoking, John had noticed he tended to stop after a few puffs. “How about you smoke mine today? You like it, after all.”
“So in two days’ time,” Sorcha summarized, “you need to be listening, on this band, at 2330 for the code to go out. That gives you half an hour to be ready to send the signal at midnight. Okay?”
“Oh no. We’re not trying that again.” It had sounded like a good idea at the time, but then of course Sherlock had got bored waiting for his turn to testify and dozed off. Sherlock was not at his best when freshly awakened. He had reduced the QC to tears. “Trust me, you’re more tired than you realize right now. You just need to settle down and--”
“I wrote to you,” Sherlock said. His eyes were still closed. “I wrote and I wrote. So many letters...they took them all away. They ripped them up, they burned them, they read them out loud, they laughed. They said it wasn’t right for me to write you, they said…” A hard tremor wracked him. “And your letters too, I never even got to read them after the first.”
John opened his mouth in outrage, but Annie broke in. “So Master Sebastian said! And then Lord Sherlock reached in and pulled out a golden pince-nez and said, ‘And this also? I believe this belongs to none other than your own mother, who was lamenting the loss of her spectacles only last week. Do you suppose
John remembered the poem. He thought about what was probably in that room. He thought about what it said about him that he had to make sure he had no regrets about children, every time. He thought about the Chisolms, of what this would mean for them:  a tiny little coffin to bury, a life that had been snuffed out before it ever began. The thought gave him a strangely sick, swooping feeling, as though he had missed a step going downstairs.
“Oh, it’s you,” Sherlock said. He pushed himself up and held out his wrist so John could take his pulse. “Of course I’m not worse, I’m better, I’m better than better. I’ve got ever so much to tell you! When can you come back?”
Sherlock blinked. He had repeated his cover story so many times he had almost forgotten John did not know what had really happened. “Actually…there’s a bit I haven’t told you yet.”
“Ones with children. They probably have other offerings not available at the regular brothels, the ones paying off the Eyes. Alphas, for example.” Sherlock was watching closely, but Watson did not blink; he wasn’t seeking out illicit pleasure himself at such a place, then.
“You were absolutely right. There was already a conviction in this case too, and it didn’t get a lot of attention—small town, a lot of meth, lots of dumb guys hurting women. But the details were exactly the same. I sent Sally the crime scene photos—she’s getting them up on her laptop now.”
“It’s all right. I think the gardeners have been trapping some rabbits and we haven’t shot any of those yet; he’ll like that.”
“Of course,” Sherlock gasped and flopped backward to wheeze on the floor like a stranded fish. Abbott stepped into the stairwell and looked down curiously.
Sherlock wanted very badly to point out that the Commander did not appear to hold with reading for alphas either, at least where he himself was concerned; also that at the moment his only duty was to sit in his room all day and wait to be impregnated, but he clamped his teeth down on his tongue and held it. The Commander would not want to give offense by appearing to block Sherlock’s taking Lady Mandeville’s class; he would work that out himself in a minute.
John shrugged. “I felt like going was the wrong choice all along. But it seemed important to you, and your arguments seemed sensible, so…but I missed you so much the night before, and then yesterday it was rainy in Edinburgh and I kept thinking, ‘Why am I sitting here listening to advances in diabetes management when I could be running around Cornwall with you?’ And then I came out during the break and there was Anthea saying you were hurt and she had a private plane and…” John shook his head. “If anything had happened to you, I couldn’t have borne it. Not just because I wasn’t there, but because I’d wasted two whole days that I could have been with you. So that’s when I thought, oh, fuck it. You deserve a say but in the end it’s my life. I’m not going to waste a minute of it planning for some future in which you aren’t there, because that is not going to happen.”
Sherlock pulled himself the rest of the way up and jumped the short distance to the dock. He stumbled, the ground unsteady beneath his feet, and John caught his arm to stop him going into the sea. It felt like an electric shock, even through his layers of wet clothes.
Jezebel laughed. “They are. It’s funny, I met Sherlock because he asked me to dinner; he was planning to charm his way into getting me to give up the dirt on my boss. But I knew before they poured the wine he was gayer than flowers in springtime. I didn’t call him on it until dessert though. You should have seen him, he was so relieved—I think he was petrified he’d have to get into my knickers to keep up the act.”
“What is it?” Sherlock said curiously, sniffing. There was a strong scent of alcohol, overlaid with something woodsy and vaguely familiar.
Dressed, Sherlock stood for a brief moment surveying the monitors. The cameras weren’t important unless they were recording, which he couldn’t tell; his problem was the guards, and the wall. Sherlock had seen the convent’s perimeter on his daily walks: a high old stone wall, topped with razor wire, with recently constructed guard towers at each corner. He needed to distract the guards and get past the wall.
“We do, not one of mine, though I help with all of them. Everyday spirituality. Cressida was leading a journaling session; they’re quite popular, especially at the women’s retreats. How are you? Everything all right with Sherlock?”
Sherlock filled John in on the way back to New Scotland Yard, telling him the story as briefly and in as little detail as possible.
The man gave a snort. “You’d best keep a close eye up there Bob, or they’ll have you up for stealing those horses next.”
“No. I mean, do you seriously expect me to believe your father knows that you are sneaking out in the middle of the night to go to France
“Dunno. I’ll ask Greg.” John considered this for a moment. “Probably proximity, unless there are mitigating circumstances.”
In the end it didn’t take ten minutes. It barely took three. John and Lestrade had barely started in on dissecting the weekend’s match when Sherlock leaped to his feet and shouted, “Lestrade! I need all the case files for unsolved deadly poisonings since 2003!”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock said, watching her narrowly. “I should like to see the kitchens now, if you please.”
--an RPG, Sherlock thought in shocked astonishment, he had never actually seen one—and the car exploded. Sherlock flattened, instinctively shielding his head with his left arm, his gun falling from his hand. Chunks of burning metal rained down around him and he tucked his head down tighter, unable to flee. He could feel the heat from the burning car. A single gunshot sounded close behind him and he breathed out slowly, calming himself, readying for the shot to the head that never came. Through the ringing in his ears he heard a shout.
“John. Listen to me. One hour ago my agents apprehended snipers who had been positioned at Baker Street, at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and near Detective Inspector Lestrade’s residence. My brother is on his way to meet with Moriarty now. The only way he can be sure of succeeding against him is if Moriarty’s advantage is neutralized.  Sherlock must know that you are safe. He must.” Mycroft’s usually dispassionate voice held an urgency John had never heard there before.
“The school demonstrations weren’t unbearable. The younger pupils mostly sang insipid songs; I suppose their intellectual accomplishments aren’t up to much. But some of the older ones seemed to have done well. Father’s going to sponsor four or five to the grammar school, which is better than last year--I think there was only one then.”
“Christ, you had me worried,” John whispered into his mass of dark curls. He couldn’t shake the feeling he should be averting his eyes from Sherlock’s bare head.
The psychiatrist was kind but firm. “It’s become increasingly clear that Mr. Holmes has fairly severe post-traumatic stress disorder, although obviously the withdrawal is exacerbating his symptoms—irritability, hypersensitivity, anxiety and so on. He’s going to need a full 28-day program to address both the PTSD and the substance abuse.”
Nicholls must have seen Sherlock’s eyes go wide. He grinned, not his usual smirk but a feral leer, moving toward the bed. Sherlock heard his ragged breathing. The bulge of Nicholl’s erection was unmistakable even in the darkness, straining the fabric of his trousers.
, but he held back, nuzzling gently. He stroked his hands down Sherlock’s arms and sides and slid off, preparing to move down between his legs. Christ. The moon was shining full in the window and lit that long, pure body like marble. He was white and untouched, a fucking unicorn, John thought a little hazily, waiting for John to deflower him. Oh,
John had to sit down, he was laughing so hard. Mrs. Hudson and Molly were clutching each other and shrieking, tears in their eyes, as Lestrade tackled Sherlock and sat on him until he got the phone safely away. Sherlock lay pinned on the floor, squirming and hissing like a trapped cat. “Really, if you wanted to grope me, you should have just caught me under the mistletoe like everyone else,” Sherlock managed finally when Lestrade had rolled off his stomach and sat on the floor next to him in the wreckage of evergreen and tinsel.
Sherlock obediently followed these instructions—Lestrade’s dictates had the authority of experience--and after some consideration decided that he could manage some tea and toast as well. The day was rather less gloomy than usual for February, and as Sherlock sat munching his toast he felt unexpectedly happy. He’d beaten Moriarty’s latest incarnation; he’d stood up for himself and earned Lestrade’s completely useless approval; he was a month and three days clean; he was not dead in Eastern Europe. He would soon be freed from house arrest. He was Sherlock Holmes. With or without John Watson, life was good.
Chapter 15: “De profundis” is a Latin phrase used to refer to Psalm 130, which begins “Out of the depths I cry to thee”.  Random trivia: it also refers to a letter written by Oscar Wilde to his former lover while Wilde was imprisoned for sodomy, which was not published until 1905 and has absolutely nothing to do with this story, but is interesting all the same.
Sherlock shrugged. “Studying the patterns of the boats and barges on the river. It might come in handy if we’re forced to escape from the school. Which seems likely, if I don’t hear from Irene in the next day or so.”
John sagged with relief. “We’re hoping for better weather tomorrow. I’m terribly sorry to bother you, sir, but I was sent by James Sholto. He said you were an old friend.”
“You need some rest.” She laced her fingers with his. “I talked to that bloody cow Janine, did I tell you? Said I’d never speak to her again after she sold you out to the papers. I told you I should have had you for my maid of honor.”
“Okay,” John said, a little relieved. He liked being rough with Sherlock up to a point, but they had passed that point at least once back during the Magnussen case, and he’d felt terrible for days.  “On your back. Spread your legs.”
John just shook his head. “You’re lucky they didn’t catch you and toss you through the hatch yourself,” he sighed.
John smiled up at him, mostly in relief at his wry tone. “Want me to take your satchel? That way you can get the doors open.”
John wound his fingers in the silky curls, mesmerized by the fierceness in Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock kept his gaze fixed on John as he reached up deliberately with one hand and smeared it through the come on his face, then reached down to wrap his wet hand around himself and began stroking. He lifted his other hand and dragged two fingers down his own cheek, making a trail of semen from his cheekbone to his mouth, and then licked his fingers. His burning eyes never left John’s.  He sucked John’s come from his fingers, pumped his cock slick from it, smeared it onto his face and into his mouth again. John couldn’t look away.  He was still bent over, one hand tangled in Sherlock’s hair, staring down as Sherlock—on his knees at John’s feet, staring up—fucked his own fist. It was the hottest thing he had ever seen.
“Yeah. I don’t know if it was getting clean or if what happened to him was bad enough that he got scared off, but there’s never been any hint since then.”
“Handkerchief?” John prompted gently, and Sherlock let go his hand to fumble in a pocket and wipe his face. He blew his nose and looked at John with watery eyes.
“Of course you remember,” Mycroft said from where he was lounging in the doorway. “You were seven years old, you weren’t
“Oh, shit!” Tilly blurted, immediately clapping a hand over her own mouth. “We bloody forgot, didn’t we? All of us did. You want some cake? It’s fantastic.”
Sherlock promptly opened it again. “We won’t be able to hear anyone coming. Here.” He handed her one of his linen under robes with the hem torn and muddied. “I stepped on this on my walk; it needs to be mended. I made you wait while I fetched it, that’s why you were gone extra time. Sit down.”
He had lived with this music for months, working it over for hours in his head on trains, in cabs, on long sleepless nights, without ever hearing it aloud. And now he knew. It was beautiful.
John waded slowly to where Sherlock stood shaking on the edge of the lake, breath coming in great heaving sobs. His guts felt like a mass of twisted ice. “Sherlock,” he whispered.
It was the rooftop all over again, Mycroft using John’s genuine shock and grief to sell his lie. “No.” He could not seem to focus his eyes, he had gone entirely numb. He was not even sure his lips were forming sounds. Vaguely he sensed a crowd of people now, his nurse, the office manager, other doctors, Lestrade trying to urge him down into a chair, but they were all spinning colors and meaningless noise. “No, no. No.
When the doorbell rang this time Sherlock was down the stairs so fast Mrs. Hudson never even made it to her door. “How did you take pictures? Did anyone see you? Didn’t I say not to be obvious?”
When John returned Sherlock was still sitting at the desk, looking thoughtful. The laptop was still open in front of him, screen gone dark. John crossed to stand next to him and rubbed his unkempt hair. “Doing all right?”
John panted a moment and then pulled off, a rush of warm semen cascading onto Sherlock’s already sweat- and come-slicked abdomen. “God, you’re a mess,” John said, reaching for the towel. “There’s come in your
No. No. No. Mycroft was now looking out the opposite window, his fingers knotted tightly around his umbrella handle. John found himself staring at his hands, the white tapered fingers that reminded him piercingly of Sherlock’s. Then do something, he thought furiously, find him, save him, get whoever James Bond’s real-life counterpart is—but he knew that if Mycroft could have done anything it would already have been done. He blinked his rough, burning eyes and took a deep breath. “It will never happen,” he said, distantly surprised by the firmness in his voice. “Never. You know Sherlock, he’ll—he’ll deduce all their secrets in no time, have them either at each other’s throats or convinced he’s some kind of holy prophet before he has time to grow a proper beard. You know it. He’s going to be fine.”
John grinned. “Hey,” he said, leaning up to speak directly into Sherlock’s ear. “I never did tell you my grown-up fantasy, did I? The one I had when I was twenty-one.”
Stumbling out into the rain felt even sweeter than it had when he’d left the van. Sherlock climbed halfway up the stairs, squinting: he could not tell if it was late enough that the sun was down or just the dark of the storm. They were alongside a sort of concrete dock, John already ashore and the fisherman pointing at something Sherlock could only barely make out: a path heading up the hill. Sherlock looked up and saw the beam of the lighthouse sweep toward him. They had made it.
cock, right here, this perfect beauty, God I've missed it..." He had managed to snake one hand into Sherlock's pajama bottoms, and deep philosophical thoughts were summarily abandoned for the remainder of the night.
The banging continued, harder than ever. “Ah, bloody hell,” John muttered. He pulled his coat and breeches on over his nightshirt, stuffed his feet in his boots, and headed for the ladder, shouting, “Hang on! I’m coming!”
“You pathetic fool,” Sherlock said. He leaned forward so that his hood almost enclosed the two of them, staring directly into her eyes. “Don’t you understand yet?
“It’s really me,” John said. “It’s really me, and I will never let you go again. If you trust in nothing else you can be sure of that.”
“Really?” Mycroft raised his eyebrows. “And when you’d been told Mary Morstan’s true identity, what would you have done with that information?”
“Totally wiped,” Lestrade said an hour later, in the building’s small security office. “All the footage from yesterday is gone, and the equipment was disabled. It’s not back up yet even now. We had our guys check it out, but they said it can’t be recovered.”
would make John’s life miserable. There was a small ridge up ahead, not likely to be steep, but John seized the chance to slow as though nervous about a drop. Lord Sherlock was by him in a flash, low and determined with his eyes narrowed against the wind, and John made a great show of shouting and haranguing at Hermes to catch up while keeping him back. Only when the copse of trees came into view did John dig in his heels, putting on a last burst of speed to arrive at the bank of the pond just a bare length behind Blackbeard.
“Alphas can’t be held responsible for their needs.” Sister Anna did not bother to whisper, her grating, critical voice barely lowered. “It is for you to set an example by prayer and modesty.”
“Yeah, I did,” John admitted. He couldn’t help smiling back. He hadn’t really talked about the change in their relationship at all, even to Lestrade—it all seemed so new and fragile—but now he felt like a giddy kid. Sherlock fancies me! A beer or two and he would be writing their initials on the wall of the toilets.
“The gate,” Sherlock said immediately, “the hidden one, it isn’t far, we turn off just over that rise.”
“Afraid not, but it’s been a pleasure, truly,” Sherlock said, shaking both her tiny bound hands in his large one. “I look forward to our next encounter. Not you, Kincaid. You won’t be needing us now, Alfie will tell you everything you need to know. John?”
Sherlock would have ignored this too, but he actually wanted something from Mycroft, so he rang back. “I need all the files on Moriarty’s old network in London,” he said when Mycroft picked up. He’d combed through everything that had happened since his arrest and come up with nothing that would constitute a crime worth advertising by Moriarty standards. That included his own. He’d shot a man in front of a dozen witnesses and a security camera: hardly the crime of the century.
Sherlock considered. The sane thing to do, the thing a person who listened to John Watson would do, would be to leave and not come back. Moran was ruthless and controlling and slightly violent, and his idea of a first date was to leave Sherlock black and blue from being fucked against a wall. This had the potential to end very badly. Which, of course, meant that Sherlock could no more let it go than he could fly.
“Oh, Merry Christmas to you too,” Sherlock said, refusing to get sentimental. “Go have another cake.”
, he clicked on the Order’s. And there was Sherlock. In the picture he looked younger, hair overlong and shaggy, eyes haunted and lifeless. John had never seen Sherlock’s hair. The dark curls seemed almost startlingly lush against his pale skin, but it was his eyes that John couldn’t look away from.
,” Sherlock said firmly. He wrapped his arms around John as though John might try to turn him away. “I can’t—I can’t do
John swallowed, trying to follow what Sholto was saying as well as what he wasn’t. Sholto hadn’t sold out; he was with the Jacobites, somehow, and he wanted John to join him as well. Could he do it? Live a double life, maybe do something to change things instead of living his life in futile but honest resistance?
Sherlock dismissed this with a shrug. “I’m sure Christian charity plays a large role. It’s far more palatable when it comes with cake.”
Sherlock grinned fiercely, but remembered to rearrange his face into an expression of concern before turning to face the others. “I think we should have a chat with Felix,” he said.
They were busy when John got back putting up the horses and the carriage, and it was not until he went to bed that night that he remembered the strange feeling he had had earlier, the heat that had filled him as he pressed Sherlock’s writhing body to the ground. He pushed the memory away and thought about the words he had learned that day. When he slept, though, he dreamed. He did not remember what he dreamed when he woke, but he did remember the rush of pleasure, hot and unexpected and exquisite, and felt the damp stickiness of that pleasure on his belly and nightshirt, warm in the cool night air.
Sherlock frowned at John in perplexity and then peered around as though expecting to see his plate still on the desk. His face cleared. “The thing with the sauce! It was delicious. So was the salad.”
Sally was spreading out files on the desk, having shoved all of Sherlock’s papers onto a chair. Sherlock didn’t mind; he would have done the same thing himself in her place. He put her cup down and tugged a second chair round.
,” Sherlock said sharply, standing up, and Willfen’s lassitude vanished abruptly. He whipped through the door and it clicked shut behind him. Sherlock snapped “locked” and rocketed out of the room, eliciting a startled squawk from Donovan.
Sherlock hesitated, but he was like the dogs now: he couldn’t stop until he had run his quarry to ground. He switched to his drafts folder and hit SEND on the email he had ready, which would route through a server in Asia. The email purported to be from Alice Thewlis, saying that she had spent the last several months fighting for her life in a remote Nepalese hospital and now was preparing to return home. Then he sat back to wait. Sherlock was not a particularly patient person, and this waiting was made even worse than usual by the sounds coming from the open door to the main studio.
“Jesus,” John gasped, hoping Sherlock had got himself good and ready because there was no holding back now. He pushed Sherlock’s legs up to his chest, gripped him by the backs of the thighs, and sank in. “Oh
“I know.” That did sober John, a little, but he could still feel the smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “But it’s progress. And progress is good, isn’t it?”
John grinned. “Remember back at the lodge when someone said there was a supply depot on Skye? This is the supply depot. Although as far as supplies go it’s rather hit or miss. There’s crates and crates of uniforms and plenty of food, but no weapons or tents or anything like that—although the bloke who set this camp up did all right for himself; there’s even a spirit stove. And tea. Are you hungry?”
“Well, she couldn’t come round til after school,” Donovan said slowly, “but as Mrs. Hudson will be there...I can’t believe I’m saying this, but she’s probably safer at yours than she is at her mum’s.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock protested, which was mostly true, but then John leaned over and kissed him again and Sherlock forgot all about what he was going to say.
“A month and two days. I can tell you that to the hour too, but it’s a bit less because I count from when my last hit wore off.”
“Oh good, you got the right brand this time,” Mary said in relief. She pulled out the package of sanitary pads and kissed his cheek swiftly, leaving John staring blankly after her as she trudged off up the stairs.
“Those men are all together. Probably from one of the factories, now likely in for pushing for reform, or objecting to the crackdown, or both. They’ve known each other for years, they’re a brotherhood, we’ll never break in.”
The tight knot in Sherlock’s chest loosened abruptly. “You’re right,” he said. He unclenched himself enough to wind one frozen arm around John’s back. “I have you. He doesn’t stand a chance.”
Mrs. Hudson did not turn up until evening, a small mercy Sherlock had been too busy to appreciate until she appeared. “Would you like some dinner, dear?” she asked solicitously. “Or at least some tea. Oh my.”  She had caught sight of his face.
I really wanted this part of the story to align with “The Final Problem” as closely as possible, but that didn’t work out, because “The Final Problem” makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. In a nutshell: Watson, who hasn’t seen Holmes in a year, discovers him on the doorstep in fear for his life. Holmes has spent that year building a trap around the terrible Professor Moriarty (who, by the way, has never been mentioned before) and now has everything in place to have the evil mastermind and all his henchmen arrested in three days. ACD never bothers to explain why he can’t just be arrested right then; he also doesn’t explain why Moriarty, instead of being a sensible evil mastermind and leaving the country, instead visits Holmes to threaten him and then spends a whole day trying to kill him off in various inefficient ways, such as dropping roof tiles near his head. Seriously? The Napoleon of crime, and that’s the best he can do? So Holmes, in absolute contraindication of everything we have ever heard about his character up until this point, decides to flee the country himself, and takes Watson with him so he can have company while in life-threatening jeopardy. And that’s before we get to the part where an elderly mathematics professor with a back-up sniper decides that the way to settle all this once and for all is to have a wrestling contest at the side of a waterfall. Hopeless.
“’Baby rabbit’,” Michael said. He was helpless with laughter, his hand pressed to his mouth and tears standing in his eyes. “No, no, no, no, no. This was a white guy, right? No. If anybody’s going to make you his little white bunny that’s going to be me.”
“Excellent. Off you go, Mrs. Hudson; you can have a proper little feast ready when she gets back. All right, this is where I want you to go.” Sherlock pulled up Regal Florist on his laptop, turning the screen to show her. “I want you to go there and buy some flowers and have a look around.”
“Well, you’ll have Mycroft now,” John offered. Mycroft had finished at Oxford and gone into government as well; he and the Earl had already returned to London.
“Shit,” he said, leaping up. He had completely forgotten about the client. Wasn’t Sherlock meant to be back by now? He looked wildly around the room, shoved a few dirty dishes into the kitchen, and leaped down the stairs two at a time.
Sherlock shook himself out of his daze. He needed to process. He’d have killed for a cigarette, but that was right out—he’d quit when Rosie was born, not that John had ever noticed—and anyway he was in a nonsmoking room. Back to the running shoes.
“Sir,” the forensic officer said, peering over Lestrade’s shoulder, “That’s not a stalker, that’s the Slender Man.”
Sherlock glared back, looked exasperated, and jerked his head hard to the side. Curious, John gave up and got to his feet.
When their turn came a cheerful woman a little older than Sherlock said, “What’ll it be, love? Sorry,” she said quickly as the man appeared beside her. “Sir. Brother.”
Sherlock, predictably, refused to eat the macaroni and cheese. By evening they were driving each other mad: John sniping at Sherlock for his incessant fidgeting and Sherlock at John for constantly checking his phone, “as though the signal were suddenly to vanish in
They emerged into the courtyard in time to see Sherlock being dragged back from the direction of the poorhouse. “All these brick buildings look alike,” he was protesting unconvincingly, neck still swivelling to try to get a look. The wind had died away, and there was a bitter, acrid scent in the air that made the back of John’s throat sting. Sherlock coughed, coughed again, and gave up trying to see over the wall to the poorhouse.
“Possibly in the beginning, but he didn’t stay long,” Mycroft countered. “He’d established another new identity by that point and poured a great deal of his resources into it. I can’t account for all of his movements over the past few years, but for at least part of the time he’s been living as a legitimate and very wealthy resident in Dublin.” He handed Sherlock a tablet open to an Irish newspaper’s society page. There on the screen, wearing impeccable white tie and looking rather jowlier than Sherlock remembered, was Jim Moriarty.
The Beekeeper’s Cottage is still only about half furnished. It turned out to have an apple orchard, which Sherlock hadn’t realized because he wouldn’t know an apple tree from a giant sequoia. John wonders how hard it is to make cider, and imagines crisp fall weekends, possibly with Lestrade down to lend a hand since Sherlock will be of no use whatsoever.
“No, that’s the school behind us. The hospital’s up ahead, and that’s the poorhouse over there. The orphanage for the little ones is past that, and the girls have their school beyond the hospital. There’s nothing on the other side of this wall but the river.”
“Of course,” John said. “May I just warm my hands first? I’m likely to drop the apples else.” John had left on Blackbeard directly after breakfast. A good long ride through the pristine fields of snow was the best way he knew to distract himself from Sherlock’s departure, but he had returned hours later with his face and wrists red and stinging.
“Of course not. How did your receptionist make that mistake? Sherlock Holmes, John Watson,” Sherlock said, whipping out Mycroft’s identification this time. “We were called in due to the national security implications of this situation.”
“Which is where I’m stuck,” John said. “I don’t blame her; I wouldn’t trust me either. But I’m thinking she might trust you.”
He’d been waiting outside her door for hours; it would be too unkind, after everything, to appear at her work or break into her flat. But he had to see her—had to apologize, had to explain—before he could move forward, not that he had the least idea what moving forward would entail. He didn’t even have a home to return to, as far as he knew.
“What the hell are you thinking? What if it doesn’t work? He’ll send you away sooner! And even worse, what if it does and you end up—“ John couldn’t even say it.
“You’d love to hit my backside, wouldn’t you?” Sherlock asked. “Look how hard it’s making you right now just thinking about it. You’ll hit me but what you really want is to take out your--”
,” he told John. “And they’re quite old--far older than this building; I think maybe there was an abbey here previously. Some of them are walled off but I think I’ve found a way to get back there--I’m just waiting for the opportunity to try it.”
Mycroft looked at him a long moment. “Oh, Sherlock, really. If you had to get yourself all emotionally entangled, couldn’t you have done it
“I need to have John and the military investigator remain here whilst I meet with some drug dealers and pimps of my acquaintance and give them exorbitant sums of money to tell me if they know of any assaults on young men meeting our victim profile.” Actually Sherlock had the pictures in his pocket, cropped to head and shoulders, but only the three of them knew that.  “Anyone with viable information will be unwilling to speak in their presence.” They heard Lestrade chewing as he thought this over. “I promise to remain within walking distance and to check in within one hour,” Sherlock added. John looked up, surprised at this concession, and Sherlock evidently misinterpreted his expression because he added, “Lestrade, John is wearing a
“Please forgive me for speaking out of turn,” the driver said. His smile was impossibly wide now, showing all his teeth, as though this would somehow nullify the tears in his eyes. “I thank God every day for the restoration of our glorious Empire.”
Sherlock shook his head once and looked away. He did not feel he had done well; the betrayal weighed on him like an unconfessed sin. But that was nothing his brother would understand. He closed his eyes as though exhausted by the discussion, and after a while he heard Mycroft’s measured footsteps pacing away.
Sherlock actually found himself smiling a little. Maybe poetry wasn’t as useless as he had always thought. He felt a surge of affection for Tiernan. “But I haven’t anything for you,” he said.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows and tipped his head toward the door of the conference room. “By jumpstarting the revolution. Should you care to listen in?”
Sherlock’s whole body shuddered hard, and John thought he was cold again, but then he turned to bury his face in John’s neck. He nodded once.
The sergeant confiscated their satchels and patted down their pockets, removing Sherlock’s purse without a word but ignoring the letter John still kept tucked inside his jacket. Then he collected a ring of keys from the wall, said, “Come along now and let’s have no trouble,” and led them down a darkened hallway. John stepped obediently into the small room when the sergeant opened it, then turned just as the door shut in his face.
2) Triage as we know it today came out of the Napoleonic Wars, but was not well-established outside of the military at this time. Large-scale industiral accidents actually played a large part in pushing the practice into civilian emergency medicine.
“Oh, if he were my boy, I can promise you he wouldn’t try a stunt like that again,” Mrs. Gregson agreed. She paused, looking at John with an expression he could not quite read. “Why did he do it, John? Do you know?”
The boy looked immensely relieved. He was about Sherlock’s height but broader and more tanned, with dark brown eyes like melting chocolate. “I can’t make her understand, my English is too bad,” he said in French. “And this way if my parents ask if I bought cigarettes I can say no.”
Shit, John thought, adrenaline kicking in, and he shoved Sherlock back the way they had come and shouted “Run!” as he brought his
Sherlock usually lapped up such praise like a cat, but an unfamiliar sensation had distracted him. “John,” he said urgently. “I’m starving. I think I’m going to pass out. Stop laughing, I’m not being a drama queen! If I don’t eat imminently you’re going to have to hook me up to a drip feed.”
Sherlock lay on his side, trying not to jostle his back too much. He felt heavy and groggy from the painkillers. He’d tried to decline them, but Mycroft, apparently unable to bear the sight of his little brother in pain, had said curtly, “Forty-eight hours, max,” and Sherlock had given in. He still hurt, but knew the wounds would heal in time. Mycroft had nearly driven him mad initially until he realized his brother was trying to find out if Sherlock had been “interfered with”, but his captors had only been interested in information. Still a virgin and likely to die that way, so hope you’re happy about that, brother mine.
John followed the lead of the other prisoners and washed only his hands and face--they had no clean clothes in any case--but Sherlock stripped down unselfconsciously and scrubbed every inch he could reach. The water in the basin was black when he finished.
John looked down at what he could see of Sherlock--the top of his head, the curve of his cheekbone—and slid his hand slowly down the bare skin of Sherlock’s neck to rest at the junction of neck and shoulder, just inside the collar of his shirt. There was no way even Sherlock could interpret it as anything but a sexual touch, and yet he did not pull away. John felt him still for a moment, and then he arched his head to the side, deliberately baring more of his neck. John had never touched him like this before and it felt unbearably intimate, the skin even softer than it looked. If he leaned down now, would Sherlock lift his face to his? Would Sherlock let him kiss him?
They could hear the sounds of distant cheering behind her.  John and Sherlock looked at each other and began laughing at the same time.
seemed all that was required anyway. Sherlock seemed to decide that whatever worked with his hands would also do for his mouth, and he curled the flat of his tongue against the most sensitive spot on John’s prick. John almost shouted and he thrust into his mouth without thinking, making Sherlock choke, but then Sherlock moaned and gripped at John’s hips to pull him closer. John tried to pull back but Sherlock held on harder and sucked at him, which was insanely distracting, and then John remembered what Sherlock had said about liking it when John took his pleasure from him, so he tentatively thrust forward again. Sherlock rewarded him with a suck-slide of his tongue that made John gasp and grab for his hair.
Collins glanced up at the mountains in alarm. “Ah, bugger me, you’re right.” He looked sadly at the jostling villagers. “Sorry, mates, I would have loved to have had your food, ours is shite.”
“She worked at that Asian fusion place,” Lestrade said. “I don’t think they serve bread…I think these are some kind of pastry. “
John hadn’t danced in ages, but he’d always loved it, and in minutes he had given himself up completely: the music, the motion, Sherlock’s sinewy body pressed against him like a mirror of his own movement. Sherlock’s hand landed on his hip again, firmer this time, and John’s hips flexed almost of their own accord. Sherlock’s hand slid around his waist and pulled him in. Together, apart, together, apart; John felt the percussive beat of the music thudding in his cock and he
John looked around, curious in spite of himself. He had vaguely expected some sort of high-tech command center out of a Bond film, but the study was surprisingly cozy given its size, with a pair of armchairs drawn up before a crackling fire. Mycroft had just risen to his feet from one of them.
First off, apologies to anyone who got confused by this chapter disappearing this morning--I took it down to rewrite a key section.
John drove. He kept sneaking glances in the rearview mirror, but Sherlock was staring fixedly out the window, chewing his lip. His arms were wrapped tightly around his middle as though he feared he might fly to bits if he didn’t hold on. John felt his own lips tightening: whatever Sherlock was going to tell him, he was fairly certain he wasn’t going to like it.
“D-d-isguise,” Sherlock said. “I g-got off the t-train at the last st-tation so no one would r-recognize me.”
Sherlock found the break room a bit farther along, on the same side of the corridor as the guardroom. It was a small room with a mismatched assortment of shabby furniture and a toilet through the back, with a table holding a kettle and mugs. Perfect. Sherlock swung the door all the way open to test its arc, then pushed it nearly but not quite closed; he needed to be able to hear the guard coming. Then, after some consideration, he turned on the overhead light. It was a bit of a risk, but the guard would probably assume someone had simply forgotten to switch it off, and he couldn’t take a chance of being blinded by the sudden illumination. Then he settled in to wait.
When Michael sat back groaning Sherlock leaned over and retrieved the towels; the condom was still on his softened prick but it was beginning to slide off, so Sherlock removed it with as much care as possible and gingerly tied it off to reduce mess. In spite of this the bed had somehow become a disaster, wet spots of lube and semen everywhere.
Sometime in the night there was a bit of fuss—some sort of commotion, loud enough to rouse but not entirely wake him, and he soon drifted off again when it quieted. When he woke again he saw that it was morning. Remembering the noise, he glanced to his left, assuming he would see only the curtain pulled all the way to the wall, but evidently the curtain had snagged on the small bedside table. Sherlock could see the woman in the bed, who was sitting up eating some sort of porridge out of a bowl on a tray. Her wrists were bandaged. The woman wore a loose white gown, like him, with her hair down around her shoulders. It seemed shocking—Sherlock could not remember the last time he had seen another person’s bare head—but that was not why he stared. The woman was a stranger, and the habit hanging from a peg beside the peg was not white but red. She was the first full order member Sherlock had encountered.
John was breathing hard. “I think you didn’t tell me on purpose. I think you were hoping for something like this to happen, something to get her out of the way.”
,” Sherlock said superciliously, and he bounded off, turning unerringly onto the barely-visible path that led to the peregrines’ nesting grounds.
Sunday Moran and Margaret of York were both at church, though Moriarty was not; evidently he’d returned to wherever he’d been when Lestrade had called him back. Sherlock tried to catch Captain Watson’s eye at the car and thought Watson gave him an infinitesimal shake of his head, but what did that mean? Pitts hadn’t been interested enough to follow up? Moran had been followed but turned out to be spending his nocturnal ramblings feeding the poor?
Sherlock knew that Baker Street was impossible. Even if he could somehow get up the stairs, the flat was old, with narrow corridors and furniture everywhere and sharp angles. He could never manage it in a wheelchair. So he agreed, with no great grace, to the only viable option, which was Mycroft’s ridiculously oversized house.
“Yes. More than once. It goes nowhere, unless you count the time he got a bit snotty and started deducing
“Please,” he gasped. “Please, John, I want you to take me, I want you inside me, I want to be yours, please--”
“I guess it was lucky he didn’t sell the batch to anyone else before it degraded. At least he won’t be selling anymore.”
“I’m not. There’s only one man in the country who can do that.” Sherlock looked at Irene. “We need someone who can convince the king.”
Harry is sixteen months sober, and she and Clara are thinking of starting a family. They approached Sherlock first, but he wants to think it over before broaching the subject with John. Secretly, Sherlock quite likes the idea of being a father—at least as long as Clara and Harry do all the actual parenting—but he sees the dark outline of Moriarty’s endgame now, and he won’t risk involving anyone else. (“We’re not getting any younger!” Harry snapped. “Give him time,” Clara soothed.)
They drove on through the long northern twilight. They were going through more villages now, it being impossible to get to their destination without going through the populated belt between Edinburgh and Glasgow, and John hoped they might attract less attention where there was more traffic. Curiously, they encountered no checkpoints.
Sherlock and Molly both jumped. They stared at each other an instant, Molly’s eyes so wide they looked as though they might never go back, and then Sherlock grabbed the receiver before he could lose his nerve. “Hello?”
—even the slang was different, it was John possessing him and filling him and owning him, and Sherlock wanted to be filled and possessed and owned.
“Uh, yeah. Actually I was thinking more of lubricant. Heard of it? It’s going to be kind of essential if you want me to bend you over a pile of pillows, which we are not doing today anyway, by the way.”
Sherlock was still studying him. He looked older in his fine clothing, tall and elegant, but his eyes were wide and dark. “I am having exceedingly sinful thoughts at the moment,” he informed John. “But that did not work out very well the last time, so I have decided to defer to your judgement.”
“That’s Simon,” Sherlock said, letting go of John and sitting up abruptly, alert as a retriever on point. “Something’s wrong.” He grabbed for John’s shoulder to get to his feet; he still had a bit of residual weakness in his leg.
If Sherlock were honest with himself, what he’d really been hoping for was enough information about an organized resistance movement to allow him (but not the Commander’s secret police) to work out the identities of everyone involved, make contact, and pass information from the Commander’s files to them in the form of coded messages done in whitework on handkerchiefs. Then they would help him escape. It was a good plan. Unfortunately, if such an organization existed, it was doing a highly competent job of evading notice.
The door slammed and a sharp knock came by his ear: no Morse code now, just John’s fist letting him know they were safe. Sherlock pushed himself out of the compartment just as the van doors opened. Sherlock blinked, briefly distracted: it took him a moment to be sure the man—already backing away—
Sherlock blinked, but he didn’t look away. John steeled himself for the eye roll, the snarky remark (
“Oh, I must go,” Molly said suddenly, looking at her watch. “I’m meant to be meeting my mum at church for services.”
“Is that what you want? You want that rich man with his fine clothes and his mustachios and his fancy ways?” He pulled Sherlock’s head down and took his mouth in a hard, plunging kiss, running his tongue possessively over Sherlock’s teeth. Sherlock clutched at him, his hands skittering over John’s back and arms as though unable to settle where they should go. John wrapped his arm around his waist and crushed Sherlock against him as he kissed him again. Sherlock’s knees were trembling and John braced him against the wall to run his mouth over his throat.
“Oh God no.” John got to his feet and took Sherlock’s hand to pull him up. “I feel I’ve only just got you; I don’t want to share you just yet.”
Sherlock ignored her. John said, “It’s all going to be fine, Mrs. Hudson, but you might want to excuse us, thanks very much for the biscuits.”
John sighed, but he got in. He had not spoken to Mycroft since the funeral.  He had been angry and half-blinded by grief at that point, but in the intervening weeks his fury had burned itself out, and he had made his peace with the situation. He had spent a last night cherishing his infant daughter, and a last night with his wife: no upside in prolonging the inevitable.
Sherlock shook his head slowly, his gray-blue eyes never leaving John’s face. John worked a hand up between them and wrapped it around Sherlock’s. “Do you have to go back?”
He locked it in the cellar of his memory palace, but sometimes he saw it anyway: the pool. Light flickering off walls, Moriarty’s anger shivering the air,
Everyone turned to look at him. “Christmas, Sherlock?” Roz said. “You remember, the reason for all those lights displays you hate so much?”
1) The first medical school for women in the world was established in Philadelphia in 1850 (supported, of course, by those notorious 19th century lefty badasses, the Quakers). While medical schools in England, Ireland and Scotland established colleges for women later in the century, access to clinical training was severely limited. This was less of a problem in America due to the burgeoning (poor) population.
John gulped down his porridge, borrowed a razor from one of the orderlies, and made short work of his cold bath. Somewhat to his surprise he did feel better once he was clean and dressed, and he headed for Sherlock’s bedside with renewed vigor. The nurse handed him a tin cup and a little curved spoon.
The old man sniffed slightly. “I was his commanding officer, if that is what you mean. And I suppose now he is yours?” He eyed John’s uniform with distaste. “Dreadful, what things have come to. Well, come in. Must I bestir myself to get dressed, or can your business wait until the morning?”
Sherlock came out of the kitchen carrying two beers, one of which he handed to Lestrade before bringing the other to John.
She clearly meant to go on but Sherlock held his hand up, stopping her. “No. You won’t. If you apologize then I’ll have to apologize and we’ll go round and round and I’ve had quite enough of those conversations lately. That’s what I always liked about you, Mary, we don’t
“You’ve the better handwriting and I’m faster on the database,” Sherlock told her. “So you’ll start there, 17 December, and read out the numbers. Once we’ve identified them you can just mark through any repeats. This is a teenager, a few years older than you but not so clever, so I doubt he’ll have thought to get a burner phone, and there are a lot of texts—but what we’re looking for might be a text, so we have to go through everything.”
to stop Moriarty before that happens, and now you’ve got the means to do it. I’ve known there had to be letters for ages—I overheard Sir James threatening someone who got cold feet before and he said he had evidence. But I’ve never been able to find them. If you’ve got the proof--”
“Nope.” Sherlock shook his head. “Tried and tried, got a second autopsy and everything. Couldn’t solve it.”
Ryan might have lacked the courage to take a stand on a suspect, but she was not backing down from Sherlock. She drew herself up to her full height and said coldly, “Get out of my crime scene.”
“When I first learned that Sir James Moriarty desired an introduction, I was quite surprised,” Irene said. John had brought another chair and they were now gathered in a little knot around her bed, their fledgling conspiracy lit by a single candle. “He has no reputation for licentiousness—truthfully he has the reputation of being no fun whatsoever. I was inclined to decline, but it seemed imprudent. Even then—this was a few months ago—he was known to be the most powerful man in England. And it seemed a bit of a challenge, so we met. As it turned out, he did not desire my acquaintance for himself but for his son.”
“Of course it’s not a suicide, how can you possibly—“ shouted Sherlock at the same time Donovan, overlapping him, answered, “Not sure yet.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said, turning back to his music and picking up the violin again. “We could have dinner early, if you like.”
“You’re much better,” John said, still unable to stop smiling. “You’ll probably still have a fever at night for a bit, but it’s lower. You need to drink.”
She found the sidebar easily enough in the main Crib Killer story; the photo in that one showed John Watson too. He was handsome as ever, she thought, feeling a surge of affectionate nostalgia. The story was short on details and long on speculation. “Holmes was accompanied on the case by his longtime associate Dr. John Watson, a former doctor in the British Army. The two live together in London and have long been assumed by the London press to be a couple, though neither has ever confirmed the fact publicly.”
After three days two guards unexpectedly materialized at his bedside and took hold of Sherlock’s arms, pinning him down as he struggled. A nurse jabbed him in the bicep with one of the same syringes Sherlock had used on the guards and Sherlock noted, oddly clearly in such a fraught moment, that his lips and tongue seemed to go numb before everything else grayed out. When he awoke a drip had been inserted into his arm. He might have cried then, but the drip had not been running long enough for him to have any tears.
John, who had just taken a sip of his own wine, snorted and then coughed into his serviette as the wine burned his throat. “I can’t just pick up blokes at Tesco, you know! That’s what Grindr’s for.”
“Well,” she said, looking away and picking up her wineglass again. “It still helped in the end. Because once I realized the potential of what I had, I realized that I had the chance to create that future, not just dream about it.”
John considered. “Yeah, I guess technically I was, but we can do it differently next time.” He kissed Sherlock lazily, wiping the sticky mess away with his hand.
It was much the same the fourth time, and the fifth, and the sixth, and the seventh. There were parameters, unspoken but clear to both of them. Always standing, only in the shared areas of the flat (except the time they’d been in Cornwall for a case, staying at a thin-walled B&B, where John had got Sherlock off in a dark corner behind the garden shed). Sherlock never asked, although sometimes he definitely hinted, but the final decision was always John’s. Once, when Sherlock was being particularly poisonous, John had stomped off to bed, only to come back down a few hours later when the flat went unnervingly quiet. He found Sherlock hunched on the fire escape, smoking.
“Oh no you don’t. I was thinking you could use your secret staircase to slip down to the cellars and then--”
“Good,” John said, grabbed him by the dressing gown, and hauled him in. Forget careful. As Sherlock had amply demonstrated, he could take care of himself. John kissed him hard, walking him backward until he reached the wall, and then pressed into him. Sherlock groaned and slid lower so that their heads were level, spreading his legs. John slotted himself between his knees and rocked his hips. He had never been so hard in his life.
Mycroft intervened a bit hurriedly. “Well, entertaining as your little detour into universal popularity must have been, it doesn’t seem to have advanced our cause. It seems as though we’re back at square one. What now?”
They waited a long moment and John was just reaching out the try the bell again but Sherlock said, “No, wait, someone’s coming.”
“The girls at school. The popular ones. They don’t take any notice of me now, but if I was to get my hair done…they’d think I was trying to be like them, you see?”
“Precisely. Leaving aside the astounding chauvinism of Her Majesty’s Secret Service, I requested a list of everyone with involved knowledge of the Serbian operation. These aren’t field agents, they’re desk-bound bureaucrats. So…” Mags, knowing everything. Mrs. Hudson so many years ago:
“To be sure, sir,” answered John, who was not really certain exactly where the doctor was going with this.
John stepped forward, directly into his face. “You listen to me,” he said, voice utterly quiet. “There is nothing I or anyone else can do for him now, not in this world. But there are others here who need me. Now either be a man and help, or get the hell out.”
Sherlock did it again, and then he unbuttoned John’s other cuff and pressed kisses into the pulse at John’s wrist, almost drunk with the scent and feel of him. John was working his way down Sherlock’s neck at the same time, which was so distractingly nice that Sherlock kept throwing his head back to moan and then had to nose around trying to find John’s hand again. There was a tiny stain on John’s cuff—
Thursday: same as usual, Margaret of York prattling away in needlework class about the new gardener who was clearly smitten with her, to the guard captain’s jealous dismay. Friday she was at services as usual. Saturday afternoon Sherlock saw her at the park, strolling with her friend, the equally young and stupid Sister Rachel, whilst their bored maids trailed behind. Sherlock himself was walking with Molly, shadowed in turn by Tilly and Molly’s guard captain, Kate.
“Brilliant seeing you again, John,” Henry said warmly as they walked out. “Here, put your number in my mobile, would you? I’ll text you next time we’re out.”
“Lorry’s clear,” John said, coming up behind him and dropping to his knees. He stuck his gun into his waistband and tore at the plastic tarp. Sherlock grabbed for the jacket of the man groaning at his feet and found a knife, which he fumbled open and passed to John. John slashed the plastic straight down the middle, dropped the knife, and folded forward. He made a sound Sherlock had never heard from him, a horrible, gut-deep howl of anguish.
“Did you read that e-mail from Lestrade?” John said, glancing up. “He texted me again this morning.”
“Oh,” John said. He still wasn’t processing at full speed, but he thought he could see what Mycroft was up to. “That’s…that’s pretty good. Yeah. If you can pull it off, anyway.”
“A situation I’m sure he’ll remedy within a year or so.” Sherlock’s mind was whirring: a year. He and Molly had both been covenanted in September. If this became law, he and Molly would be sent to new commanders in four months at the latest. Sherlock lay down his biscuit, which no longer held the slightest appeal for him.
“I know you will want me to go to hospital,” Sherlock said, not meeting John’s eye. “But. Can you.” He swallowed, grimacing a little. “Please John, can you look me over first. I don’t believe I have any serious injuries. If you still think I need further treatment, I will do as you say.”
John looked out the window to hide his smile. He had no idea what Sherlock was up to, but it didn’t matter; John would follow along regardless. He spotted the familiar landmarks when they passed through Chertsey, but the area had built up quite a bit since the last time he had been there, and he didn’t recognize the dark side road Sherlock turned down until they turned again, headlights flashing across a familiar logo.
“Oh no,” John said. He hadn’t seen a danger night in a long, long time, but that didn’t mean he’d forgotten the signs. “You’re not going anyplace. Sit back down and tell me what the hell is going on.”
, it has to be me going in there, no one else. He’ll have people there watching that will set off the bomb if the Brighton police show up.”
There was a brief silence. Sherlock hoped he had not left the woman too thoroughly rattled to speak, but blindsiding her was part of his strategy: she’d be more likely to follow his lead that way. “Er...where’d you say again?”
Sherlock went quiet, turning his cup in his hands. “My whole life is built on lies,” he said eventually, not looking up. “I hate it.”
John took some more of Sherlock’s chips and settled back comfortably. The pub was beginning to fill up, but it was still possible to talk without shouting. He glimpsed a group of men with close cropped hair coming through the door and wondered idly if they were soldiers home on leave.
“I’ve been arranging your pardon, brother mine.” Mycroft settled himself elegantly in a chair and crossed his legs. “It’s a Herculean task, I assure you.”
Sherlock drank three cups of black sweet coffee and the top of a piece of Christmas cake that was mostly icing, tossing back the Nurofen Mrs. Hudson brought him with the coffee, and felt revived. He had plenty of cocaine left, of course, and opioids that would have helped the pain far more efficiently. But John’s ultimatum was still hanging in his mind like a banner, and Sherlock believed that he meant it. At some point Sherlock was going to have to make a decision: pick up the drugs or put them down forever; give up John or face the rest of his life naked, without the protection and comfort of the drugs. He could not face that decision yet.  Never mind, he could put if off for a bit. He had work to do, and for the time being he could get by with the second-rate high of caffeine and sugar.
the intimacy he’d always shunned, wanted to see John’s face when he entered Sherlock, when he climaxed. He’d started working at it, in secret. Sherlock knew the principles behind cognitive behavior therapy—he’d been to rehab three times, he hadn’t deleted everything—and had mapped out a plan he thought would work. So far he hadn’t progressed past lying on his back and visualizing, but it was early days yet.
“I know.” Young Tom looked miserable. “I didn’t--I wasn’t sure I believed it, really, not of you anyway. But Lord Sherlock, the way he is with you--he was never like that before, not with anybody.”
“My parents’. They thought it would be easier than starting at a new school and then changing again in a year.”
A shiver went up Sherlock’s spine. He knew what that smell was, knew it on a visceral level, and he knew he must have smelt the same when he had been brought to the infirmary. He lay still, listening to the sounds as the bossy nurse directed the guards to lay the woman on a bed. The footsteps grew louder again and Sherlock closed his eyes hurriedly, but they didn’t so much as slow when they passed his bed. When they had gone Sherlock sat up again, straining to hear the sounds further along the ward: a soft swishing and splashing, the rustle of cloth. The nurse must be washing her, just as Sherlock must have been washed. He didn’t remember.
