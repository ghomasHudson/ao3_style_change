The Alpha opened his mouth to say something, but before anything came out of his mouth, the Omega took Dean by the arm and lifted him off the floor, leading him out of the bathroom.
Dean stared at him for a few seconds. He looked serious, his brow furrowed, and he pursed his mouth in an unreadable grimace. "I don't understand" he finally said, crestfallen.
"Better. Thank you," the Omega whispered, without looking up.
The Latin words "ordo et militaris discipline" (order and discipline) and the relief-drawn walls of Alphas standing on Omegas kneeling, showed clearly the place in question.
"Drink all the juice, it is orange, it will help you regain energy"
"You see, my friend is very interested in that Omega, and he is interested in buying it. I was wondering if he could provide me with some contact from Dean's Alpha, in order to be able to do business. I suppose the System does not oppose this type of transaction" Charlie said. He gave a friendly smile and an intense look and the Alpha sat back, somewhat uncomfortable.
"Castiel ..." Charlie called and judging by his tone it was not the first time he called him.
Castiel's stomach contracted again. The idea that Alastair was going to hurt Dean made him panic. Every time I thought about it I wanted to get off the plane and run to get there faster. He knew they were moving, but he couldn't help feeling that they weren't moving fast enough.
One of them, the one who had remained silent so far, pulled out a black baton and hit the Omega with it. It was so surprising and quick that Dean barely had time to think about defending himself. Anyway, it wasn’t like he was going to, he had promised not to react, and he knew it was for the best.
"Dean," the Omega whispered.
Dean said nothing, covered himself even more with the blanket. He was so hungry that he knew the Alpha was listening to the sounds his stomach made. But he didn't move from his place, looking at his bent legs.
The manager looked at him for a few seconds, then chose to leave the bottle on the floor, near the Omega.
Charlie put his bags on the floor next to him, where he helped him sit down, and stopped to look at him.
It seemed like a question, but the Alphas did not ask, they ordered. Anyway, not wanting to risk anything, Dean extended a cautious hand and wrapped himself in the blanket, leaving only his head out.
When he was presented to a manager, a certain Ketch with an unbearable tone of voice and an arrogant attitude, Dean tried to put  the plan he had made with Castiel into practice, but he had spent hours in that small cage, in motion, he was hungry and cold, and he barely managed to open his mouth before a huge guard hit him again with the black baton.
"Take him home and take care of him. He had a fever, he had some wounds from the other jerk Alpha who hit him ... but also old scars, from his current Alpha. That hits him, hurts him ... and I can't leave him with that man. No may l."
Ignoring the warning voice in his mind, he helped the omega out of the bathtub and wrapped him in a clean gray towel. He sat him on the toilet again and dried him carefully. He was already beginning to feel the soft vanilla smell of the Omega, but it was so faint that it was difficult to be sure, although Castiel thought it was a lovely smell that the boy gave off. At the moment he wasn't scared, or nervous.
Castiel walked away for a few seconds and returned with ice wrapped in a tablecloth to hand it to the Omega. "You have to press it to your eye and that will make the swelling go down," he explained, handing him the ice, and after a few seconds of doubt, the omega took it and put it in the right place. He leaned his head against the wall and closed his eyes.
Many Alphas did not consider it necessary to dress them, give them a decent life ... they felt like vomiting just thinking that Alastair could be in that category.
"You came back for me."
Dean wrapped the sheets tighter around himself, wanting to protect himself from the world, and Castiel, who had remained standing in the middle of the room watching him, seemed to remember where he was. He snapped back to reality and crossed the distance that separated him from Dean. In quick steps, he reached  the Omega.
"He has the mark. Did you run away, boy?" Another inquired, and this time Dean insisted on opening his eyes to see who was speaking.
Dean followed him with his eyes and just noticed the place where they were. It was like a large room, with no walls separating the spaces. For a moment it seemed devoid of privacy, but it also  seemed different and fun. It almost made him smile, if it wasn't for him being terrified.
He reluctantly folded the magazine and put it in its place. I wasn't going to read that.
"It isn't, Charlie. Dean wants to find his brother. And he's so scared of Alphas in general. He even looks me in the eye."
There was a living room with a gray sofa that looked very comfortable, in front of a large television. And a desk in the corner, with a glass table and many folders above, next to a laptop. What would this Alpha work on? Dean wondered distractedly. Alastair had a bar, where they sold fast food for lunch, but for dinner only alcohol. Dean bitterly remembered that bar, he didn't like it at all. Alastair sometimes forced him to help him with the tables, and the Alphas took advantage and touched him, caressed him, even worse things, but Alastier did not worry, he said that anything in order to serve his clients, and in the end he always they left a lot of tip.
He went to the kitchen cabinet and found some flu pills, picked up a glass of water and walked over to the bed, but Dean was sleeping soundly. Castiel didn't want to wake him up, he was probably resting for the first time in a long time. And Castiel himself was exhausted. It was already past two in the morning.
"A massage huh? Never really had one of those. Never had the opportunity." Dean's not really complaining. It's just a fact of his life.
Cas had once told him, his favorite part of being an angel was flying. It had to be awful not being able to do something you love because the ability was hindered by something fixable.
“Hello, Dean. Sam.” He smiles at them before placing the arm full of orange and yellow on the war room table. He leans in to peck Dean on the cheek and Dean’s face heats up. He doesn’t mind, but he’s still getting used to it. Especially in front of Sammy.
“I can’t retire, Cas.
“Well, it doesn’t matter.” Dean declares. “Even if you never get it all back, you have us.” He swallows harshly, knowing he's letting too much feeling seep into his words. But dammit, he needs Cas to know he's always welcome at the bunker.
Cas takes the money, but holds Dean’s hand in his grip and Dean feels frozen. For such gentle hands, their grip is unshakable. Cas reaches into his own pocket and produces a card, which he hands to Dean.
“Do you hate it?”
Dean frowns even though Cas can’t see. “Yea, I suppose it is. I haven’t checked actually.”
Cas keeps his massages going, getting Dean acquainted with his hand being down there, applying more pressure at times and others just grazing.
Dean smiles. “Just like you said. Relaxed.” Cas smiles back and they fall silent.
The eye lock continues far past what would be deemed socially acceptable. But that was the norm for the two of them. Looking in Cas’ eyes, Dean could be lost to the world. And it wouldn’t matter, because as Cas had just said, he’d protect Dean from anything.
"Its alright, Cas. We're gonna fix 'em."
Dean looks to him. “Well, that was a lot of fun. Usually Sam makes me be quiet during movies and he
for Dean to want him to stick around. He just wants Cas around. Cas is… his best friend and Dean wants to take care of him in any way he can. Just like he wants to take care of everybody else he cares about.
Dean is selfish. "And if I'm okay with continuing, knowing the- risks?" He raises his eyebrows for emphasis.
It’s like plush down. The softest blanket he’d never felt. He lightly rakes his hand through and feels the mishaps within the feathers. He doesn’t realize he’s smiling like a goof until he looks at Cas, who has a curious expression on his face. Dean drops his hand.
With his
now that the deed has been done.
After packing up the blanket and taking their seats in the Impala, Dean turns to Cas. “It worked, you know.”
But Dean has been given blow jobs and he thinks back on that experience now, recalling what he liked when he was on the receiving end. Everybody's different though and he also experiments, testing, seeing what brings the most groans out of Cas. He swirls his tongue, glides it up the length, alternates hard sucks that hollow his cheeks and seeing how far he can take Cas. He's new, so its not anything crazy. Through this onslaught of exploring, Cas' hand finds Dean's hair. He doesn’t hold him in place or restrict him but he does pull lightly on the strands when Dean does something he enjoys and Dean hums his approval each time.
“Are you sure there ain’t anything we can do to help with this? It doesn’t really seem right that you can just be uncomfortable by something that’s meant to help you.”
Cas, however, has no inhibitions and just- drops his wet pair from his body. Dean's eyes immediately snap in a different direction. Fuck! His train of thought reaches another hole in the tracks when he realizes Cas expects him to do the same. He pulled the shit out, he has to follow through. He and Cas are friends, right? Didn't friends change in the locker room or whatever? Dean wouldn't know, was never in school long enough to find out.
“Cut the crap, I know you need your wings groomed.” Dean decides beating around the bush has gotten him nowhere. Time for a new tactic. He's going to be straightforward and maybe even a little persistent. Well mostly straightforward. If Cas truly doesn't want this, there is nothing Dean can do.
"Dean, you’ve already done so much. Just this will help my grace replenish faster and I'll be back to normal in no time."
Cas breaks their silence an undetermined time later. "You have no idea what you mean to me. It could only be you."
Dean smiles knowing Cas can't see him. "I'm glad I could help. What's the next step?
The eighteen hours he goes without seeing Dean wrack him. He feels like his world has shifted. He’d never had such a conversation with the other inmates. Most of them preferred not to talk about their crimes and that was fine for the officers. It kept the peace and what little respect could be extended considering the circumstances.
Didn’t they already have this conversation? The bunker is Cas’ home. Cas had very much been present and accepting of that conversation. Why would Cas try and leave? Maybe the sex wasn’t as good for him as it was for Dean. Cas is an angel after all, probably has high expectations and all. A mere human couldn’t possibly compare to what heaven has to offer.
The hunt had taken much longer than either of them particularly planned and he was ready to visit dreamland.
Cas obliges, stepping inside and setting the pizza down, then looking around. Dean was definitely a college student. His apartment was neatly kept, but it was obvious his furniture was second hand and his rent was as cheap as he could get it. The apartment was tiny, all the main rooms small enough for Cas to see them clearly. It still looked nice. It wasn’t much different than Cas’ own.
"Stop fighting then." And it's like a switch flips in Cas. He turns sharply toward to Dean and Dean nearly falls over from the sudden shift under him.
This all sounds like quite a case of self defense. The father had been abusive and the older bother had stepped in.
The main event! In case you somehow missed all signs, formal warning: it gets explicit. *The mildly dubious consent comes into play here. Both characters experience a brain fog caused by 'hormones' but they both consent to the effects and their consequences. This chapter is also considerably longer.
When Cas breaks the kiss, he doesn’t pull away. He knocks their foreheads together. “I won’t leave you, Dean. I promise you. If you want me, if you want me to stay, I’m here.”
“Sammy, of course.” And he cracks a real smile. It looks surprisingly good on him. “Damn kid went to law school just for me. Became a partner, visited me every chance he could, fought tooth and nail through my last appeal. But the fact is, nobody cares about a guy who openly admitted he took an officer’s life. Sam did everything he could, but I never bought into it. I made my peace long ago about what I did and why I did it.” He’d been gazing around the room as he talked, but he looked Castiel dead in the eye when he said “and I’d do it all over again.”
He hears him before he sees him. They meet him in the war room and he’s carrying an assortment of
“Nothing happened, they just don’t have any rooms. So I’m gonna keep drivin’. Gonna need you to talk to me to keep from getting too comfortable behind the wheel. We’ll drive till we find another one.” He’s not usually this pushy, at least not with Cas, but he’s in no mood to argue. He starts the car before Cas can voice a complaint and whips back onto the freeway.
This is the very 'light angst.' It's also much shorter but I feel it wraps everything up nicely.
“Dean,” He starts tentatively. “I understand if this is something you wish to forget.”
By the time he gets back to the Impala, he’s resigned himself to just drive home. Or at least keep driving in the direction of home until they happen across another motel. He slams the door a little too roughly and winces internally, silently apologizing to Baby.
“Dean, do you understand? I need you to.”
Dean hadn’t known that. And boy he wished he had. This was just perfect. By some age old rule, Cas couldn’t actually refuse a legitimate offer. And hell, Dean was doing more than offering. He was insisting.
Dean already has a pretty good idea on what he needs to do but he doesn't want to let on how much he really looked into this. It seems kind of stalkerish. Also, he wouldn't mind conversation to keep his mind busy. So he just nods.
“Uh, what?” He stutters out.
“Uh, thanks, buddy. And I’m happy to do it.” Dean offers a smile while he continues working to dry the large appendages.
Dean rolls his eyes and groans. This was not how he wanted to spend his night. But it was Sammy’s birthday and Sam wanted them to get matching tattoos. Like fucking girls.
Cas extends his wings from his back to stretch them to the far corners of the room. As he does, he and his wings visibly shudder.
Dean was ready to get the fuck out before he said something stupid.
He feels Cas pull out his fingers again and regrets the loss immediately. He watches Cas reach back one more time and coat his dick in his own oil and the sight is one of the hottest things Dean’s ever laid eyes on. He's so fucking hard, it hurts. He's far enough gone that he could get off on the image alone if he allowed himself to.
When he reached the desk, Sam was already there, pulling out the piece of paper that had the sun shaped symbol on it. “Yea, we’re both getting it. It’s a family thing. Dean almost snorted.
Cas' hands begin moving, grazing his tummy, up to his chest and back. Everywhere Cas touches leaves a trail of goosebumps and heat. When Cas' hands come back around his front, one palms Dean's erection and Dean has to break the kiss to gasp. "Fuck."
The case had only been a few hours away from the bunker so Dean decided it was best to get the conversation started sooner rather than later. He decides to bring it up in the car since Cas wouldn't be able to escape or evade the conversation. They had plenty of time to get to the bottom of this.
. Dean thinks. Dean very much wishes he could get that haze back right now. Maybe this conversation would be easier. It seemed to turn off all of his conflicting emotions. “Anyway, thank you for taking care of my wings. I imagine they’ll be fully functioning in a matter of hours. And then I can go.
“Yea man, you mentioned your wings bothering you and I- I did a little research.” Dean looks down, hoping he hasn't overstepped a boundary here. And also a little flustered.
really feels. How this is an act reserved -albeit not exclusively- for lovers. All of his concerns seemed to fall to the back of his mind. Everything just seemed right in the world, Dean grooming Cas' wings.
Dean's memorial was a beautiful service.
Dean feels the weight of his machete as he watches the head of a vampire tumble to the ground. He whirles around to dispatch another but sees Cas beat him to it.
Cas reaches for something in the back seat and joins Dean a few moments later. It’s a blanket. The one Dean keeps in the back in case of emergency. Cas spreads the blanket out on the grass and looks to Dean, who cocks an eyebrow at him.
Sure, he and Cas had a profound bond or whatever, but that didn’t constitute sexual feelings. Angels didn’t even have sexual feelings. Right? Well they had something, since grooming each other’s wings was apparently sexual. And Cas never denied angels have sex, just that he personally had never had reason to engage. Weren’t they all related somehow anyway?
Dean was planning to attempt to keep everything rated PG, maybe PG-13. He didn't want to make things awkward or weird between he and Cas. Of course… he was still willing. He wasn’t about to admit all the reasons he was willing but he was willing nonetheless. He was pretty sure he wouldn't need to worry about that anyway. Just because Dean was willing, didn't mean his winged best friend was. As much as Dean may hope, there was just no way Cas looked at him that way.
"Dean, please." Cas is breathless. Dean
“Your shirt. I can’t work with it in the way.” Dean once more glances over to Sam, to find his shirt off and his brother conversing easily with the man giving him his own ink. “Is there an issue?” Cas asks in a lower voice. He sounds genuinely concerned and Dean rushes to reassure him.
“Okay asshole.” Dean recovers quickly, but Cas is still grinning. He leans in again and presses a chaste kiss to Dean’s lips. Its quick and easy. And Dean's heart explodes with happiness. Dean’s going to want this for the rest of his life, he knows it. His want clouds his brain. “Yea, I want you.” He whispers, answering Cas' earlier statement.
“Your plan to get me to relax. I didn’t even realize something as simple as star gazing could be the answer.”
When it’s over, Castiel keeps his eyes on Sam. The man bangs a fist on the glass softly before turning away and heading out of the room. The rest of the witnesses follow suit.
He just needed to convince Cas to let him help.
"Do you feel safe? You have to tell me if I'm doing something wrong, or if I need to do it better. I know I'm no angel, Cas."
need a break?
“So what do you need me to do?” Dean wasn’t sure how a human could possibly be of assistance with such a matter. Cas had never asked this before. Didn’t he usually just fix them with his grace? Oh, but wasn’t Cas’ grace failing?
Dean can do this. He’s been shirtless in front of men countless times. No need to stand on ceremony now.
His mind whirled with the little bit of information he had been given and the questions he now had. It wasn’t that Dean was unwilling, oh he was willing, but he had no idea how to first broach the topic with his winged best friend and second if Cas was even willing. Surely Cas didn’t feel that way about Dean which is why he had told Dean in the first place there was nothing to be done.
“Well, how about we get started.” He tries for nonchalance.
“Huh.” Dean ponders, smiling. He smirks and waves Cas over to the couch in the small living room. “Guest’s choice for movie pick.” And he plops down on the worn black leather.
. Cas wasn’t small. It was baffling how much that damn trench coat hid. Dean had been missing out.
“You’ll start with pulling out any feathers that seem loose, the shower should have helped with loosening them even more. They should come out easily. Don’t worry about pulling healthy ones out, they won’t break off.”
Cas looks at him softly, but tilts his head in question.
“No, I don’t hate. It was just a shock. I actually kind of… like it. A lot.” He smiles at Cas, his hands resting on his shoulders, searching his blue eyes.
"Yes?"
is everywhere. On every conceivable surface. Pumpkins, leaves, yellows, oranges, little Hobby Lobby signs that
After rinsing the other wing and grabbing towels for he and Cas, the ache in his back is brought to his attention. Right. Standing like that must have took a toll on his muscles and joints. He ignores his aches and sets about patting the wings dry.
“Hey, I thought you weren’t in my head.”
"Gentle sounds nice."
Cas flashes him a whole mouth smile and Dean is reminded of the fact that he is chest naked.
Dean Winchester, like most inmates, looked unassuming and resigned to his fate as he ate a greasy cheeseburger with fries. He’d even managed to convince them to serve him a slice of pie for dessert as well. Castiel isn’t surprised. In the few instances he’d been around Dean, the man was surprisingly charismatic. He knew what he could and couldn’t away with, and more specifically who he could get away with it.
in tattoos. There was no way Dean could catalog every single one, but one of the more prominent ones was on his forearm. A large dreamcatcher, with intricate work done on the ropes and the dangling pieces. It was bathed in rainbow colors like the man had a constant light reflection on his arm.
Dean's brain haze answers for him, more truthfully than he would have ever been. "I want you to take care of me." Cas' gaze somehow gets softer.
“That hardly seems like a capital offense. What were the circumstances?”
Cas pauses his work to let him speak. “I’m fine, it’s not my first rodeo.” Cas actually raises his eyebrows.
They don’t speak, preferring to remain in their heads.
After deciding on good ole fashioned cold pizza, Dean heads to bed himself and forces his mind quiet. It had been a long day and he's tired. It only takes a few minutes before his routine works and he falls into dreamless sleep.
“It would appear so.” Cas answers with absolutely none of the inhibitions Dean has. No panting, no sweating, no sore muscles. Cas can also just lift his hand and obliterate monsters. Dean's not bitter. Cas regards him a little more intently and without a word approaches him.
With a smile on his own face, he starts the Impala to head home, thinking about how nice it could be to come across another ‘No Vacancy’ sign.
Dean clears his throat. “It’s fine, uh, it’s not that big a deal.” Dean leans in closer and takes a deep breath, trying to identify all the notes. “Kinda smells like spice. And honey.”
Dean’s face flames at Cas’ words. He’s… touched. Sure, Sammy had tried to get him to talk about feelings over the years, but Dean just wasn’t a touchy-feely type person. Not the mental kind anyway.
“Yea, whatever. Bitch. Happy Birthday.” And he cracks smile.
“Hang on!” He hears from the other side of the door, the sound of heavy foot falls like somebody is running.
Dean nods, not trusting his voice.
Dean shrugs. “It was a while ago.”
"I think I can do that." Cas presses a searing kiss to his lips. "But this is new territory for both of us if I'm correct and I need you to tell me if something isn't good, or if I should do something different. Do you understand?"
He spreads some more around and then, like a kid, proceeds to move himself around to catch the rainbow shines.
Cas doesn’t hesitate. It’s like what Dean said, he’s been waiting to hear. “Then I’ll be here.” And he says it so resolutely, Dean believes him immediately. They have a spotty track record, but Cas has made it a point in the last few years, to not lie to Dean. That whole God stint is more or less behind them, and aside from it, Cas has never given Dean a reason not to trust him.
“Is there anything you can do? To combat it I mean. Any spell or something to manually boost your grace’s replenishment rate?”
"Where's it comin' from?"
be doing.” That’s just how it was. It had been engrained in him that he needed to hunt and save lives to be useful. Taking a break completely defeated the purpose. Jokingly he says, “The only way I’d be able to take a break was if I didn’t know I was taking a break.”
Cas’ wings have rainbows in them.
The placement was a good one. It wasn’t so good, he could nod off, but it was bearable. Dean kept his breathing steady and though he couldn’t fall asleep, he did eventually close his eyes.
He looks to Sam ready to ask him, but at that moment, Cas walks in.
voice and truth be told, Dean was glad Sammy wasn’t around to see this because Dean was powerless to whatever was about to come out of his angel’s mouth. “It’s a beautiful day outside.” Cas says with a lot of emphasis.
Cas’ smile doesn’t falter. “Of course I do. But we’re not living in medieval times any more, Dean.” And he
The only silver lining, if it could even be called that, was that the case had only been a couple hours from the bunker. So after dispatching the hell spawn and cleaning up their mess, Dean, Sam and Cas had headed home, with Dean’s foot heavy on the gas.
They climb out and Dean walks a few paces towards the lake. The fresh air that hits him is crisp and light. It’s a safe feeling. He can hear the night bugs in the background and there’s a faint breeze. The night isn’t too still and overall feels alive, in the best kind of way.
And that's it! Feel free to drop a comment on how it was, I'm new at this and would love feedback.
After an hour or so, Dean starts yawning. Often.
Guilt floods him immediately. He knocks his forehead against Cas’ and pulls Cas’ hands from his face to hold them. “I’m being a jerk, I’m sorry. Of course we can go.” He pulls back and the smile that graces his face is genuine. “I’m a man of my word, if anything.”
While gathering clothes and a towel up for himself he hears the ping of his phone and sighs inwardly, guessing its Sam.
"Beautiful." He murmurs, slowly losing his grasp on his thoughts.
“Looks great, man, thanks.” He tells Cas when he gets back to the chair.
“I’m good, I’m good.” But he yawns again and knows he going to lose this battle pretty quick.
chooses Star Wars. Maybe I should replace him with you. Movie watching companion, I mean.”
“And what about after?” He whispers.
Cas hums, thoughtful. “You like the combination of sweet and spicy.”
“Jack helped. But he got called back to Heaven. He’ll be back soon.”
"Dean." Cas groans out and Dean takes that as encouragement to continue. He's only ever been given blow jobs, never given one. In fact, this is his first time being so close to another man's dick… ever. Dean had never let this part of his sexuality see the light of the day. Better late than never, he figures. If there's anybody he's going to explore this with, he's glad it's Cas. Even if it's going to ruin him for anybody else, man or woman.
Cas let’s out a shuddering breath but starts to move. He starts slow and shallow, his face buried in Dean’s neck, drawing in harsh breaths. But eventually he picks up pace, needing more. They both moan when he pulls all the way out only to plunge straight back in.
They don't say much else and Dean continues to work, Cas moving his wings this way and that when it seems fitting. He's pretty sure Cas is breathing harder than normal, and even fidgeting. If his wings shuddering are anything to go by. Dean figures he must be doing it right, otherwise Cas would say something. Right?
Dean already knows what Cas is referring to. It's been a constant battle in his mind for a day now. He's still unsure how to broach the topic, for fear of Cas pulling away or outright shutting him down.
It’s a question but Cas seems to know the answer already. Dean shakes his head slightly anyway.
“Dean? Is something wrong?” Dean hadn’t realized he’d gone still in his observation.
Dean’s face heats up.
But for now, Dean pulls himself together. He flashes a smile he
In the witness room, the atmosphere is silent and tense. There’s an abnormally tall man with shoulder length hair looking at the chamber with a somber expression. His eyes appear to be red and the handkerchief that should be in his black suit pocket is clutched in one hand.
Cas stares at him. And Dean eventually shifts uncomfortably under his intense gaze. So much for Cas not looking at him. It was like Cas was scrutinizing him on a microscopic level. And who knows? Maybe he was. He had seen Dean’s soul after all. He was a celestial being. Being able to examine something more thoroughly than any human would ever be able seemed to come with the territory.
Cas drops his hand and looks to Dean. Dean looks back and his… feelings swell. He never thought he could feel such peace just looking at stars with his best friend. His
When he’s sure he’s plucked all the problem feathers, he drops his hands, looking around his bed and the floor. It’s littered with black feathers.
"Dean, I'm under no qualms here. I am well aware of your preferences and this next part is not something you can just fight. It's a chemical reaction between you and I, and we are both powerless if it reacts- positively. We are close, just like you said. And I don't want this to ruin our friendship."
Dean frowns. “That short for something?”
“Star Wars.” Cas grasps the first thing that comes to mind. Apparently it was the right answer. Dean’s giddy response is downright adorable.
Sam was Dean’s only family.
They find an empty picnic table to eat at and Dean warns Cas to never tell a single soul that he shared his pie with him. Dean had an image to uphold, even when Cas complained. “Dean, there’s no way you could have eaten that all by yourself, anyway, whats it matter?”
Castiel nodded. "Thank you, officer. We'll look into it."
"I'm coming." Cas rapidly turned around and got out of the rooms quick as he could.
"Someone is hurting my tree." Castiel groaned, trying to stand up. "We have to go back to the forest."
"Heard about him," a woman told him. "His entire family were hunters. They died on a hunt. Except for Dean who disappeared after that. Why?"
To Castiel’s surprise, Dean wrapped an arm around his waist. “I’d like a minute to talk with my husband.”
"I'm almost done," Castiel said behind him. "Okay. It’s done." A big cloud of smoke rose from the bowl they were using, making Castiel cough.
Dean looked up at him, eyebrows furrowed. “You need not ask, you know. You already finished?”
"Castiel! There you are."
_____________________________________________
"What?"
"Sorry." Dean rubbed his eyes. "Reflex. How much time passed?"
I could stay for once, he thought while picking up a shirt that was lying on the floor. The one called Sam seemed sympathetic. He could try showing the other one—Dean, he thinks—that he doesn’t mean them any harm.
“I have never seen any human in the forest before. Just heard stories from the other dryads.” Castiel said in the middle of their conversation. The other dryads always told him that humans only entered the forest to destroy their trees.
"What, no? Dean, you weren't the one chopping down my tree."
"How are you still alive?"
“You aren't supposed to drink that.” Dean chuckled. The dryad seemed even more confused. “You pour it around your tree to protect it.”
"Maybe you can move into my dorm?" Dean asked as he was still wiping his tears. Hearing this Castiel's eyes lighted up.
"Right, I remember. My whole body hurts," he said as he stood up. Castiel looked back down at Dean’s lap, seeming to realize something.
"Castiel Novak. Sorry for being late." Castiel answered.
Dean blinked at her and smiled before nodding. Right before opening the door he told Ellen, “You should do the same with Bobby.” The healer had never blushed so hard in her entire life.
“All right. Just take some of them. Please, be quick.” The dryad sighed. Dean strongly thanked the dryad. While Dean took the leaves, he heard the dryad wincing behind him.
Castiel still hadn't found the matches and was currently taking out objects from a drawer.
Reluctantly, Castiel walked toward the chair and sat on it. Dean was right next to Sam, staring at him and waiting for answers.
“Do you want to come with us? I have what we need in my home.” Dean asked Castiel. Castiel asked Claire if she was okay with going to the Winchester’s house. For only answer, Claire nodded.
"Well, our ways separate here," Dean told Castiel.
“No, this makes complete sense. He needed the blanket, which resulted in him spooking the horse,” replied Dean.
"Rowena?" Dean asked.
It was the one Dean had brought a few months ago, the one he suspected to be Cas. He stopped right in front of the hunter and started to write something in the ground with his hoof. CASTIEL.
"This is very heart-warming, but you should go back to your house. And I need my beauty sleep." Rowena told them.
“It’s a potion for protection,” Dean told him. The dryad looked at him and the potion back and forth.
It had been a complete disaster. They found Sam after having killed some vampires that were between them and the cells. However, as they tried to get out as quickly they could, they encountered some monsters.
"I gave you a potion for protection and look at what happened. It didn't work."
Dean. The other agent was Dean. And now, Castiel's headache was back.
Castiel passed out the moment they passed Dean's house threshold.
"What the hell are you?"
Alerted by the noises, they had found Dean, Sam and Castiel. Dean and Sam had looked at Castiel for a few seconds. When they heard a muffled bang, they had turned around. Castiel had been lying on the floor having been hit on the head. Seeing this, Dean had launched himself at Castiel’s assailant without thinking.
-1 week later
"I just wanted to talk."
And for Cas, well, it was his first time hunting at all. He trusted Dean and he knew that he wouldn’t use him as bait at the first occasion. Yet anxiety overwhelmed him. If anyone got hurt or worse, killed, it would be his fault.
"No idea. It seems like there was no reason behind this murder. I'm sorry. I didn't find anything else."
"Sorry." Dean stepped back, but still held Castiel's hands. "I don't know about you but I feel like celebrating this win. And perhaps creates some fake IDs afterward. Maybe a house?"
Castiel smiled at him. It had been a while for him too. “Yes, the company is...not unpleasant."
“Claire is a calm kid but the same thing happened to me this morning.” Castiel laughed.
Castiel took a look at the (corpse's) neck. There was nothing that could indicate a murder."Maybe a ghost?" Castiel proposed.
"All right, all right." They both went to the Impala; Dean had refused to climb into Castiel's car.
"Oh, crap. I forgot about that." Dean sighed. Jack had grown a lot lately and so had his tree. Unlike the rest of the dryads, leaves were missing from his hair. And he was a curious young boy. A bit too much if you asked Dean. Jack had multiple times touched potions and ingredients. Once, almost making a potion explode by adding new ingredients.
"I was friends with those people. What's wrong with them?!" Castiel shouted as he tried to find anything that could help him fight back.
“I’m sorry, I should have listened to you. Well, let’s bring you to your room.”
After thirty minutes of waiting, Castiel decided to go back inside.
"Castiel. We know you have spells from the book of the damned. Whatever it is, it's not worth it. Either you give it to us voluntarily or we'll take it by force." One of the hunters warned him. Not knowing what to do or say, Castiel looked at Dean for help.
"I would love to. But are you sure it's safe?" Right. It won't be a good idea for Castiel to wander in the human world, but his house was close enough to the forest to be safe for Castiel, and it was getting late. With luck, they wouldn't get noticed.
"Yes. And, as you might have guessed, I survived." He chuckled.
"No, I don't want to bother you." Charlie headed toward the exit of the cave. Castiel sighed and turned toward Dean.
Castiel hurried up to finish the spell as quickly as he could. Dean grabbed his gun and hid behind the door, ready to defend himself and Castiel.
"You did that yourself?" Dean asked, pointing to a table made out of branches.
It took them a bit of time to expand the garden. But with Castiel's power and the help of Charlie, things worked out well in the end.
“Not yet.”
The first three weeks went by quickly and without any problem. Castiel and Dean were constantly together and, Lucifer left Castiel alone. However, this didn't last long. Apparently, Lucifer thought it was hilarious to prank Castiel. The morning after Castiel got stuck outside his dorm, only wearing his boxers, he decided that he needed to find another roommate.
"That was one of the hunters I worked with to destroy the book of the damned. They must have somehow seen me photograph the spell."
Once Castiel finally had a car - it was a large, grey car, more discreet than the previous one - they headed back to their motel. Castiel arrived first.
"You're just going to stand there and watch?" The man asked out of nowhere, turning towards Castiel.
"It went better than I thought," Dean said with a grin on his face.
"Yes. Thank you.” Castiel grinned up at Dean. “So, what fake job are we pretending to have this time?"
how Dean would react when he learned that Castiel was a kelpie, or that intruders had kidnapped Sam and he hadn’t done anything?
"We agreed to burn the book. No one should have access to it. It could be a catastrophe. " Castiel nodded, but his phone in his coat pocket had never felt so heavy.
"Yeah, sounds like our kind of thing. Want something to eat, by the way?"
"Oh, fuck," he muttered.
“Come on, Dean. I know you. I can see you’re worried about something.”
After hearing these words, Dean ran as fast as he could, despite Castiel being in the same house as him. Before he could enter the room where Castiel was resting, Ellen grabbed him by the arm.
“Soooo, Castiel. Why didn’t you leave last night?” Next to him, Sam frowned.
A few weeks had passed since the meeting between Castiel and Dean; and, for some reason, Castiel couldn't stop thinking about it. Something wasn't right. But what was it?
"So, some male dryads can become pregnant?" Castiel nodded.
Castiel chuckled before he remembered their situation and sighed."We should add some more protection. They’re probably still after us."
"Sure." Castiel searched for the lever to pop the hood, then got out of his car to look at it with him.
"What the hell?"
On their way to the Winchester's house, Ben and Claire stopped crying thanks to Castiel giving them their chocolate eggs.
“Sam! Castiel!” he shouted as he opened the door to the room where Cas had been living these last months. He almost expected them to jump from a hiding place and scream Surprise! It didn’t happen.
"You should take a nap," Castiel said, ignoring Dean's question.
Pointing his sword to Castiel’s throat, he shouted, “What happened? Where is Sam? Did you hurt him? I knew that we shouldn’t have trusted you.”
"I'm sorry about what happened. That was my fault." Castiel lifted his head and looked at Dean, his brows furrowed.
A few hours? The longer he waited, the longer they risked never seeing Sam again, or at least never seeing Sam alive again.There didn’t seem to be another choice, though.
Dean shouldn’t have brought Castiel here in the first place. He had never hunted anyone or anything in his life. Castiel had informed him that once, when he was a kid, his father had shown him how he killed humans. Castiel had refused to go with him to any human hunt or to eat humans again. His parents and the rest of his family hadn’t taken it well. Dean knew that.
"It's okay. I propose we go tonight to the lake." Dean said.
"I used to pass my time here when I was a kid. Found it a long time ago with a friend."
something you want to mess with."
During the night, Castiel couldn't sleep at all. The sound of fire trucks was the only thing he was hearing and he could only hope that Dean and his family were safe.
"So, what do you wanna know?" Dean asked.
"Ok, ok, I get it. Let's run away." Dean started the Impala, keeping an eye on the blue car. He saw the other man coming out of the station, realizing that he got tricked.
Everything about him was odd, from sleeping naked in a stable to frowning at the food they’d provided him. Jeez, he hoped he could get his clothes back soon. The clothes weren’t even Castiel’s size.
"I don't know what's going on, and I'm not taking any chances. I'm not putting the gun away until you’ve answered everything."
"Great!" The other boy said with a huge smile that revealed a missing baby tooth. "I'm Dean." He said as he extended his arm through the gate.
"What's going on?" Castiel asked.
"Did you have to ruin this moment?" Castiel groaned, making Dean laugh. And with that, they were back on the road in Dean's car and with the music very loud. They had no idea where they were going, and for the first time in a long time, Dean felt comfortable and relaxed.
“Right, like you don’t have a soft spot for Ellen.” Dean made Bobby blush, which rarely happened. Bobby would often pretend to be sick so he could see the healer. She must have noticed a long time ago. Dean suspected that Ellen wasn’t saying anything because she also had a soft spot for him.
"Well, actually I wanted to tell you something. You may need to sit down."
"Hey, I'm sorry for waking you up. I made you this." Dean gave him the potion. "It will ease your pain."
"I'm sorry. This will probably won't lead us anywhere." Castiel said as he stretched. Right at this moment, they heard someone calling in the distance. "Well, never mind."
“Even better! You stole a horse!” Sam couldn’t believe it. He should have done it himself, even if it meant walking.
Dean looked up from his drawing and frowned at Castiel.
"It threw fire at us when we tried to burn it," Castiel said, making Dean chuckle.
For a few seconds, Castiel didn't say anything. Now that had an answer, he also had a lot more questions. He also remembered where he had seen that face. It was in an old photo in black and white. In the photo was a group of hunters, and one of them was Dean.
_____________________________________________
“Gabriel! What the hell are you doing here?” Castiel shouted after hearing Dean’s high pitched scream. Seeing the only brother that he was close to after all those years would have been good news, but not now when he was naked from head to toe, in bed.
“Family,” Castiel answered, still reading the book in front of him. This would be more difficult than Dean had thought.
"Actually, yes," Dean said as he got out of the car and stretched his legs. "Wait. I think it worked." He searched for anything sharp he could find. There was surprisingly nothing like that in the glove compartment or his pockets.
“Why didn’t you tell Sam?”
"Happy to see you too." Dean chuckled. He sat down next to Castiel and put his head on his shoulder.
"Castiel? What are you doing here?"
"Dean?" He asked. Dean flinched at the sound. "Do you like it? Hunting?"
“Sam...”
Sam had tried to stop her, knowing that under no circumstances it was a good idea to wake Dean this way. But Alex, pleased with the good news, hadn’t paid attention to what he said.
"Hey, I found a case. Or...something that looks like a case anyway." Castiel called out.
With every minute who passed, Castiel was getting more and more nervous. Did he figured everything out? Or at least that he was a monster like he said? Next time he won't follow humans. If there is a next time. At some point, Castiel stood up and put the book away.
“Sure. You didn’t hang me by the feet too the first time. Do you have any idea of what we could do?” Dean asked, smiling at him. Castiel smiled in return and told Dean to follow him. He did so, a bit slowly because he fell from the tree. They arrived next to Castiel's tree. Castiel took something from the ground.
“They’re dangerous. Some of them will eat your heart, some others will take your appearance after they kill you.” Castiel was staring at him, his eyes wide and hands clinging to the edges of the dinner table.
Sam and Dean turned their heads toward him at the same time.
He moved to the next one and this time there was a voice on the other side. They were speaking about him.
"Oh, shut up."
Castiel stared at him as he counted his story. As he was studying his face a bit longer, he realized that it was covered in freckles.
"What's going on?" Castiel asked, his stomach in knots. The look on his parent's faces when they saw him could only be described as worried.
Castiel was running down the corridor as fast as he could. His first day of college and he was already late. The corridors didn't seem to have an end. Classroom number 301, 302, 303. Here it is, classroom number 304!
The only exception was when they needed to eat but even then they would only take one human. He wished he could stop and observe how all this worked. However, finding Missouri and rescuing Sam were their priorities.
“Dean, the first thing he did when he woke up was ask for you. If you have feelings for him, and I know you do, tell him. Understood?”
It took them almost a week to realize that Gabriel had left the nest. Dean couldn’t imagine not having his brother around. In return, Dean told him about his parents, how his mom had died and how his dad had started to hunt with him and Sam.
Maybe they are those paranoid kinds of humans, doing everything to protect themselves from demons. Castle smiled and turned around. I’m safe; he thought as he closed his eyes, ready to sleep.
Cas arrived at the spot where he was supposed to meet Dean, noticing his victory in arriving first.
“You know I hate you, sometimes?” Dean asked.
“Hey, squirt. I found something to help you.” He said as he handed Ella the potion.
“Can, you tell me what they look like?” The question stops his train of thought. He wasn’t aware that Missouri and Dean had continued to talk.
“Nothing.” Castiel answered.
Castiel heard the other hunters coming towards them. They must have heard Dean.
With what Alex recounted to them, it was clear that she didn’t want to go back. At the same time, they had no idea how to get in that castle without being noticed or how to get to Sam, hopefully still alive.
"Can you give me the ginger powder?" Dean chuckled.
"Not yet. I don't think we're going to find anything until we're on our own." Castiel answered. They had already planned to come back at night. But for now, they needed to know as much as they could about this house, i.e.how to get in and get out as quickly as possible and any supernatural activities that may be present.
The process took way too long to Dean's liking. He tried to hurry up when he heard Castiel call him.
“Oh come on, I’m sure that cheated this time!”
Dean shook his head, seemingly disappointed.
"Nice to meet you too. Castiel told me a lot about you." Charlie said, grinning. Behind Dean, Castiel mouthing at Charlie to shut up.
As the time passed, Castiel slowly but surely was getting better. However, he was growing frustrated that he would often need Dean to help with simple things.
"You should go see Rowena, she would be able to help Castiel," Charlie told Dean as they replanted the branches. Dean nodded in answer.
"Do I have to remind you that there are people after us; and, unlike you, I CAN DIE," Castiel shouted back.
It took a few days for Castiel to find him and where he was staying, but even then he still had no idea how to contact him as he only had the number to Dean’s old phone. The only solution was to drive to Dean's motel and hope he would still be here when Castiel arrived.
"Nothing. Just wanted to show you something."
“We could always escape.” Dean laughed as he helped Castiel hide the weapons in the Impala. “Won’t be my first time.” Dean grabbed his phone to search for the closest mechanic. Once they called the mechanic, Dean waited with Castiel, both of them sitting next to the car.
"Thanks! I'll go ask my parents!" Castiel ran back inside and hoped his mom and dad were going to say yes. He had no friends in the neighborhood, and Castiel couldn't wait to play with Dean.
Castiel took a deep breath and started his car. The sooner he dealt with it, the better. After driving for a day and a sleepless night, Castiel finally arrived in front of the motel Dean was staying in. He looked at the motel before driving away and drove to the closest dinner. He needed to think about it a bit more.
It was Dean who opened the door and leaned on it. The hunter stared at his shoes for a bit. He didn't seem to have any weapon on him.
It was dark when Walt saw two people running towards a house. One of them opened the door, looking around before locking it. Walt made a sign to Roy to follow him and approached the house. He took a look through one of the windows.
“Thank you very much. I got you some things for you too. I brought you some books. I didn't know what you like, however.” Dean handed his bag in return. Most of the books Dean owned were about witchcraft, mainly potions. But he still found a few fictions. Castiel took a look at the books, his eyes wide open.
"Dean? Are you all right?" Castiel asked, putting his hand on Dean's arm.
"Ooooh, what is it?"
"Castiel!!!" Dean shouted, immediately kneeling next to Cas.
Dean hadn’t said a word since they had gotten on their horses. It seemed he was keeping an eye on Alex so she couldn’t betray them, but Castiel knew better. With the seconds, minutes and hours that passed, Dean would fear the worst more and more. He had already lost his mother and his father. He couldn’t lose someone else, especially not Sam. Dean had raised his brother on his own.
"Dean?" Castiel asked his hope that Dean would be free of the curse.
"He's napping in his tree. His tree is grown enough now." Castiel said, calmly.
Dean, Sam, and Ellen’s daughter Jo had made bets on how long it would take them to get together. Jo had said three years, Sam had insisted it would be five, and Dean wagered longer than five years. He had won. Now that he’s thinking of it, they should really do something about it.
"Been a hunter for a while." Dean chuckled. "Alright Castiel, let's get rid of him and get out of here."
When Dean And he promised to not bring any horse he found on the way. Suddenly a sound got him out of his daydream. He looked outside while trying to not touch the window. He could see a silhouette in front of the main door. It was probably Sam. It won't be the first time the hunter would get out and look at the sky. Castiel lays back in bed, desperately trying to get some sleep.
“I’m sorry. I should have remained in my room,” he said, trying to explain himself. As he opened the door to leave, he heard someone cough behind him.
"Moving on!" Dean said after another silence.
"I am sorry, Dean. We won't bother any longer." Castiel told Dean.
"We lose nothing.
________________________________________________________________________
“You are telling the truth?” The dryad repeated.
It was better than hunters, at least. They could be peaceful witches and maybe nothing awful would happen to him.
"Dean. You're not gonna like it, but if we're being followed, we're going to need to get rid of them
"I'm a bad Omega," Dean revealed, lowering his eyes even more, now he didn't look at the scars, he was embarrassed, they were nothing more than a confirmation that he was a bad Omega. Alastair always reminded him.
"I can't lose it, Charlie," she whispered before beginning to feel the tears in her eyes.
"That’s very good" Castiel praised, satisfied. "Continue."
"You can eat it." offered the alpha "I'm going to get mine"
"You better cover yourself, you still have  a bit of fever ..." the Alpha said and approached causing Dean to wrapped his arms tighter around his stomach, shaking even more, if that was possible.
"I ran away, but I repented and wanted to return." he started, stuttering and nervous, but didn't stop. "I wanted to come back right away." Castiel nodded, following the thread. “But I got lost. I didn't know the city ”
"You ran away, you wanted to go back. Right away, that's important. But you were in another city, you didn't know, you got lost, you wandered until you reached the service station. ” Castiel repeated.
In the places he’s straightened, that are looking pretty perfect if Dean says so, he notices a dark liquid leaking from somewhere in the large appendages.
want to retire, but he just… couldn’t. There were too many monsters to hunt, too many lives to save. It just wasn’t in the cards for somebody like Dean. He had Cas and he had Sammy, he was fine.
at Dean and Dean’s pretty sure he melts on the spot.
“Yea, well he’s not.” Sam interrupts. “So quit bein’ a wuss, stop your bitchin’, and lets go.” He saunters to the door, not looking back to see if Dean is following, knowing his words hit the spot.
A small woman approaches the tall man with a notepad and pen. “You must be Sam.” She says with a familiar tone. Her hands move in sign language while she talks.
Cas catches on easily. “I see. I’m sorry for your loss.”
Suspicion confirmed.
Castiel should probably think his answer through. A memorial is tough any way you look at it. But he knew his answer as soon as Sam had asked. “I would.”
They move slowly, this being a new experience for both of them. They break apart and come back together until they have a sinuous rhythm between the two of them. Dean picks the pace up and uses his own mouth to open Cas' more to deepen the kisses. Cas complies and surprises Dean when he swipes his tongue through Dean's mouth. Dean's mind falls deeper into that haze and he groans into Cas' mouth at the sensation. And it’s the best he's ever had. All they're doing is kissing, getting to the borderline of making out, and it’s the best he's ever had. The best he's ever going to have.
"Cause collars always protect us, right, Hector?" Jacob asked sharply. And the one mentioned under the gaze.
Hello! how are they? Are they staying at home or are they the ones who have to go out despite everything? I hope they are well, and that the people who love them too.
"I trust you," he whispered with fear, yes, but also with hope.
"Do you like it?" Castiel asked.
"How do you feel?" he questioned. Dean looked better than when he had arrived, but that didn't mean he looked good. Not at all, he was still too pale, his eye puffy, and he was breathing hard.
Dean sniffed the air, looking for any sign of threat, but there was nothing. Only the concern he had felt from the beginning, but even so he lowered his eyes, showing respect, he knew that Alphas are never looked directly in the eyes.
"Lo calenté de nuevo. ¿Crees que si te acompaño podemos comer juntos?" Preguntó, pero no era una pregunta porque vertió el sabroso líquido en los platos y dejó la olla vacía a un lado, sobre la cama. Luego le sonrió a Dean, como si fuera un niño en su cumpleaños, y comenzó a comer la sopa.
Dean tried very carefully and he almost succeeded, but he let out an uncontrolled scream at the end, unable to bear it any longer.
"I-I'm here, I need to go and you have to come with me, please"
She approached him sweetly."I know, dear. That's why we'll leave it here. But leave it alone. It hasn't stolen anything."
"Somebody shut up that crazy man, please" the other Alpha shouted. Two security men appeared and threatened to approach Castiel, but Charlie acted quickly and stopped them.
Castiel pressed his arms against her body. And he remembered that that was a typical Dean posture. Many times she had seen him doing it, those days he was at home, he did it when he felt fear, when he felt vulnerable, just like Castiel felt now. Terrified of not being able to do anything to fulfill his promise.
They watched them take off their clothes, bathe, and controlled the time. But no Omega was there for over eight minutes, no one seemed willing to see the consequences of that.
This woman, on the other hand, seemed to be much smarter and more demanding than those who had visited him before. Somehow she made him afraid.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean watched him scared and confused. What were the chances that this Alpha won't try anything with it? Almost none. He was so terrified that he almost wanted him to do it at once, to end the waiting moment. It was like when he wanted Alastair to hit him at once to end the previous fear. He knew the blow and pain was coming, so why wait? The same happened with this Alpha.
"Sir, you can't mistreat Omegas in this place," said the Omega, his voice firm. "I have permission to enforce the rules of my company."
"It is legal," Castiel admitted, still in a weak and apologetic tone. "Do you think Alastair would accept that?"
Hey! We have a new chapter! Sorry if the wait was long, I was a bit blocked, but now I have even written much more for the next!
"Déjame calentarlo" el Alfa apareció de la nada, parado a su lado y agarrando el plato, y Dean entró en pánico. Era una trampa, él lo supo todo el tiempo.
"You will be fine," Castiel reassured standing in front of him. "I…"
Dean fell to the floor, protecting his stomach with one hand and his head with the other.
But Castiel confused him, didn't give him many clues about how he should behave.
They led him to what looked like a truck parked outside, but before they approached it, someone's screaming stopped them.
It's not like he had an interest in being out there, anyway. It was ugly, dark and wet anywhere in the System Facility. There were screams from the detained Omegas, and from angry officials.
Castiel could surely aspire to a better Omega. There was no point in loving Dean.
"You can use this, it is a very relaxing and refreshing Aloe gel ..." he handed the gel tube but Dean made no move to grab it, instead he stared at the Alpha, startled by how enthusiastic he was, trying to help him stared at the energy that the Alpha put into it. As if he really cared.
"I'm coming," he yelled in return and turned to Dean.
"Dude, the last time I saw you, you were going to court to please your father, and that was four days ago. How much can happen in four days?" She asked, visibly confused.
"Hey, what’s your name?" The Omega shook him a little and Dean seemed to regain consciousness.
"Leave it, don't mess, Roger,"the young woman with the Alpha intervened. She smelled soft as a beta, and looked just as carefree as the betas Dean knew, and she didn't wear a collar.
Dean stared at him in puzzlement.
Castiel left it casually on the couch when he realized that Dean was not going to grab it with his hands. Beside that tube he placed another blue one, with a rare name in white letters.
"Let's take care of him" agreed Castiel, not knowing what to say. "Do you want me to call someone?" he questioned.
Castiel continued to spread gel over the bruised ribs and he covered some of the other wounds with white cream so that they would heal better. When he finished he helped the omega dress in his clothes, a pair of boxers he didn't wear much, cotton pants and a blue short sleeved shirt.
"I can't let them catch me, they ... they ..." His eyes glazed over at the thought of the punishment they would give him for running away.
"You are in section 14."
He checked through a folder and checked some papers, until he looked up.
"I'm going to look for you, Dean" he whispered to the wind.
The first thing was to wait for him on his knees when he came back home. Dean knew that pose very well, it was one of Alastair's favorites. Dean was always waiting for him kneeling on the floor, looking at his hands, near the front door. When Alastair entered he would pick him up by the collar and indicate what he wanted him to do first. Serve dinner, present, or some other activity.
"That’s him?" The man asked, an Alpha,  Dean could smell his scent.
Alpha, Alphas in general had stronger odors, and the smell of anger and anger of this one was suffocating him.
Castiel was a lawyer and knew the importance of a role that said Dean belonged to him.
"Castiel ..." Charlie called out to him and he turned to face her. She wiped away the tears with the back of her hand. "What happened next? How did the Omega end up at your house?" She asked curiously.
He had cleaned between his laptop keys and his shirts had been organized by purpose, with a separate section for plaid, divided by primary background colour. He could have bounced a quarter off the blanket drawn tight as a drum skin up under the pillows, especially since it had barely been disturbed during the night by anything so mundane as sleeping.
“Dean—”
Dean shoved up to his feet and stalked over to the French doors that led onto the deck, popping one open to get some fresh air, his stomach churning around the breakfast that had left him feeling pleasantly full a few minutes before.
Down the hall his door closed, the lock clicking as it was shot.
Figuring out he was bi had taken him every ounce of what limited self-awareness he had possessed at the tender age of eighteen, and it had been a rollercoaster of highest highs (novelty and excitement and rightness) and lowest lows (despair and self-loathing and shame).
It was almost like being hugged, he mused as the staccato beat of a snare drum came through the headphones, except that it really wasn’t. He hadn’t craved the comfort of another person’s presence beside him in bed like this in
Castiel left his desk, where he had been working continuously for the last two hours, and approached the omega, and sat at the end of the sofa.
"I can pay Alastair enough that he’ll want to sell you." He continued explaining, his voice weak, his eyes fixed on the Omega's, gauging his reaction. "I ... I'm sorry, Dean. I know that is ugly. The idea of buying you, but it's the only way I can think of right now. ”
"I'm going to get you back. Is that what you want? Do you want to come live with me? ” Castiel asked, suddenly very energetic, as if getting an answer from the Omega was very important.
"How can I help you?" He asked from the other side of the room, but even with the distance his voice resonated and both Charlie and Castiel listened without difficulty.
"In case you want it later," he said, pushing the bottle in his direction.
It was strange, but he trusted him. He knew he shouldn’t do it, one part of his mind was screaming that he shouldn't give in, but another part simply relaxed in the presence of this alpha and it felt good to do so.
"They’re going to take you ..." he began and Dean shook his head as more tears ran down his cheeks. "I know it will be very difficult but I promise ..."
"This is very good for bruises" Castiel smiled reassuringly as he spoke, "You can put it on your ribs and eye."
"This is how they teach them," added Charlie, in a sad tone of voice.
Dean was standing next to the other three officials, away from the Alpha who was at his desk. When he heard the alpha wanted to be approached, he panicked. He tried to stop it, but to no avail. Three men were more powerful than a weak one.
After the interminable meeting, all the omegas continued walking together, towards an internal courtyard.
He made sure to close the containers tightly and covered himself with the blanket again, and placed the right side of his face on his legs, wrapping his arms around his bent legs.
But it didn't seem to be the same way with this alpha. He knew that things were always different with every alpha.
Dean could see that he looked serious, and smelled of concern. Would he be worried about him? Or about the fact that he had a runaway Omega sitting on your couch?
"We’re agents of the System. Open the door or we'll break it down! ” they screamed from outside, and Castiel seemed to realize where he was.
"Dean, I have to tell you something, but it's not good. It's not a good thing," the Alpha whispered, in a confidential tone, almost as if he was apologizing.
the car's engine came to life, and it sped through the parking lot at high speed.
"Are you running away from your Alpha, Omega?" Theman held Dean by the collar of his jacket. Before Dean could react, he was slapped in the face so hard that it sent him to the ground.
"I don't need to meet you to know that this is wrong," he emphasized the "this" by gently pressing Dean's hands. The Omega couldn't see the alpha's face because he kept looking at the rolled sheets near his legs, but he could swear that Castiel's eyes were even more intense blue now.
The elevator came to a sudden stop and the same Beta who was still holding the black baton tightly, pushed him out of the elevator into the arms of a fourth man waiting for him.
"Sammy, he has a fever and I have to bathe him" Dean explained.
Usually on days like this there was a better chance that Alastair's bar would fill up with customers, and that led to Dean having to go help him. He hated those days.
A sign caught his attention. Omegas only dressed.
Her friend raised an eyebrow, clearly very confused.
"After three marks no Alpha wants you and you are out of the System" Dean spoke, looking at Jacob. That idea made him nervous.
"That's not going to happen, Charlie" Castiel said, looking up to see her "I'm going to marry Dean and if later he wants to go with his brother we will solve it. We will cross that bridge when we get to him, now I am going to get Dean from the clutches of Alastair, once and for all. "
Dean throws the door open, wearing nothing but a green towel wrapped around his waist. Cas snaps his eyes back up to Dean’s face. He quirks an eyebrow in question, and Dean shrugs. “I was showering. Sorry.”  He opens the door a little wider. “You can set it down if you want, I just gotta grab my wallet.” He gestures to the table beside the door before jerking his thumb over his shoulder.
Cas pulls him closer while simultaneously leaning in hesitantly. He gives Dean plenty of opportunity to pull away but Dean is a fucking sucker. And a glutton for punishment, apparently. If Cas is going to kiss him, he’s going to kiss him back, regardless if he’s leaving. Who's Dean to turn down a goodbye kiss?
“Ah, no big deal.” But he steps closer cautiously. Cas isn’t about to let him get the wrong idea, so he takes a step closer as well.
“You should have them more often.” Cas says conversationally.
“Why?”
Dean quickly realizes he’s only over seen the
Dean whimpers when he feels Cas pull both fingers out. He cracks his eye open to see Cas reach for more wing oil and then plunge two fingers back in. Dean’s back arches at the contact and
. You can only imagine when we did something wrong.” He gives Castiel a side long glance.
“I have.” He says resolutely. “Do you remember what you promised for the next beautiful day that fell on a Saturday?”
“Yea, hell of a combination. Hard to get right.”
In the hall he finds Sam pacing. And makes a snap decision.
of questions.
“I fucked up, Cas. I’m sorry.”
It was one of those rare, perfect late-April Sundays where the sun was warm and the air was fresh and just a bit cool, the trees nearly quivering with pent up energy. Their heavily budded branches were just waiting for that silent signal to burst into joyful spring-green bloom.
? Sam, I—” If he had been thinking straight, Dean might have been more embarrassed by how plaintive his tone had turned, but he was too preoccupied to care.
And that was how it began.
this one, goddammit!”
“Hello,” Blue-Eyes said, looking a bit uncertain as Dean just stared at him like a complete idiot. “I’m Castiel, your landlord?”
He had no idea if anything was getting through—he doubted it—but he really needed some of Cas’ pragmatism, his bone-dry humour, that angelic unflappability holding steady at his side. Needed…Cas.
Cas let Dean maneuver him out on the little landing, frowning at him in concern. “I’m sorry, Dean, I thought it was ok to let him in. He wanted to surprise you—”
He didn’t look at the phone with its now dark screen and traitorous photo. He didn’t need the reminder of how, when presented with an unexpected opportunity to set things right, he had instead doubled down on his deception.
,” he all but spat the word “that rolled off a production line. He’s himself, and I don’t think there’s a damn thing wrong with him, so if he’s such a hassle to y’all, how about I take him off your hands for good?”
to keep Sam from getting suspicious.
“Oh, my god, it was
Cas contemplated that for a second, fingers plucking lightly at the front of Dean’s sweater. “Damn. So what you’re saying is if I’d made you pie a couple of weeks ago we would have been doing this a whole lot sooner?”
A pie. A pie whose crust could only have been crimped by hand, baked golden brown and dusted with cinnamon and sugar in its fluted pie dish.
“Doesn’t count when I was being hustled like that by my own blood—”
, Sam, he said all this crazy stuff. And he said it knowing that would bring the Empty in time for it to take Billie out, too. He fucking smiled while it took him after he…told me he loved me.”
“Nope, still just Dean Winchester,” Dean quipped as Sam threw on the hazards and let the car drift to a stop on the side of some backcountry road, staring at him incredulously the whole time.
He’d showered, put on his comfiest sweats, reheated some leftovers and retreated to mope on the couch with a beer. Swiping open his phone, the message from Sam did nothing to improve his mood.
“Yeah, well, I don’t.”
Meeting Sam’s eyes, Dean leaned into every last bit of composure he had clawed out of the last few months to keep it together. “If there’s a chance that we succeed, then there are probably a thousand chances that we fail. I don’t know if I have it in me to do this all over again.”
“It’s a gift to be loved like that,” Jack said gently. “I think he wanted you to know how loved you are. Always have been.”
created for this fic! I was blown away by this one in particular because all I had provided was the text; I never said anything about the perspective I had of them while I was writing it, and yet she drew them EXACTLY how I'd been imagining them! Delightfully spooky although for her sake I sincerely hope she can't actually read my mind...it's scary in there >.<
They had just wandered out of a shared shower and were getting ready to head out for brunch with Gabriel when Dean’s phone buzzed on the dresser.
“There’s nothing wrong with Cas!”
Laughing as Gabe threw a handful of his ketchup-flavoured popcorn at Cas and Cas threw himself at Gabriel with dire threats of bodily harm if his sofa ended up stained, Dean escaped for a quick bathroom break before the third period started.
He was an idiot.
The strain of Dean’s secrets had started manifesting in nightly nightmares and a constant bubbling burn in his chest. He’d given up on thumbing individual Rolaids out of the little foil rolls a while back, and had committed to a Costco-sized container that he was practically popping by the handful, much to Cas’ concern.
“It’s alright.
…low blow.”
There wasn’t much that could put Dean off his food, but anything to do with Cas these days was definitely on the short list. He carefully set his fork down with a sigh at the waste of all that beautiful bacon-y goodness.
“Everyone’s gone,” Sam said, his voice strained. “You see anybody on the way here?”
Cas looked down at himself as he brushed a hand along the buttoned front of the vest. “Thank you. It was a nice change to wear something other than scrubs or sweatpants for a change.” He looked up and his eyes raked Dean from head to toe and back again appreciatively. “You look even better than you smell, and that’s saying something because you smell incredible.”
Christmas Day.
Even though his smile didn’t reach his eyes, Dean appreciated that John at least made the effort. “Must be all that tofu the grocery store carries special just for him.”
hurt. “Ok?” he added, stronger, waiting until he saw Sam’s reluctant nod in his peripheral vision.
“I’m trying, Sammy,” he said quietly to the ice cubes in his glass. “It’s slow going, but I’m trying to be better.”
Setting down his handful of plastic bags on the counter, Cas looked up briefly at Dean hovering in the doorway with a grin, then started pulling out food.
Utterly lost, Cas cocked his head, confused. “Why are you apologizing?”
, but he wasn’t about to be deterred.
TW (discussion of Dean's death) - If you can't deal with it, skip from "“No!” Dean thankfully looked as horrified as Cas felt." to the end of that scene, indicated with a ~. If you're on the fence, it's not a gory description detailing second by second what happened, but rather Dean telling Cas about his feelings as it was happening. Feel free to DM me on Twitter (@VernsTavern) if you want additional info before making a decision. Make the choice that's best for you!
“I don’t have a girlfriend named Cassie,” Dean said as his heart started pounding in his chest, watching Sam’s face register utter confusion. “I never did. I made her up because I was afraid of telling you and Dad the truth.”
Stubbornly looping all of the bags over his shoulders and arms, he was determined to make only one trip from the Impala up to his door. He was only puffing a bit—ok,
By the time Gabriel wandered in around four thirty that afternoon, Cas had stress cleaned his apartment—even dusting the baseboards by hand—and had moved on to reorganizing his closet by way of dumping all of its contents onto his bed for triage.
Still, he had a job to do, and he wouldn’t be much help to Sam if he fell asleep halfway to Hastings and wrapped the Impala around a telephone pole.
Confused as all hell, Cas didn’t resist as Dean stepped back to the other side of the threshold, his face twisted in pain as he started to shut the door, mouthing “I’m sorry” again.
Choking on his duplicity, Dean nudged Cas’ foot under the table.
Caught with his mouth stuffed with lettuce, Dean worked it all over into one cheek and tried to not spit half-chewed leaves at Sam. “You don’t want to hunt anymore?”
“Oh my God.”
“Who’s the lucky humanoid tonight?” Dean asked, aiming for curious but mostly just sounding grim. Gabe just shot him the bird and kept texting, finally sliding his phone under his thigh with a pleased sigh.
It was…well, a bit weird. Instead of the soft edges he was used to, narrow shoulders that would instinctively turned in towards him with heads that knew how to tuck in under his chin, Cas was a whole ‘nother ball game.
Dean had never been asked out so politely before.
He felt marginally less likely to claw his own skin off from inaction.
“Good run?” Donna called, poking her head into the control room to look up at them, struggling to bite back her grin when she caught sight of Dean two-handing his grip on the bannister as he navigated the stairs on shaking legs.
“Hey, Cas!” he shouted back towards the house. Cas appeared on the upper part of the deck, looking around curiously as the temperature dropped dramatically at Dean’s will. “Get down here, would ya?”
The sun crested the horizon at the eye-watering time of 5:07am. Dean knew that for certain because he hadn’t slept at all. The lack of Cas’ warm heft on the other side of the bed, knowing that he was lying in his own bed directly beneath Dean’s, probably just as miserable and twice as angry, made for what had felt like an endless night.
“Work smarter, not harder,” Dean countered, but then leaned forward, bracing his arms on the tabletop. “Cas…can we talk?”
Clean. Inviting. Safe for Sammy.
“Oh,” he breathed, stepping forward toward the rough-hewn plank and stone cabin set back into the trees. Chimneys ran up either side, promising future picture-postcard moments of smoke curling up against a fall background of vividly coloured leaves, or maybe even some snow-covered evergreens.
Dean didn’t end up meeting the mysterious “Cassie” until he moved in a couple of weeks later.
It was as easy as, well, pie, being with Cas. They had been
“In what way?” Jack’s curious head tilt was pure Cas, and it made Dean smile.
“Nothing. It’s nothing.” He looked over at Dean with a completely unconvincing close-lipped smile and snagged his own beer from the gleaming stovetop. “Game’s starting, come on.”
were pulsing hard and hot in the back of his throat and stinging the backs of his eyes, but Dean choked them back and aimed a cocky grin at Cas’ earnest face. He blindly shoved the tablet aside onto the coffee table in favour of pulling Cas on top of him.
The boys work out their feelings behind agreeing to this endeavor.
Cas frowns at him. And tilts his head in that adorable way that makes Dean weak. He’s weak enough as it is, the last thing he needs is full blast cuteness when he’s preparing to have his heart ripped out.
The contact seems to relax Cas and they stay like that for a while, just being in each other's space. Breathing each other's air.
Dean winks as Cas steps out onto the porch. “It’s a date.” He shuts the door.
He looks up to Dean with a package in his hand. Dean eyes it. “This is the new, sterile needle I’ll be using.” He says it like he’s repeating a script, so Dean just nods.
"Dean are you sure?"
“Cas.” He offers.
But then, Dean had always been a sucker for dark hair and blue eyes, and he was sure that was working in Cas’ favor. He finds himself at a loss on how to look away from this entrancing man. He’s handsome any way you slice it, and the whole package is just doing something for Dean.
“So it’s all you? Your grace.” Dean asks when they finally arrive back at the bunker.
He nods his affirmative when he returns to the chair and Cas quips. “Last chance to back out.” With a smirk on his face.
Though Dean has a rough idea of what needs to be done, he doesn't want to let on how much research he did. He also didn't read anything about angel baths. But Cas' wings honestly look like they could use some soap and water. He's also not sure if angel wings should even be washed. So he asks. "Should we wash them first? There's a lot of gunk in them."
He finds the book on the third shelf like Sammy had said. It's an ethereal blue that reminds him of Cas’ eyes when they glow. But the leather binding is worn so the color isn’t as bright. Upon closer inspection, Dean realizes it's decent sized and upon flipping through it, realizes it's pretty dense material.
And for once, Dean’s not sure
He pressed the Ring button and waited. Delivering pizza wasn’t the best job in the world but it gave him spending money and flexible hours while he was in college. Not that he needed it much. If he wanted
Dean doesn’t wanna sleep, he wants to stay up and be with Cas. But he knows he’s not gonna last much longer, his eyes had gotten heavy in the time they’d spent lost in each other. “You’re gonna be here, right?”
Dean nods. "I trust you." He breathes. And it's true. Just like Cas trusted Dean to take care of his wings, Dean trusts Cas -only Cas- with…well whatever it is they’re about to do. Cas presses another kiss to his lips and Dean melts farther. Cas guides him down onto the bed and Dean opens his legs to allow Cas space. They get lost in kissing again for a while but at some point Cas works his boxers off and Dean lifts his hips to help.
He pauses long enough that Cas reassures him. “If you don’t wish to say, I don’t mind. It
aside, do
Dean casts a brief glance in Castiel’s direction. Castiel holds his gaze, feeling rooted to his spot until Dean looks back to his brother for a short moment before closing his eyes for the last time.
He presses the Ring button again after he waits for a full minute with no answer.
Cas stares at him for so long Dean wonders if he’s actually going to say anything. Eventually he opens his mouth. And closes it. And opens it again. He looks like a fish gasping for air. He lets out a breath with a resigned but determined look on his face. He fixes his full intense gaze on Dean.
"Hmmm." Cas agrees. With what, Dean's not sure.
, and Dean wastes no time, zipping over to the coffee maker. To his surprise, it’s already on and there’s fresh coffee in there.
"Okay." He says hesitantly. "If you're sure," he pauses for long time, still turning it over in his head. "Yes, I want to continue."
has to hunt these monsters.”
It hadn’t been a good day. Like, at all. Nothing had gone right with the case, the research took too long, too many people died, the weapon almost didn’t work, the monster just didn’t wanna die, they’d had to call Cas for backup. Yea, a shit day.
“So... we’re still naked.” Dean says suggestively.
As they kiss, Dean feels Cas’ hand wrap around his dick. Dean breaks the kiss on a gasp and Cas moves to his neck, sucking hotly on the sensitive skin. He pumps him a few times and Dean thinks he could come just from that. Thankfully Cas doesn’t linger. He breaks the hot mess on Dean's neck and reaches his arm back to his shoulders. When he comes back his hand is dark with liquid. Wing oil. When Cas wraps his hand around him again with the oil, Dean has to close his eyes and focus on anything else. When he can’t take it anymore he knocks Cas’ hand away lightly.
Not one to be ignored, Dean plunges both hands farther into the downy feathers and just- squeezes and rakes. Its not rough, just enough that it gets the reaction he's wanting.
personal. I was only curious.”
“Dean, can I share something with you? A secret, if you will.” Dean’s breath pauses. This was clearly something Cas probably wouldn’t say without liquor loosening his tongue.
Cas’ face resolves. “I need help grooming my wings so they can restore themselves.”
He would do anything to avoid hearing Cas sound so small and apprehensive. He whips around immediately. Because of course-
The masked medical professional pulls the curtain back.
He watches Cas’ eyes close in focus and in moments, large black wings appear to
Cas scissors him and that’s- that’s different, good different, before pushing farther in with both fingers, searching. Dean knows when he’s found his mark. Because Dean’s entire body jerks and a zing of pleasure shoots through him. Is that what a prostate does? He thinks dazedly. Cas makes a few more passes over it and Dean moans with how fucking good it is, his dick leaking copious amounts of precum.
Cas hums, doesn’t otherwise respond. He pulls out his phone and Dean isn’t sure, but it looks like he starts scrolling aimlessly.
. Dean’s not too sure what that’s about and Cas doesn’t elaborate. Dean had said he wanted to help. Why wouldn't Cas let him?
Dean senses his inner turmoil rising when he realizes that nifty haze has thoroughly left him and the consequences of his actions are becoming glaringly apparent. How does he and Cas continue on at this point? They slept together under a lust clouded haze brought on by angel…
His tense stance obviously alerted Cas because he could feel the angel peer over at him. “Dean are you okay? Are you in a hurry?”
Cas lifts a hand to his forehead and in an instant his aches disappear.
Dean claps his hands together, excitement starting to run through him. “Well, alright then, let’s see ‘em.”
Cas offers a small smile. “Thank you, Dean. If you don’t mind, I’m going to head to… my… room.” He still sounds uncertain but Dean isn’t going to push. Just going to affirm. Dean nods.
The pie sits between them as they take turns stabbing it with their forks. Dean’s heart is as full as it’s ever been, looking at Cas from across the table. Cas smiles back at him, his mouth full of apple pie, and Dean needs an anchor. He reaches his hand across the table and Cas takes it willingly.
Cas stiffens immediately. “There is nothing you can do, Dean." He bites out. "There is nothing anybody can do, I just have to hope-"
“Just go ahead and ask, man.” He waves his hand at Castiel. “It doesn’t bother me. You’re one of the last people I’m ever gonna talk to.” He shrugs.
Dean smiles, surprised. “Yea? You free any time within the next few days?”
"Yes." He says back just as quietly.
On this particular day though, Sam had announced he was off to talk to Rowena about some spell stuff or whatever. Dean had basically rolled his eyes. He was highly suspicious of his brother spending too much time with the witch, but he could produce no actual reason for arguing the topic so he had grunted his agreement and went about fixing his coffee.
It looks like some place a dad would take his kids fishing. It has a small picnic bench on the far end fairly close to the lake. Pond is more like it. It’s far enough out of city limits Dean can look up and see stars.
“Thanks. Jerk.” Sam quips back.
Cas sighs lightly and shifts up and off Dean. He immediately misses the contact. Dean startles when the mess on his stomach and partly on Cas’ disappears instantly. The mess
Dean runs a hand over his face, and looks around the bunker again. It doesn’t look bad. Mostly, it’s just different. Besides that nymph, the bunker is never decorated.
"And if it doesn't..?" Dean asks, dreading the answer.
"The next step is straightening. As you go through, it wont take long for you notice and correct the feathers that seem crooked or out of place. This step shouldn't take long."
He watches as Cas’ hand connects with the vampire’s head and the creature screams as his eyes and mouth flash white with the smiting. It takes all of two seconds before the vamp drops to the ground.
“Of course, Dean.”
“Please. Cas. I’m ready. I need you. I want you. Please. I need more than your fingers. Cas.” He whines.
“Nothing.” He shrugs. “I just figure somebody needs to look out for you every now and then. Your mental well-being is important.”
want to continue?"
“Oh Dean, I fear I’ve severely misjudged the situation.”
As far as ideas go, it’s not a bad one. Dean is still stiff from the hunt and he could definitely use a breather. He follows Cas’ instructions to the gravel road that leads to a small clearing.
“Uh…” His brains scrambles to remember what he certainly promised to Cas. It’s a problem because Dean promises a lot of things to Cas. Usually without thinking it through.
He feels a loss as soon as they pull apart. “Drive careful.” Dean says softly. “Text me when you make it home.”
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up. “Most of it?”
Castiel is at a loss. “That doesn’t seem right. It was clearly defense.”
Later, Dean will have a break down about how this gorgeous man just outright told him to call him.
“A catch 22. The biggest contradiction known to man.” Dean laughs halfheartedly. Cas’ slim knowledge on human terms has always been endearing. But knowing the angel’s wings may never work again because of the classic paradox put a strain on Dean’s good mood. He wondered…
Cas only nods and makes his way to the communal shower down the hall from the bedrooms, his wings dragging behind him, and folded into his back. For the first time since deciding on this endeavor, Dean feels actual nerves creep in. But they're not creeping in for the right reasons because Dean’s a selfish little shit. He groans internally and once again steels himself to follow his
“What’re you doing?”
“You’re really quiet, I’m just checking in.” Cas says after a while. “It’s not uncommon for some people to be biting their tongue with this placement.”
"It's wing oil. It comes out when the wings have been properly groomed otherwise. It's to coat and protect them now that they're in good shape again. It's not harmful and it's the next step."
Cas shrugs. “I guess I’ll finally return to heaven. And I’ll live out your happiest and most treasured memories with you for all of time.” Never mind the fact that Cas is probably going to star in most of them from here on out.
Dean thought this over, absorbing the new information. Mostly, it made him angry. What demon had the gall to injure his Angel’s wings?
“My saving grace is having Friday’s off.” And it truly was at this point.
Dean may be rebooting certain parts of his brain, but the main circuit is still functioning. He snaps his hand out to grab Cas' arm. "No."
In the shower room, Cas strips down to his navy boxers and Dean tries really fucking hard to get ahold of himself. They’re doing this because Cas needs his help. Dean needs to get a grip on his rampant mind before it gets any weirder than it already has to be. Dean fiddles with the controls to find a warm water temperature and then proceeds to undress himself to his boxers while the water heats up. The water isn't the only thing heating up as he feels his face burn. Just two dudes stripping down in the communal showers to- wash some wings?
he thinks. Or is it?
“Dean.” His voice has a warning in it and he fights to stay still, biting softly on Dean’s shoulder.
embarrassed. About the state of his wings. Because angels were proud creatures and the state of their wings reflected the image of the angel himself, the book had said.
Cas ducks his head to focus on his newest task. Dean closes his eyes tight when he feels Cas’ finger on around his hole. He does his best to stay relaxed though. Like remembering it brings it back, he feels that calm settle over him, helping him relax.
Cas shakes his head and Dean lets out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding.
Oh Rowena says. Dean rolls his eyes.
“Come on, are you serious? What
After everybody had showered, and had dinner, Dean found himself in the study area with Cas. Sam had fucked off to his room, presumably to FaceTime Eileen. Dean was giving Cas a run down of all the shit they’d dealt with before he’d shown up and deus ex-machina’d their asses.
be doing. What I
"I had wondered if you were experiencing that. Not every groomer does. Yes, its my essence connecting with your- well I guess with your soul since you are human. I suppose it's not that surprising, considering we are already connected in that way."
“Dean?”
None of this took away from the fact they were still the most magnificent thing Dean had ever seen. He reached a hand up to touch but stopped himself. This was an intimate act he reminded himself, and he should get permission first. He glances at Cas, who nods his head once.
Like most days, Cas eventually joined him in the kitchen as Dean sat down to drink his coffee and eat his breakfast. He watched carefully as Cas made his way over to the coffee maker, poured himself a cup and then loaded up on creamer and sugar like a damn psychopath. Dean almost rolled his eyes.
Eventually his shoulders slump once Cas leaves the room. He heads to the kitchen with the idea of a late night unhealthy snack, because fuck Sam and his healthy shit.
Cas doesn’t say anything, which kind of says everything. Anywhere is better than being at the bunker with Dean.
The promise of more hanging over them makes the walk to the door awkward.
“Cas, I wanna help you.” He starts. “I wanna help you with your wings.”
“Yea.”
“Anyway, he had been on patrol when he realized Sammy had just gotten home. Barged into the house, yellin’ about how we were ungrateful and didn’t know where he went wrong raisin’ us, the whole nine.” Dean waves his hands around as he talks. He’s clearly an animated speaker. “Woke me up from a dead sleep. Ran downstairs to see what all the commotion was about. As soon as I caught sight of them, my old man had reared back and punched Sam square in the temple. I didn’t even think, I just dove for him.”
Dean pointedly ignores Sam's '
Dean thinks. Cas had a head start on Dean while he was in the shower. And it must have been impressive, because when Cas speaks, his timber is slightly off, indicating his tipsy-ness. It doesn’t alter the way Dean
Dean's face flames again at the idea of being completely naked with his best friend and what their next endeavor is. Cas kisses his forehead. "You are beautiful. Body and soul. I would know." If Cas thought that would calm Dean, he's sorely mistaken.
Dean focuses back on his task, starting to spread the oil on the straightened feathers and pauses. He stares. Hard.
“It’s supposed to appeal to the groomer.”
"Which is precisely why you deserve one."
Dean rolls his eyes and shoves his wallet back into his pocket. This was just fucking great.
"Uh, the- the end of the bed is fine." He stumbles over several words and feels his face impossibly heat up more.
feels when his best friend speaks.
Cas hummed and offered, “I’m fine, Dean. How are you?” And he said it with so much nonchalance that anybody else may have bought it. As it were, Dean was much more perceptive than people gave him credit for, especially regarding Cas. But Dean also knew he wouldn't get far, needling at the angel. Cas had his own bad temper when provoked.
"You don't want me to finish?" Dean knows he sounds petulant but he's a little put out by the fact that there's more he could do and Cas is- well he's rejecting Dean.
“How about we pull over? There’s a backroad up here that just leads to a small lake. We can stretch our legs and then get back on the road.”
"Huh." He keeps going but starts to notice a dark liquid covering parts of the wings. "Uh, Cas, what is this?" And because he can't help himself he swipes some of it up on his fingers to get a feel for it.
“I love you, Dean.” He says, choked.
, Dean wonders if this is part of that too. Does the person doing the grooming also benefit from this? The feeling had come over him first in the shower. A calm that settled his mind and allowed him to mostly focus on the task of grooming. It felt much the same now. It stopped him from thinking too hard about all the outside stuff, like how Cas may really feel, or how
As he works gently on the left wing, this time in relative silence, save for Cas' little sounds every now and then, he gets the feeling that he’s being lulled into a trance like state. Nothing he can’t control but his brain doesn’t seem to wonder, and he feels at ease with everything. Just focused on the task in front of him. It’s a good feeling.
Cas nods and sets about prepping his station. Dean watches him snap on a pair of black gloves, but not before catching the intricate design of a yin and yang  symbol on his right hand. It was in the shape of two fish, one black and the other the color of Cas’ tanned skin. The smell of disinfectant hits him again as Cas opens a package of wipes and begins wiping down his counter.
“It’s amazing how the constellations have changed over the millennia.” Cas remarks. “They still resemble what your ancestors looked at, but they aren’t quite the same.”
Dean flushes at Cas’ words but manages to nod. “I’ll tell you.” He promises.
Cas had had sex though. As a human. With that damned reaper April. And then had been promptly stabbed by the bitch. Dean couldn’t help but think what a horrible first time that must have been. He also couldn't help but think Cas' first time shouldn't have been with a stranger.
“Uh yea.” He says as his brain short circuits at the idea of Cas- flirting? Dean might actually die.
He’s hit with another wave of nausea. This was Dean’s brother. The person Dean had done everything for. And would gladly do it again. He thought of the grief this man— Sam— would have to endure for the rest of his life. Castiel couldn’t imagine living without his brother. He was his best friend. He imagines it must be the same for these two. The way Dean had spoke, and Sam’s expression said it all.
Sam doesn’t sit down. He gazes at the room, at his brother strapped down to a gurney with I.Vs protruding from his arm. Castiel looks too.
“I gotta say, Cas, you really came in clutch back there.” Dean shakes his head in frustration and sighs, downing the glass of whiskey. He didn’t drink it often, beer was his poison, but after today… “I’m really, kinda… mad at myself for not calling you sooner. I should have made the call as soon as the research wasn’t making sense. People were already dyin’. My fuckin’ pride just got in the way.” He shakes his hand vaguely. “So, thank you. For showin’ up. Even though you didn’t have to.”
Dean had had his last supper the day before and Castiel had had his last ‘last supper’ as well, for as soon as he got home after saying goodbye to Sam, he drafted his resignation.
“It’s my wings, Dean. Being damaged as they are is incredibly uncomfortable.”
"We’ve come this far, we may as well finish it. I want to- finish it that is."
As his brain continues to descend into chaos at what they did, Cas seems to notice something is wrong.
“I’ll always need you, Cas. Even when I act like I don’t, or… I- I push you away, I need you. Prolly more, when I do that. And not just to fight monsters. I just… need you. To stick around. To be here.” Dean blows out a breath. Even drunk, that took a lot to say.
“I’d love to watch the rest with you. And you can talk to your hearts content.” Dean‘s voice was soothing and Cas wouldn’t mind hearing it speak regarding other activities.
Strangely he feels another odd rush of affection. Though Dean prides himself on taking care of those around him, it was obvious Cas had the desire to take care of Dean as well. And well, Dean liked it. Liked that he meant enough to somebody that they wanted to take care of him.
“Here.” And he raises his hand to the general area of his heart. Cas didn’t miss his glances.
“We should take a vacation.” Cas says thoughtfully after a few minutes of silence. “Haven’t you always wanted to take one? Or retire?”
“I can stay here?” Cas asks wistfully, like he doesn’t really believe what he’s asking.
“Really? I could have sworn you were a virgin.” He gives Dean coy smile.
Dean does. And finds that he maybe, kinda, likes it. He figures it’ll grow on him more with time. Sam joins him at the mirror. Upon closer inspection, he can tell they’re a little different. Subtle things like the swirls and Dean’s looks a little heavier inked.
In Dean's room, Cas stands awkwardly in the middle, obviously not knowing where to sit with wet boxers. Dean grabs two clean pairs out of his dresser before thinking about it and tosses one to Cas.
When Cas wraps a hand around his dick to stroke him, he can't hold back a moan and his pleasure crests. It’s all consuming and Dean’s pretty sure his brain whites out for a second. He barely registers the hot white stripes coming from him in favor of dazedly focusing on Cas.
When he got back to work, he felt a wave of nausea hit when he was assigned to be one of the three prison witnesses for Dean’s execution. He felt the smallest bit of happiness— if it could be called that— at the idea of seeing the man again. But it was quickly dashed by the impending event later on.
“Come on sleepy head, we gotta get back on the road.”
“Thanks.”
“I would manifest them to this plane, and you would go through and… groom them.” He shrugs like he doesn’t know how else to put it.
He brushes his hands over the wings searching for the loose feathers and finds that it’s not too hard to locate the ones that need to be plucked. In a few places, more pressure is needed to sift through the layers of down and when he applies it, Cas shudders beneath him.
“You doing okay buddy? Is the pressure alright? Doing anything wrong here?”
Cas nods. “Most week nights, and every other weekend. Do you eat pizza every night?” He quips.
Cas shrugs. “I spent the night.” He flicks his eyes to Dean quickly, before focusing back on Sam. “I think I’m gonna stay a while if that’s okay.”
"It’s okay." Cas sound breathless. "They're incredibly sensitive."
"Nah man, this isn’t some tit for tat thing. I'm doing this because I want to, not because I'm hoping to get something in return." Dean's also pretty sure he wouldn't survive getting a massage given by Cas. And not because the dude's strong as hell, that would be great, but because it would just be too much for Dean's inappropriate brain to handle. He'd combust. He knows he would.
"How do you want me?" Cas asks and Dean's brain short circuits. There are many ways he wants Cas and bed placement of all kinds rank highly on that list.
As he watched, he noticed Cas shifted often, like being still too long was uncomfortable. He rolled his shoulders often and knocked his head side to side every few seconds. His fingers twitched as well, but Dean knew he was in no danger of dropping anything no matter Cas’ discomfort. Angel senses or some shit.
“Happy Harvest, Dean.” He says with a laugh in his voice.
Cas hesitates.
“And what if -what if- I want you until I.. die?” He croaks out.
Cas is silent and Dean wonders if he's being ignored. Cas continues to squirm under his touch.
"And how does it take place between friends?"

Dean figures getting out of the bunker would do them both some good. And since Sammy was fucking off with the she-Witch, Dean figures it’s a splendid idea to spend some time with his bestie. Maybe a change of scenery would help Cas open up to Dean about what was bothering him. Dean hopes it’s not living in the bunker that’s the problem. They decide to each spend some time looking and meet in the war room in an hour.
Back in the bunker, he again tells Cas he would be in the shower and Cas waves him off making his way to his own bedroom.
"Dean, I-"
"It's- stimulating. I don't know how much reading you did, but- Dean there was a reason I was and still am hesitant about this."
Why wasn’t he doing this before?
"I could give you one." Cas offers. And Dean practically chokes on his own spit. He covers it with a cough. "It would be a great way to show you my thanks."
“See you then.”
“Really?" He sounds genuinely surprised. "Wow. Okay. Thank you. So much.” He pulls out a business card from an inconspicuous pocket. “Give me a call when you get a chance and give me your contact information." He looks around, uneasiness starting to form on his face. "I need to get out of here. It was nice to meet you."
Cas moves even lower, massaging Dean’s taint. Dean’s breath hitches and Cas freezes.
“Lie back down.” Cas sounds almost commanding and Dean complies immediately. He opens his legs again to give Cas room. Cas lowers his mouth back down to Dean’s and Dean keeps his tongue to himself in case Cas isn’t into that. But Cas apparently has no qualms and forces his mouth open with his tongue and they trade hot, messy, filthy kisses.
“Gonna have to slow down with that.” He pants out.
“Very well.”
He makes a face. “Gross. He’s my brother. This is his birthday present, matching tattoos.” And he rolls his eyes for emphasis on how lame he finds the whole thing.
another angel groom an angel’s wings? Or could it possibly be done by a human?
about setting a course of action. But he knew one thing for certain. He was going to find a way to help Cas.
“That your boyfriend?” He doesn’t sound judgmental, only curious. But it makes Dean recoil, regardless.
“Then you’ll have me.” He says simply. “Though I plan to keep you alive for a long life. I may be tempting fate, but you deserve the option to live a full life, hunting or retired."
“How have you been Cas? Don’t see much of you, even though we live together.”
Fall and Pumpkins. There’s wreathes and garlands, and when he gets to the main room he sees- throw pillows?- on the chairs. There’s a large table cloth covering the table with- you guessed it- pumpkins and leaves. Little trinkets adorn the shelves proclaiming its Fall Time and something else about pumpkins.
Sam nods eagerly. “Yea man, we’d love to have you.” He glances to Dean who has poured himself a cup of steaming hot goodness. Dean nods and Sam goes back to his
"Do you want to stop?" Dean's pretty sure a
with Cas.
"Shh, shh." Dean rests his forehead against Cas' and breathes in his angel's scent some more.
Dean gives himself over completely to the haze and he and Cas are practically swapping spit at this point with how messy the kiss becomes. At some point they shift, never breaking apart, and Dean finds himself in Cas' lap, on his knees, straddling Cas' legs. His hands find Cas' hair, fingers sliding through the soft dark locks. When they align just right, they both falter with the knowledge of feeling each other's arousal. It fuels Dean. He grinds down and gets the most delicious groan out of Cas. He keeps going, the sounds giving him life.
