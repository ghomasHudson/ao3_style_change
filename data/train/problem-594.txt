Sherlock looked at him like he was crazy. “How do you expect me to sleep if you want me to watch the movie, John?!” Always dramatic, Sherlock flung an arm toward the TV.
Sherlock turned on his heel to walk the forty-minute walk home, but his right hand kept a steady hold on John’s left. It was not a romantic handhold, but quite literally John’s being completely encompassed in Sherlock’s. But Sherlock still didn’t want to let go. So he didn’t.
“And you’ll be there?”
Lestrade, Mary, and Mrs. Hudson were a herd of hyenas, cracking joke after joke. John stared at Sherlock’s back. Sherlock faced the window and waited.
Sherlock internally rolled his eyes.
“Take you, Mary.”
As time passed, both men’s shoulders relaxed. Their hands melted into each other’s and their torsos were flush against each other. The cozy and warm aura made John want to lay his head on Sherlock’s shoulder: it was right in front of him, so welcoming. But he didn’t. And Sherlock didn’t rest his head atop of John’s. As much as he wanted to.
In front of the venue was a long gravel driveway, a few miles long off of the main road. A tall white fence lined both sides and John squinted down the driveway, seeing Sherlock’s stature heading toward the main road.
He didn’t know how far was too far and was terrified at the idea of John retaliating at his touch.
John’s lungs stopped breathing as Sherlock took the other hand, buried in the other pocket, and exhaled hot air on it, too.
“You. Can be called dad. Only if you want, I mean. You don’t have to, but if you did, it would be fine. It’d be good. If you want.”
To his surprise, Sherlock complied.
Yes, the tall “sociopath” had stepped up more than you might think in regards to parental roles around the house. He had even come so far as to only do potentially flammable and/or fatal experiments while Rosie was sleeping or at school.
John’s eyes dilated and his mouth was agape as Sherlock did the same to his other hand, slowly laying a warm kiss to his other palm.
She shook her head, burying her face in his jumper. He laughed warmly. “You had your dad and I worried, you little devil!”
Sherlock was pacing, already dressed to the nines in his black suit and light-colored tie. He was freshly shaven, freshly showered, and freshly anxious-out-of-his-mind as absolute dread coursed through his veins.
“I see, I see. Excuse me for the mistake.”
Sherlock had told himself he could not and would not love, but look at him now: Sitting in the back of a taxi with a hole in the bottom of his stomach as his fist clenched the phone in his hand.
He smiled. “I took off for the rest of the day. Home?”
Sherlock’s head raised at the sound of John’s voice. The sandy haired doctor was walking toward him, smiling in a way Sherlock couldn’t completely pin.
Sherlock’s heart dropped. Rosie.
He turned toward the woman and smiled one of his fake, too-wrinkly-to-be-authentic smiles where it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “We will have two of these. One in a men’s size 10.5 and the other in women’s 7.”
Somberly, Sherlock leaned back and looked into John’s eyes. “Do you love her?”
John was meeting Sherlock at the hospital and he had to go, he said. Sherlock said it was going to be okay. John said he wished he and Sherlock were together. Sherlock assured him that they would be together sooner rather than later and that Rosie was going to be alright, even though Sherlock didn’t know it or not. He knew John’s simpleton mind would find satisfaction with his words, so he said them anyway, valid or not. Truth be told, he was two seconds away from a panic attack.
John pushed these thoughts out of his brain.
All rules of platonic friendship were out of the window and unnecessary at this point. Neither man knew how far was too far or how much was too much, but neither man complained when the other pushed, either.
“He’s lying!”
Soon, Lestrade took up the plates and washed them in the sink as Mrs. Hudson wiped the table down. John and Mary went downstairs and he made sure Mary was safely on her way home in a taxi. By the time he was back up, the only remaining person was Sherlock.
But then again, John could always do the impossible.
John’s heart twisted. “Please, just don’t leave. We need you.”
“Everything is set, John. Are you okay?”
Sherlock, feeling John’s anxiety instantly, plucked a gold band from the case. It was simple; not too thin but not too thick, either. Beautiful and sturdy and reliable and simple and easy and stunning and perfect.
How one could be so utterly and totally infatuated and horrified was beyond him.
Sherlock hummed in agreement.
The scent of John’s cologne remained on his shirt.
“Are you her father?”
The walk to the London canal was one that was about forty minutes, and after about twenty minutes of walking in silence, John began to feel the chill of London’s night seep through the protection of his jacket.
“He left.”
“First of all,” the ashy blonde began as he heaved a scoop of rice in his mouth. “These are not our ‘last days’. I will still see you every day, still go on cases, still write the blog. Nothing will change.”
“Sherlock, why are you going home to relapse after my wedding? Why do you…”
He crouched in front of Sherlock, now quietly crying as well. He moved Sherlock’s hands away from his face. “Please look at me.”
It happened quickly before either could truly register it. Suddenly John was on his toes, his hand resting on Sherlock’s jaw and other hand pulling him closer by the coat.
John swallowed.
John groaned, grabbing the back of his own neck. “Tell everyone, I suppose. I’ll pull Mary aside, we can make an announcement that the wedding is over after that. Then we can go home and… figure the rest out as it comes.”
Forty minutes had passed in silence of closed curtains, deep-voiced whispers, and “it’s okay, let’s just start again.” Sooner than John would have thought, they were clumsily waltzing around the room. Was it perfect? No. Was John truly the least graceful person Sherlock had ever danced with? Maybe. But they were doing it.
This man who everyone thought a heartless sociopath was nothing of the sort, John thought to himself.
“John, is this truly how you want to live out our final days? Eating takeaway on the couch with crap Telly on?”
[The Night Before the Wedding]
Sherlock smiled softly, his hard edges softening a bit more and John looked at him with so much love Sherlock felt he could explode.
“Sherlock, please,” John’s voice broke.
“We get it all of the time,” Sherlock interrupted, starting at the wall as if none of what was occurring interested him. “Don’t apologize, as it’s what everyone else in the world also thinks.”
They were, in fact, a family. Yes, that much was apparent. John woke up and gave Rosie a bath while Sherlock did his best to make breakfast, more often than not, frozen waffles that he put in the toaster. Sherlock would then get Rosie ready while John scoped out the shared email, searching for a case that Sherlock could look into while John went away to work.
“An accident? What kind of accident?”
John tried to mask his pure euphoria at the feeling of Sherlock against him, so blindingly vulnerable and trusting. He leaned his cheek against Sherlock’s soft curls and smelled tobacco and mint, hot tea, and lavender.
Since then, the shorter man had been more affectionate by the hour, brushing Sherlock’s curls away here or kissing him on the forehead as he passed in the kitchen there.
“Rosie,” Sherlock all but shouted, beginning to strut toward the chaos. “Rosie! Rosie, I’m here!”
His phone rang and he checked the clock. It was 13:02. It was probably Lestrade, saying he was running by Wagamamas on his way to the flat and did Sherlock want any? This happened on a semi-regular basis, the two single men talking about murder over take away food while John was away at work.
“Yes, Sherlock. We’ll go home.”
Sherlock swiped John’s debit card, took them both and muttered a thank you before the doctor could properly stand up.
Surprised and out of control of his exhausted shell, Sherlock’s body began to melt into the stage of not-quite-asleep but no longer coherent as the movie buzzed in the background. The feeling of John’s comforting hands on his back was starting to numb his mind palace and spinning thoughts, something that only occurred when he was high.
He was pulled from his thoughts when Mrs. Hudson began to tidy the living room, stacking books and tossing blankets off of the floor. Then -
The shorter man stopped dancing. His partner stopped with him.
“You think Mary will like it?”
Everything had to be perfect, everything had to be right. John and Mary had relied on him to help plan their day, and the day finally came. He had to make everything good for John, and for the first time in ages, felt a panic attack coming along.
“And I’ll be there.”
John pulled away, stabilizing Rosie.
Sherlock glanced into the mirror and for a second, lost the ability to breathe as he felt his ears grow pink. The jacket that John had on was black and smooth, perfectly fitting his torso and arms. The back of the coat was longer, extenuating his form. This suit also made John stand a bit taller, Sherlock noticed, his shoulders more set.
John kissed him.
John chuckled warmly and Sherlock stood up from the bed. “Yes, Sherlock. We can get food.”
“What song is this?” John asked, his body melting in the slow tempo.
Sherlock tugged at the bottom of the suit in an attempt to let out the wrinkles that did not exist. He fixed John as if the man were made of glass, perfecting the suit and doing so with shaky and hesitant fingers. After he was satisfied, he took a miniature step back to look at his friend properly.
Lestrade gave him a pitying look across the room.
Sherlock wasn’t typically the comforter in he and John’s relationship and for a second, the detective had looked at the crouched doctor as if he had grown three heads. But sooner rather than later, he came to and got on his knees in front of John, desperate to make eye contact and bring John back to him.
[Two Hours Before the Wedding]
“Sherlock,” John whispered. “Can I do this?”
Then.
Sherlock stopped his swaying and walked back toward the doctors and nurses.
Lestrade smacked John’s shoulder and Sherlock smiled at the sound. “You’ve hurt his feelings! Be a man, dance with him!”
“I’ll teach him.”
“You should go home.”
“I can’t.”
John laughed. “Really? Never would’ve guessed. Listen, you’re tired and you won’t let yourself sleep and I can help you sleep so come here. Half of your exhaustion is because of me, anyway. Least I can do.”
But, this morning he was not mature enough to get the groceries. He moped around the flat after they left, took a half hearted shower, and spent his afternoon standing at the kitchen table with his microscope.
One Month Until the Wedding
Taking two steps forward, he hesitantly touched the firm shoulders of his best friend, turning him to himself. Dark, denim blue eyes rose to meet gray, silver ones. John’s heart raced at the sudden warmth of his touch.
“Oi!”
“Morning, Mrs. Hudson. Have any tea?”
“I have to go,” Sherlock shrugged him off and continued to walk away from the conversation.
“I - was just surprised that you knew how to dance. That’s all. I’m fine with dancing with you.”
John reached out and Sherlock flinched.
His chest was warm. Safe. He smelled of tea, aftershave, honey, and cologne. A perfect mix of sweet and masculine, creating an aroma Sherlock could bathe in, he thought.
“Where? To go get fucking high and ruin all of the work you’ve accomplished?” John spat.
“Sherlock,” John whispered, laying his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, his forehead against Sherlock's neck. He could feel Sherlock’s pulse.
“I love you.” Sherlock’s eyes snapped up at this declaration.
You are married. You’re tipsy and your adrenaline is pumping, causing your worry for my physical wellbeing to merge into an identity crisis and a profession for feelings that you most certainly don’t have, and -”
A bit shocked and very confused, the woman smiled tightly and walked to the back of her store to find just that.
“The Woman.”
So, that’s who they were. Dada (John), Bee (Sherlock), and Rosie Watson (Little Bee). Not your average family, but content nonetheless.
Rosie’s crying.
“Sherlock’s song was beautiful, John. Just beautiful.”
“Who?”
John huffed, offended. “When have you ever danced, Sherlock?”
Sherlock ate breakfast alone and avoided looking at himself in the bathroom mirror, refusing to see the curls John had brushed out the night before.
Mrs. Hudson slapped the shorter man on the shoulder. “Is that any way to talk to your future wife, John Watson?”
Sherlock kissed the palm of John’s hand, and John stood up.
“I can’t be around those people for so long, John. I was drowning in there and you didn’t even care.”
“To be my wife…”
John was everything and more; an infinite being of adoration for the detective and letting him down was not on Sherlock’s list of Favorite Things to Do (yes, this list does exist).
When the shorter man neared the door, he gently reached for Sherlock’s waist and pulled him in close, Sherlock’s long arms weaving around his neck - the two fitting together like puzzle pieces.
And this was the cycle his brain spun on constantly. Wanting John more than anything in the world and absolutely despising himself for even considering a future with the soldier. It was exhausting.
John didn’t meet his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Fine. Ready to be hitched.”
Neither of them spoke and neither changed the grip on the other until they met the door of the London flat, where they separated and walked in as if nothing had happened.
“Daddy,” she cried softly and helplessly into his jacket.
A beat of silence, then.
Sherlock stood still.
He then took John’s other hand and without thinking, placed a kiss to the palm. “See?” His voice was soft. “You’re real, you’re here. I’m here, I’m touching you. You’re feeling my heart and you’re safe.” Sherlock kissed John’s palm again.
Sherlock gently set the phone case down and peeled back the latex that clung to his hand with want, smiling at the satisfying pop of the glove after it’s disposal.
He didn’t know what he was saying please for. He didn’t know what he was asking, what he was feeling, what he wanted.
I’ll just live my life
“Hello, hi, I am Sherlock Holmes and I am here to see Rosie Watson.”
Silence fell over the group as music blasted around them.
“Sherlock! Sherlock!”
“Oh, my darling!” He gently set his hand on the side of Rosie’s face, tilting her head up to the light. She had four stitches on her forehead, looking very unpleasant and already beginning to bruise. He then set his hands on his knees and pushed up, in an oh-so John Watson form and scooped her into his arms, resting her on his hip. “No more monkey bars for you, hmm?”
As John unbuttoned the sixth suit of the hour, Sherlock rolled his eyes and read through his emails. Mysteriously dead cat, missing hamster… Boring, boring, boring.
But then again, he was terrified that he was overstepping. He was mortified at the idea of being circumstantially convenient.
“Then you do what you think is best. Your gut knows. Your heart knows. Follow them.”
Sherlock had decided that no, it wasn’t, and before he knew it, lifted the blanket from John and plopped on top of him.
John took their takeaway into the kitchen, storing the remainders in the fridge and tossing the empty containers and plastic utensils in the bin.
With a deep and quiet tone, Sherlock gave step-by-step instructions as he taught John the standard first few steps of the waltz. Everytime John would mess up he would begin to get flustered, but before he could say or do anything, Sherlock’s warm hand would be on his own again and they would restart.
After fifteen minutes and forty-eight seconds, John began to play with Sherlock’s hair. At first, it was the simple movement of him brushing hot curls away from Sherlock’s forehead, which made the detective think he would stop. But he didn’t. And he continued to brush the curls out through course fingers for the rest of the film.
“You said it last night. You love her.”
“Sherlock,” he repeated to her softly one specific night, bouncing her on his hip around the living room as John cooked dinner.
He had dreamt of this moment for years and the heightened emotions were almost too much to handle.
There was only one time John ever saw Sherlock cry, and it was the day Sherlock had called him from the roof of St. Barts.
“Are you her dad?”
“No! No, Christ, Sherlock,” John moved toward his own chair. “I don’t want to dance with you because I don’t want to dance with anyone. I have two left feet and after a few traumatic primary school experiences, swore to myself to never dance again. Especially not in front of people.”
Sherlock closed his eyes.
“Where we going?”
Richard hadn’t even pulled away by the time the six-foot detective was being surrounded by the smells of alcohol pads and clean bed sheets when he walked in the glass doors of the practice. He walked to the front desk with a charming grace but determined aggression that only he could pull off.
He hated to let him down. Sherlock adored the man more than he adored the feeling of adrenaline pumping through his veins after a case. Even more than he loved the feeling of crisp air against his heavily knitted, black billowing coat.
The kiss was warm.
Ten minutes closer to 221 B Baker Street, John’s left hand began to squirm in Sherlock’s grip and, as if it were fire, Sherlock dropped it.
He kissed him once. And then twice.
He sighed. “Listen, it’s not that… it’s not that I don’t want to dance with you at our wedding. I do want to. I just don’t think that three hundred dollar classes are worth it, to be judged and watched by a whole lot of middle-aged strangers.”
Sherlock leaned in and their lips met,
Before she could respond, before Lestrade could call help to the flat, before Mrs. Hudson could bring up the idea of calling Mycroft, John had grabbed his suit jacket from the back of the chair and was sprinting out of his own reception.
He was afraid to make the first move, of course, but spent several hours of his days reliving small moments with John and daydreaming of the things they would be able to do, the holidays they would be able to go on, if they could just profess their love for each other.
“John, I’m sorry to tell you this but I don’t... lay with people.”
John watched the movie.
[Four Days Until the Wedding]
She completely forgot about the syringes lying on the table.
He had a habit of leaving people mid sentence. John said that it was an impolite habit to have, but Sherlock couldn’t understand why John cared when Sherlock never did that to him anymore and actually truly cared about everything the shorter man had to say, filing all things said and mentioned somewhere in his mind palace.
He grimaced. He was hoping she wouldn’t see those, but he underestimated her regularly. She was sometimes sharper than even himself, though he’d never admit it.
“We need music,” Sherlock whispered into John’s ear finally. Their trance broke and they somehow disconnected from each other. John was cold without Sherlock. Sherlock’s arms were empty without John.
They tried to pretend like neither of them were nervous when, on their way out of the glass hospital doors, Sherlock had reached for John’s available hand and John immediately weaved their fingers together. A family, indeed.
Straight-faced and shoulders hard, John pursed his lips.
The smell of new leather from the shoes with the scent of never-worn, freshly ironed fabric surrounded the two men as John stepped into yet another pair of pants. Fountain pen ink and fancy cologne lingered in every inch of the store, making the doctor feel out of place. This store was expensive, the scent of money louder than words.
I know what you’re thinking. Sherlock? Buying groceries?
It was electrifying.
It is done.
John hummed. There wasn’t much else to say.
As Sherlock opened the door to head to the register, he couldn’t help but mutter a comment about the fact that John still looked like a four-year-old playing dress up in his father’s closet. John shouted at him to sod off, Sherlock smirked smugly, and the moment in the dressing room was gone.
John looked at him and he saw the bags under Sherlock’s eyes, the heaviness of the hand on his chopsticks, the frown on his mouth.
“Go home?”
Silence filled the room, before…
Sherlock nodded, understanding, but John could tell he was still in his head.
One of the doctors, a darker-skinned older man with kind eyes and a Mickey Mouse watch, undoubtedly the pediatrician on call, smiled softly at him as he walked her back.
“You think you will, but you won’t. I know you better than you know yourself. The only thing you’ve ever done, Sherlock Holmes, is love and protect me. More than I’ve ever been loved or protected.”
“The school called me. Apparently there was an accident-“
“You don’t dance.”
Sherlock’s throat went dry, his stomach dropping to his feet as John, once again, played with his hair.
Sherlock smiled, helplessly in love, not having anything to say or add. His head was spinning. He was dad. John had kissed him. Rosie was his daughter. Rosie was okay, and -
And then they were gone, leaving a kitchen for Sherlock to tidy and a list of groceries to buy while he waited for Lestrade to call, if and when he did.
“Oh.”
John went home to Mary.
It came out before Sherlock even processed the question. There was no question, not really. He was her dad, and he knew it. He’d just been too afraid to say it.
Standing and walking forward, John gently grabbed his taller friend’s upper arm. Sherlock’s eyes met his, and John smiled softly. “I’m sorry. Would love for you to teach me.”
“Now you know how I feel… ALL OF THE TIME!” Sherlock bellowed.
Sherlock looked back, steadily. “You may think that I don’t listen, that I don’t see when you’re gone, that I’m selfish and only self-seeking. But I do pay attention to you, as you would know if you ever tried to see.”
Sherlock grunted a sound of disgust, one that only John would be able to pick up. John nudged him once again, aggressively whispering “behave” under his breath, mere seconds before the woman had arrived.
Sherlock was convinced that one day, the slow burn was to spike flame and one of them would lean in for a kiss and that would be that for the rest of time. Just the two of them and Rosie: two husbands and their daughter.
“I, John Watson.”
Rosie Watson, fathers John Watson and Sherlock Holmes.
Instantly setting his violin down on his desk, he was at John’s side in a second. “John? John, are you alright?”
“Hmm?”
As always, John’s eyes sought Sherlock’s as Sherlock looked down. Then…
“John, please!”
Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson had to wake up at the break of dawn in order to get ready and travel to the venue in time for John’s wedding preparation. They had the option to stay the night, but both parties opted for the comfort of their somewhat shared home.
A ding rang above them as they walked into the jewelry store. The blinding white walls, the gray carpet and glass cases made Sherlock grimace, gaining a chuckle from John as he lightly bumped shoulders with the detective.
Sherlock melted.
“Christ,” Greg groaned, running a hand over his hair.
It’s useless to say
The taller man cleared his throat. “I’m not scared, John.”
Away from the wedding.
“I don’t - I don’t know if I can do this, Sherlock. I don’t know if I can do it tomorrow. I -”
The last place to look was outside and John took the exit with force as he threw his body against the push bar and jogged into the cold London air, eyes seeking and searching.
Blue met blue. “What do we do now?”
“You don’t want me, John. I don’t feel, I don’t speak, I cannot love properl -”
Sherlock dropped to his knees, arms extended as her little body crashed against his. Immediately, his arms wrapped around her, one supporting her while the other instinctively began to rub small circles on her sob-heaving back. As the wails wrecked her body, he felt her heart beating against his and couldn’t help but feel relieved. She was okay.
“You love her.”
With a few adjusting sounds and rustling, the two ended with Sherlock’s head on John’s chest. At first, he was stiff. Uncomfortable, hesitant, cautious. Then, John haphazardly pulled the blanket over the both of them and joined his hands together atop Sherlock’s back before slowly drawing circles on the fabric of Sherlock’s robe.
[The Morning of the Wedding]
“Stop moping, we are out of there now. But it is eleven at night, so I don’t think there is much to do. Want to go back up to the -”
John smiled at Mrs. Hudson after his dance with his wife and nodded. “It was. It was absolutely stunning. He’s brilliant.”
“I understand that John, but -”
“She is the last thing on my mind when I hear this song, John.”
It was a completely platonic offer, of course. John was straight, John was engaged, John was getting married in four days. He was not a man of interest, but a doctor. A doctor saw a sleep-deprived man and decided to use physical touch as a form of melatonin. Simple as that.
When John spoke, he surprised himself when his voice came out as a whisper. “Good?”
John nodded.  “Yeah. Meet you out there.”
[Two Days Before the Wedding]
To his surprise, John reached back for the hand he had just released. To Sherlock’s greater surprise, the doctor threaded their fingers together, his thumb rubbing a soft line over the back of Sherlock’s hand.
Also known as, the day Sherlock loses his best friend to a never-ending cycle of domestic bliss. Fantastic.
It was casual and confident, solidifying and satisfying. Everything and more and more and more and more and more.
John nodded miserably.
“Hello! Welcome in, welcome in. I’ll take you all to my section right over here,” she said, leading them to a glass case to the right of the store with three black chairs surrounding it.
Instantly, the two fell into synchronized steps, Sherlock shortening his stride to match John’s.
A sob escaped Sherlock’s lips and he gently pushed the doctor away. His eyes were distraught, tears freely falling down his face. His arms wrapped around his own torso, the only thing comforting or protecting him was himself.
“Yes, you can.”
He dodged the people in the crowd like bullets, his eyes seeking out one 6’1 detective.
If it was Lestrade, Sherlock was going to ignore it. The detective inspector had been a bit clingy as of recent; another girlfriend had left him, of course.
To go back to the flat alone.
Worry was erased and replaced with excitement as Mrs. Hudson took her young friend’s forearm and began to chat away about who wrote what and when to read them where.
John raised his hand from Sherlock’s shoulder to the back of his neck while he addressed the doctors. The dark haired man tried to ignore the butterflies that filled his abdomen and focus on the conversation, to no avail.
“I never knew you were such a romantic.”
After a few moments, Sherlock surprised them both as his right hand slowly lifted John’s left to his mouth.
“Sherlock, calm down,” John firmly scolded from the sink, arms covered in dish detergent bubbles.
The man liked to believe that he was invincible and, after telling everyone about how much he hated emotions and people, it was always a shock during moments like these, when he did anything but not care. Sherlock’s heart was thumping in his chest; a bird trying to be free from it’s cage. He grasped the handle of the taxi cab, his alabaster skin even more pale than usual as he was worried to the point of nausea.
Eventually that night, he gave up trying. John took her to bed and assured the detective with a soft rub on the back that they’d try again tomorrow, and she won’t always struggle with speech!
And then he did it AGAIN!
“...What?”
Seeing Sherlock’s mood shift, (so much like a child, that one), John stepped back, shook out his arms and raised his head. “Okay then, ballerina. Teach me.”
About five minutes after that, the shorter man felt his nose and the tips of his ears grow red with heat as his body tried to fight the cold. It was not freezing, nor was it Winter. But it was chilly and, suffice to say, the doctor was not dressed for the occasion.
“John,” Sherlock said, beginning to feel concerned.
“It’s beautiful here at night,” Sherlock said as he kept his eyes focused forward, the water reflecting the London stars that hung above.
Mycroft would think him pitiful, but Sherlock didn’t care. If Mycroft saw the way John smiled at Rosie over a steaming dinner or felt the way John made Sherlock feel when he looked at him like he was the only person in the universe that mattered, or saw the way Rosie’s eyes sparkled in the morning as the two men waltzed around her in habit, feeding her cheerios and milk and kissing her on the forehead... If Mycroft heard Rosie’s giggles at night when John gave her a bath or laid on the coach until late hours of the night with the short soldier, hearing him ramble about insignificant things like Star Wars, Mycroft would love them, too. It was inherently impossible not to, Sherlock had discovered.
Something about Rosie falling, hitting her head, and being scared of the doctors as they gave her stitches which was very normal at that age, especially without parents close by. Here were the bandages to use and come back in three days to get them removed. Oh, it was nice to meet you too, yes you have a good one as well, alright then, man handshake.
Syringe, syringe, syringe.
“Yes, I can kill Mary and make it look like a complete accident so that you don’t have to go through the trauma of committing to someone for the rest of your life and everyone will care for you and bring you homemade food. Just say the word.”
“John.”
John gulped and licked his lips. Sherlock’s eyes slowly sought John’s.
“And if Mary hadn’t… passed on, I would just be a family friend Rosie came to visit every few months. The one you warn her about.”
John broke the kiss and laid his head in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, exhaling heavily for them both to catch their breath.
Was it really bad for Sherlock to pretend it for one night?
John’s face was etched in a grief and displeasure that was too much for the taller man to handle. The detective looked away, when the doctor cleared his throat and continued to type on his laptop. That was that.
They walked into the foyer and Sherlock went straight for the door outside. John followed and the London night air was crisp as John handed Sherlock his dark cloak, shrugging on his own jacket. “What has gotten into you?”
“John,” Sherlock said, his voice barely able to be heard. He laid his head on John’s lightly. Then -
His eyebrows rose when he saw the screen, checking the time on the oven to make sure he had read it right. What was John doing, calling him during office hours?
“OH!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed, smiling. “That’s right. When we left the flat this morning, he had a lot of syringes lined up on the coffee table for some sort of experiment. He seemed adamant about me not touching them. So anal, that one. Who would guess he would be so messy!”
The two men’s relationship had done nothing but evolve each and every day. As time passed, what was once a budding friendship crept closer and closer to a terrifyingly exhilarating romance.
The group erupted in cheers when John interrupted them.
Sherlock stepped closer, wrapping an arm around John’s waist. John instinctively took Sherlock’s hand.
“Oh, it’s -“
John reached his hand out for his friend and Sherlock pulled away.
He looked beautiful.
“Experiment. Promise. It’s nothing. Ready?”
“Why did we ask her to make the cake again?” Sherlock huffed, leaning against Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen counter with his arms crossed.
Once John had learned the standard steps and had gotten used to it, they danced in silence.
“Yeah, mate. Shut up!” Lestrade licked some icing off of his hand. “I think it’s good.”
“I’ve always wanted that.”
John flipped the blanket back over himself and his focus went back to the film, but Sherlock hesitated. When would he ever have the opportunity to lay on John’s chest under the covers in the dark without Mary around after he got married? Or rather, at all?
John stepped forward. He slowly raised his hand to touch Sherlock’s arm, and when he didn’t flail away, squeezed the bicep gently.
He slowly placed a small and warm kiss on John’s palm.
Silence fell yet again.
“To be my wife.”
The Watsons would leave, Sherlock placing a kiss on Rosie’s head and, more recently, receiving a warm embrace from John, always followed by a “I’ll be home soon.”
And then he was alone.
“Well then,” he said with a start, patting Sherlock’s knee and standing up. “Let’s get settled for this movie.”
Don’t get me wrong, dear reader. He was still a child who pouted when John told him he had to eat at least half of the food on his plate and refused to shower on days he didn’t want to get out of bed. Sherlock Holmes was still Sherlock, after all.
“Goodbye, John.”
As John continued to talk and tell Sherlock that he doesn’t know the full extent, they just called him and said that Rosie fell off of the monkey bars and had taken her to Saint Mary’s Hospital and to meet them there, Sherlock was trying to remember how to breathe.
John rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. But you like it? It’s good?”
John gave him a lighthearted smile. “Just think about it, okay? For me?”
He walked to Sherlock and rested a hand on his shoulder, giving it a squeeze and stabilizing himself as he crouched down to Rosie, who had stopped crying and was playing with the buttons on Sherlock’s coat.
Sherlock chuckled, his eyes red as he looked down at John’s hand that reached for his own.
He gently raised his hand to Sherlock’s cheek, warming the taller man’s face with the heat. He moved Sherlock’s face to meet his own.
“You’ll be fine. Don’t be such a baby,” he whispered.
The next day, Sherlock floated into the kitchen from his bedroom, seeking his doctor and their small companion. As he ascended into the room, Rosie giggled from her high chair.
John nodded.
“Sherlock, that is not true.”
“Try to get some rest, Sherlock,” John said, wrapping himself with a blanket at the other end of the couch and turning to watch the movie.
“I came to the flat last night drunk and heartbroken and ruined because I wanted you to give me a reason to stay. I wanted - I don’t want her. I don’t want a life of domesticity with a white picket fence. I want a tiny flat with a crazed and beautiful detective where we solve crimes and fight bad guys and save lives and then come home and snog until we can’t breathe.”
He is soft and he has feelings and he gets tired and he uses lavender shampoo. He is just like the rest of us.
John’s breathing almost immediately quickened and before he knew it, he lost control of his lungs and bent over, hyperventilating.
He just knew that he wanted Sherlock. He’d always known that, but the idea of a life without the detective is not one he would like to experience again.
The living room curtains were closed, the tv off, the kitchen lights off. The only thing lighting the room were a few yellow-tinted lamps. Sherlock had moved the table and chairs, providing a relatively good-sized dance floor, all things considered.
“Good. Good. You’re on your way, that is good.”
“Just adjusting.”
“Come here.”
John smiled, mischievous. “Okay. Then show me.”
“Sherlock, I really need you to respond so that I don’t feel completely in the dark here. Why are you going home? Why are you avoiding this? Why are you in so much pain?”
It was quiet, so John kept talking.
“You’ve been preparing for tomorrow for months. All will be okay.”
Sherlock’s cheeks brushed a light shade of pink.
John didn’t respond, having no answer.
Sherlock really looked at John for the first time since they left the flat and saw that the smaller man was slightly shaking.
“Shut up, John. This place is hell.”
“John, if you don’t take him out for a walk, I think I will get a migraine,” Lestrade groaned across the kitchen counter.
By this time, Laura was almost in tears, face as red as a tomato. Whether she was blushing out of embarrassment or anger, Sherlock didn’t know, nor did he care.
“John!” Sherlock pleaded, meeting his eyes. “These two are ruining everything!” He dramatically displayed them with his hands.
Sherlock could basically see her eyes form into hearts. He rolled his own.
He was tired. Plain and simple.
John’s heart stopped beating as he watched Sherlock with wide eyes as the taller man gently and tenderly held John’s hand to his mouth, exhaling hot air on his bitter hands.
“Sherlock! Sherlock, stop bloody walking!”
“Oh! Congratulations, you two! When’s the wedding?”
They spoke over each other and then John laughed his laugh that always fixes everything, bringing them both back to reality.
“Sherlock Holmes, turn around and speak to me!”
“Sherlock,” John interrupted with a start, his eyebrows threading together. “We’ve had this conversation before. Look at you, oh great consulting detective, brushing her hair while chatting about honey bees. You are -”
“You would eat dirt if someone told you to. Wouldn’t even realize it was soil and not fish and chips.”
“Yes.
Not knowing what exactly to do, Sherlock took one of John’s hands and placed it on his chest, John feeling the slow and steady feeling of Sherlock’s heart.
“Mycroft, please, just tell me he’s all right,” John said. “Do you know where he is? He left, and he’s not in the normal places.”
He tipped his head toward the window.
“Yeah, I have, and yeah, we did, but that doesn’t mean we’re engaged. She’s helping me out with my new cat, he’s a rescue, and sorta nervous.” Greg stared at him. “Mycroft, why are you so...aggressive about this?”
“Oh yes. That was a mistake,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.
“Duchess of Cambridge. The shopkeep. There, solved them both,” Sherlock said, nudging the files off the coffee table with his foot.
“You’ve done that already, haven’t you?”
“You should see this,” Greg said quietly. “Really, My.”
“You thought you loved me. But if you had, this wouldn't have happened. And if you had known the way I loved you, love you still, you never would have let her sit on your lap. I'm nearly surprised you didn't break the chair with your rocking and bouncing, but really, enjoy the memories when you’re sitting there. It's all you'll have now. Be gone from the flat, have all your things moved out in the next two days.” Sherlock turned around, case in hand and headed for the door.
“Africa, perhaps India. Somewhere where he can have mobility. People need good men, good doctors. John Watson needs a place where he can be good, even if he strays.”
Mycroft blinked, looking at him. “You...think this is a date?”
“But...that’s impossible.”
John sighed and came in, picking up the scattered pages, and tossing them down onto Sherlock’s stomach. “You can be an utter tosser sometimes, you know that, right?”
“I’m not going to jump again. Honestly.”
“No, you’re not.” Greg sighed, and leaned forward, rubbing his temples. “Look, Mycroft. Whatever this is...just come out and say it, won’t you? I’m getting damn tired of dancing around the subject, and wondering what we are to each other. I know you’ve seen your own wings changing, and I’m sure that with your job you know a lot of people with silver hair, but I only know one person with red hair.” He propped his elbows on his knees, eyes fixed on Mycroft. “So. You wanna get coffee or something? Might make for a better date than being interrogated over my relationship with Molly Hooper.”
“I never would have thought you would the first time,” John said coldly. “Are you done up here?” He stalked away, though he didn’t enter the stairwell until he was sure Sherlock was following.
“Wait, what?” Greg looked up to find Sherlock gone, and a dark car idling at the curb. He sighed, signalling to Sally. “Going back to the office,” he called. “You’re in charge.” She nodded, and Greg ducked under the tape, going over and getting in the car. “Mycroft. Sherlock says hello.”
“No, no, John.” Sherlock scrambled up, running down the hall. He was back before John even had a moment to question, shoving a box at him. “I’ve been preening them. You couldn’t see them, I didn’t want you to know, you’d leave and then…” Sherlock opened the box, showing the muddled black and blond feathers.
“And you don’t? Ever?” Sherlock asked, scowling as he snapped his wings back.
John Watson?”
John took another sip, choking as Mycroft’s gaze turned on him, cold and calculating, intended to stop his thoughts in their tracks. The choking caught Sherlock’s attention, and the man came over, snapping at Greg as he checked on John, shuffling his wings in concern. John waved him off, and escaped up to his room, watching out the window as Greg stalked off, and the shouting from below resumed as Sherlock started in on his brother.
Mycroft waited a moment, and then there was a sudden click, and the tone of an empty line came through the receiver. He sighed, and hung up the phone. “Gregory? What is it?”
“Send him where?”
Greg sighed, and took Mycroft’s hand, leading him over to the edge of the bed, and sitting down. He tugged Mycroft to stand between his knees, looking up at him. “I love you, My. And you know I love Sherlock. But do you honestly think that he’s going to be able to start over this time? John was…. he was something different for Sherlock. ”
“Since the very first day he arrived. The case, Lestrade.” Sherlock looked down at him, holding out his hand.
Anthea raised her eyebrows, and then gave a small sigh. “Would you like a list of all acquaintances you have with silver wings sir?”
John smiled. “Yes. Please do.” He tilted his head, and pressed their lips together, seeking out a chaste kiss.
“Not right now,” John sighed, folding his wings back, aware of the officers watching them both. “I’m gonna go for a walk, pick up milk. Just...I’ll see you at home.”
“This all?” Greg asked, flipping it open.
“No, I haven’t. Please, it didn’t mean anything, I didn’t think, I wasn’t thinking.”
Sherlock always knew that John would stray. It was inevitable. John ran.
“Sherlock?”
Greg sighed, and reached into his coat, pulling out a notebook. “This is all I have. Enjoy. Molly will let you in to see the body and a few other bits you might enjoy.”
“They are,” Mycroft replied. “But that does not mean the choices and pheromones our bodies change in reaction to are without merit. I...do not date. If this is to be something, it must be concrete, and committed.”
“I love you, John. I will not say it often.” Sherlock searched John’s eyes. “I won’t change. This won’t change me.”
Mycroft blinked. “So you are not involved with Miss Hooper?”
“Sherlock…” John reached out, touching his wings gently. “It doesn’t matter when it happens...It’s happened now.”
“So?”
“Long enough.”
“Sherlock. Wait-” John reached out, grabbing Sherlock by the wrist, tugging him back.
“And how is Miss Hooper?” Mycroft asked.
“What, Gregory?”
“If you’d known, you would have left,” Sherlock said slowly, closing the box. “You would have. They started changing the very first day. Yours...they only started changing now.” He turned away, setting the box on his chair.
“An Elegy for the Arctic. How very telling, brother mine,” Sherlock said quietly.
“It has been so before,” Mycroft replied. “And now it seems it will be happening again.”
Sherlock smirked, and turned back, striding over to the desk. “Play a game?”
“It’s a simple case. I could do it myself, but you’re so better suited,” Mycroft said, obviously bored with the whole ordeal. “Missing locket, heart shaped diamond broken into pieces, the contents stolen from a palace function. I can’t be bothered.”
?” he sneered. “Didn’t think, wasn’t thinking, didn’t mean anything. Words, John! Just silly words. Congratulations, really. You've done what so many have tried and failed to do, and then threw it away for a quick
“Why not?” John suddenly felt his stomach drop as he saw Sherlock’s wings, still just as black as they were the day they’d met. “Oh. Oh. I...Oh. Right. Sorry. Just cause mine are...you know. Doesn’t mean….Right.”
Sherlock met him halfway, in this as in all things, hungry and dominating, seeking control with only half an idea of what he was doing or where he'd end up.
Mycroft looked at their joined hands, and then brushed his thumbs over Greg’s knuckles. “I am aware. And I do not know what this will mean for my brother, but I must trust that he will be able to continue on without John.”
Sherlock scoffed and fluttered his wings, turning away from the roof’s edge. “Honestly, John. Does he think I would repeat the last rooftop incident?”
“Oi. I’m talking to you,” John said, swatting his nose with the edge of his wings. “In fact-”
“That won't be necessary, I'm quite capable of sorting this out myself.”
Sherlock smirked, fingers steepled under his chin.
Sherlock gave a small shuffle of his wings. “John, I don’t think-”
“His wings finally changed,” Sherlock replied, looking up. “Continue on with this...idiocy. Explain the case you have for me.”
Greg stared at him. “Are you joking? He can’t delete someone. Not really.”
“You pulled them out?” John ran his hands through the feathers. “But…”
“Ah. Mrs. Hudson. I suggest you go away for a few days,” Sherlock said, pausing at the curious voice. “There will be movers in.”
Greg smiled, relieved as he curved his own, showing off his inner feathers and the distinctly red tones of the new growth. “Thank god,” he said quietly. “Thought you’d be one of those pragmatic wankers and wouldn’t admit this meant we were matched. That wing colors are just all a crazy evolutionary development.”
Sherlock cracked one eye open. “What is it?” He sat up, blinking in surprise. “The teacher?”
Groaning, John rolled onto his stomach, letting his wings flare out and relax, closing his eyes as he listened to Sherlock and Mycroft’s grumbling.
“Uh….What’s that now?” Greg asked, at a complete loss as he looked Mycroft up and down.
“You’ve been meeting with her regularly. At her flat. You brought her lunch, just recently, and you both went out to a restaurant.”
Sherlock drew back, wings drooping. “John?”
The last word was spat with enough force to make John step back, eyes wide.
“Sherlock Holmes
“Yes. Installed in a motel, and still hoping you’ll take him back, if I’m not mistaken.” Mycroft straightened up, and stood, closing the lid over the piano keys. “Will you?”
It is an original piece written by and performed by Ludovico Einaudi. The linked performance was one played on a floating platform in front of a glacier in the Arctic Ocean to call for its protection.
“Do you think…” Greg shook his head. “Never mind.”
“Really, Sherlock? Am I?” John set his jaw, wings tense. “Wonder bloody why.”
Mycroft blinked after her. “Honestly. I will never understand that woman.” He stood, taking the oil with him into the bathroom, rolling his eyes as the phone call continued on.
“As normal I suppose?”
“I’m rather surprised it took you so long to call. Yes, Sherlock is ‘all right’ and yes, I do know his location. You however, will no longer be privy to such information.” Mycroft leaned back in his chair, twirling a pen as he kicked his legs up onto his desk. “I’m going to put this in no uncertain terms. You’re to stop calling Inspector Lestrade, Miss Hooper, and most importantly, Sherlock. You will have your things cleared from Baker Street in the next day, as that is the end of the timeline Sherlock set for you, and you will not attempt to return there to speak to him.”
“Wait, Sherlock! Why don’t you-” Greg was cut off with the slam of the front door, and he sighed, taking his seat again, listening as Mycroft started to play once more. After a long moment, he got up, taking up his mug of tea, and going into the library, leaning against the door frame. “Will he be all right?” he asked quietly.
“I used to think I was an idiot.”
John shook his head, watching Greg and Sherlock argue. At first, he’d thought that maybe the pair were soulmates. But then he’d seen the way Mycroft’s feathers were slowly bleeding sliver, the tips looking as if they’d been swirled in a canister of molten nickel. And the way Greg’s under feathers were shot through with auburns and ambers.
“Change the subject. Now,” Mycroft said coldly.
“He will start over. As he always does.”
“A bit.” John ground his teeth, following Sherlock away.
Sherlock looked up as a crack of thunder jolted him from his mind. He swayed slightly, moving over to the window, and looking out. “The only constant,” he murmured, “in an ever changing world.” He sank back into armchair, staring out the window and at the traffic moving by, their headlights foggy refractions on the glass.
bedroom, but wasn’t really anymore, wasn’t anyone’s bedroom and shut the door. John came down after him, knocking gently, pleading. Sherlock ignored him, and locked the door with a quiet
Mycroft shifted, sitting properly at his desk once more. “I can only assume you were going to say I am a piece of work, and I assure you I am. As well as icy, cold, arctic, heartless, and whatever you wish to throw at me. By all means, Doctor Watson, throw the entire book. But understand this. First, I will do whatever is necessary to protect my brother, and that does include protecting him from you. Second, you are at fault for what has occurred here. This is your fault and you did quite enjoy yourself, so do not continue with petty excuses, and empty apologies. Deep down, you are relieved at being free, even if guilt drives you to grovel.” Mycroft held up a hand as Greg slipped into the office, shifting anxiously at the door. “And finally, Sherlock will not ever let you back in. Give up. Find somewhere that you can be of use, and go there. If you wish, I will assist you. I think we can both agree that it would be best if you were no longer in London. You know how to contact me.”
“Yet you seem to assume I do,” Sherlock replied, opening the box and spreading the cards out. “So brother mine, bring me a worthwhile case or get out of my hair.” He narrowed his eyes, picking up a card. “Go fish.”
“Can’t handle a broken heart? How very telling.” Sherlock gave his brother a smirk.
“Perhaps you did. Or do. I don’t quite know any longer, and I can’t be bothered looking. But you run, John. You stray from anything that has the power to make you happy. And I won’t be a part of that. I’ve fought for too long to have myself. I won’t give myself to someone else who will simply leave.” Sherlock turned again, and left, his steps on the stairs measured and steady, John staring after him.
Sherlock paused, spinning around to face him. “You’re angry.”
“Sherlock.”
“He has before. For the most part.” Mycroft glanced at the window. “There were two times he’s done this. Redbeard he replaced with ash. Victor he replaced with a seven percent solution. They’re nothing but faint memories now. Life lessons if you’d rather look at it that way.”
“Dr. Watson.”
“But I need-”
“Sherlock, please. Just let me explain.”
Sherlock tipped their foreheads together, wrapping his wings around John. “So...Can I stop plucking them?”
“Of course. Pick up lye.” Sherlock turned, walking back to the crime scene.
“The yoga instructor then?”
“No. I’ve learnt my lesson.” Sherlock looked away, looked out the window, eyes focused on a distant point. “Many times,” he murmured, almost soft, almost inaudible.
“You don't get to touch me,” Sherlock said, voice icy, cracking slightly. “Never again will you touch me.”
Sherlock swept back over to Greg, ignoring the shocked looks he was getting.
The slap echoed off the walls, and John’s hand dropped limply from Sherlock’s arm.
“Sherlock. Don’t, please,” John said weakly, looking up at him. “I love you.”
“It wasn’t like this an hour ago,” Greg whispered, gesturing to the room Sherlock was staying in. “He just got back.”
“What was that about?” Greg asked, looking at him in confusion. “You and John...when did that happen?”
He picked up a deck of cards, tossing it at his brother.
When John’ family life went down, he ran to school and completed med school a year early. When John’s relationship with his long term girlfriend whose name Sherlock ignored, but couldn’t delete, because it was about John, broke up, and he was searching for a purpose again, that wasn’t long overnight hours in the A&E patching up drunkards with broken bones and drug addicts who swore the needle had just gotten stuck in their foot and children with sick bellies only because they had a book report due in the morning, John strayed. He strayed to Afghanistan, only on someone else’s orders, not his own, and Sherlock pretended not to know that that was an oddity for John. Finding that orders were something he wanted, and could handle.
“Your betrothal,” Mycroft repeated.
“So, do we have a case then?” John asked, coming down once he saw Mycroft had left and flipping on the kettle.
“She’s fine I suppose. Unless Sherlock goes and causes trouble for her, I just sent him that way to see the body.” Greg shrugged. “Why?”
“Probably something about trying to make friends.”
Mycroft gave him a sarcastic smile. “Friends. Of course, you go in for that sort of thing now.” He gestured up the stairs. “Feathers need a bit of preening, Sherlock.”
“Don’t be smart.”
“So...what happens now?” Greg asked looking out the window with him, frowning as a first few raindrops hit the glass.
“I said not now!” John snapped, shoving Sherlock’s hand off his shoulder and turning, wings flaring out.
“I’ve been preening them, Lestrade, do keep up.”
“First few days then?” Greg looked up at him, crossing his arms.
“Movers?” Mrs. Hudson gave him a scandalized look. “What do you need movers for?”
John sighed, rubbing his temple. “She has grey wings. And I haven’t seen her for three months now.”
Mycroft sighed. “If you seem slow to me, Sherlock, can you imagine what real people are like? I’m living in a world of goldfish.”
“How...You’re a-”
Greg nodded, and brought Mycroft’s hand to his lips, pressing them to his knuckles.
John smiled, the kind that had his eyes wrinkle at the corners, and his ears get a tiny flush at the tips. “Good. Good.”
Mycroft turned as the last strains of the piano faded out. “You’re awake,” he replied. “Very good. You need to have another shake.”
Sherlock was in the taxi now. He covered the speaker of the phone with his hand, muttering the address to the driver before going back to his best friend. “What do you mean you don’t know?”
His words tapered off before he finished the thought, and the two men faced each other for a few seconds. Sherlock looked at their feet while John desperately sought his eyes.
Slowly and quietly, Ray Charles’ voice filled the flat. Sherlock turned his volume up a few notches, before walking back to John.
In a way, there was no need for the name. A year previous, the toddler had named him herself. As Rosie began to grow and form words such as “dada”, Sherlock had tried to teach her his first name.
Their tears flowed together as they desperately grasped whatever they could touch.
“DADDY!”
The doctors protested, trying to catch her and lay her back down on the hospital bed, but she pulled away, her little feet and flushed face seeking out her Bee.
and needing.
“I said, come here.”
Going back and settling on the couch, Sherlock was still curled up in the corner with his knees to his chin. John reached for the remote and after pressing a few buttons, the classic Alfred Hitchcock film Rear Window’s theme song began to fill the flat as the movie started.
The group looked toward the Irish voice behind him and saw Janine, both hands carrying champagne glasses. She handed one to Mary, who took it gratefully.
[The Wedding]
Every move Sherlock made was nervous. His hesitancy to touch John was apparent as he took a step forward, his hand hovering above the shorter man’s waist, unsure.
“We should head back to the flat, you shouldn’t be out here improperly dressed.”
“Sherlock, hey,” the doctor’s voice was rushed. “You home? I need you to go to the hospital.”
The exhaustion from being with John every day, looking into his dark blue eyes and knowing that those eyes weren’t his to look into. Exhaustion from knowing that John was only with Sherlock for a few hours and a few thrills, but would always go home to Mary.
Sherlock merely hummed in response, hesitant to pull away and cold when his arms were empty.
“Okay! Okay, okay,” John said, drying his hands and speed walking for the detective. He grabbed him by the forearm, heaving Sherlock toward the door. “We will be back. The cake looks beautiful, Mrs. Hudson.”
She was talking to him. She was holding onto him. She was putting all of her grievances, all of her worries, on him.
If you want.”
“Please,” Sherlock begged, his voice breaking. “Let me go.”
In the fitting room, Sherlock had been sitting on the bench as his friend had tried on suit after suit, always finding a flaw. Too long, too short, too boxy, too tight. Sherlock had given up trying to help after John was offended by his comment comparing him to the Pillsbury doughboy.
That man had been a Godsend.
“I …I can’t find my way…Myc…” The younger man’s tone seemed sullen and far away, something lingering in the timber. Of course, he was high.
The torture, the fear, all the things Sherlock quietly carried because he thought he wasn't 'human' and he wasn't 'normal' enough. That things would be better for john better for everyone if he hadn't come back. All these dark echos that choked out a brilliant mind and drove it to this.
The posh agent stood tall adjusting his shirt cuffs before lifting his suit jacket from a nearby table. Taking a moment to push away any dust before slipping it on. Anthea standing to his right pulled a handgun from her belt holding it at the ready.
"Hello Nurse! I think I got burned on that one lovely, yes..I think this will be fun indeed."
Pairing: Irene Adler / Molly Hooper
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
Because someone was waiting for him.
Mycroft would always remember the young woman next to him grabbing his hand when the words came from the surgeon’s lips.
Hopefully.
“What is it Mycroft!”
The muffled sound of shouting from the sofa was worth it. Maybe know Sherlock would learn to let well enough alone.
"Such a gentleman, I'm sure your mummy would be proud." Her lips quirking in a little smile.
“Oh? You mean as you do. Tell me have you let your little goldfish catch a whiff yet Mycroft.”
There is clarity in pain, when the adrenalin subsides and your mind slips into a low hum. When all those simple things become clear.
Moriarty clapped his hands spinning around. "Clever! Indeed it did but satisfaction!...brought her back. Much like a dear friend of ours."
Greg just threw his arms wild with a dry laugh, "Take the house, sell it burn it I don't care, here ya know what take the keys to both the cars. I can drive the panda," He fished the yes from his pocket and tossed them at her feet. "Should I take the pictures when I go? Clear you don't want those, that's just proof I ever lived here at all."
Molly stepped back surprised in herself as-well. "I ..should be getting back to Barts."
Nightmares, those where the worst. John knew the horror that could lurk in the dreaming mind, but this.. this was more. In those days since returning to 221b, John learned more about Sherlock through the haze of withdrawal babbled terrors that he had since the mans return.
Finally when the tremors stopped John pulled back to look at his friend and former flatmate. That's when he saw it, the marks on the detectives arms. A trail of treacherous little injection sites, all the other signs where there as well under the Doctors trained eyes. Constricted pupils that would not hold his gaze, pale skin, it broke Johns heart.
It wasn’t until the 3rd ring and no message alert that Sherlock finally had it and snatched the offending cellular off the table.
Sherlock was standing in the lab of St. Barthelme's when he first met John.  The first time he deduced them man he waited to be told off immediately, but that didn't happen.
Sherlock looked up from his microscope wrinkling his nose. “Do be careful John, by my calculations the amount of venereal disease has increased in the last decade. In-fact you might want to stay home all together”
The young coroner sat on the exam table her back to the door, she leaned back her hands behind her clasping the cold steel lip of the table. Molly shivers wearing only a thin black slip, bare foot with no undergarments. All as directed, all she followed to the letter. Her hair was down,she had no jewellery on no make up. Nothing but silk and flesh.
Mycroft was up and slipping out of his night clothes switching the phone to speaker smoothly. “Where are you, look around you and tell me what you see Sherlock.”  He had to keep calm.
That's when the tears finally came, he had never cried for all the force and pain that had been inflected on him but this, realizing he had lost. He would never see his John again... it wrecked him to the core. A bitter sob ripped from his throat, the sound a horse screaming wail that turned the stomach. " I don't want to die... please.. I'm not finished yet! "
All in all the trip hadn't been so bad, they wouldn't be starving to death anytime soon. Not that Mrs. Hudson or Sherlock's Mum would allow that anyway. Speaking of the later he really hoped Sherlock remembered to wrap the gift he'd picked out to be from the both of them before they had to leave in the morning.
Jim smirked licking at the traces of shimmery lip gloss left from her kiss. "Parting is such sweet sorrow. " He  flourished a bow kissing her hand. "Until next time ."
“Doubtful John, all information is useful and if it isn't I can always delete it.” yes because that was so easily done wasn't it? After all he had deleted the entire solar system, John didn't think that was possible and yet he had.
This wasn't rational, she should run away she should be disgusted. But she wasn't, this was physical attraction and nothing seemed to stop it as her hand shot out griping the mans tie and jerking him back for a searing kiss that she dominated fiercely.
Just another day for the British Government.
"Sherlock!"
The captive laughed and spit in Mycrofts direction "go to hell Mr. Holmes, I know who you are and I do not fear some pudgy man in a three piece suit."
He tried to concentrate on breathing. Inhale, exhale, just like that just relax. You’ve been shot. He kept trying to remain calm as the warm life giving blood soaked through his vest. He needed to live, he needed to get home.
Johns blurry vision lifted looking to the open bedroom door, he staggered down the hall to the little table next to his chair. His gun was there in the drawer, the dark thought crossed his mind more than once these days. The deadly implement whispering sweet promises, he could follow Sherlock just like he always did. Then he would hear a voice of silken baritone,
I have discovered the name for the pain that stabs through my chest when he leaves with some woman for the evening. It's called jealousy, noun, plural; derived from the old French word
Molly swallowed letting out a breath, she was ready. " Yes Mistress"
Mycroft thought about what he was about to ask, he knew what it would mean; it was something he had wanted for so long. "My home is very large, and it's just I there. I assume Caroline wishes to sell this home in order to split the selling price. What I'm trying to ask Gregory is... if you and the children, if you would like to come and live with me?"
“I’m taking a risk even letting you in here, I won’t have a junkie tampering with evidence as well, so you sober up then I’ll give you a case.”
"Sherlock .." John couldn't bring himself to ask why. After seeing what he just walked in on, seeing the state of Sherlock's body. He could already tell there was allot he didn't know and any number of reason that the brilliant detective could have fallen back on old demons.
Mycroft smirked spitting out a line of blood, he was surprisingly calm for a man who had been kidnapped by terrorists and beaten with an inch of his life. However, he'd never give them what they wanted. "Should I be worried? Somehow I do not believe that I'm the one in danger here."
He knows, he knows and for all the British government and its posturing, he is too weak to stop me. On the other hand, maybe he just does not care anymore. Maybe he never really did, he abandoned me. John abandoned me.
Johnlock
This will be a 4-part piece and my first adventure into this verse. I’m gunna be honest this is my guilty pleasure, and I adore Omega Sherlock.  I just hope you all will love it to and be gentle with me. Kudos are love and Comments are great as long as they are not snotty.
He had shouted in a fit of anger and told Mycroft directly, “I’m done! Loss my number forget my face! You might be the bloody British Government and you might have some say over the Yard but don’t you stand there and Lord over me you posh bastard, I may not be as smart as you Myc but I’m not stupid.”
