“I don’t know. I used to want to be a pirate, but...” Sherlock said, shrugging his shoulders.
“I think you’re wearing too many clothes.”
“To hang out...“
Sherlock let out a strangled moan as a shudder ran through his body at the thought.
“I sang.”
“Don’t think I didn’t see what you were doing.”
I rush to his side, and crouch down on the floor.
“Get up on the table.”
“I agree.”
“Mmm?” Sherlock ventured, not looking up from the sink.
“Anyway, Thank you for everything-“
“Word of advice; don’t have children.”
“Are you sure the others aren’t going to walk in- mmm!” Sherlock trailed off when he felt John run his finger over his slit, his fingers digging in to the work surface.
There’s nothing that pleases me more than seeing a soaking wet Sherlock on my bed, hair all awry, fresh out of the shower.
“John?”
They both remained quiet for a minute, absolutely awestruck.
“Neither do I, normally. But I like him.”
John.
“Well... I don’t know if we’ll be welcome back here... because I’m pretty sure Mrs Hudson heard everything.”
John furrowed his eyebrows after asking, wondering why he cared about sherlock’s relationships.
John folded the page down to show to his mother later on.
A being who needed her.
Sherlock braced himself on John’s shoulders, elbows locked in position.
Sherlock nodded, then dismounted John. The blond chuckled as the other boy squirmed in discomfort as they walked up the stairs to the bathroom.
“I’m fine.” The curly haired girl insisted, swatting her mother’s hand away from her cheek.
“I’ll see you later.”
John age: 10
“Please Mama.”
“Rather boring.” John muttered, stuffing a chocolate bourbon into his mouth.
“Yes.”
“Yeah, I know. You wouldn’t believe how many remotes it’s eaten.” John chuckled, running his hand through his blond tresses.
Harriet gave Sherlock a knowing smile before steering her mother out of the room. Sherlock raised the phone to her ear with a shaking hand.
He wanted to be sheathed deep inside sherlock’s body when he felt his muscles clenching down.
John kissed him full on the mouth, gliding his tongue along, but not parting his lips. He pulled back to grip the base of his pulsing, red cock, and line himself up with Sherlock’s entrance. After a quick look up at Sherlock, John tantalisingly slowly sank his thick cock into his channel.
“You know... I never would have pegged you for a drug addict.”
I miss his temple before reaching for the best on the floor.
“Sherlock?”
April fools. Arguably one of the worst days ever, to the people who lived with Sherlock anyway. The others were all fully aware of Sherlock’s fondness of using his brain for evil. If the opportunity arose to create some drama, Sherlock could almost certainly be found in the middle of it. Everyone was on edge, just waiting for him to strike. He’d started off with simple pranks, switching the salt and sugar, setting people’s phones in jelly; the cliche tricks. But last year, he’d really upped the ante, and now, they were all sat in their living room, waiting for him to strike. John in particular was watching his boyfriend with caution. Said brunette was currently perched on the kitchen island, swinging his legs back and forth in a juvenile fashion.
He hops off the bed and makes a move to leave, but he falters a moment at the doorway. He turns back to face me, and looks at me through his dark lashes with his bright cat eyes.
“Oh, yeah ok.”
“Fair point. Don’t exactly do as you’re told, do you?”
Sherlock nodded as she stared blankly out the window, watching the scenery fly by.
“You look awful.”
“Mmmmm... Sherlock...”
“Ah!” The brunette gasped, dropping his hips, and turning to glare at John.
“It’s getting better.” He said honestly, moving his hips a little from where he was pinned underneath the other boy’s weight.
It was weird. It didn’t hurt, but it was definitely weird.
The officer paused for a moment before finally coming to his senses.
“You’re still sober! Start putting them away! Drink!”
“I haven’t see your smile in a long time.”
“Yes. I do.”
“Thank you John for coming. You didn’t have to.” Mrs Holmes said, placing a hand on his shoulder.
“Inmate. A word, please.”
On the one hand, I’m pissed as fuck at him because how dare he do this do himself, but on the other... I feel sorry for him.
“It’ll take a long time to come to terms with it, but you’ll get there. You didn’t murder anyone.”
John leaned in towards him, and pressed his lips up against Sherlock’s. He would have pulled back after if he hadn’t felt Sherlock’s hands move to grip his shoulders. He could feel that the narrow teen was shaking. Sherlock, who was so sure of everything, and confident to the point of obnoxious, but was reduced to a simpering mess in johns arms. John snaked his arms around Sherlock’s waist, pulling him closer. He felt him relax against him at this. John ran his tongue along the brunette’s soft, plump lips. A small moan escaped Sherlock, which turned into a whine when John slipped his tongue into his mouth. When they pulled apart, they stared at each other, eyes hooded.
“Are you making tea?” Sherlock asked as she spotted Mrs Hudson in the kitchen.
“Do you like this?” John cooed, grinning as he watched Sherlock flail about in pleasure.
“Happy?” Mycroft mused. “I feel something much akin to the emotion. I will say though, that I’m glad she has somebody besides myself to burden with her absurdity.”
John wouldn’t be back before the baby was born.
They sat in a comfortable silence while they drank their tea, and ate their biscuits, but Sherlock had far too many questions to keep quiet.
“Oh!” He gasps all of a sudden, his eyes going wide.
John placed a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s lips, then he reached down between them, and grasped his leaking cock. Sherlock felt arousal pooling in his stomach as John got closer to where he desperately needed to be touched. This was happening. He was about to lose his virginity. He was going to have sex. And it was all with John. He felt his heart rate slow down as he looked at the golden boy between his legs. John, whom he loved so much, and trusted whole heartedly. He closed his eyes, then gasped audibly when he felt the tip of Johns shaft press against his virgin hole.
“You seem so unfazed by all this.”
“It’s cool.”
Sherlock stilled his actions as he felt John reaching around behind him.
“Sorry about him, by the way.”
The movie was fantastic.
Pupils wide. Red cheeks. Shoulders heaving. Heart racing.
Hi guys! Thanks for the suggestions and comments. I seriously suggest you listen to the song mentioned in this chapter. WARNING! Drunk, (consesnsual)  sex in this chapter. Always consensual, just thought I should say. They’re slightly out of character here because booze... Also, the end takes a weird tangent, I just wanted to add to Molly’s character. Sorry if it’s a bit odd.
“You can’t get out of this just because I love you.” I whisper quietly.
“Oh, Sorry.” She chuckled. “I love you too, John. Very much. Really I do.”
John and Sherlock start to explore another side of sex.
I grin, and press a kiss to the corner of his lips.
“The hallway is clear. Come on.”
“Sherlock...” He groaned, his pelvis bucking forward involuntarily.
Sherlock felt the hair in the back of his neck stand up.
“Really?”
John knew it was a stupid idea.
“Are you alright?”
“I got bored.” He murmurs as he scrapes off a bit of dried paint from his jeans.
This was going to be fun.
Sherlock furrowed his brows.
I can just about make out his dark hair through the frosted texture of the glass panel in the door.
Then he whispers the request I didn’t think I’d hear from him in such words.
Well, being a high functioning sociopath has its perks, he thought to himself, trying to prevent a chuckle from escaping his lips.
“Course it is.” Sherlock said.
John caught Sherlock’s chin in his hand, forcing him to look up at him.
“Correct answer.” Sherlock chuckled, settling himself in the chair opposite John.
The blond was staring at him intently, his eyes darkened with arousal, which was also evident by the tent in his jeans. Sherlock licked his lips as he stared down at the bulge, his own cock throbbing.
"That... that thing you did... back there. Thank you." Sherlock said after a moment.
“Oh, Mycroft, leave him alone.”
“Yes.” He beamed.
He grabs my face in his hands, and pulls me in to a desperate kiss.
“Thanks.” I say somewhat cautiously when she steps back.
“Oh. Ok” Sherlock tried to hide the hurt in his voice. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Can I change the bandages on your leg?”
“It was alright, actually.”
“I love you.”
She wished her voice didn’t sound as horse as it did.
“Hey! Who the fuck do you think you are, telling me what to do?!”
He retaliated in a fit of giggles, turning around in the tub, and splashing John with a large amount of soapy water.
“Just something I bought earlier.”
Those were some of the only syllables Sherlock had muttered all week, and was letting the tragic melodies she played on her violin speak for her. Mrs Holmes had gone to visit Mycroft who had a house a few doors down.
“Ok. I can’t wait to see you again.”
John turned to look at Sherlock, his lips pursed, and eyebrows raised.
Sherlock deals with her feelings.
“You’ve had sex.” Mycroft remarks all of a sudden.
“Hi.” Sherlock giggled as he looked over at John.
“You know I’m not as good at these games are you are.”
He sighed before nodding his head with a chuckle.
“Alright.”
Sherlock smiled internally, and kept working his head up and down. John was so close already. The sight before him was sinful. Sherlock, blindfolded, tied up, and with his perfect, plump lips wrapped round his penis. Sherlock knew exactly how to please John. He moaned, and swallowed round johns dick, making the athlete cry out, and grip the back of his head. He came hard down Sherlock’s throat, strands of creamy fluid filling his mouth. The brunette gagged, but managed to swallow after a moment.
The lanky teen complied, and allowed himself to melt in to John’s touch as his cock stirred to attention, his fingers reaching to grip the countertop.
I can see the hickeys John left on my skin, I can smell his aftershave in the air... I can still feel his cum inside me.
“I mean, he was here for a while and I never saw him do anything but read. Why all the hobbies now? I suppose he was occupied.” She muses.
John age: 20
“Thank you, by the way.” I grin as I press a kiss to his slightly parted lips.
“But, they already know I wasn’t in that dorm.”
Sherlock withdrew and flopped back down on the mattress with a whine of irritation.
He lets out a whimper, but the previously established safe word, ‘September’, doesn’t pass his lips.
John leant in by his ear, and whispered huskily.
John grinned widely.
30th of March 1918
“Why? Where are we going?”
He’ll still want me.
“Do you worry that he’s too much like me.”
“Fuck. Should we go after her?”
She broke off in to a run.
He started when he felt Sherlock’s hand on his arm.
“Come find me tomorrow after lunch. We’ll talk then, ok?”
Sherlock drew his bottom lip between his teeth as he considered what he wanted to say.
“Like what?”
“Fuck, you get me so hot.”
Sherlock age: 16
“John?”
“Come here.” John chuckled, guiding Sherlock towards him by the shoulders.
“But he’s alive. We know that.”
He moaned when he felt John attach his lips to the base of his throat, a moan that turned in to a squeak when johns hands cupped his ass, moving his hips faster.
“Shhhh...” John chuckles with a light shake of his head.
“Yes.” He practically pleaded. “Yes, I’ve been bad... I...Mmmm... john...” Sherlock whined, arching his back as John dragged his tongue down his lean body.
John and Sherlock do a little shopping, and try something new.
After Sherlock had finished off her ice cream, they set off to look for the head teacher and Sherlock’s further classmates.
“Bally corset.” He grumbled, and cast it aside.
“Yes- ahh...” he groans, arching his back off the cushions. “That’s good...”
Why did I say that?
Sherlock pouted playfully, and dropped his head against johns chest.
“Shall we go straight from work?”
John, desperate to chase after the pleasurable sensations he was feeling didn’t hesitate before bucking his hips forwards.
John chuckled, and shook his head.
“Hello, darling. What are you doing here?”
I’m cut off by him slamming our lips together.
“Yes mother.”
“Do you want sit down on the bed for me?” John purred.
“Sherlock...” The blond groaned softly, his pelvis tilting forwards.
“What?”
“Mum...”
Normally he was thrilled to hear from Sherlock, but mornings were not his thing in the slightest.
Sherlock age: 11
“Call an ambulance!”
“Poor Mycroft.” Irene chuckled.
“No.” Sherlock said rather abruptly, her mother evidently hitting a nerve.
John smiled warmly at her this time.
“The only way to do this without you guessing would be to do it out of the blue, so that’s what I’m doing. I uhh... I would get on one knee, but uhh...” he chuckled wearily as he reached in to his pocket.
Mycroft smirked at them both before slipping away in to his room.
He curls up against my side, and nuzzles his head in to my chest as I wrap my arms around him.
“Come on then.”
“You can’t work it out, and it’s driving you crazy. You can’t work it out because you are like everyone else.”
He places a hand on my knee and squeeze.
Neither of them had the bottle to answer.
Then I feel panic seeping in as I remember what we were doing before that.
“Bye.”
He reached around behind me, and spanked my ass so hard it forced me in to him.
Sherlock let go of her locket, and ran back into the house, the cool metal bouncing against her sternum as she moved.
John got to his feet with some difficulty, then reached into his pocket for his cigarettes. The packet was empty for all but one. He held the final cigarette in his hand for a moment.
Sherlock shuddered, and clenched his fists.
John took the letter and parcel with a smile.
Sherlock ran out of the bar, leaving John to stare after him.
“You know, I’m gonna sit down here with you today.” He says as he sits down opposite me.
Sorry this is overdue, rushed, and a filler. I hope you enjoy anyway!
“Hey baby, I didn’t know you were going to come.”
“God...” He moaned as John began to deepen his trusts, their hips grinding together.
While sherlock was remarkable and differed from everyone else in all other manners, when it came to the trails and tribulations of motherhood, she was absolutely no different to everyone else.
“I like your pyjamas.”
John leaned over, and pressed a kiss to his temple.
“To be decided.” She smirked at the blonde over her mug of tea.
I just feel myself sinking in to them, and god I almost hate myself for it, but I trust him whole heartedly.
I’m not going to last a second longer in this position.
“Thank you for this.” She said quietly, stroking his cheek.
Mycroft chuckled, but cut himself off when his mother turned to glare at him. She was the only person Mycroft listened to.
Oh, how cliche.
-love John x
John began pounding in to Sherlock with abandon, hips snapping forwards, burring himself to a hilt.
I look down at the red and purple mark just over from my left hipbone and feel a similar colour spread on to my cheeks.
John actually kissed me.
“Have to put that to good use later.”
Sherlock chewed the inside of her cheek.
“John...” He whimpered, his eyelids fluttering.
He looks so... peaceful.
He’s still whimpering when I return to Earth.
John shrugged off Sherlock's neuroticism, and turned his attention to the plate of waffles that had just been put in front of him.
Mrs Watson placed a kiss on her daughters temple, smiled at both boys, then followed Harry’s doctor into the hall.
He’d spend the past few hours overthinking every little detail.
“No, no I haven’t.”
Sherlock lay back on the grass, hand rested underneath her abdomen as if it needed to be cradled, comforted.
We reconnect our lips, and the kiss that I enforce provides him with the answer that he needs.
Sherlock nodded, and knelt down beside the trembling woman.
“I’d argue it’s the best we’ve had today, not overall.”
“Sherlock dear, can you manage to get up on the bed?” The nurse asked.
My abdomen is pulsing, tight and tense, my inner walls all clenching, my raging hard on throbbing almost painfully between us.
It’s not like he’s never seen me at least partially naked before, but now he’s become notably cautious due to the knowledge that this action will lead to a lot more than our previous interactions.
She grabbed her things, and raced out to her bike before anyone could stop her. Lily let her in, and took her through to John who was in the kitchen.
“Oh. Who is she?”
Mrs Hudson smiled warmly at her, and waved to the blond toddler who was now dancing about Sherlock’s long legs.
“Please.”
“Mmmm, am I?” I grumble as he leads me towards the door.
“What? Oh, nothing. Don’t worry. Should we go back to the parlour?”
“Ta. Find me a boyfriend next time.” Molly murmured mirthlessly.
“Has it started to rain?” Mrs Hudson asked as she came through to help Sherlock with the door.
“Sure, no problem.”
John chortled and shook his head.
3rd of September 1913
When you go to a new restaurant, and the starter is absolutely marvellous, you cannot wait to try the other options the menu has to offer, despite only having a small amount of knowledge on the their repertoire.
“I was asking Mrs Hudson. I’m assuming she’ll be the one doing the cooking?”
Sex with an inmate is illegal.
“I love you.”
Enjoy! Sorry for the long wait 💛
“Sorry.”
“I ask you questions, and let you answer them.” He says after a moment, not asking.
Sherlock was sat on her front lawn supervising Lucy. Supervising may have been a loose term. She was reading a book while Lucy played with a doll. She flinched when she felt a droplet of rain fall on her nose. She turned her face towards the sky. A few more droplets fell. She scooped Lucy up in the blanket, and carried her indoors.
I don’t know whether she means from boredom or hunger. Both?
“I thought about what it would be like for you to fuck me on all fours... and I got so hard just imagining it...”
“Can I sit?”
John paused before leaving the room as the fact that Sherlock still had a plug inside him came to mind. John grinned to himself as he switched it on again.
“Last cup.” She said as she placed another cup down in front of Sherlock, trying to sound stern, but a smile tugged at her lips.
He cries out suddenly, arching his back so far I’m worried he’s going to snap in half.
“Is it that obvious?”
“Just thinking about... how much you’ve... changed my life. Fuck, that was corny.”
“I’m so happy you’re home.” She finally choked out.
“I love this song.”
John hesitated before taking the folded photo out of his pocket.
“Hot.”
Sherlock’s eyes were closed and her teeth were gritted as she nodded her head.
Sherlock and John talk about their drunken kiss.
My eyes drift down his torso, following the trail of hair that starts at his navel and disappears under his waistband.
What is she still doing there, the man said no.
“Bridesmaids.”
“I’ve got six fingers on this hand.”
“How old is she, Watson?” Roberts asked, his eyebrows raised.
Later in the day, I spot Sherlock in the library, curled up in a chair, head in a book.
Sherlock stayed still as John cleaned him up, then pulled his jeans back on.
“Where are you going?”
“Joh- oh fuck.” Sherlock groaned, his head lolling, lips parted in bliss. “Don’t- ah- stop!”
While on an adrenaline high, Sherlock behaves very badly. Johns only option is to punish him.
His eyes are wide, body shaking, voice horse when he calls for me.
He managed to track him down the following day during one of his breaks. He was in the music room, a violin under his chin. He was playing the most beautiful melody, fingers dancing, his eyes closed. John watched him from the hall for a moment, taking in just how beautiful he was. He stepped forwards, and entered the room.
Sherlock put his phone on loud speaker, and beckoned John over to him.
“I’ll see you tomorrow then.”
Sherlock’s heart was hammering in his chest as he followed John up the stairs.
Giving himself like that, being so vulnerable, emotional... it wasn’t something he was keen on.
“John, if you don’t want me to come over...”
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock was already dripping with sweat, some from dancing, some from anticipation. He had a feeling John would like the underwear he was sporting. It would definitely make tonight more interesting if John saw them now, but how to get him to see them? He slowly slipped his leg in between John’s, and brushed his knee up against his groin.
He connected their lips in a passionate kiss, and felt the slighter teen relax almost immediately. Sherlock was confident and cocky in every other aspect of his life, but here now, with John, he was vulnerable. It was rather endearing and somewhat of a turn on to see him like this. John used his hands to slowly roam Sherlock’s body, enjoying the way he tensed and shivered under his touch. He ran his tongue along Sherlock’s full lips, asking for entrance. Sherlock moaned softly into John’s mouth as he allowed him access. John began exploring Sherlock’s mouth with his tongue, using it to brush against Sherlock’s own tongue, and using his teeth to bite at his lips. Sherlock’s hands had found their way from John’s shoulders, to his chest, then his waist. Sherlock experimentally drew in a breath, his lips still connected to John’s. This move proved effective as John groaned softly, and moved further into sherlocks space. Sherlock felt arousal course through his body as he felt something hard poke against him.
Sherlock giggled, and snuggled closer to John.
“Don’t be. You can’t help it if you throw up-“
John’s POV
John knelt down behind Sherlock, and gripped him by the ass.
“Well. That’s never happened before.” Sherlock made his way over to the door.
They turned to look at Sherlock who was staring down at his hands in horror.
He gently bit at Sherlock’s soft skin, enjoying the smell of almonds hitting his nose. Sherlock let out a groan, and rolled his hips forwards. They both shuddered when their clothed erections brushed against each other. Sherlock sucked Johns tongue into his mouth, drawing a long, guttural moan from him.
“Bally thing!” She shouted as she forced her elbow down on it.
Maybe it was because he was familiar with the shop; maybe it’s because Irene wasn’t throwing underwear at him; or maybe it was the gentle touch of Johns hand on the small of his back.
“So ummm... I was wondering if we-“
John didn’t manage a verbal answer and instead crashed his lips back to hers, pulling her as close to him as possible by her hips.
“Darling, please tie it up.”
“Hello, Mrs Hudson.”
I take a look at the list of inmates as I walk down to the corridors. As fate would have it, Sherlock is on the list.
The broad teen arched his back, the muscles in his stomach tensing, his chest heaving.
“Fuck me...”
“What the devil are you doing?”
He’s quick to reciprocate, and pulls my prison issued cotton/poly blend shirt over my head, leaving me in my vest. Almost instantaneously, a rush of self loathing hits me like a bulletproof train as I catch his eyes falling on my track marks. He notices my trepidation, and without a word, begins trailing his lips down my arm, pressing kisses to each purple bruise.
The familiar feeling that accompanies waiting for John to come in for his night shift comes around once again.
“You umm... might want to sit on the floor so no one will see you if they walk past.”
“Alright, there’s fresh linens on both beds. I’ll be downstairs if you need anything.”
The morning after
“Don’t mock me with cruel the temptation of screaming when I must remain silent...” I groan, dragging my nails down his back, not to hurt him, but to force him to suffer the silence also.
He gasped out a moan, and threw his head forwards.
Once my eyes have fully adjusted, I realise that Moriarty is now pinned to the bookcase, and the person pinning him is John.
He bit back a moan as he witnessed john pull off his football shorts, leaving him in his red boxer shorts that did very little to hide his arousal.
“Oh, yes that sort of just happened.”
“God, yes.”
“Sherlock? Sherlock?!”
“More than ok.”
“I really have to go.”
John darted his tongue out to lick his bottom lip. Although he was still fully dressed, Sherlock already felt naked under John’s hungry gaze. He could swear John wasn’t blinking anymore as he stood there by the door.
I kneel up and press a kiss to his parted lips.
“So, you’re still living off campus?”
"Get out of Here before I call the cops." John spat, his body shaking with rage.
“Break time’s over.”
Johns voice was smooth, and voluptuous as he ran the cat down Sherlock’s legs.
“Do you reckon you can take more?” John asked tentatively, his concerns pressing at him.
John and Sherlock indulge in a little quality time together. 😏
It could have been any of these things, but  neither of them had the faintest idea.
She held out her arms, and took the small bundle. Lucy had only been born two weeks ago. Her father had never seen her. Sherlock had never imagined Mycroft as a mother, never mind herself as an aunt. But now, as she held her niece, she felt an attachment to her. She gently ran her fingers through her soft blonde hair, careful to avoid her soft spot. Her eyes opened then, crystal blue orbs, just the same as Sherlock and Mycroft. Sherlock couldn’t help but wonder what her own child would look like. And would John be the father? She felt tears creep up on her as she looked down at the baby, who had also begun crying.
“Good?”
“Ok, so how are we gonna do this?”
“Nothing.” I say quickly, adverting my gaze from the new guard, and shovelling more ‘casserole’ in to my mouth.
“Yes.”
I thought about asking him for a bit, but based on the way he reacted last time, I decided to drop it.
This sets of some sort of animalistic desire inside of me, a desire that takes over my body, all but forcing me to roll my hips against his.
“Harder...” the slender boy moaned, arching his hips up.
“Why not?” He spits suddenly, his voice a sharp hiss. “What, not good enough for me? Did you think I was in for something more clever? More sexy? Like murder?”
“I don’t like anyone.” Sherlock muttered, slumping backwards in to the arm chair opposite.
“Thank you sir.”
Mostly, she was in bliss because it was John who was touching her.
“Oh, don’t you look pretty.”
“What was that darling?”
“He was a perfect gentleman. Left me on the sofa with a bucket next to my head in case I puked.”
“Yeah babe?” He replied, eyes still trained on the video of a cat falling down some stairs.
John smiled to himself, and slowly began to move the cube along Sherlock’s collarbone.
“Not you, don’t worry. I have a lecture. I was meant to be there... three minutes ago... shit. Ok, I’ve gotta go, but come to my room later? We can see about a third kiss.” John grinned.
He gives me a sultry grin before slipping through the door, and creeping back to his cube, and out of sight.
“Don’t be such a dick. Now, come here.”
“We don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to.” John said honestly, looking at Sherlock with sincerity.
“I didn’t think Mycroft was interested in.. well... people.” John shrugged as they walked.
“Sorry.” John chuckled as he rolled over in the sheets.
Mycroft walked swiftly for the door to let him in.
He grinned, unable to take his eyes off his reflection.
"Just shut up, and look at this light."
He got distracted after a moment by Sherlock’s hands on the front of his football shorts.
His eyelids flutter open to reveal orbs almost amber in colour.
Mrs Hudson tucked a loose curl behind Sherlock’s ear.
When I arrive, there’s one other guard, and Sherlock... soaked in blood...
Yes, I’m aware that’s like the most poorly thought out crime ever.
“John-“ Mrs Watson warned, placing a hand on johns shoulder. John flinched away, and backed away to Sherlock’s side of the room.
“Oh, Sherlock’s big sister, Mycroft is 13. Perhaps they would get along.”
“It’s ok to be nervous. In fact, I’d be kinda worried if you weren’t.”
I clear my thoughts, and go back to the task at hand; processing.
He taps the side of his nose, a gesture requesting my silence on the matter, before sauntering down the corridor.
John lightly thwacked the other boy with yet another newspaper to get his attention. Sherlock lifted his curly haired head, and looked John dead in the eyes.
“Alright, alright we’re here, let’s go.”
“You obviously think you have some sort of authority round here. Let’s change that, shall we?”
“War will never leave him.” Mrs Holmes said thoughtfully after a moment. “But as long as you don’t either, he’ll be fine.”
She inhaled deeply before mumbling a ‘yes’.
He offered John his hand, and squealed somewhat indignantly as the blond pulled him to his feet. John disconnected his headphones, and turned the volume up as loud as possible. Before Sherlock could comprehend what was happening, John was spinning him round, twirling him,  effectively forcing him to dance.
“Popcorn?” I ask to snap him out of it.
“Sorry.”
I can’t show him any formal goodbye with my parents watching, so instead I simply offer him a nod.
“You owe me a new one then.”
“What do you want to do for the next few hours?” John asked seductively, pulling Sherlock to him by his hips.
He bobbed his head, and went off in search of the curly haired terror. He paused to look over the crowd of mourners.
“Well they won’t, will they? System’s fucked.”
It was hot.
Carnal lust had his nerves tingling, and every brush of john’s fingers had him reeling. John briefly broke the kiss to pull off his own shirt.
JOHN’S POV
“I am.”
“What?”
“What was it about?”
‘So don’t break,
*********
John chuckled as Mrs Holmes explained. “Him and the other one are always getting in to fights. Although they’re not normally that of the food throwing kind. Normally verbal, you see. And I must say, I’ve heard some very interesting insults.”
"It's 06:30 in the morning."
“Why are you calling me so early?” John asked through a yawn.
Sherlock all but shoved John through the door, and quickly closed it behind the pair of them before his mother could argue with him.
Sherlock moved back to his previous position, staring up at John through his dark lashes.
“Skip the fucking cocktails.” He breathed finally. “Sorry girls, I just remembered we have a thing we have to go to. Ummm... here’s some money for the bill... catch you later.”
“I’m bored. Pay attention to me.”
“Unless you think it’s too soo-“
She had worked in her family bakery, and Todd used to stop by there after school most days.
“Watson!”
“Isn’t this what sister’s are meant to do?”
“Who’s this pretty little thing?” One of the boys asked, turning his attention to Sherlock.
“Oh fuck!” I call aloud before quickly bringing my hand up to my mouth.
John chuckled, and jumped up to kiss Sherlock’s cheek.
“Hang on.”
It’s been over a month, and here he is, still thinking the world of me.
“Can’t help it...”
He picked up a giggling Sherlock, and carried him bridle style up the short flight of stairs to their bedroom, ignoring the weird sensation of Sherlock’s tongue in his ear.
“Kneel... if you can.”
“To think I could have been stuck there for another 19 hours.” Sherlock shuddered. “Either the battery would have given out, or I would have.”
I can see that even though he is clearly experiencing intense pleasure, he would stop if I needed him to.
John’s plan didn’t exactly work out as it turned out the cake was rum cake, a fact they failed to notice with their dulled taste buds.
“You’ve already thanked me.” I say with a shrug.
He placed wet kisses along Sherlock’s creamy skin, his tongue darting out to taste the sweet flavour. He moved his mouth down to Sherlock’s smooth, rosy coloured nipples, and swirled his tongue around one of them.
“Mmm!” Sherlock moaned, squeezing John’s shoulders.
Sherlock goes to secondary.
“You owe me.”
“John? What is it? What’s wrong?” She asked, eyes searching his. He wasn’t looking at her though. His eyes were wide, and looking straight ahead of him.
“Ugh, Sherl-“ John sighed in exasperation as he tried to prise Sherlock off of him.
When he sits up, his eyes are wide and blinking rapidly. I watch for a moment as he switches from looking in to my eyes then down at my lips for a few moments before I eventually cave, and lean in to kiss his full, plump lips.
“Oh!” He squealed, squeezing his eyes shut.
SHERLOCK’S POV
I look out in to the dorm, my eyes immediately falling on a crouched figure, Sherlock I presume.
Sherlock realised at that moment that she had been sobbing freely for god knows how long as her tears began to slip down her neck and down her chest.
Oh... oh damn... did not expect this of him.
“It’s called pathetic fallacy.” A voice said from behind him.
“I guess I’ll have to start giving you hickeys where no one else will ever see them.”
Mrs Holmes and Sherlock followed Mrs Watson back into the house.
“Good boy.” He purred.
“Oh...” Sherlock whimpered.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock lifted his heavy head, heart hammering away, and presented his wrists in Johns direction. The blond slowly undid the restraints, and took off the blindfold.
She heard Mrs Hudson sigh, followed by retreating footsteps.
Mike hasn’t moved. He’s lying on his bed, listening to his radio.
“I’ll go get us some coffee, ok?”
“You taste like cum.” John chortled, grimacing at the statement.
When she returned, Mycroft was sat on the floor of the parlour with an asleep Lucy curled up in her lap.
I bolt up right as I sink my claws in to johns scalp.
John looked straight at her then, unconvinced. Anyone could see the fear in his eyes, and it just broke her.
“Sorry, should have warned you.”
“Yeah...”
“No, no you have it.”
“And you figured you may as well put the time to use, and had sex in a cupboard.”
Fuck, when this is over, work will be a brief moment, interlude even, where I have to be away from him.
Me: Anyway, I’ll see you later. Love yooouuuu, babe.
‘I’d fuck myself.’ He thought as he spun around.
The curly haired teen ran up the stairs upon hearing his name, and tumbled into Harry’s room.
John pays Sherlock a visit and things heat up.
I pull back after a moment, my heart racing and my head spinning.
“Yes.” John replied, his voice higher, and quieter than normal.
“What do you say?”
He looks at me with his deep, stormy eyes in a way that makes my insides quiver.
“Oh fuck... we have to...” Sherlock gestured blindly to the door behind him, steering John to the wall by his shoulders. “Jump up.” The blond panted, staring at Sherlock with intense desire.
“John.” She silenced him. “I’d love to.”
He felt his whole body light up upon hearing her voice.
“Mmmm... I dunno. Maybe I’m just full of adrenaline.” John chuckled.
I’m panicking.
Needless to say, I am going through my socks at a rate of knots.
“Yes, I suppose I am. I’ll actually be allowed to do experiments without being told it’s ‘unsafe, and bloody well stupid’” She said in quotation marks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you know what happens to naughty little boys?”
“Thank you. Chocolate bourbons?” He asked, taking one of the biscuits in hand.
Because of the fucked up system, I doubt anybody will question me if I say he needs to be taught a lesson.
“Yes... yes- ah!” Sherlock groaned as John began to scissor him open.
“What’s happened?”
“They should be here any minute.”
“A popular opinion nowadays, so I hear.”
“I’m sorry?”
“Well, that can’t happen. You need to come home. You need to come home to me.”
There was some sort of euphoric tones accompanying the expression of pain as his eyes screwed shut.
God, I’m glad he’s close because I know I am.
“No fair. You’re hotter than me as a boy and a girl.” Molly chuckled, reaching out to stroke Sherlock’s arm.
“I just need to get something from the kitchen. I want you to start stretching yourself, but don’t you dare cum.”
“Your parents aren’t coming home any time soon, are they?” John mumbled as they stumbled up the stairs.
Said boy let out a squeal when he felt one of John’s fingers probing his entrance.
“Fucking hell...”
“That doesn’t mean there aren’t consequences.”
and sweat nauseating. Dead soldiers littered the floor, limp, like rag dolls left out in the cold, their blood staining the crisp snow beneath Johns shoes. He pulled his jacket tighter, hugging it to his shivering form. He forced his legs to keep moving, keep walking, closer to the army base. He knew he couldn’t sit down, he knew he wouldn’t get up again. So on he went, trudging through the bloody snow, stepping over the bodies of his fallen comrades. There were Germans too. These were the men he’d played football with on that first Christmas when they’d stopped fighting for one day. Like small children, fighting over a toy. Except they weren’t children, they were men, and they were fighting for their country. He paused when his eyes fell on a familiar mop of brown hair. Thompson. His bright green eyes were still open, still glistening. John felt his heart rench as he looked down at the boy. He looked even younger in death. Despite his better judgment, John got down on his knees.
“You mean to say he doesn’t normally?” John grinned, lightly nudging the boy in question. Mrs Holmes smiled broadly as she looked between both boys.
Mrs Holmes smiled.
Sherlock got so turned on when John talked to him like this. He held back a moan, his toes curling.
I know there is risk in waking him up, but I can’t bare to see him struggling.
“Baby? Are you alright?” I ask, more panic cutting through my voice than I’d like to.
She looked up at him in earnest, eyes brimming with tears. She placed her hand on the one that was cupping her cheek, and kissed it.
“Well of course you can. It’s my pleasure.”
“Yeah, I still had some whipped cream in my hair.” John chortled as he walked over to Sherlock.
“I’m sorry I ran off the other night.”
“Excellent. Mycroft’s buying.”
He looks down his nose at me, his eyebrows quirking in a devilish manner.
As the minutes go by, he moves closer to me, and we become intertwined in more ways.
She guessed this would be the answer, but she’d had a little hope.
Sanctify my body with pain,’
His beautiful Sherlock, who had his head propped up on pillows, his dark hair splayed about around him like an ebony halo.
No mercy.
This evidently spurs him on, as he reaches between us, and begins furiously pumping my cock.
“No, I’m fine.”
Sherlock turns to Mycroft for help.
“Do you approve?”
“Do you know why you don’t like it?”
He had grown up so much since the first time she saw him. He now had a sharp jawline, traces of stubble there from where he’d started shaving, and he’d grown about a foot in the last two years alone. Despite the changes, he was still John, and rather handsome at that. She was lucky John hadn’t noticed she was staring either.
“I can read the lies in your voice, your lack of a nutritious diet in your complexion, and your sexual endeavours in your walk... right down to the very position... can’t say I’m surprised.” He mutters the last bit in to his styrofoam cup, a faint smile tugging at his lips.
SHERLOCK’S POV
“I’m so hard for you.”
He didn’t have the energy for anything more... exotic... at this time of the morning, and neither did John, saving their more rambunctious activities for later in the day.
John’s hands on the back of my head, but I don’t pull away.
“How was that?”
There was a lot of medical talk, but Sherlock tuned out most of it.
Sherlock’s head snapped forward, his lips parting in a silent scream as he ejaculated all over his stomach. His arms went limp in the restraints as he came down from his high. After a few more thrusts, John balled the sheets into his fists, squeezed his eyes shut, and came with a cry of Sherlock’s name. His arms gave way, and he fell on to Sherlock’s chest. Once Sherlock returned to reality, he leant forwards to rest his chin on johns head. They were both breathing heavily, hearts pounding, chests heaving. Sherlock whimpered when John eventually softened, and pulled out. He reached over to the beside table, and picked up the previously disregarded handcuff key.
“You can open your eyes.”
I can feel him quake against me at my words.
“I just wanted to say I love your crop top. It’s really cute.”
I start to increase my speed, banging my hip bones in to his, making sure to leave bruises.
“Oh he’s definitely having a gay affair.”
“Just wondering.”
Sherlock’s POV
“Oh...” Sherlock moaned both in pleasure and realisation as he watched John begin to circle his hole.
“So, where was it? Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, or Chilli?” Sherlock asked, his attention going to the boy’s eyes.
“What?”
I don’t think he has any idea about the affect he has on me, and how arduous a task it is to avoid ejaculating in my briefs again.
She kept her mouth shut.
“Oh...” Sherlock moaned in appreciation.
“Sorry... not feeling well...”
“How though?” John asked finally.
“Classical. I play the violin.”
Just the notion of food had the brunette running for the bathroom and throwing up the contents of her stomach.
Ooo, alone in a flat? I wonder what might happen...
I’m a little busy.”
Sherlock felt truly safe, and loved. He trusted John, he trusted he wouldn’t hurt him, and he trusted himself not to screw this up.
I’ve never seen him sleeping before.
“Even if you do look like a hedgehog.” Sherlock mumbled round the bottle.
“I’ll miss you, but don’t you dare come back here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The sooner he gets out the better.
John nodded in dismissal. Once Thompson left, John opened the parcel.
Mycroft sat down at the edge of Sherlock’s bed, her eyes roaming over her little sister.
“That’s Alright darling. I know you must be missing him just as much as we are.”
“Sherlock, you have to feed him.”
“Why not?”
Sherlock chewed the inside of her cheek. She didn’t want that either.
“Oh, and my mum knew by the way. Or so she says.”
Harriet was leant against her door frame wrapped in a dressing gown, clearly having just awoken up herself. John looked down and saw that he was indeed shirtless. It was a fact Sherlock would probably appreciate, but maybe not the rest of the town.
“Sock index... honestly boy.”
“And yet this door will still hit you in the face.”
“Well,” Mycroft began. “Looking forward to the Easter parade?”
“Shh...” John reiterated round his mouthful, clearly trying not to giggle.
“Now... I don’t think you should take that tone with me, do you?”
Sherlock paused in the doorway when she first saw him. His hair was over grown, so much so that it dangled over his eyes. It was darker than before, long gone were the golden curls that used to make him look like a cherub angel. He didn’t look like that anymore. He was a man now. He’d showered and changed in to pyjamas, but he hadn’t shaved. He had stubble along his jaw as he occasionally did, but it looked straggly, instead of rugged. John looked up upon noticing her. His eyes were dark, and sunken. Haunted.
Sherlock would always consider John groaning like that as the hottest sound he’d ever heard. The broad teen settled in to a rhythm, careful not to go too fast as Sherlock adjusted to his size.
I’m vaguely aware being shouted in my direction.
John pulled him closer, and rested his cheek amongst Sherlock’s dark curls.
“On it.”
“I’ll take that as a no.”
When he felt himself reaching completion, he gripped Sherlock’s hair tightly.
“Yes.”
“Leave me alone.”
He seems all but gleeful when I call him over.
‘Monday, you can fall apart,
“Oh, the adrenaline rush is a wondrous being, isn’t she?” Sherlock grinned, spinning around the living room.
I feel a weird sort of rush go through my body under his intense stare.
While John was a little chagrined at the notion of telling anyone about the intimate details of last night, but he was also rather elated at the bonding moment that was occurring between the two of them, something that had become increasingly rare throughout the years.
Sherlock nodded, a smile playing on his lips. John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s, and began to move it up and down.
12 and a half hellish months. For good behaviour and wrongful punishment, you get 2 weeks lobbed off your sentence.
Sherlock sighed happily.
“Mmm- ah- mmm!” Sherlock groaned as John filled him up.
I utter the next few words as a breathy whisper.
“Is he causing you much trouble these days?”
John age: 20
The flat is an absolute tip, and the whimsical eyes on the Hoover only improved things a little.
“John?”
The blonde child scrabbled on to the chair, her eyes wide and full of excitement.
She lay out the duvet and pillow, then sat down beside him, and lay the garment from her bag over him. It had started off as a scarf, but from all the panic knitting, had developed into a blanket.
“My blouse... take it off.” She panted.
Sherlock’s eyes were squeezed shut as John continued to dry hump him.
“I’m in the guard bubble tonight. Maybe I’ll see you there?”
“No, no. I’m fine. They’ve stopped.”
It was at a house party in one of the guest bedrooms; Classy, I know.
“Harder!”
I go to nod my head, but find my neck rigid in place, my body clearly acting on an impulse my incredibly swift brain is yet to run through my thought processes. Sometimes I have difficulty keeping up with it.
“What in gods name are you two doing?”
What Sherlock and John get up to once the former leaves the prison.
The idea was more than interesting.
“Just say stop if you need me to.”
‘In the night you come to me,
I can’t help my noise as John pushes himself inside my soft, supple body, which is oh too happy to accommodate his, wrapping him in warmth and velvet.
John takes the kit, then leads me through to one of the rooms.
“How thoughtful of you.”
Sorry this is late, and kinda rushed. Word of advise, don’t start three stories at the same time 😆.
I clock out, then head back down the corridor. Thankfully, it doesn’t seem like anyone has been down here.
“Yeah... do it again?”
“Don’t ask.” He shot before John could even register what he was seeing.
“Yes, yes I do.” Sherlock said quickly.
“I guess everything will be like that when we get out. Going to bed whenever, eating at six o’clock, wearing what we want...” mike sighs.
The girl frowned at her mother, but obeyed none the less before stomping off indoors.
I wait in bed, still wearing my shoes so that I can sneak away as soon as I’m sure everyone is asleep.
“Quite alright. A little spaced though.”
She smiled at him, a genuine smile that even she was surprised was tugging at her lips.
John placed his hand on the small of her back, and steered her over towards the shop she was so eager to get to.
Enjoy!
“Oh, you wear one of those now?”
Sherlock keened into johns touch, his hands moving up to tug at johns hair.
“Hello, I’m Anne Holmes, I live next door. I thought I’d come by to welcome the Watsons to the neighbourhood.”
“What? Do you like that?”
“God, I love you so much.”
"Prove it."
Sherlock released a shaky breath, and did as he was told.
“Are you Alright?”
“God, yes.” I pant before I have a chance to renege.
It’s such an awkward time between meals.
“Ah, Sherlock has a play date. That’s never happened.”
“God I love you so much.”
“Honestly, labels don’t mean shit. I just want you. It doesn’t matter whether you’re either gender, neither, inbetween, or undecided. I like you. Sherlock Holmes.”
“Ah.”
“Ugh. Babe, take the flavour out of my mouth.” He chuckled, pulling an also gagging Sherlock to him by his shirt.
“How are you?”
“Mmmm!” Sherlock moaned loudly as he began probing at his entrance.
John smiled.
Sherlock brought his hands down to the knot that was keeping his towel seated on his hips. He slowly undid it, and let the damp, white garment drop to the floor. John raised his eyebrows at the sight before him. Sherlock’s cock was completely bare, not a dark curl in sight.
“It would be an understatement to say he has never been full of brotherly love, but I was still rather surprised to find out it was he who had caused my arrest to come about.” I say matter of factually, perhaps in a vain attempt to convince John that, although having many an argument that may or may not have involved rather spectacular insults in Latin, this was extreme even for Mycroft.
Drip. Drip. Drip. Rain stormed down outside, teaming and torrenting. Sherlock had stopped crying days ago. She’d run out of tears. That first night, she stayed slumped against her door all night, eventually drifting off into a fitful sleep. She left her room on occasion to eat and drink, but she didn’t say a word to anyone. The whole world was passing by, people talking, going to work, just going about their lives, and it didn’t mean a thing to her. The only thing that mattered was John. She remembered the last letter she sent to him.
We actually end up having a nice time, even though part of my brain is concocting a plan.
As I go through inspection, I can only be grateful that if the guard notices how red and sore my rim is, he doesn’t say anything.
I am definitely loving this new side to him.
“He looks like a little prune!” She babbled excitedly, gently poking his nose with a pudgy finger.
Mrs Watson just stood, and watched. She couldn’t comfort him like Sherlock could. This alone amazes her. She’d known her since she was very small, and was very accustomed to Sherlock’s blunt, seemingly emotionless manner, but yet she was there, by John’s side, mumbling words of reassurance to him. After a nod from Sherlock, Mrs Watson crept out of the room, and left them to it.
Sherlock beamed up at him before reaching for his zipper. John groaned when Sherlock’s long fingers brushed against his raging hard on. John lifted his hips in order for Sherlock to slide his jeans and boxers down his muscular legs, then threw the garments across the room. Sherlock licked his lips when John’s thick cock sprung free, beads of pre-cum leaking from the head, and dripping down his length. Sherlock made sure John was watching as he bent forwards to give it an experimental lick.
January 3rd 1918
“I’m good.” He said calmly. He wouldn’t tell her how much he was suffering. She didn’t need to hear about the sleepless nights, the heartache, the homesick.
“Now...”
“Yes, yes I’m fine. Just clicked my ankle.” I explain, rolling my ankle to the side.
“Oh fu- Agh! Mmmmmnnnnggghh!” Sherlock howled low in his throat as he arched his back, pressing his ass into John’s pelvis.
John held back a chuckle at this, impressed with how much patience Mrs Holmes had for her, at times, infuriating son.
Sherlock age: 13
Sherlock swallowed audibly when John cuffed each of his wrists with a set of restraints.
He didn’t need to be told twice. He walked briskly out in to the courtyard. He then remembered then that John had football. He quickened his pace, and hurried over to the football grounds. He spotted John doing ‘keepy-upies’ across the field.
Sherlock wriggled back in to his trousers, then fell back in a heap of giggles as John pushed him back on the bed. He ignored the unfamiliar taste on his lips as John reconnected their lips, and responded none the less. John trapped Sherlock underneath him, his knees either side of his narrow hips. Sherlock ran his hands down johns chest, and undid the zipper on johns jeans. The blond sighed happily as he felt Sherlock slip his hands down the front of his boxers.
“He’s not. I guess he just found someone who also has no interest in emotional attachment. ‘Purely physical’” Sherlock said in quotations.
“There are so few opportunities in which that sentence is valid.” Mycroft mused as she took her empty tea cup out to the kitchen.
“Oh fucking hell- yes! Yes! Yes!”
John dug his nails in to Sherlock’s sides, making him whine loudly. He picked up his pace, pounding his cock in to sherlocks soft body as hard as he could.
“If you need me to stop at any point-“
“I don’t actually want them to catch us, I just like the thrill that they might. That we might get caught...” Sherlock purred the last bit in to John’s ear as he reached down between them to tug at the blond’s cock.
“When she falls apart, she destroys everyone in her wake, and she doesn’t even care!”
Dirt.
“Is molly available?”
I dig my nails in to my knees as I sit still, a coping mechanism I have adopted in an arduous attempt at controlling the animalistic impulses to jump out from under the table and punch her in the face.
John looked surprised at the attitude from the long legged girl.
JOHN’S POV
“What’s this about?” He asks quietly once we’re in the hall.
“Not really.” Replied Sherlock, who was eyeing up the pie.
Sherlock looked at John with a smirk, tilting his head to press wet kisses down his strong jawline.
The brunette jumped up from the bed, but remained leaning up against it.
John started to grind their hips together, his erection rubbing in between Sherlock’s thighs.
John quirks his eyebrows and grins one of those smiles that makes my insides go all liquified.
(See the end of the chapter for
MEANWHILE
“God, you’re so beautiful.” John repeats, his voice breathless and husky, and fuck, it goes straight to my cock.
He doesn’t move for a moment, he doesn’t say anything either.
Sherlock allowed her eyes to wander him fully for the first time. It was then that she noticed the bandages on his shoulder and his leg.
“Fine. Thank you. I’d ask what I missed but... what’s the point.”
“I’ve seen you with Sherlock a fair bit. Are you just as surprised or am I complete idiot for missing something?”
If inconvenient, come anyway.
“Really?” John cooed, moving his hand up to run it through Sherlock’s curls.
“That is something.” Sherlock chuckled as he picked up the package.
“Alright, a boy has just died. Stop smiling.”
“Ohhh...” he groans as I push my tip past his ring of pulsing muscle.
“Weak in the knees?”
Mrs Holmes chuckled at her daughter’s confidence, and gently squeezed her hand. They existed their grounds, and walked down the avenue to the house next door, Sherlock occasionally running ahead before being called back. They finally reached the door, and a house keeper came to greet them.
“John...” He moaned, sinking his nails into the blond’s skin.
“Yeah, that’s fine.”
“What?”
John hesitated for a moment before finally caving, and going into the hall to fetch his own shoes.
“You know I have to prepare you first?”
“Sherlock, it would help if you said something right about now.”
“What is it?”
Sherlock didn’t say anything. He just looked at John with a blank expression.
“Joooohn...” Sherlock moaned, throwing his head back.
and afraid,’
Once I’m dressed, I sit back and watch as john finishes buttoning up his shirt.
I explain the situation to him.
She hadn’t even got dressed, and was still only clad in a night dress. She went to run up the stairs, but the blond occupants of next door were all standing in the hall, John included.
“Nothing babe.” Sherlock said calmly as he sipped his tea. “Well, obviously I’ve done things, but the matter on which I assume you are asking about; no, I haven’t done anything.”
“Fuck, you’re so gorgeous.” He groans as he stares down at my hole, his eyes glazed over in what I think might just be awe.
The bathrooms were empty as they tumbled through the door, lips on lips, hands tugging at clothing, nails raking skin.
“You told him about me then?”
Sherlock grinned coyly, and licked his lips.
Sherlock went to find Mycroft. She was sat in the parlour, a book in her lap.
“Wow. Honestly, I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that Mycroft has a kid.”
“Oh fuck.” John grumbled suddenly.
Thursday doesn’t even start,
She paused after a moment, and brought her hands up to his shoulders. She broke away from the kiss to bring her lips down to his neck, sucking sharply on the skin.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, his blue orbs wide as saucers, and a grin playing on his lips.
“Shhh. Too much noise. I’ll forgive you jackasses if no one makes a sound for the next few hours.”
“Do you like it?”
I have got to be the only person alive to compare sex to a cubic- oh fuuuuuucccckkk...
Shit, I have to find him.
“I’m fine- it’s just a bit... uncomfortable.”
Sherlock age: 16
He keeps our lips connected as he slips his hand past my cotton/poly blend trousers, and in to the confines of my briefs.
Ok then...
I lost my virginity to my second girlfriend when I was 17.
“I’ll walk you over. I don’t have to be anywhere till four.”
“There’s soya yoghurt that molly bought, but I doubt that’s what you mean.”
I look past Moriarty’s shoulder, and see Mr Lestrade standing in the corridor. He’s the man in charge around here, something I’m grateful for as he’s actually a nice man.
It’s not actually got any force behind it, although I suspect that a real assault from Sherlock would have much the same results.
Sherlock waved to the blonde boy as she wriggled through the gap in the fence that divided their houses. She wondered whether John really would come over at the weekend. She made sure they had chocolate bourbons. They were johns favourite.
Mary... Rosamund Mary?
“I was hoping you’d say that. Lie down then.”
“He’s so cute.” Was all he said as tears sprung to his eyes.
God, I need him.
“I’m gonna... oh sherlock... you’re going to make me- ah- cum- oh!” John groaned, followed by a mumbled string of profanities when he saw that Sherlock didn’t remove his mouth, and instead, carried on bobbing his head. He then experimentally swallowed around johns cock. It was clearly the right thing to do, as john’s whole body spasmed suddenly, and a low, strangled moan of Sherlock’s name escaped him as he came in to the brunettes mouth. Sherlock gagged as the hot, salty fluid rushed down his throat. He pulled away, then looked up at John, and swallowed. This boy was going to be death of him.
Sherlock let out a small gasp of surprise, but that quickly turned in to a moan of appreciation.
“Come on then.”
Sherlock lay down next to John, curling up against his side, and nuzzling in to his neck.
I have changed the format, so there is an additional update from Johns POV in the last chapter. The inspiration for this chapter came from when Sherlock gets his words jumbled up when talking to Irene in ASIB
Molly glared at Irene.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“What the fuck do you want?” He grumbled.
“Sherlock! Are you alright?” John asked, hurrying over to the young girl.
“Sure, champ.”
“Bunsen burner got a bit out of hand. There’s no space in here.”
“Sherlock is loaning you to people.” John grinned at Irene, who turned to glare at Sherlock.
“Does it turn you on knowing everyone is watching you? Knowing they can see you like this?”
“Sorry.”
“He has that affect on people.” Sherlock chuckled.
“This one.” Sherlock said, having successfully opened the wardrobe, and was tugging at a lemon yellow dress.
John notices my disposition, and holds his arms out to me.
“I’ll see to this one first.”
Sherlock closed her eyes, unable to look in to John’s any longer, unable to see the horrors playing out behind them.
He let go of his leaking shaft, and grab each of his legs.
Unfortunately, Sherlock had walked away after he heard John apologising for his behaviour, and missed Rosie’s response. He spent most of his morning staring at the table wondering why his heart hurt. At lunch, John was sat with the blonde girl, Rosa, Romeo, Robbert, or something like that. Sherlock marched over to the table, and sat down next to john. John didn’t seem to notice, and carried on avidly conversing with the girl. The curly haired boy not so subtly cleared his throat to get the other teen’s attention.
Wait, what did he say?
Sherlock age: 13
“Please, John?” Sherlock begged, staring deeply in to the blond’s darkened eyes.
“Might need to take your trousers off then.”
His movements got more violent as John circled closer to the hardened bud. The cube had almost completely melted, so John replaced it with a new, colder one.
“She’s asleep.” She chuckled.
After about ten minutes, the front door opened. John visibly tensed, his body clearly experiencing the fight or flight response. Sherlock assumed it was his mother, and his sister, judging by the second set of footsteps.
John looked down at the sheets, which were stained with sweat, and white creamy fluid.
“Maybe he didn’t.”
“Alright.”
“I want you to ruin me.”
“Sure. What’s wrong?”
An inmate, who is stood by the coffee table, a cheeky grin on his face as he scans the crowd.
“Hey pretty boy.”
“Can I try something?”
‘Fuck, now I actually have to make tea.’
I return her smile.
I remember then where I am, and quickly shove them in to my pocket.
“I don’t want to panic you... but ummm... you’re bleeding a little bit.”
“John, coffee?” Sherlock asked rather hopefully.
He was tight, warm and tight.
“Saved by the bell.”
4th of August 1914
“John...”
Still didn’t care.
“John...”
"I see your deduction skills are back."
John couldn’t help but think that this might be the lowest of the low as he sunk down the door and took his aching length from within the confines of his trousers. He only had the few beads of pre-cum that had dribbled from his tip to lubricate as he began to stroke his shaft.
We don’t say anything.
The brunette did stir, much to John’s delight, and batted his eyelids profusely as he adjusted to the light.
“Alright, last goodbyes, then on the train with the lot of you.”
“Mum, I’m off out.”
“You want to?”
“What are you going to do at university?”
John assumed that from the distant look on her face, Sherlock was unaware that she was being photographed.
“Oh come off it, Wilson. There is no way that’s your girlfriend.”
He was so full, his body completely stretched out to accommodate john’s length. He felt as though John was going to split him right up he middle, and not in a good way.
John couldn’t help his heart surge at the thought of Sherlock waiting for him. Said boy was sat on the arm chair in the corner of the room by the window, a book in hand. He turned his head to look at John, then quickly over to his mother, narrowing his eyes at her.
All my love, John xxx
Kept it a bit more clean than my other smuts just because of the era.
“I’m going to get dressed.” Sherlock said, then left before John could stop him. He sat in front of his mirror, staring at his uniform clad figure. He was tall, pale, and lanky with dark hair. John on the other hand was tanned, muscular, with beach blond hair. Their differences extended from those of the physical type, and on to their personalities. Sherlock couldn’t see those looking in the mirror, but he knew they were there. He knew people were confused by their friendship, and for the first time he actually cared what other people thought of him. He cared what people would say to John about him.
“Uh! Uhh! Oh gawd!”
He rolls his eyes, unconvinced, then pulls me to him again, and kisses me on the nose.
Fuck.
He was right, handcuffs were a brilliant idea.
“Fuck... well we can’t just let her get away with this.
Sherlock and John take the next step.
He was so gorgeous.
I bite back a strangled moan.
“Really? What about?”
“Why, Yes Mr Watson.”
He moved in with me three weeks ago. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. He threw up the first night when we had takeaway, the rich food too much for him after that crap the prison passes off as food. He spent two hours in the shower, I don’t know whether he was crying in there or not. He fell asleep at 10, when lights out would have been, and when we tried to have sex he freaked out at every little noise and pulled away.
“Alright. Come on then, Sherlock.”
He grabbed the nearest item that resembled a t-shirt that turned out to be his football hoodie.
“Well, this is most unacceptable.”
John was out of breath when he finished. He’d never confessed his love for Sherlock not out loud, not even to Sherlock himself. His mother was quiet, but maybe that’s because he hadn’t given her a chance to respond. Maybe it was because she was angry, ashamed, disappointed-
“Three years done, two left.”
“Mmm...” John hummed happily, his eyes closing.
He screwed the bed sheets in to his fists as he shot his load deep inside of Sherlock’s tight passage.
“Will the socks stay up?” John asked, bringing his hands down to cup Sherlock’s ass.
“I fancy you. I find you attractive. You
“Here.” He said, handing a bunch to Sherlock.
John’s breath was warm and minty as he spoke by Sherlock’s ear.
John returns the favour.
I state to Adler that I’m going to check on the toiletry supplies, and allow myself to follow Sherlock.
“John, stop worrying. I promise, I’m fine.” She said softly, stroking his cheek.
“No, no, laughing bad.” John murmured, pressing his hands to his temples.
Sherlock wrapped a sheet around himself before getting to his feet, and trailing after John to the front door.
I suppose my adoration of him must be showing on my face as the grin he’s supporting suggests.
I’m sure he knows I’m staring at him, but he doesn’t meet my gaze.
“No, you’re right. It’s not. But it is what it is.”
Mycroft paled, all the colour in her face draining.
“Alright, I’ll be back at eight. Don’t wait up.” He grinned, then bent down to kiss the other boy on the forehead.
He blushes and shakes his curls.
It was that moment that Mrs Holmes caught Sherlock watching John with a sort of love sick expression. She had suspicions about the pairs’ blossoming friendship, but had nothing to confirm these queries other than their extreme fondness for one another. As she left the room, she could only pray that John would return Sherlock’s affections. The inconsolable mess he would turn into otherwise didn’t bare thinking about.
“Happy new year!”
She walks over to sit in front of me, concern on her face.
When I pray,
John relaxed his grip on her wrists, and his  body slumped back.
“No, no.” I say hastily. “Just give me a minute.”
“I can’t believe how much you’ve grown. Such a beautiful girl you’ve become. Now run along, your mother will be looking for you.”
This chapter is a smutty one, but if you don’t want to read it, it’s not so key that if you skip it, the next chapter won’t make sense; It’s really more of a bonus chapter. Hope you enjoy it.
“No, no, no, no... stay just like this.” John cooed softly, slowly beginning to rut his hips against Sherlock’s ass.
Henry doesn’t have either of his parents, but I have observed him attending visiting hours with a variety of friends.
This took a long time, didn’t it? No, you don’t get your happily ever after just get. Mu ha ha ha.
“Hello?”
So many nights I’ve had to use my disappointment of a hand with a squirt of lotion, comparing it to Sherlock’s warm depths.
“What if...” John husked, slipping his other hand down the back of Sherlock’s pyjamas. “They saw you coming in your pants like the dirty teenager you are?”
It’s the middle of the day, I’m working in the garden, talking to people, and it’s in there.
“In exchange for what?”
Another guard comes along to grab hold of Moriarty whilst I take Sherlock aside.
“We still don’t have lube though.” John chuckled mirthlessly.
I chuckle, and press a kiss to his temple.
Both boys grumbled their responses. She let them wake themselves up a bit more before asking any questions.
“Wait!” He gasped. “If I am the things I look like, that makes me an otter!” He yelped as John lay him down on the bed.
“Mmm! Oh fu- oh god.”
“Yes, but mines wet.”
“Mmmmhmmm...”
John could feel himself weeping heavily from the inside of his boxers, uncomfortably hard.
“Make love to me.”
“I’m playing a guessing game.” He grins before turning his attention back to the television.
“That was so hot.” Sherlock sighed, dropping his head back.
5. Smart ass
“John I-ah!” Sherlock gasped, squeezing Johns shoulders violently.
“I know.” John says softly, placing his hand under my chin and making me look up at him.
“Do you like it?” Rosie asked.
“No.”
“Yes I’m fine. I just wanted to see you.” I shrug, suddenly feeling sheepish under his intense stare, the mind of stare that makes my knees go weak, and my insides turn to jelly.
Sherlock furrowed her brows. She knew better than to turn around again as it would be blatantly obvious. Sherlock was no stranger to unwanted attention, and saw this situation as no different to the others.
“You like me?”
“Didn’t I say? Yeah, he’s there, and he wants to kill me.”
He sighs, and bites the inside of his cheek.
“Are you sure you want me to?” I ask him, softly caressing his cheek.
“I see. Anyways I feel like I need to scrub my brain out with bleach.” John chuckled.
“You clean yourself up?”
“I love you.”
Sherlock nodded sincerely.
“How do you want it? How do you want my cock, baby?” He rumbles as he grinds against me.
I’m too far way from John for it to work to it’s full extent, but it still feels good. Really good.
We stay still for a little while, resting against each other, Sherlock sat on the shelf that runs all around the perimeter, legs still wrapped around me.
John connected their lips in a hot and heavy kiss before thrusting in to him again.
26th of December 1917
“Stroking your hard, dripping cock until you’re ready to burst...”
He says it so quietly, so gently, but it’s earnest and honest as the words fall from his lips.
“Yeah. I’d like that. Thanks.”
“Like other people. I know, dear.”
John age:19
Mrs Holmes was used to these sorts of fights with the troublesome teen, starting with why she had to heat the crusts of her bread when she was three years old.
Said boy let out a loud cry at the feeling of being filled before reaching his own end, and ejaculating all over his stomach.
“I’ll have to go in my kit. Damnit.” Sherlock grumbled as he turned to grab the door handle.
“That means another CO will be coming to take my post. They can’t find you here.”
John doesn’t look like he’s sure I said it at all though.
John stayed silent for a moment. Sherlock wondered whether he’d just screwed up his chances of having a somewhat decent lab partner.
“Thank you so much.”
John found Sherlock’s lips, and pressed a hungry kiss to them, making slick, wet noises.
“Do you want to do this yourself, or do you want me to do it?”
“Yeah, Alright.” John sighed, still not looking up from his book.
“According to the show, acquiring baby mamas and ASBOs is a hobby. Should I do that?”
“Hello, darling. Would you like to come across with me to meet the neighbours?”
I manage to locate him in his cube after work duty.
Sherlock waved her off as she left down the lane, then went back in to John. He was staring down at the table, his eyes glazed over. His breathing was ragged, and harsh.
“Definitely.”
John raised his head from his bunk, and took the parcel extended to him.
“Shit. That’s hot.” John rumbled as he slowly pulled them down so they were bunched around his knees along with the attached garters. Sherlock grinned to himself at Johns reaction. He watched as the blond reached over for lube and a condom.
Sherlock made some noise of bemusement before opening his eyes again.
John shivered and let out a guttural moan.
"Same way I knew everything about you after having just met you." He mumbled, still seething.
“Oh, darling, you look stunning.”
“Yeah, they just want to ask what I know of the two of them. Honestly, I don’t believe Holmes did do it, and if he did, I bet he had good reason. In fact, if I had been on duty, I would just say he didn’t do it.”
John age: 20
The blond in question nodded quickly.
John was used to a certain level of observation from Sherlock, but it was weird coming from his sister who once failed to notice a fire in their microwave, a result of leaving a spoon in a bowl of pasta. There must be something very blatant that was giving him away.
Mr Watson went completely silent. John knew that this was the quiet before the storm, and that this was his cue to leave. He darted for the door, grabbed his rucksack, and ran out of the house. He wanted nothing more than to run and see Sherlock, but he didn’t think that was the best idea exactly. Instead, he hopped on a bus in to town to meet his mother at work.
Sherlock blushed, and shook his head.
A raw, primal, animalistic cry sounds from my lungs as my orgasm rips through my body, and ropes of white spurt to stain my chest.
“Yes actually- oh...” I chuckle as I realise what he’s implying.
“Come here.”
I’m a little hot under the collar, truth be told, and his bright blue orbs watching me under hooded eyes are not helping.
“You know, I’ve run out of angry. I’m just ‘nothing’ at it now. I just-“
Donovan and Anderson made their first good decision all day. They ran away. John ran back to Sherlock's limp form, and dropped to his knees. He checked for his pulse, then to see if he was breathing. He carefully pulled Sherlock's head into his lap.
I go back to kissing him, my accuracy a little hindered on account of how addled my brain is by arousal.
“Yeah, of course.”
Fuck.
“Ooo, am I going to get spanked?”
John furrowed his brows.
“Fuck.” He hisses before quickly buttoning his trousers back up. “Oh shit, it’s Rosie. Come in.” He beckons to her, turning himself in the chair so that hopefully, I’m blocked from her view.
John helped him sit up, then shuffled round in front of him.
Sherlock and John deliberate about the “next step”.
“5 minutes children.”
“You’re also cocky.”
Without making a scene, I make my way across the grounds to the greenhouse, and push my way through the doors.
John’s eyes went wide as the brunette slid off his lap, and slipped back out of the living room, swaying his hips as he went.
Maybe he wouldn’t want her when he did.
He knew that I had got my medical degree, then gone in to the army, only to be injured.
“I... I... I can’t...”
“I could help.”
“Everything ok? You feel alright?”
A wave of emotion hit Sherlock full in the chest.
Sherlock visits John, and meets his family.
“You can’t hear yourself think!”
Sherlock.
Her mother sighed loudly, and left the room defeated. A moment later, there was a knock at her door.
Oh my god, I’ve got seven fingers on this hand...
Sherlock tried not to let this fact distract him as he fumbled on his bed stand for his alarm clock.
I’m sorry my writing is so infrequent, but I promise I won’t abandon this story completely.
He bats his eyelashes at me, blue orbs dark, pupils blown wide.
“He’s trying to keep the weight off. Puberty, natural fat burner. Went from being a hippo to a beanpole over night.”
Sherlock was curled around John, leg slung over the blond’s hip.
I blush furiously and shake my head at him in a failed attempt at denial.
I let out a quiet sigh as he cups my face, and presses our lips together.
Sherlock smirked over her teacup at her niece when the small child’s face reappeared, a piece of pink tissue paper balanced atop her head.
I wish she’d just bugger off already.
He spread Sherlock’s legs, and pulled him to his lap so he was straddling his thighs. They both let out a series of moans when their erections brushed against each other.
“Tell her I love her.” He settled on as he tried not to let his voice quiver.
“I still have the swords.” John said, eyes still on the television. “We can have a sword fight if you want.”
She cardio the room, and saw John stood in her garden.
I didn’t manage to silence him when he came, a loud groan ripping through his body, startling us both as he finished all over my clothed thigh.
John furrowed his brows as he turned to look about him.
“Oh... oh!”
He’s warm and pulsing, god he feels so good.
“Elevated, But we’ll put that down to stress.”
The next day, he’d learnt how to crotchet, the following day he put google eyes on all the appliances, minus the blown up microwave that I have yet to throw out, and the day after that he’d painted the Manhattan skyline using paints he’d made himself. It wasn’t bad.
Sherlock age: 16
Sherlock’s POV
Although she had never had the largest amount of grace to her, she still had some dignity. The odds of this remaining intact dwindled as she allowed herself to stare at John for a moment. His skin was tanned from sun exposure, and he’d grown a few more inches.
I lick my lips.
He handed the photograph to Jefferson.
“Yes, John. Are you?”
“Oh my god...” the blond moaned, completely out of breath as he emptied himself.
“Definitely helped me get through these past few months...” She drawled.
Sherlock tilted his head backwards to look into johns eyes. He blushed when he instantly locked eyes with him. John looked away, his cheeks also flushed.
“Sherlock, are you going to open this door?” John asked on the off chance Sherlock was just messing with him.
“I’m his mother. A mother is supposed to be able to comfort her child when they cry. I don’t know how to help him.”
John’s phone buzzed again.
“Yes!” Sherlock howled.
“As a precaution.”
God, he’s so fucking sexy.
He’s started fiddling with his ID card clipped to his waistband.
“Have you boys had dinner? Oh, never mind. I can see you have. I do wish you’d put things in the dishwasher, Sherlock.”
Sherlock trembled, his bones liquifying under johns stare.
“God...”
“Answer me.” John growled, moving his hands up to tug at Sherlock’s hair.
“I expect this is a given, but never mention what happened today. To anyone.” John said, his steely eyes staring Sherlock down. Despite being the taller of the two, the way John was glaring at him made him feel about two inches tall.
“You are very talented at this too.”
Sherlock drew his lips in to a line, his eyebrows arched. ‘Really, dumbass?’ He thought to himself.
Sherlock balanced himself on johns shoulders as he knelt either side of the blond’s legs. He whimpered as he felt Johns erection brush at his entrance.
“John...I...I think I’m close...”
“She umm... went out looking for my sister.”
“Oh, alright.”
He watches over my shoulder as I select a song.
Johns lips were on his, desperately kissing him, thrusting his tongue in and out of his mouth. His hips were rolling against his, grinding down on him. John wanted him, he needed him. The hard, generous appendage between his leg advertised this. Next, his lips were on his neck, sucking and biting on his alabaster skin, leaving dark purple bruises. Sherlock was moaning as his neck was abused, his head thrown back in bliss. John moved his hands down sherlock’s body, and pulled his shirt over his head. The blond begun trailing kisses down his chest, drawing moans of appreciation from the other boy.
“You mean rescuing you?”
She disappeared once again down the stairs.
They both turned to see Mycroft appear at the end of the hall.
“Thank you for waiting for me.” John said quietly.
Christ, I was a soldier. I watched men die, good men. I stood at the side, stood at their funerals, watched as their families grieved, not allowing myself to cry, holding it all together. But here, now, locked in a bloody storage cupboard, I find myself unable to keep my self contained.
“Jesus, are you trying to kill me?” John panted.
“He doesn’t know that.” John cut her off.
“A film. Would you like to watch one?”
“It’s ok. Umm...” He started. “I should probably go home.”
I find my tired muscles pulling in to a grin as john drags me in to the room.
“Thank you for coming with me.”
“Oh they’re good thanks.” John smiled at Mr Holmes. “They asked after you both last time they visited.”
John slipped a hand inside the waistband of Sherlock’s jeans, but kept above his cock.
Sherlock on the other hand was being as loud as possible.
“Oh!” Sherlock gasped as he felt Johns erection pressing even further in to his thigh.
Sorry this is short, hope you enjoy. Thanks for the comments ;)
“I need- I- Agh!” He wailed in desperation.
I do my best as he presses the cold metal of the stethoscope to my chest. I can smell his rich aftershave, along with the soft note of lingering toothpaste and his shampoo. Eucalyptus, I think.
“Need a hand?”
“Oh, he wasn’t there if that’s what you’re thinking.”
Sherlock followed him in to the school, dread already filling him. It was P.E. today.
“Is this ok?” John rumbles by my ear, his lips ghosting my skin.
“Hello.”
I gently run my hands through his hair, twisting the curls between my fingers.
Whilst part of me is so glad he’s so cautious, the other part of me is getting really impatient.
Sherlock leant in by johns ear, and whispered low enough that only he could hear. “That’s actually where I bought the panties you love so much.”
“So I need to come with you to watch you be an arrogant prick to our teacher?”
He closes the distance between us.
“Indeed, but it was cute.”
“Yes, they’re just cold.”
“Piss off.”
“No colour will tone down that nose of hers.”
“Bye.” Sherlock called to him.
John said, licking his lips. “Except you..” he moved his face closer to Sherlock’s. “And me.”
“Yes.”
Wait, what?
25th of December 1914
“The man over there has been staring at you since we came in.”
“Yeah, I will.”
“You Alright?”
He took one cube from the tray, and shuffled closer to Sherlock. He thought for a moment, then settled for placing it against Sherlock’s shoulder, wanting to slowly ease him into it.
“Your gramma is appalling.”
“Yes.”
John was about to say something else when Mrs Hudson barged into the room.
Sherlock giggled and buried his head in the duvet.
“I’ve always been able to keep myself separate from my emotions... but now... now, look at me... shaking... with fear.”
Johns eyes were large, and dark, but filled with love and sincerity.
“That’s the one.” She said with a wink.
“Looks good.”
Mycroft was quiet for a minute.
“No, it’s not.” He sobbed.
“It’s jam-“
He knew this was going to hurt Sherlock, and he knew he would be the cause of it. What if he finished too fast?
The dark haired girl turned around in response, and waved.
"Checking you for a concussion." The blond chuckled.
“You’re so cute. I don’t mind. You just might want to wash your bedsheets.”
“He’s in the living room, Miss.”
He turns towards me and takes a deep breath.
After Sherlock had thrown a dart at Mycroft (it was still undecided whether that was an accident or not), the pair had ended up in her father’s study.
Regardless of what he and John had been doing, he didn’t really want to hear what Mycroft and this girl had planned. John was stood by the door, his eyebrows practically ascending into his hairline.
Without my gloves, I can feel how soft and smooth his skin is. I can also feel how fast his pulse is palpitating.
“Oh course. Nothing is ever hard for you is it?”
“There, you didn’t have to move.”
John stared down at her big blue eyes, then at her plump lips. The pair didn’t hear the last few numbers as they stared at each other, gradually leaning closer.
“Thank you.”
The blond groaned as he sank his cock further in to Sherlock’s warm body.
“God you’re so hot.” John panted, moving his head forwards to mouth at Sherlock’s jaw.
“Yeah- ah!”
No one was sure how Greg’s name had failed to sink in to Sherlock’s head, but they knew for sure that it wasn’t something he forgot on purpose. They simply corrected him, and carried on, although it didn’t matter how many times they told him.
I jerk my wrist faster as I picture Sherlock’s gorgeous face.
Shit, I’ve missed him.
Sherlock couldn’t help but marvel at John’s poker face. His face was relaxed, and his body was completely still.
I’ve been thinking about you a lot, and I miss you.
John comes up with a new way to... enjoy... Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded in understanding, and set his book down.
And all his.
Three hours later, I was arrested.
“I get up to clean my teeth, and you two are making out by the sink. I try to get cereal, and your feeding each other yogurt. I try to get in to the house, and you’re in a sheet with your tongue down his throat in the door way. The final straw will be when I find you fucking on the couch while I’m trying to watch gossip girl.” Rosie teased, strutting across the floor to grab an apple from the fridge.
“Say hello to your little friend for me, won’t you?”
“Sorry baby.”
John felt warmth spread through his heart. She remembered. There was a note tied to the parcel.
“You feel so good...” John groans with a sharp snap of his hips that draws a sharp cry of me.
“True. Wasn’t that bad till he bit Father.”
John has a minor melt down
They walked along the platform hand in hand to the ice cream cart, then sat down on a bench with their desserts.
FLASHBACK
They all stumbled outside, Sherlock on Johns back, and got a cab back to their flat.
I look up from the radio I’m desperately trying to attach to my shoulder and shrug.
Sherlock was a classical case of shy in the streets, sexy in the sheets. Although, in this case, the streets referred to his living room.
“Of course I want to. I just...”
I look up from the guard bubble and spot him handing a book to his roommate.
Anderson just sputtered something intelligible, and Donovan sensibly kept her mouth shut.
Thompson was a bright young thing, who was still enjoying the adventure that he was told war would bring.
He places a hand on my shoulder, his spider like fingers caressing my skin.
Shortly after, Mrs Holmes came in and suggested the boys went to bed, claiming that Sherlock behaved like a banshee when he hadn’t had enough sleep.
He also found a small envelope.
I want my mouth on him, I want to run my tongue over his tip, I want to swallow every drop of his release.
I can’t help but laugh as I fling my arms around him.
“I’m fine thank you, Mrs Watson.” Sherlock said, her peripheral vision still picking up on John’s manner.
John couldn’t help but smile a little.
“Alright.”
“Alright. We could go to my room.”
“What’s the point in that?”
Shit, Mycroft will be here any second.
“Mmmm... you?”
John looked down between them and at the dark wet patch on Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms and smirked.
John raised an eye at the usually blunt, and brutal teen. Even Sherlock thought he may have been laying it on a bit thick, but it seemed to be working.
“I don’t know.”
Pleased with his reaction, Sherlock began squeezing his bulge through his trousers.
“What the hell did you three do to him?”
The temptation to put a pillow over his head was one that got stronger with every passing minute.
“I simply take in my surroundings.” I drawl as I switch my gaze back to the guard in question.
John rolled his eyes at her before jogging down the stairs, only to meet his mum in the hall.
“We’ve been keeping him topped up on water all day, you have to feed him. Unless, like the solar system... knowing how to nurse a baby is also a gap in your knowledge. It’s not a trivial thing... even Mycroft knows how.”
That was when John stopped entirely. He wanted the first time he saw her come apart to be when he was inside her.
“I’m not ready.”
Sherlock jumped up, and crawled over to where John had moved to sit at the end of the bed. John patted his knee, and looked over to Sherlock with dark eyes.
The brunette smiled, and thanked her mother. Mr Holmes cried upon seeing her, and brought her into a warm hug.
Oh, he’s got three eyes... fuck what did I take...?
John licked his lips, and hummed.
Under his trousers, Sherlock was wearing cotton briefs, where a small damp patch was forming over the crotch.
John paused for a moment, tilting his head in contemplation.
He passes me a styrofoam cup, along with a packet of crispy M&Ms.
“Come downstairs when you feel like talking.”
A confused Mrs Holmes appeared at the top of the staircase, a very sleepy looking Mycroft behind her.
“Oh my god.”
“Yes.”
Normally when sherlock asked people about their lives he zoned out, and their responses ended up resembling the noise packman made when he died, but he actually listened to John.
Well, three weeks and 6 days, but still.
Sherlock didn’t say anything more, simply made a gesture for John to go ahead before flopping back down. John saw the yoghurt the other boy had had mentioned, but opted for a rice pudding instead. After heating it up, he went to sit with Sherlock.
“Nothing happened.” She said, shrugging the shirt off, leaving her in a camisole.
There was a knock at the door, and Sherlock crossed the room in three long strides.
“Ohhhh....” Is the only pathetic sound I manage to garble out.
He hasn’t so much as initiated a kiss since he got here, so it takes me a minute to gather my thoughts.
“Fucking hell.”
“You’ll be off the university after the summer. You both have exceedingly high IQs, and here you are at the bloody breakfast table fighting over a bloody jar of bloody fruit compot!”
“You haven’t got anything weird in here have you?” He asked, his fingers still on the handle.
I wipe my mouth on the back of my hand before turning my attention back to John.
He withdraws his hand from my shoulder, and I can just feel his energy sinking.
He grins, and reaches in to his pocket.
As soon as I’m inside, the buzzing increases.
“Should I stop?”
“Stay on my lap.”
John watched Sherlock closely as he slipped another finger inside him.
John moved round behind him, and gingerly spread his cheeks.
“Me too.”
Sherlock’s age: 15
“No... I’m just as surprised as you.”
“Afternoon Charles.”
“Hello, John.”
John stays over at Sherlock’s for the first time.
John stood up, and went to embrace the girl, but she stayed rooted to the spot.
“How did you know that?”
John bit his tongue to stop itself from saying the ‘L’ word. “See you in the morning... pineapples.” He said instead.
“Ginger nuts?” John asked, lifting up one of the biscuits.
Not even five minutes later, my radio buzzes.
‘Sanctify my sins when I pray.
“How’d you manage that?” Mycroft asked as she sat down.
John smiled from behind Harriet before turning his attention to Sherlock who was sat between her mother’s legs on the floor. He waved at her, which made Sherlock grin, and hide her face behind her mothers leg. Lillie came back into the room a few minutes later with a tray with five plates, and three cups of tea. After they’d finished their tea, Anne and Sherlock said their goodbyes, and went home, where Sherlock played her promised game of chess which Mrs Hudson.
“Care to dance?”
I push them back so he’s folded over, then just plough in to him without mercy.
“Yes sir.”
Sherlock was breathless beneath him as John finally connected their lips. It was heated and passionate as John slipped his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth. He bit gently at Sherlock’s lower lip, drawing moans from the curly haired teen. Sherlock pulled back after a moment to breath, his cheeks flushed. He lifted his pelvis when he felt Johns hands slide down his thighs, and under his back. He pushed a pillow underneath his narrow hips, and spread his legs so they were butterflied. He closed his eyes while he waited for John to find some lube, his heart hammering, his stomach doing back flips. He felt the mattress dip under johns weight as he clambered back on to the bed.
“Please, John...”
I inhale deeply and grit my teeth.
"Where are you going?"
“I’m sure it’s no surprise that I don’t know how to do this either.” Sherlock chuckled.
“Sherlock, I’m not a sailor-“ John exclaimed as he tried to stop Sherlock from kicking him. “I am your loving boyfriend who doesn’t want you to get into bed with your shoes on.”
Sherlock followed johns movements as he took his hand, and coated his fingers with lube. He obeyed as the blond guided him back on the bed, pulled his underwear down, and pushed his legs open.
John gave sherlock the details of the events that followed that evening. When he’d finished, the other boy remained silent.
He looks down at me and furrows his brows.
“Kate, this is my daughter, Mycroft.”
“Ugh fine.”
“You are beautiful.” He says softly, nipping at my earlobe.
“Maybe...” He trailed off when he felt Johns lips on his neck.
Sherlock reviews how boring prison is, and John has his first day as a correctional officer.
John hastily undid the ornate buttons of her blouse, and threw it across the room.
John’s eyes widened, and his cock twitched in his jeans.
John got off the bus a stop before his mum, and wandered in to the cafe beneath Mrs Hudson’s flat. He took a seat and ordered himself a latte before Sherlock sauntered through the door.
“Sure.”
Sherlock nodded in greeting, and took a seat beside her.
She gave an exasperated sigh when the teen entered the kitchen by jumping on to the coffee table. She gave them both a cup of tea, but Sherlock was too busy circling articles in another newspaper which he must have found in the other room, and kept his head bent in concentration.
If Sherlock Holmes cried tears of joy, I think he would right now.
So this is going to be the last chapter! I will do an epilogue, but that’ll be it ;)
Sherlock didn't hear the rest of what she said. He stayed in trance through out school, only leaving it to shout at the English substitute teacher, and make her cry. His head was still in the clouds on the way home.
“I- I- Ah!”
Sherlock got the impression that John didn’t apologise often.
Oh, oh, oh oh,
“Sure. Hey, they don’t know about us yet, do they?”
He smiled weakly at her.
“Fuck, I’m so sorry.” He offers in  apology as he sees the mark on my pale skin.
Sherlock gets drunk.
Unattended break room... how interesting...
Mrs Holmes may not have known the exact nature of the relationship that existed between the pair, but she knew it was one that included interactions that would rather go unseen.
“How much do you care if this thing gets ruined?” John rumbled as he tugged at the fastenings of Sherlock’s corset.
Yeah, that got it.
I grin and turn on my heel. I look back at him one last time and see him mouth the words ‘love you’.
“Please don’t make me move.”
John licked his lips before pressing them back to hers.
“Ummm... I thought we could watch a film?”
Johns mother appeared in the doorway, her eyes falling on the pair.
“Hey Sherlock.”
Sherlock shook her head, keeping her eyes trained on the space in front of her.
When she pulled back to look at him, his eyes were sad and bleary, a thousand thoughts and memories washing across his vision as he stared at the young woman before him.
“No, we’re ok.”
John, you bastard 😆
The Hokey Cokey came on, and the couples all joined into a circle. Mrs Holmes had sat out to watch her children, and was surprised to find that she’d never seen either of her daughters look so happy. After a short break, the music picked up again, but a slow song this time.
“Sherlock... I need to... be able to... see what I’m doing.” John chuckled as Sherlock kissed him desperately.
“I believe that’s mine.”
The three girls burst through the door, bags of shopping in their hands.
“Can you do that again?” He pants, his voice thick and rough.
“A guess based off the age of your wristwatch. 18th birthday present, right?”
They were only centimetres apart, breathing each other’s air.
“Rosie, shouldn’t you be at Gordon’s by now?”
Whilst she was flustered by the screaming baby, sherlock was able to remove the top of her night dress and managed to get the small infant to latch on and begin to nurse.
Sherlock turned her attention to the tiny sleeping baby in her sisters arms.
Mrs Holmes smiled sadly at John, then quickly glanced at her own son before disappearing into the kitchen.
Sherlock puffed some air out of her mouth in indifference and shook her head.
“Mum?”
If she could, she would kick herself for allowing herself to sit down.
It would be John in a five star hotel, it will be John in an old break room.
“Sherlock?! What are you doing?!”
He keeps his eyes trained on me for a moment, his tongue darting out to lick his bottom lip.
(See the end of the chapter for
“‘Mmmmm?”
“More.” She panted desperately.
“I love you... with all my heart.”
Sherlock’s gaze met his, his eyes wide.
Sherlock groaned, and reached out to grab a sofa cushion.
This was just great(!) Just peachy(!)
He wanted to touch John, to run his fingers down his muscled back, to claw at his shoulders; to let him know how much he was being pleasured. Words would have to do.
After a moment, John left for the bathroom to get some flannels, but he was back within a few seconds.
“No, daddy, no! I only want to- Agh! Please... you... oh...” Sherlock protested, his whole body convulsing.
Mycroft visibly tensed his shoulders.
“Sure.”
John chortled.
Sherlock and John get interrupted, the former gives the latter a little gift to compensate, and the possibility of moving their relationship to the next level present itself.
Enjoy!
“Is she your girlfriend?” John asked, not that he cared.
“Want to go somewhere?” He whispers, his voice a deep rumble that sends a shiver down my spine.
“I said next time you wore a skirt I would have you on all fours.”
I push him back again, and sink down before him.
Oh fuck, his lips have travelled down my chest, and he’s drawn my nipple in to his mouth, and oh god, his tongue is circling my skin, his teeth are grazing the pebbled flesh-
Sherlock slept well for the first night in a long time, both heart and mind full of John.
John couldn’t help but feel guilty as he remembered the tears that fell from Sherlock’s eyes.
“Shut up, John.”
“And did the responsible thing of telling you two.”
“Yeah, yeah.”
John pursed his lips.
John rolled his eyes, and ignored her. He took the bottle he bought for occasions such as this one from the back of the cupboard, and filled it with hot milk. When he got back to his bedroom, Sherlock was on the floor.
“Sherlock?”
“You may.”
“Alright... Do you want to hold my shoulders? This ummm... this might hurt.” John says as he moves forward to line himself up with my hole.
“It seems that all we do is watch TV.” John mused.
Sherlock awoke with her first hangover, and very little recollection of the nights events. She sat up, her hand immediately going to her pounding head. Her hand then moved to her cheek. John had kissed her. She remembered that for sure. She went down the stairs, shivering as the cold winter air nipped at her skin, the thin cotton night dress she wore doing nothing to protect her from the chill. Mycroft was in the kitchen resting her head in her arms. Sherlock took a seat opposite her, which caused the young woman to lift her head.
“What? Yes, yes I’m fine. Just... tired.” He nodded, not sure if he was trying to convince John or himself of this. The bell rang before John could ask anymore questions.
It’s not weird, it’s nice, although she does make a few flirty comments, I don’t pay much attention to it.
“Isn’t he sweet?” Irene grinned.
“Mmm... maybe we should umm... experiment with that?”
“It’ll be nice for John to finally see him.”
“Oh, don’t you look pretty.”
John ducks out from between my legs, and wipes his mouth on the back of his hand.
“Yes. Please.”
Fuck, it feels so good... I’m so deep inside him, I can feel every detail of his warm body.
“We... should... go...”
“Me too.”
“Wow. You look beautiful.”
You can find whatever you want down in max, so provided you make some promises, you can get those who come down to clean SHU to give you things.
“You know I don’t even watch TV when you’re not here?” Sherlock chuckled as he curled up in the crook of John’s arm.
Her voice was strained and horse as she garbled down the phone.
“You’re not supposed to tell people that.” I say sharply. “Besides, you don’t need to know.”
When he came back, Sherlock met his eyes immediately.
I did not proof read this.
The sandy haired girl had tagged along, and followed him into class.
I cum all over my hand before collapsing and sliding down the door.
“Nothing. Why don’t you go and write your note, and I’ll take you to the post office.”
He swallowed and looked down.
“Mmmmm, we could got to our room, but in there, we’ll just be too tempted to have sex. Out here, we’ll just stick to making out.” John said with a grin, turning to look at the blonde girl. She made a face at him, and went to get something out of the fridge. Sherlock went bright pink, and buried his head in John shoulder.
John age: 13
I move my hands up his thighs and gently part his boxers.
Sorry I’ve screwed up with the dates a little 😆
“I find that all babies resemble potatoes.”
Sherlock’s head lolled forwards as he inhaled deeply.
But he’s so pretty... with his soft pink lips, aqua feline eyes, tight, firm ass...
After a short walk, she had been forced to take a seat and remove her ever tightening shoes.
John tilts his head at this, but he doesn’t stay anything.
“Shhhh, it’s ok. You don’t have to talk about it. It’s ok.”
John looked up at Sherlock with his big, grey eyes, a few strands of blond hair falling into them. Hasn’t had his haircut in approximately seven weeks. His mother hasn’t had time to take him. She doesn’t have time for him full stop.
“True... let’s try and... rectify? I want to say rectify...?”
“I know about you and John.”
Thank fuck, the buzzing has stopped.
Sanctify the love that you crave,
John looked deep into her eyes. There were tears brimming in his own.
When she entered the room, John was staring at a blank space on the wall in front of him.
John smiled, and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.
“Take him to my mother.” She repeated as she crossed her arms over her chest.
“There’s a bar over there. I’ll take you.”
“What has you so engaged, my darling?” John asked as he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s middle.
I’m not able to offer him a verbal response just yet, so instead I place a badly aimed kiss to his temple.
“Alright, lets do something else.” John said after having chased Sherlock’s king round the board for 10 minutes.
“It’s the little pleasures, I suppose.” Mike murmurs as he shovels a spoon full of vanilla ice cream in to his mouth. The strawberry flavour tastes like medicine, and the chocolate flavour is an unsettling grey colour. Vanilla, although not very exciting, is by far the safest option.
They reconnected their lips in a passionate kiss, hot and messy, tongues fighting, teeth clacking.
Sherlock’s cheeks went pink as he thought about fooling around with John in public. Sure, they messed about in public bathrooms but that was at least behind closed doors.
“Rosamund. You can call me Rosie.”
Sherlock looked up at him with puppy dog eyes, his bottom lip glistening with salvia, and chewed between his teeth.
“Oh, it’s the old break room. We stopped using it after the heating in there went bust, it was cheeper to convert the printing room than fix it. You know this place; cut all the corners!”
“You’ll write to me, won’t you?”
“What’s in there?”
A low groan escapes him and his legs tremble.
“Fuck, Sherlock!” He yelled as he shot his load, doubling over in extreme bliss.
“Can I-“
Sherlock shivered, his mouth parting slightly. He was so turned on it was almost painful. John helped him down to the ground, and placed a pillow under his knees. Sherlock listened intently as John unzipped his trousers, and pulled them down his legs. His breath hitched when he felt Johns thick cock press against his lips. He opened his mouth, and placed his lips around the head. There were already beads of pre cum at the head for him to lick.
Sherlock was sat in the courtyard waiting for John. John wasn’t exactly the most punctual person on Earth, but he wasn’t very later either. Sherlock felt his heart beat increase upon spotting the blond a few yards away.
“I love you, John.”
Is someone else controlling my words?
Mrs Hudson chuckled, and beckoned for the girl to come to her.
Sherlock couldn’t move. It felt like she’d been thrown in to an ice bath. The blood in her veins froze, her limbs seized up, her whole body went numb. Time seemed distorted. Things were happening around her, but she couldn’t focus on those things, only the things in her own head.
Yes, I’ve read it, no I didn’t enjoy it... but you know...
“No, I’m ok. It doesn’t hurt so much now. You can continue.” Sherlock said with earnest, choosing to ignore the pain.
His hands are quick and nimble as he tears my trousers off.
“Are you ok if I go? If you need me to stay...?”
“Sentiment? Who are you, and what have you done with my Sherlock?” John laughed as the brunette buried her face in his neck.
“No.”
“You want it harder?” John asked huskily, tugging at Sherlock’s earlobe with his teeth, his breath hot against Sherlock’s skin.
They were soft and warm, and fit perfectly in his hands.
The younger two were sent to the play room with hot chocolate and biscuits, and the older two went upstairs.
“I’m sure you are.” John cooed. “Why don’t you go get in a towel while I get washed? Pick a movie, and I’ll come join you in a minute.”
“Promise.”
We both look down at our fingers, barely touching, and smile.
“Hi.”
Sherlock was grinning coyly at him, tilting his head in the cute manner he often did.
“Only you would use correct grammar here.” John chuckled. “And yes, yes you may.”
Sherlock experiences some of her lonelier years.
Hi guys, this is my first Male/Male smut, so please be gentle with me. I intend to come back and edit the chapter, as this was a bit rushed. Also, I know I have John being all ‘in charge’ but consent is always important.
John sat up, and rearranged them so Sherlock was straddling his waist.
“Let him.”
“I know. Now shhh, and come in to the bubble.”
“Why...?”
“Wha... oh...” Sherlock giggled when he felt John turn the vibrator on.
“John... I overheard you and Harriet talking upstairs.”
“Have you lot eaten?”
My voice comes out somewhere between a hiss and a plea.
“Do you think you’re ready?” I ask him when I feel as though he’s reasonably stretched.
“Eat what you can dear. Your mother is staying next door for dinner, and your sister took the baby out, but I’ll come and sit with you.”
I am probably going to screw this up.
"It's not claiming if you really have done it. It's telling."
John smirked at him and let out a husky chuckle.
Sherlock blushed.
John darted his tongue out to lick his lips, a smirk forming on his face. He kissed Sherlock forcefully, emitting a groan from the younger teen.
“Hello.” Sherlock said, not moving.
I assume he means preparations, so I nod my head somewhat bashfully.
Harriet quirked her eyebrows in amusement as she watched her flustered little brother, clearly having caught him going somewhere he’d rather not say.
“And yes, you are an asshole. I won’t lie to you. But you’re also a great young man. In fact, one day,” he said, standing up. “You might even make a good one.”
John went to pull out, but Sherlock stopped him with a hand to his shoulder.
“Ok, I have housework to do, but if you want to download a film, or something let me know. I can make you some snacks, drinks-“
“Yes. Besides, I have homework to do.”
Sherlock snapped her attention back to John. He was regarding her with worried eyes, scanning her face.
“I promise I’m not going back to that stuff... that shitting stuff that landed me in here. I promise, I pro-“ My voice cracks, and I start... crying?
“That makes sense. Kind of like a pen pal, I guess. You’ve never met them, but you you know them anyway.”
“Thank you. Could you help me with the ties please? I didn’t dare go back into Mycroft’s room.”
14th of April 1918
I nod, then practically scuttle back to the dorm. I get dressed in my cube, preserving my modesty as best I can by awkwardly holding my towel as I hop in to my pants.
She shoved another teacake in to her mouth to avoid the possibility of saying something hateful.
John brought his hands back under Sherlock’s ass, and carried him over to the bed. He covered Sherlock’s body, still situated between his legs. Sherlock’s erection was straining painfully up against his shorts, poking into john’s stomach. John was practically attacking Sherlock’s mouth with his own, sucking on his bottom lip, flicking Sherlock’s tongue with his. John pulled Sherlock’s top off, shortly followed by the shorts. He was surprised that Sherlock had his cotton briefs on underneath, but those were pulled off too before he could think anymore about it.
“Can I wear the yellow dress?” Sherlock asked, slipping out of the chair whilst Mrs Hudson got more hair ties.
“Oh god- John- mmm!”
I can tell he’s not just saying this in the hopes that I will brush off his concern and agree, but he genuinely means it. I can see the sincerity in his deep blue orbs as he stares up at me.
“There you go.”
Sherlock bent over and pressed their lips together.
John moved his fingers in and out, eliciting moans of pleasure from the brunette.
Mycroft smiled softly, and affectionally squeezed the younger girl’s shoulder. She left for her room, quietly humming ‘sweet Adeline’.
Paulette, her name was.
“Moving your hand up and down? Yeah.” He groans, overlapping our dialogue.
John had stroked himself through three orgasms that night, the memories of the day fresh in his mind. He hadn’t wanted to get out of bed, but school wouldn’t wait for him. The reminder that he would see Sherlock was what finally woke him up. He rolled out of bed, and groggily set about getting ready. He left the house before his mother, or Harriet was back at home, could notice. He spotted Sherlock walking towards the school gates in front of him, head down, lost in thought.
“He’s my chemistry lab partner.” John said, suddenly feeling uncomfortable that the sinister, older teen had been watching them.
“It is indeed.”
John took Sherlock's long fingered hand in his, and pulled him to his feet.
Sherlock had been prepared for another day of being ignored, that’s pretty much how every other day of his life had gone, but John ran up to greet him at the gates.
Sherlock smiled nervously, and bowed his head.
She ran her fingers through lucy’s soft hair whilst she tapped her other hand on her bump.
JOHN’S POV
“Yeah, none of us can.”
“I want to make love to you again and again...mmmmgghh... fuck.”
“Oh who will find me?”
“And how about studying? Are you enjoying the subject?”
“Well, isn’t that amusing. Now, get up on the bed, and drink your milk.”
“Like a baby. Woke with the most dreadful hangover though.”
8th of May 1917
“Let’s see a picture.”
“Tea?” Mrs Hudson asked, resting a hand on the teen’s knee.
“Fuck.”
Sherlock crawled down to the end of the bed, and knelt up to connect their lips.
“Hello, love.”
I try to make my swallow as inconspicuous as possible as I nod for her to go ahead.
“Holmes.”
“Coffee sounds good.”
I wonder what he’s like in other departments.
“Wow.”
She smiled politely, and placed the teacup in its saucer on the table.
“Well, I appreciate your honesty. I asked you if you wanted to come over tomorrow?”
He was definitely milking it, but the over the top noises just helped fuel John’s arousal.
This was of course a lie. Sherlock knew that John would go home after this, and he’d have to share him with other people. Here, he didn’t have to fight people for his attention. John would get bored with him, and he’d be alone again. Alone was there for him before John, it would be there after John. Alone was all he had. He blinked away the tears he felt brimming in his eyes.
John no longer liked the warmth.
John presented Sherlock with one ear bud from his headphones.
I have to get back to work before anyone notices I’m gone. I also have to make sure no one comes down this corridor. God forbid anyone notices he’s missing.
“What? Why?”
"Jillian was a good teacher according to the papers, in fact she was an excellent teacher, highly sort after. She was meant to be transferring. In a video clip on the news, she is sat sporting a very vivid shade of orange lipstick.”
I look down at the file in my lap.
John wouldn’t tell him now.
“What?”
Maybe this isn’t so difficult. John seems to be enjoying it.
I’m sure I resemble a simpering, whining mess as I come down from my high.
It’s the most intense, voluptuous experience I’ve ever had. The solo dalliances I’ve engaged in are nothing compared to the feel of Johns warm, ruff, manly hands...
It amuses me when he gets all nervous and coquettish. He has a blush that starts at his cheeks and goes all the way down his pale chest, a few curly strands of dark hair residing in the middle, reminding me of his adolescence.
“Mum.”
“Are you going to marry... Gary.”
She watched as his train left, walking along the platform beside it until it’s green metal body left her sight. The first few seconds, she was completely numb. She wasn’t quite sure what she was doing. She looked down at the yellow line along the platform, only to see that it was behind her, and that she was stood right at the edge. She knew what would happen if she took one more step. She stepped forwards, but what she’d expected didn’t come.
He pulled her face up to his, and kissed her firmly on the lips, snapping her back.
“God... you’re so fucking sexy... I can’t wait to be inside you...”
I look around to ‘check the coast is clear’ before slowly making my way over to him.
I thought I posted this already, but just realised I hadn’t 😆
“Can I have my book?” I say a little more bluntly than I meant to, but I feel as though my brain has been dropped in a vat of ice water, and whatever filter I had has crumbled. He blinks a few times, either snapping from a daze or taken aback.
“Good morning.”
I wish he didn’t wake up in a cold sweat because of the decisions I made.
“Can you send me another photo of you. One where you’re smiling.”
While in the outside that may not seem like a long time, but this place has a way of slowing everything down.
I force myself to speak before the words in my head consume me.
“Indeed.” Sherlock beamed.
FLASHBACK CHAPTER
“Where the fuck are you going so early? And with out a shirt?”
Long chapter here, hope you enjoy! 1914 won’t be long, and romance will blossom soon! Let me know how much ‘sauciness’ you guys would like. ;)
Johns eyes flew wide, his jaw dropping. He and Sherlock had fooled around a lot, but never got this far.
“You understand me?” He growls, staring me down.
John reattached his lips to Sherlock’s ear, mouthing at the shell, tracing the sensitive area with his tongue. Sherlock rolled his neck into johns touch, small sighs escaping him. John’s hands travelled up Sherlock’s torso, every nerve tingling.
Sherlock age: 9
“Wait, he’s in our house?”
“I never saw this coming. Although, Watson, you do always look way too cheery for someone who works in a prison. All the while you’ve been dipping your pen in the prison ink.”
"Where's John?"
“I that am lost, oh who will find me? Deep down below the old beach tree. Help succour me now the east winds blow. Sixteen by six sister, and under we go.”
I scratch that thought from my mind, forcing it away so I can focus on the task at hand... at mouth?
Sherlock gets a taste of what it’s like to date the football captain.
“Oh, ah, ah, mmnnngh!” John groaned as he slammed his hips forward, causing obscene, wet, slapping noises.
“I can’t go back to what my life was before him...”
He beamed up at her, and stroked his thumb over her cheek.
He then dropped his eyes down to the part of him that was more than awake, probably even more now that he’d spoken to Sherlock.
“What you do then?” Irene slurred.
It seems like he needed to hear it too as he pauses, and stares at me in astonishment before pressing our foreheads together.
“You and Watson. Craziest place you’ve had sex.”
“Oh god, John! Right there! Right there! That’s it! Agh!”
“So sensitive, aren’t you?” John asked, running his fingers down Sherlock’s stomach.
John stifled a chuckle. They both grimaced as they heard Mycroft join in.
“Yes.”
He managed to pull johns shirt over his head, musing his hair so it was spiked up at all angles. Sherlock licked his lips as he stared up at John. John reconnected their lips, kissing Sherlock fiercely.
“So, we’ve got you for three weeks.” John stated as they walked down the quiet street.
I look up when I hear my name.
In fact, John was so surprised at Sherlock’s outcry that he almost pulled all the way out.
I yank my hands free, and fall back away from him.
Sherlock and John steel a heated moment.
JOHN’S POV
“I saw an ad in the paper.” She chuckles.
I’m thrown in to a confrontation with myself on whether I want to reward myself by grinding down on him, and finding release, or whether I want to keep my briefs dry.
A plot? Oh yes.
Before she could really comprehend what she was doing, she thrust her hand in between johns legs.
The brunette nodded, his cerulean feline eyes brimming with tears.
John worked at Sherlock’s skin with his teeth, his lips, his tongue, leaving wet marks of slick saliva as he moved his mouth. Sherlock went to turn around, but John put his hand on the back of his head, keeping him still.
“How’s that going?”
They walked quickly down to johns house, laughing and joking as they went, affectionately bumping each other’s shoulders. John caught himself staring at Sherlock as they approached his house. He wasn’t sure how it had taken him so long to realise, but he had fallen in love with him.
“Besides, it’s slightly less depressing to sit in a hotel crying over my sorrows than it is to stay here. It is.” Molly quipped when Irene opened her mouth to say otherwise.
“How did you sleep?”
The two other girls chuckled, then turned their attention to the only member of their group who hadn’t been asked.
“John...” Sherlock groaned, arching his back.
He seems satisfied with this, and turns his attention back to weeding.
John.
Mrs Watson knocked on the door after a moment drawing their attention. In her arms, she carried bed linens.
Sherlock was careful to push his body flush against John, rubbing against his legs, his cock, his stomach and his chest as he stood back up.
“I’ll get a douche or something. They sell them at the pharmacy. And you can pull out, ok?”
“Don’t stand so close!” Sherlock yells, and inflicts a well aimed shove to the centre of my chest.
“While I appreciate the double entendres, John, if I had done exactly that, I wouldn’t be in this mess.”
John grinned back at him, and shot him a playful wink.
“You say that.” Rosie sighed from where she was face down on the floor.
“Really?””
‘Not good enough’
“Alright then. Thank you.”
“Oh fuck...” Sherlock groaned as he slipped a finger inside himself, and threw his head back, eyes squeezed shut.
“You’re lucky you’re narrow, other wise you’d struggle to find clothes that fit you here.”
“We’ll say goodbye here, then my parents will go with me to the station.”
“Let me finish. Now, I don’t want to make a big thing about it, but I want you to be safe.”
“One moment father.” She said as she jumped up.
“Yes, yes, I’m fine.”
He tightens his grip on my hips, and pulls me to him at such an angle that my erection brushes up against his.
I had power when he had nothing.
“A police officer came in today. Guess who it was.” He chirps as he struggles with his chopsticks.
“Thank fuck you’re back. Moly ‘testified’  against moriarty. That bastard has finally been kicked down to maximum where he belongs... Why are you looking at me like that?”
20th of October 1918
The letter read...
The first inch or two was always difficult, and it usually resulted in Sherlock leaving claw marks down John’s back. But he was a little tied up for that, and instead pulled his arms forward, rattling the headboard. John kept his gaze firm, but he was cautious as he adjusted himself. He kept his weight on his arms, positioned either side of Sherlock’s head. Said boy was gazing up at him in adoration. He was completely immersed in the moment. The only thing he saw was John. John, with his dark gaze, tousled hair, muscles glistening with sweat. Sherlock felt completely safe. He relaxed after a moment as his body grew more accustomed to John’s movements.
“Open your mouth.”
“Indeed.”
“And sex with you is less dangerous. And far better.” Sherlock added when he saw a playful glare forming on johns face.
Somewhat gingerly, he slips the elastic waistband of my trousers down over my hips to my ankles. I quickly kick off my shoes and discard the trousers also.
What I don’t see though, is how Euros counts as either of these things.
“Yes?”
“Oh fuck...”
After work ends, it’s back inside for dinner. I sit with my involuntary choice of company, and manage to completely filter out all the nonsensical jibber jabber that goes on. After dinner, I head back to my cube via the library. I can’t wait for the books mycroft claims to have posted anymore. I scan the classics for a moment till a chilling voice reaches my ears.
“I worry about him. Constantly.”
I know he’s already decided on whether to help me or not. The only time Mycroft is indecisive is about what dessert he should have.
9th of August 1914
“Does it matter?”
“What did you-“
She broke in to a run and retreated as fast as she could towards the tree line at the end of the garden.
“What the fuck do you think you’re playing at?!” I snap as I close the door to the storage cupboard.
Sherlock was regarding John with a quizzical expression. The boy in question was definitely close to being half hard now. He’d have to do something before anyone noticed.
“We’re just going upstairs for a moment, then we’ll be straight out.” Sherlock said quickly before escaping from the room as fast as he could before his mother could notice his little problem. John quickly scurried after him, and chased him up the stairs. Sherlock desperately attacked his lips as soon as they were in his room. John responded quickly, opening his mouth to provide Sherlock full access. Sherlock brought his arms up to wrap around johns neck. He was so turned on from John’s teasing. He wanted John to touch him, kiss him, pleasure him. John placed his hands on Sherlock’s hips, and pushed him against the door. The brunette gasped out a moan as his back hit the wood. John was in between his legs in an instant, his erection painfully obvious as it poked into Sherlock’s leg.
John smiled as he considered the analogy.
What if he doesn’t want this once he’s out...?
Sherlock rolled her eyes. The twelve year old was more than capable of looking after herself, and found this an insult.
This was difficult to write. I mean, it’s sherlock.
“Yes.” I say simply, leaving out the bit because I was eager to see him, although my early arrival suggests just that.
“What’s that?” Rosie asked.
"The newspaper. I didn't see it before. Where was it?"
“I think I’m gonna be sick.”
“I don’t regret it.” She assured him.
“You ok?”
He sounds partially confused at what’s happening, but mostly he’s overwhelmed by pleasure, that much I can tell by the way his eyes are rolling about in his skull.
"It's funny. That's the point."
“I have the head, one more push!”
Odd, he thought to himself as he slit open the top with a swift flail of his knife.
Surprisingly, he chuckles at this, his flush plump lips parting to show his pearly, slightly crooked teeth.
“I’m guessing you know who I am. I assure you, I make a much better impression when I’m not hooked up to a morphine drip.”
I manage to get through the mundanity that is lunch, desperate to keep the ever persistent grin off my face.
“It’s the Cure. Love cats. It’s a good song.”
“Do you want to play checkers?” John asked.
“Anyway, What was it you wanted dear?”
“Ignore him. So, the infamous Sherlock Holmes. John talks about you all the time.”
“Jesus... fuck...” John mumbled, slumping forwards to catch his breath.
The blond settled into a steady rhythm, burying his cock to a hilt before pulling almost all the way out.
Being shut away with himself... his own worst enemy... no escape... other than drugs.
“Do it again?”
“You Alright there, darling?”
Sherlock.
Wait, what?
“Yeah, Sherlock covered that earlier.” Greg noted.
“I’m going to wake her. Will you be ok down here?”
“Sherlock Holmes.”
“Thank you.”
John pulled away from Sherlock for a moment, holding him at arm’s length so he could look at him.
“Oh...”
“Sherlock Holmes.” She says, turning to me. “Your brother works for the government, does he not?”
His cold, beady eyes stare in to mine.
Supposedly, sex is rather nice after the first bit.
“Who, John?”
“Maybe a hand job.”
Rosie giggled to herself as she scurried away in to the kitchen.
“I’m fine. A little case of strangling never hurt anyone.” I shrug. “Well, apart from the people who die...”
“Sherlock.” Johns voice sounds behind me, ordering me to halt my footsteps.
She pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock heard her leave through the front door, and watched as she walked down the path. She decided to take her mother’s advice, and took up her knitting. The pain in her wrists came and went by the hour, but she didn’t notice. Knitting would give her something to do, but all the tasks in the world wouldn’t change the fact that nobody knew were John was.
“He’s having an affair.”
“Beg for it. Like the horny slut you are.”
I’ve never had enough time to see how long his refractory period is, so I don’t want to make him cum yet, just in case.
John wasn’t convinced, the dread that he was going to hurt her both restraining him and helping to keep him grounded.
“I- really?” He asked innocently.
“Well, you know what I think Sherlock?”
John was missing.
“So do we, join the club.” Greg smiled.
“John?”
John paused for a moment to allow him to settle, before slipping his finger all the way inside.
He could feel the subtle vibrations in his body, but obviously not us much as John who’s eyes had rolled in to the back of his head as a low moan escaped him.
“You know you actually have to sweep this floor, right?”
“Of course. I was testing the burning rates of different biscuits to record their fat content. I’d like to hear his thoughts.”
“I was trying to make you cum daddy!” Sherlock howled.
There was a brief moment when Sherlock lost all hope of having a happy future.
When we pull away this time, it only lasts a second or two before his hands are on my face, pulling me back to him.
“Oh fuck.”
“Oh john...” Sherlock mumbled, dragging his hands down Johns muscular body. Much to his disappointment, John pulled back again. He got off the bed, and walked to the other side of the room.
Sherlock leant in, and pressed his lips to john’s.
Shit, maybe he isn’t ready after all.
“Of course.”
Apart from today.
“Do you think I look like an otter?”
John pulled his fingers out, and stayed quiet, unable to tear his eyes off the sight before him.
He makes a grab for my hair, tugging ever so pleasurable at my roots...
“Oh it was bally awful.” Sherlock muttered as they stepped on to the bus.
“She’s very cute, Mycroft.” John beamed, gently stroking the sleeping baby’s cheek.
“Get them off now so I can fuck you.”
I shake my head as I feel the nagging thought attempt to spread, causing my every nerve to cease up and panic me.
“Is it?”
“Sherlock...” John groaned low in his throat.
“Does this mean you’re going to stop with all the weirdness.”
She shivered under his touch, and moaned sharply into his mouth.
“Just looking for spelling mistakes...”
Sherlock’s head was hung low, jaw clenched, his eyes screwed shut as John began pounding in to him.
She groaned in to his mouth as he hitched it up around her waist, his hands coming to rest on her thighs.
Blood.
Irene handed him the set Rosie had picked up along with a few more.
John worked his fingers in and out, drawling low whines of pleasure from Sherlock.
"Why is everyone obsessed with pyjamas?" Sherlock asked, turning to look at John.
“Charming as ever, brother mine. How are you?” Mycroft’s mellifluous voice asked on the other end of the phone.
“Bathroom. Now.” John husked, grabbing Sherlock by the hand, and dragging him off the dance floor.
“I know.” She said quietly.
I relax as he walks away without a fuss.
cos I’m the one who knows who you are, ooh.’
“And Mycroft.”
“Thank you for loving me.”
“Can I have my book?”
Which is true, but I chose being a correctional officer for a reason. I need something invigorating. Something exciting.
“What?” He asked as he pulled himself off the doorframe.
“Oh, hello Sherlock. Sorry dear, was that you in there with George?”
“I love you.”
“Right, I’ll volunteer you, and when you kick up a fuss, I’ll be a bit more firm.” He says, putting an unmissable stress on the word firm.
“Thank you my darling. Esme, what do you say to mummy?”
Sherlock reached forwards to stroke johns cheek.
“Fuck.” John sighed, and slid down the wall so he was level with Sherlock.
“Alright.” She said softly. “I’ll have lily make up the other sofa.”
“Are you sure you wanna do this? I mean you could lose your job if they investigate this.”
“Ok, what’s going on?”
“Morning guys. Did not expect to see you at all today.” Irene said with a grin.
“I... nnggghh.” He groaned, gripping the bedsheets between his fists.
“Ah... ah- ah! John...”
That’s what you’re suppose to say, but it didn’t feel right.
“Mmmm... slowly though.” Sherlock mumbled.
The brunette didn’t respond.
“You know it makes it sound like we’re gonna eat them right?”
John swallowed, then wiped his mouth on the back of his hand.
“Guess we’d better go down.”
“Oh, he’s basically a toddler.”
“Open it.”
“What?” John mumbled against Sherlock’s lips, reluctant to break the kiss.
Sherlock gasped, and rolled his head. He looked deep into Johns eyes, and smiled coyly at him.
“Right, this is the year we get that bastard.”
“Have a little faith?” She asked mirthfully.
“Your majesty, I believe your chariot awaits.”
“I could have, but I didn’t want to. Anyway, Irene, will you do it?”
I hand him the pillow from my chair, which he settles on cross legged opposite me.
“Putting on a nice little show for me...”
“I am not vanilla.”
He pulls back, and his aqua eyes are brimming with tears.
“Happy new year, John.” Sherlock stuttered.
“Mmmm... but what about her eyes?” Sherlock muttered.
“It’s not alright! If anyone finds out, they’ll extend my sentence!”
We’re actually going to have sex.
“Was this all a plan? Did you bring me here to seduce me?”
"I know who did it. We need to tell the police."
It’s easier to kiss him now though, so I can’t complain too much.
I giggle as he lifts me up and walks me over to drop me on the sofa.
Bitter sweet chapters. Gotta love ‘em. Thank you for the comments 😊
Sherlock shrugged, and took the plate of cookies from her.
“Of course. Now, what do you two want for breakfast?”
“Indeed. Did you have something planned?”
“He’s gone!” She wailed, crying her eyes out.
“Fine, but if you break your promise, I’ll be very disappointed.” Sherlock mumbled, trying to push her curly, black mane behind her ears.
I feel myself reaching for him again.
I gape at him as he turns me around by my shoulders, steers me out the door and out in to the darkness.
He went in to the bedroom, and bolted the door behind him. He rifled through the draws for that bag, that bag containing that outfit that he’d gone out and bought in secret. The outfit that he’d forget about, then he’d remember, and he’d go all warm on the inside.
“What are you gonna do to me...?”
His cock is long and thick, easily seven inches, engorged and leaking at the tip. I just sit on his thighs, staring down at his cock, possibly drooling, blinking and trying to even out my breathing.
"Will your mum and dad be home soon?" John asked as he steered the giddy teen into the lounge.
The brunette turned his head slowly. He ran his eyes over her before he spoke.
“Come on.” John insisted, grabbing Sherlock by his ankles and pulling him towards him.
“Roll your sleeve up please.”
Sherlock frowned. He hated clubs. Dancing with John was fun, but Sherlock argued they could do that in their living room.
“True. You sure you’re ok?” John asked, coming to sit down beside Sherlock.
John used the remote six more times during brunch. By the fifth, Sherlock was teetering on the edge, squirming in his chair, painfully hard. He was about ready to whack Johns fork out of his hand, drag him in to the bathrooms and demand that the blond fuck him there and then. But instead, he kept quiet, and simply watched the athlete sip at his coffee, quietly coming up with a plot on what he’d do to him when they got home. Sherlock’s reactions were subtle; his eyes would close, his fists would clench, and his breath would hitch, none of these things eye catching. But john was watching. John knew he was acting on pleasure. He was hard himself just at the knowledge of what was going on. He loved watching Sherlock wriggling about, readjusting himself, desperately trying to follow the intricate story Molly was telling him. The sixth time, John left it going just a little longer. If it wasn’t for the upbeat music, lively conversation, and general ruckus of the diner, he’d be afraid someone would here the buzzing. Sherlock closed his eyes momentarily, clenched his fists at his sides, and held his breath. It made John chuckle quietly as it dawned on him that if this was happening to anybody but Sherlock, said brunette would have guessed what was going on straight away. But, it was Sherlock, and he was having a very difficult time keeping himself together. His legs were shaking slightly now, and his cheeks were a dark shade of pink. Not wanting to be cruel, John turned it off again. Sherlock exhaled a shaky breath, and took a gulp of his coffee.
“What a coincidence?!” She exclaimed, slapping her hands down on her knees with great vivacity, making her intoxicated companion jump.
“I wouldn’t be so sure about that.” John said bitterly, looking everywhere but his sister.
A room, an old break room I think, has been decorated with fairy lights, actually, Christmas lights that dangle from the ceiling, and a blanket is hung off the back of the sofa, pegged up on a bookcase and a table, creating a canopy over a pile of blankets, pillows and sofa cushions.
Sherlock looked down at John, who had curled in on himself, his normal broad shoulders slouched, making him appear smaller than he was.
“One of the librarians ran in to me with a book trolly.”
“Hi, Rosie. I’m John.”
“Come on then.” He coos as hell pulls me in to the abandoned break room.
“You’re not scared of him are you?”
Mrs Holmes appeared on the patio, and came to sit beside Sherlock.
“No, mum. This has gone too far! Look at her! She’s going to end up dead if she doesn’t stop!”
“Yes.”
He stares at me for a moment in waiting, his eyes searching mine.
“Oh john!” The brunette gasped at the sudden contact
I hesitate only briefly before dismounting him, and rearranging ourselves so that I’m on my back, propped up on a pillow with him so that he’s sat between my legs.
Sherlock grinned smugly at John, who rolled his eyes in return.
He rolled Sherlock over, making the narrow boy squeak as he trapped him beneath him.
“Happy new year, Sherlock.”
Mrs Hudson frowned when she saw the small child had got out of the chair, and was trying to open the wardrobe.
“Do you two have to do this in the door way?”
“What for?”
“Your face is warm.” Sherlock hummed happily, nosing at Johns cheeks.
Both women shared a smile, before Kate’s attention went to the little girl who had begun tugging at a loss thread on her dress.
John was stood in front of the mirror trying to decide how to wear his hair. He’d changed outfits six times before deciding on a green v neck jumper, and dark blue jeans. He flipped his hair to the right, then the left, the spiked it, then combed it down. He eventually settled on wearing it combed to the side, holding it fast with gel. He tried to use some of the body spray he’d been given at Christmas, and ended up choking on it. John was hoping his mother wouldn’t notice that he’d put in some effort when getting ready, and start asking questions. Thankfully, his mother didn’t have Sherlock’s talents, and hardly noticed John was even downstairs. She was the least observant person on earth.
“Looking forward to visitation tomorrow?”
“Oh, god! Oh, Mycroft! Oh, you’re so big! Yeah, oh god, right there! Harder!”
“Nnngghh!” Sherlock groaned, throwing his head back.
“How would you feel if they did walk in?”
“John... is this a but plug?” I ask, analysing the small object in my hand.
“Thank god.”
“Thank you. How many more shops? My back account can’t take much more spending.”
John age: 17
Sherlock giggled nervously, looking up at John through his lashes.
Enjoy! Thank you for the kudos and comments :)
John realises he hasn’t been as secretive as he thought.
They walked in a comfortable silence back to johns house.
By this point, Sherlock was shaking with arousal, his nerves tingling.
“Medical student, you paint and play rugby in your spare time, you’re a long way from home, second child.” Sherlock said in one breath, his eyes roaming john from head to toe.
“I’m sorry I lost my temper.”
John turned to look at Mycroft who had what looked like porridge on his head. The older boy simply nodded his head in greeting, then sauntered away, ignoring the glances of confusion from both his mother and John.
I really tried to keep this chapter real. It’s also not as depressing as the title makes it out to be 😆
“Did you hear that, mum?”
Hearing him say that sends shivers down my spine as a warm, fuzzy feeling spreads through the rest of my body.
Johns voice was low growl, his breath hot against Sherlock ear, making him shiver.
“Shall we have a look around?” Rosie asked, linking her arm with his.
John pulled out as gently as he could, and disposed of the condom before going in search of his jeans.
John takes Sherlock to the museum for her birthday.
“You can’t see me right now, but I’m smiling.” John chuckled.
John couldn’t help but chuckle at Sherlock’s eagerness.
I see john’s facial expression change again, this time to one of what I perceive as shock.
John paused. There were things he’d like it to be, but Sherlock was still young. She’d need time.
“It only gets worse.” Mycroft drawled as she swanned in to the room.
We’re standing very close to each other now, our chests are centimetres apart, our hips are touching, our faces close as we breathe each other’s air.
“Yes, baby. That good.”
John smiled again as he thought about how very special Sherlock was to him. Then he remembered the conversation that was waiting for him at home, and his stomach dropped.
I learn more little tidbits about his life, like his hobbies, his family, particularly the older brother who intrudes in every aspect of his life.
“Ok.”
“Oh, Thank you.”
“Oh fuck!” The brunette cried as he brushed his prostate, being sure to be as loud as he could.
“Yes, I- oh!” Sherlock gasped, his arousal spiking as John experimentally rolled his hips.
John scrolled through his playlists, pausing when he came across a particular song.
“Get on your knees.” John ordered.
Oh, lord mother of fuck! Fucking hell, this hurts like a bitch!
“Oh, Sherlock. Hello.”
“Some food for the train. Now, remember to share.”
“Right, yes.” I say, snapping back to reality.
John also be a virgin? Let me know, thanks.
“Sorry.” She chuckled as she wiped her eyes.
John continued kissing him hungrily as the brunette’s nimble fingers made short work of the buttons on his chocolate stained shirt.
“You feel so fucking tight around my cock. So fucking good!”
Sherlock shuddered. He could feel himself turning to absolute jelly under John’s intense stare. He wanted nothing more than for John to fuck him senseless, fuck him in to the mattress so hard that he couldn’t walk the next morning. He could feel his cock throbbing between his legs as he thought about it, desperate for attention. John pressed their lips back together, and began thrusting his tongue into Sherlocks mouth. Sherlock tasted absolutely delicious. Chocolate and vanilla. That gave him an idea.
“That’s called being bisexual, you twat.”
Don’t worry, the chapters stop being soppy and empty soon.
I scramble around beside me for my watch.
“I- ok...”
Sherlock giggled, and pressed their lips together more forcefully. John leant back against the side of the bath, pulling Sherlock with him. The brunette sprawled out on his chest, gripping his waist with his legs as he gently rolled his hips. John moaned softly as Sherlock ran his tongue along his lips, asking for entrance. The blond happily obliged, his moans getting louder as Sherlock sucked on his tongue, a favoured move of his. John pulled the brunette closer by his hips, and began forcefully thrusting his tongue in to his mouth. Sherlock let out a low groan, enjoying the feeling of John’s hardening length pressing into his abdomen. He brought his hands up to run his fingers through johns soft blond hair. He gasped into johns mouth when he felt the blond pinch his backside. John didn’t even want to think about the amount of water that had sloshed over the sides and in to the floor from all their movement.
Oh no.
Fuck, where did that come from?
Sitting in the quiet back row had been a rather marvellous idea.
He was shot in the head. His eyes went wide as blood poured from his skull. He fell forwards, and collapsed in the crimson pool. It shook John to his very core. He lay in bed that night, tossing and turning. He wondered who would tell David’s mother he wasn’t coming home. John began to cry as he imagined her stood on her porch, praying to god that the mail man wasn’t bringing her a yellow telegram.
oh, oh, oh.’
2 months.
She left the two boys alone in silence while John texted his mother to say where he was. After a few minutes, John eventually broke the silence.
“I... I think I’m close.” John groaned, his fists balling up the sheets.
“What about?”
“Ah- ah- mnngg- oh! Oh! OH! J- Jo- oh- JOHN!” Sherlock howls loudly as he reaches his orgasm.
All is well here.
Both John and Mrs Holmes watched him with caution as he dragged himself up the stairs before going in to the kitchen.
Other girls were embraced by their relatives, laughing, crying. They were all occupied with their own goodbyes, so John took advantage of the moment, and leant forwards to press a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“Such a drama queen. Anyway, you don’t have to worry now. He’ll probably stay in there till tomorrow evening.”
His little display worked better than he predicted. John’s normally deep navy eyes had darkened to black as his lust grew. He was staring at Sherlock with an almost predatory gaze as the brunette
“About 20:00. Why?” Sherlock asked as he got up to reboil the kettle.
“Yes.” He whispers.
“I promise.”
I bite my lip to refrain from snapping at him any further.
I chew the inside of my cheek, and flop back on to my bed. I don’t need to piss off the people who don’t hate me, even I know that. The guard is gone by dinner time. There is another new guard, a woman. I’m not getting anything from her, and it’s... unsettling. She appears to be the focus of a lot of the other inmates. She fits the traditional beauty standards, I suppose. She’s of no interest to me though. I continue with my book, slowing my pace as I’ve only a few chapters left. I may as well ask Mycroft tomorrow to post me some new books instead of calling my parents, and wasting my phone credit. Despite my best attempts, I’ve finished the book by lights out. Bother. There are of course books in the library, but the contents of which are all very mundane. I assume the new guard will be here tomorrow. It would be weird to make him start on a Friday, and then not make him work on Saturday, even though it is by far the hardest day. I eventually fall asleep. Boredom is a wonderful sedative.
“You can sing this to your own soon, can’t you?”
“Ready player one? Sure.”
“Sore... but otherwise, yes.”
“Most people don’t complain about that...”  Sherlock muses.
Mrs Hudson smiled broadly at John, then turned to regard the lanky teenager who had propped himself against the kitchen door.
“No sir.” Sherlock said, quickly adverting his eyes.
The next few minutes were the worst. They went by so slowly up until the didn’t. Suddenly, everything went by in a blur.
“Indeed.” The blond smiled. “You know what they say about experiments?”
“John Watson.” He said, pointing to the blond who was currently running with the ball. “What about you?”
While they dealt with all the formalities, Sherlock eyed up Greg, and made her deductions. Avid smoker, pipe not cigarettes, owned a large dog, social drinker, sportsman.
Moly sputters on her tea.
All the sounds around her cut off the moment she reached him.
“What about curly over there?”
“What darling?”
JOHN’S POV
“Are you?” He asked after a moment, just to be sure.”
“Umm... I was meant to send you back down to medical tomorrow, but I can just have a look at you now. I just need to check for any bruises.”
John had a massive growth spurt over the summer, and had built up muscle from rugby. This made him look a lot older.
“I- ahem- I... like you a lot, and I just panicked. I’ve never liked a boy before, and then...” He kept his gaze fixed on Sherlock this time.
“That’s different, she’s a nymphomaniac.” Rosie said round a mouth full of ice cream.
He shakes his head, shrugging it off.
“No.”
John age 9
“Ah!” Sherlock whimpered, reaching out to grasp at the bed sheets.
“I have a question.” He mumbled against the blond’s lips.
Sherlock wasn’t quite sure how he’d been talked in to this, but he’d ended up going on girls night to a club. John had rugby, so he didn’t really have anything better to do. He was now on the third round of shots, and he’d already forgotten what his name was. Sherlock went through six phases of being drunk.
“No, it was. So good in fact. But these are nice trousers. I don’t want to ruin them. Do you get what I’m saying?” John asked with a smirk.
Sherlock followed after, her toes curling, her back arching as the euphoric pulsation enveloped her whole body.
After that, she always talked to Sherlock. She’d hadn’t been sure if the pair were just friends until John scored the winning touch down in a game, and ran to the stands to pull Sherlock into a kiss.
Enjoy!
“Moriarty got put in juvie for blowing up his school.”
“Yes...”
23rd of July 1917
I notice him flinch a little when his eyes fall on the foil packet grasped between my fingers.
“It was actually fairly amusing. I appreciate your services.”
What if I’m not good enough for him?
“So how comes you three are dressed up?”
That’s exactly what he does.
“Don’t ask questions, just walk.”
John pressed a chaste kiss to Sherlock’s lips then went to pull out, but he felt his stomach fall through the floor when he caught sight of a red liquid.
“Please. It’s the least I can do.”
Even now, he’s eyes are laughing, laughing as he falls to the floor.
What is happening to me?
Sherlock did as he was told, and allowed John to push the pillow underneath him. He shuffled about to get comfortable, then lay still while John sorted out the lube. He squeezed a generous amount of it on to his hands, then after a nod from Sherlock, gingerly applied it to the brunette’s hole. Sherlock gasped, and tipped his head back. He sat back up after a moment, and watched intently as John coated his cock with the gel like fluid. The blond inhaled deeply, and moaned quietly as he breathed out. Once he’d sorted himself out, he settled himself in between Sherlock’s butterfly spread legs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, miss.” He said, his voice was reassuring, but the next words out of his mouth were anything but. “It’s for next door.”
He pulled Sherlock closer, and the pair settled down to watch the film, a perfect end to the perfect night.
“That was a really good game, I thought you were really- why are you looking at me like that?”
Sherlock hid his face in johns neck as they paid at the till. This was often his manner, regardless of whether they were buying cock rings or condoms. John always found this amusing because as soon as they got home, Sherlock would be on his knees, begging for the blond’s cock without shame. John grinned to himself as he looked at the boy nuzzled up to his shoulder as he waited for the cashier to ring up the bill. Shy in the streets, freak in the sheets indeed.
“Yes.” I say, gladly excepting his handshake.
Me: you love me anyway.
He nods to himself before looking down between us.
I pull back with wide eyes.
“Yeah. You want some?”
Sherlock wasn’t sure what was falling from his mouth by this point. He just knew that he needed John to fuck him, and what he said to get him to just that didn’t matter. Another finger had his toes curl. He cried out at the loss of contact when John pulled fingers out. He turned his head to see what John was doing, and caught sight of him lubing up his thick, lengthy cock. It was flushed with blood, stiff and pulsing. Sherlock felt his mouth watering and his own cock throb.
Sherlock gets bored at brunch.
The bell rang, and Sherlock was already on his feet, and leaving the room before molly could ask him about tomorrow. First lunch, then English, and finally Chemistry. He liked that. Not only the subject was enjoyable, but he was rather fond of his teacher, Mr Lestrard. He was a tall chap in his early 20s, and had endless patience for Sherlock’s bullshit, even though he knew the teen thought he was smarter than him, and regularly tried to prove this. He found himself an empty table in the corner, and quietly sipped on his milk. He felt someone walking up behind him, and started coming up with a nice way to tell molly to go away. He was surprised when instead of molly, stood a dark haired boy of average height, a pair of spectacles balances on the end of his nose, and a blazer that really didn’t fit him. Mike Stamford.
Shit. Shit, it’s everywhere. Thank god there’s cleaning products in here.
“Thats good.”
“I see you boys have eaten.” Mrs Watson said, looking at the plates on the coffee table.
She quickly ran up the stairs before John could start a conversation with her. She dressed quickly in a skirt and blouse, then went back downstairs. Mr Holmes and Mr Watson were in the former’s study, no doubt drinking scotch, Mrs Holmes and Mrs Watson were chatting about crochet patterns in the parlour, Mycroft and Harriet were quietly nursing their hangovers in the corner of the room, and John was sat on his own by the fireplace. Sherlock made the brave decision to sit next to him in the other armchair.
“This is the best idea we’ve ever had!” John exclaimed as he jumped off the bottom step.
“John...” He says simply as he drops his head down on to my shoulder.
John and Sherlock spend the day together, and have some quality bonding time.
John comes home.
-Love John x
“Fuuucck...”
“My apologies.” John chuckled. “My love, would you do me the honour of accompanying me to the pictures this fine evening?”
I hadn’t noticed that my eyes had shut until I feel Johns lips on my closed eyelids.
“Yes.”
“Oh my god.” He finally panted out, his chest heaving.
3rd of November 1910
“Yes! Yes! Yes! Don’t stop! YES! YES! OH FUCK! YES, JOHN! AH! AH! AH! AHH!” Sherlock screamed as he came hard all over his thighs and the bedspread.
Sherlock breathed a sigh as she watched her son till he disappeared from sight.
“Nothing, Nothing.”
Sorry for the late update, and the sucky summary. Hope you enjoy!
John’s at the foot of my bed.
Sherlock pondered this for a moment. He didn’t mind mike. He was a nerd, and got bullied because of it, like Sherlock. He was interesting to talk to, and was by no means Stupid. He was also one of the only kids who tolerated Sherlock.
Sherlock was rather stunned as they kissed, his alcohol addled brain taking a minute to catch up.
“You idiot. Why did you do this anyway?”
She couldn’t hide it anymore. She had told her mother a few weeks ago. It went as well as expected.
“Good morning Sherlock.”
This time, John brought his lips down to her neck.
“Sweetie, how does that sound to you?” John asked, bumping Sherlock with his head.
Sherlock’s heart was pounding so hard and fast under johns cheek where his head was resting on her clavicle.
“Ok. I now own lingerie. Interesting.”
“John?” Sherlock called after a moment.
But he didn’t have a say this time.
John turned to face the brunette, a look of worry on his face.
He pauses for a moment.
He knew sherlock’s body almost as well as he knew his own by now, and he knew what he needed.
I mutter, and drop my head, my curls hanging over my eyes.
“I’m worried about your sister.”
Sorry this took so long... enjoy! Credit to Bloo1717 for the prompt at the end.
Rosie shot him a knowing smirk.
The baby was due in less than a month and Sherlock had driven herself insane.
13th of November 1918
I enter the room, and spot my brother sat at the middle table.
“Are you going to punish me?” Sherlock teased as he drew johns earlobe in to his mouth.
We hold hands for a moment, then John steps out the door.
He still hasn’t let go of my arm, and he’s now using it to steer me down the corridor.
“Yeah, ok.”
Mycorft has sent me more books, but even those are doing very little to keep me occupied.
I feel John’s length spasm before spurts of hot, salty, bitter liquid is gushing down my throat.
“Can I at least go round you...?”
“Don’t talk to me like that John.”
Sherlock did as he was told, and watched as John coated and sheathed his throbbing cock.
Sherlock giggled against johns lips as he pulled him for another kiss.
My breathing is heavily laboured, restricting my ability to speak coherently, so instead I go with the symbolic ‘thumbs up’ gesture that seems to reassure him.
Oh, I am a horrible person.
Thank you so much for reading, for leaving comments and kudos... just thanks :)
He seems satisfied, and simply reaches for my hand, squeezing it between his.
“Yes.”
“Why didn’t you say that in the first place then?”
“I guess.”
Sherlock.
She eyed him for a moment before taking another inhale. She didn’t cough this time, and instead let the smoke envelope her insides.
“Wait...” He said after taking in particular features of it.
“Yes. Your rucksack. It’s rather beaten down. Your clothes on the other hand are perfectly laundered, your shoes are barely scuffed, and your text books are in immaculate condition. You’re careful with your possessions. But the rucksack. It’s got holes that have been re-sewn, and it’s faded. It also has the name ‘Harry Watson’ written on the inside. Second child, lots of hand me downs. Age gap is big enough that your brother no longer needs the rucksack for school. I’m guessing you don’t get along with your brother from the tone you adopted when I asked about him. Probably favourite child. It is a very nice rucksack, just like the MP3player you had earlier, also a hand me down, who’s costs most likely outright that of the phone in your back pocket. You’re jealous. Obviously.”
With shaking fingers, I manage to undo the rest of his buttons, leaving his toned chest completely bare.
“Fuck.” He said simply.
“You look really confused.” John smirked.
“Ok.”
Molly grinned at him, then disappeared down the hall.
“Yes.” Sherlock groaned, rocking his pelvis forwards.
“Right, see you lot later.”
“Yes.”
“I don’t know if I can, officer... I’m very loud.”
She peaked her head out to look at who was at the now opened door.
His fingers are slow and steady as he kisses my cheek, and whispers reassuring words of love.
They both turned their heads to see Irene and molly stood in the door way. Irene had a massive parcel in her hands, and molly was holding about a thousand books.
John relaxed a little, and even a small smile tugged at his lips.
I grin at his confidence, and suddenly feel all giddy when I think about how his confidence is not misplaced.
“Ohhhhmnnghh...” I groan as I sink down so I’m fully seated on his cock.
Mycroft stuck his tongue out at his brother when he heard him giggling. Sherlock also stuck out his tongue in retaliation.
“Make you cry out in pleasure.”
Desperate to get Sherlock to reach completion too, John sped up his ministrations.
Well, it didn’t exactly just happen, it was yesterday, but I’m still in disbelief about it.
“Mmmm...” Sherlock hummed happily, lifting his hips to grind against John’s.
He bucked his hips forcefully, rattling the head board as his cock became fully immersed in Sherlock’s channel.
Sherlock sighed softly when he felt John press their lips together.
“Yeah.” He murmured.
I grimace and wipe the taste on my sleeve.
“We’d better be off home then.” Sherlock beamed as she squeezed John’s arm.
I can almost hear him counting to three inside his own head before he snaps his hips forward, and pushes inside me.
“Why me?”
“We have to stop at his house before hand. He hasn’t got his school bag.” Sherlock quipped from the other side of the room where he was poking around in the fridge.
John was grinning from ear to ear as he answered.
I don’t actually care, but I can’t just flat out start a normal conversation with him. Yet.
His voice has a ruff, deep quality to it, and it has me quaking where I stand.
“Can I take this off?” John asked, pulling at Sherlock’s shirt.
“How long have you got?” I venture, praying it’s not too long.
“Oh come on, you’re never getting a bird like that.” Roberts teased, affectionately ruffling the younger boy’s hair.
I feel my already rock hard cock throb painfully between my legs, even more so when I catch Sherlock’s eyes go directly to it.
“Yes. Why?”
“Actually, Mr Holmes, a moment please.”
John said casually before getting to his feet, leaving a whining Sherlock behind. Although he was desperate to get back to Sherlock, the idea of having him sat there, a horny mess, not allowed to cum, was worth the wait. He took his sweet time, actively trying to piss about. He paused to have a drink, and even took the time to water the plants. Sherlock was probably going insane by this point. John finally snapped, too turned on to loiter in the kitchen anymore. He walked over to the freezer, and retrieved the frozen cubes of lube he’d set last night. He’d read about it on the internet, and he couldn’t wait to try it on Sherlock. He was only grateful it wasn’t summer, and no one had accidentally used them as actual ice cubes. He had no idea how he was going to explain that one. He wandered back in to the bedroom, and smirked at the sight before him. Sherlock was sat on the bed, legs spread wide, bottle of lube cast aside, fingers buried deep inside himself. His eyes were screwed shut, teeth gritted, short, strangled moans escaping him. John could tell he was close. He was so focused on pleasuring himself he didn’t even notice john was in the room. John almost didn’t want to announce his presence, quite content just observing the arousing display before him. He watched with hungry eyes as his cock throbbed desperately.
“Yeah, we are. We can move back in our third year, but I think we might stay where we are.”
She gleefully followed John up the steps to his house, and into the parlour. The maid brought them each a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits.
“Make sure you wear a coat.”
“I’m so fucking stupid. So fucking... stupid... I... I can’t... I’m... I just... if I hadn’t... what if...”
Sherlock returned the smile, little dimples appearing in his cheeks.
“Congratulations first Lieutenant Watson.”
“Still in pain, but it’s not so bad now. I don’t think I’m bleeding again.”
“Oh... why...” Sherlock groaned as she reached in to the cot beside her.
“Fuck.” Johns sighed as he sat back on the bed. “Well, at least it wasn’t your shampoo.”
Holmes.
“Yes, Yes there are. Just got here. Now, be nice, you.” He grins.
John slipped his hand down the front of his trousers, and squeezed him through his underwear.
I can’t help but gasp at is lewd suggestion, nay request, my eyes wide and blinking.
“How are you feeling?”
Oh for fucks sake...
“Brought you some soup. Wasn’t sure if you’d eaten.”
The big hand on the clock finally moves round to join up with the small hand over the number 12.
“And you. I’ll try and come to see you at the weekend, ok?”
“Fuck...” John mumbled as he rolled off the pale teen.
“Mine?” He giggled. “My parents are out.”
John chuckled as Sherlock sunk back on his lap, hand to his brow.
“Yes, yes hard. Hard and fast...”
21st of January 1907
“Sherlock!”
“Hey.”
Sherlock dunked his head under the water for a moment, his dark locks pooling at the top of the surface like a cloud of smoke. When he came back up, his fringe was dropping over his eyes. He huffed at the offending prices of hair, but to now avail.
For the majority of my life, well, all of my life sans yesterday, I’ve never had that carnal desire. Of course I’ve felt aroused just like nearly every other human being, and I do enjoy the rush of endorphins I receive upon reaching orgasm, but that primal lust... that hunger for another person... that really is something else.
“She doesn’t know that.”
"How did you like it?"
“Couldn’t they just find you another partner?” Mike queried after a moment.
Did it seem like there was something between them? Were other people seeing something?
“Why did all three of them go?” Sherlock asked as he filled the kettle up.
“Of course you can, sweetheart. John?”
“Yes please.”
“This is... Oh...”
“Yes.” John chuckled.
“No idea... Johnny?”
John followed Sherlock into the bathroom, where he hoped the sound of the shower would drown out Sherlock’s screams of pleasure.
Hope you guys enjoyed.
Three hours later, the final class before break, and Sherlock was sat on the floor of the sports hall, waiting for the game of dodge ball from which he’d been eliminated to finish. He hated being in here. Everyone was an absolute meat head. They were always meatheads, but the locker room atmosphere made it worse. The P.E. teacher also added to his hatred. He was the epitome of creepy, the typical cliche of P.E. teachers, where you’re not sure if they want to eat you or fuck you. Sherlock knew exactly what this teacher wanted to do to him, and it terrified him.
I have ruined so many bedsheets by now. My laundry is getting ridiculous, and I’m pretty sure my search engine wants to drown itself in bleach.
Sherlock darted his tongue out to swipe it across John’s slit, lavishly licking at the beads of pre-cum at the tip.
"Ah. Did one of those myself."
Kate smiled kindly at the bouncy child who had settled herself on the ottoman by the fireplace.
Despite being ever the cynic, hearing John being so optimistic, talking about the future, talking about coming home... it made it easier...
Sherlock quickened his pace, swirling his tongue, swallowing around the head, lightly grazing  the skin with his teeth.
John drew his bottom lip in between his teeth.
He furrows his brows, and looks at me in confusion, his cerulean eyes darting about my face as he tries to read my expression.
“That’s not for my sister, is it?” She asked cautiously.
John felt his insides churning as Mycroft spoke.
“Come here.”
“Anymore classes today?” She asked, taking a seat in the armchair opposite.
Right, hug him.
God mummy hates that we are both slaves to the murderous, filthy habit.
I don’t say anything in case the tears that are welling behind my eyes break through my walls, and come flooding out.
The blond merely shrugged.
This is almost like the calm before the storm, before he fucks me in to the cushions...
“Yes. Stay.”
“Obviously there’s a problem, or you wouldn’t be here... and I’m assuming Holmes is the source. Not that you’re a problem, Holmes, I just meant that-“ She cuts herself off, and pulls a face as she berates herself. She always has been a babbler.
Next he tried an orange dress.
"Yes."
“Mr Watson! Mr Watson!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll just text my mum. We can swing by there later so I can grab some things. I’m not wearing your pyjamas again. I looked like an absolute prat.” John grinned as he typed away on his phone.
John’s arms gave out, and both he and Sherlock collapsed on to the mattress.
Mycroft offers me a friendly nod.
She remained curled up in the bed with her face hidden.
John crouched down on the floor by Sherlock’s head.
The figure had a deep, mellifluous voice, one that sent shivers down John’s spine. He, cos it was definitely a man, slipped out from the shadows. He was tall, much taller than John, (although most people were.) with wavy, sandy brown hair, a dark stare, and a sharp nose. He was dressed in the same school uniform as John, but was a few years older, and was holding a black umbrella. He looked positively terrifying.
“Hi.” Sherlock giggled as John pressed a kiss to his forehead.
“Here, find something to watch.” I say as I hand him the remote.
John smiled, and turned back to sit with his mum. Sherlock watched him as she munched at the biscuit, focusing on his smile, and the little dimples that formed in his cheeks. They left about an hour later with promises of dinner some time next week. Sherlock was excited, but she knew the hours would feel like days, and the days would feel like weeks.
John dipped his head, and blew cold air on to the wet patch.
Her heart was beating a mile a minute as he spoke.
“Obtaining sex? It’s a miracle you ‘obtain’ any when you put it like that.”
“Oh, god... John...”
Sherlock couldn’t hold off any longer, the cord pulling tighter, tighter tight-
“Not really a fair comparison is it? Nympho over here has no standards.” Rosie said, the time she found Irene tying a girl to a table in mind.
Thank you guys so much for the comments! So glad you enjoyed!
“Alright, bruiser, calm down. I didn’t mean anything by it.”
“Class ended five minutes ago.”
“Sherlock, pass me the jam please.”
Sherlock glanced between the dress and her sister’s face, clearly surprised. Mycroft rolled her eyes, and held the dress out to the younger girl.
John hadn’t realised in his thralls of pleasure, but he had been bucking his hips, forcing his cock down Sherlock’s throat, his grip on his dark curls preventing him from moving. Sherlock hollowed his cheeks as best he could, and swallowed around johns cock.
“Alright. It’s not.” Sherlock places his hand on johns shoulder. “But it is what it is.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock watched as John left, a deep blush on his cheeks.
I give a few more thrusts, making him whimper in his overstimulated state.
He looks so cute and peaceful, I don’t want to wake him.
Sherlock jumped up from his seat, startling John, and made a break for it.
The ambulance arrived a minute or two later, and paramedics were sent up to get Harry. Mrs Watson went in the ambulance, and the two boys were escorted in a paramedic car that followed behind. The staff suggested Sherlock went home, but he’d insisted on going too. John looked relieved at this, and clearly appreciated the act. They’d been sat in a waiting room for nearly an hour. John hadn’t said anything since they’d got there. Mrs Watson had been taken aside by the hospital staff in an attempt to treat her shock, then taken to wherever Harry was. Sherlock wasn’t sure how he was meant to help, but he knew if he didn’t say anything, he couldn’t make things any worse.
“I’m a doctor. I can go where I please without question. Maybe I came to talk to someone. No one needs to know I wasn’t.”
“No, I mean why are you here now? I thought you were going to John’s.” He said through gritted teeth.
Both boys laughed at this, and it dawned on mike that he was the gooseberry. He hadn’t intended on playing matchmaker, but he couldn’t help but smile at the scene playing out before him.
And for the first time in over three years, Sherlock leant in, and connected their lips in a kiss. Johns lips were warm, chapped, but still soft, and exactly how she remembered. She broke away for breath, and pressed her forehead against his.
It took all of John’s self control not to pounce on Sherlock, and fuck him in to the mattress then and there. The only thing that kept him grounded was the reminder that if he played with Sherlock first, it would be a lot more fun. He leant in closer to the brunette, and tightened his grip on his jaw.
John sat himself down next to Sherlock, and peered over at the newspaper. The page was about the murder of a teacher, and Sherlock was staring intently at the picture.
“It’s not like that.” John snapped, taking the photo back.
“That guard on the way in.” He tilts his head in Johns direction... “you’re wearing his aftershave.”
He swallows audibly and his demeanour noticeably changes.
John grinned up at Sherlock as he moved to squirt more on to his pale abdomen.
“Oh fuck, right there-“ he groans with a roll of his hips.
“I’ve missed you too.”
"Under my plate. See, I've finished. You on the other hand haven't moved in about ten minutes." John quipped, gesturing to Sherlock's plate, waffles untouched.
John mouthed at the bud, hard under his touch. He trailed kisses all the way down Sherlock’s lean torso, pausing to bite and suck along the way.
He looks up with his bottom lip drawn in between his teeth a bashful look of demure in his eyes.
“What?”
Fuck, I’m so hard.
"Of course. She's upstairs. I'll take you up. Mother, Mrs Watson said she'd be by soon. Best for you to entertain her rather than myself."
She was warm, and deliciously wet, her walls enveloping him in the most intense sensation he had ever felt.
Sherlock looked at him through his dark lashes, and hollowed his cheeks.
“Sherlock!” John howled as fire pooled in his abdomen, and he dissolved in pleasure, shooting his load.
John’s POV
“Have you... thought a lot about this then?”
“Sherlock!”
“I know, and I’m sorry. I’ve never been good with goodbyes. Besides, you looked so peaceful.”
Sorry this took so ling and that it’s kinda brief... hope you enjoy!
Johns lips spread into a grin.
God, his erection is rubbing between my thighs, and fucking hell its getting me so wet for him, the tip of my cock leaking pre-cum at an alarming rate.
“But no one knows we’re here... my next shift doesn’t start for another four hours.”
“Anyway... Night, babe.
“Mum, what’s happened?”
My voice is breathless and demure as I move my lips down to his neck.
“So beautiful. You’re so beautiful.”
“That worked rather well, didn’t it sweetheart?”
She moaned his name softly, briefly parting their lips.
She hesitated for a moment before asking her question.
“Does that sound alright to you, sherl?” John asked, refraining from using another, more intimate pet name for her in her motjer’ presence.
“Well, brother dearest, that is quite a pickle.”
“I think we should listen to it again. You know, to have a further understanding of it.”
“Ye- Agh!”
Everything he’s ever done to me... god... it’s like I can feel all of it right now in this moment.
I am sure that, like myself, you are grateful for the whether change?
“Actually... I bought you a little something.”
“Mrs Watson, this is Anne Holmes, she lives next door.”
I can smell his toothpaste on his breath.
“Please.”
He strokes my hair, leans in close, and says...
“That would imply he has sexual urges. Robots don’t have urges.” Anderson quips.
"You know how?"
He was rock hard, but his own needs had been pushed right to the bottom of his priorities, mush more enthused about Sherlock’s pleasure.
“Hey, look at me.” John growled when he noticed Sherlock’s blissful state.
Sherlock had sat by her window all morning waiting. Waiting for John.
"She's not."
“I could stay like this all day.” John sighed, pressing a kiss in to Sherlock’s curls.
“Once I have underwear on, yeah, sure.”
School was the same as always, the embarrassment of PE, fending off Molly in biology, and staring holes in the back of Rosie’s head in French. A new thing he found himself doing was spending morning break in the bathroom, crying his soul out in an empty toilet stall. At the end of the day, John had a phone call from his mother telling him to come home. He’d gone home with Sherlock to pick up some stuff, thanked Mrs Holmes, then trudged home. Sherlock sulked in his room, and refused to come down to eat his dinner. The plate of food his mother sent up was promptly thrown down the toilet. The next day, Sherlock overslept, and had to be driven to school. His mother knew his mood had something to do with John, but she daren’t ask. He’d sat with John during lunch, but as always, Rosie was there too. John had declined Sherlock’s offer of going to see a film, and had said he was going to spend time with Rosie. Sherlock had excused himself to cry in the bathroom, and hadn’t made it back before next class. It was unknown to him that John had panicked, and asked Rosie to hang out. Why did he think of Sherlock all the time? He wasn’t gay. He wasn’t. At least that was what he told himself. He felt like punching himself in the face when he saw the look on Sherlock’s after he declined his offer. He’d gone to a cafe with Rosie, where he found himself thinking, slash worrying about Sherlock the entire time.
