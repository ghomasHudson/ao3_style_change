“And you had a pretty little wife”
It really shouldn’t look so fucking sexy, John thought, as the urge to roughly shove Sherlock back down on the bed overwhelmed him, to mess up those curls a bit more and slide his hands down the back of those open jeans….
The last statement came out as more of a question, as Sherlock found it hard to believe anyone would be foolish enough to take him home to meet (and probably repel) their entire family. The odds against a successful trip were stacked high against them from the outset. But god, now the idea was in his head he felt almost giddy with it.
‘No, no, I am well…let us just stay still awhile, it is strange, that is all’
“Earphones Greg” Sherlock said, just before he slammed it shut.
Fucking hell, he felt light-headed and his temples pulsed with a dull aching pain, the beginnings of a hangover, and then some. How easy it had been to forget this part, all the bad shit, the crash as he came down fast. Only a few short months ago he would have been chasing another couple of lines right now, up all night dancing and crawl home around dawn, but all he wanted tonight was sleep and John, neither of which he was going to get.
“Sherlock dear….” Mrs Hudson stuttered meekly from her place by the kitchen door, I hate to ask my love but have you found anyone to share the flat yet?”
Mycroft squeezed his eyes closed for a moment. He had hoped to avoid this conversation a little longer, savour this precious time together. Alas, it was not to be.
The filthy mental images, ejaculating into Sherlock’s willing mouth pushed him closer to the edge, too soon, not yet, he bit his lip, hard. Sherlock could sense the tension building in John’s body and pulled away, letting his cock slide from his mouth with an obscene pop.
“There ya go Shezza…a seven per cent solution should do ya, just to keep things tickin over”.
“Oh aye…before I…before we…before”, he floundered and I cursed my wandering mind and tongue, and did not press him further. We all had a past, a life we were running from or were desperate to find a way back to.
He was jolted out of his growing ennui by John, shaking him by the shoulder and making the floor pitch wildly again. He blurted out his choice.
“I used to do this a lot you know John, every weekend, it was one of the reasons I was expelled from my last school” they strolled towards a promising looking pub, not too busy, room at the bar, half-decent music pumping in muffled bursts every time the door opened and closed.
“Behave then squirt…I’m just going to talk to Molls for a bit…have fun”, and the he was gone, bouncing over to the other side of the room to talk to Molly Hooper who had just wandered in.
“How kind of you to say so, not looking so hot yourself Victor, red really isn’t your colour”
But Sherlock didn’t emerge from the dorm room all evening, and when John climbed the stairs at half past twelve, only the top of a dark, curly head was visible under the blankets.
are you talking about?”.
He placed a folded towel on the floor at his feet and dropped to his knees, positioned at the side of the indented hollow meant for soap, and drew out the small plastic packet, tapping a little powder on to the sink top before stuffing what remained back out of sight, he might need it for later after all.
He stepped outside, soft shoes sinking into the virgin snow, with absolutely no idea what to do about this mess or where to go.
“I thought we were heading back?” John asked as he sat down beside him anyway. Sherlock pulled his coat around himself, aware of the creeping cold and damp, but no longer caring.
He swallowed thickly and took another long pull on his bottle of water, wishing it was something stronger.
The driver got down to hand her into the carriage and they clambered up behind, sharing the seat opposite her. The drive back was wonderful, every jolt and sway pressed him up against John’s shoulder and leg. Sherlock bit his lip and looked out of the window to hide his blushing face with no idea why this felt as good as it did.
It was almost impersonal in its stark appearance. It could have belonged to anyone, so unnaturally neat and tidy, the football posters above the bed hung so straight he must have used a spirit level, books in neat order on a shelf by the desk, but nothing overtly personal, nothing to tell you this space belonged to John Watson. It was obvious why, well to Sherlock anyway. John had switched off when his dad had died, emotionally, apart from the visceral anger that would surface from time to time he’d detached himself, no longer sure what he should do or who he was, scared and confused that he didn’t fit in anymore.
“Well in that case, I reckon Sherlock should steal you away from that other lot more often then. Do you know Sherlock,” John’s dad swung around to face Sherlock instead, “he’s an absolute bloody nightmare the day after a Friday night out. Sits wrapped up in a duvet on the sofa all day, whinging about his head and eating crap, worse than Harry when she’s on her….”
Sherlock gave a sigh and placed a hand on his arm, bringing them both to an abrupt halt “It’s the end of term tomorrow…that’s why not, you’ll go home and I’ll be here for two weeks, back to square one”
“No, I don’t think you deserve that yet Sherlock…do you?”
“We are, I thought we could have a spot of tea first though, I’m thirsty and it would be such a shame to let it go to waste, especially after you went to all that effort to look after me”
“You didn’t work that out, Greg must have told you”
“Yes…yes, just…wait there…just wait”
So here they both were after that impossible choice, literally caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.
Damn. Whenever he thought he had the upper hand, Sherlock always managed to swing it back round.
They walked down the rest of Baker Street twenty minutes later, a plastic bag emitting delicious aromas into the night air as it swung from John’s arm. His stomach growled loudly, Sherlock’s joining in the chorus. They reached the large black door of 221B and stood in silence, hesitant now at this late hour.
“You came early”, said John, popping his head round the bathroom door and releasing a cloud of steam, “and I told you the train was at twelve so you could’ve had a bit extra kip”.
He deserved it, for that moment of weakness in the early hours when he should have been strong, deleted that damn message from the ghost of his past, when the scent of John was still on his skin and his come up his arse for fuck’s sake, but the urge to see Victor one last time had proved too strong, a mistake, a terrible mistake.
Harry waggled her eyebrows at him suggestively as she popped a tube of Pringles and began stuffing them, into her mouth.
“Oh, right, um, if you take the ten sixty-eight towards Farnham, about two miles on you’ll see a turn-off, left. It’s says private road, but just ignore that, its fine.”
A cold blast of air accompanied a sudden, and distinct absence of duvet.
Sherlock’s eyes flashed dangerously for half a beat, mostly green today Mycroft noted, which was always particularly telling regarding Sherlock’s current mental state. He must remind Greg to take extra care this evening.
The soft brush of lips felt like heaven as John closed the remaining gap and pressed his body flush against him too. Sherlock gasped, fucking hell, he could feel every inch of what was hidden inside those red pants.
“Its fine, and yes, I’m sure.” Sherlock choked out the words, swallowing past the lump in his throat. His hair was a tangled mess anyway and after two hours sweating in the studio and then stuffed underneath a woollen hat outside, the damage was long since done. Feeling self-conscious, nonetheless, he turned his back first, dragged off the beanie and stuffed down it as far as it would go in his pocket. He pulled the helmet on. It was a snug fit which pressed into his temples like a vice.
John sat down in front of me rather than at my side, and slid a tankard of ale across the table, a thin scummy line of foam floating on the surface of the pale amber liquid. Thank god it tasted better than it looked, soothing the roughness in my throat and slaking the raging thirst that one always felt after excessive consumption of alcohol. Or so I had been reliably informed.
Sherlock flipped his collar up against the bitter, biting wind, eyes screwed almost shut to keep out the icy snowflakes as he directed his footsteps back towards the main street in town. Home was not an option tonight. ‘That’s it’ his father had said ‘I won’t have you upsetting your mother anymore, how dare you bring drugs into this house, and the fighting Sherlock…if this is the lifestyle you choose after all we have given you then…’ He hadn’t waited to hear the end of that sentence, that was enough. But he had to see John, like a compulsion, since the day they had met John had been his anchor, his safe place, but somehow he just couldn’t bring himself to admit to him what a mess he had made of everything. And it was getting too hard to be around him when all he wanted to do was lie on top of him and kiss him and do various other things if John would let him.
“If you must”.
John grunted, determined not to be drawn in, so they walked on in silence instead, until Walter came to a halt right next to a black granite headstone, no more than ten years old. It was smaller than the one that Sherlock had had, after ‘the fall’, but even so his heart skipped a beat just at the thought. Sherlock’s headstone had been removed a while back of course, before it could be turned into some sort of macabre shrine by the more unsavoury factions of his fan club.
Greg did nothing to mask the look of surprise on his face. This was another thing to add to Sherlock’s ever growing catalogue of petty crime, and there was only so much he could do to keep him out of the system. Mycroft would pull every string he could, but in the end would that actually do a damn thing to reign Sherlock in?
Muffled moans, panting hard into each other’s mouths and face and hair, grinding and rocking together, abdomens damp and sticky. John sucked hard at a patch of exposed skin as Sherlock arched his head back, crying out, fisting handfuls of ash blond hair and pulling until John felt his eyes begin to water. Sherlock pulled him up to claim his mouth again, licking and nibbling along John’s lower lip, he caught it delicately between his teeth, pulling and biting as John reached around to pull one of Sherlock’s long legs around his waist, running his palm over the his arse cheek and ghosting a finger along the crack, skimming over his entrance.
“Brave words from the oik who thought he could just help himself to the contents of my pocket” the boy sneered back completely unimpressed, twisting John around until they were face to face.
They did not venture to converse with us further following this most perplexing outburst, the rest of the journey continuing in silence and intermittent slumber.
One gift. Not two.
Indeed it had been several months since last had seen him and although he seemed unchanged I knew that I had altered irrevocably.
John Watson sweated like a beast, through equal parts exertion and pain, trapped beneath a less than fragrant duvet. No one could say it wasn’t a valiant performance on his behalf, or that John was not an extremely considerate lover. At least he hoped that was the case. Except he couldn’t quite remember the name of the lady in question. And that was pretty bad form. A basic requirement. Was it Andrea? Angela? Sandra, maybe?
lap likewise”.
“Merry fucking Christmas Sherlock”
John was gone half the day, returning as the lamp-lighters began to make their rounds, room bathed in a strange half-light as I had yet to rise and light the candles, for it was something we had always done together. I was filled with a grinding impatience, as the passage of time had done little to ease the uncertainty and fear that had made a place inside me. But all was dispelled at the sight of his face as he burst into the room and caught me up in a most tight embrace, laughing joyfully. Any reproach for his long absence died upon my lips as he kissed away the last remaining shreds of doubt.
“A Harris Hawk…larger, dark feathers, neither are nocturnal, but I just picked what seemed to fit us”
Sherlock, as it so happened, was feeling very much like a dead man, currently pinned to the wall of an alley, a few buildings down from the pub, by a strong well-muscled arm across his chest.
“Don’t you fucking dare pull out” John growled “Just do something…start fucking me for god’s sake…I’m not going to fucking cry Sherlock…just move”
If any of these self-deprecating thoughts showed on his face Mike gave no indication that they had as he clapped him on the shoulder with a beefy hand. He went to Uni with John, the same year group, same course, and they travelled and even boarded together during term-time. Sherlock envied him that, so much time in John’s company, and wondered if Mike realised how little he deserved the privilege. But at least he was reasonably tolerable and didn’t take the piss too much, so Sherlock was willing to put his envy aside and at least fake a semblance of friendliness.
“Yeah, good idea Greg, I’ll run it by him tonight”
“Are you the one that cheated? No…I didn’t think so”, she went on defiantly, ignoring John’s frustrated look. Sherlock was mildly impressed by her balls, but she was missing one vital piece of information, he’d grown up with Mycroft Holmes and a little intimidation was never going to work on him.
Ah, the infamous stag night, their last big hurrah, when he had puked all over a crime scene and spent a less than comfortable night in a cell (at least they were close at hand here tonight, should anything go wrong, and with their track record, he couldn’t exactly rule it out)
Sherlock clenched his teeth until his jaw hurt. His face felt hot and his eyes stung. This was unacceptable, this was completely and utterly awful – a disaster. This wasn’t supposed to happen to him.
The reason for her softening praise soon became clear. Tom was to help me dress, ‘tricking me out for the market’ if you will, for a gentleman had come that very day eager to make my acquaintance, a very fine gentleman I was told before whom my charms were to pass for his consideration. In truth, he had insisted on a previous sight of this good house to determine if such a place as this could be diligent in the keeping of a valuable commodity such as I, and that satisfied, I was to be brought before him with all haste lest another become aware of my existence.
Whatever had passed today was not yet done.
I in no way advocate the photocopying of random body parts!
“Well, let’s just say I’m familiar with the method”
“But there are people out there who really do want to hurt you Sherlock, you must be getting to close to the truth, I would say….this…what they did to me…it’s a message…to back off and stay out of their way”
Sherlock must have been half frozen by now in his thin clothes, John thought, crowding in close to share a little body heat while he fumbled in the lock with his key, almost touching, but not quite.
He pulled John down for a messy kiss, the back of his thighs burning with the strain of the position, unfamiliar now.
“What say you take a little pinch honey”
This arrested John’s attention back to me, I was pleased to find, and he leant in closer, the brush of his leg against mine beneath the table causing my skin to burst afire. I supped anew to quell the dryness in my throat.
“Point taken I guess…well put Sherlock”
“Sherlock!” he rose and came towards me, and it was then that I noticed the other occupants of the room, as well as Mr Oxley, Oliver and Tom, there was Sarah in a pretty rose-pink dress, our good friend Charles and tall, thin man in plain black robes and gold-framed pince-nez.
“It’s Tuesday, so yeah, probably”
The faint buzz of life from outside immediately cut out, the room was bathed in silence, Mycroft sucking in air through his nose, jaw clenched before he turned to snap at him.
“Oh god you’re so fucking perfect” John groaned “get on your knees and spread”
“John”
And so it had been for all the time we had been together, as the days had turned swiftly to weeks and months, and the cool chill of late winter gave way to the promise of warm summer days. My happiness only grew through this time, long hours spent in each other’s company doing little to dampen our desire or mutual regard for one another with as many hours spent laid down all sticky and sweat-slick, as ever was spent in the company of others.
“What on earth do you mean? I have no time for cryptic mind games, either explain who you are and why you are following me or just go”
“Ah…I see” (well, he didn’t see actually, but he wasn’t about to let John know that, the whole ‘girl’ thing not really being his area, so to speak…)But it hadn’t gone well, he assumed. He couldn’t help feeling just a little bit smug.
(well he hadn’t exactly been discreet so no surprise there)
John heard a sharp intake of breath just as his arse vibrated.
Dr John Watson.
“You will be performing Sherlock, I am not entirely certain that those engaged to perform would be granted a plus one” .
Sherlock knew he was grinning foolishly to himself and he didn’t care who saw. He texted back:
His pulse rate rocketed and he felt light-headed from the heat. The thought of being buried, balls deep in John’s arsehole made his heart pound painfully behind his ribcage, especially, he thought, if those wrists were encased in a pair of police issue handcuffs, attatched to something solid like a bed…or a table leg…(he was sure he could filch some off Greg).
* Warning for potential triggers - see tags*
“Oh god….you’re so fucking wet for me Victor” he stroked long fingertips slowly down his length in wonder as Victor sucked in a shaking breath, feeling the slick slide already, pre-come flowing freely from his slit as Sherlock curled his hand around Victor’s cock and began to pump his fist.
Imagine reader if you will a strapping young man between eighteen and nineteen years with a tousled mass of dusky blond hair shading a face on which the full bloom of youth was painted in rose and gold, untouched by his evenings excess. Beautifully bordered lids were closed in sleep, concealing the azure blue which I knew to be present there, framed by the longest thickest lashes and two perfect arched brows to grace the whole, and lips I could scarce tear my eyes from swollen into a luscious pout as if a bee had lately stung them. I stepped forward and knelt down beside the chair. My eyes traced the smooth white skin of his neck exposed to the air by a shirt collar, unbuttoned, down the steady rise and fall of his chest relaxed in sleep to a hand that rested along the outer edge of his sturdy thigh. I know not why I did it, but my hand reached forward unbidden and gently raised his own to my lips. I kissed that sweet palm, laying it against my cheek with a sigh as I breathed in the warm masculine scent of him, jumping back and falling on my arse on the floor as he stirred, blinking in confusion in the muted dawn light. I blushed as he focused his bleary gaze upon me, suddenly aware of my state of undress, half-naked in undershirt and drawers and shamed at being caught with my hands upon him without his express consent.
“Hope you haven’t just ‘ad yer tea lads, you’ll need a strong stomach for this one” the D.I drew a pair of black-rimmed spectacles from his pocket and rammed them on his nose. It changed his appearance from wily detective to ageing civil servant. The transformation did not instil confidence, making him look old and tired.
‘I beg you to reconsider sir, the lad is not groomed up to it yet’
“I have the biggest fucking hard-on right now…do you?”
Sherlock spat into a tissue and dabbed at the dried, crusty blood on his nose and face. He had just wanked his ex for god’s sake, came here and fucking begged for it, or as good as, and Victor had only been too eager to oblige. If his nose hadn’t bled he would probably have fucked the bastard too, if Victor even took it up the arse that is, Sherlock didn’t even know.
“Come on John, I need a drink” he spun John back around and pushed him towards the sideboard, not caring if he appeared rude, to where trays of white wine stood ready.
Sherlock stomped away from him down the corridor, hood pulled up over his head in an attempt to disguise the cigarette that dangled between his lips. John pushed against the flow of people, every single one of whom, annoyingly, were heading in the opposite direction.
He was just stepping back into the room when he heard a soft tentative tapping at the door and a tousled blond head peered around it cautiously. John had shower damp hair and pink skin from the heat of the water, dressed in a rumpled blue t-shirt and old grey pyjama pants which sat low on his hips. He ruffled a hand through his hair in a slightly nervous gesture and the hem of his shirt lifted to reveal toned creamy abdominals and a smattering of golden hair below his navel. Sherlock simply stared.
The gentleman was not wholly blameless of course, having dealt willingly with a mother who would not baulk to turn a profit from her own flesh and blood, but he is much redeemed in my opinion in his resolve to break all future contact between mother and daughter.
The last thing in the world he felt in the mood for was a night out at the Union bar… it was where they had met that very first night. Sherlock on stage playing that guitar, fingers flying so expertly over the strings, the same fingers that had learned how to expertly take him apart several times since.
You, Sherlock thought, that’s what happened. And too many late nights, too many drugs, and too much fucking around.
“You stupid fucking idiot…Jesus Sherlock”
“Ah you fucking prick”, Victor groaned, realising where this conversation was going, “I might’ve guessed you’d pull last minute…listen, I’ll leave the window open for you just this once and don’t fucking blame me if you get caught…. but text me if you’re not coming back yeah?….”
Who the hell said you can’t always get what you want?
“Like a prisoner who waits for the axe to fall upon his neck…I would have hoped my brother would have found me by now, if he had been able. But there has been nothing. Truly, do you believe he would have left my life to the fates if he had been in a position to prevent it? If Lestrade was dressed in a robe and carried a scythe I would think nothing of it”.
“So”, John ventured, his brother may yet live?”
“Shit. Sorry…I didn’t know….is this your room?”
‘But surely it is I who should protect you’, I protested, much to my companion’s amusement.
Leave them on, he decided, now regarding the towel arrangement with some degree of suspicion.  After a brief moment of indecision he climbed atop the lot and buried his face in the mound of towels at the head of the bed praying he wouldn't suffocate as the door eased open again. A chink of light illuminated the floor of the room, barely enough to see some random spots of oil and dust bunnies. On a shelf which ran the length of the bed below him, more white towels were stacked neatly with a roll of white couch paper wedged in between them.
“It was my mother’s, but you could say it belongs to me now,” Sherlock said with a curve of a smile on his lips. He shyly ducked his head and turned away to hide his face from view, and without checking to see if John bothered to follow, he headed off on still-unsteady legs toward what John guessed should have been the grand front entrance to the
For in truth my tirade was unjust. I had much to be grateful for regarding our mutual friend Charles, an admirable man indeed who had offered to us his loyalty and expertise in making discreet enquiries as to the possible whereabouts of my brother, a service which he rendered pro bono in addition to the service he had lately performed for me.
“Fuck off mate please” he swatted at the small furry form and it trailed away sadly, deprived of its game.
Vic couldn’t move fast enough, he was practically a blur as he bolted into Sherlock’s room, whipping the towel off before he even made it through the door.
“I’m serious mate, really…I wish to hell you’d stop doing shit like this and calm the fuck down”.
“What?...No…I have to get home, I’ll get you seen to, then I’m having dinner with my sister and her new girlfriend (forget the homicidal wife – too much information)”
“So what have you got in your sack for me Santa?”
John moved in close to whisper low and filthy in his ear
“I…oh…ahh…god, John”
He allowed the girls to fuss and preen around him, accepting the offer of cheese and wine while he waited for the lady of the house to come down, sipping nonchalantly while listening with half an ear to the idle gossip around him.
“Yes, have you heard of the ‘Save Soho’ campaign? An admirable attempt to preserve the unique nature and individuality of a much loved area of London”
(Nice one Sherlock and your fucking acid tongue)
“Do you still work for Frank Hudson, or are you dancing to someone elses tune now?”
“You have to hold my head still and pound into me until I start to choke, until my eyes water and drool runs down my chin, and I just kneel there and take it, would you like that John?”
John watched in growing envy as he stood behind Sherlock who had paused in the centre of the room, practically manhandling him, pulling Sherlock’s leg back before pushing it up in small increments until positioned to his satisfaction. Sherlock squirmed on the spot, straining to hold the new position while Victor skimmed his hands along the length of his torso and bullied his arms into a more pleasing attitude.
We blinked at each other in confusion. John sat up, alert, and as Sarah opened the door a crack he swung out of bed and padded, bare footed, the short distance to meet her. He plucked the letter from her outstretched hand. “Thank you Sarah, if that will be all,” he said, in a voice little sharper than his usual tone, making it clear he wished her to leave, and leave quickly. His eyes remained fixed on the note in his hand. She dropped a quick curtsey, stealing at glance in my direction, failing to hide the hurt in her eyes to be dismissed in such a fashion. It was not like him. Indeed he did not look well, I thought. The rosy flush to his skin, which I had lately put there had drained from his face, and in its place had left a sickly white pallor. John closed the door and leaned heavily against the frame, and but for his bare feet braced firmly on the wooden boards, he may have slid to the ground he appeared so boneless.
“What?”
His heart began to hammer when he pressed send and a sick feeling spread from his gut and up his chest at just the thought of it, the buzz when it reached him, his face when he saw who it was from.
“What
I could not help but blush a little still, my sole encounters to this date happening under the covers, if you will and beyond the first night when Tom had stripped in front of me I had not laid eyes on another man’s cock.
“For fuck’s sake don’t inhale like that it’s not a bloody cigarette” Sherlock said, snatching it back from his fingers, somewhere between irritated and amused.
“Thirsty, sorry...I sort of worked up a sweat with all that energetic bouncing around, so unless you have a bottle stashed somewhere I’m going to have to nip out and buy some”
Not this time.
Usually.
“Do it hard and fast John” Sherlock whined, ever impatient and demanding.
Sherlock moved again, in obvious disagreement, and no small amount of discomfort going by his expression, and got a smack on the arm and a shove between the shoulder blades for his pains. The blow sent him staggering forward a few paces, and Victor threw his hands up in disgust despite it being clearly his fault, and John’s hand was on the door before he could think to stop himself. He shoved it open roughly, or tried to, wincing as instead, the heavy, tight hinges protested and ruined his dramatic hero entrance. Sherlock and Victor, both whipped their heads around to face him.
“Drink?” John asked, clearly satisfied with his pathetic attempt. He nodded , not really paying attention, just glad to shove the plate to one side, so when the cup was placed in his hand, he took an overly large sip. What looked like a perfectly innocent cup of Coke was more than a little slutty, thanks, no doubt to a generous amount of his own vodka. That was definitely more than two fingers worth.
He didn’t move from his position for the entirety of the set, enjoying the music, and the sight of Sherlock even more so. He was a natural performer, just the right mixture of aloof attitude and sexy swagger. The girls at the front were lapping it up, John noticed. One more song Greg announced, his dark t-shirt clinging to his lean body with a thin sheen of sweat, hair damp and ruffled. Sherlock looked completely poised by comparison, just a few errant curls sticking to his forehead and around his ears.
“Thit, m’thorry”, John lisped, as he levered himself up again on his remaining good arm and discreetly attempted to extract several pubic hairs from the back of his tongue, (as well as his face from a near-strangers nether regions.) He stifled the resultant cough as one caught in the back of his throat anyway, and swallowed thickly. His own interest had blessedly wilted in the both the figurative and literal sense thank god.
“Still feeling confident you would have beaten me anyway?” John leaned in close, making Sherlock’s pulse race, and whispered……
“Oh god …that’s just so fucking wrong….you dirty bastard…”
By the time they pulled apart she had gone.
‘My dear Sherlock, what a brazen tart you are’ he said, shedding his clothes with reckless abandon, all the quicker to lay himself over me. Youth was on our side and the liquor did nothing to dampen the strength of our desire to make love, and so, with care this time John placed a pillow under my hips to raise me up and bid me drape my legs over the top of his shoulders. I couldn’t give a care this time, loose with drink, my stomach shaking with laughter at the comedy that the sight of us must present, that I was to be fucked upon my back like a maid. And then, oh god, the laughter died in my throat at the first sweet push of his cock at my hole. The salve was a miracle, I take back my derision ten-fold, as he slid inside, inch by glorious inch. What pain could stand before a pleasure so transporting? What insupportable delight! We were joined at last, he was buried to the hilt within me holding still with the shock of it, and I pushed back against him to bid him move lest I die, I needed this so much. And so, he ruined me, for how would any other man even hope to compare to this.
“That you had been heading off the rails well before that, you had quite the reputation around town, did you realise?”
“Hit me…you heard John…punch me in the face… you know you want to…you’re barely able to hold yourself back right now, it’s written all over your face, I can see”
John burst into uncontrollable giggles “You’ve actually thought this all through, have you?”
A strange sensation wholly unfamiliar, prickled behind his eyes, hot and tight, as a saline stream pushed tracks through the blood on his face and he blinked rapidly, transfixed by the words on the screen
They took the small carriage this time, just enough room for two. Mycroft would take a cab later that morning to his club before meeting father in Kensington for lunch. Perone trotted through the streets, completely at ease with the press and noise of other horses and bodies around her. Jute would have shied and took fright at the hustle and bustle, not yet accustomed to the constant ebb and flow of city life. It wasn’t fair to have her shut up like that in the stable out back. Sherlock dreamt of thundering over the rolling green hills and through fields of long, swaying grass.
“Stop…just stop…you’re hurting yourself”.
Ha! It must stick in Mycroft’s throat, his failure to intimidate this small, miraculous person.
“If you don’t mind Mycroft I don’t think I want to talk about that”.
Mycroft paused, rubbing at a spot on his lower lip, a sure sign that he had reached the limits of his patience.
He nodded at John who continued, stoic and calm, “The other loser jumped me last weekend on the way home…it was a warning to Sherlock to lay off digging shit up on his boss…we think he might have been involved in massive fight at some club. The owners wife…we were just trying to look out for her, neither of us knew it would turn into a shit-storm”.
“Yes, right after I get us both into a shitload more trouble. I hacked those incident reports from Tuesday night. How do you fancy going to see a couple of strippers today?”
The thought of it really shouldn’t turn him on so much.
“Nothing too onerous, I can assure you, it is proposed that you will perform a short violin recital”
Once more for luck, he sucks in another deep breath, exhales, as ready as he ever will be.
“That says it all really…that he couldn’t do it sober” he said coolly, forcing himself to turn away and lean over the bar to catch the order of the next customer as the rising cacophony of voices made it harder to hear. He deftly flicked the cap off a Bulmer’s and passed it over, an upturned glass balanced over the open neck.
Sherlock was lost, not literally, John knew, but somewhere deep inside his own head.
“Are you done? Fool that you are!” He paced up and down before me, and my eyes unbidden followed every movement, hands clenched behind his back so hard the knuckles turned white and his jaw clenched in anger whilst the water dripped off my chin into my lap. “They would have had you….half naked you were…don’t you know? don’t you realise?...No”, he mumbled, almost to himself, “I never should have left you there…if I’d known it would come to this….he’s just a boy, it will end in heartbreak…it has already begun”.
He pressed his face into Sherlock’s bare shoulder, just breathing in the scent of fresh sweat, weed and laundry detergent. If he could stay here, sleep here a while. Moving was not something he wanted to consider right now.
“Sherlock?” John whispered into the impenetrable darkness. “Fuck this” , he plucked his wand from it’s place under his pillow and muttered “Lumos”.
“Language John”.
“So”, said Victor in a voice that was far too chirpy for someone who had been out clubbing the night before, “You never said what he was like, the bloke you dumped me at the club for, and thanks by the way, I had to hide in the loo to get away from druggie Billy…you see, according to him,
There was a flurry of activity at the front of the house, the guests arriving to make his life a misery for the next few days, he supposed. The oak tree outside his bedroom afforded a much better view, so he stubbed out his cigarette and climbed into the branches to get a closer look.
Ohgodohgodohgod.
How to answer? Mike Stamford had never had an insatiable need to touch her son’s cock after all. Something innocuous then: “Let’s say it was more a mutual appreciation of music”, Sherlock said, levelling his gaze at her, unfazed, “I’m actually still in school”.
Sherlock dragged him off the pavement and into the road, right into the path of a large horse-drawn cab, they froze for a second and time stood still as the world filled with a rolling tomb of metal and wood and ton of terrified horse-flesh. He dived forward, pushing Sherlock clear, feeling the heat from the horses skin as they narrowly avoided an idiotic brush with death.
Irene scowled in annoyance at this unintentional slip, having revealed much more than she wished to my tender ears, her countenance only clearing at the sight of a plump, smiling matron who had lately entered the room.
people whether they wanted him to or not. He knew had no right to question Sherlock this way and make it sound like an
Swinging a leg over the side of the bed, he stood up, catching up the packet and lighter before padding on bare feet to the window. He pushed up the sash and leaned out, taking in deep lungfuls of cold night air that prickled lightly at his naked skin, cigarette already present between his lips.
The car pulled up to a set of large wrought iron gates, set back slightly from the road.
“Your friend Sherlock”
John dropped the coin into his grubby little hand and he flashed us a wide, cheerful grin. He turned and made his way back across to the doorway returning a moment later with a portly red-faced man in tow before slipping away again and out of the open door.
The Powell Estate stood stark and grey against the bleak autumn sky, a looming array of decaying monolithic monstrosities in concrete and glass. An ode to architectural folly, ugly and broken ahead of its time, home to those who’d slipped between the cracks of society, a sub-culture of its own.
“Definitely….it’s only fair I take the strain…you look worn out, in fact,” Sherlock smiled, shucking off his jacket and pulling his t-shirt off over his head, dumping it on the floor, “while we have the place to ourselves why don’t we….test it out?”.
She knows he cheats, of course. Is it cheating though?
The inside was blessedly cool and we seated ourselves at a table by a window facing out onto the street, a pint of cool ale apiece. We had barely sat for five minutes or taken more than a mouthful of our ale, when a young boy of not more than ten years old peered warily through the entrance. I caught his eye and waved him over to our table.
They ran full pelt as lumbering footsteps followed swiftly behind, his lungs began to burn and the wind stung his eyes until finally he slowed as Victor tugged insistently on his arm begging him to stop. He stuttered to a halt, and they both collapsed back onto the wall next to a betting shop, panting heavily and sweating buckets.
“Do it again”
He jumped slightly at the sound of Sherlock’s voice, so raw and husky with emotion, and knew right then that he would never refuse him anything, not now, not ever.
“Oh god forbid some silly tin cup is the be-all and end-all of your sad little existence….pity….” he looked John up and down, fixing him with a searingly, icy glare, “I thought you seemed….more interesting than that….it looks like I was wrong for once”
now?” Sherlock smirked appearing magically at his elbow, sliding a hand around his waist and dipping down below the waistband of his trousers to stroke his fingers along the globe of his arse. It did nothing to ease the burgeoning erection pressing ever more insistently at the front.
“Sherlock will ride with me…we will take the track over the heath, then it is but a short distance…you can take the horses back and we will go on foot from there”.
‘Just stroking you a little, it’ll help you sleep my love’.
“Oh I think our Mr Hudson knew exactly who they were, they may even have been invited, and I think our two ladies know who they were too. Private area? Use your imagination John, this is a strip club and these girls are there to provide the ‘entertainment’, a few ‘optional extras’ so to speak?”
“How splendid are you both!” she gushed, standing much too close to him insinuating herself in my place at his side. “Every lady in the room is abuzz with talk of the two pretty young gentlemen in black and gold, and I knew in an instant that it had to be you…you have both caused quite the stir I assure you”.
Fuck, he had to get out of there now. Sherlock willed himself to calm down as his heart threatened to burst out of his chest. John had said ‘I love you’ and he knew had had to let him go, to send him away.
John slowed his movements, burying his head in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, fighting to come back to himself.
“I fucking hate you Greg Lestrade”
It was still quite early when they left the house, the early autumn sky still suffused with the orange glow of a sun that had yet to set as they walked the short distance to the high street pub. John’s mum had made dinner, just a light plate of pasta and a shop-bought sauce, but he ate it, just to be polite and to line his stomach for the night to come. Mid-meal the front door slammed shut, Harry on her way out without even saying goodbye. Sherlock knew why. She didn’t quite trust herself not to give the game away in front of her mum.
Sherlock felt ill. But he had to give him credit, the smile barely faltered as he approached, only one slight hesitation in his step as their eyes met, a muscle in his cheek jumping a little with the strain of holding a neutral expression. She didn’t have a fucking clue.
John hummed, not because he agreed, but why argue semantics when he could have that mouth on him again, and so he let it happen, the not-kiss that last time hadn’t involved the slide of a tongue and a faint click of teeth as their lips began to move in a very deliberate kind of way that had nothing to do with sex even when everything felt too hot and tight in his jeans and his face burned like fire.
They ran for a few more streets, slowing down to a jog, pulses still racing.
“And do you know why an all?” My face turned blank and he smiled triumphant. “Thank the lord…John would’ve had my head if you knew”.
‘Have you never seen it done before Sherlock? What has that Tom been doing the useless arse, me and the girls could have shown you a thing two by now, we was fair jealous when Mrs Turner put you in with him, I know’, she moved in close and whispered in my ear, ‘How would you like to see Mrs Turner with her sweetheart?’
‘He’s not likely to miss a mark such as that now is he?’ whispered Susan beside me, drawing my attention away from this fright to the form of her most gallant stallion, now unbuttoned and standing stiff and erect before her. He bent down, spreading the lips that concealed her entrance and without preamble thrust his great machine inside her mighty orifice with great ease and began to move, hips pumping with a rapid friction, the bed protesting to the accompaniment of their sighs and moans.
John pursed his lips, hand pausing over the door handle. The boy was sitting up now at the head of the bed, back against the plumped-up pillows, long legs curled under him to one side. He was wearing very tight jeans, the type that almost look sprayed-on, and were probably women’s. John doubted if they made men’s jeans that skinny and hated himself for noticing. The t-shirt was tight too, straining across his chest, faded and stretched out around the neck, like it was a favourite that he’d pulled over his head a few too many times. The boy yawned and stretched, probably on purpose to make the bottom ride up and reveal a tantalising flash of a milky-pale washboard stomach and the hint of a dark happy trail that disappeared below the waistband.
The noise Sherlock made was unholy as John’s made contact, feeling the heat and the weight of him, tasting salt and inhaling the scent of sweat and musk. God, it was addictive he thought, as his tongue snaked out to lick again from base to tip, bringing a hand into play to hold the shaft steady and tilt it down towards his open mouth. John worked on instinct and base need, as he wrapped his lips around Sherlock’s cock and sucked, swirling his tongue around to generate saliva, slurping greedily with no real goal in mind, just enough to have Sherlock’s dick in his mouth.
“Are you okay Sherlock?....how long…do you need…? Oh god, sorry I really don’t know what I should be saying, doing….talk to me for fuck’s sake Sherlock”.
“Mycroft” Victor faltered slightly before he gathered himself again, “…I didn’t expect to see you here…. my father would wish me to extend to you his sincere gratitude for your help in arranging this evening”, he bowed his head politely. They must appear to the onlooker, thought Mycroft with amusement, as two Regency gentlemen here to discuss the honour of some blushing maid.
I love him, I love him, I love him, Jesus Christ I love him.
Oh dear, reader, you must be overcome with mirth at my ignorance, her reference to ‘nieces’ and ‘nephews’ meaning naught to my unsullied mind, foolish child that I was. I fully believed her assertion that her home was a form of gentleman’s club where the men could come to relax and feel free, a fine port-wine and good conversation acting as balm against the vagaries of their day.
“Why not?” Sherlock bristled “We could do that, if we wanted, if you wanted…me”
He could feel the panic cresting like a wave, he felt like he was floating, his arms felt weird, like they didn’t belong to him, someone else’s fingers thumbing through a stream of messages (see you soon x / meet me for lunch x / you look incredible x / I can’t stop thinking about you x / I know you still feel it too x / I wanted to kiss you x / I meant what I said x / I love you Sherlock x / I need to see you again x / I know you want this love x / where are you? I’ll come and get you x ) every single one, stabbing like a knife in his chest.
The first was a grainy blown-up shot of a much younger Sherlock, pre-Victor, therefore fifteen at most, propped up on the floor with his back against a saggy patchwork sofa with a definitely-not-a-cigarette clamped between his lips, just the bare dog-end left. He looked, in fact he had been, incredibly wasted. He remembered this occasion, a minor miracle when he considered how stoned he had been, it was the birthday party of a classmate, some double-barrelled trust- funded chinless wonder, the actual name unimportant. He grunted, unimpressed.
There were no words for me to say for speech had failed me once again, and so, taking my face between his hands he honored me instead with a kiss which said
‘Don’t be afraid lad, you have nothing to fear from me’ he said softly as instinct caused my body to betray the uncertainty I felt even as I replied, ‘You mistake me, I am not afraid sir’.
“And you know him well?”
He gave it the finger as it sped by, and the driver blasted loudly on his horn, some fat guy who he could definitely take in a fight if he suddenly decided to stop.( He didn’t.)
“I know what you think Mycroft…what you believe happened between us, but I am sure Sherlock has told you the same…we did nothing wrong”.
work with that…
The bouncer advanced and Sherlock stepped back again, he heard the crack of knuckles and groped for Victor’s hand in the dark, “Oh and the baby? It’s his not yours, sorry mate…..Victor, RUN”, Sherlock shouted, laughing like a maniac as they pounded down the street, rubber soles slapping against the pavement.
“I want your cock, but I’m too fucking sore from last night”
“Indeed”, he cut me dead with a scathing look, “You do not know. I will be blunt then. You will lose him, he will marry, she will bear him children most like, if not this young woman then another as is befitting of a young man of his station. He was never yours to keep sweet child…did you really believe it would be so?” He bent towards me and cupped my chin lightly with his palm, “Your life, this life”, he gestured around us, “is but a fleeting fantasy…he belongs here and you do not. And if he keeps you close, as some friend after they marry, when your youth and beauty fade he will surely find another ripe virgin in your stead to toy with, no matter how pretty your cock is….there”. He released me and stood back, turning to look out into the night in silent contemplation.
At Christmas.
The grounding weight of John’s body left him, cold and oddly weightless if only for a matter of seconds. And then he was back, pressing soft, tender kisses to his face and brow. He straddled Sherlock’s hips and leant over him, gathering up both Sherlock’s wrists in his hands.
‘And should I be glad at that sir?’
He lunged forward, fisting handfuls of soft blue cotton as Victor pushed back, pressing them together against the wall from chest to thigh. He grasped Sherlock’s slender wrists and yanked them above his head, pinning them there one-handed as he crushed his mouth in a bruising kiss. It was hot and frantic and brutal, fuelled by alcohol and drugs, month upon month of pent-up want, an invasion, his tongue swirled and fucked ruthlessly as Victor effortlessly took him over. Sherlock had forgotten this part, the way he had teased and pursued, flaunted his adolescent charms, confident in his seduction, only for Victor to turn the tables, take full control in a fight for dominance Sherlock could only lose until he was owned, possessed and totally out of control. But he wasn’t a kid anymore, and he wouldn’t just be taken, he thought, as he wrenched his arms free and caught Victor around the waist, weight shifting and shoulder lifting as he span away from the wall, slamming Victor hard against it in his place.
“I’m hardly in the habit of fibbing John.” Sherlock chuckled, darkly, “Or riding death traps in the dark. But in the spirit of honesty, believe me when I say you’re every parent’s nightmare, mine included.”
The smells were cloying and the atmosphere bordered on claustrophobic as John slid down into a seat at the bedside, the insistent buzz and whirr of machinery setting his teeth on edge. Sherlock breathed softly, flat on his back like he never, ever did, long limbs usually wrapped around John from behind, stealing the blankets and invading his body space, radiating heat like a furnace. John would bear it for a while, until it just got too hot and he shoved him off, finding a cool spot on the sheets and settling again. But come the morning he would be buried once more in a tangle of arms and legs with hair up his nose and an erection, pressing hard and insistent in the crack of his arse. Sherlock could have all the morning blowies he wanted after this, John would never complain again.
“I met him only once before, the very same night I met you. All I know is of his wealth and nothing of his reputation, for the girls of the house confessed that he has always sought to keep that concealed. Not even my mistress knew of his name, but so long as he was willing to give coin she allowed it, but he expressed no desire to add to my corruption and warned me of the wicked path I had set myself upon”.
“Oh my god…you’re shining a torch up my arsehole aren’t you Sherlock?”
Maybe.
He took my hand, and led me to the tub, and bid me stay still whilst he undressed me like a child, each item draped on a small wooden stool at the side. Then he clambered over the edge hissing at the first touch of a toe to the water, a little too hot for true comfort, told by steam rising up from the surface. A moment’s hesitation and he took the plunge, submerging his limbs to slip down into the enveloping heat with a contented sigh. I followed, a little more ungainly in the arrangement of my limbs, trying to fold back into myself, gangly knees and elbows and shins all vying for room, feet sliding against the burnished copper. John set his hands at my hips to guide me down, in our customary way, he behind, legs spread wide, I in front with my back to his chest, slid down so that my head nestled gently against his shoulder, legs bent at the knee to fit. He curled his arms around my chest and we lay for a short time, basking in the soothing heat.
There was a sweet sense of urgency to it, the way John bent to kiss him then, pressing down while Sherlock spread his legs to let John lie between rutting frantically still half-clothed the roughness of the denim hitting all the right spots almost painful at the sensitive head of his cock as John’s tongue invaded his mouth. Not that he gave a damn, after five days of feeling like shit and John walking on eggshells around him Sherlock would take what he could get, there’d be plenty of time later for proper fuck, but for now a dry hump would do nicely.
She popped back up again and shut the car door with a click, hoisting the bag up on her shoulder as she turned to look at him.
“Mr Magnusson sir”
“Just yes or no….answer me Sherlock…and don’t lie, I’ll know if you do”
“How exciting!...A mystery!”, said Mary, interrupting, my apprehensions realised, to my annoyance. I did not want her involved in my business and harsh words would serve me badly delivered in company, especially to a lady. But still, I could not let this pass, even at the press of a heel to my toe in warning.
The kitchen fell silent. Mike blinked rapidly, opened his mouth as if to speak and closed it again. He swallowed convulsively, and trailed his hand back and forward through his short bristly hair.
“I need air” he croaked.
John was a stranger, but something deep inside spoke that he was not.
“I want you tonight, all of you…will you let me do that?” he whispered breathlessly.
He was fast god dammit, but John didn’t dare ask him to slow down. Their feet pounded along the pavement as Sherlock steered them deftly through the throng at breakneck speed while Jim and his cronies thundered along , not gaining any ground on them, but not exactly falling behind. John stumbled as his body sagged, hunger and fatigue choosing the worst possible moment to get the better of him.
“I’m not laughing”
Sebastian looked positively murderous – oh shit, why did he have such a big fucking mouth?
Mycroft gave a long-suffering sigh. “Just get in the car Sherlock, this is all rather tiresome, and I’m sure the small quantity of Cocaine you imbibed must have worn off by now, so I should imagine you will soon be in need of a lie down”.
His tone was soft, more concern than anger but it stabbed like a knife to my chest nonetheless. I had gambled our future on the ivory pipe, and in truth I must confess it would not be the last time I succumbed. But that is a tale for another time, so suffice it to say, that for now I believed in my heart I would never be so reckless again. And sparing me the need to answer him now, John crossed the threshold to his room and returned with a laden breakfast tray and placed it on the bed before me, fresh bread and cold cuts, honey and preserves, a welcome sight on any other day but which set my belly in turmoil once again on this.
Weston sat back heavily, and only then deigned to look up, fixing me with a nasty sneer. “There is no business for you here,” he glanced at Tom, “you or your pimp.” Tom took a half-pace forward, deeply offended on my behalf, and began to protest, “Sir do not address him in that manner, I…” But I placed a warning hand upon his arm and he stilled again, the tension radiating out from him nonetheless. He must understand that to react with violence to such insults would be a grave mistake of which Tom have the worst of it should this interview turn sour. I did my best to appear contrite on his behalf.
“Kitty dear”, Mrs Hudson called out. The girl looked up from her task, and leaving her things strewn wild on the table she rose, walking to the gent and offering her arm, “Fancy goods sir?”, she asked, and he answered with a curt nod, and indicating the door with the willow and birch trees beside it she lead him by us and entered into that mysterious chamber beyond.
There was something in the way he said it, the glint in his eye and the answering grin from the lad at our side, that said to me that they had been more to each other than their stations should allow, but whatever had been between them there seemed only a mutual regard and friendship now.
His eyes lacked the kaleidoscopic vibrancy that Sherlock’s had, but his gaze was equally as penetrating, subjecting John to the same soul-stripping scrutiny he had felt when he had first encountered Sherlock – was it really only two days ago?
Sherlock sighs and sits up on the bed. He waits for a minute for the bright white lights to stop popping in front of his eyes before he leans down to pick up a crumpled ‘The Cure’ t-shirt and a pair of artfully ripped black jeans.
A sandy blond head peered quizzically at him from the foot of the oak, one hand shielding his eyes from the glare of the winter sun. Sherlock gaped, open- mouthed, completely derailed from his current train of thought as the most beautiful creature he had ever seen smiled up at him from the ground.
But not going to Arithmancy then. John groaned inwardly at the thought of all those complex numbers and symbols which were proving this year, to be the bane of his existence…..and Sherlock thought he was actually trying to conceal some hidden brilliance? He turned his feet towards South tower and wished he had the balls to skive off too.
“I know its fine. And the answer’s no, I don’t have a boyfriend.” Sherlock answered.
They were just outside the ballroom in a large circular vestibule, as guests milled around them clutching complementary flutes of champagne and nibbling politely on intricately presented hors d’oeuvre’s on silver trays. Mycroft stood in front of him, his fury perfectly concealed by an outward appearance of innocuous benevolence. He allowed himself a moment to savour the look of guilt and anguish that crossed Victor’s face even as he squared his shoulder’s defiantly.
“You never stop, do you?”
“Well, seeing as you asked so nicely” John said.
Long pale fingers snapped out of nowhere and wrapped themselves tightly around his wrist, ensnaring him in an iron grip.
“I’ll find you something when I get out of here…in a minute or so, I expect…oh god this feels marvellous John. It’s strange isn’t it, how one always detests the idea of taking a bath, but then you never want to get out once you’re in?”
Who would have known my John was so debauched? That he was to teach me as much about the art of love as was to be found in many a whore-house? But still, it saddened me a little that I was not his first as he was mine, and he knew my mind as ever and as was in his nature he tried his best to reassure.
An old lady drinking a hot chocolate at the table behind them looked up in alarm, scandalised, and tutted at them both with disapproval. John covered his brow with one hand and tapped out a compulsive rhythm on the table-top with the other. Maybe it was better to just let her get all the bile and resentment out now. Let her call John all the insulting names, cast all the gay slurs, call him out as the bastard that he so obviously was.
“Sherlock”, John said tenderly, “ Please tell me if I act out of turn…if this is abhorrent to you, and if that is the case we will not go on, we will have a merry celebration with the dearest of friends and speak no more on this”.
“We can stop….it’s okay we can stop…”
’ really meant.
It was now 7.15 and John had done every possible thing he could think of to fill in the intervening hours, but his nerves were jangling once again. He wanted to wait until the last possible minute to dress, because at this rate he was sure he would sweat through any outfit in seconds even after half a can of deodorant. John was seriously considering another quick shower in a mild state of panic when his phone rang out from the bedside table An unfamiliar voice called out, brisk and efficient.
That was it, he couldn’t take a minute more, and if he was going to come (and he most definitely was) he would make sure John was coming with him, and after all, he was never one to play fair…
…yes Sir…
“The what now?” John threw back in a panic. It was like when someone said don't think of elephants. The moment that Victor had mentioned Sherlock's bum that was all he could bloody well think about. Sherlock's eyes went wide in realisation, and he raised his eyebrows skyward as if to say God save me from this roomful of utter imbeciles. John could hardly blame him. He was stuck on the drugs thing as well to be honest, and how Sherlock knew what Victor had been up to last night, and whether they'd done it together. Literally.
The only light in the small dingy space came from a yellowing candle set on an old, cracked china plate. Sherlock was curled on an old sagging mattress, back to the open door with a fluffy wool jumper folded as a makeshift pillow shoved beneath his head. One of John’s, though god knows when he had nicked that one, it was one his favourites and he hadn’t even missed it, although Sherlock had told him on more than one occasion that it made him look like a furry dwarf. The lying little bastard.
“ Ah Greg…your powers of observation are as outstanding as ever I see”
The Intelligence Office was a heaving throng of London’s poor and desperate as Irene pushed me forward to present myself for what I can only describe as ‘inspection’, prodded and poked as I was like a prize cow at a country fayre.
“Forgive me”, he said, drawing out a handkerchief from the pocket of his coat to wipe the sticky mess from his palm.
“Coming down The Bull after?” Mike Stamford asked, already showered and changed, as he started walking backwards away from John and out of the changing rooms to follow the rest of the team.
“Yeah?”, said John, “And just how many times have you wanked over them in the last few years?”
“Jesus Christ…who was it this time?” because really, this was nothing new and told John everything he needed to know about why Sherlock was currently neither in uniform nor at school.
I ripped off my shirt with scorn, setting my curls askew, the colour raised and blazing with anger across my chest. Anger at myself, anger at Charles and anger at the injustice of a world that would deny me my lover in plain sight, condemned as something to be hid and scorned.
It was definitely the gym, John thought, the sports hall at his old school had a similar design. He could tell by the length of the building and the long narrow windows set high as Sherlock trod down a narrow gravel path that ran all along one side.
“That would be wonderful Sarah…I thank you”, murmured John.
“Do you mind if I…..?”
Right, now it was open for debate which of them was the bigger idiot.
The heavy weight that had been slowly squeezing his chest in a death-grip, eased.
“Is Mycroft home?”
The scent of fresh bread made his empty stomach clench as he passed a bakers shop. The owner’s dog lay on the front step knawing on half a scorched loaf. It would be so tempting to abandon his pride for once, and wrestle the little terrier for the meagre scrap of bread, but he passed by avoiding the gaze of the baker’s wife as she scowled at him from the doorway. Fuck, he must look really desperate.
Sherlock freed a hand and touched a finger to his face, and there it was, he could feel it, a little horizontal furrow.
“You, why the bloody hell are you lurking around here freak show?”
“I’m not trying to be, can’t you see that?.....But… why can’t you understand how much I care about Sherlock?”
“Okay, I’ll just tell you how… and who” the boy smiled as he felt John relax, “no-one is as observant as I am so I’m sure you’ll have much more success this time”
He was glad to feel awake, would sit there by the bed all night if he had to, just as long as Sherlock saw him, waiting, when he finally awoke. God had other plans though, and the minute he rounded the corner to the private rooms he knew, the whole atmosphere different, crackling with electricity and activity.
“Won’t they find us here?, we should probably move” John managed finally as he glanced over the side and looked down.
Only 2 seconds, she must have been moving faster than he had thought. Although in her case, Sherlock’s presence always elicited a speedy response.
But Sherlock doesn’t give a fuck anymore. He got exactly what he came for.
John felt light-headed. If he didn’t eat soon he would pass out and that wouldn’t be much good for any of them.
Being slighter in build I went through first. The attic beyond was much the same with an almost overpowering scent of effluent on the air.
“So, tell me John, how is it that you can go from having barely any physical contact with me for the last two months to doing god knows what with some random guy on the same night you meet him? How does that work exactly? Sorry, no, not god knows what, let’s not sugar coat this shall we, you had sex with him, didn’t you, sex, with a boy, gay sex, up the arse sex!”
Oh god, he actually was a mad-man John thought as the lock clicked, echoing in the darkness, and the door edged open engulfing them both in an icy blast. The wind had picked up and a flurry of snow was beginning to coat the ground and John knew from bitter experience that by morning they could be knee deep in snow. But Sherlock was obviously not put off in the slightest as he boldly struck out across the courtyard.
John, surely you must be ready by now?”
“Oh where’s the fun in that John?...I got more than just my stocking filled this year….and maybe next time I could be a naughty reindeer….”
“What the hell did you do that for…are you mad?”
Convenient? What the hell! John didn’t believe for one second that Mycroft gave a shit about what would be convenient to him, there was a catch here somewhere, he was sure.
“And as for what I am doing right now, I would have thought that was obvious Mycroft dear, would you like to have a lick?” Sherlock smirked suggestively, drawing the spoon from his lips.
“For god’s sake John, that’s not really helping… Hang on….back in a minute..”
The reply came through within seconds, but it still made Sherlock startle.
It is already gone ten when they leave the house, fashionably late.
“You wanted the truth” John nodded silently, looking up into those impossibly beautiful eyes, trying not to imagine them cold and dead and lifeless.
“Mmm” he groaned as at long last he let it all out. Maybe he could have a nap in the bath because Christ, it would be just too embarrassing to go back down now. They would laugh about this tomorrow, John would tease him mercilessly, but for now his cheeks burned with humiliation. John must think he was such a stupid child.
They sat like that for hours, until the light faded and the rain finally stopped, the material of John’s jumper damp against his skin and stretched beyond repair from Sherlock’s iron grip. John stroked the curls back from his face as Sherlock fell into a fitfull doze, breath hitching just like Harry’s used to, when she was a baby and cried herself to sleep after some massive tantrum.
“Anyway” Greg interjected angrily, “more to the point, the little dickhead’s fucked off again, left us to pack up, and Myc will chew my fucking ear off for letting him do a runner again, second night running. “Stupid little shit”, he mumbled as he continued to cart kit to the van. He turned to John. “Look, sorry mate, you seem like a nice kid, but if you do see the little wanker, tell him from me he’s a dead man”.
(Had he? What had he said? Oh god that!)
Angela-Andrea-Sandra gave a sigh, and swept back her mane of red hair. “Look, here, ring this number,” she said, scrawling on the back of an old cinema ticket with a dusty blue biro she had miraculously liberated from the floor beside John's bed. “They do a fantastic back, neck and shoulder. Almost as good as a sports massage. Just ask for a hard one," she added, without the slightest trace of irony. "Fifty per-cent off for students.”
“I heard you were fucking good at sucking cock Sherlock, but a straight guy? Wow, that’s impressive even by your standards”
He mother shifted uncomfortably and glanced nervously at Malcolm, hoping he at least would back her up.
“Hey Sherlock, I didn’t expect to see you here tonight” he jumped a little at the voice, sounding so close behind his back and bristled slightly at the hidden implication there.
What…when the fuck had they decided any such thing? John felt a shiver of excitement, he supposed he could be up for that. It was about time someone put Sherlock in his place, the arrogant little shit. But then he remembered his bruised and battered ribs and gave an involuntary wince, and reluctantly thought they might have to be a bit more creative about that.
Then I took up the other in turn, rolling it slightly in my fingertips, feeling the weight, the warmth of the softly burnished metal. It was wider than the other, made for a thicker more masculine hand than my own. It also bore the mark of an inscription, words John had chosen in my stead, ‘
“Ah! Fuck!” Sherlock jerked reflexively, pulling up his left leg to give John easier access, cradling it to his chest, whimpering softly as John continued to work around his entrance, not quite giving him what he wanted…needed.
‘There is little to tell', he said, leaning back in his chair, 'my father is a merchant too and as his only son I am expected to join him in the family business’.
Mycroft’s calculating gaze swept over John who stared back evenly, an open challenge to Mycroft to speak his mind and tell him what he really thought – that when it came to a society ball he just wasn’t good enough. The insufferable snob.
Sherlock uncurled his body and stretched out in the soft squishy bed. A delicious fire licked up in the grate, orange flames dancing as it warmed through the last of the chill from the night air.
“So… erm” John stuttered nervously, aware that they were now, very much alone, “You will be here, next to the window…but I can do a swap if you want…I don’t mind, I’ll sleep anywhere you like”
John tried valiantly to hide his disappointment, the night before feeling more and more like a hazy memory. Just to see him, a brief word or better still, a quick kiss before he lost him to a room full of people would have made all the difference. Instead, he joined Mike and the gang at the bar, where the crowd was already three deep, waiting for alcohol to take the edge off his shattered nerves. A few brief chords sounded loudly over the speaker system as the band checked sound levels and Greg took the mic to introduce themselves. John turned and craned his neck over the crowd, standing on his toes to get a better view, wishing for a few more blessed inches in the height department. He felt a light-headed rush as an achingly familiar tall thin body began bouncing energetically on the balls of his feet, guitar held firmly, shaking off the excess adrenaline before the opening number. Curls cascaded around his face, that stunning gorgeous face, as Greg leant in to whisper something in his ear, he nodded, made some adjustments to the foot pedal in front of him and stood up, scanning the audience this time. John didn’t want to draw attention to himself by raising a hand or something, although people would probably assume they were friends (it wasn’t as if he had gay boyfriend tattooed across his forehead). There were enough people gathered around the front of the stage anyway, giggling groups of girls pouting and posing, trying to catch the attention of Greg and Sherlock.
“One last go?”
Sherlock stretched and yawned. The answer was obvious to him, do it, tell his mother now, it shouldn’t be a problem, Harry was out and his mother had accepted that by all accounts, so just why was John so afraid to do the same? He wasn’t ashamed, this wasn’t a phase, it was real, as real as it was ever likely to get, for both of them.
The beds we resolved to make use of in an alternating fashion so as not to arouse suspicion amongst our fellows or to alarm the young maid should she happen upon us, but I would not sleep separate on any account, the need for his warm naked body as vital to me now as water and air.
John shot him a nervous glance and Sherlock raised his eyebrows in response.
“Are you begging me John? -tell me what you want” he raised himself up to look into John’s eyes, pupils blown wide with lust, the only clue he was as much on the edge as John.
It was best not to make too big a deal about it, John decided. He doubted very much whether Sherlock had eaten at all today, he certainly hadn’t eaten breakfast and he had pissed off somewhere else just before lunch, and as far as John was aware, cigarettes and alcohol did not belong to any known food group. It counted as a minor triumph to get Sherlock to agree to eat anything, so there was no way he was going to contradict him.
“We do share a dorm you know?” Sherlock whispered darkly sending shivers down John’s neck and spine, and a few brief seconds felt like an hour as they stared each other down.
Oh god please don’t let them catch me now, he pleaded as Sherlock slowed a little at the pavements edge, frantically searching for some means to get away.
The smug git.
Her demeanour had already changed toward me, displaying an eagerness to divest herself of any further responsibility, chivvying me along with an air of impatience. The reason for our haste was soon made clear.
“Can’t we just forget dinner? Food is boring John and I’m not hungry, not for food anyway”
“Marcus Hunt”
I feel the lady of the house knew how things stood with us the minute we entered her domain, but I recognised in her too something of the mercenary and the advantage of letting out her rooms being her sole objective, the truth about the nature of our friendship would have scarce raised an eyebrow nor have cause to make her break the bargain.
Vic had some blu-tack, so he knicked it from his room and spent ten minutes carefully tacking the drawings above the bed in chronological order. And then it was six-thirty and there was no more time to think as Sherlock grabbed his towel and headed for the shower.
I felt the sweet flame ignite within me as I looked upon it, imagining all the things which we had yet to do and that I both feared and craved. How would it be to sink within him as he had done to me, holding his hips as I pushed into his willing body and spilled my seed inside him? Or he, on his back as he was this minute guiding me down to impale myself upon his cock? I flushed as I felt myself harden, aroused by the image of debauchery conjured from my own mind and stole my hand down beneath the rumpled sheets, heart racing at the thought of touching myself in this way while he slept alongside me, oblivious. My eyes closed and I sighed.
- A gold guinea was worth £1.00 sterling, or around 20 shillings, and if you consider that the average wage of a housemaid like Sarah was around £6-£8 per YEAR, one guinea would have been worth a least a couple of months wages to her.
“You have renewed an old acquaintance, so it would appear, yesterday , if you want me to be precise….. How long did it take before you slept with him Sherlock? Did you wait for the whole day… or were you really
want her to see.
“You forget about the masks Sherlock…you can be who you want to be, morality redefined for an evening…I could kiss you as a lover and none would think ill…they would applaud us for our sport most likely or it may pass ignored…but be on your guard, there are many whose object will be to take liberties with the unwary”.
“God yes….”.
Did he really look that fucking rough?
Of Tom I saw little and sometimes not at all, as his services were much in demand for the gentlemen who shared such proclivities, those who found no pleasure in the soft, silken flesh of a woman, stirring only at the touch of a hard unyielding body and a long thick cock, of which I confess provoked the pulse of heated blood to course through my own veins at the thought. That I would join him soon enough I could not contemplate as yet.
“Be my guest”.
“Yeah…I’d like that”
The servants stared in awe as we passed, John set and determined, striding angrily, so swift it was a task to keep pace. My side burst in pain, but I followed on dogged, outside and around the side of the mansion to a well-kept stable. He cast around and headed for an open stall where a lad was bent at his task, with firm brisk strokes, he smoothed a brush along the flanks of a young dappled grey, who snickered softly at our approach. John let go of my hand, and in two quick steps he buried his face in the pretty mare’s neck, smoothing his hand in soothing strokes over her thick glossy mane.
I stared at his hand where it held onto my own and up to his face creased with a mixture of both hope and fear. The room around us was silent as those who had gathered held a collective breath. Every eye was fixed upon us, the air thick with the thrill of expectation. But I could not form the words. My mouth had gone dry as the desert itself, and John let go of my hand and stepped back again, uncertain.
“How much did we get….enough?”
“Indeed no…”, he went on
Vince had also pitched in “Yeah, I might have to invest in some of those noise cancelling headphones – Christ mate, you make some fucking noise”
“Mmm, the purple shirt of sex…tempting”
Sherlock squinted.
A cold bottle pressed into his palm.
“Fuck no….car, 1979 Black Ford Capri”.
The defensive stance was back again, just when John thought they had started to make some progress. He decided to be kind and give Sherlock an out because this wasn’t why they were out here after all, and because he didn’t believe for one second that Sherlock had anything to do with murdering anyone.
The knock came again louder this time and he sprang from the bed to answer it.
Miss Mary Morstan and friend, shining like a cheap, gaudy bauble in a scarlet gown and mask to match, fell like the harbinger of doom upon us and I allowed it, fool that I was. I folded my hands behind my back, standing tall, with my chin thrust out in displeasure. I did not care to pretend, to rejoice in her presence, I wished her to leave most fervently and not under any circumstance to presume to court attention from John. In this, my failure was most decisive.
When he was satisfied they were out of sight he ushered his disgruntled guests out through the front door to the large black car waiting patiently by the kerb. The front door closed with a loud clunk.
“Now what the hell is he doing here, it’s a long way from the Powell Estate and the club, and this would be his busiest night of the week”
Sherlock just rolled his eyes and continued bending over like
For reasons
It was so wrong, to want that beautiful mouth like this, those hands, eyes, cock, arse…hell, every damn thing. One touch was all it had taken and now John wanted more. “Don’t ever be sorry” he said, as his fingers tangled in the soft dark hair at the nape of Sherlock’s neck….
Sherlock kissed him back, slipping in a little tongue this time, just a taste,
“John…erm…I did need the money, but didn’t want it to be on Irene’s terms, that’s why I turned her down”
“You should hope I never meet that person, because I swear to god I will hurt them”.
Angela hovered uncertainly. How exactly did you report something like this, they knew where he was, so would it be classed as a missing person? She opted for something bland and neutral.
“Perhaps,” John echoed my own words, lips tilted in the slightest of smiles as he looked at me in wonderment, “But you do not know him as I do. You are much too generous of nature to think he may be capable of compassion or forgiveness. How can it be that you wish to mend bridges, while I, his son, would itch to put a pistol to his head? I would never forgive him, even if he begged me on his knees for what he did to you.”
“You are amazing, do you know that?, no don’t answer, I know you do you arrogant prick”
“Sherlock?” John asked, seeking my consent, and I nodded to him curtly while Mary looked on triumphant and knowing, and her young friend, a timid little thing, hovered at my side in expectation. I rolled my eyes and stuck out my arm to her, not wanting to dance in the least, but not wanting to lose sight of John in this place. I imagined him giddy from the dance and drunk on champagne following after this siren to some dark secluded corner where she would entice him, touch him, give herself over and lift up her skirts, as if she did not know, as if my regard for him meant nothing to her. I could not rise for a woman, but I knew John had done, many times. And though I had faith in his love, I feared this.
(where are you / I’m sorry I shouted / I’m still here, outside now / Sherlock please talk to me / this isn’t funny, where are you? / are you okay? / just let me know you’re okay x)
So Victor had spilled his guts in the hope that John would be consumed by jealousy and anger and dump him. And then what? Did he think that Sherlock would thank him - then crawl back into his bed and spread his legs for him?
He had the right of it. It would serve no good to speak with her here, or in any place really. I could not blame John for bringing me here to this part of town, for how was he to have known that which I hadn’t known myself, that she was here in this place all along?
“Is Seb your new boyfriend then Sherlock?” She looked at them both expectantly.
He darted quickly past the dark gaping space, thankful for the reassuring presence of tall buildings at his side and the occasional car that swept by.
Great, he could add spewing in a strangers house to the list of embarrassing things John Watson did in his first week at Uni.
I could scarce take a jot, the smooth silken head of him being all that would breach me at the start, and so it had been with my arsehole, tight and closed against him till I learned to trust that I would not come to harm. I pushed my tongue along the underside and the slick slide of saliva eased the passage enough that I might take in more, and in doing so he cried out, my dry lips dragging somewhat rough and unprepared for skin more delicate than it appeared.
“So your current plan, I take it, is to corrupt me instead?”
“Well fuck me lads, if it isn’t the faggot boyfriend, the one with the massive dick”
‘I know nothing of you’ I raised my head to look at him, and saw an answering wetness reflected there and felt the pull of his fingertips where they tangled in my sleep-tossed hair. I raised a hand to his face and traced the delicate bow of his lips with a trembling fingertip, and with that I was lost.
He’d been a late baby, a happy little accident mistaken at first for the onset of menopause, she was forty eight, and instead of shrivelled ovaries and the end of the monthly blight, she got Sherlock, every squalling, red-faced, eight pounds seven ounce part of him, conceived the night of a champagne reception at Kensington Palace. She’d been mildly inebriated ever since.
“Fuck off Victor”
“John! For goodness sake” his mother blustered, her obvious embarrassment at his accusation telling him all he needed to know.
I wanted to believe so badly he was saved, that his bravery and cunning had brought him home to me , and that he was here searching for the brother he had lost, but for reasons unknown could not yet reveal himself. Perhaps he had used the same trick again and I had only a riddle to solve to discover his new name. I wished it to be so. I willed it so. How could hope be given and so cruelly snatched away again?
(Boyfriend? Is that what John was? His boyfriend? – he felt a warm glow in his chest at the thought).
As we alighted from the carriage, as put-together as it was possible to be, the driver eyed us and the closed drapes with open curiosity.
His second in less than a week.
“Didn’t anyone ever take you….I mean when you were a kid, you know?” he didn’t know where this conversation was going, but it would be less embarrassing to rule the ‘innocent’ explanations out first.
“Funnily enough that doesn’t make me feel better Sherlock, no…”
He let the words sink in, watching John’s face carefully to gauge his reaction, then meekly held out his arm for inspection. John felt numb. Yes, that was the best he could manage. It wasn’t exactly a massive leap from what he already knew, and Sherlock certainly fit the profile, personality wise, and…He stopped, checked himself, aware of the detatched clinical way his train of thought had taken. It felt weird discussing this here, in the middle of the club.
“I can get you off if you want me too…I know how to do that” John whispered in his ear as he clung to his shoulders unable to speak or even think. He gave a shaky nod and John continued, sliding his fingers up and down his prick until Sherlock thought he would die from the sensation.
They shuffled nervously towards the door. Mrs Hudson placed a gentle hand on Sherlock’s arm to hold him back and John glanced at them both questioningly.
“I’ll ask Billy to fix me a low dose, just enough to relieve the withdrawl symptoms, he’s an excellent chemist…almost as good as I am”.
“Hurry up, we haven’t got all night”
“Yeah. Boyfriend”. The boy leaned in close, sweet breath ghosting over the side of his face, soft lips pink and moist…very pretty indeed. “I think you might know him mate…his name’s Sherlock”.
“I fucking hate you Sherlock” he hissed as he ground his hips down with a moan.
“Uncle Nigel couldn’t make it”, Sherlock said with a smirk, “so there’s a room free, if you should want it…further down the hall….”
“You do know how ridiculous you look when you do ‘the face’ don’t you?”
“No, okay, I suppose we aren’t…anything, are we?” Sherlock looked crestfallen, his voice suddenly devoid of its former warmth.  He pushed himself up on trembling arms and stalked away to a low-set window with a wide, deep sill, where he sat on the bare boards with his legs crossed and his arms laced around his body, hugging himself tight. “It’s getting rather late, and cold. Perhaps you should go.”
“In fact, as I seem to recall, you just about ripped my clothes off there and then, we almost gave Mycroft a proper eyeful”
It was natural curiosity, Sherlock told himself, as he wasn’t in the slightest bit interested in the boy who would be sharing his room.
Shit, he had to stop assuming that this was what Sherlock would want. There was a bloody big difference between a quick peck on the lips under pressure and full-blown gay sex after all.
“Oh god what a lightweight, we’re not even out yet” Sherlock huffed, “Okay, I’ll share a bag of chips or something, some nice greasy, deep-fried, artery-clogging potatoes, will that do?” he gave a long-suffering sigh, leaning back languidly on the bed.
‘Hey, here’s one for you. Check this one out, bloody perfect.’ Mike crowed in triumph, breaking through John’s dive into self-pity, and presented the page to him with a flourish, failing to notice John’s grimace of discomfort.
Sherlock didn’t really like pizza and it irked him slightly that John had seemed to have forgotten that, but he valiantly plucked a slice from the box and plopped it onto a paper plate. Yuck, heavy, stodgy, dense and thick with greasy cheese and alarmingly synthetic tomato sauce. He poked at his slice and nibbled some crusted mozerella that had flowed over the side as John watched, because the sight of Sherlock eating anything at all was always guaranteed to make him smile.
“I thought you were enjoying that”
“How about a gram or two for the road…..Sherlock…isn’t it? Can’t forget a name like that now, can I?.I remember how much you used to like it you fucking little coke-whore, what do you say beautiful, wanna party?”
“Yeah…right…shit” he moved towards the hall in a daze, fumbling by the coats pegs for his parka with the fur hood and a pair of Wellington boots. Oh no, the party, there was a roomful of people back there. He hesitated, torn between ingrained politeness and the burning need to see Sherlock right now. His friends would understand surely?
“This is no joke I can assure you”, Mycroft tutted, rolling his eyes in clear disapproval. Sherlock noted a hint of pink on his sallow cheeks, a sign of his embarrassment. My god, Mycroft was such an old-fashioned prude, could he really be only twenty-five?
Sherlock trudged slowly down the driveway, ignoring Mycroft’s impatient huffs. His feet crunched on gravel which glittered like a sheet of diamonds in the chill night air. There would be a hard frost tonight. Faint patterns like summer leaves in bloom already wrote themselves onto the leaded window panes of the silent house as he left it reluctantly behind.
“Come on John mate it’s been four fucking days…get your clothes on we’re going out tonight”
If it was physically possible for the human heart to simultaneously leap and sink at the same time, then that was what happened to John Watson as he stood in the kitchen in his pants, staring at a very naked Sherlock Holmes, framed in the open doorway. His soon-to be ex (sorry I forgot to let you know that little fact while I was shagging this maniac) girlfriend Sara, looked on in horror.
I think then, that you understand our position. We had a secret and one that we wished to remain so for now, but above that, she knew me for a whore from the minute I stepped through the door. So, it would seem did another of her lodgers who on seeing me had proposed to have me at any price if she could part me from my protector.
It must have been the right thing to say as Sherlock tipped forward and pressed him back down until they were lying flush against each other again, a deeply erotic sensation with Sherlock being naked while he was still fully dressed, as the heat of him penetrated John’s skin.
“I guessed”.
Harry shrugged “Just giving things a little push Johnny…at least he’s legal now”
“You fuss like an old maid Sherlock, for you would still be those most striking creature in London even though wandered the town dressed in sackcloth”.
“And your hand…that happened you punched the stall”
That little question answered apparently.
“Quite” Sherlock smirked, “You’ll have to work on your stamina then, because I plan on having you again…. right now” he reached out his left hand and let his fingers trail slowly up John’s thigh. He jolted with the pure electric shock of it, body responding automatically to the touch like Pavlov’s fucking dog.
Fuck.
Head butt, yeah, that would do the trick.
Oh god, this could not be good.
They would have to be careful, it was still a public place.
“Bend over a little for me”
“Sherlock….
So why exactly had he agreed to this? A clandestine meeting far away from prying eyes? Because he had to know for sure, if it was all gone, if he was truly over this, so that he could bury it in his past where it belonged.
Jim nodded his assent without question and set to his task, while John walked me over to a stack of baled hay and sat, signalling that I should do the same. The hay prickled at my legs, and I stifled a sneeze in the dusty air as a shimmering cloud of Thrips hovered before us in the half-light.
Oh god, he really hoped that didn’t sound quite as suggestive as he belatedly thought it did.
John grunted on top on him, “Ignore the little cunt…he’s a thief…he’s trying to steal something from me and I
John paused, rocked back a step, out of breath and wide-eyed
“All of them?”
“Oh god John Watson you drive me insane! Shower. Now!”
He crushed the spent butt in his fingertips and flicked it away across the carpark.
“You’re powers are slipping brother darling, a bench in Regent’s Park, although there was a rather large bin nearby”
“Wait - is that literally or metaphorically?” John’s grin split his face as he confidently slung one thick, jean-clad thigh across the motorcycle saddle to straddle it and gave a wriggle to get comfortable. Sherlock started to sweat again despite the cool interior of the workshop. He flinched as John gunned the engine and the bike sprang to life with a roar.
John flipped him off good naturedly and stood watching long after the taxi had moved out of sight.. His stomach clenched, every time Sherlock left he had the inexplicable feeling he might never see him again, that holding on to him was like trying to hold smoke in his hands.
“John, if you could step outside a moment…”
“How did you know?” Sherlock was bent over at the waist clutching his side. He peered up at John, mouth tilted in a slight smile, eyebrow quirked, questioningly.
He was nervous and it irritated him to feel that way, with a nauseous sensation in his stomach and skin that felt all….wrong.
“You left”, he hissed through clenched teeth.
They pounded down the alley, skidded around the corner and continued on, away from the direction of the Amersham Arms. Sherlock’s long legs gave him the edge and John found himself pulled along in his wake, fighting for breath, lungs screaming.
“Dad! Could we not? Please?” John interrupted, throwing a terrified glance Sherlock’s way. Even Sherlock knew John’s dad was only teasing now. His own parents had little time and even less inclination to engage with their sons like this. If he was honest, Sherlock rarely even saw his parents, and Mycroft, his brother, was constantly busy at his new job in London and hadn’t been home for weeks. Besides, such behaviour naturally implied an element of affection and familiarity between the parties wholly absent in his own case as Sherlock couldn’t imagine a family more emotionally and physically remote as his own. Little wonder then, that he was touch-starved. Little wonder he would cling to any physical contact like a life-raft, be it good, bad, or indifferent. But John mustn’t know that. John thought he was normal for god’s sake. Sherlock felt his thoughts spiralling again and forced himself to stop.
Tough I knew it to be so, anger flared on Tom’s behalf. And if it weren’t for John’s grounding touch, the hand upon my wrist I should have flown at him, thrown my arms about his neck and begged him stay awhile and bear the harridan’s wrath. She could not best him, my loyal, strong Tom, but yet he swayed to her call nonetheless like a prisoner. I could not bear it.
A blast of cool autumn air ruffled the newspapers in the stand by the entrance as she moved out onto the pavement and was swallowed in a sea of people. Right, John thought, now Mike.
“What next?” he had pouted, “A life of abject boredom?”
‘I won’t take less than a hundred and fifty guineas sir’
William Holmes pursed his lips in thought, staring around the shabby house with a dark and dangerous look in his eye.
He pushed in, inch by inch, long muscled legs hoisted up over his shoulders as he wriggled and rolled his hips a little to bury himself balls- deep. He paused, arms quivering with the effort to hold his body up, and took a moment to admire the tangled curls of pubic hair, black against blond, pulling back just a little then in and back again, mesmerised by the slide of his cock inside the body underneath him.
“She’s a milliner by trade sir”
“How? For god’s sake Sherlock, they’re right there”
Well that was true, it would be impossible to hide, the bastard probably had it sussed out already.
“You’re playing with fire Sherlock”, he growled, turning Sherlock’s head to the side and sucking a painful bruise onto the delicate skin above his collarbone. Closer, he needed to be closer than this. Sherlock lifted his legs up and wrapped them firmly around John’s waist, crossed at the ankle for leverage, he thrust up hard and whimpered at the crush of their erections. John was so hard and wet, how the hell could he stand this?
“Bedroom”
“Can I fuck you, will you let me….just one last time?”
I awoke the next morning with the light full upon me, shining through the open drapes which we had never thought to close, a faint pulse of pain striking at my brow as I blinked and looked around. A second bottle of wine stood on dresser by the bed, half empty, the first, the architect of my deflowering discarded on its side on the floor. Two empty plates lay there too and a crust of dried bread from a makeshift meal, the purpose of which had been only to replenish our strength in the aftermath of our physical exertions to prepare us for more.
Victor breathed softly, as his hand reached out to caress Sherlock’s face, stroking gently down his jaw to his chin. This could only end badly, so why the fuck was he here? To punish himself…to prove how low he could go and that John was better off without him.
They both turned around at the sound of a key scraping in the front door.
“Not you mother?”
James picked himself up from where he was, still slumped against the locker where Sherlock had thrown him, rubbing his knuckles.
“What the hell was that?”
Sherlock switched off as Victor continued to bitch and moan, he sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed, stumbling to his still packed case and flipping it open to hunt for his school shirt and trousers. He thought about John as he peeled off last night’s clothes and dressed again in his uniform. They smelled like John’s bedroom and his hair like John’s cheap shampoo. He tossed them in the open case. Tossing them in the hamper with the dirty washing felt a little too much like losing a piece of himself. It was fucking annoying, no-one ever got under his skin like this. Maybe he should text and sack off the Friday date before he got in any deeper.
“Yes”, John smiled, “That’s exactly what I mean. Here…”, he fumbled on the floor for his own crumpled jeans, pulled his phone out of the pocket and tossed it across the bed. It bounced and landed in his lap. “Ring yourself, save the number…I have no idea how work will go this week, but can I see you Friday? That is if you haven’t already got plans…with your friend”.
Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and pulled him off to the side ignoring Greg’s suspicious glances and bemused expression. Peterson just chuckled fondly and shook his head, used to Sherlock’s whirlwind mind and eccentricity, here one minute and gone the next, dashing off wasn’t even odd behaviour considering some of their previous encounters. Inside he was reeling, this was getting more and more fucked-up by the minute.
John’s hand squeezed lightly at Sherlock’s arm. “Dad, this is Sherlock, Sherlock, this is my Dad, Graham.”
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you”
to impress?”
There were already a few groups of punters, dotted around the premises, clutching drinks and chatting animatedly, the current noise level still allowing for audible conversation. Greg, who had managed to pull the van in through the open gates at the back began carrying equipment through to the stage area.
“Check for watermarks and lipstick, because even this badboy can’t shift all the bloody make-up” he patted the huge chrome machine fondly as John picked up the first glass and held it up to the light. “No need to be too fussy” Sol winked, “Most of the guests will be plastered before we even have to worry about them”.
“I know what we can do….just stay like that”
They dragged their feet as they descended the steps, each as reluctant as the other to let these last precious moments of solitude go, the rest of the world intruding on their secret idyll.
The dutiful friend would stay and hold her hair back while she vomits in the sink in the ladies room, and see that she gets home safe.
I looked down to see my own cock exposed, so hard and erect it almost stood to the vertical, foreskin retracted to bare its bright red head, a drop of pearly moisture already glistening at the tip. The feel of John against my back yet fully clothed made me feel so filthy and wanton, and yet more so when he reached down and cupped my full heavy bollocks to cradle the weight of them in his palm. He teased and pressed the hot, tight globes within their puckered shell, shifting and retreating by turns and sending blinding shocks of pleasure from root to shaft of my tortured cock.
At this point Sherlock should have apologised, at this point John should have turned and walked away. They did neither, just stood there, as their breath ghosted white in the night air, staring one another down.
But still, it did nothing to lessen the ache in my heart, for you see, I believe I loved my sweet innocent John right from the very start.
John felt a sudden absence of bony chin as Sherlock lifted his head to squint into the dark.
He reached for his phone and switched it to camera, pressing down just as John turned a little towards him, a perfect profile of his cock and bare arse.
“Stupid fucking sexy elf costume” John muttered to himself, glad of the rotund, padded belly currently covering the growing bulge in his pants.
Warm fingers ghosted across his lips, and paused, running over the crusted split.
Sherlock was completely unmoved when he observed the large black, executive car parked just off campus. Mycroft couldn’t resist the urge to interfere and this was not a task to be undertaken by one of his minions. As he approached, the rear passenger door opened wide to receive him, Mycroft sitting stiffly on the leather seat, ridiculous umbrella between his knees, point pressing into the carpeted floor.
“The hell you are”, John growled and dragged his head back down again, sucking on Sherlock’s full bottom lip and nipping at the swollen flesh until it stung. Sherlock pushed his hands under the back of John’s shirt, and ran his nails down the smooth warm skin, digging in just a little too hard until John got the message and pulled back, his kisses turning soft and languid.
Oh god, why was he even asking that? Sherlock was his friend, his
I could not answer, for I barely knew how this came about myself. It could be a look, the way a person held themselves, an item of clothing, a gesture, a moment’s hesitation in a pattern of speech. They spoke to me, these human puzzles and I could see in my mind how all of the disparate pieces came together to form the picture, the whole. It had grown, this knowledge, these feelings, every day we spent wandering the streets of the city and could feel it in my bones now, this filthy and glorious place, every scent on the wind, every sight and every sound, knew where we were eyes closed through the soles of my boots and could feel every pulse of its beating heart.
I'm deviating from the plot of the original text for now - for reasons that will soon become clear!
“I’m sorry John” he says
Five minutes. Ten minutes. Fifteen.
It was Charles. “My friends!  The doors are barred, none leaves but to the satisfaction of the Runners and the grave news I bear is Lestrade is among them. You will not go unnoticed.”
“Chelsea”, I said simply, and Tom looked at me aghast.
“Fuck John” he groaned, hopelessly turned-on, his erection trapped under the weight of John’s arse. He reached up hesitantly to cup his face.
“Yes, thank you my good man” Sherlock said, in a posh haughty voice “I do believe this young lad just saved my life” The copper looked down at him sprawled on the ground in an equally dishevelled state, not believing a word of it, but not about to contradict the wealthy young gentlemen currently shaking pieces of straw out of his hair.
Greg smirked at that, raising another small smile in return from John because Mycroft never, ever swore. They heard the sound of impatient feet and the door opened wide before them, Mycroft standing with his tie askew and the buttons of his waistcoat undone, his jacket slung over the back of a chair in the corner, forgotten, alongside the ubiquitous umbrella.
John remembered the bunch of keys from the bowl.
“Where?”
“Sherlock?”, John hissed at my shoulder, “What is it?”
That just left the underwear, plain black wrapping concealing the best fucking Christmas present he had ever had in his life, even better than the Raleigh Chopper bike of 1983 or the second-hand ZX Spectrum of 1985, the last present he got from his dad before he died.
“Quite”, said Mycroft, “any armchair doctor could have told me as much”, and then he turned, the doctor effectively dismissed as irrelevant and spoke to Sherlock again, “Not even gender?”
It was Sherlock’s turn to squirm uncomfortably, unable to meet Victor’s challenging gaze. He had found his Achilles heel, his greatest fear. John knew a little now after Mycroft’s little stunt, a bit of casual sex, a sneaky joint, and he had accepted that, defended him even, while acknowledging it was a bit not good. But all the rest? The junkie? The whore? He only hoped his little act this morning hadn’t been too convincing….it was a ticking time-bomb and he was simply delaying the inevitable.
Of course John wasn’t some naive idiot, and given the timescale involved it didn’t take a massive mental leap to work out just who Sherlock might have been ‘not just sleeping’ on the mattress with, and although John knew it was none of his business the thought of it still stung.
He wasn’t sure what to say next.
“Get up you prat…help a bit Jesus Sherlock”
“Well, you’ve been rather obvious, don’t you think?” Sherlock smirked, and as if he could read John’s mind added, “And he isn’t my boyfriend, just so you know, I didn’t lie to you back there. Victor’s barely what you could call a friend. We just happen to move in the same circles and it suits my purpose to keep him around for now.”
‘Very well madam, done, you drive a hard bargain’
As if he’d read John’s mind, Sherlock grasped the headboard in his right hand and the banging stopped. But this only meant he had the leverage to thrust back faster, bouncing wildly in John’s lap. He didn’t seem to care that his own erection bobbed neglected and achingly hard between them. It was the least he could do, John thought, taking in the cock bobbing temptingly in front of him. He reached between their bodies, and curled his palm around the shaft, matching his pulls to Sherlock’s thrusts.
“Oh fuck off Sherlock, you were a rampant little cock-tease long before I came on the scene, so don’t try and pull that shit with me”
me again…
He even changed the sheets, deciding the old ones were sporting far too many questionable stains, and then, finally he reached behind the wardrobe, into a space barely wide enough to fit his skinny arm and drew out an A1-size black Art Portfolio.
“Walter”
It's the Christmas dance at school tonight and Irene challenges Sherlock to a game - kiss the object of his fantasies under the mistletoe.  (Teenlock)
“Really? You have to ask? Come on, it’s hardly The Kings Road around here….whatever you don’t mind getting soaked in beer or me ripping off you later”, John grinned and grabbed a towel from the end of his bed heading towards the door and the bathroom. Sherlock picked a t-shirt in faded grey, one of three, almost identical and pulled it on.
Gently, slowly he began to move down John’s body, pressing soft kisses down his jaw and neck, licking along the collarbone and pausing to nibble gently on each nipple, sucking and flicking with the tip his tongue until they stood firm and erect. John clutched at his head, fisting handfuls of soft dark curls as Sherlock worked him over until satisfied with the soft shivers and moans.
“I provide transport…if that helps seal the deal”.
, but which from this distance looked like an angry slash of black cut deep into the stone. John shivered. There was a definite something about this place, an unreal, almost dreamlike quality. Who knew what lay beyond that dark, gaping doorway? Well, Sherlock, for one thing, who had disappeared from view again, his lanky shape swallowed by impenetrable shadow. John held his breath for a heartbeat, ears straining to hear any sounds of movement from inside, and he let it all out in a huff of relief as Sherlock called to him with an impatient, “Oh do hurry up and come in John, before it starts to rain again.”
“Who are you?” he said, because suddenly, that seemed important, if he was going to do this, smoke a joint in a bedroom at a party, with someone he’d only just met. John decided it was a perfectly reasonable question under the circumstances. The boy raised an eyebrow at him this time, instead of rolling his eyes and it was just as fucking irritating as the first time. There was a faint bruise on his very prominent right cheekbone, green, the edges fading to a sickly yellow, with an attitude like this it hardly came as a surprise, a punch in the face was probably a regular occurrence.
‘Do you know how it is done?’ he said in a low voice as he parted my lips with his thumb. I nodded my head in answer, I was not so much an innocent as that and to pretend otherwise would be wrong. He shifted his weight to roll on top, and pushed legs out to the sides so that he could lie fully between, joined along the length of our bodies, a thin film of sweat adhering to our clammy skin. He could feel me tense beneath him at the feel of his cock at the top of my thigh, so close to that part of me which he sought to penetrate, spread wide and vulnerable exposing my virgin hole.
Oh god, the noises he was making, throaty little moans, squeezing and flicking his own nipples with his free hand, rolling and pinching between finger and thumb. God, he was so fucking shameless John thought, sitting up to watch. He wrapped his left hand around Sherlock’s blood-red prick and slowly began to pump, long and slow at first, Sherlock slowing his frantic little bucks and moving in time with each stroke, feet planted firmly against the floor for purchase, thrusting up. John moved faster, quick and shallow around the head, a flick of a thumb across the slit and a twist of the wrist on the upstroke. He could feel the vibrations as Sherlock’s thighs began to shake, legs lifting from the floor to wrap tightly around John’s back as he leant over him.
“Never pegged you as one for
“You must spend a lot of time here,” John said.
He picked up the t-shirt anyway and rubbed absently at his skin as he settled cross-legged in front of his lap-top screen. John yanked the duvet off the bed and padded over to sit down beside him. Sherlock had bright red marks on his shoulder blades to add to his collection of injuries, the result of being pinned on a hard wooden floor. He was sure Sherlock would get his own back in time. John spread out the soft material to cover them both leaning a little against Sherlock, still needing to be close.
Just knowing what this slutty little elf had done was enough to undo the last of his resolve. He gave in, and crushed their mouths together in a bruising kiss. Sherlock smiled against his mouth and parted his soft, full lips, working his tongue inside with evil intent, licking and stroking and orally fucking him until John was helplessly gasping for breath, arms pinned to his sides by Sherlock’s slender hands.
What the hell was Mycroft trying to achieve, throwing them into each other’s paths again when the last time they had seen each other they had….they had?. Sherlock couldn’t even bring himself to think about it, wished the whole sorry incident would delete itself from his memory. And John, how was he supposed to feel about this?, it was so fucking unfair. Sherlock didn’t give a shit about a bunch of dirty pictures taken without his knowledge or consent, whoever it was could go ahead and do their worst. But Mycroft obviously had it in his head that it was someone from their inner circle, and possibly Victor himself which was patently ridiculous, and so he proposed to use Sherlock as bait to draw whoever it was, out.
“She was convicted of aiding and abetting a known felon in an American court of law and sentenced to fifteen years in a Florida jail, no chance of parole”
“Maybe later…we could try that, if you still wanted too?”
John tumbled in after him, and the van sped away into the night.
The guy nodded, “Okay…don’t you even want to know my name… I’m John by the way…not that we have to be on a first name basis or anything…”
The door opened abruptly, revealing a nightmare in a pink velour tracksuit who glared at them angrily, her gaze settling on Sherlock, propping himself lazily against the door frame.
“Just some drunk idiots getting a bit lairy” Elsa shrugged
And Greg would be there the whole time, tugging on his sad middle-aged dick while he pictured Sherlock’s come-face, something he was under the strictest instructions to never, ever do.
“You mean it’s not always like that …for you?” John answered, stuck between sarcasm and genuine curiosity. Surely Sherlock’s….much greater…experience, would find John a bit…unpractised and clumsy in his attempts?
“And neither do you, you stupid bloody idiot” John pressed a hand to his chest and pushed back, “Why can’t you just go home Sherlock?”
Sherlock lengthened his stride and turned back impatiently when he didn’t follow straight away
Once there were two flights of stairs, and a very loudly slammed and locked door between them, Sherlock finally felt the knot in his chest unfurl. He dumped his bag and flopped down on his back on the bed, pulling his phone from his pocket.
Greg winked at him, before setting his eyes back on the road ahead. Dimmock blushed furiously on John’s behalf and Anderson, turning his nose up, snorted, in obvious disgust. Sherlock bristled angrily beside him and John could feel the vicious tirade just waiting to fall from his lips. He had a good idea of how much Sherlock hated Anderson, and it was obviously mutual too, this constant stream of snark between them served as testimony to that fact.
The door crashed open, smacking off the wall and rebounding back again, stopped dead by the strong steel point of an extremely expensive umbrella. John jumped guiltily startled by the sudden noise as Mycroft Holmes strode into the room eyes casting wildly around. He looked ruffled and a little sweaty like he’d just been running, breathing a little faster than normal, almost unrecognisable compared to the immaculate, dangerously poised man John had come to know. He glared at John, clicked his tongue in obvious disapproval before striding across the room, kicking the discarded packets aside and slamming the window shut with a crack.
“Anyway Sherlock, we all know what you were doing last night, you look like a vampire attacked your neck, and there was that embarrassed looking blond kid at UCL Student Union. Doesn’t take a fucking genius to work that one out”.
“One” he huffed
“Outside of Winchester there is little indeed”, she turned away from me to address him in my stead, confounded by my air of hostility which I had so poorly concealed, “I look forward to every entertainment that town has to offer…tell me, will you be at the next masquerade?”
“I have an older brother, Mycroft, he works for the Ministry…he’s spent most of our childhood telling me how stupid I am”
Sherlock sucked in a breath as John eased his fingers around the elastic band and drew it slowly down. He wasn’t going to hurry this, there would only ever be one first time after all. His thumbs brushed against a nest of downy black pubic hair, surprisingly soft to the touch, and even better than that, John could feel the heat from Sherlock’s cock radiating up.
Sherlock thought it prudent to leave at this point as John looked more embarrassed than pleased by the cloying female attention bearing down on him from all sides. He would offer John a way out of their smothering torture and they might get some time to themselves into the bargain, and that was suddenly important, to be alone with him.
He expected a blushing virgin if he was honest, some hesitation once it came down to it, not a one-man fucking tornado who shoved him back on the bed and pinned his arms above his head. Sherlock kissed like he wanted to taste you from the inside out, his tongue searching hungrily around John’s mouth.
He shrugged, “Not really ( because he would admittedly try anything once)…If you think that’s kink John, you’ve led an extremely sheltered life, it’s positively vanilla in the grand scheme of things”
It’s now or never John. His tongue was glued to the roof of his mouth and his lips had gone dry.
The hall was almost full now as the final preparations were made for tonight’s show, the stage already set for the headline act of the night. John felt a shiver of anticipation, as he remembered just how much he loved to watch a band play live.
His look was so intense, for he did not speak only of the violin, he spoke of me aswell, safe in his arms but loved far beyond the measure of my worth I was sure.
The places were not marked, so we hovered in uncertainty around the table, and waited for directions from our host. Charles was to sit at the head, and I at his right, Miss Morstan sat opposite and John beside her to the left. It could not have gone worse.
My breath caught, and Lestrade nodded in satisfaction, “I see, I thought as much”. John looked at me in puzzlement to see me react this way to a name I had not told him of, but why should I have at all? For it was a fiction, an mere invention, William Sherringford did not exist, a name made up by two young boys in a game ten years ago or more. We liked to pretend Mycroft and I, that our rich and invisible sibling, William Sherringford would come for us and mama one day and take us to his castle or abroad, far, far away where father would never find us. He did it for me, a frightened little boy with split lip and a black eye who’d roused his father to fury by the simple fact of his existence.
Sherlock watches John across the room. He laughs, and drinks and curls his arm protectively around his girlfriend Mary’s waist.
“Who the fuck are you?”
‘And when I come to it sir, will you take your turn?’ I arched my brow in defiance.
Emotion was a burden, and it tore at his very soul, it had to stop, make it stop, make it stop….
“Are you high? Been at the Euphoria Elixir again Anderson? Cause if this is some sort of wild goose chase and we get caught, I’m going to kill you in the slowest and most painful way that I can find…how about we start with the Furnunculus curse….. fancy a facefull of boils?”
“Floor…the tattoo, he was the one who stuck the knife in my back…wait…the other one, I recognised him too…the bloke from the alley, the one you kneed in the balls, Trent something or other, he was the one sent to look for you that night I got a kicking but you were….well, he didn’t find you”.
John stood, looking very small and uncomfortable in a pair of Sherlock’s breeches, turned up at the bottom and a simple white shirt. Sherlock thought he looked breath-taking and quite the young gentleman. There was no reason for him to hang his head like that as if he wasn’t every bit as good as anyone else here.
No need to test that theory yet, apparently.
“Sebastian, you must regale us all with some suitably embarrassing tales of Sherlock’s Hampdon exploits. I’m always the last to hear all the salacious schoolboy gossip, I can assure you”
So Mycroft was planning a cosy little Friday night get together was he? Ha! He was obviously concocting some fiendish plan to drive John away now that he had become the focus of Sherlock’s attention. Mycroft never could stand not being the centre of the universe the selfish bastard. Anyway, he had Greg, so why should he care so much about who Sherlock was screwing?
You could fuck right on in there, I know I can take it.
“When did you suddenly decide you were gay John? Was our relationship a joke to you, are you having a good laugh now, you and your little boy toy?”
That's when it all went to hell.
They haven’t planned this, didn’t set out to break anyone’s heart, just got high in the park one night, like this and snuck back to Sherlock’s house for a fuck.
“She’s called Dawn, my mum said it’s cause she’s the same colour as the early morning sun” John blushed, because he hadn’t really meant to tell him that and when you put it like that, out loud it did sound a bit ridiculous.
“Hey there gorgeous” she winked, her friends bursting into a volley of drunken giggles, already loaded up before they even hit the bars. Not a bad idea really, Sherlock thought, maybe John had some vodka or something, sink a few shots before they left….
“You just look so good, all tarted up, ready to go out on the lash” the slang term sounded hilarious said in his cut-glass, public school drawl.
“Ah Anthea, the guest list for Friday evening, if you could add the following names please…..”
John turned off the lights in the grotto and fished the keys out of his pocket to lock up. If they didn’t leave soon, someone would come looking and he didn’t exactly trust himself right now.
“John…I…”
“Ah, I see” well, he didn’t see really, it was a bit overwhelming if he was honest and to his shock and surprise it was also a massive turn-on, the thought of being caught fucking Sherlock in a club, and people staying to watch the show. Jesus Christ what the hell was wrong with him?
Sherlock’s sigh of relief was audible and John wondered if he’d ever done this before, brought someone here with such obvious hope that they’d love the place, a place which obviously meant a lot to him, and had those hopes crushed, probably in a cruel way judging by how guarded he seemed.  A spark of irrational anger at whoever that nameless idiot had been ignited in John’s chest.
“And therein lies the mystery I guess,” John teased, bumping shoulders.
He sat down on the bed, now downstairs cause mother couldn’t manage the stairs anymore, and propped her up again, holding the slight weight of her on his left side, lifting careful spoonfuls to her mouth. When the bowl was empty he tucked her back in again and followed Harry up the stairs to bed, a rough sackcloth mattress on the bare floor, snuggled up together to share body heat.
“When I return,” he echoed, a little sadly, I thought. And then the moment passed and his mask fell back into place. His jaw clenched tight again, and with a final flourish, he pressed his hat upon his head, strode across the room, and was gone. The door snicked shut behind him. I tried not to think how much it felt like a goodbye.
Sherlock padded across the room and ripped the covers off roughly, “Get up shithead it’s after eight and you stink of fucking beer”.
“Er hello, are you actually speaking to me now?”
The first thing John observed was that physically, he bore little resemblance to his brother. Sherlock was stunning, aesthetically a work of art, chiselled perfection, and while Mycroft was similarly tall, the sharp edges and angles which made Sherlock so unique were missing, a softer more rounded shape apparent
‘It is what you love, the danger, what you choose…you have had many a blushing young maid in your bed, a man such as you….but yet…few have given you true satisfaction, am I wrong?’
He picked up his bag which had fallen on the floor, and the bottle of Jack Daniels winked up at him, firey hot and tempting. The bitter liquid had become a bit of a crutch lately, a finger to unwind after work had become two, then three, then who the hell cares anymore. John cracked open the seal anyway and took a large slug, tucking the bottle into the inner pocket of his coat.
“He’s just a kid Sherlock”.
“Get these off Sherlock….Christ…
In the end it wasn’t so bad. The officers came to take statements, both of which were scant in detail on the actual crime because Sherlock had no recollection, and the perpetrator had fled the scene and disappeared into thin air before John made it back to the room. John’s only useful contribution he felt, was a description of the cleaner who had held him up for five minutes in the corridor, blocking the way with an industrial polisher for what now, in retrospect, was an unreasonable amount of time. A man, fifties, overweight, brown thinning hair and a lazy left eye, something they might have to ask him about again should it prove pertinent. Sherlock bristled at the suggestion of a sexual motive, a reasonable assumption given the fact he was naked at the time, but Mycroft intervened and the line of inquiry quashed for the time being.
Sherlock started in surprise at John’s worried voice and propped himself up on his elbow, face creased with concern. He wasn’t entirely sure what John was getting at, but hoped it had nothing to do with regret. Deep blue eyes gazed up at him sheepishly.
“Nothing”, Greg laughed hollowly, “well, when I say nothing…the last time was a couple of years ago, but I threw a chair at him and broke his jaw…he’s too scared to come near me now”
Sherlock stood in front of John defensively.
“Look”, John began again, voice softer this time “I got into a fair bit of trouble myself at school, after my Dad died, fighting, arguing with teachers, buggering off in the middle of the day because I couldn’t be arsed with any of it, and it’s just a guess, but I reckon you were trying to get expelled. You, getting caught smoking at school, really Sherlock? They only caught you because you wanted to be caught”
Oh god, yes she did, that was exactly it. She would give anything to take back those words she had said in the seconds before John had left.
I opened the door and entered the silent room, a frozen tableau of the debauched scene from the night before greeted me, having yet to be cleared for the coming day. My eyes adjusted to the dim light, picking out the outline of the outer door and I made my way across, stepping carefully around the debris. Two armchairs sat in front of the hearth, large and squat, framing the last of the dying embers in the grate, and there, in one, my eyes discerned a figure stretched out, legs laid one upon the other quite asleep, abandoned no doubt by his companions as he drank himself into an insensible state. It had happened before, and my mistress was want to leave them be as courtesy, unwilling to throw them on the mercies of the street in such a condition, but with no beds to spare they would rest where they fell and be glad of it.
That was, until Sherlock had put his massive foot in it.
Hiding behind a car was bound to call unwanted attention if they lingered much longer, anyway, so Sherlock pushed up from his crouched position on the pavement’s edge. He was just about to move off, to blend with the other nosy residents behind the police lines when John placed a warning hand on his arm to stop him.
The reaper he was not, but I knew him as soon as he walked through the door. The way he carried himself, not in a military way you understand, but a poise and confidence, the physical presence of a man well versed in the limits of his body and who could use his physicality to devastating effect. He was not a man to be trifled with, but by this I do not mean to suggest he was large or brutish in stature and appearance, for quite the opposite in fact. Constable Lestrade was around five and twenty, with thick black hair and large brown eyes in a kindly care-worn face. He was handsome indeed, tall and lean, which if I did not know of his station in life would presume came from fencing or riding at the hunt, but which really came from chasing and bringing down London’s most notorious criminals. The patrons here knew it, and many a nervous look was cast his way from those who had something to hide. He took his hat off at the door eyes searching, and picked us out in seconds, he strode across the room with a purposeful look and sat at our table without any introduction.
“You’re the one that turned up here…I didn’t ask you to come, so will you for god’s sake just tell me what’s wrong?” he was panting slightly with the effort it had taken to catch up and trying to ignore the curious glances and knowing smirks heading in his direction.
“Do you want something to eat Sherlock? Mum’s made enough casserole to feed an army and there’s loads left”, Harry blurted out before John had the chance to shout at him about buggering off without telling him where the hell he was going. Sherlock nodded and Harry set a bowl on the breakfast bar in front of him, ladling in a generous amount of the hot filling stew. John’s heart sank. It was a measure of how bad things must be that Sherlock attacked the bowl like a ravenous wolf, he was never hungry and always shrugged off John’s attempts to get him to eat more, unless it was a case of the munchies of course.
“Yes, but that was when he had a little brother called Sherlock who was the apple of his eye and softened his heart”
“My shoulder…my scar…it’s….”
John is a grumpy department store Santa and Sherlock is the very distracting new elf.
“Shall we go to your room and talk? This is embarrassing enough without anyone else walking in” Sara said as she sniffled and hiccoughed. John thought of his three other flatmates who hadn’t yet appeared and silently agreed. But not his room for god’s sake! John thought about a used condom lying somewhere on the floor under a pile of dirty clothes, and an unmade bed that probably stank of sweat and sex.
Talk about jumpy – what the hell was wrong with him tonight? He was a walking bag of nerves.
“Aren’t you always? I doubt if I’ll even notice the change”
“Yeah” John admitted sheepishly.
They both slipped down into darkness.
He left instructions for John, and reluctantly turned to go.
He crested the slope and barrelled towards them, hands held up, knowing that any stranger in this barren land would be treated as suspicious until proved otherwise. It wouldn’t do to take a chance and risk being shot again. My god, it’s Bill, he thought, Bill Murray, my second in command. Bill extracted a knife from a sheath strapped to his calf and split the material of the lightweight fatigues that were soaked through with blood. A young lad, early twenties lay semi-conscious with his head propped up against a filthy kit bag. Even from a few metres away, John could see it wasn’t good as the ground turned dark around the prone form, as blood pumped from a gash in his thigh. The boy was bleeding out, only a few hundred yards from camp.
“It’s also a serious criminal offence” said Sherlock drily, “But I’m still fucking doing it. You heard what’s in store for her husband Frank? Do you think people like that would just let her go on her merry little way after offing her husband? We have to at least warn her, if it’s not already too late” he eyed the dark, silent house warily.
It took ten minutes to find a cab that would stop for two teenage boys at midnight. They slumped on the seat gratefully, out of the cold and out of danger, for now at least. John yawned widely, a mixture of fatigue and fear, the adrenaline wearing off now. Sherlock laid his head on John’s shoulder and sighed deeply.
“Mr dark and chiselled cheekbones”, he turned to Harry, “You might want to wear your noise-cancelling headphones when I bring him home tonight, I’ve got a feeling he’s gonna be loud”.
“Is it working?” Sherlock asked curiously, lifting himself up to peek over the polished wooden surface to where John stood, tea-towel strategically draped from the belt loop on his trousers. “Nice try, but you can still see it from the side”.
“Fuck”, he stuttered, burying his head in John’s neck and biting down on his lip, as he came, “Sorry”.
“Yeah please…so, nineteen tomorrow, how about that?”
I want to bury my face between your legs. Fuck, I could live there. Spread those cheeks apart with my thumbs and bury my tongue in your hot, wet hole. I'd make it wet, make you wet for me. Make you cry and beg while I lick and suck you mercilessly, laving over the pink puckered skin over and over till you scream. Fuck you with my mouth until you're begging at my feet for my cock in your arse.
“And can you tell me where that is?”
“Truth or dare…we always play that at Christmas, remember?”
Well, you’re not wrong there, thought John. His shortness of his temper when deprived of food was legendary.
“They worked though didn’t they? John pulled them back up, snug against his arse, before he wiped Sherlock down with a t-shirt he grabbed from the floor. A bed creaked loudly in the room next door and someone gave a very disgruntled cough.
They had missed the starter, some god-awful pate that Sherlock hated anyway, but were just in time for lamb and minted potatoes, boring, inoffensive, Sherlock thought as he pushed it around his plate absently. He looked up, caught John frowning at him and hurriedly speared the smallest potato he could find and popped it in his mouth, chewing mechanically. Sebastian ignored them both, head down, sawing furiously at his lamb and Sherlock was quite proud that he resisted the urge to point out that the poor beast was already quite dead.
“I might have the answer”, said John, “it’s my birthday next week and I already sort of asked Sherlock if he wanted to go home with me, to meet my mum and sister and stuff”. He looked at Sherlock for approval. They had discussed it, and it was going to happen anyway, just a little bit sooner than either of them had anticipated.
“Well I am” he teased, knowing that exerting a little authority was for Sherlock, a massive turn-on. “Not so sure about you though…you’re going to have to work for it…show me how good you can be for me” the soft little gasp that came from Sherlock’s mouth sent shockwaves of electric heat to his cock, but he only had himself to blame this time.
“Haven’t you heard? There’s a new elf starting tomorrow, that weird looking kid from ‘Home and General’ downstairs has been transferred”
“Oh no Sherlock” Mycroft grasped him tightly by the wrist as he attempted to brush past, “you’ll do just fine as you are, you must come and say hello to Mrs Jessop, she’s simply dying to see you”.
The place stank of old rubbish and piss, he noticed, as water splashed under his feet…he hoped it was water, at least, the air hanging oppressive and damp, sound muffled from the street beyond. He forced himself to breathe in and out in a steady rhythm to calm his terrified body and clear his racing mind, the endless horrific outcomes all too vivid and real, playing like a crime scene montage in his head.
That tonight was some sort of acid test, Sherlock was in no doubt – what else could it be?
“You would deny your own charms?”
Being here is harder than he thought.
“Oh, I think the moment has passed, don’t you?....and anyway, you were right the first time…you weren’t”
Sherlock huffed, impressive Mycroft, so he knew about that night in the study when he got rat-arsed on Mycroft’s finest and asked Victor to take him to bed ( in the ‘indelicate’ sense). He was certain Victor had said nothing because Sherlock had been fifteen at the time, and if Mycroft had sensed anything back then it would all have ended there. So he must have found out later…but how?
“You don’t look the type”.
“Never, you scurvy cur” John swiped at Sherlock with his stick, and they parried back and forth, the wood clacking together, until Sherlock caught John off guard, and his stick went sailing in wide arc. It bounced off a tree-trunk and disappeared into a spiky bramble bush.
He licked into Sherlock’s mouth again and slipped a hand inside his coat to gently squeeze his waist. Sherlock could hear the faltering footsteps, the uncertainty and a scrape of a sole on concrete as the man continued down the street, the snuffling dog following in his wake. It was too nice to stop though, relaxing into the soft slide and plump wetness of John’s lips against his, moving forward as John parted his legs to drag Sherlock into the space in between.
“You should come with a government health warning Sherlock, do you know that?”
“Who the fuck are you?”
Surging forward he caught my mouth in a warm, firm press and pulled me to him. I stumbled a little, off balance, and clutched him around the waist to steady myself and stop from falling into him, held between his spread thighs. His shirt had come untucked from his breeches in the night and my palms made contact with the soft warm skin of his abdomen, fingers brushing against soft downy hair which would surely grow coarser the lower it went. I dared to try and slid my thumb beyond the waistband, where dipping down I stroked back and forth in a soft teasing rhythm, hearing each hitch of breath and feeling his muscles tighten in response. John cupped my head gently and tilted his own to meet my mouth again on a more pleasing angle and I relished the delicate push and slide of his lips against mine, plush and warm .
He couldn’t answer, only cry out, his cock spurting violently as the orgasm ripped him apart. They hadn’t even tried to make it last this time, just took it quick and hard and rough.
It made a change, he wasn’t usually on the receiving end, not anymore. After John he’d gone top, anything else made him feel too vulnerable, and he hadn’t found anyone else he trusted enough to try and bottom.
His abdomen gave a painful twinge and he clenched his thighs together…..oh god… Sherlock needed a piss, badly, from the four cups of vodka and coke he had drunk, but he hardly trusted himself to stand up.
