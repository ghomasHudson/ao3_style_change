Alastair liked to call him a girl. Never 'woman,' always 'girl,' and that distinction shouldn't have made Dean shudder and weep, but it did. Oh, it did. Not, frankly, that there was a shortage of things in Hell to make him shudder and weep. That was sort of the point, after all.
Dean brings the glass back to his lap, cradles it there. “I mean - ” He sighs, jiggles his knee so the tiny bloody sky in his cup shatters into garnets. “Do you know what today is?”
Even if tonight doesn't go how she plans, she'll still probably get it. Cas is great like that.
"What class?"
So it turns out Jack's friends are cool, actually, not that Dean would be caught dead admitting that.
“Today. It’s happening today. I guess - goodbye.”
, Dean Winchester is always
“Forty years, Cas. Forty years. That’s what today is.”
He sinks further down in his seat. “Maybe.” He didn’t forget, he just simply didn’t have time. He had to help Sam with his math homework, and then he needed to make John dinner and tuck the both of them into bed. It was cram for the test or grab a few extra hours of sleep, and what, Dean thought he’d do fine. He does. Usually. Or he did. When he actually knew the material.
"Oh, really? How did you know he was talking to Dean?"
"I didn't ask," says Jack, "but they get most of their clothes at thrift stores. I can ask them next time I see them."
Dean speaks around Cas’s finger. “That’s just playing dirty.”
Dean makes a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob. “You must hate me.”
Cas lifts an arm and Dean snuggles under it. Cas starts tracing patterns on his back through the cloth. “You really believe all that?” Dean asks.
“Well, we’re not in any hurry,” says Dean. The pancakes are starting to pull up a little at the edges, but they aren’t forming bubbles yet.
"She left?"
Okay, Dean seems rather urgent, but that hardly merits waking him up at - he cracks an eyelid at the alarm clock - three in the morning.
"When did Jack start calling you Mom?" Cas asks as they're getting ready for bed that night.
No, urgent isn’t the right word. Desperate, maybe? That’s better. “In the morning,” he mumbles.
When Dean Winchester is fifteen years old, Castiel’s superiors start paying attention to him again. (You’ve gone soft,) they taunt, whenever Castiel tries to bring Dean Winchester comfort. (Look at you, already halfway fallen.)
"You should know that Ms. Masters is famous for giving out apalling grades," Cas says as they start walking again.
On Dean’s fortieth birthday, he pours himself a glass of wine and takes it into the backyard to watch the stars. He settles on Cas’s favorite lawn chair and adjusts his glasses on the end of his nose. He really ought to invest in a telescope this year.
“God, love, no, shh.” Cas scratches a hand up and down Dean’s back. “You weren’t in Hell. Promise. I was here the whole time, and you weren’t in Hell.”
.” He shakes his head. “And the things I
You have never known grief like this.
Cas laughs. “No playing dirty, then?”
As always, there’s no response. Dean gives the star a bitter smile.
” he says, like it’s obvious - which, Dean thought it was, but what does he know? “What do I
Dean shifts uncomfortably. "I want - a dress," he says, and it's like this great pressure valve has been released in him. "I want dresses and skirts and for you to call me 'pretty' sometimes. I want to be pretty sometimes. I don't want to change my name but I want to be your girl. I want to grow out my hair, not much, but enough that I can put beautiful things in it. I want to be 'she' sometimes."
“No, no, stop, please, God, please, stop, no! No, no, help, somebody help, I can’t do this any long - aaaaaa
Dean glanced at her, then back to the road. "I thought we covered this already."
"I know, love."
"Hey, Cas," she says. "Want to marry me?" She didn't get a ring or anything. Didn't plan this out that far. But this is the man she's going to spend the rest of her life with. They might as well make it official.
John forgets Dean Winchester’s sixth birthday. Dean Winchester can hardly blame him. Sammy is one and a half, after all, an age which John terms “maximum mobility, minimum judgment.” Dean Winchester doesn’t know what those big words mean, but he does know that it means his birthday is the last thing from Daddy’s mind.
"You’re 18. Old enough to be his legal guardian."
"None of your fucking business, that's what."
“‘You know what wine is, Cas? It’s grape juice for old people. Boring people who have decided they’re too old to enjoy good alcohol.’ 'Nobody actually likes wine, they just kid themselves into pretending they do. Have a scotch or something else that’s actually classy.’” He pauses for a moment. “I could go on.”
"Oh, c’mon, you need to let me live vicariously through your grades, buddy. I got an 84, man. You can’t have done worse than that."
A look of sudden understanding came into the bartender's eyes. "Is this your first time in a place like this?" he asked.
"Bye, Batman!" Dean Winchester calls at the tree as they go inside, and Castiel lets himself believe that the child is talking to him.
It takes more out of Castiel than he should probably give up, but he manages to take four dollars out of a local bully’s pocket and slide it under the door of the motel room. John comes home the next day.
It’s not Heaven that Castiel wants to see, of course, but she can’t know that.
“I was a whiny little butt, wasn’t I?”
Cas feels his skin knit back together beneath Dean’s lips. Dean’s eyes go wide with shock.
But he’s been human long enough - he’s dreamed often enough - that he can tell the difference between dream pain and real pain. And this? This shattered wailing in the corner of his head, this incoming tide of glass in his heart? This is real.
"I know. You want to get out of here?"
"No," Dean Winchester says, pawing at her fringe-covered jacket. "I’ve got to - my brother - "
"Dean." Dean startles when Eileen touches his hand. "Are you okay?"
person -
She made a face. "They don't want me here."
Dean sobs, just once. “Cas, finally.” He’s still clinging to Cas’s shoulders, though they’re both upright. “God, I thought - “
They let him go abruptly, after that. Something has changed.
"About what?" asked Jack. They were sprawled on the big leather sectional in the Dean cave. It was Jack's turn to pick the movie, and he kept glancing at Dean out of the corner of his eye as though he were seeking approval.
All Cas can think about is the look on Dean’s face - broken and angry and absolutely, chillingly lethal. It’s like nothing he’s seen before, not since he first saw Dean in Hell all those years ago.
Sam shifts a little, looking uncomfortable. "I don't... I didn't remember at first. Do you remember?"
Dean can’t help but shake his head at his retreating back. It’s been... a long, long time since someone called him ‘mom.’

Castiel is there the night Dean Winchester is born. He’s a breach baby, stubborn from conception, so they need to birth him via C-section. Castiel hovers in the corner of the room, invisible to the human eye, but the doctors and nurses can certainly feel the anxiety rolling off of him in waves. It would not be good for Michael’s vessel to be born imperfect.
“Maybe he doesn’t hate you.” Flick. Cas’s forehead splits against the concrete. “Maybe he even likes you.” The demon flips its hand around and lays Cas flat against the floor. It perches over him, trails a possessive hand down his cheek. “Maybe he
“But” - his voice catches in his throat - “tell me what I am now, now that the majority of me is life instead of death. I don’t - I can’t remember what it’s like to be more human than demon.”
That doesn’t stop Castiel from curling up around Dean Winchester like a cat, whispering comfort in his ear the way he has always done. Dean Winchester, in this moment, doesn’t push Castiel away. He leans deeper into the embrace, and Castiel supports him with his full heart.
viii.
Sam pouted. He started to pull his toast into pieces. Dean flinched a bit with each crumb that fell on the floor. "Where is she? It's not fair. I want a mom."
He’s so distracted that he doesn’t notice, at first, when someone slips something into Dean Winchester’s drink. It doesn’t really register until a woman, sharp-toothed and brown-eyed, leads Dean Winchester by his hand out to her car. He dithers for a minute, certain that Dean Winchester would want him to stay and keep an eye out for Sam - but Dean would never leave with Sam still at the bar. That’s how Castiel knows something is wrong.
He puts it together the next night, when Dean Winchester leaves the motel room in Sam’s shorts and a too-old, too-tight T-shirt to wait next to a seedy gas station. He tries to intervene, but Dean Winchester won’t let him.
"Yes?" Cas prompted.
He was right.
Castiel is there the night Dean Winchester is born again. He starts as a pile of bones and half-rotted skin, curled on its side to fit in the pine box of its coffin. He ends as a creature of flesh and bone with a handprint on his shoulder, eyes still gleaming with both the flames of Hell and the light of an angel.
Something seizes cold in Dean’s bones. He loves Jack. Hell, Jack’s his kid.
“That was one of their favorite things to do. They’d give me bread that turned to flesh in my mouth, wine made of my own blood. And god, I was so thirsty, I drank anything. I’d probably have eaten Sam if he stood still long enough.”
“Don’t call me that.”
If he didn’t know better, he’d say he was dreaming.
He lands in the fragile shell that sits between Mary Winchester’s legs. He stretches and wiggles its fingers, to get the blood circulating, and then he travels up the umbilical cord a ways and fetches the lagging soul. (I’m tired!) he complains, but Castiel ignores him and drags him until he can deposit it squarely in Dean Winchester’s body.
A woman on a mission, he had to respect that. "You live far from here?" He was already up and moving.
Oh, he
“I don’t need” - Dean’s voice breaks. “Why are you telling me this?”
He’s absolutely certain he’ll die if he hears him call him “sir.”
"The booze at my place's free."
Cas didn't seem to care at all. No, that wasn't quite right. He cared: he cared all over the damn place. He must have meant it, 'happiness is the saying,' because he said it. By god (or, no, not god anymore - ), he said it. "I love you," when Dean passed him coffee in the morning, "I love you," when Dean left to get groceries, "I love you," over the corpse of a vampire who had been stringing up hikers in an isolated part of an Indiana forest.
He’s crying now, not even bothering to hide it. “I thought I was out, I honestly thought I was out. When I heard Dad’s voice I - but there was nothing. I got less than a month left on this Earth, and I thought I was resigned to that, but - oh, fuck, hope sucks, okay? Just strike me from existence already, that would be better for all of us. Fuck this.
"Anything," Cas says.
The first time he died, you didn’t have time or inclination to grieve. There was an apocalypse to stop, and despite his last minute change of heart, he had been integral in causing it. By the time you considered honoring his sacrifice he was already back. (You still hear him in your dreams, sometimes:
"I remember," Dean repeats. "I didn't know you did."
"Can you be a mom? Mollie's mom is a grown-up, and a girl."
“Well, Heaven loves crucifixion. He crucified me thirteen times before I finally caved. He did it in all sorts of interesting ways, too. Upside down, sideways, nails through my stomach and thighs. Once he rigged the cross to spin, and whenever the blood rushed to my head and I thought I might finally faint he sent it whirling around to revive me.”
"Just the usual." They're both silent for a long moment. "Do you think - " Dean's voice cracks. "What do you think my mom would think?"
"I mean, do I tell everyone?" Dean asks. "Do I change my name to Deanna and walk around in dresses and skirts all day and start - shit, what did Jack's friend call it? - hormones? Do I chop off my dick and go buy some boobs? I don't have an instruction manual for this, Cas."
Jack sighs the sort of dramatic sigh that vividly reminds Dean he's barely four. “That’s your
"It is for me."
Castiel reaches his hand further and grasps Dean Winchester’s shoulder. (It is truly I, Dean Winchester.)
"Yes," Jack says like it's nothing. "I spilled some soda on mine and Marta let me borrow this."
Sam and Cas sleep in, now that they can get away with it, but Dean’s still up at the crack of dawn. He’s gotten to a place where he doesn’t mind it, so much, the quiet of the bunker kitchen as he prepares breakfast. Once or twice a month Eileen joins him and they experiment with some weird waffle technique or wild new pancake flavor, but usually it’s just him and his tools and his hands and the low crooning of his speaker turned way down. It’s become a part of his routine. He has a routine, now.
"A point for Sherlock."
It was a ridiculous thing to fixate on. Cas and Bobby were dead. Sammy was well on his way. The world was on track for another fucking apocalypse already, not even a year after they'd stopped the last one, and there wasn't a single thing on God's green earth Dean could do to stop it, and there were ballet shoes in the back of the Impala.
“Now, we both know that’s not the case. You’re obviously better.”
Oh, he does recognize it. “Go ‘way, Dean.”
So he cared. He just didn't care in a way that expected Dean to care back. He said it to Jack and Sam too, as though this most recent death seemed to have unlocked something in him. Whatever thing inside of him had stopped him from speaking about his love - whatever Winchester-ness had rubbed off on him, Dean reflected ruefully - was just... gone.
Cas’s hand stills in his hair and he reaches out to grab Dean’s chin instead. “Look at me, love.”
After an indeterminable amount of time, Dean’s eyes don’t change back from green. “Cas,” he gasps, a single broken breath.
The demon shrugs elaborately. “Well, so you called my bluff. It doesn’t matter.” He twists a hand by his side and Cas rises into the air.
"Actually, yeah," the bartender said. "There's been a draft by the corner table all week. Should give you a pretty good view of the stage, too."
? Would he ever have told you? Or would he have just stood at your shoulder for the next ten years, the next twenty, your silent ever-watching shadow, content to love and love and do nothing with it?
Okay, then. "Yeah, still a she," Dean says, voice muffled by Cas's body.
He knows better than to try stopping Jessica Moore’s burning. It will only draw the attention of angels, attention that is better not drawn.
“I’m just a waste of your time.”
She raised her eyebrows. "Want to try them on?"
Dean pokes the arrow onto the 'he' side and pins it to his chest. "I don't... really know what to say, Jack. Thank you. You're a good kid."
"Dean," Dean said, before he thought better of it.
Dean bit his tongue hard but the tears spilled over anyway. He dashed them away with the back of his hand. At least Dad wasn't here to see. (Men don’t cry, he'd say. You’re a man, aren’t you, Dean?) "Dead means she's not here anymore," he said.
anymore."
There were other ways he could get the money, probably, but this was fast and it was under the table and that was what he needed. He'd spent his whole damn childhood in motels, usually the seedy pay-by-the-hour kind that attracted this particular clientele anyway. John taught him the ins and outs of ganking monsters, but the men and women who watched Dean while he was gone taught him how to move through a world that viewed him as a thing. He had always known this was a possibility. He was kinda shocked it hadn't happened sooner.
God, Dean's going to drown in tears one of these days. "Thanks for not lying to me. Saying something about how it wouldn't change anything, or how she wouldn't care." A beat. "Dad would fucking flip."
Dean met Rhonda in a karaoke bar in Cincinnati, not long after the whole prostitution thing. He was there for the cheap drinks and the piss-poor ID checks. She was there for her cousin's bachelorette party. She strode over to him after they'd both been there for maybe two hours. "You've been looking at me," she said.
"Hiya, Cas," Dean says, and Castiel’s smile grows.
"Ugh," Charlie sighs, leaning towards him across the rows. "Dean, how’d you do?"
Dean gives a tired grin and kisses another one of the cuts on Castiel’s face. He kisses down the arc of his cheekbone, and then along his neck.
“What’s the occasion?” Cas asks behind him. Dean glances back - his husband is silhouetted by the porch light. If he squints, he can convince himself that Cas’s softly fluttering bathrobe is actually a pair of wings.
You’d say, I don’t know.
"Cas."
Mom had been pregnant that Christmas, would've been four-ish months. She'd worn a black velvet dress and kitten heels. The swell of Sam in her stomach was just starting to show. John had driven them in the Impala and dropped them off at the entrance to the theater. Dean didn't remember the actual show, but he remembered waiting outside in the cold for the doors to open, Mary's hand warm in his.
Fuck, fuck, there was nothing for it. Dean swallowed. He swallowed again. He'd been to Hell. He'd faced down demons and the devil and God himself. He could tell the man he loved that he loved him.
“My name is Castiel. I’m here to save you.”
"See?"
"At this point in my life, yes. I would."
Jack's blushing now, and looking at his feet. "Thanks," he says. A beat, then, "Can I hug you, Mom?"
“He’s hurting so much right now. Wants you to kill us before he can hurt you. ‘Anyone but Cas,’ he keeps saying. 'Do anything, but don’t make me hurt Cas.’ It’s
“Dean,” Cas says again. “You’ve already beaten him. Just push a little further.”
"This thing where I'm not always a dude."
The demon’s eyes flicker from black to green and back again. “If you say one more word I’ll - ”
Cas keeps rubbing Dean's back. His hand moves up and down, up and down. "I think Mary loved you very much. I think there were a lot of things about the modern era she found strange and intimidating, but that she never once expressed disgust or shame at the way this country has moved towards accepting others. I think it would have been hard for her to understand, certainly. I can't say she would have reacted well. But I think, given time, she would have realized that you're still you, and I think that she would always love you."
"And now? Would you describe yourself as a man?"
“No - he’s - not - ” Cas grinds out through the demon’s energy clenching his jaw shut.
He is there when Dean Winchester goes to Stanford for his brother, and he is there when their world falls down once again.
“Dean.” The light-creature steps forward, reaches out, fixes a hand to Dean’s shoulder. “Remember me.”
“You’re going to look at me while I kill you, Cas. Dean is going to see the light bleed from your eyes.”
“So. You were the dude who heard all my prayers.”
Castiel knows the instant Dean Winchester stops believing in God. He is nine and a half years old, and an old woman knocks on their motel door to kick them out for the day.
"Speak for your yourself," she says.
"That bad?" someone asks, sliding up next to him.
Dean smiles. “It’s not like you’re setting a high bar for that, though.”
Dean bristled a little at the way she phrased that, 'your' angel. Like he had any claim on Cas at all. (He had, once, but clearly that didn't matter any more.) So maybe he was trying to piss her off when he snapped, "What, 'cause it went so well for you?"
She brushes her hair - it's almost as long as Sam's, now, and hadn't he had a field day with that - and puts in one of those little pearl clips that Eileen got her for her birthday. She puts on her favorite skirt, the long blue one with the geometric print, and she takes him out to dinner.
"Nah." They walked in silence for a while, broken only by the chirping of crickets and the music spilling out of other bars. Eventually, he asked again. "Seriously, what was the deal back there? It seemed like you were having an okay time, at least for a while."
Castiel does not interfere in the death of John Winchester. He watches when the man goes to Azazel, back straight and eyes proud, and he can’t help but feel vindictively glad as he’s sucked directly into Hell.
"So I'm, what, your way of rebelling?"
Sometimes Dean really wishes he didn’t make friends with the smart kids wherever he goes. “86,” he mutters.
"This is my partner, Dean," Cas says, and gestures at their reflection. "She hunts monsters, but she's thinking of retiring and becoming a bartender. Sometimes she forgets how much I love her, so I try to remind her every day. She's not just pretty, she's beautiful. When I pulled her out of Hell, she was radiant. I've never seen anything like her in all my years, and each day I'm astonished that I get the chance - Dean? Are you okay?"
A week after Dean Winchester’s birthday, when Daddy has been gone for four days, the food runs out. Dean Winchester gives the last of it - half a Fruit Roll-Up - to Sam and curls up against the hunger pains that night. Castiel curves up alongside him and tries to breathe comfort into his mind, even though Dean Winchester doesn’t know he’s there. (It’s okay,) he says in light waves too long for the human eye to process. (I’ve got you.)
She smiled at him, that warm smile that made his heart curdle in his chest a bit, because he remembered what it was to love it. "Just to be totally clear, you're giving me free reign?" Her eyes glinted with mischief. His brother was in Hell.
“Why not?” asked Sam. He nibbled on the edges of his toast. Dean didn’t know what they would do for dinner tonight. If Mom was here, she’d know what to do for dinner tonight.
(Thank you,) Dean Winchester says. His thoughts are loud and clear. He knows Castiel knows them, and he’s happy about it. Dean Winchester breathes out his sorrow and fury and terror and breathes in Castiel’s peace and presence. They are one person, twined here together, and despite all the grief of the day, Castiel is content.
The demon flicks its hand and Cas goes smashing face-first into the wall. His lip splits open, and the blood on his tongue tastes like he’s always imagined Dean would.
She wasn't sure how she wanted to do this, at first. She didn't really 'come out' when she got together with Cas, because there was no point. Everyone in her life knew she loved him long before she did. This is different. This is something she hid so deep within herself that she had to
Cas sighs, reaches out to trace a tear down Dean’s cheek. “Dean, love. I already have. I love you so much, okay? I know you don’t - I know you don’t always believe that - that you deserve to be loved, but you do, and I love you. Okay? I promise. I will never, ever leave you again.”
(This is what Hell wants,) he says as Dean Winchester stands at the intersection of two gravel roads. (You are playing into their hands.)
You have never known grief like this.
The demon’s grin curves up at one corner like Dean’s cheek is being cut open with a knife. “Oh, he can hear you,” it taunts. “I just wish you could hear him. Begging, pounding against the walls in his head…. Man, he hasn’t screamed like this since Hell.”
And he will, that's the thing. At some point Dean stopped believing that this is all gonna get snatched away from him. At some point he got so comfortable in this life they've built that he was able to ask himself questions he's gotten through his whole forty-odd years without asking. He doesn't recognize himself when he looks in the mirror, and that's a
“I finally broke the barrier. I’ve been on Earth for longer than I was in Hell.”
"You’re four bucks short of another night, kid," she says. "Is your daddy or mommy around?"
Dean can’t meet his eyes. “I hurt you. I almost - I tried to kill you.”
you?”
Sam blinks at her. Eileen's smile grows wider. Jack says, "Oh, like Portia!" as though she's supposed to know who the hell that is. One of his friends, probably. Every time she turns around he has a whole new social circle. "Is that all you wanted to say, Mom?"
"I never - you know, I'm never going to forgive myself, for what I did to you. What I didn't do for you."
Charlie rolls her eyes as she carefully slots the test into her color-coded folders. “Dean Winchester, did you forget to study?”
God. Dean wasn't sure which one of them was more the cliche. He held up a condom between two fingers. "Blowjob," he said. "Forty bucks." That gave him enough for Sam's test and a bit left over.
"Yeah," he said. "Go for it."
Dean didn't say anything. He'd stopped wanting that a long time ago.
"Mm, it's drag night," he said, like that meant anything to Dean. "You picked a good time to pass through."
“Dean,” he pleads, even though whatever creature is in front of him is so far from the man he loves that he’s almost unrecognizable. “I know you’re in there. I know you can hear me.”
"Yeah? What's the story there?"
Cas reaches out to grab his hand. “I have an idea.”
Dean prostituted himself exactly once. He was almost twenty. Sam was in high school, and needed money to pay for some college placement test, and Dad had been gone for almost three months. Pastor Jim hadn't heard from him, they hadn't spoken to Bobby in years, and Dean wasn't sure that John was even alive. If that was the case, if he was really dead, then Sam needed to take this test, and Dean needed to make it happen.
"Babe," says Eileen, "he didn't sign it."
“You know it is, baby.”
"Yeah, yeah, I know." Mary frowned. "I'm just, I've been thinking. If we find Kelly and your angel, and we do whatever it is we need to do, and there's a
He looks great, really, especially considering how short notice this whole thing was. He's in that blue checkered shirt that makes his eyes look especially vivid, and he didn't have time to shave that five o'clock shadow he gets now he's human. If tonight goes like she plans, she'll get to feel it burn on her thighs.
When the angels finally, finally mount a rescue, Castiel leads the charge.
“You don’t need to. It’s my job, remember? 'With this ring, I give you all of me, all my heart, and all my mind, all my soul, and all my strength.’”
"I suppose that is one way to put it, yes," Cas says.
Dean tastes better than he ever thought.
“Oh, wow, thanks for clearing that up. Here I was thinking we were in Tahiti, I had no idea.”
Jack’s been coming around more often, though, since he rescued Cas and let the rest of the god power go. He crashed hard, after - there was a terrible hour or so where they thought he might not make it at all - but now that he’s got his feet back under him he’s as sunny as ever. Hell, more than.
"Of what?"
. You’re grieving what he wasn’t. You’re grieving what he’ll never get to be.
One day Jack leaves the bunker to visit his friends and comes back wearing a dress. Dean and Eileen are in the main room researching and get to see him clomp down the stairs, the skirt twirling behind him. The dress is long and cottony, a peasant dress, Dean thinks its called, though where he heard the phrase he couldn't say. He realizes he's staring. "You're wearing different clothes," he says, like an idiot.
“You’re very welcome.”
Castiel is there the morning Dean Winchester wakes up alone in a motel that had his father in it the night before. He is there during the frantic phone calls and check ins with the front desk, there while Dean Winchester cries and stops crying and goes out to the Impala - his father left the Impala - and drives.
"I thought you realized too, man," Dean adds.
“You,” he gasps.
"No, Cas, listen," Dean said, and then he stood there for thirty seconds with his mouth gaping open like a fish. He couldn't back down now, but how the fuck was he supposed to follow up what Cas had done for him? "I," he added, then another minute of silence.
"Dean - " Cas stops him with a hand on his arm. "What happened?"
She was quiet for a long moment. "You know," she said at length, "your dad and I talked about trying for another baby, when Sam got a bit older. We thought maybe a sister would be nice for you boys."
(Come,) Castiel commands, and then he flies.
“Uh, hey. It’s been a while, huh? Did you - did you see Ben, earlier? He was so damn brave. I could swear, he looks just like I did at that age.”
Dean nuzzles his neck as Cas starts the movie playing again. “Can I tell you something?” he asks.
Dean has to smile. God, he loves his brother. "Yeah, Sammy," he says. He puts the plate with the hash browns and bacon next to the fruit salad. "I know."
He loves you, he said. You want to drag him back hand-over-hand and smash his face into the wall. How could he? How
"And who’d give a fuckup like me custody of someone like Sam? I can’t even get a job. And it’s not like - you honestly think I could handle responsibility like that?"
"He's been... different," Dean settled on saying. "More..." But he wasn't sure what else to add. "Just different."
She's crying. She's crying again and she can't stop. "Yeah," she says, voice wet. "Yeah, keep going."
“Where was I? I mean, did that reality only exist inside Sam’s head, or was I actually in Hell for six months? Did I actually die all those times? Am I - will I ever remember it? Ha, maybe that’s one of Hell’s tortures. 'Welcome back, fucker.’”
"And this one," Jack says, and his smile is so big and Dean is so goddamn lucky to call him his kid, "is the genderfluid flag." He hands Dean a much bigger sweatshirt with the flag printed on the back. This one might even fit.
“That’s stupid.” Laughter creeps into Dean’s voice.
Dean pulls away slightly. “78.”
“Merry Christmas. 132 days.”
After decades of fighting both the demons of Hell and the demons inside Dean Winchester, Castiel finally finds his Righteous Man. In the time since Castiel has seen him last, his chin and nose have grown into a goat-like snout. Twelve horns of solid smoke rise from his head and down his neck in a crest to rival the proudest birds. His neck and limbs are much longer than they should be, and his too many teeth are sharpened like needles. He stands hunched over most of the time, knuckle walking like a gorilla.
Dean turns.
Castiel roils in the branches of the tree next door. He should rain fire on the house for daring to harm Dean Winchester, but not while there are people inside of it.
Maybe there's something painfully obvious in Dean's voice, because Cas puts his pizza back on its paper plate and sets it to the side. He angles himself towards Dean. "I've been in a female vessel at multiple points in history, yes, but I'm not sure I would have described myself as a woman. At the time I was an angel, and that mattered more to me than human ideas of gender."
There’s a long pause, the only sound the rain pattering on the car roof.
“What do you mean?”
Dean forced a smile. "Nah," he said, "I'm good." It was a lie, but all he'd done for six months was lie. This one would hardly topple the stack. "Just don't make me pick the costume."
"No." He's a little surprised to find it's true. "It might've, once, a long time ago, but I seem to have gotten past that sort of thing." If anything it's an actually positive feeling, this warmth in his chest that makes him feel closer to his own mom. Mary's relationship to motherhood was just as strained and strange as his.
"Yeah, everything's fine," Dean says, and she's still not used to saying that and
“I assume that’s a rhetorical question.”
"What, is that another piece of school lore I missed by not being here for the past three and a half years?"
"Dunno. Sometimes I think Dad might've handled it better. Others I think he might've handled it worse."
"You’re in a bad mood."
Better he think Dean some blushing flower than a snitch, at least. "How could you tell?" He tried for a bashful smile. The bartender shrugged one shoulder.
“And why is that?”
Castiel watches as Dean Winchester’s soul bleeds from his body until the only thing lying on the ground is an empty shell. It’s the day he was born all over again, except now Castiel can do nothing, and Heaven - Heaven is not cheering for him any longer.
If anything he felt kind of... happy? Yeah, the dude was minorly creepy about it, but nobody had called him
Dean’s smile, small and hurting though it is, buoys Castiel so much that he rises through the ceiling.
Cas starts petting a hand through his hair. “I hate your father.”
“Do what?”
“Of course.”
The hand is back on his shoulder, shaking and shaking. “Cas, I need you. Cas, wake up. Goddamnit, Cas, I’m always there for you, just wake the fuck up. Cas. Cas!”
“And what’s that?”
Dean didn't pay attention to the movie, and when Cas came back three days later he met him in the garage. "I've been a coward," he said.
"I'm reserving judgment. Here we are." She showed him into a ground-floor apartment and started taking off her clothes before she even reached the bedroom. By the time they were there, she was down to her underwear, pink panties and a mismatched black lace bra. She clearly hadn't been planning on pulling tonight, and that made Dean feel a little smug. She paused with her bra halfway off. "Like what you see?"
Their waiter approaches with their meals and sets them down. Cas spears one of his shrimp and pops it in his mouth. No time like the present, right?
- you.”
It's a girl day, when Dean calls the meeting. In some ways that makes it easier. She gathers everyone in the Dean cave and can't help but smile at her little family: Sam and Eileen, Jack and Cas. Donna and Jody and the girls are coming into town this weekend, and she'll tell them then, but these guys deserve to hear it first. Well, second, after Cas, who gives her an encouraging smile.
"That's a place to start." Cas smiles encouragingly. "According to the internet, there is no right or wrong way to do this. What do you want? That's what matters."
Things go back to their new normal pretty quickly. Turns out that being a woman sometimes isn't that different from being a man. Dean still wakes up before everybody else and cooks breakfast while he listens to music. She still spends movie nights with her family in the Dean cave, curled up with Cas on the sectional. He still hunts, when hunts crop up, though they're much fewer and further between than they were when Chuck was around. She does end up getting a part-time bartending job, at a new place that opens up in Lebanon. One of Jack's friends runs the place. It's got a big trans flag behind the bar, and Dean wears her pronoun pin to work.
Castiel doesn’t answer, just keeps his gaze on Dean Winchester, who is all the more beautiful for the distance between them. (Hello,) he finally says, and stretches a glowing hand out from the mass of himself. (I am here to take you home.)
Dean laughed, hollow. "Trying to make me feel like shit?"
talk about."
Castiel races to Dean Winchester’s side immediately. He’s in the bathroom of the latest motel, curled up on the floor, crying.
"Won’t even notice you’re gone."
"No!" More tears. Sam didn't seem to care, but Dean was feeling worse and worse. "Dead means she's not
“As long as you let me be sorry for not waking up sooner.”
- is that all this horrific grief choking your throat isn’t even for
Cas finds the word for it online, a few days later. They're curled together in bed. "'Genderfluid,'" he reads to Dean. "'Of, relating to, or being a person whose gender identity is not static. A genderfluid person may identify as male, female, or other genders at various points in time.'" He looks up at Dean. "That seems accurate to me, but obviously you're the ultimate arbiter of your own identity."
He's been thinking it more and more often of late, marveling at this life he finds himself living, one where he can love the people he loves so fully, one where he can face the truth of who he is. It's petty and ridiculous, maybe, when the man himself is long gone, but he can't help it.
He tries to stop Dean Winchester from making the deal, but he won’t listen, and Castiel cannot bring Sam back to life no matter how hard he tries. Some souls lay out of his reach.
A goddamn C.
His superior laughs. (Your Dean Winchester is going to suffer much more than a scraped knee before this is over.)
"And then I get to have a mom?" asked Sam.
Cas works his arms around Dean’s back so he’s supporting most of his weight. He rubs a hand up and down, taking special care to knead the sore spot by Dean’s left shoulder. “Oh, love. You don’t need to find out.”
"I got you an extra large."
"Hey, Cas," says Dean one morning, "you were a woman once, weren't you?" It's just the two of them in the bunker today, and they forewent one of Dean's usual breakfast spreads for cold pizza in bed. It's sticky and greasy and ridiculous and Dean is just about as happy as he's ever been. There's not gonna be a better time to ask this question.
He feels everything that Dean Winchester feels down in the Pit, or at least a distant echo of it. He hears Dean’s screams in his mind, floating through him like Castiel once floated through Dean’s room.
"I think so."
Eileen nods. Cas says, "Yes."
this!
He didn't even really regret it, when she showed him the costume. "It's technically a hers-and-hers," she said, "but I figure the dress is short enough you can wear pants under it and it'll look like a tunic."
"We can do all of that," Cas says, voice soft. He's still smiling at Dean like Dean's some sort of marvel. "Do you want to try some of it now?"
“Today’s the anniversary of my mom’s death. I have six months left. What would you do if you only had six months left? I mean, I guess you’re immortal, whoever you are. You probably can’t say.”
Castiel watches from the corner as Dean Winchester systematically snaps the crayons into pieces. He’s not yelling or throwing things, but he does appear to be very consistently destructive.
He can’t see the star, his star, but he knows it’s somewhere to his left. “God, there are all those books and movies about how people act when they know they’re gonna die. They go to Paris, have great sex, write a book. All the things they wish they’d already done in life. What am I doing? Brooding at a star. God. I’m useless.” He doesn’t say it aloud, but the thought crosses his mind -
Even though it's a guy day, 'Mom' still gives him a funny swoop in his chest. "Of course," he says. Jack dives forward and burrows into his chest, then wraps his arms tight around Dean and squeezes.
He clambers up the tree and starts jumping from branch to branch like a fledgling owlet. Hailey stands below with her arms wide, ready to catch him if he falls, calling warnings every few minutes, but she needn’t worry. When Dean Winchester’s foot slips, Castiel secures it. When a branch snaps, Castiel wraps around it to hold it still. When Dean Winchester finally jumps into Hailey’s arms from the lowest branch, Castiel muffles his fall just enough that Hailey doesn’t stagger at the weight of him.
"Daddy’s in the shower," Dean Winchester says, straight-backed. Castiel turns the shower on to back him up. Dean Winchester jumps at the sound. "And I can have the money by tonight, ma’am." His voice is so small and high-pitched. He doesn’t know how he’s going to get the money.
When Sam was three and a half, thin as a whip and twice as smart, he narrowed his eyes at Dean over the shitty formica table in the motel kitchenette. “Dean,” he said, “are you my mom?”
She grins at him. This is her life, now. She can't believe she's so lucky. "Jack's going to be thrilled."
With a conscious effort he dragged his attention back to the road. Next to him, Sam stared out the window, gaze fixed on something only he could see. He kept worrying at that scar on his hand. "How're you doing, Sammy?" Dean asked softly. He didn't answer.
"It's salt and pepper," he said. Well, it was a white mini dress with a black S on it and a black mini dress with a white P on it, and two flimsy cardboard hats painted silver to look like lids.
"I hardly think that's accurate," said Cas, frowning. "You're one of the bravest - "
“This is stupid, believe me, I know, but - what else can I do? I’m not really looking forward to an eternity of torture - ” His voice breaks again. He stops talking. The star keeps twinkling.
Later, at some point between the Mines of Moria and Treebeard, Dean mutters, “78,” into Cas’s shoulder.
“I woke up this morning and Sam looked so happy to see me. I swear to God that I’m going to kill the shit out of that Trickster. I actually - I’ve got a question.”
“Of course.”
He jumped when the music started, it was so loud. The woman who strode onto the stage first was tall, taller than him, dressed in a powder blue miniskirt and a ruffled white blouse. Her stilettos were long and sharp enough Dean honestly might have chosen them over a knife, some days, and her enormous silver earrings sparkled like a thousand tiny suns. Her voice was low and sonorous. "Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Jupiter's drag night," she said into a microphone. "I'm your host, Ariel Caliban" - there was loud whooping from one particular section of the audience - "and I'm so glad to see you here."
The second time he died, it was over so fast. He was there, then he was gone - Sam was there, then he was gone - and then Cas was back, but you didn’t care, since Sam was still gone. Did he love you then?
Cas sets his computer to the side. "Is this too much? I want to help, Dean, but if you would rather sit with this information for a while, give yourself time to grow more comfortable with it..." He smiles ruefully. "This is somewhat outside of my area of expertise."
She is. "My exact words, Sam, were 'not last I checked.' And I'm laughing because when you asked me, I
"By certain definitions of hero, sure."
The demon slaps him, hard, across the face, and Cas goes flying. He lands halfway across the room, his hands and knees covered in scrapes. He struggles to get to his feet, but the demon freezes him in place before he’s even on his knees. “He hates you, you know,” it says conversationally. It stalks over to him, places a hand on his shoulder. “He’s so glad I’m doing this.”
he? How fucking dare he dump that on you and
He flips the pancakes.
The man who walked over was tall and broad, but nothing Dean couldn't take, especially considering the age spots on his skin and the creakiness of his step. He leered as he drew closer. "What're you offering?" he asked.
Cas pushes himself upright. “I’m here.”
"Shh," the woman whispers in his ear, so quietly Castiel couldn’t hear it if he weren’t bound so closely to Dean Winchester. "It’s okay. Let’s just go back to my place."
“Mom!” he exclaims, like the idea never occurred to him, and... Christ, yeah, Dean should’ve expected him to run with that one. “I’m going to tell Phoebe!” he adds, and runs off down the hall.
"I didn't," says Sam. "Not until last night." A pause. "You never said anything about it."
“Hey, let me finish. I just - I want to say thank you. So thank you.”
“Shh, baby, shh. I can’t what?”
“What did you call your dad?” asks Jack, and -
Before he drove back to the motel, he got himself some celebratory pie at the diner. What the hell? He had the money for it, right?
Dean forced a smile. He was still crying, but if he smiled hard enough maybe Sam couldn't tell. "Tell you what, Sammy," he said, "why don't I be your mom?"
Yeah, Dean didn't say. Me neither.
He curls around Dean Winchester afterwards, in his tiny one-bed motel room. He fills up the whole space, so Dean Winchester can’t breathe without feeling him. (I’m here,) he chants as Dean Winchester cries into his pillow. (I’m here, I’m here.)
"Yeah," Dean says, still staring after Jack. "I'm fine." There is nothing, he realizes quite abruptly, stopping him from going out and buying a dress just like that. There is absolutely nothing at all.
She sticks her tongue out and runs to catch up with Gilda. Dean sighs and pulls the crumpled-up test out of his pocket. He ducks out one of the back doors and tosses it into the ditch that collects all the rainwater. According to Miss Mosely, it was part of a misguided attempt to build a garden three years ago.
“No, I mean - what did you dream about?”
“Okay.” Dean takes a few deep breaths. “I’m sorry. For freaking out.”
"Yeah, it - no. No, just gimme a second." Man up, Dean told himself. Man the
Cas shifts his weight a little, strokes a hand down Dean’s back. “I love you,” he says again. “I’ve always loved you. I’ve loved you since before I knew love existed. I will never stop loving you.”
"Thought you were busy." He gestured towards the group of increasingly intoxicated women she'd come in with.
Sam opens the car door. “Were you talking to someone?” Dean didn’t even notice him exit the rest stop.
The night after she comes out, Dean wakes up at midnight in a cold sweat, certain for one absolutely terrible instant that the past twelve years have all been a particularly vivid hallucination and that she's still in Hell. She breathes past the rushing in her ears to make out Cas's voice, saying, "Dean, Dean. You're okay, Dean." He's rubbing her back. She takes deep breaths in time with his hand. When she's calmer, he asks, "Still a she?"
He thought he was hallucinating, when Sam burst in. He knew it, when Sam exorcised Alastair. The last dying gasp of his pitiful little mind was this, the fantasy he'd indulged in over and over again in Hell: his brother riding in to save him like the shining knight in a fairy tale. (And Dean the princess in the tower, Alastair's
The bell rings and Charlie pops out of her seat like a jack-in-the-box. “Hey, Siobhan and Kristen and Gilda and I are heading to the ice cream place after rehearsal tonight,” she says as they walk out of the room and down the hallway. “You and your boyfriend wanna come? I still gotta meet him.”
Dean Winchester doesn’t talk to him directly for a long, long time.
Even though Castiel knows he can’t hear him, Dean Winchester’s shoulders ease a fraction. That night in his dreams, Castiel lurks at the edges, pruning away the fear and planting hope in its place.
For a second, Dean thinks about playing dumb. 'Remember what?' he could say, and leave that ball firmly in Sam's court. But he's trying to be more honest about his emotions. "Yeah," he says heavily. "I remember."
"No," Dean says as he gets the fruit. He sets the bowl in the middle of the table, then turns back to the stove and starts to plate the hash browns. "No, not last I checked."
xiii.
This time makes last time feel like a victory.
Jack shrugs. "I didn't do any of this."
"What's dead?" asked Sam.
It was a stupid idea anyway.
“What the hell do you think happened?”
"Can this wait?" asked Cas after another long moment. "I want to see how Jack is doing."
; all in all, it could have gone a whole lot worse.
And that was that. Come the night of David's Halloween party, Dean donned a white dress and his darkest jeans. He adjusted the hat in the bathroom mirror. "I look ridiculous." It was just long enough that it felt like he was wearing a dress, but not long enough that he got to enjoy any of the things he thought might be nice about wearing a dress. The elastic band on the lid dug into his chin.
"Couple blocks. Hope you don't mind a walk."
It happens again three days later. This time, Jack's on his way back into the bunker from some board game night with his local friends. "Hi Papa, Mom," he says as he hurries down the stairs. Eileen waves. Sam grins. Dean does a double take.
“Did I just - what just happened?”
"Did Cas say anything to you, when you got him out of the Empty?" he asked one night. It was just the two of them - Sam and Eileen were on a date, and Cas's brief visit to Claire had transitioned into help with a hunt. ("I love you both," Cas had said when he called to explain the delay, as though it were as easy as breathing.)
Cas laughs a little, as much as he can manage. Tears start to prick at his own eyes. “You don’t need to be, love.” He cups Dean in his arms, gently, and lowers them both back to the bed.
Perhaps Castiel should go back to the bar.
Oh, shit.
And oh,
"Okay. Love you,
They must be doing something right, because it's not like Jack's completely guileless here, not like if he'd come home in a dress when he was less than a year old. Jack's seen some shit, and sure, more of that shit's been magical than mundane, but still - he
"Look," Dean says, and he's not exactly sure how to say this, not in a way that won't raise more ugly memories and upsetting questions, but it needs to be said. "Look, I'd be the first to say that our childhood was kind of shitty, and I did a lot of things for you that I shouldn't have had to do. But that? I don't regret that. Those are good memories, Sammy."
"And he's been doing this for..." Sam counts on his fingers. "Almost a month? And you all knew?"
He didn't feel different. Should he feel different? Dad would flip if he knew, even without the gay part, but Dean just... didn't care. It was just sex. It was barely even that. He'd had raunchier makeout sessions. He'd half-expected to walk away from this feeling stained or something, but hell. He'd been killing sentient beings since he was what, twelve? So this didn't seem to register on his personal morality scale.
Dean nodded noncommittally. "I'm afraid I'll overheat in this crowd. Is there anywhere that's felt colder than usual lately where I could stand?" Kind of an awkward phrasing, but it'd have to do. He was beginning to regret not going with the fed routine. He took a small sip of his drink and grimaced at the sweetness.
“There’s still some residual power in you, I suppose.”
Still. Still. You have never known grief like this. You’ve never lost - what was Cas to you, anyway? Not a lover: you were too much of a coward. Not a friend: he meant so much more.
Before the words are out of his mouth, Castiel has thrown the gun out of Dean Winchester’s hand and all the way across the room.
? Could you ever just listen to my goddamn prayers?”
Instead, he pushes her away.
Sam and Eileen are still out of town. Jack is back, but he's deeply involved in binge-watching some terrible teen television show, says it will help him 'relate to the normal young adult struggles my peers are going through.' He hasn't left his room for more than the bathroom and snacks in three days. There's no risk he'll overhear this conversation - not, and Dean can't believe he's thinking this, that it would be such a huge deal if he did.
Dean and Mary were in the Impala, halfway to the latest Kelly Kline sighting, when Mary sighed, put down her book, and said, "Do you ever think of quitting?"
"Come on, Dad leaves me here with you. I'm basically a grown-up, right? And I can pretend to be a girl." Mollie had a tube of her mom's bright red lipstick that she sometimes kept with her. Maybe if Dean shared some of their fruit loops she would let him use it. And Dad had left behind one of his duffel bags. His shirts were long enough to be dresses on Dean.
Dean has to laugh. "Yeah, uh. Mine too." Give him a witch or a demon any day of the week. Hell, he almost misses fighting God. "No, I'm glad to have a word for it. Thank you. I just... what now?"
“Says who?”
The light-creature steps forward and once-Dean shrinks back. His eyes haven’t hurt like this for ten years, since Alistair scooped them out with a melon baller soaked in acid. “Look around you. This is Hell.”
He sidled up to the bar and, after a moment, asked for a blue hawaiian instead of a whiskey. The man behind the bar gave him an easy grin. "I'll need to see some ID," he said. Dean sighed and handed it over. The man looked it over, nodded, and slid him the drink. "We haven't seen you around here before."
But then Dean Winchester edges away. “My brother,” he says. “He’s still - “
“Who the hell are you?”
"Thanks, Dean," Eileen says, after a moment. "It means a lot that you would tell us." She nudges Sam.
"We take your car to my house, crash on the couch, and watch all the Lord of the Rings movies."
When he came to, he cried. When Cas left, he cried harder. 'Daddy's little girl,' Alastair had called him. No. If John Winchester had had a daughter, he would have raised her to be a fighter and a spitfire. Instead, he got Dean. The world got Dean.
“Yes. Me.” The light-creature - Castiel - his star wraps his arms around him.
He would have known the instant Sam was dead even if he weren’t watching it happen, because he feels Dean Winchester’s heart snap in two. He watches from the trees as Dean Winchester falls to his knees and sobs and rages and pounds his fists on the ground. He sends a tendril of himself down, to wrap around Dean Winchester and bring him a little bit of light. Dean Winchester gives his tree a knowing look.
Dean sighs, rolls the glass in his hands. If he tilts it at the right angle, the wine reflects the stars. “It looks like blood.”
He ended up talking to Jack about it.
The demon’s face grows thunderous. “I don’t need to touch you to kill you.”
“Is he?” Cas asks. “You’re not even able to touch me.”
Cas is quiet for a long moment. "I'll be here when you're ready, then."
“10 days.”
“But it would have been
The thing that was once named Dean tilts its head back and laughs. “Save me from what?”
“I don’t care what you call me, Jack,” he says, shifting a little uncomfortably. “I can be another Dad or Papa if you want. Father’s kind of formal, but I’m okay with it if you are. Or I can be an uncle, if that’s more comfortable? Or just your friend Dean, if you’d rather.”
“What do you mean, kid?” Dean snatches the batter out from under Jack’s wandering hands and dollops it into the prepared pan - one, two, three. It spits and sizzles at the contact.
Sam seems, if anything, more uneasy. "That's... kind of what I wanted to talk about, actually. Um, there's no easy way to ask this, really, and you can tell me to fuck right off if you want, but - are you a woman?"
Days later, in an abandoned barn in the middle of South Dakota, Castiel walks human feet up to a human man. Dean Winchester looks at him and knows who he is; his face breaks into a smile at the sight.
“Is that a good thing?”
"Cas," he sighs. "Were you skipping again?"
God, he smiled at you as he died. Fourteen fucking years your life’s been dogged by demon deals - three times that, if you count Mom’s - and he used his to save your life, and then he smiled at you as he died. See, he said. I beat it. I beat them at their own game.
(This is how it is meant to be,) Zachariah tells him. (Remember, this is all to shape him to be a better vessel.)
"And Ms. Masters weighs her grades so weird, it’ll act like an F."
“That’s a question, though. Did Jesus know when his death date was? Did he, like, throw a party or something? 'I’ve got one year left to live! No, Peter, there isn’t any wine. At least - there wasn’t.’” He laughs weakly to himself.
Sam finds him the next morning, shortly before breakfast is ready. "So," he says, as Dean pulls the bacon out of the oven, "Mom, huh?"
"My dad - "
The tree feels too big. He needs to get somewhere smaller, where he can be closer to solid. He swoops inside the house, where Mary Winchester is placing a Batman band-aid on her eldest son’s knee. “See,” she tells him. “You’ve got to be strong, like Batman.”
The realization rolls over him all in a wave, and he sits up slowly. “Dean?”
When Dean Winchester is fifteen years and four months old, Zachariah finally takes him in for what the angels call, without any awareness at the irony, conversion conditioning. Castiel is too busy trying to keep an eye on Dean Winchester to really care about what they’re doing to him.
"Of course," he says. He leans over the table and kisses her, gingery and rich. "I was hoping you'd ask."
