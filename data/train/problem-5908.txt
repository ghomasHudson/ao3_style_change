Treacherously so, a stray thought jittered his mind; why couldn't it ever be this easy with Steve? But that was... just different.
She turned abruptly, then seemed to sag in her suit. "Okay, thank the gods," she said. She sounded breathless through her helmet.
worried about you," she says. "I told you that right away. Why, don't you ever worry about me?" she asks sweetly; it's an obvious deflection.
They say having a child to save a relationship is a terrible idea. What about when you decide to save your relationship because you can't save the world this time around, and you need to save something, at least? Morgan is a part of the whole story. She tentatively emerged as a clump of cells while Tony was still in space. He'd wanted her, fiercely so, and that was something that never would change. Then Pepper decided she wanted her too, and she decided to keep the pregnancy. At first, after Morgan was born, it all worked in a weird, push-me-pull-you sort of way, but it did work. Still, the strain that a kid put on their relationship was something they never could have anticipated. Perhaps they were too old or just too tired. Not for her, no, never that; but they became too old and too tired for each other soon enough. It took them some time to notice; they thought it would pass. Growing apart is a sneaky process, and once you take notice of it, it's often too late.
. The fact made him both alarmed and electrified; everything else around them had taken on a certain vague quality.
"We could do it the other way around," Tony offers, because he'd rather be on the receiving end than use any of these implements here on Steve.
"I don't want to make you nervous, Steve," he said a little later, at the kitchen table. "And for the record, you also make
Still, I had something to say – something that I'd known all along, but now it crystallized in my mind. And I had to say it, right then, or I wouldn't say it at all.
. He'd wanted to be friends at best, Tony told himself, that was that. (Well, now that's fucked too, most probably.)
that stepped up when they were needed. Every time. And will do it again. I'm sure of it. I can promise you that. I
the sofa if his concentration wavered. “And you let me complain about the weakness in the knees.” He felt like such an asshole. “Why didn’t you
"And I plan to give you back the real thing too," he added, because he'd thought it was self-evident, but then he thought maybe it wasn't to Steve. "It's always been your anyway." Like Tony should have been, perhaps. In a different universe. But, no. Maybe they had to go through everything in order to lend here, together. That's what Tony  chooses to think.
Cap stopped him in the corridor, a day after Tony'd passed preliminary basic flight (the real test would come after they entered a viper cockpit and exercised in real world conditions). The first thing Tony thought was
Steve wasn’t changed – Tony mused as he paced up and down his room – well, not exactly. It was an early evening in October; it was impossible to see if it were drizzling outside, for all the goddamn fog. Despite the gloomy weather, Tony couldn’t suppress a silly grin overtaking his face at the sound of footsteps. Contrary to the popular belief, October just might be the best time of year to visit Barcelona.
It was difficult not to smile at Peter Quill, even when you really, really wanted to sink into melancholy and stay there. Tony allowed one corner of his mouth to go up and gave Peter an amused look.
"Does it really..." Steve began to protest. Reconsidered apparently, because he sighed and gave in. "They injected me with something," Seemingly unconsciously, he touched a hand to his chest, then let it fall.
– he was aware of Cap reaching towards him, and pressing his fingers right over Tony's – pressing Tony's fingers down,
Which was... well, one big fat lie, but he kept telling it to himself in case it worked. He sneaked a look at Steve, at the familiar way he moved, the life he was bringing to everything around him. Tony couldn't decide if this kind of liveliness was a sacrilege or exactly what this place needed right now. But it was disturbing Tony's melancholy and he wasn't sure how he felt about that.
" Happy sounded horrified, but Happy had sounded horrified for the whole duration of the phone call.
"Mind the piss," he called out over his shoulder, and then, again "Piss", when he hopped over the next one. Well, the techs will certainly have to scrub their own deck, so, he thought, this seemed like pissing in the wind, pun fully intended. (He'll have to make that joke later, although perhaps it was a bit too obvious.)
"Thor's checked the grounds, I've checked the roofs and scanned the surroundings. The visibility is good today." His voice was clipped and efficient as always. "No trace of Steve. No one's seen him either."
Steve felt a nascent smile upon his lips. "I thought we were launching guerrilla warfare against Cylons, but apparently I need to learn how to babysit first."
"Great. See you soon, handsome," Tony drawled, and killed the line, and let his head sink back against the wall.
Tony new perfectly well where it was. He's held it in his hands a thousand times, wondering how things went so much to shit between them and where he went wrong. But Steve's face is also getting pensive, so Tony has to do something about that, and being obnoxious was his safest bet. After all, the advice you most often hear is
Tony: Which brings me to this. You know, if you had tranquillizer that actually worked on you people, you could have a pretty safe way to deal with your James too, were you to unfreeze him. I mean. You could have experts work on his de-conditioning, for example, or the retrieval of his memories or whatnot, with very little danger. In case he goes rabid, just poof, a shot from the distance, and he's sleeping like a baby.
"I'd feel better if you had it," he says; it's such a clear attempt at manipulation. It's also piss-poor and perfectly harmless. I know him. I know he just wants me to have the shield and he tries to spin it as if I'd practically be doing him a favor if I took it off his hands. Hell, it might even be true. But there's something else behind it. Something's worrying at him.
But Tony had darker days too. Days when he thought it was all bullshit, and as time went by and nothing happened, dark days came more and more often. Tony kept thinking about Steve more and more – how patient he was, and solid, and competent (competence was
Tony thought ruefully. He had no answer, but he was pretty sure the obvious one shouldn't be taken into account. He'd reviewed all the data last night. That conclusion simply didn't hold water.
"We don't know if the life support systems are functional or not, Thor" Steve was saying. The elevator door was open now. "Everyone ready? Okay, go."
"Nice to know where your concern lies," Steve remarked dryly from a haystack, where he obediently sat while Bruce set his broken arm and looked into his cuts and bruises. (Nothing but the arm apparently needed immediate attention, but he hadn't eaten for a few days and seemed to have developed a semi-nasty cough.)
"You inhaled smoke. Didn't you?" Tony made an effort to make his voice more normal, for the, it seemed, umpteenth time during this conversation.
Back in 2012, actually. If I'm to pinpoint the exact moment, I'd say something twisted in my gut the moment he started rotating that turbine, risking his life to prop the helicarrier up. What can I say? I'd always had a soft spot for the brave and the mouthy.
Tony: Look, please don't wish you didn't exist. I know that feeling. So well. But there's always something.
"The date," Tony blurted. "Because, it's yesterday was the 15th, then today is..." Tony's hand flew to his mouth. For a moment, he kept the sound locked firmly in. And then it spluttered out, through his mouth, through his nose, mixed with spit and the familiar wet, farty noise against his palm. "Oh god, what's with me and this time of year?" Tony managed between giggles. Incapacitated by mirth, all he could do was shake against Steve's back. "What's with me and this
"It's just... time." And then a sliver of uncertainty in his face, something hesitant about his movements brings me back to 2023, and something metallic catches in my throat. I almost wait for him to say it:
Why now? Why was he spilling this now, to Steve, to Captain Fucking America? Because he'd been a part of it too, because he'd been there in a way, played his role in all of it? No, Tony thought, not really. Because he's... Steve, and because he cares even though he doesn't know me, and because he asked so sincerely.
"Okay!" Peter squeaked. He stuffed a piece of omelet in his mouth as if to dam an outburst of words. Steve went back to his food that he seemed to be enjoying very much. Tony served them extra ham slices on the side, and extra-sweet, extra-disgusting coffee for Steve.
"You okay?" The voice belonged to the woman, and he realized she was addressing him. He nodded. She'd introduced herself as Hope, and seemed to have a suit and abilities somewhat similar to Scott Lang's.
"No stone-throwing in glass houses," Natasha said and cleanly steered her dapple mare to ride down one raider as she took care of another in her usual style; many other knights would have considered it highly dishonorable.
"No," Fury snapped. "I went to him, to see why the hell he didn't apply. Then I found out he was preemptively disqualified."
," Steve cut him off impatiently. Lightly but urgently, he grabbed Tony's upper arms right under the shoulders and left his hands to rest there. "The wolf I saved from the water – did you see what happened to it? Did you see it?"
Later that night, their legs happily entangled together, Steve asks another question, even though Tony thought they were on the same page.
“I know you need some time off,” Steve was saying. His eyes had gone soft, as he studied Tony’s face. “I was just...”
Next message from Tony was another animal video, not even a funny one, just a cute basset hound with sad, sad eyes turning its ass to a kids' birthday party behind him, putting his head down on his front paws and staring at the wall in utter resignation.
"So, we getting a pension plan or what?" Scott peeped up, with a toothy grin, and Tony laughed out. This gained him a short, sharp look from Rogers, while Scott somehow got a suppressed but amused smile.
, I thought to myself, and felt a bit better. His warm body against mine was reassuring, the muscles of his back against my stomach an anchor to reality.
, his gut seemed to say. Well, Stark was really something, no doubt about that, but Steve was going to ignore it, and instruct him, and hopefully make a competent combat pilot out of him; that was all that mattered. He wasn't going to pay him any special attention; it wouldn't be right to the others and could only be harmful for the man himself. It wouldn't hurt him to learn not to be the centre of attention for once.
Feeling faintly embarrassed, as if he had been eavesdropping, he tapped Rhodey on the shoulder. A mixture of annoyance and relief crossed Rhodey's face.. "What's up, Cap?"
Tony's guts were ice. After a time, you stopped feeling the cold. That was how it went with hypothermia.
He didn't even know how it all happened exactly. One moment they were kissing, bodies pressed together, hands under T-shirts. Practically the next moment Steve was holding both their cocks in his hand, and rubbing, stroking. It was hot and rushed, and it was way too dry. Thoughts, fleeting: Shit, why did I leave the lube in the bedroom? How naive of me.
"Do you want my socks?" Steve whispered, which was when Tony realized he'd started drifting away on the waves of cozy warmth. He made himself blink a few times to shake off sleep.
After a moment, Steve seemed to get it. He sighed. Said, "No, actually... I approved them. I think."
His voice. It's like I've been tightly curled up around myself, somewhere on the inside, and now I've suddenly uncoiled. I know I break into a smile because my face hurts. It's an uncontrollable reflex.
. Always for you. Not for power, not because we like to fight. We don't. We like to watch TV and eat pizza, just like everyone [laughter]. Except for Bruce Banner, who mostly just drinks green tea and meditates all day long.
Steve hummed noncommittally. His voice was very soft and sort of resigned. “I came, and then JARVIS told me you’d left me the override codes in case of an emergency, and that the fridge was full, and that I could stay for however long I wanted. And that you were at a conference. In Japan. For two weeks.”
Tony: Thanks for the free lesson. And yes. And because we need to go to the root of the problem. The press is not the root, the press is just the leaves.
Well. Tony was an ally, of sorts. A useless one, old and soft and mostly drunk. Steve had sent him away so that he wouldn't get in the way. If he stayed on, all he was going to do was be a nuisance. The worst of it was, Steve was probably right. And so Tony was here, tinkering away. Doing the only thing he knew how. Hoping against hope to finish in time. Because, even if he wasn't a perfect ally, he did have allies of his own. Or used to.
"I always wanted to be a teacher's pet." Stark grinned. Steve thought it best to ignore this as he explained a bit about what the lesson should cover.
, Tony thought, and tried again. This time he didn't refrain from looking at Rogers. He talked, animatedly, even cracked a few jokes. He would gaze at everyone in the audience
Even later, they are making a plan of action. Morgan is with Pepper and Dog is with Happy, in case something happens to them. They are
, in turn. As if it was nothing. As if there was nothing going on. But after he passed over him with his eyes – Rogers had a small, polite smile frozen on his lips – Tony let his gaze flare back to him.
Instead, Steve looked stubborn. "I thought that was why I came here. I thought that was the purpose."
"Any suggestions as to how to impress the good Captain?" he asked half-joking, looking at Natasha, the Cap-friend, the one who apparently was on first name basis with Rogers. Tony leaned against the bedpost and smirked and tried to be cute; it tended to have a certain effect on women. By now it was practically his second nature. Lieutenant Romanoff gave him a cool up and down and decided to take his question with a modicum of seriousness.
finding his way through the damned forest when he spotted a car parked by the roadside. For miles around there was nothing but trees, the car lights were turned off, and it was freezing outside – so cold that he had to struggle to keep panic at bay, despite the serum and the very warm winter jacket of Old Red Kelley. He just wanted to be home, in his room, huddled under a couple of dusty blankets, with the space heater turned up as high as it would go. But something could be wrong with the car, there might be someone in need of help in there, and he couldn't just walk by. He was still Steve Rogers, even though he was done using that name for good. It wasn't even a question.
That's what he's supposed to do. He focuses his will, his mind and heart. And instead, he thinks the only thought he has left, the only thought that's still possible for him:
I shrug. "This is where Strange sent me," I say. "It's not as if there was a catalogue for me to pick from."
Tony died at the very old age of ninety five. We knew it was coming. I thought I'd accepted it. I hadn't. I don't think it's possible to accept something like that. That's all I'm going to say about it. It still hurts like hell, and I can't talk about it. Sorry.
A tux, really? Just.. no. It wasn't about looks, not so much. You wouldn't stick Han Solo in a tux, would you? It was simply unnatural. Still, Peter seemed perfectly self-assured and completely and blessedly unaware of any out-of-placeness, which was a part of his charm.
The traces of old, faded disappointment leaking into Steve’s tone pushed Tony into the mild defensive stance. “Well, I thought you could use a luxury vacation after slumming it across America on your motorbike. Sue me. I didn’t think it’d matter if I were there or not.”
"Because I was too much of a chicken to strike up a normal conversation in fear you didn't actually want it? So I kept it at a high level of deniability? Well, what do you
Then, after what seemed like ages, in tones that would have been conversational hadn't his voice been slightly choked: "Cap, what are you doing?"
That Steve did it at all only attested to the fact that serious weariness was setting in. He just compressed his lips and supported Tony up the stairs, a step by laborious step. Every time Tony put weight on his foot a spike of sharp, hot pain that set his teeth on edge shot through him, but he didn't think Steve was okay enough to carry him either.
" They should be past lying, by now, with everything that they went through. Whatever they said to each other turned weird and awkward anyway; he might as well go with the truth.
Tony: I just hacked into Associated Press servers, informatively. I'm not doing anything. I COULD. But I'm not.
"You... be safe," Tony replied lamely as he pulled away a bit. He wasn't disappointed – or he shouldn't be, he thought – everything was great, everything was better than he could have ever hoped, and he'll
The thrill that courses through Tony isn't even all about sex, and that's probably the worst part. It's something in his heart instead that throbs and stirs and grows warm all the way through, at those two words. And, true, Steve was a gentle lover, those few times they had fun together – all soft kisses and tender touches, always remembering what Tony liked; the guy would also whisper endearments now and then, but not like this, not quite – never an equivalent of
This was when a beefy hand descended upon Tony's shoulder like an anvil falling from the sky. It's a miracle, how quiet big people could be, or at least big people who were also Norse gods and had various uncanny powers.
Tony: He heavily disapproves oft he info leak, because revealing state secrets is apparently frowned upon in some circles. And there is some military stuff that shouldn't' be available to the public, obviously, who would've known. And he's horrified by all this, just like everyone else, but he says it should have been dealt with internally, there are proper channels, you can't just spill it all out, and cause panic and distrust and destabilize the country. But he was kind of with me on the media blockade matter, obviously, because how could he not be. And he did see the urgency, and the 'proper channels' take time, and can be stoppered, and it's difficult. And this info DID need to be made public, it couldn't have gone on like this.
Tony cut him off. "No reason to be alarmed, it's just a guy – looks more like a mountain, though, to tell you the truth. We're alone on an abandoned stretch of road at night. It's fine." Then, as Happy took an audible breath, Tony went on in a more conciliatory tone: "Hap, it's
Steve's curiosity was piqued. He found himself longing to talk to Stark some more. Also the inside of the car was enticingly warm; calling, beckoning. So warm, in fact, that Steve felt his face burn and his head swim once he was inside.
Not that I'm not happy to see the shield, actually; it's an old friend. For someone who's moved house so many times, it's strange how nostalgic I get about things. Or, coming to think of it, perhaps it's not strange at all.
it was becoming apparent she had a crush on Steve the size of the hill the town was situated on. Tony wouldn't be surprised if the grandmother had a crush on Steve too. Even the waitress was looking at him with heart eyes now that he'd ’saved’ her, as she put it.
mean nothing! Tony might be teasing. He might be flirting for fun (he always flirted with people; never really went farther than that). He might or might not want something with Steve, and Steve couldn't know that for sure even if his body kept yelling at him to
They were brusque with each other, but Steve could see an underlying affection there – easily spotted in Tony, because he knew Tony well, and he knew Tony had bucketfuls of secret affection for nearly everyone he chose to have in his life. But Fury, too; Steve could see he
But Stark, who was sitting right next to Quint, started rolling his eyes practically at the very moment Quint opened his mouth to say 'in order to'. Stark started talking over the kid: "It's designed for both space flight and to be able to withstand various types of atmosphere, that's basic, come
, dammit. Then Thor fires away, and Spidey and Star-Lord attack from the back, and the fight is suddenly moving to the other side of the field.
One evening I had an especially hard time of it. He was sitting pressed against my side, with my arm around his shoulders. I could smell his hair and I'd turned my head slightly to the side so that it would tickle my nose. That was the closest I dared come to touching my lips to the top of his head, which was what I actually wanted to do. I was giddy with his closeness and warmth, so much so that my head swam and I couldn't connect the dots of my own thoughts. I noticed I was rubbing his shoulder with my thumb, softly. He was relaxed against me, molten, tired from the day. His glasses had slipped down his nose and I knew he couldn't be bothered to put them back up. He raised his eyes then, tilting his face towards mine to tell me something, but all I could think about was the movement of his lips. I wasn't going to say anything – I was
All of a sudden, the sound of cicadas was the only thing in the world. Distantly, he thought he was standing there, struck dumb. His throat was tight and as dry as the desert air, and the only thing that rang in his suddenly empty head were the goddamn cicadas.
Tony: What, I'm not supposed even to ask? You've mentioned just about everyone there, but never him. Which, I guess, is you trying to spare my feelings? Or maybe you don't think you should share that part of your life with me, which is your choice, obviously, but I don't want that to be a... a matter that can't be named. If we are trying this honesty thing.
It wrung Tony’s heart that Steve seemed almost grateful for every plain, non-combative sentence that came out of Tony’s mouth. The guy seemed somehow milder in return. Action and reaction. It was a marvel how simple laws of physics applied to humankind. Tony’d been right. Have some fun. Do things together. As long as they mostly avoided talking, they’d be fine.
Tony: But I do think there is no such thing as magic. Just the tech we cannot comprehend yet. So yeah, a high-tech trick might be the right definition.
"I think so," Steve laughed. "At least, I don't have a better explanation." He felt instantly guilty, because the sweater had been a present. "I think it's nice, though," he added. And he did, he really did. He supposed it might be considered a form of naive art.
? Tony had to ask himself, then, spoiling it, spoiling everything, like he tended to do. He didn't want Steve's pity. Did he cross the line? He'd have been sorry he'd said anything, but it still felt right, to share this with Steve. Steve was making himself the right person to be shared with.
We were still tentative around each other. It was hard for us to accept this gift we were given – having each other back – as something normal. I used to wake up, drenched in sweat, from dreams of being back in my reality, and all of this being just a dream. I woke to see his sleeping form beside me, and then I would reach out and caress his temple with my knuckles, run fingers through his hair. Usually he wouldn't wake up. He would just roll over to his side, groggily, so that I could spoon him, aware even in his sleep of what I wanted.
Tony: Look, don't worry about it now. I'll push through. Everyone knows I can't do anything else right, but press conferences, I'm born to do press conferences.
careful," the blond tells him, arching his eyebrows, but he obediently raises the arms above his head. Tony passes the ribbon through a hoop hanging from the ceiling and ties it off.
Tony shrugged in response, then remembered that wouldn't help much. "I'm fine," he said. "I don't feel like sleeping."
coming, but it's somehow underwhelming, somehow all the previous sensations have been more intense than this, although it
They sank into a comfortable silence, and Steve let his mind wonder for a while. Then: "Nat. What did you think of Stark, though?"
Both of Steve’s hands were under Tony’s t-shirt in an instant, exploring, rubbing, spreading warmth and goodness all over his back like a lotion. Tony let his hand wonder down from Steve’s chest. It lingered on Steve’s stomach for a second, feeling the muscles move under his fingers, and then it continued even lower down, tracing the waistband of Steve’s pants with two fingers, but no, it was too slow, too excruciating. Even lower, then. As if sensing his intention, Steve had stopped grinding against him and was now standing very still. Tony covered the other man’s cock with his palm and squeezed lightly over the fabric; his thumb found the tip. Steve’s head jerked back, breaking the kiss. His eyes flew closed; his lips were still parted, and red from the kissing. Tony let go, then rubbed a bit up and down, and squeezed again. Steve’s expression almost looked like anguish. “Tony,”, he gasped, barely audibly. His face at that moment, eyes squeezed shut, mouth half-open, was probably the most beautiful sight Tony had ever seen.
Hierarchy was a big  illusion, true, and it functioned only because people chose to believe in it. Both the ones at the top and the ones at the bottom. Still, none of it was Rogers's fault. Tony had chosen to play the military game, and as in any game, he needed to stick to the rules or the game fell apart.
Steve left them then, Thor putting a cordial arm round Darryl's shoulders and dragging him back towards the tech bar, and Darryl letting himself be hugged and dragged. He seemed too resigned to protest.
That evening, after he'd rabbitted out of the simulator and tried organizing his thoughts without much success, he found himself looking for Sam in the gym. Older pilots off duty were often there in the evenings, when the nuggets mostly cleared out. He ended up finding Natasha instead, which was probably just as good. He could talk to Sam, and Sam often saw things more clearly than Steve, with a certain no-bullshit attitude he possessed. But Steve didn't know how to open a conversation of this type, and he didn't really
"No, thank you, I think I'm good," he was saying when Thor emerged from behind a bulkhead some distance away. It seemed he'd gotten impatient.
As with any terrorist attack, it seemed the attackers were into making as big a fuck-all as possible, causing as much damage ass possible. Hurting people. Causing fear. You know how it goes.
And now this casual care which Tony exerted towards a total stranger. Steve had always expected it from himself, but learned that expecting it from others only lead to disappointment. And now, with Steve suddenly at the receiving end, Tony was sneaking through his barriers, and Steve didn't know what to do.
"Wouldn't surprise me," Steve murmured. "Is it sprained or broken, do you think? Can you wiggle your toes? I want to take a look."
Then there was Steve's other hand. Tony would have sworn he could sense it approaching his body. He wouldn't look down, not for a million dollars, not now. It was all a part of the game. His breath froze in his chest in anticipation of where it would go.
Tony: No, seriously, what happened? I mean. You kissed, right. Otherwise it isn't even a date. It's sightseeing. She a good kisser?
Steve suddenly had an impression this wasn't the first time Tony had called his name. "Sorry," he muttered.
Tony was looking back at him; their eyes locked. Something Steve couldn't quite read seemed to pass between them. "Okay," Tony said softly. "That's ridiculous, but okay. I get it. But what about the dog? What were you doing on the lake in the first place? Because I know you're normally not insane."
Tony, sitting in a pub in Berlin, at this table, with bottles and glasses multiplying around him, a geometric progression. And the despair is overwhelming, and the tears won't stop, and he's staring at his own head enclosed in a black box on the table. Aloud, he says: "Why is this my life? What am I doing wrong?" But the words that are eating him up inside are 'Here's to saving the world... from me', and the Dream Steve, the one who is watching it all through Tony's eyes, is also crying in his sleep, and he's falling apart for Tony. And the real Tony (the one at the Compound, not the one at the table in a pub in Berlin; not the one
"I... don't really want to lie down," Steve managed. He turned away from Tony, not wanting him to see his face right at that moment. So. He'd spoiled the nice ting they'd had going on, as well as the lovely offer of dinner. Great. He stood there, looking for a distraction, anything to do or say.
"I'm still here," Steve gasped as he got back to his feet. He checked the fire extinguisher, then noticed a red light blinking on the primitive control panel of the helmet. He swore. "An explosion, chemical fire," he informed Tony briskly as he waded back in. Maybe it was helping Tony stay focused, he told himself. "Going to put it out now."
"I'm getting you out of here!" Steve took him by the elbow, but Tony shook his hand away. He had to do something first.
She refuses to explain, and Steve is inclined to think she knows more than she's saying. He is not sure he trusts her, but Tony seems to. The only thing she's willing to say on the subject is that it was a bad idea from the start and, "New plan!"
"Would," she said. "Could. Might," She touched the amulet around her neck which now held the time stone again. "Yes. I see it all."
He steeled his heart. He pulled back. He started pulling his pants up from around his knees. One thing at a time. Thankfully it was dark. The dark made it possible. His hands were shaking as he fumbled with the button and he was aware of Steve straightening, turning around.
The second day was pretty much like that, too, only the exchange was somewhat shorter. It could mostly be summarized as
– Tony had a burning desire to prove them wrong. All the expectations and assumptions – they offended him; he wanted to scrap them. He wanted to be someone else, for once. Fresh starts, all that bullshit.
The door was the only thing that looked new; it was sturdy and very much locked and unbreakable, unless he had the suit; he didn't. It had been blown apart and Tony had been forced to step out of the pieces when the heating controls went to hell.
He kept thinking of all the faces he'd spent a month with, day and night, while he was still in tech (it seemed like yet
important thing was for Tony to get to the side motors and see if he could fix the damage. Steve's gut tightened and strained like a taut, overextended rope at the idea of sending him there alone. Tony wasn't even a real soldier yet, and yet Steve expected him to act like one – they had neither time nor resources to coddle anyone. Sooner or later all the new recruits would have to go through one crisis or another. And Tony was doing good, he actually was, everything considered.
"You've changed the common area, though," Steve commented, trying for off-handedness and failing so spectacularly Tony wanted to record it and have it as his ringtone.
The parting kiss had landed so near a corner of Steve’s lips that the spot could be called ’cheek’ only out of courtesy. Tony had flown him to the rendezvous point, where Steve was supposed to meet the chopper. Steve had stepped on Iron Man’s boots, put his arms around Tony’s waist – where they’d been resting for the better part of the night – and the force of the repulsors had taken them to the destination. It happened too fast, it was over too soon.
Tony: And then we talked about way more important stuff than some cruddy super-soldier serum, bc who cares about such, eh?
In response to his wail, I poured him some and selfishly lingered by his elbow as he drank. I had a feeling this whole foray had been a mistake and that Tony was going to tell me this friendship couldn't work. I wasn't his Steve, and he surely didn't have the stomach to get emotionally invested the second time... So I just wanted to be close to him for a little while longer. When I sneaked a look at his face, I saw he was watching me with an almost-tender smile.
"You're not in trouble," he said quickly, understanding, and observed a tiny softening around Stark's eyes. Then he decided to stop looking so closely. It was a bad idea. "I was actually wondering if you'd be willing to do an impromptu presentation?" he said. And then: "You don't have to," he added. "But you seem to have a pretty good grasp of the subject, and you know how to explain it in simple terms too."
And when a few of their captors finally figured something was wrong and filed out of an elevator, Tony and Steve were ready. Tony shot two of them before they had the time to fire, and then Steve was upon them, among them, kicking, punching, twisting and throwing. Tony was happy to knock out a nearby dude with a butt of his gun to the temple. He mostly kept silent, because Steve moved guided by his hearing, but from time to time, Tony would say
All of Steve's nerves sang in tune with it. He was permeated by a super-awareness of every inch where their bodies touched. He could barely stop his thumb from drawing frantic little circles on Tony's waist, where he pretended to hold him up.
Steve's eyes had gone wide, but he didn't hesitate. He touched his lips to Tony's, and Tony moved to meet them. It was soft and shy and exploratory, a meet and greet. And Tony let it warm him through. Still he couldn't enjoy it fully, because his thoughts wouldn't stop talking at him.
Upon startling awake, the feeling of frustrated longing, of angry melancholy, still permeated every organic cell, every plastic molecule in Tony's chest.
He started towards Steve with no particular intention in mind. Hands on shoulders and such hadn't been their thing even when they were better at dealing with each other's presence. His heart burned in his chest, just like after eating too much hot sauce.
Suddenly, Steve was overtaken by a weird idea that Stark kept coming here just so that, once, if Steve walked in, he'd be there, looking at him like
having fun.” He gestured at Tony with both hands, apparently unconscious of what he was doing. “Of course I am. I’m having a great time.”
he thought at Tony, because if Tony did, if their gazes locked through the throng of people, if they exchanged smiles, perhaps – it seemed to Steve it would all be all right, somehow, it would all make sense. It would have been enough.
Then they both leaned forward and, smoothly like an orchestrated scene, their lips greeted each other again in a languid kiss. Once, twice, then three times more. Their limbs—everything moved slowly like molasses. Steve closed his eyes, but Tony couldn't help but look. Not a second of this should go unobserved.
His thoughts still felt muddled, stale from the painkillers. He wasn't going to get into this with Natasha, not now. He just gave her a steady, unwavering look, and she blinked at him impassively for a moment; a muted battle of wills. A few seconds later Nat shrugged one shoulder slightly, looked away and turned to go.
Steve nodded. He shuffled around so he was now lying on his stomach. Marginally closer to Tony. The book lay open on the bed before him. Like a bait, like a trap.
For Tony, every personal tutoring session with Cap brought on a heady feeling. The excitement would start building up in his stomach hours in advance. It was barely detectable at first, like a tiny blue flame flickering to life somewhere deep inside him. Still, it was undeniable.
," said Steve, intelligently, because at the moment he was absolutely unable to think of another word. His lungs didn't seem to be working properly. Sudden onset of excitement was heart-stopping; he wasn't used to feeling that way.
Tony was faster. Almost automatically he interposed himself between the robber and Steve, raising his hands as non-threateningly as he could, at the same time planning half a dozen moves that Happy would have called dirty. "Stay there," he hissed at Steve, and to the robber he started saying: "Okay, okay there, buddy, we can talk about this. Let's talk about this. What you want to do right now is..."
I think she must have guessed the gist of it, somehow. That, and she must have seen who I kept going to in all those futures that didn't take place, branching out from that point in time.
"That... probably wouldn't be appropriate," Cap said, somewhat stiffly now, although he didn't sound pissed. "Nine or ten rounds around the landing bay should do the trick for you, though."
A giddy excitement danced in Steve's belly. He'd been angry himself just moments before, affronted at Tony's excessive reaction in the ballroom, but his outrage was hopelessly entangled with arousal, like it had been for years. And now, as he felt Tony's hands all over him, the push of Tony's body against him, the whole emotional mess surged up, boiled over, turning into a wild, dark delight that trumped everything else. Because Tony wanted him, Tony
. He needed to change that state of affairs, to charm the person into submission or punish them relentlessly for their effrontery; possibly both at the same time. One thing he didn't know how to do was let go. It wasn't just about first impressions. He couldn't leave it alone. He had to pick at the perceived dislike, had to prod and poke, like prodding a sore tooth with his tongue, like picking at a scabbed-over knee.
“I...” he swallowed. “Up there on the trail.” He made himself look directly at Steve. “I got scared.” It was nothing, really. Just cutting his gut open and spilling the contents onto the wooden table between them. Anyone could do it.
He realized he had stopped about halfway across the room; Steve was still standing at the door. His eyes looked very big and his Adam's apple was bobbing up and down. The gala seemed in the distant past. This was a first time again, a first meeting, with all the gut-clenching nervousness it entailed. And why was it always like this with the two of them, Tony wondered as he considered whether his wobbly legs could handle another step forward. He was staring at Steve. He couldn't
, a woman named Daisy had quipped, to which Fury – surprise, surprise – swore under his breath and rolled his eyes.
This conversation was like cutting myself open and showing all the bloody bits to Tony. All the things that hurt. Wasn't there supposed to be relief? All I had was grief and more grief. Maybe the relief would come later.
We did go home, though, despite my protestations that I was going to be fine in a minute. I lingered a longest time with Tony's mug in my hand. When my Tony came back to the Compound and we all started brainstorming, he found it in the kitchen. He commented that he couldn't believe we still had the old thing and how it should have been thrown out years ago, were we Avengers or garbage collectors, and then he proceeded to drink from it and only it for days. Here and now, I put it down. I was happy to have a Tony to take with me, instead; I didn't need a mug as a keepsake. In the end, we brought only Nat's mug home with us, as an act of defiance against oblivion. We used it almost every day thereafter and always remembered Nat when we did so.
Steve took the offered sweet delicately, careful not to crush the strawberry, and popped it into his mouth. "Thank you." So polite, so gracious. The little shit, Tony thought fondly. The man leaned on the doorway post and something in his stance made Tony aware – even
"You let me stew in my own juices for five years?" I looked up at him, hearing his tone. His smile was wry, self-deprecating. "I let you stew in
She didn't sound reproachful, so I don't know why I had the urge to be defensive. I hadn't stolen him away from her.
Still, as soon as they need to actually formulate the plan, it's like a well-rehearsed performance. They don't talk over each other. Their remarks flow together seamlessly, and that Star-Lord guy just stares at them and says: "Dude. Did you two practice that on the way here?"
As they enter the quaint, cheep little hotel, Tony inches closer to Steve, very careful not to touch him.
the axe murderer in this scenario?" Steve asked, fighting off another onset of chills. Oh well, crisis averted, he thought to himself while Tony chattered about how he himself was a total mess, and therefore inherently suspicious, and
And – strangely enough – right into the same dream, a little later, and there was the kitchen again, and the coffee (disgustingly sweet and creamy, just like Steve liked it), and Bucky (
Tony: What actually happened is, I’m getting seriously fed up with people sticking their nose in my affairs, is what happened.
kind of giving him these long looks; he had a tendency to start with such whenever they spent any time together.
he thought. He'd tried tracking time by his sleeping cycles, but having nothing to record them with, he lost count. Being underground did that to you, he supposed. As they were bringing him here, he'd felt the elevator going down – and down and
Darryl frowned for a moment, his shrug barely perceptible. "No, no," he said dutifully. "Thor's all right."
"If everything else fails," Steve said at one point," you go wait in the next cell, Tony. I'll try to kick the door down. Maybe you saw wrong, maybe it's something else. And if it blows up – well, at least one of us gets out." Steve's voice was calm and very matter-of-fact. Tony hated every syllable.
Sometimes, the darkness around him seemed the embodiment of his panic. When he was first brought here, it appeared dense, impenetrable; he could barely breathe for it. And then as the time passed, his eyes became accustomed to the gloom. He could now make out the shapes, not that there was much to make out around him. The walls, the blankets on the floor; there was a niche in the wall with a toilet bowl. The first thing Tony did after he got his bearings was to fix the flush tank. (It was easy – just reattaching the chain to the lift road; a child could have done it). Judging by touch only, he'd have said the thing was made in the...60s? Maybe 70s.
"Thor!" Tony echoed, with, as he thought, somewhat more poise than the tiny Khan had, but it came out pretty strangled as the big guy literally folded him into a hug. (This was one of the times Tony really missed his suit – the one of the non-cloth, non-Armani variant.)
Well, if he was being honest with himself, it wasn't just escape he was looking for. A tiny, despicable part of himself
Some of the sketches made me blush. Most of those were pretty vague, with sheets draped over the key bits, the way I usually do it, but even the full nudes were done very tastefully. But, the artist was, after all – me.
Still, goading Steve doesn't seem like such a great idea any longer. His own actions make Tony feel a bit queasy, even, now that he makes himself think about t. He's done with this farce, he's going to do better. He's going to be a normal human being for once, and stop pushing, and hope this weekend is over fast. Maybe the mission turns out interesting, in the end. Or maybe someone kindly shoots him in the head and puts a stop to all this.
"Sorry, Cap," he said, trying to sound as honest as he could and probably failing. "I... It's sometimes difficult for me to remember the hierarchy, you know? Which you probably noticed. I'm not a soldier. Well, you probably noticed that as well."
Orange meant extremely difficult, he explained. Around here it also meant a completely ungroomed area with no ski patrols. Tony liked backcountry skiing better than sharing a piste with other people, at least when he was in a certain kind of mood. But to go backcountry on a slope of this degree? After you hadn’t skied in years? You’d have to be crazy.
Two wings of their party had noticed Bruce's green flame signal and rejoined them. Mainly foot-soldiers, though, the ones that had created a diversion for Steve's friends to sneak into this hornet's nest. Natasha recognized some of the faces, but for the most part these were the new lads from the northern borders.
All the while he kept telling himself he'd help Steve best if he did the job in front of him, just like he'd been told to – repeatedly. He also, in a les controlled voice, kept telling himself that whatever happened, it was probably entirely his fault, because he couldn't fix things faster, because he kept distracting Steve with inane questions instead of letting him focus on his own safety.
the soup. Warm liquid will do you good before we start you on something more solid. I don't think we should hurry with that, though."
It was very definitely vacant. Still, a sound drew his attention, and he spotted a balcony door, left ajar. And through it, a smiling Tony, quite unaware of Steve, moving to the inaudible beat, dancing quite close to – Steve's breath stopped, hurt – the Star-Lord. Peter Quill, who had the easy charm and six quips a the ready at all times, who bantered with Tony over the comms in battles, the way Steve used to before everything started going to shit; Quill, who managed to maintain an easy friendship with Tony without the bad beginnings and misunderstandings and the struggle that were the mark of Steve and Tony's relationship even while everything was
“Where are we going?”, Steve asked, because playing along seemed like the best option, and also, if Tony wanted out of water, that was the prerogative. But a pit opening in his stomach felt icy and white.
you, isn't it? Somehow it's you. But that's impossible, it's impossible because you went and died, I
Steve's cock is rock hard; he needs to rub it against something, needs some friction. He knows he is whispering soft pleas, but what he gets in return is light teasing of the flogger tresses on his shaft, crawling along it's length. He tries to fuck into the feeling, and it does absolutely nothing. He wants to growl with frustration.
"Then I just might keep it." It was apparent in Steve's voice he was smiling back. It tried to set off alarms in Tony's mind, but he was warm and cozy and they were sounding from somewhere in the distance.
Quickly, Tony closed his eyes now. Despite the sinfully long lashes, or the ridiculous, patchy beard Steve was apparently trying to grow, he somehow didn’t look young at all. Just worried. Weren’t people supposed to look younger when asleep? Pepper’d looked like a baby.
"Rhodey'll come for you if he gets the message," Steve had said, very reasonably. And yes, yes, of course Rhodey would, but...
"Steve?" Tony almost chickens out, but he feels it's now or never. There's nothing left to lose. "I did fail. I'm still failing. Big time. Maybe I should stop trying, altogether."
in Cap's hearing. It didn't matter that Hammer was insufferable and deserved it all; you always ended up looking worse when he was involved.
He wasn't exactly looking back at me. "I had them made after our first night,," he said as if it was the greatest joke in the world, which only meant it was extremely important to him and not to be treated as anything funny in the least, at any time, ever. "Talk about rash, huh?"
Tony was about to gripe at Steve to lay back down, but that smile stopped him in his tracks; who could be angry at that smile? No. Tony realized his anger wasn't meant for Steve at all; it was aimed at himself, instead, because he let so many years pass without trying to reach out to Steve, to at least leave a window of communication slightly ajar; because he couldn't seem to talk to Steve at all; because he was unable to even pretend to be a normal person around Steve, for some reason. There was so much baggage there, so much resentment; also furtive, fierce longing that had gone and festered over the years, and Tony had no idea what to do with it now.
"So, you know about that." Tony snorted. "I wondered. Yeah, for two months. I expect you know how gloriously it ended."
"Why, of course, Cap" Tony says, and Steve imagines he can hear a slick grin through the filters. "No problem at all."
Bizarrely, ridiculously, it's Central Park again. I don't bother with shades this time. I highly doubt anyone would recognize me like this. I suspect the Steve Rogers they remember died some time ago, looking a few decades younger and a whole lot more handsome.
Oh, of course Tony had to mess it up royally. And of course he'd made Steve think this was something that it really wasn't.
The nervous energy coursing through Steve was pure torment. Tony had gone to bed. Steve got up and folded the blankets the man had left behind. Set them neatly down on a tabouret. Checked the fire again (it still didn't need any more wood added). The room was finally getting pleasantly warm – so much so that the fleece hoodie was becoming torturous, so Steve stripped to his wicking undershirt.
Tony wasn't happy, though. To be happy, he'd have to forget the fact that this was, technically, the last time they were together like this. Their last night. He wasn't going to throw himself at Steve, but hell, he wasn't far from it. Together, they were a Molotov cocktail made of mixed signals. Did Steve really want anything with Tony beyond, well, endless talking and gratuitous touching? Yes, probably. Was Steve aware of any of it? Tony wasn't so sure. And even if he was aware, did he actually want to give in to the impulse? Tony liked him too much – no, to hell with that: he
But: "Cold," Tony said contemplatively; he didn't seem miffed, just thoughtful. "Controlling, when he could be bothered." It was as if something in the air, in the smell of fire and the dim light, allowed for this kind of intimacy that wasn't their usual shtick. "But usually he couldn't be. Bothered." Tony hesitated for a moment again. "Around here, where there were no distractions, sometimes he wasn't so bad. Or maybe I'm just idealizing this place. I've no idea. Sometimes I think that..." He fell silent mid-sentence, then he turned his head, looked Steve full in the eyes. "What was he like as a friend, though?"
"No, it's not that. Actually..." He smiled to himself. "Bucky said if this thing helped make me less crazy, then thank fuck. Natasha told him not to be crude, and then
, an inner voice warned him occasionally, but Tony did his best to shut it up. It was a bit of sexual tension, nothing more. That, and a bit of fun.
"Friend Tony!“, Thor boomed and grinned down at him, holding him at arm's length now and looking him up and down for a moment, then pulling him back in and giving him a hearty slap on the back. It'd been a year, but Thor was, as ever, unchanged. He was, oh god, he was wearing a dinner jacket and leather pants, but somehow, improbably, he was pulling it off (possibly because no one was likely to notice the dinner jacket, really). Tony himself felt rather worse for wear, and, right now, also pretty squished. He disentangled himself from the man's enthusiastic embrace and let Thor say his hellos.
that, Tony." Damn the man for telling the truth. Tony would have welcomed an empty platitude from time to time. No. That was a lie. All he really wanted was to spill his guts in front of Steve and hear what Steve had to say, see that Steve accepted him, have Steve tell him
,” he slurred into Steve’s shoulder. And there was a sensation of Steve pulling away for a moment, by then, almost at once, Tony found himself propped up against a warm torso, two firm arms around him, and the blankets wrapped about them both, like a wooly tent. A part of him knew this was... not their normal, but that part got shushed into submission, and with a last effort of will Tony let his arms sneak around Steve’s waist, because that was the one major, important thought he refused to let go of: Keep Steve warm. Keep Steve safe.
When he put the tray down, Tony's interest perked up. The biscuits were star-shaped and A-shaped and square, and Tony seemed to focus on them. "Are those Kambly?"
Were Steve's eyelashes always this long, though? Yup, most definitely, and Tony knew that perfectly well, only he was never quite willing to admit it, even to himself.
Soon enough, the shivering subsided a bit, so Tony left Steve to try and tuck the dog into blankets while he brought it some hot soup from the kitchen. Later on they would have to try and feed it something at least semi-solid, but for now warm liquids were the thing.
Tony: I thought you were going to be okay. I really didn’t think me being there would matter any to you.
But Steve just sucks in a hitchy breath and nods. "All right," he says. He feels his cock drip onto his stomach. His leg muscles are taut as strings. He
, to be honest. They say you should multiply the glasses you've had with the number of gray hairs on your head.
“Worried about me?” Tony said in slightly subdued tones. “Gee, what a villain you are. I don’t know how I put up with you.”
Tony stood there unmoving for a moment, like cast in stone. Then he plopped down into the chair opposite Steve. It probably wasn't the best time for naked honesty, but with so many feelings brewing inside him, the words were practically saying themselves.
"Stories are still being told," Rogers said very dryly. He paused then. "Let me ask you something. Do you want this? To be a pilot?"
Doctor Strange drops by to see him later that day. In this universe they are buddies. They might have gone there in my original  timeline too, perhaps, if Tony had lived; and I wouldn't put it past doctor Stranges of the multiverse to be in cahoots with one another. So now I'm wondering why they are trying to manipulate the timeline by sending me here. Is this unhappy Tony going to do something big and regrettable and perhaps catastrophic? I could see it happening, sort of. But he's not really working on anything much, these days, Natasha tells me. So perhaps he's
I told him about the Ancient One from my past, and how she opened the passage through the quantum realm for me. Tony looked disappointed. "I hoped I'd perfected that GPS system in your timeline. Oh, well. I guess we'll need to find either that Ancient One person or Strange."
Tony was riding on Steve's back, in an improvised harness made out of looted gun belts. This way they both had their hands free. Tony had a semi-automatic in each one, positioned over each of Steve's shoulders. Together, they were a clumsy moving fortress. Painstakingly slow, they advanced through the corridors of what seemed to be an old institute? Centre? Tony had no idea, but it was massive, and looked like something that might have been built right after the WWII. With this many levels below ground, Tony guessed it would have been some kind of a secret governmental institution or something just as ridiculous and sinister. Judging by the state it was in and the omnipresent graffiti, it had been derelict for a very long time, and at some point had been adopted by one counterculture movement or another. That was, he supposed, before it was turned into the illegal centre for torture of fugitive supersoldiers.
, was the first lie I told myself when this insane idea came into my head. Everything hurt. Yeah, we'd won. I knew how one felt once a battle was over; this wasn't my first, after all. This time I'd skipped the giddy happiness and the life-affirmative sex that sometimes comes straight afterwards. Quietly, I slipped right into the hollowness phase; it was like coming home. We'd won. I felt nothing. It was over. Still nothing. And then, when I stopped feeling nothing, I wished I still did. Feeling nothing had been a bliss.
Tony turned away, leaned against the railing, cast a long, non-seeing glance across the plaza and the surrounding park. "I guess that's pretty accurate, yeah," he said.
Decidedly ignoring the beautifully sculpted and in every way perfect upper arm, Tony grabbed a random snack and started chewing. "A strawberry Santa?" he offered.
Tony's mind was back to reasonably calm, and as soon as that happened, the questions were already waiting in line, vying for his attention. He wondered where Steve had been caught. He wondered how. Most of all, he wondered
But Tony's back hurts from that fall to the floor, no matter how interesting it was with Steve suddenly on top of him and all that. And, while Steve could probably go back and do it all over again, Tony himself is
Tony thinks. Honestly, he was just about toying with the idea. Now he's decided to stay, if only to prove Steve wrong.
