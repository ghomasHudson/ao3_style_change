"Do you want me to leave?" Tony didn't answer again, and so Steve took it as a no, and perched himself in a chair near Tony with a sigh.
Rada was suddenly holding his head gently, and saying things, which if he had to guess would be general sayings of comfort, judging by the tone. She held a bowl to his lips, it smelt bitter, and somewhere at the back of his mind registered natural pain killers, or poison… but he drank it all the same, and soon the pain ebbed and he fell into a deep sleep.
"You do. But I don't quite think you're well enough for a wash yet." Steve chuckled. Now had their relationship been in a better place, Tony probably would have made a joke about a bed bath, but instead kept quiet, just rolled over to press himself into Steve's chest.
"Last Night the Annual gala in New York was full of stars, and war heroes to raise money and awareness for War Veterans. Also, for the first time in three years, Mr Stark attended with Mr Rogers. This is the first time Mr Stark has been spotted since before his abduction, and are we glad to see him. He was dressed in blue Versace, paired with sunglasses, black rather than his usual rose hue, causing some to speculate that there is a problem with his eyesight, but he looked dashing as ever, if not a little slimmer and slightly more scarred, personally I think it adds to that bad boy look.
Tony shook his head, and pulled away from Steve, eyes puffy. He reached around Steve, picked up the discarded tablet, and pulled up what appeared to be some medical machinery, leaving Steve sat on the bed, feeling a little rejected.
Lyosha said something, and Tasha spoke quickly back in the same language, before returning to English. "They think he is either impaired or blind in that eye, if they were ever on his left side, he appeared not to see them there."
"He also revealed to us that he had reconciled with his husband, and they were planning to renew their vows on their eigth anniversary coming up at the end of the year. He also confirmed that he has truly retired as Iron Man, but is still working with the Avenger's in an advisory capacity, and he continues to work with Stark industries as the Head of Research and Development, which recently announced they are creating a new medical branch, a branch that will debut to the public early next year.
"It doesn't have to be 'right', we can just try to make it even a little bit better. Some of those fears may fade with time, some may not. In regards to making things, you can still create things, you may just need more help in physically making them. Peter is pretty good, you could get to know the kid, see if he can help. And if you'll let me this time, I'll be here. We all are."
"Look, I'm not coming back to SHIELD. I don't give a damn what you threaten me with. And I'm on indefinite leave with the Avengers."
"Where am I?" He croaked, his mouth like sandpaper, tongue feeling ten times too big for his mouth. The woman simply smiled at him while shaking her head.
"Honestly, a little. You were out of it last night, and got a little scared when he started screaming at the others, I'm fairly sure you just didn't recognise him at the time, but with that, what happened in Russia, and some of the things he's been struggling with since… he's been struggling. His paranoia is running away from him a little."
While they sat there just breathing Tony couldn't help but acknowledge what a complete and utter mess he was, significantly worse than last time, maybe it's his compounded traumatic experiences, but he couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. Steve didn't need to witness his downward spiral, and feel guilty when the inevitable happened, both of which would surely happen. 'If you want rid of me, you'll have to be the one to do it'. Maybe he should, it would kill him to do it, but it's what's best.
"Hi! Do you have a key?" Pepper jumped out of the car, and the driver eyed her suspiciously, then he seemed to recognise who she was.
"No! Leave me alone! Am I no longer capable of making my own decisions?! What more convincing do you need!" Tony then, with some struggle, but because of his weight loss, it wasn't too difficult, pulled his wedding ring off with his teeth and spat it out on the floor. "There! Is that going to convince you?"
"Does this look like fighting to you?" The Black Widow roared, then a loud bang echoed throughout the room.
As Tony gasped in pain, the two goons shoved him beneath the water. His rational brain knew from experience, that fighting uses up your oxygen more quickly, but his panic from having his Arc reactor taken away, and revisiting his worst nightmares, sent him into a blind panic, causing him to fight tooth and nail.
"Someone is going to pass the message along to him when the battle is over." An older woman with a kind face came into the room, and addressed Robert.
"Tony, wake up." He lay a hand on his shoulder, knowing from experience that going anywhere near the Arc at a time like this was a bad idea, and he knew to be prepared to evade a flying fist, but the man usually woke up quite quickly. Steve gently shook his shoulder, and called his name again, worried that the whimpers only got louder.
"And you shall revoke everyone's access but my own, you can remain at the Avengers Mansion as a security system, but that is all."
"My sense of trust is destroyed too, not your fault. I struggle with fire now. I can't use a sharp knife. I don't like small spaces anymore either. And I can't make things anymore. I only have the one arm, and eye, and I struggle with my focus. I don't know how to make it right." He sniffled into Steve's t-shirt, the other man's arms embracing him tightly.
It was like Bruce was at the end of a tunnel. Tony knew his friends, and husband, were worrying over him, and maybe it was selfish, but he was happy where he was, he didn't want to come back to the pain, confusion and mistrust, that would almost definitely follow if he did.
He opened his mouth to talk, but thought better of it, and pulled one of his books off Tony's bedside table, and settled in to read, leaving Tony to his own thoughts. Although that may have been a bad idea, as a few hours later, after Steve had helped him into bed, and he'd fallen into a light sleep, Tony began to twitch. Steve glanced up from the tablet he now held, and frowned. His frown got deeper when Tony huffed. Having seen Tony have nightmares before, he knew that was what was happening, but while Tony had been in hospital, he had either been in a coma, or a very deep sleep. Between all the exercises, and medications, he was knocked out for the count.
Before long, a glass of orange juice, his blister pack of pills, two slices of toast with butter, and a bowl of tomato soup were placed on the table next to the sofa.
"Right." Bruce's voiced moved around back to Tasha's side, and felt at his wrist and then his neck for a pulse. "Still weak and thready, but marginally better than before. He's still not anywhere near stable, but we need to get him to the Quinjet, I've got better equipment there, and I'm still not convinced he won't go into cardiac arrest on the way." There was silence other than Tony's gurgled panting. "Worth the risk, we'll just need to move quickly. Tasha, that's done, disconnect it, and get to the Quinjet, get everything ready."
"Pepper, leave it. I'm tired. Let me go. Tell everyone I'm sorry. Tell Steve that I do love him, I'm just a terrible person." He then fell unconscious again.
"Same as ever." Clint cleared his throat, then quietly added, "Medically, do you think Steve made the right decision?"
"Bruce! He's stopped breathing!" Steve voice, Tony hadn't heard anything like it before, it was pure unadulterated terror.
He woke up some time later, covered in sweat and gasping, jumping violently went he felt a touch on his left shoulder.
"Fair enough." He yawned, and Steve settled himself behind him, arms wrapped around Tony's waist. "I am sorry. I see now I wasn't alright back then, and I'm not alright now. I justified it that I was protecting you, protecting all of you."
Tony frowned, eyes still closed as the breath tickled his face. He took in a deep breath, at that point was overcome with coughing, a warm hand rubbed up and down his back as he spluttered, then fell back to the mattress, right eye peering open at the concerned face of Steve.
Someone was shaking his shoulder. He opened his eyes to see an unfamiliar male face above him, looking very concerned. Their lips were moving and while Tony could hear some muffled words, they were in a language he didn't speak. If this was one of his captors that he hadn't met, then he didn't have any more energy left to fight, and let himself sink into unconsciousness.
"Come on Steve, breathe." Bucky encouraged him, he didn't particularly like Tony for what he had done to Steve, but he had his suspicion as to why he was doing it, and grudgingly respected him for it, even if it was stupid. "Do you know where his childhood home is?"
"Tasha, I need you to squeeze that bag of fluid into him. Clint, can you try to get a cannula in his foot? Your eyesight and steady hand may be an advantage; he's so dehydrated I struggled with his arm. If you can't I'll have to try to create an intraosseous access, but without the local, it will be short-lived but still unpleasant for him." Tony then felt Clint's rough hands on his foot, but his focus was spotty, and before he knew it, it was done.
Tony stripped off his jogging pants, having taken his t-shirt off after physio earlier, and stepped into the spray that Rob had gotten to a desired temperature before he left.
A few times Rob came in, to change his trachy tube, roll him into a different position, inform him the doctors were being held up with emergency cases from the invasion, but as he was stable at the moment, and the nursing team were keeping a close eye on him, they would come and see him when they could, and assured him that there was no news on the Avengers at the minute.
"If I may, Man of Iron is a warrior, he's been fighting this long, don't give up on him. If he really didn't want to be here, he wouldn't be."
He knew he was dying, infection either from his wounds, or the leftover water in his lungs, and there was nothing he could do about it. There was a sort of peace to that. A finality that he was sure about. He wasn't suicidal, he wouldn't go out of the way to purposely get himself killed, but he didn't see the need in fighting right now, prolonging the inevitable.
He swam to consciousness for short periods over the next few days, he kept flitting between shivering and sweating, but under the surface there was a coldness that was getting larger by the day, his thoughts were slow and his perception of time was disjointed. Except for once or twice, Rada was always there, there was occasionally a male about ten years her junior that appeared every now and then, and tried to speak broken English to Tony, but he was in not state to properly understand, let alone respond.
A tear leaked out of Tony's eye, feeling a mixture of grief and happiness, grief for the lost time, and what he had put everyone through, and happiness that they were all unfailingly there for him. Rob silently grabbed a tissue and wiped the tear away with a kind smile.
Bruce was then gently peeling his eyelids back and a light was being shone into both eyes. "His left isn't reacting as well to the light, but it's not blown."
"You're very welcome, sir. Now my old self would say that you have; two thousand, six hundred and twenty five emails, three hundred and two unopened texts, six hundred and ninety nine missed calls, your voicemail is full-" JARVIS paused as Tony tapped. "Delete them all…? Just anything deemed spam, or government related? With pleasure!"
"Hello Tony." Bruce smiled, Tony smiled back, then froze. It's the first time he had properly looked at Bruce. The man had a significantly larger amount of grey in his hair, more wrinkles on his face, looking more like worry lines, and he had lost maybe a stone, which on the already slim doctor, was shocking. "Are you okay?" The concerned note in Bruce's voice snapped him out of it and he nodded.
The next fifteen minutes were the longest of her life, Steve was only a minute away when he stopped breathing. She quickly checked his pulse, it was still going, so she barely hesitated in mouth-to-mouth, and that's how Steve found them.
Until one day a warm hand was on his cheek, his eyelashes fluttered but he didn't fully rise to consciousness, lacking the energy, even though his slow brain was curious, Rada and Lyosha's hands were always cool on his feverish skin, maybe his fever had broken? Unlikely due to the way he felt.
There was silence as Tasha mulled over his words, spoken in the emotionless voice he had picked up over the last few weeks.
He looked up into the stars, wishing his husband was here while also being pleased he wasn't. Tony really did love Steve, would die for him, but he had this niggling doubt, due to the fact that only Steve knew his whereabouts when he was abducted, and they knew things, very few would know. That and his captors kept goading him about it. He had a long time to think about it in his cell, and while he knew it was a ridiculous way to think, he had managed to partly convince himself that his team hadn't found him because; a) they didn't want him back or b) they had betrayed him. Rationally, he knew this was ridiculous, and that there were many other reasons for this, but the poisonous thoughts had taken root, when he gave himself to them, that's when he threw all caution to the wind and got himself out, so in a way they'd done him a favour.
He switched the TV off. Bucky Barnes. Steve's ex-boyfriend, who last he heard, was dead. He couldn't exactly blame Steve if he had moved on with Bucky, who was Steve's first love. Steve had always been broken up over the other soldier's death, and while Tony had known Steve loved him, he knew Steve had also loved Bucky to the same degree.
"How I've missed that ugly ass face!" Clint strode in, grinning like a Cheshire cat, but Tony's own smile faltered at the thought, vain though it was, he couldn't help but wonder how his face was.
Tony strode through SHIELD headquarters, face like stone, and with an aura of fury about him, no pun intended. Dark shades covered his eyes, and metal glinted around his right arm.
"If anyone is suffering from any of the issues mentioned, go to our website where there are links where you can get help."
"Tony," Said man looked up at the other scientist in the room who was sitting at the end of Tony's bed. "You know Morse code right?" He also knew very basic ASL, but his knowledge of it was pretty useless with only one hand. In response to Bruce he softly tapped out an affirmative on Steve's thigh.
He slowly opened his eyes, blinking drowsily, and seeing only blue in front of him. A relieved hue of blue.
"So, the hospital has given their permission for JARVIS to access the hospital, as long as it is limited to your room only, we pay for an independent team to clear and verify the room when you leave. We will get some sensors installed for him in here tomorrow. I'll work with you to get him online in here tomorrow night, if you feel up to it?"
"Sir, are you okay?" Tony ignored his AI, still trying to get over his disappointment and feelings of failure. At the lack of response from his creator, who continued to stare blankly out of the window, he did the only thing he knew would help, call Steve.
"Would you be willing to temporarily connect JARVIS to this room, and he can translate for you, as I know Thor and I can't understand it." Tony's eyes lit up, and he grinned in response. He had been trying with his writing yesterday, but with the lack of coordination and strength in his fingers, he knew it would be a little while before he could contribute to a conversation. "I'll get on that." He smiled, "Steve? I need to talk to you before we start this." Bruce looked at Steve pointedly, who ducked his head, then nodded.
The door opened again, and Tony heard the gentle squeak of leather, and had a good idea of who it was before they spoke.
A mask was placed over his face, giving him oxygen, and Tony felt a prick in his relatively uninjured arm, but with Rada stroking his hair gently, he barely noticed.
Steve looked down, and seemed to think for a moment. "No. Not at all." He connected his lips with Tony's again. "You know, I wouldn't betray you like that, right?" He asked as he pulled away, looking worried.
Then without waiting for a response, turned and stormed from the room, those in the corridors jumping away, even more terrified of the cruel, cold smirk on his face.
"Do you want to talk about it?" Thor asked after a few minutes, his voice the gentlest Tony had ever heard it.
"Fine, but everyone else is very unhappy with you. Clint's already said that unless you either apologise to Steve, or specifically ask for him to come, he's not going to be here."
"You're going to have a busy day. Doctors are going to review you, especially now you're off the ventilator, they'll try to wean you off the oxygen, and they and the nurses will hopefully get you ready to have the tube out within the next month or so. You'll also start getting more physiotherapy, see if we can't get that right arm working again." Bruce smiled at Tony, while everyone moved to find a seat.
"Okay, thank you Doctor." The door closed, and Tony heard Steve breathing gently, not appearing to be crying this time. "Baby steps." He seemingly muttered to himself.
"Shut up! Both of you!" Now it was Bruce's turn to roar. "You will not do this in front of Tony. Take it outside, and deal with it between the two of you. Steve better not find out what either of you have been saying. He's been crying his eyes out since he made the decision and you shall not make it any harder on him that it needs to be. Now get out."
"I'm sorry, Steve. I don't know why I believed. If you want leave, I understand." Tears had begun to fall down Tony's face, and he was almost surprise when Steve pressed his lips to Tony, and kissed him with a passion Tony hadn't felt from the soldier before.
"Clint-" Steve started, voice hard, but was distracted by Tony coughing, so instead he calmly grabbed the suction and helped to clear up the secretions from his husbands lungs.
He remembered bits and pieces, Tasha sitting next to him, stroking his hair, and laughing tightly at Thor who was regaling them with tales of old battles.
"Tony." Steve said, an hour later, still dressed in his workout gear. Barely hesitating in walking towards the smaller man, and crouching next to him, going to grip his hand, only to have it pulled away into his lap. "It didn't work. We thought it might not. Doesn't mean it won't ever work."
"You gave yourself a chest infection, not looking after yourself properly. A doctor has been out, and says you'll be fine as long as you rest, drink plenty of fluids, get some decent nutrition, and take your tablets." Tony continued to frown at Steve, confused.
"When we interviewed him on the red carpet, Captain America close by, he revealed to us that he had been suffering mentally from the effects of his abduction, and had recently been admitted to a hospital for help. He said he now feels significantly better, is on medication, and encourages others suffering from depression, suicidal thoughts and PTSD to seek help, and not be afraid to talk about it, people are there if you need them. He also announced that he is one of the new public spokesmen for Samaritans, within their mental health branch.
Tony could feel his anger rising, but remembered Rob's deep breathing techniques, and used that to centre himself. Of course Fury wold use it against Steve. He vowed that when he could walk and talk, he'd be making a meeting for the one-eyed director, and it wouldn't be pretty.
Then having little else to do, and trying not to dwell on the events leading up to his coma, he stared absently out of the window at the snow storm.
"Don't even try it Fury." Tony said in a low, dangerous tone, daring him to fight back. "I have enough dirt on you to get a death warrant on your head in almost every country in the world, including this one. I can ruin your life, and your company. What about that wife and daughter that you try so hard to hide? Give a damn about them?"
"Tony? Are you with me?" The warm hand was stroking his cheek. Tony didn't know how to feel at hearing his husband's voice, relieved or scared? He could hear Tasha talking quickly and urgently in the background to Rada and Lyosha by the sounds of things. "His arc reactor is still on, that's good, right?" Steve sounded close to panicking, and Tony could now register Steve's hand shaking on his cheek.
Now just an acknowledging bleep echoed in the room, J really was peeved off with him, but Tony was past the point of caring, he had pushed everyone else away, why not his own creation.
He was warned the removal might fail, and that it didn't mean he would have to live with it forever. But he felt stuck in the mud. It had been almost two months since he had woken up, and while he had strength back in his left arm, his right was still relatively useless, and he could stand for short periods, but was struggling with moving more than a few steps, his muscles still needing more work. He hurt enough already.
"I heard Steve was pretty impressive. Even Fury was taken aback." Tony did his version of a chuckle, then they were both silent for a moment before Bruce turned sombre again.
"Tony, you're going to be alright. It's going to be fine." Pepper said firmly, not letting her tears escape.
"I'm sorry Tony, I know it feels like a step backwards, but your physical physio is getting better, even if you're unable to have the trachy out quite yet. Unfortunately these things can happen, but we'll still keep trying." Lisa, one of his other nurses comforted him as the doctor left after having to reinsert his tracheostomy tube.
Rob then proceeded to fiddle with machines for the next ten minutes, explaining while he did so, and asking Tony to do various things, like deep breathing, then Bruce came back in.
If he was honest with himself, he had hit the inevitable low point, he was still being fed through the tube in his stomach, a PEG, as he was unable to swallow, and he was able to talk, it wasn't the clearest talking, but he could do it, he changed his own inner tubes, as long as someone helped, as he only had his one hand, it gave him a false sense of independence, despite the fact he still had to have someone help him everywhere and wash him.
She fell to her knees next to him, and shakily felt at his neck for a pulse, mildly relieved when she found one, but still terrified by his stillness, she then unzipped his jacket, and saw his reactor flickering.
He heard the word 'sedative', then felt something cool in his arm, which quickly began to slow his breathing down somewhat, and while he didn't quite fall asleep, in his drugged up state, he was far removed from the situation.
"No problem, Steve. He's due for another nebuliser soon anyway." Rob spoke from Tony's left, and then there was suction of something that sounded thick but was over relatively quickly, and then a loud hissing. "Let me know if he needs anything else mate."
"Really?" He sighed, then opened the door and stood aside for her. "I hear anything amiss, i call the police."
"Sir, there appears to be a fault inside the device. Probably due to age, it hasn't been serviced for two years now." And now he remembered why he pushed them all away, to save them from this. He knew he wouldn't be able to fix this fault with his one hand, it wasn't even quite steady enough for the delicate work it needed. He also couldn't exactly remember how the Arc reactor worked, his brain just couldn't focus for long enough to figure it out, he didn't have a spare either.
He felt the sun on his eyelids, but the warmth was coming from his back. He snuggled in closer with a sigh. If this is what the afterlife felt like, he was somewhat pleased he didn't fix his reactor, no matter his regrets as he passed out when the Arc reactor began to fail properly.
When he awoke, the sedative had worn off, and it was mid-afternoon, considering his last recollection was at night, he had slept for quite a while, probably tiring himself out. He jumped as he heard movement to his left, that he was unable to see.
"That's where we found you, quite a bit south. Rada, her husband, son, and brother, Lyosha, lived in the wilderness, and her husband and brother found you. She had some experience as a 'healer', but unfortunately that meant she didn't have access to antibiotics, so when we found you, you were almost dead." Bruce drew a shaky breath, and Tony waited patiently for Bruce to collect himself. "If not for them though, you would have died days before. Also in a cruel twist of fate, Fury for some unknown reason had a good lead on where you were being held, and neglected to tell us for a few days. By the time we got there, you had already escaped. If he had told us earlier, we might have gotten you out, rather than you having to get yourself out. That's also why we're not affiliated with SHIELD anymore."
"Hey Dum." Tony greeted the robot has he sped towards him, holding a duster, Tony was glad when the sturdy metal frame stopped short of his body, he still wasn't very strong, and didn't need more bruises. "Not now bud, I need a rest." Dum-E had been trying to tug Tony towards his workshop, but he was too exhausted to even think about stairs, so half limped his way towards the couch, lay down and quickly fell into an exhausted sleep.
"Maybe they could, but he would have to travel to Asgard, and he isn't stable enough to travel that long distance, if we had been successful weaning him off the ventilator, maybe…" Bruce trailed off. "We can only hope that in a few weeks he can be weaned off it."
"Would you like me to stay?" Tony thought about it for a moment and shook his head, he appreciated that in his incapacitated state he was given the choice rather than being told, and with his world on its head, it genuinely felt like a blessing.
"If you prefer Mr Barnes, place me on speaker." Bucky did so. "So Mr Barnes, as I have been banned against speaking to anyone deemed as Sir's friends or family, and you fall into neither group, I thought it best to call you. I am also not allowed to release his whereabouts. Or his current state of health."
"You're awake!" Steve ran over and hugged Tony tightly, and Tony raised an eyebrow over Steve's shoulder, and Bruce just mouthed back a 'later'.
Tony pulled the reactor out, quickly swapped the wires with Dum-E's help, and leaned back in his workshop chair. His heart seemed to keep jumping in his chest at random points, and he could swear that he felt the shrapnel moving in his chest, so either a problem with his biological heart, or his mechanical one.
"I've given him some Morphine; it will help with the pain." Bruce's voice was gentle as he gently probed Tony's ribs. "Try to carry him with his left side closest to you. Four of his ribs on his right are broken, and it might be easier on his arm.
"St-Steve, maybe we should let him go. He doesn't want to be here. Maybe we should give him his choice for once."
He couldn't see his enemies following, which was worrying him. If they could not see the need to chase him, they must be sure he wouldn't get very far.
"-and that is when my dear Jane told me I am to be a father! I have yet to tell our comrades as I wanted to see you first of all and relieve your good man. He's not looking very well. He sleeps here every night, and has refused to go on any of Fury's orders. That is why my father gave me permission to return to Earth. Jane ordered me too, actually. My mother will look after her, it's too unsafe for her to travel through the Bifrost you see. Falcon has been working quite well though, providing some aerial support. They also tried with a temporary replacement, a Daredevil I believe, but while he does a good job, he doesn't work very well as a team member. I do believe a Doctor Strange has offered his services for any world issues, apparently, he is a sorcerer from Earth!" Thor sounded surprised, like the things he had seen and heard on Earth was so normal up to that point.
"That means it's working, keeping the shrapnel away. One less thing to worry about. What I'm concerned about is his lungs." Bruce said from Tony's other side, fingers feeling at his right wrist for a pulse, unknown to Bruce until Rada shouted, and Tony cried out in pain, eyes flying open, rapidly forgetting where he was, just seeing several people around him and experiencing pain, and quickly falling into a panic.
Washing his body went fine, if not a little slow with one arm in a sling, it only came to when he stuck his head under the spray that the issues arose. Tony had experienced feelings like these before, not long after Afghanistan, but the intensity of this flashback seemed worse. Maybe due to the fact he had now been waterboarded on two separate occasions, suffocated in space once, and the feeling of no oxygen when Obadiah and the guys in Russia had removed his Arc reactor, the former for the reactor itself, the latter, for fun. But he suddenly couldn't tell where he was, or even give himself a chance to calm down, he just lost all coherent thought, just that terrifying feeling of suffocation overwhelmed him.
‘Is there something I can do to make up for it?’ Steve asked, feeling a little bad for the scratches Redwing left on the man’s face.
'Stark, we got new info!' Bucky said as he threw a file on Tony's desk. 'Stefanie talked to Julia and convinced him to talk to you. You gotta go out in the field again.'
'Wait there,' Tony said before he ran down the stairs, through the halls, and into the gardens. The boy hadn't moved.
'Bring the bikes back to the car, then walk back up and help me down,' explained Steve. 'It's probably the only way to get out of here without the bikes getting stolen. There are a lot of people strolling around here.'
Tony came back soon, only two weeks later, to attend his parents funeral, who had died in a car crash.
Clint got up and sat down in one of the other chairs and Tony took his usual place. They fastened their seatbelts and soon they were up in the air. Tony didn’t really say much during their trip, while Clint couldn’t stop talking. He kept speculating about the dragon and what the super soldier would look like.
'So, were you in the army?' Tony asked as he pushed up his sunglasses and nodded at the dog tags around Steve's neck.
Steve made his way towards the offices. They called it offices, but it wasn’t anything big. Just a few office buildings around a square with restaurants. Steve had worked at the coffee shop on the square when he was still in art school. It was a lively place during weekdays, but during weekends, not so much. Redwing might like the quiet though. The bird was smart, it knew where to go. It was so smart that it recognized its own name. Good for Redwing, good for Sam, but less good for Steve. It meant he actually had to call the budgie.
Okay, so maybe that hadn't been his best plan ever. Steve picked himself up again and got closer to the robot. It was smashing his claws around randomly now that it couldn’t see, hitting cars and buildings. Luckily the agents had moved out of its way. Steve took his shield with both hands and when the robot tried to hit him again, somehow it could still hear things, he stepped aside and slammed his shield in the claw, cutting off one of its six arms. It was a start.
'Nice,' Tony grinned. 'Well, let me know if you win this show or not. I gotta keep up with my donut diet and I only want the best! You deserve to win. Good luck Steve! If you don't have a boyfriend, or girlfriend, when this is over I'll date you!'
'Hi!' the young prince greeted the mysterious boy. He was pretty small and rather thin. 'You’re not really allowed in here. How did you even get in?'
Tony ran out of people to slap on their butt. He did it to Thor, who was a security guard on the ground floor. He was a man who easily made friends and Tony convinced him that he greeted all his friends by touching their butts. When Steve walked in Tony had slapped Thor's ass on impulse. Thor being way too friendly for his own good accepted Tony’s explanation without any questions. His great plan backfired though. Ever since then Thor slapped Tony's butt when he walked into the building. It was so bad that Tony took the private backdoor sometimes.
‘Are you fucking kidding me, Robin Hood?’ Tony sighed. ‘You can sleep in the plane. We’re leaving in an hour.’
Being an eccentric billionaire wasn't as easy as Tony had thought. He couldn't just slap anyone's butt and it also had to be in front of Steve. If Steve didn't see it then what would be the point?!
‘I’m happy for you, really, Tony better not break your heart, or I’ll break his bank account. You know what, I’m feeling a lot better. Go grab us some beers, I’m gonna kick your ass in Mario Kart.’
“I’m not most people,” Steve says, now sitting down on the bench across from Tony to yank off his boots. “There’s barely any on me, I think most of it got on the suit.”
“And I thought - that after our road trip, after I drop Morgan back with Pepper, we could stop in on a few of them.”
“Congratulations,” Pepper practically drawls, and yeah, that’s definitely boredom, and he’s not happy about it. “Shall I draw up the engagement announcement for The Times? Or would you rather arrange for a spread in People?”
Nothing has changed, as Pepper emerges from a wide hallway. She’s barefoot and as beautiful as ever and doesn’t look surprised by the extra body, but that doesn’t put Steve at ease even as they modestly hug in greeting.
As hard as some of them had partied after defeating Thanos, Tony just remembers a lot of sleeping and conferencing in with T’Challa and various world leaders. He can imagine that Steve’s week resembled his pretty closely, only with shorter periods of unconsciousness.
“I know,” Steve says gently. “I intended on staying this long, anyway. Long enough to see you through Thanos.”
There’s a sense of urgency underneath it all, a feeling that Steve can’t quite put his finger on. This is something important, Steve knows without verifying. He knows that Tony is important, and being here with him is important, wherever he is.
Over the last seventy-plus years, Steve has learned that the blame lies with everyone, and to dwell on it is to everyone’s detriment.
“They’re your family too,” Tony says, and he sounds as angry as Steve feels. “I could move to Malibu. Save myself the trouble of personally escorting Morgan to upstate New York every other week.”
There’s a growing discontent on nights Clint orders pizza, because Steve point-blank refuses to have anything to do with Tony’s olive and mushroom and insists that the Hawaiian isn’t as blasphemous as everyone else says it is.
“Okay,” Denise relents. “One movie, if everyone gets ready for bed. But then it’s to your rooms for the night.”
Steve thinks that for as much as he’d left New York with self-preservation in mind, he doesn’t have very much left.
Dragging the toilet paper over his mouth, Tony staggers to his feet and Steve backs up to make room for him.
Fury leaves only after he’s demolished the better half of one of Peggy’s biscuit packets, and Steve grumbles loudly about having to go to the store to restock. Steve walks him to the door, glad that the serum has preserved enough muscle and coordination that he doesn’t need assistance, not yet at least.
Only for a moment, though. Iron Man disappears high into the sky, shooting off till Steve’s vaguely concerned about whether or not he’ll be coming back down. And that’s what does it: Steve is reminded that Tony’s been living in an entirely different world than Steve has. There’s nothing to link them, really, nothing but a few bizarre encounters, some inappropriate feelings, and lapses in judgment.
“I wasn’t hiding it,” he points out, and Tony cradles the frame carefully, not wanting to leave smudges on the picture that had clearly earned a place of honor amongst Steve’s minimalist decorating style. “You can look all you want.”
“Come here,” he says, kissing the furrow away and taking the whipped cream and chocolate sauce out of Steve’s hands. “I’ll show you what to do with these.”
Life has been better for Steve since the Tony Stark piece, but not even close to good enough to warrant investing in his own personal tux. Journalism is still journalism, and as someone who isn’t routinely invited to soirées of a high caliber - think, the White House - he’s been relegated to renting. At best, he’s really only gotten a glimpse of life in the next tax bracket. At heart he’s still that boy from Brooklyn, struggling to put himself through a gamble of a college major while living on a prayer that it’ll pay off one day. And now that it’s paid off, he can pretend to mingle with the snottiest of them, floating by on genuine smiles and the sort of endearing boyishness that he knows won’t last beyond another year or two, when the lines in his face start sticking around.
“Bold of you to assume you’ll be around that far into the future, Rogers,” Tony retorts, but Steve can hear the fondness in his tone.
“Nobody had to,” Clint chuckles. “You didn’t bat an eye when he asked for help getting sunscreen on his back.”
What he hadn’t realized was his deep-seated belief that if he hadn’t been so selfish, then maybe he would have discovered his feelings for Tony much sooner. And subsequently, he hadn’t realized that in his desperation to reconcile those feelings with the life he had originally led, he’d pinned all those feelings on an alternate version of himself.
After they make their way back to the bedroom with the intention of getting some more clothes on their bodies, Tony enthusiastically returns the favor and Steve nearly puts a fist through the wall. Tony refuses to allow him a shirt, and Steve just rolls his eyes as he pulls on pants.
He expects Steve to open his mouth; whether to defend or lambast his from-another-timeline counterpart, Tony can’t decide, it’s a fifty-fifty shot. Steve’s mouth goes thin, holding back anything he might have to say in a relatively rare display of restraint, and there’s something decidedly melancholic about the sudden change in his expression as he scuffs the toe of his boot against the driveway.
“Yeah,” Tony’d said, free hand finding Steve’s pulse again, using it to help regulate his own rapid respirations. “We did it together.”)
Once he’s told Tony about his private send-off and left out any details that could hint towards Steve’s feelings about Tony, in this world or the other, Tony heaves himself out of the chair.
“I’m making margaritas,” she says, stealing Rhodes’ knife and grabbing a bag of limes. “What are the chances Tony shows up with Parker?”
The water sluicing through the dirt and blood is heavenly as he closes his eyes and holds his face under the spray. The shower lasts so long he nearly falls asleep standing up, so exhausted and bone-weary that he really believes he could, but only the threat of a cracked skull convinces him to carry on. The Wakandan soil swirls around the floor before washing down the drain and he takes care to get it out front under his fingernails, remembering with startling clarity how it had gotten there in the first place. As he’s rinsing conditioner out of his hair, he remembers the nanite gauntlets retracting long enough for him to feel for Steve’s carotid, carving away streaks of mud to access the pulse point and not trusting anyone but himself in that moment, not even FRIDAY.
“Then what is it?” Tony asks, arms flinging about. Steve tracks a single bead of coffee as it flies over the edge and drips down the glazed paint. “Do you finally feel guilty about letting me do all the talking? Because I’ve got a lot of questions for you, so I’m more than willing to partake in a little quid pro quo.”
Tony kisses him again, and this time it goes on and on and on, light and joyous in a way that perfectly encapsulates everything Steve knows he is feeling, and hopefully everything that Tony is feeling too. In between, when Steve raises their joined hands to ensure that the cosmos are still in place, Tony swipes his tongue over his bottom lip and kisses the corner of Steve’s mouth.
“Jesus,” Tony says thickly, and Steve tilts his head down to look at him. “That’s just - I can’t even imagine - what the
He starts to look a little sick as Steve talks, and Steve gets it. It’s got to hurt, knowing what the alternative could have been, except that isn’t exactly true.
“Did we…” He feels his breath quicken, tells himself that it’s a natural reaction to his prolonged exposure to the outdoors, but attempts to control it anyway. “Did something happen?”
“You need to eat, Cap,” Tony says firmly, as they slide into the booth of a deli that might be a diner. He’s pushing his luck, he knows, especially since he’s already managed to threaten Rogers into civilian clothing after his newest uniform had gotten purple alien goo all over it.
“Has he told you yet?” Peggy is saying, clinging to Rogers’ hand with watery eyes when Steve gets there. “Has he told you his big secret?”
“I’m getting what I want,” Tony says, because he can already feel the low simmering burn radiating from within. “Don’t worry about me.”
“Oh yeah?” he asks, eyebrows raised sky-high. “So you’re telling me that you think my soulmate is someone who’s okay with me risking my life all the time, flying around in a very expensive tin can with an experimental power source?”
“I’m serious,” he says, clinging to the vestiges of his dignity as he turns the knob. “You’re not getting away with leaving it there. You should know me better than that.”
“Sure,” Sam says, and Steve sips his coffee and watches a perfume commercial, this one featuring a woman in a floaty dress frolicking through a field before the screen switches to a bank ad. “But if you wanted to...”
Howard lights another cigarette. Steve crushes his under the toe of his shoe, stares out around them, and reminds himself of why he’s here.
“You might not like it,” Steve says, not a warning, but close. “In fact, I’m pretty sure you won’t like it.”
“I hope he’s all healed soon, then,” he says, forcing himself to keep his tone even no matter how badly he can feel it wanting to wobble.
“Did you love him?” she asks, and there’s no judgment to color her tone. There’s nothing except a desire to know, to understand.
Steve pulls at his hair and doesn’t stop, even when his ears feel hot. “Yeah. There is. D’you think I could come back to the compound for a few follow-up questions?”
It could be cruel, but when Tony sets his eyes on Rogers’ baby blues, there’s no judgment to be seen.
“Actually, I’d love to forget the time with the force field,” Tony counters, and he flips off the cap to find that it’s ready for use, squirting out just barely enough to gauge the viscosity. “You’re telling me that you brought me here not only to tell me Benjamin Button’s deepest darkest secret and confess your undying love for me, but also to consummate what I presume is supposed to be the start of a long and healthy union?”
When Steve blinks back to the present, tearing himself away from the muddled memories of an encounter that will forever be splashed with a giant question mark no matter how many times he tells himself that it’s irrelevant, it’s to see Tony looking at him with a sort of disappointment hidden in the fine lines around his eyes. Only it’s not just disappointment, there might be hurt lurking there too, and none of what has happened actually adds up in a way that makes the expression make sense. All Steve’s done is decline an invitation that’s probably more hot air than anything, and yet Tony looks like Christmas has just been cancelled.
He should have gotten more, he realizes. More about the imminent retirement, facts and details. Instead of doing his job properly, he was too busy demanding to know what he was doing there because he’s never been able to see past his own nose wherever Tony has been concerned.
Steve’s words get stuck, because he knows it’s another one of those once-in-a-lifetime offers, but he doesn’t want it, not really. He wants to argue with Tony about human rights and where the blame truly lies. The last thing he wants is to have to play nice with a group of heroes he doesn’t know, especially when he’s invested so much time and energy into managing his attitude surrounding Tony’s mere existence.
“Stop doing this to yourself,” Tony mutters against sensitive skin, teeth scraping just rough enough to have Steve needing to resist the urge to shout out. “Stop trying to stop this.”
“I should go to bed,” Tony says, once it’s clear that Steve won’t be breaking the silence. He picks at the label on the bottle, sticky residue transferring to his nail.
A litany of curse words flits through Steve’s brain when he wakes up, jolted into consciousness with a flurry of disorientation.
“Yeah, right,” he says, rocking back on the rear legs of his chair. “Like he ever-so-helpfully reminded me, I couldn’t even get my relationship to work out.”
“No,” is all Tony gets, and he presses his lips against whatever patch of skin is available directly below them.
Inspired, Tony raises an index finger to trail up Steve’s bare chest, glimmering with a fine layer of hard-earned sweat. He finds a nipple, scraping over it idly a couple of times before Steve wraps his hands around the finger and easily wrestles it away.
“I’d think a guy like you would be more experienced when it came to doing what you want,” Tony said, elbowing him. "And not caring about what others expect."
“And yet you won’t open the box,” she says, her airy tone a dreadful contrast to the leaden sensation in Steve’s limbs. “Noted.”
Tony sniffs in exaggerated disdain, Steve’s easy nonchalance bringing out his desire to stomp all over his own feelings and cover them up with his signature billionaire flair. “Yeah, I guess I can mingle with the bourgeoisie for a hot minute.”
The damn photo with the girls. They’d posted it online and it had gone viral, and it had caught the attention of one of Clint’s kids, and from there the game of telephone had made its way around until it made its way back to Steve.
“He went back,” Steve reminds him, effortlessly coaxing Tony to fullness with evenly paced strokes. “Maybe they’re not done.”
“Tony says he’s coming back,” Rogers says, and Steve believes it. “Says he’s got some loose ends to tie up.”
Steve breaks the kiss, gasping for fevered air in the tiny cordoned-off backseat with midnight-blackened windows. Seemingly unaffected by the disruption, Tony attaches his mouth to Steve’s neck and trails biting kisses down towards the collar.
“Oh, totally,” Tony agrees. “I definitely don’t remember that recent mission where you told Wanda to do whatever it took to get those wannabe HYDRA goons crying for their mothers. That was so very well thought out.”
There aren’t words for how much Tony has meant to him over the years, and how very little significance they have actually held to each other.
to delve into this man’s life until he has enough with which to paint a glossy picture for anyone to read, should they want to.
“Not. That one,” Steve repeats, and now there’s just one bag left in the cart, and Tony pulls a face before exaggeratedly hefting it up and into his arms.
He’s stripping off his safety glasses - perched on the top of his wild nest of hair, thank you very much - and gloves, tossing them on the closest flat surface while striding over.
“Natasha,” he murmurs, and she leans into his palm. When he looks, she is out of focus and just as beautiful as he remembers.
Tony looks back, just as serious and yet more ebullient than Steve would have imagined him capable of.
“Did they?” Tony asks, leaning in with interest just as fresh as it was hours before when Steve first began to unravel the threads of his life for him.
Feeling queasy, like the cold coffee might be making its way back up his throat, Steve carefully lifts his own hands to lock thumbs and forefingers around Tony’s wrists. He might as well be moving in slow motion for how long it takes, doing his best not to tremble as he pulls Tony’s baffled hands away from his face with surgical precision. Tony doesn’t protest or stiffen as Steve moves him. That, at least, Steve is grateful for.
At least Steve can blame the heat in his cheeks on the flames from the grill, he figures. It’s not like he’s interested in maintaining plausible deniability, not when his thighs ache as pleasantly as they do, but when Tony comes by to rest a hand on the small of his back and ask if he wants another Long Island Iced Tea, he can’t quite meet Clint’s humored eyes.
“I wear clothes,” Carol says, rolling her eyes as she goes for the coffee. “Just because some of us are confident with our bodies - ”
Floating around the party like an actual guest isn’t exactly recommended; there’s a press room for a reason, no matter how much of an effort Christine puts into harassing Alison Williams, something Steve’d attempted to remind her that she’s not supposed to do regardless of how famous her father is. But Steve lingers on the edges, by the bathrooms, by the bar, and waits to strike when these people are on the verge of letting their guard down. It’s worked well for him so far: he’s gotten skincare advice from Jesse Tyler Ferguson’s rather handsome boyfriend, helped Amy Poehler locate one of her sitcom co-stars, and spent a solid five minutes making fun of the photo booth set up with an actor who’d look a lot like Clint if Clint ever bothered to ditch the purple t-shirts and wash his hair.
Steve clears his throat, smoothing a hand down his hopelessly wrinkled front. It gets Tony’s attention, head whipping in Steve’s direction, and it feels cowardly to dare to look anywhere but directly at him.
In the early afternoon, he drinks over-creamed coffee and gnaws his way through a hastily-assembled sandwich while he listens to the interview - again.
Steve,” she says, and Steve feels his shoulders cave in at her tone. They’ve never been close but he still can’t get a read on how she feels about his presence, and the last thing he wants is to make her uncomfortable.
Tony can’t wrench his gaze away, starry-eyed and single-minded, and Steve knows he’s just as bad. They dry each other off and find the blankets when they find the bed again, and Steve holds Tony to him and never wants to let go. He only stills once they’re completely tangled, legs slotted together and the planes of Tony’s bare back a grounding presence against Steve’s still-pounding heartbeat.
“It’s been keeping me busy,” Pepper says with the kind of good-natured grimace most people reserve for acquaintances and coworkers. “And you know how Tony is. Even without him at the helm, he still manages to find ways to order me around.”
When Steve gives Beth back her phone with the promise that she won’t be bothered anymore, he feels strange.
“Yeah, well, I’m not just anyone,” Steve retorts. It’s not clever, but he’s putting too much effort into tamping down a scowl to come up with anything better.
“You should go to bed, Cap,” Tony says while watching his fight off another yawn. “You’ve been awake for too long.”
Morgan refuses to hug Pepper goodbye and just heads for the front door, which must be a common enough occurrence that Pepper doesn’t seem too bothered by it.
- it just wasn’t the same. And we talked about it, thought about co-parenting under the same roof. Because hey, who doesn’t like living with one of their best friends, and their favorite kid?”
When Tony can’t sleep one night, he heads down to the kitchen in the hopes that a snack will curb the racing thoughts in his head. What he finds is Steve Rogers sat at the counter, tucking into what looks suspiciously like a microwave baked potato.
They walk and talk about how ridiculous city officials are, and bet on whether Bruce or Natasha will be most upset with them for ditching. Steve points out that Natasha will be livid while Bruce will merely be disappointed, and they debate which is worse until the sun begins to set. They find a hot dog stand and load up with mustard and sauerkraut, and Steve narrowly avoids dripping down his front as they walk around the reservoir, the sun slipping low in the sky to indicate how much time has passed.
“Tony,” Steve says, and this time he does fully huff, even as his back arches and he shoves himself down to Tony’s knuckles. “I am begging you to stop worrying about vectors and velocity and whatever else is going on in your head right now, and just enjoy this with me.”
“I don’t blame you,” Tony says with a sigh once his face is done going through quite the journey, traveling through indignation and outrage and reluctant acceptance.
“Maybe,” she says, but it doesn’t feel ominous, and when he goes under again, he doesn’t worry about whether he will see her again.
“It’s just an idea,” he says expansively, as if to make sure that Steve knows he means it, that he’s not expecting anything right now. “Right now things have been quiet, but we both know it won’t always be like that. Realistically, the world is going to need some help again, and when that happens, I think you’re a pretty good candidate for teaching the next generation how we did things back in our day.”
“Do you need money?” Tony speaks up, and he sounds different. Like he’s forcing the brightness into the words. “I can send more. Whatever the kids need.”
“What could you want to know?” he asks, a little desperate for more and a lot knowing that he should end this before it goes any further. If he’s not careful, he’ll make a damp mess of his underwear and that’s not going to be fun to explain to the designer’s representative. “I’m just a journalist.”
It’s hard not to smile at that, as Steve looks to where Tony is refereeing the entire ordeal and playing devil’s advocate as Wanda politely offers Sam another chance at beating her. He’s wearing sinfully tight shorts and has stolen Steve’s sunglasses, his own still perched on the top of his head.
'Perfect! That's a wrap everybody, time for lunch! See you next week,' Tony said as he got up. The others packed their things as well. 'Oh, Steve, can you stay for a moment?'
Steve knew almost everything about this man, except his real name. He made everyone call him Ronan. He owned several night clubs throughout New York. They looked like normal clubs, but they were used for selling drugs, money laundering, or illegal prostitution. Ronan had a few dozen guys working for him. Now and then one of them tried to get some money for themselves, or tried to talk to the police, but somehow they always disappeared. Ronan was terrifying, but Steve kept a smile on his face. He was wearing an ear piece, a microphone, and contact lenses through which Sam could see the same things Steve saw. Everything was recorded.
Two weeks passed by too fast. Tony offered Steve to take the car, he would pay for it, but Steve refused. When you were alone hitchhiking was more fun, and filling up the car all the time would be expensive. But Steve did go to the airport with Tony.
'No, Tony, I remember last night very well. I've seen your penis from pretty close up, so go and call Pepper and then get changed. We don't want to be late for Rhodey's dinner!'
'Impossible,' Steve stated. 'How can anyone steal it when you packed it and will take it back to the U.S.?'
And to his own horror he slapped Steve's butt. As Tony realized what he'd done he held his breath . He saw confusion in Steve's eyes, but before he could say something Tony closed the door. He closed it too quickly, he knew it, it was like he slammed it in Steve's face, but he panicked!
‘Yeah, a bit abstract, but explicit at the same time,’ Steve answered. He pulled a face as he took a closer look at the painting. ‘Not really the tasteful nudes you’d want to see in a gallery.’
Steve hurried to the changing room, dumped his shirt, jeans and shoes in his bag. He emptied his little locker and took everything that belonged to him. He was never coming back. None of them were ever coming back.
The next day she died. A few days later was the funeral. Steve had arranged most of it himself, to keep himself busy. But at the funeral he couldn’t say a word, couldn’t do anything. He could only cry. Tony held his right hand, while Steve's best friend Bucky held his left. Neither of them let go of him during the ceremony.
‘Speaking about presents and kids,’ Steve continued. ‘Since neither of us have kids desperately waiting for us to come home so they can open their presents, how about breakfast? I know a place a few blocks from here and I checked, it’s open. They do this special Christmas breakfast with cinnamon rolls and glazed berry tarts.’
James was listening to every word Steve was saying, and Steve was tempted to tell his own stories instead of Bucky’s. He really wanted this man to know the real him and not the weird combination of him and his best friend. James seemed to be really interested, he even asked all kind of questions. They didn’t steal food from each other’s plates and they didn’t share a dessert, but it felt strangely romantic anyway. Maybe it was because of all the candles and flowers, or maybe it was the flirting lines James weaved through his casual conversation. Only when the restaurant was about to close the two of them got up and left.
‘We do,’ Tony said, and he grinned as he shook Nick’s hand. ‘So, give me the coordinates and I’ll fly there. I’ll bring you back your superman.’
'I can't come with you, but Tasha is on her way, as an agent, not as a hero. No contract yet, so agents only. Good luck!'
'I tried to escape once, but they hit me and told me they'd kill my sister. They gave me the tattoo that day, to show everyone that Ronan owns me. I was forced to work in a brothel.  They told me I would get a better life if I behaved. I hoped that if I tried my best they would one day let me go. But they just moved me to a more classy brothel, so they could earn more money. Whenever Ronan's gang gets new people I have to do them for free. Me or one of the others. Today was such a day. I can handle the sex on normal days, but today there were two of them and they were rough.'
He worked for an hour. Half way through Happy joined him and handed him another coffee before he sat down and played a game on his phone. Tony made great progress with his work and he wasn't too happy to be disturbed when the hour was over already. Until he remembered he got to eat pastries now. He was finally getting to the good parts of this show!
‘How do I look?’ Bucky asked as he walked into Steve’s bedroom. He turned to show off his outfit. His long hair was neatly tugged into a bun and his clothes were casual, but stylish. It was weird to see him so dressed up, normally he just wore simple t-shirts or hoodies.
'We could still end up without witnesses,' Bucky said. 'They're scared. We can't risk this without knowing for sure at least one of them is going to take this to court.'
‘The hell I am,’ Tony said. ‘I’m moving back to my home in Malibu. I’ve been your lap dog for too long, I’m out of here. I’ve been helping you out for years and you won’t even help me with this pest problem.’
Tony could finally take a good look at the man, and he took his helmet off for that. Steve was tall, with nice blond hair, and blue eyes. He was almost twice as broad as Tony, without the suit, and his arms were about as thick as Tony’s legs. This man looked like one of those Greek statues. Nothing terminator, nothing transformer, this man was hot!
‘Yeah, might affected the spark plugs too,’ Tony sighed. ‘If they broke, we gotta replace them and I don’t know if they have stuff like that lying around here.’
'I'd do that if we could, Brooklyn- boy,' the man said. 'But by the time this thing cooled down, the sun will be setting and it will be too dark to see a damn thing! There are no street lights.'
'He only talked to me,' Steve answered, voice low, so none of the others could hear him. 'At first I didn't mind, easy money, but I got a little nervous when he kept talking about abuse. He wanted to know if I was forced to do this job against my will. Did he ask you too?'
'Camera contact lenses,' Steve grinned. 'I'm sure our teams have found each other by now. Probably having some very unpleasant discussions about sharing information. For once in glad I'm not allowed back inside the station for a while.'
Other passengers were picked up by friends and family, but there was no one waiting for Tony. It didn't matter. Minutes before Tony died Steve had promised he would follow soon. How long had it been? One day? Two? It didn't matter.
Bucky looked up as well now. ‘You’re late. We were almost sure that you had gone home with whomever you had that blind date with. Was it a guy or a girl? Where they hot? Tell me everything!’
The brother scoffed, looking over their latest world. “I can’t believe that whole civil war mess was avoided in this world because I had tits and apparently Captain America likes those.”
Tony looked up, his big bambie eyes, looking like he couldn’t believe Steve just asked that. “Are you serious?”
The Ten Rings had blown up their home and had taken his entire family. Tied each one of them up and was filming something. To who Steve had no idea.
Her daddy puts a hand over his heart. “You wound me Nat. I was very handsome silver fox in the other timeline. Though nothing could beat your beautiful blush when you finally tied the knot with Clint and Laura.”
“Remember your promise Daddy, you and Uncle Steve are going to get married when he dies,” Morgan said as she swayed to the music.
Daddy looked younger than Morgan had ever saw him, his hair darker, and a greater muscle mass. He never fully recovered from his trip to space. He looked lighter than Morgan had ever seen him, like he was Atlas with the world no longer on his shoulders. He was see through now too, and he could float. He was still her daddy though.
“Sexy,” Steve growled in Tony’s ear, the way he knew made Tony weak in the knees. “Perhaps my little mechanic is looking for a captain to help pilot this ship”
The door opens, revealing the same woman that had tipped Steve off the first time that something was wrong. All the same mistakes as before, from her outfit to her
Tony winced but nodded. He knows how much Steve hates lying, but technically he didn’t lie, just didn’t say the whole truth either. Tony counts the exits, three if he counts the window that is five stories up from the ground. Tony counts his hidden weapons. Ten hidden all around the room, the closest to him being in his nightstand.
“Steve!” Her daddy launches himself at Uncle Steve, both of them holding and kissing each other like only lovers could.
'How do I look?' Steve asked with a big grin as he stepped out of the men's room. He was wearing a wig, make up, a dress, and impossibly high heels.
Steve smiled. ‘It did. Because we don’t actually have to go to the hospital to deliver the patients to you, we can move on to the next case quickly. I’m only here at the beginning and the end of my shift, or when I need to pick up extra supplies. So I guess we either worked different shifts, or we just didn’t end up in the changing room at the same time.’
'Yeah, I'm the man in charge and this is my brother in law, Mauro. He'll be judging with us today,' Buddy said as he took Tony inside. They stopped in front of two big doors. 'The contestants are waiting here. I'll go talk to them and when I call you in, just follow Mauro. The bakers don't know yet that you're our client for today.'
'You're inspiring! And this is definitely for the bedroom, because I'm not planning on painting you with any clothes on,' Steve winked.
'Everyone else support them with everything they need, keep looking for information and make sure there is back up ready at all times,' Fury warned the rest of the team, ignoring Bucky’s complains. 'We have seen how things can turn for the worse in no time. Keep the gunfight Barnes got into three months ago in your head. Ronan’s men are always armed. We can't have our people in there when things go wrong. Dismissed!'
'We'll do that when we have a project to motivate them to play sports,' Natasha said, rolling her eyes.
Clint walked into the room and gave the door a little push. It didn’t completely shut, so he still had a little light to see where he was going. He walked to Steve and sat down next to him against the wall.
'Yes,' Steve answered. 'If I were alone right now, I'd probably go on this trip with her, maybe travel to the next village together and then we'd both go our own way again. I met a lot of really nice people that way.'
'I meant a mascot or something,' Steve explained. 'A figure that does cool sciency things. We can put it on the flyers, on the walls in the workshop, but also on the toolboxes. We can make it some superhero who builds himself all kinds of stuff to fight bad guys or something.'
Tony started laughing. ‘A dragon? Do you believe in fairytales, Nick? A dragon, really? Wow, this is precious. Your agents were killed by a dragon while they tried to steal a human super weapon. Wow, you should try writing books, this story would sell!’
‘Keep it, it looks better on you than it does on me,’ Steve said, before he kissed Tony. He had missed those lips more than he would ever admit out loud.
With that said he slapped Tony’s butt. Tony winced. Thor was a great guy, but sometimes he didn’t seem to realize how strong exactly he was. Steve took pity on him.
Steve ignored him and flirted with Tony. He really hoped they would be interrupted by the policeman, but it was almost eleven and he still wasn't there! When Tony went to get more drinks, Steve's demanded an explanation from Sam.
Rhodey grabbed his phone from his pocket. ‘You still owe me 274 favors, see? If you don’t want to be in debt until you die, you better help me out now.’
'Hammer's weapons aren't as good as yours,' Rhodey laughed as they walked out of Tony's office. 'But they'll do, we can work with them. I didn't come here to talk about that, but I came with other good news.'
'I tried everything I could. Nothing else could make me fly. I'm sure magic is the only way, but I don't know anyone with magic. I'll never fly.'
Tony arrived late at the bakery and lied to the director that he was incredibly busy and that he just got out of a meeting with someone who had to fly back to Hong Kong in a few hours. It worked, the director looked impressed.
'Don't all those guys get a new identity?' James "Rhodey" Rhodes asked. He was the one monitoring Tony. 'From what I read in your reports there are at least five more guys who are forced to work there. Just because they weren't invited to one of Tony's meetings they'll be forced to continue doing this?'
'Was Tony Stark just holding you?' Natasha asked. 'Do you have something you need to tell us, Steve?'
'I'm Stefanie,' Steve smiled. 'I've never seen you here before, Tony, I'm sure I would have remembered that. Is it your first time here?'
'It's a good way to promote the workshops,' Natasha said. 'And the money we earn can go back into the project.'
They stayed in the cave for a while, enjoying the view, before they were told to put their lights back on. They had to peddle their way through the calm water, before it got rougher again and they just had to hold on tight. It ended with climbing back up, carrying the tube, until they arrived at the starting point.
‘Deal,’ Sam said, a grin on his face. He knew that Steve really didn’t mind having the cute birds all over him. He was never going to grow out his hair.
Steve was sitting at the kitchen table, reading the newspaper on his table, his breakfast sat on the table in front of him. He looked up when his friend walked in, but he frowned at the request. ‘What kind of favor?’ he asked. ‘I’m not helping you to pull a prank on Clint again, especially after what happened last time.’
Being a genius could be very nice thing. Not only did Tony get a lot of work done, but at the same time he could plan what to say to Steve next time he saw him. Not that he had trouble talking, fuck no, the opposite. He said too much and he didn't want to scare the hot guy away. Although Steve seemed like he could handle it, he handled his hobo look after all. It was all bullshit, Tony knew it. He just wanted an excuse to think about the walking wet dream without having to admit to himself that he was fantasizing about him. Tony Stark didn't fantasize, he was a man of action!
‘No, I’m not kidding you,’ Steve answered. ‘It’s the truth. I went on that second date because I liked you too, but I told Bucky to tell you the truth. He refused, not until he wasn’t sure if he and that girl were going to be okay. I didn’t really know what to do anymore.’
'I thought I didn't have any appointments today!' billionaire Tony Stark whined. 'I wanted to work in my lab until tomorrow morning.'
They ended up in a cave where the water was really quiet. They hardly moved in their tubes when the guide told them to turn off their lights. As it became dark, hundreds of little green lights appeared on the ceiling. The glow worms were almost like stars, the longer you looked, the more lights you noticed. It was beautiful and Steve wished he could make a picture.
'I think I need bigger wings. With these I will fall,' Tony agreed. 'And I have to practice on the hills. I'll run down the hill and the wind will lift me up in the sky and I'll be flying! You'll see! Maybe I should put a rope on the wings, like a kite. Do you wanna help? You can hold the rope and we'll run together! I gotta make new wings first, so it will take a few days. Will you come back? To hold the rope?'
'Stef, you dirty, dirty boy,' Lauren laughed when Steve entered the dressing room.'You had a threesome! Did you like it?'
Steve was just as cheerful as the morning before and the others were just as grumpy. Steve made them breakfast and a shit load of coffee to get them all awake. Tony drank like half of it, giving the excuse that he was driving. Clint offered to drive, but Tony absolutely refused to be driven around by anyone. He would drive. The others agreed to it, he seemed awake enough.
'Sounds really cool,' the boy grinned. 'But my mom said you can only fly with magic. You would have fallen if you had jumped from the wall.'
Steve nodded as he sat down on the bed. ‘Yeah, that’s Natasha. She is here to protect me. Or to keep me company, I guess, I can handle myself pretty well. It’s been ages since I’ve seen someone else. How long has it been since the second world war?’
‘I’m not that bad, you know,’ Tony said. ‘I was going to ask our dearest Captain to move in with me anyway, and I have a few more floors left. I didn’t want any losers in my house. These people have proven that they aren’t losers, they are the Avengers.
When Steve and Tony started living together they had asked Jarvis to join them for dinner. They didn't like it that he had to sit alone in another room. They asked him every evening and after weeks he finally joined them. At first he didn't say much, he listened to their stories, but when they all got used to it he started telling stories as well. They got to know him better than ever before.
They ran and ran and ran as fast as they could. Steve held the rope tightly and Tony flapped his arms. He jumped, flapped his arms harder, and fell on his face on the ground. Steve quickly came running back to see if his friend was alright, but Tony didn’t let the bruises stop him. The entire afternoon they ran up and down the hill. Tony didn't fly at all, but they had a lot of fun. They even changed places, to try if they could make Steve fly, but that didn't work either.
It also inspired people to help others and more super heroes stood up. It was like a plague, like a (better) version of Kick Ass 2. Every idiot could make himself a spandex suit and walk the streets like they owned it. It wasn’t all bad, of course, and some of those self-proclaimed heroes actually did have talent. They all helped out when there was something small going on, and Tony only stepped into his suit when the world was really in danger. He was glad he didn’t have to deal with petty thieves anymore, but it was a bit annoying when they got in his way while he tried to rescue people.
‘I think I can,’ Rhodey answered with a smirk. ‘Go on that blind date for me and pretend to be me. If it’s a cute girl I’ll go myself next time and tell her you stepped in for me, because I was ill.’
James snorted. ‘Muscles? Me? What was the last time you looked in the mirror? Your arms are like twice the size of mine. If anyone could eat pastries forever and not get fat it’s you.’
For a moment he was tempted to order a drink to calm himself down a little, but he never drank much alcohol and he wasn’t sure how well he would handle it with an empty stomach. He didn’t want to end up embarrassing himself, and Bucky as well in the process. Why did he agree to do this? Steve almost convinced himself that he should just go home and tell Bucky his date didn’t show up, when a very handsome man walked in with a white flower in his jacket.
‘Exactly,’ Bucky answered. ‘Your ass is one of your best features, so try to show that off. Put on the black jeans!’
'Same as you,' Steve said. 'I've been here for more than two weeks and I got one of the guys to trust me, so let me do this in peace, please? It's difficult enough.'
'Nah man, you're better at the leading thing,' Sam laughed. 'But tell Fury, maybe I can get him to upgrade my salary.'
'Okay, I'll do that. The more evidence, the better,' Tony agreed. 'What about you? Are you being monitored too? Camera contact lenses?'
“Something like that,” Steve groans, and Tony separates just enough to twist a nipple as hard as he can, and he veers viciously close to delirious with the ego boost at Steve’s ensuing growl.
“Right. This was supposed to be about you,” Steve reminds, belatedly recognizing his use of the past tense, admitting that they’ve long since traversed into murky waters
“You did, didn’t you?” Tony asks through a delighted chuckle, now rubbing the pads of his thumbs over Steve’s cheeks, and Steve is definitely not going to mention Sam’s advice. “You’re lucky, you know. Not every guy can grow it out so late in life and
For the time being, though, Tony pulls back to see Steve’s red-wrecked mouth and tugs at his shirt without any of his usual finesse. It takes some effort to pull up the hem from where it’s caught between Tony’s legs but he manages, pushing it up, higher, right under Steve’s armpits but high enough that he can swipe out a thumb to brush over a nipple.
“Did I miss something?” she asks, sitting on the step behind them. Steve reluctantly allows for distance between himself and Tony, just enough for her to wiggle in and rest her chin on Steve’s shoulder. Tony pops a kiss to her cheek, and Steve can practically feel her responding smile.
He doesn’t, though. He just sits next to Steve and listens to the crooning from the hidden speakers - which means Sam has won for the time being, he thinks with a
“If someone wants you to stop being Iron Man, then fuck ‘em,” Steve says with so much conviction that it startles a laugh out of Tony.
“You do that,” Tony says, and he looks focused on his new task but Steve can tell he isn’t from the way his hand falters, a dead giveaway for where his attention truly lies.
“The catering here isn’t half bad, you know,” Tony opens with, signaling to the bartender for his usual.
“Time passes differently here,” she says when he casually asks how long it has been since they discovered his presence. “We’ve been trying to keep track, but there’s no real point, which just makes it harder.”
“I guess you’ve got a point,” he says, and the way he smooths his hands down the front of his bespoke tuxedo feels like waving a white flag. “Considering what happened last time.”
“Wow,” Steve says, eyes fully blinking open. “I think that’s the easiest you’ve ever agreed to anything. How d’you feel about giving me a piggyback ride to my room?”
She’s right, of course she’s right, even when he doesn’t want her to be because he’s a man, goddamnit, and his entire foundation of being is built upon not verbalizing anything he actually means.
“You know,” Tony says, when Steve’s licking mustard from his fingers after his second hot dog, “that’s very well and all, but does not compare to the real thing.”
He’d been worried about leaving, had asked Denise and Josie so many times if they were sure it was okay. At the end they’d gotten sick of it, and Beth had nearly thrown Steve’s old duffel at him as he got dropped off at the airport.
“Hey!” Clint crosses his arms across his broad chest and pouts, exactly like a teenager not getting their way. “I’m just saying.” He gestures lewdly, and Steve quickly lifts his eyes to the paneled ceiling. “Stark is attractive, Steve is attractive,
But Tony is ignoring him, cackling in delight as he pushes out a service exit that opens out onto a small lot occupied by nondescript white service vans. The door is the kind that needs a key card to open from the outside, so Steve stands on the threshold and rests his hands on his hips to steady them. The last thing he needs is to get locked out.
The usual urge to dismiss it, to protest and claim that he’s fine, that he doesn’t need anything from anyone - he shoves it aside because he knows she’s right, because she’s almost always right, and it has been a rather overwhelming couple of weeks since Wakanda and Thanos.
The gutters need cleaning and Steve should probably shower and get ready to walk to the home improvement store so he can get supplies to patch the tear in the screen door, a result of Manny and Zeke’s continued football practice the previous afternoon. He stays in the middle of the kitchen though, long past when he’s caught his breath.
He takes a break from scanning the label to glance up at Steve for a split second, then does a double-take as Steve flushes deeply and sits back on his haunches.
“No?” Tony asks, searching Steve for what, he’s not sure, but he only knows that he’s not able to give whatever Tony needs.
“So we’re going with divine intervention,” he says as Steve keeps at the same tortuous speed. “I love you, and I know you’re insane, but you’re really chalking this up to some higher power?”
“I said no, because I didn’t need you to show off for me.” Steven’s mouth quivers despite his best efforts, a victim to the frigid atmosphere surrounding them, and it’s like speaking through nervous marbles. “I enjoyed spending time with you as you were. I didn’t need to watch some priceless suit of iron in action to appreciate your company.” Bravery tastes bold and round. He rocks back on his heels, caught on the precipice as Tony looks into him in that manner that no one else can manage.
He settles Peggy back home where she sleeps heavily and often, and he keeps the news on until the fateful day finally comes and Fury calls him, tells him that he’s got his best agent on it.
Precious few of them talk about why they’re there. He’s figured out that Beth and Elliot lost their parents to a murder-suicide after their two other siblings were dusted, and Jackson’s grandma passed a couple years back. His mom came back with everyone else, but she’d always been an addict and Josie makes sure he knows he’ll always have a home with them.
All of it - whoever else may exist in this heaven, how the three of them will adjust to the new dynamic, whoever else may come to join them in the future -
Steve cooks breakfast while Peggy checks in with SHIELD and wakes Tony. By the time he’s portioned out scrambled eggs and sausages and toast, Tony is dressed and rubbing at his eyes as he slumps into a chair that is far too large for him.
“Sam told me about you and Pepper,” Steve says, a foul taste in the back of his throat. “Says you live at the new compound. I’m not going to kick you out of yet another home you built for yourself and your family.”
“You were a wanted fugitive,” Tony bites out. “I kind of figured you were staying away so you didn’t end up arrested, or dead.”
“Yes, I’m still here. No, I’m not sneaking a picture. He looks just like he does on tv. This is what you get for going to live in stupid Dallas, you know.”
“Learn how to take a compliment, Steve,” Tony says, tapping his fingers on the arm of the chair, and the familiar action makes Steve think about a kitchen table and a glass of lemonade and secrets being spilled. “Alright. So you fresh out of the ice is a dick in every timeline, and water is wet. Continue.”
“But I like Cap,” Tony says, sounding unsure. “We’re not close, but he’s been a decent guy. And it’s not his fault. I mean, if you’re saying you waited to tell me, I wouldn’t have been - was I?”
They don’t talk about anything serious, and Steve thinks about what he’d give to share a bed with Tony again. He wonders if the universe hears him, because Tony asks what he’s doing the last week in March.
(“He might need it,” Steve had said, gaze focused on the platform before them. “What if he turns young again?”
“Steve,” Rogers says slowly, enunciating with a straight face. “It’s not that hard, c’mon. Say it with me.
The day has passed into the next and they are all exhausted. Peggy remembers the Stark penthouse and directs Steve through the artificially lit streets while sitting in the backseat, a protective hand curling over Tony’s head where he lies in her lap. She carries him to a bedroom, and Steve hovers until the boy stirs.
He doesn’t know anything about Arkansas. He’s never been here before. He pulls off a brightly lit highway to find fields and wind along rivers and ends up staring at the stars while being bitten by mosquitoes.
“Tony,” Steve says, shoving his hands in his pockets. “I’m not - I’m not looking to be Captain America again.”
So he navigates away from the name, locks his phone, and finishes the dregs of his coffee. He’ll take till Monday to sleep on it, and then - and then -
“And that’s how I convinced the murder twins to come home with me,” the disembodied voice says, and Steve fiddles with the knob on the complicated microwave. “Easy peasy, when you think about it. Turns out the promise of warm shelter and a credit card kind of overrides the urge to enact revenge, at least when it comes to the youth of today.”
“No,” Steve confesses as Tony sucks on the fine column of his neck, knowing he doesn’t need to be careful and all the more exhilarated for it. “I hoped, obviously.”
“I went back and stayed there. What else was I supposed to do? I got a second chance, and I took it.”
“You staying on the team wouldn’t necessarily involve us fighting,” Tony tries to tell him, but Steve isn’t having it.
“Big guy like you, I’m sure,” he teases, snatching back the cigarette. It’s only half-smoked, but that doesn’t stop Tony from pushing it through the neck of Steve’s partially drunk beer. “Come on,” he says, with one of his barracuda looks. “Let’s get you a real drink.”
There had been flickers, moments in time where Tony had dared to step closer. Steve had only seen them too late, after he’d inadvertently burned out a flame that had little to no chance of surviving anyway.
It’s not strictly true, but Tony’s still technically with Pepper, and as rocky as it’s been lately since SHIELD fell and Tony started spending more time with the Avengers, he doesn’t think she’d appreciate the thought of him in the same room as a naked Steve Rogers. The man is practically perfect in every single way, that’s just a known fact in the universe, but Tony doesn’t need to give the frustrated and nagging Pepper in his head any more excuses to lay into him. He’s gathered enough tally marks against him lately; fantasizing about Cap is the opposite of what he needs right now.
“Tony.” It’s firmer this time, not that Steve’s got any idea how since Tony is linking their fingers together and Steve’s powerless to physically put a stop to it. At least he’s not actively encouraging him, Steve thinks while snorting at himself. “You’re drunk, I know you are, and technically I’m on a business trip representing the magazine until I give this tux back.”
Steve looks at the little boy in front of him and very nearly sees a mirage of a man who is graying at his temples and smiling sideways. He shakes his head, forcing himself to see the boy with clever eyes and dexterous hands, holding his fork and cup with a finesse that children his age are not supposed to possess.
“Clint,” she says, and despite his desperate mood, he feels a flicker of gratefulness. “Because if it’s bad enough that you’re finally talking about it, I can’t do this on my own.”
There’s Rhonda at the diner in south Jersey. Steve is pretty sure she recognizes him, but only keeps his ice water fresh and gives him extra whipped cream on a large slice of cherry pie. When he leaves, he leaves a hefty tip and she meets his eyes from behind the counter where she’s serving an elderly man a plate of buckwheat pancakes. Her smile is small and she mouths a
Tony blinks wearily. “Not my assistant. I hope you didn’t call her that. She basically runs the team. I just sign the paychecks.”
“No,” Steve says emphatically, because just - no. Absolutely not. “I can’t tell you what to do, but I’m not going, and this really doesn’t seem like a puke-and-rally situation to me.”
Tony’s dressed exquisitely, tailored in black-and-white, but his tails are half-hanging out and his bowtie looks like it came undone at one point before being clumsily tied back together. There’s a visible wet splotch on his pants, too far down the thigh to be caused by anything truly indecent. He can’t seem to look at anything besides some ambiguous location beyond Steve, which while rude enough to sting, gives Steve a good opportunity to observe how slowly Tony blinks. If Steve didn’t know better, he’d think Tony was unwilling to come any further into the room, based on how tightly he’s gripping the doorjamb.
‘It’s not fair!’ a black guy with wings shouted. ‘We’re all doing good, we’re keeping the streets safe, just like you are, but we gotta stop and you can continue.’
Steve frowned as he looked at his clothes. He didn't see anything wrong with it. 'It's my uniform. I thought, since you guys are wearing yours I should wear mine. Is it not good?'
‘Your night sounds very relaxed if you had time to chat. No exploding turkeys to deal with? No one who wanted to stab their annoying mother in law? No one stuck in a chimney?’
'Great!' Tony cheered. He never had a friend before. 'I have no classes on Saturday. You should come then, we'll go to the hills and try! My name is Tony.'
As quick as he could Steve ran to the man to see if it was really Redwing he was trying to hit. When he noticed the black and white wings and the blue belly there was no mistake, it was Sam’s budgie. The man who was trying to kill the bird was big and bold, but he had a grey beard. Redwing didn’t seem to care that he couldn’t make a nice little nest in the man’s hair, his beard was good enough. Too bad the guy didn’t seem to like the little bird.
'I don't have a crush on the guy, you know, he is nice to work with,' Tony said as he eyed Bucky. 'The dresses and fake titties aren't really doing it for me.'
The sound of a gunshot shut them both up. People started screaming, some people were trying to run. Everyone was panicking. Glass was shattering in several places, chairs fell over, and the sounds of footsteps was everywhere. Steve wanted to look up, but Tony pushed his head down again.
‘Okay, what’s our plan?’ Clint asked, stepping through the door. When nothing happened Tony followed him. ‘This place is huge, that dragon could be anywhere. And how are we going to find our soldier boy?’
Steve didn't know what to think of it, but he hoped nobody had seen it. Of course he had no such luck. His friends had been watching.
'I guess I am!' Steve said. 'I've been training this morning, I fed the dogs, made breakfast, and packed my bag. I'm ready to go!'
And with that said he slapped Rhodey's ass, before moving on like nothing out of ordinary had happened. Rhodey eyed him in a way that told the billionaire that his friend thought he had gone crazy, but he didn't say anything. Tony peeked over his shoulder and cheered inside. Steve had seen it.
No one ever expected to get such great results in such a short time. Steve and Tony were a great team and worked really well together. Steve gained the trust of the guys, while Tony knew exactly how much he had to push to make the guys give the answers he wanted. They wanted to go for two more stories before asking the guys to make an official statement.
'Maybe I'll come and visit you for a night of fun,' Natasha said seductively. She laughed when she heard Bucky's whine.
Steve and Clint left. The moment the door closed Clint did a little victory dance. There was indeed an agent waiting who brought them to their rooms, on the top floors of the building. Steve gave a quick goodbye before he disappeared behind the door. Clint stepped into his own room. It was white and looked sterile, but it was worth it if it meant he got to be an official super hero! He hopped around in his room a little, checking all the cupboards, the bathroom and even under the bed. There was nothing, it was really boring. He watched TV for a while, but there was nothing interesting, so he decided to take Steve into the city for some dinner.
