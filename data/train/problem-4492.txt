Dean hummed a pleased noise, kissed him on the cheek, then slowly disentangled himself and went to sit at the table across from me.
“Being alive is weird,” I decided, studying the back of my hand.  “You gotta piss and shit and sleep…”
I closed my eyes.  “You should have left me in hell.”
I sighed loudly.
This chapter addresses some sensitive topics.
We all knew that wasn’t true, but I didn’t say anything more, and the next time Cass appeared in my car, he was proudly waving a cassette at me that read in very tiny lettering, ‘
He looked down at me.
“Okay,” I said, closing my eyes.  “My own freakin’ guardian angel.”
“Awesome,” I said, turning the engine over.  “Can you put in
“You’re an angel named
We were both quiet, the sound of Cliff Burton’s
“Oh, we tried to put you two to bed,” Junior said with a laugh.
I leaned back against my headrest, chuckling.  “Eileen is so cool, how did she ever end up with my dorky brother?”
“Jack, your family is here, waiting to see you again,” Cass murmured, his tone more reverent than the rest of ours.
“Cass,” I complained.
“Yes, yes, that was the name,” he said.  “It really told a story, didn’t it?”
“He came once.”
“Castiel!”
“Anciently awesome,” I muttered.
For some reason, that put a lump in my throat.
“That’s bullshit.”
Cass’s face broke into an echoing smile.  “I love you, too.”
“Do you need me to draw you a friggin’ road map?”
I grinned at him.
I groaned.  This was going to be a long ride.
“Yeah, just…” Sam trailed off.
“Weirdo,” I said, getting out of the car.  I wasn’t smiling because of Cass.
“Do you remember when I went to the bathroom last night?”
“Shut up, smartass.”
Dad wasn’t stupid.  Just because Dean hadn’t told him didn’t mean that he didn’t know.  But it still sent a message, and Dad was receiving it loud and clear.
“Wait, wait, wait.”
I pulled the tape out and pushed it into the deck.
It was a futile effort, and Sam gleefully smeared my face with whipped cream.
We held hands as we made our way out of the living room, Cass’s mixtape still playing softly in the background.  This was all corny as hell, but I found I didn’t care.  Maybe I liked corny.
I flashed him a grin, then sprayed the whipped cream into Sam’s open palm.
“Well I am dead, Cass.”
“Dean says my previous attempt was edible,” he said as a way of encouragement.
“You need some new lines, Cass.”
“So this has been great, but I’m gonna go now,” I said, standing up from the table abruptly and moving towards the door.
“It just takes time,” Sam was saying.
“Might as well have.”
Eileen took the seat next to Cass, signing something to him.
“…what’s that supposed to mean?”
She always let me in.
“Oh, I know,” he said, smiling fondly at me.
“That one’s not finished,” he said quickly.
I thought about it.  “I dunno, I mean, we just started this whole carpool karaoke thing in heaven, so most of the songs I associate with you are from that.”
“Yes.  Of only female artists.”
“You are my purpose in life, the reason why I walk this earth,” he said.  “What am I to you?  We are not family by blood.  We have no actual ties.”
“Why does he need a sa-” Cass started to say, and suddenly went quiet.
“What’s so funny?” Cass asked, looming behind me.
Cass’s head immediately cocked to the side.  “Your… person?”
I made a face at her.
“Shut up, Cass,” I grumbled.  “I said what I said.  You’re my damn person, so deal with it.”
“Dean.”
“Can you help the kids out?” I asked, magnanimously gesturing towards Junior and Claire.
I tilted my head to the side, trying to convey with my eyes that he should stop talking and just go with it.
, Cass,” I informed him.  “
“I’m a great flirt,” I informed him.
“He has always been this short,” Sam said helpfully.
“I’m sorry, Dean, but humanity decided to go another wa-” he started to say, but I couldn’t take it anymore and hugged him like I should have hugged him when we were both alive.  His arms clung around me, and it was like some kind of circle had been completed.
“Yeah, tomorrow,” I agreed.
“Where the hell have you been?” I finally mumbled, looking away.  The last time I’d seen him was in the storage room of the bunker after he pushed me away and disappeared into the Empty.
I didn’t answer again.
“You don’t find this the least bit scary?”
out of its body and I was back in heaven, sitting on Bobby’s porch again.
“Of course,” I said.  “You don’t need an invitation.”
“I’ve seen this movie fifty bajillion times.”
“Yes, ma’am,” I said, shooting her a salute.
Junior blinked slowly.  “You know we’re both older than you, right?”
“I just don’t understand,” Cass said, hitting the lever on the back of his hippo aimlessly.  “There’s no technique.”
We were all smiling, eating pie, and then my soul just seemed to
“Well, you are an angel, so it’s kind of your job to answer prayers and all that,” I muttered, wishing he would just drop the subject.
“I don’t really see the difference, but okay, what do you want to listen to?” I asked.
“Oh, well, then you should stay,” I said, giving him a slow and easy grin.
“We’re together,” he ground out.
“Would you like to try some?”
“No, you told me not to watch you when you were asleep,” he said.  “You were very specific.  You said it was creepy to stare at someone when they were unconscious.”
“I’m pretty sure everyone thought it was hilarious, Dean,” Sam put in, gesturing between Cass and Junior, who did in fact look like they thought it was hilarious.
?” he read.  “
It didn’t mean anything.
“It is very obvious when you’ve had sex, Dean,” he said, like he was talking about the weather.  “Elevation in mood, increased winking and eyebrow waggling, excessive cockiness…”
“I definitely did not.”
“Is that why you left it in my car?” I teased him.
“I don’t think I can,” I whispered.
“That’s what I said.  Mixed tape.”
His brows scrunched together.
“Sometimes,” I agreed.
“Ha.”
“Do it,” I coaxed him.
“Okay,” he said, giving me that little smile that was becoming more and more frequent, and resting his head back on my shoulder.
“Dean, they don’t understand your references, either,” Cass commented, pleased.
Sam didn’t have the same violent sleep reflexes that I did.  It was comforting to know that he didn’t live like that.
I hit ‘eject’, and neither of us said anything about it.  “What do you want to listen to?” I asked.
“Yes, very,” he said.  “I was able to become a father and raise my son with his other two fathers.”
I sat up a little straighter, and pressed a kiss to his cheek.
I ignored it and moved towards the north of the hospital.
“That’s not…” I trailed off.  “I needed you,” I repeated, frustrated.  “But you were
“Tomorrow?” he suggested.  “The day after?  Whenever you want, Dean.”
“I could never,” I said shaking my head.  “I couldn’t put that on any of you, I just couldn’t.”  The tears started to come harder and faster, no matter how hard I tried to swallow them down.
“What?” I asked
“Yeah, in a few minutes,” he said, seeming to put even more of his weight against me.
“Tentacle porn?” Junior asked, raising an eyebrow.
“I’m right here.”
“Er…” he trailed off, patting Mellie’s back awkwardly.
“You bring me a real burger, kid, you hear me?” I called after him.
“That’s really great,” I said instead.
Sam and Junior were in fact waiting at the car, lying side-by-side on the hood and looking up at the stars.  The glowing orb was settled between them, randomly pulsing light.
“Yes.”
“No!” I cried, but then I couldn’t help but laugh.
“Could you…?” he started to say, then hesitated.
“And you are?”
“…talking about what…?” I finally spoke.
“Cass…”
“You’re annoying,” I said, smacking him back.
I turned to look at him.  “What are you doing?”
“It’s important to me.”
“Dean, you’ve made me watch them a million times.”
I started to feel like I was drunk, looking at all the pretty colors swirling over our heads.  The ceiling seemed to be getting closer and closer, and when I tilted my head to the side, I realized we were now floating off the bed.  I felt completely serene.
“You say that a lot,” I said, “but you know that we could just turn down the volume?”
“What am I mad about?” I asked, rolling my eyes.
“…what?”
“All right then, I’ll just… sit here…”
Now my head was shooting back to my dad.
“Yes, so let’s drink some water and chill, yeah?”
“That sounds ominous,” I said with a snort.
“No,” he said, adding the tape to my collection.  “You should listen to it alone.”
Sam nodded at me, a goofy smile on his face.  “High,” he agreed.
“We’re probably just gonna be doing car stuff all day,” Dean said, taking a drink.  “Might be boring for you.”
“Oh, right, sorry, should I be saying ‘make love’?” she asked, elbowing me.
“It was only temporary.”
I cracked up.
“I usually come here,” he said.  “I keep my things in various places, but I do not have many private possessions.  I wear my clothing, I carry my angel blade, and my walkman is in my pocket,” he listed off.  “My books and cassettes are in a storage closet in the bunker with my extra clothing, and I have a few storage lockers around the world with various artifacts.”
You can listen to the referenced songs on
He was still shaking his head.  “I value our friendship.”
It went right through me, vibrating down my spine.  “Enough,” I grumbled, letting go of his hand and shifting my shoulders away from him.
“Yeah, man. Shoot.”
“I...all right.”
“Nice to meet you.”
—gotta get Cas back.
“A...are you...” Cas stammers. He looks up quickly to see a panicked Sam heading their way, Rudy following close behind, then turns back to Dean. “I almost had a heart attack, Dean!”
"I very well can, Dean, there is no need for me to ever have sex. I cannot have children and I cannot fall in love and stay with any humans." Castiel points out, his facts being ignored by the man as he calls a beautiful woman with long blonde hair over to them.
Castiel stares at Dean, "It is alright, Dean."
"SAM!" A tall brunette whom Castiel recognized to be the twenty-one year old Dean, screams. He pulls out a pocket knife and charges at the angel, ramming the knife into his chest.
"You think so?" Kevin smiles at him as he pours sauce into the skillet, "Because I think this is the most at peace Dean has been since his parents died. Granted, he's not running around laughing and joking as much as usual, but he's always been relatively gruff and rude. This is the first time he has trusted Sammy to anyone other than me or Jo…or Charlie that one time."
"See?"
"Sam? Cas? Where are you, I got pizza for dinner!" Dean calls and Gabriel laughs a little.
"I understand."
"What are you-?"
Once settled amongst the blankets, Castiel looks up at him through half-lidded eyes and he can see the satisfied smirk on Dean's face. "That's not playing fair." He mumbles and Dean frowns a little.
"Hey, Cas, since you are like a big brother does that mean Gabriel is too?" Sam asks and Castiel frowns.
After a few more hours of car work and food, they are finally done for the day. Heading out to the impala, Dean pauses at the door and looks to Castiel.
"Halo?"
Castiel simply raises a brow as the two begin to wrestle again. It's not that he wants to leave Sam, but he needs time alone with Dean if he ever hopes to do his job in the man's lifespan. He is happy the two of them are getting along so well, but they have things to do and Benny was quoted a specific time. Perhaps it is just because he is an angel, but Castiel takes meeting times seriously. In order to do this, he knows what must be done.
"Do…you need to see him?"
Dean rolls his eyes and motions for Castiel to cover Sam's ears, which he does. "Drinking and strip clubs, Castiel. I'm getting drunk and you're seeing boobs."
"I'll stay with Kevin." Sam says in lieu of an explanation.
"I'm a mechanic. We will be spending the day at a garage."
"Alright, idjits, get back to work. Dean, get yourself a good jack, and Castiel stay next to him in case something else happens." Bobby groans before heading back to his own spot.
"Only pretty good, huh?"
"It got to the point where Benny was worried about the two of us and offered to take us in while I got back on my feet. I refused to leave this house, so he offered to take Sam…" Dean mumbles, "That's why Sammy hates him. He took him home to spend the night one night when Kevin couldn't come over, which Sammy was fine with because he liked him, but when I came to get him the next day he threw that shit at me and Sammy started crying because he didn't want to leave me." He looks over to Castiel, "That's the night you showed up."
Castiel stares at the milk in his hand curiously. Dean asked him to pick up milk from the store a few minutes from their house, since he is busy getting Sam to take a nap. He was actually excited to go off and do something on his own, but now he is regretting it. Who knew there were so many different kinds of milk? 1%, 2%, whole milk. How is he supposed to know how much milk Dean wants in his milk? He never paid attention to it in the fridge, and now he could kick himself for it.
That's probably a chapter in the bible somewhere, actually.
It's not his place, of course, but damn he would love to be able to get Castiel to just fucking listen. The house is tense, something is up with Castiel and Gabriel wants to help him, as any older brother does.
Castiel remains quiet as Dean sits on the ground, resting against the wall he slammed him into moment ago.
"Find socks." Sam gestures to Dean's bare feet.
"Angel wings need to be soft, for god gave us human flesh which makes us sensitive to normal feathers." Castiel explains as the small child buries his face in the feathers, making the angel flush. Wings are a sensitive thing that only get touched in the most intimate times, a child playing with them is strange when they are not your own.
"Well that is a relief…" Dean sighs, "I'm sorry about this, though, you were very adamant about not doing that yesterday."
Castiel stares at the child curiously, "…You…may." He answers before the boy rushes over in a blur and begins running his tiny fingers through the coal black wings spread out in his room.
"Angels do not get drunk." Castiel points out, eying Jo as she brings Dean another beer. "You are the one who will be getting drunk."
"Try what I did with you!" She offers and Castiel looks at her confused.
"Oh, yes, goodnight to you as well." Castiel responds, "Is Benny bothering you at all?"
The food comes shortly after this and the three eat, Kevin showing Castiel how to 'properly eat a pizza', an act which apparently does not entail eating different pieces first. Castiel uses this for one slice, but quickly returns to eating it in the order he prefers; peperoni, cheese, sauce, bread. He ignores the looks Kevin gives him. By the time they are done eating, Sam is covered in sauce and cheese.
"You know what? Fine, we will go out without Sam. He can go to Bobby's." He says as the look on his face turns almost calculating, "But if we do, Sam is not coming home tonight."
"Excellent, let's do this." Dean wraps an arm around Castiel's shoulders, pulling him inside to keep him from escaping. "Resisting won't keep me from bringing you in here."
"Ah, yes, young adults. Almost as bad as teens. They lose their cockiness and begin to panic about everything." Gabriel sighs, "Don't you find it odd? How your generation is so full of anxiety and panic attacks? No doubt Castiel would be prone to those as well, were he raised a human and given all the stressors you have."
"All humans are heavenly. They bring life and breed love." Castiel says, patting the child on the head again. Gabriel would do that when he was young, and it would always make him happy. Hopefully that is a child thing and not something specific to himself.
Sam smiles up at Dean, "I called him, Dean."
Castiel wakes up in pain. He knows he has to go, probably tonight, but he's not sure how to say goodbye to everyone. Especially Dean. Of course Castiel loves Dean, and he's fairly certain he's in love with Dean. Unlike Dean, though, he's not telling anyone about it. If he dwells on it too long, who knows what stupid things he might do.
"He asked." Castiel explains, "You should always answer when asked a question. That is just good manners."
"Don't ever speak badly of yourself like that again, Cas, or I'll have to kick your ass." Dean huffs, "I couldn't have gotten this far without you, I couldn't have gotten anywhere without you." He admits before turning his gaze to his feet, "Which is why I wish you could stay."
"Good boys keep their promises, Sammy!" Dean groans before Sam kicks him in the stomach.
"Are vampires real?" Sam asks and Castiel shrugs.
"You won't tell me how you feel about me," Dean begins unbuttoning Castiel's shirt, "Yet you are okay with having sex. I'm fairly certain that makes you stranger."
"Yes, well, most people do not have angel taxis so we're walking." Dean huffs. Why was he going to miss this guy again?
"You understand men, correct?" Castiel asks as she begins to spread his legs so she can dance between them.
Like losing his parents wasn't enough.
"I'll be back later, help Castiel out when he needs it." He says before leaning forward and awkwardly hugging the boy in Castiel's arms. "W-well…on that note…don't burn down my house, make sure he stays in one piece, and the take-out menus are on the fridge."
In which Dean learns angels should not go to strip clubs. At least not his angel.
He sits there, watching her movements with concern. She is so young and yet so sad. There are women in this business that simply do it because it is easy money, but this woman is not one of them and he can tell. Perhaps he can help her. Or, more likely, perhaps she can help him.
"Your wings are nice," Sam mumbles, nuzzling into them with a wistful smile, "They are warm and smell really good."
"I told you he liked brunettes!" Sam exclaims, excitement all over his face. "You two should kiss! And get married! We watched a movie last night where two men got married! You should get married so Castiel can stay forever!" He rambles on, practically bouncing in his seat, and Castiel feels guilty. It's a nice thought, to be with them forever, but it's simply not plausible.
Wide green eyes stare him down for a moment before she starts to laugh, "Oh! Now I get it! You aren't aroused by this because you are interested in men!"
"Don't curse." They scold in unison and Sam laughs a little.
"I do." Castiel says without missing a beat and Dean pales.
"You seem pretty into touching someone who isn't cute." Castiel observes as he writhes under Dean. The two of them continue touching and kissing, Dean making sure to leave as many marks as possible on Castiel and vice versa, until finally the experienced man pulls out a little bottle from his drawer.
Sam shakes his head, "No! Bad Dean!" He scolds, confusing them both. "I can't come!"
"This is very well made." Castiel admits, looking around the large fort, "You would have been a worthy ally in a battle."
Dean raises a brow and looks between Sam and a highly confused Castiel, "I don't like this…but if we keep this guy I am not letting him out of my sight, so make room for me in that fort, too." He says decidedly, making Sam cheer.
"Oh, any time." Benny smiles, "The kid might not like it, but I'm always here if you need a break."
Dean looks torn between yanking Sam's hand away from Castiel's wings and never approaching them again before he settles on simply crossing his arms, "What the hell was that?"
"Of course not, I'm no barbarian." The angel huffs, placing his weapon back inside his trench coat. "I cannot accept you around Sam and Dean. I do not want them associating with a vampire, no matter how diluted of one you are."
"Yes, he is a good man." She agrees and Castiel nods. "Shame, though, I always wanted a try at him."
Castiel frowns at Sam and picks him up, swallowing his pain. "I am sorry, Sam, but I must return to heaven now. We'll see each other again, though. You, me, and your brother will be reunited when you all pass away of old age." He promises, and means it. Even if he is the first angel to go to the human's heaven, he will when they come. "Only when you die of old age, though."
"…You can't put him in that." Kevin says from behind him, "Only using cold will make him freeze."
"They are my stars!"
"Some of the things you say are so absurd, it makes me glad I only know one angel."
"So you don't think he could make it as a human?" Dean asks, "Not that I would want him to be."
"Yep, well you're going there." Dean says, clicking a button and bringing the phone to his ear. "I have to have out with your weirdo, you can hang out with mine."
"Kevin!" Sam giggles, jumping off the couch and running over to drag him inside. "This is Kevin, Castiel!"
"Those three were your friends, right?" Sam asks, eyes wide with awe as he listens to the angel.
Dean remains speechless, continuing to stare at Castiel. The look on the man's face doesn't seem like Castiel's though, it's curious and uncertain. Sure, Castiel was like that in the past, but he wouldn't be now.
"A-amazing," Castiel admits, breathless as Dean continues thrusting into him and raking his fingers through the black feathers. He then lets out a loud moan when Dean's fingers reach past the feathers and to his wings' skin. Castiel gasps, thrusting his hips up faster and writhing underneath Dean.
The boy laughs a little, "Dean's orders? Well, don't worry about it, he told me to check on you two." He peaks his head past the door and waves to Sam. "Hey Sammy!"
"Anyways, Cas, if you can hear this…thanks. You didn't exactly go about it in a way most people, and probably angels, would have…but you helped me and Sammy out so much. I have redeemed myself in his eyes, and my own, and I have been able to stop dwelling on our parents' death." He sighs heavily, "Of course I haven't been able to stop dwelling on you yet, but I'm sure it'll happen. Someday. No, actually, since god can probably hear this and tell you if I'm lying or not, fuck it. I'm sorry Cas, but I won't be able to move on. I fell in love with you so fully, I can't imagine being with someone else, ever.
"Who is this cutie?" A blonde girl asks, coming out from the back and eying Castiel curiously.
He really doesn't regret any of it, though, even if his heart has to break all over again.
Dean glares at him, "I know damn well you were a 'warrior angel'! Now you are a damned guardian angel or whatever so move on already!"
The angel frowns, "Sam told her I was his new big brother, who is here to make you happy." He explains, making Gabriel go into another fit of laughter. "She then said something about thinking you were straight, and me being a 'catch', and that she would not tell anyone." His expression turns grave as he looks at Dean, "I think she must have found out I was an angel."
"Sam, that is not true." Castiel says, looking to Sam, "Your brother's face is not mean, it is quite nice by the current standards of beauty." He explains, making Sam snort as Dean chokes on his food.
"Wait, wait, you met a chick who stripped and you actually put clothes on her?" Dean asks, shaking his head, "I thought I knew you."
"Shut up, you're not cute when you're being a brat." Dean scolds, bringing a hand to Castiel's thigh.
A strange smile comes to Dean's face, as if he is trying to force it down, when he wraps an arm around Castiel's shoulders. "Well, most men simply give a woman a monetary tip when they enjoy a lap dance."
Castiel watches Rufus go to one of the cars before turning to Dean, "What does he mean 'switching things up'?"
Castiel shakes his head in disbelief, "Why would you go through so much for one human?"
Dean seems to have been staring at him this entire time as well, because when Castiel turns to him the young man quickly looks over to Sam with a red tint to his cheeks. "You heard your stupid angel, get your damn clothes on."
"Yeah!"
Castiel sits up and stares at the man, sensing a small part of his sorrow fading. "Yes, it will work." He assures him before a loud knock comes from the other side of the door.
“No,” he says, shaking his head. “You don’t have to be nice, Cas. There’s no universe where what I did
“Fucking piece of--” He squints through the darkness at the Colt, and Cas’ stomach drops when he hears a faint grunt of recognition in the mugger’s voice. “Oh,
“You’re judging me, aren’t you?”
"Bacon cheeseburger and a Coke for me, please," Dean says, tucking the menu back behind the napkin dispenser.
Luckily, Sam answers, so Castiel gets to avoid that potential injury. He and Anna exchange pleasantries, and Sam informs him that Dean will be ready in a minute.
Cas looks up at his boyfriend’s question, and almost bursts out laughing at his stunned face, one hand now tangled in his hair while the other grabs for his beer. “She just—did you—did ya’ll hear that? Did you hear what she
Cas tries for a smile, for
He didn’t want to make—just the
It’s probably just the alcohol, but Dean swears he can see something akin to disappointment in Cas’ eyes as the moment fades away. He covers it up right quick, though, and taps a finger against the top of Dean’s hand. “If I didn’t know any better,” he says, “I’d say we have fans.”
The dark orange turns to white too quickly, and Castiel follows the sea of people flowing from one side of the street to the other. Before he knows it, he’s passed the gas station, a dilapidated sandwich shop, and a pizza joint that’s been written up one too many times for health code violations and is back in front of his building. Castiel stops, his chest heaving and T-shirt dotted with sweat under his arms and around his neck. He laces his fingers together behind his head and takes a deep breath before heading through the door, his thoughts about running being replaced once again with what kind of favor Anna wants from him.
“Now, where would the fun be in that?”
Looking around the scrapyard Bobby’s set up in the back of his house, Dean’s eyes land on an unopened bottle of whiskey. Desperate for something else to do with his hands, he grabs it, unscrews the top, and takes a long swig before passing it around to the rest of them. Once they’ve all had their fill, he takes a step toward the barrel and raises the bottle before pouring the few remaining drops over the clothes.
Benny pats Dean on the shoulder while glancing over to Sam. “Ain’t your fault he’s too much of a chickenshit to do it.”
Dean tilts his head slightly to one side in a habit that Cas realizes he really fucking likes. “Uh, have you
Sam's cheeks redden a little, and when he laughs this time, it looks like some of the tension in his face is actually draining away. "Yeah," he says, running his fingers through his lion's mane hair. "He just doesn't like to talk about it; I think he's embarrassed. Pretty sure I'm the only one who knows."
As if to prove this, he leans forward and presses a kiss just to the left of Cas’ nose, and Cas smirks, assuming that Dean meant for it to land right on the tip of his nose instead. Dean’s muttered “Goddamn it” confirms this, and Cas’ smile grows wider.
Cas has almost convinced himself of this fact when his blue eyes lock with a pair of green ones from down the hall.
, Dean?” Sam says, exasperated. “Christ, you’re worse than a toddler.”
days, and is captioned with a simple, “Miss you.”
Dean shuts up and listens. Sure enough, there’s the sound of a car motor not too far off, and gaining ground fast, by the sound of it.
Dean’s face stays completely serious for an agonizingly long few seconds before he smirks. “Nah, we don’t. They
“Mmhmm.”
at him right now, and even if he did want something, he’d be the first to let Cas know. He’s…outspoken that way. Scattered branches snap under their feet, and Cas can’t see where they’re going very well because all the lights have been turned off for the shower, and he accidentally starts walking sideways a little and then—
“Come on,” he finally says, gesturing toward the fire with a nod of his head and getting to his feet. “Before it gets too cold. You
“You two are close, huh?”
“Missed you more.” She smiles and tucks her hair behind her ears. “And I’m not the only one.”
“Fucking soccer,” he mutters, his voice sharper than usual, and Cas glances up at the flyer. It’s for a fundraiser event being held in the Max Cafe by women’s soccer next week.
Alastair’s face is red, and he looks like he wants to snap Dean’s neck, but instead, he shakes his head and grins to himself as he takes another sip of his drink, amused by Dean’s naivete. Dean notices, and shifts position so that he’s not so relaxed.
They’re a few blocks away from Cas’ apartment when Cas sees a man heading toward them, looking frazzled and a little bit lost. He looks up and waves to get their attention, quickening his pace to get to them.
Sam rolls his eyes. “Dude, he was looking at you way more than us. Hell, he seemed more concerned with whether or not
“Cas?” Dean asks softly.
He’s already been shoved out of his comfort zone with this whole thing, so what the hell--he’ll just push himself out a little bit more.
Hannah stares at him, not breaking eye contact as she swallows. “You know that’s not an option. Having him on is going to be huge, and you know it.”
that Cas has chosen to haul along.
Dean watches out of his periphery as Cas drops his sunglasses down over his eyes before fanning his own book out, running his thumb along the pages with a drumming
, and if anything would’ve blown their cover, it’d’ve been some semblance of basic goddamn
Dean grunts when his knees hit the dirt, and he’s about to haul himself back up to his feet when Cas’ boot connects with the bottom of his chin, sending him sprawling onto his back. He can hear Sam yelling at the both of them in the background, but he sure as hell ain’t listening, and he doubts Cas is, either.
Cas grabs a cup from her and glances down at his feet; the ground is littered with disposed paper cups, an inadvertent obstacle course for him and Dean. "Paper cups on the ground," he rasps, "but you can step on them. They shouldn't be an issue."
Dean turns his whole body to face him at that. “Alternatives?” he repeats. “What the hell do you mean, alternatives?”
He knows it’s a lost cause—Hannah’s been badgering him to take a vacation (“Or even a
,” he mutters when Sam tells them to drop again after another hundred yards, only to get them back on their feet not thirty seconds later. He feels like he’s trudging through mud, and his ankles are raw underneath the chains: as much as he thought he was used to them, what he apparently hasn’t gotten the hang of yet is running in them.
“What? Oh, Dean, I’m sorry.” She envelops him in a hug, burrowing her face against his shoulder. “I’m so sorry. [Bleep] him.”
Cas gapes for a few seconds, but recovers quickly. “I’m guessing your side of the fridge doesn’t have green things in it?”
This time, Dean’s grip tightens to stop himself from throwing himself off the back of the truck and taking them all on right then and there to get Cas out. Sam must’ve known he’d be liable to do the same thing, because he feels the weight of his hand on his shoulder.
“Thanks, Cas,” he says, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “Sometime.”
“I have no space or patience for a writer--especially one of your...subpar caliber--” Cas winces at that, “who refuses to write an article assigned to them. It shows a tremendous lack of respect and unprofessionalism.”
for this, wants to tackle Dean—or let Dean do the same to him—without another word, but he decides to play his cards carefully instead. He crooks a finger through one of the cuffs, letting them dangle from his hand, and turns around just as Dean says, “Is it really that hard to find a sh...it.”
you.” He flashes Castiel a brilliant smile and reaches behind him for the doorknob. “Just shove Rudy away if he tries to jump on you. He’s still working on his manners.”
“The cake,” Dean replies, as if it's the most obvious thing in the world. “It's been almost a week, how long does it take to bake a damn cake, huh?”
Anna huffs and hops up onto her desk, letting her legs dangle in front of it. “Fine,” she says. “Just busy.” Her face softens almost immediately though, and as the sunlight streams in from the window behind her, Castiel thinks her orange hair makes her look almost angelic.
“For the podcast episodes that aired months ago.”
“Cas,” Dean says, “you better not have lost my goddamn glasses.”
“Fine, fine. Continue,” she says, waving him on. “Fill me in.”
“I know,” Dean interrupts. “But who the hell am I to tell someone I’m not allowed to be able to make them feel better? If she took comfort in something I did or said, who am I to tell her she’s wrong?”
Sam clears his throat, and Dean looks up. His brother’s got his hand loosely around one of Cas’ arms; Dean takes the hint and curls his fingers around Cas’ bicep. They start back toward the exit, and Dean lets his thumb brush against Cas’ arm in a gesture he hopes comes off as reassuring.
Cas stares at him. “Seriously?” he asks. “Out of everything that happened in that episode,

what you look like.”
“Not as catchy as ‘bee-scotti,’” Dean finally says, smiling faintly. Castiel looks up at him and gives him a cautious smile.
Cas smiles. “Told you,” he says as he grabs an oven mitt and places the tray on top of the stove. The fries crackle and pop as they start to cool down, and Cas’ heart absolutely does

“Nobody knows,” Balthazar mumbles through a yawn. “I would've been fine sleeping through the whole damn thing, but this wanker decided to poke in and throw his boot at me,” he adds, jerking his head toward Raphael, who grins smugly.
“No,” Dean finally admits for the three of them.
“Fine,” Cas finally snaps. “Do you want to know why?”
“Let’s just hope they win for you.”
“Swear to Christ, Sam, if you don’t shut your trap and let me eat, I’ll—”
“Stop what?”

Cas nods and scoots over, making room for his mother on the bed. She picks up the folder and starts flipping through the papers and packets herself. “Why do I have to go to a place that sounds like an elegant boarding school in the Berkshires?” he asks, and his mother stiffens at that.
“Your new favorite comic,” he tells the girl, who looks at him hesitantly. “This has it all,” he says, rapping on the cover with his knuckles. “There’s mysteries and friendship and funny stuff and adventures…” He trails off when he notices that the girl doesn’t seem very impressed, then remembers another part of the story. “And three-eyed foxes,” he adds, and damn if
“Seriously, though,” Cas says, craning his neck up to get closer to Dean’s lips. Dean gets the point and meets him halfway, and warmth runs through Cas as he feels Dean’s lips curl up into a smile against his. Dean drags his teeth gently over Cas's bottom lip before leaning back again to let Cas finish his sentence. “Thank you.”

Cas wrinkles his nose. “No, Balthazar. And even if he did, I wouldn’t tell you in the middle of the museum.”
“Only one Novak at this table,” he says proudly, easing back down into his seat. “You’re lookin’ at a bona fide Milton right here. But let’s not change the subject. How ‘bout it, Dean-o? You were gone for a while there. Your pa go the train route too?”
Dean looks up at him, eyes bright and gleaming, and Cas traces his thumb along Dean’s jaw while reaching down for his cock. He tries not to, Cas can tell, but Dean lets out a shuddering breath at the contact and pokes his tongue between his teeth, letting his head drop back and exposing the long column of his neck.
All the other classrooms at Thompson High are right at home in the 21st century, whiteboards and smartboards and a shit-ton more boards than they generally need, but due to “aesthetics”—which, Dean’s not a fucking idiot, he knows that’s code for “budget cuts”—his room has been left in the dust, literally.
Zachariah purses his lips and leans back in his chair, his fingers tented contemplatively over his mouth. All that confidence Cas had been feeling just seconds earlier is evaporating fast, and he averts his gaze to the floor as his heart rate quickens.
For a few seconds, Cas wonders how Dean does it. If he couldn’t see, he’d be rife with anxiety, flinching at every step as they run, constantly bracing himself for slamming into something. Whenever he looks at Dean, though, the man is just trotting along, seemingly without a care in the world.
; Castiel has been here for nearly four years, he should know that by now—that’s closest to the museum is called Science Park, and is right near the end of the line, so whenever Castiel gets on, there usually aren’t many people in the car with him. Today is a different story, though; with the nice weather, people have taken advantage of the shopping center at the end of the line, and so the train is already packed with people on their way back into the city. Castiel briefly reconsiders the idea of walking home instead of cramming himself into a stuffy, already-full train car, but his decision is rushed as the conductor clangs a bell impatiently, signaling that the train is about to depart. Digging into his back pocket for his Charlie Card, Castiel taps the card against the turnstile to gain access to the station and climbs up into the train, searching desperately for a bit of free space.
“Five a.m.,” she repeats faintly. “Right. Well, Sam and I will get donuts or something, and I’ll try not to fall asleep on their couch. Sounds like a plan.”
No matter how much Dean tries to convince himself of the opposite, he knows Charlie’s not going to give up until he fills her in. He sighs, running a hand through his hair and tucking his pencil behind his ear.
“Gee, thanks.”
It might also have had something to do with the boy’s soft flannel shirt brushing up against his bare arm and hands as he applied the makeshift ice pack, but nobody needs to know that.

The T is much less crowded at eleven when Castiel finally leaves the Pour House and starts heading for home. Still a bit buzzed and full of cheese fries, Castiel reaches into his shoulder bag for the file Anna had given him earlier. He glances out one of the scuffed, smudged windows of the train, then opens the file with a sigh.
, Cas realizes with a small smile. “How much time do you have?”

After what feels like an eternity, his phone screen lights up with a new notification, and Cas reaches for it, holding his breath. A new text from Dean, finally.
Suffice it to say, it all had been
“Hurry up, Dean,” Sam hisses urgently.
.” He and Dean carry on for another few minutes, the bartender’s voice smooth and melodic around the Spanish words while Dean struggles through them, but he’s still trying, and Cas berates himself for taking French in high school.
“Hey! No harassing my customers, Zeddmore. Also, ‘Squirrel-Hurl’? Seriously?”
“There’s a reason my Instagram is set to private.”
Cas closes out of the Facebook app with a sigh, clicking his phone off. He places the third man in Dean’s drawing as their father, and starts to think about whether or not what Dean had depicted is something Sam still goes through on a regular basis, or if it’s something from the past.
He adjusts the lapels on his jacket before glancing back at his fellow bachelors. “Wish me luck, fellas,” he says with a small grin, before stepping out of the limo.
“And Billie.”
“Dean.”
Cas unconsciously jerks against the cuffs, canting his hips up toward Dean, and he can hear Dean chuckle at the sound of the metal jangling against the wood of his headboard.
“Freudian slip?” He waggles his eyebrows suggestively, and Cas glares at him.
He keeps his head down, fingers laced together behind his head so that his elbows are jutting out for some extra protection, while Sam leans back against the hay, feigning sleep.

--and flashes him a cheeky grin. “A date to your wedding.”
Cas laughs and sets them on the bridge of Dean’s nose, tucking them in securely behind his ears. He adjusts them so that they’re straight, then leans in for a quick kiss on Dean’s cheek--and at least four of his freckles--before sitting back.
“Like what?”
“Whatever you’re salivating over will be there in a half hour,” Sam says. “Right now we gotta focus on getting Cas some new clothes.”
He furrows his brow in confusion, but before he can respond, Dean continues. “This is probably really weird, man,” he says, “but I’m kind of...I don’t have a date to my brother’s wedding, and please let me know if I’m off-base here, but, I mean, you made me a
It all happens pretty quick after that. Sam goes stick-straight a split second before Dean notices the tall, lanky fella in an equally dapper suit who’s undoubtedly got a pistol of some kind on his little brother. Dean’s already poised to jump out of his chair and wring Crowley’s goddamn neck when he feels the cold barrel of a pistol pressed hard against his spine.

“Yeah, mind sharin’ what exactly the solution is, then?”
“It’s me, Gabriel,” Castiel adds, hands raised, epitome of cool, calm, and collected. “Castiel.”
memories. So, what d’you say, Cas? You in or you out?”
Cas is considering a particularly tempting cluster of Italian cookies when Dean shoves a small white bag into his hands. “Moment of truth,” he says. “Let’s go.”
Castiel reaches for the magazine, glancing at his sister skeptically. “Anna, what—”
Cas pauses, catching his bottom lip between his teeth before spreading his hands wide with an apologetic smile. “Surprise…?”
“We are.”
“Cas, listen—” He ducks when Cas lashes out with a sloppy punch to his jaw that barely grazes him, and Dean would be feeling good about his chances to put him in his place if the shitty punch hadn’t apparently been part of Cas’ plan. While Dean’s got his mind on dodging the punch, Cas delivers a sharp kick to Dean’s already bent knee that drops him like a sack of potatoes.
“It’s actually a lucky break,” Balthazar muses. “He won’t even be able to see what an ugly mug you’ve got for yourself, Cassie.”
Novak looks at him flatly, then continues walking. Dean stays put for a few seconds, trying to figure out his next move. Finally, it hits him, and he snaps his fingers.
The headphones are noise-cancelling, but as Cas scrolls through Reddit, he hears his co-hosts exchanging a few last pleasantries and well wishes with Dean, and glances up to see him waving as he heads for the door, Hannah trailing behind.
“You’re gonna call him, right? You
Cas’ blood goes cold at that, and he stiffens. He has a hard enough time describing himself to people during a job interview; there’s no way he’s going to be able to describe himself well enough to make Dean find him attractive. “I...me?”
someone else a huge favor,
“Of course.”
Cas wants to have a carefree night with his teammates, but carefree isn’t really in his vocabulary in the first place, and he still can’t get his mind off Dean’s sketch.
“Senior figure drawing,” he says automatically, tucking the little note of ideas in the last few pages of his planner. Charlie rubs her hands together excitedly and Dean narrows his eyes. “What’d I just sign up for?”
fucking good, Cas.”
It's a photo of a beautiful woman holding two small boys. She looks angelic, a small, closed-lipped smile that seems simple, but Cas can see all the pride, happiness, and contentment hidden behind it. The boys are smiling wide, and Cas can feel his lips quirking up in a small grin in spite of himself.
“Why the hell would he run with me? I don’t even know him. I don’t even

hashtag and handle out there, which explains why they were tagged; despite their small following, Cas won’t kid himself into thinking he’s some kind of recognizable celebrity.
Dean shakes his head with a chuckle. “You,” he answers, leaning forward heavily on an elbow, resting his head in his hand, “gotta stop.”
Dean takes the non-answer for what it is and grins, elbowing his little brother. “You hear that, Sam? We got ourselves an angel watching over us.”
“Hi, guys!” Lisa says cheerfully as several of the guys jog up to her in the middle of a football field, roped off specifically for the show. She’s standing next to Chuck in smart workout gear, her hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. “Welcome to the first group date of the season.”
“Don’t…” Castiel casts desperately for some other excuse he can give, some reason why he’s the
Dean studies him for a few seconds, then huffs out a sigh. “What makes you think I want to fucking talk to you?”
Fuck.
him,” Lafitte says. “There’s a difference.”
Soon enough, it’s time for them to meet up, and as much as he tries, Cas can’t stop the tiny ball of excitement from building up in his gut as they walk to the restaurant. If Sam Winchester really did have a fan club, he’d definitely count himself among its ranks. Sam had created quite the fanbase for himself as the endearing, good-natured kid who wanted nothing but the best for his older brother. America had fallen in love with Sam almost as much as Dean, and Cas would be lying if he said he wasn’t excited to meet the younger Winchester, as well.
lowly of him, it’s not a total cure-all.
Balancing their fourth rounds in his hands, Sam heads back to their table and sets them carefully on the tabletop. Once he’s grabbed his seat, he shoves his hair out of his face and grins at them.
Once they’ve found a spot to sit—Dean’s very particular, circling around and around certain areas like a dog trying to find the perfect space to piss—Cas takes a few seconds to breathe it all in. There’s no screaming kids or fried food smells, just crashing waves and salt in the air.
And when Cas does, he gets it.
A winky face pops up a second later, and Cas rolls his eyes.
“What was that?” he hisses.
“Stay still.”
Dean tips his head back and takes a long pull of his beer before continuing. “Dunno what I’m gonna do once I’m on another route and won’t be comin’ here anymore. Gonna miss it.”
He takes a step back and beams at Cas, his eyes wide and bright with adrenaline. “Fucking
"Tell that to my dad," he says softly.
should be too, but Cas—Cas and his alcohol-flushed cheeks and gummy smile that shows up just a little more freely now—is what he’s really focused on, and he can’t bring himself to care about much else, including their plans for getting out of here.
Cas continues to stare at him for a few seconds, mouth agape, before he shakes his head quickly and gives Dean a bewildered little smile that makes Dean’s heart beat just that much faster. “You won,” he says.
Dean scoffs. “Sam’ll take him out later. That dog has more energy than...most things, actually. Jack’s just my speed. Just let me know if I’m gonna hit shit, the usual,” he says as he starts down the walkway.
sense, considering it wasn’t at all time-sensitive and they knew you were waiting here and...I’m sorry.”
“It’s really quite beautiful,” Cas says. “A lot nicer than the others.” Dean looks unconvinced, so Cas starts to describe it. “It’s up high,” he says, “as I’m sure you noticed, with the long escalator ride.” Dean grunts in affirmation, and Cas continues. “You ride right over the Charles itself, and it doesn’t matter what side you’re on; when you look out the window, you see the river and the skyline. And it’s very nice, especially on a sunny day like today. The crew teams are still out on the water practicing, and the water itself is...shimmery. Like a mirror.”
“The joys of being the newbies on staff. Lucky us.” Hannah gets to her feet and peers down one of the hallways. The floor is quiet now, with the handful of residents without holiday visitors either watching TV or sleeping in their rooms. “You're welcome to take your break if you'd like.”
“Old enough to appreciate a good game of B-I-N-G-O?” Gabe asks hopefully. When Cas shakes his head, Gabe pouts, but doesn’t try to argue anything further.
“Uh, ma’am?” Sam finally calls out. “Ma’am, if you’d be so kind, I’m wondering if you might have room for me and my two friends here to hitch a ride? Not far, only a few miles.”
“We made the rules, so we can change ‘em. Besides—” Dean stops in front of Ansin, pulls open the heavy Victorian door, and holds it open for Cas, “—we’re here, so quit worrying.” He winks as Cas walks past him into the building.
“I know, but--”
that—but before they go their separate ways, the guy reaches out and presses his hand gently against Dean’s cheek, and Dean goes still, leaning unconsciously into the touch.
At some point, episode two starts playing, but without hesitation or saying a word, they both decide they’ll watch it later.
“We’ll regroup tomorrow,” Sam says, one arm tucked behind his head as he gazes up at the stars. “All right?”
“How’s your nose?” his boss asks, not unkindly, and Castiel shrugs.
look at him like he’s shit on her shoe. She doesn’t reply right away, and Dean’s convinced he’ll just never get her to crack when she presses a finger to her lips in a hushing motion, a smug little smile making itself known.
There’s no response save for Sam’s laughter echoing back through the makeshift camp.
“No.”
He doesn’t even realize he’d said the nickname until Cas tilts his head to the side a little, a confused little smile on his face that’s doing nothing to make Dean think he’s any less good-looking. “Oh, shit, uh, sorry, Castiel, I just--”
“I’m...happy,” Cas finally says. “I look happy. I usually hate pictures of myself, but I really like this one. A lot. So, yes…” Cas’ voice trails off as he leans forward and gives Dean a quick peck on the lips. “It’s nice.”
“Could be better,” he says, his voice nasally and muffled by the ice pack. He watches as Michael starts scribbling on the pad, and shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
Dean grins back and sticks out his hand--or at least, sticks it out as far as it’ll go in their current cramped quarters. “Dean,” he says, “
“Cas!”
“The camera loves me,” he says with a shrug that doesn’t feel natural, but is enough to make Dean throw his head back and laugh as he walks his phone back to him.
Sam for this.
He glances up to see who tagged Dean in the photo. Sam, Dean’s little brother. He’s also quite young, but still looks remarkably similar to the other boy in Dean’s drawing, and Cas sighs as he gets more and more proof that Dean’s sketch wasn’t just of some random family. He scrolls down a bit to read the caption under the photo.
“Wednesday.”
“Hey!”
to said partner is something else entirely--but once they have a relatively strong handle on it, Castiel allows himself to feel a tiny spark of optimism. Maybe this won’t be as bad as he’d feared.
Staring at his little brother, Dean’s eyes wander down to the gun in his hand, and his eyes widen when he realizes that he
They were only freshmen, but Charlie had sweet-talked a few members of the sound engineering department and managed to land them a late-night slot at Emerson’s radio station, Saturday nights at 1am. They had a grand total of three live listeners for their premiere, but once Charlie started archiving the episodes and turning them into podcasts, Rose-Colored Glasses started picking up steam. They’d gained a cult following, both in and out of Emerson, so much so that by the time the four friends had graduated, there had been no question that they’d continue the show.
Novak glares at him. “If you don’t want his help, that’s fine, but—”
“Brother,” Dean says simply. “He kept wanting me to listen to it, I kept brushing it off, then I finally humored him one night and heard that goddamn ‘Yorktown’ song and,” he snaps his fingers, “that was that.”
I couldn’t help but overhear that you gentlemen are looking for someone.”
“Fine,” Dean says, imitating his voice perfectly.
“And pie,” Dean adds, digging around in the fridge and reemerging with a bottle of orange juice. “And beer. And I’m not gonna say no to pasta.” He takes a long swig of the orange juice then grins at Cas.
“Cane,” Cas whispers, and Dean straightens a little.
Dean shrugs. "You know more than me."
Sam cranes his neck to look up at his brother. “‘Epitome.’ Nice word.”
“Shit,” Gabe mutters, and Cas turns on his brother, staring at him.
, to make matters worse, you thought it’d be a good idea to take the next elevator instead?” Cas stares at Dean as his cheeks go pink under his freckles. “You could barely
Alistair looks down at Winchester’s unconscious form and wipes the hilt of his knife against his shirt, as if it had been contaminated just by touching him.
“Could’ve fooled me.” Dean slides out of his chair and runs a hand through his hair. “Normally I’d walk my date back to their car,” he says slowly, “but I’m guessin’ that’ll get a big fat ‘no’ from you, huh?”
“We’re going to be late,” Cas says, flopping back onto Dean’s bed.
“‘Course,” Dean says, sounding surprised that Cas is surprised by this. “I mean,
And no, Cas doesn’t want to end up on an episode of
That hurts more than Cas had been expecting it to, and he knows that Winchester can tell. He grins smugly at Cas, and almost on impulse, Cas leans back and stretches out, crossing his feet at the ankles and lacing his fingers together behind his head. “Sure is nice to be able to stretch out,” he says. He feels like an idiot the second he says it, but it’s something he has that Winchester doesn’t, something he can hold over him.
Charlie’s eyes flick up, but she keeps her finger to her lips and shakes her head. “You,” she finally says, pointing at Dean. “You sing lead.”
“Are you asking if they blackmailed me, or if I need you to help me dig up some blackmail on them so I can get out of this stupid trip?”
what this is. “I’m not doing this right now.”
The wood is hot and brittle under Dean’s hands, but he grits his teeth and keeps going until his feet hit solid ground again. He’s never felt anything like this, the scorched-earth dryness in his throat and the sweat plastering his clothes to his body, but that’s nothing compared to the relief he feels when he scans the ground floor of the barn and his eyes land on—
“You invited a dude you barely even know to our wedding? What if he’s crazy?”
“I’m working on it,” he finally says after a few seconds of silence (and Charlie looking like she’s on the verge of beating it out of him anyway). “Been working up to it, but now I just need to...I don’t know, talk to him.”
“I’d be honored,” he says, leaning forward so that she can pin the rose to his jacket. Once it’s been fastened to the fabric and she sits back, he flashes her a soft smile and scoots forward, closing the few remaining inches between them.
“Good. Okay.” She takes a deep breath, seemingly more to calm herself down than Castiel. “Just know, you’d be doing me
“I think those two—”
“You’re a player,” he says. “A fake. You’re cocky and self-absorbed and don’t think of anyone but yourself.”
Cas stares at his bedroom ceiling, mind still racing two hours after his discovery. Dean is the Colt; the Colt is Dean. The mysterious vigilante wanted by at least five surrounding police precincts, who’s responsible for the last ten--
“Bullshit,” he says. “I know how you run when you’re feeling good, and this--” He lets out a harsh little laugh, “--
“I...we just passed one that said, ‘It’s hot, but so are you.’”
Balthazar suddenly smacks his open palm against the tabletop, and Castiel jerks his head up, startled. “Exactly," his friend says. "You're doing something you like to do, so It won't be that bad." It's a stupid solution; Castiel
Dean shifts as a spark sets itself alight in his chest, and he takes a breath, willing himself not to blow whatever progress he’s made with Cas tonight. “You don’t have to lie, Cas,” he says. Cas’ head shoots up and he looks at Dean with an odd mix of confusion and panic. Dean grins. “It’s because I’m just such a joy to be around, ain’t it?”
-scotti earlier,” he says, pleased when he catches Castiel grin at his correction. “It was awesome. You should make sure Sam and Jess order those for the wedding along with their cake.”
“We’re not that bad,” Coach Shurley interjects before Dean or Lafitte can say anything else. He glances at Cas and spreads one arm wide, gesturing to Cas’ new teammates. “Gentlemen, meet our new catcher, Cas Novak. Cas Novak, meet the gentlemen.”
, for fuck’s sake; what made them think a fucking reality show would be any different?
Cas pinches the bridge of his nose between two fingers, then closes his laptop without finishing the video and gets to his feet, digging in his pocket for his keys.
Cas shrugs one shoulder the way he always sees Dean do. “He just, he wasn’t himself today. At all.”
There are three things to know about Dean Winchester.
“There’s not?” Sam asks, his voice sounding equal parts surprised and disappointed, and Dean’s gotta laugh.
Other runners stream around them and start picking up their paces, darting away down Hopkinton’s Main Street. They seem to be doing okay during this straight shot, though, until he feels Dean stumble against him and hears him mutter, “Son of a bitch.”
No camera angle or lighting shift can hide the way Lisa’s face falls at that. “Oh. Oh, of course. I just, are you sure I can’t help you to feel better?” She trails her finger along his jaw and down the buttons of his coat, but he doesn’t move.
Charlie scoffs, punching Sam in the shoulder (then trying hard to cover up the quick jolt of pain that must go through her arm at the motion). “You boys are all anyone in the music industry’s been on about for days now! Sold-out records, thinkpieces in gazettes from here to Topeka—we can’t get the phone to stop ringing with folks who have questions about who y’all are.” She pauses, then looks at the three of them suspiciously. “You mean to tell me you don’t know any of that?”
Neither of them have a car on campus ("Fuckin' $140 for a parking pass? Yeah, right, man," Dean says as reasoning for why he didn't get one), and the weather isn't bitingly cold yet, so they decide to trek through the fall New Hampshire night.
He waves at them, that smug, smarmy smile back in place. Then, in a cloud of dust and exhaust, he’s off back down the road, leaving the two of them high and dry.
Sam wants to argue, Dean can tell, but he glances over at Cas, who’s admiring a brass pocket watch on the other side of the store, and sighs. “You two go wait outside while I pay for these. I’ll meet you in the back.”
The beep comes too fast, and, distracted by the husky, gravelly tone of Cas’ voice, Dean finds himself stumbling right out of the gate. “Cas, hey, it’s, uh. It’s Dean. Dean Winchester, you know, the guy who asked you to his brother’s wedding even though you’d just met him a few days earlier. That’s me, I like to cut right to the chase.” He lets out a weak laugh that sounds forced and uncomfortable even to his ears, and he sighs, shaking out his free hand to try and calm his nerves. He takes a deep breath before starting over.
"It was not my intention." Castiel admits, which makes Dean laugh.
"I happen to like him better this way!" The man huffs, crossing his arms, "He's slightly less of a dick like this."
"Fix your hair."
"So because Sammy just happened to pray at that moment you were sent here to ruin our lives?"
"None that you are capable of." Castiel sets Sam down, who runs to Dean excitedly.
"Dean…I am uncomfortable with this…" Castiel leans over towards the man next to him and whispers, "Den of iniquity."
"I do not mean to." Castiel murmurs and Jo shoots Dean a harsh look before punching him in the shoulder.
If it is Castiel and he did, for some reason, give up his grace, does he even remember Dean? Do they come back with their memory?
"When not mixed with the cold it burns, just like the cold freezes, but when put together they are very comfortable." Kevin explains, taking Castiel's hand and bringing it under the faucet to feel the very nice temperature of the water.
Dean looks at him annoyed, "I can let Sam get away with stuff, because he is adorable. You, however, are far less adorable, so stop fucking talking."
"Hello, Lisa? This is Dean, the friend of that weirdo Castiel you met earlier." Dean says before listening to whatever Lisa is saying that causes him to laugh. "Yeah, he is trying out to become a pimp." The man teases, looking over to a now glaring angel, "Anyways, he has informed me you are a milk connoisseur and I must go out to dinner with you because of this. Yes, five sounds good. Alright, I look forward to meeting you." He goes to hang up before she says something that stops him. "Hm? Am I hotter than Cas? …Hell yeah I am. Besides, Cas is more cute than hot. Like some little kid trying to be a grown up."
"But…they are not…" Castiel mumbles as he tries to smooth out his hair, before he remembers something. As a child, Gabriel allowed Castiel to believe the stars were made of candy and flowers to make him happy. Castiel has not dealt with children before, so perhaps allowing them illusions is the way to go. "…They are not just your stars." He begins, gaining the brothers attentions, "They are Dean's as well, correct?"
"Hm…sounds fair. Bring it on, Cas." Dean mumbles before dozing off.
Dean's frantic shuffling from the bedroom stills for a moment before he returns to the living room and stares Castiel down. "We don't talk about yesterday. That was a chick flick moment and I do not do those."
"Do not apologize for something you are not actually sorry for." Castiel scolds and Dean cups his face.
"You know what is funny?" Gabriel asks, lowering the toy before gently tossing it back onto the bed, "You are so attached to these boys that you are actually hurt at the idea of them liking someone more than you, or Dean being angry with you, so you're trying to kick your dear brother out."
"Dean, does this car make you happy?" He asks, having noticed a sort of joy in the man since they entered the vehicle. It's nothing compared to normal happiness, but it's a sort of nostalgia that makes the man's heavy heart seem lighter. Of course Castiel sees no perks in the oversized slow box on wheels, but he would never say that to Dean or Sam.
"I am wonderful." Castiel smiles, remembering Dean laughing a few moments ago. Laughing because of him. This is the closest he has come to fulfilling Sam's wish since he got here and he would be lying if he said he wasn't very proud of himself right now. He has even received a nickname, an action of affection for humans.
Castiel would laugh at the question were it not a rude thing to do. "My happiness is not important right now.
"Dean, I would never sell the flesh of others! That is a sin! An angel peddling humans to one another for carnal pleasure would be a first class ticket to hell!" Castiel explains and Dean laughs.
"What's your name, mister angel?" Sam asks, smiling up at him from the feathers his face is in.
The sensation sends Castiel over the edge and he begins moaning, his hips beginning to meet with Dean's as the man kisses him and rakes his fingers through the wings.
Now that he thinks about it, Gabriel has had many human lovers, among other creatures. Has he ever fallen for one? No, Gabriel has never fallen in love. He understands it, but nothing more than that, just as most angels do. Perhaps angels do not have the capacity to fall in love. Angels are meant to love all humans equally, so perhaps sex with them is not a matter of that human being special, but it is a matter of giving them what they want.
This has to be his best idea yet.
Castiel leaves the fort and stretches his wings, flexing them and working out kinks made from the foreign feeling of someone sleeping on them, before he hides them. "I like all humans," He calls as he rounds the hall to the kitchen, "You two are no exception."
"He is a guy I met the other day, he's interested in babysitting Sammy, but I told him I needed to get to know him better before he did so he offered…to come…to work…" Dean says, his words growing quiet as Bobby stares him down unconvinced.
"I only look a year younger than you, Dean." Castiel reminds him. "Your date is at five, so hurry up and get ready."
"Okay, okay, I get it!" The man groans, "I'll go get ready." He grumbles, heading into the bathroom to take a shower.
"You did! Cas you just laughed!"
Dean laughs, "No stranger than you."
"This is getting weird, we're just gonna go." He says, grabbing Benny's shoulder to turn him away from his stare down with Castiel. "Thanks for watching Sammy last night."
Dean raises a brow before his gaze follows Castiel's to the stairs where Sam and Gabriel are standing. "Oh god, why couldn't it have been a date?" He groans.
"But I am here to make you happy." The angel looks at him confused, "How can I make you happy if I am not helping you?"
"Excellent." Gabriel grins down at Sam, "Don't you think?"
Castiel nods and follows him to the table where Sam is waiting.
"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just get in there and eat some burgers like a normal person." Dean groans, going to the dinning room.
"We cannot interfere with what should happen." He explains, "We can only help with the aftermath."
Not once since the day he went out drinking with Castiel has he touched alcohol, nor wanted to. He's opening to his friends more, who are always there to lend a hand, helping him to feel like part of a family again. Looking around the room, like every other place in the house, Dean thinks of Castiel.
"Yes you would." Gabriel grins, "You covet my brother as a king covets land. I can't blame you, he is quite the cutie. That tousled hair, those pouty lips, and that way he tilts his head to the side like a confused little kitten when he doesn't get something."
"Yeah! Stars!"
"Yes, we have become acquainted." Castiel mumbles, his voice laced with bitterness. He has to play nice with a vampire, all because of Dean and Gabriel. This is definitely something he will be taking up with Gabriel in the near future.
"Son of a bitch…" Dean grumbles, watching the lively mess that was occurring in his house. In one month it will all be gone. How will Castiel react? How will Sam react? Hell, how is he even going to tell Sam this?
Castiel takes the phone, eying Dean in confusion, before responding to Sam. "Hello, Sam."
"So, ya gonna ask my brother on that date or just continue dwelling over your 'no homo' attraction to his pretty face?" Gabriel asks, startling Dean. "Because I can tell you which action will get you further."
"You want to make me happy? Boobs and booze will make me happy." Dean explains and Castiel stares at him for a moment before letting go of Sam so he can hear again.
"Don't be mean to Castiel's wings!" Sam whines, running over to Castiel and trying to reach where Dean touched, thankfully unable to.
It is hard to avoid him, since they do share a bed, but Gabriel evidently does not want to risk even the chance that the Winchesters will hear them and has therefore remained silent on such things during this time. Thank heavens.
"I am familiar with the term, yes."
Dean scowls, "Of course I know that. I don't want him here forever, he's just another child I have to take care of."
"I'm going to bed now, so goodnight!" Sam says from the other line, his voice trying to hide disappointment over something Castiel can't place. However, he is already planning out ways to enact revenge if it is something Benny has done. Better to be prepared.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Not more?" Sam asks, pouting more. "I'm nicer to you."
Castiel looks back at him, "That you have a thing for twenty year old brunettes."
Dean twitches a little, "He's some weird-ass twenty year old angel. None of that is adorable."
"I see…" Castiel mumbles before looking to Bobby, "I suppose I shall come up with something." He says and walks away from Dean to return to the older man. "My name is Castiel, I am living with Dean right now as a favor for my parents. He does not want to leave me alone in his house yet, though, as he doesn't trust me yet."
"Hmm…" Sam closes his eyes again, "Mommy smelled good, was she heavenly?"
Castiel furrows his brows in confusion, "No, angels are incapable."
"Yeah, yeah," Gabriel waves it off, heading out to the living room with a very nervous Castiel tailing him. "Where is the whiney Winchester?"
"Merciless." Castiel begins, "There was a time in the colonial era when I ran into one eating a-" A hand clasps over his mouth from behind.
"You mean-?"
With Sam it is easier to notice, as he is still small, but even in his case it is sometimes hard to remember just how young he really is. Dean, too, is only twenty-one. A normal person his age would be running off with friends, partying in bars and learning life lessons, if the television is anything to go by. As Dean glares at him, almost as if to cover up the fact he was indeed nervous of reprimand, it really sinks in that these are not just a quota to be filled. These are two lost children in need of guidance. Guidance Castiel certainly cannot give him.
"I need to get groceries, you should come with me." He lies, and knows Castiel knows it's a lie, but damnit he cannot bring himself to ask him to just hang out.
Of course there are ones who deviate from the norm and go about their lives seeking joy as they please, such as Gabriel. Yes, the man who sent him down here and granted Benny freedom is certainly the most joyous angel there is. Aside from, perhaps, Balthazar and probably Anna. He wonders if there are more angels who live for themselves, ones he simply has yet to meet, but the thought is quickly stricken down as any angels who do such a rare thing are known all throughout heaven.
Even with Gabriel coming around as much as possible, Dean would never change a thing. Except maybe that time Gabriel decided to scare the shit out of one of Sam's professors with a sewer gator when he was mean to the boy. That was a bit of overkill.
Castiel blinks a few times before looking at Benny confused, "But…for a supernatural being to fall in love with a human…is…unnatural." He narrows his gaze on the vampire, "And how can a woman who was born all that time ago be alive today?"
"That's okay, Gabriel doesn't need to be my brother, he can just be a friend!"
"Dean's not mad at you, he's mad at Kevin for meeting you. Now Kevin will be talking about you to everyone." Sam mumbles, his face now buried in Castiel's shoulder. "Which means he will be teased a lot about living with another man. He's simply embarrassed. When Dean is embarrassed he gets mean towards the person embarrassing him."
"Lust is pretty great, though." Dean smirks, "In fact, let me show you just how great it is. You can't stay a virgin forever."
"Yes, you form in the woman's stomach," Castiel explains, placing a hand on his own, "Starting out very tiny and then growing into a full infant. Once you are a full infant you are born from them. I do not know how you are formed, though."
Castiel looks around the room, wondering if Kevin is one of those 'imaginary friends' he has heard about. "Who is Kevin?"
His eyes wander to Dean in the driver's seat. The man means a lot to him, as does his little brother. There is nothing he wants more than to help them achieve happiness, not so he can finally prove himself worthy of the new job angels have taken on, but because he just wishes for it. His desire for their happiness is not necessarily stronger than his desire for all humans' happiness, but he does want to be the one who helps them achieve it. Does that mean he loves them in a special way?
Dean stares at him, "So it's your sweet spot."
"Then why the hell are you in my house?" Dean groans, "Did I do something to piss off the angels? God? I mean I have slept around a little but I've stopped since I became Sam's guardian so-!"
"He's your brother. You deal with him."
"You are so strange now," His brother sighs, "So human and domestic."
"Alright, I can easily ask Gabriel." Castiel points out, "Since he will be visiting."
When they reach the strip club he is still unsure as to why he hasn't told Dean about Benny's secret. Worse than that, however, he is beginning to understand where Gabriel and their father were coming from in their decision.
Dean nods, pulling out his phone, "Too bad he's gone for the weekend." He muses as he goes through his contact list. "Looks like it's Benny for you."
"I don't wanna go to Benny's! I wanna go on your date!" Sam cries, earning him a bop on the head from Dean.
"Alright, what should we have for a date?"
Sam looks up at him, overjoyed, "Cas, did you just laugh?"
"WHY?" Dean yells, making Sam back away.
"Whoa! Another angel!" Sam gasps, jumping up from the carpet to run over and hug Gabriel's wings.
Castiel turns to him, "I will help you through this, Dean, but I now know that will require a bit of toughness. From here on out, I promise I will not let you down."
"I have procured you a date for the evening." Castiel says, handing the paper to Dean, "Her name is Lisa and she is very knowledgeable in milk, despite what she says." He sees the look on confusion on Dean's face and leans in, "Don't worry Dean, she is a brunette."
Castiel frowns, "Getting lectured by Dean, I believe I have hit a new low."
Dean's thrusts lose their rhythm and become more erratic as the two grow closer to reaching their limit. Castiel tenses up, his fingers and toes digging into Dean as he reaches the edge, toppling over it when Dean leans forward and lightly bites his wing. Dean finishes soon after and the two take a shower together before collapsing onto the bed.
Castiel remains silent for a moment, looking at a now exhausted looking Dean and wondering how long he has wanted to get that off of his chest. So much guilt over something that is not his fault, it is no wonder Castiel could never help him. "You have done nothing wrong." He assures Dean, sitting down on the ground beside him. "Everyone deals with grief in different ways. You shut yourself in and drank to numb the pain, Sam hid in learning and trying to become an adult faster than necessary, no doubt to help the brother he loved. Neither of you are wrong, neither of you have replaced the other with someone else. I am an angel, Dean, not his brother."
Castiel reaches out and pets Sam's hair, "Wings are a heavenly attribute, and they are pleasing to all of the senses. For both our sake, and human's sakes."
Castiel nods, "It is true, he is not." He agrees, earning him a harsh look from Dean.
"Angels are weird." Dean teases, but continues playing with his wings anyways.
It takes a moment for Castiel to catch his bearings, his large black wings stretching out and flexing as he swoops down and lands in the child's room. "Hello, Sam." Castiel says and the child gasps.
Castiel shakes his hand awkwardly, still unsure of how it works. "I am an an-"
Lisa giggles, "Ohhh, so it's like that. How sweet, I'm sure with a boyfriend as cute as you this Dean is happy."
"How would I even know that?"
"Hey, Cas, if you are listening…I'm not sure if you can request a specific angel or not. With my luck your stupid brother is listening to it instead of you, in which case thanks a whole fucking lot for telling my baby brother you two needed to leave the house so Cas and I could have adult time. You know how many times he has asked what adult time is? Not cool you stupid angel.
"That's right." Gabriel nods, "He has grown attached to you both, the angel Castiel loves the Winchester brothers more than any other human, and that is not allowed." He sighs heavily, "It is my own fault, sending him down here. I never thought he would grow attached, though. He has never cared for humans more than necessary."
Dean rolls his eyes as he places pancakes on three plates, cutting them up on the plate he hands to Sam before walking over to Castiel and handing him a plate, "Here."
"Yes, I will meet you both again." The angel promises before handing Sam over to Dean and going to Gabriel, who takes them away.
Castiel stares at the carton confused, "I don't understand why there are percentages. If they want milk, would they not want it to all be milk?"
"That's true, sex is not always love." Castiel agrees and Dean looks to him curiously. Maybe they could- "We're not having sex." The angel says before Dean can even legitimately think it. "Sex when emotions that cannot be returned are involved is a mess."
"It's pretty easy to find out," Castiel begins walking towards the kitchen, coming to a stop in front of Dean, "When one buries their face in another person's hair." He mocks before leaving a highly flustered human in his wake.
"You are everything that is wrong in my life right now." Dean grumbles, taking another drink from the beer bottle in front of him.
Gabriel laughs, "That is exactly our job now. We have nothing to fight anymore, Castiel, you are simply an angel here to guide and help the humans. It is our father's wish."
"Sammy I told you to stop hanging all over him." A familiar voice calls from somewhere behind Castiel. Dean comes to stand in front of them both and stare down the angel. "I know I said keep him happy, but you don't need to spoil him."
Sam smiles up at Castiel, "Castiel is adorable." He says before looking to Dean, "Right?"
Dean rolls his eyes a little, "Whatever, let's just go home."
"So…um…if I were to have prayed to you in that time…?"
"It means he's a fucking nerd." Dean huffs, grabbing Sam out of Castiel's arms and placing him in a chair. "A nerd who, when I leave Sam with him, teaches the kid how to talk like a nerd."
Dean never could have, or dared to, imagine that Castiel would return and yet here he was. Within a few years they got married, officially adopted Sam, and began a life as a married couple. Dean works in Bobby's garage, even inheriting it when the man retired. Castiel ends up a stay-at-home dad, until Sam is in grade school and he gets a job at a nearby nursing home.
"I have no interest in seeing boobs." Castiel says, ignoring Sam struggling in his grasp, "Why must we go there?"
"Goodbye, Dean." Castiel mumbles as Sam waves.
"G-Gabriel!" Castiel gasps, "What are you doing here?"
"I will when you do." Castiel counters and Dean slumps against the wall and in his grasp.
"Sam, we can't just-" Castiel begins, being interrupted by Gabriel.
Castiel stares at Dean confused. These strange phrases humans use take a moment for him to make sense of. Perhaps he should discuss with Gabriel the idea of teaching angels how humans speak. "…It…is…bothersome." He says and Dean nods, so apparently he got it right.
"His what now? Did you agree to a date with my three year old brother?"
"We'll walk for all I care. Or you can use your angel-powers to bring us home."
"If you don't go Castiel will be sad!" Dean tries and Sam kicks him harder.
"You can't?" Dean asks.
"What do we do?" Sam whines and Castiel thinks for a minute.
"That guy you brought, yeah, he was Dean's gay thing." Benny explains as he hands her a plate.
Charlie brings a surprise to Sam's birthday party.
The woman looks at Castiel curiously, "Huh, I thought Dean was straight…" Her eyes roam the young angel before a smirk comes to her lips, "But you do seem to be quite the catch." She pats Castiel on the back and smiles at the two of them. "I promise not to tell anyone."
"…Gabe left a note saying he took Sammy out…" Dean explains, "I should have never let them get close, of all the people Sammy could befriend he has to be the worst!"
"Sorry. You're sick I shouldn't have taken advantage-"
"Oh, right, an angel wouldn't know." The teen says, more to himself than anything, and Castiel panics a little. No one is supposed to know, Dean said it was dangerous.
"I have heard, and witnessed, the things you did before 'love'. Forgive me if I do not trust the love you bare for a human being strong enough to negate all of that."
"A last?" Castiel asks and Dean nods.
The angel gasps, "That is not funny, either, Dean!" He looks to Sam to back him up, but the child is laying on the floor giggling, so instead he decides to just chase down Dean. "You are a very good man, Dean! You're not going to-!" Castiel goes quiet when he sees Dean leaning against the counter with the phone, his pointer finger against his lips to signal silence.
"Damn, that was close." Rufus muses, walking past the young men and over to the car to inspect the broken jack. "Dean I told you to throw this jack out last week!"
"Um…baby is running low on gas right now…so…let's walk there." Dean says, opting for lie, "Since we're walking I can show you around town some as well."
"Nah, I'm gonna stay the night." Gabriel says decidedly and Sam smiles up at him.
The break doesn't last long as Dean's fingers go back to his wings, gently running them through his feathers and Castiel loses it. Within the blink of an eye he has brought them to Dean's bedroom. He pulls Dean back into another kiss almost immediately, allowing the man to inch them onto the bed.
"Because we are going to be doing grown up stuff."
"Gabriel is on his way, I can feel him. I can't move from this spot though so they will have to come up here." Castiel mumbles as feathers begin to fall off of his wings.
"You stare too much." Benny counters.
"You heard the angel! Patience!"
Dean looks at him annoyed before turning to look at Castiel in exhaustion. "Did you hear that, Cas, it's icky?"
"Shower." Sam says.
Castiel watches helplessly as the two run back and forth, bringing blankets and pillows into Sam's room to build a fort. A huge fort that is help up in no small thanks to Gabriel's power.
He will help Dean find a woman to give Sam the family he wants, and help ease the child into his own departure.
Castiel frowns, "I am not sure, the only way to help in this instance would be to be some form of caretaker. That is not an angel's job."
"It's alright." Castiel says, sitting up, "I'm feeling a little better." He lies before Gabriel and Sam appear in the bedroom.
"I didn't for the longest time," Castiel admits, "but since Gabriel has come I have had more time to notice things and yes, I've known for a couple of days." He sits up straight and looks away, "But I am an angel and you should not entertain any thoughts of it. I was hoping you wouldn't realize it at all. It would be easier to leave if you hadn't said it out loud…"
Charlie laughs a little. "Why don't you just give me…" She pulls the boy into a tight hug, "A kiss!" She exclaims, kissing the giggling boy's cheek.
Using the ability of an angel in such a way is not right. Yet Gabriel had practically made such a thing his favorite pastime.
Fucking God's sense of humor is shitty.
Dean stares at Castiel from the kitchen. Gabriel told him to take the angel out on their own today, but he's still struggling on how to bring it up. A day alone with Castiel seems sort of strange now. As if it's somehow inappropriate. As if…
"Cassie?" Sam asks as the younger angel glares at his brother.
The angel gives him a curious look, wanting to question that but deciding against it as he gently lays Dean's legs back down on the ground. He doesn't say anything, just stares at Dean with increasing confusion. As an angel he is not supposed to interfere with humans and their own devices. This would not have even killed Dean, only hurt him in a way Castiel could easily fix.
"Good luck with your stupid brother."
"I'll try not to…" Sam begins, looking up at his brother, "But who knows what I'll say do Benny when they are laying me down to sleep?"
"Oh, damn, kudos to you, Dean!" Charlie calls, completely ignored by Dean.
"N-no, it's fine, I'm not wo-I'm not uncomfortable with it…much." Dean frowns, "Anyways, let's get going. There's a cool spot I want to show you on the way."
"Thank you, miss. It would cause quite the uproar if anyone knew." The angel says, "Dean does not need that sort of trouble."
"It is alright."
"I am not sick, Dean, thank you for your concern." Castiel says, his eyes going down to his pocket. Now is the time to give it to him. Or he could ignore it and just get rid of it another time.
"That's right."
A few months after Castiel's departure Dean is cleaning out Sam's room. The boy is taking a bath with Kevin and he decided it was a good opportunity to clean the messy room. It has been strange since Castiel left, but he has taken the angel's words to heart.
"What the hell you little shit, shut your stupid mouth!" Dean yells and Sam lifts his head from Castiel's shoulder to smile at the angel.
"Good, because I won't leave my brother with a man who will spend the entire day telling him war stories about demons and vampires and other shit that goes bump in the night."
Castiel nods and walks over, opening the door to see a young man with no food. "You do not have food, you cannot come in."
"Not fair." Sam pouts. "He likes me, too."
Castiel wakes up to Sam curled up against the feathers of his wing and Dean staring him down from behind the small child. It is strange, and his wings are feeling cramped, along with the rest of him, as Dean continues to stare and Sam lets out a small snore.
A/N: Sorry. Writers block. This is all I've got.
Castiel grimaces as an unsettling image comes to his mind, "Kevin is in no means like male genitalia, Dean, do not be obscene."
Being on earth is fun, but angels are not meant to stay here for long periods of time. The air is polluted, which has given Castiel a cough recently, and all of the gravity, not to mention hiding of his wings, is putting a toll on his body. He'll never let the brothers know this, though. Earth was specifically not made for angels, and Castiel was experiencing this fact first hand.
"Not in the least. Today, this alcohol, is the first I have had since the day you came, right?"
"Oh no?" Gabriel asks, unconvinced, "Shame, because he has the most beautiful eyes. So green they would be the envy of the brightest tree in heaven."
"What will we put in it?" He asks as Sam gathers random things.
"Please do not teach there, Sam." Castiel says and Sam stops, settling for wrapping a lower feather around in his little hand.
"I am here for you, Dean, please try to keep that in mind." Castiel says before letting out a long suffering sigh.
"As a new couple on our first date, we must make dinner together." The boy says, heading into the kitchen with Castiel following.
The angel shifts awkwardly in his seat when the woman returns with two bottles of beer for them. He mumbles a thank you to her and receives a wink for his efforts. When she leaves he looks back to Dean who is staring him down intensely. "…What is wrong, Dean?"
When they arrive at the house Castiel gets a strange feeling from it, something almost familiar but not quite. The three of them get out of the car and Dean walks right in, Sam in his arms and Castiel following behind with all of Sam's stuff for the night. Immediately a beautiful woman greets them and takes the things from Castiel's hands before she leaves with Dean and Sam to a spare bedroom the boy will be staying in.
"Reincarnation, Castiel. We met in our original forms during that time, but by allowing Gabriel to kill me, god gave me the gift of being reincarnated with her again and again. Each time I lose a little bit more of my power. Gabriel told me that when I lose all of it is when the reincarnations will stop." Benny explains and Castiel furrows his brows.
"Dean's in trouble!" Sam cackles, earning him a dirty look from his older brother who doesn't budge from where Castiel placed him. He expected to be yelled at, to have more of a fight, but as he looks at the young man standing perfectly still he is reminded that Dean is still young. They both are.
The two of them walk the long way to the store, with Dean pointing to places he has fond memories of. There was the spot he learned to ride his bike, along with where he fell off of it and jumped right back on because fuck that bike it wasn't gonna get the best of him. Then there was where he met his first friend, a boy who had long since moved away and whose name escapes him. They go through all of these and to Dean's surprise, Castiel is honestly interested in hearing it all. Perhaps he is imagining it but it seems Castiel actually knows some of these stories already.
"You can eat some too, if you're hungry Dean, but you have to eat at the couch away from us." Sam explains, "Cas is my date tonight, no interfering!"
"So he has to leave in a month…" Dean mutters to himself, surprised at just how much the thought of that hurts. Of course Dean knew Castiel couldn't stay, but there was a part of him that hoped he could keep the angel. Castiel has eased his pain, has eased Sam's pain. In a way, it was as if Castiel had gripped him tight and raised him from perdition. A perdition he put himself in.
He eyes her suspiciously for a moment before nodding, "I suppose you are right. Have a good evening."
"How long does he have?" Dean asks and Gabriel frowns.
"It's a fair fucking question." Dean says, now glaring at Castiel, "I told you, why don't you grow a pair and tell me how you feel?"
The little boy pulls away from Castiel's wings and looks up at him sadly, "Can you wait until tomorrow? You can sleep in here," Sam smiles, pointing to his bed, "With me!"
"They're technically both yours." Sam reminds him grumpily. "Castiel is here for you."
"Oh no, it's nothing. You two should head home, it's a long walk from here right?"
"Um…alright." Castiel pulls a chair up next to the counter, and away from the stove, for Sam. He has learned enough from Dean and Kevin now to be decent with making food, so he pulls out the mincer, setting the blade inside and leaving it unplugged for now in front of Sam. Chopping the onions into wedges, he then hands them to Sam to place in the mincer and close the lid before Castiel plugs it in and the boy can press the button. It doesn't take long before he is cooking the beef and diced onions in a sauce pan.
"Hey, kid," Rufus begins, patting Castiel on the back, "Good job keeping your boyfriend here safe."
Sam smiles at the two, "Yay! It's a date!"
A/N: Sorry, these last few weeks have been full of tests and projects and CAR TROUBLES OMG IT IS A PIECE OF SHIT.
"Took you long enough." Dean teases and Charlie shrugs it off, too excited to care.
"He still seems pretty amiable…" Dean mumbles and Gabriel laughs.
Sam pouts, "They are my stars!"
The three of them stay in their weak fort, where Dean reads to Sam and Castiel, both equally enthralled. Castiel has read the history, and present state, of earth but he has never heard stories of talking toys going on adventures with their human caretaker. He has only been on earth for a few hours, but he already likes it more than he expected. Humans are strange in many ways, but they are admittedly warm and kind people.
"The living room." Sam grumbles, "He'll be in here soon to tuck me in."
"I am?"
"I'm not going to do that, Dean," Castiel stares him down, "It is not enough time and we both know if I continue to come back you will stay as you are now. You cannot continue to rely on me, Dean, you have to manage on your own. No one will hold your hand through this life forever, not even an angel."
"It will take at least two years for college, but you won't be taking a job. Your job is Sam. I will work my schedule around classes." Dean says, getting up off the bed. "I suppose, if you stay as long as I need you to, it can work…"
"My mind is very much still intact." Castiel assures him as he takes the plate and goes to sit next to Sam.
"I am fine, why do you ask?"
Dean heads into the house, tired and annoyed. He's not entirely sure why Castiel insisted on being able to pick up Sam today, but he has noticed the angel avoiding his older brother for a while. Castiel said there was no real reason Gabriel came here, but apparently that was a lie. The tension between the angelic brothers has become ridiculous. Gabriel obviously has something he wants to talk to Castiel about, and the stubborn little brat refuses to listen.
"You seem to already know quite a bit about my childhood, Cas, playing favorites up in heaven?" Dean asks and Castiel looks to him highly offended.
"A vampire!"
"He only calls those he loves little shits." Sam says, quickly earning a disapproving look from both Castiel and Dean.
"Oh shit!" Dean hisses. "Oh Cas, oh shit sun of a bitch what can I do?" He asks, his voice pained, "You're falling apart."
"Will he be okay?" Sam asks and Castiel shrugs.
Kevin smiles at Castiel and holds his hand out, "Kevin Tran, advanced placement."
A/N: Okay, okay, this chapter is shitty and I am sorry. I really am. It's just a wrap up though...so...is that an excuse? Probably not. This is shit and I am horrible for allowing it to pass as the last chapter but this was the best one I came up with soooooooooooooooooooooooooo?
"Babies are capable of speech, too, but it doesn't make it less impressive when they get a word right." Sam points out.
"Show me on puppy-Cassie where the big bad Winchester hurt you." He mocks, motioning towards where the dogs heart it. "I'll give you a hint."
"It is not as if I was incapable…"
"Aahhh, a history nerd. Well, you can stick around the garage today, Dean here will keep you out of trouble." Bobby says, looking to Dean, "Isn't that right?"
When they get to the car, what Dean thinks is out of earshot from his friend, he speaks up. "So what the hell was that all about? Backing him up against a table and then him spewing some line right out of a chick flick?"
"A date?" Dean asks before laughing, a bit forcibly, "The angel got a date?"
"Hey, Cas," Sam begins, not looking up from his paper, "Can you get me some milk?"
The little boy looks up at him wide-eyed, "Let's have a date, too!"
Kevin smiles at him, clearly amused, "Well aren't you just a lucky little angel? Alright then, here's how this works." He comes and sits beside Castiel in front of the tub and turns on the red faucet.
"Can you blame me? It's an awesome car, don't you think?" Dean asks, grinning at him, "Bet you're pretty stoked your first car ride is in my baby."
"For what?"
After a few minutes the vampire sings to the princess and Castiel looks to Sam curiously, "Are these two women in love?"
Castiel takes the knife in hand, feeling his whole body relax at the feel of such a familiar object. It has been a long time since he used one, but there is nothing Castiel understands more than a knife. He stares at the meat beneath him before making quick work of chopping it up perfectly.
"Cas!" Sam screams, dropping his new toy and charging at Dean and Castiel.
"Can Castiel watch me today?" Sam asks and Dean frowns.
"No Cas!" Sam cries, clinging to him, "Why do you have to go? No one said you had to go!"
"I shall come help you." Castiel decides, going to move Sam.
Kevin looks him dead in the eyes. "Advanced. Placement."
"So, um…I'm not going to hell for bringing you here, am I?" Dean asks when they reach the entrance, "I mean…this isn't going to taint you or anything is it?"
"Because of a woman you got to stay? I don't believe that. Whether from heaven or hell we do not simply change because an attractive human cares about us." Castiel hisses, ready to drive the blade through.
"What the hell!" Dean screams from the doorway, quickly running into the kitchen, "Who said you guys could use my stove?" He yells, glaring at Kevin. "Don't drag Castiel into doing bad things!"
A/N: When my niece was like 15 months old she did what Sam did to Cas in order to get a kiss out of me. I'm a highly emotionally stinted person. (Kiss her all the fucking time now though) And I once told someone that you are supposed to end prayers with that little thing about God. Why? Because I'm a massive dick. Sadly a friend of mine corrected it not long after. One more chapter leeefffft. Please excuse the horrible sex, like, I have no excuse, but excuse it anyways.
"Food. We open the door for food."
Castiel shrugs, "Anything for the Winchester boys." He says before leaving the room and joining Sam back at the coffee table.
"Castiel lie down next to me!" Sam says excitedly and Castiel obeys, lying down beside him. "Can you take out your wings?" He asks, looking to Castiel with those brown eyes even he is finding a hard time saying no to. "I made sure it was big enough for them!"
"A try at what?" Castiel asks, making the teacher blush.
The man stand up and pats Castiel on the back, clearing his throat awkwardly, "Only if you promise to never call it that again."
Perhaps it's just true that everyone has a doppelganger out there. Even angels.
"Not helping. Shut it, angel." He warns, and Castiel nods, remaining quiet.
"Ooohhh you won't regret it, kiddo!" She runs back to her car before ushering over a guy who looks alarmingly like Castiel.
Castiel looks at him curiously and goes to inquire as to the meaning of his words when someone interrupts.
"He goes to you when he should come to me." Dean points out.
"So this is the new guy! Says his name is Castiel, sounds pretty angelic huh?" Charlie asks, "I told him this and he said it doesn't, but what does some kid who strips in a Laundromat know?"
Dean takes Cas to work
"Let's do it. No brothers allowed, though." Gabriel suggests, "Ostracize those brats to the outskirts of our fun."
"Fuck, Cas, these wings are sensitive." Dean moans, "I haven't even touched your dick and you're already close to coming." He teases, lightly running his nails through Castiel's feathers to drive him more insane.
"I…um…forgot." Dean says, his eyes staring widely at the ceiling before finally coming to look at Castiel, "You can let go now. I prefer other's legs in the air to my own."
"Aw, how nice of her not to tell anyone! You sure are lucky, Cas! You and Dean were almost outed!" The archangel says between giggles and snorts.
"Like you would even know." Benny teases.
Dean sighs and gets up, grabbing another jack before setting the car up again. Once Rufus and Bobby are out of earshot he begins talking to Castiel, "So, you're a guardian angel now, huh?"
"I told her she was not bound by her past." Castiel explains, still confused as to why she reacted in such a way. "I was simply trying to help her after she was so kind to me."
"He's still in those teen years. His body is only that of someone in his very early twenties. Outside of the hardships of war, he is basically mentally the equivalent of a twenty year old."
"Dean is not my friend, really. We live together and are raising Sam." The angel explains, "It's my job to keep him happy."
"Why are you so unhappy with me?" Castiel frowns, noting the momentary rise of Dean's eyebrows when he does so. "It has only been two weeks, Dean, and I am doing all I can in my power to help you."
It makes him a little sad that Dean has to wear something too tight for him, although many humans choose to wear pants like that he knows it isn't Dean's style. He still looks nice in them, though, and being aesthetically pleasing to others in the main reason humans dress certain ways. If the TV shows on young adults are anything to go by.
"Of course." Castiel stands up, "I'll get Sam ready."
Castiel shoots him a dark look, "That is not funny."
Castiel looks at his reddening face, highly amused at the man's embarrassment, and simply nods. "Your secret is safe with me, Dean."
"What the hell was that?" Dean groans when they finally get out, catching their breath in the alley. "Just what did you do to that poor girl?"
"Anyone can change for love, Castiel." The vampire taunts, "Any form of it."
"No. My brothers and sisters are doing excellently. I am the only one having problems with it that I have been informed of."
"Dean! That was my date! Give him back!" Sam whines from the other side, earning Castiel a dark look from Dean.
"Aren't you sleeping in a blanket fort tonight?"
"That was not my concern. I was wondering…how to make a man happy." He mumbles, causing her to freeze in front of him.
They both fall into a heavy silence, staring at one another. Castiel would answer, honestly he would, but he has no idea how new angels came to be. He has no idea how new anything comes to be. As a warrior you need not worry yourself with reproduction.
"You are by far the most obstinate creature I have met." The angel counters.
Castiel has been living with Dean and Sam for a whole week now, and while he has enjoyed going to the garage with Dean, he is immensely happy that today he gets to stay at the house with Sam. He has learned how to order food for them, since Dean hasn't had the time to properly teach him how to cook and apparently food created with magic tastes awful, and he has learned how to properly keep Sam clean and safe. So today is the big day, the day he proves to Dean he can actually help him.
Castiel thinks for a moment, "This was where you had your first breakup." He answers, looking to Dean confused, "Of all the locations of firsts for you, this one makes the least since for us to visit."
A/N: Ughhhhhh filler? Filler sucks, I know. Got sick, everything sucks. I'm sorry you must put up with my failures!!!!
"Well he's a friendly little guy, huh?" Gabriel asks, looking to Castiel, "Nice to meet you Sam, I'm Cassie's older brother Gabriel."
"Dean you know I do not date." He reminds the man, noticing the tension drop, "My brother Gabriel has come."
"Yes, he is very difficult. I help him raise his brother, have learned some housework, and other things I thought would make him happy…yet he is still as lost as before." Castiel admits, sitting back in his seat. "I do not know what he needs to be happy."
Castiel pales, "His what?"
"I do not…" He begins, horrified at the suggestion. "I would never…he would never…that is not what is going on here."
"You're shorter than me!" The man huffs.
Dean rolls his eyes and lightly nudges Castiel, "No weirder than this one."
"Oh please, what do you even know about kissing? You're purer than a damn choir boy." Dean mocks and Castiel nods.
"Cas, Jo. Jo, Cas." Dean mumbles, leaning over the counter and reaching for a beer. He cannot get it, though, because Jo quickly grabs his hand, squeezing it far too tightly.
"Well hello there, Dean." Gabriel calls, carrying Sam downstairs, "How nice to meet the man my brother has been living with."
Castiel frowns, quickly leaving Sam and Gabriel to see Dean. "Um…Dean…I have something to tell you…we have a visitor…"
"Not now." Dean groans, getting back to work as well.
"Damnit, Cas and I are not a couple!" Dean groans, "Go back to heaven for fucks sake."
