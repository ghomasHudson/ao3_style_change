“Not exactly. This symbol was used in a number of different rituals. Yes, marriage was the most common at first, but then it spread to kinship and even servitude.” Cas handed the paper back to Sam, the edges of his mouth downturned.
The hunter pushed Cas backwards until he was pinned against the countertop, his legs spreading slightly so that Dean could slot between them. He was very pleased to find that Cas shared his enthusiasm for their kisses as he pressed his hips a little harder against the former angel and received an equally frantic grind back.
"That's pretty nice timing, Cas" Dean rasps, visibly relieved to see his friend, instead of Zachariah's terrifying face.
“Yeah, you’re right. Something just doesn’t sit right with this case.” Dean muttered, sitting on the remaining bed and untying his shoes. He sat there for a while, his elbows resting on his knees staring at the laces of his shoes. “Those marks didn’t look written on, they were
After a nice shower and shave, he decides to check his phone again. Towel wrapped around his neck he picks up the device and scans through it. He saw he had a missed call from Charlie. She used to be his manager before Garth came along but she quit to pursue her dream of managing a genuine role play product company. In his opinion she was the brains behind the entire operation though the business didn't belong to her, yet.
Cas tries his best to keep calm, even though his heart wants to leap out of his chest. “I said that months ago. I didn’t think you would remember.” A smile creeps up on the angel, and he accepts Dean’s invitation to sit on the blanket with him. They settle in, sharing the soft sound of the waves licking at the trees on the shore. The sun is still a little too high on the horizon, but neither of them minds the wait.
“You need to use my blood. Only you can kill her, Dean.” Cas deadpans without further explanation. Sam and Dean share a look before turning back to their friend, concern evident on their features.
The hunters took advantage of the respite to lunge at the spirit’s form. Dean and Sam charged at her with their knives, but the spirit vanished from view. She reappeared behind them and pulled Sam back by his long hair throwing him to the floor. He swung his knife wildly ahead of him, trying to cut her on the way down. His knife managed to connect with her side, but simply went through her like she was made of air. She crawled over Sam’s form and raised her arms above her head. Sam closed his eyes and braced for impact, but before he could feel anything he heard a shrill scream. Dean had slashed at the monster’s arms and managed to cut deep into one of her arms. The cut leaked a glowing substance instead of blood, and she tried to stop the bleeding with her remaining hand. Dean paused to stare at the bloody knife in his hand. It was covered in a dark substance that he recognized as Cas’s blood from the night before, but now the tip was tinged with the same glowing liquid coming from the spirit’s arm. His eyes met his brother’s and his shock confirmed his suspicion.
“Good morning Dean.” He whispers through a soft smile. His voice sends shivers down Dean’s spine. Shivers he would much rather ignore.
Sam could barely contain his laughter as he saw the situation his antics had gotten his brother into. “You, uh, need me to get a knife or something?” he managed to ask through his wails.
Dean blushed profusely under the scrutiny of his brother and son. He cleared his throat, “Yeah there was something wrong with the hot water, but uh-” he chances a glance in the angel’s direction, but couldn’t meet his eyes. “Uh, Cas fixed it though.” Jack nodded, seemingly satisfied with the hunter’s answer, and shared an unreadable look with Sam. A small grin appeared on the nephilims’s features.
“Alright-” Sam began to spare his brother and brother-in-law, “There are definitely some things we need to talk about.” He turned to face the angel and pointed at his left arm. “Cas, do you know what the weird symbols on your skin mean?”
Cas propped himself up with his arms slowly, as Jack steadied him. The boy sighed in relief when he felt Cas’s heartbeat. The first word out of Cas’s mouth was the one that always came easily to him: “Dean.”
Jack sits opposite his father, cradling the pajamas in his lap. “When was the last time?” He is staring at his lap, pensive. “The last time he was happy with someone?”
"So, the real reason I have gathered you here today," Zachariah continued "–is to ask for your help. We will need soldiers and a leader strong enough to go into Hell, extract the asset and bring him back to us. As soon as he is back on Earth, we can proceed to communicate our intent. So, do we have any volunteers for this mission?"
Cas reached to take the hunter’s hand underneath the table, and it made Dean jump out of his reverie. He turned to look at the former angel and then down at their joined hands. He hesitated for a moment, simply staring at their clasped hands. Cas felt the familiar rumble of nervousness settle in his gut, but it was washed away by pure happiness when he felt Dean squeeze his hand back. The hunter looked up to meet his eyes and his small smile widened and brightened his face. Cas returned the smile, along with a small squeeze of his hand and the warmth within him blossomed even more.
Castiel nodded and licked his lips. ‘I’m in love with a mermaid, and a mermaid’s in love with me. My life’s a fairy tale,’ he said numbly.
Gabriel stepped up the table and snapped his fingers. About half of the lines shifted in color. ‘So, red halls are demon-friendly, blue is angel-friendly, green means everyone, and yellow is for humans-only,’ he explained.
Sam began gathering up the dirty dishes, but stopped as Bobby took them from him and nodded his head to the door leading to the lobby. He turned and found Gabriel lingering in the half-open doorway. He smiled as Gabriel gave him an embarrassed smile and a shrug.
‘No, it’s not,’ Dean wailed miserably. ‘Fuck. We shouldn’t have changed it yet. Not without saying anything.’
He opened his notebook and wrote out his small discovery in his makeshift shorthand, as well as a reminder to interrogate Dean. He pulled down his pants and wrote a reminder to check his notebook on his inner thigh. He didn’t want to run the risk of Crowley or Balthazar finding out. Not when he and Gabriel were the only ones that knew about the photograph.
Gabriel looked around. He tried to extend his senses, but with some of the dampening spell still intact, he could only locate Bobby on the floor below them. At least, he assumed it was Bobby since there were two angels and a demon with the human. He shrugged in response. ‘I can’t tell,’ he replied, sharing in Sam’s worry. ‘You don’t think he went after Cas, do you? It’s too dangerous!’
Gabriel grumbled as there was a knock on the door. ‘No…stay…ignore it,’ he mumbled as Sam wiggled out from beneath him. He heard Samandriel’s voice and groaned as he pulled a pillow over his head. ‘Lemme alone!’
Sam entered his room and found Gabriel sitting on the window sill with his legs hanging outside the window. ‘Hey…um…’ He stopped himself before he asked what was wrong. ‘I don’t wanna pry,’ he said, ‘but…I’m here if you wanna talk about it.’
‘C’mon, let’s see what we can get away with on TV. And what it takes to make Gabriel uncomfortable,’ Castiel said as he turned his back to Balthazar.
After four more takes, one where a gust of wind blew Gabriel’s hair into his face, Charlie deemed them ready to move on to the next scene.
'Goodbye, Dean. I will return when I have time,' Castiel promised. Before flying off, he tenderly stroked Dean’s Grace and felt the small bursts of elation and worry.
me!’ Castiel cried out, gesturing at Dean and his long tail. ‘How could you do this to me?! I thought we were
Crowley sucked in a breath. He hadn’t been counting on Bobby being smarter than he looked. These Hunters were too full of surprises. He turned and quickly left the room, not knowing what else he could do. He passed Meg in the hallway, looking entirely too smug for her own good. He grabbed her arm and narrowed his eyes at her.
‘I just said you thought with your cock. But…you kinda are one,’ Balthazar replied. ‘Now don’t get me wrong. That can be hot. But…not when you’re pretending to be something you’re not.’
‘Easier to animate, I’m sure…,’ Castiel said distractedly as he pulled up another search. ‘And this…’ He slammed the laptop shut and tapped his fingers on top. ‘How do you feel about drag shows?’
Castiel reluctantly looked up. ‘I…I would…’ He swallowed and bit his lip. ‘I would like to stay with Dean. If he…if everyone understands what it means…the threat…then…yes. I want to stay.’
Dean felt conflicted. On one hand, Castiel hadn’t seen him strip. On the other…Castiel hadn’t seen him strip. ‘Huh.’
‘Okay. I have no idea who that is, but congratulations on winning!’ Dean said and kissed Castiel’s cheek.
‘C-Cas… It’s okay,’ Dean whispered. He closed his eyes and leaned into Castiel’s touch. ‘I love you, Castiel. Please. Don’t fight it. It’s okay.’
Gabriel gave Castiel a pathetic look before cautiously raising the phone to his ear. He held it slightly away as he spoke. 'Dad! How's it hangin'?' He waited, looking up at the ceiling as the voice on the other end threatened to burst the phone's speaker. 'Wait, wait!
Dean rolled his eyes. ‘Well, if you’re not against it, let’s get drunk. It’ll be fun. The more ridiculous the movies get, the more drunk we’ll be.’
Gabriel nodded, burying his face in Sam’s chest. ‘Dad was real interested in them after we found out about Cas’s wings… He uh…he got really pissed off when he found out
Sam nodded before turning back to the rest of the group. He knew there were plenty of merfolk that left their colony, but he had always assumed they had simply moved to a different one. Seeing Charlie made him wonder just how many of them were on land masquerading as human. As the rest of the crew made their way down the hall, Sam’s eyes followed Gabriel, his eyes slowly drifting down. He finally understood Karen’s crush. Seeing the man in person definitely swayed his interest. He gave Karen a smile as he entered the lobby.
‘Won’t say a word,’ Balthazar said quietly as he walked past Gabriel. He brushed against Castiel and couldn’t help taking a deep breath, catching a whiff of the lingering scent of Castiel’s soap. Four years, and he still used the same soap.
Gabriel grinned as he hopped onto Sam’s bed to pull his pants off. ‘Stop worrying about them!’ he whined as he tossed his clothing into the corner.
‘Well… She has uh…’ Dean rubbed his neck as his face scrunched up in thought. Charlie had a spotted tail. Her real name translated to ‘beautiful spots dancing in the sea.’ ‘Spot’ made more sense than the mouthful that her name really was. Much like how Charlie referred to him as ‘Freckles.’ ‘Spot, er…Charlie has…’ He looked around the lobby, and his eyes landed on Sam. He silently pleaded for help.
Dean slumped forward a little. ‘Tell me about it!’ He jabbed at the potato a little more harshly than he should have. ‘And there’s almost no information on it, either! I had to dissect the damn spells myself. I can’t believe no one’s ever tried changing it before.’
‘And now Crowley’s going to cut you open with a pen knife and drink your blood!’ Castiel wailed helplessly into his hands. He stared at the top of Dean’s head, hovering just over his thigh. ‘I never got to cook for you… You never got to insult my cooking, and now you’re gonna be too dead to taste it,’ he said quietly.
‘Oh, yeah. Dean. Sam’s brother,’ Gabriel said with a smile. ‘Sam’s pissed that he’s here. I intend to comfort him.’
Castiel frowned and glanced at his wings. They were a beautiful white, a far cry from the normal black. ‘I’m dreaming,’ he said before facing the angel again.
brother?’ Gabriel countered, pulling up to his full height, which, when compared to Dean, wasn’t very much.
Surprisingly, he didn’t feel as awful as he probably should. He was tricked into signing on for another season. He was just laid off due to ‘budgeting constraints.’ And yet, he felt pretty good. He sat up and stared at his lap, wondering if Gabriel had somehow slipped him something. He wouldn’t put it past his brother.
‘But you’re not a time bomb waiting to go off,’ Gabriel muttered. He stiffened when he realized he had said it aloud.
Gabriel gasped and watched, transfixed, as Sam pulled his hand toward his mouth. He didn’t breath, afraid he would startle Sam. A soft moan escaped his lips as Sam slowly licked his finger. He had to get up and move around the table as Sam pulled him closer. His breath came in short rasps as Sam pulled him onto his lap. His voice waivered as he tried to speak. ‘S-Sam…?’
Dean pulled himself onto the deck of Benny’s boat. He was so excited that he had hardly slept the night before. ‘Did you bring them?’ he asked as he curled his tail around himself. His stomach was full of butterflies as the tip of his tail left the water.
Dean stared at him a good while before choosing to ignore him in favor of Bobby. Once he was certain of Bobby's wellbeing, he turned his attention on Castiel.
Dean stopped short of the door and faced Sam. He contemplated not telling Sam some of what was going on, but… Sam needed to know. To understand just how bad the demon blood was. He sighed heavily and looked away.
‘Yes, yes. And instead of a life spent running, a minor operation was the better option,’ Crowley finished.
‘Uh-huh.’ Charlie shifted her gaze to Sam as he joined Gabriel on the boat. She caught Sam’s eye and raised her brows in question. She let out a long breath when Sam gave her a slight nod. ‘Well… Good luck, you two,’ she said. She waved as Gabriel started the engine. ‘You’re gonna need it,’ she added under breath. She reassured herself that hitting Gabriel over the head with proof of mermaids was the best way.
Castiel pulled his hand away and clutched his left wrist, shaking his head. ‘No! It’s fine like this! Don’t feel the need to waste any of the blanks.’ He flinched when Dean cupped his cheek.
Gabriel forced a smile and nodded, having no idea what Castiel was on about. He didn’t know if it would be better for Castiel to crash now or later. He decided on later—after
Gabriel frowned, keeping a close eye on Sam’s arms. ‘Yes, well…pictures.’ He picked up his beer and took a long swig. If Dean was collecting photos of Castiel, then it couldn’t be
Benny tried to look away, but couldn’t. As Dean’s tail shrank, it began to resemble human legs. Soon, every last scale had faded, and Dean was left panting, hugging his new legs as tightly as possible. Carefully, Benny touched Dean’s shoulder, causing him to jump. ‘Hey… It’s okay… Just me.’
‘Uh…’ Samandriel flipped through his planner. ‘Well, we have the boat for the whole time we’re here, so…whenever’s good for you.’
It was just like home. Gabriel off somewhere else, and everyone ignoring him or telling him everything was
to be. That had to be the key. Like that stupid Tom Hanks movie. No wonder Sam had such lame excuses for not wanting to take a shower with him. Why didn’t Charlie tell him? Actually
Gabriel crossed his arms and frowned at Dean. His head tilted as he took in the little details. Mussed hair, swollen lips, blood seeping through the bandages on his hands, hospital gown bunched around his hips… He turned wide eyes to Castiel and looked over the man he thought of as a brother. There was a smudge of red on the lapel of Castiel’s over coat.
Then Sam noticed small things going missing, turning up in strange places. He found his wallet in the back of the freezer multiple times. His clothes were being found in the glove compartments of the junkers littering Bobby's property. He had no idea where his soap ended up.
time,’ Gabriel said with a small huff. He closed his eyes and drifted to sleep with Sam’s fingers still gently lacing through his hair.
Dean buried his face in his arms as he groaned. ‘It was an accident! At least I never swam head first into a…a…those underwater boats.’
Gabriel shook his finger. ‘Stop that! I know how your mind works.’ He grabbed Castiel by the shoulders and forced him into a chair sitting next to the hospital bed. ‘Now! You be a good little angel and keep an eye on him. If you try to leave, I’ll knock you out and tie you to this chair.’
The first variation of Castiel’s new binding cuff was a dud. On paper, everything looked right. None of the spells contradicted each other, and it accounted for his demon side. The second one itched like crazy. When Gabriel was given a similar one, he complained of hot flashes.
Benny looked from the scales to the camera in Castiel’s other hand. ‘I’ll answer what I can, but…not on camera,’ he said.
Gabriel nodded. It was probably true. He was prepared to find a sea monster. Not find out that his boyfriend was a merman. ‘So, what now?’
Gabriel broke the kiss and panted as he slowed his movements. He gasped and moaned each time Sam’s cock pushed into him. ‘Fuck, Sam… Ah! Wanna…wanna take you with me,’ he said as he kissed at Sam’s chest. ‘Please come with me.’ He groaned as Sam stopped moving. He looked up and caught Sam’s worried expression, and placed his hands on Sam’s cheeks, smiling reassuringly. ‘Sorry! It’s okay! Just rattling off stupid crap. You don’t have to answer. I like to talk during sex. You know that!’
Castiel reached the dock where the ferry to the Four Seasons regularly stopped. He sat on a bench and waited as he mulled over his possible options.
Dean looked out the window and ran his hand along the worn steering wheel. ‘It’s not your fault. I’ll get back on track again…’
‘I’m…for the middle of the ocean, myself,’ Dean said quietly. He couldn’t help the blush that surfaced as Jody’s grin widened. ‘Er… Not that it matters.’
Balthazar grimaced and shook his head. ‘Well, that was a little better than I was expecting, to tell the truth…’ He looked up at Sam’s flabbergasted expression. ‘You owe me. He
‘But I already put on some Neosporin,’ Castiel argued as Dean took the bag back. He chewed on his lip as Dean climbed onto the bed and settle behind him.
Castiel stood on the porch for a few minutes, examining his surroundings. Everything looked fine. He stepped through the doorway and frowned. Everything
Karen watched as Castiel stumbled out the kitchen door into the backyard, whimpering. As soon as the door shut she turned and made her way to the study. ‘Something’s wrong with Castiel,’ she said to the small group that was gathered.
‘In exchange for dinner,’ Balthazar replied. ‘Let me right this, Cas. There’s still something there. I can’t fix what happened, but…let me try to make it better?’
Before him, about 5 rows in front, was the golden stage on which the Council now stood, or at least they would if they were not currently represented by giant statues of marble and gold. The walls and high ceiling of the room looked just as he remembered them from the last time he was here. The other stone statues and velvet curtains stood proudly around the Hall, much like the angels who now housed it.Thinking back, it had been fairly recently, about 100 years.
That was the tipping point for Dean. Eleven years they had spent skirting around each other. Eleven years of finding a way back to each other again, of
Dean snorted before grabbing hold of the angel’s outstretched hand. “Never change, Cas. Never change.”
In the mist of his panic, Castiel remembered the archangel's words. He turned towards him, a new kind of drive illuminating his eyes,. He wouldn't be afraid anymore, that had gotten him nowhere in life. "What's my mission?"
The angel pulled back his fingers and Dean whimpered at the loss. Cas reached for the condoms that had been left behind where the lube used to be and started to open one. Dean stopped him and took it from him, resolute on placing the condom on his angel’s cock himself.
Cas tensed, wishing he had his angel blade, anything to defend himself. He wanted to run, he never wanted to see this monster again. But, there had to be another way, another deal, a way out. If not, the entity would have fulfilled that wish of killing him already. Cas told It as much.
“Why not? What good is my power, my station, if it doesn’t allow me to choose who to have by my side?” Cas meets Dean’s eyes once more, the brilliant blue shining with unshed tears.
After his training Dean was feeling great. The adrenaline was still running though him like an after shock and he would deny if anyone said he purred as he got behind the wheel of his Baby. A jet black Chevy Impala '67 that shone as he drove down the road. Rock music blasting on the speakers and the smell of leather inside the car made Dean feel at home.
Cas stood still for the first time since he was dumped into this abyss. He held his hands out until they touched the oozing black walls that surrounded him. The walls were electric to the touch, yet fluid enough that he could run his hands through them. He felt small sparks everywhere he touched, almost as if he was touching pure energy. Pure... grace? The sparks burned him the closer his body got to the walls. Black goo stuck to his arms as he drew them back, startled, and then slowly fizzled away as he shook them.
“I don’t even know where to begin” the angel finally settled on before turning to walk towards the tree stump. Dean scrambled to follow the angel, trying to keep up with his brutal pace.
However, the decision was made for him when the stranger-a tall, slender man sporting a black V-neck and a smirk- wrapped an arm around him and pulled him towards a booth in the back of the bar.
being gone is tough, but you can’t carry on like this Dean,” Sam continued as he finished securing the gauze. He got up and sat next to his brother on the bed.
“We have known each other for a decade. We have survived Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory together. Yet, you still insist on your precious personal space.” Every word resonated through the mattress and found its way to Dean.
“Of course,” Cas responds without hesitation and goes through. After walking a little further, they come to a small clearing away from the rest of the crowd. The trees form a thin canopy that keeps the clearing in a cool shade. The shore is right in front of them now, and Cas walks towards it and dips his hand in the water. “Why are we here, Dean?”
Jack stood by the car, looking at his dad as Dean made his way to the bunker door and completely ignored what he had tried to tell him. This was going to be a long night.
Still, for the briefest moment, Cas had felt the pain stop. He knew he did, and that could only mean one thing. Angels were not powerless in the Empty. He wasn’t powerless here. The pain he was feeling wasn’t something out of his control. If he had no physical self here, why could he still feel pain? He shouldn't be able to, he reasoned. The entity was
Sam gives their son a warm smile and gently places a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “I think that sounds like a great idea.” He turns to face his brother and looks at him expectantly. Dean nods and reaches in his own bag to pull out a map of the forest. They had always been good at anticipating what the other needed. One of the perks of living life on the road together for over 30 years.
Castiel left the bar and decided to take a walk while he slowly opened the envelope. Inside he found two names, two pictures and a small description of one of the targets. He assumed this meant he had to track down this "Dean Winchester" first and then make him ready to connect with a "Lisa Braeden"
“I recognize this Weeping Woman lore.” Cas interrupts, adding air quotes. “She is normally a very powerful, vengeful ghost. She would often cause trouble for our reapers by taking children that weren’t hers. However, I have never seen one use mind-control before?”
“I don’t think you came to the kitchen just to wash some dishes.” Cas stated, his voice barely above a whisper as he got closer to the hunter.
Dean nodded "Alright, sounds fun let's see what good old Jimmy has to say?" He grinned and leaned his legs on the desk in front of him, making Charlie frown playfully and push them off again.
The entity sighed, returning to its normal size. “Tragic part about that, Cassie, is that you are right,” It walked behind the angel to where a makeshift throne had materialized out of thin air. It sprawled across the throne, its legs draping off the side, making it look more like some ice cream which had melted over a chair, than a fearsome celestial being.
“I know that I am an angel ornament. I have all the power I could ever want or need. But my station at the top is incredibly lonely, Dean.” The angel’s eyes settle in his lap, apparently unable to meet his friend’s eyes anymore. “The only moments that brought me some semblance of true happiness, were the ones when I caught a glimpse of you down below.”
. A scream tore out of his throat as he shot his grace out of his form and draped it around himself like he would have done with his wings so long ago.
Cas opens his mouth as if to speak, but hesitates. Eventually, he gives in. “I saw an advertisement for a ‘
Dean rolled into the hotel’s parking lot with the radio blasting some local rock station. He slowly positioned the car into the parking space and sat there for a second after the engine sputtered off. The entire car had filled up with the tantalizing, sweet smell of Mirna’s
“You haven’t Dean. It’s just-” The angel chances a glance towards the hunter and shrugs. “Ever since we got Jack back, everything we went through- everything I went through- helped me realize some things about myself. Things I hadn’t fully understood for years.”
Dean shrugged and nodded. “Yeah, we probably should I guess.” Then he paused and stole a brief glance at Cas before adding “But, man I stink, so let me shower first and then we can do your whole pow-wow moment.” He didn’t meet the angel's eyes and simply opened their room door. Cas nodded in Sam’s direction and gave a soft smile to reassure his son before following the hunter.
Cas’s smile reached from ear to ear. “I love you, Dean. Now and always.” Dean hummed contently, as he settled against his lover’s chest. They had to take a proper shower before going to talk to their family as they had promised. But for now? For now, Dean was in Cas’s arms, and he was finally, truly happy. No strings attached.
"Castiel! Where are you? The meeting in the Hall is about to start! The council is getting restless, please hurry!"
A deep frown littered Jack’s face, the effort it took to stay calm evident on his features, “The Empty had said that It would only come once Cas had finally allowed himself to be... happy.”
He stood over Castiel’s rumpled form, taking in the details of the angel’s features up close for the very first time. He had a strong, stubbled jaw and brunette hair that Dean’s fingers itched to run through. His tan coat had fanned out around him, giving him the illusion of wings. He was beautiful. As if sensing his presence, Castiel woke up and focused two brilliantly blue eyes on Dean’s face.
"I know we won. I’m glad, but I have no place here on Earth. I am an angel," Cas tried, begging the universe that  they would understand why he needed to do this.
“Are we there yet?” Jack asked cheerfully. He didn’t take his eyes off the window and had his nose nearly pressed to the glass.
”, the entity claimed with disgust. It looked at Cas as if he was sizing him up. “Perhaps, there is something very human inside you already. Maybe that is why you are so insufferably hard to get rid of.”
Dean quickly made his way to the angel and held him in his arms, fearing the panic that had set on his face. “Cas, baby. I don’t mean no to everything, just no to the shower.” He tried to get the angel to meet his eyes as he stumbled through his words. “I mean, it's not that I don’t wanna see you naked, cause trust me I am dying to, but I know I won’t stop and I want the first time to be special and not just a quick thing, cause-” The angel stopped the hunter’s litany of words with a deep kiss. Relief sunk in Dean’s shoulders, the fear that he had messed up melting away with every touch of Cas’s lips.
“Cas? Soup’s on!” Dean yelled through a frown. He turned to Sam, worry evident in his face. Sam stopped him before he could voice the question that was plastered all over his face.
Some angels grimaced at the thought of such an awful place, while others just stared ahead, boredom evident in their faces. A couple rows ahead of him he saw Raphael. Though he normally didn't pay much attention to these meetings, Castiel noted that he was sitting at the edge of his seat, seemingly enraptured by Zachariah's report. Hannah's face betrayed nothing, but he knew how she felt about Hell, and decided it was best not to question her.
“Alright, well. We are going to continue to canvas the area. If there are any new leads, you let us know?” Dean adds as he gives Edgar his business card. The detective looks at it and shakes his hand.
"I'll do it" Castiel's voice rang across the room as everyone else became quiet. He made his way out of his seat, walking slowly to report in front of Zachariah. He looked the other angel in the eye and spoke.
Everyone but Cas seemed to have moved on from the incredible admission Dean had just made. Or well, more accurately the assumption he had failed to correct. He mulled the words Castiel Winchester in his head over, and over.
The next morning, on the way to the airport, Dean kept his promise. As he drove up to the familiar little coffee shop, he drummed his fingers against the wheel and whistled softly along to the song on the radio before turning it off.
“I was getting us our drinks,” Cas interrupted as he came into the war room holding two ice-cold six packs of beer in his hands. A smile slowly grew on the angel’s face before he gestured towards the pizza on the table.
The realization hit him like a freight train at full speed. In a second, their entire friendship flashed through his mind.
“Maybe Sam and I can keep researching possible monsters, while you and Cas go out around where the children disappeared and try to lure it out?” Jack asked the table, unsure of how they would react.
Exasperated, Zachariah continued, "Well, if no one is going to volunteer we will go on to the Choosing cere-"
Sam’s words finally cut through the tension between Cas and Dean, making the strand of cheese droop slowly towards the table. Dean caught it in mid-air and ate the rest of it himself. His cheeks had turned a delightfully pink color that Cas was immediately drawn to. A sudden silence went over the room, leaving all four men slightly lost in their own thoughts.
A little while later, Mirna came out from behind the counter with a tray full of their orders and started walking towards them. She set the huge tray of food on the empty table next to them as she started to distribute their orders
“Well, he is still an angel, Dean, but he is way stronger than you give him credit for. You should have seen him fight for me in that abandoned church!” Jack replied. Yet, even as he smiled at the fond memory, he remembered what Sam had said to him a couple weeks after he was back. He had asked him exactly the same question Dean had now, only Sam had already known the true answer. Jack paused, unsure if he should confess what he knew to Dean. Some forbidden knowledge that he was certain not even Dean himself quite knew yet. From the corner of his eye he saw Dean’s worried face and decided he couldn’t keep quiet. He had to at least try.
Dean’s heart flutters dangerously, his expression disbelieving. “You know I’m not allowed up there, Cas.”
As Dean got over being rudely interrupted he decided he should probably be heading to the party so he got his car keys and drove.
“I don’t think button-downs will work in a slippery cave. So just, borrow some of my shit.” Dean grumbled, his face reddening a little more with each word. For a moment it seemed like Dean’s people skills were a little rusty too. Cas’s face shone with a vibrant smile, and Dean couldn’t help but roll his eyes at his reaction. Still, the angel could see the hint of a grin on his friend’s face, and the warmth in his chest spread through his entire body...
Dean turns to face the angel, his arms crossed in front of his chest. “Oh yeah, Cas? Enlighten me, cause right now I’m about to go and-”
Castiel saw Dean, felt his longing calling out to him, and dragged him back from the dark reality Zachariah had sent him to. The false future that he claimed was the inevitable result of Dean’s continued resistance.
“We want to let her rest. But, she is the only one that can help us catch whoever did this.” Sam lowered his voice, trying to be as gentle as possible. “Please, ma’am.”
Cas hesitated, his eyes fixating on a dirty spot on the kitchen floor. He rubbed at it with his shoe absentmindedly, as he mulled his words over carefully in his head.
Cas gave the entity his best approximation of a deadly smile, one he had learned from Sam. “And I thought you were done trying to control me, I suppose neither of us is getting what we want”.
“Common Cas, like right now! When have you ever willingly put space between us?” Dean demands, one brow raised. He turns to face his friend fully, sunset temporarily forgotten. The angel keeps staring at the horizon in silence.
“Heh, yeah didn’t want Sammy to start naggin’ me again” Dean chuckled nervously, his hands washing the plate in a steady circle over and over again. A small smile appeared on Cas’s face as he came up to join Dean at the sink.
His heart was racing for reasons still foreign to him. It was beating even faster than when he stared into his angelic best friend's eyes. Dean had come to the bone-chilling realization that he was bisexual about 9 years back. Back when a certain attractive male siren named Nick had sauntered into his life and turned it upside-down. But those feelings, the ones he had kept repressed for his entire life, had never been directed so fervently to someone he truly knew. Definitely never towards Cas. Right?
Cas noticed the shift and used his hands to bring Dean’s gaze back to his. He stared into his lover’s eyes for a moment before placing a soft kiss on his forehead. He stayed there, whispering his next words against his hunter’s skin: “Every sacrifice I’ve ever made will always be worth it Dean,” He met his eyes again, an earnest expression on his face, “Every single choice led me here, to
Cas rolled his eyes, starting to pace slowly away from It, trying to see if he could find an exit. “You are not exactly a ‘peach’ to be around either” Cas replied with air quotes for added sarcasm. He hesitated, standing still before adding, “and that thing you say is wrong with me, it's my humanity... It's the part I love most”.
“Yo buddy, watch where you’re going!” He hollers at the young man that shouldered past him, in a hurry for no apparent reason. Fucking teenagers, man. He bends over to pick up his keys, muttering under his breath. Sometimes he wishes teenagers were more like Jack, sweet and not fucking running everywhere. Then again, Jack flies a lot, so. Yeah, maybe it's best that teenagers don't have power-ups.
Sam gave a small chuckle before he approached his brother and friend and wrapped them both into a group hug that Jack jumped into at the last minute. Cas was surrounded by his family, down to every last inch of his now human body. For the first time in eons, he dared to allow himself the true, unbridled happiness he had always longed for. This time, that happiness truly came with no strings attached, which made his newfound freedom that much sweeter.
Castiel nearly fell off his chair, his soul was altered? He didnt necessarily feel too different though he had a better vision than he had in years and he felt somewhat.. Stronger? But he thought it was because of his new "vessel" as Gabriel called it not his soul. Still he steeled himself and looked at Gabriel in the eye. "What did you do?"
Cas stared at Dean’s smiling face, his confusion at the outburst began to slowly be replaced by a new, unfamiliar warmth blooming in the center of his chest. He liked making Dean laugh.
Sam releases the breath he was holding, eager to change the subject. This was not a conversation they needed to have today. “Okay. Why are you asking me all of this, Jack?”
“Hi there Maria. My name is Cas and that’s my partner Sam.” The angel’s voice is soft, and he is slightly hunched over. Watching him, Sam understands what he is doing. With the way he is sitting, he is making himself vulnerable, less threatening.
“Yo, buddy. Sorry, I didn’t realize that it was a touchy subject. No need to get your feathers in a twist.” The moment the words came out of Dean’s mouth, he regretted them. Castiel’s stony gaze only made him regret it further and murmur a soft ‘sorry’ once more.
“Well, it’s a bonding spell, right? Could be a witch or a siren?” Dean pitched in, closing yet another useless book.
, it’s a real favorite around here.” The kind woman wagged her finger at Dean like she was telling him off. She bent down to reach for the turnover-like pastries he had been staring at and put a couple in a white cardboard box. She looked up at him expectantly.
Balthazar's smirk only widened. Castiel has begun to think this is a normal thing among Angels. Something which makes them oddly.. Human. "Darling you can't be serious. I'm sure Gabriel explained to you that you will be taking the harder jobs yes? Why do you think they are harder?"
Sam chuckled as he stared amusedly at his brother’s slowly reddening face. Dean sputtered and coughed as he tried to recollect what was left of his heart that was pounding against his chest. They had kissed the night Cas disappeared and again now, but
“Well that worked out well for you, didn’t it.” Cas quipped, trying to stifle his enjoyment at being the source of the entity’s distress.
“So, what's the plan for today?” Dean swallowed around a mouthful of his breakfast. He looked around for somewhere to sit but settled for gesturing to Cas to move over so he can sit next to him.
Cas was human once again. More importantly, Cas was finally free. The weight he had felt over his entire being for so long, was finally lifted. There was no reason to hide, no more secrets between him and the Winchesters. He no longer owed anything to anyone and by Chuck, Castiel was truly free for the first time in his life.
After that kiss, Dean didn’t know how he was supposed to separate himself from Cas. He wanted to be near him every second for the rest of his life. The thought made his heart race. Yet, common sense told him he needed to take a shower. Fighting cave monsters isn’t exactly a rosy affair. He needed to face the facts: he stank.
Sam’s brow furrows, and then smoothes out. Oh. That’s what this is about. “I think-” A small smile spread across Sam’s face, he looks at his hands in his lap. “I think he still is. I think there’s someone in his life right now that makes him truly happy, but-”
Dean Winchester was nothing like Zachariah had made him up to be. In Heaven, everyone fiercely believed Dean was their ticket to saving the world, but nothing more than that. Castiel, however, knew the truth. As he stood there in that barn, exploring the human's equipment, guns, books, he saw Dean's true potential, he saw the pureness of his soul, his righteousness. Castiel knew that Heaven would change him, being different was never something they celebrated. His entire being was telling him to help Dean, save him from what was to come, but he did not listen. For disobeying orders meant showing Free Will, a crime punishable by death. Still, he did as he was told, he followed orders.
"It just isn't that simple," Zachariah explained. "It seems some strange force, possibly even our own father, has taken a shining to these humans. Whenever they die, they simply just come back."
The rustling of the lower branches intensifies, the other ornaments are gaining on them. Cries of confusion and outrage are starting to be heard from below. “They aren’t going to be happy about this once they reach us, Cas.”
They had fought tooth and nail to get here. To their happy ending, their curtain drop, their peaceful retirement. Even as Dean placed Cas back on the ground and led him by the hand all the way back to Cas’s room, he found himself thinking of everything they had gone through together. Every fight, death, apocalypse, and betrayal that should have separated them forever, only found a way to bring them closer than before. As the door to his bedroom shuts and Cas makes his way towards the bed, Dean counts himself lucky. Not every hunter gets a good ending, yet here he was. The righteous man that never thought he deserved to be saved, making his way to praise at the altar of the angel that had pulled him out of Hell several lifetimes ago.
“Yeah, well you are the only one of us fluent in Spanish. So, if anyone can understand the kids it’s you Cas. Just-” He takes one glance at the angel sitting next to him and meets his eyes. “Just take it slowly, don’t try to force anything out of her.”
Castiel still found it difficult to believe how careless he had been earlier.  Had it not been for his sister Hannah, he would have been locked out from this meeting with his superiors. The other angels would have shunned him for such carelessness. Angels did not take kindly to disobedience or indolence, and you could be sure they noticed when it occurred.
"That's a nice compliment, but I am afraid not." Cas said through a soft smile, small creases appearing in the corners of his eyes.
The Winchesters were the highlights of his life, and that would never change. Yet, it was time he let them live on. If he stayed, he would only drag them into more issues and problems that they didn't deserve.
“This shouldn’t be possible” It muttered to itself, its hands fidgeting at its side, “I dropped you into the farthest depths of this wretched place.”
“No, she wasn’t physically at the ice cream establishment. She was using the bathroom faucet to communicate. Her voice sounded almost like painful wails to me, but it seemed to put the children in a trance-like state.” Cas supplies, pointedly looking at Dean as if asking for his corroboration.
’ on TV and thought that the M.O. seemed similar to our case. I decided to see if it was based on any actual legends. Turns out, I was right.” He flips through the tabs in his computer excitedly, showing them the different legends he had found.
“Like what you see?” The angel teased, mirth shining in his eyes. Dean nodded and swallowed hard as he made his way slowly to the bed. Cas rose up to meet him, sitting by the edge of the bed as Dean stood directly in front of him. The angel reached up to caress Dean’s naked skin and intense shivers of pleasure shot straight through his spine. Slowly, Cas took the towel that was barely hanging on Dean’s hips and pulled it loose, letting it fall to the floor.  He then raked his nails down the sides of the hunter’s legs, the sensation causing goosebumps in its wake.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. He walked slowly back to lean against the counter, slowly slid down until he was sitting right next to where Cas had disappeared from. He wasn’t looking at anyone anymore. His forest green eyes were unfocused, tears fighting to make their way to the surface. His hands shifted towards the floor, as if touching the black stain left behind would let him be closer to Cas.
“It can only be killed with a sword dipped in the blood of pure devotion.” Sam finishes, leaning back in his chair, running his hands through his hair.
. This one hurt something awful. It was one thousand sorrows compressed into one. That memory was the most vivid as it tightened around his chest, and squeezed. That memory was a broken heart.
The loud thump of the trunk of their car closing startled the angels, making them snap out of their little flower expedition. Still, as they stood, Cas and Jack shared a look and smiled at each other. Lost in their own father-son bonding activity.
“Yeah, the kid’s eyes glossed over like they were freaking glass eyes. They were really weird.” Dean adds with a shrug.
“Sam is right, you should get some rest, Dean,” Cas said, taking the hunter’s book from him. He went around their room throwing away the empty beer bottles. It wasn’t often that he got to share a room with Dean, so he felt a strong need to keep everything tidy. His friend would never admit it, but he was a neat freak.
“Sorry Dean, I just don’t want to mess anything up with Baby.” Jack smiled, but still kept his eyes firmly on the road ahead.
“Well, I’m Dean and this is Jack. So, tell me what we are looking at?” The hunter walks towards the board, trying to find his own pattern of weird.
"I volunteer to save Dean Winchester and convince him to join our cause." Though his voice was sure and firm, his hands betrayed him. They shook, and he tried to close them into fists, attempting to hide them. He knew what this mission might mean, but something deep inside him told him it was right.
The thought alone was enough to make Cas smile. Even if he could never find a way out of his prison, even if he could never see Dean or his son again, he could rely on the comfort that he could be a nuisance to the one responsible for his pain until the end of days. Still, he could not give up. He needed to find a way back to Dean, Jack and Sam. He needed to find a way home.
An hour in, and what had originally seemed like a good idea had Dean bored out of his mind. Yes, having his mate’s hands roaming all over him was enjoyable to a certain degree, but Castiel was very methodical about his exploration of Dean’s body.
Castiel could feel the slight tug of the order, but he ignored it. After a few moments of silence, he met Dean’s eyes. He was taken aback by the absolute shock he saw.
‘Heya, Dean-o!’ Gabriel greeted as he bounded into the living room. ‘Hey! I like this movie!’ He leaned over the back of the couch and grinned at Dean.
Gabriel’s eyes darted around the table and caught Michael’s interested stare. He pressed closer to Sam and relaxed a little when an arm wrapped tightly around him. ‘I, uh… I can do a lot more than you’ve seen…’
Castiel’s grip on his book tightened and his knuckles turned white. ‘He…he can feel my thoughts and emotions,’ he replied. ‘Normally, that takes a lot of time…’
Gabriel stared at the small boat tied down to the dock. Sam had insisted, promised, that it was perfectly safe. ‘Yeah… This ain’t happening,’ he finally said, stepping toward the much newer rental that Samandriel had gotten the film crew. He pulled the keys from his pocket and waved them at Sam. ‘You wanna take me on a magical island tour? We’re taking
When John found a lead, Dean called in a couple favors to get the lead to go further and keep John occupied but safe enough that he wouldn't have to worry too much. It was then that he went to his brother. If he could get Sam away long enough, if he could time it just right, then Sam would think the love of his life had died in a simple, accidental fire. No demons, just human error.It was the perfect plan.
Castiel finally managed to clean every last bit of evidence of his life out of his car. Fast food wrappers, empty tubes of paint, shopping bags, sketchbooks, Crowley’s extra camera equipment, everything. Even his beloved manikin had been evicted from the trunk and now cluttered up Gabriel’s kitchen. He breathed a sigh of relief as he looked over the car. Now, all he had to do was get the damned thing to make some sort of noise. He had a feeling Dean was going to avoid him, so he had to figure something out and take it in earlier than what Dean had told him.
Castiel stared at Sam in silence. Did Dean tell Sam about the sea serpent or the scales? He fingered the cord around his neck, pondering whether or not to reveal the scales to Sam.  He decided against it, just in case Sam was out of the loop. ‘I had a question for him, but I suppose it can wait. Will he back later?’
Dean and Cas had disappeared for longer than usual and Sam and Jack had decided to go look for them. Just as they turned the corner towards the kitchen door, they caught a glimpse of the missing pair. Well, more like a couple now.
Cas reaches over to grab the girl’s crayons. He offers them to her. “You can draw it, if it’s too hard to speak.”
Cas looks at the locations and points to one in the far left. “This one is the closest to a water source. Considering how our monster takes its victims, this seems the most logical.”
Cas closed his eyes at the feel of having Dean’s hands on him again. He felt closer to Dean than he ever had before. The pure intimacy of this moment made all the years of pining worth it. With more lube placed on his lover’s cock, Dean reached down to grab and guide Cas into him. The angel helped steady the hunter’s hips as he slowly felt himself penetrate his lover.
He remembers watching Dean uncover the mark on his arm, seeing the confused and horrified look on his face. Though, for Castiel, that moment meant so much more than it ever did to Dean. That was the first time Castiel had left his mark of existence on Earth. Something concrete that a human could see and feel. Yet, he was still too far away to appreciate it. The knowledge of that started a small ache in Castiel's grace, one that would only grow and grow as the years went by.
“The hell kind of angel are you? Angels have wings so they can fly, Cas. Everyone knows that?” Dean finished, his condescending tone was starting to get on Castiel’s nerves. He was so confused that the shortened version of his name went right over Castiel’s head.
“You’re washing the dishes? Now I know something is up,” Cas teased, his voice slightly rougher than usual due to all the laughing and screaming from their previous card game.
"Yeah, I know i had the same reaction when I saw this guy. Thought it would fit you nicely." Castiel finally had the right mind to ask what was going on.
The memories wouldn’t stop. Each whisper of pain grabbing hold of the little grace he had and pulling him down deeper into the Empty’s depths. He could hear It laughing at him. Taking pleasure from his misery. Cas just wanted it all to stop, he needed for it to just
oooooooo boyyy!!! Thanks for reading this far. Would you like art for this fic? Should I make art for this??? Let me know. I promise this has a happy ending, so stick around for the rest o.o
He didn't remember much of it, just got flashes here and there, similar to his memories of how he had felt when he saved Dean from Hell. Cas had to dig through miles of dark flesh, gore and soot to find the small, brilliant soul that was shining in the Cage, gasping and screaming for help - for release! - from his devilish prison.
They leave their desserts unattended, focus shifting to the child who seemed to be walking in a trance-like state. They share a look, wordlessly agreeing on how to proceed.
''Look, just in case, you do know that you cant go back to any family you might have had right? You can keep your name and that's about it. You are not Castiel Novak any more though, from now on you are just Castiel." Gabriel was now looking at the new angel, sizing him up, wondering if he had done the right thing saving him.
“Wait, if you’re sleeping tonight where the hell am I supposed to sleep?” Dean inquired incredulously, barely meeting the half-naked angel’s eyes.
Cas's eyes widened at the admission of a feeling he had never thought himself worthy of.  He turned to look at Sam, hoping he hadn't just imagined the whole thing. He found the tall hunter smiling knowingly at his brother, but a hint of surprise still evident in his features.
“Cas...” his voice betrayed him, the awe practically dripping from that one syllable, “you’re so… wow,” he added lamely. As soon as the words left his mind, they were suddenly replaced by all the different ways he wanted to ravage the man in front of him.
“Oh, well I saw them sleeping together yesterday.” Jack quipped. “Dean was on top of Cas and he looked very happy.”
“It does,” Cas agreed before staying silent for a beat. He came to a stop near the trunk of the tree and moved from under Dean’s grasp. He reached for the next branch before adding, “and yet, I was looking down at you.”
“Okay, and is there anything in the lore on how to gank the bitch?” Dean asks, moving to the mini-fridge to get himself another beer.
. He dropped his hands against the uneven floor, expecting black, boiling goo. But, that was when he felt it.
Cas peers over Dean’s shoulder to glance at the map and then looks forward on their path. “Yes, there’s a shortcut if we veer off the path further ahead.” The angel adds while standing up. “Once we reach the cave, we can track her down from there. I’ll try to sense her presence with my grace.” Cas holds out a hand to Jack with a reassuring smile. “Maybe you can help me with that?” Jack takes his father’s hand and nods, a stern look on his features. “Of course, I will try my best.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As he began buttoning his slate gray shirt  and jeans, he took one final glance in the mirror. He had it all, women, money, fame... Everything he had ever wanted. Why did he always look so.. Troubled? It's not like he lead an Apple Pie life when he was young, Hell no, a drunk, dead-beat, abusive dad and moving from motel to motel surely did not make him the poster boy of happiness. However, he had grown out of that, he was 24 years old now, old enough to grow out of his daddy issues.
“I wasn’t checking you out” Cas murmured petulantly, “I was merely admiring your existence?” He finished in a questioning tone.
“Alright, so the freaks that grabbed them had a thing for branding?” Dean said as a knock came from the door. He stood up to answer it, and let Cas in.
"Now, you are all probably asking yourselves why we care about two meaningless humans, among 7 billion others? Well, these two" He pointed accusingly to the images, like a clergyman condemning a witch to her pyre. "These two mere humans have killed approximately 1,000 of their species, trying to 'save' them from monsters. This has not only caused a boom in the Department of Deaths, as well as Purgatory, it is a grossly inefficient track record for our assets to have."
The sky was tinged a light blue, with the sun shining softly over its tropical domain. Out the window, the trees swayed in the warm breeze as he passed them by. The thrum of the engine beating at once with his heartbeat. Both his mechanical and physical selves becoming one. All the while, he is tapping the steering wheel in a cruel mockery of rhythm. The song is not important now, only the feeling it evokes. There’s a breeze that softly tickles at each of his senses. He can feel the sand rasping delicately across his fingers as he places his hand out the car window. He can smell the sea salt coming from the coast. The water is so close to the road that he can almost taste it.
“Not just servitude Dean.” He turned to face the hunter completely. “This mark was used in the gathering of armies. I’m afraid someone is gearing up for a fight.”
The hunter looks at his friend in the passenger seat for support, but Cas only shrugs. “Alright fine. We can keep playing house, but you better figure out what we are dealing with fast.”
Every single important event in Heaven, was held in the Grand Hall. Such as committee gatherings, training sessions, leadership ascension ceremonies and other similar activities. Sometimes, however, the council would use it for their meetings between their soldiers. These rare meetings  usually focused on announcing tasks and missions to each garrison. Normally, Castiel would be among the first to arrive and the last to leave. Yet, here he was, gasping and heaving as he finally reached the great oak doors, just as they were beginning to close.
Their waitress came to the table then and started taking their orders. Jack decided to try some of the local food, while Sam and Dean stuck to their classics. Once the food came, their son stared wide-eyed at the huge plantain bowl filled with shrimp that was set before him. The hunters stared too, it smelled delicious and for a second they considered getting it instead of their meals. Maybe next time. After the waitress left them alone to enjoy their meal, they brought out their notes on the case and walked each other through what they had learned.
The day had only just begun and it was shaping up to be a very huge disaster for Castiel. As the angel at the top of the tree, he had an immense responsibility to the rest of the ornaments. He had a place of honor which allowed him to hold some power over the rest of the ornaments and the goings on of the tree. He was also the key to assuring that they all came alive again every Christmas Day.
He remembers that before passing out and hearing the start of their new alliance, the start of Team Free Will, Sam had asked him if he was okay. Cas chuckled. At the time, he had drunkenly responded "Don't ask stupid questions". Banter aside, Sam had always cared - even if he wasn’t particularly open about it -  and he taught Cas many of the emotional things he now knows.
“You asked me not to,” Cas responds with a look of pure devotion, his tone soft and warm. The hunter is stunned into silence as he remembers that night under the light post. A memory from years ago.
The memory of their Lady and the Tramp moment came back in full force. Cas’s warm smile, the intense eye contact, the warmth bubbling in his chest that he knew wasn’t from the pizza in his hand. He groaned in frustration, effectively decimating all traces of order in his hair as he kept running his hands through it.
“Well, uh. I remembered that you mentioned you wanted to see a sunset on the trip.” The hunter shifts nervously, his hand rubbing at the back of his neck. He gently lays the picnic blanket on the clearing floor, nervously smoothing down the edges. “I found this place a couple days ago, and-” He shrugs.
“It’s part of a poem which says: ‘In my heart- only I rule, in my thoughts- only I rule, inside myself- only I rule.” Cas recites, his deep voice almost reverent.
The entity laughed, walking away from the angel again. Cas hoped It hadn’t seen him sag in relief. “I can’t let you go Cassie, we made a deal. No… you are not going anywhere”.
There is something on Cas’s face, a feeling, that Dean can’t quite place. He walks up and joins the angel on the windowsill. There is a bit of snow covering the soil outside. There are a few families enjoying the light snowfall on their front lawns, the kids playing with their new Christmas toys. The world is peaceful, beyond the confines of their tree. Dean wishes he could take Cas out there someday. Have their own adventure without worrying about a cursed deadline.
Even after Charlie quit, her and Dean remained good friends. She didn't always call and certainly not that early, so Dean worried and immediately called her back.
Dean stares at him a little longer, a smile slowing coming over his features. “You are a funky little angel, you know that?”
Dean’s smile could make Cas do just about anything. And right now? Eating a slice of pizza he couldn't really taste was certainly one of them.
Maybe that is why he accepts Becky’s ridiculous Christmas tree gift. She had shown up on his doorstep while he was in the middle of a particularly horrid session of “wallowing in self-pity” and she had refused to leave until Chuck had let her come inside. He had begrudgingly watched her set the tree up in his living room, taking each figurine out of their box with utmost care. As she started to put the decorations together, he finally realized what the central theme of the tree was. It was full of Supernatural-themed figurines. The figurines were extremely detailed which meant that Becky had obviously made them all herself. She had prepared a figurine for everyone, even the damn car. And who did she put as the angel at the top of the tree? None other than Castiel, the biggest pain in Chuck’s ass.
“Cas, you dumb son of a bitch” he growled, punching that mocking stain between each syllable. Maybe if he hit the ground hard enough, he would be able to bust his angel out. Or maybe he would just break his hand in the process. Chuck knows he deserves it, so who cares, right?
Sam stood up first, stretching his arms above his head as he looked towards the couple with a grin, “I’m gonna hit the hay, don’t stay up too late”. He nudged Jack’s side discreetly, prompting the boy to follow in his footsteps.
“Jack, come and take her back towards the entrance.” Sam’s voice boomed in Jack’s ears, snapping him out of his frozen shock. He scrambled to help the little girl stand and tried his best to smile comfortingly at her. Even in her daze, the sight of a younger face seemed to help soothe her. She was covered head-to-toe in dirt and grime, and her other hand was clenched around a small cloth doll. Before Jack could usher her back towards the entrance to wait for the others, she grabbed hold of Sam’s sleeve. Her brown eyes stayed glued to his shirt, unable to meet his eyes. She whispered in his ear, “Bad lady has more kids…” her small hand shaking as she pointed towards a dark tunnel that lay straight ahead of them. Sam nodded and whispered his thanks before signaling Jack once more.
“Cas,” a faint but familiar voice said from within the pitch-black wall. Far away at first, but then repeating itself a little more firmly. It almost sounded like... No..
Dean’s soul shone brighter than it had in the last 10 years, and its brilliance almost blinded Cas. His grace came to envelop his hunter, as they finally shared their first embrace. The first of many. Cas smiled as he met his lover’s eyes and muttered his reply.
, he had no way of telling time in this oblivion. He was surrounded by the eternal sea of darkness that was the Empty’s depths, away from the surface he had once come to recognize as grimly familiar.
Dean stood quickly and picked up the empty box along with some bottles. “I’m gonna take these back to the kitchen,” he explained in a hurried tone, before he chanced one last glance at the angel’s puzzled face.
It took him an embarrassingly long time to realize he not only followed Heaven's orders, he had also started to follow Dean's.
Perhaps that is the reason that he now sits on his couch, watching his favorite show obsessively and drinking bottle after bottle of nameless liquor. Chuck is just trying to figure out where he had gone wrong. What had been different about this Castiel, this Dean, and this Sam. They opposed the thousands of worlds he had created before them and instilled fear in the most precious part of himself: his mind.
Dean smiles and stands on the windowsill. He reaches out his hand to help Cas up, “Then, what are we waiting for?” he asks, illuminated by the afternoon glow filtering in the window.
The Winchesters spent the rest of the day together and at peace. An experience they hadn’t shared for a long time, and never thought they would have again. After their family hug, and after Dean had showered, they decided to go out for breakfast at a nearby diner. As they sat at the round table near the back of the establishment, Cas found himself unable to stop smiling. Jack was fighting with Sam about how many pancakes he should order, trying to convince him that his nephilim state meant that he could order enough for two people. So far, his logic had not been able to convince the long-haired, health-conscious hunter.
“And you really want to try their ice cream.” Dean finishes for the angel, grinning when he sees the angel’s cheeks develop a slight pink tinge as he nods in agreement.
After Dean and Cas’s eventful ride back to the bunker, the Winchesters gathered around the war room table once again to enjoy the self-appointed ‘best pizza in Kansas’. Now that Cas was human, he could gladly partake in the celebration and assured Dean that he did, indeed, enjoy the meal. Sam and Jack kept shooting curious glances towards the new couple, taking notice in their increased proximity and their lingering stares and touches.
“I’m not even a damn millennial.” Dean had grumbled, putting up a useless fight against those damn puppy eyes. That is how they had ended up in their current situation. The four of them, Team Free Will 2.0, gathered around the war room table laughing uncontrollably at the prompts they kept placing on the table in front of them.
Dean had stopped blushing after a couple of branches, but the weight of Cas’s admission kept revolving in his head. The angel at the top of the tree had fallen from said top because he was looking at
The lady’s smile dimmed slightly when she caught a glimpse of his expression. She held his hand before giving him his change. “I can tell she meant a lot to you. It’s good to see a man care for his
Back in the car, Sam had already started to do some research on his phone. “I'm checking all the usual channels and so far it seems like seven young children have gone missing in the span of 5 months.”
“You know, I can’t really taste food like I used to Dean.” he tried to object “It’s all molecules to me.” The angel’s voice rang across the table, a warm smile on his face. Dean grinned and pushed the pizza slice closer to his best friend. “And yet, here we are.”
Every now and then, Dean would sneak a glance at the angel sitting peacefully in the passenger seat. He was looking out the window, watching the trees go by. His dark hair was slightly more frazzled than usual, and a bit of stubble littered his jaw. He had forgone his trenchcoat due to the warm tropical weather. As an angel, he didn’t feel the heat, but he found that people still looked at him strangely when he wore it in the island’s weather. So, he had stripped down to his white dress shirt and rolled up the sleeves. These were all facts that were deeply ingrained in Dean’s mind, mostly due to the fact that he couldn’t seem to stop fixating on them. He was reminded of the time he dropped off Cas for his first date, that night he didn’t stop Cas from leaving the car. Now he’s not so sure he would make the same call.
“Yeah, my money is also on witch, but we won’t know more until we interview the victims.” Sam sighed and closed his laptop. “Either way, we are not doing anyone any good by staying up. I’m gonna hit the hay.” He picked up the rest of his things and left for his room leaving Jack behind. There was no use in waking him now.
Castiel nodded as he understood. "Because the usual methods don't work with them." Balthazar smiled and agreed, taking a sip of his drink. "Exactly, and therefore they require a more.. Personal approach. We have to open up the person's heart and soul to make them capable to love. We use Angels like yourself for this since you were once human, you can relate to them more."
“Well, that is Team Free Will’s new motto right there,” Dean adds through a smile. He takes a picture of the quote with his phone, for safekeeping.
A part of Cas knew that he should pull away, but Dean’s soul had always been magnetic to him. This whole situation reminded him of a children’s movie that Jack enjoyed about some stray dogs. Even as he pondered the romantic implications of their current predicament, all he could do was chew and try not to burst into laughter himself.
The taller one reaches out a hand to them first. “Hey, my name is Edgar. That’s my buddy, Carlos. Normally we wouldn’t be too keen on having the feds stepping on our toes.”
Sam hesitated, before gently asking: “Well, if he made that deal, then why did the Empty wait until now to collect?”
Sam gave his phone to Jack and the boy nodded enthusiastically. “Yes! That is the place I saw. Can we please go? I want to learn how to fly a kite. Maybe one of you can teach me?”
The video showed a small child’s bedroom decorated with cowboys and horses. The bathroom was in the right corner of the video with the door wide open. The kid is sleeping in his bed, everything seems still. The boy starts to stir in his bed, and bolts awake. He sits perfectly straight on his bed for a full minute, before getting out of bed and moving towards the bathroom. The child walks into the bathroom and out of sight from the camera. He never comes back. Dean rewinds the video back to when the kid bolted out of bed. His brow furrows and he stops the recording. For a moment, he swears he saw the kid’s eyes shine light blue. Shifter?
Being back on the road felt natural for all of them. Now that they had a game plan in mind, they set their sights towards catching their monster. It was, after all, what they all did best. The boys had finally settled in their usual arrangement, Cas opting for sitting behind Dean and Jack behind Sam. As the passengers each glanced out the window in silence, Dean grew slightly nervous. He was mulling over those pesky unspoken words in his head, trying to find that moment he was waiting for. The hunter would have killed for some kind of sign. He cleared his throat,
“Well isn’t that a good thing?” Dean asked, taking the computer from Sam to look through the reports himself.
Dean scrambled to take the ice cream away from his friend. “You’re gonna get some serious brain freeze if you keep that up.” He chuckled at Cas’s kicked puppy face.
He quickly looked towards his hands and realized the uneven ground wasn’t goo, but hard, grass-covered dirt. The darkness around him wasn’t as empty as he thought at first. A dangerous ray of hope went through him as he dared glance up above him.
The Elders, (or better known as the actual members of the Grand Council) were the angels that took over Heaven after God had left eons ago. None of his brothers and sisters had actually seen the Elders in person, but everyone knew who they were, and the mere mention of their name commanded respect. The great golden and marble statues that stood behind Zachariah were living proof of the angel's respect for them.
be happy, he was dragged back here. Only to be left in the darkest depths of the Empty, completely and utterly alone. He had been shoved into his own prison, and the entity had thrown away the key. It was during moments like these that Cas wished for the comfort of sleep. But, he knew that being awake was a blessing in disguise.
Dean was always popular. Ever since he could remember, people trailed after him whether it be because of his attitude or his looks. He always remembers that girl in the 8th grade, all hips no lips, that had written him a cutesy little poem about his name.
“Who is up for a food run? Jack, you up for a ride?” Dean intervened just as Sam was collecting his 5th winning card in a row. Jack perked at the prospect of riding in the Impala with his father, yet a mischievous twinkle appeared in his eye as he asked:
‘Dean—’ Castiel was cut off by a pair of soft lips pressing against his. He tried not to melt into the kiss, but it was a hopeless battle. He brought his arms up and linked them around Dean’s neck as he deepened the kiss. He moaned in loss when Dean pulled back.
‘Dean…’ Sam winced as Dean banged loudly on the door. He looked helplessly at Gabriel for support, but found none. Gabriel just watched, unimpressed by Dean’s display.
Dean stared up at Castiel and frowned. ‘What’s wrong with your wings?’ he asked in confusion. He closed his eyes with a groan. ‘Fuck. Am I still dead?’
quite secure. Just not with Gabriel for the specific reason of needing to get back in undetected. The basement is the only floor of that building that does not record the movements of my…more trusted employees.’
Dean sighed helplessly. Somehow, he had managed to get Castiel and himself dressed. Or, at least, half dressed. He was in his boxers and a t-shirt, and Castiel was in a pair of shorts without his shirt. Glitter still clung to Castiel’s shoulders and chest, and Dean was having a hard time keeping his priorities straight. As beautiful as his mate looked sparkling under the light, he hated seeing the tear-stained cheeks.
‘Well, what do you expect? I was hungover, and you get paid to do that sort of crap!’ Gabriel whined.
was why the music was playing. Crowley was calling. He sighed in irritation as he picked up his phone just as the ringtone started again. ‘What?’
Castiel shook his head in amusement as he stripped down. His boxers came off, and Charlie whistled appreciatively.
Lucifer backed away, shaking his head. ‘You’re quite the fighter… Very well. You don’t have to tell me. Not that it matters. I already know where to find you.’
With a steady breath, he closed his eyes and teleported to the nearest phone booth. He looked at the horizon and realized it was late to make a call and so he stood by the phone and waited patiently until he could make the call that would lead him to his mission. To Dean Winchester.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought…” Sam interrupted and pulled out his tablet from his nightstand drawer. “I looked a little into the symbols online and I found this ritual.” He gave the tablet to the angel, and Dean peered over his shoulder to read the article.
They parted from the kiss briefly just to catch their breath as their eyes met. Cas noticed that Dean’s pupils had been blown wide, leaving only a thin ring of green around them. His face was flushed, which only made those tempting freckles across the bridge of his nose and cheeks standout even more. Cas found himself wondering how far down those freckles went. Did his hunter have any secret constellations on his skin, simply begging to be explored? The mere thought of them makes Cas want to explore every inch of Dean with his tongue, and then he remembers that
Dean gave Charlie a questioning look and she smiled. "I had a friend named Cas. He used to work at the museum but he.. He had an accident and he didn't make it. That was his brother, Jimmy." Dean looked at her with an even more confused expression.
“We know that all the children were six years old. Besides that, they don’t seem to have anything else in common.” Sam ran a hand through his hair and rubbed his eyes.
The parents looked relieved once they saw their son was unharmed, but they took him away from the hunter with suspicious eyes regardless.
“Good morning Dean,” Cas said with a small smile as he stepped aside to let Dean come into their shared hotel room.
It was well past midday by the time they reached the threshold of the window that was close to the top of the tree. A couple branches extended long enough that they were able to reach the windowsill. This was as far up the tree that Dean was allowed to go as a middle ornament. They had decided to take a break on the windowsill, both of their arms sore from the constant climbing.
Their monster takes the shape of a woman, has an obsession with children, which she abducts using water-powered mind control… He has ruled out pretty much every monster in his father’s journal and his personal experience.
“Fuck Cas, yes!” Dean howled, using his arms to hold himself up against the angel’s shoulders. His legs too weakened with pleasure to keep pushing himself up. This didn’t seem to stop Cas from wanting to please him. He placed both of his feet firmly on the bed behind Dean and used them to thrust up into him, ramming that sweet spot again and again. After a few moments, Dean’s vision went white and his mouth opened in a silent moan as he came. His cock spurting all over the angel’s stomach below him. He collapsed on top of the angel, who slowly started to still his hips.
Castiel had never cared for alcohol, sex or drugs since he was young. This mostly made him an outcast seeing as everyone around him was obsessed by these. He had been fine to just live his days until he found someone worth getting to know better. Even if that moment never came.
