“Alright, two PB&J’s coming right up,” He said. Cas pulled Jack onto his knee so he could reach the table while they waited, and a minute later Dean deposited two plates of sandwiches in front of them, both cut into little triangles with the crusts off. He shoved some bags out of the way so he could sit down and join them, and ate his own sandwich whole, not even bothering with a plate and dropping crumbs everywhere.
“We don’t have a baby monitor,” Cas said like that was a totally normal thing in their lives now. “I was worried about him alone in here.”
Cas was watching from the door when Dean turned to leave, light from the hallway spilling in around him like a halo.
Cas wasn’t aware of his molecules stitching back together, or his consciousness sliding back into him, but he
cas is interesting bc he's a very unreliable narrator and the next chapter is gonna explore that a bit more bc he really doesnt think he gets to have good things and we gotta set the record straight on that
“Sam, can you do a food run on your way back?” Dean said into the phone, trying not to sound too desperate.
“No, Cas. You need your own clothes,” Dean said, willing his cheeks to stop heating up at the thought of Cas wearing his clothes day in day out. Cas sighed theatrically and grabbed the closest shirt to him and threw it on top of their ever growing pile.
Cas would find a flat to rent out not too far from the bunker. Far enough Dean wouldn’t feel obligated to see them, but close enough he would be able to if he wanted. He’d have to work out his own credit card scams until Jack was old enough to go to school and he could find a job; perhaps Sam would help him with the tech part, or at least teach him how to do it on his own.
“Jesus man,” Dean said, coming to an abrupt halt in the doorway to the Dean cave. “He can’t stay here, what am I thinking.” He scrubbed his hand across his forehead like he was staving off a headache. “How’s this meant to work?” And just like that, the bubble Cas had been making himself so at home in burst around him.
The world flashed and flickered around him, a thundering in his ears as if the barn was being torn down around them, and just as his vision began to fade, grey swirling at the edges, Cas was there.
“So you’re back?” Dean said, setting a beer down in front of Cas three hours later, after having dropped the kids off at a police station and hightailing it out of there before too many questions could be asked. Cas looked tired still, but not as pale and ill looking as he had in the impala.
Gasping loudly under the shower, tears finally falling down his face along with the water, Dean was terrified. Terrified of the thoughts that started to haunt him, drowning him and he couldn't breath, he couldn't suck in one fucking breath, he couldn't do shit but stare at the wall with his mouth ajar, while all sorts of insane ideas started to rape his mind. His lungs started to burn, his dry throat started to hurt and the tears floated freely from his wide open eyes.
It was almost as if he was in heat and not that the alpha was in rut. Cas should be experiencing this fear, not Dean. But maybe it was the rejection from before?
“Dean, stop, please. Please, Dean. Just… Ugh… Please. Just… Dean, stop, please,stop! Dean, I am going to… Dean… Dean!!!” Cas shouted out his name, a warm, fuzzy and wet feeling spreading over Dean’s thigh and Dean froze, finally doing as he was asked, a few moments too late. Cas just came all over him, and what was worse, Dean really, really liked it.
Dean dropped a hand warmly on the knee, more of a comforting rub then a friendly pat, and the ache in Cas’ chest grew achingly brighter. “I can put the kid to bed if you want an early night,” He suggested.
It turns out, kids need a lot of stuff. Thankfully, Jack appeared to have grown out of diapers immediately, but he was still wearing the same clothes he had appeared in yesterday - which now Dean looked properly, were miniature version of the outfit he’d been wearing when he’d taken on God earlier that day. (Dean was getting a headache). Now they needed to get him an entire new, tiny wardrobe.
“Alright, come here, short stack,” He said, pulling Jack onto his lap so he could reach the table. He cut the pancakes into tiny bitesized pieces and handed the fork back to Jack. It looked comically large in his tiny hands. “There y’are. Dig in.”
The fragmented parts of Cas were pulling back to him now, as if the black hole was relenting, releasing him. Sparks were flying around him, wind howling, the structure that had not been around him a moment before groaning in protest.
Sam didn’t call Eileen back, but he remained glued to his phone, pinging texts back and forth, dopey smile near glued to his face. Dean couldn’t decide if he was happy for the quiet, or annoyed by the stifling, obnoxious happiness chafing against Dean’s black mood. He turned the music up.
“He did.” Cas brought a hand up to rest against Jack’s back like a proud father. “But he didn’t want to become like Chuck. He didn’t think there was any way to hold that kind of power and not become corrupt, so he gave it up.”
He had a way with Jack that had completely blindsided Cas. It was so at odds with his hard exterior that a person who knew him less well would balk. Cas didn’t bother to hide his grin as he watched Dean dump most of the contents of one of the shopping bags into another and present the mostly empty bag to Jack.
The gaping hollowness in Dean’s chest threatened to swallow him whole as they drove back to Kansas. He tried not to show it, caught Sam’s eyes and smiled at the relief in his expression when Eileen answered her phone on the first try. It was like someone poked a hole in Sam and he deflated back into his seat, tension draining out of him as he laughed a little deliriously at the little picture of Eileen on his screen. Dean turned his eyes back to the road with stiff shoulders and tried to ignore the howling blackness in his chest.
Cas looked down at the duffel bag on his bed and considered hiding it, but decided there was no point concealing the fact he was leaving from Dean. He would find out in the morning anyway. It’s not like Cas could slip out without Dean noticing; or rather, he could, but Dean would definitely panic. Cas refused to cause Dean anymore pain if he could help it.
They moved to the library eventually, and an hour or so later the baby monitor crackled to life, Jack making little burbling noises that meant he had probably woken up from his nap.
When the meal was finished, he wanted to help, but Dean wouldn't let him, saying he had to stay off his leg, so Castiel gathered the plates and glasses, arranged things to make it easier for Dean to carry back to the sink or the fridge. The sweet smiles Dean kept throwing him made his heart thump faster, and his cheeks to heat up.
Except there was nothing easy about it, as Dean's expression turned into a surprised one with a hint of sadness in those beautiful eyes. Castiel froze again, not sure what he could possibly say to make this better, and he didn't get a chance to do it either.
"Ah, yes, indeed. They do have it easier, don't they? And with these new equality laws, it won't be long before they are allowed to be in much higher positions than even us, alphas." Samuel said, then suddenly turned to Castiel with a question. "What do you think, your Majesty?"
He practically ripped Sam's flannel shirt open, only to huff in annoyance when he found another shirt under it. He slid the flannel off and barely broke the hungry kiss to yank the other shirt along with the undershirt off the alpha. Both gasped into their kiss once Gabriel ran his fingers over Sam's chest and down his abs, following the contours of the perfect six pack muscle formation. Gabriel caressed the skin for a moment or two, insecure about his need to move things along and just wishing he could touch for a while. But the urges of his heat prevailed and soon he found himself unbuttoning Sam's jeans, grimacing at the cold feeling of his own slick over them.
"Sure. I'll just grab the popcorn and a few sodas and I will be right back. Here - Dean said as he handed him the remote - find something you'll like."
On the right side, the view of the town spread wide, and in the distance he could just barely make out the shape of a suburbs, that seeped into a village and farmer fields beyond. On the left side, there were hudge cypress trees and in between them there was a view of the wide river that separated one part of the town from another and just beyond that, all the way to the left was a glimpse of the 17th century fortress.
Gabriel threw his head back and cried out, but seemed to choke mid shout, his mouth dropping open, his eyes tearing up. He took small gasps of air, small sobs escaping the more Dean pushed. They stayed like that for a few seconds, then Dean drew back, and Gabriel gulped, his breaths turning into panting. Dean half expected a string of curses, but Gabriel just remained under him, breathing.
"Oh, wait... The line got disconnected. Let me try him again." Charlie spoke, sounding a bit scared, probably of getting yelled at again.
It was raining when Castiel finally got out of his bed and took a look outside. It seemed like it was going to be a gloomy, cloudy day and Castiel felt depressed accordingly. Still, he knew what he needed to do, and he knew it couldn't wait so quickly ate a banana he had in his fridge, put on some clothes and headed outside.
Dean didn't quite smile, but his lip did twitch to the left and a bit up and Castiel took it as a win. But then Dean brought his drink down and he had the whip cream moustache and Castiel couldn't contain his laughter. Dean looked at his questioningly and Castiel tried to explain, unable to stop laughing at the mix of Dean's expression with the white whip cream above his lips.
"A..a.. Alpha... P.. Please..." Dean panted out then whined as Cas stilled completely. His head titled in that adorable way as if he was assessing Dean and fucking stayed like that as he drove a hard one all the way. Dean screamed and threw his head back, his hands reaching to try and touch as much of the alpha as he could, to urge him to do more.
"The one thing this place lacks is an elevator. " Dean commented as he took them up the stairs by the east side of the house. The staircase had a sky-high window that looked into the back yard and Gabriel was astounded by the sight of a swimming pool there, while the forest in the back drew Castiel's attention. Dean noticed him looking, just like he did with the books (not because he was staring at the alpha, no-sir-e), and spoke up.
"What did you do!?" A voice came out from behind, startling Castiel into a warning growl, but once he snapped his head back, he was dumbstruck to find the source of that familiar scent. A man, older, his hair black as the night with a hint of wisdom grey here and there, his wide, bright blue eyes bore into Castiel's as if he had seen a ghost.
No, no, no way he was going to do that. No way. Dean has had a few partners along the years, but nobody would ever... It just wasn't done, okay? Not to an omega. Never to an omega. And certainly not by a newly awoken alpha. They were proud creatures and in the peek of their rut, they would seek out pleasure, not bestow it.
And Dean did it again, drawing a perfect heart over his palm. The tears spilled, Castiel couldn't contain them anymore, nor could he contain the sob that ripped itself from his lungs. He closed his eyes, trying to regain himself, trying to be strong for Dean, for them both and Dean just went ahead, placed his hand over Castiel's and squeezed it tight. Fuck, that man is so much stronger than Castiel could ever be. After all he went through,
"You are free to touch, you know. I am yours... Right Alpha?" Dean asked, something hidden in those words. To stir the conversation away from being too obvious or sounding clingy, Dean added "I like it when you touch."
Dean then motioned right, so Castiel took them right, then another left, passing the 'Coma Ward's sign and just around that corner, Dean pointed to a patient's room. Castiel pushed him to the door and opened it, taking a peak inside. There was a man, a tall man lying perfectly still on the hospital bed, and since this was obviously a ward for comatose patients, Castiel figured that was a part of what was wrong with this man. But who was he?
Dean could only nod, not trusting himself to speak. He turned his head again, this time to plant a soft kiss into Jack’s fluffy hair.
“He did just defeat God,” Dean agreed, feeling somewhat delirious. “And you?” He said, sobering suddenly. “Are you-“
Cas’ sudden existence in a body again was disorienting, but the gravity of Dean Winchester pulled him surely forwards before he even remembered
“Fine,” He grumbled instead, climbing into the car. Dean picked Jack up and deposited him on his lap.
“No, it’s okay. I already know,” Cas said, because that’s what they do. They dance around each other and assumes they already know the other’s mind without ever actually saying a damn word.
After a few minutes of coaxing and a snack later, Sam found himself with a lap full of Jack, who was intent on twirling his fingers into his hair, something Sam accepted with a grimace given that Jack was holding a slice of apple in his other, sticky hand.
“Yes. Jack gave me the choice to stay an angel, but since he’s fully human now I decided I would rather live a normal life with him.”
But then the familiar feel of grace was enveloping him, pushing into his skin and drawing him back out. The pain in his back was fading into nothing rather than the numbness of before, replaced with the feel of
Sam’s reply with a list of groceries he needed came a few minutes later. Dean didn’t bother reading it before chucking his phone aside and planting face first into his pillow. This time he was out almost instantly, sliding into a mercifully dreamless sleep.
He felt slightly naked with only the one layer, but it was better than the blood soaked jacket. He shivered as he slid back into the car and turned the heat up, glancing over his shoulder at Cas already asleep against window in the back. However he’d managed to get out of the Empty had clearly hit him hard, but he was here. He was really here.
Dean’s jacket still had a jagged tear through the back of it, the edges hardening uncomfortably with drying blood and poking him in the back when he leant back against his seat in the impala. He shuddered, the feeling hitting just a little too close to home, and clambered back out of the car to pull it off and chuck it in the trunk. After a moments hesitation he pulled off his flannel and undershirt too, not fancying scrubbing blood out of the leather seats. He used the bundled up t-shirt to awkwardly wipe up the blood on his back as quickly as he could in the frigid night air before pulling on a spare, slightly musty t-shirt that was bundled at the bottom of the trunk.
“Jack, say hi to Sam,” Dean said, and Jack hummed his disagreement, burrowing further into his neck. “He’s tired, give him a minute.”
“Cas- what the hell?” Dean said, and where Cas had expected to hear anger there was instead confusion, and what sounded like hurt. Cas’ gut clenched.
Dean darted forwards, dropping the snacks onto the coffee table and snatching up the shotgun salt rounds he’d been packing while watching Netflix, carelessly strewn amongst the other general clutter. Completely unaware that Cas’ feet were rooted to the floor, his lungs suddenly made of iron, he fished the knife he kept shoved down the side of the sofa cushion out and stowed everything onto a tall shelf out of Jack’s reach.
“Yes. Just tired. The transition to humanity is always… odd,” Cas said, and it wasn’t a lie. His skin felt too sensitive, his muscles too weak, and he still had trouble interpreting what his body needed beyond knowing it needed
“Dean-“ Cas still wasn’t getting it so he pulled his hand up, placing it firmly on his chest, covering it with his own. His heart beat so hard against his ribcage it was like it was trying to break out to join Cas’ hand.
“Yeah. For once we just get something good,” Dean said, reaching a hand out to rub a knuckle against Jack’s shoulder. His beer sat untouched forgotten on the table in front of him, Cas realised.
Dean scooted him over to hold him with one arm and pressed his face close for a second, before closing the door quietly behind him to let Cas get some more sleep. He had no idea how much of a toll being dragged back from the empty and turned human might have had on the angel, but whenever he’d he’d never been much of a morning person previously.
Cas had been foolish to think he and Jack were invited to live here like a weak approximation of a normal family; though he had hoped it would be more than a day before Dean would realise he didn’t want them around. Dean span on the spot, surveying the room with a stressed look on his face. Cas hated being the reason for that look; after everything Dean had been through he should be at peace. Dean dropped to his knees and dragged an ancient looking dagger out from one of the recliners and that too joined the pile on the shelf. Then he scooped up a bunch of papers and books Sam had clearly been working on and packed those away neatly too.
The kid wasn’t heavy, but Dean’s knee creaked uncomfortably when he lowered Jack carefully into his bed, trying not to wake him. Despite his care, Jack still roused, sighing and reaching out a delicate little hand to grab Dean’s collar.
“I think it’s great,” He said warmly, a genuine grin stretching across his face, Cas returned the smile, feeling a little more at ease. "So is he like an actual three year old or does he still have some powers and remember stuff or-" he launched in with his usual enthusiasm.
They both agreed that the first thing they needed to do was to go shopping for the essentials. Pancakes for breakfast was fine, but Dean was pretty sure the burgers he had planned for lunch would be a bit too much for the little squirt, and they didn’t have any juice or snacks to speak of.
“A movie night sounds nice,” Cas said. He should’ve known Dean would consider pop culture an important part of Jack’s upbringing. He’d been attempting to slowly ‘teach’ Cas since purgatory. Though Cas wasn’t sure Jack was yet at the developmental stage that would allow him to process such a movie, much less understand the cultural significance of it. “It’s been a while since we’ve done one.”
“Dean, no, you can’t go like this, you’re gonna be okay,” Sam begged, but Dean could barely hear him, or the prayers that came next, shouted hoarsely at the world as the last of Dean’s strength failed him and he slumped forwards into Sam’s shaking chest.
“Think you can give me a hand getting the shopping in, buddy?” He asked. Jack nodded gleefully and accepted the bag like it was something important, before toddling off towards the garage door with it held high above his head so it wouldn’t drag along the floor. Dean laughed softly to himself as he scooped the rest of the bags out of the trunk.
“Yeah, well,” Dean said, not meeting his eyes, cheeks flushing pink, “I raised Sammy, so, y’know. And I’ve always liked kids.”
Dean was unpacking the shopping bags on the kitchen table when Cas returned. Stacking clothes into neat piles for Jack and Cas. There was a pile of toiletries next to Cas’ stack, and a growing pile of miscellaneous ‘Jack items’ at the end of the table.
Cas scooped Jack up, getting flour all over Dean’s borrowed AC/DC shirt in the process, and perched him on one of the stools. It was too low down and far away from the table for Jack, and he had to pull himself forwards with his arms on the table to even see his plate.
“It’s Dean,” Dean said softly. Jack’s eyes fluttered open, fixing on Dean. His mouth tugged in a crooked, sleepy smile.
The list of things to do kept growing longer and longer in Dean’s head until he pressed the heel of his hand into his eyeball, willing his brain to pipe down. He grabbed his phone from where he’d abandoned it on the nightstand. There was a text from Sam which simply read
“What do you guys say to a movie night?” Dean asked, scooping Cas’ finished plate up and stacking it on top of his to take back to the kitchen.
It’s the most natural thing in the world when his hand travels up Cas’ chest to rest lightly against his neck, thumb stroking softly at his jaw. When he leans in those last few inches and kisses Cas, it’s not world ending. Reality doesn’t shatter around them. It’s just the press of lips on lips, sleep warm and solid and real, and Cas presses back despite being only half awake. The light in Dean’s chest expands, filling every inch of him, and he’s finally certain that this isn’t heaven, because nothing has ever felt more real and more right in his life than this moment.
Dean wasn’t sure what time Sam would be back, but he’d probably have breakfast at Eileen’s anyway so he didn’t need to worry about feeding him. He turned on the coffee pot one handed, but quickly realised making breakfast like that was going to be more of a challenge. He then realised he didn’t even know what three year olds were supposed to eat for breakfast. Do they still need formula? Baby food?? Oh, he is so not cut out for this.
“Jack?” Dean said, and it came out as a whisper. His heart thundered in his chest, the echoing emptiness suddenly so full it felt like he could burst. He flicked his gaze up to Cas, and saw his eyes were shining as he watched the pair of them.
This wasn’t Jack’s second chance, it wasn’t Dean or Cas’ either, far from it. If you added it all up it was probably their twentieth chance at life at least, but it was their first
They took their plates back to the kitchen and Dean set about making popcorn while Cas washed up. “Your dad always manages to burn this” Dean stage whispered to Jack, and Cas flicked soapy water at him, mostly to see his smile. Dean held Jack up on his hip and pointed to which buttons for him to press, telling him “good job,” and setting Jack back on the floor when the device lit up and the plate started rotating.
Dean wanted to protest, but the look in Cas’ eyes made the words die in Dean’s throat. And he realised this was it; the first true act of free will was an angel falling from grace to live a human life with his son. He chose this. Cas looked- he looked happy. At peace.
Cas shifted slightly in his seat, suddenly tense. He had no idea what Dean had told Sam about his last moments before the empty took him, and felt suddenly unprepared for a conversation about it. But Sam didn’t seem to sense his awkwardness, which Cas hoped meant he didn't know.
they’d somehow have to get their hands on a booster seat so they could even take him to get these things. And jeez— Cas was human now too. He could borrow Dean’s stuff but he was going to need stuff of his own eventually.
“We did, but we’ve been here like three hours and if we’re much longer I think the kid’s gonna have a meltdown.”
The child in Cas’ arms wriggled impatiently and Dean dropped his hand, taking half a step back and composing himself. “Uh, Cas, not that I’m not thrilled to see you but, uh, who’s this?”
Jack watched the bag spin with wide eyes and jumped when the first piece popped. Dean laughed and left him watching the expanding bag as he snatched up a dish towel to dry the dishes Cas was stacking on the rack. They worked quietly, shoulders brushing and occasionally glancing over at Jack to check he was still enraptured by the microwave. It was comfortable in a way life in the bunker had never quite managed to reach before. Cas felt no guilt in taking his time over a small task because he had nowhere else to be, no one would suffer for his indulgence. For once they weren’t outrunning catastrophe. The bubbles dissolved slowly in the sink around his wrists and the popcorn popped rhythmically to his left, accompanied by Jack’s small gasps of wonderment. Dean’s warmth was steady beside him, only pulling away to stack a dry plate to the side and then returning as if magnetised.
deal with that right now. So he wiped the wetness from his cheeks with rough hands, squared his shoulders, and pushed off the wall. When he returned to the car with pork rinds and two shitty, weak coffees, Sam treated him to the look anyway, but Dean ignored him and slammed the door shut, revving baby and pulling away almost before Sam had shut his door.
i was going to write more but a I'm working out How Toddlers Work at the same time dean is which is surprisingly a Lot, more plot heavy and emotions heavy stuff comes in next chapter when im gonna force these two to start using their goddamn words
“Jack, sit your ass back down,” He said, tone stern, his knuckles white where he gripped the steering wheel like he was expecting to crash any second, despite driving a solid ten miles an hour below the speed limit.
“Stay with me tonight?” Dean asked, his voice small. He didn’t say he couldn’t bare to let Cas out of his sight just yet, or that he wanted to wrap himself around him and never let go, but Cas nodded anyway, so Dean lead him back to his room.
“You gonna stand in the doorway all night?” Dean asked, confusion flickering over his face briefly as Jack settled on his thighs. “And toss me that remote, would you?” He prompted. Finally, Cas managed to unstick his feet from the floor and made his way woodenly over to the sofa, sitting a safe distance from Dean and passing him the remote stiffly.
Sam cracked his beer and dropped another at Dean's seat before taking his place again, smile still on his face.
When he looked back up, Cas wasn’t eating his own food, but instead watching Dean with such a soft look in his eyes it made him squirm inside. He looked down at his own plate to avoid his gaze and manoeuvred awkwardly around Jack to cut his own food one handed.
Despite how bone tired Dean had been just minutes ago, now his mind was racing. He’d helped out with Lisa’s niece years ago, and raised Sammy a lifetime ago, but none of that felt like it had prepared him to be faced with an actual child - a
“Yes,” Cas said simply, fixing him with a look that stopped all of Dean’s arguments in his throat. He nodded and cast his gaze down to the table, unable to look at Cas. Over and over again Cas sacrificed himself for Dean and he would never be able to repay him.
"Just get on with the story." Gabriel replied and Balthazar huffed at him, then focused back on Castiel.
Only once before did he manage to slip into the dreamland with ease and without the ghosts of the past or the present haunting him, and that was two days ago, right in this very penthouse, right next to this man before him. What was it about him that made Dean feel so... Different?
"Of course it's okay, Cas. I gotta go run some errands, but I won't be long... Um, how about... Wait." Dean said, then rushed inside. Coming back, there was a pillow in his hand and a book on top of it and a bottle of water in the other. He gave Cas the book and the bottle and pulled up an empty chair, setting the pillow on top of it. Then he knelt down, and helped Cas lift his leg up on it, making sure he was comfortable. "You enjoy yourself out here, keep that leg elevated and I'll be back in a jiffy."
Dean was astounded by Sam's progress starting with mere recognition not just of him, but also of Meg. Dean watched as his brother eyed her warily until the moment she spoke up and introduced herself. His eyes flared up in recognition of her voice and his lips tugged at a small smile. Seeing that on his brother's face was priceless and Dean felt so overwhelmed with joy that Sam is... Alive and conscious and responsive, it was all he could talk about.
Once again, the room was filled with rugged breaths and the sound of the oven fan, and sloppy breathless kisses the alpha was trailing over Dean's shoulder. The omega huffed a laugh, a dopey smile remaining on his face.
As soon as he could reach, Dean's hand shot up and grabbed the man's hand tightly, his eyes focused on him with a mix of love and relief. Castiel felt a jolt in his chest, that pang of jealousy lodging itself into his heart. Who was this man? Better yet, who was he to Dean? Why would Dean go though all this to see him, to... Make sure the man was alright? Well, still in coma, but alive...
"I know. I know. I do too. But there's no point in dwelling upon the past. Maybe it was right. Maybe I had to go through that so that I could spend the rest of my life being happy with you." His omega was one remarkable creature, without a doubt. Castiel felt so unworthy, yet he couldn't deny he was beyond happy to have someone as magnificent as Dean for a truemate.
"Don't worry, it will be fine. Sam can be a bit odd about certain old customs, but otherwise he is just one big teddy bear. And I... I may have talked to him about you... You know, before... So he already kind of likes you." Dean said, now blushing himself adorably and Castiel smiled at him and placed a small kiss on his cheek. "Just... If he offers you his hand, his wrist up, you are supposed to sniff it and then offer your wrist back. That is how people used to scent others and their intentions or whatever back in the day. I am sure he won't do anything else weird."
Dean hummed as they entered the bedroom and drew Castiel's attention. The man was looking over at the bed, some longing in his eyes, and by God, that was it. That was that extra thing Castiel needed. With that idea, he quickly fished out some old sweats and a plain white T-Shirt, handed them to a surprised man then showed him to the bathroom. He nearly pushed him inside, and closed the door behind him, completely forgetting to show him where fresh towels were and what soap he could use, or anything else Dean might need (a toothbrush and a razor would have been nice). Instead, he skipped (yes, skipped!) back to his bedroom, giddy and with a smile on his face as he dug into his wardrobe in a search for clean sheets.
"I'll just wait for you in the... the TV room." He said and this time managed to run away this time, leaving a smiling, but still deeply worried Castiel to shake his head and proceed to the bathroom. And Dean was ok. He was good. He was fine while he was looking for the remote. He was excited while scrolling through the endless possibilities of movie titles. He was thrilled to find Thor: Ragnarok and he hoped Castiel would want to watch that.
Castiel stared at him for what felt like eternity and Dean was already starting to feel the tang of rejection build up inside of him, when the most amazing thing happened.
"I have to... I have... I... I have to meet someone." Castiel blurted out. He couldn't tell Dean he had something to finish up, because Dean would offer to help and then find out Castiel was lying, and maybe confront him about it. This was easier.
"Good. Then you're up with Mr. Novak. I got a late meeting, so I will be out tonight, leaving Crowley in charge." Azazel added on the way to his office. Dean passed him again when he came out of his room and watched him leave out the back before turning to check on Adam. They all knew what it meant when someone wasn't 'feeling good'.
"I... I am not sure that would be wise. If we were to meet someone while I am like this... I might not react well." Now as much as Dean would like to see protective Cas tear Ketch a new one and scare him for life, he was glad that was the reason why the alpha didn't want to go out, and not Dean and a bad memory. Dean was still too much of a chicken to go up and ask the alpha about their mating, and he didn't know if he would ever man up and face the issue.
In retrospective, Dean should have known this would turn out to be one of those freaky cases, like that one with the ghost sickness he contracted, that made him scream at a cat in a locker or that one when they got stuck in TV land with Gabriel as the producer, director, occasional trickster and a short archangel that looked ridiculous in his too big doctor’s coat. But he was with Cas this time, and not with Sam, so he thought it would be fine.
"Cas... Oh, Jesus. That... Stop..." Dean said and Castiel instantly obeyed, starting to pull his fingers out. "No, stop... This. Not. That." Dean said as his hand reached for Castiel's that was stroking him and steadied it. "Stop or I'll... Just... Keep doing... Keep going..." And Castiel obeyed pushing all three fingers back inside, as deep as they would go. "Ooohh... Jesus Christ..."
What was he doing? Shame washed over him as he quickly returned his hand back to the tip of his shoulder, hating himself for allowing this weakness. But then Dean let out a hum, such a pleased little sound, rolling his shoulder towards Castiel’s warm palm, soothing the alpha’s guilt. It was true what all those biology books said - omegas crave touch. It helps them calm and heal, so this should be beneficial for Dean.
Dean pointed out that there was a large kitchen and a dinning room, mostly only used for holidays and big events because each apartment had its own kitchenette and people rather ate in private. He actually sounded a bit sad saying that, as if he wished these rooms were filled more often.
Castiel's leg ticked nervously as he tried to focus on the same line of text for the past hour, bitting the head of his pen, which he didn't even need. Maybe it would have been easier if he didn't get a wall of text, no paragraph, no spacing. Or maybe it would have been easier if the whole last week hadn't happened.
Cas growled, shoving Dean behinding himself and standing proud and protective with his pants around his ankles. Dean huffed a laugh, finding it adorable. "Relax, alpha. That’s just the maid, bringing water. Let me get it?” He asked, emphasizing Cas’ designation and using a soothing voice to calm his inner beast. Cas didn’t quite let him, lingering behind the door as Dean opened it and slowly took the offered heated water for the bath. In the far corner of the room stood a shiny new tub, a gift from Baron Bartholomew of all people, and Dean tried to carry the water to it, but Castiel snatched it, looking under his lashes at Dean as he carried it to the bath.
There were stacks of comics and books scattered all around the living room, and even if the place was clean, Dean got the urge to dust it all, maybe even fire up the vacuum, despite having done that just yesterday.
"I get it." Dean said. And he thought he did. The guy was lonely. Probably with all the money he had, he never had true friends, not that Dean would know what those were, but still... He probably had leeches and bloodsuckers to deal with who were only interested in hanging out with him for his money.
"You...um... Got something there..." Gabriel said pointing at Dean's head and Dean huffed, took a dirty rag he was holding and wiped it across, smearing the whole thing further. His smile seemed to falter for a moment as he scanned the yard.
“It is, but helped anyway.” Cas said as he came into the kitchen section to pour himself some coffee too. Dean simply handed him the mug he already poured and Cas smiled his thanks.
"Yes, yes, Alpha! Yes! Knot me... Take me. I am yours, all yours..." Dean babbled. "Mark me! Mark me, make me yours for the whole fucking world to see. Take me Alpha!"
Lastly, he tried Charlie, but her text didn't get delivered, so Dean figured she must have shut her phone off or something. Except a person like Charlie would never do that, but he didn't know her that well. He didn't know she was in on an emergency meeting and that she wouldn't see the text well after she tiredly dragged herself home, dropped into her beg and slept a few hours off.
"Stop staring at me, you goof, or you will be late for work." Dean warned with a laugh and started to get up, but Castiel grabbed his wrist, brought him close and set one tender lip kiss, as he swung his arms around him. Dean giggled as he seemingly tried to break free, and once Castiel allowed him to pull his lips away, Dean rolled his eyes. "Seriously, you're going to be late."
Dean gasped upon the first contact and let out a small 'tmpth' or whatever sound that was, when Castiel's hand moved across his lenght. Then there was a choked off moan when Castiel's fingers closed around him and stroke him only once before pausing.
Wouldn't  mind reading what you think so far? I am hoping not to drag this along, so the climax (of the story, of course) will be coming soon.
“Good.” was all Dean said before rising from his chair. Invisible sparks shimmered through the air as Dean stalked towards the bed, both of them staring at one another. As Dean stood up, revealing his body’s full naked glory, Castiel caught a glimpse of Dean’s erection, his… cock standing proudly, making Castiel's mouth water. The arousal that was shimmering underneath the surface rushed up, causing disruptions in his breathing.
Sammy never let go of Gabe's hand. Even when they showed back up at the bunker, the kid kept a hold of the archangel like he was afraid that Gabe might disappear again. Gabe tried telling him over and over that he wasn't going anywhere. But each time, Sammy nodded, mumbled 'I know', and kissed Gabe's lips while squeezing his fingers tight. The poor kid obviously missed the trickster while he was away. Jessie clung to her Papa's side for most of the time too, but she bounced back and forth between Gabe and Jude, constantly making sure that they were both okay. Dickie was probably the most ecstatic, though; jumping, wiggling, and barking like a puppy. Gabe carried him around for almost an hour and Dickie stayed right by his side even when he put him down. Gabe loved that little hump-machine so much.
A tiny bit of movement came from under Jess's tight skin, making Sam gasp and flinch his hand back. Holy shit! The baby heard him! She was already aware of the people outside the womb. Sam looked up to Jess to see if she felt it too, and she was already smiling at him.
The man stopped in front of the angel and Castiel couldn't stop himself from reaching out to touch Dean. Cas's hands pressed flat against the man's bare chest, feeling his strong heartbeat just below his skin, before slowly gliding up to cradle both sides of his freckled face and neck. A rich sigh escaped Dean's nose as he stared down at Castiel with gorgeous jade eyes.
Only, she looked drastically different from the corpse-like being Jude remembered from the crack house in New York. Now, she looked healthier. Her face was fuller, more pink than white. Her hair was combed neatly, parted around her face. And although there were still dark circles around her eyes, they were no longer bloodshot. She was even wearing a clean set of clothing and a dark, feminine leather jacket. The sight of her took Jude's breath away. And the sight of
High pitched giggles came from Charlie’s grinning mouth at the sound of Papa’s excited voice. She probably had no idea what Pop was saying, but the tone he used made her happy.
Gabriel turned his bewildered gaze up to Sam, looking completely lost. Sam shrugged his shoulders in return.
' before leaning back to finally capture the angel's mouth with his own. Their tongues met and twirled together inside each others' mouths, making endorphins rush and hearts pound. Dean's free hand crawled its way up to hold the back of Cas's soft head while they kissed and Cas's hands clung to the front of Dean's shirt. They were suddenly making out the same way they did years before, like sex-starved teenagers that were crazy in love with each other. Hell, Dean
The hunter and his archangel watched as the secretary walked over to open a door and step inside a different room. Her absence left the two of them to look at each other in bewilderment.
It only took one call of Cas's name for the angel to appear. He popped inside the store by the entrance – and his blue eyes instantly filled with shock. Cas flew over to the floor where Dean was sitting and knelt down, dismissing the dead demons and broken glass on the floor.
He did not expect to see his eyes bore into him, the redness in them consuming Castiel completely. The wave of alpha arousal hit him like a frying pan, making him feel dizzy and elevated, and he shuddered at Castiel's alpha voice that called out to him.
"Are you alright?" The man asked, and it would have been comforting if he chose to set his hand on Castiel shoulder, and Castiel wished Balthazar ignored his aversion to be touched, but he held back respectfully.
Cas sucked in a breath when Dean finally closed in on him, pressing his body and curving it so that it would fit Cas’ perfectly. He pressed his hips against Cas’, wedging his thigh between the alpha’s legs and feeling this erection grow. Cas’ breathing was rapid and shallow, almost sobbing as Dean moved against him, letting his hands roam, and kissing that special spot that drove his alpha crazy, that drove him to an orgasm a few days before. Castiel’s hands were glued to the wall as if he was holding on for dear life, every muscle in his body spasming at the overload of sensations and he mewled as he came, right then and there, in his pants. Cas sagged down, and would have probably sunk down the wall if Dean wasn’t still pressed against him.
Dean shouted, his voice turning into cries of pleasure as his alpha started moving faster, little rougher, and much much deeper. Stars danced in his peripheral vision as he kept his eyes locked with his alpha, unable to break the intense stare. His breath hitched a few times, making him almost hiccup as the alpha’s cock kept brushing against that sweet spot within, more and more often; it drove him to the verge of an orgasm, but kept him there, teetering on the edge.  It only became worse, or even better - Dean was delirious by now, when Cas started moving more and more, plowing into him hard, yet somehow still gently and lovingly.
“Dean. Dean, please…” Cas begged, reluctant to be pulled in, but still setting his knee on the bed. The sound of Cas’ voice made him more awake.
He knew. He knew he should work better and think more about the situation he was in, but this... This was just easier. To stay in the shelter and eat there too, and take Balthazar on his offer to use his shower every now and then. He just didn't have the strength to fight, to try and work it out, he felt... Exhausted.
Dean's own eyes widened as those sapphires seemed to come closer, and closer, unbelievably close and then they hid away behind the eyelids, but Dean didn't mind. How could he mind when those incredibly soft, kind lips were brushing against his own, barely touching, tickling until he couldn't take it anymore. He pushed forward and captured those elusive lips between his teeth and dragged them out, savouring the flavor of them.
"Want another one? Please?" Oh, God, he sounded... He didn't even know what to compare it with. He started casual, but his voice cracked at the plea, which was a very stupid thing to add, making him sound pathetic.
Castiel wanted arch into the touch, but knew he couldn't, even if he already came once, back in his office, he could feel the buildup in the pit of his stomach again. He was already far more then he should be, and whoa! the direction Dean was headed now, he was afraid he would last long.
His breathing grew deeper and deeper as the rose travelled lower and lower on his neck, over his collarbone and down his chest. And just as it was about to reach his nipple it took a different course and started going up his arm, tickling him a bit in the process.
"You... You have some chocolate here..." Dean whispered and his hand slowly reached towards Castiel, his thumb brushing over his lower lip, lingering there a bit too longer and before Castiel knew it, Dean was already retracting his hand. Did he... Did he really have chocolate there or did Dean just want to touch him?
As if he could read his mind, in a way, the alpha pulled away and grabbed him by the hips, flipping him over with such ease, it made Dean even more lightheaded. Damn, he was strong. And then... Then he did something Dean most definitely did not expect. He nosed Dean's balls once more, his sinful tongue coming mouth to play again his way up Dean's balls to the base of his omega cock.
"Oh! Good Morning, Mr. N... Castiel." Dean said with a small smile and a blush creeping up his cheeks, making eye contact with the man in front of him for only a split second before looking away, looking towards the table and speaking up again. "I... I ordered breakfast, I hope that is ok."
When Dean replied that he was 'awesome', there was that spark in Dean's eyes that made him feel so good. Seen. Cherished. Cared for. And it made that longing even more present, so when Dean took a step forward, Castiel did the same.
"Face it, bro. You are a coward. You are scared to go out and meet new people and try new things. Heck, if it wasn't for this kitchen, you wouldn't even leave the apartment. " Gabriel said as he motioned around the open cafeteria that was part of the homeless shelter. Few years back, Gabriel managed to persuade him to come out here and help out. He put his best wounded puppy look and used '
He had no time to dwell upon this right now, he had work to finish. So he pressed on, directing his focus back on the text. It was so much easier to edit the work of some actual writers than of the people Mr. Crowley worked with, a few misspells here, a few comas there, a better phrasing or two and it was... Done.
Dean was by his side the entire time, but it didn't feel like he was smothering him, like it did with Zach. No, Dean was there, but somewhere in the back, waiting to be needed, and perfectly content to be there, nothing more. Castiel though he should really stop comparing him to Zach, it wasn't fair to Dean. The man was kind and sweet and he really seemed to care about Castiel.
No, that wasn’t the question. The question was - should he reach it without breaking the skin contact?
"Your Majesty, may I present to you Lord Samuel Campbell, of the Northern Campbell Estate." Gabriel made polite introductions, bowing in a proper manner as he excused himself away from the breakfast table. An extremely tall, broad shouldered alpha, not too younger than himself, bowed before Castiel, his long hair pulled back and tied in a fashionable way.
Immediately, Dean was engulfed in that familiar Pine cologne and a hint of something else and it just felt so much like Cas. Safe. Dean snuggled into it, bringing the collar to cover his face and inhaled deeply, his breath still hitching a bit, but he could feel himself calm down. He took a few more deep breaths and calmed down enough to act normally, even if the voice inside his head, the one that would always spill bile all over him, was silent as mime.
"You should go to the hospital, have them check that out, that can be good. You can't just be fine."
Dean's lower lip trembled at those memories that flooded his mind and wouldn't let him fall asleep, and even when he finally did, the kisses haunted his dreams. And the worst part was that he will never feel a kiss like that again. Because he screwed up, like everything else in his life. It was all his fault, the suffering of his entire family. His mom, his dad, his brother... They all suffered because of him. Of course he would screw up his last chance to support his brother.
Mr Novak caressed his thighs again, pushing just a bit to let Dean know to spread them, and in no time his hand found it's way... Down there. His finger pressed against Dean's hole and Dean tensed hard, sucking in a deep breath. He didn't even notice when Mr. Novak ceased the kissing, too worried about the part to come.
Like I said, I'm heading to NashCon this coming weekend. And if any of you are attending, I demand that you either message me on PM or Tumblr, so that we can make plans to meet in person and I can finally hug your adorable face! XD Again, I'm really sorry for the huge gap of time between this chapter and the next, but I promise that if you continue this story, it will all be worth it. :) Thank you guys sooo much, from the bottom of my heart, for staying with me this long! You guys are basically my family, and I'm grateful for all of you. :) The next chapter will be out soon! :)
The delightful smile on Dean's face dimmed considerably when he turned to see the bag. It was almost like he had seen this bag before because he didn't look very surprised by the dirty things inside. In fact, he seemed more disappointed than anything.
For one desperate second as he stared out at the destruction ahead, Dean thought that maybe Cas could still fly to him. Angels could go between Heaven, Earth, and Hell, right? Cas might be able to hear him call and find him. He always did…
Another, much louder, crack of thunder shook the earth, only it wasn’t from Lucifer’s rage. This time, it came from Michael. The archangel had straightened his back and flashed his own grace, causing the wind to stir and white lightening to clash with the red in the clouds above.
Dickie gave an excited bark before dashing across the bed to jump to the floor. A shrill giggle escaped Jess's smiling mouth as she chased after the dog as fast as she could. Sam smiled fondly at the sight as he lingered back to glance at the ceiling.
Jude let out a tiny squeak as uncle Gabe's hand pushed him even more. The motion caused Jude to stand directly behind uncle Gabe. The little boy had to stand on the tips of his toes to see Raphael over Gabe's shoulder.
“You alright there, fella?” the gentleman asked, “I saw your car on the side of the road and I thought you might need some help. You okay in there?”
“Besides making me puke, they seem okay,” Jude answered, holding his own stomach, “I can’t really feel them much. I know they’re in there, but I can’t really tell them apart. Not yet, anyway.”
“Lay off him, Dean,” he demanded, shoulders tense, “Gabe made up for what he did and he's being civil. You need to grow up and do the same. Stop being a dick.”
Jude, Jessica, and Ollie all joined arms and started to skip toward the zoo entrance like the characters from the Wizard of Oz, with Dickie playing Toto. The adults followed close behind, mumbling to each other about money and stuff. Uncle Dean was still trying to figure out how to use his new video camera, but by the time they got to the ticket counter, he tossed it in the bag that Dad was carrying and grumbled that he was 'done trying to deal with that piece of crap.'
Sam carefully closed the book in his hand and stole a glance down at the top of Jessica's head in the soft glow of her nightlight nearby. He secretly hoped that she liked how The Velveteen Rabbit ended. It was a very bittersweet finale and Sam remembered how much it effected his own heart when he heard the story for the first time at a young age. But he knew that it would correlate with the holiday and Jessie's nickname.
“I hope you're happy, Sam. Seriously. I hope you're on cloud freakin' nine,” Dean snapped in his little brother's general direction as he tried to shake the grated cheese out of his clothes, “I'm gonna smell like egg salad for a whole damn week.”
During Jane's question, Sam's mouth fell open and his half-chewed pancake nearly fell back out. His eyes darted up to meet Gabe's and his head immediately shook back and forth. Sammy was clearly against having strangers in the bunker... but how was Gabriel supposed to deny shelter to Jessica's future family? He couldn't just turn them away!
“Ah, that's a load of crap and we both know it. You can be anything you wanna be, Dean,” Bobby smirked, “But I can understand where you're comin' from. Hell, I've been there before.”
Jessica went with her boyfriend's suggestion and arranged the letters accordingly. Afterward, she was left with five more letters. The other two words couldn't have been very big. Feeling a bit panicked, Jessica used her fingers to switch around every combination that she could think of. She accidentally ripped one of the 'R's in the process. It wasn't until Dad reached over and moved just one of the letters that Jessica finally got the full message. She and Papa both lowered their heads to read the strange message before them.
The twins, of course, couldn’t hear or understand him, but it still felt nice to talk to them. Jude smiled down at his own body for several moments – until his nausea came back and he reached for the trashcan again. This time, he puked until there was nothing left in his gut, leaving him to dry heave repeatedly. His back was starting to hurt from being hunched over and his knees were quivering. But he was able to hear the bedroom door open across the room.
“That's okay, baby bunny. You don't have to tell me anything specific,” he hummed, “I just want to know if... If you ever see yourself in school.”
Nearby, Bobby suddenly coughed dramatically, giving Clarence a set of narrowed eyes from under the bill of his hat.
Eventually, Jude's glowing grace actually started to burn Raphael's skin. Jude could feel it shriveling up under his fingers, making pain flash on the guy's mean face. The evil angel groaned and cried, trying to hard to pull his wrist free. By the time Jude eventually let him go, Raphael's entire arm had turned into charred, ashy bone. He clutched his dead hand and backed up to look at it, glancing between the black bones and Jude's face with actual fear.
The seraph raised his hand and shined some grace from his palm, letting the light reveal that Jude had fallen safely into his arms. The small kid had buried himself inside Cas's trench coat and refused to look up, still shaking with fear and making the oversized helmet rattle on his head. Gabe inhaled a breath of relief. Phew! He was so grateful that Jude was okay.
The last thing Dean wanted was for their son to walk in and see his Papa in these sexy clothes. Cas raised both hands to Dean's shoulders, making the slinky robe sleeves slide down his arms, and started gently tugging the man's jacket off.
At first, Jude only turned around slowly, as if he was taking in his surroundings. His face remained expressionless, though; eerily blank in the glow of the fire. When his head raised to look at Cas with those empty eyes, his feet started moving forward. The closer he moved to the fence of flames, the more Dean's heart thumped in his chest. No, he was getting so close to the fire! If he passed through, he could die!
“Charming,” Crowley sneered flatly, “Just the sort of outrageous threat I would expect from a hunter attempting to transition into fatherhood. At this rate of growing hostility, you'll turn out just like your
"Of course," Ms. Jane said, shaking herself out of a daze to open the fitting room door, "If you need any help, just let me know, okay?"
“Is everything okay, Cas? You're as white as a sheet,” he pointed out, gently caressing his knee, “Tell me what's wrong.”
Sam quickly pressed his lips to the side of her head. He swaddled her close in the cold wind of the park, wanting to comfort her and keep her calm.
Gabriel gulped again, realizing that she was talking about his daughter. Yep. Jude and Jessie were only five months apart. It wouldn't have taken long for the angels to hear about her birth either.
of bone under his knuckles that Jude snapped back into awareness. His grace returned to its harbored state but the damage was done. Jude had punched Clarence so hard in the face that he broke the guy's nose. And maybe some of his cheekbones, too.
“It's okay,” Jude said, voice no longer trembling, but steady and relaxed, “I'm not afraid. I can do this.”
Jude, Jessie, and Ollie all giggled at uncle Gabe when he made funny animal noises. Jude laughed so hard that his tummy hurt. Oh boy, uncle Gabe was so funny!
,” Sam barked, finally halting the kid’s rambling, “I’m gonna have to stop you right there. I know I said you could talk to me about anything, but having sex with my daughter doesn’t count, okay?”
Jude and Jessica both unbuckle their own safety belts and climbed out of their seats to flee the car. Castiel grabbed the decorative gift bag at his feet before exiting with them. Gabriel's Jack Russell Terrier dashed around the children as they grabbed each others' hands and waited on the sidewalk for the adults. Once Castiel was close enough, Dean slid an arm around the angel's shoulders to accompany him like a gentleman.
He patted Jessie's shoulder proudly while she hunkered down bashfully. A brief moment of silence entered the conversation as the two newlyweds looked at each other.
Clarence and Jessica both shared a small smile with each other. As dire and stressful as the situation was, it was nice to hear Rowena and Crowley sassing each other like a true mother and son.
Half way to their destination, Sam stole a quick glance in the mirror to see that Jessica and Dickie had both fallen asleep in the backseat. The warmth of the Impala's heater must have overpowered them. A smile spread on Sam's face as he studied Jessica's closed eyes and blonde hair in a messy ponytail. The sight of her sleeping peacefully reminded him of all those restless nights they shared when she was just an infant. She would wake up at one or two in the morning and let out a small lady-like cry to let everyone know that she needed something. Sam and Gabe were always able to sooth her and get her back to sleep with a few hushed words and a lullaby. Even now, it was easy to put her to sleep. And, God, she was
Gabriel smirked a little around Sam's dick, glad to hear that the kid was enjoying himself. The archangel sucked even harder and eventually reached down in his pants to fondle his balls too. He could hear Sam crunching on popcorn above him, mixed with the loud movie playing behind him. Sam rocked his hips with Gabe's mouth, obviously trying to get to an orgasm. Wanting to help the kid along, Gabe used some of his grace to kickstart the pleasure, sending pulses to Sam's brain that made him groan out loud.
Across the table, Ms. Jane waved and nodded next to uncle Cassie. Jessie couldn't believe it! They were all going to go on a fun trip together to see animals! Monkeys and pandas and elephants and tigers! Jessie couldn't wait to go! That sounded like the best gift ever! The little girl lunged forward to give her Papa a ginormous hug, holding him so tight that she could feel their graces touching. She loved her Papa so much! He was the best, most amazing Papa ever!
“G – Gabe! Ah!” Sam moaned, feeling himself inching closer and closer to the edge, “I love you so – so much, I – ! Gabe, I love – !
Gabriel grumbled out loud and sulked before reaching into his pocket. Dean watched the interaction, feeling confused. Wait, did Sam and Gabe seriously bet on the gender of the baby? Geez, was there anything those guys wouldn't bet on?!
Anger flashed on the old man's drunken face at once. He glared down at Gabriel's dog in his lap before lunging forward to clutch the front seat. The smell of whiskey on his breath could have knocked over a horse.
“Well, this morning, it felt like I had to puke,” she explained, “but nothing came out. I just felt really sick to my stomach. Then, when we ate dinner, I really
Castiel's eyes dropped down to the top of his stomach, where he caressed the tight skin. Waiting for Dean wasn't the
“Don't worry, Pops. We're gonna stop and eat a few times on the way,” Clarence promised from the passenger seat.
Jude's heart thumped hard in his chest. His Grandpa was right. Jude wouldn't have been able to burn out the Darkness if his family wasn't there. If Jude didn't hear Jessie's prayers, the sound of everyone singing, or Clarence's amazing voice, Jude probably would have given up... Still, some of the family didn't seem convinced by what Grandpa was saying. Especially not Lucifer.
“Uh, yeah. Clare and I got her some gifts a few weeks ago. I just forgot about it,” Jude admitted, “Papa, can I call you back in a little while? I’m driving right now.”
The Winchesters both raised their heads from the page to give Bobby a few surprised looks. A portal? That sounded like serious business.
“Pop, Dad, I can't find my wedding suit,” Jude huffed, his voice full of frenzy, “It was in my closet, but I just went to get it out and try it on, but it's not there anymore!”
“We just have to move you there, Jude. And that means flying,” Papa muttered quietly, looking at him pitifully, “I know you dislike the thought of flying, especially in your delicate state, but it would save a very large amount of time.”
Clarence flinched back with a grin, like he was prepared to take all the wrath Jessica's dad was going to throw at him. But Jessica knew that Clare was just saying those suggestive things to get her dad angry. Making people angry seemed to be his favorite pastime. Jessie ignored the purring tone of Clare's question but decided to answer him anyway.
“Have you ever been to Kansas?” Dean asked. “There’s a Men of Letters bunker there, and it has everything a hunter would ever need.”
Castiel noticed Dean instantly stiffen beside him and shoot a shocked glance over his shoulder. They were all watching as Gabriel's small animal dashed over to the Impala and jumped inside, straight into Gabriel's lap to sniff around. The mere act seemed to engulf Dean with rage.
Ollie suddenly huffed and crouched down near the floor. He took the time to look directly at Jess, meeting her eyes and gently placing his hand on her shoulder.
Jessica wasn't aware of anything else as she chomped her way through the fluffy, sticky pastry. The only thing she knew was that she needed to eat it as quickly as possible to appease the craving in her belly. When she eventually finished the cinnamon roll and started to lick her fingers, Jess noticed that her husband was staring at her. Ollie was giving her a strange look, like he couldn't believe what he was seeing.
That was when he heard a familiar voice. It was faint and sincere, like a gentle lullaby. Jude tried his best to wake up; to regain control of himself so that he could see whoever was speaking. But he couldn't fight the heavy Darkness over him. He was too weak.
Castiel stood impatiently at the bar, watching the burly German bartender filling the glass under the spout. The auburn liquid was flowing slowly; far too slowly for the angel's liking. There was no other soul in the bar, save Castiel and the bartender. Why was the large man pouring the alcohol with such caution? Was he deliberately attempting to lengthen Castiel's waiting time? Was the man somehow aware that Cas was in a hurry and exploiting the angel's patience on purpose?
Luckily, the black void that Sam and Dickie came through was still visible in the dark hallway. The portal was still open, and it wasn't long before Bobby and Dean stepped out from the dark abyss. The two of them were both holding knives at the ready as they walked in and glanced around. As soon as they saw Sam, they made a B-line for him.
Gabriel took the time to shake his own head before reaching out to curl his daughter's lovely blonde hair behind her ears. The act allowed him to see more of her beautiful face, which reminded him so much of Sam's. Jessie looked so much like her human dad, especially when she cried. She and Sam shared that devastatingly pitiful sad face, and seeing it broke Gabriel's heart every time.
not Sammy! Gabriel wrapped his entire arm around his husband's lengthy torso for good measure, daring anyone to take him away.
Sam's question yanked Dean out his jealous thoughts. He was back in the kitchen with his brother again, staring down at the concern on Sam's face. While Sammy searched his eyes with questioning, Dean kicked himself in his mind. It was stupid to think he didn't mean much to Sam anymore. Sam still looked up to him, right? So what if the trickster was just as important to Sam as Dean was? The Winchesters were always going to stick together. Besides, in Dean's world, Cas and Sam were on the same level too.
“Eh, don’t worry about me, kiddo. I’m an archangel. We rebound faster than hot chicks after a breakup,” The trickster replied, though he carefully sat down on the seat across from Sam like he was still anxious about his surroundings. “Did you find anything?”
“No!” Jess croaked, shaking her head as she tossed both arms around her boyfriend's large shoulders, “Ollie, it's
Obviously not wanting to be there any longer than she did, Dad and Ollie both jumped up to hold Jess's hands. Once she had a hold of her father and boyfriend, Jessica closed her eyes and pictured Bobby's kitchen again. In the same way she had teleported to Hell, Jessica flew herself back out; appearing back on Earth within seconds. Admittedly, the flight between realms did take some of her energy away. And when they reappeared back home, Jessica instantly slumped against Oliver's tall form. He, of course, wrapped his arms around her to keep her on her feet, but looked down at her with concern.
“I've... I've been through so much,” Gabriel uttered, voice low and somber, “I've seen so much sadness and death...”
“And in case you haven't heard by now, I'm literally the king of hell,” Crowley added, “Being a demon myself, I can teach you anything you'd ever need to know about what you truly are. And what you can do. Wait until you meet my personal hellhound, Juliet. Perhaps we can find you one of your own.”
“So, what about Michael?” Ollie asked, his eyes flickering between Jessie and Jude, “Is he, like, your uncle or something?”
Castiel's eyes narrowed more forcefully at the angel as he held a wobbly, blood-soaked blade in front of the whimpering baby in his arms. Metatron was right. Soon, Castiel was going to die and there would be no one to stop him from taking Dean and Cas's son for himself.
The static-like noise made Dean open his eyes to see where they were. The place looked like a hazy, abandoned movie set for an old western. Sand covered the ground, the sky was dark with overcast clouds, and hot air whipped around dust. The crackle of the Geiger counter made Dean nervous, so he attempted to hold his breath. It seemed to worry the king too, because the angel spun around to meet Dean’s sight with urgency.
He truly hoped that the sight of home would make Bobby feel better. But, apparently, it didn't help at all. If anything, the guy seemed kind of disappointed. Bobby blinked slowly out at his house in the rain as if he was staring at a graveyard rather than his own home. Dammit, Dean hated seeing that look of pain on Bobby's face. If
Dean could feel Cas's arms trembling around his torso, but he held his own limbs firmly around his angel. He knew that Cas needed support right now, especially since he was human. In return, Cas's head weakly nodded against Dean's shoulder.
Everyone in the Impala instantly glanced out the windows, all searching for a large building that resembled a power plant. Although he was trying his best to remain hopeful, Dean was a little hesitant to believe that this 'bunker' Bobby told them about would still be there. The old man said that it was built in the 1930s. Surely some kids would have found the place and vandalized it by now. Or a coven of witches could have turned it into their ritual grounds or something. There was no way an empty bunker could have been left in good enough condition to be turned into a livable home...
For over an hour, Papa took his time doing Jess's hair. He didn't use his grace at all. He just followed the exact instructions on the internet, using the tools on the vanity table like a normal human. In the meantime, he, Jess, and Jude all talked about Ollie and how cool the dance was going to be. Jessica had only seen high school dances on TV and she was so excited that she was going to actually attend one in person. Would it really be like that scene in 'Grease,' when everyone was doing the hand jive? With a live band and everything? Oh man, that would be so cool. The more she talked with Papa and Jude about the decorations and the music and the dancing, the more excited she became. By the time Papa was completely done with her hair, Jessica's hands were shaking in her lap.
Dean actually smiled at Chuck's subtle humor. He never pegged God as a joker, but Gabriel must have gotten it from somewhere, right? Dean shared one last look of understanding and hopefulness with Chuck before the guy glanced at the toddler.
Though Dean didn't know that it was said – and would probably never know – Castiel felt that Dean would eventually come to realize the honesty and meaning of the phrase in years to come. The precious boy on the bed had no idea how much was in store for him; all the love and adventure that life was going to offer him. There were so many people – so much family – he was still destined to meet, including his own son. Young Dean did have some rough times ahead, but the good certainly outweighed the bad tenfold. And for much of the time, Castiel would be right there by his side, making sure he would never face it alone...
Clare let out a slight chuckle, which kind of surprised him. Was he really laughing at his own mother's joke? The small sound made the smile return to Meg's round face – and Clare was actually glad to see it. This was a lot nicer than he thought it would be. Talking with Meg like it was a normal evening was kind of pleasant.
“There is no reason for you to apologize, Dean,” the angel interrupted, letting his hand slide all the way up to cup Dean's cheek, “It wasn't your fault. In fact, if it had not been for your instinctual actions, Jude may have been in grave danger. I'm very thankful for your hunting reflexes. It kept both of you alive.”
Jude realized that the new guy was looking directly at him when his voice faded away and he could feel embarrassment sweeping across his own face. Oh, no. Jude hated being the center of attention. Why was the new guy giving him that strange look? The man raised a hand up to pluck at his guitar case strap as he started walking toward Jude.
All the blood in Dean's face slowly drained away, leaving him pale and stunned. He felt like he was hearing his own thoughts being read out loud. It was amazing how much he and Bobby had in common...
Clarence and uncle Cas stayed in their own clothes, though. Cas didn't understand the reason for changing, and Clare had volunteered to be the designated driver so he didn't see the point in changing either. Jessie understood and respected their decisions, but it was kind of a bummer. It would have been hilarious to see uncle Cas stumbling around in heels, or watch Clare fight with a wig for the rest of the night... Once everyone was ready, they all piled into Jude's blue impala. Clarence had called Jude and asked if it was okay if they used his car, and Jude agreed – as long as the keys stayed in Clare's hands. So, with Clare driving and Rowena guiding the way, Jessica's bachelorette party migrated from the bunker to a karaoke bar just outside of town.
, but his own sadistic father as well. Clare's life was a book of sad poetry, and Meg didn't know anything about it. Jude looked to his fiance, expecting him to get upset and start the long, woeful story of his life – but he didn't. Clare just held onto his smile and nodded.
Wanting to at least inform his son that they were about to leave, Castiel ventured further into Bobby's house to find him and Clarence. The young demon's bedroom was strangely vacant, but luckily, it only took a few minutes of searching for Cas to find the two boys outside on the back porch. Jude and Clarence were perched together on the porch steps as the first few rays of daylight began to shine through the stacks of cars in the distance.
Though Castiel wanted to remain in the embrace he shared with his child, he slowly released Jude so that they could all migrate to the study. With gifts and cake in hand, all four Winchesters made their way from the garage to the library with Dean at the front. Castiel remained to the back of the group to keep an eye on Jude. His movements were slower than normal; a sign that he wasn’t feeling quite like himself. But Castiel didn’t need to see the evidence to know it was true, because he could feel Jude’s pain in the depths of his own grace.
Sam and Gabe were playfully arguing in hushed voices - like they always did. Only this time, they were wearing weird costumes. Uncle Gabe had on a cool purple suit and top hat with candy sticking out of his pockets, which made him look exactly like Willy Wonka. He was in the middle of fixing uncle Sam's long hair, which was having trouble staying in place because of the huge set of fake antlers on his head. Sam was wearing a furry brown vest too, and a touch of black paint on his nose that made him look like a real moose. On the floor, their dog Dickie was watching them. His fur was painted orange and there was a tuft of green fabric on his head, and he was dressed in an Oompa-Loompa costume. Which, surprisingly, he seemed to really like.
Jude probably added the last word because everyone was looking at him with discomfort. Dean could understand why the rest of the family didn't quite agree with Jude's choice. Michael and Adam didn't seem like the type of people that would dance at a wedding. But Jude did have a good point. It was a nice gesture to invite them, since they were, in fact, family. No matter how far away they were. Dean shared another glance with Cas, who seemed equally moved by their son's acknowledgment of their distant relatives.
The dog only gave a single bark and wagged his tail before prancing away happily. It was pretty obvious that Dickie had sabotaged Gabriel's gift on purpose because the dog wasn't showing any remorse. Maybe it was payback for that whole 'diaper' thing Gabriel did to the poor dog a few days ago... Either way, Gabriel rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers, repairing all the bottles with his grace. Dean glanced at the bottle in his hand and shook his head with a smirk before putting it back in the box.
Of course, that was the exact opposite of what Dean had been taught as a child. John Winchester didn't tolerate fear of any kind. Only self control. '
From the look on Bobby's face alone, Castiel was able to decipher his meaning. God. The only being strong enough to free Jude and put an end to this insane chaos was God. The angels' father was their only chance of succeeding... The only problem was that no one had seen or heard from him since the day of everyone's wedding.
“You've got that classic Winchester look in your eye, so I'll explain for you,” Chuck offered, stopping at the end of Dean and Cas's unmade bed, “When I'm not in this vessel – when I'm not blending in and spending time with my favorite creations – I am what the good book calls 'omnipresent'. Which means I'm everywhere, all at once. No one person can see me, but I'm there, because I'm everywhere. I know it sounds confusing, but it's the truth.”
“'Night, Cas,” Adam waved as he wheeled their luggage bags into the spare room, “See you for breakfast in the morning. Tell Dean we want pancakes.”
“For winning the local beauty contest,” Crowley growled with sarcasm, giving Dean a half glare before saying, “I'm applauding you for
“Clare, how did you do it?” Jude mumbled, searching his face, “How did you face Darkness so fearlessly?”
Dad was a little hesitant about driving up to Ollie's house. He mentioned that Ms. Jane would probably be pretty mad at him for the whole dance fiasco – and he was right. When Jess and her dads got out to knock on the door, Ms. Jane opened it with a disapproving look and mumbled a few things in Spanish. Whatever she said made Papa chuckle, so it must have been funny. Standing on the Thompson's doorstep for the second time, though, made Jessie feel weird. Man, it was like deja vu or something. Didn't Jess already do this once? And didn't it end in disaster last time? Oh no, what if it happened again? What if something bad happened on this date? Jessica's mind was suddenly a storm of doubt and fear.
