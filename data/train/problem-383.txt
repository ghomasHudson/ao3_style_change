"But it doesn't make any sense, Sherlock. Both of the victims looked as if they died willingly. It doesn't make sense to connect it to these crown jewels. We've overshot, Sherlock."
"I'll come to you. Stay where you are."
"Try to sleep, Holmes," he says coolly.
Martin placed a comforting hand on John's arm. "It's okay, John. I just wanted to know before we got involved in anything. It's easier to make things clear from the start than at the end or in the middle, you see."
"John? You're the one who's going to have to go through with this. I'd like to hear your estimation of our chances."
"Why didn't you tell me there was a problem here?" she asked Sherlock once John was done.
Father Conley had wrapped the cassock around the despairing priest and led him into the sacristy, one arm around his shoulder and the other holding the rest of his clothes.
The victim was from a well-to-do family and moved to the village from Birmingham four years ago when she married. The young widower, James Waugh, whose first wife died while giving birth to their second child, had needed a mother for the children. It was no love match. She knew nothing of farming, but apparently quite a lot about horses, and had soon taken to attending the cattle market with the local men in an advisory capacity. That made her suspicious to the womenfolk. But then she had solicited guidance from the neighbour ladies, and under their direction had laid out quite the lovely garden, thus gaining herself a couple of friends. Still, she had never been popular in the village, even if it had spoken in her favour how lovingly she took on the children of her predecessor, how attentive she was in raising them. She herself had had no issue.
"You can't just leave."
Delicate negotiations had preceded the special mission at Holloway. A skirmish for data. The Canadian secret service CSIS wanted to bring the satellite down. The British government wanted the intelligence that the CSIS had gleaned and evaluated with their confidential M2M information-gathering module. They also wanted the list with the access data for the public buildings in order to close those security gaps. That wasn't what the Candians wanted at all, especially the first part. McDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd., the company that had built the satellite – including the spying components – wanted to prevent an investigation, freedom from prosecution for their employees and management, and a media blackout. The criminal judge in London wanted all of the heads to roll, including those at Interpol. She was backed up by Mycroft, who demanded the merciless exposure of the case. Interpol stipulated that their involvement in the Copernicus project remain under lock and key. The Canadian government insisted on applying Canadian law, the British British law, and Interpol international law.
John thought he must have heard wrong. "That's completely out of the question! Why should I leave you?"
"Did you have anything to do with Rosie's abduction?" he asked harshly.
At some point, Sherlock spoke again: "If the room really is bugged, we have a problem."
My life has become cold and empty. I have no more ambition since he left. Yes. I admit it. Things are hollow without him. Life. Even more hollow. Even more trivial. A skeleton counting down the hours, its bones picked clean, the seconds chasing through it in stormy gusts. Minutes. Hours. Days. Meaningless. Day-to-day existence nothing more than tedium and disinclination. One day identical to the next. Worthless. One night identical to the next. Senseless. Disposable goods.
"You are correct, Doctor. I am able to see that," I confess.
John cursed Sherlock for never keeping him informed. Neither on personal topics nor where their work was concerned. What was going on in Meiringen? What was happening with Moriarty? Had this been a holiday at the outset, or had something else been planned all along? Was he just bait for Moriarty? Why hadn't he been told anything? He felt like an idiot dangling from a psychopath's puppet strings. Oh yes, he was angry at Sherlock!
"Thank you, Reuben," Mycroft said. "Keep us apprised."
A smile in the eyes. Affectionate, gentle.
One side street further on afforded a view of a square. People. Light. John walked toward them. A market. The market stalls were close together, packed in dirty tarps and plastic sheeting, woollen blankets, old rugs, shabby wooden walls and cardboard. Makeshift shelter against the wind and cold. Burning rubbish in old oil drums that stank more than they warmed. Thickly bundled figures eyeing the goods for sale, making a purchase here and there of frozen fish, meat, potatoes, turnips, cabbage. Hands in tattered knitted gloves exchanged crumpled bank notes for things wrapped in newspaper.
"You'll have it all behind you soon enough," Boon tells her comfortingly. "You'll be married before you can even see the baby."
The heat outside. Sherlock only ventured out into it grudgingly. The few minutes it took to get to the shops were enough to have him soaked with sweat. The air conditioned coolness of the supermarket, barely any customers. Pleasant. Sliced bread. Fruit. Some vegetables (only those that could be eaten raw). Milk. Yogurt? Why not. A little cheese. Frozen pizza. Biscuits. Wasn't hard. The stationer's across the way where he could buy staff paper. It was air-conditioned too, if not as much as the supermarket. A reason to linger, have a look around. Maybe life in the real world was easier than he'd imagined. Maybe it was good to simply do what needed to be done.
They looked at each other. A lingering gaze. Sherlock lost himself in the grey eyes, the warmth in their depths. Like a calm lake, its surface rippled by a light breeze, the morning sun scattering light across it and making it sparkle. Then a gust of wind suddenly whipped up waves, imprinting the water with a dark, moving pattern that spread quickly, unstoppable, engulfing everything in its path. John let it happen, and Sherlock saw his eyes fill with desire, overflowing, and withstood it. Withstood it spilling over onto him, hot and sudden, seizing his body without there being anything he could do about it.
"It's not enough yet, John," Sherlock said quietly. "We'll have to have a few more sessions with Nora. She has a private practise. I've set up additional therapy sessions with her. If you agree."
"I don't know if he will. I'll talk to him. I just wanted to put out some feelers, get to know the brotherhood before we decide how our life together should continue. Whether we should set aside our vocations. Ethan Tierney made me aware that there are other options than living in sin."
John got tiredly to his feet, put on some clothes and joined Sherlock. They walked through Regent's Park, shoulder to shoulder, sticking close together. It was an early summer day. They watched the ducks at the pond, and the children playing with pebbles on the shore. The sun slanted through the leaves of the trees, shining in their oversensitive eyes. They sat down on a bench by the edge of the lake and looked out at the water. The wind made the leaves of the oak tree rustle above them, and the surface of the water crinkle in a fine-lined, symmetrical pattern. The air smelled of summer and approaching heat as it brushed their faces. They leaned against each other where they sat. John had felt his way into the pocket of Sherlock's coat. Their hands were firmly interlaced in the shelter of the cloth.
She turned around and went to the violin case that lay on a shelf beside the bed, took out the instrument and the bow, and returned with them to the glass partition.
"Let's set each other free," John said at some point that evening. "Your mission will be dangerous. You should concentrate on it. There's no point in you expending time and energy on us meeting. It would be a risk every time. And it would be painful. For both of us. Let's be reasonable, Sherlock. You'll be dead to me. I'll mourn for you. When you come back, we'll start again."
he'd asked, wary, and Mary had fallen silent. Their gazes had met. Sober and lingering. Like now.
They smiled at each other. John reached for the wine glasses on the table and handed one to Sherlock. They drank quietly, sinking back into the cushions, sinking into each other, and Sherlock did what he had wanted to for so long: he put his arm around John's shoulders and held him.
"Talk to John."
"Shall I call back later?"
"From myself," he answered.
John's voice was like bitter gall. It hit Sherlock full force. A heavy lump in his chest squeezing his breath out. Sherlock left the flat quickly, without saying good-bye. He went down the stairs, pushed open the door at the bottom, fled out into the rainy night. The door closed behind him, locking automatically. Sherlock ran out onto the street, heedless, leaving the house behind. The night air burned in his lungs. Inside him was a jumble of thoughts and emotions. And the knowledge that what he was doing was wrong. He shouldn't walk away. This wasn't about hurt feelings. Those were the wrong priorities. This was about Mary and Sophie. It was a matter of life and death, and he needed John. Sherlock slowed his steps, then stopped. Hesitated. John was hurt, under a lot of stress, and striking out at everything. That was fine. He would have to put up with it. He owed John that much. Not to walk away now. Sherlock turned around and went back, rang up to John's flat. Waited. No reaction. He rang again, holding the button down for a long time. Nothing. He took out his phone and entered John's number. John didn't accept the call.
Tristram swallows over a big lump in his throat. "I think..." he starts, and has to clear his throat before continuing. "I think I might have messed everything up."
If he'd been a puppet master, he would have made John get up and leave, that being the quickest and easiest way to end this situation. If he'd been a soothsayer, he would have supposed John would say something comforting or reasonable or even humorous.
Sherlock glanced off to the side, then shook his head. "No."
That does make John look at Tristram, the surprise clear on his face. "Your mother- Sorry, okay." He adjusts his expression to make it appear thoughtful instead. "Drust... That's not so bad. Although..." He leans in to speak confidentially. "I do like Tristram better, too." He sits back again and puts the ointment away. "Do you, er... have a middle name?" he asks, as if he's just making conversation, but Tristram can tell he's pretty curious.
Sherlock shrugged and drank the tea. For some reason, it tasted especially good now, its warmth spreading through his chest and settling comfortably in his stomach.
"She's had eight years to-" Doctor Watson presses his lips together and looks away.
"Explanations. Now." Lestrade paced in front of Sherlock, John and Molly in his office.
"John is helping me with a case. It may get quite late."
It was just a stupid song. Irrelevant. Immaterial.
"White noise machine," Sherlock reminded him, which for some reason they both found incredibly funny and set off a fresh round of laughter. Or maybe it was the physical exertion which had allowed the release of whatever tension they'd both been feeling through the day. It hadn't been unpleasant or anxious, but definitely palpable. A pressure, from both inside and out. To meet expectations, not to disappoint. Not to be disappointed. Not to cross the invisible line. Had they crossed it now? John thought they had. They must have done. Sherlock's heart thumping under John's arm. His breath still smelling faintly of toothpaste, puffing against John's face. All John would have to do was tilt his head up a couple of centimetres. It was darker here at night than it was in their flat on Baker Street, but he could still see the gleam of Sherlock's eyes, the pale shape of his face, the darker smear of his lips. So close.
The realisation makes him uncomfortable. Angelo's is for him and his father, not for Doctor Watson. It's not that he doesn't like Doctor Watson, or that he doesn't want his father and Emily's father to get on together. He just doesn't want his father to do things with him that he usually only does with Tristram.
At lunch, Sherlock's indecision only grew, however. Speedy's did good business during the midday rush, and it was crowded enough that Sherlock and John kept being jostled against each other as they stood in the queue to place their orders. By the third time, Sherlock was becoming so warm he had to remove his scarf.
He pulls back to see there's blood smeared on John's upper lip and cheek. Sherlock's blood. It will have to serve, in lieu of any more overtly possessive gesture. He scrabbles at John's flies, his fingers uncoordinated in the aftermath of his system reset. John chuckles and doesn't help him, which Sherlock first thinks is rather unsporting of him, but then recalls the taped fingers of his left hand. John does help, then, once the button is open and the zip is down, getting up on his knees to work his jeans and pants down one-handed past his hips, just far enough to expose his penis. It juts out at an angle from his body and already has beads of clear fluid welling up from it. Sherlock's mouth starts watering in anticipation.
"Kids are watching telly. Think we can strike lunch for today, Irene stuffed them full of sweets," he grumbles. "Any news?" He sits down, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees.
"Hey, I don't-" John touches Sherlock's shoulder. "You're not disappointed, are you? I was enjoying it. Quite a lot. Maybe tonight we could go a little slower though?"
Sherlock was surprised that John had agreed so readily, but he wasn't about to argue the point. "Good. And what should they do during the song, then? Wiggle their toes?"
"I bet she was pretty too," Emily muses, referring to Tristram's mother. Tristram has no way of judging so he doesn't say anything.
"I'm sorry," he says in a small voice. He can't even look at her. Now she won't want to be his friend.
John shakes his head and looks away, but when he raises his eyes to Sherlock's again, it's with a wry smile. "It's one hell of a mating dance, I'll give you that."
"Is it about the lady from breakfast?" Emily asks. Tristram already knows the answer to that before Doctor Watson says it.
As the situation became clear despite everyone talking at once, Sherlock despaired of the general intelligence of humanity. Obviously the children were fine. They'd been with him and John the entire time. It wasn't even six o'clock, and the children hadn't missed any lessons or appointments. When he was their age, as long as he was present for at least one meal a day and at bedtime, no one much cared where or how he spent his time. If the police had been summoned every time he took longer than an hour getting home from school, they might as well have assigned an officer permanently to the Holmes household.
Clothes would be preferable. -SH
Tristram has no reason to doubt it, but when Doctor Watson goes into the bathroom, Tristram gets up and peeks past the half-open bedroom door. Indeed, the back of Father's head, his shoulders, and one bare leg are visible sticking out from the pile of twisted bedclothes. Tristram can't see his face, but he's not moving, other than the very slight rise and fall of his back as he breathes. Tristram watches him for a good, long while, but the rhythm never falters. If he's faking, he's very convincing.
John seemed to be struggling with the same problem. "That is so not on," he said, but his mouth curled with amusement even as he curved one hand around her breast and caressed the material of her bra with his thumb.
Doctor Watson gawps at him a bit, then says, "You- No, you can change that. No suite. No, wait, please," he says to the luggage man, gesturing for him to stop loading the bags onto the trolley. "Excuse us. Excoozay." Doctor Watson pulls Father aside out of earshot, looking rather grim.
"A medical man?" At his nod, she smiles, glancing at him from the corner of her eye. "And military too, I see. Yes, I can see why he would be interested in you. You understand what I mean, then, about pink. It's the colour of scars, mucous membranes, and orifices. I don't know why some people want to drape their little girls in it. It's obscene, if you think about it."
Grandmother smiles. "Intellectual pursuits have always been highly prized in our family. It stands to reason that Sherlock finds gratification in exercising his mind."

"If they did, mine would be a meddlesome, self-righteous, mid-level bureaucrat with a prop umbrella and an overinflated sense of his own importance."
"That was all down to you, not Sherlock," John punches out, stabbing a finger in Moriarty's direction.
Uncle Mycroft sets up the music and turns on the metronome - slower than the piece would be played in concert, but still fast enough to be challenging for Tristram - then counts down one measure to start. Tristram tries to keep his eyes focused on his own fingers, but he's distracted by Emily hanging over the piano, watching their hands, and he stumbles a few times.
John stayed with the class in the afternoon, helping with the lessons where he could. When the bell rang at the end of the day, he stopped by Sherlock's desk before going out to help the children with their coats.
Sherlock holds his right arm across his body so that John, on his left, can see the phone. The angle is less than practical, so he edges in until he's nearly behind John and puts his left hand on his shoulder. John's stance is stiff, but he reaches up with his left hand to tilt the screen in order to get a better view. His fingers overlap Sherlock's on the back of the phone.
John grasped blindly at Sherlock, manhandling him by whatever body parts he could reach to pull him down and hold him against his chest. Sherlock could feel John's heart racing - or was that his own heart? John didn't move, just held Sherlock tight and pressed a long, firm kiss into his hair. Sherlock would happily have let the moment go on longer, listening to John's breathing come back to normal, enjoying the odd, pleasurably achy, reflexive contractions of his now-empty hole. He didn't like the feeling of the liquefied lubricant oozing out, although he considered whether it might not be more palatable if it were mixed with John's sperm (mental note: have mutual testing done at soonest possible opportunity). As it wasn't, he felt around until he came up with an article of clothing - his pants, as it turned out - and gave himself a cursory wipe-down.
Sherlock spreads his fingers to allow John's to slot down in between them. "I would advise against it. At least until this is dealt with."
"I'll do what I can, Sherlock. Take care of yourself."
Since Sherlock didn't respond to that, John added, "I'll soften Mycroft up for it. After all, Sergej is sort of my son too, isn't he?"
John lowered himself to sit next to him on the blanket. "It's fine, Sherlock. You don't need to do anything, you know. You don't owe me anything. It's in the past. You were a kid. It's all fine."
It is dark. An owl cries somewhere. The sound of a horse's hooves. It is approaching at a gallop. The horse is tired and wheezing. Inspector Schofield nudges me. I nod to him. We have concealed ourselves in the hedgerow. From here, we can see Boon's house. Watson and Constable Hartley are covering James Waugh's farm. I didn't know which of the two would make the journey: Waugh or Boon.
John pulled on the cassock. His hands were shaking. He was all mixed up inside; confused. He felt insecure, pressured. He'd just returned to the guesthouse. It was still dark, but the sun would be up soon. Lauds would be starting in the church in few minutes. He'd promised Gerome he'd be there. But he was still with Sherlock. His body still vibrating with what they'd done, overflowing with pleasure and bonding hormones. His genitals still hot from the unaccustomed use. His mind was empty, his heart churning and so full it felt as if it would burst. John was afraid of going to church like this. So far removed from calm and reverence. The others would notice.
Mycroft turned now, giving John a curious once-over from head to foot as if he were laying eyes on him for the first time.
"You have no right to see Sherlock's patient file," Dave said as he put the page in its place. He still sounded calm, but John could hear the tension in his voice. "You also have no right to be in this room. The sign clearly says it's for staff only."
"You're mad, Sherlock," John whispered. "How can anyone come up with music like that?"
"There isn't anything further we can do as far as we can see," she said. Her tone was professional. "The fever is rising aggressively. We've tried everything we can to lower it but his body isn't reacting to the treatments and drugs anymore. We can't stabilise him. I'm sorry."
"If I recall, we did promise."
Eurus looked him over sceptically. And was that amusement on her face?
"So you rang Mycroft."
He shouted it out to the surroundings, the mountain, the valley, the solitude. Then he sat down, drained. Let himself collapse onto the bench in front of the house. Defeated. Either Sherlock came back to him or it was too late. A broken heart can't heal any more. An open hand doesn't grasp for threads. So easy, it was so easy sometimes. John closed his eyes, tried not to let that searing pain in his chest tip over, not to let it slip past that limit. He needed to endure it. He forced himself to remain calm. Forced himself to let the despair out of the narrow prison of his chest, out into the rest of his body, to let his body help bear it. Heavy fatigue. Exhaustion. Numbness quickly spread through him. Resignation.
The brief illusion of having been a family. Mary and John and he and the baby. A sense of home. Broken in his hand like a piece of fine-spun glass that shattered when you tried to hold it, its shards piercing the skin and boring into the flesh, making it hurt and bleed. Scabby, infected, pus-filled, unable to heal because tiny splinters were still embedded.
And I said to her, "We still love each other."
My trousers chafe against my prick as I walk. I am perspiring. And my thoughts refuse to be recalled from the landscapes through which they wander. It is John. It is always John. Ever since we have allowed what the law does not, my body has demanded its right, and my mind is slow to remonstrance. Especially not out here, in the midst of such a profusion of sensuality. I set my hopes on the cooling effects of the water. Knowing at the same time that I am deceiving myself. I set my hopes on John. That he will follow me to the hidden, shadowy places beneath the willows. This is what it has come to. My mind resigns itself to the ungovernable drives of my body.
"What did they do with you, Sherlock? What was the psychotherapy about?"
"And who are you?" Sherlock asked as he followed the man into the living room.
John turned onto his back with a sigh, surrendered himself to Sherlock, to his hands, his erotic explorations. Sherlock stroked John's stomach, felt beneath his hands as John's breaths came faster, deeper; pale, thick pubic hair, dampness in the creases of his groin, firm thigh muscles. Sherlock moved his hands between John's legs, the skin hot and lightly furred, his perineum moist, his testicles soft. John's penis lay erect on his abdomen. Sherlock picked it up with one hand, stroked down its length, fascinated. It got even harder at the touch of his fingers, causing his own cock to swell noticeably. John moaned when Sherlock ran his tongue across the exposed glans, exploring the texture of the skin down his entire length, intoxicated by the surge of arousal that sprang from John over to him.
"You two wait right here for me after school, all right?" he admonishes them. He says it kindly, but Tristram's stomach twists at the memory of what happened the last time. There is no way he would go with anyone else this time, not even Mrs Hudson. He nods solemnly.
"Um. I think I'll see if I can help your dad with that turkey," he all but blurted. John had to fairly extricate himself from between the wall and Sherlock, ducking his head and exiting the room quickly before... he didn't know what, before something happened that he couldn't go back on. Behind him, he heard another tinny plong sound from the violin.
"John not with you?" Lestrade leans back to look out into the hall of the dingy council flat. It's empty but for a forensics tech in disposable blue coveralls grumbling to a jaded uniform.
Sherlock gathered all of his willpower and shifted his hips away from John while putting pressure on his shoulder to indicate John should lift up. "I'll be right back," he murmured, lifting his head to steal some more kisses.
"Quite." Holmes let go of me, leaving me with only the ghost of his fingers on my skin. "Well, I believe you'll live, Watson." He stood up and wiped his hands on a towel.
"Sure, Dad," Emily says. She ducks under his arm to go back into the dining room, but he scoops her up and cradles her, as if she were a baby, even though her legs hang down way past his arms. Tristram expects her to squirm and try to get away because she's too big for that, but instead she kind of melts down against him and puts her arms around his neck. He leans in to nuzzle her face. "I love you, Ems," he says quietly.
"That's not the point! If he lives, he's got twice as much reason to come after us now, with the full strength of the organisation behind him!"
'Did John give you my passport?' he asked. After all the fuss John made about not wanting Irene to take him - and going to the extra trouble of having another passport sent - Tristram found it odd that John would have voluntarily surrendered it to Irene.
"Don't be like that, you know why -"
"--and this whole thing between you and me, what has that been?" John flicks a finger between them. His expression is unhappily close to mirroring Sherlock's. "Just a way of passing the time until he was ready for your big date? Need someone to practise on, did you?"
My eye mechanically skimmed the name and dates on the monument, already becoming bored and sliding away before being caught by the last line carved in relief into the granite: FRIEND - WIFE - MOTHER. I reeled. There had been no mention of a child, not in Mycroft's missive informing me of Mary Watson's passing nor in her obituary, which I had looked up as soon as I set foot in London. Was it being raised by a relative?
"What is it?" he asked testily.
That gets his attention. Father blinks down at the key, then shoves it back in Doctor Watson's direction. "Keep it."
He nods. "A mother and three babies. I fed them cake," he adds proudly, then remembers his promise not to tell about seeing the bodyguard. Surely Emily doesn't count, though. She can't get the man in trouble. Still, better not to mention it. It's not like it matters.
Here's a picture of the ruins of St. Michael's Cathedral in Coventry, which served as the venue for the play in the movie: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coventry_Cathedral_ruins.jpg
"This is my room," John says stupidly.
"John," Mycroft says, trying to mediate.
The driver touched his hat and tapped the reins to his horses' backs to set them on their way.
&&&&&&
John chuckled and picked up a packet from the dispenser on the table. "How many?"
John stayed with Sherlock through the next quiz round, moving his chair around to sit on the same side of the table so they could both see the screen and reach the input device. John sat back and slowly drained the rest of his beer, commenting or making suggestions, laughing and commiserating. SassyFox continued to make progress through her chips. WestHamSucks had left, and FridayNightLights became a contender. Sherlock came in third for the round, even with John's help, but it didn't matter. Because John was here with him, a solid warmth at his side. Even if they weren't touching, he could feel it. Not his body heat, but his affection and good will, his happiness and quiet satisfaction in sharing this moment of banality with Sherlock. Just being together. Friends. Best friends? Somethings.
"Coming?" John asked, giving him a bemused look.
John throws the used gauze away and takes out a tube of ointment. "So how about you? I never asked you what you like to be called. Emily always calls you Tris, so I assumed that was okay. But do you prefer Tristram?" he asks as he swabs some of the white cream around on Tristram's raw skin.
John chuckles.
"Father!" Tristram screams back, tears spilling over onto his cheeks. It's dark, and he can't see anything, and everything hurts so much.
"We need to enter the final code, otherwise we'll be registered. Let me get on."
"Unfortunately, there's an awkward little automatism I feel you should know about," Mycroft said. "Every flight on whose passenger list you appear seems to have a bomb on board."
"No."
"It looks like you're doing well," she said with a smile.
Then he climbed out the window into the night.
Sherlock searched the woman's incredibly lucid eyes, the deep serenity, the smile they contained. She and John were watching each other, a message Sherlock wasn't included in, one he couldn't comprehend. John's fingers still firmly ensconced in the material of his sleeve.
Dr Melicia Kenny burst out laughing. A strand of her kinky grey hair had fallen out of the band she'd used to tie it together at the nape of her neck. The loose hair dangled in her face. Her green-blue eyes sparkled with uninhibited amusement and numerous creases appeared around her eyes.
"You include me in the investigation. That's the condition. I don't care how."
"Thank you," Sherlock said sincerely, without remarking on her last comment. He knew her words could have been misinterpreted and that the correction was therefore appropriate. He looked over at John. John shook his head, just barely. No words were necessary between them. John didn't know the woman she'd described.
A fine glass blade. The insult unforgotten. Another one added. All of the tiny poison darts. Humiliations he'd inflicted on John. Thorns in his flesh. John added them to the untold horrors, the catastrophes, the hopeless mountain of disappointments and grief.
John hadn't had time to answer that. The taxi had arrived and they'd got in. Now they were stuck in traffic. Sherlock's hand resting warmly in his.
"Michael was my friend."
"Sherlock," John said.
"I don't know it for sure," Sherlock had whispered, uncertain, a warm puff of air on John's mouth.
Mycroft's motto had lost any trace of cynicism.
"Okay. Can you take this thing off me?" John made a jerky motion with his chin toward the strait jacket holding his arms in place against his body. It seemed to be aggravating him no end; he'd been twisting around in it the whole time.
"That's not important right now. Don't worry about it," John replied.
"Do you hear me, John?" Sherlock asked with concern.
"Who?"
"John. The doorbell rang and he went to the door to discuss something with the neighbour. I used the opportunity to peek into his bedroom. That's all. I was there as part of an investigation, John, not a social call."
"No. I had taken medication. I wasn't able to think clearly. He took the candle and left."
"Why not? I have time and I'm the perfect candidate for the mission."
The photograph was of the body of a young man, a student. John leaned his shoulder against Sherlock as he leafed through the autopsy report. Sherlock wasn't sure whether John was even aware of it. But Sherlock noticed. He didn't react to it, didn't move away. It was nice. Having John close was nice. John's warmth seeped through to Sherlock's body. He was more aware of it than ever, since that hug. He longed for John's warmth. In every sense of the word.
The funeral was very small and intimate. The service short. Mycroft said a few words. Sherlock played the Adagio from Bach's Sonata Number 1 in G Minor. As he played, he thought about the wonderful music he'd played with Eurus, the way their violins' voices had entwined and caressed each other, the wordless understanding and harmony. A sense of togetherness that hadn't been possible for so many years. The happiness therein as unexpected and unpredictable as Eurus herself.
Sherlock flinched back, shuddering. A sense of foreboding reached for him like a sticky black mass, squeezing off his throat and threatening to suffocate him.
"Clues for what?" John asked.
"The best place to be. What seems to be the problem?"
"I don't know," Sherlock said, pained.
"Yes, see you tomorrow."
John rested a hand on Sherlock's arm. "Do you need anything?"
John was shocked at how empty his voice sounded. Sherlock's eyes remained on him for several seconds, probing. Then Sherlock slowly shook his head, stood up, walked over to John and stopped right in front of him.
John didn't answer, refused to acknowledge Sherlock. It was good in the emptiness he'd settled into, the only thing he could bear. Complete withdrawal into himself.
When Sherlock woke up, he needed a moment to orientate himself. He was lying on the couch, it was dark, and the phone in his hand was chiming and vibrating. John. Nearly midnight. A call. Sherlock hesitated when he remembered that he'd sent John a text confessing his love. Talk to John now? What should he say? How would John react? Damn it! He was in over his head with this one. He waited so long that the call was redirected to voice mail. Too late.
John snorted and didn't answer. He hadn't thought about it yet. Things were good the way they were for him. Baker Street, Sherlock, the surgery, a case now and then. There was no reason for him to change any of that. He didn't want to change things.
John choked on his nausea, but swallowed it down with effort.
"John?" Sherlock turned over, half asleep. A hand brushed John, wrapped around his shoulder. "You need to sleep, John," Sherlock whispered. "Just sleep, come on."
Sherlock closed his eyes and the theme of his music inundated him, along with the realisation that John's absence had taken the rug out from under his feet, disordered his emotions and unsettled him. Their closeness became tangible with physical distance, and it hurt. The connection. The responsibility that went with it.
"I'll inundate you with texts," Sherlock said with a wan smile. "But you're not to answer. Promise."
The intensity of their union was stronger than anything they'd imagined. They held onto each other, clung to each other, tight and deeply connected, filling each other up, completely, inside each other, a closeness and intimacy that nearly drove them mad, gasping, on the edge of conscious thought, shocked at the irresistible power of what was happening between them. Knowing that this incomprehensible, boundless intimacy changed everything.
Sherlock stopped abruptly. In the middle of the pedestrian crossing. He stood there as if nailed to the spot, in the midst of the stream of people surging across the street. John grabbed his arm.
Sherlock stared at him. "Very good!" he said approvingly and held up his index finger. "Can I talk to Rose Granby?"
"What are priests supposed to do if they miss it?"
"Are you going to forbid me?" John asked tiredly, with an undertone of aggression and disappointment.
"Peter died in the gardens. Where exactly?"
"I printed everything out for you. These are translations of rituals from old manuscripts. I went to see Professor Sheppard. She's an expert in this area and translated a couple of relevant texts for me. It's going to surprise you."
"Yes."
"We can ask Molly to perform an autopsy if you'd like," John said. He covered Eurus's neck with the white sheet again after Sherlock had withdrawn his trembling hand and clung once more to John's arm.
The taxi had driven off. John had gone out into the cold and rainy autumn night, Saturday evening in Bury St Edmunds, people on the street, the pubs full. He'd sat down in a restaurant, a free table for two by the wall, ordered a salad and an omelet and an ale to go with it. He was tired and hungry. He needed a break from all of the intense moments. From the ritual, the club, Martin, Sherlock. It felt good to just sit there, to eat and not say anything, to be alone, to think about the events of the past few hours and days.
"Yes, you are," Watson says.
"John! What a surprise. What can I do for you?"
"Sister Immaculata is innocent," Magdalena said several hours later in the interrogation room. "I bought the rosary at a flea market, took out the stones and asked Immaculata to mend the crucifix with the coloured gems. She did it, no questions asked. She used to be a goldsmith and still had the tools because she sometimes helped out fixing things. She had no idea what she was doing."
"Gentlemen," said a deep voice. "I'm sorry, but you can't stay here."
Mycroft didn't come himself. He just sent a car and chauffeur to pick Sherlock up. Sherlock didn't take anything with him, not even his laptop. A sign that he wasn't going to be gone long. That placated John a bit. Sherlock hugged him before going out to the waiting limousine, hugged him tenderly and longer than expected, ran his hand through John's hair and kissed him gently if briefly on the mouth.
Rosie had moved briefly when he'd propped up his injured leg, but not awakened. Good. It was still pouring outside, but the thunder and lightning had let up. It wasn't exactly dry in the old factory – or whatever this place had once been. It was an abandoned ruin now. Sherlock sat leaning on the bare concrete wall. He'd found a scrap of sheet metal lying around and pushed it up against the wall to sit on, as the ground was wet. Less than a metre away, rain dripped from the leaky ceiling onto the filthy concrete floor, which was littered with demolition rubble. Sherlock had dipped his handkerchief into the rivulet and squeezed the rainwater out into Rosie's mouth. She had sucked greedily on the handkerchief, clearly thirsty. He was too, so he'd done the same for himself. He'd fed Rosie a couple of biscuits he'd taken from the old camper van they'd locked him up in. They must have been ancient, and had assimilated the musty odour of the rotting motorhome. But they calmed Rosie's stomach.
Mr Holmes looked apologetic. "I'm sorry, John, you must stop me when I get too personal. It's the age, it makes one sentimental. Thinking about one's mortality. One's legacy."
"Remove your jacket, waistcoat and shirt," was his first command.
John wasn't gay. Sherlock wasn't sure that he was wholly bisexual either, in the sense of finding the male form and male attributes generally appealing and arousing in the same way he did with women. His eyes didn't linger on attractive men the way they did on women. He licked his lips far less often in the presence of a sexually available male than a female. Sherlock had never found gay porn in his browser cache. He'd never responded with the slightest bit of encouragement to flirtation attempts by other men. And yet here John was, in bed with Sherlock, the evidence all but incontrovertible that he was not an absolute Kinsey zero.
Sherlock pointed at the pocket John had his phone in. "It's not yours, the inscription says 'Harry Watson from Clara'. It's a recent model, a young man's gadget, not your father, then, a cousin or brother. I say brother, as it's a rather expensive gift for a cousin. The case is covered in scratches where he had trouble getting the power cable plugged in: shaky hands, either a nerve disorder or alcoholic. The second's more likely."
Sherlock looks up, nonplussed. "You think they're making a statement about what we get up to in the bedroom?"
Emily's snow globe passes muster easily. Tristram shows John the cards, and John says he thinks they're a very good idea for Mrs Hudson. Irene tells Tristram the cards are for a special Swiss game called 'yass' - or at least that's what it sounds like - and that she'll show him how to play so that he can teach Mrs Hudson.
"Yes, but not immediately. There, just-" He stoops down so his head is at the same level as John's and their shoulders are touching. "There."
http://www.arkive.org/cuckoo/cuculus-canorus/image-A23152.html
She wanders over to the table and hooks her red-varnished fingernail under the handle of the lid covering the special message for Father. Tristram doesn't get further than thinking that Father will be unhappy if she picks it up when the door opens and Father's voice says sharply, "Don't touch that!"
"What the hell does that mean now?"
"There were at least nine armed gangsters in the next room," Sherlock hisses. "The window shattering was rather loud, I couldn't exactly hang around to -"
"Wh- Right, okay," John says, although he doesn't look like he buys it completely. "And he knows all about Tris's mother? Irene, she goes by now?"
"I think my shin's bleeding."
Sherlock would mind Watson on the days when John worked. He had always done most of his casework from home anyway, and much of the legwork for the rest could be farmed out to Wiggins and his other contacts around the city, or saved until the evenings or weekends. Mrs Hudson was generally willing to spring in for an hour or two until John got home, on those occasions when Lestrade or Hopkins called with something urgent. And they had found a good, steady babysitter, a former nanny to the royal family with training as a bodyguard, whom they could schedule to come when they knew in advance that they'd both need to be out for a longer period.
"We can do the entire trip in silence if you want," John says after a while. "Only four hours to go."
Emily turns the book round so they can see the cover, holding her finger in between the pages so they don't lose their place. As Tristram said, there is clearly a picture of Harry, on a broomstick, competing in one of the Triwizard Tournament tasks.
"Yes, but look how this was done." Father gestures down at the open box, where Tristram can now see the eye, packed in plastic, staring up at the ceiling. Father's done things with eyes - both animal and human - before, so this isn't anything shocking. "Precise. Neat. They took exactly what they needed, no more, no less. They're not going to do anything messy, and they're not going to repeat themselves. No bombs, no kidnappings-"
Her lip curls as well, but the effect is more one of smugness than sneering. "Doctor Watson says... well, nothing about you, really. He did ask after Tristram." Her head tilts toward Tristram, who's still huddled on the floor. She smiles at him, but it's a fake-sad smile, and Tristram thinks it's meant more for Father than for him. And while he's flattered that Doctor Watson wanted to know how he was doing, Tristram finds it odd that he didn't say anything about Father. Did they have a row because of Tristram being shot?
John let out a long breath. "She felt guilty herself. Our father blamed our mother for Harry being gay." There was a long pause, Sherlock letting John figure it out. Letting him decide how much he wanted to lay out in the open. Finally, John went on: "I suppose at some level it all ties in. You know, to my... I only dated women, you know? Except that's not true. Well, dated is the wrong word." This shouldn't be so hard. He was lying in bed with a man, had acknowledged him publicly and privately as his significant other. He loved him, deeply, in a way he wasn't sure he'd ever loved another person before. There was a sexual layer too, regardless of what manner they acted on it, that attraction was there, undeniable.
John shook his head. "They should. I didn't stop him. I could have, at any point. I knew what was going on, but I was thinking with my dick."
Tristram could beg off and say he wants to go to sleep directly, but despite his mixed feelings about Doctor Watson, he doesn't want to be rude to Emily. And it won't take any effort on his part if Doctor Watson is doing the reading. He doesn't even really have to listen. The only problem is... Tristram shoots a glance at Emily. He doesn't want her to get in trouble. But Doctor Watson won't know that he and Emily started reading the book together earlier. Emily, still crouched next to him, just raises her eyebrows at him as if to say, 'It's your call.'
Tristram rotates his left shoulder. His back is sore, true, but he didn't connect that with pulling the suitcase. It's hurt since he was shot. Although that's not from the bullet; it's from all the glass that got stuck in his back from the broken window. He shrugs. "It's fine."
"But Mary and Joseph got married and kissed, and we're all pretending to be Mary and Joseph, so we're supposed to," Preeti insisted.
"Sherlock, where are you going?" Doctor Watson bellows, right in Tristram's ear, but Father's already out the door. "Fuck!" Doctor Watson swears with feeling, slamming his hand on the floor next to Tristram's head. Tristram's crying in earnest now. He tries not to, but everything hurts so much, and Father simply left!
She looks unhappy, but doesn't push the point. "I just want to know what they're doing," she says in a small voice, and he knows she doesn't mean whether they're kissing or arguing, but whether they're safe.
"Just you and me? We need the kids, and for that we need Greg's permission. Not that I expect you understand the concept. In addition to the fact that we haven't any place to put it on, costumes, lights, sound... Unless you've gotten your brother on board after all?" He was clearly aiming for scathing sarcasm, but he landed somewhere in the vicinity of not daring to hope. It might just be close enough.
Sherlock gave him a questioning look.
John looked up at him, a sad smile hovering on his lips. "Sherlock. You're leaving out one very important point."
"I apologize, but I find that my interest has exceeded that which I feel comfortable displaying," I said in what I hoped was a gracious manner, including the surrounding guests in my admission.
John steps onto the chairs and clambers up the ladder. He emerges on the roof of the stadium. The wind is a steady flow of cold and damp on his face. Sherlock is standing a few metres away, leaning on one of the thick white struts that criss-cross each other around the circumference of the roof, and looking out at the cityscape.
John ignored him and continued speaking to Moriarty. "Yes. In fact, he's written an entire original score."
The omega had now been released from his bonds, and his alpha was helping him down from the table with the assistance of a slim, flame-haired young omega woman. She might have been pretty were it not for the pinched set of her pale face and the marks which only years of hard, sinful living can leave behind. She bore a white sheet, which she draped around the male omega's shoulders. As it settled, I noticed that he wore a collar around his neck similar to the one Holmes had had me put on him. It was not identical, however, being broader and brown. The alpha had no collar at all, and the female omega - Kitty Winter, I presumed - displayed a pretty silver trinket gleaming proudly around her slender neck.
"It would involve me asking a favour of Mycroft."
He must have looked as vulnerable as he felt, because John's expression softened and he said, "That's not a 'no', Sherlock." He sat up and patted his hair down. "That's a 'there are still some things we need to talk about'."
"Because people are idiots," Father scoffs, going back to the table. He sits down in the armchair Tristram was in before - the other one being full of cushions from the couch - and turns on his computer.
"Yeah, no. I wouldn't have either. It sounds like they were expecting me, though, with the sniper set up across the street. How'd they know I'd be there if not for a medical emergency?"
I fudged with the rail passes. In fact, you can buy a pass for 20 francs valid for one year that enables children to ride for free when accompanied by one of their parents, and you don't need a photo for that. But I wanted photos of the children for something that will come later. Not a big deal, but I just thought this was a neat way of slipping it in.
Tristram isn't even looking at Emily's father when it happens; he's trying to get the little pat of butter unwrapped with one hand, and then it's as if someone has clapped a bell jar down over their table, and Tristram can't hear anything but Doctor Watson's silence. He freezes, becoming aware of a faint scent of perfume, floating so lightly on top of the smells of coffee and fresh bread and cocoa from their breakfast that he half fancies he's imagining it.
Sherlock looks overcaffeinated and hyperaware, his cheeks bright with colour. Not at all like a man should look at four a.m., especially one whose son was almost killed just a few hours earlier.
This was a mistake. He should call it off, Sherlock thought as he stood in front of the mirror and adjusted the sit of his jacket. He didn't even know what this was supposed to be. A strategy session to hoodwink Mycroft? A working dinner to discuss the script? Should he bring his laptop? Or had he unwittingly set himself up for one of those excruciating social encounters in which two individuals assess each other for compatibility, with an eye toward the possibility of engaging in sexual acts? He didn't know which of those options he dreaded - definitely dreaded - most.
"Hello, who's this then?" John asked with deceptive mildness. Sherlock hadn't even noticed him coming back with the drinks. He accepted one of the glasses and took a big sip.
He found Mr Holmes sitting on a stool, hunched over the workbench with several pieces of wood laid out in front of him. It looked like he was piecing another birdhouse together. He straightened when John entered, wincing a bit.
Thanks to my dedicated beta readers, ruth0007 and dioscureantwins, who are working overtime to make sure these chapters can get posted on schedule.
Sherlock frowned. He'd used to be baffled (surprised, delighted) on a regular basis by John's reactions to things, but he hadn't been this far off base in a long time.
She fought the instinct to bring her arms up to cover herself. She'd never enjoyed being the object of Sherlock's scrutiny. It wasn't that she was particularly self-conscious or lacking in confidence, but he had a way of making absolutely everything come up lacking. She didn't want to care what he thought of her. John liked her - quite a lot, in fact - and that's what was important. But maybe part of the reason she was here tonight was that she wanted to prove to Sherlock that she was worthy of John, just as much as he was. That she was brave and steadfast, clever and strong, and that she was just as willing to put her hand in the fire for him.
At those words, another great cheer arose. Sherlock fixed on John. He looked relieved and came forward to shake Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock resumes unbuttoning his shirt. "John, you must listen to me." His voice thrums loudly in John's ears even though he's speaking quietly.
"I missed most of the important things."
"What set what off?" Tristram asks, not following.
Tristram knows exactly what he means. In one of the earlier chapters, Death Eaters kidnapped some Muggle children and were hurting them. That made Tristram think about him and Emily being kidnapped. It even (possibly) made him have a nightmare that mixed up his real memories of the man who tied him to the chair with the imaginary scene in the book.
"He thought we'd got married."
Grandmother laughs. "Help me up, Tristram." She pulls on his hand as she struggles to get her legs underneath her.
He has managed to blank out the actual image of his father and Doctor Watson lying on the bed together, but the knowledge is still there. It should be okay, it really should. He knows that grown-ups tend to pair off, that it's normal, but all of the adults in his life have been single as long as he's known them: Uncle Mycroft, Grandmother, Mrs Hudson …and of course Father. He's never personally known two adults who live together the way Emily's aunts do. Is that why it makes him uncomfortable? No matter the reason, he's not in the mood to be particularly reasonable anyway. He's feeling out of sorts and hard done by. Father can barely be bothered to so much as put his hand on Tristram's shoulder, but he was touching Doctor Watson
It's also too quiet. He's used to the sounds of the city outside his window: the grumble of cars down in the street; the laughter of teenagers dosed with bravado and alcopop; the sudden whine of a motorcycle revving past; the shrill whistle of someone trying to get his mate's attention from a block away; the intermittent, distant (and sometimes not-so-distant) blare of emergency services. And of course his father downstairs playing the violin, or shouting at someone on the phone, or clanking around in the kitchen, working on experiments that he only gets out once Tristram is in bed.
John, a doctor, and Sherlock, a consulting detective, are both single parents. They meet when Sherlock's 8-year-old son, Tristram, becomes friends with John's 9-year-old daughter, Emily. John's wife, Mary, was killed in an apparent mugging a couple of years earlier, and Tristram asks Sherlock to investigate. It turns out that her death was contracted by her sister, Claire, who was jealous of her and wanted John for herself. The hit was arranged through a mysterious figure known only as the bogeyman. In the course of Sherlock's investigation, Tristram and Emily are kidnapped, and Sherlock and John join forces to rescue them. However, they are unable to apprehend the kidnappers or discover the bogeyman's identity.
Janine's mouth quirked up around her mouthful of scone. Famously undead indeed. Sherlock Holmes, the rascal. She hadn't thought of him in a while. The last she recalled seeing anything about him in the papers had been that Cereal Killer case several months back. She'd been shocked at the pictures. He'd obviously been unwell, looking even worse than when she'd visited him in hospital after he'd been shot, and that was saying something. John Watson had been visible in the background too, looking grim and haggard. Of course he had to be the long-time pal. It wasn't as if Sherlock Holmes had any other friends. Especially not ones he'd be shopping for rings with.
Etcetera."
Tristram smiles. It's almost like a bear hug, by his father's standards. "Good night, Father."
She redoubled her efforts, trying to discompose him by increasing her pace and flattening her tongue to cover as much surface area as possible. John didn't necessarily need to go deep, but he responded very well to constant friction and pressure. It didn't take long until his penis was stock-solid and the glans was completely exposed. The skin would be stretched and shiny, as if tended to by a thorough and enthusiastic polisher. The next time she looked up, his gaze had gone a bit unfocussed off to the side and his breaths were unsteady, but he quickly recovered and caught her eye.
When he wakes up on Saturday morning, the lower level of their flat is empty. He's not worried, though. Mrs Hudson is certainly downstairs; his father never leaves him completely alone. Once, when Father had to rush off to a crime scene and Mrs Hudson was spending a week at her niece's, he'd gone so far as to pack Tristram into Uncle Mycroft's black car at four a.m. in his pyjamas.
"Not a problem," Sherlock assured him as he tried not to stare too hard. "Shall we?" He led the way up the stairs and into the coat room. John's presence at his back weighed heavier than Pandora's box.
Once they were gone, Sherlock and John exchanged a look and burst out laughing.
"No, wait, I've almost got it," Sherlock mutters. He types something, stops, deletes most of it, then types again and hits 'Enter'.
"Too much?"
"That's not personal, everyone's slow," Sherlock said dismissively.
"Is that so?" Lestrade's eyebrows disappeared into his hairline. "From who, I'd like to know, because it wasn't me and it sure as hell wasn't either of their parents."
Tristram nods again, feeling a flash of irritation. Honestly, he's nearly nine!
"Sherlock, if you think this is somehow connected-"
"No, why would I-" Sherlock fought down his heartbeat, drew a cool mask over his face. "Oh, the play." He shook his head, ostensibly in irritation at John's forgetfulness. "No, I told you I haven't any way of contacting him."
John sighs indulgently and comes over to stand next to Sherlock. He looks out at the city: the mostly dark patches near them dotted with street lamps that look like fairy lights from this height; the more distant bands of white and yellow marking floors in highrises, topped by flickering spots of red and white warning away aircraft.
"Isn't it cool?" Emily says.
"It sounds beastly."
Doctor Watson hops up into the ambulance. Nisha tells him to sit on the bench across from Tristram, while she sits on a little fold-out seat near his head. Tino is already in the driver's cab.
"Sort of," Tristram says. "Look, these are all fossils that my grandmother's parents and grandparents collected." He points at a glass-fronted cabinet full of neatly labeled rocks with the imprints of leaves and shells and carapaces.
"No, Tris, don't, it's okay!" Doctor Watson holds Tristram down, but Tristram won't stop screaming. They're going to kill him, they're going to kill his father, and Doctor Watson's just going to let them!
Doctor Watson grins. "You're not so pants at this whole fatherhood thing after all."
"Yeah," John said quietly, with assurance.
"Uncle Mycroft," Tristram asks as Emily tries to sound out 'Yellow Submarine', "what are Father and Doctor Watson doing tonight?"
'No, I found it lying around in your hotel room,' Irene had said casually. 'Terribly careless of your father and John. Anyone could have picked it up. I thought it best that I hold on to it. And look how lucky it was that I did!' She beamed at him and reached down to take his hand, swinging it casually as they walked toward their gate.
That's enough to give John the final kick, and a moment later, his mouth is on Sherlock's. He scoops both hands under Sherlock's arse to slide him forward until he's right on the edge of the mattress, shuffling forward on his knees so he's snug between Sherlock's legs, his front flush against him.
Emily is standing near the head of the bed. "What's this?" she says curiously. The edge of something shiny and purple is sticking out from under one of the pillows. She slides it the rest of the way out. It's a strip of sealed foil packets, a little smaller than the ones individually sealed disinfectant wipes come in. Emily peers at the writing.
"Tell me what you mean by you feel 'sick'," he says, not letting Tristram look away.
"The winds at that altitude, the trajectory. There's no way. I'd end up hitting someone else."
Finally, finally, Doctor Watson drinks up the last of his coffee, politely declines when Mrs Bowen tries to pour him a fresh cup, and says to Emily and Tristram, "What say we go and find out what our plans for the day are?"
There are two dining rooms. Tristram assumes his father meant the family dining room, as opposed to the formal one. Although Emily and her father are guests, this doesn't seem to be an official visit. Grandmother hasn't even received them yet. However, when they get to the family dining room, they find the table unset and the sideboard empty, so Tristram goes through into the bigger room with the huge chandelier. But there is nothing set out there either.
"The two of you don't use condoms." It was almost a question. Sarah decided to treat it as one, anyway. Because having the palpable evidence of John's ... presence ... would be important to Sherlock. To make the experience as realistic as possible for him.
Sherlock turned his face to meet John's and caught his lips. They didn't generally kiss beyond a quick peck when it was likely that others would see them. Although they were generally accepted as a couple within their clan now, there were still those who stared openly at any expression of affection between them, and a few who couldn't hide their distaste. The notion of two men as a mated pair had taken quite a long time for John to accept as well, and especially himself as one half of it. The circumstances of how they came to be together were unusual, and at the time it had seemed merely an expedience. John had come upon the clan badly wounded, and would surely have died had Sherlock not taken him as his mate, offering his protection and a share of his resources, to the outrage of most and the amusement of his brother and chief, who had allowed the technicality.
Doctor Watson looks pleased, which makes Tristram feel good. "That's great. Thank you," he says, and squeezes Tristram's shoulder. "All right, turn around again and let me finish this up."
"Hello?" he answers, as if he didn't have any idea who was calling.
Emily giggles and winks before she goes into her classroom. Tristram is uncomfortable. It's just a fun adventure for her, like it was for him going to her house. But he has a feeling there is more to it. He doesn't know if he should share his concerns with her. There's nothing specific he can point to that makes him apprehensive.
He looks around for Father, missing his presence behind him. He finds him standing a couple of metres away with Irene. He has his hands in his coat, but now he takes one out and holds it out to her.
"You and Emily can come too." Father said he wanted them to. Well, he said John, but surely Emily was included.
John was soon distracted from any thoughts of cases or Sherlock's lack of transparency. Instead, he was drawn in, as usual (and not entirely unwillingly), by Sherlock's enthusiasm and charisma. He listened, and looked, and found himself fascinated not only by the history and meticulous restoration work that had been done, but by the vivid picture Sherlock painted of how he imagined life on board would have been. The dichotomy of the solitude of the sea and the close quarters below decks; the smell of sulphur, tar and unwashed men; the intrigues and power plays, bargaining and tests of strength over scarce resources. Nooks and crannies where secret stashes could have been squirreled away, prime spots for inserting peep holes, shadowy corners where the acoustics would have allowed listening in a deck away. Several novels' worth of drama on a single voyage.
They do, but before they go back into the dining room, Emily stops at the door and indicates that Tristram should be quiet. She wants to hear what the adults are saying. Tristram shakes his head. He doesn't want to get in trouble, especially not with Doctor Watson, but she stomps her foot, glares at him, puts her finger to her lips and cracks the door open.
"We can have one of Mycroft's men stay here-"
Once she's gone, Tristram scowls at the floor for a good five minutes while Doctor Watson goes out to get himself a coffee from the machine down the hall. When he comes back, he wordlessly sets a can of some fizzy drink down next to Tristram and slumps down into the chair beside him, blowing on his coffee. Tristram wouldn't mind drinking the fizzy drink - Father and Mrs Hudson never buy any, so it's a forbidden novelty for him - but he doesn't want to forgive Doctor Watson yet. Although he knows that doesn't make much sense, since it's not Doctor Watson's fault that Emily's inside playing games and he's stuck out here. Still, he doesn't want to give Doctor Watson the satisfaction of him drinking it.
Sherlock scowled intently up at the stage and didn't say anything. This was one of the reasons he'd always stayed out of personal entanglements. He had little interest in offering assurances to jealous lovers, or bolstering someone's ego with trite phrases and meaningless gifts. Still less in neglecting his own interests in order to waste time on inane, so-called 'bonding'. Either one wanted to be with someone, or one didn't. If jealousy arose, obviously the relationship was no longer delivering what one or the other party needed or wanted, and it was time to end it.
Sherlock opens his eyes and lets John see what's there, just for a second, before he looks down at their joined hands on him. He takes a breath that may be just a bit shaky and starts moving his hand the way he was before. After two or three passes, he lets go and lets John continue alone. At the first touch of John's hand - even through his underwear - Sherlock closes his eyes and tilts his head back, letting out a soft sound. John keeps going.
"Very much."
There had been a time when John wondered whether his and Sherlock's spirits would ever join to create a new life, the way his had with Mary. Molly, the clan's midwife, had laughed when he'd stumblingly broached the subject with her one day, but he'd never known two men who mingled their essences before, so it seemed a reasonable question to him. Sherlock hadn't laughed, but he agreed there must be something different about the female essence that enabled it to combine with the male, and that pleasurable as their mingling was, it was unlikely to ever lead to one of them carrying a child in their belly. Which was probably a good thing, given that John had been mostly worried about where it would come out.
"Morning, Sherlock," John said. "Molly was just saying how she'd like to help with the play."
Sherlock tossed the notice into the bin. He would actually quite like to spend the lunch hour with John, although he had no intention of using the time discussing the Mycroft situation. He'd come up with something to appease John quickly, and then they could have a pleasant time talking about... Sherlock was surprised to realise he didn't really care what they talked about (as long as it wasn't Mycroft). He was certain that he would enjoy sharing his thoughts with John on any topic.
"No. I'd like to let them stew a little longer. If you wouldn't mind, though, can you see what scheduling looks like on the twentieth?"
"I'm not sure I do, actually," John said, his voice clipped and tight, but Sherlock was halfway down the stairs to his own room already.
Sherlock frowns and looks back down at his phone. His fingers move more slowly than before. "You don't have to go."
The next day at school was pure torture. Sherlock had to physically restrain himself from getting anywhere near John, banning himself to sit behind his desk for the entirety of the morning lessons. He replied to John's greetings and comments in the briefest possible manner and kept his focus on the top of John's ear when speaking to him, in order to avoid meeting his eyes (or watching his mouth or lingering over the fine lines and creases in his face or letting his eye wander down into the space at the top of his collar, leading into the dark, warm place over his heart).
"Tell me about the missing jewelry and the car thieves," John said. He squeezed Sherlock's hand. Sherlock started talking, and John let his voice wash over him, let himself just be, let them be how they were, together.
"Kiss for luck?"
Sherlock had decided to set aside time every day to work on the play with the class, since they only had four weeks from the coming Friday until the performance. The first step, before they could begin learning the songs, was to take stock of what the children were going to be able to contribute. So for that morning, auditions were on the agenda, as he told John on their way to the classroom.
"Victor." A nod. "I go by Sherlock now." He was rather pleased with the way his voice came out: steady, firm, cool. Victor's confidence returning, his hands moving away after one final reassuring squeeze. Sherlock only now noticed the wedding ring. (Married to a woman, no children.) Sherlock's desire to be quit of the place increased exponentially. Fewer explanations would be required if he stayed, though. Fewer questions from John.

"Yeah, come on, harder, harder," she encouraged him.
"I wish you'd let me go," Kate says. There's a bit of a pout there, but also a bit of disapproval. She holds out a small red handbag once she gets to the bottom of the stairs. It matches the red dress Irene's wearing under her coat. That was probably one of the things in the suitcase Kate brought her.
He doesn't.
"You say he ditched you," Mycroft says as he prepares the drinks. "How did that happen?"
"You can come out now," he says. He smiles, but his jaw still looks tense.
Sherlock paused. He'd forgotten that he'd never discussed the play with John. John didn't know he'd decided to write all of the songs himself. All of a sudden, he was nervous. He'd done rather poorly with predicting John's reactions to things. He'd imagined all along how admiring John would be, how impressed with Sherlock's musical talents. Now he was unsure.
Her face lights up and she looks up from the pellet. "Really?"
"I couldn't tell. I couldn't even really see them. I just saw something moving next to the path, under the trees. Bigger than an animal."
leave the ventilation system alone, it's stifling in here as it is."
Sherlock understands what John is trying to say: that the wife and the job mean nothing in the face of a tragedy like the death of a child. But the basic ingredients are still there. He needn't throw everything away. "You'd only have to sell the gold to get cash," he points out.
8-12 mini sweet peppers
Tristram's father seems to feel the same way, judging by the encouraging sounds he makes at all the right junctures and the way his eyes never leave Doctor Watson's face. Tristram's never seen him this focused on a living person for this long. It's as if Emily's father is a new puzzle for him to crack.

Sherlock cast about for what he was going to test John with this time. He didn't have anything in mind yet. He had to wait until John had finished the drink anyway, and then wait again until he started showing the effects.
John flinches back, startled. "I... I care about what happens to him, yes. But he's not... I mean, I'm not trying to..."
Sarah chuckled around his kisses. Because of course, simply locking it wouldn't keep Sherlock out, should he be determined. "And the windows," she put in. "Don't think being on the third floor would stop him."
"Bunch of morons," Mrs Holmes said briskly. "I don't know how they're going to manage. Hello, John, come give me a proper welcome as it looks like my son is too busy fattening himself up before Christmas dinner." She held out her arms and John obediently came round the table to greet her.
"Yeah, you're right," she said. "You haven't any idea. Ask him sometime about the Bruhl twins or the Wilkes boy. That's why you're here, you know, to keep an eye out, make sure he doesn't screw up again. Because one of these days, he's going to do something so bad that not even he can get away with it. And trust me, you do not want to be there when it happens. I'd get out now if I were you. I mean, who are you anyway?"
Tristram thinks again of all the things he thought of that morning: playing and laughing and bedtime and all the rest. "Yeah," he agrees, and has to smile too.
Sherlock lifts up enough that John can work his shirt up and over his head. Sherlock's eyes sweep down John's torso, taking in the smattering of brown and grey hairs on his chest, the soft pink nipples and gently smiling navel.
Sherlock studies the two pictures in his hands, memorising every detail. This may be the only time he gets to see it. He tries to descry something of John in her features. She has wide set eyes and a rather broad nose. Her features appear thick and puffy, probably from the interventions they had to perform. "She's beautiful," Sherlock says. She is John's. Of course she is beautiful.
Sherlock swung the door the rest of the way open and strode in. "What's going on here?" he said in a commanding tone.
The man gets up and ambles lazily around the desk. "John Watson, it's
"He makes the best lasagne," Tristram informs him.
"Don't," he blurts out. "Don't, please, I can't..."
"You hold the cane in your left hand, but it's your left leg that gives you trouble. Awkward, not to mention that you're left-handed. So why not carry the cane in your right hand, as would be natural? Because it can't bear weight. Your handshake is firm and confident, so no injury to the hand, wrist, or arm. Must be your shoulder. The fact that you experience psychosomatic pain in your leg indicates that the actual injury was traumatic, probably greatly so. Could have been a horrible accident, but given that you were stationed in a war zone, I'm going to go with hostile fire. How am I doing so far?"
In the light spilling into the room from the kitchen, the tableau is all too clear. Doctor Watson is curled up on his side, sound asleep under a quilt on the couch. Father is sitting on the floor next to him, his upper body resting on the couch in the space in front of Doctor Watson's chest, his head cushioned on his arms. He also appears to be asleep. One of Doctor Watson's hands is curved around Father's shoulder. Tristram immediately feels that they are intruding on something, and that it would be best for them to go back upstairs.
In the living room, Father's back is facing them, and Doctor Watson is standing very close to him. It looks like his hands are actually inside Father's coat. Father doesn't appear to mind that at all. Jealousy twists in Tristram's chest, and he immediately feels guilty. It doesn't concern him.
"How did you- No, never mind, I don't want to know. Just out of curiosity, what's her name?"
"But what's she going to do to make it stop?" Tristram wants to know. That's all he really cares about. If he knows what it is that she does, he can do it now and won't have to go to any appointment at all.
The sound makes Tristram want to join in. He likes hearing his father laugh. He does it so rarely. He's laughed a lot more since he's become friends with Doctor Watson. Tristram looks at Emily. He knows she also likes the fact that her father's happy when he's together with his father. After Emily's mother died, she told him once, her father was sad for a long time. Emily grins at him. He grins back. The flash goes off in the photo booth. Father and Doctor Watson are still laughing, but their voices are muffled now, and then they fall silent.
When they get off the motorway, they take the exit closest to the part of the city where the Watsons' house is. Tristram is curious what will happen when Doctor Watson gets out of the car, because then Father will have to drive the rest of the way back to Baker Street. Tristram has never been in a car driven by his father before. He expects it will be rather exciting.
Tristram isn't sure what to do with that. Clearly, she isn't fine. However, if his father had given him that answer, he would leave it. 'Fine' in that case would mean 'I am not going to give you any further information, and pressing the issue will only result in irritation, possibly anger.' Not that he has ever asked his father whether he was all right. For one thing, he can tell without asking, and for another, when his father isn't all right (injured, bored, frustrated), there is nothing that Tristram can do for him anyway. Asking about it would only focus attention on the unpleasant state of affairs and distract his father from fixing things using his own methods. Likewise, his father is not inclined to ask Tristram about his physical or mental condition: again, the answer is almost always obvious, and beyond that, Tristram knows that he is expected to ask for any assistance he might require.
The man considers for a bit, watching Tristram, then says, "So you're on that side? Where's Watson?"
I also understood now what his purpose was, and what he proposed. Many years ago, I would not have hesitated to embrace him now, praise his wisdom, and disrobe him in the most efficient manner possible. But unlike him, I had become acquainted during my travels with many pairs who lived as he described, who acknowledged their affection toward each other and named it, if only between themselves. It was never an easy lot. There were places in the world where it was easier, but England was not one of them. There were reasons we had not declared ourselves earlier, and his apprehension and confusion were not the only ones. I had never been unaware of my heart and nature, yet had refrained from raising the subject between us. My many years of intense study of humanity and inhumanity had taught me that it takes more than an abiding affection and undeniable attraction to keep two people together, regardless of their gender or inclination. We had both hurt each other badly, but perhaps those wounds had been necessary to tear us open and drag out the things we hid from each other. All of these logical reflections were useless, of course, for as ever, despite any misapprehensions I might still have, there was only one path open to me. It was not even a choice, for I was as helpless to deny my heart as my bees were not to follow their queen.
But Sherlock was too far gone -- exhausted and overstimulated and woozy -- to put up any more struggle. He flopped down on the bed, his head raised on two pillows, and moaned softly as the vibrator hammered away inside, shifting from side to side as he tried to shift it into a more profitable position, but it wasn't to be had.
"Well, there's the- You know about my leg. No change in sensitivity there, just the... you know, the pain. Comes and goes."
Tristram reckons 'she' can only mean the woman from downstairs. But she already saw him. Why does she want to see him again? And what did she mean about his eyes?
"Sherlock." Mycroft made that pinched, alum-tasting face he thought passed for a polite smile. "Aren't you going to invite me in?"
"Forget it, he's out of the question. And he's still in Afghanistan. Corporal Craig Harrison, holds the world record for the longest distance sniper kill, nearly two and half kilometres. But that was from higher ground with a slight tailwind. No comparison."
Tristram shakes his head. He knows what his father will say: 'It's just a dream. It can't really hurt you'. That doesn't mean it wasn't scary, though.
Sherlock had swung himself sideways in his chair so that his feet were hanging off the side. He was clutching his violin to his chest and staring at the ceiling.
Sherlock picked it up and broke the seal on the little bottle, unscrewed the lid and held it out to John. John held out his left hand, palm up. "Just on my fingers."
"Change of destination. Lauriston Gardens."
John looks at him in horror. "You can't seriously still be thinking of going to meet him?"
"If you think any of that will put me off, you don't know me very well," Sherlock said.
"No, no, stop-" Sherlock tried to say, but his protests were drowned by the children's enthusiastic shouts.
By the time the plane lands, Tristram has steeled himself - for the moment, anyway, until he can get his bearings - for another car ride into the unknown, another safe house, another day of not knowing what's going on.
Tristram likes it when his father is happy, even if it has nothing to do with Tristram. He's feeling cosy and safe, and he has the promise that he can go to Emily's house any time they want now, so he's pretty happy himself. The rumbling of the car engine is making him drowsy when he hears his father say, "Why don't you try calling me now, Tristram. I don't trust that John programmed that thing correctly."
Doctor Watson goes on with his story: "I tried to do that," he says. "I tried to block it out and not be affected by the patients' anger, or their fear, or the thought of what kind of future they might have, but I couldn't. I simply couldn't, it always got to me, and I thought, well, I'll never be as good a doctor as Gents. I'll always have this weakness. But do you know what happened then?" Doctor Watson asks.
Sherlock lifted his hands to put them on John's elbows and squeezed gently. They had been too shaky to work the fiddly tie pin clasp just moments ago, but they felt firm and solid now.
He tipped the candle again to direct a dollop right into the hollow of my navel. It felt as if the little tongue of heat were worming its way straight into my gut, spreading the warmth even further south until it would have been pointless to deny that I was rampant.
Sherlock wished he knew where the lotion was - there were probably a few drops left - but he wasn't about to go searching for it now. He smeared the rest of what was on his hand onto John, and John shifted around over him until Sherlock was able to get his hand around both of them.
"Why can't she sleep in their room?" Bill asked, suddenly affronted at the proposed invasion. "Or Mycroft's."
"Hey, no one's signed your cast yet!" Emily exclaims.
"You? Not that I'd put a prank like that past you, but you don't seem the type to need to go to such lengths. I'd have thought you could sit any exam with your eyes closed."
"Maybe I'm making too big a deal out of it," Doctor Watson is saying, "but there are enough horrors in real life without adding to them. Especially in this. And on that happy note, scoot under the covers, the both of you."
