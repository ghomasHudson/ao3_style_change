Castiel turned in his seat again, his right arm draped across the back of the passenger seat so he could look out the back window as he backed out of his parking spot at the hospital. He paused for a second before switching gears back to drive and studied Dean’s face for a moment. It had only been a little over two years since the last time he saw Dean, but he looked… older, fuller, more sure of himself. Much more than he had been at 24 when their lives split.
He handed Castiel his mug and took a seat in the armchair opposite the couch where Castiel was seated.
“I’m not happy like this Dean, I miss you and I miss who we used to be and the things that we used to do together. Now that I’m thinking about it, the city was much safer when we started dating and we first got married. And that has to be because you and I were so preoccupied with each other and making each other happy that there wasn’t time to tear the city apart. So yes, I want to retire and I think you should retire with me.” Cas stated bluntly, arms crossed over his chest as he awaited Dean’s response.
Dean limped through his doorway, leaning against the closed door, his face tilted up towards the ceiling. He could hear the tv from the living room and he knew that Sam had heard him come in. Dean gathered his thoughts and crutched down the hallway.
“Charlie, I’ve missed him so much, “ Dean finally sputtered out, the floodgates opening, “I’ve missed him so much and I can’t believe that I’ve been through everything these past two years and he hasn’t been here to see any of it. And he graduated medical school and he did so well and is still doing so well for himself and all I wanted for so long was to be there for him and to be there to support him.” -Dean spoke without taking a breath and he could tell that he was rambling and couldn’t bring himself to slow down-
Cas stared at Dean. No one had described him like this or had even taken the time to  dissect why he was interested in medicine in the first place. He was just written off as the greedy son of two doctors who was just following in the family business of saving people and curing disease.
“HEY DEAN!” Cas yelled, clapping a hand to Dean’s shoulder, not registering the look of surprise on Dean’s face. Cas leaned into Dean to stay upright, the liquid in his cup nearly sloshing over the top.
His throat clenched and his stomach dropped. The palms of his hands grew damp as he read and reread the text. He hadn’t even read over the message before he sent it. Had he  sounded desperate? Was it obvious that he missed Castiel with every fiber of his being? Dean threw his phone to the other side of his bed, screen down. He closed his eyes  and covered his face with his hands, praying that he was just overthinking this, that his utter need and desperation for Castiel to return to him was not as painfully blatant as he dreaded it was.
“Wow.” he said, raising his eyebrows, “I didn’t know I was that obvious.”
“Whoever said I needed you to help me?” Dean shot back, his words cutting through the air like a hot knife through butter. His words left Cas stunned long enough for Dean to push past him and out of the room.
Promptly 20 minutes later, Charlie let herself in with her set of keys and threw herself down on the couch, her red curls bouncing and falling to frame her face as she studied Dean.
“Alright students!” the instructor at the front of the room clapped his hands together, collecting the attention of his class. “Now that we’re all here, welcome to Biology 101! My name is Dr. Crowley but you can call me Crowley.” The short man paced in front of the class, his arms crossed in front of him.
“What’s up babe?” -Dean angled himself towards Cas, rolling his shoulders back and down away from his ears.-
“Who??” Sam asked from the other room, Dean could see out of the corner of his eye that Sam had picked his head up from his phone, eyes wide and eyebrows raised in a look of concern.
“I’ve been good, honestly, a lot better recently, but not bad,” Dean said, finally pulling his eyes away from the mug.
“Hell yeah, dude! I get what you’re saying and I can totally picture it too, you’d be like this badass warrior with a silver blade, your white lab coat billowing around you as you take on our most fearsome monsters.” Dean said, his eyes lighting up as he talked with his hands, using them to create a scene in which Cas was a soldier in the fight against death.
“I can even meet you for coffee or lunch or something else next week! Maybe Wednesday between our lectures and kinda give you a rundown of what you missed! Let me give you my number!”
“I was wrong Dean, I haven’t been giving you the attention and the credit that you so obviously deserve. Deep down I always recognized my selfishness, I let what should have been a simple conversation fester and escalate into something much larger” Now the tears flowed from Cas. Dean watched the man he loves pour his being into this apology and the familiar pin-prick of tears nipped at the back of Dean’s eyes. He sniffed and swallowed back what he could.
“Yes, actually. Spill the beans, Dean,” Charlie said, all business.
As he listened to Dean describe him as a conqueror of illness and death, he too began to picture himself in this role. He felt more secure in himself just knowing that an outside source understood what he was saying, that this almost-total stranger could see his motives, that he could articulate the exact feelings Cas had about medicine.
Castiel turned the corner and there he was, wait…
“Hey Charlie” - Dean raised a hand in a weak wave, his voice strained by the onslaught of sobs that were building in his chest - “I just wanted to stop by and see if you were free for a bit.”
“Yeah man! I can be there in 20!” Charlie’s bubbly voice sounded through the phone after a palpable pause. Dean knew that she was on to him but if she didn’t ask, he wasn’t going to tell.
As their laughs died out and they took deep breaths, smiling dopey smiles at each other across the  table, Becky returned  with their drinks.  She could read a room and quietly placed their drinks on the table.
See notes at the end
Charlie stepped over and closed the door behind Dean. She turned back around and found him holding his damp jacket and looking for somewhere to set it down. As he stood there shivering, she was shocked at how small he looked. The Dean she knew and worked with was this large character, this beaming ray of sunshine that somehow knew how to make everyone laugh and was able to shamelessly flirt in a way that left you feeling flattered rather than creeped out or bothered. She looked at her friend standing in her bedroom and wasn’t sure where to start piecing him back together.
After several minutes sitting curled into each other, Castiel pulled out of Gabe’s arms. Sitting up and wiping his face dry, he turned to look at his brother, his protector, the one that had always been there for him.
“Dean, Dean look at me, “ -Castiel placed a hand under Dean’s chin and lifted his head so they were looking eye to eye- “I will never feel saddled with you, I am not ‘settling’ for you or anything like that. I love you and I’m with you because I want to be with you, because I cannot imagine my life without you, or with anyone else in it besides you. I wish you understood how much you mean to me, but maybe that’s on me for not doing enough to show you. I promise you, Dean, that I will do more to prove that to you.” Cas leaned forward and kissed Dean’s forehead.
Sam was sprawled out on the couch, his entire 6 and a half foot frame barely fitting on the three-seater piece of furniture. With his nose deep in a book, something about vampires or ghouls or something, he didn’t even look up as Dean entered the room.
“Dean,” Cas reached over to touch Dean’s thigh, “don’t worry about it, babe. I should have been paying more attention to the road.”
Desperate for relief, Dean scrambled to retrieve his phone from his pocket, his fingers finding Charlie’s name in his favorites list before he was fully aware of what he was doing.
After a few more moments of silence and intense eye contact between Dean and Castiel, Dean remembered that he needed to respond to Garth.
Cas looked up from the page and met Dean’s eyes. He took a breath and nodded.
“Oh right!” Dean returned to the barstool and picked up his guitar. He looked back at Cas with a goofy grin and started strumming, “This is all part of my plan, don’t worry.”
“Come here.” Dean said through gritted teeth. He grabbed Cas by the lapel of his cheap suit and dragged him into the nearest bathroom.
~Dean, I am absolutely crazy about you and I need to get this off my chest before I say yes to going to this party tonight. I don’t know how you feel but I figured it was early enough in our friendship that we could either work through this if you don’t feel the same way, or, well, if you were uncomfortable by my feelings, I don’t think I would be completely, irreversibly devastated by your loss if I were to lose you over this. Please let me know what you think~
“Ha yeah, well Sammy’s in Kansas visiting Ma and Pop this week. He and Jessica went out there, heh, basically had to push them out the door, promised them nothing would happen while they were away and look at me now.” Dean chuckled out, gesturing to his blood stained appearance.
Cas paused mid step and turned to face Sam, the color had drained from Cas’s face and his eyes were glassy.
He smiled softly at the messages, knowing that Cas was sincere in his concern for Dean in the weather. He returned the phone to his pocket and started on his way. His doubt for his plan built in his mind with every step he took closer to home. Maybe he should try, try to fight for his own happiness. He probably wasn’t giving Cas the credit he deserved, he probably wasn’t giving himself the credit he deserved.
“He’s gonna leave a message and I’d rather listen to it or read the transcript thing my phone’ll give me rather than have him stumble over his words on a live call,” Dean explained, closing his eyes and waiting for voicemail to pick up the call.
“Sam, “ Dean said in a near-whisper, unable to find the words he needed to reassure his brother. Jess was crazy about him, she loved Sammy more than anything and was more than ready to become an official part of this crazy family. Surely Sam knew that?
He didn’t have to search long until he found a familiar name in his contacts. His mind barely registered what he was doing as he selected Castiel’s number, typed out a friendly message, and sent it. It wasn’t until after the ~whoosh~ chimed from his phone that he read the text:
Dean, dressed in a dark green henley and worn jeans, looked radiant in the soft light illuminating from the candles and string lights, his guitar sitting on a stand next to him. A smile crept across Dean’s face and all words escaped Cas’s mind. Every weight from the day, even the dried coffee and ink stains covering his shirt, melted away from his mind in this moment.
“Uh huh, ‘range’, says the guy that listens to the same 5 cassette tapes over and over,“ Castiel teased.
“Dude, awesome!” Dean interrupted, shooting two thumbs up at Cas before grabbing his book bag and standing from the table. “Ok the plan, meet me at my place around like 7 and we can head over together! I gotta run but I’ll see you tonight!”
“Sure thing hon, and for you?” Becky said, writing the drink down and turning towards Dean with a beaming smile.
“Well, yeah, brother of course, I care about Dean, and you. I want the best for both of y’all and sometimes ya need someone with an outside perspective to help you through tough times,” Benny replied in an attempt to make Cas feel better.
“Castiel? Buddy? Are you still there?” Benny’s voice cut through the phone, breaking up Cas’s thoughts.
Still holding the glass in one hand, Dean turned towards Cas, tears forming in his eyes. God, Winchester, hold it together for one minute, please. He pleaded with himself.
“Dude! Go home! Propose to your girlfriend! Do anything else besides hanging out here!” Dean yelled back at his brother, growing irritated at his near constant presence around the apartment. God, he loved the kid and appreciated the concern but he could take care of himself! He was a capable adult!
“Joanna Beth, if you keep your mouth open like that you’re gonna catch flies,” Dean said to her, his deep voice cutting through the tension hanging in the room like a hot knife through butter. “Castiel was the doctor that fixed me up at the hospital and apparently my concussion is severe enough that I’m not supposed to be left alone for a day or two, so he brought me home until you could get here. And now that you’re here, he is relieved of his babysitting duty and can head home. Jo, go ahead and leave the food in the kitchen, please” He held her gaze and gestured lazily towards the kitchen.
Castiel switched arms to stretch and glanced at the stack of patient files sitting on his desk. Several of these were for patients that were no longer his, for people that came into the ER and were promptly transferred to different services.  It would be very efficient for him to deliver these files to the correct department on his walkabout, and technically he wouldn’t be avoiding work, right? The only issue was that he wasn’t sure which files were his and which he needed to deliver without reading the first page of all the charts.
Cas brought up the last duffel bag from the car and dropped it in the bedroom. He grabbed the box with the air mattress and plugged in the pump to inflate the mattress. Once it was appropriately full he turned off the pump and left to join Dean in their new kitchen. He was greeted by the sweet smell of a freshly brewed cup of coffee and Dean’s smiling face.
Whenever Dean was the one to leave, Castiel found that coming home to a clean apartment took some of the stress and tension out of the situation. Leaving them to just focus on the actual topic at hand rather than getting deflecting to something else.
“Pamela’s my therapist,” Dean said, finally. His voice crisp and his response short. Castiel’s head snapped up from the table and his head tilted to the side. He didn’t respond immediately, letting Dean’s response wash over him. Dean was seeing a therapist. He was talking through his past with a professional, someone who was helping him, obviously.
“Cas, buddy,” -Dean reached over and took both of Cas’s hands in his- “don’t worry about a costume, I got us covered, just meet me at 7.”
“Um, yeah, actually,” Castiel said, his grin widened into a full smile. His stomach flipped at the mere idea that someone knew the origin of his name, and seemed to be interested in discussing it. He reveled in the fact that Dean wasn’t put off by the religious background that he obviously came from.
“Fuck,” he whispered under his breath as he bent down to pick up the keys. This day just would not give him a break.
Dean slipped his hand out of Cas’s grip and turned back towards the car. He took a few steps forward and opened the rear passenger door. Cas turned to watch him and tilted his head to the side in confusion as he watched Dean pull one of his shoes out of a duffel bag that was packed on the back seat. Dean looked back at Cas with a large smile across his face he held the shoe up and set it on top of the car.
Dean laid on his bed, head thrown back, his own hand working himself to completion. With a moan and a gentle twist of his wrist, he felt his balls tighten, the sharp pull in his gut. He spilled all over his hand and stomach, some coming up to hit his upper chest. Dean breathed hard through his mouth and closed his eyes, the last image of his fantasy playing out in his head. The figure caressed his face, staring back at him with crystal clear blue eyes.
Castiel exhaled a shallow breath that he didn’t know he had been holding. Who would have thought that hearing that Dean wanted to be his friend would bring him such relief?
Heya Cas, I’ve been thinking about you and I wanted to say that I had a great time at coffee yesterday and I was wondering if you would want to get together again?
“I’d follow you into the dark, honeybee,” Dean whispered back.
“Yeah Dean?” Castiel looked up at Dean. “What were you saying?”
“We don’t know what happened and that seems irresponsible to assume” Castiel snapped back.
“You heard me. Stay. Away. From. Dean.” Sam crossed his arms in front of his chest, content to end the conversation there.
“Damn honeybee, what’s taking you so long? The bottle was right on top.” Dean said with a sarcastic lilt to his voice and a tiny sneer on his face.
“Uh, yeah Cassie, I’ll be right there, hang on.”
Dean looked back at Cas and waited for him to continue. The slight uptick of the corner of Cas’s mouth told him that he was grateful for Dean’s patience.
**The crisp odor of burning rubber filled his nostrils, cool sweat covered the rapidly heating skin along his arms and neck. Dean looked around and saw broken glass covering the back seat around him, the blood on the front dash. His bookbag was thrown across the car, his clothes and toys spread across the floorboard. He looked down and saw blood dripping down his left arm, small pieces of glass stuck to him.
On his next pump, Dean did find Cas’s prostate, each roll of his hips now pulling gasps and moans out of the other man. Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s wasit, keeping him as close as possible.
Dean’s hand worked the length of his dick, his thumb rubbing over the slit of his head. He pictured his dream figure tentatively taking his cock into their mouth, running their tongue over the head, and licking a stripe from the back all the way up. Their cheeks hollow, sucking and bobbing their head, one of their hands gripping his base to keep him from cumming too early and the other is holding his hips down. Dean picked up the pace, moving his own hand faster, pre-cum weeping from his purpling cock.
“I’m so happy for you, I’m glad that you have that resource now,” Castiel said, not responsible for the pride displayed across his face.
Castiel tiptoed across the bedroom and to the bathroom door because whatever was happening, Castiel needed to see it with his own eyes.
Castiel’s touch was gentle but firm. Heat was radiating from his body and Dean’s heart rate slowed, beating at a more regular rate. He took deep breaths, breathing in the smell of Castiel’s shampoo, and the memories of waking up to find Castiel wrapped around his body with the same body heat and woodsy smell came flooding back. Dean turned his head away from Castiel, focusing on the stairs in front of him.
A week had passed since the light that was Dean Winchester entered his life. Cas sat in the coffee shop absentmindedly chewing the nails on his left hand and tapping his right foot. He recognized a change in himself last Thursday, but couldn’t quite name that change. He felt lighter, less restricted, and more confident in himself. The only thing that set last Thursday aside from every other day in his life, was the introduction of Dean.
Castiel got to the coffee shop first, just like he had planned. Dean had always given him a hard time for being late while they were dating and he was determined to be the first one here for this get together, he also knew that he needed the time to settle his nerves before Dean showed up. He also had the perfect cover, Trident Case was also a bookstore, so if Dean asked why he was already there, he could just tell him that he  was hoping to find a new book, which of course was true because Castiel was always looking for new books.
“Oh, of course! It would be no problem!” Castiel enthusiastically agreed, pleased that Dean still wanted to interact with him, that he was taking their professor’s suggestion of studying together seriously or at least pretending to. He started to ask what but sensed that this is not information that he should ask a near-total stranger, the pinch of Dean’s eyebrows and clenched jaw told him that this was something significant.
“How about you?”
Gabe didn’t respond, he kept his gaze locked on Castiel, who was refusing to make eye contact with him through this.
“Thank you,” Cas said, smiling at Dean. “I do believe that you said you had something to ask me, if I’m not mistaken.” A smirk formed on Cas’s face and his right eyebrow lifted into a flirtatious arch.
Dean’s laugh filled the space between them, creating an air of familiarity and something else that Castiel couldn’t quite name. Their eyes remained locked on each other when the waitress arrived to take their order.
“Well I can tell you who I saw since I saw them outside the hospital after my shift but I can’t tell you what I treated them for,” Castiel said, hoping that Gabe was just asking for the juicy hospital details.
“Dean,” - Charlie placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder and shook him gently- “babe, get out of your head. What is going on in there?”
“Heya, Castiel!” Dean said, stopping just in front of Castiel, “glad you could make it today.”
“Dean no, I got it, I want to do this for you. I want to know how you’ve been doing. I also do remember how to get there.” Cas responded quickly, jumping to turn the key and start the ignition.
I am actually off tomorrow night if you wanted to do something that quickly?
He removed the trio, unfolding the shirt and pants. He pressed the shirt to his face, breaking in the smell of Dean that lingered. The scent of leather and wood filled his nose and Castiel whimpered, brought low by the memory. He looked at the shirt, remembering the night Dean gave it to him and how he would make Dean wear it around the house so that it would always smell like it. He tossed it across his left shoulder and held the pants up in front of him and retrieved the box from the pocket. As he turned the box over in his hand, he dropped the pants onto the floor and ran his fingers over the closed lid. Castiel turned and sat on the edge of his bed and cracked the box open.
Jo returned with the hot chocolate as the ambulance arrived. Meg and Jo agreed that they would stay behind and keep the Lisa and Ben company until the police arrived. Dean was loaded up and he assured both the girls that he would call them with updates and that he would be fine.
Dean stormed into the apartment, slamming the door shut behind him and stomping into the kitchen. Cas, shocked by the sudden entrance, dropped the stack of flashcards clutched in his hands and watched as half of them slid off his lap, off the couch, and onto the floor next to him.
With shaky knees and uneven breathing, he opened the Notes app on his phone to draft a new message and avoid this risky scenario again.
“Dean, fucking move.” Cas commanded once he had caught his breath.
“I asked a student to stay after class for a few minutes today, he’s having some trouble focusing and I had him last year and this is very unlike him. I know that classes just started and that it’s still early in the school year to be worried about a student’s behavior, but I wanted to try to catch it early. And like I said, I’ve had this kid before and he never showed classroom difficulties like this before. He’s even started to fall behind on homework assignments and it’s only been a week. And, well.” Dean trailed off, unsure of how to continue. He looked down, away from Cas’s steely blue gaze, his fingers picking at a scab on the back of his hand, his nails digging into the soft flesh around his wrists.
“Uh, Cas? Or the angel part? Sorry, I give everyone nicknames but if we aren’t those kinds of friends then I don’t have to, sorry about that.” Dean shuffled uncomfortably in his seat, anxious that he had overstepped his bounds. He was flustered and Cas could see the soft skin above his shirt color turn pink and spread up across his cheeks as Dean tried to back his way out of the compliment.
His day started after too few hours of sleep and to a stranger knocking into him and spilling a scalding black coffee down his front.  As if the coffee stains weren’t bad enough, the universe gifted Castiel with a leaky pen that exploded in his front pocket.
“Is this ok? Was this what you wanted?” Cas asked, confident of the answer.
Dean was still floating on air as he returned to his apartment that afternoon. The events of coffee and breakfast still playing back in his head. Dean wasn’t going to acknowledge that there had been something missing from his morning routine the past two years, something particularly Castiel-shaped. He knew that he shouldn’t feel as at ease as he was, but there was something familiar about sitting across the table from Castiel, the two of them sharing the morning over cups of coffee. Even if he didn’t want to admit that he had missed the back and forth that he and Castiel had, he could concede that he felt more whole, more like himself, now that his friend was back.
“WHY WAS HE HERE?” Jo yelled back, matching Dean’s tone and throwing her arms out in exasperation.
Castiel walked home, oblivious to the snow that collected in his hair and to the wind nipping at his face. He stepped into his apartment and dropped his keys into the dish by the door. His mind was still replaying the events of that morning, over and over again, until next thing he knew, he was sprawled on the couch and dialing Gabriel’s number.
“Heya Dean, whatcha been up to this morning?” Sam called out as Dean crutched past him into the kitchen.
“Hey, Charlie? Can I ask you for a quick favor?” Dean asked, sitting up straight in her bed and turning to face her.
👌🏽🐝 I have to get back to work now, but thank you for reaching out Dean.
“…oh, you're still there? I…uh .. just thought that would have moved out of there, well, a while ago”.
“Well, how was that?” Charlie asked, finally plopping herself  back down on the couch.
“Good! Glad I could help, now seriously get out of here and go propose!” Dean said, standing up and grabbing his crutches.
Cas’s keys fell to the ground with a small *clink* and he felt heat rise in his cheeks as he swallowed back tears. His mouth went dry and he clenched his jaw to keep from screaming.
As the movie faded into black, Charlie leaned forward to grab the remote and turned the TV off. She tossed the remote back on the coffee table and readjusted on the couch so that she was facing Dean. Charlie sat in silence and watched as Dean tried desperately to avoid making eye contact with her. They sat there until finally the pressure to break the silence grew and Dean couldn’t avoid looking over at Charlie anymore.
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out.
Sam was silent for a moment, his mouth open wide and this his eyebrows raised.
“Babe, I'll get it,” Cas whispered against Dean’s lips. He pulled away, lifting his head to search through the bag. Dean slid his hand down from Cas’s shoulder down to his cock, teasing the sensitive head causing Cas to gasp and shiver. He had the small bottle in his hand until Dean lightly squeezed his balls and he dropped the bottle out of surprises and pleasure.
“Don’t you dare talk to me in that tone of voice,” Castiel said, nearly in a whisper, not trusting himself to not break, “you don’t know the full story, you weren’t there.”
As he rolled his shoulders and stretched his legs out, the soft linen of his sleep pants dragged over his morning wood. Soft heat radiated from between his legs and the growing tent in the front of his pants demanded attention. Dean paused for a moment to listen out for Sam, always the early riser. When no noise came from the rest of the apartment, he lightly ran his fingers down his cock, over the fabric. A silent groan escaped his lips and he closed his eyes. He palmed himself with one hand, pulling his waistband down with the other, closing his eyes and arching his neck back and into the pillow.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am doing great Dean, I am at a party and I’m drinking and it's totally ‘awesome’ that the guy who brought me here just left me as soon as we arrived. So yeah, great,” Cas said, gripping his fingers into Dean’s shoulder.
The car behind them honked, breaking Cas out of his thoughts.
Despite this display of growth and self-confidence, the pinprick of anxiety that had formed in Dean’s chest during the car ride turned into an enormous weight that he wasn’t sure how he’d carry up these stairs with him. The thought of Castiel wrapping his arm around Dean’s waist to half carry him up to his second-floor apartment was enough to turn his legs to jelly and cause his stomach to flip.
“Hey bro,” Gabe asked quietly, sliding his son from his lap into Castiel’s, “what’s going on?”
“Heya, doc, what’s the news?” Dean asked brightly, hands politely folded in his lap.
“No thanks, I just got back and I have leftovers if I get hungry later.” Dean opened the fridge and peered inside, his eyes cataloging the various bottles of fruit juice smoothies that Charlie and Meg had been pestering him to try.
He grabbed the lube from Cas and coated his fingers. He rolled Cas onto his back and moved to reach Cas’s hole, gently pressing in one finger. Cas gasped and Dean froze. Once Cas gave him a nod to go ahead, Dean placed one hand by Cas’s head and leaned down to kiss him, still working his two fingers in and out of Cas with skilled ease. Their bodies were accustomed to working together and Cas was quickly pushing back against Dean, whimpering and begging for more. Dean added a third finger, pumping and scissoring Cas open. After working a fourth finger in, he broke their kiss and removed his hand to coat his own cock in lube. Cas spread his legs more as Dean lined himself up. He ever so slowly pushed in, easing his way past that tight ring of muscle until he finally hit home. Dean paused and took several slow breaths to ready himself for the pure sensation and heat that was Cas. Cas saw stars when Dean bottomed out, the solid pressure of Dean inside of him was the feeling he had hoped for. Nothing between the two of them, just them in this moment.
“That was it, that was the question that opened the door. So Jack tensed up at this suggestion ok, this kid finally looked up at me and, while looking me dead in the eyes, told me that his dad, Nick, is a drunk and abusive and that he hasn’t been able to sleep or concentrate on anything, that he’s having some real trouble at home,” -Dean paused to take a quick breath, the words tumbling out of his mouth, unable to stop now that he’s started- “Jack’s mom died in childbirth and it sounds like this kid’s dad, Nick, blames him for it and as the years passed, he fell more and more into a depression and hatred towards Jack. Nick’s pressuring him to contribute more around the house, to earn his keep. He’s telling his kid, his own son, that he’s useless, and won’t amount to anything without his help.
“Oh, uh” - he cleared his throat- “Ha, Hell Yeah! Let’s go!” Dean turned away to open his door.
Castiel quickly gathered his things and was out the door before Dean could respond. He needed a few minutes by himself to gather his thoughts on what just happened. After two years, his ex breezed back into his life and it did not go well. Ok, to be fair, Castiel was the one who left but it was a bad situation that he needed to get out of if he was going to make it as a medical student. But was he being fair to Dean? Was leaving the right decision that he could have made?
20 minutes and 10 different message variations later, and Dean had settled on the perfect message to send. One that wasn’t too emotional or aloof.
“I asked him if we could try being friends again,” Castiel said, not taking his eyes off of Tucker. “I was a blubbering idiot today, Gabe.”
Castiel fumbled with his phone, searching for a playlist that would match his  energy  this morning. He settled upon “Today’s New Alternative Hits” on his Spotify and jumped into the shower. An upbeat new release from this up and coming band filled the bathroom, something about shampoo bottles, seemed fitting for a shower song.
Thank you so much for still with my story! Sorry I haven't been posting more frequently, I've been struggling with writer's block and a lack of motivation between moving and finishing my thesis. I hope to be able to post more chapters soon and develop this baby of a fic that I've created. Thank you for the comments and the kudos!!! They definitely provide a lot of motivation to keep writing :)
“Ok good,” Jo replied quickly, jumping up from her seat and crowding Dean on the couch. She whipped out her phone and faster than Dean’s injured brain could comprehend, was FaceTiming Sam.
“Hey man, you good?” Dean asked, one eyebrow raised and two cups of coffee in his hands. “You look like someone pissed in your cheerios.”
“Or what?” Castiel said, his voice low, the words rumbling from his chest.
“Dean? Sweetheart, look at me,” Mary tilted her son’s face up so their eyes met, “you are going to be ok, baby, I promise, angels are watching over you.”
“Well, it took him a while to say much of anything, all he wanted to do for the first hour or so was drink, beer then whiskey,” -Cas listened to Benny and the pit in his stomach grew with every word- “finally after about an hour, he started talking about his mom’s accident and how he was right there with her when she died. No kid should ever have to go through something like that, ya know? His piece o’ shit dad blamed him for Mary being in the car that night and of course, Dean being Dean, he blames himself too. -”
Dean took a long drag from his drink, leaving Castiel’s question to simmer and draw out the tension between them until Castiel felt like he was about to snap. As Dean drank, Castiel’s fingers wrapped around his mug and he gripped it tight until his knuckles were white, he was going to let Dean take his time to answer, he was determined not to rush him.
The hours ticked by and Dean still hadn’t returned. Dinner had long since grown cold and Cas’s anxiety grew with it. He paced along one of their rugs, nearly wearing a hole in it from his constant turns. No longer worried about Dean’s feelings and instead becoming increasingly concerned with his physical well-being, Cas fumbled with his phone until he found Dean’s number in his favorites list.
-Dude stop! Focus up here, you’re supposed to be figuring out if you have real feelings for the guy, not fantasizing about chick flick moments! Get it together, Jesus- Dean thought to himself, shaking his head to clear his mind.
“Hello?” a man’s voice answered. Castiel was momentarily dazed, a man had answered Dean’s phone, but it wasn’t Dean. His entire world stopped spinning, who the hell was answering his boyfriend’s phone? Where had Dean gone?
Charlie hadn’t known Dean for very long. She just transferred to Cathedral High School this past summer and met him during the in-service workshops held in August. The two quickly became close friends, Dean often joking that if not for Jo, Charlie would be the kid sister he didn’t have and hadn’t asked for. She knew the basic things about Dean Winchester like his greatest responsibilities were to his baby brother in college at Stanford and to his genius, medical student boyfriend. She knew about his love for 70s rock and roll and his prized muscle car left with his family back in Kansas.
A symphony of gasps and moans filled their tiny apartment. Feeling how close he was, Dean reached down and started stroking Cas in time with his thrusts. Cas’s body stiffened, gripping Dean’s waist between his legs as he climaxed. Dean finished right after Cas; he pulled out and, feeling boneless, flopped down on the air mattress next to Cas.
When he turned back to his brother, the questions left his mind. Castiel was wearing a worn, black sabbath t-shirt and grey sweatpants that were too large for him. His normally fluffy black tufts of hair laid flat against his scalp, his eyes were bloodshot from tears unshed, and his naturally warm complexion was drained and pale. The last time Gabe had seen his brother in such a state was shortly after he had moved out of the apartment he shared with Dean. In fact, he didn’t know that Castiel still had this shirt and pair of sweatpants.
Castiel stepped over to Dean and carefully wrapped an arm around Dean’s waist, he looked up at Dean to gauge his reaction to this physical touch. When he didn’t protest, Castiel took Dean’s arm and wrapped it around his shoulders.
The two of them stood in silence once more, Cas ran his hands across the expanse of his lover’s back, taking the time to appreciate the man that stood before him and the suit he was wearing. He got to thinking about the meaning of his own suit, how he used to wear all black, and then about 6 years ago he made a change to green after he asked Dean to marry him. His favorite color was green and he wanted to carry a piece of Dean with him during his missions.
“There is nothing more I want than to help you live your best life Dean, and to make you happy, but it’s really hard to keep giving all of myself and my advice to someone who won’t listen to me,” Cas said, and walked out of the bedroom.
“Dean,” Cas said, placing a gentle hand over Dean’s, his other hand tilting Dean’s chin back to look into his eyes, “it's ok, I want you to let me in, at your pace.”
Baby come on-
“Please Sam, just let me get through this without interruptions.” Cas said, sitting up straight and wiping his palms dry on his scrub pants, one knee bouncing,  “this is going to be hard enough as it is.”
Sam and Jess were quiet for a minute, both glancing at each other in desperate hope that something one of them could say would get them out of this hole they had dug with Dean.
Gabe sat back and waited to see what effect his words would have on Castiel.
Not Dean but Cain, his archnemesis? In his bathroom? Wait, if Cain was here and Dean wasn’t, where was Dean? Castiel’s mind was spinning as he stood there, silently watching Cain struggle to get his mask off, seemingly unaware that he had an audience.
Dean sat in a dimly lit Italian restaurant in Boston’s North End. The crisp smell of freshly baked bread filled the dining space, mingling with the rich aromas of the perfectly seasoned meats and aged red wine that defined the neighborhood surrounding them. He let his eyes wander over the clean, white tablecloth, over the full glasses of wine, to the candle at the center of the table. He thought back to the nights that he and Cas would spend here. The celebrations for the end of semesters and straight A’s, anniversaries, and birthdays that were spent in the North End. He looked to his right, to the small corner booth that housed these memories of toasts and cheers and promises to come back for the next occasion. A smile crept its way across Dean’s face as he reminisced on those nights, and he opened his mouth to comment on how they had given their table away. But the words died in his mouth when he caught sight of brown eyes across the table from him, rather than blue. Right, Dean thought, I’m here with Lisa, not Cas.
“I hope that you think about what I said at the hospital” -Castiel worried one of the buttons on his trench coat between two of his fingers - “I would really like to get a cup of coffee or something sometime if you ever feel up to it.”
“Hell yeah honeybee, of course I came here with you,” - Dean rolled his head up so that he could meet Cas’s eyes - “I’d follow you into the dark if you asked me.” Dean leaned forward and placed a light, tiny kiss on the end of Cas’s nose.
“Not great, Gabe.”
“I was there, where were you?” Castiel shot back, hoping to redirect this guilt away from him and onto Sam. He finally learned that the weight of the world no longer rested on his shoulders, that the emotions and actions of others were not his responsibility, that he wasn’t the only person to let Dean down. Sam should accept that.
Cas drew his lips into a small scowl and crawled over Dean, settling into the bed next to him. He sat silently for a moment before wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulders.
“I understand Cassie. You two had something special, and after having this time apart, I think that you and Dean could rebuild a friendship. But Cas?” Gabe said, pulling Castiel’s attention towards him, “Please be careful, for your sake and Dean’s. Just give him a little time.”
Dean stepped forward out of Cas’s touch and turned around to face him. Cas was looking down at his feet and Dean softly placed his hand under Cas’s chin to turn his gaze back to him.
“You know what? Fuck this,” Dean said, standing up from the desk and grabbing his crutches. His entire body ached, the tension sitting in his shoulders and neck from holding up the weight of the world was too much and his hips were killing him from dragging that stupid cast around everywhere. Dean grabbed a heating pad from his nightstand drawer and plugged it in, he also retrieved a compress from the drawer and headed into the kitchen with it. He only felt a little self conscious about the things as he was waiting for the microwave to finish heating up the compress. Ok so yeah he learned a few self care tricks from Charlie and she left some things behind when she moved out, so what?
Dean didn’t need to be told twice, slowly pulling out of Cas until he was almost completely out of him, before slamming back in. Nearly hitting that spot on his first try. Cas’s vision whited out and he gripped Dean’s back and shoulders to ground himself. He knew that there would be fingertip shaped bruises and scratches down Dean’s back when all was said and done, but hey, more evidence of his claim on him right?
Dean and Jo stood silently in the kitchen for several moments. His eyes locked on Jo with a glare of questioning indignance which she returned this gaze with equal stubbornness. After a pause, she gave a huff of exasperation and placed the knife back on the counter before brushing past Dean on her way out of the kitchen. Dean shook his head and forced himself to remember that while he was willing to give Castiel a chance to have a small place in his life again, his family would not be so quick to change their opinion of him; that they would make that man fight his way out of hell before they accepted him back into their good graces.  He looked down towards his feet and smiled softly at the thought of his protective family before turning back out of the kitchen.
Finally, Dean was able to get his key in the lock and they stepped into his apartment. He dropped his keys on the entry table and quickly crutched down the hallway and into the living room. He managed to turn and -whump- down onto the sofa by the time Castiel stepped into the living room.
Cas closed the door behind them, closing out the stress and chaos from school so that he could focus fully on Dean. Cas sat Dean down on the edge of the bed and handed him the glass of water left on the nightstand.
“That’s great Dean, but one thing,” Castiel said, finally finding the words, finally finding control of his mouth, “if you don’t mind my asking, who is Pamela?”
The already expansive smile on Dean’s face grew larger, he bit his lower lip and took the paper from Cas.
He slid his key into the ignition and started the car, holding his breath until the engine turned over. He eased the car out of the parking space and drove himself back to his apartment in silence.
“Dean!” Charlie yelled, her eyes wide and mouth agape, “you said ‘nothing serious’?? You got cut with a knife and hit by a car and you didn’t call me? When did this happen?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean knew that he should ask Castiel to leave, that this day had stretched out for far too long and he needed rest, but there was something about his being here that was… comfortable and familiar. Despite the pain that Dean still felt whenever he thought about this other man, and the weight that was currently resting on his chest, Dean didn’t know if he wanted Castiel to leave. Dean’s discomfort must have been painted across his face, because after only a handful of seconds sitting in silence, Castiel awkwardly and sheepishly picked up his things.
Thank you for the kudos and comments!
Dean also had his hands working on getting Cas’s pants off of him. The two of them raced to undo the other’s pants, to get that first touch of skin, to wrap their eager fingers around each other. Dean won, sliding the zipper to Cas’s cheap suit pants down. He slid his hand under the elastic on Cas’s boxers, lightly brushing over his dick, eliciting a moan from Cas. He finally got the buckle undone and forced the zipper down, freeing Dean’s dick from the confines of his slacks. He nipped at Dean’s lips, breaking the skin and tasting the metallic blood.
“What in the hell is this?!” A sharp female voice interrupted them. The two men turned their heads towards the sound and watched Anna storm down the hall.
Castiel heard fumbling in the bathroom, grunting and panting as though someone was out of breath.
“Ok, what are you going to say to him?” Castiel asked himself as he grabbed his shampoo from the edge of the tub, swaying with the beat of the music. Obviously he was still head over heels for the guy but there was no way that they were going to be getting back together, not after the way he walked out on Dean all those years ago.
“Yeah, actually that would be great. Thank you.” Dean said with a soft nod to Castiel.
Hi everyone! thanks for reading and for the comments and kudos!
“Oh my god, I should not have asked.” Cas spat out quickly, cutting Dean off before he had the chance to respond. “I should not be prying into your business and we barely know each other and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable and please let me think of literally anything else that we can talk about oh my god I can’t believe that I did that, I don’t know what possessed me to ask-”
Castiel went to take another step into the bathroom when Cain finally got his mask off and turned back towards the doorway.
“Yeah Dean,” -sniffles- “Everything’s great. Absolutely perfect.” He looked up at Dean’s face. “Say, I uh, set up the air mattress in the bedroom, if you erm…”
Castiel took another deep breath to stabilize himself, he knew that everything seemed duller and dimmer because Dean Winchester was the light in his life. He was the driving force that Castiel needed in his life. Even if they weren’t going to get back together, Castiel knew that having Dean anywhere near him, that having him involved in his life in any capacity would be better than losing him again. If he couldn’t love him publicly, he could love him silently.
-Pack yourself a toothbrush dear, pack yourself a favorite blouse.
Hi Gang! sorry this was late getting posted! Live's been busy writing my thesis but I'll try to get on a more regular posting schedule moving forward!
Without greeting, Dean flung the fridge door open and in one swift motion, grabbed the nearest beer and popped the top in one hand, little drops of spray coating his hand. He gulped the beer down as Cas watched in stunned silence from the living room. Dean swallowed and set the empty can down on the counter next to him before breathing deep and looking back at Cas. The two held eye contact for several seconds before Cas finally broke the silence.
“Yes, I drove him home and I ran into Jo while I was in his apartment. She did not seem super pleased to see me.” - Castiel stood with Tucker and walked him around the room, the boy babbled and wiggled in his arms  - “right as I was leaving, I asked Dean to consider getting coffee sometime, and I told him that I wanted to know how he was doing, you know, just as friends.”
Their first kiss was clumsy with clashing teeth and sloppy tongues but Cas’s nerves were electric. He had dreamed about this moment, about how Dean would feel pressed up against him, about whether or not Dean wanted this too. They remained in this moment, the two men sharing the same air, finally caving into the feelings they held for each other. Finally admitting that they needed each other like a drowning man needs air.
“Gabriel, I am in love with Dean Winchester and I always have been and I think that I always will be. It killed me these past two years to not know what was going on in his life, to be so removed from him. When he texted me last night to get coffee, I didn’t think he was asking me to get back together or anything like that, so please do not assume that I’m under some delusion that we’re going to get back together because we’re not. I know that.” -Castiel paused here to catch his breath, he spoke quickly, desperate to get the words out before the tears started. He could feel the pressure behind his eyes and the burning in the back of his throat from fighting them back-
“Ok Dean, that was admirable of you and I am glad that someone was there to help that woman and her child. Now, let’s get you checked up and discharged so that you can spend your day with family. Speaking of which, where’s Sam? I expected him to have been busting down the door by now.” Castiel said as he crossed the room and sat down on the wheeling stool next to Dean’s bed.
We’ll have driven through the night
Dean stood and winked at Cas “Trust me.” Then he turned and was out the door.
“I have one important question for you,” She said in a stern tone that managed to pull Dean’s attention away from the Star Trek Timeline Poster on her wall and back on her. “Dean, do you love Castiel still?”
“Well, Lisa, I’m Dean and I would say that it was no problem but, heh, that wouldn’t really be true now would it?” Dean replied with a light chuckle in his voice, followed by a light wince. Right, he was hurt. “But hey, really though, I can handle this, I’ve been through a lot worse and come out the other side of it. I would rather this be me laying in the street than you or Ben.”
“I’m glad to hear that,” Castiel said, his head tilting to the side as he studied Dean’s face, analyzing the minutiae of his features.
“CHEESE!” Dean yelled before kissing Cas’s cheek as the camera took its picture.
“I’m serious, look at me,” Dean repeated, waiting for Sam’s eyes to meet his. “I know I’m not great at the mushy-gushy stuff but here goes. Jessica loves you Sam, she loves you so much. She thinks you hung the moon and lit the stars yourself. She thinks so highly of you, I sometimes can’t believe that she’s real. She is always going to be there to push you and support you and love you, and all she wants in return is for you to do the same thing for her. She loves you and needs you so much. Jess wants to be a part of this family, Sammy, she’s told me before.”
Dean whipped around to look at Charlie, his eyes were wide and glassy. Her concern was spread across her face, the crinkle between her eyebrows, her lips softly turned down at the corners, her eyes tracking Dean’s as they moved around the room in a desperate attempt to avoid making contact with her.
He cleared his throat and with a wink, Dean began to sing.
“How’d you know?” He asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
The snow outside was beginning to slow when Dean’s phone vibrated in his pocket. As he fumbled under the blankets to retrieve his phone from his pocket, he knew it was Cas that was calling him. His guess was confirmed when he saw Cas’s name and face spread across his phone screen. He silenced the vibration but let the call continue to ring.
Cas’s heart skipped a beat.
See notes at the end
Sam’s eyes widened at this last statement, it hadn’t occurred to Dean until just then that Sam  didn’t realize how close he and Jess were, that she’d become like a sister to him.
He nearly had his phone back in his pocket when he felt it vibrate.
“Jessica? Jessica Moore? Tall, blonde, curly haired?” Castiel asked.
“Damn man! That’s so cool! Do you know what you might want to practice yet?” Dean asked, pulling Cas’s attention away from his hands, pumping him for more information.
“Are you ok?” Cas asked, finally finding the words to respond to Dean. “Do you need anything?”
-----
There was silence on the other end. Castiel was about to open his mouth to ask if  Gabe was still there when he heard a door close on his brother’s end of the call.
He felt his one good knee wobble and almost buckle under him, he gripped the edge of the counter hard enough that his knuckles were white from the effort.
“Babe, yes ok I’m with you, of course.” Dean said with an ear-to-ear smile on his face. “I love you, Cas.” Dean reached to cup Cas’s face and pull him in for a tender kiss
“You already know that I only ever get one thing at coffee shops,” Castiel responded, returning the tone.
“You really expect me to believe that you don’t know what’s going on with you? Do you think I’m stupid, Dean? Or neglectful? Explain to me how you can expect me to let this go? I want the absolute best for you but I CANNOT do that for you or give that to you if you DON’T LET ME HELP YOU!”
“Dean,” -Cas rubbed the bridge of his nose between his eyes, his tone sharp - “I am more than happy to help you through things if I thought for a second that you would take my advice, but I cannot continue to sit here while you blatantly ignore what I have to say. I asked you everyday this week how work was going, I gave you the same advice every time you told me you were struggling with this and every time you shot me down. You wouldn’t even entertain what I had to say. I can tell that this is weighing on you and it kills me to see you hurt, but I don’t have it in me right now to deal with this,” Cas stated bluntly, his voice cracking near the end and his jaw held in a tight clench.
“Dean? Do you want to tell your brother about your day today?” Jo turned towards Dean, putting him on the spot and causing the color in his face to deepen and reach his hairline.
The door closed softly behind Charlie at the end of the night. Dean sat on the couch slightly stunned from his conversation with her, at his acknowledgement of his own loneliness. It was incredibly unlike him to be so forthcoming with anyone, granted, he had been working on his communication skills with Pamela, but still.
He stood in the bathroom in silence, only the sound of running water to occupy the space. Dean stared at his reflection in the mirror, he took in his bloodshot eyes, the grimace on his face, and the worry lines traversing his forehead.
“What’s going on? This cast is new.” She nudged the end of Dean’s cast with her foot.
“Where on Earth do you think I would be without you?” Dean asked. “I love you so deeply, and so completely. Thank you for saying this to me, I’m really glad that this is how tonight ended up going.”
Outside Hellflame Coffee, a woman had been hustling down the sidewalk with her young son when a man jumped out and grabbed the boy. He stood with his arms wrapped around the boy and a pocket knife to the boy’s throat. He was yelling something at the woman, although Dean couldn’t quite make out the words that he was saying. Dean leapt out of his seat and was out on the sidewalk before he had a clear idea of what he was going to do.
“Heya Sammy,” Dean said as he entered the room before falling onto the couch next to his brother.
“My doctor was one Dr. Castiel Novack.”
Dean pulled away out of the kiss, leaving the two of them breathless and panting. Cas took Dean in all at once, his mouth slack as he looked him up and down. Dean was beautiful, right where Cas left his on the counter with his black pants undone and white button down torn open. His mind blanked, having Dean here in this moment was all he wanted. He had laid awake at night, had wasted time in the shower trying to push any and all thoughts of Dean coming apart out of his mind. He had imagined how Dean would look, how his skin would flush and expose those freckles of his, how his lust blown pupils would look against the crisp green of his eyes, but no amount of time daydreaming prepared Cas for the reality he was experiencing.  Cas looked over Dean’s shoulder at the mirror to find that it was beginning to fog up.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had spent the last two years contemplating the design of his apartment. He liked the furniture that he and Castiel had bought together and he liked the way they were arranged in the apartment. This didn’t have anything to do with Castiel, but that stupid Japanese flow thing. Everything flowed in this room and throughout the entire space, but was this going to betray his feelings? Was Castiel going to think that Dean kept everything the same in case he ever came back? Had Dean changed enough? Had Dean changed too much? He chewed on his bottom lip as he watched Castiel approach the small strip of wall that connected the living room and the kitchen.
“What in the hell do you think you are doing? Coming to my place of work?” he finally asked, his voice gravelly.
“Meg, I appreciate the concern but I can handle myself, and besides it’ll probably just be the one drink for her to make it up to me. You know I haven’t dated anyone since… well, you know.” Dean replied, closing his eyes so he wouldn’t have to look at Meg.
“Dean? Are you okay?” Castiel whispered into Dean’s ear.
“I had to beg you to let me in, to let me offer advice, to help you. I offered my opinion and yet day after day you come home in a sour mood and seek comfort in a bottle rather than me. If you want to continue talking about it, maybe you should talk to “Benny” since you’re so “close” and all,” Cas said with finger quotes. He replaced the glasses on his face and returned to his notes.
The two began moving boxes into their new place. The first things unpacked were the coffee pot and an air mattress. Both had decided to sell their larger pieces of furniture before leaving Kansas as neither could see the point in renting a large moving trunk for their cheap furniture. Besides, they wanted to go shopping for new things to fill their apartment. This new chapter of their lives was not going to be started with the material objects of a previous chapter. They wanted everything to be a symbol of who they were at that moment in time. At least this was the reasoning that Cas gave Dean for why they should buy all new furniture once they got to Boston, but Dean knew that Cas was looking for any excuse to hit up Ikea.
Dean maintained a cautious smile on his face as he said goodbye to Castiel but then dropped his face in exhaustion as Castiel rounded the corner to say goodbye to Jo in the kitchen. Dean lifted his head when he heard a scuffle and a bang in the kitchen. He quickly gathered his crutches and limped out of the living room. As he entered the kitchen, he found Jo with the largest knife Dean had in his kitchen, and a look in her eyes that would smite Castiel where he stood if she possessed that kind of power spread across her delicate features. Castiel carefully and quietly took his leave.
“Well, as I’m sure you can guess, I have a secret life the same as you apparently, Cas, or should I call you “Angel Blade”?” Dean asked, wagging his eyebrows. “By day I train cops and by night, I commit crimes. I’m not sure what all you wanted me to say.”
“Dude, I’m Mia Wallace and you’re gonna be Vince Vega. You know, from Pulp Fiction? I just made you watch that movie last week. Come on man, it’ll be fun!” Dean said, lifting up both his hands to bring the tie and hair straightener up to Cas’s eye level.
Castiel set his bottle brush down and checked his watch and saw that it was almost 6pm, almost 6 and a half hours after their fight that morning. Drying his hands on a rag, he opened the refrigerator door and checked to see what he had for dinner. Opting for a simple spaghetti dish with a side salad, Cas started a pot of water for the pasta.
“Hello Becky, I am also ready. Can I please have a large, hot honey latte?” Castiel said, peeling his eyes away from Dean to address their perky waitress.
He stomped out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him. He didn’t look back on his way out, but if he had, Dean would have seen Castiel crumple on the floor right outside their bedroom, and sob.
Castiel blanched at the mention of Pamela, his mind running with different possibilities and scenarios. Dean had moved on, Pamela was his new girlfriend. She was better than you in every way Castiel, she fixed Dean, she convinced him that he was worth saving, she got him to go back to school. He loves her more than you, he talks about his childhood and the abuse with her, he trusts her more than he ever trusted you.
“Dean, look, I know that you only live on the second floor, but I want you to let me help you up the stairs.” Castiel turned toward Dean and spoke softly. He knew that this was going to be a fight with Dean based on past experiences with his complete refusal of any kind of assistance.
“Ugh, fine.” Dan said, dramatically rolling his eyes at his best friend. He was willing to give in to Charlie it if meant ending what could only be an agonizing conversation about Castiel.
Several minutes ticked by, the two men seeking solace in each other’s arms. Cas finally pulled himself out of Dean’s grasp, he placed a hand on Dean’s cheek, breathing in the comforting scent of his partner’s shampoo and body wash.
Cas pulled away first, one hand sliding up to Dean’s hair, pulling it hard enough to tilt his head back, exposing his neck. He allowed his free hand to caress Dean’s face, brushing over his cheekbone and tracing the sharp ridge of his jaw. Cas took in the sight of Dean Winchester before him. His lips red and swollen, his eyes clouded in lust.
Gabe looked at his brother, worried that he would regress to where he had been two years ago. When Castiel glanced back at him, he seemed sad and confronted with a devastating past, but not broken, not like before. Castiel turned his attention back to Tucker, bouncing him on his knee and cooing softly at the infant. As he watched Castiel play with his son, Gabe was no longer worried that his brother would fall into as deep a depression as before, that this was a hiccup for him. His original hypothesis that Dean and Castiel would put themselves back together with one very important piece of themselves missing was proven to be correct, at least for Castiel. And he had good reason to believe that the same was true for Dean.
“Dude, if you didn’t want to go on a date with me, you could have just told me. You didn't have to lead me on or just humor me.” Dean said, breaking the silence and slowly pulling his gaze up from the floor until he met Cas’s eyes.
He returned to his desk anxious to complete one full task that night. He opened up the word document that he created to outline his end of the semester paper for school. He had already started the final paper but he liked to fully flesh out each section’s outline before he started writing it. He just needed to wrap up the conclusion then he’d be done with his second to last semester of grad school.
Suddenly, the scene went black and he could hear his father’s voice- ‘ITS YOUR FAULT DEAN’- a small whimper escaped Dean -’HAD YOU JUST DONE WHAT YOU WERE TOLD SHE’D BE ALIVE’- tears were steadily streaming down Dean’s face as he drowned in his sobs. ‘DAMMIT DEAN’- Dean screamed as blow after blow landed on his back and on his arms as he tried to protect himself. John continued screaming at his son but the words were lost.  Dean tried to fight back, kicking and throwing his arms as tears flowed and he struggled for breath- **
“Oh you, uh, have a little something,” Cas said, pointing to his own lip. Dean touched his face to find the foam, and instead of using a napkin, used his lip to lick the foam off. Castiel sat there, a beat of momentary awe washed over him as the most attractive man he had ever been in the vicinity in, used his tongue to lick his lips mere inches away from him.
Cas stared at Sam, his head falling to one side in a slight tilt.
“Where did all this stuff come from?” Dean gestured with his chin at the surplus of candles, string lights, and rose petals filling the apartment.
The whole time that Dean and I were together, I thought that we were friends, Sam. I valued the time that we spent together, and I was proud to know you. And I lost you too.”
Cas decided, enough with the pity party, Dean left him to his own devices and he was going to spend the rest of the night drinking, he was at a party so why the hell not?
“Dude, I’m serious, I’m asking you.” Dean said, reaching across the table and gently grabbing Cas’s wrist.
“Oh wow, Dean, teaching is incredible,” - Cas set his mug down and reached across the table to lay a hand on Dean’s- “I know I could never do it, I hate people a lot. I’ve been told that my ‘people skills’ are ‘rusty’ “ Cas said, removing his hand from Dean’s to add air-quotes.
Castiel closed his eyes and gripped the phone a little tighter in his hand. He swallowed hard and took a deep breath to settle his rapid heart rate and his churning stomach. He struggled to find a response to Benny, to find something to say that would be appropriate for the moment, to find words that conveyed his gratitude for Benny’s help and not his hopelessness at the situation.
“Well, what did he say?” Gabe said in between the funny faces he was making at his son.
“No, Dean, you’ve had ‘difficulties’ before and they haven’t affected you like this, there’s something more here.”
“Hells yeah I hit you! It’s about damn time you ask her! She’s put up with more than enough with this family to earn a permanent place here. Jess is already as much of a Winchester as she’s going to get, so make it official already, Sammy Damn”
After another minute, Dean finally got the notification that he’d received a new voicemail. He typed in his phone passcode, his heart seizing as he put in their anniversary date to unlock the sleek device Castiel gave him for his birthday nearly a year ago. He selected the phone icon and pulled up the most recent voicemail. His finger lingered over Cas’s name, hesitating before playing the message. He placed the phone up to his ear and held his breath.
Dean hesitated for a moment, blinking his eyes hard and swallowing to force back his emotions.
Castiel rinsed out the thick lather from his hair and his thoughts drifted to Dean as a college freshman. How beautiful he was when they first met, how the sun reflected the gold in his eyes, how Dean had rendered Castiel nearly speechless upon first sight. Castiel remembered the apprehension he felt when he asked Dean out to coffee that first time, how he was convinced that Dean wouldn’t show up and that he had made a fool of himself. Then Dean showed up and the rest is history.
“Our last few months were, ”- Castiel racked his brain for a fitting description of the end of his and Dean’s relationship, - “complicated to say the least, and that isn’t even the right word for it, I’m not sure there is one.”
Their kisses deepened and grew more urgent. Dean laid down on top of Cas, using his knee to spread Cas’s legs. Dean felt Cas’s arousal against his own. Cas rocked his hips up, eliciting a soft moan from the other man.
“Oh, ok good,” Dean visibly relaxed, the pinch of his eyebrows released and his shoulders dropped from around his ears. “Do you want another drink? I’ll buy you something?” Dean gestured over his shoulder at the bar.
See notes at the end
“You- want me to fuck you? Without a condom?” Dean asked warily, his eyes widening.
All of the emotions that Cas felt in the car towards Dean are being released in this moment, Cas is all consumed with his love for Dean Winchester and cannot get enough. He breathes in Dean’s scent, a mixture of his body wash and leather. He runs his hands through Dean’s hair, a little longer than he usually wears it and Cas is able to grip it and twist his fingers in it. His tongue slips into Dean’s mouth and he can taste him. Pure Dean, and he’s all Cas’s. Unbelievably Castiel’s.
“Look,  you can be upset with us for protecting you or for trying to. But I don’t regret what we did and if I could do it again, I would. I’m so proud of you and the progress you’ve made. Don’t blame Sam and me for being worried about you.” Jess said, her eyes red-rimmed and her mouth turned up in a small smile that let Dean know how much she loved him.
Cas stood there, still with tears in his eyes. He laid his hands over Dean’s.
“Here, let me help you with that, and yes I will ask, Dean, what the hell is going on here? Why are you dressed like this?” Cas replied as he crossed the room to help his husband undo the zipper on the back of his suit.
Garth’s comment about Castiel’s hair was left hanging in the silence between the three men. Garth wheeled Dean in his gurney until Castiel reached out and took the other handle. Dean hadn’t taken his eyes off Castiel since he was taken out of the back of the ambulance, it was almost as if he couldn't believe the sight he was seeing. After over two years, he was in contact with Castiel Novak once more.
“I’m serious though, I really don’t think that Dean could survive another heartbreak like when you guys broke up, I’ve never seen him that broken,” Sam continued, lifting his head back up to look at Castiel, his voice wavering.
“Dean, I am so sorry, “ Cas said, his voice cracked and gravelly. He peeled his eyes from their interlocked hands and looked back up at Dean, tears welled up in his eyes, threatening to spill over.
Sam’s smile faltered and he shifted uncomfortably. His eyes downcast, away from Dean, and his hands picking at the seam on his jeans. Dean could see his jaw clench as  though he was biting back words.
Three hours passed before Castiel felt human enough again to leave their bedroom. He peeled the blankets back like a cocooned, and slowly made his way to the kitchen. He stood there, his melancholy delaying his thoughts and decision making. Finally, the gears started turning again and he began moving all the dishes from the sink to the dishwasher.
“Also good, I finished med school, as you can tell,” Castiel said, gesturing to the crutches and the cast on Dean’s leg.
Cas closed his mouth and studied Sam, taking in his body language, the creases in his face, the heavy emotion in his eyes. Sam truly had never heard the story of the breakup, had never been burdened with the details. Despite what Dean had told him about making an effort to be more open and honest about his emotions with the people in his life, the termination of their nearly seven-year relationship had been outside the bounds of what he could talk about.
“Hi, again, I know I just said that but I am flustered and scared and I do not know where to begin to thank you for what you did. I’m Lisa, by the way, and that’s my son, Ben.” Lisa pointed over to the boy sitting on the curb nearby.
Less than 15 minutes later Gabriel was using his own key to let himself into Castiel’s apartment.
Dean is shocked at how easily the words flow out of his mouth and roll off his tongue, as though the dam holding them back had been cracked for a while and tonight was the final crack. He closed his eyes, tilted his head up towards the ceiling, and took a deep breath. He was able to steady himself, able to prepare himself to open himself up to someone other than Cas. He opened his eyes and sat up in the bed, crossing his legs criss-cross to face Charlie.
Mary’s grip on his hand loosened, Dean’s heart was pounding in his little chest. Why wasn’t the ambulance there yet? Why hadn’t someone tried to help them? The fire was growing closer, licking at the ground right outside their door, Dean was sweating, his shirt sticking to his back. Dean looked around for anything he could use, there had to be something he could do. He had to find a way out of this, it was his fault they were there in the first place, it was his fault that Mary was on the road when she was, it was his fault that she wasn’t safe with Sam and Jo and Ellen. He was supposed to be playing with a friend but he was too chicken-shit to stay over, so he had called his mom to come pick him up. He faked a stomach-ache to go home and now his mom was going to die and there was nothing he could do.
“Yeah, it's from an accident a couple weeks ago. Nothing super serious, I was helping this woman and kid out from this creepy guy on the street. The guy lunged at me with a blade, nicked me,” -Dean lifted up the bottom of his shirt to show Charlie the healing cut, ignoring her gasp- “And I jumped back away from the guy and” -Dean clapped his hands together- “this car hit me, broke my leg.”
“Dr. Milton,” Castiel said evenly, “this is an old friend” -he gestured towards Sam- “I haven’t seen him in a while and apparently we have some issues that we need to discuss.”
The nostalgia-inducing effect of Castiel’s touch was lifted when he untangled himself from Dean. As he stood there fumbling to get his keys into the lock, Dean’s anxiety mounted.
Cas knelt on the ground between Dean’s knees, sitting back to rest on his heels while he ran his hands up and down Dean’s thighs. He kneaded the pads of his fingers into the dense, overworked muscles.
He grabbed his left elbow and bent his arm behind his head, pulling the elbow into a deep stretch. He took full, purposeful breaths and concentrated on the areas of his body that were holding too much tension. The previous 16 and a half hours had taken their toll on his joints and muscles. He originally was only supposed to be in this hospital for his usual 12 hours, but of course some intern came down with the flu and good-for-nothing Gordon Walker suggested his name for a replacement. Castiel shook his head, ‘it was December in a cold city, of course the flu is going around; why aren’t these doctors and nurses taking it more seriously and taking care of themselves?’ he thought to himself.
👍🏼👍🏼 see you then
Obviously, not having Castiel in his life was not the answer to happiness. Dean stepped into the shower and rinsed his hair, letting the hot water cascade down his body, tracing the lines of his muscles and filling the room with steam. He thought of Castiel, of how after so many years and the heartbreaking memories of their last night together, that he still wanted this man in his life, that he was the missing piece Dean had been looking for. The drive back from the hospital planted this idea in Dean’s mind, but it wasn’t until his “not a date” date tonight with Lisa that he was not going to be happy and totally himself again until he had his best friend back.
The door closed behind Dean, the soft click of the lock cutting through the fog in his head. Dean walked home from the train station on autopilot, he blinked hard, taking in his surroundings, not realizing that he was already home.
“Dudes what the FUCK! Get out of the bathroom!” Someone yelled from outside.
“OK FINE, HE WAS THE DOCTOR THAT TOOK CARE OF ME AT THE HOSPITAL WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM ME JO?” Dean spilled, his resolve breaking.
Thanks for the kudos and comments!!!
Dean leaned forwards into Cas’s arms, absently allowing himself to be pulled into a hug, a loving embrace. John wasn’t here, but Castiel was. Dean should be thankful for that, he should be thankful for Cas, but his stomach remained unsettled.
Castiel dragged Sam into the nearby doctor’s locker room. He threw Sam into the room and slammed the door shut behind them. He pointed at an empty bench and walked around the stacks of lockers to ensure that the room was empty. Castiel moved to sit on the bench opposite Sam. He gripped the edge of the bench, his knuckles white from the force. He clenched his jaw and glared at Sam. His mind raced as he struggled to process the situation.
The first photo of Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester outside of their new brownstone apartment captured the two in a moment of pure joy. Cas was caught mid-laugh, the kind that left your stomach aching and your cheeks sore. His eyes were closed, he had one arm slung over Dean’s shoulers, holding onto his neck, and his other hand was cupping Dean’s cheek as he kissed him.
“What?” Cas replied, setting his pen down and turning to face Dean. “What did you say? I didn’t hear you.”
And he began.
Good luck saving lives! 💉🤕😷
As they turned onto Dean’s street, his stomach dropped and his heart clenched in the anticipation of having Castiel back inside his apartment. Castiel pulled the car to a stop and looked over at Dean, whose eyes were glued to the living room window of his second-story place.
“Oh wow, it's already been an hour and a half”- Castiel glanced down at his watch -”I’m not sure what your plans were for today and I don’t want to keep you from anything…”
“Dean,” Charlie said softly, “nothing’s wrong with you.” -she outlined his cheekbone with her thumb gently- “you already know why you can’t connect with someone new, even if you won’t admit it to yourself yet.”
The trance they were in was broken by the sharp, sudden rapping of knuckles on the bathroom door.
“How’d you guess?” Dean responded, wiping the dried tears from his face.
As Dean crunched through the thin layer of snow already coating the sidewalk, a singular tear escaped his eye, leaving a freezing trail of moisture down his cheek. He reached up and brushed the tear off and pulled his hat down lower on his head. The cold bit and the wind cut through his jacket like it was tissue. Dean left his apartment in a rush and only thought to grab his hat and scarf off the hook by the door, neglecting to retrieve his coat from the hall closet. He trudged through the accumulating snow until he arrived at the front doorstep to Charlie Bradbury’s brownstone.
“What the hell Dean?!” Meg scolded, smacking Dean’s shoulder.
“Then ask me about my day! Force me to talk like you always do! Help me with this Jack issue!” Dean said, exasperated as he fell into the armchair across from Cas.
“Yeah man! I’ve been meaning to ask you about that, how was finishing school?” Dean said, his eyes lighting up.
“SAMMY!!! You would NOT BELIEVE who I found in Dean’s apartment with him today!” Jo screamed into the phone, barely giving Sam the opportunity to answer the call. Dean shot Jo a glare and felt the color and heat rise to his cheeks.
Dean rose his eyebrows at his brother’s outburst, guess that was a touchy subject that he would get back to later. Or press now.
Cas didn’t have time to take a breath before Dean’s lips were  against his. Pressed against each other in the small bathroom, they shared the same breath. Dean hooked a leg around Cas’s waist and spread his legs to pull them closer together. Cas ran his hands down Dean’s chest playing with the buttons only done halfway up, slowly undoing them. The music outside was loud enough for them to hear in the bathroom. Their breaths fell in line with the beat, as the tempo increased, so did their movements. Cas rocked against Dean, creating friction between them. Dean responded with a moan and tightening his grip in Cas’s hair.
“What? Did you just say that you want to retire? You find out that Cain is actually me and immediately you’re ready to retire?”
“Jesus, Cas, how’d you get over here so fast? We should put a bell on you,” Dean replied sharply, pushing past Cas into the living room.
Her face was pale and her skin cool and clammy as she reached for Dean’s hand. She opened her eyes,and Dean saw they were filled with tears.
“Yeah I think that you can,” Sam said, venom in every word, “I know that you’ve been hanging out with Dean again and I just wanted to tell you that you better fucking watch yourself. Dean almost didn’t make it through the first heartbreak and I don’t think that he could survive a second one. So, Castiel, I swear to God if you hurt my brother again-”
“Cassie, look at me,” Gabe said, eyes open, leaning forward so that his forearms rested on his knees, “I’m not mad or anything so you don’t need to hide from me, I’m just very confused and I think I deserve some answers here.”
Thank you for all the comments and kudos!!! I hope that this one is enough to hold you over until next week!
Hey. On my way back to the apartment, should be about 15 minutes.
Dean pulled out of Cas’s grasp and turned to face him. He scanned Cas’s face, his jaw clenching as he put together just how drunk and upset Cas was.
His breath hitched as he caught a glimpse of the onyx band. The ring sat in stark contrast to the red velvet covering the inside of the box. Castiel removed the ring and set the box to the side. He ran his fingers over the sparkling blue stripe that ran through the center of the band, he moved it so that the light reflected the flecks of silver within the sapphire. Along the inner surface of the ring at the engraving:
“Thanks for asking, I think I’m doing alright for right now. It might be different in a couple of weeks when the verdict and sentencing come back but, for now? Just getting out of my dorm and creating some semblance of a life for myself is all that I need. So thanks for having me out for coffee. Let’s do it again sometime.” Dean said, a gentle grin spreading across his face, lighting up the room.
“Dean?” Castiel choked out, finally finding his voice, “What are you doing here? I thought you had plans tonight?”
“How about this, as soon as I’m out of the hospital I’ll give you a call and you can take me out for a drink?” Dean winked.
Ok, well after hearing it again, maybe it wasn’t the best declaration of love that he could come up with but this was his first time. The first time he counted the days until he could see someone again, the first time he woke up and fell asleep thinking about someone. The first time that someone’s name rolled off his tongue as effortlessly as Dean’s did.
Dean looked up and met Cas’s gaze, the two sat in silence for a breath.
Dean and Castiel sat in silence for a few minutes. Dean sat with his hands gripped together in his lap, Castiel could tell that he wanted to cross his arms the way he likes to when he’s angry, but he couldn’t because of his stitches. After all this time, Dean was so similar to the man he knew, but there was so much about him that he didn’t know. Those two years spent apart meant more to Dean’s development than Castiel would’ve thought, he had lost that time with Dean, and he didn’t want anymore years to slip by without the company of Dean Winchester. He struggled only for a moment with what he would say next.
“Ha finishing school was hard but totally worth it, I love what I’m doing,” Castiel said, failing to hide a smirk, “I actually graduated near the top of my class.”
“Erm, Hi guys I don’t mean to interrupt but my name is Becky and i’ll be your server this morning! Are we ready to order drinks or do you still need a couple of minutes?”
Dean started the water and let himself acknowledge the thought that had been gnawing at him all night. That no matter how good a date went, or how enjoyable an evening he had with someone, they would never replace Castiel. At least, not until he confronted the residual feelings and emotions that still lingered. Maybe, if he met with Castiel again and they were able to break into a friendship, maybe then Dean would be able to move on.
Cas looked up at Dean from the assignment lists of his classes, his hair tousled in all directions and glasses falling down his nose. He smiled up at Dean but his eyes betrayed his feelings, their usual brilliance slightly faded, dark bags already formed despite the still-early days of the school year. Nonetheless, Cas always had the energy to fake contentment for Dean. His bright smile faltered as he took in the look at Dean’s face.
“I could ask you the same thing, babe.” Dean quipped back. Cas looked down at himself and realized the implication of what he was wearing. He was wearing a green, skin-tight spandex and leather jumpsuit and sleek black boots that covered his ankles, and long black, leather gloves. He was still dressed in his hero costume from earlier, he never changed because it was seldom an issue. Dean was always asleep in bed by the time he got home.
“DEAN! DEAN” Castiel screamed, gripping Dean tightly.
“NO,” Sam nearly yelled, smacking his hands on the bench next to him, “I don’t think that you hear me! I don't know what you want me to say, or what you need to hear from me to get it through your head. What could possibly explain what happened and why you think that it’s a good idea to get involved in my brother’s life again?” Sam stood and turned his back on Castiel.
“Wait,” Sam interrupted, placing a hand over Cas’s to pause his movement, “you still love him, don’t you?”
By this point, both Meg and Jo had run out of the shop and were attending to the woman and the boy. Meg quickly sent Jo back inside to whip up a special batch of hot chocolate while they all waited for an ambulance and the police to arrive.
“You’re trying to tell me that you don’t know what the problem is? Dean Winchester, are you gaslighting me? What the F U C K, Dean?” Castiel stood in Dean’s personal space, backing him against the dresser. Dean gulped, ashamed to be on the receiving end of his boyfriend’s ‘Angel of the Lord’ treatment that was normally reserved for racists, bigots, and people who leave their dogs locked in hot cars.
“Benny?” Castiel asked, finally able to attach a name to the voice.
“Alright cool man, I can get behind someone who feels strongly about wildlife, so what, are you in school to go into environmental stuff or something? What’s the play here?” Dean asked.
“Yes, I knew it!” -Dean pumped his fist in a small gesture in front of him- “My mom was super into angels when I was a kid and I still have the book she gave me on them.”
Without saying a word, Cas stood up, taking Dean’s face between his hands. He wiped the stray tears from Dean’s eyes with his thumbs and stepped between Dean’s knees. Cas pulled Dean in close, cradling his head against his chest and rubbing small circles into his back. He leaned forward to press a light kiss into Dean’s hair and felt the other man’s arms wrap around his waist, holding him in a tight squeeze. They remained like that for several minutes, until Cas finally found his voice.
“Thank you, baby, I’m always going to choose you,” Dean whispered just loud enough for Cas to hear.
“Oh, ok good,” Castiel said with a heavy sigh, “yeah I was wondering where he had gone, I was getting a little worried about him.”
Sam remained silent, he dropped his gaze to his lap where his hands lay neatly folded over one another.
“Well honeybee, are you going to ask me what I’m doing here?” Dean said, breaking the silence between them. He broke eye contact with Cas to look over his shoulder at the zipper on his back.
“I was just asking if everything was okay? If we were almost done?” Dean had a look of obvious concern on his face.
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out.
“Of course I did,” Castiel whispered, leaning down to place a gentle kiss on Dean’s neck, “I just assumed that you had your sights set on something better than me, you’re like the sun” -Cas gently nipped at the skin where Dean’s neck met his collarbone, and relished in the soft moan that escaped Dean’s lips- “and you’re just so beautiful and attractive and nice and smart and hardworking” -each compliment punctuated with another kiss to Dean’s neck and upper chest-  “and it's just a pleasure to be in your presence.” -Cas brought his eyes back up to Dean, catching his eyes to maintain eye contact- “Sometimes I just enjoy existing near you and I hope that someday I’d be the focus of your attention. And now that I am?” Cas said, raising one eyebrow and cocking his head to one side.
Castiel was pulled out of his thoughts when Dean returned from his tests. Castiel quickly glanced over his results and saw that yes, Dean indeed did have a broken femur in his right thigh and he did have a concussion. The broken leg was minor, just a small crack and nothing that a light cast and a pair of crutches couldn’t fix. Dean’s concussion however, was slightly worse. Again, nothing severe, just extra caution was needed the first couple of days into his recovery.
“Cas, honeybee, look at me,” Dean whispered, placing both hands on Cas’s cheeks,  cupping his face, “I am asking you plainly, will you move in with me?”
That sounds good, Dean, I have also heard good things about The Bunker and have been meaning to try it. I will see you at 7 tomorrow night.
He looked to Jo to gauge her reaction and when he saw that she was waiting to speak until he had finished, he continued.
“Ah yeah, Jessica, his longtime girlfriend now, I imagine that he’ll be asking her to formally join the family sooner or later now. She fits in great, kinda tall, take no shit kinda attitude. Guess you have to be tough like that to be a nurse in Boston.”
When Dean's job presents a challenge, how does that affect his home life?
He continued scanning the car and his surroundings, his eyes finally landing on the figure in front of him.
“Wait! Dean, I-” Cas’s eyes wide in panic
Cas’s eyes widened slightly in confusion and he looked at Dean’s hands resting on his shoulders.
How could I let myself get that distracted? Come on Dean, this is just business, just a doctor making sure his patient gets home safe. No more of that chick-flick crap.
Cas sat on the couch and gulped down half the bottle. He immediately felt a little better, a little more stable. His head began to clear of anger, which was promptly replaced by embarrassment for yelling at Dean in public. He felt heat rise in his cheeks as he continued to sip at his water. As Cas pondered his situation, he maintained that Dean was wrong to leave him on his own when he didn’t know anyone there. But, Dean did care enough to admit that Cas was right, and he cared enough to sit him down with a bottle of water. At least Dean wasn’t that angry, right? A small grin spread across Cas’s face as he finished his bottle of water.
Transfixed, Cas found a seat on the couch, his eyes never leaving Dean. He had seen him play shows at some of the local bars, but he had never been graced with a private show, never been serenaded. He took in the lyrics, the words dripping in Dean’s honey maple drawl. He let the words fill him with love and pride.
Dean entered the cafe area with Castiel following closely behind him. The two chose a small two-top and fell into a comfortable silence. Castiel watched Dean as he studied the menu, his eyes followed Dean’s lips as he quietly read the options aloud, something that Dean had done on all of their dates before. Dean bit his lip, deep in thought as though choosing his coffee was the most important decision he was going to be making this morning.
“I ran into Dean this morning.”
“Babe? What’s wrong? Is everything ok?” Dean asked carefully, his eyebrows pinched and his breath shaky.
“And don’t get me wrong, I’m so proud of him and everything that he’s done, and I know that I’m in a better place than I was two years when we broke up and I don’t regret anything that I’ve done in that time, but, I just can’t help but wish that he’d been here. It’s felt like something has been missing in my life and I’ve been working with Pam to try to find a way to fill this hole and I think I’ve found it. I think it's him.”
“Babe, I’m home!” Cas yelled as he limped through the front door.
Dean’s mind was racing, he didn’t want to admit to himself how comforting a presence Castiel was. He knew that, reasonably, he should still be angry and hurt, and distrustful; but yet, being this close to him again was reassuring, like coming home after being lost. The smell of his sandalwood body wash, the way he tapped on the steering wheel along with the beat to the music, and the sound of his rumbling voice as he complained about the other drivers tugged on Dean’s heartstrings. He hadn’t dwelled on these little traits for over two years, because he knew that he was in love with Castiel for these little things that filled out who he was.
“My problem?? Dean, what am I doing here? Why did you bring me here!” Cas shouted, waving his arms around in rhythm with his questions before turning away from Dean.
“What. Happened?” Cas asked, squinting his eyes and tilting his head.
Dean followed her silently into her room, pausing in the doorframe to listen to whatever Meg was yelling in the living room.
“Don’t worry!” Cas said, reaching across the table to place a hand on Dean’s, “I got here early to work on some assignments, you’re not late.”
Dean took a deep breath, “Jo, he was getting off his shift and offered to drive me home. I told him that he didn’t have to, that I’d call an uber and I would be fine. He countered by telling me that he was worried, from a medical perspective” - he held a hand up to Jo to stop her from interrupting- “that my concussion was too severe to leave me alone for a couple of days and that I shouldn’t be trying to go upstairs on my own for a little bit.”
The figure in Dean’s mind released his cock with a soft ‘pop’. They knelt back to watch Dean unravel, taking in the sight of Dean unraveling before them, savoring the moment. Dean’s eyes traced over this figure, fully taking in the beauty of their appearance, their lean muscles pulled taut over broad shoulders and firm abdomen. Their rough, calloused hands grazed over the sensitive skin of Dean’s inner thighs and he arched into their touch.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel rumbled out with his signature gravelly voice once Dean and Garth had crossed the lot from the ambulance into the hospital breezeway.
“Well, other than the trip to my emergency room, he seems to be doing fine, Gabe.” There was a pregnant pause in the air before Castiel continued, “He’s still living in the same apartment, Gabe, it's almost exactly the same as how I left it 2 years ago.” Castiel took in a deep gulp of air, his voice beginning to shake.
“Nah man, it's all good,” -Dean brought his head back up, the same full smile spread across his face- “So, if we’re supposed to be getting to know each other and studying together, I was hoping I could ask you a small favor?”
“Excuse me, WHAT?” Castiel asked, his eyebrows jumping into his hairline, his mouth falling open in surprise.
“Dean? Sweetheart, what’s wrong? Did something happen at work?” Cas asked, his eyebrows scrunched. He scrambled up from his nest on the floor and crossed the room, arms out to embrace Dean.
Castiel stopped what he was doing; he sat back up and looked at Dean, face scrunched in confusion.
“Here,” Dean said, directing Cas to the couch behind them, “sit here and drink this. I’ll be right back.”
“Damn man, I’m just saying, this ain’t the best location for a hospital and most of what we see are just goddamn junkies who threw their life away.” Gordon said, backing away from Castiel and holding his hands up in defense.
“Jerk,” Sam called from behind the pages of his book.
It was 3:06 pm on a Thursday. Castiel sat sweltering in a poorly circulated auditorium as his professor powered on the projector for their first lecture. The door at the back of the auditorium slammed open, letting a pool of light spill across the dimmed room. The entirety of a 300-person lecture hall silenced their conversations and turned to face the source of the commotion. Castiel turned in his seat and saw, standing at the top of the stairs illuminated by the natural daylight of Kansas in the summer, a blonde-haired adonis. The man of near Greek God appearance kept his eyes glued to the floor in front of his feet as he ran down the steps, letting the door close noisily behind him. He only brought his head up to look for an open seat, and his eyes settled on the nearest spot next to Castiel.
“I met Dean this morning at Trident and we got coffee and caught up. It was his idea, he texted me last night and I agreed so I went and I saw him and we talked and caught up.” Castiel said quickly, shrinking with each word until he was hiding behind his giant mug as best he could.
The two sat in silence once again, Dean looked up at the ceiling to avoid Jo’s eyes and inhaled deeply to settle his breathing.  He knew that Jo would spread the news that Castiel had been here and the thought of defending this act of kindness to his family was overwhelming. Especially since he was not playing with a full deck of cards at the moment due to his concussion. When he dropped his eyes and looked back at Jo, she had a soft expression on her face, as though she was totally relaxed.
“Ehm, Hello?” the voice asked again, “Castiel? You there?”
“What? You were testifying in an assault case? Can you ever talk about it?” Cas asked, his eyebrows raised high in disbelief of what Dean had said.
The man finally seems to recognize that Dean is on the sidewalk with them and looks up to make eye contact with Dean. Once Dean gets a closer look at his eyes, his first idea about this man being a junkie is confirmed. Every move Dean makes should be carefully considered as this man is not in his right mind and will not be predictable.
“Dean, yes, look at me,” Cas said sternly in his closest approximation of an Angel of The Lord voice. “You deserve so much more than what I was contributing. I should be expected to do basic adult things around the apartment. It was the absolute least I could do to put the damn laundry away.” - Cas gestures behind him - “You deserve help and I know that one big gesture from me is not enough. It’s not enough to make up for the neglect you’ve faced but I want to work on this. I want to be better for you and because of you.” Cas sank back into the couch, shrinking into himself.
“Dean,” Cas’s voice was thick with emotion, he cleared his throat before continuing, “I can’t imagine what you must be feeling. I want to help,” -Cas pulled away from Dean, placing his hands on Dean’s shoulders- “I appreciate your concern for Jack, but I think this is above your pay grade.”
He absently moved around the apartment, cleaning and straightening up. There were cups in the living room to be picked up and crumbs on the floor to be vacuumed. He completed these chores on autopilot, his mind still replaying the events of earlier that day.
Dean gulped. “Ah, yeah. Lost. What a concept, I feel so good with where I am, I love my job, I love where I live, I love my friends’ - he reached up and gave her hand a soft squeeze - “and god, Charlie, I love Cas so much.” Dean leaned away from Charlie, shaking his head.
“Haha yeah you’re right I guess, I didn’t know that you were still drinking those,” Dean said, chuckling softly and finally picking his eyes up to meet Castiel’s gaze.
“Uh, well, Dean, I think that I should be on my way. I’m sure you’re exhausted and I have some case reports that I need to get started on.” Castiel said in a tiny voice that betrayed the casual look he was attempting to display.
“Dude, what the hell? How can you say that to me? To not bother you with this? I thought the whole point of this” -Dean gestures between himself and Cas- “was to help each other through shit?”
“Got it!” Dean yelled before running back over to Cas.
“Dean-” Cas said, gripping Dean’s hips a little tighter. “I have to ask you something, why did you change your suit color? It used to be dark grey and red…”
“What else did you do? Babe, just coming home to this whole setting and having you admit that you know what upset me was enough for me.”
Dean shifted in his seat, desperately trying to find a way to get comfortable in his living room while Castiel walked around. His fingers found their way to the buttons on his flannel and he began to worry one between his fingers. Dean sat there on the couch with flashes of panic running through his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
The two of them sat in silence, tears gently streamed down their faces. Dean moved to wrap one arm around Cas’s shoulders and Cas pulled his knees up. He curled into Dean, moving to fill his lap.
The deep rumble of Cas’s voice soothed Dean’s nerves, he rolled his shoulders down from around his ears and unclenched his fists, wiggling his fingers loose. Without thinking about it, Dean stepped into the living room and looked around the room. Cas’s classes had started back earlier that week and he already looked weighed down. Books and notes spread across the floor as he organized himself for the semester.
“Come on man, I drink other things, I got range,” Dean said, a smile plastered across his face as he leaned back in his seat.
Castiel’s stomach dropped, his mind immediately flew to the obvious. He had left Dean alone for so many nights in their marriage that he shouldn’t be surprised at all by Dean’s cheating. Really it was only a matter of time.
Cas is unable to stop the tears from welling in his eyes and isn’t quick enough to wipe them from his face when Dean breaks the kiss for air. He didn’t pull back very far, just enough to catch a breath, the two of them still close enough that they’re sharing the same air. Dean opens his eyes to see the tears in Cas’s eyes and the few that began running down his face. He reaches his hands up to cup Cas’s face and brush the tears with his thumbs, his face bearing a look of concern.
“Ok,” Gabriel said, breaking the silence. He raised his mug to take a drink and when he brought it back down, a whipped cream mustache was left behind. “Spill the tea, Castiel, why did you call me like you did?”
He and Dean had fought before, they had been together for nearly 7 years, of course there had been fights. And not all of them ended amicably, sometimes one of them stormed out, needing to cool down for a few hours before returning to the conversation.
“On ThanKsGivinG!” Charlie shrieked, reaching across the couch to smack Dean’s arm. “You better have a good reason for not telling me this sooner! I hope to the GODDESS ABOVE that Sam knew immediately!”
“Well, Pamela did actually. We were talking about my childhood and everything that I went through with my parents and she suggested that I explore that more and that the structure of an academic setting might help me separate myself from the content. So I found a psych program up here with a concentration in childhood trauma.” Dean said in a matter of fact tone.
He knew that he didn’t just want a friendship with Dean, this was only their second time seeing each other but he knew what the pit in the bottom of his stomach was telling him. He didn’t believe, or didn’t let himself believe it last week, but Castiel admitted to himself now that he was falling in love with Dean Winchester. How could he, someone who prided himself on his logic and reasoning skills, someone who had been skeptical of love and relationships, find himself falling for someone he had barely talked to? Despite his best efforts to explain his feelings away, he knew that there was something about Dean that pulled him in and wouldn’t let go. On principle, he didn’t believe in the concept of love at first sight. He chalked it up to a load of crap that Hollywood made up to sell movie tickets, and yet? Here he was, imagining a world in which someone like Dean Winchester could end up with him.
If Sam had seen through this lie, he didn’t let on. He nodded silently and turned back towards the television. He looked over at Dean once more before turning the volume back up.
Dean nodded his head at Cas once and stood to leave the shop. Cas remained in his seat for another few minutes, piecing together the events of that afternoon.
“Hey Dean! How’s it hangin?” Charlie answered on the second ring.
“Uh, yeah, well, “ - Gabe cleared his throat and Castiel turned around to face him - “I do have one question for you.”
“I dunno man, like” - Sam lifted his hands in a defeated motion, dropping them onto the couch cushions next to him- “When we met I was just some dumb college kid that broke his arm on a stupid dare, I know she just thought of me as some frat guy that would do anything to get a laugh out of his friends. She told me that after we started going out. There’s no way I’m the kind of person that she saw herself with. Why wouldn’t she say no?”
Cas was stunned. He remained silent as his brain frantically tried to fit the pieces of what was happening together. While the adrenaline of this fight was sobering him up, his thoughts were still too slow and sluggish for the moment. Dean wanted to ask him on a date and Cas led him to believe that he didn’t want to be here. Cas needed to respond, needed to say anything.
“Have you been waiting long? I know I was a little late-” Dean said, removing his phone from his pocket to check the time.
The two of them began up the staircase, slowly and cautiously. Castiel let Dean set the pace as they climbed. They were only a couple of steps up when Dean’s head began to throb. His breathing roughened and he groped for the handrail to his side. He felt Castiel stiffen next to him, obviously able to sense the difference in Dean’s behavior. He kept his eyes down, concentrating on the pale green carpet that lined the stairs. As they continued up the stairs, Dean could feel each heartbeat pump through his head. His vision blurred and he paused, he looked up and exhaled sharply in disappointment. They were barely halfway up the staircase.
The dim light of early morning peaked out around the edges of Dean’s curtains. With sleep still crusting his eyes, he stretched and removed the now-cool pad from his hips. As he worked his joints awake, rolling his ankles and flexing his fingers and wrists, he recognized the ease of relaxation. He relished in the wonders that a good night’s sleep can do for the body and the mind, he was looser and more in control of his body and actions than he was the previous night, all except for one thing.
“Wow, Dean, this looks exactly the same, you didn’t change much did you? - Castiel asked looking around the room - “I’m not sure what I expected the place to look like but I’m really glad to be back in here.”
“Hey babe, help me a little here.” - Dean tilted his head down towards the bottom of Cas’s shirt. Cas pushed himself up so that he was sitting with Dean straddled over his lap. He grabbed the hem of his shirt and pushed it up over his head, barely breaking eye contact with Dean.
Dean and Cas are moving into their Boston apartment following graduation from KU. Sweet and fluffy with a healthy dose of smut to get you through your day :P
Dean began to unpack boxes while Cas kept bringing things up from the car. Dean was much more particular about organization than Cas was, perhaps bordering on obsessive-compulsive about where things should be located and kept, but Cas kept that thought to himself. Dean also made a better pot of coffee than Cas did, and if Dean stayed to unpack he would make a cup for him and Cas to share in their new digs.
“Gabriel,” Castiel said in a small voice, nearly a whisper, “did I make the right decision leaving him? I can’t help but ask myself this all the time and it’s driving me crazy.” -Castiel dropped his eyes from the ceiling to meet his brother’s eyes-
As he basked in the gentle morning sunlight, his thoughts began to clear, shaking the sleep and lust off. His eyes flew open in shock, the post-nut clarity filled his mind as he realized what exactly happened. Dean sat up in bed and looked down at his chest and stomach, covered in his own semen, he whispered to himself, “I just jerked off to Cas”.
“Oh, I’m sorry that I made you rush, but I am glad that you’re here now,” Castiel said, tapping a pencil on the coffee table sitting in front of him. Gabriel stood for a moment with his eyebrows raised and a questioning look on his face. Without saying a word he breezed out of the living room, accepting that Castiel would spill the tea in his own time.
“Yeah, I know, I’m actually here to talk to you about something,” Sam replied shortly. He held eye contact for a few moments, letting the tension between the two of them build.
“Yeah” - Dean sniffed hard - “I’m good”.
Dean took in the rest of the room. Soft yellow string lights lined the base of walls and ran around the entire room, softening the area. Large, white candles were burning on the coffee table, emitting the pleasant aroma of vanilla that greeted Dean at the door. Red roses crowded a vase on the end table and there were loose petals spread across the floor. Dean’s eyes searched for the source of the music and Cas’s small, black record player next to an ice bucket holding a bottle of white wine. Two stemless wine glasses sat on the table near the wine, Dean walked over and picked one up. They were both engraved, one with “Winchester” and the other with “Novak”. He turned the glass over in his hands, taking in the meaning of the two next to each other. Cas obviously didn’t just find these, he had to get them from somewhere, specifically for them.
“Dean was not well, he hadn’t been for a while, probably since we first met or even before then, but I didn’t truly appreciate the pain that he was in until the end. Or if I’m being honest, when we first moved up here. Dean feels every emotion much more acutely than anyone else I’ve ever met, he sees himself in the worst possible light, and he is his own worst enemy and critic. Well, I guess I should say that he was, I don’t really know him anymore.” Castiel said, stopping to give Sam a woeful glance.
“Above my pay grade? What the hell does that mean, Cas?” Dean asked, the question soaked in a quiet rage.
“Well Sammy” - Dean looked back up at the camera, biting his thumbnail before speaking again -” I was getting there. It turns out that Castiel is still in Boston and is working at Boston Medical Center, along with the lovely Jessica Moore here.” Dean took a deep breath, matching Sam’s stare until the taller man looked away.
Dean and Cas's first date, there's miscommunication and misunderstandings followed by making up ;)
“Dean? Can you hear me?” Cas asked, his voice a whisper in a suddenly silent bedroom. Dean looked around and saw that he was sitting upright in bed and was not trapped in a burning car with his mother, or in any room with his father.
He tried to remind himself that it was nothing personal, that Dean wasn’t avoiding him for the hell of it. He knew that Dean was busy with job applications and that he was going to be moving away from his family soon, and that his family wanted him to see them before that happened. He understood how close Dean was to his family, especially Sammy. But Dean was going to be moving away to god knows where while Cas moved to Boston and he didn’t know what that meant for them. As selfish as it might be, Cas also felt protective of this time left with Dean before they both moved away.
“Of course, Dean, and honestly? I had nothing else planned for today so I’m not missing anything to be here. Besides” -Castiel reached out and placed a hand over Dean’s - “I meant what I said about reconnecting and”-Castiel was interrupted by the sound of keys clinking in the hall and a lock being turned in the front door. He looked down at his hand resting on Dean’s and pulled it back to his chest as though he had burned it.
“Dean, what?” Cas asked, his eyes opened wide in confusion.
“Well, I have to miss class on Tuesday, I know right, like already?” Dean said, nodding his head along with the cadence of his gentle midwestern accent, “I have some family business that I have to take care of and I could not get out of it on Tuesday. Is there any way that I could convince you to take notes for me?”
“Well, haha, it’s not going to sound as impressive as yours,” Dean said in a small voice, looking down at his lap, “I want to be a history teacher, probably high school students.”
“Yeah, yeah, whatever about the speech, we both decided that today was the day. I knew today was going to be the last time we fought but I didn’t expect you to be so easy to take down, old man.” Dean laughed off, taking the beer from Cas.
“What is there to ask, Dean? I tried and you shut me down, I don't know what to tell you,” Cas said, not bothering to lift his head.
“You hungry?” Sam asked, pulling his phone out of his back pocket, “I’m gonna order lunch.”
Unfortunately, what is usually a therapeutic exercise was anything but this evening. Everytime Dean tried to insert a date into his timeline, the cells resized themselves and the formatting defaulted to something different with each addition. More than once, Dean went to edit a cell and forgot to select the proper edit tool and ended up deleting everything already written.
Dean looked over at Sam on the screen, then to Jo sitting at his side. He wanted to be upset that his family was tripping over themselves to protect him, that they had kept such a big secret from him, but he knew that their intentions were in the right place. He knew that his family would break down the doors to hell for him and he needed to trust them. Even Dean could not deny that he hadn’t been in the proper headspace to know what Castiel was doing or where he was until this point.
“Dean? Baby, are you okay?” Mary responded, her voice flat. She stretched her arm back towards Dean and her fingers didn't quite make it to him.
“Well, do you at least know what you’re looking for in a date?” Sam asked, genuine interest filling his words, “do you know why you’re not having a great time? I at least thought your date with Benny would go better than it did.”
Cas stood just out of Dean’s reach, his arms crossed in front of his chest, his mouth held in a tight line. Dean clenched his jaw and his radiant green eyes grew dark. The tension built in the room around them, the air between them grew thick, nearly suffocating with unvoiced words and emotion.
“But it was not on you to save him. By the sound of it, Dean’s doing great. I know you blame yourself, but maybe he needed to figure out who he was on his own. And you definitely needed to figure out who you were on your own. “
“Ohhh hell, y’all already know each other??” Garth asked, wide eyed and excited. “Well isn’t that just dandy?”
“Mmhmm” Dean answered, nodding his head enthusiastically, “I’ll be honest, I only ever applied in Boston.”
“For the longest time, I didn’t think I deserved someone who would take care of me,” Dean continued, “I believed that my lot in life was to parent Sam and that my happiness didn’t matter, and frankly? Some days I’m still not convinced that it does. But Cas made me want to believe that, he makes me happier than I ever envisioned myself being. I want to be better for him, I want to want to be valued.” - Dean gestured with his hands, placing them on his chest, breathless-  “For the first several years we were together, I pushed myself to see myself in a fraction of the light that Cas did. It was my main motivation to work through my shit and my past issues, but now? I don’t feel like a partner” - Dean dropped his hands into his lap, his eyes following them down- “ I feel like a parent again, like someone to mechanically cook, clean, and keep a roof over Cas’s head without his help.”
Dean held the eye contact, falling into the reassurance of Cas’s words and his physical touch. He took a deep breath to steady himself, and the rest of the story fell out of Dean in a torrent.
“I’m not sure,” Castiel replied, exhaling deeply as he took his nephew and bounced him on his knee,  “I didn’t expect to see him today, not that I never expected to see him. I knew deep down that it was only a matter of time before we crossed paths again, but… ahhh” - Castiel sighed hard - “there was something about seeing him that just took the breath out of me.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said as he entered the room.
Dean took Cas’s hands and wrapped them around the back of his neck then reached down to Cas’s ass to pick him up off the floor. Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist and kissed him deeply again. Dean started carrying Cas back towards their bedroom.
Their small car was upright after a large pickup made contact with the driver’s side door with almost enough force to send them rolling. They were slammed out of the intersection and into a roadside telephone pole. Both sides of the car were crumpled from the impact leaving mother and son trapped inside their car.
“I know, surprising right?” Dean said for him. That’s exactly what it was, surprising.
“Gabe? You look like you have something to say.” Castiel said over his shoulder, “You can say it, I know I looked rough when you first got here but this little guy” - he lifted Tucker  up over his head and gave him a little toss,  enough for the boy to leave his grasp but never leave his hands - “works wonders on heartache.”
“Cas, look,” -Dean placed both his hands on Cas’s shoulders-”I get that you’re upset, and you’re right, I shouldn’t have left you alone like I did, but you cannot talk to me like that in front of my friends.”
“I surprised him with my job offer in Boston, he got into medical school up here and I started applying for jobs without telling him. I had a couple of phone interviews and the one at Cathedral stuck.” Dean said, taking Charlie back to the beginning of his and Cas’s life in Boston. “I pitched him this idea of us moving in together, here, I told him that I had a good-paying job to support us for a while and his savings should be enough for the initial deposits and whatnot. I told him this fully expecting to financially support the both of us for 4 years until Cas was out of med school. What I did not expect was to become a push-over roommate or friend with benefits that he could fuck every once in a while when he felt like it.”
The figure leaned down, kissing and sucking at Dean’s neck, their stubble rubbing and tickling at his throat. As they nuzzled deeper into his neck, a familiar, oaky smell filled the air. Dean’s hands found their way into their short hair, his fingers gripping at the lush, black locks. The figure’s hand snaked back down Dean’s body, catching both of their cocks and pumping them together.
“Ok Castiel, I hear you. I would like to get to know you again too. Just friends.”
Castiel collapsed face-first on his bed and drew a blanket over himself. He took several long and deep breaths, holding his breath after every inhale, then forcing his exhale through pursed lips. He pulled himself back from the edge, away from a total breakdown. As he laid in bed focusing on his breathing, he knew that he would have to deal with these emotions and process them eventually, but that time did not have to be right now.
“Dean” Cas breathed out, he worried his lip between his teeth before continuing, “I would like to go visit your mother’s grave for Mother’s day in a couple of weeks.”
“Nah, I think she had a great time, she could not get enough of whatever I was laying down. But that’s the thing,” -Dean shifted in his seat, turning to face Sam more straight on- “I didn’t want to be there, I just flat was not having a good time. Something about being out with her just felt off. But enough about me!”- Dean smacked Sam  once on the arm- “how the hell are you tonight?! Is there any reason you’re still camped out here on my  couch instead of back at your place with Jess?”
“DEAN WINCHESTER YOU NO-GOOD COMMUNICATING SON OF A-” - the front door slammed and the full-bodied voice of Joanna Beth filled the small apartment as she busted through the entry hall into the living room - ”BITCH!”
“I met with him this morning because all that I want is to know how he is doing, to know what he’s been up to the past two years and to be in any way shape or form involved in his life moving forward. Gabriel” - Castiel grabbed one of Gabe’s hands- “He’s doing so well right now, he’s back in school, he’s in therapy and is so open about what happened to him, and Gabriel, I am so proud of him and the growth he’s done and I am so heartbroken that I wasn’t there to see it. Gabe” - His voice broke and he dropped his gaze to the floor between them and closed his eyes tightly shut- “I should have been there to help him.”
Cas’s fingers worked their way to the waistband of Dean’s pants. He fumbled with the buckle, desperate to remove this barrier between them, to get them out of these clothes. He pulled away from Dean’s mouth and moved to his neck. Cas kissed and sucked at the soft skin on Dean’s neck and around his collarbones, pulling moans from Dean. Every breathless moan and croak of his name from Dean’s mouth went straight to Cas’s dick.
Hell Yeah! Tomorrow works perfectly actually
The two men stood there, frozen.
Dean glared at Sam, angry that instead of continuing to talk about this momentous occasion in Sam’s life, that he wanted to keep discussing the fact that Dean wasn’t dating. That Sam wanted to dredge up old emotions and air them out again, that he couldn’t accept that Dean was content with his own life and that he wasn’t  looking for more.
“Uhhhh, well, I live alone but I -” Dean started but was quickly cut off.
“Can you not move so much? I’m going to need to place a couple of stitches here.” Castiel said, looking up at Dean’s face.
As Dean sipped the water, he thought about what Cas was doing for him. It was obvious that he was stressed, already overwhelmed and weighed down by the semester, and here he was ready to take care of Dean. Cas deserved better than this. Dean should be able to handle his own problems, he should be able to shelf everything and take care of Cas. Guilt settled over Dean, nearly suffocating him, the tender caress of Cas’s hand on his thigh serving as his only lifeline.
He barely had a chance to get clean underwear on before a little chirp came from his phone.
“Cas, fuck,” Dean whispered in Cas’s ear, “I love you so much, you know that right?”
“That’s it? No further discussion? No actual conversation?” Cas asked, his eyebrows practically in his hairline, his voice wavering.
A breath caught in Cas’s throat as he watched Dean sing, his chest grew tight and his heart ached. He loved this man sitting across from him and would give anything for more time with him. His stomach dropped as his mind raced through the various things Dean came to tell him. Maybe he was moving away, and he knew that Cas couldn’t follow. Maybe he knew their time was coming to an end, that when Cas moved to Boston for medical school Dean wasn’t going to join him. They had never talked about Dean moving with Cas, but he had hoped, hell even assumed, that Dean would go with him.
more notes at the end
Jo stopped in her tracks when she caught the sight of Castiel Novack sitting in an armchair just feet away from an injured Dean. Her oversized purse slipping off her shoulder, catching at her elbow. Her mouth dropped open in quiet disbelief as her gaze switched back and forth between Dean and Castiel. She scrunched her forehead and pinched her eyebrows together as Dean could see the wheels turning in her head, trying to piece together the scene that was there in front of her.
🤗 Thank you Dean
He climbed the steps and rang the buzzer to her unit. The harsh BUZZ was answered with a window opening three stories above him, Dean looked straight up at the messy knot of red hair peeking out the window.
“You ok, bud?” Jo asked quietly, tilting her head to the side.
“Thanks, man,” Dean whispered.
By the time Dean got his door open and both feet out of the car, Castiel was standing there in front of him, holding his crutches. He offered Dean a hand out of the car and Dean tentatively reached out his hand to accept this gesture. As Castiel returned to the driver’s side to lock up, Dean steadily made his way over to the front of his building and climbed up the four steps that led up to the front door. He reached in his pocket for his keys and was overcome with a wave of vertigo. The blood rushed to his head and his vision blurred for a second; and he felt himself tipping backward off the top step when suddenly, Castiel caught him.
He drafted his response to Dean while standing in the exact middle of the hallway. Other doctors and nurses and interns bumped into him and gave him the stink eye, but he couldn’t care less. If he wasn’t drop dead exhausted, he would tell Dean that he was free in a little less than an hour and a half and could see him then. He also didn’t want to seem too desperate or anything like that. Castiel had an administrative shift scheduled for the next morning, just a time for him to come in for a couple of meetings and interviews for a future residency position with the hospital, so he could be free to meet Dean tomorrow night. He could either have something to celebrate or something that he needed to drink to forget.
Dean gulped and nodded with Mary, tears spilling over as they sat in the car. She slipped her hand into Dean’s small hand, clutching his fingers tightly. This contact grounded Dean, pulled him out of his head and his fears. He could hear sirens off in the distance, maybe they would be ok. Someone was coming to save them, to save Mary. They -were- going to be ok. They had to be, Mary had to be ok.
(See the end of the chapter for
His first call immediately went to voicemail, a sign that Dean had activated his ‘Do Not Disturb’ function. Cas dialed the number a second time and waited for his partner to pick up on the other end. This second call went unanswered and Cas’s heart skipped a beat. He dialed the number for a third time, his palms sweaty and cold. He could barely hear the phone’s ringing over the blood rushing in his ears.
Another quick response from Cas:
“I’m never letting you go,” Cas whispered in Dean’s ear then reached down to Dean’s thighs and picked him up. Dean quickly grasped at Cas’s coat in surprise. Cas swiftly turned them around and gently set Dean down on the countertop.
“Ok,” Dean said, this one syllable response of his made everyone raise their eyebrows in surprise. “I hear you, I don’t like that y’all kept a secret and essentially lied to me, but I see why you did it. I don’t like being babied but I can recognize that I probably needed it up until now. But don’t you dare think you can pull this shit with me again. Trust me enough to know what I can and can’t handle, got it?” Dean lowered his eyebrows and glared at all three until he got confirmation from all of them that they capiced.
“I was asking you if you wanted to go to my friend’s Halloween party tonight? Remember? We talked about it yesterday but I needed an answer today just so I can let them know how many people and how much alcohol to get and I know Halloween isn’t for another couple of days but we can’t really drink and whatnot on a Sunday night before class, well, I mean we could but we really shouldn’t.” Dean said, his words coming out quickly, as though they had been held back for too long. “I know I’m rambling. I was just hoping to get an answer from you real quick.”
“Hey Dean, Castiel and I do work together. I’ve known who he is ever since Sam met me at the hospital one day and saw Castiel at the nurses’ station. Sam explained who he was to me and both he and I decided not to tell you that I worked with him. Now Dean, listen to me, “ Jess stated in an authoritative tone, she could see Dean’s eyes widen and his mouth open in protest, “Sam and I had good reason to do it. Dean, I didn’t know you and Castiel together, and I didn’t know you right after the breakup. But I’ve known you for almost two years now and I’ve seen how hard you have been working to get back on your feet.” - Jess sniffled and blinked hard to fight back tears that were forming in her eyes - “Dean, I found out who Castiel was early on in my relationship with Sam, I didn’t want you to associate me with him, to think that I was as close to him as I was to you, or that I talked about you to him because I don’t. Dean, I just wanted our relationship to work and be fun and easygoing and it   wouldn’t have been if you knew that I knew Castiel.” Jess looked away from the camera and wiped at her cheeks. She took several moments to breathe and calm down before returning to Dean.
Dean sat across from Castiel for several moments, then opened his mouth.
“You drove him home?” he asked, shaking his head at the absurdity of the idea.
“I think we’re beyond saving here.” Dean’s eyes turned downward, avoiding Cas’s.
Thank you so much for reading! Welcome to all the new people that just found this fic, and thank you to everyone reading and keeping up with my updates for taking a risk on a new author writing a multi-chapter fic. I love your comments and hearing that you're liking the story, I hope that I can keep up with your expectations!
“I can multitask,” he said to himself, dropping both arms to his side. He stared at the pile for a moment longer, “yeah, I was always great at multitasking.” Castiel grabbed the stack and breezed out of his office.
“Babe,” Cas swallowed hard, “you had a bad nightmare, but I got you now, you’re ok.” He loosened his grip on Dean, resting his hands softly on Dean’s shoulders.
Dean knew that Sam wanted to press him more about his night, about the “not a date” date that he went on. As he crutched into the bathroom and began wrapping the plastic bag around his cast, he thought more about his dinner with Lisa. Again, it wasn’t that she wasn’t nice or funny or easy to be around, and it wasn’t that she wasn’t into him and that she had a bad time. In fact, she tried to get him to commit to another night out as they made their way back to the train station.
His heart stopped and his eyes nearly fell out of his head with how quickly they bugged out. He choked on this saliva as he watched the blue sending bar load at the top of the screen. Acting on some instinct he didn’t know he had, he quickly slid the control screen on his phone down and turned on ‘airplane mode’. A prompt popped up on the screen asking him if he wanted to send the message as a text message rather than an iMessage was Dean’s saving grace. He quickly selected NO and was able to delete the text before it was sent.
His alarm went off, the preset tone on his phone blaring from across the room. Castiel lept out of bed, crossing the room to retrieve his alarm in swift strides. He silenced his phone and took a deep breath, closing his eyes as he exhaled. He was meeting Dean for coffee in 2 hours and 29 minutes and nothing could settle the butterflies in his stomach. Even though he knew that he was just meeting with Dean to catch up and that this was not a date, it felt like he was walking on air.
“I was testifying in court yesterday, in an assault case,” Dean said, still holding Cas’s hands.
Dean looked deep into Cas’s eyes, letting the words sink into him. A small flicker of anxiety and panic sparked in his chest, threatening to ignite into an inferno. He swallowed hard and squeezed Cas’s hand back, waiting to see if the man had more to this pitch.
“Yes, of course,” Dean sputtered out with no hesitation. “I love him with everything I have, I can’t imagine not having him.”
“OooOh, how close were you?”
“Uh, yes, yes, I’m still here,” Cas shook his head, gripping the phone tightly in his hand, “thank you for updating me on what’s going on, I appreciate it.”
“Bitch,” Dean yelled over his shoulder as he crutched into the kitchen.
“Sounds like another couple of junkies went at it again, huh?” Gordon asked Castiel playfully.
“Ok, “ Cas sighed, continuing to pick at his skin, “I’ll tell you what happened that night. You should have all the information about the man your brother was so you can appreciate the person he is today.”
“Can do, I’ll be right back with those,” Becky said as she left, not that Dean nor Castiel heard her.
“Well shit I don’t know why I thought you’d give a shit about my life, it’s not like I’m your partner or anything, but excuse me, I’d hate to get in the way of your precious Krebs Cycle. I’ll just go back in the kitchen, I’m just your dumb Hick homemaker,” Dean spat at Cas.
Sam sighed and dog-eared a page in his book before sitting up and turning his attention back to Dean. When Sam looked up at his brother, Dean was able to see the stress and anxiety in his eyes. Sam took a deep breath and flipped his hair out of his face.
Dean’s eyes flew open in a panic, his screaming abruptly ending as his mind failed to catch up. He was looking Cas in the eyes and could see complete and total terror in the other man’s expression. Cas held Dean in both hands, his left hand was wrapped around his right wrist and his right was gripping Dean’s left shoulder with enough force to leave a mark behind.
Castiel’s wall broke and tears spilled over, unable to stop them as they ran in streaks down his face. Dean crossed the room in swift steps, pulling Cas into his arms. The two of them stood like that for a while, until Cas was able to stop crying. He pulled himself gently from Dean’s embrace and wiped his face dry.
“I grabbed the first blanket I could find, sorry if Spock is more your speed,” Charlie said with a soft chuckle and a tilt of her head.
“Dean! Can you stop fidgeting?!” Cas yelled playfully, able to spare a quick glance over at Dean in the passenger seat. “We’re almost there but damn these roads are narrow and the drivers are horrible! I need to pay attention before some assbutt cuts in front of me.”
“Will you let me help you?” Castiel turned his gaze to Dean’s face. When Dean met his eyes, he could see the pleading that was there.
I am so sorry for the delay in updating, the end of the semester came at me hard but I'm hoping to get this chapter and another posted shortly :D
He wasn’t sure if this was something that he wanted to share with others. Only Gabriel knew the whole story and that was only because it was Gabriel who put Cas back together again. On one hand, it was a personal and private story that made him into the man that he is today, and Sam Winchester has no right to that part of him. On the other hand, learning all of the details might offer him insight into the man his brother is today. He picked at the skin around his fingernails as he turned over his options.
Catching up with the day to day of young Dr. Novak. Another surprise reunion might shed some light on someone's past, present, and future?
Thank you for reading! Thank you for all the kudos and comments, I love hearing what yall think!
“I told you that I would love you until the end of my days, unconditionally. I know that I haven’t been good about keeping my promises to you, especially when I say that I won’t have late nights, or that I would be home on time. But I will be damned if you think that I did not mean what I said 5 years ago when I married you. Dean, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me, Dean you changed me, for the better. I learned how to love from you, you are the most loving person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing and I am not just letting you walk out that door. You know that I can throw some force around if I need to, so if you want to leave, you’re not getting out without a fight from me.” Cas clenched his fists to try to fight back the tears that were threatening to pour out of his eyes.
“Charlie,” - Dean turned to face her and took both of her hands in his - “I love him so much, I would move heaven and earth for him. I’d take on the wrath of hell and whatever lies in the depths of the night as long as I had him by my side. But lately? It feels like he’s taking me for granted, like he’s slipping away from me.
She reached over and pulled him close to her, wrapping both arms around him and holding him there. He relaxed into her touch and slipped his hands around her and held on tightly. Charlie pulled out of the hug and got up to dim the lights in her room and to set a timer on her phone.
Something as easy as outlining a paper should have taken Dean 30 minutes to an hour at the most, however, the events of that night had caught up to him and he couldn’t bring himself to focus on the words on the screen. Typos galore sat in front of him, painfully highlighted by the red squiggles.
Dean stood in disbelief. Cas almost never gave up this easily when he acted like this, he usually lost out and Dean ended up sharing some emotion he would rather keep stuffed down. He watched Cas adjust the glasses on his face and highlight a definition in his notes.
“Um, I do not and that is why I asked” Cas snaps back.
-SMACK-
“Could you tell me?” Sam asked, breaking the silence.
Dean eased himself out of her arms and adjusted so that he could sit up next to her in the bed.
“Well,” -Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath before continuing- “I can talk about it since I was the victim in the case.” -another deep breath- “And I cannot believe it feels this easy to say this, but remember how I said that my dad was not a good role model? Well…”
Jack tells me, nearly on the verge of tears -I do not know how this kid got all of this out- that he’s losing sleep and losing weight. He’s barely able to stay awake in his classes because his dad is keeping him up all hours of the night doing chores. And, Cas, he won’t let Jack eat until he’s completed whatever bullshit tasks his dad’s given him.”
“Oh will you, Boy?” Castiel replied, standing quickly and crowding Sam’s space. He lifted his left eyebrow and his lip curled into a smirk, “just what exactly do you think you could do to me? Does Jess know that you’re here? Threatening her coworkers? Does Dean?”
“DUDE!” Dean yelled back, lunging across the couch to envelop his baby brother in a bear hug, “That’s incredible!” As he pulled out of the hug, he reached back and smacked Sammy once upside the head.
“I’m gonna get a shower and get ready for bed, ok? The trash bags still under the sink?” Dean said, clapping Sam on the shoulder as he eased himself up off the couch.
Seeing Castiel was unexpected, but not unwelcome, Dean thought. After two years of suppressing any and all thoughts about him, to have Castiel back in any way was incredible. As his thoughts drifted through potential futures that featured Castiel, Dean fell asleep in his memory foam mattress with a smile on his face.
“Sam, I was in medical school at the time, I was getting my ass kicked every single day and I had nothing left to give at the end. I was so stressed, and sleep deprived, I was constantly sick, and I was losing weight. I loved Dean more than anything else in the world, and if I had been able to help him, if he would have let me in, I would have stayed. I would have sacrificed everything that I had to piece him back together. I would have gone through hell and back for your brother.
“Hey, man, let’s settle down here,” Dean says in a low, calm voice. “There’s no need for any of this today. It's a holiday and these people are just trying to go about their day.”
“You have been working so hard to keep a roof over both of our heads,” Cas said, his voice breaking with every word, “You cook” - Cas brought Dean’s right hand up and placed a gentle kiss to it - “and you clean” - Cas kissed the back of Dean’s left hand - “and you’ve never asked me to sacrifice a minute of my schooling for help.” - Cas held both of Dena’s hands tightly between his own, pulling them to his chest - “I don’t deserve you or the treatment that you’ve given me recently.” Cas met Dean’s gaze, tilting his head to the side.

“Ah,” Cas said, pulling out of Dean’s arms and sitting up next to him. “After you left and I got my head out of my ass, I called Hannah and asked her to pick some stuff up for me.” - Cas wrinkled his nose and scratched the back of his neck - “I would have gone myself but I wanted to do something special for you.”
