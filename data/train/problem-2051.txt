“Sure. I suppose.”
“Are you going to hurt him again?” Leah asked Tony.
“Mmm?”
*****
Chills prickled along his arms as his music morphed into a minor key. But soon, a pair of arms wrapped around his middle and a body pressed against his back. John’s warmth served as a reminded that he didn’t need to think of any of those dreadful things. Because he wasn’t overdosing in a gutter somewhere. He was warm and comfortable in his home. The home he shared with the one he loved.
“John.”
“Sherlock . . .” he breathed in relief and alarm at the same time. He appeared relatively unharmed, just a little disheveled. But at the same time, one finger on the trigger of that gun could end his life at this very moment. His heart dropped in his stomach like a dead weight.
But… I’m curious. Yes, curious. That’s it. Completely objectively curious as to the relationship status of this man I only met yesterday.
“Well if you’d answered you would know exactly where I was, and why I wanted you to meet me.”
John felt slightly self-conscious being under such scrutiny. He knew his scars weren’t attractive, that he was past his prime, and had put on a few extra pounds over the years. He almost had to turn away, unable to watch someone as beautiful and ethereal as Sherlock inspect his ordinary, aging body.
While he dug through it, John explored the other half of the dark, cramped space.
He opened his eyes to see Sherlock’s blurry figure peering over him. A pair of large hands cupped his face.
“It’s your fault,” chanted the surrounding voices. They closed around him once again, pulling him away from Sherlock.
“Are you sure?”
Victor stood at the tip of the bow, his determined gaze fixed onwards at Moriarty’s ship. Rage boiled in John’s stomach at the sight of this … this
He prepared himself to march up to the bow and give Victor a good piece of his mind, but stopped when he saw Jackson and Bolt off the to edge, staring him down, almost challenging him to go stop Victor. John thought back though the whole day. The two thugs had seemed to be watching him like a brooding vulture waiting to dive in for its meal the whole day. They even seemed to be, who knows, waiting for something. Waiting for something from Victor, no doubt. The thought turned John's stomach. He didn't know what they were up to, but he wanted no part of it.
He could feel Sherlock’s warm breath on his face, as well as their combined heart beats racing against each other. The air was electrified with the heat between them in that moment and neither dared to break it.
“Don’t move. Just rest,” said the familiar baritone voice, as the hand gently stroked through his hair.
Moriarty had supposedly died about three years ago, at the same time he had. The files could have gone missing anytime since then and they’d never know.
Mrs. Hudson found all of this to be vastly entertaining.  “Happy birthday, dear. So sweet of John to do all of this-"
This is alright, he told himself. They were just two friends hanging out late in the night and happened to fall asleep. No boundaries were being crossed. None that a certain ex-wife would disapprove of.
He took a liking to her almost immediately. The poor man was so lonely. She was perhaps a beaming ray of sunshine in his dull, dull life.
John silently swore to himself. He would have to get through three of these parties with Sherlock. Specifically, with Sherlock looking like
Once they were safely in clear waters and Greg could leave his post at the wheel, he came over to Sherlock, who was slightly warmer but still shaking.
John had made up his mind. Tomorrow he will tell Sherlock he made a mistake and wishes to leave. He could go back to being a prisoner or take a life boat and sail himself to land somewhere. Anything but staying on this ship as a crew member. Sherlock had made it clear he was no longer a captive, but John felt anything but free. He did not belong here.
Another hour or so into the party, the two of them remained at their booth watching the drunken, wiggling bodies mashed together on the dance floor.
As the song neared its end, John looked up into Sherlock’s eyes to find his intense gaze on him once again. His heart welled over with emotion and love.
Sherlock placed a chaste kiss on the top of John’s head. “I didn’t know for sure.”
One was a blonde haired girl wearing a sleeveless, lavender dress that flowed elegantly to her knees. The other was a tall brunette with high arched eyebrows and bright lipstick wearing a short red and gold dress.
“M’fine John,” Sherlock moaned sleepily.
“Yes,” he replied, pulling out a large bag from under a counter. “Here you are. John, I am truly, very sorry.”
Similarly, Mrs. Hudson always shouted up a warming before coming up the stairs. She too had learned her lesson after walking in on them many times and in many various positions.
John nearly scoffed in reply but kept his expression pleasant, for her sake.
“John, are you alright?” Molly asked, her tone entirely different. He looked into her large, brown eyes are realized she was talking about what had happened earlier that day at the morgue.
So she waited.
He asked him about what cases he had tackled in his absence and listened to him retell his adventures with glee. There were several, he noticed with a slight pang. He had missed out on much more of Sherlock’s life than he realized.
Together they sang the chorus.
“Oh, what’s this?” He looked between him and Sherlock. “You got yourself a pet, did you? I should get myself one. Been meaning too. Maybe I’ll just have to share yours,” he said looking John up and down.
**********
His vision darkened from lack of oxygen as he began to lose his strength.
“I’m so happy for you, John!!” Harry cried, squeezing so tight he could hardly breathe. John chuckled and hugged her back for several long seconds.
“He’s my plus one,” Sherlock shot back without looking at her.
The man patted his back. “Chin up. You’ll find your thing. Everyone does. Maybe you’ll train a tiger too someday. Maybe you’ll settle down. Who knows?”
“Victor. Listen to me.”
“Yeah, it’s bloody annoying is what it is. John, what do you think?”
“John. Are you okay? It’s only 8:00. What’s going on?”
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to meet John’s, his pupils blown wide, his gaze pinning him to the spot. John realized he was waiting for him to make the next move. His devilish eyes dared him to break away, escape from between his arms, to reply to Mary.
He looked over and the blonde boy smiling at him reassuringly.
John was instantly drunk on the feeling of his warm, plush lips. He kissed him again and again, chasing the feeling. The primal need to continue seemed to be mutual, as Sherlock kept pulling his face closer to deepen each kiss.
“Come with me.”
“Aw, come on. Don’t be like that. It’s Saturday night! Put that thing away and live a little.”
Sherlock led John down the hall to his bedroom by his hands, kissing him softly as he did so.
“It was Gina,” Sherlock said quietly after some time. John nodded without tearing his gaze from the flames. “All the missing children. It was her. Including her own,” he added with finality.
“It’s alright. Don’t worry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
couldn’t blame those girls.
She suspected William knew something was wrong with that house, and had believed her all those years ago. By not leaving it to her in his will, he was protecting her. Keeping her away from it and all its mystery.
“The one that I want! You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh.”
“Wait, Sherlock. So we’ll be going to more than one of these?”
“Yeah. And if you want to play that game with me it will not end well for you,” he said stepping forward and puffing his chest out a bit. Not backing off a bit, John decided to see just how far he could push this guy. He looked back and forth between him and Sherlock, who was turned slightly more towards them as if listening with one ear. Pulling his best confused face, he waited for the man’s inquiry.
At least, these were the questions keeping John up as he tossed and turned every night. He had known for a long time he was in love with Sherlock. Probably had been since they met. But never once did he ever think Sherlock might return those feelings. He had told him so on their first case. Sherlock didn’t do relationships. End of story.
After the attack had been stopped and Mycroft and Greg helped Sherlock and John get back on their feet, Sherlock felt it was only fair if Irene received the same help. He told Mycroft about her, and he got to work on wiping her record.
He flinched. Sherlock’s voice was stern. “Did. You. Mean it.”
“Hey. John, look at me. She’s gone now. We’ll be alright.”
Their lives weren’t perfect. Sherlock didn’t expect it to ever be. They both had parts of their past that they couldn’t let go of, trauma that stayed with them, new problems that arose, arguments and insecurities. But even though things weren’t perfect, even though they still had a long way to go, Sherlock wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world than right there, playing the violin with John’s arms around him. And John felt the same way. Because even though the most dangerous, adrenaline-filled part of their lives might have already passed, they both knew this was just the beginning.
Quick POV change in the beginning of this chapter, and then we're back to John
When he woke the second time, Sherlock was asleep in the chair at his bedside. A soft grin grew on John’s face as he admired how calm he looked.
His thrusts grew faster and faster. John’s mouth slackened in pleasure as his prostate was hit with perfect accuracy each time. Sherlock groaned and kept his face buried in his neck, biting and sucking. He increased his pace even more, their combined grunts growing needier with each thrust.
“It’s alright, John. You truly had no choice in the matter and you were only doing what you felt was best for the both of us.”
I hope you all enjoyed it!
“You, er, you said there was something you’ve always meant to say to me but never did.”
, he thought. John had shown a glimpse of vulnerability and he dove right in and took advantage of it. John didn't return his feelings. He probably didn't even think before initiating their first kiss. That's probably what he was trying to tell him before Sherlock cut him off. That it was a mistake.
John pictured Victor peering at him and Sherlock through a window or listening at the door during his visit last night. He remembered every drawn-out stare they shared. And, oh god, how John had pushed Sherlock’s curls out of his face before leaving. The thought of Victor witnessing all that sent shivers down his spine and a nervous tightening in his stomach. It’s the only explanation for why Victor would be glaring at his with that much contempt in his face.
“Oh Sherlock,” came Evans’ patronizing voice. Three fingers tilted his chin up. “Use your head. How do you think we knew where to find you?” Sherlock searched his face for the answer but found nothing. “He sold you out.”
“I’m afraid you must return. I’ve kept you here long enough.”
“Oh, he’s fine. He’s tending to your little friends. Ought to keep him busy while I deal with you.”
So... yeah, I'll go ahead and add the "eventual happy ending" tag now so that you guys don't murder me :D
John was hauled into a sitting position.
John met his eyes at his direct mention of the previous night. They had shared a bed on countless cases before but never talked about it. It was one of those things they silently agreed to keep safely hidden in the intimate darkness of the night time.
He couldn’t get enough. The feeling of Sherlock’s warm lips pressed so firmly against his filled his stomach with warmth that spread through his whole body. After waiting so long, once he was able to do this, he couldn’t stop. His heart expanded with the love he felt for him, and the complete fulfillment and certainty of this.
Thank you all for reading this series - and finishing! And of course, to everyone who has stuck with it through all my ridiculous hiatuses. And extra special thanks to those who have taken the time to comment as I've updated. You guys know who you are. Your constant encouragement and wonderful feedback is a big part of what kept me motivated to finish this. I appreciate it more than you can possibly imagine <3
“Sorry for waking you.”
This chapter contains mild, non-graphic domestic abuse
“Humperdinck.”
“Are you alright?”
“You’re a liar,” John spat, completely disgusted at her suggestion that Sherlock would ever intentionally hurt him. Or any of their friends. As for hurting himself, he now knew Sherlock had sacrificed himself to save him, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade. Mary knew it, too.  He knew she did. She was just trying to get a rise out of him. Or possibly plant doubt in his mind about what kind of person Sherlock actually was.
When John awoke from one of the best sleeps he had had in a long while, the events from the previous night came crashing back into his memory. With a content smile, he burrowed himself further into the sheets, warm  , comfortable, and with no intention of rising. Of course, Molly's loud, morning enthusiasm nearly forced him out of bed within ten minutes.
“Should we check it out?”
“Yeah, great,” John said. He sat on the bed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’ve got my own room, so we’ll have privacy when we talk.”
I REALLY hope ya'll have seen StartUp... lol ;)
“Questions?” Evans asked him.
He took in the patterned, spray painted wall paper, the cluttered bookshelves and table, the skull up on the mantelpiece, and finally, their plush, welcoming chairs. Just how they always were. His heart tugged at the comfort and familiarity of it all.
He visibly trembled with frustration and pent up anger, and then threw the board across the room. The moment it hit the wall, they heard a low growl. Like the house itself was pissed. The vibration was quickly followed by the sound of an angry scratch and an invisible force shoving Sherlock onto the floor.
Sherlock was looking just past his head, his eyes glazed over like his mind was on another planet. He wanted to lean forward and rub those forehead creases out with his thumbs, and tell him to just be here in this moment with him.
At this point his voice was wobbling dangerously. Still, neither of them could lift their faces and look each other in the eye.
something!”
Hope you're enjoying this so far :)

"I grew up and finished school on my own, hardly ever seeing my brother or any extended family for that matter. But I never forgot Jim Moriarty's name. It lingered in the forefront of my mind for years until I was old enough to pursue my own ambitions. I made it my life mission to find the man who murdered my parents, rob him of every valuable he owns, kill him, and leave the rest of his crew stranded with nothing to rot."
Once it was over, he looked up and saw what remained of his friend: a lifeless lump wearing a Belstaff coat with a crack in his head. Blood poured from the crack like a waterfall and gathered in a scarlet pool around him.
his eyes asked.
“And exactly what are we supposed to be looking for?” John called after him in annoyance.
Please leave a comment! I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!
All John could do was stare at him and wonder what happened to the man from last night. The small, terrified man who had admitted he saw what happened and climbed into bed with him. The man who ran his thumb along his bleeding throat and apologized with his eyes for not believing him before.
“Dare.”
“The one that I want. You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh”
“It’s not my fault I had an idiot for a cashier eight years ago.”
Sherlock considered this. If the snipers were indeed gone, there was nothing for them to investigate. If they were still waiting in the dark, then any attempt they made to get closer would for sure get them killed instantly. Sherlock signaled John by touching his arm and together, they began slowly backing up towards the exit, never once taking their eyes from the spot.
Mary sighed and turned away. She’d once given him everything and he left her behind so easily. She’d built so much for herself here without him.
"Come, John! Mrs. Hudson's flat!" The man flew out the door without waiting for John, all thoughts of leaving the flat without his coat and scarf gone.
Suddenly another strong force pushed this thing off of him. The chains fell back down to his chest and the invisible hand left his throat. He touched his neck where the skin broke and gasped for breath.
Shut up.
John smiled and turned into the touch. Their lips joined once again, more desperately than before. Sherlock broke away to kiss tenderly at the corner of his jaw and then nestle into his wet neck.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Glad to see you’re awake, Doctor Watson. You gave us all quite a fright,” she said with a warm smile.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder at Sally and Leah carrying a nightstand into Leah’s new room.
His face scrunched up and all the welled up tears spilled from his eyes. He released a single, gasping sob and slid down against the door, pulling his knees up into his chest.
“Evening, John,” Mycroft said.
Victor looked wary of Sherlock’s casual use of his first name. “…. Right.”
John recoiled at the way she described her miscarriage as the baby being “out of the way.”
"Intersting, I never said anything about Greg."
It was a little detail about their lives that they never talked about or shared with anyone. They knew it was one of the many little things they did that blurred the line between platonic and something more. It was better if they just didn’t mention it.
“Does this feel nice, too?” he asked quietly.
“Yes, but you love it.”
“Agreed.”
Sherlock looked up at him in fright.
“I’m sorry. For everything. I’ve been keeping things from you since I moved back in and put us both in danger, and it was so stupid of me. And I’m sorry.”
He pressed his cheek into his crown in a silent apology.
“Oh yes, don’t worry about me. It really wasn’t necessary for them to come. It was just burnt cookies after all. Sherlock! You haven’t finished deciphering the clue!”
“No. Well, yes. But first I thought you’d like something to eat.”
went unspoken. John broke the eye contact. He couldn’t face it. Instead, he went to set his things upstairs.
“Well, then. I’ll get you another.” Another obvious pause, followed by a timid, “Would you mind if I joined you?”
But she, Mycroft, and Scotland Yard were all joyously happy for them. And John and Sherlock knew it, no matter how they chose to show it.
Sherlock tilted John’s chin up with his hand.
Without thinking twice, he moved in and gently brushed his lips against Sherlock's. It was tentative and shy, as if testing the waters. Sherlock's lips were much softer and warmer than he expected. The other man didn't move or react, just stood there frozen, as if a single movement could shatter this entire moment.  John lingered for a moment, their lips barely touching, before he came to his senses and pulled back apologetically.
This seemed to satisfy her, and the gleeful twinkle returned to her eyes. “Alright. Go run after him like a good little puppy, then,” she teased with a cheeky smile. “Come give me a kiss before you go.” John was astounded that she was asking him to waste time with this. This wasn’t some trip to the grocery store. He didn’t have all the time in the world.
He was astounded at the vulnerability he saw in his eyes. The weakness, the panic, the desperation. Sherlock continued to rub his arms and back vigorously to circulate his blood flow.
“Sorry, Sherlock,” John said, barely containing his laughter. “I couldn’t hear you over the sound of you getting pummeled.” Another one to the chest.
one part of his mind insisted - the emotional part.
“It’s fine. I’m not missing out on anything back home. A dull life that was. At least being here has been interesting.”
He didn’t need to be told twice. He laid down and tried to relax as Sherlock stroked gently through his hair.
He was seeing Sherlock less and less. His performances at work were subpar at best. And he was a terrified father-to-be. His stomach churned every time he remembered that in a few months, Mary would give birth to a baby that would tie them together forever. He was often tired, cranky, and just all around miserable. The little time he was able to spend with Sherlock was often rushed, icy, and awkward.
“Do tell.”
“Don’t worry. I got everything we needed from him first.” He lifted the bag to show John and then set it on the ground. “He and Evans have been in cahoots for a few weeks. They’ve talked mostly about networking, but now want to meet in person before they get into specifics.”
He wondered, what was in it for her? Why would she want to kill him or prevent them from being together? She knew she could never have him back either way.
It was such a weird middle ground to be caught in – he felt like a game of tug-of-war was being played inside him. Was he allowed to mourn the loss of their - friendship? It’s not like they had broken up. How could they break up if they had never been a couple? But of course, surely he was allowed to be upset. They hadn’t known each other very long, but what they had – it was special, whatever it was. They clicked so instantly and easily it was like the universe had always meant for them to come together. Their lives and minds merged together so seamlessly it was hard for John to believe there had been a time when he didn’t know Sherlock. They had become a team, a unit, within minutes of knowing each other. Surely John was allowed to be upset about the loss of such a relationship. He could be upset that Sherlock had essentially sent him away the moment things got a little coarse between them. He could be hurt that all this time, Sherlock had only seen him as a tool and himself as the puppet master, twisting and turning him in whichever way he needed. Surely, that would be painful to anyone.
“Go to hell,” he growled lowly. Mary barked out a cruel, high-pitched laugh.
Gunshots rang out, and John instinctively ducked. However, Molly’s blood-curdling scream of pain halted him in his tracks and made him turn. She laid on the ground with a death grip on her shin, a pool of dark blood expanding around her. Greg knelt by her, trying to lift her under her arms as she shook with panicked sobs. John began to make his way back to them to help, but stopped when he saw Jackson and Bolt turn a corner running towards them.
Seven or eight bodies worth of bones came pouring out of the hole. All small. All children. Sherlock and John looked inside and saw another few down below, still trapped in the wall.
“Moriarty and I have a job to do,” she stated simply. “So I would advise you and Sherlock to not get too . . .
“Details.”
“Umm. There’s still a lot of work that needs to be done here. I don’t think I should abandon them.”
The three men, apart from Evans, launched into a joint story that involved all of them. John was left out of their reminiscence, and he was alright with that. It seemed the room had forgotten he was there, aside from the sympathetic glances Leah would spare him every now and then.
They descended the stairs together, flashlights in hand. John allowed himself a private smile when Sherlock graciously entered first. Because no matter how much he teased and laughed, he truly did care that he was nervous about going back down there.
In the later afternoon, Sherlock returned to his duties as captain, and Molly returned to her shift with John, who braced himself for her merciless teasing.
At this, John released a soft, relieved laugh.
No matter how many times he was hit, John refused to stop struggling, stop breathing, stop trying to hit back, or shout for the help he knew wouldn’t come. At some point, he was thrown to the ground and beaten severely by all three of them. After a particularly hard kick to his gut, all the strength drained out of his body. He fell limp to the ground, and after another kick to his face, he blacked out.
John was practically jogging to keep up with the long-legged drama queen in front of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
John could very clearly see her knowing smirk. She knew why he had left her. More specifically she knew what he had left her for, and what he wanted in his new life with Sherlock.
“With . . . everything?”
That's all! As always, thanks for reading and comments and kudos are greatly appreciated!!
John breathed in relief. He smiled and leaned into Sherlock’s neck, allowing long arms to envelop him in warmth.
His return to Baker Street was most certainly not going as expected.
“No, it’s alright. I’m fine.”
“Well, I’ll let you get to it then,” Sherlock said. “Thanks for the feet.”
“Hm?”
He pulled back to see Sherlock’s expression was still set in stone. When he finally moved, he lifted his hand and placed it delicately on his lips.
"That's right, dear!” said Mrs. Hudson.
It seemed to just be a normal, empty room, he thought, shining his light around the wilting walls and broken beams. Not too unlike the rest of the cellar.
John released a deep, guttural groan. He pulled back and lapped up and down his length of his cock. He swirled around the tip, and plunged down again, taking more of him in.
A familiar silhouette stood in front of him. His panicking ceased, but full body tremors still ripped through his body.
THE NEXT DAY
A warm rush of affection washed over him as he sat in his chair - oh, how he had missed his chair - across from Sherlock and took a sip.
Sherlock lifted their joined hands to kiss his knuckles.
John struggled harder than ever, his heart freezing in cold panic despite the heat of the flame.
“No, I was being silly. Stacey likes men." She turned sadly bad to John. “Anyway. Take care, John.”
“At this point, you are deliberately hurting me, John. You know very well what I want from us. Yet you insist on heartlessly leading me on and then pulling away at the last moment. Do you deny this?”
John did most of the talking, trying to maintain the peace between the three of them. Though no matter how hard they all tried, the conversations would inevitably fade off into a stony silence until someone piped up and restarted the cycle.
The boy cocked an eyebrow in question at Sherlock. When he didn’t respond, he simply shot him an ever so charming smile. Sherlock’s knees nearly buckled. Now he
“Molly, this is John. I’m sure you’ve heard of him by now. You will work with him today, show him what you do, and just… keep him busy.”
“And you are by far the best thing that has ever happened to me. And I don’t want to ever again hear you say you’re not worth something. Do you hear me?”
He cupped his face in his hands. Why the hell had he just jumped into the ocean during a raging storm to save his captor’s life? He very well could have died.
“No, John. Not quite.” Sherlock smiled at him in that unsettling way of his when a particularly clever serial killer had captured his interest. He lowered his voice and continued.
He answered with shaking hands, and the high-pitched voice he had hoped to never hear again rang in his ears.
“YES!” Sherlock exclaimed. He turned on John, picked him up from his waist, and spun him in the air. “I am on a ROLL!”
“It is my duty as captain to protect members of my crew like family. And seeing as I have failed in that-”
Beppo Rovito.
“John,” he repeated, before kissing him again, harder and hungrier than before. He pushed into his mouth, laving over his lips, teeth, and tongue. John gripped his head, pulling him in tighter. With this encouragement, Sherlock devoured his mouth with a carnal passion he never knew he could have.
“Yeah, I know, you git,” John replied with a chuckle of his own. “And that’s not how truth or dare works.”
Sherlock smiled tightly at him and looked down. Both were avoiding the obvious topic of John’s abrupt departure during the dance. But neither would bring it up.
Thank you all for reading and for your lovely comments! I hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed working on it :)
“Shh, I know.” He pulled Sherlock back against him, this time with his cheek tucked warmly against his jumper. “It’s okay to be afraid.”
“Sherlock. . . They’re bombers. He’s contacting bombers.” His stomach felt more and more hollow as he scrolled through the list of contacts, the full-blown explosives Evans was collecting. Near the bottom, he came across another attachment – a PDF labeled “Anarchy.”
John turned to fully face Sherlock for the first time since they arrived home last night at nearly 4 a.m. They had instantly kicked their shoes off and crashed into Sherlock’s bed – fully clothed and too exhausted to even say goodnight. When daylight filtered through the window and woke them a few hours later, they had immediately called Josephine, wanting to close this case as soon as possible.
“M.” That could only be one person. If Mary was in direct contact with Moriarty, he couldn’t stay here. To hell with second chances. They were done.
This chapter is unbeta'd (is that a word?). Also, sorry for the late update! Life got crazy. Hope you enjoyed and thanks for reading!
Back on deck, Sherlock stood staring out into the direction John had stormed off, his parting words still ringing in his ears. Victor rushed up to him and grabbed his arm. “Sherlock, we have an update. There may have been another miscalculation. This ship actually doesn’t have any information useful to us and has had no affiliation with Moriarty in any of its records.”
“Um…” John started.
John grinned and glanced down at the pockets. Sherlock immediately caught on and dove in. After fumbling around a bit in various pockets, he pulled out a small, green piece of paper.
He turned on his side and tried his best to slip into the welcome unconsciousness of sleep.
Their form was sloppy and loose, unlike the previous dances they had shared, but it didn’t matter. Not to Sherlock, and not to John. Everything about this shared moment, alone in the comfort of their home with the fire blazing warmly, secure in the company of each other- it was just perfect.
It was these three encounters with Sherlock that had John rethinking everything after Mary’s miscarriage.
*****
Sherlock didn’t move as John aggressively brushed past him, the breeze making him sway slightly on the spot. His eyes were definitely wet.
Sherlock tip-toed inside, listening carefully for any signs of life, but there were none. Not even a single passed-out junkie laying slumped against the wall.
"Seriously?"
“What, no! What for?”
Sherlock thought perhaps it wasn’t the best time to say none of this would’ve happened if he’d just answered.
Sherlock gave him a quick once-over. He said he’d come running as soon as possible. But the dampness in his hair suggested he’d gelled it up right before leaving. He picked up a trace of recently applied cologne as well. Instead of berating him for cleaning up before coming to the morgue of all places, he turned to John.
John nodded. After another beat of silence he tried again to prompt him into speaking.
Sherlock looked down at the dark yellow liquid and swirled it around in the glass. “Just seemed like a better option,” he mumbled.
At some point, a blanket was draped over his shoulders and a pair of large hands began rubbing down his arms. John realized he’d been trembling and pulled the blanket tighter around him.
Understanding set in with a pang of guilt. Of course, he should have realized. Sherlock, like anyone, has his issues, his danger nights. His moments of temptation. But he was resisting the urge to use.
“Yes. He’s very good. Simply brilliant! Never gets caught.”
The van took John to an area of town that was just as isolated and run-down as the hostel they’d stayed at all those weeks ago. Hardly any trees could be spotted along the drive and the rocky, poorly paved road made for a bumpy ride. The van pulled up to a building and John hopped out. The motel in front of him was single-story and just as worn as the faded out lines on the parking lot. The tile in the front was stained and yellowed as the muggy windows, and the landscaping was dried up and wilted.
“And did you really not know how to play truth or dare?”
John took both of his hands in his and began swaying them back and forth playfully.
“John,” he growling grudgingly through gritted teeth breathing down into his face.
“Let me lean on you,” he mumbled quietly in the comfortable darkness.
“Come on let’s see what you got,” she teased, and John began to move with her. She turned around so her back was against his chest and reached up to touch his face. The two of them stepped side to side in relative time with the music. Stacey’s dancing was upbeat and energetic, whipping her head from side to side and shaking her hips, but John only kept on watching Sherlock.
“Come on.” Sherlock gently pulled him back into the bed and settled in next to him. John rested his head on Sherlock’s bare shoulder, and they wrapped their arms around each other in mutual comfort. John could clearly hear and feel their hearts beating hard in their chests.
“Hey, Sherlock.”
He wringed his wrists and looked apologetically between the two of them. “I am so, so sorry.” John’s heart sank…
“Okay, shhh…” John tried to calm him more as he clearly couldn’t speak just yet. “It’s okay, love.”
"I never... Greg and I...." She stuttered, desperate to back out of this conversation.
“I’m a wanted pirate, John. I can’t just wander into the city and buy a flat share.”
Whereas  in the first part of his tale, Sherlock had been quiet, shaky, and hesitant, his voice was now firm, confident, and more determined than John had ever heard it. His heart shattered at the sight of him. So broken and hurt, yet also determined, angry, and vengeful.
"I don't know what you're talking about."
“Shouldn’t you be heading home?” Sherlock asked absent mindedly, gently adjusting the dials on the microscope.
“What?”
“Sherlock,” he gasped, still catching his breath.
“No,” Moriarty finally concluded after scrutinizing them carefully. “Leave them. They’re my… shall we say, tokens.” With a wave of his hand, he sent his men scattering around the ship.
As they locked eyes, John could actually feel the air electrify. He wondered if Sherlock could feel it too. John had been on this ship for several weeks. Weeks of short visits, sneaky glances, and desperate gazing from across the ship.
“What?” He stopped himself from adding ‘love’ once again.
Before a single order could be given, heavy, icy rain drops stormed down from the clouds. Almost simultaneously, the erratic waves began violently rocking the ship. Boxes, chests, and anything else not firmly tied down began shifting and toppling over. The booming crack of thunder vibrated through the whole ship.
John leaned forward in his chair. “I really don’t appreciate you brushing off both my experiences and Josephine’s as if they didn’t happen.”
His body began to spasm as it panicked and tried to save him. His lungs burned violently in his chest. At once, he couldn’t hold out any longer. He felt himself drift backwards in the water as his back collapsed against the wall. Sliding down the rocky surface, he tried holding onto his last bit of consciousness before slipping into darkness.

He came to her one day when she was in her mid-30s. He told her he was looking for a faithful companion with her skillset. He promised her comfortable living, excitement, companionship. She’d never have to worry about anything again. As someone who grew up with nothing and no one, it sounded wonderful. She accepted.
“NO STOP! Please! They’re in my cabin. There’s a hidden compartment on the underside of my desk. It’s all there. Just…. Please.”
Mary’s twinkling eyes hardened. Her smile fell. “John. May I ask what your problem is?”
“Yeah, what about it?”
“Oh.” John tried to hide the pang of disappointment in his chest.
**********
~~~~~~~~~~
“Sherlock.” He didn’t move. He didn’t blink. He didn’t even twitch. John was unsure as to whether or not he was even breathing.
It felt nice. Before he knew it, he slipped off into a peaceful slumber.
“If you insist. I used the rope, John.”
“Yeah, well, you could’ve done without calling the manager stupid just now, and telling him his wife was cheating on him with four different people.”
“You shot the cabbie,” he said as he snorted and laughed harder.
The violent explosion blasted all around him, and his comrade was blown into bits right outside the trench. John lowered his head as the scorching heat surrounding him seared into his skin.
The bomb vest, the hard drive, the red dots threatening to end their lives at any moment. Sherlock was at the pool from one of their earliest cases.
Sherlock hovered over his belt buckle. “John?” he asked.
“Yes, John. I’m coming. Hold on.” Even the sound of that voice was enough to just slightly calm his nerves.
“I didn’t perform his autopsy. But yes, if they were here, they’d be in one of those drawers.”
“Well I think you should,” Sherlock found himself saying. John’s wandering eyes snapped back to him, and for a moment, he wondered if he’d just made a huge mistake.
“Can’t you get one of the crew members to do that for you?”
Victor’s eyes widened in surprise.
“I… yeah,” he said, awkwardly rubbing the back of his head and looking down. The rain was quickly picking up, causing both of their thin shirts to cling to their bodies.  “Wasn’t a difficult guess to make, I suppose. With your old, damaged coat and scarf ‘going missing’ at the beginning of the scavenger hunt.”
Sherlock smiled and rested his head back on his chest.
When Sherlock shifted his hips slightly more to the center and thrust in a particularly gratifying way, he threw his head back again.
Also, I used
John had gotten back together with Mary at the suggestion of Mycroft. He had to keep his baby safe as well as Sherlock. There was no guaranteeing she wouldn’t try to kill him again if he left her.
And countless other stolen moments where something could have happened. Anything. But it just didn’t. Until now.
In the end she had to be content with Sherlock being sent on a suicide mission. Even though he didn’t die by her hands, she won. John was hers.
“That’s the name of the host. That man over there.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. I have a better idea,” Victor said.
The thought cut deep in his gut. Now that he knew the feeling of Sherlock’s lips on his own, the feeling of his hands and mouth on his body, he couldn’t forget it.
~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock shook his head. “I’m off the stuff.”
John scowled in budding anger. “You wanna ease up a bit?” he said, trying to keep his voice at a low volume. “I’ve been here less than a day.”
John chuckled. “Bugger. Perhaps the last one would have been more enjoyable. Once we had gotten together and all.”
This time when they reached the deck, Sherlock was there to greet him with a large, though entirely fake, smile.
He stilled, waiting for Sherlock to close that last bit of space between them. He convinced himself it was out of courtesy, and not cowardice.
“Mary, what the hell?!”
“No, pick truth.”
He withdrew his hand and positioned himself at the widened opening. As he slid himself in, Sherlock sighed beautifully beneath him and fluttered his eyes shut. John surged forward and slotted their lips together once more, kissing him hungrily and rolling his hips.
All finished! Thanks to my beta Sandy (@yorkiepug on tumblr)! I couldn't have done it without her.
“Well at least I didn’t turn down a perfectly good opportunity for a shag because I’m ‘married to my work.’ I mean, what kind of pathetic excuse was that?”
Sherlock, now all but foaming at the mouth, struggled against the ropes. This only made Moriarty smile in satisfaction. John, on the other hand, was so very close to freeing his hands.
“You also…”
Greg handed him a raggedy mop and a bucket of gray, soapy water. “Captain says if you won’t talk, he at least wants to put you to good work. You know, help out. Do something beneficial to the ship.” He shrugged. “He has little patience for anyone who isn’t directly useful to him. That’s why our crew is so small.”
Sherlock tore another bin open. “How sure?”
He thought about the growing wetness in Sherlock’s eyes as he had yelled, but shook it off. He knew Sherlock would be fine. He’d taken a scolding from him before, just not anytime recently. He would get over it, but right now John needed some fresh air and time alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
He tore his eyes away from Julia practically throwing herself on him and focused on Stacey. He placed his hands on her hips and began to move more enthusiastically with her.
Sherlock stated at him a moment as if trying to figure him out. Shaking his head once at the unexpected retort, he continued, “Enough of this. Tell me. What do you know of the whereabouts of pirate lord Jim Moriarty?”
No. Why do I even care so much? Just eat and stay out of it.
“The one that I want. You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh”
John finally met his eyes with a small but unabashed smile. It lit his face up like the sun. “I’m glad you’re here,” he admitted into the quiet space just between them. The statement was simple to an outsider, but between them it held the weight of all they’d been through the last few years. All the times they’d almost lost each other, and all the times they never expressed how they felt.
“Sherlock,” he said, his voice wavering slightly. Sherlock lifted his head. For a moment, he seemed afraid he would be told to stop, but one look told him that was not the case. John gave him his best bedroom eyes, which he returned, and together they smiled from ear to ear.
“He was obviously going to ask her out eventually. I just did him a favor and sped up the process. Made things easier.”
He whipped out his phone and called Lestrade. When he answered, he jumped right into a rushed explanation of the situation.
“It’s Captain,” he grumbled to no one before hustling back upstairs.
He bolted up and snatched his phone out of her palm, the affection he felt for her evaporating as quickly as it had appeared. Behind him, he heard her curl back up into the sheets, chuckling merrily. “I think your boyfriend misses you, John,” she mocked.
“It’s an attack, John. We
John reached one hand up and clutched the back of his collar like he’d be damned if he ever let him slip through his fingers again. He realized John had almost just lost him for the
He followed the sound to the source. The door to the bedroom was already cracked open, so he eased it open a bit further, creating a soft creak. Leah immediately looked up from where she was sitting on the bed.
The intro piano chords to Faithfully filled the room. John’s head snapped up, nostalgia flooding through his chest; he knew those notes anywhere.
Four beats. Five. Six.
“You?!”
“So,” he started, working up the nerve to ask. “That man…,” he trailed off after seeing the expression on Sherlock’s face. His eyes were wide and practically bulging out of their sockets with an unnerving, mischievous gleam. His closed mouth was stretched in the most unsettling, predatory smile he had ever seen. “What…?” he began to ask. Sherlock’s bulging eyes darted down to his bowl of soup and back up to his face, and his smile widened even further.
John sobbed quietly into Molly’s shoulder, hating himself for breaking in front of everyone like this. She rubbed his back and shushed him gently. “Oh, John,” she said, leaking a few tears herself. Greg, stone-faced from shock, squeezed his shoulder tightly.
“John?”
Sherlock flipped through the dusty pages, squinting at the faded print. “It says that when making a contract with a mortal, Moloch will sometimes request the firstborn child in the bloodline. That would have been Christine at the time.”
“The one I need, the one I need. Oh yes indeed, yes indeed!”
"Why? You're both pirates. You do the same thing."
“I . . .” He fought back to urge to agree, to go with him and be his partner again. “I can’t Sherlock.”
Sherlock stayed out until dark. John barely ate the whole day and stayed planted in front of the television. He had at least brought his laptop down and spread out some books and papers to create the illusion of being busy in case Sherlock came home.
“Mm. This is the fourth time this week, John. And the seventeenth since you moved back in,” he said gently.His clear, blue eyes were unmistakably, even in the darkness, filled with tenderness and concern.
“Thought I’d welcome you boys back from your trip with a fresh batch of-” She halted in her tracks and took in their tousled hair, flushed faces, and swollen, red lips. And then Sherlock’s open shirt and the fresh love bites decorating his neck.
John gasped and wriggled, aching for him to go lower. Sherlock dragged his mouth down the trail of hair leading to his pants.
“Yeah.” He may have been drunk, but he wasn’t drunk enough to keep from reddening slightly in embarrassment.
“Sherlock,” she greeted, stifling a yawn.
John got a cab, went straight home. Once at the flat, he marched straight up to his room and flopped onto his bed.
The three of them never brought it up again.
One moment, Sherlock's eyes were fluttering closed as he decidedly gave in. The next, they were jumping apart at the deafening crash behind them.
As the man pulled his arm back to punch, a deep, baritone voice bellowed out, “Mr. Jackson!” The man released him and John fell to the ground on his back. He heard authoritative footsteps slowly approach them. “If I wanted our prisoner beaten and pummeled I would have given the order to do so as soon as he was brought on board. And I certainly would not have assigned the task to someone who spent his first ten waking minutes today struggling to wrestle out of a tangled, inside-out shirt and then proceeded to spill his breakfast all over his lap like a bumbling idiot. For future reference, Mr. Jackson, you are to do only as I instruct you and nothing else. Is that clear?”
“No. Shut up, Sherlock,” John whispered against his lips. They both tightened their holds on each other and kissed again, slowly yet fiercely.
Sherlock halted, causing John to almost knock into him from behind. Looking him dead in the eye, he said, “Is that what you feel I did, John? Rob you of your entire life? Because last I checked, you willingly joined this crew glad to be rid of any so-called life you may have had before. Now are you going to contribute to this ambush with the rest of us or not?”
He read the rest of the letter, feeling his heart clench with bittersweet sentiment.
Sherlock laced their fingers together, squeezing softly.
Sherlock’s eyes almost seemed to glisten with tears, but the illusion quickly vanished when he blinked it away. A small smile tugged at his lips, which he resisted. But John didn’t care. He knew Sherlock had heard him. He smiled and put a hand over Sherlock’s. “Come on. Let’s go to a pub.”
“No, he’s too far out! I’ll have to go.” He took the other end of the rope and tried tying around his waist, but his fingers had gone numb from the arctic rain. Molly quickly understood and helped him secure the knot. The rest of the crew watched with gaping mouths as John positioned himself on the edge of the ship and dove in.
“The Walters have a history of schizophrenia, and there’s a good chance it lay dormant in Josephine since birth. You know this already. And John, with your history of PTSD, we don’t know that this wasn’t some kind of panic attack. With utmost respect, we can’t really trust your word either."
John’s stomach clenched at the visible reminder that they might be expected to join a dance or two.
“What were you going to say to me?”
John listened to it all without saying a word. He cried when Sherlock cried. Hugged him close. Held onto his hands to stop him from scratching at his forearms. There was nothing he could say to make it better. He couldn’t tell Sherlock it wasn’t his fault, that there was nothing he could’ve done. He knew those would be empty words to his ears. All he could do was be there for him. And he was.
Sherlock recoiled as if he’d been slapped. The rejection both pained and confused him in equal parts. He muttered a soft “no” and reached for the curtain. John waited patiently as he stepped out of the shower, slower than necessary, as though some part of him was waiting for an invitation back in. But the moment never came. Once he was out, John pulled the curtain all the way closed. Sherlock knew it was just for privacy, but it still stung like a cold shoulder.
John’s vision went hazy as he slumped down against the wall. Sherlock kneeled by him, allowing the man to dark around the other side of the building and escape.
Heavy footsteps thudded urgently up the stairs, followed by the door crashing open. Sherlock turned to find John in the doorway – as expected – sweating and disheveled as if he’d sprinted here from his flat.
Sherlock slammed the drawer shut in frustration, making Molly jump slightly.
The side door opened, and in walked a very tired pathologist. Molly slipped her white lab coat on and walked in, dragging her feet behind her. Her long hair was in a lopsided ponytail. Dark bags hung under her eyes, and her eyes were squinted, as though the harsh white light bothered her.
“Talk to me,” he repeated in the ghost of a whisper. Sherlock opened his eyes finally. They were completely pink and the widest and most vulnerable John had ever seen them.
“What?”
John moved in and hugged him around the waist, resting his head on his chest.
“Oh, just come here, John.”
“Sherlock, you can’t deny that there’s something else going on here. The ghost-”
John tried to catch his eye again to offer a comforting look. An apology. Anything.
*****
He wiped the blood off his hand before running the tips of his fingers down in between the gashes. This touch wasn’t clinical at all. He just needed to feel the warmth of his skin and the thump of his heart underneath.
“Shh, keep your voice down!” John huffed as they calmed down. They giggled and imagined their lives with a child in the picture.
This is probably my favorite chapter of this fic. Hope you guys liked it as much as I do!
They shared a warm, knowing smile. Last night, they had spent their first night together, and it was wonderful. They had familiarized themselves with each other’s touches, took their time making love, softly, gently. Afterwards, Sherlock had wept a little with the beauty of it, and John had simply held him. They drifted off together warm and content in each other’s arms and woke up just the same.
“What? I thought you said you’d be home late.” John sat up and stretched his arms.
He could see the shift in his demeanor. Just a slight stiffening of posture. A guarded stance.
“Sherlock, you okay?”
She bit into her trembling lip. “Three years, Jim!” she finally bursted. Once the words were out, the angry tears welled up, and her chest constricted. “No calls, no messages. Nothing!”
“It seems this house really doesn’t like us.”
John responded by wrapping his arms tighter around his shoulders.
He scooted over in his bed and allowed Sherlock to climb on. A particularly horrifying part of his dream flashed before his eyes and he tensed up again. He curled up and released a silent, shuddering sob.
An unnerving smile stretched his lips. “No, my dear. Not Sherlock.”
“Did you-?”
A little breather before we jump back into the action! :)  Plus I figured it was time to deliver on the "comfort" part of hurt/comfort :P
“Now then,” Moriarty said loud enough to get all three of their attention. “Who, might I ask, is the captain of this sad excuse for a ship?” John, Molly, Greg, Jackson, and Bolt all readily looked at Victor.
“But you, John.” Mycroft looked at him strangely again. “He’s comfortable with you.”
One half level up at the bow, Sherlock sprinted to one edge of the ship and bent over the edge, leaning so far overboard he would fall if moving an inch forward.  He sprinted back and forth between sides bending over as far as possible, barking orders and updates at Greg, and then running to another location to look over the edge again.
Fire surrounded them. Smoke clouded their vision. Keeping low to the ground, they looked for an escape. All of the entrances to hallways were blocked off by fire except one. They nodded to each other in understanding, and bolted toward it, making it out just before it was overtaken by flames.
“Science, John. Your weak, feeble minds couldn’t even begin to comprehend.”
“For the sake of your well-being I suggest you cooperate upon being questioned. The faster you surrender the information I ask of you the better off you will be.”
John thought with a sharp ache in his chest how much fun they’d have if they danced. The blinking, colored strobe light flashed the silhouettes of the fist-pumping crowd on the walls around them.  The beat of the music pounding into their chests, the DJ, and the clusters of people waving their arms in the air. . .  it all looked so wonderfully enjoyable.
Goddammit, he thought as he watched Sherlock and Ray laughing heartily with drinks in their hands. He was hopelessly in love and he knew it. This was no longer just him repressing pent up feelings and attraction. He had it bad for Sherlock, always had, and it was screwing with his head.
It was three stories high and in relatively decent shape. Not overgrown or wilting like he expected a “haunted house” to be. In fact, it would have appeared quite picturesque to any passerby ignorant of its sinister history.
He looked rather dashing, he thought as he fixed up his hair a bit. Sherlock had good taste.
John slid his hand over further so their fingertips barely grazed one another. Sherlock looked directly at their hands and then up at John. He had the most focused, intense gaze John and ever seen, and it was zeroed in directly onto him. With his pale skin, upturned coat collar, and dark curls delicately falling onto his forehead, he looked absolutely breathtaking. Shining against the midnight blue sky, the bright moon cast its delicate light down so Sherlock was almost glowing.
“John,” he repeated. In his voice, John could hear the gentle reminder of a conversation they had had earlier.
“This
“Here you are,” he said.
He gasped in a sharp breath as Sherlock sucked a hickey where his neck met his shoulder. He pulled back momentarily, shifting so he was positioned right over his scar.
Immediately, Julia threw her arms around Sherlock and pressed her whole body to him. He rolled his eyes and looked past her shoulder at John.
“You’re still here?”
So she pulled the trigger.
“Sherlock, look at me.” No response. He remained with his back turned and faced the microscope.
“Yeah, thanks.” The man led him down two levels below the deck and shut him in a small cell.
” He was so close to the gun . . . just a little bit further.
Before stepping out the door, he stopped in his tracks. “Oh, and Angelo-“
John giggled and swatted at his hands, telling him to stop with no conviction. Sherlock chuckled along with him and kept smearing snow all over him, both their smiling from ear to ear.
"Thank you, Mr. Moriarty.”
“You’re not really the captain, are you?”
Sherlock’s voice piped up after some time sounding small and cautious. “John, I . . . there was more empty space in the wall. I could hear it.” John met his eye. They both knew what they would find there.
He scanned the club, but his height and the dim lighting made it difficult to see anything. After walking in countless aimless loops, he finally spotted Sherlock chatting with the host in a far off, darkened corner.
“In time, yes.”
wanted it.”
“Well, er, that’s great. I have some stuff to catch up on anyway so . . .”
“Oh, yes. But the host being arrested for multiple intentional manslaughters does put quite a damper on the mood. I assume it was canceled.”
“Morning,” he crooned.
John clamped his jaw shut. He had a gorgeous lady on his arm too and he was just as free to have fun as Sherlock was.
“I don’t deserve to go. Not after yesterday.”
At last, no more tears fell, but both of his cheeks remained slick. He clutched his aching stomach as dry sobs continued to rip through him in loud, rapid gasps.
John woke up the next morning to the sound of rattling keys and his cell door creaking open. The gray-haired man called Lestrade smiled weakly at him. “The Captain wants you up on deck.”
“Don’t worry about it,” John said. “Not everything can go exactly as planned, I suppose. You sure you’ll be alright?”
“I shouldn’t have assumed. I know you would never-”
“Of course I do.” He pecked a kiss on the corner of his mouth. “I love you too.” A peck to the other corner. “Always have.”
Be ready at 7? What was this, a bloody date? John shook his head and sighed. If he was going to be forced to go on a case with Sherlock, why couldn’t it be a nice, simple murder off in a filthy garage somewhere.
“Sherlock. Shut up. Just shut the hell up right now.” Sherlock’s words made John’s blood boil with anger. He could feel his face burning beet red. He couldn’t believe Sherlock was sulking over a segment of a conversation he overhead without context. Not only that, but he’d decided to pout about it like a child instead of simply asking him about it.
John realized he really hadn’t thought through his decision last night. These were pirates! And being part of the crew meant he would have to partake in this. No. No one could make him harm innocent lives if he didn’t want to.
He screamed in his mind.
Then, a pair of arms were around his waist and he was hoisted up off the ground.
“And we danced. You asked . . . I was enjoying it . . . I thought you were too.”
They wormed their way into the dancing crowd, squeezing between bodies and bumping into people. The colorful dots of light roamed the crowd as they struggled to find space. Eventually, they found a cleared area near the top corner by the bar.
“Yes. And I missed them even more at the party the other week.”
“Why? I thought you had total faith in me and it was perfectly safe for me to be here.” With every word exchanged between them, his blood pressure rose and his suppressed anger at Sherlock boiled higher to the surface.
“Goodbye, John.” And with that, he turned around, spread out his arms, and fell into the water.
He landed on top of Sherlock, cradling his head to prevent it from hitting the ground. “Thank you,” Sherlock said coarsely.
The urge to lean forward and kiss over the bandages suddenly overtook every fiber in his being. His head began to lower seemingly of its own free will. With his lips hovering mere inches from his chest, he broke out of this hypnotic state and realized what he was doing.
“I . . . I made you breakfast. Poppy seed muffins. Your favorite . . . I remembered.”
“Mary,” he croaked out. His throat burned horribly at the attempt to speak.
“It’s your fault,” they repeated as Sherlock’s body was completely blocked from his view.
It was then that he heard a small cough to his left. A tall figure stood in the shadows of the parking garage beside him. John looked between the men blocking his path and the man in the shadows. After studying the silhouette a bit harder, it finally hit him. He rolled his eyes and trudged into the garage. With each step, he conveyed how irritated he was until he was a few meters away from the shadowed man.
Sherlock placed his hand on the back of his shoulder and led him in. Almost instantly, he calmed.
When John woke a few hours later, Sherlock was still in his bed. John was on his side, knees slightly tucked. Sherlock was behind him with one arm carelessly thrown over his torso, and his face buried into the nape of his neck. John was not surprised to see that he had been crowded to the far corner of the bed while Sherlock was splayed over the empty space like it was his own to claim.
They both scooted towards the middle until they were pressed together from the shoulders down to their legs. Between the jumper, t-shirt, and their proximity, they managed share enough body heat to at least not get frostbite.
After some time, John noticed Sherlock had stopped eating and was staring him expectantly. He realized he’d stopped eating himself and was simply watching him in wonder (for who knows how long) with a stupid, cheesy grin on his face.
“Very well,” he said. “I suppose I’ll just have to visit John again. He needs to be taken down a notch anyway.”
“Alright, that’s enough.”
She closed the top of the bench and picked up a picture frame on a nearby stand. Her heart clenched as she stroked her thumb over her and John’s faces, looking a bit younger and a bit happier. A completely different time.
For several seconds they sat in the grass, the distant red police lights flashing around them as the officers sorted things out.
“Isn’t it? You said ‘truth’ so I confessed something truthfully.”
Let me you what you think! I'd appreciate any constructive feedback :)
"Can't do this."
“Daniel Ray,” Sherlock said after they had settled down.
“Where are you going?”
Next in the box was a book about the history of the British army Sherlock had gotten him. He never got around to reading it, but inside, the pages were filled with cross-outs, scrawled footnotes, and corrections.
“I’m surprised no lovely lady in red has come to pull you away yet, actually,” John said, looking over Sherlock’s shoulder at all the beautiful women dancing around them.
(See the end of the chapter for
As Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, the door burst open. Greg stumbled in panting. “Sherlock, Victor wants to see you up on deck." He allowed himself to gaze into John’s eyes a moment longer before reluctantly looking away and putting his hat back on.
“Did you replace the bandages after your shower?”
“John,” Sherlock breathed uncertainly.
He swallowed Sherlock’s needy moan as he thrust his fingers into his prostate. “You gorgeous thing.”
“Right. So… what did you get out of him.”
John knew he was the one who needed to apologize. For for keeping secrets, for pushing him away, for abandoning him, for putting him in danger. For all of it.
“You’re drunk.”
“Of course you are. But here’s nothing in the fridge, I’m afraid,” he replied, pushing the damp curls out of his face fondly.
“No, it’s alright, John. I believe you,” he chuckled. “Large cellars tend to get quite cold around this time of year.”
She stuck her hand out, and Sherlock and John each shook it in turn. In the living room, two policemen were tearing through what looked like a box of family albums. One of them fell, and pictures scattered everywhere
John's gaze followed her momentarily. He did worry slightly of the gossip that was inevitably about to travel through the whole ship, but decided in a moment that he did not care. He was with Sherlock now and that's all that mattered. As he began to redirect his gaze back to Sherlock, his eyes skimmed past Victor. Standing slightly behind and to the left of Sherlock, teeth on edge, zeroing a red hot, murderous glare directly in on him.
“You're the one that I want! You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey! The one that I want! You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey.”
“What, you think leaving my wife has left me so shattered I couldn’t be bothered to get out for a bit and help? You think you need to treat me like a child? Bringing me breakfast as if I can’t take care of that myself?”
That night, John and Sherlock laid together in bed, Sherlock’s head on John’s chest, his soft curls being stroked lazily. John had decided not to bring up the previous night again. If Sherlock wanted to tell him, trusted him enough to tell him, he would do it on his own. Luckily for him, he did.
“What’s going on?” John inquired.
John woke up to a blast of thunder so powerful it shook the room. He glanced at the clock on his nightstand, squinting in the dark. It was only 3:30 in the morning. With a groan, his head fell back on the pillow. If he was going to be woken up by thunder, why couldn’t it have been at a more decent hour? He rolled over and reached out to spoon Sherlock close to him. Only he couldn’t. Because the other half of the bed was empty.
