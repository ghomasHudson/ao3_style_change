Today he found himself by a lazy river sitting in the grass along the banks smoking the last cigarette in his pack. The silly Sherlock ran his fingers through the grass and pulled. Some blades came away from the ground and he wiped them off. Packing up was quick, and he retraced his steps up the dirt path.
“These cases involving soul bonds are a waste of my time,” Holmes had grumbled after our worried client left. He had been right. The client insisted she was abducted and wouldn’t leave him. He was wrong and she had left to pursue another whose bond with her was stronger and had gone into hiding until her current bond withered away. Leaving for a stronger bond was a common enough occurrence; despite Holmes explaining this to our distressed client, he insisted on Holmes’ help.
Sherlock’s hand skitters trying to find purchase on the smooth surface of the gas tank. John flattens the hand against the tank feeling the contrast of the hot flesh against the cool metal. Sherlock’s hips continued to squirm under John’s other hand. John pulled back and looked up to find Sherlock panting and a red flush across his cheeks. John loved the sight and taking Sherlock apart.
“I believe you did not reply in an acceptable fashion to her previous invitation to tea?” Asked Holmes, still holding the letter and knowing perfectly well what the answer would be.
Some of the tension eases when Greg pulls away, and John starts feeling more relaxed in his new surroundings. The class begins with warming up and stretching. John tries not to smile as Greg groans when trying to stretch.
Watson gave his companion a reassuring smile. “We could give them away. I’m sure a neighbour would appreciate them. Maybe Mrs Lloyd might like some.”
And so I did. His arm return to his mouth and muffled groans and sounds of ecstasy were directed towards my efforts.
“Browse away! This one is a beauty. Goes from zero to sixty in four seconds. She may not be the fastest on the road, but she sure is pretty. If that’s not your thing, we have plenty of...”
The Ledbury indeed was the perfect setting for Sherlock’s set-up. It was modern, with stylish chandeliers and long curtains not quite covering ceiling-high mirrors – and, most importantly, obviously expensive.
Well, that was certainly a new definition of love, but possibly quite an accurate one, John supposed.
Hannah was sitting in Sherlock’s chair, which she’d turned with its back towards the wall, just as vigilant as him, and was holding her phone in one hand and the note she’d found in the bedroom in the other.
had Sherlock thought this idea, of all people’s ludicrous suggestions that Sherlock usually didn’t even come
When he looked up, bewildered, John was suddenly holding out a small sleepy puppy, that had definitely not been in his hands before.
Sherlock and John were not in the middle of an experiment. (At least, Greg prayed to god that wasn’t what this was.)
Sherlock looked up at the sound of purring. It came from one of the cats sitting contently in Sherrinford’s lap. He was gently stroking it.
He’d had the extraordinary sensation of knowing almost exactly what to do, without the usual apprehension of perhaps getting it wrong, as he had often experienced during sex with women. And then Sherlock had managed to, well... press some buttons in one of his hitherto undiscovered erogenous zones, actually making John consider things he had never been keen on thinking about before – which oddly had been kind of freeing as well in its own way.
“With the dildo,” Sherlock whispered into his ear, clarifying, as he gently pulled John towards the bed. He tumbled backwards onto the mattress, taking John with him, at which both let out a giggly grunt. “So, do you want to see?”
“I’m telling you, it’s not the bleeding ring; it just needs that oil that came with it, the one that you bunch of morons managed to knock over and spill.”
Sometimes, he felt so much anger that it nearly suffocated him. He looked at strangers outside and bitterly wondered what they had on their conscience. No rapist ever looked like a rapist, did they? These bastards could be everywhere – and so could their victims, for that matter, for they were just as invisible. John honestly didn’t know what he would have done if that teacher of Sherlock’s had still been alive. It was probably a good thing that he wasn’t.
Also, what did he want from John? Weren’t they still supposed to not be talking? How was them breaking that rule essential to this case?
As the plan to ask Sherlock to marry him gradually took root more firmly in his mind, John’s awkwardness with Sherlock’s past and his own place in it, including his sadness and anger, slowly started to fade to the background, as if a weight had been lifted from him. Interestingly, this somehow seemed to rub off on Sherlock. They smiled at each other again occasionally and Sherlock no longer appeared to postpone going to bed by conducting experiments into the night all the time. Sometimes they lay in bed talking about the cases Sherlock had rejected that day or a news article that John had read.
. Now, I have no idea what they know, exactly. Or how they reacted. Do they think you cheated on Mary with me? Who knows? I’m not there to answer any questions they might have, or to take away misunderstandings. I was supposed to be in control of this story.
Sherlock felt a shiver down his spine. Then he got up and left, slamming the door tightly shut behind him.
She still wanted to continue burning the heart out of the arrogant posh brat at some point, but only once he’d properly found it. That was, if John survived.
Sherlock was busy typing a text. “I needed a hug,” he said, without looking up and continuing to type.
Sherlock’s voice jolted him out of his contemplations. “We were all formed by what happened in our families in the past, John,” he said, unsurprisingly knowing exactly what he was thinking. “But everyone has a different survival strategy, which can then make people drift apart. You were the one who taught me the importance of open communication. When I simply applied it to your sister, you both opened up.”
As they sat down at the small table in his room, Sherlock leaned close to John and put a hand on his shoulder, to help Sherrinford figure it out. When Rosie instantly stretched her little hands towards him, indicating she wanted to move from John’s lap to his, he took her in his arms.
A third cop could be heard approaching on the corridor and then greeting Moore. “The shawl has been confirmed as belonging to the boy’s mother,” the voice then said.
“John, I might as well tell you. I’m in love with you. I have been from the very beginning. And I can’t bear the thought of you ever leaving.” He said it all matter-of-factly, thinking that this explanation would surely satisfy John and convince him of the sincerity of his motives; thereby serving as adequate compensation for his general ambiguously interpretable aloof behaviour.
Except, he had Rosie now, of course; so he wasn’t sure exactly what the likelihood was of him ever moving back to Baker Street even if Sherlock wasn’t in fact deliberately keeping him at a distance (and despite Sherlock having been fine with them staying there extensively on a temporary basis, which obviously was not the same thing).
of this,” Sherlock said solemnly. “I’ve never had any sort of sex with… well er… anyone, really… but you.”
He straightened back up and they looked at each other for a moment, suddenly serious. Through a miracle they were both still alive. Alive and together, blood rushing through their veins, now filled with raging testosterone and adrenalin.
As his gaze rested on the papers without really seeing them, he went over all the details of his meeting with her yet again, looking for fresh clues in what she’d told him.
John couldn’t hear what was being said after that, and shook his head in amazement at his wrong assumption about which of them had been the cartoon fan. He decided to get himself a sandwich and head back home for a rest after all. He was only chasing ghosts here.
In the background, he heard Hannah ask, “Have they got her?” and John apparently nodded, because Sherlock then heard her scream and yell euphorically, followed by cheers from the officers.
. John was rather restlessly squeezing the pillow he was holding on to in an apparent attempt to refrain from moaning out loud, as Sherlock tirelessly kept up a steady rhythm while holding John tightly with his strong arms.
“Yes, I did. They were those round little blue pills. Mr Cargill prescribed them for me. I got them from that new pharmacy on Bickenhall Street.”
“I’m Shirley,” John heard Sherlock say, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, “and this is Janine.” John’s smile froze on his face upon hearing that name. Although Janine had become quite a dear friend after Sherlock had dropped his façade with her, the mention of her name in the context of Sherlock’s partner gave him a foul taste in the mouth. He told himself it was just a random woman’s name starting with the same letter as his to make it easier to remember. Nevertheless, he promised himself he would get back at Sherlock for this one as soon as an appropriate opportunity arose.
Hannah’s voice sounded agitated from across the hall as she spoke on the phone. “It must be that woman who you said was my doppelganger, who lives across the street!”
And that meant one simple thing, seeing as how the Consulting Criminal had always liked to get to him through John.
Just then, they heard a loud thud and a breaking noise from the landing. Sherlock looked at John in alarm and, having tucked himself in already, jumped for the door. He narrowly avoided the casserole dish sitting on the landing, which turned out not to have been the source of the sound. He then took in the sight of a startled Mrs Hudson covering her mouth as she shrank back from the large broken flowerpot on the floor. “Oh dear,” was all she managed.
A couple of times, as it did again now, the thought had crossed his mind that he could ask John to move back in with him. But this was probably a foolish thing to even contemplate. John had a good job as a GP now and no longer needed a flatshare.
She often gave him advice during his visits, and he often followed it. Particularly about raising Rosie.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, trying very hard not to kick himself. This had definitely been the stupidest idea he’d had in a while. “I guess that’s for the best, yes.”
Sherlock went to stand closer to the doorway and leaned out of the ambulance, holding on to the poles on either side. “Exactly,
Is this what Sherrinford had imagined the reason was why he’d not seen Sherlock all these years? Because it only made sense for Sherlock to have been abroad? Studying bugs, like he’d done as a child?
At that very moment, a car loudly crashed into a rubbish bin on the street right in front of the house, sending it flying over the kerb.
All of a sudden, a million ants were crawling through his stomach. He couldn’t stand it anymore. Even though he kept being overcome by a physically sickening anxiety at the thought of actual intercourse, at the same time he wanted it so badly that it was driving him mad. It was not just that he wanted it to be gotten over with so that he could stop obsessing over it. It was just so good to feel John pressed this close to him, to sense John – his steadfast, down-to-earth John – being aroused by
When he came back with full mugs from the kitchen a little later, however, John was surprised to see a small grin on Sherlock’s face.
His shoulders were heaving as his movements slowly stuttered to a halt, a wonderful emptiness stretching out inside him with room for just one thought:
They were on their way to see Smith’s ‘favourite room’. Not the room that provided bliss from IV bags and unrestrained confessions for Smith, apparently.
John casually closed the distance between them and gently rested his hands on Sherlock’s hips. Sherlock immediately relaxed into his touch, letting his head fall back so John could nuzzle his neck. John then let his hands roam over Sherlock’s belly, with one ending up stroking a nipple and the other one on Sherlock’s undeniably hardening bulge. John teasingly pressed his own now rather blatant erection against Sherlock’s arse, not bothering to suppress a soft moan. They had still never done it in this position and a wave of arousal hit him at the idea of bending his lover over right there at the kitchen table, without even having to get undressed properly. His hands came together at the buckle of Sherlock’s belt and he swiftly undid it while he gently moved against Sherlock’s arse, his prick now impossibly hard.
bit my hospital... Er, but I can promise you this: he’s going to get the best of care. I might even move him to my favourite room.”
They were still fully dressed – well, save for John’s open fly and hastily pushed down pants – and had been about to head for bed, toothbrushes abandoned on the edge of the sink.
Strange things were happening in John’s stomach when Sherlock started to finger himself in earnest. Sherlock was so uncommonly beautiful, lying there on his back with his gorgeous long legs spread wide and this one incredible finger elegantly moving in and out of him while subtle noises of satisfaction escaped his throat.
“In that case,” he said, as casually as he could manage, “how about lugging some boxes tomorrow and help me move back in here with you?”
After sneaking into the changing rooms of the rugby team had failed quite miserably (thereby automatically ruling out a second try, as he didn’t want to be seen as a pervert), he’d rather brilliantly come up with an alternative plan. He’d deduced John’s bisexuality and had flirted with him, flirted properly for the first time in his life. In all his nineteen years, he’d seen others do it often enough, and had saved all the insipid little details of the procedure on his organic hard drive, so to speak, just in case he ever needed to apply them.
“The person who shot me in Magnussen’s office will appear here any moment. If you sit in my wheelchair over there, the backlight will make it seem like you’re me, that is, if you turn your coat collar up and ruffle your hair a little. Like this.” Sherlock had then carefully reached up and combed his long fingers through John’s hair – a touch that had made other hairs on John’s body stand on end as well, for reasons he hadn’t wanted to think about.
“It’s a perk of gardening.” Watson wiggled the seedling. Holmes made no move to accept the offending vegetable and continued to glare at it.
Next, Watson considered the side of the plot. He bit the inside of is cheek and tapped the end of the pencil against his lip. He thought that it seemed a waste to devote all of it to a radish experiment. If the fence did keep away the rabbits, then he would be eating radishes for weeks at every meal. Their housekeeper would be here tomorrow, maybe she knew other ways to prepare radishes other than on a salad. Watson added a note to his list of things to mention to the housekeeper, Mrs Glydon. Then again, maybe he could use some of the plot for another vegetable.
The chemical experiments provided the distraction he desperately needed. Not the ones he performed in a test tube, but the injectable kind. They were easy to find on his travels memorizing London’s streets. His new chemical high made life much less boring. Some inspired the clearest thoughts while others calmed his mind and let him think clearly. Why hadn’t he found this fix earlier?
We dined, and Holmes discussed at length the accomplishments of the violinist we would see later. I drank in the sight of him and the very good wine accompanying our dinner.
Holmes frowned. “If you say so resident expert in these things. Well, ‘the good doctor had passed beyond my keen’ might do.”
Watson’s expression was a mixture of fondness and exasperation. “Of course. It would be uncharacteristic of you to abandon such a project on the eve of its conclusion.”
Watson watched the rich, dark earth fall in clumps from his fork. He stabbed the ground and leaned back to stretch and tried to relieve the ache in his shoulder. They were making slow progress and Watson would make even slower progress if he pushed his body too hard.
“I haven’t seen it since… maybe last fall,” said Watson as he placed the bread on the table. He walked back to the cupboards and found the large bowl. “I’ll gather some greens for lunch. I planted extra radishes, maybe you would like to try a radish in your salad?”
Watson turned the tap. The hose swelled and shuddered, yet the state of the patch was obscured by the grass. He slowly walked the length of the hose inspecting every inch for the presence of new tears as he made his way to the patch. That patch would hold, he told himself; he was good at keeping fluids where they were designed to be.
Not that they had become more similar in any way; they were still poles apart in many regards. But they seemed to have reached a stage where they were both able to display an array of very different traits: vulnerability, self-assurance, pliancy, confidence. As if each of them finally had access to their own full palette of colours, like a rainbow sprung free. No longer were they hiding behind a mask of just one or two characteristics that they had subconsciously labelled their personal benchmark.
With a subtly impatient eye-roll, Sherlock added, “If we manage to convince Jack that Violet’s uncle is already dead, he is bound to lose interest in Violet. Because once he and Bob think Violet knows she’s inherited a fortune, they will assume she will be a lot more cautious and never marry without a prenuptial agreement.”
Sherlock got up and aimlessly paced the room for a bit, then found himself staring out of the window again at the light March drizzle that had started to descend through the evening air as a series of new scenarios started to form in his mind.
John managed a smile. “Yeah, okay. I was just wondering, you know, whether we wanted to tell people already or not. Whether it would be okay for the public to know, things like that. Stuff we should probably discuss.”
Eurus had returned only once to the safehouse where she’d left the GPS tracker. But by then, Lestrade had long tired of waiting and he’d reduced the number of officers on the stakeout to just one. Unsurprisingly, the lone lookout hadn’t been able to catch her when she’d shown up. “Gone like a shadow,” the constable had told Greg. “Like a witch who can turn herself invisible.”
“Oh yes, that would be ever so kind of you,” Sherlock replied, somewhat subdued and still trembling a bit – rather convincingly, John thought – and he gave a fake address, which, knowing him, was probably the actual street where Bob and Jack lived.
There was something decidedly cheeky about the little smile on John’s face. Now that he was apparently – to an extent – better enough to be out and about like this, did that mean he was also better enough for other… physical activities?
“Come on, let’s scoot over to the middle of the bed,” John whispered. Which was a good idea, seeing as their legs were uncomfortably dangling off the edge.
“Right.” John nodded, staring down at his hands. “It’s alright. I’m sorry.” He looked up at Sherlock. “So that means we can’t see each other for a while, then.”
“Great work, Sherlock,” Greg said on the phone. “We’ve found the place where she’s staying. She wasn’t there, unfortunately. But I’ve put four officers on a stakeout near the building to maintain constant watch over the place: two for each entrance. I’ll let you know as soon as we’ve got her.”
There was an awkward silence, in which John tried to piece the puzzle together. When Sherlock said their relationship was never ‘real’, did he mean they hadn’t even..?
Just as he started hastily leafing through their cook books in order to try to find a suitable recipe, Sherlock stopped him.
As John possessively pulled Sherlock close, his mouth now moving to Sherlock’s jawline, Sherlock could sense an internal struggle going on inside John’s mind, although he couldn’t quite put his finger on the nature of it. Being bisexual was probably more complicated in some regards than being gay, he supposed. Especially for John, after recently having been betrayed by two women whom he’d started to trust intimately and whom he’d subsequently come to hate to the core, Sherlock mused. Perhaps Sherlock’s lingerie reminded John of them.
“I must be hallucinating,” Sherlock muttered faintly – not entirely serious, but those were the only words that would come. In spite of everything, it was still a scenario he could not dismiss entirely.
John huffed out a breath. He definitely didn’t see any ‘romantic entanglement’ for himself in the future, no more than he saw any for Sherlock. It had taken John long enough to fall into that trap and he wasn’t willing to try that ever again. It had almost cost him his life. And Sherlock’s.
Then again, he wasn’t even sure that all that was exactly what John was suggesting. There was no way to know at all where this would lead, if he did stay.
Although spending an entire evening with Sherlock Holmes had been very interesting, to say the least – especially with him being high as a kite – Eurus hadn’t really managed to gain any new information that she could see the use of just yet. But that often came later, after she’d had some time to mull the new facts over in her mind, so that was fine.
He reclined on the goose-down pillows as John quickly leaned over to one side of the bed to find the lube tucked into the front pocket of his weekend bag. Boy, was he glad he’d put it there, with such easy access.
She felt a knot form in her stomach, and looked away. He’d never shown any understanding the other way round.
One afternoon, when John was free from the surgery and Sherlock was out on some errand, John was surfing the internet to get ideas for a nice location to propose. But everything he looked at just seemed meaningless and silly. He paced the room and started to clear away some of the accumulated clutter that had begun to annoy him from the corner of his eye, when the phone rang.
Sherlock hurried over to the kitchen to hold the paper up to the bright lamp suspended over the table, looking for clues he might have missed earlier.
“Maybe it could make my eyes better too,” she said, as she handed him the steaming mug. “They do desert me these days. Mrs Turner says it’s just old age. It comes to us all, doesn’t it? But I’ve never had any problems with my eyes before, you know? Would you like some honey in your tea?”
He thought about Sherlock’s offer. Attentive of Sherlock as it was, though, he needed Rosie with him, to stay sane.
Was it dictated by the number of times they looked toward each other? The amount of non-essential movements they made? How regular their breathing was?
A gazillion thanks once again to Ariane DeVere (arianedevere.livejournal.com) for her transcript of The Final Problem; the dialogues as well as the scene descriptions, which I’ve sometimes copied almost literally to describe John’s dreams.
, I’m afraid, by asking about it. And no, they won’t hire another nanny, as both of them are quite capable of looking after a baby, now that John has recovered from his hospitalisation and also seeing as they are no longer in mortal danger from any criminal mastermind’s revengeful siblings. Hannah was primarily a secret agent, after all, and not really a nanny to begin with.”
Sherlock threw himself onto the sofa to sulk and decided he would simply have to wait until they went to bed.
In fact, Sherlock looked nothing short of stunning in the gold dress with his eyes accentuated with black eyeliner, mascara and green eyeshadow, his cheekbones highlighted with just the right shade of blusher. The extraordinary thing about Sherlock, though, was the way he
. As had John bloody Watson. Their lives were just as dull and empty and uninteresting as everybody else’s. To think that Eurus had once envied Sherlock. Had wished he were part of Sherlock’s family.
He was not going to push him away or scare him off again, not if he could help it. If he was honest with himself (which he was now starting to be), he’d been wanting to hold John like this for years; and finally there was no reason anymore why he shouldn’t. Until now, John had been the only one with the guts to take the initiative, so now it was his turn.
“Also, I’ve talked to Mycroft,” Sherlock said, “and Hannah, the agent, will stay with us for as long as we need her. Because you need to rest as much as possible for a while yet, and even after that, she might come in handy, as long as Eurus Moriarty is still out there.”
“So you think that’s why he was killed, then?” They hadn’t investigated that angle yet, John realised.
Then he pressed another kiss to Sherlock’s surprised mouth, allowing his lips to part ever so slightly this time and caressing Sherlock’s with the tip of his tongue. Soon, he felt Sherlock do the same, a bolt of lightning hitting him in the gut as their tongues met for the first time, tentatively brushing against each other in a slow, mesmerising dance, which for that moment made the world stop spinning and the universe shrink down to pre-Big Bang dimensions.
The cottage was rich with the smell of roasting beef, onions and, what, Watson presumed, was thyme. Watson checked on the meat pie that their housekeeper had brought over to make sure that it was cooking properly.
"I have not given it much thought." Which was true; Watson had spent most of his time reviewing gardening books or gardening that the small bed slipped his mind.
Between then, they had their hands entwined together. Watson rubbed the backs of Holmes’ hands with his thumb.
Holmes raised his hand. “Please, my dear Watson, I did not mean to offend. I know you to be most loyal and I would never ask you to leave me. No, I have a plan and one that might forever throw her off your scent. When you are done, I will explain it to you over tea.” Holmes turned and walked a short distance before saying, “You might want to consider reinforcing the patch.”
Holmes tightly pressed his lips together before slowly adding, “With all of her connections and willingness to be helpful, Mrs Lloyd would know the appropriate place to donate the remainder.”
Holmes frowned and Watson picked up his gardening tool. As they worked, Watson wondered what other schemes Holmes had in store to rid his garden of radishes.
“I haven’t seen him. No one’s seen him.” Also true. “He’s locked himself away in his flat. God knows what he’s up to.”
As soon as the ragged breaths near his ear told him that John was close, Sherlock wrapped his hand around his own cock, knowing precisely how to time his orgasm so that it would drive John over the edge and they would climax simultaneously. A technique he had fine-tuned over the three weeks they had been having intercourse now. He firmly stroked himself, until it flooded over him, drowning him like a sudden incoming tide, pulling him under, leaving him gasping for air, stranded like a flabby sea creature on a hot beach. It was a matter of seconds before John followed, uncoordinatedly slamming into his limp body – his loud grunts sending wonderful shivers over Sherlock’s moist and now extremely sensitive skin.
Eurus took off her clothes and washed herself with the cold water in the tiny makeshift kitchen of one of her safehouses.
John was busy in the kitchen, which he’d secretively declared forbidden territory for Sherlock until further notice.
For the following few moments, Greg just stood there gaping at the two of them, seeming to have completely forgotten why he had come to Baker Street in the first place.
in what sense?” he asked, as he went to stand behind John and put his arms around him, curiously watching the kneading process over John’s shoulder.
When they came back into the lounge, all dressed again, Hannah had an outrageously proud, knowing grin on her face.
If he tried, really tried, from now on not to act annoyed at Mycroft, would Mycroft automatically stop being annoying, he wondered?
Sherlock took it, and followed him into the bedroom, which was bathed in orange light from the evening sun, mirroring the warmth he felt inside at John’s suggestion.
(Just in time, she’d repressed the automatic reflex of grabbing her wallet as well to offer him a small bribe, as would be customary to speed things up back home in Russia. But she wasn’t back home in Russia. She was back home in the UK, she reminded herself.)
He’d kissed him back and had pressed his body close to John’s. John still couldn’t quite bloody believe it.
Thus, John’s heart became filled with more and more love for his mad detective. Love that sometimes merely simmered in the background, that frequently bubbled up to the surface in the form of words or gestures, and often manifested itself in gropes and kisses, which, in turn, occasionally led to other activities.
believed that any of that could ever be real, not even now that Mary was gone. But still, he’d thought that
After Sherlock had come back to his senses and John was lying cuddled up next to him, John jokingly teased, “So which Janine sucked you off better, eh?”
Still, he was reluctant to mention it to John. With the anxiety he still suffered upon leaving the flat, a holiday didn’t seem like a particularly good idea.
By using a rubber bullet on John, she’d ensured that John would get severely injured without him actually dying, knowing it would most certainly –
It had been a hectic couple of weeks – filled with lawyers, divorce papers, disposing of Mary’s things – and John decided to go for Chinese takeaway on his way home from work. He walked to the restaurant around the corner from the surgery just as dusk was setting in and changed the city into a landscape of lights. The pavement glistened and small puddles reflected the streetlamps and neon signs above, their already blurry mirror images distorted by the little raindrops that continued to fall.
Like late December last year, just after Rose had dumped her once more for this idiot, who had apparently, for no reason, decided to take her back after all (although her convenient pregnancy might have had something to do with it, she supposed, bitterly). The very next day, Eurus had found out that something was up with Sherlock Holmes and had heard from Steve, her very useful hacker friend, that Holmes was about to be sent far away under mysterious circumstances.
The lube glistened in the faint light of the bedside lamp as Sherlock switched to counter-clockwise circles and back – obviously enjoying the sensation, seeing as his eyes were sensually half-closed and his breathing was becoming increasingly heavy.
here in order to get close to her. So what’s their plan? And how does it relate to Bob following her around in disguise?”
Sherlock frowned intensely, barely holding it together. He had one of those ridiculous lumps in his throat that he’d forgotten could be real, but he didn’t care. “John, I jumped off that building for
--I know. Don’t worry, it’s on me. :) I thought it would be fun to have a proper fancy date for once. x
, that it summoned the strangest sensation in Sherlock of wanting to be even closer than this. His tongue was already inside John’s mouth, their hands were all over each other, ensuring almost full-body contact and still, it was not enough.
“Oh! Well, I’m sure you’re better at reading people than I am, what with all the unsuitable men I dated in the past years...” Molly bit her lip while her hands were playing with the edge of the photograph she was still holding.
He hurried over to the waiting cab and ordered the driver to get to Oxford train station as fast as was reasonably possible. He might just make the 11:51 to London.
“No! If the raisins don’t actually kill him, he will still suffer greatly,” he shrieked. “They cause kidney failure! Stop feeding them to him!”
And with Sherlock’s caresses grounding him in the present and with him slowly planting soft, unhurried kisses on his brow and temple, before John knew it, he suddenly felt overwhelmed with an unexpected want.
“Is that so?” she sneered. “Interesting, how you pretend to underestimate your own role.” She narrowed her eyes at him. “How about Rose, then? How did she die? Nothing to do with you or this pal of yours either, huh?”
“And you wouldn’t believe it,” he continued, “but right then, he received a text from an old friend, who I thought was dead. Irene Adler. You might have heard of her. She’s a minor celebrity; the scary mad one.”
It was bad enough that the bloody dildo hadn’t arrived the next day as it was supposed to, but the fact that the missed opportunity to practice had made Sherlock so nervous that he had scared John away and ended up alone in 221B that evening, made him feel rather miserable indeed.
John ignored the little voice in his head reminding him the crash statistics of motorcycle riders. He was a doctor; he knew the facts. Yet, he wanted his own bike. The thought of his own bike made him giddy. Yes, they should have this.
“No, it was not. Since you seem to be stuck, perhaps you could better spend your time reading my manuscript.”
John raked his eyes up Sherlock’s body before sucking in a deep breath. When was Sherlock near a bike this much of a turn on for him? He’d seen him near other bikes but nothing like this sex-on-two-wheels.
A bang from the door and Holmes walking to his shed silenced the birds momentarily. Holmes called out, “I’ll be but a moment and we can walk to the shore.”
I fetched my medical bag relieved that he was willing. He watched as I exchanged my black leather gloves for thin rubber gloves. It was standard procedure to wear surgical gloves during an examination to reduce the chance of initiating a bond. A doctor’s purpose in that moment was to heal, not to find a new soul bond.
Sherlock saw miles of green countryside, coastline, and houses. People waved or glared at him as he passed. Dogs tried to chase him only to be stopped by their owner’s leash. It rained and he got soaked. It rained and he smoked while watching the rain from under a bridge. He spent a day by a ruin fixing his bike. He hummed the simple song about the solar system while banking around sharp turns and driving by sheep. Sherlock stopped where he wanted, he took turns on a whim, slept at bike friendly accommodations or the side of the road. Sherlock’s felt himself falling into the same routine, and that was the problem. He needed… something. That feeling took root, and Sherlock grew more restless.
They sat there breathing a bit before they made eye contact. John giggled and Sherlock followed. They stood up and began righting themselves.
John groaned and pressed forward. He felt Sherlock smile under his lips, so he pressed forward, hard, before pulling back. “I came to find you to see if you wanted anything to eat.”
“Then at least consider modifying the plan. If you want to do this thoroughly and test as many possible varieties and radish preparation to find one you might like, it might be better if we plant each week. The radishes will be harvested over time instead of everything at once. That way we can try multiple preparation methods overtime.”
Once the motorcycle was safely off the trailer, the driver handed him the keys from his pocket. Sherlock clutched the warm keys in his hand and gazed in wonder at the bike. It was here.
"Mummy has been talking non-stop about you being home for summer holiday. You could at least do her the courtesy of listening to these inane chatterings and pretend you are interested in the theatre shows she has plans to expose you to. I suggested she take you to Cats."
Watson placed the radish piece on Holmes’ hand and Holmes used the opportunity to brush his hand against his partners. Watson inhaled, “you..” he breathed out.
"If I weren't doing what I'm doing today... I'd be traveling around the world on the back of a motorcycle." Donna Karan
“While this,” he continued and lightly brushed his fingertips closed on the back of my hand, “this would mean that I have plans to take you in my mouth and have my way with you.”
“He is not joining me tonight,” Watson lied. He was expecting Holmes shortly to explain his new case.
“I could have told you that before you spent days toiling on it. He only acted strangely before seeing a doctor about his fear of monkeys - hardly an interesting tale.”
“An admirer of Mr Holmes.” The stranger sat down. He had dark hair and a well-tended moustache. His sharp eyes studied Watson and he refused to squirm.
The pub they selected was busy, but the food was decent and they could find a relatively quiet corner to sit. Holmes ate his cottage pie and peas in silence. Watson decided it was best not to bring up the brief encounter with Mrs Lloyd, and he ate his lamb stew and watched the other guests.
“The society that Mrs Lloyd belongs to made us baskets when we first arrived. House warming gifts is what they called it, or a chance to snoop on their new famous neighbours. The glasses were from Mrs Lloyd. At that time, she did not perfume her letters to you.”
Stilling his hands, Watson caught Holmes’ gaze. “That has not stopped me before.” He returned his attention to the injuries and frowned. “We need to get you back home. Your foot is rather inflamed and will need attention.” He did not mention the more worrying breathing symptoms. He helped Holmes to his feet and began the journey home.
The sugar bowl was where he expected but the pile of mail was not. That scattered over the floor when he retrieved his keys. He did consider grabbing a biscuit before he left, and his stomach grumbled at the thought of food. He ignored it and the mess on the floor.  Being caught now would be worse than being caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
Watson picked up the papers and traced the writing with his finger before looking up at Holmes. It was one thing for Holmes to claim that he would write a case many years ago, and another to be holding the materialized manuscript. “You wrote. One… I mean, you wrote up a case.”
Watson groaned again and tried to change the subject - there were some memories best kept in the past. “I never did thank you for breakfast yesterday. That was nice of you.”
“Not the taste you remember? You have not had a radish in how long that you don’t even remember what it tastes like?”
“Holmes tied up the case quickly and I left on the earliest train.” Watson leaned forward and whispered in his ear. “I missed you.”
“Holmes...” Watson began. Holmes waved him off as he walked towards the chair which had his jacket draped over it.
Tea was exactly the thing needed for this sort of brain work and he had only drunk the lukewarm tea from breakfast.
Filtered light entered through the windows and Watson could make out the Channel and cliff edge ever better as the morning continued to march on.  Violent winds and rain had swept through that night waking him and Holmes throughout the night. They had both woke earlier, electing to stay in bed to try catch a few more moments of sleep but plans changed to more personal activities. Afterwards, Holmes lay on his front, arms wrapped around his pillow, and nightshirt forgotten on floor.
“What? Of course, I’m sure. I just spent... Oh.” Holmes coughed “I would prefer to feed myself to maintain my focus on the task at hand.”
“What I don’t understand Holmes is why were you in the laboratory at that time doing that experiment. You knew we needed to leave at a specific time.”
Watson hesitated and swallowed. “Holmes, it is impersonal. For a manuscript on deductions for strictly teaching purposes, it would be fine; but, for a story to be published in… where?
“Oh, none of that. Now,” Holmes playfully scolded before returned to the mock professorial tone he used before, “what have you observed about the glasses?”
Sherlock froze at the sound and slowly sat up. Casting a look over his shoulder, he scanned over John’s body. John knew he was cataloguing, and he feels exposed in front of that gaze. Emboldened, he made it obvious of the condition he was in. Sherlock gave him a knowing smirk. He slowly turned back around and methodically rubbed the cloth over the chrome of the handlebars.
He waited for the internal panic to burst, but it remained still. Instead, butterflies fluttered in his stomach.
A thud came from the library, followed by the flip of pages, a grumble, and another thud. Watson looked up from his desk and saw the shadow of Holmes picking up another book. Holmes had been at it for most of the morning. He seemed determined to make up for the day he lost resting due to his encounter with the jellyfish and his fit of energy centred in on the library. At first, Watson was happy that Holmes would most likely be inactive and reading in a chair which would let him recover further. As time dragged on, he realized that Holmes was not resting but getting more energetic as he searched through the library.
The twinge of craving twisted in Sherlock’s stomach. He ignored it and got up on his own, wincing as he did. He grabbed the handle bars. The other biker stopped mid puff and assessed him. “How long have you been riding?” He asked while the tantalizing cigarette bounced in his mouth.
The light from the shed reminded him of the colloid solutions he made in his chemistry lab. Sherlock opened the shed door wide noting the dampness on the cool metal handle. He was greeted by that ubiquitous damp shed smell and the scent of petrol. That smell he associated with freedom and adrenaline was enough of an anchor he could grasp to pull him out of his mind.
Watson rested his hand on Holmes’ shoulder and in the dwindling light gazed fondly at the eccentric man he loved. He decided he would not have him any other way, even if it meant being subjected to another radish experiment.
“We have had other cases where an animal was the killer, but I wouldn’t consider some of those animals mundane. Which case did you alter?”
The sales associate raised an eyebrow. Sherlock willed himself not to squirm. "Rubbish. I am an ex-motorbike cop and sell bikes to youngsters for a living. Care to try that again?"
“How did you not eat it? I grew two crops of them last year and added the few that survived with the other pitiful greens.”
Sherlock put down his almost finished toast and pulled a face. “What? I’m not answering that question.”
“You can’t.” Watson’s talent was forming bridges from the visible to the spirit world. Thoughts could be exchanged between worlds, but beings shouldn’t - one could easily lose their way and never come back.
As they stretch during the cool down period, the dark-haired man uses his upper body to go from sitting on the floor to half way up the fabric. The blue fabric contrasts with the black shirt and leotard. He performs some complicated move with his legs, tangling his feet in the silks, and performs a split. John can’t help from watching - he has never seen anything like it before. After another movement from the fabric, the man tumbles forward, head over heal. John’s breath catches and words like “amazing” and “brilliant” pop into his head.
Also, thanks to those who have subscribed and kudo’ed this fic that started as a silly idea and grew.
Arriving at the front door, Watson stomped his feet to dislodge mud and grass. Adding to his annoyance, he realized that he had no free hand to immediately open the door. He shuffled the items in his arms and dropped one of the gloves. At that moment the door opened and he was greeted by Holmes. Holmes was in one of his suits he typically wore when going into town.
Watson roughly stuffed the letter in his waistcoat and took up the hose, not aware of the force he was exerting on the new patch. The patch failed. The tear expanded. A faint spray of water escaped the pressure in the hose and started to wet Watson’s shirt sleeves. With a grumble, Watson tossed the hose down and marched back to the tap to turn off the water.
Holmes tried to supress a grin and moved to the kitchen table. Watson, eyeing his companion, started untying the string and tearing open the brown paper. They did not often give each other gifts and he was curious what was in the box. He opened it and stopped.
Holmes paid the driver as I fumbled for the key with numb fingers. We stumbled through the door and I could feel his eyes on me as we climbed the seventeen steps. Seventeen steps and one door before we were safely hidden away. We carefully removed our great coats and hung them on the pegs in the hall, all the while the tension built filling the minimal space between us and causing me to forget how to breathe. The warmth of our sitting rooms was a welcome embrace, and I had other ideas of how to rid us of the evening’s chill.
John shuts his eyes tights. He breaths in and slowly breathes out, using the technique his therapist had suggested. The ache in his shoulder is minimal and his limp was not as noticeable today. He stretches his arms and shakes out his legs, and breathes out quickly before exiting the room.
“I was thinking, given the success of our current signal, that perhaps additional signals would be appropriate.”
“I’ve just made tea, if you care for some,” Watson said as Holmes dropped a small brown package in front of him. He turned and removed his drenched cloth hat and coat, not before leaving a trail of water droplets on the floor.
“Yes! Knowing the variety name or what it looks like could bias my opinion. I might find the name Long Black Summer to be more appealing than Lady Finger. I could unconsciously be drawn more towards cylindrical radishes compared to spheres.”
In the dim light of our rooms, I could see that the rag Holmes had pressed against his side was red. The wrap around his hand was also stained in red.
“And admire the view?” said Watson as he lowered himself to his knees. He looked up when Holmes made a noncommittal noise. To Watson’s trained eye from years of Holmes-watching, the slight twitch around Holmes’ mouth was all the indication he needed that the man was smirking.
Johns mind immediately flashed a sight of a skin-tight leather trousers clad Sherlock straddling that gorgeous machine. He knew he was smiling like an idiot.
“Still working on the professor case?” said Holmes from the doorway, interrupting Watson’s musings. Watson had not heard the door open.
“Try shipping records? Holmes worked on a case where the murderer was a sailor; the murders were timed with his ship.”
While Mrs Lloyd tapped her lip as she thought, Watson looked over the top of her hat covered head and saw Holmes cross the street heading towards them. Holmes’ gate and how he set his jaw informed Watson that he was not pleased to see Mrs Lloyd.
I groaned. “Sherlock, you wicked man. The one we have works well enough. I like not knowing what to expect until the final moment, when you choose to reveal all mysteries to me or I choose to surprise you.”
Something was off in the arrangement and Holmes carefully adjusted their placement. Watson watched as Holmes chose another black globe from a bowl of cleaned but unorganized radishes and added it to the arrangement. The next one he chose was a cylindrical radish with white decorating the tip and the rest a bright pinky red.
The sales associate tried to get Sherlock to purchase other necessities, and he shrugged him off by spouting out more deductions about his not so vanilla love life. The salesman's expression had become serious. "Young man, we need to talk about safety. I was a motorbike cop for 15 years before retiring. You need protective wear to keep safe."
“Alright,” Greg said, tearing a page out of his notebook, even though the witness recording was still running. “Tell me everything you know.”
In spite of his earlier tense mood, Sherlock was clearly at ease here, leisurely sauntering along the country road lined with flowering grasses and cow parsley buzzing with insect activity, while the branches overhead cast patterns of dancing shadows on the asphalt. He looked relaxed. (And stunningly beautiful.) His remark about beekeeping in Sussex suddenly seemed much less far-fetched.
There was suddenly an awkward silence, in which no sensible course of action would occur to John. Sherlock rolled onto his back and lay staring blankly at the ceiling. John let himself fall onto his back too, trying not to feel ashamed about something he’d done without being fully conscious in the first place and which was not such a shockingly strange thing to do with someone you were already having sex with anyway. Still, he felt stupid and more than a bit embarrassed.
“You know what, on second thought,” she said, “I’ve been thinking about getting a haircut, now that I still can. And I still need to get that incredibly cute bonnet for the christening, that I saw advertised at Debenhams.”
“Oh, very good. I’ll probably catch up later, but thanks.” He smiled. “We’re all so very grateful to you for having cleared up the truth, Sherlock. And I feel…” He swallowed visibly. “I have unforgivably failed by not realising that there was another way in which the facts could be interpreted. And that his IQ was in fact much higher than the diagnosis said. Mummy and Daddy feel awful about it, too. They probably won’t thank you explicitly for what you did, but they do appreciate it enormously, I guarantee you.”
John looked very much uncomfortable and stepped towards Sherlock, saying his name, as if asking what was going on.
Sherrinford must have been creating theories as to why he didn’t get to see his parents anymore, why he was sent away in the first place, perhaps? In which case, he must have had no idea what he’d done wrong, why he was put away.
The next hour passed with the two of them being treated to the club’s rendition of Lady Gaga’s ‘Poker Face’ and Sherlock quietly deducing the crap out of everyone in the room from their plastic chairs in the audience. He ended up with a couple of clues that needed following up on, for which he gladly used the coffee and tea break.
There was Mycroft, in his three-piece suit, pensively sitting in Sherlock’s chair, hands folded over the handle of his expensive umbrella. “Have you come to get his toothbrush and pyjamas?” Mycroft said, humourlessly.
was why he loved this man. Because only to John would he show himself so utterly vulnerable, all thanks to this inexplicable magic bond they had, from which stronger feelings inevitably had started to evolve. On both sides, as it now appeared.
“Yeah, well, either way, that doesn’t make a lot of difference for the point I was trying to make, does it?”
Holmes looked very drowsy, which was a pity. But nevertheless, this was – without any doubt – going to be the best confession session he’d ever had. Telling the great detective all about his hobby, without him being able to remember a single thing afterwards. This felt almost as good as doing it.
“Oh, I’m, er, fine! I’ve just got some, well, potentially bad news, although I’m not really sure. Um. I just thought I should talk to you about it.”
That was it, folks! Thank you so much for coming along on this looong ride, and for the encouraging words and comments I received along the way! (Please do keep them coming, even now that the story is finished! ;) )
Those kisses. God. They had still been relatively chaste, but Sherlock couldn’t help but smile like an idiot in the complete dark of his bedroom, thinking back about them. The last person he had kissed had been Janine and that had all been an act, of course. He couldn’t even actually
Of course, after this reward, she started using her name more often to get what she wanted. Each time, there was a cheeky twinkle in her eyes, as she pointed at her rattle, her teddy, or the pretty coasters at the restaurant. “Lowey! Lowey!”
their work, John kept having to remind himself), the Work also managed to permeate their sex life in, well, interesting ways.
, and he would simply wake up in one or two days, once the swelling in his brain had subsided, and everything would go back to the way it had been.
They hadn’t worked together on a case for quite a while and John could tell that the prospect ignited a little spark in Sherlock, as it did in himself.
“Yes, she did help out nicely. Those were almost palatable, but I wouldn’t make a habit of eating them.”
He had never really been in a motorcycle shop before. Why else would he need to be here as he did not own a bike nor anyone in his family, minus Uncle Rudy, owned own. Sports bikes of every obnoxious look-at-me colour were lined up in perfect rows. He could not see the appeal of sport bikes. How did one sit hunched over for hours? How could that be comfortable?
Holmes bent down to pick up the glove on the doorstep. “Ah, Watson, there you are. I was hoping to discuss what you need in town...”
Holmes grumbled and changed direction towards the shore and the crashing waves. Watson stayed by the clumps of sea kale and watched him. There was almost something boyish of Holmes walking near the shore at low tide carrying his shoes, trousers rolled up, and the water trying to lap at his ankles. The breeze ruffled the remains of his grey hair, giving him an unkempt and soft look. Holmes stopped and squatted by what looked like a flat, smooth rock on the shore. Watson could just make out Holmes reaching to touch it and immediately he let out a cry of pain followed by an oath. Holmes stumbled and let out another cry before buckling to one knee.
Watson could see strand-like red marks forming and gently prodded the injury. Holmes hissed in response saying, “You would have been hurt.”
Holmes softly groaned and begrudgingly opened the one eye visible to Watson. “If I answer, will you let me sleep?”
“And you have done that completely. There are large sections of expose and the regurgitation of facts is similar to your other-“

The walk to the cottage was a blur. In the cottage, Watson gently deposited Holmes on the couch and gave him strict instructions not to move. He immediately retrieved his bag from upstairs, followed by a blanket and pillow from another room. Before descending, he reminded himself to keep calm. He breathed in and out slowly and repeated the breaths before tending to Holmes again.
“A fact I am well aware of, but I have no desire to rush into personally engaging in this experiment.”
I reached my destination and breathed in the odour trapped in the black curly hairs surrounding his prick. I slicked my finger before my mouth descended to his prick and my finger traced his entrance. He shifted his leg and gave me better access and my other hand held his hips still. I teased and slipped a finger in slowly breaching him causing him to give a muffled groan. I looked up to see his arm draped over his mouth. I pressed my finger in further and wait for the muscles to adjust to my presence before returned my mouth to his prick. I was surrounded - I in him, and he in my mouth – and it was perfect.
Watson yawned as he followed footsteps through the fallen morning dew. He wondered how long it would take Holmes to trod down the grass between their cottage and the shed housing the beekeeping and gardening tools. Approaching the shed, Watson saw the weathered wooden door open and Holmes energetically emerge carried two pairs of forks and hoes.
“Hey,” he said lifting his hands in the surrender pose. “I’m not the one who cocked-up their bike.” The rider dropped his hand with the smouldering cigarette and sighed. “Are you going to continue to be a knob, or are you going to ask for help get your bike out of the ditch?”
Gorgeous, sexy, marvellous, ravishing – ok, he was getting a bit carried away with adjectives. That new bike with a massive 1600 cc V-twin engine was his.
His eyes grew mischievous. “John, you are missing the details. The slow sensation of how my hand moved across you.” He shifted and raised his hand up, then stroked it down my chest and brushed my nipple, which caused an undignified whimper to escape my throat.
Watson left the cottage carrying seed packets in one hand and the garden diary in the other. In the garden diary, Watson had copied their plans for the plot. The detailed plan was perhaps a little excessive considering it was just for radishes, but he would still follow it.
“My plan? My plan is to retire here.” Holmes stood by Watson and lifted his face. Watson yielded and brought his face up to Holmes’ searching gaze. Holmes then adding softly, “With you, if you will continue to have me.”
Sherlock hummed and turned to face away from the door. “Sleepy." He kept to simple answers; he did not want to encourage her by arguing or talking.
“Ok, fine. Yes. I’ll start. Mine is tornadoes. Not the little ones we have here, but the massive ones they get in the US. I’d watch specials of them on TV.”
Perhaps Holmes’ sudden desire to be far away from me was because he sensed it too. He was a private man and we had not discussed our opinions on bonding. He might be one of the minority who did not wish to bond.
The man set his jaw and glared. "So, you're an asshole. God, Lestrade would have loved to interrogate your sorry ass. That still does not tell me your age."
“Yes, and I have written it in the proper way,” said Holmes. He cleared his throat and used a tone he usually reserved for outlining the finer details of a case. “I have created a scientific exercise that instructs the reader in the fine points of deductive reasoning. You do recall that I have recommended you adapt your stories in this way?”
Mummy was convinced he had a subdermal hematoma. Sherlock was convinced she’d give him one. How could he be suffering when his mind was a whirl of planning and calculating. He was also not thinking about the note with the address even though his route to escape just happened to bring him close to that group during the time and place indicated. That was purely coincidence.
Mrs Lloyd, who was beginning to look worried, beamed, “Thank you both. Dr Watson, I knew I could count on you. I will have those recipes for you and a scone when I see you at the plant sale.” Mrs Lloyd looked up at Watson and sighed meaningfully before excusing herself. Holmes shot Watson a glance and Watson bit the inside of his lip to try to hide his amusement.
“You know I will most likely not change,” Holmes said. “I will still be as unsociable and untidy as ever.”
Watson found this all hateful. He mentally swore coarse oaths at the dove. He considered burning the windchime to silence the racket. Groaning and rolling over, he tossed the blankets over his head and willed the sun to go away. That led to over-heating and he tore back the covers in despair.
They turned to watch the night sky outside their window. Watson asked in a quiet voice, “Have you only been thinking about the manuscript?”
Bringing the tea things to the sink, Watson started washing them. Through the window over the sink, he watched the steady downpour soak the grasses on the Downs and a gull battling the wind gusts. The rain showed no sign of letting up and he resigned himself to staying in doors for the evening. Tea things washed, he shovelled more coal on the fire to drive away the drafts. He settled down at his desk intent on reviewing the plan Holmes drew up.
“That is not where I planned to put them,” Watson said punctuating the statement with a stab into the earth.
“If we do it your way and nothing catastrophic happens to the crop, I would prefer not to waste the excess."
“Sherlock. He’s the instructor for the upper level students. Only works with those he hand-picks. An absolute pain in the ass to work with, but he’s brilliant and his form is perfect. His speciality is aerial silks. He creates these beautiful and complicated routines.” They both watch Sherlock climb the silk in a move that makes him look like he’s climbing upside down as he performs split after split. “My girlfriend says it’s an honour to work with him, if you can stand his personality.”
As I worked him open with my fingers, he panted and writhed. I knew he was close to the edge. Slowly removing my mouth from his prick, I sat up and found the pot again. After slicking my prick, my hand lined up my prick to his entrance, and I slowly slid into the tight, wet heat of him. Buried deeply, I stopped, giving him time to adjust.
“If we harvest all at once I can be done with this experiment instead of dragging it out. If something happens to that crop, then so much the better.”
“I can.” Holmes bent and set the glass at the edge of the radish bed to be forever lost among the leaves.
When the door opened again, Watson immediately started explaining. “Holmes, look at this section here, it…” He stopped when Holmes deposited a letter in front of him. Watson set down the manuscript and picked up the letter. The letter was thick and smelled heavily of roses. Holmes reached over, picked up the manuscript, and silently departed upstairs. Watson watched him leave and then looked at the letter. He deciphered from the exaggerated looping writing a name: Mrs Lloyd.
Watson brushed by him without acknowledging the glove Holmes was offering him, and carefully set the glasses in the sink.
“Class, now grab onto the bottom of your hoop with your two hands like this,” the instructor says while demonstrating. “When I tell you, lift your legs.”
Through the entire class, John keeps sneaking glances back to the man to see what he’s doing. He sees the dark-haired man stretching his back and legs. He wonders who the man is. He wonders what he is doing here. He wonders if Greg knows. He wonders if the man is single. He quickly stops his train of thought and returns his attention to his instructor.
The wound required stitching, and I needed to retrieve my supplies from my bag. The sensation decreased when I moved away from Holmes to prepare the needle and thread. I wondered if what I felt was real.
“Yes, I hadn’t forgotten those. I’m still in awe at how Mrs Glydon roasted radishes to the preciseness that you required and repeat it with different seasoning.”
“Well Watson, as I am unlikely to convince you otherwise when your mind is set upon an action, I will submit to your experienced care.”
“Most likely. It might alter the results. Reproducibility is one of the central foundations in scientific testing.”
Watson pressed his lips together. He tried to keep the disappointment out of his voice as he said, “Are you sure?”
He sat on his couch and injected. As the drug took hold of his system, his mind was blissfully blank, and he was floating somewhere. Where was he again? It didn’t matter.
Stamford was to blame for this. They had randomly bumped into each other when John first came back to London. After getting coffee and catching up, Stamford had convinced John to come to trivia night at the pub. The topics were 90s pop culture and medicine – two topics he had excellent working knowledge. At the time, John thought it was fortunate that they did not include pop culture from the 2000 because he would have been clueless as he spent most of that time in the library studying away for his medical degree or serving in the army.
Concealed in the darkness during the latter half of the concert, his hand had found mine. He touched my hand and lightly traced the sensitive flesh between my index finger and thumb. I hid my shudder at the touch, but the sensation ignited my nerves and muddled my focus for the remainder of the concert. Those fingers, that signal, stoked the want, the glowing embers of earlier. I was a tortured soul, trapped in the societal strings of a proper English gentleman, that desperately wanted to escape the disapproving eyes of those around and seek refuge in our world behind locked doors.
Sherlock started switching off the lights and headed for the bedroom. John put the plates in the sink and followed.
Sherlock shook his head and pressed the sides of his thumbs to his eyes as he screwed them shut. He flailed wildly, groaning and opening his eyes wide. As Smith’s manic cackling continued, Sherlock buried his head in his hands, then turned away from him, bumping into a tray on a stand. The tray rattled noisily and he pretended to flinch away, focusing briefly on the row of six scalpels lying on it.
John had seen real regret in his eyes, then. He’d sensed it was there before, but hidden away, covered up behind a façade of coolness. Not like this, in a candid and open gaze that seemed to leave Sherlock’s soul bare, completely vulnerable.
John nodded, briefly cupping Sherlock’s jaw with his hand in a soft caress. “I will. But I’m sure you’ll be fine. Now stop loitering and make love to me. Please. This is long overdue.”
The earl looked positively perplexed. “I gave that handkerchief to Rose almost thirty years ago. Before she broke my heart and told me we’d better stop seeing each other.”
John was patiently studying his face, Sherlock noticed from the corner of his eye. “Should I go ask Irene for some help?” John suggested.
come across as annoyingly content. Mycroft had stupidly assumed that had been because of the rather major case he had just solved – though that had been more than two days prior; he should have known that effect would have long faded.
“I trust your instincts,” John simply said. “Shall we get our coats and take the tube to Paddington train station?”
A group of seagulls suddenly landed in front of them, loudly disagreeing on something, before disappearing in different directions.
He and John had been so close for the past eight months: ever since last autumn, when the woman John had married had turned out to be an assassin. Everything they’d done, every step they’d taken – together – had, however, culminated in the unplanned and undesirable death of their suspect, Rosamund Moran. An anti-climax covered in lies, with John’s poor Aunt Vivian now voluntarily behind bars and Sherlock and John having to act estranged.
As he processed this information, Sherlock could feel his cheeks redden. So if this was normal, was that not a bad thing, then? When he thought of ‘normal’ people and their ‘normal’ relationships, their love seemed of hardly any importance compared to what he thought he shared with John. Surely he and John were not
Sherlock opened his eyes to see John fondly looking down at him. His mind was racing to make up some sort of excuse, until he realised he didn’t need one. “You,” he said.
Sherrinford and he sat in silence, stirring their teas, while Sherlock asked himself what had been the point in coming here.
He and John remained on their bench, smiling at one another, as Chloe played with Sherlock’s coat buttons.
With a sigh, Eurus sank down onto the little stool in their bathroom. For all that they’d found out, Sherlock Holmes had turned out to be
While John continued nuzzling Sherlock’s neck, he slowly began to move his hips, subtly grinding them down onto Sherlock. He was not pushing, not asking anything, just languidly moving like the surf of the sea. It made Sherlock feel desired in a way he never had before. After a minute, he tentatively bucked back up against him, softly gasping at the sensation. This apparently encouraged John to grind down harder and the noises he was now making indicated he was slowly becoming desperate for more. His brows were furrowed and there was a tension in his muscles that betrayed the fact that he was struggling to remain in charge of his own body.
John looked at Sherlock hesitantly for an instant, as if collecting himself, then deliberately reached for the top button of Sherlock’s shirt and started unbuttoning it, slowly and carefully. His eyes flashed between Sherlock’s and the place where he was about to see newly exposed skin behind each button. When his eyes fell on the little circle that his ex-wife’s bullet had left, he briefly looked up at Sherlock with a blank stare that hid the depth of emotion beneath it.
“So…,” Eurus said, suddenly pretend-casual again, “now you’ve finally remembered me. At last I’ve got your
If he was completely honest, he would want nothing more than for the two of them to move in with Sherlock, as ridiculous and unorthodox as it might sound. Whether that was a good idea, let alone whether Sherlock would even want such a thing, was another matter altogether.
Sherlock gave his first blowjob – which only lasted two minutes, because John practically came the instant Sherlock touched him with his tongue, and climaxed for real as soon as he used all of his mouth and applied the lightest of suction.
) turned away from him and started to vigorously rinse a glass tube in the sink, which apparently needed to be done urgently.
The bath indeed turned out to be a welcome diversion after all the questions, forms and witness statements they had to deal with over the following couple of days.
He was definitely enjoying this, alternately smiling and looking away. “No.” He actually did look kind of cute when he was embarrassed, in an adorable-baby-animal kind of way.
When Sherlock opens his eyes a crack and looks at him from the corner of his eye, John’s heart skips a beat. With bated breath, he waits for Sherlock to tell him to bugger off and get away from him – but he doesn’t. In this complete silence, during which John contemplates the consequences of Sherlock pushing him away, he realises that not ever being allowed to touch him again might actually be preferable to Sherlock expecting the two of them to simply give each other meaningless blowjobs every now and then from now on. The thought breaks his heart, making him recognise how deep in he is.
John smiled. “That’s exactly how I remember you from when I was little. Always seeing the glass half full, even if it was merely a little wet on the inside.” He leaned forward in his chair. “But how are you feeling physically? Have you seen a doctor yet, here? Are you getting the medication that you need?”
“He’s in hospital. He’ll be fine,” John said. (Never mind there was a serial killer on the loose that he had provoked beyond imagination. And never mind Molly saying that he had only weeks to live in the first place – with the quantity of substance abuse he’d indulged in – unless he kicked his drugs habit. Which he would, surely. Now that he was in hospital, he had no choice.)
Sherlock slowly rubbed soothing circles over John’s back, until John lifted his head and took in a long breath. “I guess that, because we are like a proper family now, living here at 221B with the three of us,” John said, “with the same sort of homeliness that I always used to associate with her, I guess… well, I guess I wanted to honour her by making her recipe. By doing the thing she always used to do on special days, like Christmas.” John smiled despite the wetness of his eyes. “By baking her own bread, she would fill the whole house with its wonderful smell: the smell of home, of safety. I’m finally home again, Sherlock.”
Sherlock considered continuing his research by means of shouting John’s name, but decided against it. If he felt well enough for shouting, he was probably well enough to get out of bed and find John himself. That approach was, after all, less likely to make John cross, and hence, the preferable course of action.
He chuckled to himself, cheeks heating, then languidly took another sip of tea, continuing to scroll the Twitter feed.
“But before that, nothing? How about you, then? Your room was also on that side of the house. You didn’t hear a fight, or my screams?”
Sherlock smiled at Bob without replying. Then, as he started to turn away, he said, “I will leave you two to enjoy the rest of your evening now. Order what you like, by the way; it’s on the house. Good-bye.”
The next moment, he was as lost as Alice had been in Wonderland upon reaching the bottom of the rabbit hole. He found himself in a corridor with lots of doors, all similar-looking and none giving any clues as to where the builder had disappeared to. But knowing that he’d entered not only the house, but also one of the rooms, was enough of a good catch as far as today’s quest for intelligence went, anyway. So when Sherlock heard a lady's footsteps approaching around the bend at the far end of the corridor, he decided he wasn’t going to risk getting caught trespassing in this disguise and silently left the way he’d come: out of the door, and off the premises onto the sun-drenched country road, back into civilisation – facts spinning through his head and slowly coalescing into preliminary theories.
reach and no one else’s), that Rose had decided she could afford to take things more slowly for a while. She’d travelled to the UK for the first time in her life and had coincidentally wandered into Jim’s circles.
Sherlock’s eyes turned towards John and he smiled slightly. John was sure Sherlock could tell that John was now unconditionally on board with whatever plan Sherlock had in mind. This man, if he was anything close to what he seemed to be, needed to be brought down.
“Hmm. Was there anything, anything at all, that seemed odd or unexplainable in the context of things?”
Sherlock stared wide-eyed at the scalpel in his shaking hand. Smith and Faith continued to make noises of concern while John shook his head anxiously, his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock stumbled back, glaring savagely at Smith and pointing his left hand at him. “Stop laughing at me,” he hissed.
It was a strange sort of activity, awkward in many ways, but he’d decided he liked the result. He’d already begun improving his technique during a second round this morning, with satisfactory enough outcome.
Sherlock swallowed repeatedly, starting to see things in a very new light. He, in turn, explained to Mycroft how he had always felt inadequate and stupid as a child, how he’d resented constantly being lectured by his own brother and how he’d felt that he was hardly allowed to have any fun in an age-appropriate way. “Not by you, but even less by Mummy and Daddy, who never seemed to accept the fact that children aren’t adults. That little kids need to be able to play, make mistakes and still be supported, and sometimes even comforted, when they do.” Sherlock heaved in a long breath.
Smith’s smile turned to a look of alarm as he backed away, keeping his hands in the air. “Whoa, whoa, whoa!”
Just then, Sherlock spotted the two of them coming in. The waiter seated them at a table near the window, directly in Sherlock's line of view, as had been pre-arranged.
feel guilty. Guilty for not knowing, which was technically hardly my fault, I suppose, and neither was it yours for not wanting to tell me, which was perfectly understandable. You had no obligation to tell me, and I don’t blame you for not telling me earlier. So I’ll just have to find a way to get rid of my guilt and you’ll have to find a way to get rid of your lack of self-esteem.”
John had to look twice at the person approaching them through the middle aisle: he passed as well as a woman as Sherlock did. “I was wondering if you were still taking new members,” Sherlock said with a radiant smile. John thought he actually saw a hint of admiration flicker across the other man’s face at Sherlock’s voice confirming that he was, in fact, a man. “For
Sometimes, when Mary had actually been around, she had demanded to tag along with Sherlock and John, and it had taken them superhuman effort to get her off their tails without either offending her or arousing her suspicion – Mary being the manipulative, clever snake that she was.
(What if his diagnosis was wrong and there was something awry with his vertebrae as well? He couldn’t risk changing anything about John’s position and causing him even more harm.)
He was seated behind a long table, together with the director and two other members of the Creative Team. He sat with his legs crossed, letting one shoe dangle from the ball of his foot, so that at least one of his heels was in less pain.
“But er... ever since I moved back in with you, or actually, it might even have been long before that, maybe even since we started living together in the first place – anyway...”
His debit card unlocked the front door on his first try and he swiftly slipped inside, his ears pricked, his blood ice cold.
“What a clever little girl,” Mrs Holmes said, delighted. “It’s just marvellous, isn’t it, how fast these youngsters learn?”
“… and can cost you your job,” John finished the sentence for him. “Christ, Greg. Maybe I should just--”
“Well, I don’t think killing me in the literal sense was really the idea,” Sherlock said. The second he had spoken, though, he looked as if he wished he hadn’t. “Anyway,” he quickly continued, although he was still speaking noticeably slower because of his chest wound, and wincing every so often, “back when I was trying to find Moran, he simply seemed to have vanished from the earth. So eventually, I just presumed he was dead, because I didn’t think he’d be able to lie low for that long. I did keep my eyes open, or so I thought, while chasing down and eliminating the rest of Moriarty’s network, but nothing on the radar conformed to the pattern of the most wanted sniper. Moran just seemed to be… gone.”
Crikey, what a way to find out that he and John were an actual item after all. If they hadn’t kept it a bloody secret, he wouldn’t have just bloody barged in on them like that, would he, now?
Reporters holding notebooks gathered around them, as the monster, chuckling, reached out and hugged him.
John was just getting them both a coffee, as it turned out. His future husband, taking care of so many of his needs. Sherlock stared, love-struck, as John came walking back towards him carrying two paper cups.
John definitely did have something to blame Sherlock for. Perhaps that was why that additional lie had come so naturally.
Sherlock thought that John’s throat was probably suddenly too tight, in the same way that had made his own voice sound so unnatural just now.
John hovered the mouse pointer over the little cross in the upper right corner. Just as he hadn’t been able to write anything truthful about those missions, he now couldn’t very well write about nappies and baby food on his public blog, could he? It was supposed to be about outlandish crimes, exciting adventures and brilliant deductions.
The training had been hard, but not as hard as some of the things she’d had to do before in her life. Especially not with Briony there, a fellow agent and single mother of a baby daughter who she soon became very close with.
Without breaking eye contact, Sherlock let himself drop back onto the bed, so John could remove his underwear altogether from his legs. John then stepped out of his and crawled over Sherlock, one foot still on the floor. His cock was oddly hovering in mid-air somewhere above Sherlock’s crotch.
why you told her about us!” John fondly rolled his eyes and shook his head. “But hang on, I thought you said she was in California?”
“I’m so sorry I haven’t popped round sooner,” she said. “I’ve just been crazy busy with my new job.”
“Well, it started about three weeks ago, or at least that’s when I started noticing, anyway.” She took a deliberate breath. “At random moments of the day, whenever I’m walking somewhere – and I go by foot quite often – this bloke in a hoodie is following me. Every time I turn around to look at him, he pretends not to see me and turns away, studying a shop window or suddenly looking down at his phone. He’s there half the time I go out, whether it is to work, to the supermarket, to yoga class, or off to have lunch with a friend. It’s creepy.”
Sherlock’s brain was in full overdrive, like an internet browser with too many tabs open. He pressed his fingers against his temples.
Sherlock went still and leaned in to press a soft kiss to the star-shaped scar tissue on John’s shoulder, trying hard not to think of what could have happened if John's unit hadn’t managed to get him back to the base in time and he had been left to bleed for longer.
At Oxford train station, Sherlock found himself in a chaotic throng of stranded train passengers. Due to damaged overhead lines, there were no trains running eastwards, an announcement over the speakers informed him. It would take several hours for the situation to be resolved.
The only movements were those of John’s chest still subtly heaving from exertion and Sherlock’s eyelids blinking rather stupidly indeed – and making him look even less like the genius Greg had come here to see.
“They are award winning,” she said and gave Watson a wink. “How did you manage to not try them? You were at the plant sale last year.”
“To forever put me off radishes. I did like them, I just don’t want to eat another in a very long time.”
I needed to finish my stitching quickly. I suddenly realized that I had not examined his hand. I was sure there was glass embedded in his palm. I inwardly groaned; pressing palms together was typically how bonds were started, not this... situation. Maybe I could work using tweezers and have him hold his hand.
Holmes smirked and added playfully, “I wouldn’t want to distract myself.” Holmes shifted to a more academic mien and took a bite of the radish and immediately grimaced. He slowly chewed and swallowed. “Well, that one is dreadful and tastes of dirt.”
Greg whistles. “And you still decided to try it. Good for you mate. I started because the girl I’m interested in works here part-time. You know, it was a way to hang with her more and show her I’m interested in whatever she’s interested in. That sort of stuff.”
He felt around for Holmes and found that he was alone in the bed. Which was likely for the best, because he was in a murderous mood.
“That is what I remember. Perhaps my tastes will change, or new varieties will be available next year. Who knows what next year will bring.”
Sherlock huffed, and proceeded to deduce the man's terrible marriage status from his impersonal family pictures, his lunch from the stain on his horrible blue gingham shirt, and the accident that caused him to leave the force.
His moved his good hand to mine and I was hit with a shiver that went through my body and settled the ache in my gut. Holmes let out a gasp and I could see how much this affected him. We hovered our uncovered hands mere inches from each other.
“I would be impressed if you did - you were quite inebriated at the time. This was after a card game that not even I could deduce the rules. Loudly telling stories of our less famous and more embarrassing cases. Of the green stockings and-“
After double and triple checking that the gate was closed and shut properly, he walked through the damp grass to the shed. The light walk and fresh air were starting to clear his head and his stomach protested very little. He was marginally better able to appreciate his surroundings as he entered the shed. Empty wooden frames were stacked in a corner and jars were stacked on a work bench. He looked at his companion’s clutter, which had an organizational system of their own, with fondness until he saw three drinking glasses sitting in front of the jars near the edge of the work bench, as well as some gloves he had misplaced. He pressed his lips together and roughly gathered up the glasses and the gloves. His headache slammed back in full force and he marched back to the cottage.
Stiff from his vigil, Watson shifted in the chair and, to feel like he was doing something, nudged his chair closer to where Holmes was laying on the couch. He was waiting for Holmes to wake up and show signs that he was through the worst of this reaction. He held Holmes’ hand and rubbed his thumb over the hand. He took note of a healing scratch between his forefinger and thumb that Holmes had gotten it tending a hive frame days ago.
Holmes poured his tea and he said, “I would think that any respectable gardener would recognize seed packets.”
He flushed slightly. “That is part of the appeal, but then we couldn’t have coded discussions about what awaits us when we get home.”
Holmes returned and pressed a glass of water in Watson’s hand and stood surveying their work. The sun was suddenly covered by a cloud and a cool breeze caused Watson to shiver briefly.
John loved the feeling of Sherlock’s weight in his mouth. He stroked the underside with his tongue as he bobbed his head. John pulled back to the tip and swirled his tongue under the foreskin. He savoured the taste and feeling before pulling Sherlock’s length further down. He heard Sherlock’s appreciation as he moaned out John’s name. He breathed in hard from his nose and caught the musty scent of arousal.
Further down the shore from where Stackhurst was swimming, Holmes and Watson were sitting on a bench that was sheltered from the breeze by a bush. If you did not know the spot was there, it would have been easy to overlook.
Tea had worked its wonders and by the late afternoon Watson’s headache was more manageable. He rested on the couch after tea and took another dose of headache powder. Beginning to feel the need to move, he glanced out of the window and noted the puffy clouds rolling in. Their brilliant white told him that they would not rain on him if he went outside but would provide intermittent shade.
Holmes stood to the right of Watson, arms akimbo, looking distrustfully at the sprout. “I see no reason to rush things.”
Holmes squeezes his hand. “Nothing of the sort. I will need to do some extensive changes to add some of your suggestions and include Stackhurst.”
Sherlock caught movement out of the corner of his eye and saw Mummy open the door with a look of pure shock. He twisted the handle and the engine roared, blocking any sound of admonishment from her. He could still read her angry lips and knew she was using his full name and something like “What do you think you’re doing?” Sherlock revved the engine again. She would have words with him, and he tried to drum up any level of care.
Holmes was intensely focused on the open book in his hands, his fingers tracking over the words in the page. He was still dressed in his nightshirt and one of his lighter dressing gowns was wrapped around him. Watson was thankful that their housekeeper was unable to come today and she was spared further scandal. Although this time, the bohemian habit was out of necessity to reduce the irritation on the injuries that trousers would cause.
The tinkling of a small bell greeted him as his nose took in the smell of rubber, petrol, and oil. He kept by the front window making a show of his attention on the yellow sports bike knowing full well that the cameras could still see him. He took in the perfectly buffed plastic siding that was formed to make the bike look like it was moving. He didn’t notice the large shape walking up behind him until it spoke.
“Very good. To the first sample.” Holmes rubbed his hands together expectantly before lifted his hand palms up expectantly.
Sherlock’s thoughts were disrupted, and he was pulled to the present by a voice. Mummy was asking him a question. No, Mummy was informing him. When had she come in?
The moonlight illuminated the monotone landscape in shades of grey and even darker grey. The night seemed to amplify the crash of the Channel waters on the shore. He could barely make out the twit-twoo of an owl. Perhaps it was distant, but his hearing and the night was playing havoc with his ability to say anything with certainty.
They worked a little longer until it was mutually decided that a break was in order and they returned to the house. Holmes went inside. Watson collapsed on an outside chair and wondered when he allowed himself to be slowed down this much.
She stalked down the path with a fire in her eyes fully directed at him. That fire shifted when she caught sight of cigarette ends in her flower pot. She immediately turned on Mycroft who had just lit up another cigarette. Sherlock sniggered as Mummy gesticulates angrily at Mycroft and snatched the cigarette out of his mouth.
“Oh, Sherlock.” The hurts and worry bleeding through Mycroft’s usually careful speech. “This is not the substitute for the bike I hoped you’d take. Anything. Even that motorcycle. Anything but this.”
Holmes rolled over to his side capturing Watson’s hand under his arm. He looked over at Watson. “Some time ago.”
"Of course, but I realized I could still build a fence around it with the left-over materials. This garden will be devoted to the Least Awful Radish Experiment. If you follow my plans exactly, all of the varieties should fit."
“If you feel that it is needed, then yes.” Holmes continued. “I have taken the liberty of removing the romantic nonsense and have stuck to more rational thoughts and reasoning. In the case, I made active use of my brain attic to recall an obscure piece of information that was critical to solving the identity of the murderer. I’ve focused on facts and the steps I used in stringing them together in a chain of logic and reasoning. My deductive methods which are used to narrow down the potential candidates are emphasized and explained. It’s all in the manuscript, and I do not wish to, say, spoil the ending by telling you it now.”
Not wanting the letters to get damp, Watson tucked them under his jacket and into his waistcoat as he walked back through the drizzling rain. He took another path around the other side of the cottage and jumped into a defensive position when a brown streak sprang down the path before freezing in front of a bush. Watson and the rabbit stood motionless, staring eachother down. The rabbit kept its ears pointed at Watson; its body coiled and ready to leap away if the human drew too close. Watson breathed out slowly and flexed his hands, reminding himself that it was only rabbit.
He nodded. “I did not expect to find anyone who was tolerant and a complement to me. I had better things to do then search for a compatible soul bond. “he smiled at me. “And to think that it found me.”
John hums and continues stretching. Watching Sherlock tumble down the silks only to stop feet above the ground solidifies John’s opinion that he will be coming back to his next class.
Watson sat with his mouth agape as Holmes left the cottage and shut the door roughly behind him. He looked up at the ceiling and breathed in deeply. This was not going as he had hoped. Maybe showing Holmes an example of what he was trying to explain might help. He opened the manuscript and quickly scanned through the text.
After taking a sip, Holmes spoke. “You will not recall the original case because it was shortly after your marriage. It was before the business with the Red-headed league. I had not bothered recounting it to you.”
Watson looked back and the crow took off and few over a farmer’s wheat field. “I expect her resignation when we return.”
Watson smiled as it confirmed his theory. “Is there any other vegetable that should join the radishes?”
Basil glanced at the timepiece. “They will strike in three hours. Come Dawson! I know exactly where they will be: the hottest location of the city.”
Before the term's assessments, the tiresome guy he had slept with last weekend had mentioned magnetism. Tried to describe it too as some indescribable pull towards another human. Sherlock has not felt that for the man.
Holmes was carrying a drinking glass down to his shed and Watson updated his mental tally of glasses he would need to retrieve. He sighed and smiled; planting was proceeding smoothly and all was going well.
The flavours were like an explosion across Watson’s tongue and he groaned silently in approval. It had been an understatement when Holmes had told him these oysters were good. He picked up another and thoughtfully chewed it as he scanned the other respectable patrons in the candle lit restaurant.
“But it will not succeed,” Watson had said while he dusted off the soil from his knees and behind. He picked up the offending weed and began shaking off the dirt into the garden. “I will need to be more vigilant. The younger weeds are easier to pull and aren’t the source of so many problems.”
Startled, Sherlock quickly sucked in a breath. “I thought I deleted it.  Well, most of it. I miss filed... this bike. It was a distraction. A big sticking it to Mycroft.” With a sudden movement, Sherlock dropped the canvas and twirled in place. “It should be here.”
Watson blinked and took the letter.  He said mechanically, “I was distracted. Forgot to reply. Has it really been weeks since her previous invitation?”
The door opened and startled Lestrade. Watson was home early. Lestrade was sure he was smiling like a loon and decided he did not care to hide it - his partner was back home. “John, you’re back. Was the case a success?”
New book in hand and moments to spare before he was expected, Watson headed out. He walked in the direction of the red roof of Saint Mary’s. The bells in the clock tower signalled the hour just as he was approaching the path to the church’s entrance.  A group of ladies in brightly coloured dresses and hats were walking down the path, voices chattering away excitedly. In the centre of the group, Watson spotted Mrs Lloyd. Like her fellow companions, her hat was adorned with a cheerful display of flowers which matched her disposition well. She appeared to be a little older than most of her companions, and Watson regrettably remembered that she was slightly younger than his sixty plus year-old self.
Sherlock made no acknowledgement of John’s question. Curious, John stepped near the back of the bike. Sherlock’s eyes were closed tight in concentration. John knew his expressions meant he was rapidly searching through his mind palace. The fluttering of Sherlock’s eyelashes and the look of desperation suddenly increased, and his breathing rate accelerated. These were not normal behaviors for Sherlock and John became concerned.
Early morning sun caught in the droplets of water adorning each point on the radish leaves. The glittering caught Watson’s eye as he walked through his garden taking note of what needed to be weeded or trained to grow up a trellis. He made sure his fence was not breached by the rabbit family that lived nearby before stepping through the gate.
The plans were minimal. Lines inside a box were a good beginning, but he preferred a slightly more detailed plan and one that was much more thought out.
“What?” Holmes crinkled his forehead briefly before immediately waving his hand to dismiss it. “No, nothing of that sort. Here.” He thrust the book in Watson’s hand tapping on page filled with illustrations of jellyfish. Their orange and brown tentacles swirled around the page and the illustrator had taken great care to depict the delicate nature of these creatures - they looked disarmingly beautiful.
The sun had set and Watson settled in on the settee with a novel. He heard scratching of a chair against floorboard and the distinct creaking of another occupant moving about upstairs. Holmes hummed an upbeat tune, that Watson did not recognize, as he quickly descended. He was radiating with energy and excitement. Holmes traversed the room in a few steps, stood by Watson, and smiled before bending down and kissing him. The excess energy radiating from Holmes seemed to be transferred through the kiss and left Watson a little breathless.
In the distance, a bird cried out. The crisp call of "tea-cher, tea-cher" from a Great Tit reminded Watson of a squeaky wheel barrow. He gently laid his supplies next to the radish bed and inspected the larger bed. While damp and a little bent over from the heavy rain, the seedlings looked as if they would make it. In the radish bed, he moved the earth to form a shallow trench and the bird song blended with the scraping sound of the trowel against the damp soil.
He felt connected to the universe when he sat on the bike and hummed a tune about the solar system order when he road it. He chose not to examine why such a brainless tune creeped into his head, and just let it drone on as he road.
Watson swirled his wine in his glass and inhaled the fruity aromas which blended wonderfully with the smells in the kitchen. He was not sure what was bothering Holmes more: the attention from Mrs Lloyd or the manuscript. Even Holmes had had potential female suitors who tried to win his heart, only to fail when he showed them no interest. Watson just needed to be patient, that’s all, and all would be revealed in time. Besides, Holmes was his spouse, in all but acknowledged title, and they were equally devoted. The manuscript was mostly uncharted territory. He did proofread his other works, but usually those were presented in such a finalized state that they did not need many drastic changes. He sighed, finished his glass, and got up to check the meal once more.
Sherlock zoned out the rest of the shop assistant's pitch. Sensing that he lost the potential client's interest, the insistent man moved to put his leg up on the display and put himself in Sherlock’s line of sight.
Note that a smutty chapter is ahead. Scroll to the --- if you want to skip it and read how the story ends.
Holmes was silhouetted against the window. Watson untangled himself from the bedding and went to Holmes. Holmes was looking out of the window perhaps at something or nothing at all; he could not decide at this angle.
“I’d like you to rest for a little while. We should… We should move you upstairs. It will be more comfortable.”
My hands stroked his pale sides, up his chest, causing his breath to quicken. My prick stiffened at the sound.
“OK, ok, I won’t harvest extra radishes for you. I’ll also check the fence, hopefully it will continue to deter the rabbits.”
Movement down the road caught his eye and he saw that it was the postman. He walked around the cottage to meet him. The postman dismounted from his bike and picked out a small stack of letters from his mailbag. He handed the letters to Watson, tipped his hat and left.
He told himself that the feeling of missing something was because bike held no more mystery, no puzzle, no interest. It had been a distraction – nothing more. It was easier not to remember the joy or how he felt free on his bike. The memories were packed away in his mind palace with the same care that he used to cover the bike in the shed. As he hid the key, he reminded himself that it was hardly a complicated puzzle and he was done with it.
Holmes had been in an uncommunicable mood since their discussion of the manuscript and the arrival of the letter that afternoon. Holmes kept to himself walled off in his chemistry room, giving curt answers, if any at all, to Watson’s questions.
The sun slowly burned away at the morning mist that covered the Sussex coastal region. The filtered light tried to peek through the windows of a white washed cottage to let the occupants know of its arrival, but there was no one there to welcome it.
“ ‘Most healthy, young man have little to fear from the stings of this gigantic jellyfish,’ ” read Watson. As Holmes turned and settled himself in the armchair and picked up another book, Watson frowned and swallowed back the comment of
“Good,” said Watson. “I like the one signal we have, and it would be acceptable if that one alone remained.”
For most of the morning, Watson found himself alone in their shared cottage and he busied himself with manuscript drafts and his garden diary. Holmes had walks into town in the morning for an errand he would explain nothing about. From the ache in Watson’s shoulder, he knew a storm was coming and informed Holmes, but Holmes left anyway. The rain poured down and Watson knew that Holmes would be drenches on his return trip.
Prompt: It Is July, After All: London can be brutal in the summertime. Let’s have some hot sweaty London and Holmes and Watson being hot and sweaty in it, all while trying to solve crimes and not strangle each other.
“Of course,” said Watson and moved to search for his nightshirt. “We are, after all, obstinate old men who are firmly settled in our patterns and habits.”
“He is arguing that obesity is linked to promiscuity,” Holmes said. “Think back to our own experiences; we’ve seen thin women with angelic faces committing the blackest crimes and fat women with the gentlest souls. There is no correlation.”
“But Holmes, we are going to have a lot of radishes even if we remove the one extra variety. I will be eating radishes for every meal. Was your plan to make me dislike them?”
The rider left with a roar from the bike and did not turn back. Sherlock tossed the paper on the ground and walked back to his bike. He rolled his eyes and groaned before turning around and pocketing the note. It wasn’t as if he needed or even wanted to ride with them. And he was not going to go or consider going. He just wanted to not litter.
Through the window, Watson saw a bent over figure briskly walking up the path to the door. Holmes burst through the door with the rain on his heels trying to follow him indoors.
A new bond required careful tending with more physical contact until it had matured enough. Lacking that touch would cause the bond to shrivel and the ones bonded to be in pain until it finally broke. If Holmes was unwilling to bond or if he did not feel the same, then I would leave. What happened could be undone, but I needed to find new quarters.
“Yes, but it felt wrong. The song “summertime” was playing, but it’s also wrong.” John cleared his throat and tried to sing. “Summertime and the living's easy.” He stopped and grinned sheepishly. “That song. Anyway, I was alone then an unexpected visitor startled me.”
The wardrobe appeared to be perfect normally. The sort that was found in almost all old houses. Mrs Hudson explained that it had been in 221B Baker Street long before she arrived.
Having a dedicated room for Holmes’ chemistry sets had been one of the conditions for a retirement home. The rest of the list Watson had learned about after he was introduced to the house.
Be warned there is a minor motorcycle accident. No one gets seriously hurt, but I'm giving in warning if it's a trigger for someone.
Mycroft’s smile was smug as he pocketed the tracker. “Did you expect me not to have some contingency plan, brother mine?
Sherlock growled out through clenched teeth, “I do not need to be retrieved like some lost trinket.”
“Of course.”  The red-haired rider walked back to his bike and searched through his pockets as he walked. He pulled out a cigarette pack and lighter.
After adjusting his belt, Sherlock said “I’ll have the bike looked over and any repairs made.” John loved the slight unsteadiness of Sherlock’s voice. “We’ll try it out when it gets back. And we’ll need to get you a leather kit.”
He gathered up the gloves he had brought in that morning and took time tying his shoes that had now dried from the morning dew. He put on his hat and went out. As he walked down the path, he remembered one of the large weeds from last year. It had been overlooked in a remote and forgotten corner of his garden and flourished. The weed would not move after several attempts at pulling it. Watson had pulled harder and it suddenly gave way, sending a shower of dirt in all directions. Watson had tipped; the force rolled him onto his back with an umph. He had mentally checked himself over for injuries, finding none, he had looked up at Holmes from the flat of his back.
“No, not entirely exact. Fuckable might be more exact.” There is something about vulgarity falling from his lips that fills me with heat. I rolled us over and reluctantly got out of bed to retrieve the pot on the makeup table before returning to Holmes.
The spring morning did little to brighten Watson’s broken-hearted mien. Like every other morning, he arrived at his practice early to work himself into exhaustion before returning to his wife-less and friend-less home. He took his miserable existence one day at a time.
“Seven. No, there are more. I will need to count when we go inside.” Watson started rolling the radish leaf in the opposite direction and paused. “I have now realized the true purpose of this experiment.”
John grasps onto the cool steel hoop with both hands and lets his body hang long underneath it. Brief flashback appears of him being a child hanging on the monkey bars laughing which morphs into his basic training coach yelling at them to cross the bars faster. John shakes his head to dislodge the memory.
Holmes swallowed and then shook his head. “My dear Watson, you are mistaken. My plan was to find a radish that I liked, not turn you off to a vegetable you clearly enjoy.”
The shop windows reflection showed a tall man with shoulders broader than Sherlock’s. His hair was thinning, and he had on a we-are-best-friends-now smile that irked Sherlock. Sherlock rolled his eyes. Now he would have to talk. To interact. He could see Mycroft’s satisfied smile at his internal squirming.
“As both a writer and a gardener, I can wax or wane as I please - I could begin describing your beekeeping in such terms if you would like.”
Watson had smiled up at Holmes. Holmes smiled down at Watson and extended a hand. He accepted it. “Your garden is fighting back, my old boy.”
Watson considered this as stood by the doorway and watched Holmes smooth out the soil with a hoe. Knocking his gloves against his trousers, Watson chuckled as his realization fell into place. He slowly moved from the doorway and walked down to join Holmes.
On a cycle the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is overwhelming."
“And by doing so you will injure yourself more,” I implored. Holmes gave me his most assessing look and I held his gaze steady. I knew my stubbornness was rewarded when he sighed.
He carefully inched his legs out of the bed and sat up. He squeezed his eyes tightly shut and willed the room to stop spinning and his stomach from spasming. Watson moved slowly. He unconsciously kept his eyebrows drawn together, got up, and shuffled to the door. His attention was caught by a glass of water on the dresser and a note.
In the changing room, John strips off his jeans, leaving on the skin-tight leotard and shirt. This somehow feels wrong. The lady he called from the academy suggested that he should wear this to his first lesion. Purchasing the leggings (and dance belt), even with the anonymity of online, still felt awkward. He feels exposed and the urge to cover himself is overwhelming.
“The want you have in abundance; the ability you already have.” Watson squeezed his hand and went to pour them a drink.
Just as well, for he had the most wonderful tea time with her after the doctor’s departure. He had sung the praises of her strawberry scones and she beamed. Her bright, inquisitive eyes never left his. Their conversation flowed easily, and they discovered that they had a lot in common. Mrs Lloyd, Dolores she had asked him to call her, said he looked like a man who knew how to take care of himself. He could get lost in those eyes.
