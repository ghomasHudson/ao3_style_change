“Aww, it’s so sweet,” Betty chirps from the chair she’s sharing with Bruce on the other side of Tony’s hospital bed. “But should we really be recording it? It feels like we’re taking advantage of a sick man.”
Steve packs up his stuff and decides to move back into the room he was in before everything. The room he hasn’t even opened the door to in a year and a half. The room Tony built for him before he even knew who Steve Rogers was.
“You can do anything you put your mind to.” He flips the knife in his hand with ease, holding the handle out to Tony, and moves over in his seat. It’s not enough space to sit fully, so Tony will have to sit half in his lap.
Tony finds himself blinking once, twice yet again before focusing his gaze on Steve. There’s popcorn in his hair, a blush tinting his cheeks pink, and he won’t meet Tony’s gaze. Tony’s heart melts at the sight.
Steve squeezes his eyes shut as another twinge of pain rolls through him. Clint’s words, as sweet as they are, don’t help. Because it doesn’t matter that everyone else thinks they should be together. They’re not.
Tony hears a loud smashing noise from below but he doesn’t give it any thought. He’s thoroughly distracted by his righteous anger, especially when M.O.D.O.K hisses and orders one of his men to gag him. The guy’s just finished tying the gag behind Tony’s head when the room explodes into action.
Steve’s sitting on the edge of their tub with his head hung heavy between his shaking shoulders. “Hey,” Tony whispers as he crawls down onto his knees before Steve. He tries to cup Steve’s face between his hands but Steve is curled in on himself, not leaving an inch of room for Tony.
“Except how statistically it really isn’t. Less than 3% of the general population identify orange as their favorite color. People hate orange,” Tony swallows thickly. “In fact, most people can’t stand orange. I mean, sure orange is a fun color at parties or nice to wear for a night out but people don’t commit to orange. Most people don’t even objectively like orange for its aesthetic beauty or even appreciate its importance in the color wheel. But, you love…orange.”
“Is it?” Tony says, avoiding eye contact like he does when he’s telling a blatant lie. “Aw well, so sad that he’s being kept waiting.”
Tony absolutely perks up at that, preening at his tuxedo-clad reflection in the glass. Tony disentangles their hands only to press his hand to Steve’s lower back. “You don’t look so bad yourself,” he replies, ogling Steve in his dress greens. He reaches up to press his lips to Steve’s ear and says, “I swear, I think that you just wear this thing because you know it makes every being with a pulse drool at the sight of you.”
Tony’s just about to open his mouth to delay the inevitable a little bit longer when it happens. The lights go dim and the band starts playing the opening notes to “My Heart Will Go On.”
Steve looks up at that and shoots him a little grin. “As much as I hate it when you decide to do things like try and disarm a bomb within ten seconds to blow in an evacuated area-”
“Were you in the service too?” he asks, jumping on whatever information that leads away from embarrassing memories that she gives him.
Everyone files out and Tony can feel the excitement in the group rise. It sets him at ease that they all seem happily eager and Tony starts to feel less nervous and more curious. He knows that logically, this is probably a Christmas-related surprise. But he can’t imagine what would be so big to illicit everything they’ve done.
, I think,” he says. He’s still a little unsure but it’s the best guess that he has and by the way Tony’s face lights up, it was a good answer.
“See, that’s what rip your face off anger looks like,” Tony says as he sees Steve ram his shield into some poor thug’s neck.
Tony tries to keep it cool. Natasha’s softened considerably over the years too, but not enough to not hold getting emotional over a walk to the grocery store over his head for the rest of his life.
“Then Clint and I went to the original buyer,” Natasha says. “Luckily he was willing to help. But he had sold it to someone else. So, we tracked down the next owner. He was a little more,” Natasha pauses here. “Difficult.”
“Uh,” Tony starts, wanting to draw out as much time as possible so that he can get the words exactly right. He finally settles on just ripping off like a band aid. “I’m not perfect,” he spits out and Steve looks like that’s the last thing he was expecting Tony to say.
Steve finally pushes his fingers through the hologram, causing it to twist and flip midair, almost as if it were an actual seal swimming through the water. Steve absolutely beams and any pretense Tony had is gone. The flood gates have opened and the lump in his throat is back with a vengeance, bringing along a warmth that spreads through his chest and makes his heart beat a little bit faster and palms sweat and suddenly reality crashes down on him all at once.
“Red. Hot rod red. Cherry red,” Steve replies with a secretive little smile, like he always does when he tells an inside joke.
“I know you all expect me to make a joke out of this but each of us only gets a whack at this once every seven years so I thought I’d try my hand at being serious.” Steve squeezes Tony’s hand and everyone settles in. A hush blankets the room and all eyes are on Clint.
on that thing!” The nurses turn to stare at them and start to mumble when Tony yells coconuts at the top of his lungs and Steve can feel a flush of embarrassment crawl across his cheeks.
Steve looks up from his book to get a good look at his boyfriend, looking for any signs of intoxication or mind control, before clearing his throat and saying, “Pardon me?”
Steve huffs angrily, raking his fingers through his hair and saying, “It’s not fair, you know? It’s not his fault. Betty forgives him, she still wants to be with him, wants to see him more than anything, but the more I tell him that the more he refuses to believe me.”
Everyone was safe. Tony had slept eight hours last night. The snow was still an untouched blanket over the city. Looking down at it all, Tony takes a deep breath and revels in the rare moment of peace.
Steve protests as Clint leaps out of the room like a man on a mission. He calls after him for a moment though he knows it’s a lost cause.
Apparently Clint has a larger emotional range than Tony gives him credit for, because he excuses himself from the situation quickly, saying that he’s going to go check on Nat and Thor. Tony doesn’t honestly hear even half of what he says because before he’s even gone Steve is swinging in front of Tony to grab both of his hands.
“I don’t have a problem with him,” Tony says, a little twinge of awkward seeping into his tone at having to defend his feelings for a fictional character. “I just think his death wasn’t necessary. He made the wrong call.”
Tony runs his hand along the sketches gently, following the line onto the next page where there are several sketches of seals and lemurs from when Steve had last gone to the zoo. Tony looks up and sees Steve’s sleepy eyes tracing the movement of his fingers across the sketchbook and the moment is too quiet, too tender. It makes his hands itch and head feel leaden.
“He’s going to need the help,” Coulson says, shooting him a steely cool look. “I overheard Captain Rogers talking about how he proposed the other day and apparently he spent the majority of it listing off his major character flaws.”
“Yeah, yeah, I will,” Tony brushes him off. He does pluck a carrot stick off the plate and pop it into his mouth though, just to make Steve ease up a little.
Steve attempts glaring at Tony again and when Tony continues to look at him with the same, unfazed look he gives in with a sigh.
Steve’s going on day three of bed rest and Tony’s surprised he hasn’t killed anyone yet. Steve’s never been a complainer but this whole
He turned on his heal without so much as a goodbye and started back towards the door, only to be stopped a few steps later. A deep chuckle he had only heard once or twice before spilled out into the corridor, bouncing off the walls. He turned his one good eye towards the foreign sound.
“My point is that this team can’t survive with one of you gone and they definitely can’t survive without two of you. So when I tell you to
“Don’t get her started,” Tony says with faux-annoyance. “She’ll be waxing poetic over the exact shade of Bruce’s eyes for the next hour.”
Life goes on. Thor is back on Asguard for the moment and everyone else respects Steve’s wishes and acts as normally as possible and things do slowly go back to normal. Things between Steve and Tony are easy on the battlefield but still strained at home. They’re slowly getting better though. They’ve stopped avoiding each other completely and share meals with the team amiably. They even trade small talk every once in a while. Steve will talk about the weather or what movie is on AMC that night. Tony will mention whatever plans he’s working on in the lab. Tony never joins him to watch the movie and Steve goes to down to the lab but it’s better than nothing.
He’s tried apologizing but Tony’s shut himself away in the lab, locking it shut and barring access to everyone else. He won’t answer his phone, won’t come to bed, won’t even yell at Steve to go away when he pounds on the lab door for an hour straight, begging Tony to come out.
Steve’s out of his chair so fast that it nearly falls over. He’s halfway down the hall leading to the recovery room when he notices that Pepper isn’t following him.
Tony has always been his most willing model and most frequent subject. He has sketchbooks filled with Tony’s nimble, inventor’s hands alone. But Steve never gives into him when he’s like this. It’d be too easy.
“Then I have no choice,” Thor says gravely, though he’s fighting a smile. He promptly uses the fork to poke Bruce’s hand instead. Bruce squawks, laughs, and is half way through an incredulous “Really?” when Clint finally comes into the room.
“He did,” she says with a heavy sigh. “He was damn good at it too. Made it to Sergeant in two years. He loved your old film reels as a kid.”
“Oh don’t act like you’re mad that we crashed!” Clint says as he falls into line with Tony and Steve on the ice, matching their speed. “You love us too!”
“Do you identify with Jack, Steven?” Tony asks slyly. He knows he’s got Steve when he doesn’t answer but merely rolls his eyes and grumbles as he heaves himself out of his chair.
“Really, Tony?” Steve says, voice shaking with repressed laughter. “I think I can handle it on my own.”
“I was saving this for closer to the wedding but I guess now’s the perfect time,” Tony says, going over to his night table and pulling out a thick metal band.
Steve is suppressing any audible laughter like a champ, but he’s shaking so hard from it that Tony can feel it while only holding his hand. He’s honestly afraid that if Steve bites his lip any harder he’ll draw blood.
But the words don’t come. Because if they’re anything, they’re stubborn, and Tony’s made up his mind.
Fury heaved a heavy sigh. He knew that he’d been going soft lately, but this was a new level of pitiful.
“Hey,” Tony muses, “I totally think I can see that Mexican joint we went to with Bruce the other day from here. Babe, look, look down there! I can totally see the neon maracas! Now that is an achievement, call the record books. We have a winner for the most obnoxiously bright neon sign in all of New-”
He looks up at his liaison, the man who demanded that this be a team event, feels a sudden burst of unexpected fondness that he hadn’t ever expected to feel for the likes of Tony Stark.
When he notices what he now knows was the cause of everyone’s secrecy last he nearly falls to his knees.
Tony tries to imagine anyone giving Natasha trouble with anything but he’s so overwhelmed right now that he can’t even give it a moment’s thought. He couldn’t think straight if he tried.
He opens a window to get rid of the stale smell and turns on the light. It looks vaguely less empty in the light but a thousand times more lonely. He tries to hang up his clothes but his hands are shaking too hard. He can’t do anything but fall onto the bed and bury his head in his hands.
Tony just smiles and rests his forehead against Steve’s, basking in the moment before groaning. “So, this may be a bad moment to tell you, but I requested a special song for you.”
Steve leans forward, taking his weight off of his other hand still on the beach towel, and brushes a finger down Tony’s nose and over his cheekbones.
“It’s okay, sweetheart,” Tony says, taking Steve’s hand in his and holding it in his lap. “I like your speeches.”
“So it’s blackmail?” Bruce asks, calmly amused from behind Betty, his arms wrapped tightly around her midsection.
“Don’t you know when to keep your mouth shut?! I could end your life with a swish of my hand!” M.O.D.O.K screeches and Tony rolls his eyes. Because really? The guy looks like a floating gnome and sounds like a shrill nine year old throwing a temper tantrum.
“Ow!” Tony says, hamming it up for effect. “This is how you treat the man that you’re going to be marrying in a month on this very roof.”
Tony swallows and tries to make himself counter Steve but he can’t. In a way, he wants Steve to tell him that he’s terrible. But mostly, he just really loves Steve and he wishes his mother had gotten to meet him.
“That was before I knew that I rather bite my tongue for the rest of our lives than not have you,” Tony says with a bitter laugh. “I’m tired, Steve. I’m tired of pretending. I’m tired of trying to be just friends with you and failing. I’m tired of us both being in pain for no reason.”
“It was actually supposed to be an anniversary gift,” Steve says. “I started looking for it back in January after you told me about it on the way back home from Buffalo. But it ended up being a little more difficult than anticipated, so I called in some back up.”
“Wha-” Steve starts but is quickly cut off as Bruce scolds Thor for trying to sneak a piece of turkey skin.
Steve thinks he has an awful voice but his singing is one of Tony’s favorite things in the entire world. Some of his best mornings have been the mornings he’s woken up to Steve singing to himself in the bathroom.
“I don’t know. I tried to go to the movies a while back in Brooklyn, right after I had gotten out of the ice, and all they were playing was this movie…
He breaks off to look away, biting the inside of his cheek as if he needs to ground himself or else the words won’t come out right. And Steve can relate. He knows that his eyes are just as suspiciously glassy as Tony’s are and his throat’s so full he can barely breathe.
Fury pushes the thought away with a grimace, coming to a dead halt in the middle of the hallway. He scowls up at the ceiling for a moment and grumbles, “Shut up, Phil,” before walking out in the cold night air.
And then the elevator dings, the door slides open, and Steve jumps away from Tony like he’s on fire. Tony grumbles, obviously displeased, but he doesn’t pull away when Steve goes to grab his hand and pull him out of the elevator.
? I know for a fact that anyone in this house would have gone with you. Hell, Betty would’ve gone with you and she doesn’t even live here.”
“I was merely trying to make the delicious delicacy known as ‘poptarts’ and the device began to spew black smoke. I ripped it from the wall but it still emits a foul odor. I cannot be sure but I believe it to be poisonous.”
“C’mon Steve,” Tony purrs and Steve knows that he’s getting desperate when Tony switches in his “seductive” voice that is less seductive than it is chain-smoker-y. Steve doesn’t have the heart to tell him that it doesn’t seem to have the same effect on Steve as it did the many that came before him. He glances over to Tony briefly to see that he’s put one hand behind his head and another on his hip.
Steve’s entire body goes cold and his heart skips a beat. There were many nights after they had broken up where Steve had stared at the wall, his stomach leaden, as he realized that he’d never heard Tony say those words in his life. That their year and a half together had come and gone and Tony had never said those words and he couldn’t help but wonder if that meant that it hadn’t meant anything at all.
All of Steve’s worries float away and he lets out a happy, joyful laugh. Tony lifts his face to look up at him like he’s gone insane but Steve can’t hold himself back any more. He presses his lips to Tony’s for the first time in fourth months, letting the overwhelming joy fill him up to the brim as Tony smiles into their kiss.
He nods and Fury isn’t surprised when he slides into the passenger seat precisely four minutes and fifty-nine seconds later. He says nothing, but his lips do twitch up when his eyes land on the GPS system Fury had used to guide him to the hotel. And Fury thinks that maybe it was less that he hadn’t learned how to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D’s eyes and more that he just might have wanted to be found this time.
“Well look at that,” Tony says with a smile. He pushes away from the table and grabs his drink in one hand and Steve’s wrist with the other. Steve follows after him without resistance and as short as it was he thinks that Tony’s plan might just have worked.
“Ah,” Tony says, shooting him a self-deprecating smirk over the rim of the bottle. “Not so allergic to intelligence as I thought you were, are ya? Yep. Record this for the ages. I, Tony Stark, am in love with
Steve ambles over towards Tony’s workbench and lays the sketchbook out in front of him. There are a series of sketches of cogs and screws and random pieces of scrap metal. The drawings start at the top in sharp focus and slowly cascade down the page into abstraction.
Stark doesn’t look surprised to see him, but then again Stark looks like he wouldn’t notice if a herd of elephants had busted the door down. Fury can tell from the glazed look in his eyes that he’s completely wasted and as he moves further into the room it only becomes more obvious; from the heavy stench of alcohol and scattered bottles to the disheveled state of the room and Stark’s clothing.
“And draw. Or paint. I was in art school before the war,” Steve tacks on in the hopes of distracting him. When he still doesn’t get a response other than a little nod he asks, “What’s yours?”
Steve keeps babbling but Tony makes no move to come closer and it only makes Steve panic more. He feels stupid sitting in this bed, in their bed, when something is so obviously off.
for Tony for a while now. Even if he hadn’t, the way his stomach swoops whenever Tony presses his lips to his might’ve clued him in by now. But Steve’s loved a bunch of people before and they’ve rarely inspired this kind of fear in him.
Tony says it, if only because it’s his husband’s birthday, but he can’t deny that it’s inherently hysterical. He has to bite down on a smile as Clint rolls his eyes.
Tony closes his eyes and leans into it all. The others eventually pile on top of him in a ridiculous dog pile, sneaking in noogies and squeezing him tight. He feels perfectly at home.
Steve only says “Tony.” But he packs it with so much incredulity that he doesn’t need to say anything else.
Tony hums in what Steve assumes is agreement but could easily be one of the drowsy little noises he makes when he’s half-asleep.
Tony feels a little bad but he doesn’t bother lying about it. He definitely would’ve snuck down the second everyone was asleep. “C’mon, Steve,” Tony says, practically vibrating with the need to know what lies behind the door.
“Ugh, that monstrosity? No, thank God,” Steve says, annoyance heavy in his voice. “You can thank Clint for that. He bolted it into the wall so that I can’t even take it down. I finally got him to agree to put a Caravaggio print in there though so it’ll at least be art historically prescient soft core porn.”
By this point Fury was pinching the bridge of his nose, trying desperately to keep that pesky throbbing vein in check. But sometimes these, for lack of a better word,
“I’ve been going to therapy a little more often,” Tony says just to fill the silence. It wasn’t the optimal choice, really, but word vomit is better than nothing in Tony Stark’s book.
“Awhile,” he murmurs in response, making a little noise of discontent as Tony peels away, presses a kiss to Steve’s temple, and rolls out of bed.
The look on Steve’s face says that while Tony might not care, he most certainly does and it pulls on Tony’s heartstrings.
Steve doesn’t bother asking how Pepper knows about their situation. Steve learned to stop asking how the women in his life knew anything about anything a long time ago. Instead he stutters out, “We-we’re not-”
“They were gone before I awoke. Though the voice in the ceiling has told me that Rogers decided Stark needed time away from the laboratory and has taken him to the park. That is why I attempted to make the poptarts on my own. Usually Banner or Natasha will make them for me.”
This morning, though, they’re lucky. Light is filtering in between the curtains and Steve is warm against his back in their cocoon of blankets. Steve’s morning scruff scratches at Tony’s shoulder where he’s buried his face into the crook of Tony’s neck. Tony’s only half awake, but the sensation of Steve’s breath on his neck and his fingers running up his side from his hip to his chest and back again is pure bliss.
“How?” Tony forces out, his throat scratchy, because he doesn’t even know where they would have begun.
It’s quiet except for Tony’s light snores and it’s nice. He lets out one last chuckle at the thought of Nick Fury in an apron and settles in for exactly two and a half minutes before the door busts open, hitting the wall with a crack.
He figured their conversation had ultimately been a win win. If it got through to him, all the Avengers would be in one place, as all the others had moved in weeks ago. It would be easier to keep an eye on them, or dispatch them as a unit.
Tony still isn’t buying it, looking steadily at Steve chest and not at the heavy bandages around his hands and neck. “You didn’t have to go in there Steve. That was a chemical fire. It was well over a thousand degrees. You’re lucky you’re still alive!”
Time slips by and when the elevator door dings behind Tony he actually jumps a little. He turns, expecting to see Betty, and can’t help the minor bolt of panic he feels when he finds Rhodey instead. Much to his chagrin, something must show on his face, because before he even says hello Rhodey says, “Nothing’s wrong!”
“This is priceless,” Clint says around a hearty laugh. Steve just rests his head in his free hand and wonders how the hell this is his life.
Tony throws himself back into his work and Steve mostly sticks to his promise to keep to himself and sketch, though he does conveniently clear his throat whenever he notices that it’s been a significant amount of time since Tony last took a bite of food.
Tony just blinks for a moment because he’s not entirely certain that he’s not in the twilight zone. It’s very rare that Steve gets worked up about anything that’s not real or tangible in some way. Tony’s only seen it once and Clint really had been cheating at Monopoly so Steve’s yelling had been founded.
“Remember I told you that SHIELD had me approve some new designs for the suit a while back? When they wanted to add more padding to cushion the blow when I fall?” Steve says, sliding his arms into the sleeves and zipping the suit up along the front. “This is it. What do you think?”
“I tried to warn him,” Steve says. Steve had tried to hint to Thor that maybe it wasn’t the best idea to come and bring Jane along on their group picnic in Central Park after her impromptu visit.  It hadn’t gone over well.
There was a time when Tony would’ve responded to Steve saying that by throttling him. Or at least by making a snippy comment. He wonders where that Tony went because he knows how it’s going to go. He knows that he will still be here in the morning and he knows that Steve will come down and poke and prod him until he leaves the lab to go get some fresh air or sleep or eat.
Tony knows it’s a bad idea when he knocks on the door, that he’s crossing one of the many boundaries that they’ve set up since things ended between them, but since when has that ever stopped him before? He’s worried and the only thing that will settle him is seeing Steve, live and whole and
“I’m your friend,” he settles on, a sick feeling taking over him. He takes his hand off of Tony’s. “And your teammate.”
Tony’s shaking a bit and his mouth is dry but he’s sure that he wants to do this. After four years, he’s surer about this than he’s ever been about anything in his life.
“If not her then-” and then it hits him like a ton of bricks. For the first time in many, many years Fury just wants to get up and run as far away as possible.
“Hulk ran through it like it was nothing and smashed the circuit breaker,” Steve explains. “We were able to get through his ‘droves’ pretty easily after that.”
“Okay, seriously, I’ve been letting this go for the past week but come on now,” Tony says exasperated.
The stars are bright and visible in the absence of the blinding lights below and Tony’s not even sure that he’s ever seen this many stars over Manhattan before.
“Tony, just drop it,” Steve snaps, finally looking away from the television to pin Tony with a look that leaves no room for argument. It’d been a long time since Steve had talked to Tony like that and it stung, possibly even more than Steve hiding the real reason why he’d hidden his art supplies away did.
“He was wrong you know,” she says, looking back at Steve with an uncharacteristic look of tenderness. “To have left you.”
“Spies,” he grumbles to himself, though it doesn’t take him long to get over his surprise. He knows Natasha could easily kill him with a flick of her finger, even on her worst days, but she looks far from menacing in a pair of ratty jeans and an oversized grey tank top that looks suspiciously like one of Clint’s.
“Have you seen his list?” Tony asks in defense, strolling out into the hall to grab something before coming back into the kitchen. “It’s ridiculously long. I’m going for quantity at this point, not quality of groupings. Besides, we’ll watch
“Yeah, I’m fine. Have a knife dug into my shoulder, so I’ve been better,” Tony says, forcing a smile so that Steve will stop looking like the world is about to end. “But I’m happy that you’re here. I was worried there for a sec with the, ya know, giant wall of electricity.”
Betty decides to join in on the plank, getting into position and saying, “Just hold that position as long as possible and then go into the cobra!”
Tony falls into his lap still laughing and humming along to “Star Spangled Man” which had played in the background of the slideshow SHIELD had just played in honor of his hundredth birthday. Steve narrows his eyes in warning at Tony and when he just starts to sing along quietly into Steve’s ear, Steve bites his shoulder in retaliation.
Fuck Fury and the eye patch he rolled in on has been Tony’s philosophy since he met the man so there’s no way in hell that he’s ever going to willingly take his advice.
And Steve can’t. He can’t sit here and look at Tony all excitement and smiles and bright eyes on their anniversary and keep it together anymore.
The trace leads him to a hotel that doesn’t exactly look seedy but still manages to have that ‘if I slip you a few hundreds under the table, you never saw me’ kind of feel. In fact, he’s pretty sure he saw a senator in the lobby.
The sun is just starting to set and Thor and Clint are starting to pile up the fireworks under the watchful eye of Fury and Maria Hill. The air still smells heavily of charcoals and barbeque sauce and firecrackers. It has been a perfect day with his friends on the roof on the tower, barbequing and relaxing and enjoying the day.
“The rules are that we take turns giving the toast every year,” Natasha says evenly. “There are no rules that the speech can’t be ‘Happy Thanksgiving. I’m thankful we all made it. Let’s eat.’ Besides, I thought the whole point of us taking turns was to avoid Steve’s long-winded sap fest.”
“Tony,” Steve warns, making one last ditch effort to sway Tony. “I don’t think this is a good idea.”
The weird thing is the first thing Tony notices is that the room’s been painted. It was a clean shade of gray with metallic accents before. Now it’s a calm cream color with hanging plants and fuzzy rugs. All of the old office furniture had been hauled away.
And lo and behold, Nick Fury is standing in the doorframe, holding a plate full of toaster strudel, and wearing a pink, frilly apron.
“I hadn’t thought of apple crisps!” Betty gasps. “I like the way you think, honey!” Betty beams over at Bruce. Steve laughs. Another apple core rolls past Tony’s feet.
Steve goes stock still with mortification. Clint laughs so loud Tony can hear him from across the room. Everyone else is generally confused.
He hears Tony pad over to him and feels his fingers ghost over his shoulders but doesn’t let himself get distracted. He’s not even swayed when Tony presses a series of kisses to his neck, dripping shower water from his hair onto his back. This time the noise Tony makes is a clear sigh of disappointment as he moves away and around the side of the bench.
Steve hooks their ankles together where they’re swinging below them and whispers, “Yeah. Doesn’t seem like that long though.”
Tony scans Steve’s body, making sure he’s not hurt anywhere. His hands settle on Steve’s forearms, squeezing them reassuringly as he tries to figure out what’s wrong.
Things go back to how they were after that. The barriers go back up. Tony doesn’t try for anything else other than casual friendliness. Steve almost misses it and it makes him want to punch himself for being so stupidly contrary. But it’s fine. It’s all good and fine. For a while at least.
Honestly, I blame the Kiss the Cap apron. A man that attractive should never wear an apron unless he wants me to start to wonder what he’d look like with nothing under-”
But nothing prepared him for Steve’s vows. He had not be ready for how Steve would take Tony’s hands in his and look at him so intently, with so much love and awe embedded into every word he spoke. He had said, “Tony, there are no words for how much you mean to me. You offered me a home when I was lost, you befriended me even when I pushed you away, and you pulled together the family I never thought that I could have again after I got out of the ice. You are the most obstinate, insane, loving, selfless man that I have ever met and I love every inch of you. I vow to lend you my strength whenever you need it and always be there to catch you when you fall. I vow to always be someone who can live up to the strength of your loyalty and affection. And last but not least, I vow to love you and give you my best for the rest of my days.”
One half of the kitchen is perfectly normal. Bruce, Natasha, and Clint are sitting around the kitchen table eating breakfast quietly. It’s a scene Tony’s witnessed plenty of times. But then he turns his head.
That’s when he finally hears it. He hears a little sob-sniffle coming from behind the bathroom door. “Steve?” he asks and he hears it again.
He does turn towards the voice at that but it still takes him a minute to pry open his lazy eyes. Clint doesn’t comment on the delay. He’s busy helping Betty set up disposable silverware and open Tupperware full of sliced strawberries and pineapple chunks, his old, dirty Chucks getting even dirtier in the grass.
It’s quiet for a moment and Tony resists the urge to push for more. His patience is rewarded when Steve clears his throat and says, “Uh, I went to bring Peggy flowers like I always do a couple of days ago and the room was empty.”
One of Natasha’s widow’s bites flies through the air and attaches onto M.O.D.O.K’s face, overpowering him and allowing the Hulk to come smashing through and smash him into the ground. The gunmen scatter across the room. They move so fast that Tony’s chair falls over sideways and the fall pushes the knife deeper into his side but all he feels is relief as he sees Cap’s shield fly above him. Between Clint, Steve, and Thor, the gunmen and the other remaining henchmen from outside are dispatched quickly.
and they’d just know. They’d look and they’d know. I think they all know already, in fact there might be a bet-”
“Oh, the list is about a million items long now,” Tony says, looking at Steve like he’s crazy for thinking that Tony could ever think that Steve’s favorite color was the
“It doesn’t matter,” Steve grits out. “It’s over. Just act normally and everything will fall back into place again.”
“No. No. No. Nope,” he trailed, swinging the bottle in his hand around in small circles. “Because everyone is just
Steve rolls his eyes again, albeit a little more affectionately this time around. “How am I not even a little surprised?”
The rest of the team came back eventually, some making their displeasure at his presence more obvious than others but what else was new?
“No,” he says with a yawn. “It was pink. And frilly. I think it was that gag gift Clint got Bruce a while back.”
things. He shouldn’t be checking up on them outside of strict S.H.I.E.L.D business or care about one of them dying beyond having to replace them. Why
“What the-” he muttered, crouching low and covering his mouth with his jacket sleeve as he moved closer to the source of the smoke. The smell of burnt food flooded him as he entered the kitchen and pretty soon he could see the source of the problem.
Tony thinks he might’ve been able to better navigate this situation if he had realized what was happening. If it had been like how it had been with Pepper, more of a gradual reveal and less like an eighteen-wheeler smacked him across the face. But he doesn’t even know when it happened. There’s no one moment he can point to and say, ‘ah yes, that is the moment I started to fall madly in love with Steve Rogers.’
Everyone was here and everyone was safe. Tony couldn’t ask for more and yet he had a whole year’s worth of happiness to look back on too. He snuggles closer to Steve as the countdown to enters the last thirty seconds and Steve pulls him close.
“This is Betty, Steve,” Tony says, making quick introductions as Steve takes the seat between him and Betty. “Betty this is Steve.”
So,” he pauses to dig the ring box out of his pocket and when he looks back up at him Steve is beaming, which he takes as a good sign.
Steve just laughs and dives in for another happy kiss that is disrupted by Betty yelling, “Okay guys, everybody gather around! It’s cake time!”
The sun is almost unbearably hot and so bright that Tony has to squint up at Steve, even with his sunglasses on. But the air smells salty and sweet, Tony can hear Thor laugh as he jumps through the waves, a giant golden mountain in the water compared to everyone else, and, best of all, Steve is gloriously shirtless.
“Really?” Steve asks. Tony can tell by his tone of voice that he’s amused by Tony’s dreamland ramblings and he’d protest if he was sure what he saw wasn’t actually a dream. “It wasn’t my apron, was it?”
“Hey,” Steve says quietly. “I just tried to get him to eat something but he still won’t budge. Maybe you can get him to eat.”
“Really?” Tony says, clearly disappointed and Steve fights off the feeling of rejection. There’s no use getting hurt at something someone as out of it as Tony is has to say. It doesn’t make it sting any less.
Maybe it’s the tone of concern in Tony’s voice or maybe it’s just the culmination of weeks of frustration but something inside Steve snaps and he turns away from the punching bag violently.
It’s one of those moments where Tony has to pause and consider what Steve needs. Tony knows it’s hard for him. He knows that it’s been seventy-five years but the guilt of watching his best friend die is still as fresh as if it happened yesterday. Tony also knows a thing or two about guilt and he knows that anything he says won’t change a thing. He settles on taking Steve’s hand, the one planted next to Tony’s shoulder on the beach towel, and wrapping it in his. He settles their intertwined hands on top of the arc reactor without a word and is rewarded with a tiny grin. Tony does everything but outwardly preen.
You’d think with all of his genius that Tony would’ve learned how to avoid the all seeing eye of S.H.I.E.L.D by now but to Fury’s surprise, he’s able to track him down on the first attempt. He’s even more surprised when he shows up to the address and actually finds Tony instead of something along the lines of a note that said ‘Haha, you’ve been punk’d. XOXO Your favorite genius billionaire playboy philanthropist.’
“What’s this?” Tony asks as he strolls into their bedroom to find Steve putting on an unfamiliar suit.
Steve glances down the register to where Tony is leaning on their cart and flipping through the gossip rags furiously and not helping him load their giant cart of groceries onto the belt at all. Their cashier, a girl who can’t be over the age of seventeen, looks on bug eyed.
Tony knows that she means that they’ll get both and share. He knows it because it’s how she’s referred to sharing everything from shawarma to onion rings for nearly a decade.
“Uh.” Steve shuffles again. “I’m watching a Hitchcock marathon on TV. You want to come in and watch?”
Steve just shakes his head and moves towards the stairs, leaving Tony to his thoughts, whatever they may be.
Maybe he’ll thank Betty Schaer with a five million dollar gift card to Williams Sonoma too. He’s still on the fence about it.
“Tony, really?” Steve huffs, exasperated. “You heard me describing that circuit breaker on the helicarrier. You think I’m a scientist?”
Steve narrows his eyes at Tony for a moment before nodding and turning back to the TV, dismissing Tony with a simple, “Uh huh.”
His vision is starting to swim and Steve bolts out of his chair and marches his way over to Tony. He looks increasingly distressed as he walks, his movements becoming jerky and stiff.
It had been a few months since the Loki incident and all had been calm. Calm enough for Tony to rebuild Stark Tower, with quarters for all the Avengers, without interruption.
“Are you seriously asking us to write your wedding vows for you right now?” Clint asks, voice laden with disbelief. “Because that can’t possibly be a thing you expect us to do.”
He’d just ignored him and yesterday he had gone up to his room to find his easel and his bench - the one that Tony had made for him with his own two hands, the one that Steve couldn’t even look at without his chest tightening – standing in the corner right  below the biggest window. Steve had marched right downstairs to put them back in storage only for JARVIS to refuse to unlock his locker, no matter how much Steve yelled and demanded to be let in.
He doesn’t though because things are weird enough with Tony and him bickering like parent and child. So Steve decides to laugh because laughter just seems like the best option right now.
been a good year. Tony can count the amount of times they had been called out on a major, world-threatening missions on one hand. Bruce and Tony had begun joint research into the future of robotics and artificial intelligence that was starting to gain traction. While Thor had lost Jane, he is still well and whole and happy – regularly helping Steve, Nat, and Clint on their missions when he can.
“Every time that I think that we’re getting better, we just go back to how it was. We’re too smart, too
“Hey, c’mon, talk to me here sweetheart,” Tony tries, trying to keep his voice soothing. Steve just rubs his palms roughly across his face, wiping the tears away.
Tony does actually smile at that and Natasha steadfastly ignores them while she opens the utensil drawer and grabs a butter knife. Tony can see where she’s going with this as she angles the knife carefully over the cake.
His brows furrow together as Tony remains stiff and silent in his arms and worry fills him. “You know you don’t have to say it back, right?” Steve says, in an attempt to comfort him. He knows Tony. He knows his heart and he knows his history. He doesn’t need Tony’s words.
“Why does no one want me going in the dining room?” Tony asks, as the team spreads dinner along a coffee table in Steve and Tony’s suite.
Thor turns his head back to Tony just to shoot a blank look at him that tells Tony that he has absolutely no clue what Tony is referring to. “It is an orchard,” is his only reply.
But he doesn’t. His side hurts like hell and Steve’s looking at him with those pretty, honest, blue eyes and Tony just doesn’t anymore.
Tony takes a moment to think about where the team has keeping him from for the past week a little harder. The dining room is immediately to the left of the elevator on the communal floor, which is why Natasha might have wanted to chaperone him. But no one had any problem with him passing the door to the dining room as he turned right into the main living area. But then there’s the office…
“Tony, there is a chandelier in this elevator. I think it’s fair to say that this is a little more complicated than dinner at our place would’ve been.” Steve turns to look at Tony himself rather than his reflection. “Things are going well between them. I don’t want to scare her off.”
Steve insists that they try to redo the joint anniversary dinner again now that everyone’s relationship is healthy and thriving even though Tony tries to dissuade him with a fervor that makes Steve instantly suspicious. It ends up not mattering anyway since the plans end up falling through. There’s a city wide blackout and all the restaurants are closed because apparently cooking in the dark is a bad idea.
“Tony, I don’t see anything wrong up here!” Bruce’s voice reverberates against the metal sides of the flue and causes a small storm of soot to come raining down onto their sad, fireless pile of logs and kindling. The laughter, to say the least, does not subside.
Clint claps him on the back and says, “You got good taste, big guy,” as Natasha separates the forks and knifes into two separate piles.
Because he’s honestly not sure what would have happened with Steve post-picnic if they hadn’t come home to a giant, gaping hole in the wall. Probably something that he shouldn’t be doing, probably something that pushed the envelope way too far.
“Hey!” Bruce protests but it’s half-hearted, and Steve makes a small happy sound so Tony doesn’t even pretend to apologize.
So now Tony’s crying and holding his index cards like a fool. Steve’s smiling at him lovingly, gently encouraging him like the perfect human being that he is and it kind of makes everything worse. Tony looks down at the cards with the words that aren’t his written on it and his stomach sinks. Steve had given him the most beautiful, truest words that he could.
Tony waits for the words of condemnation and they never come. So, Tony provides them himself. “I inherited a billion-dollar company and turned around and sold my mother’s piano.”
Tony doesn’t say anything until he steps on the third or fourth apple core nestled amongst the leaves.
Fury took a deep breath and decided to let it go. He hadn’t even come to talk to Barton. But neither Stark nor Rogers were around and he didn’t hear or see any signs of fighting so he decided to let it slide. He had other projects to deal with.
“Somehow I can’t help but think that you were the one getting handsy in an elevator,” she says and Steve likes her already.
Tony slips on the simple gold ring. It’s not much but he knew Steve would love it and really, it’s just a place holder until they pick out their wedding bands together. Steve tackles him to the ground the second the ring is on and covers him with kisses.
“Are you seriously apologizing to me for your ring melting off your finger right now?” Tony snaps. “I couldn’t care less about the ring.”
Steve smiles at him when he notices his presence and says, “Well, it’s not what we’re used to but it’s still pretty great.” He turns his face up towards the sky and Tony follows his gaze.
Steve can’t help but think that this is partially his fault. If he hadn’t invited Tony into his room that night, he wouldn’t feel like he’s been run over by an emotional eighteen-wheeler.
“You taking the whole orchard home?” Tony asks, genuinely concerned that they didn’t bring a big enough car.
Steve’s eyes go wide and surprised for a moment. He drops his sandwich and pushes it to the side and for a moment Tony’s worried that Steve’s caught on before he’s even begun his speech. But then Steve opens his mouth and says, “Is this about the weird sex thing I asked you about the other day? Because I swear I didn’t know it was a sex thing when I asked you and it didn’t even sound remotely appealing.”
“You want to see something cool?” Tony asks, raising his voice just a little too loud in the emptiness of the lab.
“Uh,” Steve fumbles to think of something, matching Tony’s intense gaze. He’s grown to respect Tony in a sort of detached way after watching him work on the helicarrier and risk his neck to save New York. But there’s always been a barrier between them where Tony’s cynical humor and Steve’s optimistic dedication to the cause just didn’t mesh. But Tony
They try to make things as painless as possible for the sake of the team.  It doesn’t really work. It just makes things awkward for a while. But they try. Eventually they just become experts at avoiding one another.
Steve’s starting to tear up but he’s still smiling and after a beat he starts nodding enthusiastically and Tony feels simultaneously relieved and overjoyed when Steve says a simple, "Yes, I love you, I will.”
Steve snorts but considers the question anyway. He scrunches up his face and rubs his thumb against the condensation on the side of his glass as he searches through old memories, memories before the war and Erskine. A lifetime and a half ago.
By the time August rolls through, hot and muggy, Steve still aches and he thinks he might just always be a little heartbroken over Tony Stark. But it’s manageable and life trudges on.
Tony looks like he’s winding up to come back at Steve with all he’s got for a few seconds, all coiled up tension and bared teeth like a dog with its fur raised, and then it’s all gone at once. Tony simply takes a long sip of his drink and lets out a long sigh.
Steve turns back to the table from where he had been absent-mindedly gazing out the window while waiting, looking around at each of their faces before turning to Tony and saying, “I think I should be offended?”
“You don’t look so hot, Tony,” Bruce adds, scrutinizing him over his bowl of fruit and Tony glares at him a little because Steve is bad enough without reinforcements.
“I’m sorry to hear that” Steve says, struggling to find words and keep a straight face and not stutter. It’s not from embarrassment this time but from the shock of Tony’s had on his thigh. Apparently whatever conversation Clint had to offer hadn’t been entertaining enough to keep him occupied for long. Steve slightly regrets the elevator tease now. But only slightly.
“Happy Turkey Day, birdbrain!” Tony says happily and everyone echoes the sentiment in their own way. It’s the first time Tony’s seen him today, which he had thought was a little odd as he had been in and out of the common area all day. But Clint looks no worse for the wear.
Tony smiles, highly amused. The Cap suit was ridiculous when it was accompanied by the matching boots, gloves, and cowl but Tony always gets an extra kick out of it when he sees Steve in just the suit. Something about him walking around with his hands and socks sticking out is infinitely entertaining.
Steve nods and Tony squints up at him carefully. “Well, I’m losing my touch then. You’re a knockout.”
Betty tries to change the subject by saying, “Well, I’m sure they’ll work it out one way or another,” in a chipper tone, “Now come eat!”
Steve moves his hand from the radio to Tony’s lap, where he scoops up Tony’s hand in his and lays it on the console between them. A few more moments and Steve is singing along to “Something Stupid” almost unconsciously.
Steve drapes himself over his shoulders and nuzzles into the top of his head. “Merry Christmas,” he says. “We love you”
Tony is suspicious that they’re starting to look soppy but he really couldn’t care less - despite the fact that he is fully aware that all twenty-seven cameras are now on them.
Steve most definitely does not twirl. In fact he just buries his face further into his hand and thanks God that Natasha went with Thor to the vending machines because he knows that she’d never let him live down how red he’s turning.
“Your whatever with Tony,” she finishes. “I’m leaving because post-anesthesia Tony is even more ridiculous than regular old Tony. I’ll come back and see him when it’s worn off.”
The worst part, he finally thinks, is that Steve returned the goddamn kiss. He had smiled back and had taken his hand and hadn’t even questioned it. He hadn’t even tried to put a definition to it all. He had done it like it was natural as breathing, that it was obvious, that Tony could just
“You don’t like Jack?” Steve asks as he perks up, coming out of his tunnel vision haze. He sounds a little Brooklyn, a little defensive.
“Yep,” Steve replies, popping the p with a sassy grin and Tony just has to kiss him until it fades away. They don’t break apart until they hear a chorus of wolf whistles and gagging noises and even then they don’t go far. Tony rests his forehead on Steve with a happy little sigh and Steve just smiles.
, Tony mouths and Steve’s resentment, his anger, his pain all seem petty in light of this. He feels it all melt away and he nods, slips off his cowl, and says “Me too.”
Steve stiffens yet again and Tony knows it’s bad when Steve opens his mouth to answer him without even looking away from the television.
He takes a deep sigh and continues, “Buck and I were 10. He made me ride it over and over until we were puking our guts out.”
“So, Steve Rogers,” Tony says, pouring all his heart and soul into his words. “I love you. Will you marry me?”
On their fourth anniversary Tony surprises Steve when he takes him into the bowling alley to find the neon maracas and burrito hanging on the wall on either side of the Caravaggio. Part of Steve is distressed that such a beautiful, important piece of art is surrounded by two of the kitschiest things in the word. But he’s mostly touched that Tony searched for them for him.
They’ve faced a lot of terrible, frightening, horrifying things together as a team. But every horror they’ve faced pales in comparison to this. Getting the call to go wrangle Bruce, still Hulked-out and out of his mind with fury as Betty hangs over the side of some scaffolding broken and pale, is the hardest thing they’ve ever done. They just barely keep the army at bay, leading the Hulk into a wide-open field in the evacuated park and talking to him until he shifts back into Bruce. When they run over to him he’s shaking and weeping profusely, his balled up fists pressed into his eyes. Steve can barely stand to see such raw anguish on his teammate’s face and can’t even imagine what it must be like for Tony to see one of his closest friends like this. He meet’s Tony’s eyes as Thor undoes his cape and wraps it around Bruce and all he sees is sorrow and regret.
Tony practically digs his trowel into his poor, abused wall, grinding the drywall compound into the mesh lining like it’s the reason everything is such a mess right now.
” Tony practically moans. He rubs a frustrated hand across his forehead and clutches his drink. “We’re shelving that conversation for another day. Next please.”
“Give it a few minutes and the next time you light the fire it won’t go out,” she whispers delicately, grabbing Bruce by the hand and pulling him back to the couch with her as she moves away from the fireplace.
Betty apparently takes that as her cue to just move on as she says, “Okay, now down into the plank position! Just like I showed you before!”
The pose is baffling enough to grab Steve’s full attention, something he immediately regrets when Tony drawls, “Draw me like one of your French girls.”
Tony’s face scrunches up, like he’s contemplating laughing again, but it smoothes quickly. “No. No, not Pepper. No, this is far, far worse.”
He sets the boxes down and takes a deep breath. His hand trembles and his heart aches as he goes to open the door. He takes a moment to lay his head against the cold, unfamiliar wood. He wills himself not to cry.
They try doing a joint anniversary celebration with Betty and Bruce in the hopes that showing how far they’ve come and celebrating it might help advance their tentative, hesitant attempts at being together again. But Betty’s still in her casts and Bruce ends up leaving halfway through dinner.
“Doesn’t look good,” Natasha murmurs from her perch atop a nearby rock. Her hair shines, beet red, in the sun; matches the two red patches starting to bloom on her cheeks.
Tony can’t do this. He can’t be in love again. Because he’s just started to piece his friendship with Pepper back together again after months of not talking and it had hurt more than anything to think that he might’ve lost her forever.
Tony doesn’t have the good fortune to wake up in his husband’s arms every day. Between missions, Tony’s long hours in the workshop, and Steve’s tendency towards early mornings it’s rare that they ever wake up together.
Steve blocks his attempts with ease. “You said lay it on me, liaison,” Tony whines as they scuffle, Steve clearly holding back as they push and pull at each other. Tony thinks he sees Steve grinning a couple of times and it only makes him more determined.
“Okay!” Fury cut him off, not wanting any more details than he already had. He was uncomfortable enough with this as is. “That’s enough of that. I think it’s time you got your ass up and come with me.”
Steve lets out a sound that’s a mix between a laugh and a sigh, before reaching out for Tony’s hand. “Should’ve known that this was too big a surprise to keep under wraps,” he says. “C’mon sweetheart, we have something to show you.”
Her eyes cut to Bruce. She looks at him with open affection as he tries to explain light bulbs to Thor with a paper napkin diagram and everything locks into place. Steve’s worries fall away.
Steve feels warmth go through his chest and he grabs Tony’s hand and pulls him against his side. “Nah,” Steve murmurs, pressing a kiss to the top of Tony’s head. “You just look handsome tonight.”
Fury ignores him in favor of screaming, “I called you to assemble twenty minutes ago! Your team is out there fighting without you!”
A small, amused yet slightly self-deprecating smile broke out across his face. “Don’t worry, the arrows aren’t bothering me. Or the other guy. Besides, Clint never misses, right?”
“Oh my god,” Clint says, voice ragged and breathy as he fights to get air into his lungs between laughs. “Oh my god, I think that I’m going to die.”
“Okay, sacrifice is all good and fine when it’s necessary,” Tony says, getting more and more agitated as baby Leonardo DiCaprio turns progressively bluer. “But this wasn’t necessary. He could’ve gotten on the damn door. He could’ve found another piece of furniture. It’s just dumb. Jack Dawson is dumb.”
“Awww apple muffin, you do care!” And as exaggerated as his sickly-sweet tone is, Tony is genuinely touched that Rhodey cares. That he walked through a blizzard for Tony. That he searched a desert for him. That he put up with him was he was an awkward, obnoxious fifteen-year-old stumbling through MIT. They’re long-term warm and fuzzies.
“Yeah, I mean,” Clint scrunches up his face in thought and then says, “You can mention that he’s pretty good with that shield and that his ass is pretty bangin’ too, I guess.”
Steve isn’t deterred by her warnings though. This past week has been a roller coaster of emotions and he needs to see Tony, no matter how loopy he is.
“Look at this,” Tony teases, finally turning to meet Steve’s gaze. “Mr. I-don’t-think-this-is-a-good-idea is all for saving the relationship now.”
Steve pulls Tony even closer to him, tucking his head beneath his chin and wrapping the blanket around them tighter. They didn’t do anything special, just went out to dinner and came home to their roof. They can’t see any stars up in the inky black polluted sky but the buildings shimmer beneath and it makes for a beautiful view.
Tony’s heart leaps in his chest. Steve hasn’t voluntarily been in the same room alone with him since they broke up. “Yes,” he blurts, practically shoving his way into the room before Steve moves out of the way to let him in. Steve doesn’t comment.
Steve turns to face his new husband after having properly thanked Betty for her attempts at swing dancing with him and lifts an eyebrow.
He speaks that last word like it’s poisonous and Fury needs to take a moment to sit down because he is totally unequipped to handle this situation.
“It’s wonderful!” Betty says with a huge, goofy grin as she unravels her scarf, revealing red, wind beaten cheeks. “I’ve never been happier.”
The teams hoots and hollers as he finally opens up a container of pad thai, tries some, and gives the crew a thumbs up. The camera shakes with Tony’s laughter and they’re all so loud that he doubts that anyone who ever watched the video would have any clue what was going on.
Steve doesn’t even remember what they said to each other this time around or how it started, though he knows that he ended it. He doesn’t remember the vitriol he spewed but he remembers the hurt on Tony’s face and it kills him a little, now that the flames have died down again, to think that he did that. Tony is both incredibly strong and incredibly fragile and Steve hates that he knows that, hates that when he feels nothing but anger he knows exactly where to push to make him break.
He unclenches and flexes his hand after dropping the pen he had been holding for what seemed like hours. “They tell me all this paperwork is going to make a difference though so I have to try. It doesn’t make the whole thing any less frustrating.”
Fury just let out a stream of curses, not even responding to her question before storming out of HQ and towards Stark Tower.
He holds it up so that Steve can get a good look at it and the simple inscription of their initials on the inside of the band.
“Know any good jokes?” Tony blurts out and Steve rolls his eyes at pushes his chair out from beneath the table.
Later, after they’ve gotten Tony home and he’s back in his right mind, Steve looks at him and whispers, “Did you mean it? On some level at least? Do you even remember?”
Tony doesn’t really have a lot of leverage here as he’s chained to a chair and surrounded by four scarily large men with even scarier large guns but Tony’s never really learned when it’s a good time to shut up.
Tony’s pretty sure his brain is fried. It’s gone. It’s completely dead, gone, and seized in perpetual awe at the sight of Steve Rogers in yoga pants
Tony frowns but knows better than to try and push for more answers. He just nods and mutters “Fair enough.”
Thor stood over a heap of metal, a look of utter confusion on his face as he flailed wildly in an attempt to clear the smoke that was coming from what Fury assumed used to be an appliance.
but convinced that it was as good as it was going to get. They had finally gotten to a point where it had been tolerable, amicable even, and then Tony had to come uproot all of the things Steve had worked so hard to bury with his mixed messages.
It’s still silent for a few moments after Coulson leaves until Clint blinks and says, “What in the actual fuck just happened?”
“Nice to meet you,” Steve says as he holds out a hand to shake hers, trying to be as nice and warm and welcoming as he can possibly be. “I’m Steve Rogers.”
It’s a fact that is proven when he’s awoken at some God awful time in the morning on a Saturday by a slightly frantic Pepper Potts, whose first words are “I don’t know where Tony is.”
Steve does end up noticing, even after all the candles have been taken out and the cake is a hole-ridden mess, and he does find it pretty funny like Tony predicted. Then Tony gets to laugh again with him and it’s the best laugh he’s had all day.
Tony laughs and it’s the first time Steve’s felt at ease since he walked through the doors to this tower, carrying all of his worldly possessions in one tiny, little box.
Tony’s brain works a million miles a minute and Steve is always fascinated to watch him, though he still flushes when Tony turns his thoughtful stare on him. He is the most hot-blooded and most sentimental man in turns, equally likely to call Steve out on things as he is to rake his fingers through Steve’s hair and murmur affectionate praise into his ear. They push and they pull on one another and it makes Steve feel like he’s in free-fall in the best of ways.
“I’m sorry sir,” JARVIS says, prim and proper as always. “But I didn’t think it was an appropriate moment to save.”
The only sign of amusement he let show as he took the poptart and plopped down into the chair was a slight twitch at the corner of his lips.
“Well if you ever do, I’d be open to discussion because I promise that I’ll always be down for anything with you until I physically can’t get it up anymore. And at that point I demand that you just take me out back and shoot me.”
His other hand is currently clasped between both of Tony’s clammy hands as he waxes poetically about Steve’s chin.
The only reason Steve isn’t already beside Tony is that Bruce has brought a chess set with them and Steve was the only one that had risen to the challenge. When Tony finally curls up next to Steve he leans in for a brief kiss, warmth seeping even deeper into his bones, before glancing at the chess board. He squeezes Steve’s knee in an affectionate gesture as he sees that Steve is holding his own against Bruce pretty well. He’s proud but he can’t help himself when he foresees a move Steve can make for a major advantage.
Instead he just grins politely and switches his focus back to the sunset. He tries not to laugh too obviously when Tony huffs and pouts loudly.
Steve’s head is spinning at the heaviness of Tony’s words and he can’t do anything but choke out an awkward, “That’s good,” before he’s pressing his lips to Tony’s.
They didn’t really have a honeymoon phase like most couples do, mainly because neither their work nor their personalities were really conducive to spending hours upon hours looking soulfully into each other’s eyes. When they aren’t fighting Tony is still volatile, still sarcastic, still too biting and Steve is still stubborn, still just as sarcastic, and still too rigid at times.
He looks forward to every moment with Tony, whether they’re sitting together in silence or yelling at each other at the top of their lungs. Last week Tony rented out a movie theater so they could watch a double feature all by themselves and the week before that they didn’t move from their bed for twenty-six hours straight. Steve told Tony that he had enjoyed both things equally and Tony had responded by buying him an easel and a set of oil paints because that’s one of the many ways Tony shows affection. Steve’s been doing this thing with Tony for nearly a year now and he learned a long time ago that complaining about it does more damage than accepting the gifts with as much gratitude and affection that he can muster.
, to Bruce who’s face is turning a little red as he hangs over uncomfortably and then back to Steve. Tony’s brain nearly short-circuits for a record breaking second time in as many minutes when Steve shifts his legs further forward and apart. His upside down face is smirking at Tony from between his legs in a way that tells him that he knows
“And you’ve put together a harem, by the way, in reaction to my torrid affair. But your main squeeze is none other than Justin Hammer.”
He sets down the bottle and Fury sighs a sigh of relief, thinking that this entire fiasco has finally reached its awkward end. But then Stark speaks again.
Steve has been telling Tony for a long time now that he can’t wait for the day that Tony stops being surprised that people want him. In a world where he still has nightmares that feature his father’s words of disapproval and Obie scooping his heart out of his chest, it’s a hard concept to fathom.
“Aww, come on,” Steve says, tone still heavily teasing as he ducks down to press kisses all along Tony’s jaw. “You don’t mean that.”
Steve goes into the cobra just a little too fast at that, practically grinding his hips into the mat beneath him and Tony’s jaw hits the floor as the bastard winks at him.
“And how would you feel if he disobeyed my orders, did some stupid ass noble thing, and got himself killed?”
He’s a very calm drunk. He merely looks Fury up and down as if he’s hardly surprised that he’s there. And when he speaks his words aren’t slurred, just a bit too rushed. Fury assumes that it must be the result of many practiced years of liver abuse.
Steve and Tony have always burned long and bright and hard. Their relationship has been like a wildfire since the start, since the very moment Steve looked over at him at Stuttgart and spit out Tony’s name like it was something disgraceful. Tony had always lit a fire in him, gotten under his skin, pushed him right to the edge without even moving a muscle and Steve knows that Tony feels the same about him.
“It’s nice. I’m going to miss the obnoxious colors when I’m trying to find you from up in the air,” Tony says, padding over to run his hands over Steve’s ridiculously padded torso. “But, if it keeps you safe I would be fine with you wearing a paper bag. It’s still nomex and kevlar?”
When Steve finally does open his mouth it’s with a barely restrained sort of wheezing noise and he only manages to get out “He…” before he needs to swallow back more laughter.
Because Steve is irritatingly, overwhelmingly great in many ways. But he’s not otherworldly. He’s right here and he won’t let Tony fail.
“Neither one of you are of any help,” Tony says, leaning over the table and snatching their index cards and pencils while Clint screeches in offense. “I tell him those things every day. None of those things are vow worthy. Agent, you’re my last hope here.”
“Uh, I’m pretty sure it’s something,” Tony says sarcastically. “Unless you frequently cry in our bathroom. Which, if you do, raises a lot of questions.”
The roof time schedule goes back up. Thursday movie nights become alone time again. Tony’s a little disgruntled that they missed out on summer beach time together so he tries strip bowling to compensate. There are a lot of suspiciously obvious gutter balls.
It’s so empty it’s practically cavernous and more impersonal than a hotel room. He misses the black accent wall in their living room. He misses the dart board with the stick figure drawing of Fury above their couch. He misses the lime green comforter they used when their regular blue one was in the wash.
” Steve cries, on the verge of yelling. The back of his throat feels tight and he can feel the hot pinprick of tears at the back of his eyes. “We’re good together, Tony. If our arguing is the only problem, we can change that.
Steve feels weary as he leaves Bruce’s room, equally unsuccessful at convincing him to eat something as he is at convincing him that this wasn’t his fault, that Betty was fine, that she forgives him. Bruce hadn’t moved from his chair, the same place he was when Steve left him last night, and he had just shook his head, murmuring that he was fool over and over.
,” Thor says, dragging out the word dining. As if that wasn’t suspicious enough, his words are quickly followed but everyone else glaring at him.
And he knows that he doesn’t mean it but that slightly uncomfortable feeling refuses to be capped and he finds himself awkwardly patting him on the shoulder and telling him “Rest up,” before he can stop himself.
The rest of the team stayed home just in case they were needed for an emergency but Pepper’s with him, worrying in that silent way of hers. She’s rearranged her planner five times in the last twenty minutes alone.
“This is a momentous occasion,” Tony responds, pointing the camera towards Steve with a smirk. The little red light that shows that it’s recording a video blinks and Steve can’t help the blush that works its way across his cheeks.
,” Steve spits venomously. “But not anymore. So please just take the stuff and put it somewhere, anywhere as long as it’s out of my space, and go. I appreciate the effort but it’s really not needed.”
your personal tracking system nor am I Stark’s GPS,” he snapped down the phone. “I’m sure Stark will stumble back home eventually. He’s a grown ass adult. He can take care of himself.”
“Something like that,” Rhodey scoffs as he throws his jacket over the back on a nearby chair. But then he walks over and pulls Tony into a hug and Tony basks in it.
” Tony huffs an empty laugh, thinking back to the day he invited Steve up for a drink and how the first thing he knew they had in common is the last thing they have in common.
When he walks in he expects Tony to be yelling or fighting a nurse or doing the mambo with his ass hanging out the back of his hospital gown. He expects something that would explain why Pepper had hurried off after hours of worry. But, instead he just sees Tony laying on a gurney looking half asleep but no worse for the wear. Steve lets out a sigh of relief.
Tony wants to be scared but Steve is smiling at him and everyone else seems nervous, but happy? Everyone keeps shooting him knowing, half hidden grins as they all pile into the elevator and head downstairs.
? You do realize that I am still your commanding officer, don’t you? And I was doing you a favor. The last time Thor tried to use a toaster he put a hole the size of your big ass head in the wall.”
“Excuse me?” Fury said, head snapping up from where he was looking down at his various screens. “Do firemen consider being able to go back to the firehouse charity?”
When it was Tony’s turn to walk down the aisle after Steve he teared up a little. He’s not going to lie about it. Steve was a little weepy too. It’s totally fine, it’s what people do at weddings and in his defense Steve already looks ridiculously attractive in his dress greens. He’s practically defenseless against the tears.
The gunman behind Tony steps forward and digs the muzzle of his gun into the back of Tony’s head at the same time the guy on the left digs a tiny triangular blade into his shoulder. Tony cries out in pain, apparently loud enough for the microphone to pick it up judging by the way Steve entire body seems to flinch.
“And here I thought I knew everything,” Tony says barely above a whisper, as he looks at Steve watching the movie.
“You had no right to move my stuff,” Steve growls, voice loud and turning into a scream as he swiftly gets his breathing under control. “And you definitely had no right to lock me out of my own storage locker!”
“He’s just coming out of anesthesia,” he says right before he leaves. “He’s a little groggy but you’re welcome to go see him.”
“What?” Steve wonders, slightly dazed and still coming down from the abrupt end to their anticipated blow out.
“And you think it’s a good idea to practice right above Banner’s head?” Fury asked, incredulous with a hand on his hip.
But before Fury could contemplate that further or even get to what he had come here for in the first place he was cut off by Tony’s loud squawk.
Clint nods and Natasha just levels him the same look she gives him anytime he tries to call the shots when they’re not actively in the middle of a battle but she doesn’t say anything against him.
Steve snorts, a snotty, teary snort, but a definite noise of amusement and Tony smiles because if it’s one thing that he’s good at in this relationship it’s his ability to pry a laugh out of Steve at any given moment.
Because that’s Tony’s problem. Or at least one of the top three. He can never leave well enough alone. He always has to push, always have to pursue things, even when he has no right to pursue them. Especially when he has no right to pursue them.
everywhere they go, so Fury’s still confused why that’s the question he blurted out. It’s been a long day. It takes him a few minutes of silence to collect his thoughts.
He trails off as he searches for the right words. Tony meets his eye in the reflection of the mirror and raises an eyebrow as Steve fidgets and flounders.
Steve kisses him first, pinning him to the bed with his comforting weight, before wrapping Tony up in his arms and whispering, “Happy Birthday.”
Steve’s lungs are burning and his knuckles ache. He’s pretty sure that they’re bleeding underneath his hand wraps. He knows that this isn’t exactly healthy behavior but he figures it’s better than screaming at the top of his lungs like he’s been tempted to do lately.
Tony blinks, once, twice, considers pinching himself, and does a double take but still remains unconvinced that the scene before him isn’t an illusion.
“We promised that we’d wait until after the toast,” Bruce reasons, starting to push the turkey away.
The Cyclone comes back around the track, its riders screaming as it makes its drop again. But this time Steve doesn’t look back. This time he follows Tony up to his feet and down towards the water.
“You wanna talk about it?” Steve’s driving them home. They had gone up to Buffalo – far but not too far - for a quiet, snowy weekend and it had been wonderful. But now all Tony can see are icy patches in the dark bends of the road and he feels his heart in his throat. And of course, wonderful Steve doesn’t even have to look at him for more than a moment to know what he’s thinking about.
“Oh my God, guys, no one cares and you’re missing the part where she dies and goes back to the Titanic in heaven.”
Tony nods, seemingly satisfied, and trots away as Steve’s laughs reverberate off the walls and breathe life into the gray monochrome hallways of SHIELD.
“Orange,” Tony huffs as he wanders back into the living area where Steve is perched on his bench, playing with oil colors in an attempt to get just the right shade. “You must love it.”
“Yep,” Steve says with a nod. “And as far as safety goes, Coulson was the lead designer on this so I think it’s as safe as it gets.”
“It almost sounds like you were twenty years old and suddenly lost both of your parents,” Steve says plainly, like it’s fact.
Tony rolls his eyes but pulls Steve closer and into his arms for a dance anyway. “Lying to me about what I’m wearing, already? You’re settling into being a husband nicely.”
“Don’t be sorry,” Betty says, full mega-watt smile back on her face. “My life’s been just fine. Even
“This is actually unacceptable,” Clint says, eyeing all the wide open space. “Well, since you’re embracing the single life then I have no other choice but to get you the largest, raunchiest piece of wall art that I can find.”
Steve can’t sit in the bed anymore. He gets up and looks at Tony but doesn’t approach him, doesn’t know what to do at all. He just stares, pleading with Tony with every fiber of his being.
He’s always thought that he was hot. Fuckable. That had never been an issue. Other than that, he remembers a short period of time where the thought of being in the same room as him had repulsed Tony and then suddenly it hadn’t and then suddenly he was kissing him in the park.
“I’d think of saying sorry,” she says, a little grin pulling at the side of her mouth. “But I don’t think that I’m doing anything particularly stealthy.”
“I don’t want your excuses, Captain!” he screams, “You two are ridiculous! Stark, you are a forty year old man. And you!” he says, pointing at Steve. “You’re ninety! And you’re both in here making out like a bunch of teenagers! Ridiculous! Suit up! Now!”
When he steps into the room, Steve is reading a book held easily in his right hand and looking for all the world like he hadn’t actually almost been ripped in half earlier this afternoon. There’s a thick layer of bandages around his torso and his right leg is in a cast up to his hip, but he doesn’t seem like he’s in pain.
Steve had picked a few issues to throw the weight of his influence behind in his downtime. Whenever he wasn’t actively on a mission he was out working on promoting vaccinations, funding ROTC programs, and fixing the giant mess that was the VA.
She lets out a bubbly, happy laugh at his words and Tony just rolls his eyes and quips, “Traitors, all of you,” before taking the seat next to Clint.
Steve’s little art nook – that’s quickly turning into more of an art studio – up in Tony’s quarters is always the most beautiful at dusk. The sunset fills the sky and paints the room in shades of purple and -
Natasha’s question was a red flag, but Clint’s quickly suppressed look of amusement is a glaring, flashing warning sign that something is afoot. Tony walks closer to look over Natasha’s shoulder and Clint raises his hands in a defensive gesture.
“Touche,” Tony admits. Steve doesn’t respond any further, just raises a hand up to try and push his bangs out of his face. He leaves a trail of pumpkin pulp on his forehead in his wake. Tony wipes it away and presses a kiss there instead. “You think there’s any chance I could learn?”
Before anyone can go to help him, before they can even toss his shield back to him, an electric force field bursts out of the ground and separates Steve from the group and leaves him defenseless. Tony starts to panic for the first time since this whole ordeal started.
Tony proves that he does indeed take his title very seriously that night when orders in practically every dish the Thai restaurant down the block offers while playing “Smells Like Teen Spirit” with a shining disco ball revolving overhead.
“Oh my God, I did not purposefully tell the girl at the bakery to write Happy Birthday Stew,” Clint says, exasperated. “If I was going to risk everyone’s wrath for a prank, it would have to be a lot better than this.”
“Good ol’ SHIELD wants to switch over to clean energy,” Tony says, lifting his hand to show off some rolled up blueprints. “I tried to send Pepper over with the schematics but Fury demanded to see me in person. I really think he’s just trying to annoy me at this point. He made a pun about keeping his eye on me. I mean, really, that just lacks creativity at this stage in our relationship.”
“Tony,” Bruce says, someone finally speaking. “We’re not exactly leading you to your doom here. You can unclench.”
They’ve kissed a grand total of three times. But they’ve never talked about it. They don’t treat each other any differently than they did before they added kissing to their list of shared activities. No one’s certainly asked anyone else out on a date.
He hears the ding of the elevator and he hopes that it’s Natasha or Clint for the sake of his sanity and his temper.
Everyone pauses for a moment and looks at each other like deer in a headlight and it only makes Tony’s anxiety worsen, especially when the response they come up with is “What’re you talking about?” As if, it’s normal to be ladling out gumbo at the foot of Steve and Tony’s bed.
When Steve answers the door he looks shocked for a moment and then supremely confused and a touch uncomfortable. His uncomfortable eyebrow furrow, shuffle combo makes something twist in Tony’s chest and he’s on the edge again. He can’t stand it most days. Can’t stand how awkward things are between them. Some days he just wants to get in Steve’s face and yell at him, tell him that he misses him. He misses his laugh and his strong arms holding him in a real hug and his stupid sense of humor. That he wants nothing more than to have things back the way they were and that there isn’t a minute that goes by where he doesn’t question if breaking things off was really the right thing to do, or if he should’ve worked harder to save them.
He’s happily floating in the in-between, somewhere halfway between wakefulness and sleep, when he feels Steve smile against his neck and he immediately remembers what day it is.
She asks for their store card tremulously and nearly faints when Steve hands it to her with a smile.
“For the next fourteen hours, I’ll allow it,” Steve says lightly. Tony can feel Steve tugging gently on his hip, trying to get Tony to roll onto his back and look him in the eye as he says it. This time, Tony moves.
Tony has a million questions for them. A million things he wants to say. He doesn’t even know where to begin. Even if he did, he can already feel tears in the corners of his eyes and he’s afraid that if he lets himself start talking the waterworks will stop and never end. Instead he settles on stating the obvious fact that he cannot quite wrap his head around.
“Aw, c’mon Tony, it’s poetic,” Clint says. A spray of popcorn shoots out of his hand as he gestures towards the screen.
“Mrs. Banner!” Rhodey says with a grin, laughing as Betty seems to drop all of her bags to the floor at once with one large thump. He and Tony walk over and start scooping groceries into their arms as Betty starts peeling layers off.
With one last swift undercut Tony does get the book out of Steve’s pocket, though he knows that he wouldn’t have stood a chance if Steve didn’t want him to have it on some level. It doesn’t stop Tony from crowing in victory anyway.
century cinema on our frightening obsession with vampires and Tim Burton. That movie was a one off. Trust me. In fact, let me be your 21
Tony waltzes into their bedroom one night and proudly announces, “I’ve made it my new mission in life to get Bruce laid.”
Even with the fighting to temper it, everyone else in the tower is thoroughly done with their sap. Bruce has gone from complaining to glaring to just moving as far as way as possible whenever their chats in the lab turn into making out on the equipment. Thor and Clint have posted a roof time schedule in the common area after walking up there to find Steve and Tony tangled together one too many times. Natasha is thoroughly peeved at having lost half of her sparring time with the only worthwhile partner in the tower because he’s always off on dates.
Yet again, all his worldly possessions are in a box. Two boxes, actually. He’s grown since he’s been here, accumulated more proof that he’s really here. He hadn’t had the heart to take his easel and his art benches. He didn’t want them there taunting Tony though either so he put them away in storage.
