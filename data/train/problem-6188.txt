Tony stretched out his good arm and Steve shook his hand. A handshake didn’t seem right, but he knew it was best not to say anything.
He gave him a quick hug before the brunette left the apartment, leaving Steve to mull over what he had said. He doubted that it would happen, but what if Tony did change his mind? Steve shook the thought out of his head. He wasn’t being realistic. He couldn’t focus on that, anyways. He had to focus on helping rebuild the facility and doing well in his art class – not the ways of Tony Stark’s heart.
After the gallery, they stopped at a pizza place before heading to Tony’s place that he had bought when Pepper and him got divorced. The new place was near Avengers Tower. Tony said that he could walk home, but Steve insisted on taking him home. Tony didn’t protest much, luckily. Steve had hailed a cab and told the driver Tony's address.
Right after the nurse informed him that he was free to move, Steve practically ran out of his room. His body still ached, but he didn’t care. He had to see Tony. He rushed down the hallway to a room that was right next to the elevator. He knocked on the door once before walking into the room. Tony was in his bed, his gaze set on the television that was attached to the wall.
Since he spent most of his day at the site, he barely answered his phone. He knew that he should, but by the time he got home at night, he was exhausted. He just made time enough to grab a quick bite to eat, shower, and go to bed. The next day, he would do the same thing all over again. On the weekends, Steve would work on the drawing that he had done for Tony.
The black car pulled in front of Steve, going a bit too far, before reversing and parking right in front of him. The window rolled down, revealing Tony Stark furrowing his eyebrows at him.
With that, he went inside, eager to spend the evening with Tony. He found Tony waiting next to the doors, a smirk upon his face.
have his outfit lying on the bed, though. The blonde looked at his reflection in the mirror and carded his hands through his hair, smoothing out the sides. Once the stray stands of hair were put in place, Steve sped over to his bed. He glanced at the time. Fifteen minutes before it started.
“Hey, that was different. You were able to see your surroundings. I, on the other hand, cannot see.”
His shoulders stiffened at the thought of Tony setting him up with someone. He trusted Tony’s judgment…but no, he didn’t want him setting him up with anyone. Not just because he thought that the relationship wouldn’t go anywhere, but because…it felt wrong, for some reason. Steve shrugged; he took a swig of his beverage.
“I’d like to help…but I don’t want to lose anything that I have…and would, you know, I would like not to die.”
Steve’s gaze fixed upon the screen. He hadn’t seen Tony since that night where he drawn that art piece for him. What should he do? Certainly he couldn’t see him again. Not after what he thought, what he almost did. But…Bucky had told him to let Tony dictate things. So, did that mean that he should meet Tony for dinner? Steve wasn’t sure how long he stared at the screen for, but eventually he felt his thumbs moving across the screen, tapping letters the letters needed for a message. He sent the message and let out a breath. Well, there went his plan for avoiding Tony.
“I know,” Tony replied. He sighed and leaned back in the couch. His shoulders seem to slump forward. “It’s…just easier to be mad at you than myself.” Tony’s gaze flicked to the blonde. “I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that. I'm not sure what came over me."
He sat on the corner of the couch, a blue blanket draped over his legs, a paperback in his hands. When he decided to read in the living room, he was afraid that it would be busy, but thankfully it was empty. Steve didn’t mind living with the others, but he knew that he would never get to read if they were around. Just as he was about to turn the page, he heard a familiar voice.
Steve shook his head, his gaze not leaving Tony. His eyes raked over Tony; that suit hugged his frame perfectly. He licked his lips and watched the billionaire walk over to the shovel that was leaning against some wooden planks. He picked it up and turned towards the crowd.
The message was sent by Tony. Steve sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. After a few minutes, he typed out his reply.
“No…reach this point – be friends again, talk again. After we fought, I never thought that we'd be doing something like this...I didn't even think we'd talk again."
Tony stayed a little bit after that conversation. Tony asked Steve how he was doing and what he has been up to the past months besides going to the site. Steve asked Tony how Stark Industries was going and if he had created any new inventions. The conversation flowed smoothly, as if they hadn’t just spent six months without talking to each other.
He made his way into the room and sat down in an armchair that sat across from the couch. The guy who had been talking to turned to face him.
His thoughts were cut off by the sudden press of soft lips against his. Steve didn’t know what to do at first, too shocked by what was happening. Within a few seconds, though, Steve kissed the Tony back. His heart beat rapidly in his chest.
Nodding, Steve grabbed another mug from the cabinet and put it on the counter. Not knowing what to say, he focused his gaze on his feet. Despite the fact that they had made up about a week ago, things had still been awkward between the two of them. He supposed that things were less awkward than they had been…but things still weren’t back to the way things used to be, prior to the Avengers splitting up. They weren’t the way Steve wanted them to be. Maybe that was silly of him to think, but since they had made up, the blonde thought that was a reasonable thing to want. After a few moments of silence, Steve looked at Tony, who was staring at a space near Steve’s feet.
It took a bit for them to figure out how to announce that they were together, but when they got a phone call asking them attend a certain event, they knew that would be the event where they broke the news.
His apartment wasn’t very big, but it was big enough for Steve. He probably could’ve gotten a bigger one, but he didn’t really need a lot of space. All he needed was a space where he could eat, sleep, and feel at home. He shut the door behind him and padded over to the family room. The family room was pretty simple: it had a couch, coffee table, television, and bookcases on either side of the television. The bookcases were appallingly empty of books, but Steve had been working on trying to get more. Tony had given him a list of books to read a couple of years back and Steve was still trying to make his way through it. So far, all of the books that he had recommended hadn’t disappointed him.
It probably wasn’t the best thing to send, but Steve sent it anyways. Besides, Tony and him bantered all the time like this prior to their falling out. This was no different than that. He placed his phone back on the end table and went into the bathroom to shower.
Silence fell over them. Steve didn’t know how long they sat there, not saying a word, each of them lost in their own thoughts. He knew that he should say something more, but he didn’t exactly know what else to say. He had basically said everything that he could say. The quiet stretched out for longer, hovering over the table like a cloud that refused to move. Steve tried to break the silence, but every time he opened his mouth, nothing came out.
Before Tony could respond, Steve walked over to the rope that was hanging on the right side of the curtain. He stood to the side of it, his body pivoted towards the crowd. He cleared his throat. The conversations among the crowd dissipated. Tony stood in front of them, his gaze right on Steve. His head was cocked to the side, as if asking:
“I appreciate that.” He looked down at his hands. “Tony…my intention was never to hurt you. I never wanted to do that-”
Since he still had a lot of free time, Steve decided to enroll in an art class. He had been wanting to take one since he was in his 20s, so he decided that it was time. He decided to take an introduction to art class since the school was only a couple of blocks away from his apartment. The classes weren’t mandatory either, so if he had to miss one or two due to work, he wouldn’t be breaking any rules.
Steve winced and stood up. He made his way to the opposite side of the table, across from Tony. He paced back and forth, not knowing what else to do; he couldn’t sit still and talk about this.
A door swung open into the hall. Steve paused just as someone yelled at him to stop looking at his phone while he was walking. He glanced up at the person – a woman who had blonde hair.
“Well...yeah. I actually came back here though when I heard that you were missing. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew with you gone…someone would need to lead the fight here. I wasn’t sure if we should come here though.” Tony’s lips pursed into a thin line.  “Sorry, I don’t mean to bring this up, I can change the topic.” He knew that Tony didn’t like talking about what happened on Titan, which he understood. Losing Peter had been devastating for him.
“That won’t happen. Besides…I’ll be right there with you. No matter what happens, we'll get through it together.”
“Yes, there is,” Tony said. “I know that we were growing closer before the time heist and then after…I just kind of disappeared for a bit. That wasn’t right of me.”
“I don’t know…I mean,” He shrugged. “You can hang out with people who are more interesting than me, cooler than me.”
About ten days after that, Steve’s plan of Avoiding Tony Stark was put to a halt. Steve glanced up from his laptop, unable to believe his ears.
Steve stared at him phone. He wasn’t against that idea, but he didn’t know if it would be the smartest thing to do. But then again, Tony was specifically asking him to come here. Maybe he didn’t feel safe to talk about whatever he wanted to talk about in public.
Finally, the class ended. Steve shoved his sketchbook back into his bag and practically ran out of the door. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and glanced at the text.
He brushed passed a few people that were standing in front of the curtain, waiting for the big reveal. Steve’s breathing started to pick up; his palms began to sweat. Maybe this was a bad idea of a first date. A movie would have been a lot less nerve-wracking. He glanced at Tony, whose gaze was still on the curtain. Steve's mouth twitched as he watched him. This man had come here because he trusted Steve; he had accompanied him without knowing anything about tonight. If Tony could do that…well, he could do this. He leaned over so he could speak into Tony’s ear without others overhearing.
Steve exhaled slowly and rolled his shoulders back. He could do this. It didn’t have to be perfect, it just had to be close to that. Nodding to himself, Steve picked up a pencil and began to shade.
“Thank you all for being here today,” Steve started. “Tonight we are celebrating the new Avengers facility, which is comprised of two buildings. There is a building that will act as a home for the Avengers and another one that will act as a workplace for those who work with the Avengers. Today, Tony Stark,” he gestured at Tony. “...and I would officially like to open the facility.”
The art class passed slowly because Steve kept thinking about whether or not Tony had texted him. He could just check his phone in class, but he didn’t want to do that. The teacher had said during the first day of class that it was against the rules. Huffing, Steve focused back on what the teacher was saying, the eraser of his pencil bouncing off of his sketchbook.
“And then we got a call from Bruce- he called us using the phone I gave you.” He bit his lip. “So we decided to go back here and we figured out a plan. After that we went to Wakanda…and well, you know the rest.”
He squeezed Steve’s hand, which helped some of the tension in his shoulders melt away. Tony was right – it would be okay. At least, he hoped that it would be.
“I know that you said that I didn’t have to bring anything but I felt like it would be rude to not bring anything. So…I got this. It has sausage and onion on it.”
Bucky nodded. “And I’m glad for that. When you were talking about him, I kept waiting for you to tell me that you had feelings for him, but you never mentioned it. The other day I asked Nat if you had talked about it with her but she told me that you never did.”
He shrugged off his jacket before he sat down on the chair. Steve couldn’t help it – he stared a bit. Tony was wearing a blue button-down shirt that hugged his arms in a way that clothing shouldn’t be able to. And the thing that made it worse was, Steve had sworn that he, himself, had worn a similar type of shirt on the first day of class this year. Had Tony copied his look, too? Or took inspiration from it? The thought made Steve's mouth turn up to a faint smile.
“There is one more thing,” Tony said loudly, turning back to the crowd. He moved towards the podium. The applause almost immediately stopped. Steve walked over to Tony so he was standing next to him. “…that I’d like to say.” Steve’s breathing picked up. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other. Tony glanced at him. Steve swallowed thickly and nodded. He felt Tony’s fingers lace through his own. “There have been a lot of rumors about our dating lives, whether we are dating each other or other people. Today, we’d like to make a statement.” He lifted their hands so the crowd to see. Steve kept his gaze fixed on Tony. “The rumors are right - Steve and I are dating."
He glanced at the clock and groaned; the event was in twenty minutes and Steve was still not on his way. He wasn’t even dressed yet - he had just gotten out of the shower. He
“Upset me? Oh, no. I didn’t care about you talking about one of your friends. I was glad for it. When we were kids…you didn’t have many friends. You acted like you didn’t need them, but I knew that you wanted them. When you started to talk about the Avengers, especially Tony, I realized that you had finally had found somewhere where you belong.”
“Idiot,” Steve muttered. He carded his hand through his hair. He picked up his phone again and sent another message.
Bucky glanced at the ceiling before looking back at him. “You’re a fool for realizing this when he’s married.”
The answer should’ve made Steve feel lighter, happier. After all, he had found out the answer to Tony’s question. Unfortunately, the answer didn’t make him feel any better. Why should it? It was a person he couldn’t have. Twice in a row, he seemed to have waited too long for the person who he was interested in. He couldn't believe it. How could he have messed up
But not in the same way that Steve was expecting. Normally, Tony sat near the back of the room, with some of his other friends while Steve sat in the front row. Steve liked the front row – it helped him focus better. That wasn’t what happened today, though. Oh, no.
Shaking his head, he got up and moved to the couch, sketchbook in hand. Maybe changing location would help. He turned on some music and settled into a corner of the couch, his knees drawn close to his chest, his sketchbook resting on his thighs. He made a small line with his pencil, but stopped. No, he wasn’t going to draw the bowl. His assignment would be late, but he wasn’t going to force himself to draw something that just made him want to punch something. To scream. He was going to draw what he wanted.
Thankfully, Steve didn’t have to give his speech right away. Happy told him that they’d let their guests find mingle for a few minutes before Steve stepped up the podium. That was surprising to Steve since that wasn’t originally how they had planned the event, but he wasn’t complaining. Since he had more time, Steve walked around the room, talking to some of the people who had helped plan the rebuilding of the Avengers facility. The conversations were brief, but the tension in his shoulders seemed to melt a bit as he got to know the people that he would be addressing.
“You know, that’s exactly what I was thinking,” Steve said, smiling softly at him. “Actually…there’s something I want to show you.”
Sending that message should’ve made Steve feel better, but it didn’t. Now he just felt like more of a fool. He should’ve just waited until his other drawing was done and sent that. But…he couldn’t change it now. Sighing, he stood up from the couch and went into his bedroom. He quickly changed into shorts and a t-shirt. Grabbing his keys, he left his apartment, leaving his phone in the living room.
Steve sat down; his smile faded. Now It was obvious to him why he wasn’t able to forget little details like this about Tony. At first, he thought it was just him being a good friend, but now…he thought that maybe he remembered these things for a different reason. A deeper one. One that he had been too oblivious to see. It was still baffling that he hadn't realized his feelings for so long. They were so apparent to him now. He sighed deeply; well, there wasn't anything he could do about now. He gazed into his coffee, lost in his thoughts. A moment passed; he thought that he heard Tony say something, but the sound was muffled, background noise.
An answer to the question that had been on his mind for weeks came one month after their talk. His text was the same as it had been that night– if Steve and him could talk. Steve, of course, said yes.
“In my letter?” Steve let out a short laugh. “No…I wasn’t. I knew that I had messed up…but I still cared about you, Tony. I wanted you to know that I would be there for you whenever you needed me.”
“Are you kidding me? This is so much better than going to a board party. All of the talk about business would’ve been unbearable.” Tony shuddered.
That morning, Steve went to the kitchen around five. He buzzed around the kitchen, preparing pancakes, sausages, and coffee. Otherwise known as Tony’s favorite breakfast. Now, there was a chance that Tony wouldn’t eat breakfast if he wanted to get to work straight away, but he figured that he could always bring him breakfast if he didn’t stop by the kitchen first.
Tony arrived several minutes after Steve thought that he would. Steve assumed that he would be late, but he didn’t think that he’d be this late. Not that Tony was actually that late. He got to Steve’s apartment fifteen minutes after 7.
“Where are we going?” Tony asked. “Not that I don’t like being driven to a random location while being blindfolded. I’d just like to know.”
“Got some brain food,” Tony said, smirking at them. He placed it on the coffee table before taking a seat next to Steve. “And now the study session can begin.”
Just as Steve had expected, the ‘get-together’ was a party. There was music, drinking, and dancing. Dancing. Steve shuddered at the thought. The only positive, he supposed was, that there weren’t as many people at the party that he had thought that there would be. And even though there was music, it wasn’t obscenely loud. He could actually talk to people without having to scream over the music.
Six weeks later, Steve still felt the same way. He had been afraid that the feeling might go away, but it didn’t. He simply became more and more certain that Tony was the missing piece of his heart, his other half. They still obviously had their disagreements and viewed things in different ways, but somehow, it worked. Perhaps it was because by now, they knew each other well - they knew when to give the other space and when to be there for the other. They were like opposite sides of the same coin. Tony had told Steve that one night after their one-month anniversary (Tony had surprised him with a dinner at a restaurant that had just opened and a carriage ride in the park) and Steve couldn’t get out of his mind; he thought that it was a beautiful way to describe them.
“While Stark Industries has agreed to help fund the building, it has been decided that since Stark Industries has already invested so much money into the Avengers, it will not sponsor the whole endeavor. Which is why we decided to hold this gala. We’d like to raise money to help cover some of the functioning cost of the facility once it is built. We'd also like to raise money for charities that are in New York City. While we have tried to protect the city, we'd like to do more than just protect it- we'd like to raise money for it. Seventy-five percent of all proceeds of this event will go to charity. The other twenty-five percent will go towards the Avengers facility. If you want to participate in this endeavor, there are gift baskets along the wall that you can bid on. If you prefer to donate money directly, please talk to Happy.”
“I was attempting to try to help you feel better, but I guess my attempts are futile.” He raised his shoulders and let them go with a sigh.
Steve’s blushed deepened. “I wanted to.” Steve knew that this wasn’t a date or anything, but he had wanted to do something nice for Tony, especially after all the trouble that he had put him through. Tony seemed speechless for a moment; he opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out.
The blonde furrowed his eyebrows. What did he mean by that? Of course it was surprising. Steve didn't think that they would ever get divorced. But, here Tony was, insinuating that Steve somehow knew that this would happen.
Steve knew that he could contact Tony, but he wasn’t sure if he should. When they parted last semester, Tony had said that they would have ‘hang out’ in the fall. Steve took that to mean that Tony would contact him.
Steve glanced at the people on the couch again. To his surprise, they weren’t staring at him. Yes, they were looking at him, but they didn’t look at him as if he had just committed some serious crime.
seemed to like the drawing that day. Surely he would like it now that Steve had completed it. Those thoughts didn’t stop Steve from pacing in the hall in front of his front door, though. Steve nearly jumped upon hearing someone knock on the door. Swearing, he walked over to the door and opened it.
Most of the first year of law school was a blur. Steve was too busy getting acclimated to everything to really concentrate on the people who were in his classes or any ‘extracurricular’ activities. It’s not that Steve wasn’t interested in those things, he was just too busy focusing on, well, getting good grades. Law school was competitive, and he didn’t want to ruin his future by focusing too much on ‘fun’ things. Bucky, the one friend who he had made during the first year, made sure that Steve didn’t waste countless hours studying. Whenever Steve was locked up in his apartment for too long, he’d drag him out and they’d do something – like go to a pub or go to the movies. Even when Steve didn’t want to do those things, Bucky made sure that Steve didn’t overwork himself. And, as much as Steve liked to complain about him forcing him to go out, he did appreciate it. He knew that he needed to get out every once in a while.
Steve smiled softly and started to carefully place the portrait within the frame, careful not to cause any creases in the paper. He pressed the back of the frame into place and held the portrait up to Tony, silently asking him what he thought of it.
Steve's eyebrows knitted together as he thought about the question, which had caught him a bit off guard. His first thought was no, that there wasn’t anyone that he had his eyes on. But, that didn’t seem quite right. It was as if he felt like there was someone that he was interested in. Steve wasn't sure though, if he was interested in someone, who that person would be.
Steve forced himself to shrug his shoulders and go back to reading. Steve tried to read, but the words were meaningless to him. His mind wouldn’t stop replaying Bucky’s words. Tony had texted him. Why? Why did Tony care so much about being friends with him? He was Tony Stark; he could be friends with anyone. Steve was a nobody. But…clearly Tony had some interest in him. Him. Steve Rogers. Still, he couldn’t understand what Tony would find so appealing about him. But still…Tony must’ve found something appealing about him. A small smirk curled Steve’s lips upwards. Tony Stark found him a least a bit interesting. And no matter how scared Steve was about letting Tony learn more about him, he was pleased that Tony at least liked him a tiny bit.
“I suppose that’s fair.” Tony’s gaze flicked to him. “Can we at least talk – like friends- in the meantime?”
Here's the next chapter! I really hope that you guys enjoy it. Also, thank you so much for taking the time to read this story; it really means a lot to me.
to be a great friend to Tony. He didn't want to let him down again. He pushed his mug away from him and took out his wallet.
“I never went anywhere without it, to be honest,” Tony said. “Over the first year, I had no desire to call you, but I still kept it with me.”
The waitress came back to their table with a basket of garlic bread. The aroma of garlic and butter weaved its way into the air. Oh, god, it smelled delicious. The waitress looked at Steve and asked, with a wink, if she could get him anything. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony’s mouth purse into a thin line. Well, that was certainly interesting. Steve switched his attention back to her and grinned.
“Ah, that.” Tony said; he picked up a flute of champagne off of the bar. “I did have a function to go to but that wasn’t as important as this.”
The crowd erupted into applause. Steve smiled at the crowd and he made his way to his seat at the table. Some people got up from their seats and went over to the gift baskets. Happy turned to him.
The night went quickly, much to Steve's surprise. Steve had thought that with all of the speeches and food courses, it would’ve dragged on, but it didn’t; each speech was somehow the perfect length and the food courses seemed to appear within minutes after they had finished with the previous course. The conversation at the table wasn’t horrible, either. It seemed to flow smoothly and everyone was included in it. Steve even talked more than he thought he would. When he had finished his dessert, though, he didn't feel the need to stay. Tony and Pepper were talking to each other near the table and only a few people remained at the table.
Tony nodded and walked to the front door, Steve on his heels. Steve opened the door for him, allowing Tony to pass. The brunette turned around to face him.
Oh…well, that question was surprisingly simple. Steve had thought that Tony would ask him a much more serious question than that.
he thought to himself. He forced himself to walk through the crowd, nodding to people as he passed. He probably should talk to some of them, but he had to check to make sure the ballroom was prepared for the event. He turned the corner, going down the hallway that led to the Grand Ballroom. Thankfully, it was much less crowded than the lobby. Steve exhaled softly and slipped into the room, shutting the doors behind him. The function technically didn’t start for another five minutes, so the room was empty. He glanced around the room; his lips parted. It looked stunning.
? He could’ve said anything else, but he had to say “of course” like he had been waiting to be reunited with him.
A silver car was waiting for him right outside of his apartment – he had called one before he got in the shower. He got in and told the driver the address of the function.
Tony closed whatever he was working on – it looked like a new Iron Man suit and glanced at him. “We can talk about it right now.”
A few moments later, the door opened. Tony was wearing a black t-shirt with the letters “AC-DC” on the front. He was wearing faded jeans. An outfit that Steve had never seen before. He tried to pry his eyes away from him, but he couldn’t. There was something about the clothing that just…suited Tony.
Steve walked to the front door of the apartment with Tony trailing him. They didn’t say anything, each content in their own thoughts. Steve paused by the front door and looked at him.
Tony peeled away from the wall and smirked. “Glad to hear that.” He glanced at the hostess who had just returned to her stand. “Table for two, please.”
He had originally wanted to sit outside, but it was raining today. Steve made his way inside and sat at a table that was placed in front of the windows that lined the front of the shop; he watched people pass while he waited for Tony. A bit later, when there was still no sign of Tony, Steve glanced at his watch. Fifteen minutes late. Steve muttered to himself about how he couldn't believe Tony was late. He took out his phone so he could text him, ask him where he was. Right when he was about to send the message, the bell attached to the front door chimed. His gaze lifted to the door; Tony walked in, sporting a leather jacket, a light blue shirt, and dark wash jeans. For a moment, Steve just looked at him, unable to pull his gaze away. He knew that it wasn’t nice to stare, but he couldn’t stop. Somehow, Steve seemed to snap out of his stupor.
Yes, but not with other people. Well. He walked with Bucky, but they were roommates. That was to be expected. But with other people? Especially Tony? At 10 o’clock at night? No, that didn’t happen. Ever.
One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes passed. Steve stared at Tony, wondering if he ever was going to speak. If he wasn’t…well, he’d want a cue so he could just leave. And never bother him again. He opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off before he could.
Although Steve had Tony’s number in his phone now, he refused to call him. Not because Tony had done anything wrong – he just met the guy – he didn’t know much about him. No, Steve was worried that somehow that he would annoy him. After all, this was Tony Stark…he had better things to do than talk to some average Brooklyn kid.
Steve stared at the phone, completely in shock by what just happened. Well…this would certainly be interesting.
The memory brought a smile to Steve’s face. Now, hopefully, Tony would never have to ask this question again; he would know that Steve trusted him, no matter what happened between them.
“Tony,” Steve said, his voice barely audible. He wiped his eyes again. “You didn’t have to come here if this is how you felt.” It was probably a dumb thing to say seeing as Tony decided to help out with the mission, but he didn’t know what else to say.
“It’s fine. Work was boring. The board kept telling me that I was wrong about my calculations for a new project we have coming up - we’re investing in solar technology for buildings – but when they finally allowed me to do the calculations in front of them, they agreed with me.”
No, this couldn’t be happening again. Steve shook his head and stared at his lap. No - no. It couldn't be. He had done everything
He set up an easel in the living room once the room was clean. Clean wasn’t even an accurate description of how clean the room was; the room was immaculate. The pillows on the couch were perfectly arranged, one resting in front of each couch cushion. The television didn’t have any dust on it and the screen had been wiped clean. The hardwood floors gleamed under the bright lights. The normally covered with textbooks coffee table was clear, save for a series of pencils that Steve needed to do his sketching of Tony. And, near the coffee table, there was a chair that Steve had brought in from the kitchen so he could sit there while he drew Tony. He stood near the door of the family room, looking at the state of the room. Yes, this should be good enough. If Tony had a problem with it…well, he didn’t know what else he could clean.
“I’m glad that you do,” Steve replied; he finally looked up at him. Tony smiled softly at him before letting his hand drop from Steve’s shoulder. “Do you want me to put it in a frame?” The blonde took step back, creating some distance between them.
Tony took Steve's cock in his mouth, sucking hard.  When Steve began to groan, low and imploring, Tony stopped abruptly, letting Steve fall wetly from his mouth.  “Tell me, my son, what you thought about when you, ah, ‘self-abused’?”
“Okay,” Steve sighed, “Okay.  Just so long as you aren’t leaving because of the name thing.  Because I told you that was fine.”
“God damn it,” Tony threw up his hands, “I told them the bar was humans only.  After New Year’s, those drunks are strictly BYOB. Alright, Pep.  I’ll handle it.  I’ll march their happy asses back across the Bifrost on a liquor run if I have to.”
“147, come on down!” Tony said, doing his best Rod Roddy, and bounced to his feet, “You got the marriage license?”
He let his clothes drop to the floor and crawled naked into the bed, pulling the cold sheets up all the way to his chin.  To his dismay, his nipples stiffened under the slide of the cold cotton, so he flopped over on his stomach, burying his face in the pillow, willing his body to just--just--liquefy or implode or dematerialize or something.  Anything.
“No.  The bottle in the back of the refrigerator was six months past the expiration date, and I threw it out.”
“Oh, well,” Steve placed his napkin on the table, standing, “good, because I made a cake.  Would you like coffee, too, or--” Tony grabbed his wrist before he could actually leave.
“Where’s my shoe, Rogers?” Tony was still going for light, but only managed irritable. “Goddamn it, you really want me to wait out on the street in one shoe?”
“Don't . . . don't do that, Steve,” Tony murmured, suddenly and truly overwhelmed by exhaustion but still scrabbling at waking anxieties, “I bet I stink. I didn’t shower. I was going to.”
Steve released Tony’s shoulders with a furious groan.   Tony was impossible.  Why couldn’t he understand how stupid, how dangerous--Steve could feel a rising tide of anger and fear in his throat.  He felt, he felt--
Tony, in the living room, was pouring a scotch even larger than the previous one. “You can’t be Steven Stark,” he snapped, “it’s ridiculous.”
Forty-five minutes later, Tony was vomiting in a rose bush.  He heaved up the last of the boozy-smelling bile while on his hands and knees and then rolled onto his back in the grass.  He fervently hoped he would just die.  Machine vision was at eight am on Monday, and he was pretty sure he could never show his face there again.  That meant he’d have to drop.  And
The workshop door opened with a quiet hiss, and Pepper’s high heels clicked hesitantly across the concrete.  “Tony?”  Her voice was soft, and when she got close, she smelled like perfume and espresso.  “Tony, I brought you a coffee.”  She set it down gently on the desk.  Her nails, he noticed, were painted the palest shade of petal pink, the color so delicate that it was barely there at all.  It was the first time in his recollection that Pep’s nail color had felt like a metaphor for his state of being.  It seemed like a bad sign.  He reached for the coffee.
Center-stage, Tony was standing with his back to the audience, singing coyly over one narrow shoulder as he delivered his final note.  It was met with a chaos of hoots and applause, and he smiled brightly.  As he turned to exit the platform and caught Steve’s eye, the smile turned incandescent.  He practically skipped off-stage.  Steve wasn’t sure how to take it.
them quickly, eager to burn them. His face looked a bit cynical. He knows how sweet and daring he was towards her in these letters. And, he also knows how betrayed she felt when she found out about his affairs while re – reading his letters. Peter is eager and desperate to act her role in his current era.
“So, young one, where exactly are you taking us? Son of Stark had only given us little information.” Thor questioned curiously. Ned had to hold himself back from fan boy – ing when the Norse God asks him personally. He had to be professional in front of Peter’s family after all. Even if they’re the Avengers.
“Heck yeah we should, do you have any plans?” Clint was the first one to registered Tony’s suggestion after his sudden outburst. Bruce walking behind Tony — where they had just done some
“Heh, can’t wait to see Flash’s reaction when the team got their hands on him—” MJ said but was cut off by Ned.
! Yeah, try not to create a ruckus—we'll catch up in a bit. Please follow me, Mr. Stark and Mr. Banner.” Ned swiftly led the two geniuses from the group. Tony took this chance to circle his hand on Bruce's shoulder.
He throws those half – burn letters to Flash’s direction as his tears falls from his cheeks beautifully.
’ on their faces, enough to make people scramble themselves away from them. But MJ, calm and amused MJ, only snickers quietly as her smirk widens.
Peter’s expression turns grim, staring daggers at Flash. His eyes narrow in despise at the sight in front of him. Flash was frowning. There were so little hurt and guilt on his face but somehow fear and alarm was visible. Peter inwardly hums in confusion.
—!” Thor stood up in anger but was forced to sit down by two power sources. The two – magic wielder cast off their spells releasing a sigh. Loki and Stephen glares at him in annoyance.
, just this time.” Peter whispers in desperation. He didn’t know why, but he needs to do his best. And so is Flash.
? I was not aware of what you’re planning?” Bruce fix his glasses up, staring at Tony for his answer.
Peter and Flash are on their position, the Orchestra are in place, those animatic holograms are set and Peter’s letters are gripped tightly in his hands.
“Tony… We had just finished our fight against Thanos, don’t bring more trouble, please.” Rhodey looks up from his newspaper, narrowing his eyes at Tony in slight plead.
Silence fills the air in the VIP spot. The guys of the team seem confused. But the girls? They kept their silent façade until Gamora screams in outrage.
His expression turned hard, from the unknown source and Peter’s glare full of fury. They kept standing face to face as the circle – floor under them moves clockwise.
Peter continues to turn clockwise, this time seeing themselves hand in hand, at their supposed marriage scene. He couldn’t help but cringed inwardly at the sight.
you all can be.” Bruce fixes his glasses in its position, glancing not so secretly to the noisy ones.
“Pardon me, I may have heard wrong but did you just say that Peter had his eyes on someone?” He inquires in a strained tone. The look on the Avengers faces would make anyone shivers in fear. They all had the ‘
“Count me in.” Natasha, Clint, Bucky and Rocket said at the same time. They have the same murder intent after all, that makes sense.
is not worth Peter’s attention or love.” Clint following Scott’s move, flipping the bird at Flash with both hands, gritting his teeth tightly.
, drowning each other with so much delight. Peter’s glare is locked on Flash as his expression turns furious. The same can be said about the Avengers.
“What did he announce to the world? …It must’ve been something bad, isn’t it?” T’Challa said softly.
!” Peter suddenly sneezes, surprising the heck out of everyone. He wipes his nose unconsciously, thinking that his body temperature must’ve dropped for him to sneeze out of nowhere like that.
“Why didn’t he tell us? Was it supposed to be a secret?” Rhodey wonders as he pats Tony on the back to calm him down.
She left the Balconies in a hurry pace at the same time Tony and Bruce came back from their tinkering. Ned greets her quickly before turning to the team.
The guys looked at one another in confusion, some trying to held their respective girl teammates from attacking the ‘
He took another step backwards, still eyeing Flash who’s currently shivering in reflex. The drums are in sync with his lines as the beats was played along with the song.
“Yeah, some people do tend to bully the person they care about, huh… I guess this applies to you, Sam.” Scott being experience with parenting agreed with Bucky about Sam’s way of showing endearment. Sam looked offended but the slight blush gave it away.
Peter points at the corner at the room, not caring where he stood. He walks away from Flash once again. His expression turned dark and menacing. Just how he looked at those villains he fought during his time as Spiderman. In which made Flash jerks in surprise. This is the first time he saw those threatening looks on Peter.
. Do not proceed with your mission!” Steve yelled cautiously, seeing his best friend going all Winter Soldier mode.
!” The Co – Director grumbles at the Director annoyingly in which he only returns with a small chuckle. He waved his hand calmly to the actors while being dragged away by the Co – Director forcefully out of the set.
!” Peter answers across the room, already in his place. Ned and MJ went away from the stage to avoid any unwanted crash.
“Yeah, does he not tell what he’s called at school? Heh, figures.” MJ smirks in satisfaction. Peter was sure shy and embarrassed as hell when he mentions him being the baby of the family. So, it’s only natural that he would absolutely hide those adorable and sweet nicknames from the Avengers.
But despite his furious and soul – breaking glare, he can’t help but teared up at the emotions that overwhelms him.
Peter slip his right hand in his pocket, grabbing several already opened letters in his hand. He eyes the letter with earnest. After all, they decided to print off the real letters from him to her during their time in the past. He can also picture how betrayed and livid she must be when she found out about his affairs. Peter flips them all, walking around aimlessly, gently brushing his hands against them.
.” Was the mutual response from all of them, much to Tony annoyance. This earns an irritated smirk from Tony.
“Yeah, and when a Stark is happy someone else suffers.” Natasha comments casually, still sharpening her knives smoothly.
“I dunno, but hey, it’s Peter you’re talking about, he always succeeds our expectation. Why wouldn’t he this time?” MJ replies calmly. Ned sighs in relief.
“Not only his relationship, you’ve also critically damaged his heart and feeling.” Vision narrows his eyes at Flash.
“I know that! Do you guys think I’m out of my mind to actually trick you into a trap or something?” Tony scowls offended.
—!” He jerks at the cold sensation. He turns to see the Director smiling to him in his carefree aura.
“Yesh, slow down Rhodes—I’m getting to that.”, Tony revealed the ticket’s appearance—showing a theater and musical notes on its surface. “So, what do you say about seeing a
“I know that,” Tony sighed, “And, these days, I’m trying real hard to make the good stuff outweigh everything else, but there is a
temporary.  It was, I don’t know, some sort of gag booze that Sif had. You should see Thor’s tits.  They’re humongous.  Waaay bigger than mine.  But the effects only last as long as the buzz, and I only had a sip.  I’ll be back *
“It means the name “Stark” is a disaster.  It means one match and the whole place goes down in flames.  It means Howard and his piss-poor fathering.  And Obie’s war-profiteering.  And my fucking terrible reputation.  And all the money and fame and scandal and accompanying bullshit--”
“I did beg.  I just never thought he’d say ‘yes.’  High school girls love me, Rhodey,” he lamented, “They
The song ended, and the strains of “Careless Whisper” began.  She took his hand and started to pull him through the crush of undergraduates.  The gods were definitely smiling; the sight of her mini-skirted ass weaving through the crowd was almost enough to make him swear off liquor for life.  Almost.
“Sir, you consumed 4 whiskey sours and a martini, totaling approximately six standard servings of liquor, plus small quantities of several alien beverages of unknown chemical composition and potency.”
“It’s called ‘jacking off,’ Steve.  Or hadn’t they invented it yet, back in your day?”  Tony’s hand pumped up and down languidly.  The tip of Steve’s cock was leaking pre-cum now; it was almost too easy.
“That was--that was completely different,” Steve sputtered, feeling himself going red in the face.  “You know I didn’t drink--it was the War!  It wasn’t something I did for fun, Tony.  It was something I did for my country, for--”
Steve blinked at him across the long moment of silence that followed.  “You’re serious, aren’t you?”  He said finally, his voice inflected with gentle wonder.
“You’re not angry,” Tony murmured.  And while he wasn’t entirely convincing, Steve decided it was about as good as it was likely to get.
“And I didn’t brush my teeth.”  The heat of Steve’s body, the fingers in his hair--Tony felt as if he were being pulled under.
“Tony,” Steve said, “please say something.” And then, just like that, he knew exactly what he wanted:
Steve spent a couple of hostile, anxious minutes on the sofa, alternatingly cursing at and praying for Tony, and alternatingly cursing at and praying for himself
“Oh,” Tony made his way across the living room, “AND,” he said, wandering through into the dining room, “I am crazy jet-lagged from the--” his mouth wound down and sputtered to a stop. There were flickering candles and a starched tablecloth, places set with china and silver.  Appetizing smells wafted from the sideboard from several covered dishes.  He took a drink, considered the scene, and pushed through the swinging door into the kitchen, “You’re cooking dinner.”
“Some party,” Bruce slid up quietly beside him, folding his arms on the balcony rail.  He eyed Steve up and down, then asked, “Lumberjack?”
Tony’s face was inscrutable.  Steve continued, “You’re my other half, my team, and I thought that sharing a name would be nice.  Old-fashioned, sure, but there’s a reason people have traditions.”
Just like this fire-cracker was whipping them now.  When she reached the chorus, something about material girls or material worlds or maybe both, Steve thought they might mob the stage.  She was magnetic; even Steve could not take his eyes off of her.  And when she threw her head back, exposing the white column of her throat, and let loose a string of orgasmic little yips, Steve felt each one in the pit of his stomach.  Or maybe somewhere lower.  In any case, she made him squirm.  He leaned towards Bruce, “What’s she supposed to be?”
of everything else.  And, Steve, while I’m happy that you’ve come to terms with your shit childhood, I still fucking
Steve considered this.  While he was reluctant to hold Tony’s phone for ransom, Steve could also recollect their last serious disagreement in glorious Technicolor. The raised voices, followed by days of radio silence while Tony ducked his phone calls, Jarvis instructed not to let him in the penthouse elevator . . . They only made up a week later because Steve, a man who recognized the occasional need for dramatic gestures, stormed past a dozen secretaries and practically beat down the door of Tony’s office during an investors’ briefing.  Even then, it hadn't really blown over until the make-up sex.
“And yet,” Tony pressed his palm to Steve’s groin, “still somehow effective.  Must be my boyish charm.  Would sex count as points, by the way?”  He squeezed gently at the semi-hard bulge in Steve’s pants and smiled, looking pleased with himself.
“Nothing.  Well, nothing you won’t like.  I’m gonna prove you like ‘em slutty, Cap.” Tony pressed an index finger was over Steve’s lips, shushing him before Steve had uttered even one syllable of protest.
“Now hear this: I’m going home to sleep in my own bed, Rogers, and if I pick up tetanus or worms or whatever from the sidewalk because I’m missing a shoe, it’s your fault!”  As he spun on his heel to stalk out, Steve glimpsed the phone in the back pocket of his jeans.
“I thought about guys, sometimes,” he finally panted, “but mostly girls. Well, this one girl, really.  I thought about her all the time.  She was just a knock-out--a few years older than me, worked at the drugstore.  Big . . . well, you know.  She had dark hair that she always wore up, and she always wore red lipstick.  And she, uh, it seemed like she went with a lot of guys.”
“I’d never let a girl walk home alone.  Campus is a dangerous neighborhood.  Last week, I got mugged by a kid with a slide-rule.”
Tony snatched the remote off the coffee table and switched off the television.  Steve could make out his unhappy face in the dark, each miserable line picked out in the blue light of the arc reactor.   “So that’s why, Steve,” he confessed, “That’s why you can’t be a Stark.  Because I barely want to be a fucking Stark.  I mean, other than the obscene amounts of money and fame,” he laughed bitterly, “there just aren’t many perks.”
“May I say something?”  Steve asked.  Tony waved a permissive hand.  “Okay, yes, all those things you said, those are associated with the name ‘Stark.’  But so is the arc reactor.  So is Iron Man.  It’s not just bad things, Tony; it’s good things, too.  Amazing things.”
“Well,” said Rhodey, “at least this is your last semester as Statutory Rape Bait.  We can all legally nail you come August.”
“It’s in the box of Christmas ornaments,” Steve called to his retreating back, “On top of the armoire.  You’ll need a chair.”  There was swearing from the next room.
The next day, Steve spent his morning and part of his afternoon at the construction site for the facility. He hadn’t done much building, but he helped supervise different teams of people. When he arrived that the facility, he had wanted to get rid of some of the extra energy that had been buzzing through his body, but Happy told him no. So Steve spent most of the day supervising. When Happy wasn't around though, Steve had snuck in some building in here and there though, which seemed to help dissipate some of his nerves.
Steve stood there, watching Tony disappear at the top of the stairs, unsure of what he had just gotten himself into. He could’ve said no, he supposed, but Tony seemed so excited about it, he hadn't wanted to turn him down. Besides, he may have been reading too much into Tony’s behavior. He and Tony were friends again, so maybe he just wanted to spend more time with him. Yeah, that was probably it. Steve nodded to himself and walked into the dark night.
He pulled on the rope and the curtain swept to the side, revealing four pieces of art work that lined the wall horizontally. The first piece was of the Avengers sitting in the living room of Avengers Tower, each of them doing something different. Clint was practicing throwing darts with Natasha. Bruce was reading a science book on the couch. Thor was fiddling with a guitar that Tony had bought recently. Tony and Steve sat on the couch, books on their laps, heads turned towards each other.
Steve continued, pointedly ignoring the interruption, “And he was telling me about how when he and his wife got married, there was a big discussion as to how the minister would present them at the end of the ceremony, whether they would be Mr. and Mrs. Barton, or Mr. and Mrs. Clint Barton, or whether she would keep her maiden name, or--” he stopped, doubtless because Tony’s eyes had started to glaze over.  Tony’s attention was recaptured when Steve grabbed his hand. “Listen, Tony,” Steve said, in his most earnest, apple-pie, Captain America tone, “I love you more than anything.  And, if it’s alright with you, I’d like to take your name.”
“You think too much, Tiger. Just go with the flow and you’ll be fine.” Another voice spoke causally from behind him.
“We’re just a bit curious, that’s all.” Steve smiles feigning innocent, but his body language screams protectiveness.
“I must thank you for the hospitality you’ve shown. And Tony's extravagant needs.” Vision express his gratitude, which earns several nods and agreement. In which Tony scoffed at, he wasn’t that troublesome.
“Ah, Mr. Stark! Welcome! I’ve been waiting for you.” Ned said quickly. Tony glance at him as he walks to the younger teen.
“Why not just do both and all of us will be happy.” Bucky agrees darkly, knuckling his fingers slowly.
your ancestors to the eighteenth generation!” Scott joins in the heated protest, flipping the bird to Flash.
Flash appearance was in distress. The cause came from several directions and the impact is crushing him so much that he has trouble breathing properly and cold sweats running down his cheeks.
“Anyway, does this thing you’re planning had anything to do with the little squirt? If it is I’m sure as hell will be joining you.” Sam snickers in amusement. I mean, pranking Peter is one of the most amusing and fun thing he’ll ever done as an Avengers besides fighting aliens.
The others did not argue as they too, enters the building. Halfway to the center of the Theater, Thor speaks up.
“Well, that’s unfortunate. We did not get any more hints about Peter’s Boy – Crush.” Mantis speaks up, sad that their questions were left hanging.
“I have to agree. However, I’m also glad that Peter decides to burn those letters.” T'Challa said with a grateful look.
“Care to tell us those hints he gave you?” Clint asks innocently, but his dark aura gave it away. MJ waited until all of them to be seated before she answers him.
“Hey man, you done with practice?” Ned asks once he’s in a hearing distance. Peter approaches him, still cleaning his sweat with the towel.
The curtain rises up as the piano’s tune flows, revealing a house – like setting. The room looked like a living room from the 1700’s making it felt vintage and out of their era. The classic and antic looking furniture made the living room set up felt comfier and homey. In it, there stood a person near the fireplace. Watching those fire woods burn in silent.
“We’re currently heading into the Center Balconies in level three. With the Proscenium style stage this Theater has, it should be the best place to watch the play.” Ned explained steadily. He considered putting the Avengers in the Grand Circle in level one so that they can see Peter closely, but he didn’t doubt that he would notice them immediately. With all of the story Peter told Ned, the Avengers create a huge mess and ruckus when they’re not out saving the world.
, of course I trust them, if I didn’t they won’t be the one acting on that stage right now!” He barks, irritated at his distrust.
“Yeah, everything is under control—except maybe for your mental condition, Peter.” MJ replies calmly, smirking when her sight lands on Peter.
“Don’t worry about Sam being an asshole to Peter—that’s just his dark and twisted way of showing his affection and love for Peter.” Bucky reasons, sensing the tension that risen at the mention of Sam bullying Peter; the girls in the room dotes on Peter a lot and cares for him so much that they tend to be overprotective. The same can be said about the guys in the room.
“So, you prepared yourselves to see Tiger in his act for tonight?” She said casually, glancing to the Avengers.
“Who is it?” Bucky states in a cold tone. He better knows this person’s information if he wants to approve them. Slip some listening bugs on said person. And more on Peter too. He’s that overprotective,
He turns 180° degrees, now facing Flash as tears flows from his eyes slowly but surely. His face flushed deep red, as his cheek was wet from his tears. To act his role as real as possible he needed to immerse himself with her feelings. Well… Peter kind of did that a bit too much. In the end, he ended up crying his eyes out, a bit taken aback by the pained feelings overload. Flash too was taken aback.
Peter signals the Wind Installer crew to create a wind that will help the letters flew across the room and hovers around Flash.
“Best of luck to all of you! Do your best everyone, we’ll be watching over you from behind the scene.” The Director smiles for the last time as he exits the stage. The Co – Director mumbling and protesting about how much of an airhead the Director is.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve breathed and, without meaning to, found himself standing with his erection pressed firmly against Tony’s ass.  He wrapped one big arm around the front of Tony’s shoulders, pulling him up to stand with his back pressed to Steve’s chest.  The other arm slid down, palm skimming over Tony’s stomach and his coarse thicket of pubic hair, coming finally to the head of Tony’s erect cock.  Steve gripped and began a slow, loose, stroke.
“I guess it is,” Tony said, pushing his chair back with a scrape, “Says so right here on my transcript.”  He ostentatiously crumpled the paper into a ball and shot it into Howard’s glass. It hit the wine with a satisfying ‘plop.’
“Are you kidding?  Have you seen these things?” Tony spread his hands over his soft, round breasts and laughed, “It’s terrific!  And besides,” his voice dropped to a bedroom purr, “I thought this would be a fun model for you to test drive.” And then Tony actually had the audacity to wink.
“Oh, God, it was,” Pepper agreed, “The very idea of it.  That we should—should celebrate the life of that
Tony chanced a look at Steve’s face, checking for recriminations.  This was important to Steve; the dinner was evidence of that. By all rights, Steve should be annoyed and angry; after all, Tony hadn’t actually put forward any sane or supportable reason why Steve shouldn’t be Steve Stark, but . . . Steve didn’t look angry.  Instead, he wore a sweet, winsome expression, a commingling of patience and sympathy and bemusement.  When Tony met his eyes, he smiled warmly.  Tony just ducked his head.
“You know,” Tony continued stubbornly a moment later, “I generally make it a point not to sleep with people who steal my shit . . .” he trailed off, distracted by the lips edging towards the low-slung waist of his jeans.
“Fine,” Tony answered, aiming for politely chipper and managing flat.  Nonchalantly, he took the napkin from his lap and dropped it halfway over his transcript.  Maybe Howard hadn’t--
“It’s fine,” Steve’s fingers were back in his doubtless dirty hair, gently carding it over and over.  “Do it tomorrow.”
magazine.  Glancing around furtively, he snatched it up.  Steve had insisted on having press at the wedding, spouting something about
Trailing after Tony’s naked back, Steve recalled something else from the long, hushed afternoons in the sculpture galleries: the aching loneliness.  The statues had been close and yet untouchable, which had always seemed sad somehow.  They were so intensely life-like, it was impossible not to view them as conscious, and yet they were each marooned on their plinths, cursed to gaze at one other’s sumptuous bodies, all the while unable to experience the ecstasy of flesh on flesh.  At the time, it had been a condition he could easily relate to.  No one had been ecstatically experiencing his flesh, either.  Though, to be fair,
When it became apparent that Steve would not be shaking on it, Tony folded his arms across his chest and leaned back in his chair, smirking contentedly.  Shocking Steve was one of his favorite pastimes.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said finally, when he couldn’t think of anything else.  He stared down into the honey-colored depths of his glass.
“Oh, geez, Tony,” Steve thrust both hands in his hair, raking it back from his temples, “I don't know. As little as possible.”
?”  Tony repeated incredulously.  Steve noticed Tony’s hand curling unconsciously (he hoped) into a fist.
“Ha.  No.  How about . . .” Who would Tony want to be, really, if he could choose?  Someone happy.  Someone sane.  Someone who didn’t vomit in bushes.  Someone Howard approved of.  “How about Steve Rogers?  That’s a solid name.  Everybody loves Captain America.”
“No, you’re right.  it doesn’t,” Steve laughed, “but if you sleep all day, you’ll never get back on a regular schedule.”
“It’s fine,” Steve’s arm came around his shoulders, his lips pressing lightly into the hair at Tony’s temple. “It was supposed to make you happy, Tony, and it doesn’t so . . . it’s fine,” Steve squeezed his shoulders; “Let’s have some cake.  It’s a poundcake, so no layers.  Hope you’re not too disappointed. ”
“See this, this right here?  This is why I need to leave.  You don’t respect my boundaries,” Tony declared, trying for fury but not quite getting there.  He batted at Steve half-heartedly with the sneaker as Steve unbuttoned his suit jacket and then started on his shirt.
“Yeah, sure,” he agreed, “but notice I did get an ‘A’ in art history.  So I still ended up all cultured and stuff.  Don’t I look all cultured and stuff?”  Tony crossed his eyes.   Maria swatted his arm with her napkin.
,” and she sighed dreamily, “Isn’t it terrific?  I’ve thought about it and thought about it, and I still can’t figure out a single way to make fun of ‘Mrs. Smith.’  How about you?  What’re
.  He had continued to mull it over during breakfast, knowing that sometimes one finds sanity at the bottom of a coffee mug, but he finished his first cup and then his fourth and found he still had no reservations.
He pulled out and collapsed back against the bed bonelessly, feeling as if he were deliquescing into the mattress as his eyes fluttered shut.  It could have been a moment later or an hour when he felt a damp washcloth against his chest and stomach, wiping away the clinging, faintly chlorine-smelling mess.  The cloth was pulled away, and Steve could hear it drop to the floor as Tony settled on the bed, one arm draped over Steve’s chest and one leg over his thigh.  Tony’s beard and hair were damp and smelled faintly of soap as he pressed close.  The metal lip of the arc reactor against Steve’s side was warm, as it always was, resting so close to Tony’s heart.
.  Thanks for asking.  Turbulence the whole time; I swear to god, I think the pilot was trying to make me puke.  And they were out of olives.  Why even have a private plane if they don’t bother to stock the bar?  I bet Delta has olives,” Tony meandered through the flat in his sock feet, stopping off at the bar cart in the living room.  He found a glass, poured himself a very expensive (and very large) single-malt scotch, and continued to complain at top volume, “And
“Oh, Tony,” Steve sighed and let his head tip back against the sofa.  He contemplated the high, pre-war ceilings and the shadows cast there by the fragile blue glow from Tony’s chest.  He wanted to get the next part right and waited until he had all the words arranged in his mind.  It took some time.
“Well, I can do better than ‘ish,’” and Steve eased out his fingers, replacing them with his dick, pushing in gently.  He could feel Tony’s quivering impatience, but he refused to be rushed, adding more lubricant, stopping to wait when Tony’s face momentarily clouded.  Tony was incredibly tight, just a shade on the right side of painful, and so slick and hot that Steve could feel beads of sweat gathering along his hairline.  As Steve pushed in the last inch, an ecstatic groan wrenched free from Tony’s throat, probably loud enough to wake the neighbors.
