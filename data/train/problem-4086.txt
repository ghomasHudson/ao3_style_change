“Er, well, yes.” Sirius said, nonplussed (who else could he have been talking about?), before being distracted for just a moment as he uncovered Sam’s wound and winced. What a mess.
One thing was for sure. Gabriel wouldn't be waking up in time to help the boys anymore than he already had, that was for sure. He just hoped that he'd bought enough time for the Winchesters to get Kali the hell out and that they'd found his Casa Erotica CD with the instructions for opening and then closing the Cage again. Gabriel was almost loathe to admit it, but if anyone had even the slightest chance of being able to slam Lucifer back into his cage, it'd be those two knucklehead Winchesters, even if they only had Cassie for angelic assistance. Death, at least, would probably just give him his ring as long as he had access to junk food, and he was, for obvious reasons, by far the most deadly of the Four Horsemen. Mind, if Gabriel woke up and the Winchesters had gotten his little brother killed, it wouldn't matter if Samsquatch and Deano had managed to stop Lucifer and Michael's slug-fest, they were dead men no matter how cute the younger one's puppy dog eyes were. Same went for Dean Winchester specifically, if he broke Cassie's heart. If that happened, there was nowhere that the elder Winchester could run. Gabriel would find him and destroy him entirely. Cassie'd already been through enough.
Cas nodded, still looking worried, but less than he had been, so Dean counted that one as a win. Then, Cas looked past Dean to see Mary, still standing behind him, and finally seemed to actually
Snuffles was still in the lead, and Sam and Teddy followed him as he wove is way down hallways and through corridors, taking turns seemingly at random. Sam had had some idea that the path Snuffles was following was the same route that Sam'd been taken down upon his arrival, but he wasn't sure until the dog stopped in front of the door that led to the garage. Had Snuffles come in with Sam? Whatever, not the time.
tell me that neither of them are Sam slash Dean shippers." That was something he'd, for all he wished otherwise, would never be able to un-know was a thing. He vastly preferred the whole Destiel thing. That, at least, was based in the goddamn truth.
The Golden Sitch was student run, had been since the day it was started, but Luna [also known as Aunt Luna (she really preferred her first name, but some of her niblings just couldn’t bring themselves to be that informal), Professor Lovegood (to first years for, like, the first week, to the consternation of most of the older professors) or the Batty Professor (which she mostly just ignored)] was their supervisor/sponsor and so was indirectly involved.
“This is everything she had on Animagus tracking, plus her personal notes. She made me tell her everything too, and I’ve gotta say Harry, I’m pretty sure that if we don’t find them soon she’s going to try and do it herself.”
Teddy, whose energy had been bolstered by both the promise of shelter and Snuffles' enthusiasm, was flagging fast, leaning more and more heavily on Sam as they went. The tugging grew almost painful, then disappeared altogether. His leg was a distant but somehow inescapable source of stabbing ache and his vision was starting to get a bit blurry around the edges.
“While the Apocalypse was going underway, it quickly became necessary for Sam and Dean to be hidden from angels and demons. The warding I placed on them is very strong, and permanent.”
. His feet caught Ketch square in the chest, slamming into him with all the force Sam could muster. Ketch went reeling, caught off guard, and staggered into the wall of the cell and slid to the floor. Hah. Sam hadn't thought he'd be able to hit him quite that hard, but the bastard had it coming.
"Sorry, sorry," Sam muttered distractedly, looking around in apparent confusion. "What-what were we doing?"
“Dunno,” Harry said, “Might as well try it anyway, Ron, but you might want to ask Professor McGonnagal. If anyone knows how to use a spell to track a transformed animagus, it’s her.”
There was a jolt, and Teddy was startled out of his speculation as he realized that they had started moving again. Teddy could see Sam's concerned gaze out of the corner of his eye, but just the same he could see the glassy sheen that had developed over the older man's eyes. Sam might be faring better than Teddy but he wasn't much further from fever, and wouldn't be going for too much longer either.
“Awesome, we’ll have some grub ready when you get there. How long do you think that this is gonna take?”
Completely nonplussed, Ron, momentarily disregarding the intruders, turned to stare at the man in total confusion.
"Thanks Mom," he mumbled, feet shuffling like a gradeschooler's before he straightened up and squared his shoulders. That hunter's look was back, but he didn't seem nearly so on edge, so Mary counted it as a win.
“I think we’ve got some firewhiskey around here somewhere,” Sirius told him, only lying a little bit. He knew exactly where the whiskey was, he just really didn’t want to think about it.
Jamie sniffed once, then darted in and hugged Ron around the middle, hard enough to almost to knock the breath out of him.
Properly chastised, as well as motivated by the promise of free food and alcohol, Dean finally popped open his door and got out of the car. Mary and Cas followed him in, baggage in hand (a duffel bag apiece, plus one for Sam with a few changes of clothes, weapons, and a hexbag each to hid the weapons from airport security). Dean checked them in, then they tramped upstairs to get settled.
Ron hated to admit it, especially in principle he definitely could have been less offensive about it, Ketch had a point. He kept that opinion to himself as Castiel continued to frown at Ketch.
(Teddy, the freak, didn't actually mind paperwork very much, something that many people had assured more or less every member of the family that he'd gotten from his father. Tonks, apparently, had been in the habit of sending her paperwork to Romania to be incinerated by Charlie's dragons whenever it got to be too much for her. Ron, who was often tempted to do the same, didn't blame her in the slightest.)
here because I'm a 'jumped up hunter mucking about in things he doesn't understand.' Oh, and apparently that 'mucking about' had included a whole bunch of 'committing crimes against the human race' or something equally as stupid.
Teddy was understandably preoccupied with the thugs dragging him down the corridor and what was going to be done to him when they reached their destination, so he never heard the the elevator doors slide open then shut or the light clicking of claws as the little group was followed.
Sighing, and wishing that her friend would at least try to take care of himself for once in his life, Hermione followed.
“Only Harry’s—that’s my friend over there—only his half of it. Your names do sound familiar to me, but I have to admit that I can’t place them.”
Harry had immediately sent his liaison to the Muggles to in the hopes that their Ministry had anything on these werewolf hunters that he could find. Once that had been done...Well Harry and Ron had then been left with nothing to do but wait for news, so they called a family meeting at the Burrow (including Andromeda Tonks.) And now he was standing at the doorstep, trying to summon up the courage to tell his family that their oldest child was missing.
"C'mon," he said to Snuffles, "I've got a friend I need to grab before we leave, and I'm guessing we don't have long before those Men of Letters blokes you took out raise the alarm."
Cue the gibbering. Impatient, Castiel did a flicking movement with his wrist and Ketch wasn’t the only one to make a startled noise as a large, silvery, knife dropped into the (apparently) angel’s hand.
Okay, here's the next installment! I've now got dates posted at the head of every chapter and time change, and right after I hit the post button for this, I'll be putting up a timeline for everything that's happened thus far :) Hope you enjoy!
Dean, as the only one out of the three of them who knew how to operate computers with any kind of efficiency (though Mary was learning at astonishing speed), had been the one who bought them their tickets on the first available flight 'across the pond'. He had, quite frankly, turned a vaguely alarming light green color simply purchasing the tickets online.
A burning pain erupted in Gabriel's gut as Lucifer plunged his own blade into his stomach and he doubled over in shock and agony. He'd be lying through his teeth if he said that this turn of events was entirely unexpected, but the betrayal still seared like a dagger to his heart. In spite of his better judgement, there'd been a small, hopeful and oh so foolish part of him that had believed that Lucifer wouldn't really be able to hurt him like this. Not even now. Well, joke was on him, because the thing that had once been his favorite brother did not give a shit about Gabriel beyond that he'd gotten in his way.
Dom blinked, impressed despite herself. Still... “Are you sure that you don’t want to tell at least them about this? You know they’d want to help.”
Distantly, he registered that he was more than a little delirious and that he should probably be worried about it because it was a definite sign of his progressing fever. At the moment, he was preoccupied with the sight of Sam cringing away from Snuffles as the dog licked at his face.
"I run hotter than you do, I'll be fine. I need to bind your shoulder tighter to stop the bleeding, so unless you particularly feel like dying slowly from blood loss, I suggest you shut up and let me help you."
“Um, Voldemort sort of borrowed Kreacher and took him to this cave in the middle of an infiri-infested lake and made him drink this bowl of nightmare potion called Dementor’s Draught so that he could hide the horcrux in it and…”
A quick pop in on her coworkers (who didn’t seem at all surprised when she announced that she had to go help Aurors Potter and Weasley on their case) and another quick run to the house to grab her books (that Undetectable Extension Charm was still one of the most useful bits of magic she knew) and then she Apparated to the building on the brochure.
“He never changed back,” Ron interrupted the increasingly (and understandably) hysterical Harry softly, “that whole time, while he and Teddy and Sam were running, he never once transformed back from Padfoot. Why?”
"A woman was waiting for us when we returned to the bunker. She knew, or a least suspected that I'd be there, because she already had the sigil drawn and ready to use when we came in. She banished me the moment we came off the stairs; I wound up in Manitoba. She's blonde, and I think she might be British, but...I only heard her say two words, so I can't be sure."
Together, Cas and Harry untied Ketch and wrangled him, suddenly protesting wildly, so that the three of them were standing together in what looked like the most awkward triangle that ever existed.
have an easier time of it when it came to walking than Teddy and while bullet wounds were undoubtedly horrible, nothing quite measured up in terms of pain and difficulty healing like the claws of a werewolf. Snuffles was in the best shape out of the three of them: the injuries that the dog had sustained were the least severe and he'd apparently been able to ward off infection by way of cleaning his wounds with his tongue.
Behind the odd trio was a huge desk that housed several computer monitors, all showing something she couldn't quite see, though she could tell they were all different.
Harry grinned, taking the Cloak from his friend and shaking it out. “If you think it’s my Invisibility Cloak, then yeah.”
"I suggest that you keep any further rude comments to yourself and answer my friend here before he gets even more pissed off than he already is," he told him.
“What’re we gonna do with him?” he asked, jerking a thumb in the direction of Ketch (who had apparently decided, after Dean’s attack, that it would be in his best interest to keep his mouth shut,) “You guys got anywhere we can stash him? Our dungeon’s back in the States.”
Teddy turned over onto his back with some difficulty, unable to help the tiny whimpers that escaped him from the stabbing pain that lanced up from his thigh at the movements. Finally, he flopped down, blinking away the black spots that were dancing across his vision so that he could watch the clouds creeping towards them from across the sky. It was really nothing short of a miracle that they hadn't gotten rained on yet, and from the looks of it their good luck wouldn't be holding out for much longer. Beside him, Sam blew out a frustrated breath.
n'r s'me kine' 'f w'z'rdin' h'se'old th't's c'nspic'us 'nough t' n'd to k'p m'ggles ou' an' you j's' cr'ssed th' d'mned
“Sorry, that’s...probably not helping much. I’m usually better at this, it’s...been a long week. You finished?”
“...and then Prongs gave me the idea to ask the portraits in the castle for help. Loads of them have portraits in other places, you know—the Ministry, people’s houses, St. Mungo’s—and those places have other portraits that might have secondary frames in
“It got mixed up with the maps and I didn’t have anywhere else to put it. It’s good that I had it isn’t it?”
The Potters had been called away in the morning, just after breakfast. A lone glass still sat on the kitchen counter. Sirius stared at it for a long moment before he had to lean his elbows against the counter and convince himself that he remembered how to breathe without sobbing.
The kid had bruises all over his face but he was glaring up at the camera, eyes just as amber and firey and stubborn as ever.
Pulling out the gun they'd stuck to the bottom of the war room table and sticking it in his waistband, Dean walked over and took a look at the bloody sigil on the wall.
He'd read the books, and had then forced Dean read them, which hadn't been nearly as hard as Dean would have anyone believe. In return Dean had made him watch all the movies with him and...Not thinking about that right now. Nope. If he started in on Dean stuff, he'd end up sobbing right here in this dungeon, chains and all.
banishing sigil?!" He could her her footsteps; she was running after him and Dean knew that he owed her an explanation, but whatever had happened to Sammy and Cas came first. Especially if Sam had wound up doing something monumentally stupid. God Dean hoped he hadn't decided to banish Cas and run off.
Teddy was torn between trying to figure out what was going on out there or just trying to bust out now, while they were distracted. He'd just decided he was going to give busting out a shot when from the corridor came a deep growl, a yelp, and another thud. Teddy froze, straining his ears for anything else, and picked up the
"Why is there an enormous black dog guarding the door?" he asked, then, upon noticing something else, added, "And why does it look like it understands exactly what I'm saying and finds it funny?"
Well, he’d definitely achieved fire but he was also pretty sure that he’d just singed his eyebrows. And possibly set his beard just a little bit on fire. He really needed to find a razor.
Part of Gabriel wanted the four of them to sit and talk until they all knew exactly what was going on, what they were going to do about it and where they all stood with each other, just to get it all over with. The rest of him saw how exhausted Sirius looked, even with the healing that Gabriel had done earlier, the bruise-dark circles under Sam’s eyes as he slept, and the sweat beading Teddy’s forehead.
Teddy'd left a week prior, with plans to return the day prior. He'd been on an Auror mission investigating rumors of muggles who'd gotten turned into werewolves in Sheffield, and were, apparently, very different than wizards who'd been Turned.
Welp, that's all for now, I hope y'all enjoyed the chapter! I'm sorry for all the Sirius angst (not really, it was actually surprisingly fun to write lol) and let me know what you thought of Jamie! Did you like him, hate him, feel neutral? Tell me about it!
Acting on instinct, Gabriel caught the hunter by the shoulders (careful, gently, mind the bandages) and kept him from flailing his way right onto the floor.
Someone ran into the room, only to squeak and freeze at the sight of over a dozen wands, all wielded by very capable (some even rather vicious) witches and wizards pointed directly at them. Harry took one look at their face and relaxed, putting his wand away as he heard the others doing the same. It was Dennis, and when Harry tried to apologize, he just waved it off and dove into his report.
This DOES NOT mean that I'm abandoning this story, I'll be working on it whenever I can, and I'll get the next chapter up as soon as I'm able.
Laughing, Ron opened his arms and was immediately pounced upon by all nine of his niblings and his daughter, who squished him between them in a massive group hug that was over as quickly as it had started.
"Actually, Mum, we're not all here," Ron told her carefully, "We've got news we'd really rather deliver just the once, so we-"
The third floor was the last one in the building that had any people in it, and while Ron had no objections to taking down security lackeys, it had been starting to look like they were the only type of people here. Still, there was a bank of computers off in the side of the room they'd just finished clearing (three security people, now hogtied on the floor and out cold) that Harry had told him led to the feeds of the cameras in the building and was trying to figure out how to make work.
“How can I help?” he asked, wondering when he had become the kind of person who asked that question and actually meant it.
Taken aback and stunned into silence, Castiel had spent the time she took to speak studying her in turn. This woman was surely a hunter down to her bones, hiatus or no. She was smart, taking all of this remarkably well, and...Cas so dearly wanted her to be right about him being good for Dean, though he wasn't sure that it was actually true. Still, there was one thing he could always be sure of.
In the spirit of things, Teddy tried to sit up, only to flop back down as the pain in his leg flared back up.
Well, there was nothing for it. Dom left for her own common room, dropped off her bookbag, shrunk a blanket, and, after a moment’s consideration, grabbed her well-loved volume of the Ultimate Hitchhiker’s Guide and a small reading light.
This was the first even remotely concrete chance he'd gotten in well over twenty years to get back to his godson and remaining best friend. There was no way in hell that he was passing this up.
Mary let the hunting calm that the confusion over the tires had dispelled come over her again, retrieved her gun back out of her waistband, and followed the boys down the hall. Nobody. She watched the boys' backs as they charged down hallway after hallway, room after room. Nothing. No one in sight, and they hadn't so much as
"Well now. Mr. Winchester, pleasure to make you acquaintance at long last. I've been wishing to speak with you for some time now, and now here we are!" he said, as conversationally as if they were meeting in a cafe.
“Absolutely not,” Dean looked alarmed. “We are not asking the Reaper that wants me and Sam dead permanently.”
“No one’s really sure,” Hermione told her. “It’s ancient, more than any other. Most invisibility cloaks are either just normal cloaks with charms on them or woven from the hair of a Demiguise and they tend to fade after a few years. This one is ancient, it’s been passed down in Harry’s family for generations and no one knows—”
shouldn't have done that," Ketch drawled, taking two, three steps towards Sam, not realizing just how geared up Sam was to fight. Still, Sam knew that even if he caught Ketch off guard that this wasn't something he was likely to get out of alive. And Sam was done railing against the odds.
At this point he didn't even care where he ended up, just so long as it was east of the Atlantic. If he ended up in Asia, he could damn well walk.
“Okay, you’re hungry. You’re gonna need to eat for energy, just like the rest of us mere mortals. And I know it’s not cake or a candy bar, but these eggs are actually pretty good.”
I touched in on this a little in the beginning notes, but again, please be as safe as you can. Be careful if you're protesting, and try to stay informed without spiraling down the negative media rabbit hole (trust me, without breaks and positive stuff, all that accomplishes is depression).
, the closest they'd come before now had been Dean slinging an arm around her shoulders back at the bunker. How-How had she-?
Jamie subsided, and they both dug into their food. Then a thought occurred to Dom, and she snickered.
When they were done, she took a minute to collect her thoughts. Harry, though she knew that he had to be bursting with impatience, let her.
He drew himself up as best he could whilst tied to a swivel chair, again reminding Ron strongly of one Draco Malfoy. (This time it was because the man looked exactly like the little ferret had done whenever he proclaimed that his father would be hearing about something.)
"I-yes, of course I remember the question, but I really don't see what you want with that information, and it's not as though it would be of any use to you anyway, you can't prove...whatever it is you're trying to prove, without records and the only place that there
“-actually came up to me with no warning, in the middle of the sidewalk, just touched my forehead without so much as a by-your-leave, and asked how I’d managed my scar! It doesn’t even
The first try resulted in a single spark that had gone out by the time Sirius blinked. The second didn’t manage any at all. Frustrated, Sirius closed his eyes, reached deep within himself to try and get a hold on his own well of magic, and
Dom followed behind him as closely as she dared and as quietly as she could. Jamie snuck through the corridors, using as many secret passages as were on his route (Al must have the Map, which was working out rather well for Dom) until he came to the Great Hall. Then he ducked into the side chamber that held Violet’s portrait.
"Yeah. I'd say whoever it was that drew the sigil was waiting for them when they got back to the bunker," which out-ruled Rowena and Crowley, but meant they were
and people actually liked Joanne’s stuff, you know, before she started spewing rubbish. I don’t suppose you might have any ideas?”
Jamie stared at her, looking slightly shocked and (thankfully) not at all betrayed anymore. “Dom—you—how—you’re a bloody
Dom waited for a few seconds, but once it became clear that this was actually Jamie’s end destination, she lifted her Disillusionment Charm.
Gabriel hadn’t noticed before, but Sam looked uncomfortably cramped. That loveseat was way too small for him. He said as much to Sirius, finally feeling that words spoke out loud wouldn’t shatter something intangible and terribly fragile, and he agreed.
Zachariah and Uriel would no doubt tell him he'd become unforgivably sentimental. The thought didn't bother him, beyond that they'd take exception to that and try to have him taken in for reconditioning. They were both dead after all, as was Naomi, and they would not have been wrong. Cas was not entirely sure of the person he'd become, whether he was good, bad, or (most likely) something that dwelt in the shades of grey in between. Regardless he was not, nor would he ever be, ashamed of the care he had for these humans who's somehow become his family than almost the entirety of the angelic host (with very few exceptions, all of them dead.) If Castiel had his family, he was content.
beyond repair. Exchanging a glance with the boys, she crept forward to take a closer look. Well, maybe not all of them had been clawed, but most of them had been, and where they weren't they'd been slashed with a knife.
She still looked lost but Castiel actually looked somewhat contrite, so Ron turned to him for answers while noting that Harry and Dean were now commiserating the horrors of LARPers that paraded around as them.
"Heya, Samsquatch, what brings you to this neck of the woods?" suddenly, the short man frowned, still getting closer. "You're not lookin’ so good, bucko, what happened?"
Ketch let out a breath through his nose, hard, and immediately looked like he'd regretted it. Ron had no sympathy for his, from the looks of it, very sore nose. He had the distinct impression that That Smarmy Prick had brought it on himself.
Cas looked briefly as though he'd been slapped upside the head, but when Dean didn't seem to realize what he'd just said (oh, her poor, apparently oblivious, son) he shook himself and entered back into the conversation.
Ron chuckled wryly. “Yeah, umm, well it’s sort of a more ‘seeing is believing’ kind of thing, but we found somewhere he was, and we’ve stumbled across some unexpected help in the case, so the Headmistress is going to try and help, and then if that doesn’t work, we’ll work off the rest of what we have. I really can’t tell you more than that right now, but we’re getting closer, I promise you that.”
“Yeah, alright. Peeves, your lot have Mondays, Saturdays and Sundays. You check in with Violet’s portraits around two in the morning.”
“Most likely,” Cas said, then turned slightly to better face the wizards, “Would it be possible for me to take a look at the veil? Perhaps if I can see it I can determine what it really is, or at the very least come up with a working theory. It could gain us some insight towards to figure out what is going on.”
Dean leaned against the kitchen wall, trying to think, and Mary came to stand beside him. He felt her hand on his shoulder, and leaned into her touch despite himself.
Sirius blinked, glanced down at the suddenly unconscious man slumped against him, then to the floor where Sam and Teddy lay crumpled after Sam’s ill advised attempt to catch the kid with his bad arm, then blinked again.
The exclamation was shouted loudly enough to make Mary jump, and she gave her son a reproachful look that he was too busy with whatever it was he had found to see it.
“Sirius Black,” he cut in, hardly able to believe the words that were coming out of his own mouth, “You’re saying that that dog is Sirius Black.”
There wasn’t a single one of them who didn’t look disappointed, but what was he supposed to tell them? That Teddy had escaped from a secret Muggle creature-hunting agency with a dead man (who may or may not be stuck as a dog) and a fictional character, and now he and Harry had teamed up with two more fictional characters, one of whom was an angel, to try and find them? For that matter, how in the bloody hell was he supposed to tell the Professor what she needed to know and not have her call the mental ward in St. Mungo’s?
Okay. Speaking of plans. Water, sheets for bandages, food, a bottle or two of that firewhiskey sequestered under the bed of James’ old room. First stop, the kitchen.
Sirius set the pan down beside the sink and then he stopped moving, just stood there with his back to Gabriel, still trembling.
"Really?" he said sarcastically, "You know, last I checked, 'speaking' with someone doesn't involve abduc-"
"If we can catch someone alone, we may be able to make them tell us where Sam is without alerting the entire compound to our presence," Castiel suggested.
Sam, or was it Lucifer? Falling into a massive hole in the ground with someone he though might be Michael. Had to've been, Gabriel couldn't think of anyone else that the youngest Winchester would drag down into the cage with him and
Teddy bared his teeth at her, snarling deep in his throat. He was not letting that thing anywhere the hell near him if he could do anything about it. Without those goon to hold him, he could bloody well do something about it.
Despite everything, Dean couldn't help his grin as he slung his arm around his Mom's shoulders, leading her to the computer room.
"Sorry, what?" Teddy realized that he'd been so caught up in trying to figure his cellmate out, that he'd completely missed him trying to get his attention. "What were you saying?"
"Fi-fine. Yes my organization and I have long since been involved in protecting the ignorant from the monsters that prowl the night, but I entirely fail to see how that should lead to this, this
, just. Why? Why could they possibly need that many? And...Hah! Yahtzee! Here we go, Administration and security, floor three. That's where we'll find the security feeds."
Teddy laughed in site of himself, ignoring his protesting bruised ribs, and decided to try his hand at being a little cryptic.
"Do you need me to repeat my question, or do you think you've got it?" he sneered, apparently also channeling adolescent Malfoy.
"I think that those records he's talking about are somewhere in this building, mate," Ron told Harry, grinning slightly despite himself. This was just too easy.
“Look,” Harry said, looking slightly frantic, “We tracked the arseholes who grabbed Teddy to this, compound...thing, out in the woods and Cas and, well, Dean and his and Sam’s previously dead mother were there looking for, umm, Sam, right?”
Sorry guys, I know that this is a short filler-type chapter, but I promise the next one's gonna be longer :)
The man had strutted into the office, still managing to look superior despite the tape across his nose and the black eyes, then stopped dead in his tracks upon noticing Harry and Ron. He gave off such a strong 'Draco Malfoy When They Were All Still At Hogwarts' vibe that it had immediately earned him the aforementioned derogatory nickname. It also meant that when Harry gestured, Ron might have kicked his legs out from under him with a little more force than was strictly necessary.
“Your name is Castiel? And you and a bloke named Dean are looking for his brother, who is Sam? Are you sure that
been the one to put that bit of color into his angel’s cheeks. He really, really wanted to do it again, as many times as Cas would let him.
“We’ve got ‘em Mr. Weasley,” Lysander Scamander promised, their twin nodding fiercely. Scorpius, the Longbottom kids and the rest of the assorted friends chorused their agreement.
Dean nodded at him, a small smile (that Mary was perhaps disproportionately glad to see) tugging at his lips before it disappeared.
Still, Dean was able to catch a few words, not that they made any sense without the context of whatever else they were saying: Unspeakables, the Department, and something about mysterious bleeding secret keepers. That last one had definitely been Ron.
Were they seriously talking about the dog? It definitely seemed like it and both brits seemed seriously freaked out.
"Alright, alright, look, if you're trying to find Winchester, I don't know where he is alright, he took off days ago and—"
It was beyond frustrating and Dom struggled with the urge to punch Joanne on a regular basis but, ironically, this latest attempt was (indirectly) the reason that Dom finally clued in about Jamie.
Jamie was leaning on her heavily, eyes drooping. He’d had one too many all-nighters, and at the rate he was going with these nightly portrait meetings, he’d be passing out from exhaustion in the halls sooner rather than later.
The last word had come out a strangled squeak that was a direct result of Harry's suddenly looming over Ketch, his hands planting firmly on the arm rests and forcing him back in the swivel chair.
“This cloak is Death-touched,” Castiel announced, who was now holding the wad of fabric, having evidently gotten it from Harry.
Sam had closed his mouth, and for a moment he just looked, but then he sighed, defeat written into every line of his slumped body and hunched shoulders.
Neither she nor Castiel seemed to notice, not that Ron could blame them seeing as Ketch-on-the-screen was not advancing towards Sam with the knife. Sam had done something with the chains and his hands and seemed to be readying himself for a fight that Ron wasn’t all that sure he would come out on top of.
"Thanks for clearing the way, and for tryin' to get me those keys, but I'm pretty sure I've got this one."
Ron heard Castiel let out a small cheer, echoed by Mary, and Ron felt his own mouth spread into a wide grin.
When she finally did notice, it was... kind of blindingly obvious. She couldn’t fault her cousins for not noticing, they were all caught up in their own worries and schoolwork and also didn’t have Luna bringing their attention to whatever it was that was going on.
Gabriel didn’t think that Sirius breathed at all while Sam told the story. Gabriel felt a little sick himself—Regulus couldn’t have been more than a teenager when he’d died. And death by inferi—blech. What an awful way to go.
Harry just shook his head wordlessly, gasping, and a few tears managed to escape him. Dean followed suit (minus the tears) and handed him a tissue from the desk.
Ron kept quiet through their explanation of what the Veil actually was and what that meant for the animagus. When they were done he whistled lowly.
Ron shrugged, still staring at the wall, but apparently paying more attention than Dean had thought he was.
"We don't know who they are," Harry added, "But we have leads and people liasoning with the Muggle Ministry and...we're going to find him, Andy. We're bringing him home."
Four more steps this time and then Sam stopped as abruptly as if they'd just collided with a brick wall. Teddy stumbled again, this time losing his balance entirely, and pitched forward, dragging Sam down with him. They hit the ground hard, Teddy groaning as his leg erupted with white-hot agony, Sam letting out a soft, pained, grunt as he landed on his bad shoulder.
Head Bitch put the syringe down and pulled her gun out of her waistband. She brandished it at Teddy for a second, and glared at him.
There was a small yelp and Ketch squirmed around in the chair, trying to get further away from Castiel’s knife.
Heeeeeey. *Looks back at last author's note that contained a promise for faster updates* *cringes* Sooooo, hahaha. Turns out that I didn't actually have a relaxed good-for-writing summer. I'm so, so sorry this is so late, guys, but at least it's the longest chapter yet? Also, it marks over a hundred pages in my notebook! yay!
Grab a pot, fill it with water (wait for the sink to stop sputtering and actually work,) put it on the stove to boil. Find the linens cupboard, grab the oldest looking sheets, cut them into strips, carefully. Half into the water to sterilize, grab the whiskey and a pitcher for drinking water and some glasses, realize that it’s really bloody
"Yeah. Or something. Let's keep moving, but stay on guard and remember: we are trying for some stealth here but if that fails, we start kicking ass and taking names until we find Sammy, got it?"
The other young man in the maybe-dream. The other young man, who was the reason she hadn't just slapped the man in the car next to her and ran. Because she'd still somehow wound up in a park in the middle of the nowhere. Because in the maybe-dream, she'd been sure that the other young man had been Dean, her Dean, and he was the same man, albeit older, who had stopped dead the instant he'd seen her in the park and called her Mom. The same man she now rode in this stolen car with. What if he was right and she'd died and become a ghost haunting her house for a good twenty-odd years before sying a second time facing down a poltergeist.
Not a lot to go on, but it was all they had, so they had to make it work. Dean joined Cas on his bed to pour over every map of the Peak District they'd been able to get their hands on, trying to narrow down their search radius, while Mary was perched on Dean's bed with Sam's laptop trying to dig up whatever more information she could on Lady Bevell. (She truy had taken to the new computers with an impressive speed- Dean had only needed to show her some of the basics and she was researching online as well as Cas had ever been able to.)
He stalked on down the corridor, Mary and Cas dogging his heels. This floor, thank God, seemed to be much more organized than the ground floor so they navigated with relative ease until Dean stopped short and held up one closed fist.
"I wasn't present for most of the first time it happened, it was just Dean, though I was involved with sending him back...To Lawrence Kansas on the day that John bought the Impala...He met both of you there."
With a start, he realized that both Mary and Castiel were looking at him, apparently expecting an answer to the first question.
"At some time in the past few weeks, you and/or some of your associates were tasked with investigating deaths caused by some kind of 'inhuman creatures' that your lot have been hunting for decades if not longer in Sheffield, is that correct?"
They sat there in a comfortable silence for a while, finishing off their respective (post-)midnight snacks (and making a right mess, these really weren’t supposed to be finger food.) When Dom finished licking the last crumbs of her last custard tart from her fingers, she gave her cousin a once-over and sighed to herself.
To my fellow white people: Protest, donate, repost/reblog, watch those videos with all the ads so you can donate when you're broke. Do whatever you can to help and support, it's our duty to make our voices heard alongside our black friends, neighbors, family and all the rest and to help raise their voices when needed. Ask questions, and listen to the answers. That's how we make a difference.
So it was going to be like this then. Death by stabbing. Not the worst way he'd died, but that didn't mean that Sam was going to make this easy for Ketch. He wrapped his hands around the chains again, more securely this time, and prepared to fight back. His teeth bared in his own snarl. Sam Winchester was done hanged there and taking it. He was done, period.
So...yeah. Sirius was grieving and in shock and confused. He wasn't giving any thought to it being a full moon beyond Teddy's being grumpy and grouchy, having better light to travel by, and missing Moony. After all, no one knew where they were. So, when he heard leaves crunching in the woods around them, he figured it was a deer or something. The smell didn't even register, and Sirius had absolutely no idea that Fenrir
Ordinarily she'd dismiss the whole thing out of hand as completely impossible and possible a very, very bizarre djinn dream, and the man as batshit insane. She'd seen a lot in her life, but time travel had never been one of them. But...They seemed like dreams, and she was almost sure that that was all they were. But what if they weren't? What if they were memories? The Yellow Eyed Demon, burning on the ceiling. Being a ghost for years, protecting, and saving the tall young man from the poltergeist. Being absolutely sure, down to her ghostly bones, that that young man was her baby, her Sam all grown up.
“Would appear to be, at least in part, true,” Castiel confirmed. “Though I would have to handle the other two Hallows to be certain, and I understand that it isn't an option.”
There was a hand on his shoulder, restraining him gently. He hadn’t noticed it. He turned to round furiously on Cas, who met him with a steady, unflinching, blue-eyed gaze.
“I know it’s a really long shot, Dom, that’s why I haven’t told anyone. I don’t want to get any hopes up for no good reason, especially Vic and Al and—”
Yes, Joanne from the year below Dom is absolutely representing JK Rowling. If any of you reading this are trans (or nonbinary, genderfluid, etc.) I am horrified and so, so sorry that she's decided to be even more of a TERF than she's already shown herself to be. I hope that you can find joy in this fandom despite her, though I get that that it's probably really hard. <3
The Men of Letters, evidently not expecting any of them to be armed, scattered. Sam charged out of the elevator, Snuffles shooting ahead of him to jump on a few of the armed henchmen, and Teddy right at his heels. The three of them bolted down the hall, adrenaline enabling Sam to disregard his injuries and
"...must really care about that ridiculous-haired freak of nature for you to have gone to all of-ARGH!
At the moment though, all of the tattered remnants of his fever-ravaged concentration was entirely devoted to hopping forwards, not collapsing, and blinking the rain out of his eyes. Then, suddenly, they'd reached and gone through the trees and were looking straight at the back of one of the most enormous houses Teddy had ever seen. Dimly, he registered a feeling like something was tugging at his navel.
has been hanging around producing badly written books about a pair of jumped up hunters and their pet angel?” Ketch asked in disbelief.
They'd all been sent back to Hogwarts not long after Dad and Uncle Ron'd left and when Vic and Gran Andy had been able to let go of each other. Upon returning, Uncle Neville had hugged them all and told them to come to him if they needed anything before leaving them in the common room with their cousins and friends. Now, Jamie had absolutely nothing to do and it was driving him
What even was his life? That was a question Sam had been asking himself for years, and he still wasn't anywhere near an answer. Every time he thought he'd figured it out, something new and completely weird showed up to prove him wrong.
Dean was definitely missing something blatantly obvious, he just knew it. No one had this kind of emotional reaction towards random dogs on security feeds.
Rosie spotted him fist, and with a cry of, “Dad!” she catapulted herself out of her armchair, dislodging both Albus and Malfoy’s kid, who were sitting on the floor and had been leaning against her legs, and ran straight at Ron, launching herself into his arms.
and the door swung silently inwards. Gratefully, Sam and Teddy followed Snuffles in out of the rain.
The man rubbed his hands together, looking, for all that he seemed to be trying to appear impassive, far too gleeful for Sam's peace of mind.
Ok, first off, here's the mini-summary for the graphic violence bit: Sirius jumps Greyback, bites him, gets thrown off into a tree with three cuts down his side, Sam jumps into the fray with his knife, Sirius jumps back in and goes for the throat. Sam gets Greyback with the knife right when Sirius connects, Greyback lets go of Teddy who clocks him one on the nose, Sirius does some mauling of his own, then disconnects and makes himself very scary.
"Wait, seriously?" Dean grabbed the laptop to look at the article for himself. He then (rather unnecessarily) tilted it to show Cas. "Huh. Well, I get where you're coming from, but that
"Watch it," Sam snarled when the encroaching cray had cleared out of his vision. He was summarily ignored in favor of barking and acknowledging orders; none of these assholes had spoken so much as a word to him since he'd been shoved into the trunk of the first car.
This-This was the first time she'd hugged either of her sons since she'd come back. They'd been so caught up with tracking down Sam that...
Sam responded, and there was a small byplay before Sam tested his cuffs and cringed. They kept talking, Sam laughed at something Teddy had said and Ron felt a little more tension bleed out of Mary. Sam and Teddy kept conversing on the screen, easier now it seemed, with one or the other laughing every now and then. With each smile, Ron could feel himself relax just a bit more.
Something else had come into the room on Teddy's heels, but all Sam could see of it was a black blur.
Teddy had clearly been abducted, of all things, by Muggles. Muggles who apparently, given the silver, had been hunting the same werewolf-like creatures Teddy had been investigating. Werewolf hunting Muggles were, a new and pressing problem in and of themselves, but of far more importance and no small amount of concern to Harry (and Ron, and, to be perfectly honest, most of the rest of the Auror Department) was that they
Ron beckoned to him wordlessly, and Harry walked over to join him at the screen. Dean followed, peering over Mary’s head.
"Dean..."she trailed off, not sure what she meant to say, but then she realized...What the hell? She was a mother, she was
Still, they made do despite the awkwardness. Sirius, out of necessity, did most of the work, but Gabriel could crack eggs and move pens and generally make things easier for the wizard, so he did. (And really, this was the least he could do.)
“The Death Eaters—that’s the bastards who hated Muggleborns and the like and decided to do something about it—decided (with some help, mind you) that we, wizards that is, would be far better off without Muggles or Muggleborns, and went around trying to kill and/or enslave the lot of them. Loads of the rest of us weren’t about to let that happen, so we wound up with the Wizarding Wars: The first ended with Harry’s parents dead, his godfather wrongfully imprisoned and the assumed death of Voldemort (the Death Eaters’ leader).
Every single one of Harry's Aurors that weren't already neck deep in critically important cases of their own were now on this one. Every single one of them, from Harry, to old Williamson who'd be retired by this time next year, to the greenest of the trainees, had been pouring over books and news reports, old and new, magical and Muggle alike, all trying to find out if anything like this had happened before. And lo and behold, it had. Muggle reports, most of them decades old if not older, of "animal attacks", the heart ripped out of all of the victims, and always,
Dean was off of Cas's bed and at his mother's side in an instant, and Cas followed close behind, taking with him the map they'd used to mark out their possible destinations on.
not getting any younger. With no small amount of longing, he looked back at his armchair, or even that little rug in front of the fireplace (wouldn't be the first time) but he knew that if he sat back down now, he wouldn’t be moving again for at least four hours.
Harry's eyes went dangerously cold, and Ron could feel his own fingers twitching with the need to hit something, preferably Ketch. Who was
to be able to talk to someone other than Luna about the perfect lunacy of the Hitchhiker’s Guide. You’ll love it Jamie, promise, it’s absolutely brilliant. Douglas Adams was a genius.”
Oh, and Dean had just killed the Darkness by making himself into a living soul bomb; he was dead too. So really, it would be more accurate to say that Sam was having a Hell day. Literally; this was uncomfortably similar to a number of the scenarios Lucifer had put him through during his time in the Cage. Similar enough that Sam had caught himself pressing down on the scar on his hand, just to make sure this was real. He kind of wished that Toni Bevell had aimed a few more inches to the left and just killed him. As it was she'd given him a lovely gunshot wound in his shoulder that reared its ugly head every time they hit a bump in the road. Every. Damn. Time. Sam was pretty sure that he'd passed out from the pain a few times; they hadn't bothered to give him anything for the pain.
Seriously. He was like a little brown-eyed puppy who thought you might kick him and was asking you really, really nicely not to.
Ron honestly couldn't blame Ketch for the squeak that the man let out this time, or for the scared little gulp that followed directly after. Harry could be bloody terrifying when he wanted to be (or when he was particularly angry, right then it was both.) A tiny nod came after the little gulp. Harry leaned back just slightly and bared his teeth at him in what the uneducated might have called a smile.
Objectively, Castiel had already known that Dean harbored an intense dislike of flying. However, having never seen his friend (more than friend? Probably??) actually deal with it, he hadn't been in a position to realize how much Dean truly despised traveling by plane until they'd actually had to do it to find Sam.
Edit: I've now posted dates for every chapter and time change so the timeline of the fic is now understandable :) I'm also going to be posting a timeline with the next chapter so it's easier without reading back through the fic
He held his daughter close for just a moment, burying his face in her hair, and taking a moment to breathe, before letting her step back to give the rest of the kids a chance to mob him.
Anyway, it'd been about a day and a half since Sirius had managed to break the kids out of that ridiculous compound and, bar the whole book series thing, they'd been pretty damn informative. Not that it was, on the whole, in a good way. Every hour that passed only made Sirius want to be human again more and more, if only to give both of these kids a damn hug, and maybe cry some (a lot, he was going to cry a lot) himself.
Then he noticed that Mary was looking between the two of them and biting her lip like she was trying not to laugh. She noticed him noticing her, and then winked, getting up out of her own seat to follow Dean. Cas followed her out through the plane, into Manchester Airport, and to the rental car that would take them to the nice, but relatively inexpensive, B&B Mary had found for them upon figuring out how to work TripAdvisor (her first successful foray into the internet). That was where they would rest and plan out how they were going to find Sam. Dean, though he did drive, complained strenuously about the rental car, and driving on the 'wrong' side of the road. Knowing that he was only trying to distract himself from Sam until he could actually do something, Cas simply traded exasperated looks with Mary, and let him rant.
find him, Teddy was completely at the mercy of these psychopaths (he'd lost his wand in the fight with the werewolf.)
Also, I'm starting to realize that it would probably be a really good idea to have a beta working with me on this, so if anyone's interested, let me know. I'd really appreciate it. :)
He watched with a sort of floating detachment as Teddy helped Sam pull himself together and and as his giant of a brother staggered uncertainty back over to Ketch and came up with a gun and a knife. The two conscious humans on screen talked, then flinched, maybe some alarms? The dog (Sirius Black, Jesus Christ) barked, and they all left the room.
Finally, just as Cas and Dean had narrowed down their possibilities to two or three stretches of privately owned wooded areas, Mary let out a triumphant whoop!
Dean huffed out a sigh of his own, muttered something about flying that Mary didn't quite catch, and returned to the keyboard.
That last bit had been directed right at him, so Sirius'd obligingly lifted his head and gave an affirming yip.
"Shut. Up." Harry glowered at him. "You are in no position to be insisting upon anything from us, so unless you happen to be answering my questions, so keep your slimy little mouth shut, got it?"
Sirius’ connection to the wards was enough to get them all inside unscathed, but it would take Harry or one of his kids to fully wake the manor.
He'd thought, and maybe he'd been naive after all, but he'd thought that he and Remus, last of the Marauders would make it through at least. (Harry making it had never been a question, not for Sirius. He just would. Something he'd been right about at least.)
After that, she realized what Cas was doing and joined him in taking in every detail to try and keep any of them from falling into anything. There were tripwires here and there, but evidently Dean was paying more attention that she's initially thought, because he stepped over all of them without so much as a pause. The trees began to gradually thin out, and Dean started to accelerate his pace. By the time they reached the edge of the treeline, he was all but sprinting and Mary was left cursing her shorter legs as she had to run to keep up.
up for him. It cut and ran the instant he was marched out of his cell. It had been nice to have a roommate to talk to, not to mention that said roommate was Sam
he had, they were pretty much unavoidable at this point. He even knew some of what happened in them, but he’d heard the words ‘Potter’ and ‘wizards’ and started avoiding any mention of them like the plague because, and here was the damn kicker, it had
Without bothering to wait for any kind of reply, Dead readjusted his grip on his gun, and stepped through the ruined doorway, Cas on his heels. Mary caught another glint of silver as a long, wicked looking knife dropped into his waiting hand. She sighed, knowing the look that had come into their eyes all too well: it was a hunter's look, the one that meant blood. She was sure that others had seen it in her eyes more than once.
There was a small window in the door, and Dean and Cas carefully sidled over (keeping low to the ground), then reached up until they could see through. They stayed there for only a few moments, then came back down, looking more confused than ever.
Unfortunately, it was more than likely that the next time they saw each other neither of them would be in any fit condition for good conversation. If the Arses of Letters were good at anything, is was making sure you were damned hurt and miserable. Plus, Sam wouldn't heal as fast as Teddy. You know what? Scratch that, having a roommate wasn't nice. It just meant that someone else was getting carved up by these pricks too.
“I reckon Sirius probably smelled him in the compound and went to investigate. He’s not the type to ignore somethin’ like that Harry, you know that.”
"I'm not sure yet, but this is the footage from a few hours before you and Sam got home, Cas, and the door's opening. Let's see who the blonde bitch is, shall we?"
In case any of you were wondering, that bit about Harry's scar being different from the one in the movie comes from some fanart I've seen where it's drawn like an actual lightning strike instead of the little zigzag. I can't remember any specific artist, but there are a few different drawings I've seen and they're SO COOL so that's the headcanon I'm using in this story.
“Hullo. Ron Weasley. I figure that since our friends seem a bit wrapped up in their discussion at the moment that we might as well try and get to know each other.”
Sirius straightened up and pushed the mess of his hair back. “Yeah. Yeah, just. Need a minute. I’m uh—I’m just gonna go ahead and take Teddy to an actual bed. I’m—my brother died a fucking
. They were coming from, by her estimation, about two doors down. Dean started to move again, creeping slowly, crouched close to the wall, not making a sound. Cas went next, and then Mary followed suit, and the voices gradually got louder, though Mary still couldn't make out anything that was being said.
Greyback was anywhere in the vicinity until the bastard came crashing through the trees into the little clearing they were walking through with a blood-chilling howl and lept straight at Teddy.
"Go back and look around over there?" Dean turned around to face her, rubbing a hand over his face, and gave her a tired smile. "Yeah, that's a good idea."
“Mary died in 1983 and was resurrected earlier this week,” Casitel blurted out, then looked horrified with himself for his bluntness but kept on, turning to Mary before Ron had even
Mary had joined him in hustling as soon as she'd been properly clothed, and as it turned out, Dean had a complete card shark for a mom. Between her crushing the opposition in poker, and Dean's kicking ass in pool, they'd managed to stay fed and housed the whole way to Lebanon, and made far better time than they would've otherwise. Go them.
Hmm. Well that was certainly interesting. Ron looked at Harry, Harry raised an eyebrow, and they both turned back to watch the byplay.
“Sorry,” and to the younger man’s credit, he did look at it, “I’m just having some trouble figuring out how to explain...him...when you don’t...there are some things that you don’t know.”
“Hmm?” Gabriel said absently, before registering what the hunter had said, “Oh, nah. One of you three can have mine, or split it, whatever. I don’t need—”
Someone made a strangled noise behind him, which Dean ignored in favor of figuring out how this damn keyboard was supposed to work. The others came up behind him.
rage there, written in every line of his body alongside a barely contained violence that seemed to be waiting to erupt: he was a hunter after all, through and through (and she'd never wanted this for her boys
his real name,” Sam began as they used his knife (freshly cleaned with firewhiskey) to cut Teddy out of his ruined jeans, “but we-I-didn’t know that when Dean and I first met him, or the time after that. It was...the third time we ran into him, I think, when we found out. Cas was with us, and-anyway, that’s not important right now.
“No problem,” Dom said, hugging him back with an arm around his shoulders. “What else are cousins in oddly tight-knit families for?”
Sam took the bottle and poured a good half of what was left straight down his throat as he settled back onto his loveseat.
Palm to cheek, lips to lips, gently and oh so carefully. The tension coiled all through Dean's body wound impossibly tighter and for exactly one point four five horrified seconds Cas thought he'd somehow made it worse, but then...The only appropriate word Cas could think of in the English language for what Dean did just then (it truly was sadly limited) was
Maniacal? Sure. Ominously placid? Yup, and you’d better watch out because that usually meant he’d been plotting. Weird beyond all measure? More often than not. But never
Cas sighed, his eyes slipping closed for a moment, and Dean didn't think he'd registered just who it was who had responded.
“Teddy—the Moonlet—is missing. He got taken on an assignment for the Aurors. Dad and Uncle Ron are saying that they think it was Muggles, and I— I—”
Mind, if he was human, they wouldn't be in this mess in the woods in the first place because he would've bloody
He left Sam to...nap or brood, or whatever he wanted to do while Sirius was gathering the supplies. Sam probably would’ve helped Sirius with this if he’d asked, fever or no fever, but...aside from the more obvious reason of, Sam needed to
Dom groaned quietly, kissing at least a good chunk of her night’s sleep goodbye. It was a time-honoured family tradition to do whatever it was you were doing and didn’t want anyone else to know about in the middle of the night. Ergo, Dom was going to need to stage a stakeout just outside of the entrance to Gryffindor’s common room if she wanted to find out what Jamie was up to.
"I think you're right. We'll look into that later, see if we can't make some use of it. For now"—he turned back to Ketch to glare at him—”What kind of research were you involved in, exactly?"
I really hope you guys enjoyed this chapter. It might be a while before I get the next one finished and up what with all the rl craziness and stuff going on, but I'll get it done and up as soon as I can :)
“No, at least it’s never been recorded. I did a lot of research, after, after the war. The Department of Mysteries was built around it by the ancient Celtic wizards over two thousand years ago, before even the Romans came to Britain. That whole room, it’s older than most of the Wizarding World, the whole Ministry got built right on top of it.
hurt and sitting on the floor for so long had apparently done him no favors. If this was what being human felt like, he had to wonder what the hell his dad had been thinking. This was clearly a serious design flaw. Sirius clicked his tongue sympathetically and reached Gabriel up.
Mary grabbed the other chair for Castiel to sit on, then joined Ron in leaning over the angel’s shoulders so that they could see the screens.
Ron felt a bit of his tension melt away the instant he stepped foot on the grounds. It was really quite ironic, he supposed, how safe this place (well, most of it, at least) made him feel even after all this time, considering how many times he’d nearly died here. How many people actually had.
“Damn, do wizards do canned food? You can’t really live on water, is the vegetable garden still here? So we have nuts or something?”
He'd never thought he'd last long after Dean had truly gone anyway. As for Cas...Sam didn't let himself think about Cas.
Greyback roared, and the next thing Sirius knew, he was slamming hard into the trunk of a tree at the far side of the clearing with three stinging gashes running down his side. He'd definitely felt some of his ribs crack but he didn't think that the cuts were too bad, so as soon as his ears stopped ringing he was up and leaping back at the minger mauling Teddy.
? Cassie, his baby brother Cassie, lying comatose, but then awake and babbling about bees, so heartrendingly clearly out of his mind. He and Deano standing next to an exploding
Ugh. This was going to suck. At least he probably (hopefully, please) wasn’t going to have to talk about his own feelings.
"We goin' in guns blazing?" Mary asked, wanting to be sure on exactly what the plan was once they actually got into the compound.
“Right,” Mary said, still looking fairly overwhelmed. “Here, Ron, hand me a few of those, and I’ll get started on some spells we might be able to use.”
Dom had hugged Luna goodbye, and was halfway out the office door when Luna called out after her, “How are things going with Gracie?”
“Definitely not,” Harry murmured. “It would've been nice to know, but they’re better off lost, I think.”
He also saw the door open, along with, and there he took a moment just to make sure that two weeks in this place hadn't driven him completely mad, the enormous
Plus, Gabriel wasn’t entirely sure that his own epic breakdown wasn’t eminent, and though he realized that it was massively hypocritical of him, he didn’t want to have it right in front of his friend.
I normally wouldn't post a warning for this, but given how stressful real life is right now, this chapter gets pretty angsty at the begining. Please, please, PLEASE, take care of yourself, and if you're in a place where reading about characters having emotional breakdowns and is gonna put you or drive you further into a bad emotional state/headspace, SAVE THIS CHAPTER FOR LATER.
“Give me a few minutes, I’ll make some calls and I can drop him off somewhere on our way to fetch Hermione and head off to the DoM.”
