Steve pressed his mouth to Tony’s again.  It was filled with a sweet oblivion.  Tony could feel it.  Feel it in the solid weight of him, the slow, serpentine undulation of his hips, the open-mouthed promise of his kiss, and he felt like weeping.  This was happening.  Finally.  After so many years of denial and longing and desire and passion, Steve was completely his.  And he was completely Steve’s. They belonged to each other.  Tony was Steve’s only.  Steve was Tony’s last.  The vow hung unspoken around them like the soft haze of mist on a summer morning.
He leaned down and pressed his lips to Tony’s temple. Tony shifted, exhaling a little, his lips curving upward just the tiniest bit, but he didn’t wake up. Steve rolled his eyes fondly and kissed his shoulder. His ear. He curled his hand into Tony’s and laughed a little when Tony stayed stubbornly asleep. “Are you
“It has to be, Steve.  Because we need him, and we need you, and we need you together.  We’ll all die if you aren’t.”
between them, something basic and greedy and hot that always put both of them on edge when they were together.  Or when they were apart.  Sometimes all it took was the mere mention of Steve’s name to throw Tony off balance.  And then there had been the post- and sometimes pre-battle jerk-off sessions he indulged in so frequently.  How many times had he wished Steve was there with him, gripping him, stroking him, getting on his knees in front of him, or just throwing him down and pounding into him until they both came so hard they’d see stars?
Tony let himself get pulled inside the door.  He was still speechless.  A thousand thoughts and questions whirled in his head.  He couldn’t pick one.  They all seemed just beyond his grasp.
Steve was looking at the unfamiliar airstrip.  Nothing so grand as an “airport” here.  There was a long runway, a small terminal with twenty or so cars around it, dormant in the dark.  The lights were on in the terminal, however, and a few people milled around inside.  Tony was struck by how warm and intimate it looked from  here, standing outside in the cold.  If he could have reached out and taken Steve’s hand, it would not have been quite so lonely, looking at that island of light in the darkness.  As it was, he felt lonelier than he should have.  Colder too.
Bruce looked at him, discomfort very clear on his face, then pushed his sad salad away with the side of his hand. “I think I’m done,” he said.
Tony blinked away his own sudden tears. He hurt. He hurt for Steve, for the things he had said, for the way he was feeling. Tony gathered him in his arms and held him tight against his chest. Steve stiffened, then melted into the embrace. Tony sagged a little under his weight, but he straightened his back and bore him up.
He shifted again, turning onto his back, and there were his eyes, cloudy but open, and blue, and looking at him.  Looking at him.
to do it, he hadn’t had the chance.  First, Steve was too broken by Thanos, and then he’d been taken to The Raft.  Then had come the uneasy in-between-time where neither of them dared indulge in anything physical, and now Steve was
“I don’t want to do anything, Tony,” he said.  “Is that okay?  Can’t we just go home and...Can’t we just go home?”
Steve snapped his head towards him, his face a swirl of emotions, humor, pain, not knowing which one to feel.  Tony smiled at him, and Steve smiled back, clearly relieved.  “Same old Tony,” he said.  “Always a smart-ass.”
there. And so what if he and Pepper had never had a great passion between them? So what if they were more like best friends than true lovers? It didn’t matter. They had a marriage. A good, solid, comfortable marriage. That was what he needed. That was what he wanted to give to Morgan. A homelife uncorrupted. Untainted. That was what he had promised her the second he saw her. That was what he would provide for her. And his feelings for Steve--his desire, and want, and passion--well, that could just stay in his memories. Stay locked away in his heart, a secret thing that he only took out and examined only so very rarely. Like fine crystal used only for the most special occasions.
They sat trading lazy, soft kisses, murmuring sweet words and promises into each other’s mouths, hands touching, exploring innocently, affectionately.  Time passed.  Time stood still.  Time did not exist.  Not here, not in this place where they were alone together in the almost-darkness.  This place where they both gave and took what they needed.  What they wanted.
“Hey,” Tony said, brushing his thumb along Steve’s cheekbone again. “If you don’t want to, Steve, it’s okay. I totally get it. I understand. It’s fine.”
“What are you doing out here anyway?” Steve asked. “Shouldn’t you be in there with Josh? Dancing...or whatever it was you were doing?”
“It’s not that I don’t want to tell you,” he said, as she walked away.  “But there are legalities involved.  If he was staying at the Sanctum, I’d just tell you, because he’d be there as a friend and a guest in my home.  But this is a hospital.  I don’t own it.  Technically, I don’t even work there.  I’m just a consulting physician.  They have their rules and regulations they need to follow.”
“That’s why I can’t,” Tony said tonelessly. “Not because I love her more than you. It’s not even possible for me to love her more than you. But I can’t bail on her. I can’t. Not even for you. I have to be a better father than Howard was to me.”
“Yes, you do,” Steve said. “People do it all the time. Me and him are together. We’ve been together for almost a year.” He clenched his hands together, trying to keep his whirling mind from spinning completely out of control. He’d thought about this. For the past week, he’d thought of nothing but this. Ever since he and Pietro had fought about it.
She looked away, troubled, and he thought he knew what it was.  There was only one thing that could make her look like that.  He waited.
“Of course, it will.  Just stay in bed all day,” he said, punctuating each sentence with small, careful kisses against Steve’s jaw.  “Eat ice cream.  Watch
They climbed the metal ladder that led up to it and sat side by side, shoulders pressed together, leaning against the wall.  Nat pulled a blanket over their laps and motioned to the cooler.  “Do you want anything?”
“And Tony’s,” she said, pulling back and wiping her cheeks with her hands. “Because I prayed for his happiness too. And it’s certainly not Father Callahan’s business--or anyone else’s for that matter--if I prayed for you to find it
He thought about it for a minute. Thought about the ‘but’ that seemed to hover over every interaction, every thought he had about a life with Tony and Morgan in it. He thought about it, but he couldn’t quite put a finger on what it was. Why he still had reservations about this. Why he couldn’t jump in with both feet the way Sarah, and Sam, and Tony wanted him to do.
“Do you have everything?” she asked, and Steve nodded, bending to lift Morgan up into his arms. She clutched his neck just as tightly as Sarah was holding Tony.
The sun was shining through the windows when he woke. It lay in a puddle beside him, and he stretched his hand out into it, feeling the warmth of it filling his palm like liquid gold. He smiled a little, his eyes still closed, and sighed. He felt good. Really good. His soft bed. Warm sunshine. Scent of coffee in his nose. Sound of murmuring voices in his ear.
After their fight, it was easier to avoid each other, so that was what they did. School was almost out. Graduation was in a few days. When they saw each other--which wasn’t that often, but inevitable--they gave each other awkward “hey”s, and then stood, shuffling their feet, mumbling about classes and finals. Muttering stuff like “maybe we should get together sometime...”, and replies of “yeah, but I’ve really gotta study too, so…” They let it go at that. Even though they both knew the other was lying. Right now, neither really cared. Right now, it was almost a relief to not have to deal with it. Deal with each other. Or, at least, the each other that had existed in Steve’s bedroom the last time they really, genuinely spoke. It was as if neither thought there was anything left to be said--Tony was going away for the summer. Steve was going away for what amounted to one-sixth of his young life--and they both hated it. Hated that the one person they had loved and trusted almost more than anyone else had let them down in such a deep, fundamental way.
The eyes she turned on him were as black and cold as the night sky she had come from.  “You’re the one,” she said.
“We’ve eaten in restaurants together, he said, “but just you and me?  Alone like this?” he shook his head.
“I’m the Sorcerer Supreme, and I have the Time Stone at my disposal,” Strange dead-panned.  “Nothing’s impossible.”
“No,” he said, and brought her hand to his mouth. He kissed her fingers then released her. “It’s good you keep in touch. He loved you. Before. You know.” He let out a breath and tried to smile for her. “I’m glad you’re still in his corner, Mom. He needs that, I think.”
Steve closed his eyes and leaned his head back against Tony’s stomach.  “Then why do I have to write this?”
He did the same thing now, right up until he reached for the polished brass handle and opened the door.
And then he was breathing deeply and steadily again, sleeping against Steve’s chest, his heart matching Steve’s beat for beat.  Steve stayed awake for a little longer, enjoying the sensations of Tony’s breath, his minute movements, the smell of him, the feel of him.
Tony slanted a finger across his lips.  Whether it was to keep her from speaking or himself from vomiting, he didn’t know.
Once in the bedroom, Steve grasped the end of Tony’s tie as he backed him toward the bed. “You’re still wearing this.”
He laughed a little. “Like I must have been the dumbest fucking kid in the world, ‘cause I just keep loving you more. Every day, baby. Every single day.”
He didn’t bother changing Nat, Clint, or Bruce’s status.  They could get in anyway.  It would have just made a lot of extra work for everyone.  He didn’t change Rhodey’s either.  He had a code for FRIDAY that could lock even Tony out.  There was literally no point.  Thor had never had an access code in the first place.  He came and went how and when he wanted.  Tony secretly thought FRIDAY was a little afraid of him and just overrode everything when she saw him coming.
Tony licked his lips.  Nerves were beginning to flutter in his stomach.  “So, there’s the lake,” he continued, talking fast, the words spilling out of his mouth in an untidy jumble.  “I mean, obviously, there’s the lake.  Big-ass body of water is usually called a lake, right?  The kitchen’s old, but everything works.  Strange sent me copies of all your meds--don’t be pissed, I know it’s personal, I’m sorry, I just wanted to make sure you had what you needed, and to be fair, I’d probably be the one to go get them anyway, so I just saved a trip.  Also, there’s a couple of those RZR ATV things out back.  They’re death traps, but I saw a gang--like a literal gang, Steve, I think they were showing colors and everything--of ten-year-olds driving them when I came up before, so I had to get some.  We can’t be the only kids on the block without toys, right?”
Steve smiled a little, holding her close to his heart. “Well, not a superhero,” he said, “but protecting people is part of it, I guess, yeah.”
Steve looked away, back down at the lake.  A few gulls had landed on the sandy beach.  They strutted here and there self-importantly, reminding Tony of some of the members of the Board of Stark Industries.  Steve’s thumb had crept to his mouth and he started gnawing on the nail.  It was a habit he’d picked up over the last few weeks.  Tony didn’t like it.  It worried him.
He hadn’t slept in the same bed with someone--anyone--since Pepper, and he missed it.  He’d never been one to sleep alone.  It was always better when there was someone else there, someone else to curl up with, to touch, to listen to, even if it was just their breath or their heartbeat.
Tony powered down the gauntlet, and it melted from his hand.  It had felt strange having it on again.  Good, but strange.  Like putting on a wedding-day suit jacket a year after the divorce.  “I’m not going to kill you,” he said.  “I probably should, but I’m not going to.”
do it, Tony. Everything they want me to do, I can do. They give me an order, and I do it. They don’t wonder if I can get it done, they just know I can. And that makes it so
“Yeah?” Tony said, grinding his hips down into Steve’s, making him moan. “Is that what you want, baby? Want me to make the big bad wolf howl?”
“Steve?” Tony said, and pulled back enough to look up into his eyes. “Baby. Don’t you want that? Don’t you want me again?”
“They’re gone,” she assured him when the coughing fit passed.  “Carol, Thor, and Tony got the ones that were left.”
Steve shook his head, everything else suddenly lost in a wave of sensuality and feeling and complete and utter love for the man holding him. “No, Tony,” he said, and it was the right answer. He knew it was.
She stood sill, his hands lingering on her shoulders. She looked at Tony and Pepper for a long time, then she turned her head, slowly, deliberately. Steve followed her gaze to where Clint still sat with his wife and their baby. Laura was cradling the child now, and Clint’s arm was thrown over her shoulders, leaning into her, his head resting against hers. Even from this distance, they gave off a clean, simple love.
“Uh,” Steve said. And that was all. His brain was a blank, black hole. He raised his hands helplessly. There was nowhere to put them.
Sam laughed. “Do you listen to anything I say? Am I even here? I know you really only listen when loverboy is--”
tend to fall apart when he had no outlet.  Steve kept him sane.  Not by being something broken that he needed to fix, though.  It was actually the opposite.  When he was with Steve, everything just seemed simpler.  He didn’t need to fix Steve.  When they were together, it felt like Steve was fixing him.
Steve came last and hesitated outside the door, looking in.  His heart expanded at the sight of everyone inside and grieved for all those who should be here and were not.  That was mostly on him.  He’d known it since the moment the burner-cell vibrated in his pocket and Bruce’s scared voice spilled out the story of Thanos and what it meant for all of them.  He took a lot of the responsibility for the chasm that existed between one half of the team and the other.  He had been their leader, the one they looked to for a cool head and a clear-cut plan.  He had failed them.  He had failed them all.
Steve shook his head, tugged his hand again. He didn’t know for sure what Howard had said to him--he felt like Tony always downplayed whatever happened to upset him--but there was no way in hell he was going to send him off to a hotel. Especially alone. Especially this time of night. Especially when he was hurting and sad. “Please?” he said, looking at him from under his lashes. “Tony, please come inside. I want you to stay, okay? If you want to go to a hotel tomorrow, then we can talk about that, but please stay here tonight. I’ll sleep on the couch if you want to be alone, but please stay here. Okay?”
Ross flipped a page in his folder.  “As you know, The Raft is designed to house the most dangerous criminals in the world.  While I have no doubt you’d fit right in with them, you will be kept in isolation for the duration of your imprisonment.  You will be kept in an area that is separate and secure.”  Ross looked up from his papers, his eyes alight.  “Only one other man has ever stayed in that cell, Rogers.  It’s practically factory-sealed.  Just for you.”
Tony sputtered a little, stunned, then pounced on him and rolled him back over so he could climb on top of him.  "Oh, no you don't,
And now that voice was almost always on his side.  It almost always was a help to him.  Instead of self-hatred, it had become the voice of self-preservation instead.  And it helped.  Especially when Steve wasn’t near him, it helped.
Ordinarily, that shrug would have irked Steve a bit. Even if it meant explaining his peculiar metabolism to a perfect stranger, he would rather do that than think this kid was letting a gaggle of drunks loose on New York with only a shrug to light their way. But not tonight. Tonight he’d let it go with a little shrug of his own and try hard to drown his sorrows with seven or eight or ten rounds of scotch.
“I really do know it’s stupid,” Steve said, but he felt good. God. So good. Like this was another promise he’d made. Or, at least one he was in the
Sam came to this one. Rhodey. Pepper. Nick Fury. Maria Hill. It had been a quiet couple of weeks. Nobody believed that evil ever took a week or two off, but for some reason, it felt like it. Maybe all the bad guys were busy making plans for later attacks. Or maybe it was just too damn hot. Whatever the reason, it had been pretty calm, and they all thought they could use a celebration.
She went back to the computer.  The download was complete, but she scrolled through his notes a bit further, fascinated.  “Ross, you bad boy, you,” she whispered, as her eyes caught words like “Internalized demons” and “Heightened trauma” and “Induced violent tendencies” and everywhere, covering the page like bloodied handprints: “Rogers.  Rogers.  Rogers.”
Tony leaned closer to look at the last one. His heart sped up as he gazed at it. The backdrop was sand. Just sand, and an eye-wateringly blue sky over the top of it. Steve was standing, slightly at attention, his hands behind his back, a small, complicated smile on his face. He was wearing his fatigue pants, a white t-shirt. His dog-tags were hidden beneath his shirt, but the sun glinted on the chain going around his neck. Tony’s eyes were drawn to his shadow, how dark it looked against the sand. How sharp the edges of it were. For a brief moment he thought of Peter Pan who had once lost his shadow. Steve hadn’t lost his, but he seemed like he had lost something else. Tony’s eyes searched that face in the photograph, then he turned and looked up at the real thing here beside him.
Steve tucked his head into the crook of Tony’s neck so he could feel him nod. He wrapped his arms around him and held on like his life depended on it. Like Tony was the most important thing in the world to him. Because he was.
Not in the face of the sweetness they shared between them  The warmth, the soft barrier of love they had always been able to weave around themselves when they were together like this.  Something that held the goodness in and banished everything else into some cold outer darkness where it would wait until they parted once more.
He got up, made his bed like he had in the army, tight and smooth, then went through the room, setting it to rights as he did every morning.  Part of this routine came from the military, part came from his mother.  She’d liked everything neat and in its place.
anything. To anybody, you know? I don’t think I-” he blinked fast and hard, but the tears still pooled in his lashes, “I don’t think I
The temperature in the room had risen steadily, the red mist that had begun as only a few wisps tying Steve and Wanda’s hands together like an ancient bonding ceremony now wafted throughout the whole of the room.
Steve shook his head and tried to pull his hands out of wanda’s.  “No,” he said with a terrible finality.  “No.  I’m not doing it.  I won’t put her through that.”
Tony held onto him, breathing in his scent, basking in his nearness.  Ross had wanted to take this away from him.  From
The salesman raised an eyebrow and gestured at the watch still in front of him and the room in general. “We’re a vintage shop, sir. Classic is all we carry.” The corner of his mouth lifted in a cool smile. “However, if you aren’t seeing anything you like, perhaps you should try somewhere else. I hear Target has a fine selection of
He mumbled something else.  Something that sounded very much like “MMmphhrmmm.”  Natasha rolled her eyes.
Tony gave Steve’s hand a squeeze, then grabbed a plate from the couple still stacked on the counter. “But look at her now,” he said. “How many is that for you, peanut? Ten? Twenty?”
“I finally picked up Lang.  He said Stark’s com got damaged.  Said he could only hear one word in ten, so he shut it down.”
Steve turned his hand and clasped Bucky’s. He smiled, feeling a warmth in his chest that he used to only have with his mother, and now he had with Sam, and Bucky, and Nat too. He didn’t count Tony. Not because he didn’t want to, but because he still did want to. More than he should.
“Boundaries?  Are you kidding me?  I can’t even count how many times you’ve burst in on me in the shower to show me cat videos or climbed into my bed in the middle of the night to spoon me.  Don’t talk to me about boundaries!”
Steve looked up. His eyes were very bright, sparkling with love and a light sheen of unshed tears. He shook his head. “That doesn’t scare me.”
Tony got lost in the sensation of Steve’s mouth on his fingers, the gentle brush of his lips against the knuckles.  So lost he almost missed his turn and had to yank it away to down-shift.  “Shit,” he muttered under his breath as he goosed the brake and spun the wheel.
Steve moved in his sleep, turned his head, a low moan in the back of his throat.  He’d been asleep for two hours.
“Why especially now?” Tony asked, and his voice sounded slow in his own ears. Slow, almost drugged with the things Howard was saying. With the things he, himself, was feeling.
“Hey,” he called, and both the sheriff and Steve looked up.  Tony had eyes for only one of them.  “Hey, you.”
Steve laughed under his breath. He took a step away from Tony’s side, but kept hold of his hand, holding it like a lifeline. “Are you sure you don’t mind if I shower?”
Thor left and Steve thought again that Asgard would be in good hands if Thor took up the mantle of king.  Steve himself certainly felt better than he had in days.  If someone as good as Thor could still see something in him then maybe there was still hope.
He looked at the razor again.  It looked innocuous sheathed in its black casing, but the danger was still there, just out of sight.  “I don’t want to distract you.”
“No,” Tony breathed.  “There just always has been.  Before.  There’s always been one.”  He laughed a little.  “And it’s kind of scary.”
“You can’t do that, Steve,” Tony said, coming around the bench.  He went into the little bathroom and came back out with a first aid kit.
“I want you too,” Steve said. He moved his hands down Tony’s body, catching the hem of his t-shirt and pulling it up to reveal his lean torso. He bent to kiss his stomach, licked a slow line from his navel to his neck.
if Tony heard correctly, but he ignored him again. Steve ignored him too, not even batting an eye, and that made Tony feel even better about how things were going here between them this morning. He hadn’t wanted to admit it, but he’d been a little worried. He was also
“That’s what I’m talking about.  You care so goddamn much.  Not just about me,” he said, then ran a possessive hand up Steve’s arm, “but it always felt like maybe you cared about me more than the average Avenger.”
,” Steve said, then ran his fingers over the cat’s smooth back.  “I think he needed a little quiet, too.”
Tony looked into his eyes for a long time, searching them, then kissed him again, soft and long.  “Okay,” he said.  “Okay.”
Tony held out the bouquet of flowers he’d run out and bought after his nap. “For you,” he said, and it sounded silly in his head, but Steve’s happy smile settled him even further.
Tony was sitting in his office at Stark Industries.  He didn’t do full-time there anymore, but once or twice a week, he came in, let Pepper brief him, took her to lunch, went over whatever paperwork he had, then went home and had Steve fuck him into oblivion.  He needed it after his SI days.  Sometimes he wondered what he’d done before he’d had Steve to help him relax, and then he remembered exactly what he did.  This was so much better.
God, he hadn’t done any homework when he was in school the first time--or just read a book until he dozed off.
Steve tucked the sheet into the couch cushions and laid the blanket over the top, creating a little nest. Dodger sniffed around with interest. Steve laughed and gave him a pat on the head. “Not for you, buddy,” he said. “You’ve got your own bed.”
Steve slid to the edge of the seat and gazed up at Tony’s face. He shook his head slowly, seriously from side to side. “I don’t think the city buses go to New Hampshire, Tony.”
He put his arm around her.  “You don’t hate me,” he soothed.  “How can you hate me?  I got you free bagels.”
Really going to end it on the next chapter. I know I've said that before, but I'm serious this time! I know I've said THAT before too, but...
She put her hand against his cheek and held it there. He didn’t know how much she knew about his and Tony’s relationship. He hadn’t told her anything. If she knew anything, it came from Tony himself. And from mother’s intuition and her own eyes. Because they were searching his face now, probing out his secrets, making him feel raw and exposed, like a live wire.
He shoved the thought away. Just like he’d done a thousand times for the last sixteen days. He was still in his office. Working. Always working. Just a busy little bee. That was him. If nothing else, this little feud he was having with Steve was certainly making him much more productive on the work-front. Even Pepper had commented on it. Praised him for his sudden hard-on for paperwork. She didn’t use those exact words, but he knew what she meant. And for that reason, he kept pushing. He liked making her happy, and if this made her happy, he’d keep it up. He just wished it wasn’t so boring
Steve laughed in the back of his throat. “Is this about Clint? You know he was just joking, right? He’s happy for us.”
Steve smiled.  Looks could be deceiving.  “She was,” he said, “except when she was telling me to move my ass or shooting at me.”
Steve was silent for a long time, just sitting with his head in his hand, his blue eyes closed.  Tony didn’t prompt him, but he did watch him.  He watched the slight rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.  He watched his hair move in the breeze that blew around them.  He watched him and loved him and kicked a lightning-quick prayer out to the universe that Steve would get over this.  He couldn’t be without him again.  Not now.  Not ever again.  And it was partly because Steve was right.  He
“She could have anybody,” Bucky told Steve as they sat playing checkers in Bucky’s hospital bed. “Why would she want...this?” He flicked a hand at his missing arm. He was bruised, his skin healing from the burns, but he still managed a lopsided smile.
Steve tapped the middle of his chest.  There was a faraway look in his eyes, a peacefulness that only came into view when he talked about Stark.  That’s why Strange kept asking.  He hated asking.  In his opinion, Stark was an arrogant prick, but Steve liked talking about him, and when he opened up about Stark, he would open up about everything else, too.  Health issues, mental issues, whatever else.  Strange grudgingly thanked Stark for that in his head.  The douchebag.
Steve smiled softly, and sighed like he was giving up.  “Fine,” he said.  “But later, okay?  When I get home?”
He milled around the edges of the party, chatting up a few of the party-goers. Howard spied him and came to say hello. A couple of members of the Board followed on his heels, and soon Tony was surrounded by a bunch of people, mostly talking shop--which was boring, but necessary at parties like this--and by the time he was able to take a furtive glance at his watch, he saw it was seven-thirty.
“I’ll clear one out tomorrow,” Steve said, and bent down to kiss him. “I’ll clear out as many as you want.”
During the couple of weeks during the summer when they’d been fighting, Tony had made it a habit to halt the elevator on this floor, then wander oh-so-casually past Steve’s door just in case he might catch him out and force him to talk, but he had not been inside the actual living space in...well, ever.
He jerked his arm out of Tony’s grip.  “Does your arrogance know no bounds?  What you’re suggesting is so far beyond unethical it’s almost criminal.”
Something flashed through his mind.  A memory?  Maybe he hadn’t hit rock-bottom, after all.  He raised a hand to his temples and rubbed them, trying to coax it out.  “Wait, didn’t you say something about hurricane clean-up?”
--in the most intimate ways, it did not compare even marginally to this. The tension and anticipation he knew in the moment of time before his mouth met Steve’s.
They went in to bed later, after the storm had passed, and lay fully entwined, pressed together from shoulder to ankle, arms tight around each other.  They woke up the same way, and Tony called Pepper and told her he wasn't going to London. Somebody else would have to go.
Tony sat down beside him, then raised an eyebrow when he saw Sir Purr curled up against Steve’s thigh.  “Nothing to be sorry about,” he said.  “That place was a mad-house.  Kind of worth it to hear Nick Fury and Thor doing a duet of ‘You Light up my Life’, though.”  Tony reached over Steve and pet the top of Sir Purr’s head.  “I am, however, disappointed that you’re keeping the baby up.”
because Steve said it was okay. Even though he knew that was exactly the reason. They may not have seen each other for five years, but Tony still trusted him implicitly. Would still put his own--and apparently his daughter’s--safety in his hands with absolutely no compunctions.
Tony cleared his throat. “Yeah,” he muttered, “uh, how ‘bout we keep that between you and me, ‘kay?”
“I tried,” she said. “I got to a hundred.” She gazed up at him, and he knew what was coming. He knew. “Can I sleep with you?”
It was entirely different from his reunion with Natasha.  With her, it had been like he was falling into her, letting her catch him, letting her hold him and heal him.  The way he was with Wanda was nothing like that.  In Tony’s arms just now, Steve had been soft and pliant, taking comfort and care, but when he put his arms around the girl beside him, he seemed almost to swell.  He became larger, even to Tony’s eyes, harder, a protective barrier between her and the world.  Natasha had said Steve was like a father to Wanda, and Tony saw it now in full force.  The way he held her against his chest, letting her tuck her head under his chin, his jaw firm and strong, his eyes soft.  Tony had never experienced a fatherly hug, but this was one.  This was the epitome of one, and the slight jealousy he felt paled in comparison to the utter awe and pride he felt in Steve.
Tony took the pizza with one hand and trailed the other softly and deliberately across Steve’s throat.  He was rewarded with a ragged sigh and a glimpse of Steve’s pink tongue as it left his mouth to wet his lips.  He closed his eyes, too, and kept them closed as Tony took the pizza back to the table and sat it down next to FRIDAY’s daisies.  Kept them closed as Tony adjusted the plates and napkins.  Kept them closed while Tony snapped off the light, leaving the room in a deep semi-darkness, lit only by the warm glow of the candles and the shifting red-orange or the fire crackling in the large stone hearth.
“You don’t think much about being happy when you’re a kid, do you, Stark?” Bucky asked.  His eyes had taken on a sort of cloudy look, dreamy.  Tony could almost see him replaying some childhood memory behind those eyes.  He wished he could see it behind his own.  “You’re either happy or you’re not, and you just go with it because that’s what kids do.  They adapt.”  Bucky looked at the floor.  “But when you get older, sometimes it’s
“Hey,” he said.  “Soup’s on.”  When Steve didn’t respond, he halved the distance between them.  “We should get one of those old-timey dinner bells that the cowboy guys used to have.  You know, the guys on the whadoyoucallems, with those triangle things?”
As I was getting this ready to post, I thought I should say some extra thanks since, here in America, it's almost Thanksgiving, and then I thought, "I think I did that last year". And then I was like, WHAT???? I haven't been posting on here for a year! So I looked back at my first story, and sure enough. It has been a year since I started posting. Good god, where did this time go? So much has changed in my life and in the world in general, but what hasn't changed it how grateful I am for all of you reading this right now. Thank you so much for all you have added to my life!! I really do love you all so much!!
He hugged Natasha again, then let her go.  “Love you too, kid,” he said.  “And thanks for coming over.  I don’t like the holidays, and they suck twice as much if you have to do them alone.”
“It’s okay, Bruce,” she said, but her eyes were on Tony now.  Questioning, defiant, ready to either comfort or fight, whichever he chose.  She would either rise to the occasion or lower herself to it, her eyes said so.
Tony pulled him back down into his arms again. “For me, too,” he said into Steve’s neck. “I’m glad you’re home.”
, only the five of them remained.  There’d been no communication from Clint, that he knew of, at least.  But Nat played them close to the vest when it came to Clint, and he didn’t press her about it.  If she was in contact with Barton, she would tell him eventually.  She would have to.
She kissed him, then lifted his head from her shoulder. She touched the skin under his eye with her soft fingers. “I love you too, honey,” she said, and drew him closer one more time to kiss his cheek. “Now go downstairs and find Tony. He’s been missing you.”
It feels like I haven't posted for a long time. Things have been kicking my ass. I have a long chapter written, but I was scared it was starting to get TOO long, so I decided to break it up into two sections. This one's a little short, but it was the most natural spot for a break. I will post the next part tomorrow or the next day.
“Okay.” He said it like he was relenting, and Steve heard the humor in his voice, but he heard something else too--Tony’s own need. His own want. There was a heat under the humor. Tony could not disguise it any more than Steve could stop his own muscles from trembling. “Okay, baby. I’ll give you what you want.”
He stood up and ruffled Steve’s hair.  “No, I’m tired, too.”  He leaned closer.  “Besides, if we cut out now, these guys have to clean up.”
A warm glow lit in his chest and he welcomed it.  After hearing what Steve had went through the last three months, he needed a little warmth.
they were alone.  They knew what tomorrow would bring.  They didn’t have the Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.
Steve grinned, looking like a kid again, the way he’d looked when he was seventeen and Tony had jumped up onto his back and had him carry him up the rest of the stairs. They’d said ‘I love you’ that day. But they’d fought first. Fought over Howard.
Then Tony turned his head and saw him standing there. He stood up straight, his lips curving into that smile that Steve loved so much, the one that felt like Tony reserved just for him, and Steve tried to etch that into his memory too. This one came a little easier, because he’d seen it before. Of course he had. He’d seen it almost every day for an entire school year six years ago. Steve smiled back and came the rest of the way down the hall.
“You don’t have to miss it anymore,” Steve said. “I’ll just do it. I’ll do whatever you want, Tony. Whenever you want. From now on.”
Steve propped his feet comfortably up on Tony’s thighs. “It took a while for the list to happen,” he said. “For a long time, I really just focused on the stuff they thought I needed to know.” He smiled again, but this time, it seemed forced. “There was a lot. The world just moved on without me. It’s a strange thing. Realizing you’re not really that essential. That the world just keeps turning whether you’re there or not.”
, for god’s sake.  Where were the callouses?  Where was the menthol scent of cheap shaving lotion?  Where were the ocean blue eyes that should be looking at him from under sooty lashes set into pale-as-cream skin?
“That was not your fault,” she flashed out.  “Don’t you ever say that.  You, and Carol, and Thor, and St-” she stopped, took a breath, and started again.  “You saved us all.  If not for you, half the universe would still be gone.  If not for you…” she looked down at her hands, into the dark depths of the cup between them.  When she met his eyes again, they were filled with steel.  “If not for you, Steve would be dead.”
“Yes. I did. I let you go a hundred times, but I always meant it. It was always you. There’s never been anybody else for me. Just you, Tony. Just you.” Steve kissed him hard. “I would have just gone on alone if we hadn’t met again that day. That was what I had planned on. I didn’t want anybody else. I
“No,” she said, her eyes cutting to Tony then back again. “No, just come pick me up. I’ll be ready at five.”
A small smile played over Tony’s lips, looking one second confident, the next, unsure.  “How does it end?”
“Not to me.  But I’m not his psychiatrist.  They’re actually considering some kind of hypno-therapy.  I’m not sure I approve, but…” he trailed off into a disgruntled silence.
Sarah held his hand one more time as the nurse injected anesthesia into her IV. “It’s going to be okay, honey,” she said, and Steve nodded. He couldn’t speak. His tongue was locked to the roof of his mouth and refused to budge. “I love you. Okay? I love you, and it’s going to be fine.” He nodded.
Steve came back to the bed and sat down. Tony took his hand, held it in his. Brought it to his mouth and kissed it. Their eyes met in the dim. Tony could see regret in Steve’s, but he knew it wasn’t because of what had happened between them. It was because of this. Because he had to leave again. Tony swallowed the tears that rose in his throat. The last thing he wanted to do right now was cry in front of Steve. He didn’t want him taking that with him back to Afghanistan. That wasn’t a burden he should have to carry. He was carrying too much already.
Tony continued to suck, working him through his first orgasm with blithe efficiency. Steve had read somewhere that once you did something thirty times, you were an expert. If that was the case, Tony was definitely an expert at this, and it showed. He knew just what to do, just the right amount of suction, just how to move his lips and tongue to leave Steve a shuddering, liquid puddle of gratification. It was familiar, but never boring. Never quite the same no matter how many times they did this. Tony was an expert at that too.
He took his phone out of his pocket and pressed a couple of buttons.  Tony watched him curiously, adorable-Bruce still in full-effect.
Steve’s paralysis and control broke at the same time.  He slid his arm around Tony’s waist as he’d dreamed of doing so many times, and spun them around.  He pressed himself fully against Tony, capturing him between the door and his own body.  Tony took in a sharp breath and clutched Steve’s shoulder with one hand.  The other came up and knotted itself in Steve’s hair.
But someone in the family needed to know where he was.  Why he was gone for so long with no word.  Someone needed to know in case Ross decided to take this matter into his own hands and do something more extreme than mere imprisonment.  Steve didn’t think it would come to that.  He thought Ross liked the idea of Captain America in his pet prison just a little too much to want to end it early.  Steve could hear the phantom-Tony who sometimes spoke in his head say,
And that broke him. Not that he was really angry in the first place. Upset and nervous more than anything.
them. And not entirely out of selfish reasons. Although he would be lying if he said it didn’t make it easier for Steve to try and let himself be happy, knowing they were too.
back when he was young. He’d had drugs. And drinks. And acquaintances who masqueraded as friends. He’d had random nights with random people. Three-ways, and four-ways, and every-way but the one way that counted.
could have been.  Smart.  Funny.  Sweet.  Respectful.  It’s probably a good thing he hadn’t met him until he was older.  That way, Tony hadn’t had too much time to fuck him up with his bad influence.  Peter already had the basic goodness instilled.  Tony could just give him the good parts of himself.  He thought he could do that now.
Steve grasped Wanda with gentle hands.  “Will you go back to the Tower with Tony?  This has been a lot.  You need to rest.”
He re-traced his way back down the steps and unlocked the door. He’d kept Mrs. Perkins’s welcome mat when he moved in--
Steve shook his head.  “No.”  He took his bag out of the car.  “I’m tired.  I’ll just kip on the couch, then I’ll get out of your hair tomorrow.”
The bartender saw him coming and shook his head when Steve sat his glass down. “I gotta cut you off, man,” he said.
Tony curled his hands into the blanket and brought it to his face.  It was Steve’s and it smelled like him, the spicy, menthol scent of his aftershave and good, old-fashioned soap.
Steve caught himself on his elbow, and kept moving into the dust and barbecue scent of what was at least pain and danger and probably death.
The light.  That’s what wouldn’t leave his head.  The goddamn light Steve had mentioned.  It had just been one thing, so why did it seem like
Steve wet his lips--nothing sexy about it now, just a man preparing himself for a chore that could prove difficult--and moved the footrests out of the way.
Sam shook his head.  “You know better than that.  Erskine didn’t design Steve.  He enhanced him, maybe, but he didn’t design him.  Somebody else did that.”
Are these chapters too short? I guess its a toss-up between more frequent updates or longer chapters. Oh well. I'm just going with it, guys. It's all about the whims right now. :):):)
“Steve.” Both Steve and Tony looked to the doorway. Sam was standing there. He was wearing a suit too. “We gotta go. We’re going to be late.”
Steve nodded.  Tried to smile.  “Good.  That’s good.”  He stepped away from the picture, away from Tony, and waved a hand at where the cars had sat for so long while he worked on them.  The stalls were empty now.  The ‘Cuda still outside, the other car gone, too.
I put a tag for underage. Do I tag this for underage? It's not a pervy underage, but I guess technically, it's underage, so a'tagging I shall go.
The look of dawning realization was a wonder to behold.  As was the pink blush that colored his cheeks.  Tony smiled wider, loving the fact that all it took to make Steve blush was hinting at the mention of an erection.  It was funny, considering what his hands and mouth had been up to not thirty seconds before.
Bucky had followed his gaze. And Steve wondered just how in the fuck he could do that, when Steve himself was focusing all his attention on looking like he wasn’t looking. You know. Looking like he wasn’t looking at the way Tony’s boyfriend was busy licking and sucking on him like he was an ice cream cone. And how Tony was letting it happen. Not just
Wow. Here we go. Finally. I haven't written anything in about 3 weeks. At one point, I opened my writing program and it told me my last edit had been 9 days ago. And I'm pretty sure that "edit" had been when I opened it, took away one comma, then closed it again. I can't even blame it all on work, even though November and December are our busiest months. I've just fallen down a rabbit-hole of trash tv and laziness. Sorry. For anyone who was wondering if I ever planned on posting again, sorry. Anyway, here's another chapter. It's not the greatest, but we're getting to the end now.
He glanced at the robe lying at the foot of the bed.  His intel said the wife had been gone for three days.  Three days, and yet the robe was still there?  That seemed like a long time to leave it there for a man as fastidious as Ross seemed to be in all other respects.
Steve held her solidly against him.  He pet her long red hair, then settled his palm against the back of her head, cradling it with great care.  “I should only be so lucky,” he murmured, and she nodded against his chest.
Tony pulled reluctantly back at the sound of his voice.  “What is it?” he asked.  “Too much?”  Tony was in utter awe of his own ability to keep his voice gentle when his body was in such a state of rampant turmoil.  His own heart thundered in his chest; his hands shook.  His cock was hot and heavy, straining against his pants.  His skin sizzled, especially where Steve’s fingers touched, restlessly moving, leaving him in flames.
Steve ducked his head, a slow blush rising out of his collar. “No,” he said. “I think I’m gonna go sleep on the couch.”
Tony shook his head slowly, any trace of iciness he felt at the mention of Steve’s years in exile melting away.  “I don’t know, baby,” he said quietly.
Even with the sub-freezing temperatures, and the water, and the sealed hatch, Tony wasn’t sure if he’d give in.  He stood silently looking out at the ocean, lip quivering with the cold, hands shaking, his whole body shaking.  He was probably calculating how long he could stand out here.  How long he could wait for someone, anyone, to come pick him up.  Would they make it before nightfall?  It came fast out here in the middle of the big blue.  How long could he stand it with just that jacket?  How long before he’d have to go bang on the hatch and ask to come back inside--
A silence fell between them, comfortable and warm, broken only by the lapping of the lake on the beach, and the cat’s rusty purr.  Tony put his hand on the back of Steve’s neck and brushed through his hair.  Steve sighed in contentment.
Steve’s hand tightened on the phone, squeezing it tightly in his fist. Tears started to leak from the corners of his closed eyes.
Tony pulled  him to his chest and held him.  Steve hid his face in the crook of his neck and clung to Tony’s waist.  Tony remembered Rhodey once telling him he couldn’t be Steve’s life preserver.
. They were all a part of something. They all recognized some part of themselves in each other, and sometimes they were the only people Steve was interested in being around. In a lot of ways, they were as much his family as Natasha and Bucky. It hurt him to feel like that, but he did.
Bruce smiled, his already handsome face becoming even more so.  Tony was thrilled to think he could make that happen.  “Fancy.  I like it.”
the ‘them’ that was Steve and Tony, Tony and Steve, anyway--but dictated every second of their lives.
Tony held out the napkin. “Here,” he said. “I expect you to use this.” Steve reached for it, and when he did, their fingers brushed together. Steve felt a jolt of electricity and drew in a breath as Tony hooked his index finger around Steve’s. “I mean it,” Tony said in a softer tone. “I know you don’t like promises. But I need this one.”
Steve started to walk away, but Tony grabbed his arm.  “No.  No, it can wait ‘til morning.  Stay here, okay.  Just-just stay with me?”
When the sun started to go down, and the heat started to leach away, he’d grabbed the sweater he’d chucked on the back of a chair last week, and yanked it on, then went and sat by the pool and stuck his feet in. It was warm. Heated to a perfect eighty-one degrees. Warm enough to keep the muscles limber and loose, but cool enough to not fuck up the pH levels too much and encourage algae growth. Nobody wanted to encourage algae. That was gross.
Steve sighed, squeezed Tony’s hand. He kissed him one more time, quick and light. “See you in the morning,” he said, and left.
Tony started, jerked out of a little daydream of Steve lying in bed beside him, head on a pillow, smiling at him just the way he was smiling at him right now.
No, right now, all he wanted was to have friends, and sit in the dusty, hazy, lazy, chalk-smelling classrooms, and eat lunch in the cafeteria, and meet Steve to study after school.
they got. And he loved that part too. But this? This sitting around, unhurried, relaxing on a sofa in a darkened, quiet room, just talking? Talking and making plans, touching each other, teasing each other? No. They hadn’t gotten much of that. And when they had, there had still been a dark cloud hanging over it. A dark cloud that said they’d better enjoy it while it lasted, because, really, it
Steve considered. They were dancing closer now, Vis holding Wanda as though she were something special he needed to protect. “Let’s give them the night off.”
Steve was carrying a ruck-sack.  Something ancient, dull, made out of army-grade canvas.  It looked perfectly at home in his hands, as if he’d carried it forever and ever.  Maybe he had.  Maybe it had made the rounds of the globe with him when he’d been on the run.  He hoisted it over his shoulder.  “What are you doing here?”
One more question threaded through his mind.  Natasha had made it so he didn’t have to go to the gym tonight, didn’t have to beat his body into submission, but he was going to have to ask.  It was the price he had to pay for sleep.
She had stopped when Tony said her name, but she was dancing from foot to foot. “Daddy,” she whined looking up at him, but his eyes were on the guy coming toward them.
a smile. “I’ve never ignored you for a second in my whole life,” he said. “You were always on my mind. The only thing on my mind.”
Strange drank his coffee, and the waitress came and refilled both cups.  She didn’t say anything, and neither did they.  Tony loved people sometimes.
“No,” Tony countered, shaking his head. “There’s something else. I don’t know what it is, but there’s something.”
“I know,” Steve said, leaning forward to affix the tourniquet to the stump of Bucky’s upper arm. Bucky shrieked again as he pulled it tight, cutting off the flow of blood, then slumped on the ground, silent at last. Steve checked his pulse. It was thready but there. “ETA on the medevac?”
They rode up the elevator to the common floor.  Once there, they’d go their separate ways and the night would end.  Tomorrow, Pepper would be back in town, or Rhodey or Sam would come over.  There’d be a mission--or two, or ten--that needed to be fought.  Clint and Natasha would come back, Vision and Wanda would show up.  In short, life would go on just like it always had.  And that would be good, but this, this quiet evening with just the two of them had been good, too.
But it was beginning to crack now.  And if he didn't get some answers soon, he couldn't be held responsible for what happened.
“I guess,” he said, and fell into a moody silence while he read and reread the same paragraph four times before finally closing his book with a sigh.
Tony touched him gently, running his fingers over the pronounced ridges of his ribs, the concavity of his stomach, the jut of his hip-bones.  “My god, Steve,” he whispered, “what did you do to yourself?”
They stood toe-to-toe, Howard taller, his eyes darker, his anger a palpable thing between them. Tony, slighter, his own eyes bright, sharp. They were like two versions of the same man. A mirror slightly distorted by age and circumstance.
“I don’t know,” Tony said, and he hoped he sounded more convincing than he thought he did. Because he knew exactly what he would have said.
“Ross,” Tony said, trying to control his voice, trying to mitigate this before it could blow up even further.  “Thaddeus, please.”
Steve hesitated, then kissed him long and hard, trying to give him some reassurance that everything would be okay. “Have a good day, okay?”
Jack didn’t live far, he said. Just a couple of blocks. Steve didn’t even consider taking him back to his hotel room. He didn’t want anyone else there. He didn’t want anyone in his space. Especially someone he didn’t know. There wasn’t much privacy back in the desert. He’d gotten fiercely protective of what little he had. He wasn’t sure if the other guys felt that way, or if he was the anomaly, and he didn’t really care. All he knew was that he felt that way. Maybe if it had been Sam here with him, or his mother, or- But it wasn’t. It was Jack. Just some anonymous guy he’d picked up in some anonymous bar in some anonymous city. He’d never see him again after tonight. This wasn’t some kind of romantic encounter that would lead to breakfast, then lunch, then movie dates, and hand-holding, and sweet declarations of love spoken while lying in each other’s arms in a warm, early-morning bed.
, and he kicked himself internally for calling Steve his “friend” again.  Steve wasn’t his friend, not anymore, despite what he’d just said, and that finger through his belt loop said Steve knew it too.  They may not know what to call it, but “friend” just wouldn’t cut it anymore.  At least not here in this house where it was just the two of them alone together.
Sam rapped on the doorjamb, then left. Steve looked back at Tony. There was a flush of sorrow coloring his blue eyes, darkening them. “Sorry,” he said quietly. “Me and Sam made plans to go to the Senior Center today. I forgot.”
He stopped next to the dog, his eyes--crystalline blue, shocked, anxious, hopeful--meeting Tony’s dark browns.
Steve looked up at last. Looked up and met those gorgeous eyes that he had dreamed about for too many years. But maybe that was better. Maybe that was the way it was meant to be. Maybe someone like him was only meant to have someone like Tony in dreams. “I’ll always be yours, Tony,” he whispered in a voice husked with emotion.
“You saved his life,” she said flatly, and grasped his hand again.  “I was going to let him die, and you saved him.”
"Maybe we shouldn’t do anything," Tony said, and his fingers eased enough to run his hand through Steve’s hair again gently. Steve shuddered out a breath. "We could just go to sleep. Or snuggle for a while instead."
Steve sat up and kissed his neck, burying his face into him, kissing him, licking him, biting him while Tony set a slow, sensual rhythm. He couldn’t remember the last time he had felt this way. The last time he had just...just
“Well, then you understand,” Howard said. “You understand why I would have a problem with you being with my son.”
Sam nodded again, and Tony got the distinct impression Sam knew exactly what he was feeling.  His dark eyes were kind, but there was also a touch of amusement in them.  Tony hated him a little, but felt his stomach flutter, too.
,” he said, waving a hand toward the plate of iceberg, tomatoes, and cucumbers in front of his friend. “The salad you make is a wet-dream come to life. This is…” He picked out a soggy crouton and ate it. “Yeah. Right the first time. Sad.”
Bruce cleared his throat and took his glasses off to clean them with the tail of his shirt. He was like Steve another way, too--his cheeks turned a very intriguing shade of pink when he blushed. “I’ll be outside.”
Steve ducked his head automatically, the blush heating his cheeks like a brand. “Don’t tease me,” he breathed, knowing full well that Tony was doing anything but. He
“Did she ever get married again?” Tony asked. Just to lighten the mood. To try and lessen the heat that lay simmering between them. “Make it an even six?”
being selfish. Thad had been right when he'd said it last night. If Thad thought it, Tony probably did too. It was okay. Only a matter of time, really. Thad wasn’t the first person to point it out. Steve’s mother had, too. Right after his father died. Right before
“Umm,” Tony said, trying not to lose the train of his thoughts to the feeling of Steve’s fingers slipping through his again. “It’s past three, Steve. Three-twenty, remember?”
“Please don’t tell me you’re upset that we saved you,” Tony said.  “My ego will take a real hit if I thought you’d rather die than be with me.”
Tony smiled over at Wanda.  Her eyes had not left Ross, but when she felt Tony’s look, she glanced at him.  “Will you do me a favor, and go check on Sam?” he asked.  “I left him with the dogs, and I think he might be afraid of them.”
“No.  No, come here,” she said, and pulled him into her arms, hugging him fiercely.  “I didn’t mean--”
Steve leaned forward. His eyes were lidded as he pressed a soft kiss against Tony’s mouth, lingering longer than he usually did. Not that kisses, or hugs, or anything physical was exactly
Steve’s tongue stole out and licked his lips. “Well...” he began, then shook his head. “No. Really. It’s too late. I have work.”
Strange turned to leave, and Tony went to find Wanda.  He was already rehearsing his rendition of “Steve Versus the Revolving Door” in his head.
Steve looked away again, but that little smile from before appeared on his lips. It went away a second later, but it had been there. Tony saw it.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them again.  He lifted his hands up and looked at them.  He
Tony stifled a laugh. The whole thing seemed sweet, and more than a little silly to him, but he couldn’t help it. He didn’t really want to help it. He kind of loved that Steve was a bit dorky, and did things like shushing him so that he’d remember to be quiet while passing his nosy neighbor’s door. He loved a lot of things about Steve. He loved
Steve had barely gotten to the hospital, had not seen Tony, or even spoken to anyone about him yet.  He had no idea what she meant, but he knew with absolute certainty that she was right. Whatever it was, whatever had happened, Pepper was right to be angry--Steve
Tony stood up, groaning a little at his stiff knees.  Concrete and blow jobs did not go together after twenty-five, but he felt good.  He felt like he was whole again for the first time in a very long time.  Steve held his hands out, and Tony helped haul him up.  Steve immediately wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and buried his head in his neck.  Tony held him.
Tony looked down at the typed words.  They swam together into a blurry blotch, and he grunted.  He squeezed then shut, rubbed them, and tried again.
“You could have called me,” Tony suggested, and Steve bit his lip.  His fingers clenched on the pencil he was holding, and it snapped in half.  The sound was very loud.
Tony nodded, relieved.  He hadn’t wanted to put anyone else through what Wanda had put them through once upon a time.
Steve breathed his name as Tony nibbled on that sensitive place beneath his ear, and scratched his nails up and down Tony’s back with one hand, while the other slipped along his thigh.
he was looking forward to it. Before--before Tony and Morgan--when he’d thought about his future, all he’d seen was a long straight road he’d walk alone, but now that road seemed a lot more interesting. Something filled with twists and turns and valleys and peaks, and the best part was, he’d have someone beside him the whole way. He’d never be alone. Never again.
Steve was lying on his side in Tony’s bed, the covers pulled loosely up to his waist. His eyes were closed, and Tony just stood looking at him for a second, drinking him in, aching for how beautiful he was, how perfect, how right he looked lying there in that bed. The left side had always felt so empty before, no matter how many times Tony had tried to fill it with one random hook-up or another, but here now, with Steve lying so peacefully in that space, it didn’t feel empty anymore.
missed them.  “Challenge accepted,” he said, and when Nat leapt in the air, graceful and deadly as a cheetah, Tony put Bruce in front of him, using him as a human shield.
Tony looked at his watch again, and closed his book with a snap. He wasn’t coming. For some reason, he-
Tony smoothed his hand along Steve’s brow.  There had been bruising there after Thanos, but it had faded now.  “Any more headaches?” he asked.
Thinking back, Tony didn’t see how the three things could possibly have happened simultaneously, but in that moment, it certainly seemed that way:
Tony cleaned himself up a little, then started coffee.  When it was done, he poured a large mug, dumped in his customary three sugars, and went in search of his elusive Captain.  He didn’t call for him, he just wandered from room to room, searching.  He was in no rush.  He’d find him eventually.  Even with the addition, the cabin was only so big.
Steve shook his head. “I’m not ignoring you, Tony,” he said, and Tony hated to admit just how much he
Steve glanced around the room. There were several people here, but plenty of empty tables. Plenty of places for him to sit without coming in contact with Steve. In fact, why was he even here? Why did he even come over here? Steve frowned, and asked. “Why would you want to do that?”
Ross was alone in the house apart from his guards.  His wife was out of town visiting their daughter at school.  They had no other children, and Ross was apparently either extraordinarily discreet with his affairs, or the only faithful man in D.C.  Tony hoped it was the latter.  He’d met the man’s wife before, and she was a sweet, humble little thing with big dark eyes and a gentle smile.  She’d reminded him of his own mother, and hoped Ross treated her with more care than Howared had spared.  For her sake, not his.  He may have a nice woman by his side, but Ross was still a dick of epic proportions.
She shrugged. “I gave you my blessing to be happy. Whatever that looks like for you...I’m fine with.”
Tony watched as a corner of Steve’s mouth lifted just a fraction of an inch. Just enough to give him some hope that maybe he wouldn’t stay angry forever. He kind of wished he’d been the one to make it happen, but for now at least, he was just glad it had happened at all.
“I know you do,” Tony answered. Steve turned out the lights, leaving them in darkness lit only by the fire in the hearth and the city lights coming in through the window, then took Tony’s hand. “Who would have thought big, strong Captain America was such a snuggle-fiend?”
Steve wheeled himself to the chair where Tony sat.  The concern had taken over.  Three vertical lines appeared between his brows as he frowned.  He reached up and cupped Tony’s cheek.  “You sure you’re okay?  You’re acting weird all of a sudden.”
Tony remembered his parents’ stiff, cordial conversations.  Usually they ended with his mother leaving the table to cry herself to sleep and Howard making another drink.  Until he’d met Pepper, he’d assumed all relationships were like that.  He hadn’t known there could be laughter and happiness and camaraderie with the person you shared your life with.
Steve snorted laughter.  “In the barn?  Wanda couldn’t sleep because she kept hearing mice everywhere.”
Tony found himself nodding before Sam had even finished speaking. The thought of something happening to Steve--of Steve getting hurt...or worse--was too much for him. He would have agreed to anything. “Okay,” he said. “I’ll try.”
Tony considered giving him the silent treatment--just for a few minutes, of course--then reconsidered. That was ridiculous. He didn’t want to do that. He
Tony laughed.  “Fuck yes, I could!  But try telling Ross that.  He starts blathering about budgets and profit and loss and blah, blah, blah.”  He shook his head.  “I tried telling him it would be more cost-effective in the long run to just do a new suit, but he doesn’t want to hear it, so here I am.”
Tony closed the front door gently and ran to the bedroom.  He scrounged a pair of jeans from the closet, then grabbed a t-shirt from the drawer.  Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Steve folded all Tony’s t-shirts so the design faced up.  Had he ever even noticed that until now?  God, he was amazing.  Tony found one shoe, but not the other.  He’d been a little frustrated the night before, and had no idea where he’d thrown the other one.
Tony shook his head. “I-” he began, then shook his head again, and went to the door. The handle was cool, perfect and welcome under his palm.
“What I always do--taking care of you.”  He shot him a look laced with concern and frustration.  “That’s what we do, isn’t it?  You and me?”
One or the other of them--or both; Steve prayed it was both--must have realized that, because they turned to each other almost simultaneously. “Did I hear you say you were taking physics?” Tony asked.
“Always with the wit,” he said, and it was as if Steve had spoken through him.  Tony closed his eyes and swallowed.  There seemed to be another lump in his throat.
“Tell Tony I tried to wait,” he muttered.  “I just...got so tired.  It got so dark.  Tell him I wanted to stay.  Tell him...I wanted him.  For so long.”
Sarah’s surgery was set for the next week, and they spent the time before then cramming everything they could into it. Both of them were utterly convinced that everything would be fine, that Sarah would beat this and be fine, but it was a near compulsion for them to spend every second of the week leading up to surgery doing everything Sarah loved, just in case. They went to the movies, and played cards, and went to Coney Island and rode The Cyclone three times. They bought hot dogs from a street vendor and wandered through Central Park. They went to all her favorite little art galleries, and Steve ignored the pang he felt in his heart as she exclaimed over the paintings and compared them to his own in a way only a mother could.
Tony found beds for all of them, blow-up mattresses, sleeping bags.  Peter had helped the Bartons build a giant pillow-fort and all of them, Peter, Clint, and Laura included, ended up sleeping inside it, a tangle of arms and legs and good-natured grousing about this one stealing the covers and that one’s cold feet.
“Captain Rogers had nothing to do with that,” Strange shot back.  “In fact, he’s the one who reported it.”
The bright banks of fluorescents lit his work bench, his tools, the two cars he’d bought to work on, and the old leather couch from his lab in the Tower.  He’d had the couch shipped up especially.  It had seen him through too many sleepless nights to just leave it to gather dust while he was on sabbatical.  Who knew, he might end up on it again tonight.
Tony's way was a little more extravagant, of course.  Usually, he'd call Steve and say, "How about lunch?" Sometimes that meant a burger in town, but sometimes it meant a jet to Paris for the afternoon, where they ate croissants and drank coffee, then switched to wine as the day got old.  They usually spent the night on these trips, and brought each other to a heaving, panting climax with the door to the balcony open and the sounds of the Parisian night floating in on the breeze.
Steve let out a breath, relaxing under Tony, sinking into the mattress.  “Yeah,” he said.  “That’s better.”
Strange watched him, his face blank, his eyes alight with apparent glee at being the cause of a Tony Stark meltdown.
They all sat at the conference room table, talking it out one last time.  After tonight, there would be no more talk.  The time for talk was over.
Steve smiled a dark, knowing smile, then turned around and fiddled with a pile of cassettes. Tony watched him, the flex of his muscles, the smooth curve of his back.
Tony kept his hold on Steve’s hand as he looked around. A few things had changed. There was a new chair in the corner by the window. A newer, larger television. But it felt the same. Like family and home. His eyes moved to the wall, and he drug Steve over to it. Sarah had hung a few new pictures. Steve and Sam in their caps and gowns at graduation. Steve and Sarah at the Grand Canyon, her arm around him, Steve smiling down at her instead of into the camera, oblivious of the natural surroundings. Just a kid looking at his mom.
The receptionist kept smiling. “We’re in luck,” she said, her eyes flicking curiously from Steve to Tony standing behind him, a cup of coffee in his hand, his sleeves rolled up, glasses perched on top of his head. “He
Steve ducked his head further, but he was smiling, his pale Irish skin, pink.  “I don’t know.  Maybe.”
“That makes me responsible for you,” Tony said.  “That’s what the Chinese say.  You save a life, you’re responsible for it.”
Steve was quiet for a minute, his arms tightening again, then his voice, dark and soft, “I still remember the way to the lake house,” he said. “It’s still not too late to run away.”
Steve came home late and tired. The restaurant had been busy all week. It was busy again tonight. He had been working a lot. He, Trish, and Bailey had been covering Carlos’s shifts while he healed. He’d also been painting more. The art school wanted samples of his work before admitting him for the next semester, and whenever he wasn’t at the bakery or the restaurant, he was at his easel, working on his paintings.
He sleepwalked  his way through the showers, dressed in his civvies, then left the Compound. Nat met him at the door and asked if he wanted a ride. Steve shook his head. Said he needed some air. Nat asked if he wanted company, but he said no.
They drove for an hour without speaking. Tony turned the radio on, and it played softly, song after song, interrupted by the DJ only a couple times to tell them the time in a voice that spoke of a late night out and limited coffee this morning. Sometimes Tony sang along with the music coming from the speakers. Not loudly, but well, and Steve put his head against the window, watching as the city fell behind them, comforted by the sound of his voice and the feeling of him sitting beside him, existing in the same little pocket of space, even if it was for only this short amount of time.
Steve was extra-happy since he knew that Bucky had had his doubts that Natasha would still want him after he lost his arm.
That last thought didn’t really feel like his own.  Once, the part of him that gave voice to that particular thought had been the one of criticism and self-hatred.  Steve had helped him get over that.  Steve had gently but insistently turned him away from all--
“It’s here,” Nat said, stopping by a metal door.  There was a small window set into it, wire embedded in the glass.  She looked in.
He rolled his eyes.  “Not interested.  It’s my fault it happened in the first place.  I should have stopped it.  I tried.  He was just too strong.”
Steve flipped them over, moving with a strength and grace that Tony admired even in this heated moment. Tony got his knees under him, and ran his hands over Steve’s bare chest, caressing his abdominals, unable to believe how hard they still were, how perfectly they stood out under his skin. “Fuck, baby,” he whispered. “Look at you. How- I mean,
Tony went into the house, saw the bed was empty, and looked out the window.  Steve was sitting on the back deck in his chair.  His head was bent, exposing that beautiful, long expanse of skin at the back of his neck.  Tony loved that part of him.  Loved every part of him.
“Nothing,” she said, but he could see tears pooling in her lashes again. He thought they were okay, though. He was pretty positive they were happy tears. “I just thought someday you might be leaving Dodger
Steve felt a soft, warm weight on his hand, then the clasp of Tony’s fingers on his. He didn’t look down, though. He was afraid if he did, Tony might move his hand, and he didn’t want him to move it. It felt too nice. He
--at the sound of Steve calling them for breakfast. That, almost more than anything. Just the sound of his voice, that meant he’d be down there. Steve. Steve Rogers. Standing in Tony’s kitchen like he belonged there, and Tony closed his eyes thinking about that, because good fucking
a wedding.  And since I was out-voted on the tuxes--dick move, by the way, Bruce--you can at least give me this.”
“Um,” he began, the sound of his voice, a surprise even to him, “yeah. Sure he will. He’ll change his mind. That’s what grown-ups do, right? They change their-”
“For anybody?” he asked. “Do they do that for anybody, or do they have to find you and recruit you like they’re doing to you?”
“Well, okay,” he said, as if relenting.  As if he would not have said yes to anything and everything this man in his arms wanted.  “But only if I get to pick the restaurant.”
, Tony was here, and he was here. Together. But not together, really. Because someone else was here too. Someone currently whispering in Tony’s ear and blatantly palming his crotch through his jeans.
Steve tore his eyes away from the portal and hugged her tight.  “Let Tony take care of you, okay?  Eat Thai food.  Play Xbox.  Listen to his stupid stories.  Okay?”
“Are you kidding,” Jeff laughed.  “I wouldn’t miss it.  Especially if Miss Romanov here will save me a dance.”
Steve blinked, and his eyes cleared. Lost that hungry edge, as they glanced at the doorway again. “Coming, Sam,” he said.
“I didn’t--” he wet his lips nervously, the pink of his tongue, rabbit-quick.  “I didn’t expect to see you.”
He sat in the kitchen, his hands in the dishwater, looking down at his lap.  They’d been talking about Wakanda, how peaceful it was there, how it was almost like here.  “Yeah, when I used to go there to…” Steve stopped, his face going pale, paler, palest.  “...visit…” He drew in a breath, dropped his eyes.  His shoulders tensed, his entire body beginning to shake.
Steve sunk into him, delving into his mouth with no hesitation, just a delicious lust that set Tony’s body on fire. It was the same, but not exactly. His body was broader, harder, his lips soft and warm with alcohol and smoke. He wrapped his arms around Tony and held him tight to his chest, crushing him almost to the point of making it difficult to breathe, but Tony didn’t care. He wanted it. He wanted to be crushed, to be taken so completely by someone he loved so entirely.
“Babe,” he said, and Steve’s hand fell away from Tony’s hip. The nerves in his fingers seemed to moan out a soft lament. Not fair, they cried silently. That’s not fair.
Tony’s hand moved out of his hair, trailing soft fingertips along the smooth cords of his neck until he could cup Steve’s cheek. He looked into his eyes. That gorgeous bourbon-brown that Steve had thought about, dreamed about, wrote badly-worded odes to in his heart for months, and when Tony kissed his lips, the static in his head began to clear. The tornado began to quiet.
It wasn’t a hearing, not really.  It was really just a meeting.  Steve had already agreed to go, this was just a way to make it official.  Although, that was actually a misnomer, because it wasn’t official, at all.  His was to be an off-the-books imprisonment.  One that only Ross, Fury, Strange, and two guards would know about.
Steve propped himself up on one elbow so he didn’t completely crush Tony, and kissed him, opening his mouth at Tony’s unspoken insistence, meeting his tongue, letting them move together in a way that had become so familiar and yet was still so thrilling. Tony’s hands moved up his sides, then back down again, slipping under his shirt to touch his bare skin, pulling him closer until Steve’s hips lay flush against him, feeling his growing hardness.
Rhodey went on.  “I’m not claiming to be an expert, but I swear to god, I’ve never seen anyone as in love as he is.”  He laughed and slapped Tony on the back.  “I don’t know how you stand it,” he said.
snarfing through the underbrush, Morgan on her hands and knees, Dodger right beside her. “Me and my shadow.”
“No,” he snapped, “I’m serious,” then let out a heavy, sudden sigh. His shoulders fell and he smiled a little. “Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to jump on you. I’m worried too.”
Tony tilted his head from side to side, considering.  “I kind of think the Fifth covers that question too.”
Tony shook his head, and while he had been able to keep himself from touching his hair, he grasped Steve’s wrist briefly, relishing the warmth of his skin against his palm before he let it go. “No, it’s okay. I’ll come with you. I can hear Bruce’s salad calling my name from here.”
For a long time, it felt like no one was even listening, and never would. That he would just stand on the precipice of that void forever until he could not cry out any longer. Until his voice grew weak. His body got tired. Sometimes, even though he was little more than a child, he could feel himself starting to stumble toward the edge that was there, and whatever lay beyond it...well, he just hoped it would be a quiet place.
They got to the party at six-fifteen, and Tony immediately looked for Steve. He didn’t see him yet, but it was okay. It was still early. He
Steve shrugged, but it was far from casual. It seemed more like a jumpy tic of the shoulders, a jerk up and down. “I don’t know. I guess we should.”
Thanks for reading! Next chapter will be up in a few days. We're almost done with the high school portion of this story. Couple more chapters, then we transition into some of the adulthood stuff.
Tony put his cheek on Natasha’s head.  God, it was good to have family.  Just to know someone had your back, that you weren’t alone.  They may be a bunch of misfit out-casts, but they made each other better.  They fit against each other, rough edge to rough edge, to make one smooth whole.  He needed them, and they needed him.  It was nice.  Being needed.  He’d never really known how nice it was, before he met them.
At eleven-fifteen, pleasantries out of the way, Tony stood in the Tower common room.  He had told Nat and Bruce what they were doing, and Nat been as indignant as Tony had been.  Bruce was more mellow, of course, surprised that they were trying this again, but cautiously optimistic.  Tony had known what their reactions would be, right down to Nat’s haughty hair-flip and Bruce’s steadying hand on her shoulder.  They didn’t disappoint, and love burst out of him toward them.  He’d wrapped them both in a bear-hug, making himself the filling of a Bruce/Natasha sandwich, and told them he’d call them tomorrow with the details.
.  But what Steve had just said was probably the heaviest, most important statement that had ever been uttered here.
Steve blushed Tony’s favorite pale pink and glanced away, hiding a grin behind his hand. “That’s not going to happen,” he said.
Tony nodded.  He knew Steve had been on edge for a week.  He spilled his cereal yesterday morning and swore colorfully and loudly for ten solid minutes.  Tony had to leave the table and hide in the bathroom after Steve got to “Fuck you, Captain fucking Crunch.  Christ, I hate you.”  He stood against the door, smothering his laughter in his fist.  He didn’t want Steve to think he was laughing at him.  He wasn’t.  Not really.  It was just the situation.
“That’s a little better,” she said, and Bruce smiled at him over the top of Nat’s head.  Tony felt ten feet tall after that.
Tony touched him. Touched his stomach, his chest. His lips following his hands, finding his way up to Steve’s mouth, and kissing him deeply. “Was that okay?” he asked, and Steve laughed softly.
She smiled, her red lips curving in a way that always made him a little weak.  “They’re honoring you,” she said.
Strange was shaking his head before the words were even past Tony’s lips.  “I’m not listening to this, Stark.  This is dangerous.  You want that girl to go prospecting around in Captain Rogers’ head like some kind of treasure hunt?  My god, Tony, he has just barely started to come back from the brink.  Did I not make myself clear last time we spoke?  He bit his own wrists open less than six weeks ago.  He lost thirty pounds trying to starve himself to death.”
I know this came fast, but my life kind of took a turn into shambles last night.  I am going to be fast-tracking the rest of these stories so I can get them out to those of you who have stuck with me through this.  Fair warning: the rest is a little rough around the edges.  I won't have time to polish it as much as I would like.  Sorry.  You're probably tired of hearing this, but THANK YOU to everyone reading this.  Sharing these stories, and your kind words and excitement about them has given me more in the last couple months than I deserve.  Thanks again.  I love you all!
He shifted on the bed. He was on his back now, Tony’s warmth right beside him, pressed up against him. He was thirsty. Tired. A little sore. He felt drained, but not empty. No. Never empty with Tony here with him, just...
He sat on the floor next to Morgan and picked up his own crayon. She sat beside him, pressed against his side. “Look, Grandpa Howard,” she said, and showed him the picture she had colored before.
He showed up in school one day, small, dark hair, dark eyes, teeth white and perfect inside his smile. When he
“Tell me what to write,” Steve said, closing his eyes in pleasure.  “You’re smart.  And you talk more than anybody I ever met.  And
Her eyes widened minutely. “Quite the potty-mouth tonight,” she mused. “I should try and get you drunk more often.”
She laughed, and again he wondered how he had ever been able to resist her.  She was amazing.  Immaculate.  He didn’t know what he would have done if her name had ever appeared on that Times Square list of the dead.
“Come on,” Steve said and patted the bed. He had turned down the covers and was smoothing the pillow. “Come hop up into bed. You and your dad can sleep in here.”
Steve smiled.  It was enigmatic, that smile, unlike any Tony had ever seen on his face.  “Was he?” he asked.
“Not like you.  It’s not because of a mission when you do it, Steve.  It’s not out of concern for the greater good.  It’s for
“I said I trust you,” he said, and let his head fall back onto Tony’s shoulder. Burrowed into the curve of his neck. “I want what you want, Tony. Just...will you...just touch me? Please? Touch me all over, okay?”
Tony reached out and grasped Steve’s arm. He slid his hand up his bicep, feeling it up beneath his jacket, feeling how hard it was, how big. “Yeah,” he mused, squeezing it experimentally. “You’re probably right. There’s nothing here worth writing home about.”
Clint finally looked at the screen.  His eyes jumped from place to place, catching many of the same phrases Nat had.  His face grew sober in the glow of the screen, his easy, cock-sure smile fading away to nothing.  “What the fuck?”
And he was.  It was the first time their friends would be here since Steve had come home.  Their first time seeing each other again.  Steve wandered around the house, arranging, then rearranging the table, the chairs, the books in the case, even.  He was making Tony anxious, but he didn’t say anything.  Steve was just excited.  And maybe a little nervous.  Tony was too.  Right down to the nerves.  But he didn’t show it.  One of them needed to stay calm.  Tony could do that.  For his best guy, Tony could do anything.
“You’re not supposed to pray for someone to get a boyfriend, Mom,” he laughed. “I’m pretty sure that’s not what Father Callahan has in mind when he’s standing at the pulpit.”
Strange stood impassively by.  If he felt left out, he didn’t show it, but after a few seconds, he did seem to get impatient.  He cleared his throat and said, “We really do need to do this if we are going to.  It’s getting late and I don’t know how long it will take.”
Nat had taken the guard’s key-ring, and now she used his key-card to open Steve’s door.  She beckoned them inside and then closed the door behind them.
Breath.  Hot, panting breath.  His name, a hundred times on his lips, a litany of consonants and vowels that added up to more than it ever had before.  Mixing in with the name of god.  Carrying a weight it never had before.  Blasphemy to some, perhaps.  Truth to him.  Truth and love and beauty, spilling out of him at the cusp of it all.  And then the sharp gasp of breath, the stop of the heart, the clench of muscles.  All time stops.
Tony took his keys out of his pocket and seated it in the lock.  Steve stood beside him.  Tony could feel his eyes on him, the weight of them hot and heavy.  He turned the key, and the door opened.  A rush of warm air eddied around them, beckoning them inside.
Tony could never resist that.  Ever.  He was a weak man and he knew it.  He leaned forward, hand still working them together, and kissed Steve’s neck, licking it, sucking on it, marking it with bruises that would fade in minutes.  But he’d know they’d been there.  So would Steve.  It was a secret between them.  Just like Steve only marked him under his clothes where no one else could see.  Just knowing they were there was enough.
“Okay.  You guys be careful.  Stay together and call for back-up if you need it.  The Brazilian government said all their armed forces are at your disposal.”
“I know you would.  You and me, Stark, we’ve got a lot more in common than I want to admit.”  He looked at the ground, then back at Tony.  “Thank you, though.  For saying that.”
He didn’t really talk at the cafe either. The others did, bullshitting about work and kids and life, and Steve listened, just soaking up the camaraderie. When they said good-bye afterward, he walked home slowly, still thinking.
“If I’d known that, I would have stayed in there,” Tony said, and Morgan giggled from her stool. He leaned over and kissed the top of her head, then patted Dodger as he stepped over him to get to Steve. He slipped his hand up Steve’s arm, touched his neck, touched his cheek, let one finger caress the skin under his eyes. “Still pale,” he said, frowning a little. “Do you ever sleep?”
looking. Tony huffed a little, and pulled Josh even closer. He stared at Steve. He couldn’t help it. He’d never been able to help it when it came to Steve.
. Even if he never got to have a family of his own, he still had her. He held her hand in one of his. The other was still in his pocket. Still holding his six-month chip. “I’m okay,” he said, and was glad to hear his voice really did sound okay now. “I know I can talk to you. And I will, if I need to. But I’m okay right now. I promise.”
“No, it’s not the point,” Steve agreed.  “The point is, I don’t want it.  I hate it.  I hate having it.”  He shuddered a little, and Tony rubbed his shoulder, giving him unconscious comfort.  “It feels like blood money.”
He woke up feeling groggy and still tired. He hadn’t slept much. His dreams had been plagued by a still very naked Steve, only this time he wasn’t taking a casual dip in the pool, but lying in Tony’s bed, eyes half-closed, lashes fluttering against his cheekbones, hands fisting in the silk sheets, moaning, the sound coming from someplace in the back of his throat. The same place his little laugh always came from. The laugh that put Tony on his metaphorical knees every single time he heard it. And speaking of being on his knees...that seemed to be exactly where dream-Tony was. On his knees, between Steve’s thighs, taking him deep in his throat, and if
“After we got back from Sokovia, I had FRIDAY set a protocol to alert me if you were in distress during the night,” he said.
He had actively avoided going through Steve’s things.  Because #1: They were Steve’s, and everyone deserves privacy.  #2: Steve was coming back and Tony wanted everything to be the way he’d left it.  And then there was #3.  #3 was left unsaid, unthought of, even to himself.  #3 was a secret reason.
Steve’s heart pounded a little harder, and he couldn’t quite wrap his head around it. Or around anything that was going on right now. It had all kind of come out of nowhere. “Am I?”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, rattling the door handle to humor Steve.  “We’ll have to do something about that when we go back.”
They sat down across from each other.  Tony’s hands itched to take Steve’s over the table-top, but he didn’t.  It was too risky.  “So?” he said.  “How is it?  How are you getting along?”
Howard waited for his reply, and when he got none, he went on. “What do you know about Stark Industries?”
He pulled the cat gently off Steve’s back and curled it against his chest, pet it and kissed the top of its head.
Tony wondered what he was dreaming about. But he didn’t think he would ever ask. He was afraid of the answer.
, but it wasn’t jumping-off-the-walls-shrieking-in-the-night either, so he counted that as a victory.
Tony closed his eyes, lay his forehead against Steve’s chest again.  He didn’t want to say it.  He had to say it.  “I don’t want to fuck this up,” he said, voicing his deepest fear aloud.
Steve sucked his bottom lip into his mouth and closed his teeth over it.  His gaze had not left the car, and Tony didn’t think he had any idea how he looked in the cold dark, his eyes hungry, his teeth sunk into his lip.  The street lamp had put a crystal halo around his head.  He looked like an angel.  An archangel from the Old Testament.  Strong, vicious, righteous, smiting sinners with a vanquishing sword.  And why not?  Had he not wielded a God-weapon before?  Was that not, in all actuality, exactly what he was?  Or, at least, had once been?
He ducked his head, trying to catch Steve’s downcast eyes.  When he did, it was heaven.  “Don’t go,” he said, shaking him a little.  “Stay.  Okay?  Stay with me.  You’re not the only one who wants to feel that again.”
Tony turned his hand in Steve’s until their fingers were locked together.  There were those damn eggshells again.
Tony knew what he probably looked like.  Mud, dirt on his clothing, hair a mess, blood covering his face from the mean, but shallow cut across his cheekbone.  Bruises in the shape of Steve’s large, well-loved hands, hands that had held him, stroked him, loved him so many times, beginning to show up on his throat.
Tony reached into Steve’s ear and pulled out his com-set.  He shoved it into his own ear. “Rhodey?  Rhodey, where the hell are you, man, I need you!”
They lay together for a while, Tony trailing gentle fingers up and down the indent of his spine and running his fingers through his hair. He didn’t think he had ever felt so warm, and that only intensified when Steve finally looked up at him, gazing at him through the dark fringe of his lashes.
“It’s okay,” Steve repeated.  He began to move his thumb gently over Tony’s hip.  Just soft, barely-there sweeps, but Tony felt it in his every nerve-ending.
Steve took hold of Tony’s t-shirt and tugged.  Tony bent down gladly.  “How do you just keep getting better?” Steve asked.
Steve took a deep breath. It was different, having the tie cutting his vision off. Closing his eyes was one thing, but this was...different. So often during the course of his life, he’d lost his autonomy. As a kid, his many illnesses had often made him dependent on someone else for his most basic needs. At times, he had been so weak he could not even feed himself--could barely
“Nobody cares, baby,” Tony said, then tugged him closer to whisper in his ear. “Come watch the movie, and I’ll run you a bath afterwards.”
“He has his moments,” Steve agreed, then opened the door. He stepped to the side so Tony could go first, waited while Dodger slipped past him, then went inside himself, closing and locking the door behind him.
Tony sighed out a laugh. “I’m going to tell you again not to worry, okay? He’s a lot of bark, but he’s no bite. I promise.”
“She was proud of you, Steve,” he said, and Steve lifted his head to look at him. “Yeah. She was. I mean, she missed you too. A lot. But she was so fucking proud of you. She still is.”
