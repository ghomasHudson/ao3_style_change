“You know,” Steve says, “back then, I thought we’d… that we would…” He sighs. “Nevermind.”
And then he actually met Steve, and he was so happy and excited, and Steve said, he said,
“Stop. I’m not hurt. You’re a strong guy, but I’m not made of butter. It’s just a bruise.”
Tony tugs Steve’s pants down just enough for his cock to spring free from his underwear. He’s so hard he can barely think, and when Tony swallows him down with that warm and perfect mouth of his, Steve blacks out with how sharp the pleasure is.
He’s more subdued. He smiles less, talks less. He never laughs. He gets distracted while he’s working, and he startles back to full awareness to notice that two hours have passed while he was staring into nothing.
“Oh, um…” Steve chuckles, sheepish. “You feel like… like a lightning bolt in my head. No, dozens of them. These bursts of energy. Warm. Pulsing.”
“Now you’re just insulting my intelligence,” Rhodey had replied, and Tony had to concede the point and let himself be hugged. He squeezed his eyes and pretended he wasn’t tearing up.
Steve looks at him and thinks that he must be an angel, illuminated by the pale light of the moon.
He doesn’t know where he is. He can’t see anything except the light of the reactor in his chest.
Tony kneels, and Steve walks up to him, towering over him with a smirk on his face. Tony looks unsure of what’s about to happen, which is very rare for him.
Tony talks about the Palio, a horse race held in the edges of the Piazza del Campo twice a year since the Middle Ages with very small changes over the course of the centuries. Each horse represents a contrada, a neighborhood of the city, and Tony says that there’s probably no greater sense of belonging than that of a senese to their contrada. Steve is fascinated by this, by humans doing the same thing over and over and over and loving it still, because it’s part of who they are, of their identity; it’s an intimate aspect of what it means to be born here.
He strips down to his boxers, kicks the rug away and sits down on the floor, the cold cotto tiles refreshing against the back of his thighs. He puts his mother’s necklace back in the drawer.
Like most things that pass through Tony’s sensitive nose, Steve’s scent becomes a color, and the color becomes a taste. Sweet, like cherries.
Tony emits a small sound of discomfort, and takes his hand away from underneath Steve’s, fast and twitching. He closes it into a loose fist and coughs into it, embarrassed.
,” he says.
“That’s just as well,” Steve pants against his lips, interspersing each word with a kiss. “God, Tony, I… I’ve never been this hard in my life,” he says, and then blushes since the sentence wasn’t meant to be said out loud. But Tony can feel it, Steve’s erection, he can feel it against his groin, the inside of his thigh.
They’re in the middle of nowhere. There’s the road, a few cars passing by. There’s the endless countryside, the Po valley all around them for miles and miles. The Alps are barely visible behind them; the heat in the air smudges their shape in the horizon.
“Hi,” Steve replies, stepping into the room. He looks around himself curiously, trying to spot what changed since the last time he was here.
“Really fits with your artistic personality.”
He finds Steve still sitting on the ground, texting someone on his phone.
“It’s been tough.”
“No, listen to me. I need sleep. I can’t sleep. You fucking me makes me less worried about work shit. You clearly want to keep going. This is a win-win situation. I trust you, Steve.”
“Steve. Use the toys. I’ll be back later.”
He owns everyone. He owns me.
His thrusts grow faster and harder and then there’s that split moment of stillness before Tony comes that Steve still remembers so clearly from their better days.
Tony raises his eyebrows.
Then, an abyss opens up in the middle of his chest, and he feels sucked into it. All the air disappears from the room, from his lungs. He wants to explain, tell Steve what happened on the mission with Fury, but his lips don’t move.
“Headache,” he replies to Steve’s worried look.
He almost wants Tony to put an end to this, one way or the other. Forgiveness would be the ideal outcome, but at this point he’d even take the rejection, if it meant stopping this agony.
“Yeah. We mended the bond, and then Sarah came into the room… She fell asleep so he just… stayed.”
“Okay, can I ask a couple of questions?”
“Hey, don’t… don’t cry,” he tries, and Tony takes a deep breath and falls silent, but the tears still roll down his face to wet his beard.
Armors. They come in all shapes and sizes.
“Yes. Very.”
Tony gets on his feet and lathers up his hands, then washes between his legs, front and back, while Steve averts his eyes.
“Nah, it’s actually not half as bad as my face makes it look. My guys are working on it, it’s just a legal hiccup, but I thought it was a done deal, so, you know.”
You can listen to a piano version of this song
“Did I tell you that I’ve found my biological mother?”
Steve touches his face and thrusts up into him. Tony realizes only then that he has stopped moving. God. He can’t even do the one thing he’s supposedly biologically programmed to do.
“Don’t hurt yourself,” he says, calmly.
“I feel like I’m the slowest runner in all the world,” Tony replies, thoughtful and honest. “But... I’m just gonna keep running.”
Maybe it’s just what he has to bear to atone for all the things he put Sarah and Steve through.
“You need to quit it with the almonds—”
Steve takes Tony’s hand and gets up. He keeps holding it the whole time they walk.
“Well. I’m Mr. Big Brain.”
He takes off his gloves, pulling at the strap of the first one with his teeth, Steve following his every move. He lets the gloves fall to the floor, scratches at his face with his fingers. His hands are still wrapped, and he should take care of that. Probably. Soon. He should. He should tell Steve he wants to stop. Enough training for the day. Night. Whatever.
“I’m here, Tony.”
After that, Tony doesn’t seem like he can do anything, he can’t even scream, he stops making noises altogether. Steve is almost worried for a minute, but Tony presses his hand to Steve cheek, leans in for a kiss, and Steve just keeps going, wordless, until he’s come three more times.
“Who could’ve done this? Get the drop on us like this?”
He fucks up into Steve’s mouth, bracing himself on the bed with his uninjured arm, and tugs at Steve’s hair with the other. He moans, eyes rolling to the back of his head, and Tony feels the vibration of Steve’s throat with the tip of his dick.
“You’re hurt.”
“St—”
He clears his throat, and it’s almost worse, it’s Steve confessing that whatever Tony’s doing right now is working like a charm. Which is true, yeah, but Steve wants to pretend not to be this easy to undo.
The night before Lagos was... hell, Tony doesn’t even have words to describe it, how it felt to have Steve inside himself, how warm his mouth was. But everything that’s happened since, it’s enough to sour the memory in his mind. He doesn’t regret it, and he’s thankful Steve doesn’t as well, but—
She knocks on the door. Tony recognizes the sound.
, as if someone like
He’s in the suit, but FRIDAY is silent. The data feed isn’t providing any information. That worries him.
“The moment they shut the door of the ambulance, he stunned the paramedics and drove it himself.”
“I just—”
“Tony. You’re doing fine. She’s clean, healthy, cared for. She has a sharp gaze. You stimulate her?”
Tony whispers, “Steve,” and Steve smiles.
it’s— it’s the stuff of legends.
Tony’s execution hardly ever makes anything better.
God, he misses him already. It’s never been such an issue, staying apart, but in the past few months they’ve spent some time together almost every day. It feels weird that Rhodey isn’t here with him. That he’s not going to see him for a few weeks.
But before Steve can drive himself completely crazy about it, something else happens. It’s almost a month after their first (
“I love your hair,” Steve says, very quietly, as if he’s ready to pretend he didn’t say anything if Tony doesn’t hear him.
“I’m an asshole. That’s old news. I’m sorry. I’m not mocking you. I swear. It’s the bullshit that comes out of my mouth.”
Tony murmurs, “Yeah,” and Steve picks Tony’s hips up, rearranges Tony’s limbs so he’s on all fours, all without pulling out. And then, as promised, Steve’s thighs slap against the back of Tony’s again.
Tony panics. He tries to understand if he’s about to die or if there’s simply something wrong with his eyes, but he can’t.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry.”
Right?
“It was before the fight at the airport. So, after we—”
“We knew you were coming here—no one else knows, don’t worry—and he asked to see you. He asked if I could arrange this.”
“Go outside. On the blanket, I’ll, I’ll clean up and join you. Okay?”
I wanted to fight the guards, at first. Protect the others. I stopped.
No bite. Tony has been in this exact situation many times before today. Every time he’s had sex since his first time ever, way too many years ago. He’s one of those shameful Omegas, always used and thrown away, never claimed by anyone. It always sucked, but this one takes the fucking cake, he’s gotta say. But let’s be real, they went out on one date. One. Steve is fucking him after they went out on one—
“Huh?”
“It’s not... you don’t have to—”
“Call Happy.”
She’d tell him to never give up. To keep hoping.
Steve sits back. He’s looking straight ahead now, not at Tony anymore. Tony has a bent knee on the seat of the couch, and his body is turned towards Steve, but Steve’s isn’t as welcoming.
My beard is long again. Good; everyone’s got one here. Wouldn’t want to be out of style.
It feels like a prison, Steve’s body—he’s so tight. But the slide, once Tony starts moving, it’s so sweet. Steve is warm and soft, he feels like sunshine on Tony’s skin.
“I’m sorry, Sam.”
, Tony thinks.
He likes it, Tony like this. He liked him before too, no question about it, but this change is… interesting. Even though Steve will have to restrain himself around him. He’ll do it. He promised.
“Tony—”
“Are you hungry?”
Alpha’s orders (if only, if only), and he uses them to fill the heavy negative space at the center of his mind, that black hole of desperation and rejection that Steve, beautiful and tender with his pink cheeks and his broad chest, will never, ever, choose to fill up himself, leaving Tony condemned to the compound growth of his own lovesickness.
“And now you’re not angry anymore?” She turns to Steve before Tony can reply. “What did you fight about?”
“I ha— What?”
And Steve’s smile, then, Steve’s smile is so luminous and disarming that Tony would give away his entire fortune, on the spot, without a second thought, for the promise of being ever again on its receiving end.
She’s always been unhappy, except for her time with Stella and her time with Tony.
After breakfast, they drive to Siena, and they’re there in barely twenty minutes.
Rhodey laughs and hangs up.
Steve looks up at the sky that peeks from beyond the thick foliage of the oak, and sucks in a shuddering breath.
Steve shakes his head suddenly. He shouldn’t be staring at Tony like this, especially while he’s asleep. He tries to avert his eyes, thinks of getting up to take a book from the shelf or take his sketchbook from the bedroom, but all he can think about is Tony.
“Better?”
“You still haven’t slept?”
Being accepted like this, for everything you are, for all the things that make you,
When they visit the Duomo, Steve loses himself while staring at the floor, at the complex images created with white, dark green, brown marbles. The columns are made of marble too, stripes of dark and light, and it looks like an optical illusion. It’s so bold and unapologetically aggressive that Steve’s head spins. It’s exhilarating.
An hour. Steve turns on his heels and runs back to Tony.
Steve wipes the tears away from his cheeks, trying to get a hold on himself. He walks around the room, and seeing Tony’s things now grounds him and destroys him at the same time. Tony’s clothes, still in their closet. His toothbrush in the bathroom, next to Steve’s. His shampoo still sitting on the shower shelf. No one will ever finish it now, and Steve isn’t going to throw the bottle away any time soon.
Silence has fallen all around them, everything and everyone has disappeared into the distance.
Steve can see four people, connected from the same room.
“Promise me you won’t hurt me again. Not like that, not like—”
“Sorry, alright? Don’t… Pretend I didn’t say that. I’m very tired.”
“Wait. Here.” Tony shouldn’t raise his voice. “I’ll bring her down.”
He looks up at Steve. “Ciao, amico di Iron Man che non conosco!”
“Here,” Steve says, helping Tony out of the tub and into a towel that smells like lavender fabric softener and sunshine. He lowers his head to catch Tony’s gaze. He’s still naked. “What’s wrong?” he asks, quietly.
He holds his head in his hands and tries to ground himself, to tell himself he is trying to make it better, make amends, earn Tony’s forgiveness even though he’s not sure he deserves it.
He can take anything Steve’ll throw at him and he’ll be right as rain tomorrow morning.
“That’s… that’s fine,” Tony mumbles, feeling like he didn’t study his part for this scene, so he has no idea what to say.
Tony nods, and he lies down on the bed, wiping his hand on the clean sheets. He tucks his face against Steve’s chest while Steve’s arms go around his back.
“Remember,” Steve says, then shyness stops him. He hesitates, comes to sit on the couch next to Tony, tucking a leg under himself. He’s wearing a dark, thick cardigan that clashes with the rest of his wardrobe. He has a white t-shirt underneath, gray sweatpants. He looks good and cozy, but different.
That seems to infuse Tony with renewed energy. He gets up and buttons up his shirt, tucks it into his jeans. He puts his shoes on and goes to the bathroom. He washes his face, and then he just… stops.
“Nothing made you suspicious enough all this time, but my dick is what gives me away. Unbelievable.”
stuff like that.
This loneliness, Tony understands it.
Steve immerses his entire hand in the water, stretches out his fingers as much as the narrow limestone walls allow him. He looks at the water streaming past his hand, between his fingers, wetting the fine hair at his wrist.
“Hey,” Steve whispers, and Tony had no idea his voice could sound so kind.
“And what’s August 10th?”
He covers Tony’s abdomen with his free hand.
“And you… Ultron.”
Tony does. But it shifts away from him from time to time, doubt kicks him in the face and forces him to reconsider all the variables, go over all the fluctuating pieces of data again and again until he’s nauseated by it. How much of it is a well-pondered decision, how much of it is his own unrestrained, carnal desire for Steve’s skin on his, Steve’s lips, Steve’s raw attraction for him. How much of it is the ineluctability of being so desperately, masochistically in love.
“Boss—”
The fear.
“You think it’s too late for a career change?”
“Just... just a bruise.”
Later, while Steve is browsing the souvenir shop, Tony’s phone buzzes.
“I wouldn’t hold my breath if I were you. He’s still pissed.”
“Come on,” he says leaning forward and wetting his lips, and he doesn’t need to explain. Tony parts his lips and a drop of Steve’s come trickles down his chin. Tony lets Steve plunge into his mouth, lick and suck away his own come, and more of it spills down but it doesn’t matter now. It doesn’t matter.
“What did you name her?” Steve asks, without looking at Tony. His shoulders have sagged a bit, in something that Tony classifies as defeat. He looks heartbroken, and that’s when Tony notices it.
“Come sit with me? For a minute.”
you were gonna say that. You got a razor or something?”
He’s silent for a while, busy.
“Ahh… oh—” Tony murmurs while Steve massages the muscle with his fingers, feels how slightly swollen it still is, still red in places despite being mostly already blue. Tony doesn’t shy away from his touch, not even when he has to clench his teeth to bear it; he powers through it because maybe there’s some pleasure to be found in this pain, and he’s not willing to give it up, how little it may be.
“None. Please don’t stop. Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
He pounds into Tony as fast as he can, pushes in as deep as he can go, kisses Tony’s tears away from his face, swallows all his moans, takes it all in.
He texts Rhodey, but doesn’t get an answer for half an hour or so. Anxiety starts creeping back into his mind. Is he okay, did everything go alright, is something wrong, did Tony miss anything? But his phone buzzes in his hand.
“In Wakanda. I’ll keep him safe. I owe him that.” T'Challa doesn’t look at Tony while he says this, but Tony understands. He figures Wakandans do, too.
He thinks about Steve’s tears, his voice, his hands on him, his lips on his cheek. Remembers the taste of his sweat. The way he cracks and cracks and tries to keep all the pieces of himself together, alone.
“Maybe. But I didn’t help Bucky so Nat would forgive me. I can’t pretend the thought never crossed my mind, though.”
About half an hour later, Tony asks him to make a U-turn.
There’s a moment where no one speaks. Tony just breathes, relief settling into him.
Then another, another, another...
Tony screams. Steve swallows it all in a kiss and comes, hard, deep inside Tony, all his love and care and affection gather in his lower belly and transform into a shock of energy that runs through him head to toe, makes his muscles spasm and shake uncontrollably, his vision goes white and he distantly feels Tony’s short nails scratch at his back, his other hand still tight around Steve’s wrist.
“Wanna feel you clench around my knot,” Steve says, surprising even himself. He doesn’t think of himself as a dirty talk kind of Alpha, but Tony brings so many new things out of him. It’s amazing.
“I’m gonna—”
“The worst part were those seconds between the moment he hit the ground and when I ripped his faceplate away. The worst part was seeing him unconscious. Thinking he was... That was the worst part.”
It gives me the illusion that I can cheat pain. But I can’t.
“I need to stop thinking about this whole shitshow. I need to relax.”
Tony’s phone rings.
He stares at Steve, expectant, and lifts his hands as if to ask him what the hell is he waiting for.
He sits on the floor in a corner of the room, crosses his legs and lets his head hit the wall over and over, not enough to damage Tony’s property. He’s done enough of that already, to last a lifetime or more.
And then it was all over. So. Yeah.
Steve wakes up with alarms going off in his head.
Tony is here for something personal. The necklace is probably connected to that. This whole thing, Steve is quite sure, is about Maria. Because she was Italian, he knows that much. It was in the files.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing!”
“I hope. I’ll always hope. You and her are my whole world. I’ll never lose hope when it comes to you two.”
“I’m okay.”
“I just want you to use my name. So I don’t think about all the years we kept each other at arm’s length.”
There’s a moment of silence, a terrifying moment of silence, and then Tony nods and kisses his cheek.
undertone that’s been there since he came back from Wakanda ten years ago is gone.
Tony stirs but doesn’t wake.
Tony finishes setting up the table to hide the sting in his eyes.
“I’ve been busy. Priorities.”
Tony watches him fall, horror and something else, something that Tony has already seen there more than once, clouding Steve’s eyes before he can’t help but closing them.
But then Tony touched him, on his abdomen, and for an absurd, annihilating second he thought—
A beat.
“That was five hours ago.”
Steve lets him go.
“God, you taste like heaven.”
The man groans and comes. He tries to kiss Tony, he always does after he finishes, but Tony moves his head away and the man doesn’t try again. With all the things he’s taking, Tony wonders why he doesn’t just force him into the kiss.
Steve blinks. “Think so.”
“Tony, you— you feel so— you’re so warm and so full, and I— I just couldn’t— I can’t—”
“You— you didn’t, there’s— there’s nothing to apologize for, it’s just— I just—” he trails off, and Steve waits patiently for him to clear his thoughts, to put together a string of words that would make sense to Steve. “I’ve dreamed about this moment for so many years and I— I can’t— I’m so— It’s real. You’re real.”
Dozens of small, shallow, little rivulets of water have carved their way on the white rocky hill over the course of the centuries. None of them are deeper or wider than a few inches. The little river beds are orange with limestone and they coalesce into a small waterfall down the hill. The sound of the rushing water is soothing, and it gives the place an otherworldly atmosphere.
They set off on foot, following the trail that leads to the church. The meadow surrounding it is green and yellow; the soft breeze plays with the grass and makes it move in waves, like the sea. Steve wishes he could touch it, let it tickle the palm of his hand.
“Come on,” Steve says then, with only a hint of his serious Alpha voice, the one Sarah doesn’t disobey. “You’re gonna be late for school.”
“Alright,” he breathes out, like the deal is half-done already and he can move on to the next phase of it, but he doesn’t stop fucking into Tony. Tony feels overwhelmed, disoriented; Steve is a foreign body inside him now, too much, but he doesn’t want him to pull out, no, the opposite, he wants him to push in even more, more, more, be one with him, be—
I look at myself in a mirror for the first time in god knows how many months.
“You want me to tell you that I’ll forgive you?”
He taps at his watch. Forty-five seconds, and a new armor will be here for him. It’s too long, but it’s in a damn satellite, and there’s nothing he can do about that. It’s as good as it gets for having the suit at his beck and call no matter where he is. But what if someone took him prisoner and locked him somewhere the suit can’t reach? What if…?
He wraps her up in a blanket and steps into the elevator. He presses the button to the clinic. The pediatrician should still be there; the nursery for Stark Industries employees is still open. And he’s a Stark Industries employee. Technically.
“Less than I thought. For now.”
“How is he?”
“Tony!” Carol’s voice. Worried. “Holy shit, what happened?”
“Then she pooped and I changed her and we took a bath and played in the tub and—”
Tony thinks about that night at Clint’s farm, about Steve sleeping next to him, about how careful they were not to touch at all.
I've always been unhappy. And I don't want him to be. I want him to be loved in all the ways Howard never loved me. In all the ways you always did.
He shuts the water off and stands there for a while, until the droplets running down his skin make him ticklish and uncomfortable. He dries off quickly; it’s too hot to keep the towel on more than necessary, and he gets dressed, even though he’d prefer not to have to.
“Good morning,” he says, and Steve doesn’t reply except with a grunt and a caress through the bond.
He’s here.
The sky is still gray. The sun seems to struggle to come out from behind the clouds. Steve wouldn’t blame it if it didn’t want to rise at all, today.
Steve is naked, underwear discarded god knows where faster than light; he’s kneeling on his heels, knees spread apart, thighs even thicker than normal because of the position. His cock is hard and red, arched in a perfect curve, and it makes Tony’s mouth water for a taste. The muscles of his abs and chest are taut and sinuous, his shoulders sculpted, his throat exposed. He draws a circle with his neck, relaxes his head down, and a tuft of hair shift over his forehead with the movement, catching the sunlight invading the room.
“You don’t need to prove anything—”
Tony is asleep, but he’s frowning, sweating, his whole body trembles as he tries to speak but what comes out is only gibberish. Steve shifts on the bed to wake him up without scaring him, but before he can touch him Tony awakens on his own with a shout that sounds an awful lot like
“Then we came back. And he saw Sarah for the first time. It made him so happy, despite everything. So his body… elaborated the loss. He adjusted.”
He’d been distracted. He’d been in love.
Holy shit,
Steve looks down at him for a moment. “I’m still taller than you; that’s all that matters.”
They don’t ring the bell, the main door is wide open. Tony knocks on it, calls, “Stella! It’s Tony! Ciao!”
“I didn’t think that, Tony. It’s just... vibranium.”
Later, when they’re lying down on their side waiting for the knot to subside, Steve touches Tony’s abdomen and starts whispering in his ear.
And then
“You aren’t.”
He finds Tony on the couch, sleeping. He’s lying on his side, knees drawn to his belly, arms crossed over his chest, hands resting on his biceps. There’s a scowl on his face. The television is on; he must have fallen asleep while watching it. Maybe it’s the jet lag, maybe it’s the fact that Steve woke him up last night.
“Maybe not to you.”
“I spoke to her on the phone a few times. She seems… really nice.”
, and secondly if I remember correctly, which I do,
The smirk comes to his lips without him even knowing.
“So. Wanna stand in the longest line in the world to try the best ice cream in the world?”
He gets up, extends his hand towards Steve.
Steve forces him down onto his knees in front of Tony. There’s a glint in the man’s eyes that speaks of mild, bored amusement, as if he expected this, saw it happen from miles away.
Tony feels like an animal, not moving, not even breathing lest a predator senses his presence and attacks, but he can’t fuck this up. He’ll take what Steve gives. It’s already more than Tony could ever deserve. Even if he flew a hundred nukes into just as many wormholes in the sky, he’d never be worthy of Steve.
“Thanks.”
“And yet, lying to me—for years—it was easy, right? Easier than telling me the truth.”
They have breakfast together in the morning.
“Perfectly fine, sir. The route we traced is free of traffic, as you predicted. Avoiding the motorway is indeed a wise choice.”
. And he imagines Steve saying… he remembers Steve saying,
“Thank you.”
“Is it worth all this effort?”
Steve wants to cry, or scream, or throw himself off a tall building and see if that, at least, will hurt more than this.
“To—”
“Thank you,” Tony says, breathless.
Steve’s blood freezes in his veins.
A wilting bond constantly at the back of your mind, not quite dead but not really alive either—a wound that doesn’t bleed but never heals, like having a shard of glass constantly lodged in the skin between your ribs. You can’t pull it out.
“What? This is a nice suit, and you already ruined my shirt.”
Tony fucks Steve hard, and if he was a lesser man Steve might think the lack of finesse is a belated punishment for that unwelcome touch that still makes him feel guilty, but at this point he knows that’s just how Tony likes it. Steve likes it too.
He wakes up to Steve’s worried face looking at him.
Well, the show must go on and all that, apparently. But really, the word,
Yeah. I got that, buddy.
He looks back at Steve, who’s—of course, of course—already looking at him.
“What did you want to say?”
He dreams of no one but their closest friends knowing that Steve and Tony are buried together in the ice.
There’s a hand on his shoulder, small and thin.
“Jokes? Really?”
He sees a hand close around her neck.
Steve sets the table for everyone and places his napkin, with the blue ring, next to Tony’s golden one.
Tony has a huge grin on his face, he looks down at himself like he can’t believe it.
Tony stares at him the whole time, through every moan and groan and hiss and shudder. He lifts a hand to caress Steve’s cheek.
He sends an emergency call to Rhodey. He doubts he’ll make it there in time.
“Yes. Just…”
Tony is screaming and crying, he looks like he wants to say something, but just can’t; he only manages a strangled
“We could come—”
Steve bites his shoulder and fucks him harder, fucks him faster, fucks him up, and then Tony knows what that means and his mind just goes
“But… why are you giving it to me now?” Tony asks, still staring at the piece of mesh in the box.
“Hey, little one,” Steve says to it while he twists to press his hand against the trunk, waiting for the ladybug to crawl past his fingers and on the tree.
“Alright,” he says. Then, of course, “Thank you.”
There’s them having sex, yes, in ways they have and in ways they haven’t (
Steve reaches over with his pen and adds the date and his initials to the drawing. Then, a title:
Steve tries to push away so he can look at him, but he fails.
Tony opens the faucet to drink some water, then spits in his hand—his saliva is streaked with red—and starts stroking himself.
Steve would ask how he learned, but he knows the answer.
“I thought about it. Been thinking about it for a while, actually.”
“Mmh.”
Steve asked.
“Come quando babbo compra le cose su Amazon?”
Tony sighs, and lowers his voice to imitate Steve. “It’s still your room, Steve. No one’s touched it. Except for me.”
Tony kisses her forehead again.
Tony breathes as deep as he can, but his nose is pressed into Steve’s chest and everything is just...
about the idea of them having sex, to seek Steve out, to tease him and lead him to bed with his sultry voice and wicked promises, to do things to Steve and let Steve do things to him that would make the most experienced person
She’s been bullied at school, of course. She doesn’t want to say why, not even Steve can make her say why, but Tony knows. He knows why.
“We did,” Tony says, “but it’s a… work in progress.” He sounds unsure, and Steve feels the same. They’re trying to explain what changed last night, but it seems so confusing for Sarah. And what if they end up crashing and burning again; that would just hurt Sarah even more. They haven’t even talked about the future, or decided anything important, but their daughter is asking questions about it right now, and neither Steve nor Tony know how to answer.
“That day when you reached for the bond, I sent—”
He’s never believed in the afterlife, but now he thinks that he could give up and stop fighting if that means he’ll see his mother again.
“He’s hurt, Shar. I hurt him real bad.”
“No, it’s enough. Thank you.”
He wonders how Tony feels about the song, which seems to have been written for him. But that could be just Steve, so stupid with love that every song is about Tony to him.
Natasha sags down on one of the barstools. She takes the smoothie Tony passes her over the counter. “Thank you,” she says, before placing the straw between her lips.
He’s been telling himself that he hates Steve for so long that maybe he doesn’t even know who he is if he doesn’t. But he’s loved Steve for so long that the idea of ever stopping seems foolish, even by Tony’s standards.
, someone who has built an entire reputation on being a playboy. It’s not that he actually slept around as much as he wanted the tabloids to think he did, but he did have a lot of fun in his younger years. Sex always made him feel good; even when it was a way to fulfill a different kind of desire, it was still good. Giving and receiving pleasure was something Tony always enjoyed, both when it was casual, and during his few and brief relationships. And he was great at it, too; he was a considerate lover, generous, thoughtful, and he always made sure the other person (or, well, people) was having a good time. He was attractive and he knew it, always kept in excellent shape, had top-notch stamina, and he could go at it for quite some time.
“What—” Steve says, finally looking at him.
Tony leans in, kisses Steve at the corner of his mouth, Steve can barely feel it, it’s so delicate. Tony’s mustache tickles at Steve’s skin.
He doesn’t even get to finish. Steve lowers the upper part of his body on the bed, arms to his sides, a cheek pressed against the mattress, ass in the air. Tony feels himself slip even further into him with the new position.
He wakes up just before dawn, and his cheek sticks to the pillow with his dried tears.
“Nothing, it’s—”
“Already yours,” Tony had said, and he can’t think about this anymore. All of a sudden, it almost makes him sick.
Tentatively, as if scared Tony is going to push him away any minute now, Steve reaches around Tony’s body with his arm, strokes Tony’s spine with his thumb. Tony stiffens, but just for a moment.
Steve sighs, pushes his hair back with one hand, then lets his arm fall heavily to his side, defeated. “I don’t know, Tony.”
“What—”
“Shower. Then bed,” Tony says after a few minutes have passed, but for a long while they just stand there, hugging in silence, looking at Manhattan. The high-rises are dark and shining, an irregular chessboard of lit and unlit windows.
“Yeah, I... Maybe I’m feeling better.”
“Steve…”
Steve takes out a glove and rests his hand over Tony’s shoulder blades. It’s warm and it feels big on Tony’s shriveled-up frame, on his paper-thin skin. But Tony lets himself be touched. He’s not scared. The other man, after all, wasn’t Steve.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, in an unanticipated bout of sadness and self-loathing. Something baleful clenches inside his ribcage.
“I had no idea you... Steve.”
Is this how Steve feels?
“Cut’s almost healed. It was bleeding a minute ago.” The connection between these two facts doesn’t need to be voiced. They look at each other. Steve has never been so angry at himself for being who he is.
“I just didn’t think you’d be that comfortable with people touching you—”
“Nope. I wanna do something else.”
He doesn’t want to hear more. If this is his last night, their last night, their entire world’s last night—he’s not gonna waste it. He’s gonna swallow it all down—his bitterness, his sense of betrayal, the hurt—and just
“Steve,” Tony’s tone is earnest and eager, he strokes Steve’s arm, reassuring, “It’ll be good. You’ll make good use of me.”
Back in the elevator, Tony feels like a huge weight has been lifted from his chest.
Steve looks at him; his eyes wander from Tony’s face down to his chest, his stomach. “Alright,” he says. He picks up some clothes and shuts the bathroom door softly, but it feels like repressed anger, squashed hope, a need left unsatisfied.
Tony walks into a bar in Barcelona a couple of hours later. He’s barefoot, and still in his pajamas.
Maybe someday, yeah. It seems impossible now, but he knows that maybe one day he’ll be able to touch himself again and enjoy it, even. Being touched by someone else, though… Steve can’t even think about that. At all. It feels beyond wrong. The mere idea makes him want to throw up, so he avoids it. When those thoughts cross his mind Steve closes his eyes and touches his wedding ring and thinks about how beautiful Tony was the day they got married.
Tony’s crying too now, and Steve doesn’t understand why. Tony should never cry, he should always be happy and safe and loved.
Tony shivers again. Steve shifts his hands away, the air leaving his lungs all of a sudden.
“Tony… why don’t you take the—”
“I didn’t ask you to bring him back. I don’t want him.”
There’s something written in the corner of the page, and Tony, characteristically, knows what it says before he even reads it. It’s in Italian.
Tony leads Steve to the centre of the town, in front of a small ice cream shop with a ridiculous queue outside.
It’s quiet in the car; Tony’s sitting next to him comfortably, which is all Steve can hope for. Tony looks out of the window a lot, at the trees along the edge of the road, the wheat fields, the vineyards. He checks his phone from time to time, tells Steve where to go.
There’s a loud ringing in Tony’s ears, it swallows up all the noises of the city.
“Sure,” he says.
“We’ll leave later, in the afternoon.”
I loved you, and you didn’t.
The rushing of the water sounds like music for a moment.
Steve stops, catches Tony’s mouth in a sloppy kiss that tastes of tears.
“So, how do you want to—”
“Howard was my father, and he didn’t give a sh—”
kid,” Tony says. “Maria is our kid.”
“I have something. For you. From Mom. I don’t know why I didn’t tell you straight away, it’s… it’s her last letter. To you. I think it was meant to be mailed, but then with everything that happened… I’m sorry.”
“Tony, I’m back! Hope that’s okay!”
He thinks about the weird look Riri just gave him in the corridor, troubled and worried. He hopes this hasn’t rattled her too much. It’s always bad when someone mentions Tony to them, or when they have to mention him to anyone else. Many people loved Iron Man, many people were close to Tony, but no one like Steve and Riri.
Look where that got him.
And then it’ll be meaningless.
After, Tony spreads the blue blanket under the oak tree, and Steve draws while Tony works on his tablet. Hours fly like this, until Tony shifts on his flank, and his t-shirt rides up on his side, exposing his hip. The skin there is red and swollen.
. Steve’s words, while spoken in a soft undertone, sound rehearsed, prepared, carefully chosen. It’s the first time Steve mentions the man. “But you were dreaming about doing it again. You were talking... You often seem to dream about… And I want you to know that if you want to do it, if you really want to do it, I’d be by your side. Always.”
He can’t—
Even as they’re alone, washing their hands in the downstairs bathroom, Steve doesn’t ask him anything. He wants that smile to play on Tony’s face for as long as possible.
“Right.”
Steve braces himself on the bed, his hand right next Tony’s head. Tony grabs his wrist and squeezes, and Steve fucks into him faster, and harder, and as rough and careful as he can be at the same time.
He looks down at her, and his eyes widen. He touches his forehead, almost confused. He says, “Oh my god,” under his breath, then covers his mouth with his hand for a moment.
“I wanted to say... that you’re a good father. And I’m, I’m, I’m happy for you. Okay.”
“When do we have to leave?”
“There’s a spare tooth—”
every few hours.
“No, no... Steve. Listen to me. This isn’t on you anymore. You don’t have to fix him, not alone.”
before he realizes that Tony is shoving his pants down his thighs and scrambling at Steve’s waistband, urgent, trembling in a way that makes it look like he’s keeping the worst of it under control and this is what spills out because he just can’t hide it all.
It feels good to be back.
There’s a staircase in front of him; the rock has been carved into the shape of the steps.
“No, it’s just a bunch of things. I think not drinking is what really makes me sleepy, right now. But being too warm all the time doesn’t help. Some of it is the reactor’s fault—can’t run any marathons. But the rest is... the chest pains, the dizziness, the weakness, the sweat, the nausea, the palpitations—”
“Pass me the soap.”
“That I am. Come on, they’re still warm.”
Steve looks at him curiously, his eyes widen a bit when Tony gestures for him to sit, too.
He knows, and he’s going to tell Steve. He’s going to make his confession and hope he, too, will be forgiven for what he’s done. He’ll do it tomorrow, though, because he needs to stay alone with the thought for a while. Because it’s a beautiful thought, it’s what Tony wanted to be able to feel again all along, but couldn’t. Wouldn’t.
He rinses his mouth, washes his face, splashes some water in his hair. He lets it drip on his neck, on his shoulders, on his chest.
Steve leaves, and Tony doesn’t want him to leave, he promised he’d stay, he promised he wouldn’t leave Tony, where did he—
Sarah is never sick. Sarah has never been sick in her entire life, and when she’s hurt, she heals faster than she should. For his part, Tony doesn’t seem to have aged very much since having her, although he doesn’t heal any quicker than before. They never talked about it, but they’re all aware of it.
“Steve.”
Steve pulls the t-shirt over Tony’s head, and in a whirl of fabric he’s free from it, free to straighten up and lock his gaze back with Steve’s.
And again.
Tony is still for a few moments. Then he takes the drawing, touching only the paper.
Tony, but that’s Steve
“I swear I didn’t want to do this to you. I had no idea. I only wanted to shut down the suit, make you stop... I don’t know why I didn’t think—”
His mind wanders back and forth, he can’t keep it still.
Steve struggles to understand, because Tony can’t be saying what Steve thinks he’s saying.
Tony is so worried, but he tries to keep it under control because he can’t let any of it make it past to Steve’s side of the bond. The only things that he can perceive from there are already just fear and sorrow, and he can’t add his own to it. He wants to help Steve, not make it worse.
Maybe he shouldn’t.
“No. Science.”
, is the title.
“Sorry,” Steve whispers. Acknowledging his humiliation is still better than leaving what just happened unaddressed, but it takes all the courage he has left, and he still can’t do more than a murmur.
Steve tries to keep his eyes on the road.
A smile surges up to Steve’s face. A lot has happened since, but those three days are still a fond memory.
It goes on. And Tony— fuck, Tony is becoming stupid with it.
“You said it first.”
“Mh. Good, now. I think. Can I stay here?”
They set off down the hill, in the opposite direction Steve took that morning to reach the main road. The landscape is pretty much the same as Steve appreciated during his run. The sun makes Tony sweat, his skin shines with it.
affects Tony just as much. He has to go to her, he has to be with her right now.
Tony’s lips still taste like Steve’s orgasm.
should wait until the end. So that’s what awaits me, then.
He’s different, but he looks good. He’s lost a few pounds, maybe, but he seems healthy. His facial hair is unkempt, his hair longer and styled differently—curls falling over his forehead instead of neatly combed to the side like it used to be. There’s a lot of gray in his beard and at his temples, too. Steve didn’t know Tony dyed his hair. He seems to have stopped, anyway. He’s sure Tony did it on purpose.
One afternoon, Tony comes back from the workshop to find Steve asleep on the couch. Maria is next to him, also asleep, held in place by Steve’s arm around her. He’s still clutching the crochet whale, his nose in Maria’s hair.
Tony still doesn’t get a full erection, but they get to this point faster than they did at first, which is a very good sign in Steve’s book. After a while Tony would come, sometimes on his stomach, or in Steve’s mouth, or on Steve’s hand. Once, on Steve’s face—it was
Steve lowers his head and looks at the floor, at Tony’s bare feet, his elegant legs.
Steve walks over to him, stands behind him. God, he’s short.
Tony swallows. He doesn’t like to think this much about Howard or talk about him, especially with Steve, who remembers a very different man from the one Tony knew.
“Ugh, someone save me from you two bonding over the good ol’ days,” Tony says, carrying fruit in the bowl, his shirt wet here and there.
They don’t pick a day.
His cock is hard in Steve’s hand. Steve moves his fingers up and down Tony’s shaft, slow and lovely, and Tony winces and twitches to keep from screaming.
Back in their room, Tony becomes silent, immersed in his own thoughts. He sits on the bed, stares absently at his own hands, open in his lap with the palms up. He studies them as if he’s seeing them for the first time.
He forces himself to calm down in order to assess his own situation, but he’s not faring better than Tony. He has no cowl and no belt. No shield either, obviously. They took the top of the suit Tony made him last month, and he’s been left in his undershirt. His wrists are bound too, chained up on the wall in the same way Tony’s are, but the cuffs are different. It’s something large and bulky, covering his hands and part of his fingers, too. Reinforced with vibranium, and… something else.
“Well,” Steve says, blinking, “God can.”
“I thought I didn’t anymore.”
Steve is fucking into him faster now, harder; the slick easing the way in and out, the knot already starting to swell inside Tony even before Steve comes, and the slap of Steve’s thighs against Tony’s ass is obscene and pornographic and mind-bogglingly poetic.
“Steve. Why don’t you... Let’s lie down for a while, alright?
“Just above—”
“Mh-mh.”
“Did enough defacing on my own, I think.”
While the storm rages in the sky above the guest house, Tony sleeps, and Tony dreams.
Sometimes I wonder how Howard's genes could create someone like Tony. I imagine mine took over. There's so little of his father in him, except the artificial. Sometimes I observe him and he reminds me of you, Stella, and I wonder if I didn't pass him something of you. If in some way he's yours too. In his name there's something of yours, after all.
Steve looks at Bucky. He seems fine. Healthy, even. He’s wearing new clothes and he got a haircut. The left sleeve of his hoodie is empty. Natasha sends furtive glances his way, the corner of her lips tugging minutely upwards, as if she’s still laughing about something silly he just said. She reaches up to take a bit of lint out of his hair, and the touch makes Bucky turn towards her, smile a smile Steve has never seen on his face. He looks like all his demons have gone quiet. Like he found something he’d lost.
“I can’t give you either. I’m sorry,” Steve says, because of course Tony voiced his thoughts without realizing. He sucks in a breath, and his left hand trembles against Steve’s back. “There’s very little I can give you,” Steve adds, and Tony hugs him tighter, because that’s not true at all, but he can’t tell him.
They take a molar out and I faint for a minute. I come to with blood choking me.
Tony has tried, really, to push that night as far away as possible from himself, distance himself from it, put it in a tiny box and lock it inside a dusty and abandoned room deep in his mind, one of those places where he never looks.
That can’t be right. It’s too early.
“Did they ever call you?”
Steve remembers when he was tiny and sickly, and shaving left his skin red and angry if he didn’t soothe it with Vaseline. Sometimes, Ma would do it for him. She’d remove the excess with a towel, pat his cheek and kiss his forehead, and tell him he looked like a proper gentleman. She had the ability to not make it sound like a lie.
“Could’ve been any other element.”
“The others—”
idea what that would’ve done to—”
The man doesn’t smell like Steve. He doesn’t walk like Steve, doesn’t talk like Steve.
“It was about time I got some real pain in this arm. Now I’ll feel miserable with a reason,” he says. It makes Steve grimace, and he covers his mouth with his hand while his eyes fill with tears.
“Just give it some time. Sarah, too.”
“Have your lawyers call my lawyers,” Tony says, and then, serious, “How are you?”
“I understand why you’re scared of me. If you need me to stay away, I will.” Steve swallows all the misery and shame he feels thinking about what happened yesterday in the car.
Steve takes both their bags from the backseat and follows Tony to the little building separated from the rest of the Relais by a high fence covered in ivy. It used to be a barn where Tony’s great-grandfather kept the crops after the harvest and hung cold meats to let them age. Now, it’s where Tony stays when he comes here, so he can maintain his privacy. The perks of being the owner.
“I know that. In theory.”
He’s gonna show it to Tony later.
Tony nods. “You can think and say whatever you want. I just ask that we don’t turn it into a fight. I told you, I don’t handle conflict well since…” Tony presses his lips together. “We can talk about anything. Just, please—don’t get angry and don’t make me angry.”
His beard scratches Tony’s skin.
A week later, news breaks out that the fugitive Avengers have signed the amended Accords, and are allowed back on US soil.
Steve gets down on one knee in front of him, between Tony’s open thighs. He touches Tony’s hair, pushes it back from his forehead, and when Steve removes his hand Tony hunches down to press his brow to Steve’s.
Fuck, the way he tastes. Sweet and warm and light. Metallic. The way Steve imagines the stars would taste.
Steve reaches out to lace his fingers with Tony’s, who’s surprised by the gesture, almost startled.
“You didn’t know me before 2008.”
“I… I have no idea, Steve. Maybe. Do some research if you want. Dig in some archives. Write a paper on it.”
The knot lasts one hour and almost a half.
“I appreciate it, but I’m not a baby, dunno if you noticed. I don’t need to be protected. Especially if you’re gonna fuck other people over while you do it.”
“Really?” Tony asks, and how much hope can be put in a single word?
“No. It’s fine. Just tired, you know? Long hours staring at screens and everything.” Steve’s expression turns hurt at the obvious lie, and Tony can’t deal with it anymore. He needs to cut this short. He lifts a hand in the direction of the heavy bag. “Thank you for—”
Tony hisses—he feels so sensitive and exposed and like he’s wearing his own skin inside-out. He’s hot, sweaty, and there’s an uncomfortable sting behind his navel that Steve’s cock can just barely relieve.
“How’s the road today?”
. And then,
Tony is himself and Steve all at once; he knows that Steve is himself and Tony all at once too.
Tony can’t say no to that. “Okay, but if it doesn’t work, we stop. Deal?”
“Yes. And I went about it all wrong for many years. I’m still trying to make up for that, I guess.”
It’s more than unsatisfying; it seems to be doing him more bad than good, but he regains a small amount of clarity. He opens his eyes and sees his sketchbook and a pen on Tony’s bedside table. He stretches over to pick them up, opens the book with shaky hands, but he can’t draw anything. He tries a few lines but he can’t even see what he’s doing; everything is trembling and imperfect.
can stay. Did you forget? You took all the children after the divorce!”
He remembers how wet he was, how swollen Steve’s knot felt inside him; he remembers how hard Steve bit on his shoulder, over the mark already there. The smell of
? I’m not even the green one.”
Steve squeezes his eyes shut, his heart is hammering in his chest. He can’t breathe. He shakes his head.
Steve misses going for a run early in the morning, watching the sun rise from the park, moving through the streets. Some days he just wants to take a shower and cuddle in the evening. He has a libido that sometimes just won’t leave him in peace, and he is able to fuck Tony a minimum of six times in a row whenever he wants, but that doesn’t mean he has to do it every day.
I always stared too much, and my eyes always fell to his lips. Sam told me once. Rhodey too. And Bruce. And Nat. And Scott. And Rocket. And Thor.
— “You left me a bruise just like this one, maybe bigger. It ached for weeks.”
“Me neither. I’m sorry—”
And that’s the exact moment that Wade calls him, and of course he’s going to help Wade with his case and hopefully keep him from getting into the mess of the century.
Steve.
Steve huffs a small laugh through his nose, shakes his head, worry leaving his face as quickly as it clouded it; he doesn’t really need more explanation than that. Tony nods at him, a silent
Steve can’t hear the crackle of Thor’s lightning anymore.
“No clue. But damn, we got rusty.”
The day is hot and the countryside all for them. No one is going to bother them here, the whole world is just for them.
And just like that, Tony can’t stand Steve’s touch anymore.
“No.”
Steve drops to his knees, looks up at Tony with something that can only be described as adoration, and asks, “Can I suck you off? I need the practice, right?” and there’s no way in hell Tony could ever say no to a question like that. So he nods, instead, and Steve swallows him slowly, making sure that every inch of the way is appropriately wet.
He’s going to kill him. He didn’t do it in Siberia but he’s gonna kill him now.
“No, I know—”
Steve slides a hand up to cup the back of Tony’s head, leaves a kiss in his hair, near his temple.
He tries to remember the night before he left for Lagos. How quiet the compound was. How empty, except for the two of them.
“Why do you care?”
Silently, Steve appears next to Tony. “Yeah. Tell me what to do.”
“Kissing... kissing you. It was us, happy and kissing. The cherry tree is... is how much I—”
“There’s a red one with little puppies too. We could get matching ties for the next Avengers press conference. ‘Hey, United Nations, we’re reassembling the Avengers and our ties totally make us look like serious, trustworthy individuals who can protect the planet from evil aliens’, how’s that sound?”
“Gone. Yeah.”
“On vibranium?”
“You’re a genius,” Steve says, “you’ll think of something.”
“Not fine? It’s weird, I don’t know. I feel like it’s 1991 again. Like I’ve seen a ghost.”
“I need you. You’re a part of me. I need you. My mate.”
“An American cheeseburger.”
God, he’s gonna screw this up so much. He can’t possibly be a father. What the hell was he thinking?
“How’re you feeling? Steve?”
“Yeah,” Steve says, but he sounds doubtful, “maybe.”
“He was weird about it?”
“You sure?”
So he decides that it’s time to talk with Steve about it.
God, if only Tony hadn’t acted like a dumb, insolent, recusant Omega who doesn’t know how to behave on a first date. But he did, and now he can say goodbye to all his timid hopes of a bite on his shoulder, of a bond in his mind. Of a relationship, finally, at forty-
Steve starts kissing Tony’s neck, his shoulders, licks carefully behind his ear, buries his nose in Tony’s gray hair and inhales deeply, flooding all his senses with the love of his life. His hand moves slowly on Tony’s abdomen, the muscles there rounder than a few years ago, molded by time so that Steve’s hand can fit on them perfectly.
That seems to hit Steve harder than Tony meant to. He clenches his jaw. “How’re you feeling?” he asks, pushing Tony’s hair away from his forehead, then sliding his hand down, resting it on Tony’s cheek.
“Bye, Mr. Stark.”
Steve smells it; it’s so sudden and sour.
He swallows.
Tony doesn’t know how he expected Steve to react, but it’s not… this.
Suddenly, there’s a sequence of loud, scary noises.
Steve scoffs. “I wish I knew how to answer that. We were friends, I guess, but then we got to spend some time alone and... we made love once and I’m still not sure it wasn’t casual sex for him.”
sessions. At least.
As if that could make Tony forgive him.
Tony sits back down on his chair. “It’s not that I don’t believe you. It’s just not... what I need.”
“Okay. I will.”
“Yes, that was pretty common. Makes sense, doesn’t it? Wanting to be safe, there’s no shame in that. For many people, that’s how it still works.”
Steve kisses him, sweet and sensual, pushes him down on the bed and strokes Tony back to a full erection. Tony’s about to slick himself up, roll over on top of Steve again, but then he thinks of something.
“I’m not sure I understand—”
“Tony. Please,” Steve’s voice is shaky, strangled. This is humiliating. Tony is
Someone who doesn’t love Steve.
“So wet for me,” Steve says, and it drives Tony crazy. It wrecks him. “My Omega. My perfect Omega. The other half of myself.”
“What, no interest in people building huge towers to prove how cool they are?”
While the level of water in the tub rises slowly, Steve walks up in front of Tony. He feels a smile play on his own face; he’s excited to do this, happy even, and yet it’s not sexual at all, no matter what it looks like. It’s going to feel good, the hot water, Tony between his arms, no need to talk about anything. Just the two of them, as close as they can be while they still… while Tony still hasn’t…
The closest thing Steve can think of is the Lincoln Memorial Pool in D.C. but this is… completely different in so many ways.
“They call Roberto for robotics and engineering. Remember, he’s—”
“You don’t need to apologize. I do.”
So that’s when Steve explains it to him, the whole thing with the articles and the— the dick gym or whatever. And it’s honestly kind of touching? Steve doing this thing for him, worrying about his health, putting up with him and his decrepit body and trying to keep him in shape, as much as possible, trying to make Tony’s dick behave like it did ten years ago so they can fuck like normal people and Steve can get
“It’s the serum. I think. I haven’t asked anyone because it’s not exactly… something I like to discuss.”
“No. It’s not my heart,” Tony says with a tone of finality, and Steve decides not to press the matter further when Tony speaks again. “It’s psychological. PTSD-related.”
“I was thinking about my mother.”
“Tony is alive,” Riri says, her eyes now full of tears, and she can’t look at Steve anymore.
“I don’t know. Can I shave you?” Steve asks, and the non sequitur makes Tony blink.
Slowly, Steve releases Tony’s shoulder. He doesn’t say anything. He breathes out, once, steadying himself for god knows what. Maybe he’s changed his mind. Maybe he’ll drag Tony to a doctor tomorrow morning to undo all this. A mistake. Poor judgment. Got carried away, you know how it is. Sure, I get it, just the heat of the moment.
They slump on the bed, pressed against each other, and Steve isn’t entirely sure, but he thinks that when he falls asleep he’s still inside Tony.
“That’s a— uh.”
