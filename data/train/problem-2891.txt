“You have?” Cas asks. He feels like he’s spiraling out of control, lost in the feel of Dean all around him and the heat between them. He’s had dreams similar to this before, but never like this, where the ache of arousal is a tangible presence in his body.
Dean blinks, confused, and glances down as if seeing the wound for the first time. He laughs and shakes his head, focusing back in on Cas. “It’s nothing, you okay?”
“Uh... hi. I found breakfast.” Dean says, and if Cas isn’t mistaken he hears Dean’s voice wobble a little on the last word.
“Anything you want is fine,” Cas answers.
Cas stumbles up from the bed, laptop sliding off his lap and onto the comforter. He steps closer, gauging internally if he has enough grace to exorcise the ghost from Dean’s body and not hurt him. He doesn’t. “Get out of him.”
“That takes all the fun out of it. Sure, I’ll give myself a beer every now and again without getting up from the porch, but food is a process, it’s a way I show love I guess and I want to do it with my own hands,” Dean explains.
“Would that be good?”
With a shaking hand, he reaches out and grapples for Cas’ coat. The fabric slips between his fingers, but it gets Cas to turn to him, that stupid blossom still clenched tight in Cas’ hand.
Nothing, just trees and burned Leviathan blossoms, their leaves charred and the fruit missing, leaving a dark hole where the pink tongue-like flower once was. At the edge of the sigil, there’s a gap in the warding, rubbed off in the dirt. They took Cas somewhere. Panic flutters in his chest, a quick wingbeat.
Pulling back slightly, Dean
If anyone else had said that, Dean would’ve told them were crazy. But this is
“Holy shit,” Dean breathes. “That’s... Rain Song.”
, Dean’s not complaining.
to break free of Chuck’s control and finally
“I’m fine.” Cas dips his hand into the large pocket of his trench coat and pulls out his badge, flipping it open, upside down. “Yes, I have my badge.”
As soon as Verna’s soul vanishes, Cas grabs the ice bucket off the counter. He fills it with water, then pours it over the fire until it’s a pile of smoking embers. Smoke feels the room like relief in his body. The fire alarm in this place must be faulty, but in this case it’s quite fortunate. They’ll be long gone in the morning before they have to explain the charred mess of the floor.
Dean hums under his breath when he comes out of the bathroom, Zeppelin -- like he always does -- and it makes Cas smile, as he thinks about the Dean from the Djinn world who didn’t. Things feel right here. Good.
“What will you do now?” Cas asks.
“Oh he’s trying, but he’s not strong enough,” Verna says, pouting sarcastically.
“This okay?” Dean whispers, lips brushing against Cas’.
“That
“What?” Dean reaches instinctively for the gun he keeps in the glove compartment.
, Cas,” Dean explains. He pauses at the top of the stairs to the deck. It wraps around the back and front of the house, built out of dark cedar wood, fashioned by Cas’ own hands. Dean has yet to set up furniture on the outside, but he imagines two rocking chairs, adjacent to each other facing the lake, a small table placed between them. Somewhere to relax in the evenings and watch the sunset with Cas at his side. He looks at Cas now, who’s paused next to him, the hint of a smile playing on his lips.
Out on the interstate with the highway empty in front of them, Dean slides his hand over, finding Cas’, and interlocks their fingers. He feels his hand lift up, and then Cas presses a chaste kiss there. Looking over in surprise, Dean finds Cas smiling, brilliantly, the sun a backdrop nearly as radiant. Dean knows at that moment, without a shadow of a doubt, that they will beat Chuck, save this world they call home, and maybe end up getting a little slice of the kind of life Cas dreamed about after all.
Maybe, if they end up getting out of this alive, Dean can have this. Maybe this time, Cas will stay.
“You need help or are you okay?”
“Yes.” Cas won’t dare look at him, not now. He focuses on the quick thump of his own heart in his chest, slowly feeling like he’s falling over the precipice. There’s a gap of silence, louder with the gravity of what’s being said between them.
Dean glances down at the sticky mess between their bodies and groans in disgust. His muscles tighten and he starts to pull away to get up. Cas grips him tighter, keeping him there.
“Been thinking ‘bout you all day,” Dean murmurs. He leans in and licks at Cas’ neck, sucking a mark there Cas knows will be visible tomorrow.
“You got your badge?” Dean asks.
Cas isn’t quite sure what possesses him to move from his spot on the bed and cross the room to where Dean is, hovering a few feet away, eying Dean’s scar.
so Cas backs towards the bathroom, tugging Dean along with him as they kiss.
He expected more pushback, not... this. Perhaps Dean is simply tired and doesn’t care. It’s not like they’ll be doing anything other than sleeping, even though Cas wouldn’t mind. He shakes his head to get those thoughts out of his head and follows Dean inside. The last thing he needs is a recurrence of the awkward encounter that happened this morning. His grace is returning, but that doesn’t mean he wants to use it to stifle a boner.

It must, because Paul throws up his hands and says, “Sure, be my guest.”
Loving Dean is an ache he’s learning to live with. It never gets easier, quelling the yearning ingrained within his grace in the shape of Dean’s name. But it’s worth it, to have a place by his side and have Dean’s friendship, for all eternity.
Instead, Dean takes the back roads, curving in zigzag patterns along the Nebraska border down to Kansas. Beside him Cas sits in the passenger seat, stoic and silent. Sam drove back with Eileen, said they needed to talk about what went down back there, what Chuck
“You should leave me alone,” the djinn snarls, breathing heavily as it walks back towards the stairs. “You should leave your friend alone. He’s happy where I put him. He’ll never wake up.”
It’s a fact, irrefutable even to his self-loathing mind, but one that if you’d asked him months ago he wouldn’t have been so sure. Times have changed, and the real Dean has changed too. Broken down, and made himself vulnerable to Cas. Cas should still be mad about what Dean had said to him, but he’s never one for holding grudges, at least not against Dean.
Dean chuckles and breathes out a shaky breath. “I got you.” With an easy motion, Dean moves his hands and lifts Cas up, practically cradling him against his chest.  For a moment, Cas can’t find it in himself to breathe.
They’re near the landing now; all it would take is one slight push to fling the djinn down the stairs. If Dean plans it right, he might get out relatively unscathed.
Dean steals a glance at Cas, tips his lips up into a smile and nods. “I’m glad you’re here.”
An exaggerated cough breaks through his thoughts, and he whirls around, t-shirt in hand, to see Dean standing near the door with a bag of food in one hand and two coffees in a drink carrier in the other.
“I stayed,” Cas says.
Cas turns towards him, walking closer and smiles. “I think it looks like everything you’ve ever wanted.”
Peace engulfs him and then, he’s gone.
Internally he knows it’s not Dean, just a figment of whatever sort of dream the Djinn flung him into, but this man before him
“Yes,” Cas answers, giving Dean a hint of a smile. His head still aches and may do so for a few days.
It’s sunny outside, the golden rays filtering in through the window, dancing on the freckles of his cheeks and making him look even more ethereal than normal. Cas just stares. He waits until Dean blushes, and then he kisses him, short and sweet right on his syrup-covered lips.
but it’s a start.
Dean glances down and away at the cutting board, a blush heating up his cheeks. He coughs and rubs his sleeve against his nose, fighting back a smile. “Thanks, Cas.”
“Still good?” Dean asks.
“Yes,” Dean answers, punctuating the word with a kiss to Cas’ cheek.
Cas shakes his head. “No, he’s managing now. Once he fully grasped how to control Chuck’s power and the good it could do for the world and Heaven, he no longer needs my assistance. I’m—” Cas pauses, looking too forlorn for Dean’s liking. “I’m not sure what I will do. I hadn’t expected Jack to retrieve me from the Empty, nor return my wings and restructure my grace.”
“Dean,” Cas says, when Dean pulls back, whispering a litany in the shape of Dean’s name.
Dean walks forward, until he’s side by side with Cas, and looks at the altar a dozen or so feet in front of them. Made out of the same dark oak as the rest of the interior of the church, it stands resolute. No sunlight graces the bronze cross at the center, it’s hidden back in the shadows. A chalice is nearby, shine dimmed from lingering dust and lack of use. Next to it sits a small bible with little tabs sticking out marking various passages.
Cas turns, resting his trenchcoat-clad arms onto the top of the Impala, a small smile just for Dean on his lips. “Ready?”
Once inside the church, Dean’s eyes are drawn skyward. Above them the ceiling is cracked, wooden beams bent, broken from erosion and the wind that sweeps over the plains. Sunlight streams through the gaps, illuminating the decrepit space in a golden glow. Dean stays near the entrance, watching as Cas walks down the aisle, gazing around at the dusty pews, and yellowing bibles neatly tucked into their slots. A ray of light hits the crown of his head, forming a halo over him. Breath catches in the back of Dean’s throat and a quiet pained noise escapes his throat.
Before going back to the motel, they stop at a barbecue joint to pick up food; Dean’s stomach is growling audibly. He gets a few racks of ribs for himself and Cas and a couple of sides of mac n cheese, cornbread, and coleslaw. It’s way too much food, but their room is decked out with a microwave and mini-fridge so there’s more than enough space for leftovers.
Cas sucks in a deep breath, darts his eyes down to his lap. He fidgets with his hands for a moment, gathering courage, and then begins. “I thought, at first, it wasn’t a dream. I thought Chuck was showing me some version of the future. It seemed logical he might try to trick me, convince me of a future where I could be happy.” He chuckles darkly, “How wrong I was.”
“Coffee.”

peace and freedom upon entering this forgotten chapel tucked away in the fields. For a moment, Dean allows himself to hope in ways he hadn’t dared to.
“Where were you?” Dean asks.
is going to die and when he does the world will cease to exist. He can feel the terror reverberating from Dean’s soul, not of dying, but the knowledge that if they die, that everyone he loves will die too. Even in his last moments, Dean thinks of others before himself. And right now, here at the end of all things, all Castiel can do is think of him.
“Yep,” Dean says, punctuating the end with a pop of his lips. He leans in to give Cas a chaste kiss, then pulls back, and grins.
A pause, then seconds of silence, broken by a guttural snarl and heavy running stomps as the djinn — Dean assumes — takes off running out of the house.
Dean hand feeds him a piece of bacon, thumb dragging over the edge of Cas’ bottom lip. Cas, in his astonishment, just starts chewing.
“You should do it. The Roadhouse is good for hunters, reminiscent of the life they led on Earth and the familiarity there, but I’m sure that many of Heaven’s residents are in need for more than just one bar.”
“May I?”
“She was supposed to meet you at the restaurant for dinner, for your anniversary, is that right?” Dean asks. He pulls out a notepad and pen from the pocket of his jacket.
“I figured I’d go into the garden for a while. Tend to the flowers, commune with the bees so to speak. Do you have plans?”
“I’m sorry.”
“It seems you may have read this book before,” Cas states.
, and he’s touching him so delicately, so worried that Cas aches for him even more.
Mary’s smile widens and she gestures with her arm towards the inside of the house. “Come in.”
“What do you need?” Cas asks. He may not have done this with a man before, but he’s willing to do whatever Dean wants him to.
On the second floor, the Djinn is groaning, holding its head between its bony hands, eyes closed and crinkled with pain. Dean twirls the knife between his fingers, just once, and follows the Djinn down the stairs.
“No, that’s alright. This is nice, I like driving with you,” Cas answers, he turns his gaze back to the waving corn as if his words didn’t just make Dean’s whole damn day.
“Why me?” Cas asks, trying to give himself some time. Mentally, he catalogs where Dean put his lighter. It’s usually in his pants pocket, but he always has a spare in his bag somewhere. Out of the corner of his eye, Cas sees the can of salt resting on the ledge beneath the window. If he could just grab the salt and find the lighter, he could end this.
Dean sighs, nodding in agreement and starts putting away the takeout containers to make room on the bed for his laptop. Just what he wanted. More research
“Cas, please.” Dean grabs at his forearm, fumbling for the knife.
“Yeah,” Dean groans, hands sliding up Cas’ chest to work at his tie. “I wanna see you.” He pushes off Cas’ coat with eager hands, undoing his tie with efficiency while they kiss, until Cas is only in his white shirt and slacks. They keep kissing, messy and wet, Dean grinding helplessly against him, getting more desperate by the increase of sounds coming from his throat.
“Cas,” Dean moans, his name like a prayer.
“Whatever you say,” Cas says.
Dean makes an impatient noise at the back of his throat. “Just...humor me.”
Cas wakes to the sun streaming in through the slats of the blinds shading the windows. He rolls away from the light, covering his face from the glow with his elbow, but freezes when he feels an arm around his waist. The grip tightens and someone sniffles from behind him, and a nose nuzzles against the back of his neck. His eyes fully pop open and he glances around the room. He’s not at the bunker or a motel; instead, he appears to be in a small bedroom in a house. He notices himself first -- shirtless -- a pink, tulip patterned comforter pulled up to his chest. There’s a closet across from the bed with various shirts hanging inside: a plethora of plaid, and a few solid henleys, many of which look familiar.
“Dizzy, but I think the poison is starting to wear off.”
“Oh,” Cas replies, suddenly very awake and aware of the hot rush of embarrassment rapidly spreading through his body. He moves his hands and Dean slips out of bed, padding into the other room. Cas’ cheeks feel hot, but he doesn’t dare open his eyes until he hears the bathroom door click shut.
Because Dean is courteous and a great best friend, he grabs one of those pre-heated convenience store burgers for Cas and a blue raspberry ICEE.
“That sounds like a good plan. He doesn’t want to come with?”
He takes a big sip of coffee, sighing happily as the semi-sweet taste floats over his tongue. That’s one thing this Dean got right, how Cas enjoys his coffee.
means, Cas continues. “I’m sorry it took me so long to come to you, I was admittedly a little worried about seeing you after... what happened. And then Jack needed guidance. He’s doing well, but he needed help figuring out how to work this new Heaven. He needed ideas of what would be best for you, for Sam, and for everyone else so I needed to help him.”
“If we find anything, I’ll let you know,” Dean says. He holds out his hand and Paul takes it, shaking it once, firmly.
He feels someone kiss the back of his neck, short and sweet, accompanied by a squeeze around his waist. “Morning,” says a gruff voice, scratchy from sleep, from behind him. He’d know that voice anywhere.
“Well,” Cas says, eyes darting down to the ground, and briefly petting Miracle. “I heard all of them.”
Dean feels too much and when he’s not sure what to do with all that emotion, it comes out in rash decisions and hurts the ones he loves. Starting now, that changes.
“Right,” Cas agrees. He seems to be finished eating and is now in the process of delicately licking barbecue sauce from the ribs off each of his fingers, slowly driving Dean insane. Apparently, Cas is unable to use wet wipes like a regular person, and instead chose the sexually frustrating way to get clean.
Yesterday, after breakfast, Cas led him out into the garden, their hands intertwined and told Dean to close his eyes. When he’d opened them again, they were standing on a beach, similar to that of the California ones Dean remembers driving past — tan sand stretching out in either direction as far as the eye can see, meeting bright blue waves.
Dean’s hands stroke up and down Cas’ back trying to bring their bodies closer, but there’s no space left between them. Kisses turn into open-mouthed panting, lips brushing, and foreheads pressed together. Slipping a hand between their bodies, Cas works his fist around their cocks and gives a few gentle strokes, gliding his thumb over the heads. From that simple touch, Dean comes, right onto Cas’ chest.
Dean offers him a sympathetic smile and takes his leave, not wanting to take up any more of this mourning man’s time.
Cas’ love engulfs him, warming him from the inside out as his grace and Dean’s soul join. Together, they are infinite.
Angling the knife upwards towards his chest, just out of sight, Cas pulls back to look at Dean, to take one last good look at this dream he wants so badly, and yet knows can never be.
“Not yet,” Cas answers instantly, a little harder than he intended. “I’m not sure I’ll ever be ready to.”
Sure, there are sounds of other humans, a few cars and distant chatter. But it’s missing something — the ambient noise of a life on the road that Dean found comfort in. There are no birds, or the rustling of leaves in the wind; hell, there’s no
look at him. So he asks what he knows, something easier.
“Could you show us the mirror she was standing in front of?” Dean asks.
“Come here,” Cas groans.
He waits to move until he can no longer hear the rustling of bushes and peeks his head around the corner. All clear. It will be back though, so Dean needs to find Cas now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean wakes to a crash somewhere in the bunker.
So that’s how they end up at the closest shopping mall during the christmas rush, fighting their way through screaming children and stressed parents. Dean looks excited at the prospect of selecting Christmas decorations. Sam tries to feel enthusiastic, but fails; he did the whole Christmas thing with Amelia the year prior, and mostly he remembers brightly colored lights coupled with far too much stress, a sort of technicolor blur smeared by her father’s begrudging acceptance.
The footsteps continue, echoing dully. Dean focuses on his breathing, on the environment around him. It’s LA, goddamnit, he’s worked the beat here for five years and he understands the streets like a normal citizen wouldn’t.
“That’d be great.”
“Er, yeah,” he says. The fuzziness in his head is finally easing, the throbbing is getting worse, and he keeps getting the urge to reach out and pull Cas’s body against his own. Other than that, he’s okay.
“I like it,” Dean says, fingers moving to graze Cas’s lips. They ghost across, electric. He sucks one into his mouth and lets the wet heat enclose the pad, humming around the length and caressing it gently with his tongue. Exhaled air rushes over Dean’s skin and he moans. Every other sense becomes overloaded without sight, a rush of sound and taste and touch and smell. It’s heady and rich, the rustle of Cas’s breaths, the dull beat of his pulse under skin, the feel of his bones. It makes Dean feel alive, perceptive in a way he hasn’t been before.
There’s an unusual tension between the two of them. Cas takes the washcloth and begins dabbing gently at the cut on Dean’s head, his left hand curling around the bolt of Dean’s jaw to keep Dean’s head steady. It’s strangely intimate. Dean watches Cas concentrate on his injuries; the way his tongue darts out occasionally to wet his lips, the easy rise and fall of his chest, the lines between his brows as he focuses. He smells like wet earth and cinnamon and something sweet, like warmed milk.

“Hey, if this information is so true, where’d you get it from?”
Now he’s hoping he’ll pull himself free and reach the dappled sunlight that is the fleeting promise of joy, hoping he’ll be able to take a gulping lungful of air without the threat of depression lingering over his head, hoping to sever all ties to past demons and start anew. If he makes it out of Purgatory alive with Benny and Cas, Dean has made a promise to himself that he’ll keep fighting, keep trying to work until he actually accepts (or maybe even likes) himself.
“Okay, Cas,” he begins, “I’m gonna set up a can a good few yards away, and you’ve got to aim for it.”
It’s totally a chick flick moment, and Dean is starting to feel uncomfortable.
Castiel is a manifestation of celestial intent; every action he takes is founded in goodness, in love. Dean is a selfish thirty-something alcoholic with commitment issues, a GED, and a give ‘em hell attitude. He’s about the farthest one can stray from angelic, and that’s saying something, because his brother was a demon-blood junkie addict whose body was destined to be Lucifer’s meatsuit.
Regardless of his feelings, Dean just wants Castiel back. To know that he’s okay; that he’s safe. He can’t stand this waiting game. “Goddamn it, Cas,” he slurs out loud as he stumbles over the crest of a hill.
“I have also commanded a garrison of hundreds of Angels, and I do not think that human students could be much different,” he tries to add helpfully. “I have a sword.”
It is. She’s been an informant for Central for a few years, has helped Dean on a few cases. Was even sweet on Sam before she realized that he was hitched. Dean’s not surprised, exactly, to see her here, but it makes him uncomfortable.
Castiel wakes tangled in his best friend.
“Me too,” Cas says, his weight shifting, and suddenly there’s warm pressure against Dean’s shoulder, but light, as if Cas isn’t really sure if touching Dean is something he should – or is allowed to - do.
“That’s sort of… corny.”
The killer's forcing him to chase clues.
“Because cooking is difficult,” Cas says. “I have to rub the butter in to the flour, but it doesn’t want to
I’m thirty-three and unattached, belonging nowhere and to no one. My body curls around his like a question mark, the long, languid line of us an incongruous query. Winter sunlight, washed out and weak, struggles through the grimy windowpane, Manhattan a dull blur as the city grinds through another day. He draws patterns across my chest with his fingertips. I huff small breaths into his hair as they curl like ink-stains across his forehead.  “You’re your own person, Dean,” he chuckles into the empty air, dust motes trailing in the wake of his exhale. “I doubt you’ll ever be anyone’s in any capacity because-“ but I silence his lips with mine as the dull sound of suction echoes around us and-
“Maybe you are,” Cas whispers. Dean feels a calmness wash over him, the world fading out to muted tones of de-saturated colour, until his eyelids are too heavy to keep open.
, but Deans knows it’s an idle threat so he continues to spread his papers across any flat surface in the near vicinity.
“This isn’t interesting,” he says. “Or fun. Quite frankly, I believe it is what you’d deem ‘boring’.”
Dean rolls his eyes.
“You have no idea how long I’ve…” Cas says against Dean’s lips, pausing before running his teeth lightly down Dean’s neck. Dean whimpers. “I’m crazy about you. You got under my skin, and…” He doesn’t finish. Instead he moves back and begins licking at the seam of Dean’s mouth, both hands moving to cup Dean’s face. Dean rests his own hands on Cas’s lower back, pushing against the fabric of Cas’s shirt until his own fingers are pressing in the dip above Cas’s ass.
As the little numbers on the alarm clock roll over to 12:10, Dean makes a decision. He rolls soundlessly off the bed and uses the screen of his cellphone as a light to guide him through the darkened room. Shrugging on a jacket, collecting his keys, and toeing on his shoes, he grabs the bottle of Jack from his bag, and slips quietly through the door. It clicks satisfyingly behind him.
There are about ten people in the room, Lucifer and Cas included, looking like they’re in the middle of a weird Mexican standoff. Dean wants to laugh because it looks like a scene from a b-grade Hollywood movie.
He chooses the latter and paints on a smile, because he’s not some immature character from goddamn Days of our Lives. This isn’t a soap opera. This is his life, no happy ending guaranteed, and his smile feels tight and saccharine, pushing melodramatic, but it works. Cas’s face relaxes in to something a little less concerned; Dean just feels sick.
"Cas?" he whispers tentatively, peering at Cas's face. Cas groans.
Title taken from the Imagine Dragons song of the same name.
More silence.
Which is, of course, for different reasons.
Dean looks over at Cas, studying the smooth planes of his face, the coffee-coloured beard that creeps over the line of his jaw, the fullness of his mouth. In that moment, he is reminded of startlingly of Jesus. “I’m sorry, Cas. I wasn’t there for you when you needed me most.” Dean laughs bitterly. “I can add that to the long list of things I shouldn’t forgive myself for.”
Too bad the little fuckers can swim.
“But it’s your – it’s Daphne’s killer! Don’t you want revenge?”
“And uh, Daphne?”
Dean drops four cans, about five yards between each, and runs back to Cas.
Cas insists on taking him to an expensive Indian restaurant. Dean insists that he’d be perfectly happy with a burger at the closest diner, but Cas insists that he’s going to do this properly. So there’s wine and silver service and shared curries and excellent conversation. And, hey, it might not be pie, but Dean is in love with the gulab jamun.
“Daphne and I never slept together,” Cas says steadily. “I loved her, but… not like that. She was my best friend. Neither of us was particularly interested in sex, hence the separate bedrooms, and we both needed a partner after the war.” He shrugs. “It was easy.”
Cas is so gorgeous in the half-light that it takes his breath away.
Cas looks confused, but he turns and gestures for a nurse to attend to the boy with the wounded leg before he walks towards what looks to be his office. Dean and Benny follow. This, by far, is the worst part of the job. Dean can take ten dead bodies and five gunfights in a day and walk away relatively unscathed, but telling people that their loved ones are dead – and that they might be a suspect in the case, adding further insult to injury – kills him a little bit every time.
“Thought I heard you say distinctly – and I quote – ‘No’,” Dean says, raising an eyebrow. Cas looks hunted. He briefly looks back over his shoulder at Lucifer again, almost as if it’s a subconscious action. Lucifer, who’s – whoa, okay, creepy as all get-out – just staring at them, grinning sardonically.
A tiny, irate huff comes from the foot of his bed. “Angels don’t dream, Dean.”
Castiel stands in the university office, dirty trench coat hanging limply off his too-thin frame, tax account getup tattered and warn as he leans into the personal space of the woman behind the desk.
“We’re not sure,” Dean says slowly, and thank god Benny’s kept his mouth shut so far, because Dean doesn’t trust what might come out of his partner’s mouth, especially considering the way Benny’s been eying Cas like he’s the next real-life Johnny Morrison. “That’s what we’re here to find out.”
He’s right. Above them, tied to the streetlight, is a bundle of mistletoe. Cas huffs out a breath of air and the both move at the same time. Dean then has an armful of warm Cas and a mouth pressed against his, curious tongue poking at the seam of his lips, and a hard-on the size of the Chrysler building. Cas tastes like spice and red wine and it’s surprisingly Christmassy. It’s… nice.
He’d had to convince him not to the wear the Santa hat, though. Half the time Dean’s not sure if Cas is actually socially clueless or just a little shit to spite him.
“I hate cars,” he continues, as if Dean hasn’t spoken. “I much prefer flying.”
And now Cas has reappeared in his life and fucked it all to hell in a goddamn hand basket.
Dean almost chokes on his cake in his attempt to hurriedly swallow the mouthful, but it sticks to his throat and the roof of his mouth he can barely breathe around the chocolate mess, let alone get words out. He tries to reach under the table to pinch Cas’s leg, or touch his hand, or anything to try and get him to stop, but of course he’s too late.
“-Who takes a gun to his wife’s head when she steps outta line. Yeah, I know the drill,” Dean mutters. “We can hope it’s a lead, though. Could be another letter from the Werewolf Killer, like we got a few months back.”
“No, never.” Cas pulls away slightly, irises almost all black except for a tiny ring of liquid blue. Dean sighs.
“Um,” Cas begins as soon as he reaches the couch. He doesn’t sit down. “You may be wondering why I didn’t give you a gift, as is customary in Western Christmas traditions.”
” But he’s alone in his room with nothing but his heartbeat in his ears and the miasma of silence.
He approaches Dean when Dean’s sitting off to the side on a couch in their living room, watching Garth and Sam argue over the best method to kill a harpy and Charlie and Kevin mutter over their third game of Magic. Dean’s feeling full and warm and content. But then Cas comes and - as he usually does - messes with Dean’s bubble of ‘zen’, flipping Dean’s perceptions upside down without realising it and (at least in this case) solving a never ending problem.
That age is best which is the first,
The rest is history.
Mr. Right-hook backs away steadily, but Dean can tell it’s a distraction tactic: the guy runs forward and trying to land a punch. Cas blocks him in one swift, fluid movement, grabbing his arm and twisting until Dean hears the sickening crack of bone splintering. The guy howls, pulling away quickly, and Cas uses the barrel of the gun to hit the back of the crim’s head. He crumples like a ragdoll.
"Not... exactly," Sam says, leading them both towards the dungeon.
Bela’s disposition changes quickly from serious back to flirty. She flashes her Great Whites, and Dean’s tempted to make a comment about how she’s not Marilyn fucking Monroe, she can stop with the stupid fake smiles because it’s pissing him off, but she starts talking again before he manages to phrase it properly. “I don’t kiss and tell, Dean; you should know that.” Examining her fingernails, she continues with: “All I’ll say is that little birdy told me. A trusted birdy. One that flies back to the nest often.”
I’m twenty and broken. He tastes like cigarette smoke and coffee, sweet and sour and slightly bitter. Smells like sweat and danger. I lose all trains of thought as his teeth bite violet and indigo flowers across my collarbone, hands dancing down my spine. He holds me like I’m delicate, like I could break at any moment, but he touches me with a body aching with desire. It’s rough and gritty and makes me feel alive, even as he lowers me to the filthy mattress and I hear the crackle of a condom packet. “I’ll brand you like you’re mine, boy,” he whispers against my ear, palming a fifty into my hand. I whimper like a fucking twelve year old and –
; Cas’ spine arcs over Dean as he groans. Dean bites at his mouth, almost drawing blood. Cas rakes his nails up Dean’s chest. Then there are large palms pressed against his waist, fingertips curling into his ribcage, and he’s moving his own fingers to Dean’s cock, grasping with both hands, maintaining the staccato rhythm with his hips, eyelids held together so tightly all he sees is white. Dean moans as Cas strokes, matching his thrusts. Hearing Dean come undone beneath him is almost enough to push Cas over the edge.
"What are you doing here?" Dean murmurs. Dean hasn't seen Cas since the crypt, since Naomi and I need you.
“’Sif that makes a difference. You’re gonna get sticky anyway.” Dean says. He runs his hands through the mess, hands slipping to trace the curve of Cas’s bony hips through the pale mush. “What even is it?”
After a tense couple of moments, conversation moves on to Jess – Sam’s wife – and their two-year-old son, as well as Charlie’s gossip. Dean only pays half attention, still too consumed by the day’s events. He orders another beer.
“Don’t open it, you idjit,” Bobby says as soon as Dean explains what the envelope is. Dean huffs in response, irritated.
Dean knew he shouldn't have let Cas watch The Little Mermaid the week before. "Get off it, Cas. What the fuck are we gonna do with a lobster? C'mon. Help me find the rest of the stuff on the list and we can go home. I'll buy you a hermit crab or something."
It doesn’t feel like a dream, though. It’s too linear, too detailed. It feels
“Whatever you say, boss,” Cas returns sardonically, voice betraying none of his sentiment. He rolls over until his face is pressed into Dean’s pectoral, the scent of him – whiskey and leather and gunpowder – overwhelming Cas in a way that the sex never could. Dean gently drapes an arm around Cas’ shoulder. Cas hums. They lie in silence for a few moments, Cas tucked against Dean’s side, his breaths small humid puffs across Dean’s nipple. When Dean clears his throat, however, Cas knows something big is coming. He’s known Dean way too intimately for far too long; can read his thoughts in the lines fanning from his eyes, his mood from the set of his jaw. Is fluent in the grain of his skin, and could draw where each freckle lies dusted over the bridge of Dean’s nose, if asked.  Some days, each breath Dean takes that isn’t for him feels like a sharpened blade pressed against his jugular. His love for the man is all-consuming.
Cas sighs irritably, still refusing to look at Dean. “We didn’t find any today,” he says steadily, casually, like he’s making a statement the weather, “and I don’t want to learn to drive the Impala; I’d be no good at it.” A beat; Cas folds his hands in to his lap. “It’s nothing like flying.”
She rolls her eyes in response.
“Sam, Charlie, this is Bela.”
They run through the same questions as they did yesterday. Benny confirms that Cas’s alibi puts him in San Francisco the night before the murder on a medical thing. Cas’ answers are short and to the point. His lawyer is an enthusiastic British man who cracks a few too many jokes, but who is evidently good at his job, regardless. They finish up in under an hour. Benny looks pretty damn annoyed by the end of it.
Dean moves off towards the living room, Cas following closely behind. He doesn’t bother to turn the light on, because the milky moonlight seeping in through the window is enough to cast Cas’s face in to sharp relief.
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” He tries to wink but is pretty sure his face just twitches unattractively. Sam buys it, though, and mutters something unintelligible before turning back towards the track.
Dean waits a beat before asking, “So where have you been?”
“Um, not exactly,” Dean says. “I know
Cas responds by pushing his foot down; the car jerks forward a few metres, too fast, and in the next moment the brake is slammed on. “Bit not good,” he mutters.
Dean can’t help himself; he chuckles quietly. He removes his hand from where it’s hovering in the air between the bed and the table and eases himself back under the sheets. “You’re dreaming, Cas.”
But now, in your fantasy, he’s sinking to his knees after giving your dick a couple of lazy strokes. He looks up at you, blue eyes wide, wet fringe curling around his forehead and dripping down his cheekbones, lips sucked puffy and pink. He grips your thighs with too-strong hands and sinks down on your dick.
There’s silence, after that. Dean knows he’s alone, now. He tries to move, but his wrists are bound. With a bit of effort he manages to shift in to a sitting position, legs out in front of him, arms aching with the strain of being tied. Slowly, his vision starts to clear.
Dean finds the perfect ring for Cas in a $2 bin at Wal-Mart.
them. All contact with Cas had been lost the moment Dean had been sent to have the bullet dug out of his shoulder. They hadn’t discussed whether they’d stay friends post-war - if they’d write, or even catch up if they were ever in the same town. It was never something really considered. So Dean was left with memories, some that tortured him in his sleep, and others that left him feeling hollow and broken and aching for something he couldn’t figure out.
Cas exhales sharply. "Dean, see; I need you."
Dean clears his throat and rolls to a sitting position on the edge of the bed. “Uh, where’s Sammy?”
“Con artist is more like it,” Dean says. Bela mock-slaps his arm.
picture - and instead glances up at his partner. Benny raises his eyebrows. “You know her?”
Anxiety and panic flood through Dean's system. He takes the liberty of wrapping Cas's fingers in his own and pressing his lips against the (fallen?) angel's temple when Sam isn't looking.
Before Dean’s brain can catch up with the program, Cas has pulled Dean’s cock from his underwear and is working his shaft lazily with agile fingers. He mouths at Dean’s neck, bites indigo flowers against Dean’s collarbone below the line of his shirt.  “Gee, but you’re swell,” Cas mumbles as he licks a nipple. Dean can’t help it; his own hands move to Cas’s hips, his fingertips biting against bone, and he moans, low and guttural. Cas appears to take this as his queue to drop to his knees and wrap that perfect mouth around Dean’s cock. He sucks it down deep without warning, making the most glorious sounds around the length; little needy keening noises that make goose bumps erupt across Dean’s skin.
“Yes,” Cas says, a delayed answer to Dean’s question. It feels more like permission. He wets his lips, keeping his gaze trained on Dean’s mouth, dragging his hand forward until he can thumb at Dean’s parted lips. Dean has no control over himself; he groans, sucking the tip in to his mouth, and Cas shudders. The salt-skin taste blossoms across Dean’s tongue. He feels those baby blues scrape up his body like a physical force until they meet his own; Cas’s pupils are totally blown, his breathing shallow.
“Did you have a friend over?” she says, pulling her coat off and hanging it on the back of a chair.
Cas doesn’t say anything for a little while, choosing instead to gaze at Dean through the gloom, his stare as unwavering and unnerving as always. “Most of us came back emotionally disconnected,” he murmurs eventually. “You shouldn’t blame yourself, Dean.”
And while ye may, go marry;
Dean reaches out, then, fingers circling Cas’s wrists, trying to keep him grounded. “It’s okay, Cas.”
“I see,” Cas says, drawing his gaze back to Dean, who is still straddling his legs. Dean quickly shifts across to the other side of the bed and runs a hand self-consciously through his hair.
They walk over to the cash register and the woman rings it through. “Which was your favourite?”
Cas begins to move, too, then; his own hands work their way around the collar of Dean’s bathrobe, pushing it off his shoulders. Dean complies. He bites down particularly hard on Cas’s neck as he twitches the robe off, and Cas flails, body jerking. He falls backwards and manages to knock a pot of something yellow all over his front. Dean laughs; Cas looks pissed.
“Yeah. Cas was a… good friend during the war. We fought in Okinawa together. Plus, hey, if it’s one thing I’m not, it’s a quitter.”
The club is Dean’s preferred haunt as it still plays good-old classic jazz, not the shit bebop rubbish that’s popular these days. Big Band really isn’t Dean’s thing – he’s definitely in to musical minimalism. Give him Ella Fitzgerald over Charlie Parker any day.
Some people cry. Some people scream. Some people try to hit him, others accuse him of playing a cruel joke, and most attempt a variation or combination of all four.
“That’s all, Doctor Novak,” Benny almost growls. “You’re remaining here ‘til we get enough evidence to either make a formal arrest, or release you.”
“More like I should be asking you the same question,” Dean mumbles, standing opposite Cas and eying him warily. “And does it matter? Didn’t take me a liquor store.”
“No,” Castiel says, smile dropping, looking affronted. “I’m an Angel of the Lord, as it says on the paper.”
When you break a bone, calcium wraps around the knitting carbon to create a structure stronger than before, reinforcing the fissure. Improving it.
"The band, Cas. Duran Duran. Not durian, the fruit."
Bela’s attention shifts from Sam to Charlie. Her mouth twists to something less predatory, more genuine. “And you’re Charlie. She’s so pretty, Dean. Why didn’t you tell me?”
“We’re here,” Dean announces twenty minutes after they’ve left the bunker, swerving into a gravel car park. Cas sets him with that hard stare and doesn’t comment. They climb out of the Impala and begin the five minute hike in silence, Cas still clutching the box a bit like a mother would hold a crying child, Dean feeling like the tin man as the cans clink together in the bag over his shoulder.
“So, uh, you got a family?” Dean asks, replacing Cas’s fork. He tries to shift until the angel is forced to move his arm to a more comfortable position – like around Dean’s shoulders.
They make love with their eyes closed that night, the salt-skin taste of sweat lingering over their tongues, skin prickling and sounds blending as they write poetry with their bodies. The sensations are lyrical, almost, as they ride the highs together as one.
His baby's engine rumbles to a start and Sam manoeuvres the car back to the side of the road. It idles as Sam gets out to open one of the back doors for Dean, and Dean gently eases Cas on to the back seat before rounding the car so he can sit on the other side.
“I don’t think it’s the whole poem,” Dean says slowly. “More like… a stanza or verse.”
“Dean?” Cas rumbles, turning to face him, frowning, his voice smoke and whisky and broken glass. “What are you doing here? Are you… drunk?”
Dean wonders if he could manage a clean shot on Lucifer.
loses meaning beyond a human construct designed to organise. There's no use for it in Purgatory as night bleeds to day and back to evening in relentless cycles.
“You’re beautiful,” he murmurs. “You so good, Cas. We’ll get them back, I promise. Please. Just be okay.”
“No, I think I get it,” Dean says, voice thick. The words almost stick in his throat.
,” Dean groans; Cas fights his orgasm away. He’s got the angle right, now, and Dean is a sweaty, trembling mess caught in the cage of his limbs. Another push, another moan. Cas leans down to where he thinks Dean’s lips are and sucks one into his mouth. Dean whimpers. “I’m –“ he gasps, shuddering, and then they’re both coming, Dean sobbing and spurting sticky and white between them, Cas crying out into Dean’s mouth. His eyes remain closed, glued shut, because this is the moment he is most vulnerable. The moment Dean may actually realise that, for Cas, this is more than an easy fuck with someone he once cared about. That this is everything he loves and loathes, these wrestling matches between the sheets. What he lives and hates himself for. Because Dean has always been everything Cas always wanted but could never have, and now he does have him, it’s bittersweet agony. He’s always been
It’s awkward angles and bones, at first. Too many hard elbows and knees; too many wayward limbs and thoughts tangled and framed by the harsh fluorescent light that floods the kitchen. It a scuffle for purchase on the other’s body, more like fighting than making love. Their teeth and noses bump. Hands grip too hard or not hard enough. Hips stutter in counterpoint before breaking to alternate rhythms. The line of their bodies, in theory, should be a congruous melody or progression – a perfect fifth. Instead they’re more like a dissonant chord, notes shattering against each other yet still working somehow.
It’s not until Cas is lying on a motel bed somewhere in Illinois that he opens the wrapped box. Inside is a disposable cell phone and a scrap of paper, a note scrawled across it in Dean’s tight script. There are instructions telling Cas how to delete all traces of contact from the phone, and the words, Stay safe. Keep in contact. I’m so sorry, Cas.
“They’re gone, Dean,” Cas says softly. “I’m human.”
“I’ll get you something better,” Dean says gruffly. “But no more vests, you hear me?”
Dean doesn’t say anything, just takes a gulp of his beer. Sam looks a bit like he’s about to pull something, he’s so keyed up, and Charlie seems to be amused by their interaction.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean mutters under his breath. Cas proceeds to sit down, pressing close to Dean, coattails fanning out behind him.
Bullets spray out; everyone scrambles for cover behind the various objects that litter the room. Dean fires a few shots of his own. He tries to stumble over to Cas; doesn’t think he can leave without making sure that he’s is okay. But his foot gets caught on something, and he’s stumbling, falling to the ground. He watches Lucifer aim his gun, and the world slips in to slow motion as Lucifer pulls the trigger.
However, on the mantelpiece in the living room, there’s a photograph of Dean and Cas and the rest of their squadron, ‘2nd Battalion, 1st Marines’ scratched in to the bottom left hand corner of the paper, and Dean feels a pang of something he can’t identify. All his friends from the war are there, all the men he lost contact with because they either died or the memories associated with them were too painful. Dean turns away quickly and moves rooms.
Cas frowns. “You need to heed your own words,” he says, face twisting in to something more serious than dull-eyed and sleep-warm. “But, Dean, what if I don’t… like what I’ve become?”
“We’ll take it slow,” Dean says into Cas’ hair. He smells of Dean’s shampoo and something sweeter, like warmed milk. Tastes like coffee and
“Thank you,” Benny says, tipping his fedora in Garth’s direction. “Guess we better give her a look, brother.”
“No, I-I mean in Japan,” he interjects. “What you did was… it was stupid, Cas, and blindingly heroic. I should have died.”
Small steps, though. He’s accepted his demons – he’s faced them head-on and realised that they’re there. Now he’s dealing with them.
Benny looks surprised - Dean never talks about the war. Benny himself fought in France, half a world away from Dean’s personal hell in the Pacific, and whilst Benny’s happy to regale anyone who listens with tales of his battalion's heroism against the Germans, Dean prefers to pretend that those two years he spent overseas never happened.
“You’ll fucking kill me yet, you little shit.”
“Don’t go, Dean,” Cas’s voice rumbles down the telephone. They’ve only seen each other once in the past two days because of work, and Dean feels like the question of their relationship is hanging heavily over both their heads. “It’s a trap.”
Huh. At least he knows he’s still in LA. Underground, but still LA.
He knows he’s acting like a twelve-year-old kid, throwing tantrums and making unfair assumptions, but he’s too stressed to care. This job is about saving people, not sitting back on the sidelines and hoping for some sort of divine intervention - some sort of fucking miracle – to occur. People make their own futures. Decisions are the only fate they’ve got.
KEVIN IS STILL ALIVE YOU CAN’T MAKE ME WRITE OTHERWISE (this fic is set sort of in a parallel universe probably set a few years into the future where everyone is alive and Cas is still human and Sam isn’t possessed by an angel and yeah. just casually re-writing parts of S9. don’t mind me). Written as part of the
Castiel applies for a job.
In a whoosh of air, a rustle of clothing, the blade rushes forward and plunges into Cas’ back. There’s a flash of light, a splatter of blood; he screams in agony, a high-pitched wail that hits Dean right in his heart. The glass in the windows explodes. A palm is pressed against his eyes, blocking out the light and the sight of Cas’ prone form bleeding on the floor. Cas screams again, louder this time, as Dean hears the wet snicker of metal cutting flesh. He tries to bite at the skin pressed against his mouth until his jaw feels as if it’s about to fall off, Cas continuing to shriek against the sound of bones snapping and blades cutting. Dean’s definitely crying now; his eyes are stinging, the metallic taste of tears heavy on his tongue. Dean feels nauseous; he thinks he’s going to be sick.
Cas huffs and approaches the racks of sweater vests. He’s apparently developed a thing for them, and regardless of Dean’s protests and idle threats of refusing to sleep with Cas if he keeps wearing them, every time they visit a clothing store, the fallen angel insists on buying a new one. It’s driving Dean nuts.
Love’ can be spat like curse or whispered like a cure in moments like these - broken glass between teeth, the whisper of lips on lips, a blade’s edge against a throat, but Dean knows logically that he doesn’t love Cas – not like that; not quite yet, although he knows he could someday. And although it sounds soppy and corny and like something from all the family movies Dean doesn’t watch, they do make love. There’s no other word for it. He lets himself love Cas for just this beat in time, his heart thrumming for release against his breastbone, pneumatic utterances and half-sighs the soundtrack to their submission as they move together.
Wait, what. “Huh?”
He’s in a rectangular concrete room. It looks like some sort of warehouse with orange boxes stacked against the walls, bearing down on him, shadows in the light cast by only one globe. If he focuses hard enough, he can hear the rumble of a trolley car overhead. A whisper of music.
They’ve been lucky for the last few hours. Since their previous… altercation, the one where Dean’s error in judgment cost his platoon too many lives (the one Dean
Dean laughs. He feels a rush of affection for the stupid angel, the tension leaking from his body with every chortle. “For fuckssake, Cas. That doesn’t explain the warzone here, though. Jesus Christ. Is the only collateral so far those eggs and the floor?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re on,” he mumbles against the heat of Cas’s skin as his fingers dance along the undulations of Cas’s spine.
Dean wakes the next morning in the scratchy motel bed with no hangover, a patchy memory, and a feather the length of his forearm hidden under his pillow.
They’re supposed to be hunting a Wendigo in upstate Washington, somewhere near the US/Canadian border, and they’ve been stalking the son of a bitch for hours. There’s no way it should be taking this long, however, except for how it is, because Dean keeps getting distracted by the stretch of faded plaid across Cas’s back. The red and black goes something awesome with his golden skin tone, and the material is just the right kind of too big and worn that Cas has to roll up the sleeves and expose lean forearms with their thin chords of muscle. Not to mention that it’s Cas in his clothes.
Dean presses his face against Cas’s neck, smiling a little despite the ball of guilt in his chest. “The guys forgave me?”
Cas sounds so earnest that it almost breaks Dean's heart. This grumpy, sassy, intelligent, beautiful, obtuse ex-angel of the fucking Lord is too much, sometimes. Often.
Dean just glares. Cas glances back down at the pistol. “We have guns in heaven. They’re just much more… fancy than this. This is a nice one, however. Thank you. It will be useful.” He purses his lips, clicking the safety back in to place. “Although I did always did prefer swords.”
“I did. I’m okay.” Cas’ fingers itch to reach out, to take Dean’s hand and soothe the worry from him with a touch. But he can’t do that here, and that’s something he’ll have to accept.
“Do you want help?” Cas asks. It’s a safe assumption he still doesn’t know what he’s doing when it comes to cars, but he’ll take every opportunity to spend as much time around Dean as he can today.
Something in Dean’s brain clicks, all the puzzle pieces of devotion, pain, and years of history between them finally comes together. It builds in Dean’s chest manifesting in a sort of unwavering ache he’s never felt before.
He’s dreaming, he must be dreaming.
“Hi, welcome to Country West, how can I help you?”
There are more pictures scattered around the house. Thankfully, a few of them include Cas in front of a history lecture hall at what appears to be a local community college. At least the profession fits, as Cas
“Do you think you can walk? We’ve got a bit of a trek outta here.”
Dean takes an aggressively big bite of his cornbread.
Cas looks up at him, momentarily startled. He smiles when he sees Dean, glances down at his book to dog-ear the page, and then closes it with a quiet clap.
“Dean,” Cas’ voice cuts through Dean’s thoughts and Dean turns to look at him.
“No. Nononono.” He scans through the trees, tears pricking at his eyes.
Miracle bumps against Cas’ thigh, needy for food, looking up at him with pleading eyes. He pats her head, stroking through her soft fur and shoos her out of the room.
“No, you can only create for yourself. Only angels and Jack can create for everyone else.”
They make it into Wind Point around dinner time. Dean isn’t hungry yet and Cas doesn’t need to eat as often as Dean does, so they decide to find a room and then interview the witness.
For the first time since
Anger fizzles under his skin, directed towards Sam for giving up the one chance they had to
“I know, but I don’t like seeing you in pain.”
“No.” Hastily, he scrambles to his feet, frantically spinning around, searching the edges of the nearby forest for any sign of a tan trenchcoat and a shock of dark hair.
A jingle of keys, scruff of boots on the floor, the swish of Dean’s jacket going on over his shoulders, and then the door clicks shut. Cas rolls over onto his back and opens his eyes.
Like the good soldier he was trained to be, Dean wipes his tears, and carries on.
Weird. Wonder what that’s about.
to her and to them
Cas shakes his head at him like he’s ridiculous like this should have been
Halfway to Wind Point they stop somewhere in bumfuck Iowa for snacks and gas. Dean goes inside to grab some stuff, trusting Cas to fill the tank for the first time in his life. He keeps an eye on him from inside the store, ready to bust out there if so much as a drop of gas gets on the Impala’s paint. Cas does fine, and looks annoyed when he catches Dean’s eye through the window watching him. Playing it off, Dean obnoxiously waves a bag of M&M’s at him, but stops when Cas ignores him and gets back in the car.
Dean’s eyes meet Cas’, cocky and challenging. “Prove it.”
There isn’t much that signifies anything about their current life in this future other than the pictures he finds around the house.
you’ll have me.”
“You don’t have to, but I’m here if you want to.”
“I could eat,” Cas answers. He finishes up watering the new plant he tended to, pats the dirt from his hands onto his jeans, and stands up. “What were you thinking?”
Back in the Impala Dean heads east, straight towards the bunker. Towards home. It will take a few days to get back and with Cas’ weakening state, he’s less inclined to do the long haul drive as he used to. Normally, Cas doesn’t sleep, but with how he keeps dozing off in the passenger seat next to him, Dean thinks a comfy sleep in a bed will do him good and may even help replenish what little grace he has left more quickly.
“Give him time, maybe he’s scared too. After all, you didn’t get to tell him how you feel and he didn’t expect to ever get the chance to see you again.”
Dean looks at him, their eyes meeting. If Cas isn’t mistaken, he leans into the touch of Cas’ hand. “Yeah,” he says, soft. “I think so. Just feels like I got the wind knocked outta me.”
Paul Redmond, the late Sally Benson’s boyfriend, lives in a picturesque part of Wind Point. The neighborhood borders Lake Michigan, a tall white lighthouse to the right and within walking distance. Paul’s house is cookie-cutter perfect, like something out of
at Cas and watches while Cas looks back. Words suddenly pour out of him, not the ones he wants to say, but ones he needs to say. “In Purgatory, I wanted this...when I found you, but there wasn’t time.”
Cas had no intention to refuse him, but he still sees his fate sealing before his eyes, regret already filling him at how he’d resisted telling Dean earlier. They would not have been in this situation if he had. He nods slowly, rising to his feet, fingers trailing up Dean’s back and away as he stands, one last touch before it’s all inevitably ripped away. “We do.”
happy, for the first time.”
, leans in and kisses Dean.
“Mommy, what does love feel like?”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“Man, you really like to hear yourself talk, huh?” Dean asks.
He kneels down next to Cas and scratches Miracle behind her ears, smiling at the memory of how he found her, scared and huddled up, the last living being. “Well, she was a bit of happiness I found when it seemed like there wasn’t any left, so I figured I’d better let her stick around.”
“It’s not done yet, but welcome!” With a wide swoop of his arm, Dean gestures towards the inside of the house. Miracle runs up the steps in front of them, rushing through the door, barking.
“I’d like to take a look at it.”
Ahead of him is a grand, curved staircase, looking very worse for wear. Dean moves to step forward, but freezes mid-stride when he hears a shuffle from a nearby room. Darting around the corner, he angles his knife for attack. Inside his chest, his heart pounds erratically. He hears squeaking floorboards and heavy footsteps of someone getting closer.
It’s then Cas remembers he keeps the mixtape Dean gave him a few years ago in his trench coat pocket. He’s rather sentimental about it, he supposes, and even though he didn’t wear the coat today it’s spread out in the back seat within reach. He hands the cassette to Dean, smiling to himself as a very loud encompassing silence overtakes the car.
“Yeah, he’s special,” Dean says, with a little laugh. “But this— it’s okay with you?”
“I won’t be very good,” Cas answers, doubtful.
“You’re incorrigible,” Cas states, as butterflies flip-flop around in his stomach.
“You have secrets, Castiel. About what you saw in your
If he were at all confident in Cas’ feelings for him still being what they were, this is the moment in which Dean would muster up all his courage and kiss him. He’s not that guy yet, he hasn’t found his courage. And despite Cas’ words ever-present in his head —
Looking up Dean watches as Cas’ eyelashes flutter as Dean sucks a mark on his neck. Behind them is a stained glass window, sunlight streams through it and cascades a dozen rainbow crosses over their intertwined bodies.
Inside his chest, Cas' heart flips with something that feels a little bit like hope.
They return to the bunker late the next afternoon. Sam is waiting for them with burgers and beers already spread out on the map table and doesn’t even make some smart-ass comment about their diets. While they eat, Sam updates them on what he’s learned about Chuck, which ends up being a steaming pile of nothing. Probably hiding out somewhere, planning his next move on how to fuck up their lives six ways to Sunday.
“I don’t know how this is gonna end, if it ends bloody or if somehow we make it out on top. But what I do know is,” Dean licks his lips and makes sure Cas’ eyes are on his. “That I love you.” Dean sniffles and lets it out in a shaky laugh. “I should have told you so
Cas’ vision clears and he finally,
“Doubt we’ll need it, but thanks Sam.”
“Never?” Cas asks.
“Fuck.” Dean cringes and steps back out, tugging the door shut behind him. He’ll deal with that... later.
Snowflakes float down from the sky, spiraling in midair, landing in Cas’ hair. The metal bench under him is icy, the snow-melt soaking through his pant legs but he barely feels the chill. Inside him a burning has started in the shape of Dean’s name, a tiny snuff of a fire, intensifying with every passing second.
Halfway through the process, Miracle’s ears perk up at some sound unheard by Dean, and she jumps off her perch on the couch, running over towards the front door. Distantly, over the music, Dean hears gravel crackling outside. Probably Sam. He’s gotten into a habit of coming over the past few mornings and having coffee with Dean before going back home or exploring the rest of new Heaven. Miracle starts barking excitedly and rushes out the newly installed doggie door. Her barks increase a few seconds later, which is odd. If it were Sam she would have recognized him.
Cas can hear Dean following him, the sway of his steps creaking with the wooden floor of the deck, but he keeps walking.
Days pass, turning into weeks or so Cas surmises. Time in Heaven passes at an unknown pace, the sun still rises and the moon replaces her at dusk, but it’s immeasurable to anyone, even the angels. Only Jack knows the structure of time, the holder of the fate of all things. Cas isn’t sure how long he’s stayed in Dean’s home before he finally starts to settle in. It takes a bit. At first, he’s worried that this whole arrangement is temporary, somehow he’ll be pulled away from Dean and never be allowed to return. But there’s no evil out there that has it out for him, Jack protects them, keeps the demons and monsters at bay, only stopping by to say hello or to answer requests the souls in Heaven have for him. Jack keeps it all spinning by himself, controlling Chuck’s power with ease.
“Yeah, maybe.” Dean’s jaw ticks and he fights back the urge to argue, his self-loathing creeping up on him. After what Cas told him, he’s tried hard to fight back against it, but it keeps rearing its ugly head. “Anyway, how are you doing?”
Dean doesn’t know how long he was been out, could have been minutes, could have been hours. There are no tracks leading from the sigil out into the woods, so he wanders, weaving in and out through the trees. The longer he goes without finding Cas, the quicker his heart rate increases. He feels like he can’t breathe properly like there’s something lodged in his windpipe.
Dean gets home around 5:30, bringing a pizza from a local joint with him. They eat at the kitchen table, sitting kitty-corner across from each other, close enough so that their thighs brush under the table. Midway through a conversation about a beat-up ‘64 Chevelle Dean fixed today, he pins Cas’ foot under his and starts grinning like he’s the cat who caught the canary. Cas can’t help but lean over and press a kiss to his cheek, because he can, and he loves watching how Dean blushes anytime Cas shows him affection.
He turns around, facing the house, admiring it in the afternoon light. It’s simple from the outside, quaint, robin’s egg blue paint covering the walls with whitewashed shutters.
It’s not possible for a being like Cas to love Dean, to be in love with him, to want all the human things Dean wants with him. The most Dean can hope for,
“You’re wrong,” Cas says. “Dean!” The blade bangs against Cas’ wrist. “I know you can hear me, you don’t want to hurt me.”
“I noticed,” Sam says. “Do you think the Djinn gave him some sort of memory from Heaven? And now he’s missing it up there?”
The door creaks as it’s pulled open, revealing Mary, a soft smile appearing on her face the moment she sees Dean.
at him.
“Hey,” Dean says, sounding almost loopy, a pink blush rising on his cheeks.
He’s alone, for now, but he can sense Anna’s presence nearby, the ozone-clean scent she leaves behind. Resting his elbows on his knees, Castiel leans forward, covering his face with his palms. Anna’s warning reverberates in his mind, clear and terrified.
“You think this hunt will help?” Sam taps away on his computer and then rotates the laptop, sliding it over to Dean so he can look.
It takes a second to light, but it catches on the old, dried wood and quickly ignites bright and hot. He looks to Dean and sees a bright shot of orange flame leave his body, rush towards the mirror, then disappear skyward into the ceiling.
“Yeah, I heard ya the first time. So, can we?” Dean puts on his most charming smile, hoping it can work on Paul like it works on the ladies.
“So, is the ghost traveling around from mirror to mirror by jumping people? Or is it just this specific mirror?” Dean asks.
Cas hears Dean come closer, the soft pad of his shoes in the dirt until he’s right next to Cas, their shoulders bumping.
“I mean about what happened, the Djinn, you wanna talk about it?”
Steps come pounding up the stairs, closer now. Dean saws faster, the rope turning to ribbons, falling like sawdust at his feet. The rope snaps and Cas falls right into Dean’s arms, Dean catching him and gently guiding him to the floor. Shoving the trenchcoat under his head, Dean pats Cas’ cheek one more time. “Don’t you dare die on me.”
Dean’s eyelids start fluttering and his fingers rub absentmindedly on Cas’ forearm. He must be dreaming, something happy, not like the nightmares that normally torment him more often than Cas would like. When Cas was at full power he’d use it to ease those dreams. Dean’s snoring stops and he hugs Cas tighter against him, the blankets shifting with them.
Dean grins. Carefully, he maneuvers Miracle off his lap. She snorts in her sleep, but doesn’t do much other than snuggle closer to Cas. While Dean wanders between the living room and the kitchen, Cas watches him. He’s whistling under his breath as he slips the disk into the DVD player and heading back into the kitchen to get popcorn. Coming back to the couch, crunching on popcorn, Dean sits close, sets the popcorn bowl on top of their thighs between Miracle and the couch. Once Miracle notices Dean’s presence, she shifts, nuzzling against his hip. She huffs and sighs, settling and then looks up at Dean. He gives her a quick pet and gets comfortable as the movie starts.
“Yeah,” Dean says, “I taught you what good music sounds like,
This part of the house reminds him of the Bunker. Hung up on the walls are various guns and knives and a few bottles of holy water, all of which he recognizes having been previously stored in the Impala. There’s a wide gap in the center of the garage, presumably for the Impala, and to the left of it is his truck.
Today already feels like it’s going to be a long day.
Dean’s hands come to rest on Cas’ biceps, desperation in his eyes as he touches him gently. Those hands slide up to cup Cas’ cheeks, thumbs stroking over his jaw. “Don’t leave me.”
When Cas comes to, he’s somewhere dark. He squints his eyes against the lack of light, adjusting to the drastic contrast. Distantly, he hears someone saying his name and feels the pressure of hands on his cheeks. There’s a smell of cool fresh air, and the musk of damp moss after a rainfall. Decaying wood and metallic blood. He blinks a few times and his vision starts to clear, revealing Dean, the real one, a few inches away.
For a few seconds Cas holds back from fucking his mouth, wanting to let Dean do the work, but he’s too far gone, control slipping. He reaches down with the hand not tangled in Dean’s hair and takes Dean’s hand off his thigh and intertwines their fingers. With an easy roll of his hips, he starts fucking into the heat of Dean’s mouth and suction of his lips.
“You don’t need to thank me, Dean. You know I’d do anything for you.”
You bought Texas Star beer instead of El Sol, sang Rush under your breath when doing dishes. It was just
There’s a rustle in the bushes a few yards behind him and Dean whips around, gun trained on the spot. A rabbit bounds towards him, dashing across his toes and off into the underbrush.
“Cas?” Dean tries, voice gentler.
“You know I had been so nervous that morning,” Dean admits, guiding Cas from his spot next to the dresser back to bed so they can eat together. Cas watches as Dean picks up a piece of bacon, taking a bite and crunching away on it while he continues. “After everything we’d been through, with Chuck and the world ending, I still thought it was too good to be true that this was actually happening, that you were going to be marrying me. Good things don’t happen for me, ya know?”
Spinning around in Dean’s arms, Cas cups his face between his hands and kisses him. “Gladly.”
Loving Dean isn’t just something he does, it’s who he is. Loving Dean is tied to his very essence, ingrained into the fabric of his grace since the moment he seared his palm to Dean’s arm and raised him from Hell. He lived and loved Dean, and that was enough. All that’s left is to help Dean see the good of who he really is, how his love for the world made Castiel love the same world right along with him.
Once all their things are settled in the room and they’ve both changed into fed suits, they do a little research with the police department to get the witness’ address and head back out to the Impala.
It’s been hours since Sam left to go to his own home, and hours since Dean climbed into bed, the exhaustion of this new world and the unknown of eternity burrowing deep into his bones. He can’t sleep, not like this, with the overpowering silence allowing thoughts to fill his mind. Rolling over onto his side towards the window, Dean looks out at the house next door-- Sam’s. Eileen isn’t there yet, but she will be one day when it’s her time. The lights are still on and he can see Sam’s tall shadow moving around. Then, all at once, everything goes dark.
“I know, but when you’re there it feels real. When I got hit by a Djinn, it took a lot to get me to realize it wasn’t, how did you get out?” Dean asks.
Dean sighs, burrowing his face into his pillow, and finishes his prayer. “Stop by sometime, Cas. You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to, but I’d like to see you. And know that...you’re always welcome here.”
Cas thinks.
Paul answers on the fourth knock. He’s pajama-clad, eyes red-rimmed with huge dark bags underneath. “Can I help you?”
He chances a look at Cas, finds him with his head tilted to the side a look of open curiosity on his face. Dean loves him,
“You don’t have to say something you’re not ready for.”
“Do you like it?” Cas asks, looking over at Dean.
Cas kneels down behind the altar and Dean goes to him, curious as to what he’s found. Rising to his feet, Cas reveals a small polaroid resting in his palm. Hovering over Cas’ shoulder, Dean peers down. His heart stutters in his throat at the image before him. It’s faded on the edges and browned from weather damage, but the two men are clear. One, dark-haired with eyes eerily similar to Cas’, is wearing a cassock: a priest. He’s grinning and his arm is wrapped around the other man. The other is clad in regular clothes, a polo and jeans, with slightly lighter hair. He’s leaning in and kissing the priest’s cheek, smiling as he does, eyes crinkling at the corners from obvious joy.
They come seconds apart into Cas’ fist. Dean pants Cas’ name against his lips, breathless and completely undone. He doesn’t miss the way Cas’ eyes spark blue right as he comes, and the stained glass window behind him shatters into a thousand colorful pieces.
“Whataya want for breakfast?” Dean whispers.
This isn’t what Cas expected this morning. It’s too close to what the Djinn gave him, even if it’s accidental, and already starting to toy with his mind. He worries what will happen when Dean wakes up, if he’ll brush it off or be upset. Right now, though, all he can do is focus on how good it feels to have Dean in his arms, scooting in closer and nuzzling against the back of his neck.
“Dream juice,” the djinn repeats, smiling widely.
Miracle snuggles up against his chest, nudging her nose underneath his chin and licks him just once. Dean hugs her tight, running a hand through her shaggy hair.
The trench coat hangs in the back of Cas’ closet, present but not to be worn. A reminder of what he was, of who he used to be. A sort of shedding of his past life. Even now, he has no need to change clothes, with a snap of his fingers he can be clean, but he enjoys the process of picking out things that make him look good, taking a shower and how the heat of the water warms his skin. Oddly enough, in Heaven he’s embraced the aspects of humanity more than he did when he was actually human.
Dean swallows thick against the lump rising in his throat.
Outside the house, he finds a garden. Small and simple, a neat garden box, four lines of tilled dirt horizontally across the width. A few shoots are popping up in the soil, bright green, closed flower buds reaching towards the sky for the sun. He wonders if this is his doing or Dean’s. Gardening is something he’d like, he thinks, toiling over dirt, creating new life with his hands.
“Hey, I got us a room. Might be more comfy if you sleep inside.”
“I call the shower,” Dean yells, dropping his duffle onto the faded periwinkle couch next to the door, not giving Cas a chance to respond before he disappears inside the bathroom.
“Cas, I gotta say something.”
Dean finds the problem with Baby easy enough, well-practiced from fixing her over the years even in this false universe. The whole process takes longer than necessary as Cas’ presence becomes more of a distraction than an asset. Every time Dean slides out from under the car, shirt damp and slick against his chest, he’s entirely too distracting. Cas can’t help how his gaze openly travels down Dean’s body. He is... something else, and the oil smudges on his cheeks and biceps shouldn’t make the visual even more appealing. But it’s Dean, who manages to make everything look attractive.
“Clearly,” Cas deadpans, looking over at the kitchen where Addie wandered off to, then back to Dean. He leans forward and narrows his eyes. “You’re still bleeding.”
Whatifyoustayed
There’s a half-smile on Cas’ face while he sleeps and the trench coat is pulled up against his chin like a blanket. He looks so peaceful and relaxed that Dean hates to disturb him. An itch to reach up and card his fingers through Cas’ hair comes over him, but Dean swallows thick and ignores it, reaching out to tap Cas on the shoulder.
“Ready.”
sound like a dream,” Dean states, in wonder.
They stumble towards each other and Dean grips Cas tight, pulls Cas to him and holds him. He’s real and alive and Dean releases a stuttered breath from deep in his lungs and clings.
Dean chuckles. “Alright sleepy-head, I’ll be back in a few.”
The song changes to
“I’ll be back in a bit, don’t miss me too much,” Dean teases. He winks at Cas and brings Cas’ hand, the one he has trapped in his own, up to his mouth and kisses the top of it. It’s then Cas notices the silver band on his own finger.
Dean snorts a laugh. “You don’t know Cas.”
, something Dean would have dreamed about having in childhood. He parks on the side of the street up against a freshly made curb and turns to look at Cas.
Dean squats down next to the record player, flipping through the records until he finds
“Your father just left,” she says, pulling back to look at him. “He went to see Bobby I think. They were going to shoot pool at Harvelle’s and drink for a bit, not sure.”
Dean drops to his knees and nods, looking up at Cas. His hands ghost up and down Cas’ thighs before making eye contact and circling his tongue around the head of Cas’ cock. He drags the head over his lips, a sight which makes Cas moan and reach down with his hand, gripping Dean’s hair to tug him closer, encouraging him until Dean sucks him all the way down. Dean’s mouth is hot, velvety soft, and Cas bucks his hips impatiently. Dean pulls back off to lick up the side and then takes him deep, bobbing his head, keeping eye contact.
Cas covers Dean’s hand with his own, warm fingers slotting between Dean’s and squeezing.“I love you too,” he says, resolute. Dean holds onto the words, ingrains them into his memory, places them somewhere deep inside his brain next to the sound of Mary’s laugh from when he was four.
“Want dinner?” He asks. There’s a half-eaten strawberry in between his fingers and he takes another bite while waiting for Cas’ answer, the tips of his fingers dyed pink from the juice.
, Cas knows this instantly. It’s Verna.
Cas agrees with a non-commital noise.
“Well, why do you eat all my food when you don’t have to eat?” Dean asks, breaking through Cas’ inappropriate thoughts, shooting Cas’ own question back at him.
Cas smiles against Dean’s mouth, he could get used to this. “Perfect.”
“Shut up,” Cas yells. The words spewing out of Dean’s mouth aren’t true, meant only to taunt him. He knows it’s not true. A few months ago he might have believed her, but he and Dean are good now. They really are.
The first few notes of “
Dean scans the newspaper article clipping.
Dean pauses, and the knife scrapes over the cutting board. He looks up at Cas, a quizzical look on his face. “Not really, though I’ve been thinking lately of creating my own bar. As you know, from when you and Sam were in my mind, that’s sorta been a dream of mine.”
They both stare at the image for a moment and then Cas flips over the picture. Scribbled in neat cursive is a note.
He looks up from his laptop, bright screen meaning he has to blink his eyes to adjust to the room. He looks over to Dean and finds Dean staring back at him with an intense gaze, a sardonic smirk playing on his lips.
plays, throwing Cas back into nostalgia of cowboy hats and Dean’s exuberant joy of all things western. Cas tries to watch, he does, but he focuses on the tremble of Dean’s soul, the awakened lightness now present there. The ache reverberating in Dean’s soul remains, but dimmed some. Before, where Cas had sensed fear, it’s gone. Instead, there’s just a lingering need Cas is unable to decipher. He leans into Dean’s hand, the touch he’s been freely given, of comfort, need, or of their talk from a few minutes ago. It’s new and he welcomes it, even though Dean’s intention is no doubt platonic, he’ll take whatever Dean is willing to give.
“Wait -- no, I...” Dean starts to protest and feels his cheeks start to heat up. He
An afternoon of easy companionship is exactly what Cas needs before he has to go. He wonders if he’s alright back in the real world. No doubt Dean is looking for him, but the djinn’s hideout is deep into the woods. He’ll live, probably; he’s still an angel and it will take a lot more out of the djinn to kill him than it would a human.
“I imagine they didn’t. But Charles and Matthew knew the truth: that their love wasn’t something to be ashamed of. They made this church into a sanctuary, for each other and...” Cas’ voice falters and his Adam’s Apple bobs when he swallows. “For others like them.”
“Can I touch you?”
“Dean, I’m your Mom. I love you no matter what. Honestly, it’s impossible to believe anyone could be worthy of you, but if someone were to be, it would be Cas.”
“That’s okay, I’ll just bother you about it if I want something,” Dean says, bumping his shoulder into Cas’.
Paul leads them down a long, narrow hallway and swerves left. He gestures with a hand towards an open door. “It’s in there. We bought it when we moved in, a few weeks ago at a thrift store on the outskirts of town. Some local family’s heirloom I guess, seemed pretty old and gaudy, but Sally liked the wood-lace edges. She always had a thing for vintage decor.”
“Birds,” Dean says, immediately. “And... maybe trucks, or more cars at least. More animals. I wasn’t gonna say anything, but sometimes it’s hard to sleep. It's too quiet.”
Absentmindedly tapping his fingers on the steering wheel, Dean sidelong glances at Cas and finds Cas watching him.
home. Little by little, he settles in; decorating his room, filling up the empty spaces on the walls in the main rooms with photos of his own and various artifacts he remembers from over the years. Over time, at Dean’s urging, Cas even lets go of the trench coat, manifesting new clothes for himself; jeans and plaid most days similar to Dean’s. Sometimes, in the evenings after dinner, he’ll change into soft sweatpants that hang loose on his hips and throws on one of Dean’s band t-shirts he stole from the laundry bin. It seems to become him. He likes how he looks, how jeans fit neatly over the curve of his ass and hug his thighs. Dean doesn’t say much, but sometimes Cas will catch him looking at him differently, a little bit in awe, a dazed smile on his face.
Tonight, things feel different, heightened yet comforting at the same time. Loving Dean is akin to the exhilaration that comes from flying, but being around him is the closest Cas has ever felt to having a home. He craves the closeness he wishes Dean would give him, their bodies wrapped up around one another, hidden under blankets and away from the rest of the world. They’ll come close tonight and it will be enough. It will have to be.
Rising back up to his feet, Dean dusts the grass off his knees, taking a moment to think about his answer. “I don’t know yet, I’ve got all of eternity I guess to figure it out. What about you? Jack still need help?”
“Hmppphh?” Cas asks, blearily, half awake.
“She’s lovely, Dean.”
“You got any rooms available? Two queens if possible.”
Cas curls his fingers tighter around Dean’s wrist and bumps his knee against Dean’s. “I’m not going anywhere, not unless you tell me to. I’d like to stay forever, if that’s alright. Though, you may get sick of me after a millennia.”
Billie pounds her fist against the door, and it shakes under the force of the blows. The warding will hold, but not long enough. There isn’t time, they’re going to die here,
If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say this place was haunted just by looking at it. A great hideout for a djinn, tucked back a few miles off the highway where it would take cops hours of searching to even find the place.
, Dean thinks. The words form in his mouth and then, like falling off a precipice, fall in a rush from his lips.
“Thank you, Cas.” Dean lets his gaze lock with Cas’, the sparkling blue of them, brightened in the sun. He needs Cas to know how thankful he really is, for everything, for saving him, and sacrificing himself to save the universe.
Later, after the dust settles, Chuck vanishing to who knows where bringing them back to square one, Eileen leaves, taking a piece of Sam’s heart with her. Dean tries to talk to him, tries to ease the ache. He doesn’t tell him he gets it, even though he does, more acutely than Sam might realize. But Sam has tunnel-vision, more intent on finding a solution to the Chuck-problem than dealing with whatever mess of emotion going on in that head of his.
“I like having what you make, you’re good at cooking, and you clearly enjoy it.” Cas looks up, pausing from his dicing, to meet Dean’s eyes.
They end up in the backyard, where the green neatly cut grass stretches to the edge of a glistening lake. Miracle darts around, rolling around in the grass and running out to the dock where there’s a wicker chair with a fishing pole resting up against it. Dean might get a boat to add to the dock’s collection, he’s not sure yet. Cas stands a few feet away, hands stuffed into the pockets of his trench coat, lit up in the glow of the sun. His wings sparkle, a kaleidoscope of colors in the light and Dean can’t take his eyes off of him.
“What are we making exactly?” Cas asks. He cleans the knife in the sink, sets it aside and looks up at Dean expectantly.
The first night after Sam arrives, once Dean has Miracle curled up at his side, he tries to sleep. Not out of necessity — in Heaven there’s no need for sleep — but out of want. Undisturbed sleep was a rarity during his life. Here, he intends to take advantage of as much sleep as he can get. But with that particular blessing comes difficulties. Dean finds that it’s too quiet even with Miracle’s heavy breathing.
His mind drifts to Cas curled up around him in the same bed he finds himself in right now. The morning glow would be radiant on Cas’ cheeks, illuminating mussed hair and sleepy eyes, making him look far too human and vulnerable. If Dean had his way, he’d wake up next to Cas for the rest of eternity, content to kiss him awake and spend his mornings in bed letting Cas wake him up with his hands.
He keeps the music low while he drives. The freeway is empty this time in the evening, just past sunset. He passes large semis and smaller family vans, their headlights bobbing like ghostly halos over the bumps in the road. Cas is covered up with his trench coat, eyes drooping, but still watching the scenery pass by out the window. He’s been quiet since they got back into the car. Dean knows he’s not feeling too hot, but something about Cas seems different and sadder.
“You always do, eventually.” Dean says, in a quiet, sad voice. Cas stares at him, his grace twisting around in his chest, aching in guilt of the pain he’s caused Dean. He looks resolute, like he’s trying to focus on his drink, but Cas knows him too well that the flash of unease and fear in his eyes doesn’t go unnoticed. He feels it the sound of Dean’s soul, a hollow echo like a lone train whistle in the darkness.
Eventually, they do actually shower; it’s languid, washing each other’s hair and sharing casual touches while they rinse away the sweat of the day. It’s the first time Cas has ever showered with anyone, and it’s strangely more intimate than anything sexual that took place beforehand. Allowing Dean to see him, naked as he is, makes him feel incredibly vulnerable. He wonders if it’s the human shame in him coming out, or if Dean’s open acceptance and visible love for him is too jarring to take in all at once.
He feels even better once he gets out of the shower, muscles lax from the heat, the adrenaline high of his orgasm still fuzzy in his head. Drying off, he ties the towel around his waist and steps out into the cool of the motel room. His duffle is on the far side of the bed, and he digs through it looking for a clean pair of clothes. Realistically, he could put back on his typical trench coat and suit outfit, but due to his weakened state temperature changes have been affecting him more lately, meaning jeans and a t-shirt are more fitting.
As he gets closer he examines the house. It’s badly withered, and one strong gust of wind could topple the whole thing over. The front steps are crooked, wide planks curved with age. They whine in protest as he steps up, wobbling under his feet. As expected, the front door is unlocked, he pushes it open and slips inside, staying against the main wall. Once inside, he digs the angel blade out from its sheath inside his boot.
“For as long as I live,” Cas whispers.
Dean finds Cas asleep, head resting on the window of the Impala, when he gets back to the car. He doesn’t bother disturbing him, but gets to work as quietly as he can unloading their duffles from the trunk into the room. Once everything is inside, he slips back into the driver’s side, moving to wake Cas, but he freezes.
Dean thinks about Sam, thinks about all of his friends, the ones he’s weaved into his extended family over the years. They’re close now, they’re safe, and it’s not Earth but it’s a kind of living without the pain of being alive. He thinks of Cas, of what he gave up to save Dean, to save the world, and how with his love he changed this place into something good, for everyone. Mary’s words echo in his head.
“Why do you keep trying? So stubborn,” Verna says, clucking her tongue. “You really should have stayed with the djinn, Castiel. At least there, he would have cared about you. Here, you’re just a burden.”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, smiling soft. “You’re okay.”
“I did?”
Cas preens, his wings fluttering at Dean’s praise. “I’ll make other animals too, and some cars to pass by once an hour every night, so it feels a little more like what you remember. If you think of anything else, tell me.”
“It’s alright Dean, your cowboy fetish is safe with me.” Cas smiles, ever so sweetly. Dean has never wanted to throw a cowboy hat on Cas’ head and kiss him more than he does in this moment.
“Uh, a bacon cheeseburger and a coffee for me,” Dean answers, flashing her a warm smile.
“I’ve prepared for this, it was inevitable.” Cas thinks about the Djinn-dream, how in every universe humanity is a part of his future and Dean is always the cause.
“The djinn,” Cas says. He looks up and meets Dean’s gaze. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”
Verna moves forward, swinging the angel blade like it’s a baton. Cas stays back, waiting for Verna to come at him first; he won’t hurt Dean, not if he doesn’t have to. Lunging low, Verna goes for his thigh, but Cas moves too fast, jerking to the side and grabbing hold of Verna’s forearm. The blade swings around, aiming for his head, but Cas ducks, slipping under Verna’s trapped arm and snatching the other, pinning them behind her back.
“So what happened?” Dean prods. He takes notes while Paul talks, a courtesy to look the part rather than out of actual need.
Dean breaks eye contact first and Cas watches as he toys with a stray thread on his pillow.
you’re wrong.”
“I’m sorry for your loss,” Cas says, genuine sympathy in his tone. Dean nods his agreement.
“So you left,” Dean states.
“What can I get you boys?” Addie asks, voice soft with a hint of a southern drawl peeking out.
Cas, once again all-powerful like when Dean first met him, a comet attached to a wavelength of grace, is preoccupied with fixing Heaven. There’s no way his proud declaration of love for Dean from before the Empty took him still rings true. His grace had been fading, allowing human weakness to seep in. A weakness that Dean’s existence created from the moment Castiel pulled him out of Hell. But now Cas is whole again, in Heaven where he started, and working to make Heaven something that the souls spending eternity here will enjoy.
Their eyes lock and Cas feels the intensity of it like a living thing, a flutter in his chest. He’s supposed to kiss Dean now. That’s what’s supposed to happen, in another world that isn’t this one where he’s allowed to do that sort of thing.
Dean pushes open the door and at the base of his front steps stands Cas, looking the same as Dean first saw him twelve years ago, all-powerful and angelic. For a moment Dean can’t breathe, hung up on Cas’ wings, visible now in all their heavenly glory and stretching high above him, silky black and streaked in rainbows wherever the light touches them. He’s alive and he’s here. God, he’s
Dean leans in and pushes the pads of two fingers up to the reflective surface. It’s ice cold and stings his fingers, making them bright red when he pulls back in shock. Cas meets his eyes with a knowing look, subtle enough that it isn’t noticed by Paul.
“That’s okay. I’ll teach ya.”
“I’m okay,” Cas lies.
“Different? How?” Dean asks, confused.
He slips his arms around Cas’ waist from behind, nuzzling against the nape of his neck and breathing him in. Cas smells like lightning, the ground after a rainstorm, and Dean’s herbal shampoo — entirely human and cosmic. And Dean loves him.
“I don’t know,” Cas answers. He continues forward climbing up the few steps to the altar, examining it. There’s a tablecloth covering it, most likely used to be white but now faded to a tan. Dean watches as Cas carefully lifts up the fabric, running his fingers under the wood underneath, checking for sigils or any sign of supernatural activity that explains this feeling, this
His deal with The Empty was made in a spur of the moment decision, knowing inherently that Dean can’t love him how Castiel wants him to. Castiel thought that might save him, but he knows now how naive he was.
In Heaven, it’s quiet.
Of course, he follows.
“But that’s the problem, you’re not Dean.”
Cas’ thumb rubs into the side of Dean’s hand, comforting. A rush of grace flows through Dean, not for healing but it calms him just the same. Taking his eyes off the road, Dean chances a look at Cas and finds him looking back, there’s sadness in his eyes but understanding reflected back at him.
“Oh Dean,” Cas says with a fond sigh, lips twitching in amusement. “I’m sorry I can’t heal you.”
“Dunno, just driving. We can go home if you’d like.”
“You... blacked out?”
“Yeah, me too.”
“I got her, light it up,” he says, and then lets out a groan as Verna fights back for control.
“You feel that?” Dean asks, his own voice sounding strange in his ears in the near silence.
“Yeah, weirdest thing. I came to hours later and she’s lying there on the ground next to me, eyes rolled back in her head,” Paul’s voice stutters and he glances away from Dean and Cas. “Dead. They’re staying strangulation, even marks on her neck, but there’s no way --” His voice trails off, too choked up to continue.
Cas’ eyes track over Dean’s face and for a moment, Dean feels stripped raw, his breath caught in his throat in how Cas looks at him. “I’d love to learn.”
After an hour of searching, Cas finds something. He’s digging through one of the local antique store’s recent sale records, pulled from an online database Sam hacked a few months ago that greatly improved their sleuthing abilities. Farren Dent was the previous victim of the mirror ghost, and her family had sold most of her possessions to local stores when she died - including the lace-edged mirror. The mirror itself traced back to a founding family of Wind Point, the Jeffersons, whose last living member, the widow of old Mr. Johnson, committed suicide after learning about her husband’s torrid affairs from reading his journals after his death.
, setting it carefully on the player until it starts spinning and the first guitar strums drift out of the speaker. He sits on the couch, bottle in his hand dripping condensation onto his fingers. Cas settles next to him, as close as he dares, allowing their thighs to press close together. Miracle jumps onto Dean’s lap, spinning around until she finds a comfortable spot. She rests her nose on Cas’ thigh, looking up at him with particularly expressive puppy eyes.
Eventually, they tire, lips swollen and damp, and Dean presses his forehead against Cas’. They share breath and Cas bumps their noses together, turning his face so he can nuzzle against Dean’s cheek.
Cas reaches up and glides his thumb over Dean’s bottom lip, stilling Dean’s words. “Touch me, I want you to.”
Dean’s not sure how long they stay there, breathing together, watching the light slowly fade around them as the sun starts its descent towards the horizon.
“How’s your wound?” Cas asks, as a way to refocus, gesturing at Dean’s shoulder where the stitches zig-zag in a stark black line across his skin.
They make out for a while through the aftershocks, trading wet kisses, more tongue than lips, sharing breath and holding each other until the water starts to run lukewarm.
He looks over then and finds Dean strangely calm, face imperceptible. Somehow, that’s worse. He almost wants Dean to be mad at him for breaking the peace. “You’re not actually Dean and I don’t want any of this.”
There’s a motel a few blocks down from the diner, the Silver Spur, sporting a deep orange neon sign and a flashy fluorescent spur next to it. Dean leaves Cas in the car to doze while he goes to ask about a room.
The spray is extra hot on his skin, making it turn red. Around him steam rises, swirling up to the vent in the ceiling. Standing with his back to the spray, Cas allows the pressure of the water to ease the tension of the past day from his muscles. Earlier, when he woke up with Dean in his arms, Cas had realized his cock was half-hard and he was in danger of Dean very quickly figuring that out. He’d taken care of the issue with a surge of his grace, quelling his arousal and scooting back enough that Dean was none the wiser.
“No, I was supposed to meet Sally here at the house. We were going to drive to the restaurant together.”
“After what?” Mary asks.
Cas pops open an eye at him and frowns. “That means moving.”
Dean pats her once and lets his eyes slip shut.
Groaning deep in his throat, Cas tightens his grip and tugs Dean closer, licking open his mouth, greedy to taste as much of him as he’s allowed. Dean, clearly just as eager as Cas is, releases his hold on Cas’ hand and reaches up to grip his shoulder, fully climbing right into Cas’ lap. His arms move up and around Cas’ neck, getting comfortable, and then he claims Cas’ mouth in a heated kiss.
“Yes,” Cas answers, in a stuttered whisper.
He leans back in, smile widening, and bumps his nose against the side of Cas’ cheek before kissing him, short and sweet, on the mouth. “Not going anywhere.”
In the morning, when Dean heads down to the Impala,  he finds Cas already waiting for him. He looks a little worse for wear, eyes drooping and visibly tired. Considering he has what's left of his grace back, this isn’t a good sign. Dean’s tempted to put a stop to this whole hunt and send another pair of hunters on it right up until Cas claps a hand on Dean’s shoulder and asks with a small smile, “So what do we know?”
Leaving Milford and knowing Chuck was really gone, something felt different. Dean wanted to savor this temporary freedom for as long as he could. There was a chance that the next time Chuck showed up, they’d all end up dead.
“Got any plans for today?” Dean asks, halfway through his second stack of pancakes.
“Cas,” Dean says, voice cutting off mid-way through Cas’ name.
Falling angel or not, Cas is still susceptible to some creatures, Djinn being one of them, and if this one got the jump on Cas -- well, Dean doesn’t wanna think about it, not after they just started to patch things up between them post-Purgatory.
Dean checks the downstairs first, searching every room. Most rooms are empty, except for a few old cabinets with miniature yellowing dolls sitting neatly atop. Creepy dolls, man, the worst. On the second floor, the air seems too thin, and dust particles float around him like wayward gnats, highlighted in the glow of the sun.
Cas grins at this, looking back across at Dean, who responds with a small smile of his own. They’ve stopped walking.
Cas tries to tell himself that he’s not love with Dean. Has been trying for years. He understands how the line between friend and lover can blur, how it’s a tight distinction. How platonic love can often be mistaken for romantic. Cas is not deluded, though; he knows that despite the fact they are rarely physical with each other, this is a one-off occurrence because both needed comfort. That the night before, as it trickles back in dribs and drabs, smeared by intoxication and unconsciousness, was an intimacy that wasn’t entirely platonic, but nor was it sexual. It crossed lines. It had felt like two young children fumbling for understanding, for definitive answers.
“Change of pace, I suppose. And Claire. Jimmy and I are from the South; we both moved to the Midwest as teenagers, though.” He smiles, and Cas’s mouth distracts Dean. He tries not to imagine how many ways it could phrase ‘come back to mine’ in five languages. He’s so, so fucked. Between the way Cas’s foot  presses against his ankle, and the was the light plays across the sharp angles of Cas’s face, Dean wants to be home with him five minutes ago.
“I wasn’t,” Cas says, squinting at him. “This will be a long, tedious period of time for you if we don’t communicate, however. I’ve been watching over the earth for centuries. Time is a very different concept for me.” He gazes down at his hands before holding them in front of his face, studying them. “Granted, I’ve never had a physical body.”
Neither seems to clue on until Sam's pushing them both inside, key in hand.
“If I go in to the back room, will I find one of LAPD’s finest tied to a fucking dope crate, Lucifer? I know that’s a dirty shipment you have there. Why do you think the Alien Squad’d be so interested in you otherwise?”
Dean and Benny catch their six hours every night while Cas keeps vigil - a silent sentinel guarding his charge. Dean finds he needs more sleep in Purgatory without the constant stimulants he consumes back in the Real World. His mind is clearer than it has been in years, no longer fighting post-narcotic hazes or liquor-glazed realities. Everything is clean, pure; the air – despite the stench – is unpolluted. There is no technology to be preoccupied with, no deadlines to meet, no lives to save except for Cas and Benny and his own.
“They didn’t have any pie,” Cas says, by way of explanation. He tilts his head towards the shopping back on the counter. Inside appears to be a carton of half broken eggs, toilet paper, Dean’s favourite sort of beer, a packet of beef jerky and… is that a copy of
“There’s a cat? What?” Cas says, frowning as he pockets his phone. Claire rolls her eyes.
“So help me God,” he mutters. If Cas doesn’t wear fucking underwear… The belt slides out easily. Pants unzipped quickly. He has them halfway down Cas’s legs, trying to ignore the tighty whities, when he feels the strange sensation that he’s being watched; prickles against the back of his neck.
The next day, Dean drives himself and Cas to the nearest abandoned patch of open land he could convince Sam to find on Google Maps. He has a bunch of cans in the trunk he collects for stuff like this, and Cas has the box for the gun resting on his lap.
"You're staying in here until you two both sort... Whatever it is out," Sam mutters, rolling his eyes. "The unresolved tension - sexual and otherwise - is thick enough to cut with a fucking knife and I'm tired of it."
They lie entwined for a few minutes, breathing into each other, a snarl of body and sheet and skin caught against the cracked silhouette of dying time -
“Never mind,” Dean mutters. He feels Cas hum under his palms, which have worked their way to Cas’s back.
Written a few months back. It was the first fic I posted to tumblr, and was based on the beginning of an original piece I wrote.
Dean shakes his head. “Thanks, Doctor Shurley.” He turns to Benny. “It’s not really your usual domestic, though, is it? Husbands prefer blunt force trauma or a gun to slitting their wives throats. Messy.”
"Twelve fucking years," Cas murmurs into Dean's collarbone. His deep voice is rougher than usual - husky. Dean tries to stop the hysterical bubble of laughter that threatens its way up his throat. He almost can't believe it, that they’re actually here, in his bed, touching and groaning and going at it like teenagers. Can’t believe that they’re finally on the same page.
“It works both ways, though,” Cas continues. “We have to trust each other, to communicate. Uh, as you might say, ‘keep the lines open.’” He reaches out properly this time, grasping Dean’s face; a mirror of his action that day in the crypt. Except this time, they’re on equal footing. Dean isn’t broken and bleeding as a result of Cas, and there is no mind control, no angel tablet; instead they’re both sitting on a cold, hard floor in the middle of an ex-torture chamber, sharing body heat and words. “I need you, too,” Cas repeats. Dean fists his hand in to the folds of Cas’s coat, clutching Cas’s wrist, staring up at him. They remain like this for a few moments, leaning closer, breathing each other’s air, until –
Cas looks contemplative, his brow crinkling into small furrows as he squints at Dean. “I think I understand.”
Because Castiel didn’t just fight with Dean in Okinawa - he saved Dean’s life. And that’s not something Dean’s likely to forget in a hurry.
After the war, Dean hadn’t been able to deal with the fallout. He’d been sent back to America at the turn of the battle in the Pacific, arm in a sling, his praises sung as a hero as he was regaled with tales of victory in Europe and the coming victory over Japan. Germany had surrendered; it was only a short period of time before Japan did too.
"You'll be okay, Cas. You have to be," Dean says. "I need you."
Or an ex angel to disappoint, Dean thinks bitterly. This is his life; his choices. Is this who he wants to be?
The tension immediately leaks out of Dean, the taught lines of his shoulders melting to a slouch. He looks five years younger as he peers across at Cas, green eyes glinting in the soft light. “Promise me you won’t leave me again,” he says weakly. “I can’t keep losing people, Cas. I can’t.”
So Dean gets his fantasy in the end, curled up on the couch with Cas, mugs of hot chocolate and Dr. Sexy forgotten as they make out like teenagers. And, hey, maybe Christmas isn’t so bad after all.
Dean no longer knows how long he’s been here. Days have turned to weeks, weeks to months. Time doesn’t take definitive shape as they avoid leviathan and search for the portal and destroy anything that dares to cross their path.
“Woah there, Casanova,” Dean laughs.
“Dean,” the figure murmurs. The voice is familiar, but he can’t place it. “He’s awake; just give him a few moments.”
He hears more gunfire as he stumbles through the corridor, a little uneasy on his feet. There appears to be a body up ahead – his guard. The guy’s dead; blood pools under his chest. Dean mutters a quick apology before stealing the guy’s semi-automatic. He can smell more blood as he continues forward along the passage towards the noise.
Sort of porny but not really. It works here better in this collection than it would as a standalone. I won't tag for Dean/OC or Dean/Lisa because they're not what the piece is about - it's ultimately Dean/Cas.
His ears ring. He feels his gun sliding from its holster, hears the telltale click of the barrel being loaded despite the wash of blood against his eardrums. The hard, cold muzzle is pressed against the underside of his throat, burning his skin, and his hands are forced on to the grip. He can feel the cool leather of the assailant’s gloves on top of his hands. This is it. He served two years of service only to be taken down by a hard-boiled boxer in a dark Los Angeles alley.
"His name is Sebastian," Cas says proudly as Dean reaches the car. "And I don't care what you say; I'm keeping him. He can live in the bathtub." The light catches his eyes and his grin falls, serious expression replacing it. "I'll fight you for it, if I have to."
“How the fuck are you here, of all places? This must be happening in my head.”
“See, you didn’t even need my help.”
“But you’re gonna need mine,” she says, “particularly with an attitude like that.”
“He hit your head, hard,” Cas murmurs in to Dean’s neck, arm working its way across Dean’s back and under his arms. “I’ll check you over when we reach my place. You have nowhere else to be tonight?”
out loud. “But if I’m not beyond redemption, you can’t be, either.”
Dean tries not to gape. “Um. What brings you to Lawrence, and more specifically our office, then?”
Dean has the impulse, then, to grasp Cas’s hand in his. He doesn’t though. Instead he pinches the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger and massages gently. “I’m tryin’, Cas. I’ve started.” Dean doesn’t add
The coroner - Chuck - rises from his stoop near the victim’s head. “Not much, so far. Some partial footprints were found – I’ll try and cast a mold. She has rope burns on her wrist, suggesting her attacker tied her up, and she died as a result of the neck wound; her jugular was cleanly sliced through. I’ll do full tests once I get her back to the morgue. Do you have any questions?”
Cas rolls his eyes and presses the accelerator down easier this time. The Impala glides forward, slowly, riding across a sea of golden blades. The contrast of the light greens and bronze is gorgeous against the deep blue sky, fluffy clouds skimming across as the sun begins to sink below the horizon.
When Lisa gets home later that night, when it’s obviously too late for her to make it out to Venice where her mother lives, she sees the glasses sitting on the coffee table as she walks through to the kitchen.
“Sorry,” he says, sitting on the chair next to Benny’s. “I had trouble getting Ben to school this morning.” There was actually an argument with Lisa, because Dean had spent the night pacing the corridors of their house after his dream, unable to sleep, and Lisa was angry that he’d kept her and Ben awake.
"I beg your pardon?" she says, affronted, easing back on her roller chair to create distance between her and the slightly deranged looking man.
"Look, Dean..." Cas begins, moving in to Dean’s personal space.
‘I was here; where were you?’ flashes across Dean’s mind. He grimaces.
Dean comes first; his come spurts sticky and hot between their bodies, and he can’t help but cry out. Cas follows shortly thereafter, soundlessly, his face maintaining its controlled composure until he collapses against Dean’s chest. It takes a moment before Cas is easing out of Dean’s ass and looking at Dean like he might have the answers to all the questions in the universe.
Silence.
“What was that for?” he mumbles, lips sucked full and to a hue that is highlighted beautifully by the crimson squares of the shirt. Dean realises that he still has the collar of the flannel fisted between his palms.
“Mr. I’ll let you bang my gavel all night is now all Mr. Married.”
another 9x03 coda. i read a bit of meta on this ep - after i'd written this - that i might agree with more, but idk. this was my interpretation/way of explaining Jensen's strange acting choices in this scene. i'm getting lazy with chapter titles too. i'm sorry. all my ficlets get posted to my
“Stop, Cas,” Dean says, releasing Cas’s arms and walking ahead a few paces. “We need to talk. No more of this avoidance bullshit.”
“No,” he says. He locks his door.
“Work. He’s head of Trauma at Los Angeles County, so there’s probably our best bet.”
And this same flower that smiles today
Cas tries to protest, “But, the tablet-“ as Dean leaves the room. He ignore Cas’s cries in favour of walking down the hallway in to Sam’s room. Of course his bother is curled up on the bed, dental floss and the bottle of whiskey caught under his arm. Dean checks Sam’s temperature and spreads a blanket over his sleeping form.
Sam moves from the table to the floor beside Cas. “Do you know how to use a gun, Cas?”
The station is playing Christmas songs.
They move off to separate rooms and separate beds, the chasm between them more obvious than it has been in a long time, but Dean can’t help but mourn the concept of her and what their relationship represents just a little bit tonight.
, perfect pillar-box houses in perfect rows with perfect manicured lawns. Except the coroner’s pulling up and there’s a dead body at his feet and one of the few people he respected during the war might be guilty of first-degree murder.
