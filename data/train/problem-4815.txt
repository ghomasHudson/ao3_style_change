"Sir, you are right. This device is sending signals to something. Or someone, more precisely. I'm unable to trace anything else. " JARVIS spoke.
"You'll find the device, of course. Once it's location has been discovered. You, and Iron Man. It might be too dangerous for the rest of the team."
"My dear Iron Man, I have no clue how did this brother of mine escaped Asgard," his voice was full of anger, "I wish I were here when he attacked. Please tell me no one got hurt."
Tony was hurt, but that didn't scare him away from pursuing Steve. Everyone else had been more accepting of their relationship, which they had no intention of keeping secret. Bucky, Maria, Sarah, and even Peggy had been supportive. Howard hadn't talked to Steve and Tony ever since.
Dinner was great that night. They cooked together, ate, and laughed. His mother looked so young and healthy. Everything was perfect.
Steve pulled away and stared into Tony's eyes, seeing them filled with desire for him made him groan. He could feel Tony's erection pressed against his.
Before Steve could even move, there was a blast and the last thing he heard before his consciousness fell into bitch black was "Hail Hydra!"
Steve turned towards him, "Please, Tony, we don't have time for this. There's been no luck so far with the device, and.... "
"Ugh. That's not what I... " Tony rolled his eyes, "Forget it. Tell me something about yourself. Or, would you like to talk about the weather? I hate rain. Don't you? You don't, right? You like rain. That's why you're here and not in your bed thinking about your exes. Do you think there's going to be a rainbow today?"
"Yes, I'm fine," His voice was hoarse, "Give me a minute, please." He hurriedly walked away. Found the guests room and opened the door to the bathroom and looked himself in the mirror.
"Do you know who these people were?" Steve asked, feeling a strange sense of sadness. Bucky said he didn't know.
"We'll figure something out," Tony wasn't sure if he was trying to convince her or himself. "JARVIS, keep running the scans. See where the signals are going."
Nat and Steve exchanged a look. This was rather heartless at Fury's part but no one was in the mood for an argument. Natasha made sure the echoes of her steps did the talking for her as she strode towards Loki.
Steve laughed and pushed down the swell of fondness rising in his chest. Of all his friends, Tony had to be the most ridiculous, and that was saying something. He adored him though, even if he could be intense sometimes. It took a while, but like everyone else in their group, he learned how to enjoy the ride he was dragged along. The day where they lost track of time in the MET discussing art and politics throughout the different time periods, even dipping into Ancient Egypt for a bit there, was still one of his best memories.
However, it seemed that his flirting game was off. Any time he said something that would have been like a neon sign going ‘I AM FLIRTING WITH YOU DATE ME’, Steve ignored it. Or maybe he was being too subtle? Maybe he needed to do something raunchy? But maybe Steve wouldn’t appreciate that kind of flirting—especially at his workplace. Or, maybe Tony was setting himself up for some future heartbreak by wanting nothing more than to throw himself in Steve’s arms and kiss him senseless.
An hour later, they had bounced dozens of ideas and conversation topics around, talking about anything and everything under the sun in some random way that would confuse anyone listening in. But Tony was amazed by Peter’s brilliance, how he approached any topic with enthusiasm, how he was so, so curious—
“Good luck with your work,” he said politely, without attempting to take a peek at what he was doing, like he knew it was rude or was a paranoid pet peeve of his.
The guard they left him with didn’t seem too keen on monitoring his ‘progress’ or making sure he didn’t do something like break through their firewalls and dismantle their monitoring programs to work for him instead. There were at least ten other agents using Twitter and another twenty on Facebook. No one would care about one more, especially when he made it look like someone else’s computer was accessing the website.
“And now, we will take our leave,” Stephen said, guiding the two girls through one of his portals. “A little girl needs to be grounded.”
Tony waved a hand, stopping him. “Nah, I’m not that much of an asshole to make you work after you just finished cleaning up. Besides, that looks like a more important mess than my mission to evade sleep for as long as possible.”
Pulling up from the water fountain, Peter wiped his mouth. Listening to Ned talk and focusing on the coolness of the water helped. “Yeah, we’re probably going to be burning it and identifying the mineral salts that are making the colors. Maybe something with energy states.”
That caught Tony off guard. Then he thought. Steve had been acclimating and learning about the world he was now in, which included all of the conflicts that were still going on. He would have learned about how the Allies carved up the Middle East. How they pretty much crippled Germany once more. How Eastern Europe was still torn up. How there were still mines and bombs waiting in soccer fields. How there was still so much wrong with the world.
Pepper called. Rhodey called. Bruce even managed to call once, because he was out of the country on some retreat from society again.
“I take it this book was important to Peter?” the principal asked. Tony really needed to learn their name, it was only polite. But right now, he just wanted to comfort Peter.
Tony blinked and some clarity came to his eyes as he apparently registered the panic Steve was trying to hold back. “Oh. Shit. Steve, I’m sorry. I don’t know what I’m doing—I’m sorry if I said anything, I’ll just call for an ambulance or get Pepper—”
“Rhodey has already been informed,” Pepper continued. “He can’t make it back yet; he is deep in an op now. But he wants to punch some people’s faces in too.”
“You have artificial intelligence on your phone?” Steve seemed to be in absolute awe. Most people were, but Steve’s reaction seemed to be a little more genuine than other’s.
While Principal Fury only stared at him blankly and asked if his ‘criminal record’ was going to be a continued habit, Steve was careful not to get arrested anymore and to stay off of certain social media websites and forums, just in case. He got the itch to tell someone exactly why their ‘opinions’ were harmful for others and they were in the wrong with proper citations of various laws and easily verified historical incidents and court rulings a little too often. Because why add more hot-headed ranting when you could shut someone down with evidence and facts?
The wall of hands seemed to be the most important project, a community effort that they built upon throughout the ages. As he first observed, some of the hands were smaller than others, made when the person was a child or even an infant. He was not sure what the colors represented, but the tool used to apply the paint on the wall was simple and efficient. So long as someone could blow the paint out of the reed tube as another held their hand on the wall.
“That is how people perceive them now, because we’ve gotten used to people needing glasses. It would be wrong to ignore that you are nearsighted because it will cause long-term problems for you, like being unable to read small print. Having ADHD isn’t wrong either, but ignoring that you have it is wrong because it will hurt you in the long-run. Eventually, as people learn more about these conditions, they’ll be seen as normal too.”
Steve fixed him with a look. “Tony, you ranted at me about how a burger needed various components, one of them being lettuce, for twenty minutes. You would never change your burger order. Besides, you always hold out the one that’s meant for me.”
Her eyes started to water and her smile was just as wobbly as the tears threatening to spill over. “Oh, Tony. You don’t need to thank me.”
Tony raised an eyebrow, giving Sam a look. Sam raised his hands, trying hard not to grin. “Okay, I deserved that. I know you’re alright, Tony. The shovel talk is just tradition.”
He liked Italian food, appreciated trashy movies and novels, and was obsessed with coffee. Put a plate of food in front of him and he would eat it, simply because he appreciated food, even if it wasn’t something free-range, organic, non-genetically-modified gourmet. He liked puns and even if he didn’t get baseball, he still paid enough attention to figure out the statistics.
The floors and walls had stains from grease and what looked to be burns. One wall had some sort of metal grate system holding tools of all kinds: saws, hammers, wrenches. Multiple tables took up a majority of the place, strewn about at different angles and distances from one another. There was hardly an empty surface: books of different sizes and thicknesses were in haphazard stacks, tools and discarded work gloves were in messy piles, clamps and hammers hung off of edges, there were mountains of unlabeled containers holding only God knew what, and …
Tony shook his head and dragged another blanket over both of them. “Nah, we’ll wait until this passes. For now, I just want to … I don’t know, pamper the hell out of you and make you feel better.”
“Sure, like someone would want an omega with all my medical problems to carry their children,” Steve snapped back. “Like I could even carry an alpha back to my place!”
Steve chuckled and settled down, hoping that like he had seen with real dogs, his weight and presence in this form would help ease Peter’s anxiety some.
Tony rolled his eyes and snuggled further into him on the couch, enjoying the arm Steve had wrapped around his waist. “Don’t worry, there’s still fifty years of pop culture I can educate you on.”
“I like working,” Steve said, a flush growing on his cheeks. “I like making myself useful. I’m currently setting up a scholarship for other art students with my back pay. There’s … a lot. I could make ten scholarships and still have funds to pull the shop out of the red if needed.”
“Oh, Petey,” Tony murmured. He motioned for Peter to come over and hugged him once he did. “It’s alright. Like I said, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. But I want to focus on you. I’ve been dealing with how my brain works for literal decades. It’s normal for me. You’re still adjusting and are getting the help you need.”
“Yes, he was. Why are you thinking he has ADHD? Maybe he’s just having trouble adjusting to middle school. Sometimes that happens. He’s only a sixth grader!”
He hoped that his dad had private tutors who were sympathetic or were willing to try different learning techniques or something. Peter wouldn’t wish his experiences on anyone.
Gods, if it weren’t for Tony, none of this would have been possible. On the day Schmidt attacked, it had been completely unexpected. Some nobles immediately pointed fingers to Tony and others that were closest to Steve, but he knew Tony. He would never endanger their people, let alone allow a madman like Schmidt to run amok and take over. But they had been caught unprepared, unaware. It was all Steve could do to convince Schmidt to keep him as a prisoner and distract him long enough that Tony could get everyone he could out alive.
“Alright. How about you jump into the shower? We got some food being delivered. Getting clean will probably help.”
“You—you’re bruising like a peach! I can’t have—! Come on, my place isn’t too far from here and I got a bit of a kit.”
if they couldn’t prevent kids from knowing what it was like to be harassed or belittled or beaten up or ostracized? What happened to creating the maybe
“Antonius,” Stiofán repeated, with a brilliant smile. Then, he said something Antonius did not understand, but it was said with such warmth, he knew it was a welcome.
That was when Steve noticed Pepper was wearing a new necklace: along the chain were small petals surrounded in clear resin. He immediately recognized the ranunculus and marigold petals belonging to Tony and Rhodey. It was a common thing to have, jewelry or trinkets with flower petals from loved ones. Bucky had a few charms from his sisters. He had a ring that his father had given his mother where their petals (black popular and bluebells) were inlaid in resin.
The man rolled his eyes and went behind him, using a blade to cut the zip ties. Tony rotated and rubbed his wrists, careful not to move too much. The guy looked like he could snap him in two.
They chatted a bit more over the shared experience of coughing up petals for loved ones, in all the forms that love came in, before parting to their respective tasks again.
She shook her head, giving him a soft look. “It’s okay. I know you’re not okay, though. What can I do to help?”
Steve leaned over to look at the screen. Tony thumbed through a few of the scans to show some of what JARVIS had highlighted.
The older of the two girls scowled. “Excuse me, but I went through the proper channels and reported all of this as soon as I found out.”
“It’s one of our tea blends,” The Gift From God said. “Green tea is the base, but there’s chamomile and lavender added to it. We usually put in some honey too.”
“You’re Peter’s father?” someone else exclaimed, jumping up from one of the chairs that lined a wall. “I should have known!”
Anyone worth their salt could reasonably control themselves through heats or ruts. The symptoms, even the most common ones, could vary wildly, as did what their instincts insisted they do. Clint, a friend of Natasha’s, needed to make a ‘nest’ somewhere up high. Since he couldn’t attach it to a ceiling, he settled for making a pillow fort on the terrace of his apartment. Bucky often felt cooped up and like he would burst out of his skin, so he went to some of the more remote hiking trails for a few hours.
Then Tony sent him a message about how Anish Kapoor didn’t deserve to be called an artist for his elitist views and should he send some money to this other guy who was making pigments for free in protest?
On the way to May and Ben’s house, Tony heard a ping and brought his phone out—as he had hoped, it was the message from Mr. Rogers giving him the contact information to the paraprofessionals and his own contact information and office hours. He put it away without answering it. JARVIS would remind him on Monday morning. For now, he wanted to get his son smiling again and not worrying so much about the latest curveball life had thrown him.
Tony noticed how Mr. Rogers still looked disheveled, like the altercation lasted much longer than it should have. He wondered how much this ‘Flash’ kid struggled to keep fighting, because Peter didn’t have a mean bone in his body and he
Many of the parents and students clapped afterwards, with Tony clapping the hardest. His heart was bursting with absolute pride, chest swelling and everything. Peter had worked so hard on this project for the last week and his efforts absolutely showed. There was absolutely no sign of his nightly panicking and the shaking of his hands as he held his cue cards was minimal.
“You’ll figure out how to tell your pops,” Steve encouraged. “It’s not like you signed a contract when you were born or something. Maybe you could compromise? Find someone who would be a better CEO and you become the head of the R&D department when that guy steps down. Buy some more stock or whatever, if it will put your pops at ease.”
Peperi nodded and explained how they went to see the oracle. They initially had wanted to know if the gods would help them fight against Ovadyah, but the oracle insisted it was not their place to do that; justice would come in other ways. There were other peoples, the oracle warned, peoples who would come and take and take. Their island would not be safe. No land would be safe once the empire of the seven hills rose up. Antonius felt sick. There were stories about such peoples, those who made arms for the sole purpose of conquering others.
Captain America looked like he was going to say something more when the sniper put his hand on his shoulder. “Come on, we need to keep moving.”
Peter knew he was an easy target for students with a perchance for picking on others. He was short, scrawny, didn’t do well with physical activities, and tended to be more emotional than other boys his age. Not that there was anything wrong with that—he was fully aware what toxic masculinity was and he did not want anything to do with it. He would happily remain ‘scrawny’ and ‘weak’ if it meant that he wasn’t going around hurting people.
Steve was quiet for a moment, but more contemplative than shocked. “I felt awful. Everything bothered me until it got to the point where it was almost painful. So I … I don’t know what I did. I didn’t kill anyone, did I?”
“You. Me. Hallway. Now. MJ, please keep an eye on the class. We shouldn’t be more than a few minutes. I expect all of you to continue your assignments as you were.”
Antonius watched as Stiofán created the pigments that he would later use on the cave walls. He had a flat stone on which he would put the raw materials and he would grind it with another stone until they were a smooth powder. He would then take a deep bowl and mix the powder with water, letting it sit for hours until everything had settled. Then he would only take the water—which was now colored—and let that dry to grind it once more. Sometimes he repeated the process two or three more times to get a fine paint.
, not incidents you caused by making poor decisions! If you actually brought any of this to them, they would tell you to settle, because who in their right mind would sue a teacher for actually
The sniper threw the grenade back where it came from and Captain America leaped in front, using his shield to block off some of that blast. Going back wasn’t an option. Tony could feel the heat of the explosions and the rumble of walls falling down. This entire floor was probably structurally compromised and given that they were in a corner, they were trapped.
“Cappuccino,” Tony said, because hopefully, no one could mess that order up. “Hey, you got the same accent as the other guy!”
And I have never been to the Bank of America Plaza in Dallas, but we have driven past that thing a few times, and man does it reflect the sun’s light like no one’s business. Ouch.
Buk listened in confusion, not knowing the language they spoke in. Others of the clan were now coming around, curious and bewildered.
“Bruce here is one of the foremost experts of gamma radiation, biochemistry, and nuclear physics! He’s a genius! Have some respect!”
After years of Captain America being used to emotionally beat him up? After years of thinking his childhood hero would hate him if they ever met? After years of being taught that there would be nothing but disapproval and rejection?
It took some time to board off of the plane, go through security, and wait for their baggage, but finally,
Later that week, Steve coughed up a few spider flowers and was soon told that Peter had passed his exam with flying colors. As if there was any doubt, textbook or not.
“Kiddo, I got lawyers. The best lawyers. If you want me to, I can have this kid shipped to Siberia before he could even blink. Now, don’t even try to protest. You do not deserve to be bullied for any reason. Not your name, not your looks or your clothes or hobbies. Nothing. You are too young to want to try to be all tough and independent. You’re
Steve laughed. “Yeah. I’m just glad Pepper has the resources to coordinate it all. I have no idea how business majors do it.”
After that, she hangs up and Tony lets out a long breath. She’s right, though. He starts up the engine again and moves the car up on the road.
Peter shakes his head, his arms crossed over his legs while he stares ahead of himself. His expression is unbelieving, surely he’s thinking Tony’s just messing with him. Tony just wishes that’s true, but he figures he should have just told him much earlier.
“If he asks after it specifically,” Peter returns. “He’s otherwise engaged, right now. He won’t be asking.”
Now, New York traffic isn’t at all made for a car chase. While Ned seems to find all the thrilling, exciting aspects of this whole business, Peter is fearing for his life with his phone pressed between his ear and shoulder as he dodges a bus. He’s breaking countless of traffic laws, but it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t even matter to him if he’s going to be in trouble again after this. He’ll sign those damn accords, for what it matters. He just needs to stop this guy, once and for all.
big a deal?” Clint gets up from his seat, his hands balled into fists. “You talked about your sex-life
Natasha laughs at that boyish innocence she hopes Peter will never lose. Those big brown eyes look so confused, begging for help. The exact opposite of how Stark’s eyes have ever been.
Granted, at first she simply thought he was struggling with something else. He kept on sneaking out of the house, being awkward next to her and keeping things from her. In her shame, she thought he was just afraid to admit something to her. Multiple thoughts occurred to her, one of them being that he might have been gay all along.
Before Yaël could turn around to sprint away, she got sucked into it immediately closing her eyes as the light was too bright. Maybe this was what dying looked like. Once she dared to open her eyes again, she noticed she was flying through space. Bright colors were surrounding her, seemingly coming out from nowhere. But she didn’t have the time to really look around as she suddenly, as quick as she got sucked into the beam, got spit out again. Yaël screamed while falling down a few metres, and as she crashed against what looked like a pile of iron garbage she blacked out by the shock.
There’s been discussion on going to New Asgard for a while now. Peter’s rather excited on going, wanting to see it all with his own two eyes. Apparently, there’s a little stand somewhere where they’ve put the remains of Mjölnir for the people to observe, and still nobody can pick up the pieces. Peter really wants to see that!
The paint running down surely didn’t make her look more sympathetic, it dripped on the floor behind the king. X grabbed her hand “Don’t let go of reality,” he whispered to her, forcing her to focus on him for a second. After that, the painting stopped melting for a while, but X didn’t let go anymore.
’, but then he thinks better of it. Harry’s still at the Compound, stuck in strong therapy with all the possible doctors Tony could find on the subject.
“Listen, when he gets back in New York, just talk to him, alright?” Peter suggests. Tony shrugs, reaching out a hand and taking five of the waffles Peter is carrying along. Then he offers him a light smile.
“That’s worth it,” Tony jokes, earning him a slap on the shoulder. Meanwhile, Natasha and Hilde are still going. Clint keeps on spinning, though he’s becoming less and less understandable.
“You hated the song with every fiber in your heart right up until that dance,” Steve sighs out happily with a small smile on his lips.
“Yes, they intend to find a way to regenerate certain body parts, hence Curt’s interests in the matter.”
Their evening goes like this most of the time. After getting their orders, they dive into conversation. Steve finds out more about Tony’s time with the Jarvis’, and Steve, in turn, tells Tony about his adventures with Bucky. Most of their adventures end up with the two of them, hanging out on this very spot. It intrigues Tony, giving him chills at the idea that he gets to know so many things about Steve.
“I mean I got the best gaydar in this entire school, and I can tell you right here that our beloved Captain America doesn’t swing for your team,” the boy sitting at that table says. From the way he’s speaking, Peter quickly figures out that he probably knows what he’s talking about.
How can it even be possible? Peter in no way has any sort of attraction towards Johnny. Even now, thinking about the kiss, he can’t even understand why he was so into it back then. Could it be the alcohol? Could it be because he was tired?
FRIDAY answers shortly. Then Tony pulls his glasses back down on his nose, and sticks his attention on the images on the screen. There he can see FRIDAY working her magic as the footage appears in front of him.
“No way! We’ll find it one way or another!” Clint says, smashing his fist on the table. “And I know exactly who to ask!”
He should have ran to him, find out if he’s alright. But he doesn’t care at all. Eddie’s a jerk, and he deserves the nose-bleed he’s now sporting. A couple of the other students stare at him in surprise, probably wondering how the scrawny, nerdy kid could have landed such a shot. Peter ignores them, instead moving to the left, picking up another bottle and downing it in one go. After that he throws it on the floor and runs out of the room.
Once again, Peter lies on his back, looking at the sky above him. His hands are under his head, Karen reading aloud a mail he’s received from Harry.
Somehow, during the movie, they’ve shifted on the couch until Peter is lying with his head on Tony’s lap, eyes closed as he’s falling asleep. He’s only vaguely aware of Tony’s fingers going through his hair, or Steve gently picking him up from the couch to bring him to the bedroom he actually still hasn’t seen.
It’s somewhere after the first episode that their hands finally find each other again. Fingers tangled together, Tony allows himself to lower his head until it’s resting on Steve’s shoulder. Neither of them speak about it. And eventually, Tony’s eyes start closing and he’s slumbering away. He’s only barely aware of Steve putting him in the bed in a comfortable position and kissing him on the cheek before turning off the TV and joining him in sleep.
“I suggest we return home, then?” he offers. Hope nods, throwing her cards down to finish the game. She, too, stands up and grabs her coat from her chair.
Steve doesn’t say anything else, and Peter’s feeling a bit too unnerved to go and find Tony immediately. If he goes in this state, they might start shouting against each other again, and that’s not something Peter wants. Instead, the two of them sit in front of the TV and watch the news. There’s a coverage on New Asgard, something about the people of Norway responding to the sudden appearance of a whole civilization right next to them. Some are excited, while others are rather scared.
“Ah, you know, learning that the first woman you’ve ever loved died years ago without you ever knowing might sting a bit,” Tony says dryly. He just wants to get up and get a drink, but clearly that won’t be possible with the last bottle lying on the ground. At least his subconscious helped him stay away from the booze again.
“Inside, but I think Wade is causing a deicide there…” Steve snorted, unzipped his jacket and hung it over her shoulders. He signed her to follow him and so she did.
Tony remembers all too well how that woman almost literally kicked his ass back at that café. Without his own armor to protect him, he’d been sure he was done for. Still, he can’t believe he actually made it out of that mess.
“Urgh, Steve, stop,” Tony mutters when Steve starts pressing kisses on his belly, getting too low for Tony’s comfort. The super soldier immediately looks up, scared for what could be the reason for him to call it quits.
Without any interruption, the four of them sit together. They talk, joke, and even start up a few games of cards. It’s all fun, and Peter hasn’t felt better than this in the past few weeks, feeling like he’s complete again. But he knows it won’t last; things aren’t the same, and soon enough they’ll be called away again.
That’s about an hour ago now, and even Steve’s calm, steady breathing doesn’t seem to help Tony fall into the same slumber. Letting out another sigh, Tony turns to get his tablet from the nightstand. If he can’t work in the workshop, he can put together some formulas back here.
“Alright, good night, Dad.” With that, the teenager turns around and heads back to his room. Tony, in the meantime, lets out another deep sigh before walking towards the balcony. The moment he’s outside, he realizes how chilly it’s become in the evening. Summer’s over, that’s clear enough. Still, not bothering to get back inside and grab his coat, Tony walks up to the railing and looks down at the city underneath him.
That’s a decision Nick made. I think he sort of wanted to test you, see what you are worth without anyone around you to influence you. Maybe he wanted to see your true colors.
Peter decides not to stick around in the room too much. It’s not really polite of him, after all. He closes the door again behind him, figuring that Johnny might just have gone to school or something. Crap, Peter forgot he has classes as well.
“You know what? I’m leaving. I don’t need this shit.” Peter gets up from where he was sitting, his hot coco completely forgotten as he starts his way back to his room.
Then, much to Peter’s surprise, the mutant starts laughing. His hand comes to his stomach and he leans his head back while there are laughing lines showing around his eyes. Peter wants to know what could possibly be so funny right now, but he doesn’t dare ask, instead just looking back out of the window and seeing Wade still lying there. Though this time it looks like his left leg is already healed back in place. Now the rest…
The moment he nears the man, he looks over his shoulder to take a look at the drawing. It’s not bad at all. The man is using aquarel, and though he’s only just started (it’s only five past three), the garden is already pretty recognizable.
It took Yaël a complete hour to make a being from the stones she had gathered. A single drip of sweat rolled from her forehead. With her hands in her side, she looked at her creation, which was rigidly copying her movements. It didn’t move smoothly enough, she would never be able to steer it from her subconsciousness this way, let alone use it fluently. A sigh escaped from her lips, her back hurt, her heart raced like a furious hummingbird and her stomach ached in a very unpleasant way.
Mary hesitates for a moment before she nods. Then she hands the materials to Tony. The needle has already been put into the holder, and about five vials are put at the ready. There’s some disinfectant wipes she rubs over her arm after she pokes around for a vein. With the help of the band she seems to find one that must be good enough.
Steve’s heart is beating, faster than it should be. Tony’s on the floor? There’s blood? Was there a fight in the tower? Steve gets out of bed to check his computer, see if there’s anything about an attack on the news.
“Tony, are you listening?” the familiar voice of Steve Rogers asks, and Tony then opens his eyes to look straight into the Captain’s blue ones. There are hands slapping his face to wake him up; do those belong to Cap? Or is there someone else here? What’s going on?
That information seems to be new to Mary, which makes it all the more clear that she couldn’t have known on her own. Somebody had to tell her; somebody who was aware of the situation.
“I’m so sorry, Peter. Steve… it was all my fault,” Tony admits. Peter doesn’t answer. But what can he say?
With his food in hands, the first thing he comes across is somebody stealing a bike. He deals with the thief easy enough, but finding the owner of the bike proves to be harder than he thought.
It was in that room at medical, Tony sitting up in bed, Peter next to him, the three of them looking at the Arc Reactor that Peter put together. It was that pride that Steve found in Tony’s face that made him realize it.
“In case you hadn’t noticed from what I told earlier, I was kind of bleeding to death on my way back,” Peter reminds him, and Ned’s mouth falls open in sudden realization before turning back around to look at the remaining kids on the field. When Michelle comes to sit by them, she doesn’t pay any attention to anybody, instead just scrolling down on her phone.
Peter pulls him up, taking the cup and putting it back on the table. Then he grabs Tony’s jacket from his chair, and pulls him along on his way out of the workshop.
Anyway, after a short moment of being accused as a stalker and lots of talk about a certain McDreamy dying in that one show Aunt May loves to watch after a short greeting in pajamas, Peter and Yaël make their way out of her crappy small apartment. And Peter feels like he has the right to say that it’s crappy, because the paint is chipping off the walls and he’s sure there’s something smelling like a dead mouse somewhere behind the sink. He’s not sure if he should tell her, though.
There’s a sadness in her eyes that Peter can’t place, and for a moment, he wonders if he should just ask her about it, but instead remaining quiet. He leans back on the couch then, in his mind already making up that he’s going home when the clock get to eleven, which is only about fifteen minutes more.
The kid points to somewhere behind him, where a group of homeless people are standing in line for something. “That girl is here again to hand out soup. It’s welcome, too, because it’s rather cold today.”
The team is falling apart. Barnes has escaped, and Steve and Sam have disappeared along with him. Tony is there with Nat, trying to burn out their fires, while Rhodey is out in the sky in search of the three fugitives.
“You know, being up there, bound and almost completely at the mercy of that bad guy? I guess I realized some things.”
“Wait, what are you doing?!” the old man panicked as the freezing reached his fingers and made them unmovable. It happened so quick that they didn’t even had the chance to handle against it. Once they were fully frozen and unable to move, Yaël tapped some left over, unfrozen, fluid from one of the guards body and used it to freeze her chains. But she didn’t have enough time as others had heard weird noises and came to check on what was happening.
Tony stays quiet then, and Peter dares to look up, seeing the man with his head turned to the side, eyes locked on the ground. There’s something in his expression that shows pain, in a way. After a few seconds of silence and long breathing, he speaks up again.
Peter hums out in confusion, wondering why his father would have those kinds of nightmares? Peter’s fine, isn’t he? There has never been any indication that he’s in danger! He can take care of himself!
“Ahh,” Tony gets out, turning his head to the side. The sensation is so much. “We can’t make too much noise, Peter-“
“Exactly!” Tony says, walking out of the hallway just as he speaks. He’s holding up a half-empty cup of coffee, and comes to stand still in front of Peter with an eyebrow raised. “Now, how many times has that been this month?”
“So, you’re finally talking to your daddy? Sounds amazing!” Wade says, unworried about it all. Without warning, he starts up the car and starts driving. In the first five seconds, he already manages to break five traffic laws. He’s going to fast, sometimes ends up driving on the left side of the road, and doesn’t let passengers cross the road. He’s gotten through three red lights, smashed a hot dog stand, and ended up having five police-cars behind him. It takes them twenty freaking minutes to get there, due to Wade wanting to get the cops off his track.
The person doesn’t answer. Tony doesn’t need his voice to know who it is. He smiles, and holds out his hand. The person waits a few seconds but then comes closer. His hand is outstretched as well, fingers touching Tony’s, giving him warm chills all over his body.
“NO! I can do this!” she huffed, followed by some curse words after she bumped her bad hand against the wall.
Tony sighs, leaning against the wall and throwing his head back. He knows that, in all those movies, people refuse to leave the room, to stay with their child and make sure that they’re alright. But Tony just can’t right now. There’s too much happening in there, more than his brain can handle right now. Too many possible nightmares in that room.
“Where- uh where am I?” the man asks in confusion while rubbing his eyes. He hisses a bit when he accidentally pushes a stone inside instead.
Tony decides to wait. Letting the suit surround him again, he gets back into the air. He could just search out Strange, see if he can talk to him already. Then, after fixing this universe – he can’t leave it the way it is right now – Tony will ask Strange to send him back. If he can, that is… If not… he needs to build something.
“You really need to watch your language, otherwise Steve will wash your mouth with soap,” he jokes. While Tony freezes on the spot, Rhodey just bursts out laughing.
“Please don’t attack me with fire, miss, that doesn’t really work on a rock,” Korg said while staring at the flames that were licking Yaël’s fingers. “Miek, on the other hand, is kind of sensitive to it.”
Tony points at the official piece of paper that he kept on the table, knowing that either Steve hadn’t noticed it before, or just simply didn’t care about it. All he gets is a pensive thought from Steve, who then lowers his head.
There are some more tests over the next few days. The doctors are quick in realizing his new liver is fast in stabilizing itself again. As a regenerating organ, one would expect it to take a while for it to get to a good size that would be considered normal. As it is, it’s only after three days that they come up with the CT that shows him a picture of a seemingly three-month-old transplanted liver.
But as he sits here, he feels a bit of sadness inside of him. Wasn’t he going to come here with Tony, Steve and Bruce after Octavius’ presentation? What even happened to the guy? Last night he was still in the hospital, but he hasn’t really looked him up again after this.
“Let’s just go home, alright?” he offers. He’s not in the mood to talk about this right now. Probably never. But it’s alright, he thinks. Steve might not want kids, but they already have the best son in the world. He guesses he’s pretty lucky already.
“Okay, you two: leave. I need to focus.” The fire went back to the bunch of candles Yaël had lit for her training and the water simply streamed back into a bucket Yaël had filled, until the two ‘persons’ were completely gone. Using candles and buckets of water made sure that Yaël wasn’t obliged to dehydrate or push herself into a hypothermic attack. But yet, training to push herself as far as she could by making the elements come from her own body, was written on her bucket list too.
Peter doesn’t need to be told twice. He gets his breakfast in with hurried bites, and then runs to the room to get some clothes on. The attempt to tame his bedridden hair is hopeless, so with curls going all the way Peter appears back at the living room, holding up his arms to the side when he gets an unimpressed look from his Aunt.
” Harry asks, sounding happy the moment he picks up. Peter smiles lightly but it disappears again immediately. He clears his throat, suddenly feeling guilty that he’s not just calling to have a nice chat.
Luckily, they haven’t suggested a sleep-over already. Peter’s not sure he’s ready for that just yet.
Without warning the pilot, he drops his finger down on the button, immediately feeling his latest suit surround him in his safe Iron Man cocoon. When he’s dropped into the air, he doesn’t feel cold. The drops don’t touch his skin, and his sight is not filled with little wet lines.
“What did I do?” Tony asks. Steve just rolls his eyes, getting into the elevator that will bring them down. Tony doesn’t get an answer, but he doesn’t go looking for it. In all honesty, he’s feeling a bit nervous about who he’s going to come across. Given the reaction of the other Avengers, he doesn’t really think he’s very loved in here.
Yaël thought she could feel the bacteria move into her wounds. Hours were passed after the tournament, heck, it was even night already, but nobody went by to patch up her wounds. She’d do it herself if her cell didn’t only have a metal plank that served as a bed and a metal bowl that served as a toilet. Ripping off a piece of her clothes wouldn’t have helped either, as the fabric was stained with blood and dirt.
Sadly, that is not granted to him. His eyes fly open when a cold shudder is going through him again – the Spider-sense! – and before he knows it, he’ll pulled up into the air again.
Finding an app which allows him to build some inventions together through holograms, Peter constructs himself some sort of spider-drone. He adds a lot in it; facial recognition camera’s, enhanced auditory senses that signals towards the original source of power, flight and crawl-mode, and even some electrical charges which would allow minimal self-defense. He thinks he finishes it rather quickly, but when he looks up again he finds that it’s already half past ten, and Tony is sitting on the couch next to him, also with a tablet in his hands.
Yeah, Tony’s not really one to take pictures like this, but on this instant, he wouldn’t mind the reminder of it.
There’s a meeting. Tony would have thought that, by now, they would have gotten to the part where this wouldn’t be necessary, but yet here they are.
“If that goddamn suit is going to be the reason I’m not getting laid tonight, I’m going to be extremely pissed,” Tony grunts out, only barely avoiding Peter jumping back on him. Tony rolls forward on the ground, jumping into the air and hovering for a bit while he takes in the room.
Yaël looked at Peter in the corner of her eyes. He looked quite happy for someone who got almost beaten to death a few days ago. But then again, she wouldn’t feel any different in his place.
Somewhere Yaël knew he didn’t wanted this to happen, but at this moment, she could only believe he hated her guts enough to disgrace her in this way.
“I hate it,” he mumbles. “I hate it when he goes out in the evening like that with no back-up or anything.”
He goes home after that, and by the time he returns next Monday, he notices that the clock has been removed, replaced by a digital one. On his desk lying one little note.
Then Tony heads out again, not able to stay here for much longer. He makes his way back to the front door, but right when he wants to open it again, Natasha stops him by putting a hand on his arm.
Johnny stays quiet for a moment. Long enough for Peter to pause the game and look behind him, where he sees Johnny looking doubtful, with furrowed eyebrows and a scowl on his face.
Peter’s lying on the ground  in the middle of the airport, his mask slightly lifted from his face so he can catch his breath. Things are crap. Shit. It’s all fucked up, and now here he is, a pulsing ache in his head and his whole body about ready for him to fall asleep.
“You want me to sing Edith Piaf for you?” Steve smiled widely at her for remembering his taste in music. “Steve, dear,” Yaël said as she grabbed his hand and put her other one on his shoulder. He automatically put his hand on her back “We need to practice for that special dance for when you get married to that asshole. Since you don’t have a mother to dance with, you’ll have to do it with me.”
He could have been sitting there for an hour; he wouldn’t be able to tell it. He doesn’t notice the call that comes through. His mind clears a little bit when suddenly something cold is pressed against his face.
“Say, doesn’t your brother have bodyguards or something?” Peter asks Shuri then when he realizes the two women who were with the King before now aren’t there. Shuri nods and points towards a food stall. There, two women in everyday clothing are seated eating some rice from the Chinese stand, with their eyes stuck on the king with occasionally a look at Shuri.
After he’s alone in his room again he decides to get out of bed for a moment. Just because the scar is healing faster than it should be doesn’t mean that it still isn’t hurting. He groans when he pushes himself upright. When they were alone, before the nurse came by, Dr. Cho told him that his healing process reminds her a bit of Peter’s after the Goblin’s attack. Of course, she couldn’t compare it completely since, once again, Peter’s had a full dose of venom and Tony just has a small bit of it.
“A week from now,” Steve says. “The guys were going to lure you and Peter out there with the false story of another mission, but I don’t really want to keep you in the dark. Besides, Rhodey and Bruce don’t know about it yet, either.”
Harry surprises him the next day when he suddenly shows up for school. Peter, who’d expect his day to be going pretty slowly as ever, just heads to his locker, meets up with Ned, and starts walking towards his first class with his friend in tow.
“Thank you,” Mr. Stark returns, before shaking his head. Peter bites his lip a bit harder, trying to look everywhere but at the man in front of him – his
“You would like that, wouldn’t you?” Steve got in return, and Steve felt his cheeks warm up once again. He cleared his throat, and cast his eyes away, suddenly noticing something on the nightstand next to the bed.
He shouts, fights as much as he can. The moment his head is free, Hope is there by his side putting the same pair of headphones on his head as well. It’s an instant relief, his head coming to rest despite the remaining ringing in his ears. That’s going to take a while to get better, Peter understands.
“You know what? I’ll carry my own stuff,” the girl then says, throwing her grappling hook towards the box and pulling it up as if she’s wearing it like a backpack. Right when Peter moves up to stop her, her foot lands into his stomach, throwing him back into a blackboard. A few papers fall down to the ground.
Gestures like giving up your vacation through Europe and coming back to New York to just hang out with your best friend. Peter hates himself for neglecting his friendship with Harry lately. And Ned. The poor guy, he’s probably working his ass off at MIT to be the best of the class, and Peter can’t even think about picking up the phone.
Peter never texted back. He did excuse himself for the week after, but next to that one text, Yaël didn’t hear anything from him. That was until Wanda and Wade were one day hanging around in her apartment after they helped her move back in.
“He doesn’t mind,” he assures him, though Peter is aware that neither of them knows what Steve would think of that. Peter decides not to bring it up again, instead moving until he’s seated next to Tony and looking at the man’s tablet screen as well. It seems like Tony is working on something, as well.
the dining room. One wall contains nothing more than windows, giving another wonderful view of New York. One window, Peter knows, is actually a door that leads to the landing platform for the Iron Man suit.
“Whew, that was a close one, Cap,” Peter jokes, pretending to wipe away sweat from his face. The Captain just shakes his head and exhales the breath he had been holding.
People start shouting when the girls come up on the stage. Tony has enough time to take off the pants and the hoodie, pulling up the hood of his own uniform before jumping out from behind the screen on his cue.
It’s good that he asked for Rhodey to come here. He doesn’t really know how else he would have dealt with this. He can barely even hold himself in right now.
He doesn’t expect another figure to show up, then. It’s a dark blur, nearly-white hair catching the attention immediately. Peter jumps to the side right before colliding with her, eyes wide as he takes in Felicia standing in front of him. She’s once again in her suit – though a fixed one. Her mask is back on her face, and on her belt she seems to have multiple gadgets she normally doesn’t carry.
“I’m not sorry. We could have lost you,” Mr. Stark says. “I’m glad FRIDAY gave them, just like I’m glad that you’re still here with us, son.”
EDIT: This timestamp will no longer be relevant to the story, as we have decided to follow more of the aspects of Infinity War when we write that part out. Despite that, we'll leave this one up on the timestamps, as some sort of 'alternate universe', perhaps! :-)
“What’ going on?” Wanda asks curiously. Sam’s door opens as well now, and so does Clint’s. Why is everybody such a light sleeper?
The crowd goes wild. The door opens, and after throwing another short glance backwards to meet his son’s eyes, Tony starts running onto the stage. The lights are blinding, but to be fair it’s nothing he’s not used to. Holding the microphone he got earlier into his hand, he keeps his hands up in the air, throwing his signature peace-sign while grinning widely.
“Steve tried everything he could to be here,” he assures him, squeezing his shoulder for a bit. Tony, finally, moves, reaching out for Sam’s shoulder as well. Mirroring the movement, the two give each other a long, calm look before they turn back to the others. Tony opens his mouth to speak up, but suddenly Clint interrupts him.
What he got to see now where about three, maybe four weeks of content. Video images of things he doesn’t remember happening, of his other self going out in the streets and protecting them from evil, only not always in the best way.
Ned tries to be kind, not asking questions about what happened and respecting their privacy. Michelle doesn’t even seem to care about it. It’s mostly the others that are being annoying as ever. The people that have never talked to him before suddenly come up to him, holding up a newspaper or their cellphone and asking for clarification.
“No, but when can I go home? I haven’t been in my workshop for weeks!” he sighs. “I like to keep myself busy. My bots are probably missing me!”
“And that friend of yours? You said she’s been living with the Avengers now? How’s that working out?”
“I can bring you along as a potential Avenger, introduce you to the team, to Fury… And then we can look for the files you’re looking for, I’m sure they’re not too hard to find.”
“I saw that your grades have been… a bit on the low side. Is there any particular reason for this?” Tony asks, feeling almost like a therapist. Of course, he needs to know if the kid’s just lazy, or if there has been something that happened. He knows it’s the latter when he sees the boy grit his teeth together and lower his gaze back to the ground.
“I know who you are,” Peter responds, but accepting the handshake. “Mr. Stark told me to stay away from you.”
“Tony enforced it with some of the vibranium we collected after defeating Ultron. It can take a lot more blows now,” Steve says, getting off the vehicle and taking his shield back into his arms. “Now, I see the fight is up there.”
“Hey Brother!” she shouts towards the King, earning their attention almost immediately. Peter’s eyes meet Tony’s instantly, and he awkwardly tries to swallow past a big lump in his throat. “There’s place here!”
After everybody assured that they’re fine, they’re moving towards Wade to help him back up. Ned, in his panic, starts to call the ambulance before Yaël assures him that it’s not necessary since he’ll heal immediately. For one, Peter’s glad he can’t say the same, otherwise MJ might have been curious about it.
“What the hell happened, Vision?” Yaël asked down the gigantic hole through the floors of the building. That looks expensive enough to fix…
"So, you'd rather be frozen again?" She was distracting him, as much as she could distract this utterly concentrated super soldier. He saw her tap with her foot, but he was too late. She made a quick pulling-gesture with her hand and before he could turn around, Steve got knocked down by a big piece of the brick wall from behind him, flying against his back.
The moment the four of them sit down on the couch, with the remote to the tv in Yaël’s hands, everybody seems to be taking a moment to breathe. In the past few days, not much has happened inside of the compound. Yesterday, they’ve been swimming and played a large game of hide and seek. The day before that, they had a Tolkien-marathon with literally no break at all. They’ve been keeping themselves busy with fun activities to forget for a while that Wanda’s practically under house-arrest.
“A good friend of Peter’s,” Tony says. Then he nods towards Peter’s room. “FRI tells me he’s stabilizing. Why are you all standing here looking sad? We should celebrate!”
Yaël remembered Charles telling her, that day when they were sitting in the graveyard, just talking. He meant it as something that could happen in the future, not as something that had already happened.
Peter wants to sit up, ask further about Mr. Stark and find out where he is, but at the same time he knows that might look a bit weird. So, instead of doing that, Peter stands up completely, giving his wet suit an exaggerated once-over.
Tony hums, pulling up the security images and finding only blurs of a light-haired person in black skin-tight suits. She’s pretty much how Peter described her, but it’s not much to go on. Facial recognition won’t be possible in this case.
“MJ! Hi, uh, hi! I’m, uh, kind of doing something right now, is there something wrong?” He quickly looks behind him to see where the Cat is. She seems to be climbing up, back to the roof.
“Yeah, sure, they’re always constantly worried anyway,” Peter mutters. He gets on his feet and nods towards the door. “Hey, pal, care to help me on this search party?”
“Oh…” Wade looked a bit disappointed at his bottle. Then he looked back at her with a wide grin “Let me try it!”
It’s not a long way to Corona. A couple of the Avengers are already on the team, but so far it’s chaos as the androids are all just making damage where-ever they are. Damn Doombots.
At least he’s not at the Raft. That would have been much worse. They’re just waiting for the trial until
“So, you eventually got yourself a date for today or not?” she asks playfully. Steve’s words fall short, and he realizes he can’t come up with anything. When he turns towards Tony, he finds the jerk looking at them in amusement.
Peter smiles and closes his eyes. Slowly but surely, he feels like his family is going to get back together at last. With a wide smile, he lets out a loud sigh.
“You get in when you’re ready,” Tony tells him with a smile. He squeezes Peter’s shoulder once, gently, before letting go. Peter nods, clearing his throat and opening the door. A few steps inside, but all he sees is what appears to be an empty interviewing room. Only one of the chairs is occupied. The stage is clear, the sky visible from the windows is dark.
“Please, believe me when I say that I’ll be alright. There’s two super-powered people underneath this roof, both with superhero-families. We’re far from danger.”
“Come on, let me carry him, you get back in the suit,” he offers. Tony shakes his head again, rocking his boy back and forth. “Please, Tony. We can get him somewhere safely.”
He’s behind the sink, having just brushed his teeth. His beard has been growing ever since his admittance in the hospital, but he hasn’t gotten around to shave it back to the usual goatee. His shirt is on the floor. He’s only wearing his pajama pants. It’s an exercise Dr. Wynedell made up for him, for him to accept the current state of his body. So far, Tony hasn’t been looking at his scar. He’s been avoiding it all the time, closing his eyes whenever he’s facing the mirror.
“It was alright, the cuts itch a bit,” Peter says with a shrug. Harry doesn’t say anything, instead just heading to the coffee machine and filling himself a cup. Tony drops the carton on the table to hurry towards his son, immediately grabbing his arm.
“You told me the synthetic skin itched like hell!” Yaël jumped towards Clint enthusiastically from reminding him a bit.
“Just wait on the couch, I’ll get ready,” Peter tells Mantis, who nods and looks a bit scared. To be fair, with those big eyes she always does. It can seriously mislead the enemies, Peter figures, since she’s actually kind of bad-ass when it comes to it.
Yaël noticed there was no cage this time, she was free to move, probably because she broke it last time. Wait, that’s not logical at all, because it was a dream. But dreams never had any logic, did they? And where were all the other people by the way? Why were they in the last dream but not in this one? Would this guy have something to do with it?
“I’m almost finished with the arc reactor, sir,” Peter suddenly blurts out nervously. Mr. Stark’s eyebrow goes up in surprise, and there’s a light smirk on his lips. Peter feels his face redden immediately. “I mean, I’m still missing the specific element; FRIDAY told me that only you are in possession of it so I thought I’d ask you-“
“He’s awake, just his typical self, I would say. A bit annoyed that a teenager managed to hack FRIDAY somehow, of course,” Steve says with a laugh, but Peter sees that it doesn’t reach his eyes. Steve looks exhausted, to say the least.
“It reminds me of older times, of my… youth.” He looked at bit doubtful when he said youth, like he wasn’t really sure if that was the correct word for what he meant. Well, Yaël totally didn’t get what he was talking about. That book looked older than its owner, who looked like he was thirty-something.
Eventually, MJ pulls Peter along to the dance floor. Surprised that she would actually suggest this, Peter can’t find it in himself to refuse. She holds on to his hand, goes to stand at the side of the crowd and pulls Peter’s arms up to her hips.
The man nodded again and put his hands on her cheeks, holding her face, like he knew what was coming and he was already forgiving her. This time, the shock didn’t stop anymore. Yaël did her best to stay conscious and kept staring into her opponent’s dark, purple eyes, his face, that she had ruined with her fire.
Peter grumbles to himself, but then he shakes his head. “I’m not even mad at you. But wait, what did you do?”
And that just does it now, doesn’t it? Because Peter can get detention, and he can walk away from it. But right now, Tony realizes that his son has been
“In ours! Because I beat you up just as much as you did me! And yeah, it sucks, but we’re not just ordinary people, aren’t we?!”
Okay, so I'm posting the chapter a bit earlier now, but that's mostly because I am myself a bit impatient to give you this one.
This was no time for long introductions and telling each other about their lives, yet it was Brunhilde who frowned and said: “I feel like I’ve seen you before.”
“Of course I will,” he returns. And Tony reads, starting from the beginning. He doesn’t get to the end because it only takes a few minutes or Peter to fall asleep. Not long after that, a light flash comes into the Parkers’ home. Once it’s gone, Tony Stark has disappeared and Mary heads back to her bedroom to go to sleep as well.
After she ordered her sandwich, she searched for a new distraction. An old television, hanging in one of the corners, caught her attention. A reporter was talking about some sort of war. Well, at least, it looked like a war, since they were showing explosions and demolished buildings.
“Yaël, get up!” the person, clearly a man, yelled. Yaël’s brain was still too lazy to think about the voice and find out who was stalking her. Did this person have a dead-wish or something?
“He’s a handful, yeah, but we take care of each other,” he then says, petting Dum-E on the head for a moment before thinking better of it. Dum-E just whirs as he tries to get closer.
“Please, Charles, can’t you see the kid has his own troubles? I don’t want to bother him with mine,” she replied, even though she sometimes got the feeling she wanted to crawl out of her own skin, which Charles immediately intercepted of course.
Maybe he should just go home. Next week he’ll learn the results from Dr. Cho, and then he’ll know. He can still just bail if he doesn’t like the result.
“That’ll be all, Mr. Parker,” Mr. Stark then says. Peter nods shortly before pulling all his stuff back together. The papers he can’t lose he keeps in his hands, with the idea of getting all of this in order with the receptionist downstairs.
“Normally I would hate asking help from others, but you might be right,” Tony mutters. He taps towards the screen, copying the files into a large message and addressing it to King T’Challa’s younger sister and Reed fucking Richards. “Any other smart people on our list?”
“Why the fuck are you swearing under my roof?” Tony says, almost jumping up from the couch while he turns towards Peter, who opens his eyes up wide in surprise. A bit confused about what’s happening here, he finds himself unable to say anything.
“Don’t do that,” May hisses at him, slapping his hands back down. Everybody starts laughing before somebody clears his throat.
“Uh, yeah, uh, I did,” Peter answers. “It needs some work, but it’s been with me since the beginning.”
“Look at that, look at that!” LL says when he sees the three of them standing there. Chrissy, sitting at her usual spot, holds out her phone and starts taking pictures before pointing at them.
So Peter runs after MJ, still standing there in his underwear. When he reaches out for her, she suddenly turns back to him, holding up her finger in a warning.
“What’s up, Cap?” she asked. Did somebody die while she was out? Would that mean that Yaël would never get to know this person again?
Loki’s smirk grew into a wide grin. “Don’t call it an affair, dear. We always had so much more than that, yet so much less than a relationship, too.Maybe you should trust me on this.”
." The ‘fighting’ they’ve done could be closer to sparring, a normal training-session between the Avengers. Peter knows it was never Steve’s intention to have him smash his face against the pillar. The man even ran up to him to check if he was alright, feeling so guilty.
So Peter walks outside. There’s a little backyard, especially put down just in case there’s good weather and they could eat outside. It’s empty there, nobody having found the place yet. It’s fine. Peter walks up to a tree on the farther side of the garden, leaning against it and looking up at the sky. He smiles spontaneously, fishing out his cellphone out of his pocket to check the time.
“It won’t stay down,” Peter mutters. Aunt May hurries towards him and makes quick work of styling his hair back down. When she, too, fails at it, she just takes off the cap she’s wearing and puts it on Peter’s head instead.
“It’s cooler to get a ride from the Spider-kid,” Hawkeye says, snorting and biting his lips as his words seem to catch his own ears. Peter, too, instantly forgets about the heavy feeling in his chest and slaps his hand on his forehead, letting out an annoyed sigh. He probably didn’t mean to make it sound so… wrong, but at least both of them could laugh about it.
know him? The guy owns pretty much everything here, comes on the news practically every day.” Well, it still didn’t ring a bell and there was a reason for that.
“Oh, how hard did you hit your head, kid?” Mr. Stark then stands up again, resting his hands on his hips. “We have to get you to the training center as soon as possible. See, this is what happens when you chase after danger…”
It’s a heavy pounding in Peter’s head. He has no idea what is happening, other than wanting to empty his entire stomach on the floor.
“We’re off to school,” the girl says cheerfully, waving at Tony before Peter pulls her through the door. Tony barely even has time to wave back, too confused about everything that’s happened so far.
“I really owe you one,” Happy says fondly, not really moving in his spot. “I don’t know what I would do without this job.”
“I suppose that would be alright,” Steve says, giving Wade a small push until the man lets go of Steve. Then he readjusts his shirt for a bit, putting a hand on Wade’s shoulder. “But… you need to understand that killing people just like that is something I’m not tolerating from you anymore.”
Let’s just say that Tony needed a bit of a time-out, just to catch his breath. Which is why Steve suggested he’d look over the gowns that were given to them.
“No, no, no, no, absolutely not!” Peter calls out, waving his hands together in another no-signal. “How did you even figure that out?”
Peter’s not sure how to feel about this. Should he be angry that Johnny left without saying anything? Or should he be glad that Johnny respected the fact that Peter’s already having too much shit to deal with lately?
Steve nods hesitantly. He gets another quick kiss from Sharon before the two of them get out of the elevator. Sharon quickly winks at Tony before the doors close again. He notices immediately when Steve lets out a relieved breath.
“Uh,” is all Tony can answer, and that’s answer enough. Peter isn’t angry, though. He gives Tony a playful poke, but then allows him to finish the tour. Once it’s time for the presentation, they get to the auditorium and take place somewhere on the sides. Peter, sitting safely between Aunt May and another student – a girl with bright orange curls and freckles on her face – waits patiently for the lights to be shut off.
“What do you know about interdimensional travel, sir?” Gwen asks, walking up to Tony’s desk and leaning against it with her arms crossed. Tony gives her a look, taking away his attention from his current project.
“That was me kicking my dads’ asses, that’s what it was!” Peter shouts all the sudden, pointing at the two surprised adults sitting there with confused looks.
“Bruce, it’s alright. Just… throw some water on them to chase them off or something,” Natasha tries. Bruce then starts laughing. When suddenly the door opens again, Natasha sees Peter walk in, right on time for his training of the day. Good.
But his plan actually worked. After Peter introduced Yaël to Wanda, a kind girl, Wade pulled the suit out of his backpack and Peter didn’t leave his side since then, asking questions about who made it and how it was sewed and stuff.
“For me it would be… Fuck Falcon, Marry Thor and… kill Widow,” somebody says. The other girls laugh, and Peter, too, snorts at the idea that
“She took the codename Element – thought we could get in trouble if we called her ‘Avatar’ so we didn’t use that opportunity. But after a while, she pulled a Phoenix on us. She lost control, the Hulk had to take her out. She lost her memories ever since and somehow befriended both Deadpool and my Son.”
“Yeah, thanks for that, FRIDAY,” Francis mutters. Then Peter hears Dum-E roll back towards him, so the teenager holds out his hand back behind him, expecting the bot to hand him his marker.
“Oh, that’s too bad,” Natasha states. It’s not really the saddest news there is, but Harry’s been living under this roof for a while now – under
Tony nods again. “Yeah, uh, I just figured it was because of all that’s been happening lately, you know?”
“Until now, the spider-venom merged with your DNA which gave you your powers,” he explains. “Now we’ve looked at the blood, and we’ve noticed that the venom is starting to attack your cells. Now we’re not sure if that’s what was going to happen either way, or if something is preventing your DNA from accepting the venom like before.”
This story is going to be completely posted before Infinity War, damn it! Or I'll try, at least :') Chapter 21 is almost finished!
“But you would think he got over that, no? They’ve been in a relationship for a few months, after all?” Peter asks, confused. Bruce shakes his head and looks up into the sky.
"Nah," she leaned back against the bench "He has to do this alone. Besides, what do you want me to do? Happily run to him and kiss his cheeks hello...in the graveyard?"
Before his mind can bring him into even more of a panic attack, a call comes in. Peter turns to the side again, ignoring the pain in his ribs. Shit, has he seriously been patrolling drunk again? That never amounts to anything good.
I'm not perfect, neither is the story. I think I had too much planned for the few chapters I had intended for the story, I started off with 22 chapters and one epilogue... That didn't hold on for too long.
T’Challa nods in understanding. They don’t say anything else until the car stops. Once they’ve exited the vehicle, Tony is guided inside, the two of them surrounded by guards. Tony quickly realizes that he hasn’t even taken the time to look around while they were driving. It’s a shame, apparently Wakanda is supposed to be a highly advanced country. Tony would have loved to get a look at their technology.
“Can I help you, sir?” a friendly voice asks back at the lobby. Peter looks up and sees a young man smiling up at him from where he’s seated. He had one of those earbuds in his ears to call with, and the computer he’s using seems to be the latest of Stark’s design. The guy always seems up to date when it comes to his business.
After a little while, the three men head outside to take some air. Steve’s missed this, just hanging around with Sam and Bucky. In the past few days, they’ve barely had the time for it. There was Peter to worry about, and before that there were the curses that had brought New Asgard into slight chaos.
Mr. and Ms. Thompson were always very kind to Yaël, unlike other elderly people she worked for. Most of them just let her work in silence, ignored her existence or criticized her blue hair. Once, a man even told her he was intimidated by her eyes, so Diego had scratched this man from her working schedule. But this couple, the Thompsons always brought her drinks and cookies, smiled at her and called her ‘dear’. Yaël hoped Diego would never give this couple to another of his employee.
As he tries to breathe, he realizes that there’s something stuck in his throat. Immediately, he reacts. He tries to lift up his arms, reach for the thing that’s been jammed inside, but his arms don’t move. His muscles hurt to much when he tries. In that realization, Otto’s heart starts racing.
Where Flash at first hated Peter’s guts, it seems like he’s warmed up to him ever since Peter defended him from Eddie’s rage. He’s not going to complain. Sure, Flash still throws out some slurs like ‘nerd’ or ‘geek’, but it’s never meant in an insulting way, rather than teasing. Despite that, though, Flash is still pretty much a spoiled ass, of course.
“I’m not really supposed to be showing you this, but it kind of involves a friend of yours,” she admits. Tony gives her a confused look before opening up the file, taking a look inside. “It’s not just a ship; it’s a spaceship.”
“It will, eventually,” Steve returns, pressing his lips once more on Tony’s skin. Tony throws his head back, realizing fully that Steve is all too aware of Tony’s sensitive chest. “Is it getting too hard for you?”
Tony nods, still feeling his heart break a little after hearing the words. Carefully he walks back to the crib where he puts Raido back down on his little mattress. The kid complains for a second before Tony pulls up a toy he found somewhere in the corner, and hands it to the boy.
“It’s alright, it’s alright! Just forgot my strength!” he says, one hand up in the air. Rhodey is looking down in amusement as Tony hurries to get something to clean it up. It must be weird for everybody to see Tony clean up his own messes like that.
“You walk in here, together with the most disgusting creature of this kingdom, asking for an Infinity Stone!”
Despite the anger he’s still feeling, Steve smiles up at Tony, who is seated on the table. Allowing him to take his hand into his own, Steve closes his eyes when his fingers are pressed against Tony’s lips.
“Yes, but if they’re too late, they’ll be severely outnumbered,” Sam admits. “Tony, he’s been driving himself crazy these past few days. Even yesterday before… everything… that CIA agent, Carter… she kissed him, and all he did was cry. He actually scared her.”
He can recognize more people from his class; there are Liz and her friends, a couple of other kids from the Decathlon-team – who would have thought that Flash would be a bit of a nerd himself? – and even Michelle is there, though she’s looking bored as hell. Those are about the only faces he can catch through the windows, but Peter is sure that, as soon as he gets inside, he’ll meet more of them.
But after a few minutes she grunted and started knocking on the door that could only open when the lift arrived.
Peter catches up with the classes. He might have missed a semester, but it’s still easy enough to follow. With the agreement that he’ll do those exams he’s missed anyway later in the summer holiday, Peter’s pretty sure he can finish this year easily.
“Ah, great,” he mutters to himself. He takes a few more seconds before he gets onto his feet. Then, he walks out of the alleyway – he should be happy that at least nobody found him like this. “Karen, can you maybe call my Dad for me?”
“Wait, so, if I understand this correctly, I lived in a country where all people could steer the elements?”
Yaël took a glass of water, sat down and counted the money she had earned. For some reason, Nothing Else Matters from Metallica was always the most popular song, while Era was way less loved. Not that Yaël has a problem with playing Metallica, Wade had told her to do so, but her personal taste went to Era more. She made the most money out of Nothing Else Matters and when she played it, there always gathered a small crowd around her. Though, Yaël knew for sure that the songs she played would sound way better if there was more than just one cello playing. If Yaël just knew someone who played this instrument too, she'd be able to play so much more epic stuff.
Suddenly, a memory came across Yaël’s mind, which made her flinch her a bit. She suddenly understood what the man meant with a long, long time ago, since her dad had died a long time ago. A very long time ago. Her dad had been coughing for a whole while, and after some time, the phlegm turned into blood. He died of some form of tuberculosis and Yaël stayed behind, alone.
“I’ll get you some breakfast. After that, the others will want to look over that suit again,” May says, getting up on her feet and nodding towards Peter, whose eyes suddenly open up wide. He gasps in surprise, putting his hands on his chest and looking down.
Once, a young-adolescent boy, about her age back then, came looking for her in the forest. Tricking her into believing she was special and beautiful, she naively took a walk with him and ended up in an open place in the forest with a few kids waiting for them. These kids were friends of the boy that lured her into it in the first place. She ended beaten up, her hands tied to high branches so all her weight made the rope cut into her wrists. The kids left her for dead and it took Cem a few hours before he found her forest-maze.
Excitement is not an emotion Peter would have expected to feel today, but as it is, he can’t help but express it. His lips curl up in a wide smile, his heart beats faster, and his hands suddenly grab on to the bed next to him as he jumps up in his seat.
be. Loki moved around her smoothly, not even questioning her actions. Water raised from underneath, forming into a few dozens of men with weapons of sharp ice as it reached the bridge. This way, Yaël created her own army. Her water army immediately clashed onto the zombies and started fighting.
The only part Peter hated about the call is the honesty Steve keeps at all times. So when Peter asked him if Steve was actually planning on breaking up with Tony, he didn’t like the answer.
After the call ends, Peter collects his stuff again, making sure to leave no trace behind. He leaves the building through the balcony once more, feeling like screaming it out of excitement once he start swinging his way back towards his new home.
Mr. Stark gives him another long look before standing up. Then he motions for Peter to do the same. Peter obeys, quickly following his father towards a door Peter hadn’t noticed before. The room inside of it is dark, but once Mr. Stark starts up the lights, Peter can see exactly where he is.
“Tell me about it,” he chuckles. “I guess that’s what happens when you only see life through your eyes; you don’t know what happens in other people’s lives.”
The doctors insist on examining him as well, and eventually they give him a mitella to support his arm, not move his shoulder too much. Apparently, he hurt it pretty much as well, though he can’t really feel it right now.
“Only me. Nobody else knows,” she assures him. Peter hears Tony let out a long breath. “He cares about you, Tony. More than he dares to admit. But you can’t expect him to just… let go of everything he’s been grown up with and say ‘hey, I can be with a man without any problem’.”
“Wouldn’t that be the best cliché?” she suddenly asks. “The guy and the girl get back together in the end, and they forget everything that happened?”
“What’s wrong?” he asked her again while Yaël unwillingly leaned against him and tried to get away from him again.
Peter takes a breath, and then takes another one. One part of him wants to call Steve, bring him up to date about what is happening at the moment. But the other part of him thinks that he doesn’t deserve to know if he’s not going to make an effort and try to be here. He knows it’s dangerous, but he would have thought that Tony would be reason enough to ignore all that.
“Did anyone ever tell you how glorious your hair looked back in the days?” she grinned while staring at his locks.
“-CRAZY?!” Tony interrupts, voice raised and face slowly turning red. “YOU GO RIGHT BACK TO THE LUNATIC THAT TRIED TO KILL YOU?!”
“We can give it a paint job,” Natasha returns before looking back up at him. Her gaze is serious, her green eyes focused on him.
Tony looks at the child, still a bit surprised that it’s there. He doesn’t know the complete story about this child; to him it just seems like it was suddenly there. Sure, he was aware that the girl had turned out pregnant around the time of them changing the accords. As to who the father is, he’s learned not to ask questions anymore.
Maybe it’s the fact that Harry keeps on trying to kill him, and has almost succeeded at it three times already… It’s probably that. But Peter’s had training now. Not for long, granted, but enough that Widow taught him the good tricks. He’s better in hand-to-hand now than he’s ever been!
“The MRI showed some lesions on his brain. It’s not too large yet, but it’s probably the cause of the seizure. We were expecting it, just not so soon.”
In just a matter of minutes, everybody’s quiet. The choir starts singing a tune Steve doesn’t recognize. Loki is standing in the front, next to Thor. On the other side, where Jane is going to be, Darcy is already waiting.
6 missed calls? Holy crap. Running back to the bathroom, Peter goes through the call-log, seeing that Steve has been trying to reach him all the time. But he frowns when he sees that, at eight p.m., somebody answered.
Still, he got a few words from his Aunt, who ended up driving both him and Ned – who is wearing a freaking cowboy hat! – to Liz’ house.
It takes exactly one second for Peter to realize that this place is close to nowhere he wants to be right now. The first person he comes across is none other than one of the men he helped lock up on the ferry. The one that was going to buy one of Mr. Toomes’ guns. He’s being escorted somewhere with two cops behind him.
The first light of dawn starts seeping in through the blinds. Tony blinks at it, then turns around to get back to the dark. He closes his eyes again. The nurse comes in once more, greets him, gives him his food. He startles when the phone vibrates again at nine.
“Oh hell no,” Peter mutters, trying to scramble upright, but stumbling against a hard, unmoving body. Turning around, he finds none other than Steve standing there, grinning down at him, holding the gun in his hand.
“Big deal?! When the whole world seems to revolve around sex, I think it’s a pretty big deal, yeah…” Peter throws his head back against the couch, looking at the ceiling with a defeated look on his face.
“But you’re a Stark, aren’t you! And you eff-in’ Starks seem to be really talented in freaking people out! What you said, was not cool, Peter!”
“And I got you one!” Aaron says with a wink. “Screen’s nearly indestructible, which is something you could use I assume?”
Something made a sweeping sound behind her and before she could turn around, Lopt jumped out of nowhere onto the guards and eliminated them with just one smooth slash. His stealth looked mythical, inhuman, just like the grace and elegance he moved with. A soon as everyone was down, he picked up a shovel and started scooped the dirt away, also faster and with more strength than any human or Helvegian would be able off.
There was something wrong. Yaël felt it since they started travelling towards the city walls. This dream was taking too long, why wasn’t she waking up? A few times it seemed like the darkness of the night was swallowing them, other times, Yaël’s eyesight started shaking again.
So far, the whole place seems to contradict himself. If Tony wouldn’t have known about the advanced technology, he would have expected more… old buildings. What he’s seen so far is only modern looking, standing out with the nature bright and green on the outside. It’s more like the tower, or the Compound. Nothing he would have imagined a palace to be.
“Oh, Tony. I didn’t know it was still an issue?” she asks. She puts her hand back on his shoulder and pulls him close until he’s leaning against her side. The hug is weird and mostly one-sided, but it feels good in a way, too.
Peter and MJ give each other a look when they notice the journalists holding up their cameras. Tony looks like Tony Stark, standing there like he has all the confidence in the world. Pepper stands next to him, keeping her phone in her hand but looking at the aircraft coming down instead of typing down.
Yeah, that’s what Steve was fearing. A quick look on the internet shows nothing. Is it because he called him? Is this possibly Steve’s fault?
Tony pulls his hand away immediately, as if touching her burned him. He clears his throat before dropping his gaze. What- how- how did she know? Tony never told her? He’s pretty sure Peter hasn’t been meeting up with her in secret!
“C’mon, we’re losing time. We need to get to Stark Industries,” she told him. He was obviously still not liking the idea, but he quickly strapped on his seatbelt.
“Come on! Don’t be mushy!” Clint complains. But to be honest, both Steve and Tony have been keeping themselves in for a while now. Keeping their physical touch to a minimum, only with the barest of touches, they’re actually behaving quite alright.
Peter walks up to him, reaches up for the glasses and pulls them away from Tony’s face, seeing the nervous eyes underneath them.
After what can’t be less than a minute, Mr. Rogers is taking place on the couch in front of him, giving Peter a friendly smile. There’s noise coming from Yaël’s bedroom, meaning that she’s getting herself ready for the day… well, whatever’s left of it.
“So you know what I’m talking about?” Loki sounded surprised, though Memory-Yaël, well real Yaël too, totally didn’t understand anything of it.
“And we’re both here illegally,” Wanda mutters out. Nobody responds to that, instead starting up the first Harry Potter movie.
It’s lunch again. Vision has prepared some eggs and bacon for everybody, and everybody is just enjoying their food for a moment. The discussion about the bet hasn’t even come up today, and for a short moment, Natasha feels a sense of victory.
“So, how were the DNA-results? You got them, right?” Yaël asked Peter as they walked into the park. She remembered him talking about it during the pizza-night. Peter nodded, he looked a bit nervous.
“May! It’s me, Peter! I’m somewhere in Midtown and I’ve already tried calling Dad but I think there’s something wrong! Can you just tell everybody that I’m safe?”
Only once Tony’s vision is cleared again does he notice the carnage around him. His whole office is a mess; his desk is tipped over. His chair looks like it was thrown through the room. A few glasses are shattered on the floor, and so is a, what used to be, full bottle of scotch. The amber liquid is now lying in a puddle and sinking into the wooden floors.
,” a familiar voice says above him. Peter looks up, right in time to see Iron Man arrive. Peter is breathing heavily, not realizing that he’s been sobbing along with it. Seeing his father come down, hidden underneath that stoic mask, makes him want to cry on the spot.
“Uh, that’s a long story,” Peter says, trying to wave the question away. “I’m here to see Mr. Stark?”
Peter figures that he’s ready to get back into the action. With Aunt May out to hang with her friends and no homework left for him to do, the teenager stands in front of the mirror to look at the scar he’s got on his abdomen.
“That makes you Rocky, the Horror Show,” he says with a wink. Ben slams his hand on the table and lets out a thunderous laugh. Everybody jumps out of their seat in surprise. Even king T’Challa and Storm turn around to see what’s going on.
“That kid in the middle? That’s our son. Peter. He has my eyes and your hair, he’s extremely smart but never skipped a grade because you were afraid he would end up like me.” He allows her to take the phone from him. The device is also something she’s never seen before, but that seems to be the least of her interests. “He keeps on going to school, about to get himself three diplomas. He has a girlfriend he avoids introducing to us even though we’ve already met her once shortly in the past.”
“Yup, Furry and X are clearly hiding something from you.” Wade mentioned casually, like he was talking about the weather.
After that, there’s Luis and Rita, the twin-exchange students from Peru who started this group as a school project and stuck with it even after they’ve graduated. Luis is trying to do something in politics, though what exactly Peter wouldn’t know. Rita switched major and ended up teaching instead. Now she’s happily married with another woman and has only recently announced they’re going to have a baby.
Peter shrugs, pulling up his shirt and revealing the small scar he still has because of it. The one on his back is bigger than this one, since this was the exit wound.
Stupid tears in her stupid eyes. Firstly, she had left Steve in the dark and now Wanda had disappeared.
Okay, so, whatever. Peter Parker is a sixteen years old boy who can climb and stick to walls. Yaël surely didn’t saw that coming, but that was the least of her worries at that moment. She focused back on Wade.
He watches a couple of the nurses walking out. Strange is behind them, passing a hand over his forehead in a gesture of wiping away sweat. One short look shared with the doctor is enough for Tony. They’re running out of time. If he’s ever going to find something, it needs to be soon.
“The same time as I am,” Peter says. “So there’ll be the party tomorrow evening, and the day afterwards we’re going.”
“Right, uh,” the kid mumbles out, taking his audio-recorder into his hands and pointing it at his own mouth. “Mr. Stark. Yesterday, the Avengers have once again finished another battle against yet another deranged mad scientist. What is your comment on this battle?”
“You’re kidding me, right? They played it on the radio all the time back in 2017! They even played it at that gala, it was our first public outing, remember?” Tony thinks back fondly of those years, a bit sad that more than twenty years have already gone by since then. He would have expected the future to be more different, but… being the provider for the future for so many years, it seems like it’s all just designed the way Tony thinks. Or the way Peter thinks, now.
“Ah, Cap, good you’re here. Peter had this one request but he didn’t dare to ask you despite the fact that you’re one gigantic teddy bear when it comes to the kid-“
“Yes, yes, I’m fine,” Steve says, quickly giving him a smile over his shoulder. “Can you take some plates? I think they are in the bottom right cabinet.”
“You’ll be brought to the right spot on the right time. Just listen well to the instructions you’re getting, alright”
Happy warns him. Peter rolls his eyes and leans back against the wall of the bus, giving Ned another look with an eyeroll. Ned only snorts shortly. “
It’s not the sound that comes when somebody crashes the door angrily, neither is it one where the wind smashes it close before anybody else can do it. This is the sort of sound that reminds Peter of the time the Lizard invaded the school.
FRIDAY responds, but clearly not really warmed up to the idea. Tony likes that she cares so much, but right now Tony just needs to tinker a bit. So he comes up with the formulas in front of him, though he remembers them well enough from when he studied them to remove them from Pepper’s body. His memory has kept that information safe inside his brain.
“Hell yeah, I am!” his laughter made her smile. “How do you feel?” he asked. Why did everyone ask that?
“Really, huh? How are you sure he’s not playing you?” the girl, Daisy asks, jokingly. She walks up to him, observing the suit with lots of interest in her eyes. “What do you look like underneath the suit?”
be alone. You need somebody around you, for your own safety,” Steve adds. Tony rolls his eyes and shakes his head.
“Looks like there’s some sort of food festival over there,” Steve notices, looking at somewhere on his right. “We could go there afterwards? Just… hanging out for a bit instead of heading back home immediately?”
“What are you talking about?” Steve casually wiped away her tear and signed her to get out of the lift. Apparently, they had arrived at her floor.
“Don’t look so shocked! Superheroes have relationships and personal lives, too. Heck, your family is the biggest example of that,” she says, patting him on the chest and pulling the paper out of his hand to put it back on the stall. Then she crosses her arm back into Peter’s and guides him over the rode. Peter hadn’t even noticed the lights turning green.
“You could have woken me,” Yaël took a good gulp from her coffee as she took a second to think about Peter’s random appearance.  “You have your interview, no?” she asked him, he had told her about that before the attack of that green Goblin-guy started.
“He’s asleep,” Tony says after returning to the living room, where Steve is busy cleaning up their mess. The movie is still playing in the background. As far as they can see, the Kryptonians are creating huge messes in the city. Tony wonders how anybody would even be able to survive that! And what’s the deal with the dubstep?
"The argument between you and Steve is the thing that got me in here. And when I’m here, I hear that you two haven’t set things right after Siberia. That’s not how things are supposed to happen.”
glad the walls are soundproof, too, otherwise I would never get a night’s sleep when I’m here,” he complains. When a door in the hallway opens up again, Peter looks behind him in surprise. Has Tony
“I might not be the biggest fan of Peter putting his life on the line, but I’m sure that with an Uncle like Steve no harm could come to him,” Mary jokes as she guides them inside the building. There are only a few people still inside, most of them on their way back home. The receptionist who got stuck with the evening shift looks like she’s about ready to head back to bed.
“Yay,” Tony exclaims softly before continuing his work. “FRIDAY, have you figured anything out from this place?”
“Whatever it is, the answer is probably going to be ‘no’,” he grumbled at her, but Yaël kept talking stubbornly.
had truly been the surprise of the century, she remembers. Stark’s goofy little kid who is clumsier than anything else? Who would have thought?
“DUDE?! WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?!” Peter asks with clear disgust on his face. He puts his hands on his ears, shaking his head while squeezing his eyes shut. Natasha hurries towards them and flicks the three men on the backs of their heads. Behind her, she can hear the pair in question move to find out what’s going on here.
“Oh?” Peter thanked the waiter as he brought him his chocolate milk. Yaël just nodded to the waiter.
Sure, Uncle Aaron has done some dumb stuff in the past, but he’s all changed now. Miles is sure of it.
“Just leave it there, it’ll be taken care off tomorrow,” Tony assures him, but Steve shakes his head.
But it feels too good. Because Steve is here, and he should just forget about everything and just take him into his arms, because who cares? Who cares if they’ve been fighting? They’ve fought before, and they’ve gotten over it.
“Hold it right there, sir!” a familiar voice calls out. Peter feels immediate relief when he sees Steve run out of the quinjet, his shield at the ready. His skin looks a bit tanned, his hair slightly longer than the last time Peter saw him. And is Peter just imagining it, or is Steve letting his beard grow again? Tony might be happy to see that.
“How there, cowboy,” she says with a chuckle, trying to get back to her breath. Peter, too, finds himself breathless. His eyes are still closed while his mind is trying to process what exactly just happened. Did he really just practically make out with MJ during their first kiss? In front of her house, where her parents live?
But instead of turning towards Steve immediately, Tony keeps to himself. He holds Peter’s hand, takes May’s place in stroking through Peter’s hair in a sudden need of touch.
Spider-Man’s chest goes up when he breathes in, and then he pushes himself forward. Miles holds out his hand in a gesture to help it out. When Spidey sees it he nods at him and takes the help to get himself back on his feet.
“Pete’s in the kitchen, he got your soup on the side but it’s nearly time for dinner distribution so you’ll have to drink up quickly.”
He’s never had money to run out of. Never had to worry about having food in the fridge, having a bed to sleep in. He never even had to worry about his parents, because they barely seemed to worry about him.
“Oh, no,” he hears Steve breathe out behind him. Then the shield falls down on the ground, and footsteps are nearing Tony. But Tony’s tears don’t stop even as Steve wraps his arms around both of them, too.
“He’s also a master of the mystic arts who can track shit,” Bruce adds with a wink. Peter hums in understanding, passing a finger over the screen as he goes through the files. “I’m sorry I ran off during the whole thing at Otto’s.”
“Yup, their parents were always ashamed about the mutant-stuff, though.” Mr. Thompson said. “They always lied, and still lie, about it to everyone. They say they send them to a boarding school for their troubling behavior, but Alex was actually kind of rescued from solitary confinement by this Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, where he was put in for not being able to control his powers. They took him to this school… uh…”
The stank made Yaël open her eyes again. She noticed she was surrounded by broken planes and other junk as she tried to get up. Where the hell was she? The cuts she got from the crash stung, but once more Yaël’s body proved that she wasn’t going to die that easily.
“I found the Vulture-guy. His name is Adrian Toomes and he’s Liz’ dad. He’s headed to Brooklyn, but he’s planning on hijacking the ship that will transport all your stuff to the compound.”
“Uh, sure thing,” Peter responds. He waits for Steve to close the door again before he puts his head on his knees. He knows he’s going to get it now. With Tony’s constant fear over Peter getting hurt, he’s sure he’s going to get another speech from him, about him being uncareful.
Seeing that Tony doesn’t want Peter near the boy, Steve had given him an alternative way on catching up. Knowing that he’s, for now, not allowed at the secluded ward, Peter hurries back to Steve’s office.
How to train your Tony Stark: Pepper Potts has a lot of patience, but it's about ready to run out when she learns Tony's escaped from the hospital
Steve is somewhere Tony has no idea of. Is he still on Earth? Was he sucked through another portal as well? Heck, was Peter, too? They were standing rather close together, but this Peter’s obviously not his. This Steve isn’t either.
“Depends on who’s paying,” she says seductively, reaching out a hand and putting it on Peter’s cheek. Then, without a warning she pulls his head up again. “My eyes are up here, hotshot.”
His Spider-Sense. He should try and calm down a bit to focus on that! It’s been acting weird the entire evening, making him on edge almost permanently. Now, he needs to clear his mind. Peter closes his eyes, listens to the sounds around him, and tries to find anything off with MJ.
“Dude what’s this thing made off?” Peter asks in surprise, trying to calm his stomach down. The captain chuckles and then stops right in front of another car, Peter almost flying off of it.
“Hey, you heard about that Spider-Man? Took out some giant lizard while we were chasing down air a few weeks back.” Steve nodded. He had indeed read something about it. When they arrive in front of Tony’s door, Steve stopped pushing the chair.
