, they call him in far-too-loud whispers - with such force and determination Dean has to laugh again. Well, fuck, at least he can agree he’s incredibly handsome.
”That’s the first time I ever heard you say thank you.”
Sam rolls his eyes, a full-body ordeal. He doesn’t say
Hips bucking mindlessly into his stroking hand, wanting more, more, he wets his lips with eyes squeezed shut. ”I’m gonna come,

his nose. It stuns Cas enough to let Dean move away and pull his gear back on, smirking triumphantly.
Dean is prepped and ready to go after riding a pair of amazing, slicked up fingers, and
”You gotta have an angel brother to hook him up with,” Dean says to Cas, rubbing the pain out of his ankle under the table. ”Anyone as good-looking as you up there?”
Sam kind of works as his part time nurse, part time researcher. It’s him Dean calls if he gets into trouble, and it’s more often than not him who searches the trouble up for him, so Dean can go and solve it, or punch a few punks and call it a day. Sam is good at the computer stuff. Read as: Sam is a full-on nerd.
”Do you like to have control over your work, but give it up in bed? Do you want me to tell you what to do?”
But he vanishes.
”Demonblade, can I have your autograph?”
Sam popped his lips, tapping on the book in front of him. Maybe he wished he never looked up from reading it. He seemed to be running on empty.
Castiel is methodical, Dean thinks, as he pushes him harshly up against the wall and Dean moans against his lips. He hits it with a thud that could have frames falling off the walls if he had any, and Dean is reminded very suddenly of his strength (and that Sam is very likely packing up his laptop and leaving promptly). He wants that strength to do things to him nobody else has. He doesn’t know what exactly, in his very delirious little brain, but. He’s sure they’ll figure something out. They can play around. There’s still time. Heat rises in his face at all the devilish ideas.
Dean kind of can’t breathe. Not that he’s too bothered by that; not when he’s standing in front of a maniac. ”What?”
I don’t get
for how delicious it smells.
Nah, man. He shouldn’t let it sway him. He’ll just leave it be. Unprofessional, is what it is. The city depends on them, on this night as much as any other.
”No, you’re not. You’re my partner in crime-fighting and you’re always welcome, even though I’ll admit it was unexpected. I assumed you’d still be at rest. However, it’s also very appreciated.”
”You shouldn’t touch the evidence.”
Johnny Cash still sings it in his head.
Dean’s lips fall open as he stares at this brave vigilante, previously always so stone cold to him. His heart beats hard, so hard he wonders if it’s even visible through the armor plate.
He’s not bitter, though. He’s totally
No, yeah.

have been a good phone because Castiel had never heard of bricks full of electric circuits, apart from maybe houses made of bricks. But phones were small. Such science was beyond man. He suspected Dean just wanted to be able to send him the little yellow faces that so often filled their conversations via text message these days, which he’d also had to grow accustomed to. (Dean also sent a purple vegetable sometimes next to a yellow hand clenched to a fist. Not recognizing the vegetable or its apparent importance, Castiel just let him continue as long as it made him happy.)
Sam’s face twisted in a skeptical look. “Uh, sure. Um . . . you okay?”
“I’ll just get dressed and then call an Uber.”
about his enrollment at Vinehall. Only a couple of weeks, and then he’d be safely stowed away in the world’s foremost omega fortress. Sam would be on his way to Stanford and his future shortly after.
“Dean, I’m a member of the Heavenly Host. I have six thousand brothers and sisters. On today of all days, I won’t be alone.”
“Holy shit,” Sam breathes. “Holy
Cas felt cold fingers of dread run up his spine. “I had hoped . . . perhaps we could talk, Dean?” Cas asked primly. Dean snorted and propped himself up on his elbow.
Sure enough, he saw Hannah, her green and gold plaid homespun standing out like a sore thumb in the middle of the other finery on the floor, cheeks lit pink as she danced with a very tall young man with almost unfashionably long hair.
Castiel smiled, leaning down to press a quick kiss to Hannah’s cheek, which they returned. “I know. Thank you, Hannah.”
“Hannah, I have to go after—”
“Marcy, you’ve gotta cut it out with that crap,” he said, scowling. Marcy scoffed.
“He’s promised,” Cas continued bitterly. “I knew that, I’ve always known that, but tonight . . . Gabe, I panicked, I saw
Dean turned Castiel gently around and made quick work of his clothes, and before Castiel knew it he was spread out on his bed with Dean still clothed between his knees. Dean expertly rolled the condom on to Castiel’s over-sensitive length before finally, blissfully, wrapping his plump lips around Castiel’s cock and sucking him in earnest.
“Nothing, he . . . he didn’t . . .” Castiel looked up and met the earnest eyes of his big brother, the one he’d always wished could have been there to guide and protect him during his turbulent childhood. He swallowed hard against the urge to confess everything, to have Gabriel swoop in and save the day.
“Cas, hey, it’s cool. I trust you. I just meant easier cleanup, is all.”
!” he shouted, arching his back into it. Dean chuckled.
“Here.”
It should be too much, it should feel like a mistake, but Castiel wants everything with Dean and he isn’t sure he’ll have it beyond tomorrow.
“God, your hands,” Dean breathed, grinding against Castiel’s palm as he pressed the heel of his hand into Dean’s hot length. Castiel’s mouth watered, a brief flash of desire to get his lips around it as Dean rode the pressure of his grip. Dean collapsed forward, planting his hands on the bed above Castel’s head as Castiel rubbed him through the fabric with one hand. He snaked the other around Dean’s thigh and worked on undoing his belt and button. Dean caught on to what he was doing and reached down to help, finally working the zipper down and revealing a large, dark spot on the red briefs he’d been wearing in the picture from earlier. They hugged his cock nicely, seaming trimmed in white outlining the impressive shape of him. Castiel grabbed the waist of Dean’s pants and pushed them down as far as he could with Dean still straddling his chest. He eased the waistband of Dean’s underwear down enough for the head of his cock to peek out and moaned.
about this place? How are you even here?”
But fuck all of that. Dean was currently doubled over in pain, trying not to hurl the last of his lunch onto the pavement outside of the Omega Clinic. Cas placed a comforting hand on the small of his back, but Dean waved him off.
to tell his mother about. After three or four glasses, the bubbles seemed to affect him, as he grew increasingly giggly as the night wore on.
“You really want to know?” he asks.
Dean glances over at Charlie where she sits on the sofa, legs crossed and a huge bowl of ice cream in her hands. They’re re-watching
Bobby nods. “Good.” He turns to face Dean. “You’re takin’ him with you.”
“I can’t recite a spell that’s going to curse you forever,” Castiel whispers.
The omega chewed on his bottom lip, pulling the plump flesh into his teeth and letting it go, pink and shiny. Cas tried very hard not to think about doing the same to it himself, leaving those plush lips kiss bruised.
“It’s a proper dancing hold, Dean,” Cas said, though he sounded breathless, too.
In spite of his better judgement, Castiel called the doctor to postpone his next suppressant shot before he left for lunch with Charlie that Friday. Away from the cocktail of Dean’s pheromones it was easier to think more clearly. He really did feel awful, and he had vomited up everything he’d eaten of the last couple of days. He had just started to feel better that morning, and wanted a few days to recover before dosing his body again. He made sure to slather on a thick layer of blockers, though, lest someone notice he’d pushed back his next dose.
Dean laughed. “Okay, cool. Just make her something cool, not, like, a Dodge Charger or some shit.”
It’s not a great spell, and it won’t last long, but it does change Castiel’s general appearance and he’s able to transform his travelling clothes into a set of plate armor. It’s heavy, and he isn’t used to walking in it, but he has enough military training to be able to hold himself upright and stride toward the guard.
“Can I help you, sir?” one of the guards asked Castiel.
Castiel’s fingers hesitated over the keys before finally typing out:
“The prisoner is a friend of all of ours. We would all like to see her,” Castiel replied more sternly.
“Wanna join?” Charlie asked brightly from the floor. Dean shook his head, cold panic trickling down his spine.
“Dean, calm down, none of this is helping Charlie,” Cas said, sitting calmly as though Dean wasn’t two seconds away from launching himself across the seat at him.
Dean’s stomach was twisted into a hundred knots, sharp, stabbing pain under his ribs. He felt like he was going to crack wide open, struggling to breathe, when suddenly Cas’s hand was on his knee, warm and solid. He looked up into blue eyes shimmering with tears.
“Maybe he managed to contain it. Maybe that’s what Cas’s glass thing meant.”
“They are tenacious.”
Thunderbird’s silence is very loud in response. Welp. So much for small talk.
”What wouldn’t you do for money, eh? Tell me that much. Humour me. What
, let’s say. It seems Valkyr must have foreseen that I’d be coming to look for him. I have a reason to believe he’s back to continue what he started.”
, because it’s like? 2 AM? Well, Sam is very wise for figuring out he can avoid Dean going all big brother duty on him this way. “I’m a
”I find that your beauty is your best trait,” Cas says, so suddenly it nearly floors Dean. Well, it might have almost-floored him no matter the velocity. Or his current proximity. He stops dead in his tracks and lets the words send shivers over his skin. ”Maybe it’s your honesty and authenticity. No, it must be your altruistic motives, how you always try to do ethically good acts, for others to gain something. You help and you save and you always try to make
”That’s comforting  news. I’m myself already looking forward to later,” Castiel says, blinking owlishly like he can’t believe he said it out loud. He pulls away a bit, studying his hand. ”For now, though.” The sticky remains of their very romantic moment vanishes from his palm, just like that. He clenches it to a fist. ”Let’s go kick some ass.”
it was really him; he sure wouldn’t recognize him back anyway, given Dean’s full cover when they’re on a job. But now, studying his hair, dark and soft with some wayward, unruly strands, Dean thinks he knows. He thinks. No, maybe he just
”Is this fine?” Cas asks, the piece of shit. Dean can feel how his boxers have leaked through, and maybe that’s embarrassing or something, but Cas just seems to enjoy it.
He’s here and he’s beautiful. He’s so fucking beautiful.

at home?
”Why?” Dean demands immediately, defenses dropping as he turns concerned.
. Only plausibly, because it’s kind of hard to see beneath any regular vigilante costume, and especially this guy thinking he’s hot shit in a black eye mask and trenchcoat get-up, on top of the shiny black latex bodysuit...
”Demonblade, you have to trust me on this.”

”Oh, touchy subject?” Sam sneers widely, very cruelly, goddamn it all. ”I see now why he was
Dean scrunches his nose up in silent disagreement. He’d rather stay here, being warm, happy and useless.
”No,” Castiel mused thoughtfully, “I don’t think penguins are well-versed with that concept.”
”Oh yeah, baby,” Dean gushes at the sight and rubs his palms together excitedly. ”Come to papa.”
”You’re forgiven. You could have kept us here all night.” Cas smiles as he slips past him from the elevator, untangling his headphones with a Lana Del Rey album open in Spotify on his phone. Dean stares. ”Thanks for the rescue.”
Sam looks concerned at him. Dean might be feverdreaming, but still, he gets it. ”He brought you here, and then I don’t know where he went.” Dean’s stomach twists with guilt, so painfully he almost groans. ”He was pretty roughed up, but I think he’ll be fine, Dean, so don’t worry about it for now. It’ll only do you worse.”
, please come for me too. I want you to come, lemme make you...” Dean gasps, rutting into the touch as Cas bites down on his neck. ”Please,
“And your lips,” Cas adds in a hush. “I could never forget kissing them.”

”Can you tell Dean to have a good day?” Castiel asked her, and his phone opened the text conversation full of yellow emojis (and one astray purple vegetable).
What the hell dude.” Dean pulls his plate away. ”You can’t just
“Son of a bitch,” Dean has time to growl.
Dean’s brain doesn’t work right now. All he can think about is Cas’ cock in his hand. In his mouth. Inside him. Hands on his hips and pounding into him right at the sweet spot until he's begging for more. ”Huh?”
”I have a new lead,” Thunderbird continues, and Dean has to pop the lovey dovey thoughts with a pin like they’re a balloon. A heart-shaped one. He rolls his eyes. ”I’m sure of it this time.”
”Nobody accuses
Siri buzzed back. ”I’m not sure I understand.”
The fact sits coldly in Dean’s chest for a moment.
About as much as he knows, is that the guy’s name is Thunderbird. It’s what everyone who’s been reading a newspaper the past few months knows.
you, but I did not mean any harm.”
Dean swallows, knuckles brushing past the bulge he can feel hardening in the front of Cas’ pants. ”Well that’s relieving. Can’t have them see you’re even talking to this dickhead you
But before he can reach the victim, someone’s tugging him back, and Dean only has to take one look over his shoulder before he raises his fist. He comes crashing back into the henchman with knuckles first, right into his face. The enemy groans and Dean doesn’t hesitate to knee him in the stomach before he throws him to the ground, knocking him unconscious when his head hits the cement floor.
. What they accomplished tonight has just been a one out of many times Dean saved someone’s life, and he’s sure it’s the same for Thunderbird, and yet he can’t shake the feeling they really did something good. And maybe it’s because they did it together.
years!”
It’s just dreams, but,
Dean feels so full of red hot fury, he decides a plan of action can go fuck itself. He’ll bolt up those stairs and stab the fucker until he’s begging for mercy, and he’ll be the one to refuse to give it to him. ”Show you mine if you show me yours?”
The mission goes as planned while Dean climbs the wall, in through the window which he manages to open with a little technique he very much likes to call
Leather and latex, man. That’s all. It burns any hard exterior he ever tries to build up and makes him want to melt like hard candy under his touch.
Cas, who notices him from where he’s been laughing at the desk of one particularly long-haired salesman, stands up straight. Great, that guy had cornered Dean in the elevator just a few days before and Dean had almost screamed out about sexual harassment in the work place, what with the way he’d been staring Dean down like he was a feast. Which, admittedly… Dean could take a compliment, and he might just be coming to terms with his not-so-straight sexuality (Charlie in administration would be
And you’re so much more than that to me.”
When they stumble back after another moment, they just stare at each other, catching their breaths.
instead!
Dean’s throat feels dry, so he just wets his lips and nods. He feels shameful, sure, but fuck is it
He wants to fuck him on every piece of furniture, to be fucking honest.
”Please,” he murmurs against the fabric, hot against his face. His hands travel up the back of Cas’ thighs to grab his ass, pushing him closer to his face and he thinks maybe, maybe he’d even slap his dick against his cheek. He’s feeling that much out of it right now. ”I wanna taste you. Want you to fuck my mouth.”
“You’re better at that, ya know, touchy feely stuff.” Dean waves his hand experimentally, overconfidence in that anything he even says makes sense. “You got hitched, dude.”
He barks a laugh, but silence fills the speaker as Dean slowly lets a blush creep into his cheeks in time with the seconds passing. ”I suppose that would be unfortunate,” Castiel husks eventually.
When Castiel wraps his hand around both their cocks at the same time, and Dean feels the warmth and hardness and the weight of him against himself, he only has to stroke quickly once, twice, slick and wet and made of fucking wonderous wonders… so that when Castiel surges forward and kisses Dean’s neck, he’s suddenly
he barked. ”What the hell did you do?”
Dean’s senses wake to life and he stares up at the top floor just as Castiel plunges his switchblade into Slade’s neck.
Besides, Cas is pulling himself back into his slacks and dropping back to his knees. With one hand he shoves a big-eyed Dean back against the wall, and with the other he pulls him out of his pants.
in front of him with a small black box presented like a gift in his certain hands.
”What now?” Castiel rasps, beyond thought and reasoning. His lips are parted and eyes mesmerized as he looks over Dean’s body.
The thing closing in on him could very well be a man, a man in a brown suit and an old-fashioned hat. But he’s pale. All of him is pale, like all he is is an old, faded photograph. It’s like the edges are blurry. His existence, barely here.

You could laugh and question the occasion. Because, how
Thunderbird stops and turns around so abruptly Dean almost falls on his face trying to halt himself. ”Demonblade, I’ve
”Hey uh,” Dean starts, clasping his hands; his defences are down. “I was thinking. Why didn’t you heal yourself, that time? In the warehouse? If that’s your thing, I mean.”
The stitches on his leg itch annoyingly, recently washed in his finest corner shop alcohol.
Now, Dean Smith really likes his life. He’s a well-respected dude with a nice office and he gets to tell people what to do. But Cas talking to the salesman that morning? Maybe he kind of wants some more of that. That is to say, um, maybe some more
partners.
Dean shakes his head, breathes out steadily through his nose. It does fuck-all to calm his panic mode down. ”Alright,” he mutters, smoothing down his tie, ”let’s be logical. Is there a Help-button?”
,” he emphasises with turning around, ”so I believe it’s actually deemed as fair that you should trust me back.”
now?”
Dean perks up immediately, stopping himself from clapping Thunderbird on the shoulder in the process. ”I like your funny words, magic man.”
”Of course,” Castiel confirms, sinking lower yet under the covers. ”Do we lay in bed until dawn?”
”Oh I’m just peachy, Cas,” Dean grins, arms around his waist. His skin so warm under his touch, making him feel fluttery inside, despite being totally fucked out and suddenly a little awkward about the jizz on Cas’ hand. His jizz. Cas just made him come and his jizz is on his hand, oh god. ”Ten outta ten.”
”Perhaps I should restrain you again.”

things. Why does it
He hears Sam disappear to talk to some of the girls at the scene and he steps closer to the other vigilante, putting them even more in the comfortable bubble he’s experiencing.
“Sway,” he murmurs as an instruction, tilting his head down to check their feets’ position; he doesn’t estimate they’ll risk stepping on each others’ toes, at least. “That’s all you gotta do. Would be better with some music, like
Sam takes a breath, but stops himself. ”Anyway,” he continues loudly with an exhale and Dean lies back down, feeling triumphant, ”there was a lot of
”How! Did! This! Happen!
Still, he feels so happy. This madhouse he’s found himself in happens to be a two bedroom apartment they collectively decided to move into, combining savings with a generous reward for solving the Valkyr case handed out by the local police department. What can he say, he was tired of stinky, abandoned houses, and he really got jealous every time he had to leave Cas’ bed to return to his own springy camping bed mattress.
His index and middle finger run down the outline of his cock, straining painfully in his boxers. Dean can’t stop thinking about those fingers fucking into him, wet with lube, scissoring and curling as Dean lies panting into a pillow and rutting into the mattress, his kisses on the back of his thighs, humming quiet, awed praise. Instead, he’s panting into an elevator and biting the shirt on Cas’ shoulder, with his perfect hand down his pants as he tries not to come prematurely. Jesus christ. What a night.
But you know, it’s not a
concerning. They haven’t seen anyone yet, no henchmen, not a trace. Could be a dead end. Could be something else.
”Hey, subordinate,” Dean calls out and Cas points to himself questioningly, eyebrows raised. ”Yeah you, Novak. I’ll see your reports done on my desk before this day is done. Capiche?”
So, that’s new. Dean raises an eyebrow. ”Hey, buddy, I didn’t
right now while stuffing his face with some fine takeaway cuisine and/or drinking the sorrows away as if his liver’s opinion doesn’t exist.
Somewhere in the middle, Jorgenson sticks out. Eric. Dean scans the rest of the names until he gets to another one he finds oddly familiar: Valentin Kyle.
”I just found a bunch of lore about it,” Sam continues. ”It’s nordic stuff, like Scandinavia, you know the vikings. So we’re talking Norse, mythological creatures that are said to bring the dead soldiers from the battlefield. The valkyries would take their souls to Valhalla, which was kind of their version of Heaven for fallen soldiers. Usually they’re women, or, anyway, depicted as women—”
”I guess I could get used to this,” Dean admits. His eyes snap back from his lips to his eyes. ”The travelling, I mean.”
Dean takes a sobering breath. It does nothing for him; he still feels dizzy as he places Castiel’s hands on his hips, putting his own on his waist too, beneath the trenchcoat. If they’re going to learn to dance, he might as well do it properly, like there’s no tomorrow. No bullshit, too-straight-for-this excuse of a dance. It’s meant to be intimate.
“Shut up.”
“I love you, too, Dean,” he declares. “More than anything.”
Cas tilted his head, squinting. “I’m . . . sorry?” he said. Dean clenched his teeth, and a fist.
“Excuse me,” he said, practically elbowing Samuel Winchester, with his ludicrously long hair, out of the way before shielding Hannah’s exposed calves from view.
“How was Crowley?” Kevin asked.
“Hey, Cas, merry Christmas!”
“Charlie Bradbury.”
Castiel glares at Gabriel over the top of his book. “I have friends.”
“If you two idiots are going to do this,” she said archly, “then I’ll go with you. You know, as an official
And hear. It’s quiet, though. Almost too quiet. Steeling himself against the inevitable pain, Dean tries to push up into a sitting position. That white-hot dagger sensation lances through him, sharp and intense, and he gasps against it, fist curling tight into his covers.
“Dude, seriously?”
Castiel pants into Dean’s neck, beyond words, when suddenly something snaps deep inside and he’s coming, hard enough to white out, groaning deep and loud into Dean’s neck as he spurts thin omega come all over Dean’s cock, fist, and stomach. Dean works him through it, then lets him go to pump his own cock. Castiel breathes deep, sucking in their combined scent, looking up into Dean’s face as his cheeks twitch, lower lip caught between his teeth.
The guilt returned. “I wanted to. But if I had, I simply would have been arrested, too. And then it would have done Charlie, and Benny and Andrea, no good. We’re going to help them, Dean. I promise.”
“Um, yeah. No problem.”
“Left a lasting impression, though,” Jody said. “Gonna join us for worship next week after your honeymoon, boys?”
“Dean, I don’t think I need to tell you how—how—
left.”
“You’re the oldest, aren’t you supposed to be the chaperone?”
“Uh, sorry,” Dean says, releasing Cas and pushing back. “That was, um . . . what the hell did you do?”
She blocked his path to the door, and Castiel growled at her. “Get out of my way,” he hissed. His omega was out there alone, he needed to be caught, sheltered,
“Well, you might as well sit down.” Castiel hesitates for a moment, then slides into the seat across from her. She regards him over the rim of her cup, her gaze unnerving. Castiel lets his own gaze slide around the room to avoid looking at her.
While he’s perusing what little of Castiel’s C.V. he can access, a notification pings on his phone. It’s an email, which is weird. Dean doesn’t really get emails to his personal account that aren’t spam, so he pulls it open and nearly bursts out laughing.
“How about me? Do I appear, uh, ‘changed?’”
“Do you have any plans for the holiday?” he asked.
“Oh, baby, wish I had you here, so empty, want you Cas. Fuck me, f-
“It’s . . . what?”
Dean was currently looking up at Cas expectantly, so Cas shrugged. “Why not?” he said. Dean practically jumped to his feet, fished a couple of beers out of the mini-fridge and dug through his video collection.
The silence stretches out between them again. Sam is sleeping lightly, though far more quietly than he has in a while. Dean is sound asleep, snores likely muffled by his pillow. Jack’s room has gone quiet; Castiel is still worried, but he simply seems to be content to read through the night.
“It’s
“I think he’s in trouble, Gabriel,” Cas said. “I don’t know enough to know for sure, but . . .”
“But your father, he—”
He couldn’t help it. They looked like chains.
“How many a year?”
Charlie. Sam got to know her well while Dean was gone, and he trusts her, but he also can’t forget that she comes from a universe where angels tortured and killed people.
“Dude you’re so dead,” Dean laughed.
wanted me to be here.” He plucked nervously at his sleeve. “He sent me this tux, actually.”
The unspoken word rattles around in Castiel’s head during the entire drive back to the bunker.
“What can I say, I’m a fun guy.”
Everything was a post-panic blur after that, though he was sure Michael had walked him back to his room. Thank fuck no alphas were allowed past the doors, even members of the Board. Dean rushed to his room, practically stripping off his clothes as he went, ducked into the bathroom so fast he didn’t even see if Kevin was in, then turned the shower on as hot as it would go.
, Dean thought earnestly, the itch under his skin starting to become an ache.
Castiel glares at Gabriel. “That’s hardly how it happened.”
“Wait, Cas, you can’t walk. Take the carriage, I’ll call it for you.”
There was a knock at the door. Dean choked out a sob. He didn’t want anyone to see him like this, left wanting by his alpha because he was such a terrible omega. He dragged himself to the door, leaning against it. An awful whine dragged itself from his throat.

“I fucking
“No, I think he mentioned it that first time we talked, y’know?”
“Hey, Ellen, this is Cas,” Dean cuts across her, pulling Castiel up to the bar. “And he’s pretty hungry, since we got up at the crack of dawn to come see you. Matter of fact, so am I, and we’d be pretty grateful if you had anything laying around we could eat.”
“Yes, I’m sabotaging this project on purpose.”
Cas nods, then flicks his fingers and sets the small fire ablaze with a spark. Dean will never not be fascinated by watching people perform useful spells like that.
Castiel pushed himself out of bed with a growl of frustration. He wasn’t getting any sleep, anyway. He threw on a pair of sweatpants and an old t-shirt and ventured out on his balcony. He punched the digits into his phone and hit “dial” before he could think about it again.
my dear, if you couldn’t tell that was fan-fucking—”

He feels set on fire. But it’s so buoyant, so peaceful. So normal.

make out the number 30 spelled in the middle with M&M’s. It’s like a very wayward rainbow.
Sam stares in front of himself with a haunted expression. ”I’m never eating Subway again.”
It’s both an answer to the previous question and an inquiry in general. What would awake Dean want him to do? What does asleep Dean want of him in this moment? It’s common to ask for a glass of water, Cas recalls. Maybe a glass of warm milk. Do they have any milk? He’d go buy some, if the closest store was still open. He’d simply have to go to one further away.
. He tries to convince himself of it too while he puts his hands around his neck for extra pressure, tries to keep the man’s trembling ones from coming off. To keep the slash across his throat closed, and keep the blood from spilling out.
”He was very invested,” Cas mildly confirms, reminiscing the other day.
. He buries his face into the crook of his neck; he won’t last, god knows he wants to, but his stomach tightens and Cas groans in his ear and he
they do.
And when the man removes his trembling hands from around his severed neck, the cut is healed, and all the blood is gone from off their bodies.
But that was just.
Thunderbird walks up slowly to the scene and puts his blade back into his sleeve. Way too slowly.
So, basically, thing is, he ends up letting his eyes wander upon inch and inch of strong, latex-clad thighs as that trenchcoat lifts with the raise of his arms. And they wander, and wander...
”How much are you willing to bet?”
and he saved a lot of
Sam nods silently. He turns the laptop for Dean to see. It’s a picture of some men in suits, some in parkas, fancy fedoras as was typical of the era. Nothing exciting about it. They’ve just signed some sort of deal. Then he leans in closer and reads their names listed below the picture.
out. To hell with this angel, made of stardust and cosmic powers and goddamn, Dean might just love him to the moon and back.
“Well, bud. They kind of like someone so much they just wanna be with them, right? Uh, you tell him, Sammy.”
, or something, maybe, what the hell. He
”I wouldn’t do that unless you want to join your friend.” While Dean tries to find the source in the turmoil and flying sawdust, he sees hands wrap casually around the railing of the staircase upstairs. ”Is that your formal title, by the way? You seem to be a little closer from what I’ve gathered. Maybe I’ve hit a sore spot.”
That’s what he deserves for all the torment and agony he feels when he can’t stop looking at him.
Castiel never lets him know he heard him. Not until Dean is blowing out 42 candles on a cake - which Cas and Sammy had united in forcing him to bake the night before as to actually celebrate his birthday for once, his Batman apron covered in icing and Cas’ ass sporting a handprint made of flour by the end of the ordeal - and when he looks up, he instantly looks

How do you want me?”
Dean raises his eyebrows and blinks again. Does he really need to spell it out for him? ”Well, fuck me if I’m wrong, but-”

Sam looks affronted. A book is open in front of him (he totally has the hots for
All the blinding lights come on at once as they walk into the middle of the entrance hall. Two large and mirrored staircases lead from the marble floor they find themselves standing on, connecting to an upper floor, and when they hear a sound from overhead, Dean realises with a start they’re standing underneath a huge, brass chandelier covered in crystals and lights.

Charlie’s eyes bugged out of her head. “Damn! I mean, I’m 100% all about the ladies, but some of these guys are objectively hot! Also: gross. So many dicks. Why are guys like this?”
Dean watched as the endless parade of omegas flitted past, trailing after the alphas like so many scraps . . .
Cas doesn’t try to break Dean’s grip, so instead he nuzzles at his jaw in an attempt to get Dean to look at him. Dean goes, but doesn’t open his eyes. Cas sighs and places a soft kiss on Dean’s cheek. It’s so tender Dean almost whimpers.
“In the end,” Rowena says, “it’s better to let it go.”
His fingers felt far too large and uncoordinated, his hands shaking, rattling the keys in his hand as he fumbled to get them in the door. After a few minutes of this, Castiel winced as the porch light flashed on and nearly fell through the door when Gabriel pulled it open from the inside.
It was hard not to move during the procedure, but the whole thing was over quickly and before he knew it he was dressed again and driving back home. The trigger shot was supposed to kick-start his heat anywhere between twenty-four and thirty-six hours after it was administered. Aside from the awful cramps, Dean wasn’t feeling any symptoms. Cas kissed him again until he shivered all the way down to his toes, but Dean was just starting to enjoy it when Cas moved away to try to leave for work. Dean grabbed him before he could get too far.
He’s been preparing his whole life for this, and he still has no idea what he’s walking into.
“Whoa, hey, she’s my guest,” Kevin said.
“Are you okay?” Dean asked. Castiel nodded.
He sat in silence for another long set of moments. Dean didn’t speak, but Cas didn’t hear any sound of movement, either. It must have been a mark of how much Dean’s heat had waned that Castiel was able to stand and move away from the door.
“I—are you . . . shit, Cas, I’m sorry,” Dean says, pulling away. Regret spears Castiel’s stomach as Dean pushes back and climbs out of bed. “Um, breakfast on the road today,” he says. Castiel turns over just in time to watch Dean adjust his trousers. Castiel will have to be careful when he rises to not have Dean notice that he’s in the same situation.
The nurse typed in a few more comments, then rose and said, “The doctor will be with you shortly.”
Cas howls as he fucks hard into Dean once, twice, then slams his knot into Dean, catching on his sensitive rim and locking them together as come floods Dean. Dean groans as Cas grinds into him, rubbing over Dean’s prostate, before Cas gets a hand on his cock and jerks him a few times. Dean flies over the edge, his own thin come painting his chest as another orgasm rocks through Cas, sending even more thick alpha come pumping into him. Cas crashes into Dean’s chest and Dean wraps his arms around him, petting Cas’s sweat-soaked hair as he places gentle kisses along Cas’s cheek.
“Cas—”
“I can’t tell you. I’m sorry, sir, and I know you’ll have to punish me after this, but . . . This is worth it. I hate that Dean has to go alone . . .” He trails off, studying Castiel’s face. “You’ve always cared for Dean, haven’t you?” he asks curiously.
Word traveled fast, and before Castiel had even actually agreed to help, they had set up a small recording area in Gabriel’s enormous garage. They set up space heaters, a computer desk, and a few comfortable chairs, and it wasn’t long before Castiel was installed in the space and, once again, interviewing omegas.
“So hot,” Dean says, and Castiel looks up, expecting him to be watching the same sight. Instead, Dean’s crimson eyes are on Castiel, mouth slack, cheeks flushed, and Castiel kisses him again.
Dean shook his head. “Don’t have that,” he said. Kevin stared at him.
“Yup, that’s me. How can I help ya?”
Castiel rubbed the back of his free hand across his eyes. “This is a very bad idea.”
Then Benny heads down the hallway, leaving Dean and Castiel alone. Dean brings up the flashlight app on his phone, illuminating the space a little.
“Yes. We met at the company Christmas party. I don’t believe you were able to attend.”
“What the hell happened?” Gabriel asked.
“They’re more like, mentors, I guess. My mom used to call it ‘grooming,’ and not in the mates kind of way.” Dean gave him a blank look, so Kevin sighed and continued. “They’re supposed to help us make the best impressions. Correct our behavior. They’re who we get called to when we misbehave, that sort of thing.”
“I’m just an academic,” he returned, dismissing it. Dean shook his head.
Cas shakes the snow globe one more time before standing and placing it at the far end of his collection next to a strip of photo booth prints featuring him and Dean.
“Oh, heya, Castiel,” Garth said. “Hannah came in this morning and these two were waiting on you. She called me over ‘cause they said they were here for interviews.”
And healing at a rate that is so very
,” Castiel huffed, snatching his phone back from Balthazar. He backed out of his profile and was immediately accosted with rows upon rows of profile pictures, each emblazoned with the number of feet away they were. Panic gripped Castiel’s heart. “For fuck’s sake, Balthazar, what if one of my
The ground under his feet slowly begins a gradual incline that grows steeper as he travels. Hoping that means he’s following the right path, he climbs. It grows darker as he does, though the sun should barely be past mid-day.
“Hello, gentlemen,” Dr. Banes said cheerfully, pulling up her rolling chair. She smiled at them both in turn. “How are you today?”
catching us naked on the couch.”
“Let me give you a ride home,” Dean said, gesturing to a town car with deeply tinted windows waiting by the curb.
Cas shuddered under the weight of the word. He turned his head toward Dean’s wrist as Dean placed his hand on Cas’s cheek. He would smell no fear, no hesitation. It was Dean’s turn to shudder as Cas nuzzled his wrist, a less lasting scent mark than the neck.
Cas worked a hand into his boxers, wrapping it tight around his knot, knees going weak as he massaged it gently. Pre-come leaked from the aching tip of his cock and he smeared it to ease the way. He groaned, leaning hard against the door.
“You’re so beautiful,” Michael breathed, gazing at Dean’s face in the moonlight. Dean blushed.
Two clear, pink lines. Pregnant.
“No, absolutely not.”
“And you’re all students?” Castiel asks as they make their way back to the living room. Sam stops by the kitchen to grab a beer, offering one to Castiel, who declines.
have things to get done,” she said irritably. “Then drop us off. It is a public place, and I could simply walk Dean back to the school when we’re done. It isn’t far.”
“Cas is actually a really nice guy, Dean.”
“It means I’m cursed. Every generation the oldest Winchester is cursed to carry a burden, ever since the first darkness invaded Winchester Wood. It isn’t affecting me much right now, but that’s because my dad did something stupid, or at least Bobby thinks so. And in order to fix it, we’re either going to free my family forever, or the curse is going to consume me until there’s nothing of
“You’re not broken, honey. You’re perfect.” Dean whined. “You are. You’re stunning, and strong, and smart, and made for me.” He rolled his hips, seeking a little friction, and was relieved when Dean responded by grinding back against him. “Sexy. Generous. Kind.” He punctuated every word with a slow thrust, building in intensity until Dean was panting against him. “My everything.”
Dean took a deep breath, then looked marginally less nervous so Cas continued.

His phone buzzed, but it was just a text from Charlie.
“Something already
“Of course not. You’ve officially reached ‘daddy’ status, I would hardly do anything to delegitimize you.”
“I studied a little bit of early Enochian. I know the basic syntax and pronunciation patterns.” He hesitates, glancing over at Dean, determination in those stupidly blue eyes. For the first time since they left the Bunker, he looks vulnerable and Dean is struck with a visceral need to protect him. “I’ll follow your lead, Dean,” he assures him. Dean swallows hard, mouth firmly shut, but he nods.
“And to your new grant!” Hannah added, saluting Castiel from across the table.
“Dean was right,” she said, then winked and left.
Castiel’s smile widens. “Cas?” he asks. Dean blushes.
“Nervous, Doc, not gonna lie,” Dean said, rubbing his hands on his thighs. Cas reached out to take his hand.
The nurse continued to stare at the screen. “All of these are questions that are necessary to complete your profile. I assure you, it will all be confidential and no one will have access—”
“Which is weird, even for him,” Charlie says before launching into a description of the hubbub they caused when they showed up at the gate.
“Oh, that’s Josie Sands, she’s one of the most sought-after white-collar defense and property lawyers in the state. They call her ‘Abaddon, the Destroyer.’ And that’s Eldon Styne, the middle Styne son. He has his own consulting firm, but rumor has it he’s still after Daddy’s money.”
Dean laughs quietly to himself when Cas awkwardly shuffles away but keeps his eyes glued on the pages from a distance. Bobby’s wearing gloves and turning the pages carefully as he moves from one segment to another. If Castiel could hang from the ceiling to keep track of what Bobby’s doing, he probably would.
Castiel managed to gather everything together, then stood with all his clothes in his arms. Dean was watching him with a strange look on his face. Castiel lifted his clothes in an indicative gesture.
“Right! So, suppressants, blockers, regular reports . . . I think that’s everything! You can see my secretary on your way out, she has the keys to your apartment and office space.”
“Hey—is that Cas’s coat?”
Dean’s eyes snapped up to Castiel’s at that. “That’s kinda dangerous to say, Cas.” Castiel shrugged.
For a moment, it looked like Cas might refuse, but whatever he saw in Dean’s eyes made him relent. Careful of the tubes and wiring attached to Dean, he crawled into the narrow bed and wrapped himself around Dean as best he could.
“Gilda told me she gave him Charlie’s number, because she . . . because
The deep rumble of thunder rouses Dean sometime in the early hours of the morning. The burning in his arm has returned, though nowhere near as intense as before Cas healed him. The thunder isn’t the only thing that woke him; the drumming of fat raindrops on his cloak is loud over his head. He reaches up to check to make sure it isn’t getting soaked enough that he’s going to end up rained on, when he realizes it’s bone dry. It’s strange, because his cloak is waterproofed, but not nearly enough to stay dry in the pouring rain. He sits up and looks around their camp, searching for Cas.
Castiel hesitated on how to reply. Should he respond with “hello?” Would that be too pedantic? Perhaps he should ask about the man’s profile, find a way to see if it was real? The man’s username was “Luke,” it listed his age as thirty-five, and there was a series of vaguely decipherable shorthand in the profile description that Castiel assumed translated to all his sexual interests.
Dean’s throat catches on the thing he really wants to ask next, so he clears his throat instead. “You just wanna watch me sleep. Like a creeper.” There’s that audible eye roll again, and this time Dean really does grin.

Charlie pinched her lips together in thought. “Okay, so what about this: you use your talents and expertise in interviews to gather
tonight, you can pick tomorrow.”
“I will say, you’re all idiots,” Benny says, clicking on a small flashlight that hangs from his keyring. “I’m going to bed. See ya in the mornin’, Dean. It was nice to meet ya, Cas.”
“This one’s different. Gotta be cast by an outsider. So it looks like you’ve got your Colette.”
“Gilda picked them up for me,” she said, depositing them in Dean’s lap. “Can’t go back to Vinehall in some alpha’s clothes.”
“Listen,” Dean said suddenly, avoiding Castiel’s gaze. “I know it’s been a long time, and . . . and I dunno if maybe you might feel different now, but—I, um—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“All right,” he said softly, closing the door and moving back to his own chair with the digital recorder. He sat, adjusting himself so he was as comfortable as he was going to get, given the situation, then pressed play on the recorder.
Dean’s knees felt weak. He stumbled over to the couch and sat down, head in his hands. This could fuck up
“All right, we’ll be able to skip the sexually transmitted infection testing, then. That will expedite the process, since you cannot be placed on suppressants until those results clear.”
“But, uh, we’ve been kinda trying? Maybe a little? Just, threw out my birth control and spent my heats, um . . . y’know, no condoms, and see what happened. But, uh, so far

“Tell me more about your brother.”
ends up naked? His palms are sweaty as he holds the cards, his heart racing with anticipation with each passing hand.
He’d been lucky. Dr. Milton hadn’t been terribly impressed with his topic, but Professor Moseley and Dr. Barnes had intervened on his behalf and gotten her to pass his prospectus. How conservative alpha Dr. Naomi Milton had ended up the Head of Omega Studies at Berkeley, one of the most liberal alpha universities in the country, was a great mystery. She was the gatekeeper for all graduate students on the way to their diplomas in the program, and Castiel could only hope that he would be able to convince her that his work was worthy when it came to his defense.
“Cas?” he calls out, but there isn’t a response. He crawls to the edge of his shelter and peers out into the dark and rain, trying to pierce the shadows to find the mage. “Cas, are you there?”
Dean can’t leave his bed on his own for another three days. Sam helps him to the bathroom and back as needed, but Dean is too embarrassed to ask to go to the one place he really wants to be.
Cas is still watching him curiously as he crawls into his makeshift tent and curls up on his bedroll. He’s vaguely aware of Cas muttering spells to himself as he walks a large circle around the tent before he drops off into a dreamless sleep.
When she left, he examined it. At first he thought she’d passed his own business card back to him, but on further inspection it was a folded note.
He hated the tone of skepticism in her voice. He imagined the arched brow that accompanied it. “We’ve had . . . a difficult start.”
“Just remind him about Colette.”
“Dunno what you mean,” Dean replies, but he shakes his hand out roughly before digging back into the hand pie Ellen had packed for him.
“What the fuck is this?”
“He’s a giant moose is what he is,” pipes Charlie, popping up next to Dean. Castiel looked at her and smiled, but Dean couldn’t look away from him.
“No, and you can’t be here. We’re only allowed to have authorized guests.”
She shook hands with Cas before nodding to them both and leaving.
“Hello, Dean!” Dr. Banes said softly as she walked in. Dean smiled even though he’d started to harbor a whole butterfly colony in his stomach. Dr. Tasha Banes usually did a good job of putting him at ease.
The peace didn’t even last through the day. Dean mentioned he’d been feeling some lower back pain over the last couple of days that he’d ignored as a symptom of late-term pregnancy, but then suddenly he was doubling over in the kitchen in pain. When Cas came home from work, Dean was gasping in the living room, hands pressed to his stomach.
Maybe next time Castiel will reconsider picking the most exclusive (and expensive) restaurant in town for a blind date.
“Don’t care,” he replied, reaching up and making quick work of Castiel’s zipper. Castiel hissed in a sharp breath as Dean pulled him free of his boxer briefs, aching cock twitching in the cool air. Dean chewed on his lower lip thoughtfully. “Condom?”
Gilda shrugged. “Well, Kevin told me you needed interviews with students here, and I’m a third year, so I will finish soon. You need different perspectives, yes?”
Dean manages to chuckle as they say good-bye, but as soon as Sam signs off, anxiety swells back up inside him. The invitation still sits on his bed, covered by his winter clothes, but Sam is going to a scholarship lunch today for a scholarship that’s only possible because of it. Because of what it represents.

“Yeah, now you get your first seat view,” Dean gruffs, still watching him. “What’s the verdict, huh? Ten outta ten?”
He wants it right

way.”
“There’s no such thing,” Dean corrects, louder, like it’s a sanction. He bites too hard sometimes.
Dean just wants to reach out and touch. He just wants to be nearer.
”Should we proceed with our mission?”
Placing his hand on Dean’s chest, Dean feels a prickling warmth spread throughout his body. It’s like a cup of coffee - spiked with vodka - on a cold winter day as it spreads from his chest and out to every limb, to his fingertips, his toes. It buzzes and sparkles.
Dean’s throat feels like sandpaper, but it seems like most of the dried blood is gone. He feels swollen all over, and remembering the events - which he’d rather not - he considers that he should probably stay away from reflective surfaces, because he probably wouldn’t even recognize himself if he tried.
When he opened the bedroom door, his knees nearly buckled at the sight. Dean was naked on the bed, writhing against the rumpled sheets in a makeshift nest. He had three fingers in his hole, his ass and thighs covered in slick while he humped desperately at the mattress.
Once he’s seated, Castiel chances a glance up at Dean and his face flushes. Even in the low light, Castiel can see that Dean’s irises are rimmed in alpha red, and he’s staring at Castiel like he’d like to eat him. Castiel pulls his own lip back between his teeth, then looks up at Dean from under his eyelashes like he’s seen omegas do on TV and in porn. Dean’s Adam’s apple bobs with the force of his swallow.
Right at one, there was a polite knock on the door. Cas and Hannah looked at each other, then Garth said cheerily, “I’ll get it.”
university, Dean.”
A soft clearing of the throat startles Castiel from his reverie, his gaze clearing to realize he’s staring openly at Dean. He looks quickly away only to meet Ellen’s knowing eyes and raised eyebrow.
“Oh my god, a caveman in couture,” Charlie laughed. Castiel smiled.
”What?”
”But I can be
He glances over at Thunder, then back at the building to point at the entrance. ”What if we go in from different angles, huh? I check the back window, and you check the front door,” he conspires, and stops to consider Thunderbird’s input. He leans his head to the side to try and find his gaze. ”Hullo? Earth to Trenchcoat?”
Thunderbird doesn’t respond to his panic, instead he looks around himself with squinting eyes. At first, Dean can only think he needs to start
God, he just wants everything. All at once. And he can’t have any of it because they’re on a roof and they’re very exposed to danger and logically not even supposed to be referring to each other by first names.
This time, using no unexplainable mojo, Castiel grabs his thighs and hauls him up, Dean’s legs coming hooked behind his waist. And this - woah - this is a position Dean could definitely stay in.
”Ouch,” Dean hisses, fake-injured, ”right in the heart. Alright, don’t freakin’ psychoanalyze me when I asked you first. What’s up? What’s your mumbo jumbo shit you’re working on? When are we in?”

”I don’t think he’s a vampire, no,” Sam offers. Dean closes his eyes again and gets comfy while Sam rustles with his equipment. ”I’m thinking, since he’s been spotted a lot less over the years, whoever he is doesn’t like to play the part as much as the last one he took over from.”
Dean fumbles for the pot. ”Well, then, this is for you. A thank you.” He pushes it towards him, like a dumbass who can’t express things. Just forcing a potted plant at him and hoping he accepts it. ”I was worried about you. You disappeared on me, Cas. I thought you were a goner for good.”
the actual endgame
convince himself his staring is in order for himself to monitor Thunderbird. So he could keep earning his place. Yeah, that’s a good reason. A good motive. Thunderbird could keep showing him how he wields a blade, for example, and if it’s still to Dean’s liking.
Dean can feel how his face lights up at that. It’s just gentle eyes observing each other then, and in a way, it’s like the rest of the world melts away.
”He was a gangster, Dean,” Sam continues, ignoring him. His eyes are wide as he turns around to him. ”Wealthy, a crime boss. He was wanted for killing other guys in the business. Competitors, I bet.”

”I was sure it was the right place to go,” Thunderbird murmurs with something that might have just sounded like regret.
”Don’t bi-erase me,” Dean blurts out way too loudly, just as the elevator grinds to a sudden, jerky halt.
Once, Dean kicked butt of a failed military experiment who was still cruising the base, so that’s kind of what he’s reminded of now. Guy had some super strength as an advantage but, you know, whatever, his stories usually end with lethally plunging nine inches of steel into a shitty person, so he wouldn’t exactly be a joy at parties.
He turns back to him, breaks into a smile. He places his hand on Thunderbird’s cheek. ”God bless you, Feathers, and your weird little brain. Never change.”
He turns around while swiping across his chin with the back of his arm. Castiel blinks at him in the doorway, dark hair sticking in multiple directions, Dean’s very unironed Led Zeppelin tee hanging off him.

Dean pulls back and fonds at Cas. ”Nice
He doesn’t say anything as he picks up the phone. He listens to the static and tries to make out what the situation is. An increasingly growing urge is to instantly go and check on Sam, hopefully still in the house and not kidnapped or something.
And the fact President Douchebag loves wearing a black, leather, nicely fitted goddamn trenchcoat was one of the first things that had struck Dean when he saw him. Because it struck him as
, but in the next second he’s lying outside on the grass, panting and spitting up the dust in his lungs, body feeling like he’s been beaten bloody, like he’s been in a car crash.
The silence settles between them, enough to even make Dean uncomfortable. Dean, regular ole Dean, but Demonblade as well; it shows in how he grinds his jaw and looks away into the distance, walking next to Thunderbird through the dimly lit backstreets. Dean is good at shoving his feelings away like a box in the attic, apart from when he’s with Thunder and it all goes to shit, boxes falling chaotically through the floor, breaking from the weight of too many put away. Well. At least it goes with his vigilante shtick to be salty.

”I think I’m getting a little delirious. But um.” His hand inches closer to Cas, his thighs in those slacks. Maybe it shouldn’t be hot. Or maybe Dean just likes a man in uniform. ”What if it wasn’t?”
”Yeah, yeah. Formalities, greetings, hola señor.” He collects himself and huffs a breath. ”Are you going to tell me how you got into my phone?” He studies Castiel’s face. ”You know what. Girl’s gotta have her secrets. I bet I wouldn’t understand even if you tried to explain.”

, glad that’s settled. Moving on...)
But Dean already had the bubble with three dots moving, indicating that he was composing a message to Cas in return. He blinked at the screen, anticipating.
Dean hadn’t been thinking about that instance, in particular, but still. ”Can’t deny you pop into my head sometimes too,” Dean admits, thinking back to some angry jerk-off sessions in the shower when Cas had pissed him off but looked too fucking hot when doing it. That’s just, normal. Whatever.
. He’s here, and he’s in a beautiful, midnight blue suit with an apron in front.
“That’s our front page,” he announces, and Dean sheepishly grins and rubs the back of his neck, blush creeping in from all the attention. Positive, nonetheless.

of Sam to have found the next best superhero in Kansas and set him up with Dean’s coordinates and to only tell Dean with a five minute heads-up. Dean had been loudly cursing down the phone when He, the Douchebag with the Big D (uh, wait, scratch that?) appeared in a flourish of burst light bulbs and sparks and glitter and Dean totally not flinching.
Thunderbird - Castiel - quirks his lips in what seems to be a genuine smile. Like this is an AA-meeting (which would be, um, Anonymous… Anarchists?) it naturally follows with: ”Hello, Dean.”

”And why not partake in the customs?” Castiel inquires softly.

yet. Hell, even his parents hardly were for a good chunk of that decade.
”This was good for you?” Cas asks, eyes big, and Dean is very happy to report he’s definitely still ruggedly sexy. ”You’re feeling happy?”
”I believe this behaviour is considered socially questionable,” Thunderbird points out, as if Dean’s sudden silence was telling enough.
”I do know,” Castiel corrects him, tilting his head. His silhouette against the big windows where the curtains are drawn makes Dean’s head spin a little bit too violently for his already damaged composure, and pride, trying to not sink to his knees right away and beg for Cas to let him touch him, just let him mouth over the front of his pants as that cowboy hat towers over him. ”I know what you like.”
“I don’t know what that has to do—”
Dean look at him and he isn’t sure that he gave his hand permission to reach out and grab him. He tries to keep his voice low, but he can’t help the furious hiss that floods out of him. “Were you ever going to tell me? Were you ever going to ‘man up’ and tell me your idiotic plan? Or was I just going to have to hear it from Sam when you were trapped at the bottom of the ocean? Forever? What kind of behavior is that if not cowardice?”
“Could you, um . . .” he trailed off, his eyes surveying Cas’s face. Bright eyes, chapped lips, flushed cheeks. “Would you like . . .?” He couldn’t finish.
“Stupid, stupid,
Sam crossed his arms and lifted his chin haughtily. “Oh, I only said I wasn’t covering for

. . .”
They’re laying together in the dark, skin to skin, Dean tracing lazy patterns on the arm Cas has thrown across his chest while Cas’s breath puffs softly against his neck. Sweat cools on his skin as Dean stares up at the ceiling of his bedroom, body aching in the best way.
“You boys staying long?” she asks, eyes lingering on Castiel for another moment before moving over to Dean.
“Then we figure it out,” Dean says. He takes a deep breath and reaches out to cup Cas’s cheek. Cas leans into his hand, giving Dean courage. “Cas, I don’t want to live afraid anymore. I want to start something, start living for me instead. And I thought, maybe . . . if you wanted . . . I could do that with you.”
Dean’s face went white. “You saw?” he asked.
“Dean Winchester,” Dean said, his smile warm but eyes incredibly cold. Castiel hesitated for a moment, then reached out and shook Dean’s hand. His palm tingled as they touched, but Dean took his hand away after barely a moment. He glanced around to make sure no one noticed, but it appeared no one saw anything out of the ordinary.
“I don’t need any help, Baz!” Castiel grumbled, reaching for his phone again as Balthazar deftly entered his code.
And there, under the violets, the hint of something sweet, almost like honey, tinged with something bitter. Dean was distressed.
“Hey, Cas, how’s all that fresh air and open space?”
“Mmm, perfect.”
Cas grabbed Dean’s hips hard, stopping his movement. This was building embarrassingly quickly, but he had gotten started before Dean, after all. “Fuck, Dean, gonna come . . . gonna come if you don’t stop.”
“I can tell when you’re you, you know.”
“I agree to have my story shared at the omega rally,” Sarah said clearly.
“Then why did you come here alone?” Castiel demands. Dean looks sheepish.
Sam shakes his head. “You just have to follow him. Don’t let him leave you behind.”
, to be interviewed. This was all his fault. He should’ve trusted his instincts; no alphas could be trusted. But there had just been something about him, something warm and soft that curled up in Dean’s gut when he thought about him, spoke with him . . .
“Are you sure?”
“Dean, I . . .” Cas’s breathing hitched. “I think you’re in heat.”
But . . . new security protocols, Charlie said. Ancient sigils no one can read, or find in any books. Weeks of searching, trying to find a way to bring back Dean and defeat Michael . . .
“I—yes, I mean, both you and your brother mean a great deal—”
“I’m glad!” Dean cried, and it took a long moment for Castiel to figure out that he’d spoken those thoughts aloud.
“You won’t find him out here.”
Castiel kisses Dean’s forehead as he sleeps. In the morning, they will find a better way.
“Dean” the profile read. Forty-seven, looking for dates and friends. “New in town” was all that the lower box said, framed just below that incredibly enticing package.
Dean is suddenly in Jack’s personal space and he can’t recall moving. “What do you mean?” he snapped.
Before Charlie could answer the door slammed open and two uniformed police officers came striding inside. “Stay seated, folks, this is a police matter,” said one when Charlie went to stand. A burly man with a blondish beard and a felt newsboy cap came out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on a towel.
Cas’s heart skipped. “Did you tell them what happened?” he breathed. Dean’s head whipped up, and Castiel lost his breath at the sudden eye contact.
Castiel perked up, noticing for the first time that Dean was wearing a pair of Cas’s sweatpants and an old t-shirt. Something restless quieted down inside him at the sight.
“What the fuck, Castiel? Shit, you’re
“He, uh . . . he didn’t finish the semester,” Sam says awkwardly.
Gabriel snorted. “I guess us little ol’ betas can’t be in hearing for the big-bad-alpha convo, huh, Zackie-boy?”
“Better, thanks to you.” Dean shrugged.
Something passes behind Sam’s eyes as he cuts himself off. Dean’s gut twists and it’s so painful it brings tears to his eyes.
“Then what do you say, Cas? Wanna find a future with me?”
But there was something, some reason . . . His heart raced, palms sweating,
Dean freezes, white-knuckling Cas’s sleeves at the wrists. “You—what do you mean?”
Dean snorted. “Yeah, well, it’s, what . . . fifth time’s the charm, I guess?” Cas caressed the sensitive skin of Dean’s inner thigh, continuing to lay soft kisses up and down the part of Dean’s leg he could reach. He didn’t say anything, though. Dean had made it quite clear where Cas could stick his platitudes, thanks.
Sam’s exclamation broke Dean from his thoughts in time to see the pair of looming wrought-iron gates rise up out of the trees before them. True to the school’s namesake, massive amounts of vines twisted through the gates and along the fence that ran off into the distance beside them. Bobby pulled up to a speaker box and pressed the button.
The pain is excruciating. There’s a white-hot dagger slicing straight through his gut, there’s electricity jolting into his fingers, and he can actually
“Yes, Dean, I am rather competent at magic.”
He couldn’t do this. Accepting admittance was one thing, but changing everything about himself? And how much could he owe this alpha? Shit, he was in so deep.
“Come here?” he asks gently, reaching out a hand. Castiel walks carefully toward him, standing close. Dean slides his hand over Castiel’s elbow, and Castiel shivers at the contact. “You’re beautiful,” Dean says. Castiel blinks up at him, shaking his head.
“You could’ve just told him no, then. Why the big scheme?”
,” he muttered to himself as he read the introduction. “
Cas’s arms are steady and firm around his waist as Cas presses up behind him, holding him close. The tension in Dean’s body falls away and he nearly collapses into the angel’s arms. Cas doesn’t say anything for a long time, and for once, Dean allows himself to be held.
“Yup. Started showing up a few days ago. My, uh . . . my dad had one just like it. It’s tied to the bloodline.”
“We’ll manage, Mr. Winchester.”
Charlie sighed deeply. “Okay, fine. It goes against everything in my nature, but I will respect your wishes.”
Charlie and Rowena end up staying a few more days, and Dean keeps to himself. Without another case, he tries not to wallow, tries to distract himself from any of the memories that might escape his nightmares and pop up during the day. The pile of laundry in his room is growing, and he’s too lazy to take books back to the library when he’s done with them. One night it’s so cold he drags Cas’s coat out of the pile and huddles under it while he sleeps. After that, he takes to putting on a sweater he found in it, too, for warmth.
Castiel realized that he’d been holding on to Mr. Winchester’s hand just a bit too long a little too late, snatching it back as he exclaimed, “You’re Mr. Campbell’s ward?” Winchester blushed and shrugged, shoving his hands into his pockets.
Cas glared at him. “I wasn’t
“Did you hear me, Mr. Winchester?”
“Oh, Gilda is fine,” she said. “Thank you.”
his brain rattling against the inside of his skull.
Dean swallowed a few more breaths, then finally looked around at his surroundings. He was in the middle of the quad, which was still lush and green even with the impending change in the weather. There was a bench nearby, under a pretty shade tree, so Dean moved over and sat down. There were hardly any other students around, which gave Dean a little privacy to open his envelope.
“Hey, Cas.”
“Happy birthday, Cas!” she said. He kissed her on the top of the head and hugged back.
They were called in together, but then Dean was shown to a procedure room while Cas was taken further down the hall for a much more fun activity.
In the end, their deal hardly even mattered; Cas fell asleep long before the final action sequence. Dean noticed when Cas’s head drooped onto his shoulder and subtly turned the volume down a little. A weather alert went off on his phone: snow and wind to continue through the night, intermittent blizzard conditions. Maybe if they were snowed in, Cas wouldn’t have to go to work tomorrow and they could spend the whole day on the couch watching Christmas movies . . .
The message screen popped up immediately, the profile picture showing a well-defined chest and cut abs, clearly taken in a bathroom mirror but only from the neck down. Castiel’s libido sparked in interest despite himself, though he knew that there was no way to know if the picture actually showed the man who owned the profile. The body of the message itself read:
. Someone has carefully lined the walls in waterproofed, polished wood panels. There’s a low level of magic emanating from them, so clearly they were erected by someone with magical skill. The floor is made of well-worn wooden planks, again protected by some elemental spell that is keeping them dry and clear of any mildew or rot. Shelves are stuffed haphazardly throughout the room, each of them crammed so full of books that they’re overflowing. If it was spread out in a space as large as the Bunker’s library, it might even dwarf their public collection. There are far more protected texts stored in the Bunker’s vault, of course, and by the look of these volumes they might belong better there than in the open library. Some of them are new, but many of them have weathered leather spines and a few are splattered with suspicious stains that Castiel would rather not think about. The whole room buzzes with unfamiliar, but not unfriendly, magic. It doesn’t feel quite like Sam’s, but there’s a particular edge to it that feels similar. It’s earthy, stubborn . . . Castiel is pretty sure he’d like the caster, if they ever met.
“Never a
“I thought I already did.”
Castiel looks shrewdly at Dean. A mercenary who often takes contracts to transport rare magical items and missives of a delicate nature for the Society, Dean is a shrewd man but he hasn’t proven himself a dishonorable one. They’ve forged a long friendship, though they have little in common, but Castiel can’t allow himself to be distracted by his feelings for Dean if something is truly amiss.
“Open door policy on mixed secondary genders without a chaperone, you nitwit,” Crowley said. He rolled his eyes. “God, I’ve got another one who didn’t even bother to read the handbook.”
Kevin’s eyebrows proceeded to disappear into his hair. “Wow, dude. You are so fucked.”
“We light candles, then! C’mon, guys, this is awesome!”
“I’ve got you,” Dean said, rubbing gently along Castiel’s flank to soothe him, circling his prostate at the same time. Castiel whined as his cock dribbled pre-come into his too-tight underwear. He was exhausted, his body was thrumming, and now he just wanted Dean to get
“Sure I did. I mean, I didn’t spend anything on it, so don’t thank me too much, but I figured hey, we finally found something you like, so . . .”
After they’d finished eating, Gabriel insisted on bringing Castiel to his new home. Castiel couldn’t help his dropped jaw at the sight.
He’s standing there in that stupid armor, face shadowed in the dim very-early-morning light, and Dean feels a rush of affection that he stomps down and replaces with the fury from before. Yeah, fury is a much safer emotion.
But it wasn’t a command. Not an alpha command. Dean was sure Castiel would never use those, anyway.
“Well, I hope for your
Cas gazed at him, guarded, but something appreciative in his eyes. “You look dashing,” Cas said.
“Huh, that’s funny, ‘cause I’m pretty sure I still got a pulse.”
Every fiber of his being recoiled at the beige monstrosity before him. The car was
“Welcome to the club, man,” he said. “Oh, hey, someone dropped this off for you.”
“What, the alpha who runs the largest finishing school for omegas in the world, is a giant dick?” Castiel said. “I’m incredibly surprised.”
“You know the contract. A guardian answers the call of their charge until the connection is broken.”
“Don’t we just know it? He’s the best mechanic we’ve got,” Marcy replied, ringing up the total in the register. Dean shot her a scathing look.
Dean shuddered at the thought.
Cas’s room. Two doors down.
“This is about your sister, isn’t it?”
“Just shut up and drive, Charlene.”
Castiel watched his whirlwind of an older brother sweep into the restaurant and sighed. The years had not changed him at all. Clearly he was a little older than he’d been the last time Castiel saw him, his hairline a bit higher and middle a bit thicker, but the glint in those toffee-brown eyes was exactly the same. He stood to shake hands, but of course Gabriel grabbed him and pulled him into a tight hug. The small beta smelled like cotton candy and fresh-cut grass, just like Castiel remembered, and immediately Cas relaxed into the hug. They may not have grown up together, but Gabriel’s light scent reminded Castiel of home.
“Thank you,” Cas says quietly. Dean ignores the way his body lights up at the contact.
“Hey, assholes!” she called. She had her phone pulled up and was filming. “Keep going if you want to end up on the national news!”
Castiel waited for the reply, but when it didn’t come through immediately he went back into his room and started to take off the ridiculous outfit. He nearly jumped when his phone buzzed with a notification.
Dean’s soul shimmered golden just beyond mortal sight. Castiel smiled softly. “Yes.”
“Hello, Charlie,” Castiel said, handing Dean his drink.
He’s fully hard now, cock just a little too big for an omega, and nothing stops the smell of slick from hanging around like a cloud. Dean is staring, the red bleeding further into his irises. The longer he looks, the more Castiel wants him to touch.
His fingers absently trace the bandage still wrapped around his wrist, and when he sees Dean’s eyes flick toward it, he tugs his sleeve down roughly. Something dark flashes over Dean’s features before he schools them again. “We’re leaving in ten,” he says, and then stalks off down the hall.
By the time the town car pulled up to Castiel’s apartment, his lips were swollen from kisses, hands tangled together with Dean’s.
“Hey, I’m standing right-
. Shit, Gilda told me she gave you my number, but I never thought . . .”
Her eyes were earnest, and open, and Dean had been seeing her for the last six years, ever since he and Cas were mated and moved across the country so his alpha could become a college professor. Still, though, old habits died hard and even though Dean had called to make this appointment for this
Dean seethed in the passenger seat. “I should be driving,” he grumbled. “Riding shotgun in my Baby . . .”
“Blue raspberry,” Castiel replied with a smirk. Dean chuckled.
“We didn’t nearly burn it down,” Cas protested, but Dean raised an eyebrow. “We
“No, thank you. I’ve never been fond of caviar.”
“Who was she?” Castiel asks.
“Wow, what a dick,” Dean mutters, each line conjuring up more of an image of some spoiled trust fund kid with a major alpha superiority complex.
“So, Castiel,” he’d said, leaning back in the interview room. “Tell me something about growing up as an alpha, a story you’d like people to hear.”
Immediately, Cas knew these interviews would be different. Before, Sarah had been clinically detached, describing her circumstances almost in the third person, as though they happened to a sample of omegas, instead of directly to her. Now, Sarah was passionate, open, and above all,
Kevin and his beta friend Charlie had been set up in the common area with video games and more junk food than Dean had seen since he got to Vinehall. Apparently, Charlie had brought in the contraband.
“Gonna fuck me, Cas?” Dean asked, cock starting to fill again at an omega’s quick refractory rate. “Gonna bounce me on your cock?”
, Castiel thought. The song ended, and Castiel stepped back to lead Dean off the dance floor. Dean squeezed his hand, but when Castiel started to walk away, Dean didn’t move.
Dean winked, sending a shiver through Cas. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
That leaves more questions than it answers for Cas, Dean knows. “You said you don’t possess magic.”
“Wh’ time isit?” Dean asked blearily on one of those mornings.
“Um, okay, so first we gotta get your heat bag.”
“Oh, uh, nothin’. Nothing. Just been a while, thought I’d call.”
“Well, at least we won’t die of scurvy.”
things. At first, it doesn’t seem like there is any kind of a pattern to the collection, but over time Cas finds himself drawn to small, shiny things. Sam calls it his “magpie tendencies.” It amuses Cas to think of himself as a bird, building a nest in his own little corner of the Bunker. He arranges his collection carefully on the shelves behind his bed, reorganizing things from time to time as the mood strikes him.
When the waiter left the check Castiel had hardly reached for his wallet to offer cash to split the bill when Dean laid down a shiny platinum credit card.
“Come on my knot, Dean,” Cas commanded, and Dean worked his hips harder, rubbing the knot, now almost fist-sized and trapped inside Dean, against his sensitive rim. Cas reached between them to wrap his hand around Dean’s cock, spit and slick and pre-come easing the way as he jacked him rough and hard until Dean cried out, spilling hot over Cas’s fist. Dean’s channel spasmed, milking Cas’s knot as Cas’s pleasure surged and he came, spilling deep inside Dean.
we own them, but we’re gonna make it illegal for any of them to work. And then, we’re gonna make all the suppressants illegal, and force omegas not to wear any blockers so they’re sitting ducks for alphas when they’re in their heats,
“How do you know Gilda?” Cas asked.
Dean’s car was warm and quiet as they both slid into the backseat. Castiel gave Dean his address, and Dean leaned forward to give it to the driver. When he sat back, he was gazing at Castiel again. That strange electricity buzzed under Castiel’s skin as he watched. Slowly, Dean’s hand worked its way across the seat and grasped Castiel’s
“Thank you,” Cas says genuinely. Dean smiles a little.
An awkward silence descends on all of them. Eventually, Charlie clears her throat and says, “Well, I, uh—I’m gonna go over there.”
“I certainly hope we won’t be gone that long,” Castiel replies. Sam doesn’t say anything, which, when he looks back on it later, should have been a sign.
in heat.”
Cas shook his head as best he could with it hanging limp from his shoulders. As questionable as it was, Gabriel’s advice seemed to be helping. It only took a handful of minutes of deep breathing for Castiel’s panic to start to recede. His breathing steadied and the spots disappeared from his vision, enough that he could slowly press his way back to sitting. Once the dizziness passed, exhaustion hit him and he collapsed against the sofa.
“Please, make yourself comfortable Miss Fay.”
Shit. “Uh, yeah. You send stuff to the University there all the time. C’mon, we gotta get goin’.”
“You’re amazing, Cas,” Dean said. Cas’s gaze flickered toward him briefly, a flush gathering on his cheeks.
Dean watches the pups chase each other for a moment before Castiel finally speaks.
At least, it had been a day ago.
They sat on their own separate beds, with the lights off, ignoring the other’s presence. If one or the other happened to sneak a hand under their own sheets and relieved the tension, then the other didn’t need to know or acknowledge what was going on.
The female was named Sarah Blake, and she was from a prominent New England family. She’d been raised her whole life to believe in the concept of the omega companion, and when she presented the family had been thrilled. She didn’t have any siblings, so her connection through companionship and eventual mating would be their hope to carry on the family legacy. She was studying art and art history, since that was her family’s business, but she knew she would be unlikely to use it. Castiel found himself drawn into friendly debates with her on the merits of certain artists and art in the home, and he had to stop lest the interview material become unusable. When the interview concluded, she surprised Castiel by shaking his hand.
“Isn’t this stuff supposed to have, like, twice the alcohol content of regular wine?” Dean asked idly.
“Fuck, Dean, the candles—”
As he tucked himself into bed and peeled the plastic off the latest edition of his favorite academic journal, suddenly his apartment felt too quiet, a little too empty. He sighed, glancing at his phone on the charging plate next to his bed. The screen was dark, but Castiel had to admit he was a little tempted. Would anyone message him? He should just delete it, especially thinking about who might be on there to see . . .
And Dean had moaned Cas’s name last night.
Suddenly, Dean was naked in front of Cas. He was miles of tanned and freckled skin, and a gorgeous cock that hung heavy from his hips. Cas looked up into uncertain green eyes and smiled.
Castiel gasped sharply as Dean prodded at his entrance with two slick fingers, spreading the lube and working him open. It was too shallow to feel spectacular yet, but Castiel had always been sensitive and it had been a long time. He relaxed into Dean’s expert touch, moaning and whispering encouragement to get Dean where he wanted him most. Dean leaned down and pressed kisses into his back, along his shoulder blades. He stroked Castiel’s cock slowly, just enough to keep him on edge as he opened him up.
, he still had to clench his fists and look away from her.

But Dean was amazing. And he was going to be an amazing father. Cas just hoped that they were lucky this time.
“Do you know your way in these woods?”
“All right, boys. Now it gets interesting. Folding is no longer safe. If you fold, you lose something, too!”
“Um . . .” Cas managed, aware that he’d been asked a question, at least. Green-eyes laughed lightly, showing perfectly straight, white teeth.
“Can you tell me a story about growing up as an omega? Something from your childhood, maybe?”
Sometime in the afternoon, the door opened bringing a blast of cold air with it. Castiel looked up to chastise whoever it was, but his rebuke caught in his throat.
Cas’s dick was fully hard now, tenting his sheets and aching. He breathed deeply, concentrating on the film, holding off from touching himself until he couldn’t stand it anymore. He imagined Dean wrapping one of his beautiful hands around his own cock, wrist twisting at the head, fist flying over the flesh as he drilled his fingers into his sweet spot. The quick creaks from the bed beside him fueled his imagination, and Cas finally gripped his throbbing erection, biting his lip to keep from moaning, as he slowly and firmly worked his hand up and down his length. Dry, he had to grip tight, but the pressure helped build the tension in his gut. Just barely, he heard Dean beside him, Dean’s breaths coming quicker, the ever-so-subtle squeak of springs in time with them.
He chews his bottom lip and Cas doesn’t meet his eye, still considering the new information. Son of a bitch, why does he have to be so gorgeous too? “How old would
”So.” Cas inches closer and suddenly his own hand is curling around the inside of Dean’s sensitive thighs. His head rolls back instantly; he’s fucking touch-starved, he’s ravenous, and so
are, Dean.”
”Dude, do you mind? I just…”
Castiel is just passing Dean’s bedroom that night when he hears a noise from within its walls, his voice softly inquiring.
Dean silences him with another kiss. Cas makes a sound against his lips, surely a muffled word but to Dean it could as well be a moan. Then Cas kisses him back harder, trying, figuring it out, and pulls Dean closer to himself by his waist. Dean lets himself be manhandled very gratefully, moaning back against his lips to prove he can do even more than that.
”No,” Castiel says so quickly, Dean honestly can’t tell if it’s meant to be said... jokingly? Maybe Dean needs to open his mind to more possibilities, then, such as, the actual Devil being an angel who walks the Earth among them.
. But, he decides not to dwell on it.
, where’d you—”
Dean still tests his luck, jabbing his finger into the button. A lonesome buzzing greets him. No handymen available. Nada.
Dean is good at breaking into safes. He guesses he’s not too good at working invisible codes, though, so what the hell? How can this chucklehead (scary, bossy chucklehead) be such a pro at something that logically should be, uh, goddamn impossible?
Castiel hums something affirmative, and seems to sink into the mattress even more, pliant and soft. Or maybe it’s just Dean drifting calmly to sleep.
A step forward is the last mistake. In the blink of an eye, he’s suddenly pushed up against the wall.
He’s turned on enough by the fact he’s even strong enough to both keep him restrained and fuck him at the same time. Everything else is just a cherry on top. And Cas quickens the speed so that Dean openly pants, head thrown back and nails digging into his back.
what’s going on, do you?”
Are there bigger things to worry about? Yes there are, but fear not because somehow, he’ll find room for worrying about that too.
”He has nothing to do with this,” Cas deadpanned. ”Sam, must I really remind you this is very urgent? I haven’t explained to Dean it’s not someone else I love, but him. What should I do?”
”When I fell down it was October 15th, 1929,” Thunderbird continues in the usual, monotone rasp. As if that’s just, a
”You’re also…” Eyes fleeting to Dean’s lips; it’s like he feels it rather than sees it. He burns. ”Remarkable.”
”Oh.” Dean flies back to vertical position, brushing his sleeves off. He’s delirious. Maybe he just wants the guy to crack a
The performance is disrupted by an ear-splitting noise.
Dean puts a finger to his lips. ”Let’s not get into those details right now. But thanks.”
He blinks at the girl suddenly in front of him, shaking him out of the trance. He writes his alias with a winky smiley on the back of an old newspaper and gives it back to her, before she’s squeezing into his side and taking a picture.
A man stands there, hunched, hands around his neck, and Dean immediately starts sprinting before he even sees the blood gushing out of the wound between his pale fingers.
Those blue eyes meet his green ones. A stormy, uncertain ocean between them. ”You don’t believe me.”
so you do that whole thing when you push me up against the wall and be all hot and shit.” He flicked his eyes back at him, explaining with intent. “Angry sex in the end is the only good thing about screwing up. It should follow immediately after.”
”Yeah.” No service for the metal box.
Castiel’s face softens significantly. He pushes the pot with the peace lily into his arms. “I think this was the one you liked. You seemed happier. Let’s proceed to check you out.”
With slick sounds he jerks his hand along their lengths and Dean’s thighs start to fucking quiever, so close to coming already. Dean curses and wrenches his head back, exposing his neck again for Cas’ sinister lips to suck more dark red marks. Like claiming he’s his.
And Dean wants to kiss him so bad it
... Not fighting anymore. Not fearing for each other’s life.
He feels tears mix with the blood rolling down his face; broken lip, broken nose, black eyed and bruised. Will angels come to collect him? Will Valkyr? Wouldn’t that be ironic?
Suddenly the lights flicker back on, and Dean’s stomach drops as the lift starts whooshing downwards again, numbers lit up and ticking down.
Dean’s hands start working to find a zip on his suit, because it needs to come off. Now. Castiel heaves the burden off of him and unzips it quickly - thank fucking Christ almighty it’s a two-piece - so that Dean’s hand comes underneath the fabric and finds his hard cock, Castiel stuttering breath; a sign he’s doing something right.
as you want.”
Dean bites his lip for a moment, smirking around it. ”If you say so, man, you know I couldn’t say no. Just uh- don’t leave me tied up like this, willya?” He scrunches his nose at the thought. ”I think Sammy wouldn’t be too happy to be the one to undo me from a kinky situation.”
However, there’s a question that rings like a noise of clarity in his steamed up brain, a voice of reason, thank god. Because
”All I’m saying is,” Sam sighs pointedly, ”I don’t have anything like
”Dean,” Cas said, rising from his seat. ”I want to have a bee farm with you.”
”Will you ever tell me what makes you so sad?” Castiel asks gently, like it’s a soft caress to a tear-stained cheek.
”That’s nice,” Cas muses, the tone in his voice so soothing. ”I’ve been thinking about it all day since you said it.”
want this to happen, right now immediately. So…”
And that about sums it up. To: God. From: Dean. Hey, man, stop messing with the natural order of things. Elevators take you from point A to point B. They don’t suddenly stop working. When no one is in the goddamn building. Do better. Sincerely, fuck you.
(He thinks this magic man might just have broken his hand if he’d tried.)
, that surely gets Dean’s attention to send sparks flying in his mind. He sits up straighter like he’s such a good boy, the goddamn

Well, they probably wouldn’t be happening at

They become a mess of tangled limbs after that; soft sighs, moans, and a very squeaky bed hitting the wall repeatedly. Too impatient with the slow, thorough thrusts, he eventually groans, almost exasperatedly, or desperately, and wrestles himself to the top.
Dean sleeps for days.
The papers show up soon enough to capture the heroic deed. It means camera flashes, reporters trying to get an interview. It means Dean staring longingly at Thunderbird, just two feet away, wondering if it will show in his eyes in the pictures. Just how much he fucking stupidly
”I killed him before,” Thunderbird says promptly, with an edge of resentment. ”It was 57 years ago. What’s really going on, is what you’re wondering? I’m not sure. But it’s all happening again. All in the same places, even when abandoned.”
Blinking rapidly, Dean stands there. Just stands. ”So fame really gets to you, huh?” he breathes, flustered over such a strange, unabashed implication, when all Dean had referred to was becoming
”Brad Pitt’s kinda hot, huh,” Dean figures, after a totally relevant train of thought connects the quote to the correct movie in his memory bank. Or, spank bank.

that to each other.”
”Still I see something in you that’s so sad,” Castiel adds with something imploring in his eyes. ”Something you hide. You think badly of it, I can tell. And still, Dean, you’re the greatest human I ever met in all my years on Earth. You have the sweetest soul I have ever seen.”
His heart is doing somersaults and backflips and ninja kicks into outer space as he dances with the most beautiful man he knows. He can’t believe he has the privilege to, to touch him, to be close to him. To see Castiel’s soft smile and realise his eyes are resting on his lips as well.
Because, he doesn’t just go straight for it. No, Dean has to hitch on his breath with the way he starts by going down his torso - slow, slow, nimble fingers, ghosting - then rubbing down the front of his jeans to make him quiver. It’s like a cry of

Cas smiles shyly at him. ”Did I not say that right?”
”Maybe if you can convince me,” he murmurs eventually.

He comes back down from the high with his chest still heaving. Cas still pumping, his panting breath hot over Dean’s skin.
. ”What do you like about them? What would I do?”
, right?”
”That’s a speculation or an opinion?”
“Call 911,” Dean orders Thunderbird sharply when he knows his attention is back. He can’t let these things get to him. The man is dying, and he wrenches his head towards him, his face now much more blank; he finished. “Phone’s in my belt. Do you know the address?”
Dean backs away gingerly, amusement like a glint in his eye as he openly smirks at the alien way in which the other man stares ahead. Even his body language is kind of weird at the best of times, like he doesn’t understand his own limbs, like someone wearing too-big shoes or something. Dean imagines an actual green alien sitting inside his body like it’s a costume. Dean has maybe seen
”I don’t believe you’re in a position to make any commands,” Cas tells him against his skin and, yeah, fine, Dean loves being bossed over.
Dean breathes out; it could be mistaken for a laugh, but it sounds wrong.
”Yeah well,” Dean mutters, refusing to get flustered just because he likes Cas a little more right now than he did last week. ”Rich dudes kind of scare me anyway. Life fast, eat trash, I say. I couldn’t save up to this even if I tried to be frugal.”
”No inappropriate touching while I call,” he continues, a murmur against his temple where he’s planted a thousand kisses before, ”capiche?”
now, must be swollen and leaky and so incredibly needy.
”Sure,” Dean confirms again, a little more breathlessly.
Thunderbird wraps his hand around Dean’s wrist, his touch hot on his skin, and within a second they’re back to the top of the building they were hours earlier, above pizza place and flower shop, above life with all its turmoil. He doesn’t let go immediately, and Dean revels in the feeling, the tiniest touch, before they drop their hands to their sides again. The moment passed.
Dean moans into it, with surprise - no,
Dean doesn’t have to even move. Suddenly his cassette player crackles and the next best mixtape from his self-made collection starts playing loudly. It’s
”No, you won’t,” Sam corrects good-naturedly. ”Because - don’t look - but our prince charming is just joining us.”

”Ow. Foul play!”
It’s like he could be hearing a cheesy, poppy love song at the end of a rom com, at least that’s how his traitorous body makes him react; knees weak, gulping hard. God, he’s
”I want you to fuck me,” Dean tells him through the smirk, watching him take a breath. He fumbles at the front of Cas’ suit with hands not yet restrained, so that Cas moves closer, into the touch. ”But I don’t know if I’d be breaking some sort of laws of the universe. You know. Cosmic police coming for my ass because I slept with an angel.”
”Terrible,” Dean confirms, nodding solemnly. ”
”Yeah, baby,” Dean moans as he feels his pace quicken, that he’s edging closer himself. ”Do it. Ride me just like that. You’re so

. And still.
”What the hell?” Dean laughs, picking confetti out of his hair. ”Did you guys make that?”
”So you hacked my phone?” Dean groans, rubbing his eyes. ”Jeez, Cas. That’s real considerate of you.”
he grits out, ”then don’t say anything at all.”
he finishes in a chuckle. Dean glares. ”More importantly…” Cas sighs, looking back ahead at the wall. ”Your secret’s safe with me, if that’s what you want.”
Dean almost wants to call Sam immediately to tell him about it. Sam is kind of like the Oracle to his Batman, monitoring from home, but if Demonblade really was like Batman he’d have a cool headset built into his mask instead of a phone in a toolbelt, and if that was the case, calling his personalized-computer-nerd would be that much easier. He’d also be able to appear out of nowhere, a badass shadow vigilante, world’s greatest detective… but somebody already took that gig from him. Appearing out of thin air and then blipping out of existence again.
”When will you explain your handy dandy powers?” he asks, still studying the walls around them, dark and grimy. ”And more importantly, are they good for kicking ass?”
by that. President Douchebag is learning to be human? ”Oh, alright. Thanks.”
”As good as you’ll feel in 4 years, assbutt,” Dean deadpans. ”Your point?”
“I see,” Thunderbird says in between them, as if he’s getting a fascinating result on his lab experiment. “This is how you show
Dean looks around himself in panic. “I’m looking for uh, some flowers.”
”Don’t have, uh… stuff,” Dean admits, realising his hand has stilled and he keeps rubbing then, which makes Cas take another deep breath.
”I don’t think we agreed on registering a

Dean does as told, not wasting a second of the time. ”Shoot.”
”Maybe you should do me first,” Cas reasons, but his hand dips into his boxers and curls around his hard dick. Dean immediately bucks into it with a groan, but it turns frustrated when he doesn’t move. ”Open up your pretty lips again. What do you think about that?”
bad, Dean doesn’t know. Which fucking sucks because he doesn’t want anymore stitches done in a makeshift hospital bed and performed by his baby brother armored with his dental floss, so, a little heads up would be nice. But apparently that’s too much to ask.
”Pull off,” he orders abruptly and Dean does, eyes glazed and lips raw and open as he jerks him off the rest of the way, watching with big eyes.
Siri, this isn’t right, that’s not what I asked of you.”
”I don’t doubt that you’ve set up great security for your company, Dean,” Cas emphasizes, fairly exasperated as he looks at him, ”but logically, if the power is out, I would assume the cameras are too.”
