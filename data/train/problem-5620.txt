When he opened them again, his body felt like it didn’t belong to him. The arms on him were gone. His body seemed to have curled into itself, while he slept. The darkness covered him and provided a protection and safety net that he couldn’t create for himself. His hand reached for the reactor and felt a crack in it.
Steve frowned, but followed wordlessly as Bruce led him to the conference room where the rest of the Avengers, excluding Clint where. Fury and Coulson were also in the room, sitting beside one another. Natasha’s face was set in a grim and Thor seemed just as upset, arms crossed firmly over his chest.
“You don’t understand. Tony was everything to Ryder then he was just cut of his life without a second glance. So Ryder went to Africa to study abroad and then found his place there. Later he found out the Starks had died in a car crash and decided to take over the CMPNY. No one had much complaint, since they never truly knew why this intern had left. And since he was rather close to Howard, they all figured he would be a fine option. After all Ryder was pretty influential,” she said softly.
Would he leave if he was his only reason?
She stood up and got in his face. Grabbing his chin, she said, “You will most definitely not write a letter and hope things just solve things on their own. You did that last time and it didn’t solve anything. Try again.”
This time when he was pulled up he heard the door creak open. His eyes couldn’t focus, but he felt good when a blanket covered him. It didn’t stop the shivering, but it did help keep him warm. He heard doors slam and people yelling at one another. He heard a voice screaming at Miriam.
“Of course I’m saying no Nat,” he quickly said breaking out of his brief panic. “I just…I can’t let him propose in public. Fuck. Do me a favor start spreading the word that everyone needs to leave. Let Pepper handle the journalists. I need to go speak with Ryder in private and tell him that it’s over.”
“Shh, slow down Tony speak slowly you’re overexerting yourself,” Cali said.
He had made it five minutes, trying to stop himself from going back…going against Fury’s orders. Unfortunately, he hadn’t been satisfied the way he left the interrogation room nor had he been content with Fury’s option of bringing Tony into conversation with that man.
“Who would have thought this would be how best men are decided,” Tony said laughingly.
“Mr. Stark.”
“Cake!” Steve shouted.
“Ah, so you’re going to eventually adopt him,” Rhodey said. “Well, I’m thankful that your kid was the one to finally answer my call, seeing as how you’ve been ignoring me.”
“Look I didn’t call you with the intention of making you upset or making you cry. I just wanted to remind you that it’s okay to take time toward forgiveness. You don’t have to forgive them all in a day, a week, or hell even a year. You don’t have to feel rushed Tones,” Rhodey whispered softly.
For whatever reason, he wanted to keep Steve away from his reaction of it all.
“And so you let him in, just that easily?”
“Ah, you still cannot let that go,” Ryder lightly commented. “I had really hoped you would have let go of these childish grudges.”
“Lights out, bitch,” Clint snickered.
“What’s wrong with yours?” Tony tensely bit back to hide his surprise at the winter soldier lounging in his kitchen.
Tony didn’t ask much for anything after that.
Bucky threw off his jacket and sent a lethal smile to Steve. Steve rushed forward.
“Merchant, fuck Tony. Merchant,” he heard Steve say, as the doors swung open.
Natasha watched Tony’s expression. And she knew him long enough and had studied him long enough to know that he wasn’t partly joking. So Natasha playfully rolled her eyes.
“You’re good with them you know,” Steve said as they took a sit in the waiting room. Natasha smiled softly. “No, really. Those girls truly love you and admire you. I mean I can tell by the throbbing in my back, where one of your little black widows threw a toy at me.”
Tony’s eyes fell shut.
“Alright sweetheart, let’s take a breath,” Steve calmly said, laughter at the forefront of his words. “That all sounds amazing, but you know what sounds even more amazing?”
Steve leaned closer to him, his cool breath setting flames on Tony’s neck. He leaned down closer and let his mouth hover a few inches at the base of Tony’s neck. Tony held in a breath and unconsciously let his eyes flutter closed. He was momentarily disappointed as Steve moved away from his neck. But he was thoroughly grateful when his cool breath traveled at his ear. Tony shivered in his arms and pressed himself closer to Steve.
He wanted Steve.
Tony smirked down at Peter and gently brought his hand to rest on Peter’s shoulder. “Oh, trust me I know how much you hate licorice. I still have that essay you gave to me about how licorice is Satan’s snack.”
“I know.”
Steve felt his heart do a weird leap. “Then I would love to come back.”
In the box sat a ring made of vibranium. Steve took it out and was in complete awe of how Shuri was able to encapsulate so much into a tiny piece of metal. The ring almost had this bit of an iridescent affect to it, offset by the way the sun reflected off of it.
Karen tilted her head downward. “Where did you learn that from?”
“You need sleep, I need sleep. There’s this comfortable bed both of us can share.”
“I’m safe. Why wouldn’t I be?” Tony questioned looking around trying to see if anything was misshapen.
“You may say that, but I’m always going to worry about you…have since you decided you wanted to eat fifty lollipops to see if it honestly takes the same amount of licks to get to the center of different tootsie pops.”
Tony sighed, but smiled nonetheless. “Alright bambino I’m letting you off with a warning this time, okay? Next time is time out. You can’t eat cookies before dinner because it’ll spoil your appetite.”
“It’s okay Tony. Miles is safe. He’s not hurt. He’s right here with you Tony okay. Look at him, nothing is broken,” Steve whispered into his ear. “He’s okay Tony. He’s okay.”
Steve had to look in the rearview mirror to make sure that Harley hadn’t passed out. Instead he was met with wide expressive eyes settling in fear. His mouth opened and closed as if he was unsure of how to even respond to the bomb of truth Peter dropped.
He wiped at tears that were now staining Tony’s cheeks. He moved back a little in order to reach into his jacket pocket. Tony gasped softly as Steve pulled at a silver box. His eyes looked at Steve searchingly. He gasped as Steve held the box in front of him, opening it.
Blood flew from a wound on his shoulder and Steve hoped with a sort of rampant satisfaction that it would be enough for him to bleed out. However, Natasha was always deliberate in her attacks. She had left enough not to kill, but to permanently wound.
“Shh, we have already made decisions. Last minute statements will not be put into consideration, especially from one not having voiced his own opinion when we actually needed it,” Julie said, eyebrow lifting and lips pressed together in a smooth smirk.
And so Tony realized his answer to Dr. Sana’s question. In that moment, if she had asked, “And what do you find yourself living for?”
“Hi,” Steve breathed out, a slanted grin overtaking his expression.
“I thought you said we could share,” Steve offered innocently and if it weren’t for the smirk setting in on his face, Tony would have thought his statement was genuine.
Tony abruptly tried ripping himself away from Steve, but Steve’s tight grasp on his hands kept him pressed against Steve.
“Don’t go there, punk,” Bucky said, his own voice hoarse from disuse.
Pepper rolled her eyes. “He’s steadily growing back on me, but I’ll still be talking to him.”
Steve’s chest prickled and he just felt his body need to get out of the seat and want to beat Isak. He had never felt this strongly in his life and he wanted to push Isak over a cliff and have his body bounce off of the cliff’s rocky edges. He wanted to poison Ryder from the inside out.
Steve laughed too, the noise causing his chest to vibrate under Tony’s ears. Steve ran his fingers down Tony’s back, fingers gently teasing as where Tony had grown soft and tender.
“Oh,” Steve simply said. Inside he was screaming and doing the most intricate happy dance his serum-enhanced body could do. “Well, that’s fortunate for us. That means that we can enjoy our spaghetti as was intended.”
“Mr. Stark!” Peter shouted.
“He’s in his lab,” Natasha stated, eyes still narrowed at him.
“You are a child,” Steve said pointing toward Clint. “And we are not getting rid of people anymore, certainly not people who have done nothing.”
Steve’s cheeks flushed even more darkly at the suggestion. “That’s…that’s not…we wouldn’t do that. Goodness, Buck he’s not even broken up with Ryder yet.”
Steve raised his arms in defense before sharing a look at Peter.
“Yes baba,” Miles said practically bouncing with excitement and ready to let go of Tony’s hands. “Alright, I get it. Can I go now?”
“Mr. Tony, now this is a very time sensitive,” Julie began, but was stopped by the sound of his phone vibrating.
“Steve when I said cut the bull shit, I meant in everything.”
He remembered exactly how he had phrased things in a way that made Tony feel like Ryder was only looking after his best interests.
Steve nodded. “Yeah, you’re right. I just…”
And left.
Tony tried thinking how much of a risk it would be to run and realized with fear that it’d be too much of a risk. He had no methods of protection. He was bare and vulnerable and Ryder knew all of this.
Ryder tried wiping his tears again and this time Tony didn’t bother refusing. Ryder leaned closer to Tony. “I’m sorry. Tell me what you want.”
Tony’s words were interrupted, when Steve bodily threw Tony over his shoulder standing up. “And here I was thinking that would be enough. But of course, I should know my brilliant genius needs a few more motivating factors to turn that inspiration portion of the brain off for a few hours.”
Peter tried slowing down his breath. “Mr. Stark he…”
“Thank you,” Miles said as Natasha sat the bowl down in front of him.
“The fact that it looks like you’ve been crying and you’re hiding underneath three blankets,” Steve announced resting his back against the back of the bed.
“I think it’s time that you really think about why you don’t want to sign the accords. You all have two weeks. You may send it to me by mail if you want to get it to me early, but I will be back here in two weeks to pick up any remaining documents. I hope you all have a wonderful evening,” Isa said packing up her stuff and getting ready to go.
Tony looked at Peter for a few seconds. Peter held the phone between them and let the ringing feel the silence in the room. Groaning Tony reached for the phone and answered it.
And I wanted so much for this chapter to be light and happy. Unfortunately, there was no way with the mental state I was in that I could deliver a chapter like that. So I took some time off. So thank you all for being patient. I love each and everyone of you.
Ryder actually began to look fearfully at him, hearing the way Steve’s voice had deepened and his stare had deepened into this cold glare.
“I thought eventually we would get over this and we would find our way back to one another. I mean we always did. After everything we always regrouped and came back stronger, but this…I think I’ve come to the point of no return and Natasha it feels like I can’t breathe…I can’t breathe because I know that Tony will never look at me the same. And I have these nightmares of Tony’s face just looking at me in disappointment as he says Bucky may have killed my parents, but you…
“Okay, be prepared for some amazing spaghetti. Also buckle your seat belt for this wonderful wooing ride of the famous Steve Rogers. Granted not many people have been on this ride, so feel special.”
Isak straightened, looking decidedly more interested. “Oh, I had no idea you were close to my brother. He didn’t mention it, though he didn’t mention quite a lot on that short ride.”
“Not all the times,” Tony professed, cheekily.
“I’m looking forward to seeing it,” Steve smiled.
Not what he wanted to say…why?
So I figure since you all have been so amazing and open with me, I thought I would share just a little bit of myself. Recently, my aunt passed because she just couldn't find anything in this world to keep her going. It knocked me off of my feet because seeing someone lose the battle that you've been struggling with is f'ing terrifying. What's even more heartbreaking is thinking to yourself, "She stopped and the way she did it would be all too easy." And that kept me up at night because I thought I was getting better. Everything was rainbows and sunshine and I felt like that sadness was defeated, you know? Because it just feels wrong, the way I was raised to let emotions take control of me like that.
“So how’s everything going with you and B.A.R.F.?” Steve prompted as he began cutting up some tomatoes for the salad.
“You know he thought it was his fault for the longest,” Natasha explained.
“Okay?” Bekah questioned.
“Well, that was an interesting way to enter the Mr. Stark Defense Squad,” Peter laughed.
“Really? Pretty sure I am already ruining the kid,” Tony teased, though it lacked any humor. His eyes dimmed slightly. “I mean I pretty much am my father’s son. Even you said so.”
So in honor of all of you, I am giving you all what you deserve and have been (would patiently even be the right word lol) waiting for "The Reveal."
Or crap…maybe this will be part of the discussion. Tony had fought for the Accords and ramifying it to fit everyone’s needs…but he hadn’t fought much for claiming himself as an Avenger.
Tony nearly blissed out, clung harder onto Ryder as he drove deeper inside of him. Ryder pressed hungry kisses against his nape and move forward shaking as if he himself were overcome with joyous emotion. Tony rocked with the movement and realized that if in this moment things were okay…if for once he actually felt desirable and pleasurable as Ryder moved within places he rarely ever let any people go…then maybe he should say yes to what Ryder wanted more often than not. If only for these few short minutes of love.
“A few hours? Feeling generous Steve? Maybe more like a few minutes,” Tony teased, “Hey!”
Suddenly, he was going back to that room where they had found Tony after 52 days of fucking searching and never feeling like they were close.
Tony grew excited too at the thought of seeing his son, Peter, and Harley. “I’ll be glad to see them too.”
Steve immediately got out of his seat. “I can write a letter!”
“Do you not want to go?” Steve questioned raising an eyebrow.
Clint shook his head. “This isn’t making sense. It made much more sense in my head. Look there’s no excuse for me being an ass these past few weeks, when you’ve done nothing, but been amazing and generous. I just…I thought I couldn’t lose them. I’d rather have them and being an Avenger than you.”
“Just let me check that everything is good to go. Then you can get Harley and we can leave,” Ryder said. “Meet you two both at the front desk say at a quarter till ten.”
“Oh, yum this looks delicious,” Peter winced taking the cookie and discreetly placing it on the coffee table.
Rhodey laughed shortly as Tony gave him an unamused glare.
“For your own benefit love,” Karen said.
“Baba,” Miles had whispered sleepily and wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck.
After his call ended with Cali, Steve immediately gathered the Avengers around him. He sent Peter and Miles to Pepper and told her to watch after them. The two had followed albeit a bit slower, not truly wanting to leave after hearing Tony’s voice. Steve was certain Harley would be disappointed that he hadn’t gotten the chance to hear Tony.
“Of course.”
Steve’s eyes narrowed, a thirst suddenly appearing inside of him that could only be sated by whatever Tony had in store for him.
“Yes, I…yes,” Tony said as his eyes rolled back into his head, body tightening.
“Stop lying!” Steve shouted.
Miles shook his head solemnly. “I don’t want baba to cry.”
No, he could probably do a picture of it instead. Yeah, a picture would be better.
Tony “Yeah, now let’s go make an album of them.”
He was annoyed with himself for being so greatly affected by something as simple as a closed door. It was easier when there was someone in here with him that he knew. However, he was alone and it was getting dark. And hospitals were so cold. They always remained cold as though they wanted their patients to have a constant reminder that they were close to death.
The woman looked disappointingly at her husband. “Isak, surely we can visit for a while? I know the kids would love to see your…”
As soon as those words were uttered, their eyes would roll back and become glazed. They didn’t know why those words signaled that response, but it seemed to have some type of kill switch. They had to start gagging the nineteen remaining individuals.
“I would too,” Steve answered.
“Alright Bucky and Clint you’re with me. Come on little black widows. Let’s see if we can get in line for the Frosty rollercoaster.”
“Ah, thanks,” Steve said picking up the soup that Bucky had placed down.
“Was there any other reason?”
“Not killing you here. Too many cameras,” Bucky said dryly.
Natasha grit her teeth and ignored the urge to bring to consciousness the two individuals lying just outside the bathroom and bringing them within an inch of death.
Sam winced, already knowing that Natasha didn’t come here to play. Both him and Bucky seemed to get the idea and moved quietly in the kitchen as Natasha went to go sit in the den. Steve came out of the room. A moment of startled surprise at Steve’s appearance, shook Natasha. Steve dragged himself into the den. His beard looked poorly kept and his eyes were rimmed red with no sleep. His shirt was rumpled as though he hadn’t changed clothes in a few days.
The two looked at each other for a few seconds, before Clint turned back around to face the movie. When the movie ended, Tony stood up taking orders of what people wanted from the kitchen, while teasing Steve for crying at Mufasa’s death.
Steve bit back a whimper and narrowed his eyes at Natasha who was snickering behind the hallway door and high-fived Julie. From then on, he tried hiding from all of the little black widows. He thought that he would find safety with Jaime, but Jaime turned a cool glare to him and ousted his position.
My love, for I have given unto you the depths of my soul
Rhodey, himself would often set to fixing the various items broken in Tony’s room. There were many. Steve knew that it was likely Tony had taken them apart in interest of seeing if he could make something better. Tony always could. Rhodey only ever wanted to attempt at fixing them, just so that when Tony came back he could tease Rhodey for even trying and then jokingly telling him it was better than when Rhodey had fixed it.
He yearned to have them here with him and maybe he wouldn’t need Ryder as much. Maybe then he’d have people he could at least pretend to want him, but wouldn’t cause him to go into work feeling bruised and not able to sit down at conference meetings. However, he should be thankful he has Ryder who he doesn’t have to pretend with. He knows what he was getting himself into with Ryder. He needed to be thankful.
“Thanks,” Steve smiled. “And you cut your hair. That is certainly different.”
“Because last time that happened there was a war,” Pepper said warmly in contrast to the coldness in her eyes. “He doesn’t need the stress right now. So I will be helping him out with that and it may be better to do it with someone you are not personally tied to right now. Vision?”
All of the others stared at him silently, not even knowing how to approach any of what Thor had just confessed. This was fairly similar to the time Thor jokingly told them how Loki had tried poisoning Thor’s bathwater, when they were children. He knew sibling rivalry was a thing, but with Thor and Loki it just seemed…well Tony didn’t know quite how to describe it. However, it seemed like things were shifting between the two of them with the recent development from their homeland and displacement.
“Our funnel cake,” Steve explained walking away from Tony.
“I know I see him Miles, but let’s be quiet so we can hear the video, okay?” Tony said trying to calm down the excited child.
Natasha bit her lip. She was unsure how she felt about handing Miles off to a stranger. Sure, Vision was one of Tony’s creations, but he also hadn’t been around Miles that much. How would Miles respond to her handing him off to someone? However, she needed to make sure that they wouldn’t stumble upon anything that she didn’t want him to see.
“This got sad, real quick,” Clint added playing with his fork.
“Now why on earth would I tell you that?” Ryder questioned. “Don’t want you running away from me, after all of the fun that I have in store for you.”
Ryder’s statement was cut off with a sharp knock against his head that had his vision immediately swimming and blood pooling the inside.
“Hey,” Steve said, hoping that his voice sounded smooth.
He looked at the time on the clock Steve had brought to his…their room not too long ago. Tony had teased Steve over his old man clock, to which Steve had shyly blushed and teased back with saying he could teach Tony how to read one.
“I don’t know why I keep coming here,” Tony confessed. “It certainly hasn’t really helped besides constantly letting me know you’re gone. You’re dead and there’s no way you can hurt me here anymore. You know it’s funny even after death, you had some strange hold on me. It’s like I was in this state of limbo, while you had already passed on.”
“Thanks for bringing him here,” Tony graciously said. “But how have you two been?”
Natasha stayed silent for a few moments. “A few months ago it would’ve been a definite no. Now…it may be a maybe. I’m not sure. For so long I pushed that side of me that ever wanted to be a parent away. It’s what’s necessary for us in our job positions. Then seeing Tony with Miles…well a part of me wants that. Then seeing those girls,” Natasha broke off.
“Uh yeah. He answered, he’s safe. He was just at the park,” Steve told him.
“Thanks Mr. Stark,” the person who couldn’t have been more than 24 said.
Tony let out a hoarse scream half in part for how Winston’s body was laying on the floor barely moving and half in part from how Ryder roughly entered him. Tony tried scrambling away, barely being able to gather enough air into his lungs. Ryder pushed Tony back further onto himself driving himself deeper and harder into Tony.
“You consulted with Loki,” Bruce said raising a brow. “How did you even do that?”
“He won’t listen.”
Steve raised his eyebrow and shifted in his seat, allowing for his legs to splay slightly open. He hated what he was doing, but sometimes you had to play the part. This was just another simple undercover thing that he was doing. But instead of it just being a mission, it was for the benefit of Tony. Opening his legs, just for Isak’s eyes to potentially show interest even for a second was fine, if it meant Tony didn’t have to open himself up to get Isak to announce his true identity.
Winston gave him a look that seemed so innocent as though he didn’t understand why Tony didn’t want this.
What made him want to consider telling Steve, when he had no plans of telling Pepper or Rhodey everything that happened…at least not yet? Maybe he’d see how Steve took it first. Guess, this could be the trial run.
“Ryder!” Isak said eyes widening with the increasing speed that his brother was doing. Wild hands went to grasp at the hands on the steering wheel, hoping to intervene. “Slow down.”
They all nodded and Steve left the room. Steve carried Tony into the quinjet and headed straight for the tower. Tony had fallen straight asleep and Steve couldn’t blame him. As soon as they arrived Steve went to his room, since it was closer.
“What is with this confess your undying love? I’m like not in love with Tony or anything and if I was he has a boyfriend and I highly doubt Tony has any feelings like that toward me. I’ll be lucky if we can get back our friendship,” Steve admitted with cheeks growing warm at Clint’s waggling eyebrows and Bucky’s smirk.
Miles. He was going to be sick. He wanted to turn to face Miles, but he didn’t want to move because if he did he would break this frozen state of being that was the only thing helping him from collapsing.
“Oh, never,” Sam whispered. “Can’t have him thinking we actually like his small spider self.”
“Aye, yes. I have seen the solid structure of many buildings he has constructed. As children he was quite fascinated with capturing me in enclosed spaces. They were awfully quite brilliant and the floorplan was often pretty,” Thor laughed. “Once he made this entire building with no doors. The walls were really lovely to look at. He was only four then, at that moment I knew he had great potential.”
He waited a brief moment for the sentiment to be shared, but his only response was the click of a phone hanging up. Tony rubbed his hands over his face.
“Natasha isn’t here right now. She’ll be coming in another hour or so. Maybe when she gets here, you can tell her to join your group,” Tony said.
Peter groaned. “That’s not a thing.”
I hope you all experience a fun and safe New Year's with friends and family. :)
Steve tensed at how sure of himself Ryder seemed to be. Bucky as if noticing Steve was going to say something, pulled on his arm and shook his head. It was time to stop giving this man what he wanted.
“Tony,” Steve said embarrassingly.
“That sounds like a wonderful thing. Retirement. Letting things be out of your hand for a bit,” Steve said whimsically. “Perhaps I may hang up active duty and focus more on training and stuff.”
Steve shrugged his shoulders. “Just saying. Okay, dinner at seven. Don’t be late. I’ll drag you out the lab if I have to and FRIDAY will help me won’t you?”
“Yeah, and you were lying down for seventy years, but from what I heard you could basically run the first time you woke up. So Rogers put me down,” Tony asserted, though fingers tightened on Steve’s neck.
Bucky stifled a laugh as a cough and Clint had to turn away pretending to be busy with making coffee. Natasha shrugged her shoulders.
“Don’t worry, I’ll get you another funnel cake,” Steve said while he pressed a warm hand into Tony’s back.
Whew, how long has it been, since we've had a relatively short chapter? Does this mean that some stuff is going down (most of which you all have been hoping for lol) in these last few chapters and the author is just giving y'all a little break...possibly.
“Sorry,” Steve muttered, reaching out a hand to pull Bucky up.
He repeated this over and over and kept one hand rubbing Tony’s back, while the other held Tony’s clasped hands.
Tony shrugged not wanting to explain himself to Natasha. “Doesn’t matter. Just no leaving notes or just tell them you went shopping.”
“Natasha can you do me a huge favor and watch Miles for a few days. I know you have to get ready for your mission coming up soon and if you have to leave early or aren’t available I can get in touch with May. But Ryder is right I did promise him and I hate to leave a bad impression on Ryder’s parents,” Tony rambled. “It just slipped my mind.”
Steve rubbed his forehead. “It’s just easier for me to write things. I can just place all of my feelings on there.”
“Yeah, I mean I used to pretend that they were my real parents. I mean they were there more than my parents. I remember there was one summer my parents’ went on a trip to Spain and left me to be with Ana and Jarvis. That summer was the best and I told everyone that Ana and Jarvis were my mom and dad,” Tony laughed. “I was so fucking disappointed when I had to go back to being a Stark.”
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
These thoughts continued to swirl through his head as he made his way back to the hospital. Peter had called him, saying that he and the boys were on their way back to May’s. That meant that Steve had a few minutes to get to the hospital. He had passed them on their way home and stopped briefly to check in about how their day was going, before heading up to Tony’s room. There he was stopped by a doctor, who wanted to ask for an autograph for her son. He obliged her wishes and went toward the front desk so he could have something to write on. When he was done, the same doctor asked if he wouldn’t mind coming down to the children’s floor, before having to go back to Tony.
Bucky never forgot how to tell when Steve was lying.
Rhodey shook his head, “No, it’s fine. I actually have to head home that nap wasn’t enough for me and I think I’m just about to drop any moment.”
Steve bit back a response and most importantly bit back another apology.
“What terrible thing Steve,” Natasha whispered, wanting immediately to ask Steve what his love confession meant. But as much as she wanted to explore that she needed to know what Steve felt like he had to protect Tony from.
“Well, I certainly wish we didn’t have to do board meetings, but alas we kept pushing them back. So voila we have four today. All back to back,” Pepper said.
“Yeah, last time you came a year later. Has it been a year in this dream?”
Tony raised an eyebrow waiting for Steve to disagree, but he was admittedly surprised when all Steve did was nod seriously.
He quickly leapt onto the floor and looked as though he was taking off his shirt. Miriam raised an eyebrow at the bathtub then to Tony. Miriam shook her head silently and motioned the two unfamiliar faces forward. The familiar face stood back.
“That’s a foolish thing to admit baby brother,” Ryder announced, laughingly increasing his speed.
“I hate you,” Tony exclaimed all of a sudden, voice raspy from held back anger. “I hate you, but I can’t keep carrying you wherever I go. Perhaps I’ll always have those nights with nightmares of your face or have a memory cross my mind, whenever I go somewhere we used to. But that’s all it’ll be moments, however brief and short. It’s been years and I need to let myself be happy, without feeling weighed down.”
He pulled the hospital gown and his fingers trembled as it fell easily off of his shoulders. He could see the hand shaped bruises leaving trails all over Tony’s body, some of which rested near his hip bone and disappeared underneath his boxers. There was scrapes at his knees as though Tony had tried crawling away and the carpet had burned them. There was the obvious weight loss, the way Steve could see Tony’s ribs as he inhaled.
Steve shook his head. “I apologize for my friends Mr. Moore. I wanted to come alone, but well as you can see that didn’t happen.”
It was full blessed silence.
“I don’t know what to do and that’s selfish. I’m concerned over what I will do, when this directly affected you. I have all these feelings of anger and blind rage that I want to kill Ryder. He hurt you Tony…he hurt
“Yeah?” Tony asked shyly. “I haven’t been too sure. I mean Ryder thinks that I shouldn’t have adopted. He constantly brings that into conversation and I mean it’s true. I really shouldn’t have adopted without his input. I mean we are together and it wasn’t fair to spring a kid on him.”
Thor and Bruce shared a long look and sighed. “It is a long story, one that must be explained as soon as we have available time.”
Tony raised his shoulder. “Hmmm, what can I say America has a thing for a clean-cut virgin type heroes.”
“No, they don’t,” Miles disagreed. “You say that. I’m not growing. Aunt Natasha says baba eats his veggies and he’s still tiny.”
“You’d make a great father by the way. Miles really loves you and it’s really cool that you adopted him,” Steve admitted, bringing to mind Ryder’s previous words.
The bell chimed above the door and all three of them stepped inside. Steve walked in the store moving between different customers who were all looking around trying to buy different things. A few people stopped and stared as they realized who exactly was in the building. Thankfully, no one bothered to take pictures of them.
“I did it to protect you,” Steve finally said.
“So you kidnapped a kid?”
Steve looked over his shoulder, eyes peering into Ryder’s bruised and swollen ones.
“And how did it go,” Clint drawled. “Don’t leave us hanging.”
Tony took the box from him and looked at him curiously. “But you already gave me a Christmas present?”
There are not enough excuses or even the most sincerest of apologies that could make up for this 7+ month hiatus. So I shall not bother you all with that, after all you came for a very much overdo update. Needless to say I am thankful for your patience (and also really nervous for the response of this chapter. I feel literal butterflies in my stomach) and hope this chapter is thoroughly enjoyable because I truly enjoyed writing it.
He retraced his steps letting his previous statement of, “Leads me to wonder what exactly else you are hiding” fade away, in favor of asking, “So why did you follow your brother into that car? What made it worth going after him, after all of the trouble he has caused for you and your family.”
“You’re making biscuits again?” Bucky implored raising his hand to stick it in the batter.
“Back in your day?” Tony laughed. “Also I’m not a little Stark and what happened to silent winter soldier thing,” Tony said. “And to be frank you’ve never seen what my lab looks like so…can’t really be a fair judge of what lab accidents do to my face.”
Though why couldn’t Steve just say it, without hoping Tony could get what he was implying?
Steve breathed out a sigh of relief knowing that he hadn’t done anything to mess up the sense of calm that had just settled.
“See you when I get back,” Steve said.
“Hmmm,” Peter hummed in the back of his throat and began to play with the a frayed piece of his sweater.
But Ryder wouldn’t go that far. Sure, his time with Winston, Cali, and Miriam was awful and he definitely didn’t need an encore of that night’s performance. Ryder wouldn’t do anything to him like that again. Tony always believed that people could change. So who was he to pass judgment on Ryder and think that he couldn’t?
Tony shrugged, but when he realized Steve couldn’t see the movement he articulated his movement. “Yeah, sometimes I get a little jittery, when I’m in settings like this especially when I didn’t prepare beforehand. I may be good with crowds and media, but that’s because I always get ready to set up this defensive shield. I was setting up a shield for a small dinner not this.”
“Then let me help. Whatever you need. Just don’t push me away, thinking that you’re saving me from your pain,” Steve said pressing their foreheads together, their breaths intermixing with one another’s. “Please sweetheart don’t push me away.”
“Stop it,” Tony hissed as a burning in his eyes slowly grew. “Stop it.”
The voice hummed lowly. “So I suppose you need to make sure you are a more permeant fixture in Stark’s life in order to continue your plan.”
Before Bucky had the chance to respond, Clint darted out in front of them. “Okay, I am ready to go!”
He had enjoyed that look of haunting desperation on Ryder’s face. He had marveled at how Ryder appeared to just wilt before him. He hated the fact that Ryder still believed Tony would come for him.
“No, I’m pretty sure he said what he meant,” Steve exclaimed shaking his head. “You all have fun now.”
Ryder turned slowly to him, excusing himself from talking to the lady at the front desk. “I do. However, every now and then I’ll have to come in and give my expertise. The hospital board wanted me to give a demonstration this morning to a couple of residents. What are you doing here?”
He brought their hands to his lips and kissed Tony’s palm. “He hurt you and I didn’t know. We’ve been living together again for almost half a year. Pepper tells me you were with him for a year and I don’t know why. I don’t know why you stayed with him. I don’t know how long this has been going on, but it doesn’t matter how long or how short the time frame was…he laid his hands on you and fuck…”
Ryder sat back on the floor in front of Tony. “I want everything with you and feel like I deserve nothing with you. I know you have been patient and I hope you continue to be patient. I am trying here Tony. I just got jealous, but you cannot allow us to be separated from this. Because if I’m separated from you who else will be there for you? At the end of the day everyone leaves you, this past year is evidence of that,” Ryder cooed at Tony.
“Let’s take a break. Leave him alone with his thoughts for a minute,” Bucky suggested. “He’s going to cave and if we have to make this a waiting game, we can. Change the level of tactics against this man. We may not be able to get him to confess now, but we will by the end of the day.”
Tony looked down shyly and smoothed his thumb over the words. “Hopeful? I mean I know it feels silly,” he said trying to wave it off. He laughed a little. “Forget it.”
“I’m sorry I have to take this,” Steve said looking down at the unknown number. Not too many people had access to his number so the few people that called him have to have called for a reason. Taking a chance, he answered the call.
Of course Tony had been fast asleep, dead to the world and hopefully being accepted into his safe world of dreams.
“Bambino slow down.” Tony rubbed his chest and grabbed a cup so he could cough into it. He hated how Miles was feeling so bad, but hopefully things would clear up.
“Cross my heart,” Steve said.
He wanted to remember all of this, because it would probably be the last time he would ever be this close to Tony.
Steve shook his head. “See I can’t do that without knowing you’re alright. Do I need to get Ms. Karen?”
Steve faltered briefly, his movement to take another shard of glass was put on pause. He brought his eyes up to meet Tony’s. However, Tony’s had his face turned toward the resting palm in his lap.
“Yeah, maybe next time everyone could come,” Miles said. “I would like that.”
“It’s either bring Tony in or let Isak go,” Coulson stated, not wanting to agree with Fury on this, but not knowing how to solve this situation any other way. “It’s the last thing I want to do. Trust me, but unless we have valid verbal proof it will look like Captain America and his Avengers are coercing a civilian to admit criminal offenses, due to emotion and the public will turn on us.”
“That’s fine. Tell Happy to drive you,” Tony told him. “And make sure that you tell me when you make it there safely and when you’re on your way back.”
“What’d you say?” Bucky announced suddenly coming back to grab a seat beside Sharon.
Tony arrived at the table and sat beside Ryder who had brought another seat to the table. Ryder had been talking to Pepper and Rhodey. He appeared slightly uncomfortable as Rhodey talked to him, until Rhodey broke out into a smile and patted Ryder’s shoulder. Pepper rolled her eyes toward Rhodey and said something else to Ryder, then turned back to talk to Sharon.
Ryder began taunting him, “Come on Captain. You want to hurt me, so hurt me. ‘Cause what you’ve done in the past few hours is only an increment of what you think I’ve done to Tony for almost this whole past year.”
He came quietly into the lab and was about to find where Peter was, but was stopped by a different voice in the room and some shuffling. He hid himself behind one of Tony’s machines and tried going unnoticed.
The stressed sound didn’t ease Steve’s worries. Instead he kept massaging Tony’s hands and Tony was completely content to just stay like this.
FRIDAY scanned the images and Steve’s eyes focused harder on the images as if hoping by some grace he would see a familiar one. And that he did.
Ryder’s eyes looked around the kitchen and settled on a list of Miles’ allergies. “My apologies. I hadn’t known. Next time I will know better.” He stood up and went to ruffle Miles’ hair. “Sorry little man.”
“I like you more than baba’s boyfriend,” Miles whispered. “Julie said he’s gonna be my dad. I don’t want him to be my dad. Can’t you be my dad instead Mr. Steve? I’ll be the bestest son ever, you can ask baba!”
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
He hoped to all things above that days…no even years from now he wouldn’t wish that he had put a bullet through Ryder’s head or had pressed the kill switch that Bruce had handed to him, before Tony had left the interrogation room with Ryder. That kill switch, the simple command of saying yes, and having that little detonator go off in his body was compelling.
“Definitely, they miss you so much. You missed Julie’s birthday. She was very sad, she couldn’t share her cupcake with you. Also they have a little surprise that they’re particularly excited about sharing with you.”
Tony smiled warmly. “I missed you, DUM-E.”
Steve looked worried for a second, wondering briefly if Tony was thinking of saying yes.
“No, that was all me.”
“Yeah, the greatest moment was when you told her mom that her daughter shouldn’t be going around offering to open a stranger’s juice box,” Natasha claimed. “Needless to say we were kicked out of the amusement park and if it weren’t for some big payoff I’m pretty certain Clint would have made headlines with a picture of him holding a juice box by a sobbing little girl.”
“Yes, emphasis on
Harley smiled shyly and immediately got up. He grabbed a change of clothes and nearly ran to the group bathroom. Steve turned up getting ready to leave and ran into Natasha. Natasha didn’t even try to hide the fact that she had been eavesdropping. She simply followed into step with Steve on his way to Karen’s office.
“This is a dream. When I wake up, you’ll be gone. You’re always gone. You’ll be gone, like always. It’s just a dream, just a dream,” Tony sings.
“Clint,” Clint introduced holding out his hand.
He had told Tony rather seriously, “No baby. ‘M grow’up baba. I can walk.”
Harley himself looked shocked and so did Peter. It seemed as though maybe the two hadn’t known of this bribery. For all intents and purposes the both of them could have sworn to Tony that his team was going to mean.
“I suggest you do as we have been asking, one more time. Confess that you are Ryder or I’ll leave a mark on your tongue for every single lie you have told since you first entered Tony’s life. Then I might get a bit creative and leave some more on your body. I’ve been told I am quite the artist. Guess, it’s time to add body artist to my portfolio.”
A beat of silence. Steve swallowed a lump in his throat.
“Ummm, purple?”
Ryder waved his concern off. “Yeah, no you go. I’ll have this all packed and ready to go. I’ll follow you back shortly.”
Miles turned toward Natasha and opened his arms toward her. Natasha leaned over and grabbed the child, tucking him in close to her. She tickled his arms and smiled once Miles let out rushed giggles.
Natasha’s glare softened slightly, but not enough to erase the hardness in her expression. She held out her hand for the note and started to read it aloud.
Steve didn’t know what happened, but all of a sudden arms were pulling at his shoulders. His vision cleared and he saw Miriam nursing a broken nose. Blood streamed through her fingers as she looked at Steve with almost disbelief that he had hit her, before a smile took her place. Steve was taunted by the laughter that bubbled in his chest at his horrified glance of what he had done.
“What do you want from me Tony? You want me to be happy that you just adopted a kid knowing full well that you’re not ready to be a father. I mean you and I both know how hard it is being a kid of someone who isn’t equipped to be a parent.”
Steve stepped forward, following Tony as he tugged him to his friends who were now beginning a very serious and competitive game of charades.
“Our friendship, everything began to change and I didn’t know what to do. I thought…I’ve known him for two years and this was the first time he was acting this way. I thought we were at a good place after his family’s tragedy. I thought it put some things into perspective for him. He was nicer and more open. He was kind and gentle,” Tony said smiling at the thought of those days were Ryder had been one of the softest human beings he had known.
He narrowed his eyes and Tony noticed. Tony quickly cast his eyes downward.
“Oh, well they actually have things planned. So you know it’s best they come over in five days. They still have things to get together,” Bruce told Tony. “It’ll be a fun time though. We’ll have cake and everything.”
“Ryder.”
“What does he have planned?” Steve asked unsurely as he looked at the party invite in his hand. “It’s not Tony’s birthday, so it can’t be that.”
“Is he alright?” Steve immediately asked taking the phone off speaker and turning away from the penetrative expressions of his teammates.
Steve waited a moment and Tony really wondered if he would deny himself this until Tony had officially broken up with Ryder. He was ready to argue that kissing him right now wouldn’t be bad in anyway.
Miles seemed pleased with this and ran off to find his other friends, but not before looking back at Tony once more. Tony smiled and was thankful that he had come today. As he made his way to Karen’s office he heard two other voices talking.
“Then what? Steve you’re just going to have to help me out here.”
Tony woke up with a start, his breathing harsh and ragged. Dots swam in his vision. He blinked once, twice…before everything started to clear up. He couldn’t stop the chattering of his teeth or the shaking off his fingers. He looked around at the walls and then to the closed door. His breath picked up.
Tony, I swear these investors are about to get my heel shoved up their pale paper thin behinds.
“He’s since been fired,” Harley exclaimed.
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
Looking at Harley and Peter, Miles nodded seriously. “I remember,” he softly said.
“Steve…”
“And I know correlation doesn’t imply causation, but like can you just…You know what never mind it’s probably stupid. I’m fine to sleep alone. Besides Miles will most likely come in here later because-”
“Sure, what color do we want him to be?”
Tony nodded thankful and led Natasha out. “Well let’s go our chariot awaits.”
When they entered Miles’ room, Tony first went to change Miles into his pajamas, which Miles easily allowed. However, when Tony tried separating himself from Miles’ hold, he found he couldn’t. The small child had wrapped himself completely around his father unwilling to go.
Tony laid back on the sheets, his mouth pressing open kisses to anywhere of Steve that he could touch. Steve fell easily into the kisses, body rolling into a rhythm that only Tony and himself were knowledgeable of.
“Thor control your brother,” Natasha warned seeing Steve’s line of vision.
Shuri sighed softly. “That’s not how it works Peter.”
“I don’t think that a letter is the best option.” Natasha sighed. Steve looked at her imploringly. “Fine. Write the letter and I’ll send it to Tony, since I know where he is right now. But that will not be the end. That is only the beginning. ”
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
Steve shook his head. “Let’s leave this sad man to his delusions.”
“You know that’s all they’re going to be talking about for the rest of the class,” Peter told him throwing his backpack over his shoulder.
He looked at the time and shockingly observed that it had become the next morning. All this adrenaline in his body, kept him from feeling tired at all.
Then he was there back in Siberia
Miles looked weary as though Tony would leave him again.
Sorry for any possible mistakes, if one makes your head particularly hurt please let me know.
“Apparently he thought tonight would be a perfect night to propose. Welcome to your engagement party,” Natasha said.
Natasha quirked an eyebrow at him. She slid a knife under her jacket sleeve and fell into step beside Clint, Bucky, and Bruce. She looked at them unwaveringly and said what they all were thinking in response to Steve’s confession.
The rest of the Avengers, minus Tony were in the kitchen trying to entertain Miles, who had woken up and become disappointed that Tony’s door was locked. Natasha was playing with him, while Steve made a quick snack.
Now left alone Steve took the time to slump forward and just let the fact that Tony was safe cloak him in a sense of security. His eyes drooped and he figured he could fall asleep right there if he just took a few more steps he could be sitting at the kitchen table and take a quick nap.
Peter looked back earnestly to him. “I don’t have any more tests and I’m pretty much free.”
By then the two were standing up, with Steve briskly following Tony around. To anyone else they looked like two children playing a game of tag. Karen watched as they passed her and shook her head amusedly before returning to her conversation with one of the donors.
“Sounds good.”
“A gentlemen never kisses and tells,” Steve said stepping into the shower.
“Yes sir,” FRIDAY acknowledged.
“We didn’t mean to make him feel all the blame for that,” Clint said silently finally taking in part of what he had done.
He heard someone whisper to him, “Shh, it’s alright. I’ve got you. No one’s going to hurt you ever again. I swear. No one is going to hurt you.”
Bucky tilted his head to the side and scrolled through some channels. “This looks good.”
Steve laughed, knowing full well that she was having her hands full with keeping Tony busy.
“A broken collarbone for falling weirdly at the skating rink. My brother hated skating. She said that she wanted to take him there to get him out his comfort zone. So I believed her. Then he fractured his wrist slamming into a wall accidentally not even four weeks later. He didn’t say anything.”
“Pretty much free?” Tony questioned raising an eyebrow.
Bucky woke up, breath catching in his throat. He immediately looked at the two sleeping people on the couch and made sure they were okay. Once seeing that nothing had happened to them, Bucky relaxed his shoulders. Bucky shifted until he was comfortable and placed a hand on Tony’s ankles. Before his eyes drifted shut, he saw Ryder coming into the den.
“Please, I just want to see my kids. I honestly don’t know what you want from me. I am deeply regretful that your friend experienced such pain, but it isn’t due to the cause of my own actions. I would never hurt anyone in my life. I have never laid a hand on anyone, not my wife, not my children, and certainly not a man I have never personally met,” Isak explained.
Steve took a step back.
“You can cook?” Steve implored. “I didn’t know that.”
Finally noting Steve’s entrance, he rolled his eyes.
“Thank you for letting me come here with you today,” Natasha said putting down the box of Christmas ornaments.
Hey do you remember that restaurant you and Tony kept mentioning?
(See the end of the chapter for
A feeling so deep overwhelmed Tony. It was this feeling of nothingness, but it felt so heavy inside him. It spread throughout his entire body and a sob threatened to ease itself out of his throat, but he swallowed it back. His eyes had lost their focus and the tapping at his chest grew frantic and he felt himself lean over in the chair struggling to breathe.
But despite all of his words of Tony being a disappointment that no one would ever be around, he still hoped someone would actually stay because they wanted and needed him.
The three of them then left to go to Harley’s classroom. Harley silently entered the classroom and said goodbye to neither his classmates nor his teacher. However, that didn’t stop them from excitedly telling Harley they would see him on Monday.
Tony left the room to whispered question of what happened in Siberia.
“I would hope that he’d trust us enough to come to us…that’d he know we love him and would do anything to take care of him. I mean we’re family. So I’d like to think he would,” Rhodey said as a frown made its way to his face. “I don’t think I could handle the idea of Tony keeping something bottled in.”
“That’s the spirt. Have a good time,” Tony told him, secretly hoping there would be a wedding in the nearby future. He would take whole responsibility…okay Pepper would get some responsibility in this Hallmark romance as well.
“I was never able to say goodbye to my mom,” Steve chocked out, still affected by a pain that the years could not cure.
“Can’t…it hurts talking,” Tony confessed. “Sorry.”
Everyone was gathered near the entrance of the carnival with varying levels of excitement. The three surrounding orphanages, Karen’s, Magnolia Orphanage, and Makalni Orphanage all brought their children ages four and up to attend the winter carnival. Tony had been busy running circles making sure each child was in their appropriate group. So far the only ones who wanted a change in groups were the little black widows.
Peter’s harsh breathing and sudden appearance caused everyone to turn their direction toward him. Rhodey told FRIDAY to pause the movie. Peter set Miles on the couch beside Steve and opened his mouth.
Tony had had enough. He burst into Karen’s office wide eyed and breathing heavily fear gripping his chest at thought of Miles going away with this Evan and his wife.
Tony’s body quickly recoiled as Steve reached out to grab one of Tony’s hands. A moment of stagnant silence filled the room as neither one dared to move. Steve’s eyes immediately darkened with shame and he tried hunching his shoulders as though trying to make himself smaller. Meanwhile Tony was trying to calm his breath and uncoil the tightness in his body.
At this moment Ryder came down hoping to say goodbye to Tony before he left for work. However, as soon as he saw Tony’s hand tapping at his arc reactor and his eyes glazed over, he dropped his briefcase and walked slowly toward Tony so as to not frighten him.
Steve shook his head and continued rambling. “You don’t understand. I can’t breathe, when I know that Tony is hurting because of me. It’s always been me Nat. I was hoping things with Tony would eventually develop to-”
“What’s wrong sweetheart?”
Apologies for having no update last week. It's just been one of those weeks and I would much rather give a late update than a chapter where my heart and mind wasn't in it. This also means I'm late to responding to comments, but know that I've read them, I've loved them, I've highly appreciated them, and I'll be getting to them soon. :)
“Of course anything,” Steve readily agreed.
Steve was just about to raise from the bench, when he saw the nurse approaching him.
“He already has so many things going against him, he probably didn’t want you all knowing this dirty little secret of his. I mean hey what people do in the privacy of their homes…but to bring my brother into this lie he constructed,” Isak shook his head. “Is awfully shameful.”
Thank you all for your continuous support through comments, bookmarks, and kudos. I genuinely appreciate all of them and look forward to hearing from y'all. Have an amazing Saturday loves.
Pep! Light of my life, I do not look
“And what of the Tony Stark? He just faded into the background with his new little boy toy Ryder Deaver?”
Steve hissed at the image of Tony being water boarded again. The others in the conference by then had tried listening into the conversation, but it was hard with it not being on speaker.
Tony of course at the time was so focused on returning to business with SI and trying to spend as much time with the kids as possible that he hadn’t even realized that a third date was coming, until Clint had mentioned it off handedly. And that was when things went…well either laughably or horribly wrong.
“Steve,” Natasha breathed. “What did you want to protect him from?”
Once carefully seated inside and buckled up, he leaned over and clapped Steve on his shoulder.
The two needed to stop, but neither was willing to voice out that thought. Too many things had separated Tony from being able to do this and he wasn’t going to allow this time to be cut short.
“Will I be seeing you both tomorrow at the winter park for Karen’s?” Tony questioned trying to steer the conversation from any sort of revealing statements.
Isa continued her passionate speech spurred on by the speechlessness in Steve’s expression and the others shrinking in on themselves. For a moment she hopes FRIDAY is recording this all so she can show Tony later.
He faulted himself, for not realizing that Tony was actually the main reason for coming back and maybe he had always known deep inside of him that was the case. However, he had never dared to actually voice this even aloud to himself. But maybe that was the time that he should have.
They would help.
“No, she won’t be mad. She’ll understand,” Steve said.
“Yes, he told me,” he whispered as though it was a secret he was not supposed to be sharing with Tony.
Sam and Bucky, who hadn’t become aware of Steve’s or the kids presence yet, were bickering as they usually did. Steve figured that when the two officially had gotten married some of that fighting would have cooled down, but Steve now thought it was a thing of foreplay for them.
Right now, he needed to place Tony in his bed and watch over him. He pulled the covers back, realizing that they were warm as though fresh out of the dryer. He didn’t know who had come in and done that, but he sent an internal thankful to whoever it was.
“Language,” he said aloud to himself. “Come on, Steve.”
[1] Kjærlighet, hvem er ved døren: Love who is at the door.
Tony made an affronted noise. “I would never do such a thing.”
It had been nearly six months since Steve had sent that letter and phone. Six months since he had a semblance of normalcy in his life. And now here he was in his lab looking at the one thing he had left to destroy, but couldn’t. Everything in his lab had been broken because he finally figured out that everything that came into contact with him became dangerous or destroyed. Rhodey had told him it was time to rebuild, but Tony hadn’t been ready to. This destruction, this fragmented mess was a beautiful reminder of why Tony couldn’t be Tony anymore.
“Baba?” he questioned pointing at the game.
“Do you want me to read it aloud?” Rhodey questioned. “Because I know you, if you don’t read it you’ll bug and worry yourself all day.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony you have to stop placing everything on your shoulders. This was a messed up situation all around. Rogers fucked it up even more, but that has nothing to do with you. Tony please just stop telling yourself that you are to blame.”
Ryder led him into the hotel venue and directed him to a ballroom. As if knowing of their arrival, the doors opened and in it revealed one of Tony’s greatest nightmares.
Fury looked at Coulson and opened his mouth, but stopped with a firm shake from Coulson. Steve noted the reluctance and turned sharp eyes to Fury.
Clint turned back around to face Steve and Bucky. “So Bucky how are you?”
“Pre-serum Steve had less control of his response to bullies,” Bucky grit out knowing exactly the headspace that Steve was returning to. “And let’s just say underestimating him is when you lost the fight. I mean sure there were a lot of times that I had to get involved, but that’s because those bullies never took him there…to this place.”
And with this question Tony truly brightened up, face wide with joy and excitement as he explained his plans for the shelter and all the new things that were happening. Pepper and Rhodey were content to listen to him talk. At one point Tony had grown flushed with embarrassment, but Rhodey only urged him on eyes kind and wanting to know more.
“Two year? Two year?” Bucky repeated. “No that’s not possible. I wouldn’t have missed our anniversary.”
Natasha was startled by the hazy blank expression of Tony. His body shook so violently Natasha was briefly scared that he may shake his body into a near convulsion. He shook his head back and forth as Natasha stepped closer to me.
Harley rolled his eyes. “Is he like this all the time?”
“What?” Tony questioned hoping that if he talked to them long enough he could get them into wanting him to go.
“Just tell me.”
Steve knew that maybe he wasn’t ready to hear it. He wasn’t ready to hear that the man he loved could have been…
“So tell me is he rotting away in his jail cell or doing so fifty feet underground?”
“Well I always wanted to take the kids to this villa my mom would take me to, when I was younger. Howard would rarely come on those trips, so it’s something that still has a nice feeling attached to it,” Tony said.
“Yeah, and hopefully if this one’s successful hopefully I can set up another one near SI’s HQ in Malibu.”
“Yeah.”
“I say all of this because Tony has decided to welcome you all back to the Tower. He realized that it became a home for all of you and that’s where you would all like to go. He has created a floor for all of you. Each of you have been given your own floor, but if you want you can all live on one floor together. There are four bedrooms on each floor.”
“Yes, you would. I’m pretty sure we still have video documentation of spring vacation in-”
“Yes,” Tony sniffled turning his face away from Miles.
Tony turned gob smacked to Clint in complete and utter disbelief.  Clint averted his eye gaze and his lips turned downward.
Steve ran his tongue along Tony’s lower lip and caught it between his teeth. Tony did this little whine that had Steve thinking he either speed things along or Tony might be proven correct on his time estimate. And Steve already had to live up to his promises of breaking records tonight.
“And what if I never want to talk about it,” Tony whispered, eyes going back to Iron Bear, since he didn’t really want to see their expressions of pity or worse disappointment.
“Sure.”
“I’m a pretty good listener as well,” Steve tried softly saying to the boy. “I won’t speak up unless prompted. It seems like it would do you some good to get some stuff out. So…”
But despite Tony thinking he was able to hide his feelings, Steve had become somewhat well-versed in the media portrayal of Tony.
“Maybe next time we can take a trip together,” Ryder suggested.
“Uh, no reason. Ryder called me asking if I could get in touch with you. He said he’s been trying to reach you for a while, but you weren’t responding. I thought that something might have happened and so I called to check in.”
“It’s okay, go to sleep,” he whispered to Tony leaning down to press a kiss against his lips. “I’ll be here, when you wake.”
“Promise,” Natasha said as she reluctantly handed Miles off. “You better keep an eye on him.”
The smile that overtook Tony’s face this time made Steve want to enclose Tony in his arms and never let go. Instead he nudged Tony and grabbed the rest of their dinner.
Evan and Miracle both smiled at Tony and whispered about how brilliant their acting was.
“Is that true?” Karen questioned. “Did you all get something in return for voting for the colorful one?”
“You have to understand how this all looks to someone from the outside Tony. Remember when I told you about those rumors I heard about you in regards to the Avengers. They are certainly looking true right now. Did you spread your legs for them, while I was gone? That’s probably why you didn’t return my calls. Was Steve fucking you, when I was out saving kids?”
creative.”
Tony immediately did the same. “And a sleepy one at that. I’ve never met someone who sleeps so much.”
Natasha handed the untangled fairy lights to Clint, who was now searching for a ladder to set them up. She turned to Steve and looked down at her phone, reading out the messages.
He was back there. He was back there. He was back there.
“But I mean no offense, some like having that weight of control off of their shoulders and being reduced to nothing. My brother probably just gave him what no one else would,” Isak laughed. “But pretty boys like him often don’t last without that need for long. He’ll be off trying to suck off the nearest guy who can leave a nice sized bruise on his waste in a little bit. I’m just thankful Eva never needed me to do that to her. I can’t do those type of touches. I gear more toward positive touches and love.”
“This is Miles,” Peter introduced.
Wanda shook her head good-naturedly and followed Vision out.
His watch ticked on to the next minute and before he knew it Peter’s body came barreling into his. Steve caught the younger boy just slightly from making them both fall down. The years had certainly done a lot to improve Peter’s strength enough that it could even cause Steve to stumble a bit.
“Peter? What did I say about cookies before diner?” Tony said raising an eyebrow.
Steve took of his gloves and cracked his knuckles. “That’s all I need. If he arrives earlier than expected, I want you to tap on the window. Bucky, Natasha.”
Tony blinked owlishly and sat in the seat that Steve had occupied. He let his fingers trace the ear that only moments ago Steve had been whispering in. He pulled his bottom lip between his teeth as he felt a smile overcome his expression. He looked around his lab and back at the clock. He had three hours, before he had to meet Steve in the kitchen. He tried pushing down the wave of giddiness that circled around him.
It had been 52 days and no one had come for him.
Peter scrunched up his face. “I’m safest, when I know Tony’s looking out for me.”
“Don’t you fucking dare interrupt me, when I am talking to you. You know what’s a joke is you wearing this gift of Steve’s. What’s this him branding you as his,” Ryder said tugging on the bracelet on Tony’s wrist. “I noticed it wasn’t there, when I first saw you. But it was when you two came back.”
Thank you all for the comments, kudos, and bookmarks. It makes my heart happy to see y'all enjoying this. :)
Tony looked around unsure. “Umm.”
Ryder led Tony toward a small room and sat him down on the bed. His hand went up to his arc reactor and he traced his hands along where he knew it was. Tony couldn’t breathe.
Tony sat back in his chair, fingers pressed against his lips in contemplation. He could feel the crack in where he had bitten his lip too hard. He licked at it to soothe the sting and tasted the cool copper taste of his blood.
“I love him ma,” he said, feeling a giddiness swell inside of him. “And you would love him too. I’m sure of it. You told me to protect the person I fell in love with, to always hold them close, and to just feel freely without regard to how anyone might try to ruin us.”
They nodded their heads as though that was all the answer Tony needed. It wasn’t. He raised an eyebrow and shifted his body, mindful not to wake up Miles.
“You’re welcome.”
? Steve wanted to ask, but was never too bold to actually say it aloud.
“Come on I know you’ve been wanting to feel me up since day one. Now I’m giving you the opportunity.”
Cali breathed out harshly through her nose. “When the driver was expelled out of the CMPNY, Ryder went through extensive measures that he would not be able to drive anyone anymore nor speak. So his tongue was cut and so were some of his fingers. I was thinking that, if you were to communicate through his mind, you may be able to draw forth the location where the CMPNY headquarters are.”
Clint shook his head. “I feel like I’m in an alternate universe right now.”
Ryder smiled. “Don’t worry, once I push him away from everyone and isolate him from everything, he’ll only be able to depend on me. And what better way to live than for your destruction to be at the hands of the one you love. For the rest of our married life, I will own him.”
“That wasn’t your fault Steve,” Tony said, his voice muffled slightly from his lips pressed against Steve’s knees.
Steve looked down and his heart seized in his chest. There Tony was in a similar position to when they first found him in that cold bedroom. His eyes were shut closed, tears streaming down his pale face. His shivering body was curled tightly fingers pressing close to his chest. Steve didn’t take much more time to observe his appearance, before he fell down to Tony’s place on the floor.
“Restrict?” Steve questioned.
Tony waved him off. “Yeah, yeah.”
Tony figured he would stall for a moment and maybe give a few details of the Accords. Surely, they would listen to him for a little bit if he sounded reasonable. And Tony was always reasonable.
Steve raised himself on his elbows so he could look Tony in the eyes. “Oh, you have a nightmare?”
Steve opened the interrogation room to where Ryder was still cuffed. He certainly did look worse for wear. His eyes seemed frenzied and lost. There was an arrow sticking outside of his shoulder, blood seeping through the wound.
“To stay?”
Steve was pressed beside Tony, not wanting to crowd his space, but also not wanting Tony to not have physical comfort. His hand hovered over his shoulders, before he placed them by his sides, unsure of what touch could mean to Tony right now.
“Tolded,” Miles tried repeated. “Why we not video calling baba?”
Steve walked over to the kitchen counter and placed the bracelet there. He walked back to where Bucky and their bags were.
“Ah, stop it. I’m pretty sure I’m the main reason these kids are in the orphanage,” he tried saying it lightly, but Karen’s sad grimace told him he did not succeed.
Steve became frustrated and began pacing back and forth. His hands ran through his hair trying to decide the next move. All of them were looking toward Steve waiting for a command. Steve stopped short at their undivided attention and realized that he needed to step up.
“So maybe we can take this as a starting point to rebuild. We both made mistakes in our past. It will be hard to get over it, but we are a team.”
“Oh, a few minutes hmmm? I think we ought to test how long we could last then,” Steve snorted.
“It’s freaking,” he corrected, “behind you. Like we see it. So you in?”
Steve nodded. “Yeah, you’re fine as hell. However, I said you’re gorgeous. Don’t forget that darlin’.”
But he hadn’t disagreed or pushed back. He was lonely. The Avengers weren’t there, Rhodey was still going through physical therapy, Pepper was dealing with business, and he just needed to have some company. Everyone had been gone and it reminded him of how things were always meant to be.
Marley tossed her hair over her shoulder.
Tony ran his fingers at the collarbone peeking from Steve’s shirt. He wondered how long it would take before the act stopped, the final curtains closed. He hated hospitals, but he wouldn’t mind staying a few more weeks if it meant having this.
So she handed Miles over to Vision, but not without some complaint from Miles. “I know Miles, but we just want to make sure Tony is okay. Vision is going to take you back to the ballroom to watch the puppets, okay? The next time you see me we’ll have your baba back.”
“No, no baba’s not gone. Come on,” Natasha said walking outside of the workshop.
They were all back together and their main purpose was to get Tony back home.
Tony looked up at her from his spot on her lap and for a brief second his vision cleared. The chattering of his teeth broke up a few words, but Natasha was able to piece together, “Natasha? That…you’re here? You all finally came? Steve? Steve here?”
“Yep, those are the little spies in training. Go be with your little followers,” Tony said. “But please don’t teach them your ways this early. I’m still really terrified of you and I don’t think I’m ready for little Black Widows following my every move.”
“Don’t do what?” Tony said, his expression clearing off. “I said a lot of things. Also don’t do things is pretty much like asking me to do something.”
“Yes,” Ryder sweetly said.
“And here I was thinking you were smart enough to get the hint to stay away.”
Steve’s arms tightened and he rested his chin on top of Tony’s head, content to watch his family and friends with Tony.
Steve nodded sleepily already sinking back into the covers as Tony tucked him in. He slipped on his slippers and rose off of the bed and turned back to Steve, leaning over him one more time before he went to the kids’ bedroom. As Tony pressed one last lingering kiss to his forehead, Steve breathily whispered “Love ya, sweetheart.”
“No, you are not going to blame yourself,” Tony sharply demanded. “None of this is your fault, either of yours.”
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Alright punk, first of all grab some meat that isn’t frozen or put that meat in some hot water and we’ll see if we can defrost it.”
“Good,” Miles said hiding his face in Peter’s shirt, once he saw there was more company around. Miles looked over his shoulder nervously.
Natasha nodded and opened the door, in search of said handcuffs. Bucky held the door open for him and waited for Steve to pass through.
“The only thing I need can’t be given,” she said, her hand slipping from Tony’s. “Have a wonderful day Mr. Stark.”
“Look Tony you can’t shut us out. Pepper and I are always here for you, but we can’t help you if you don’t tell us what’s wrong. Is it Ryder? Did he do something? Is it the Avengers? Is it the company? Come on man just talk to me. Just talk to me.”
“Alright and we’re done,” Steve cheerfully announced.
He moved, one foot in front of the other and his body came falling in front of him. He wasn’t even able to catch himself, before his legs folded beneath him. He whimpered at the impact of the fall, but tried crawling toward the door. His body didn’t seem to cooperate.
Tony sniffed. “You won’t find me Steve. I’m off the map. We all are here. There’s no location.”
Steve shrugged. “That was really a backup, but this was more personal. I kind of wanted to give it to you privately.”
Tony looked up distracted. “Hmmm?”
Miriam rolled her eyes ignoring how Tony dry heaved. She drank the last bit of that bottle and tossed it to the side.
Steve argued that he didn’t have any French girl to draw, which resulted in both Clint and Tony snickering for the rest of the day.
“I have no idea. It’s Peter.”
“Don’t you fucking touch him,” Steve grit out not. “Ryder I promise you I am going to…”
“Yes, really you goof,” Karen laughed. “And you’ve done so much for me and my staff. You’re family to me Tony. You’re like the older brother I never even knew I wanted. For so long I was satisfied with you know just it being me, the kids, and my employers. But then you decided to come one day and I latched onto you like a moth to a flame.”
“We traded details back all the time, back in the 30s now you’re too delicate to know what I get up to in between the sheets?” Bucky laughed, seriously amused by this change in his friend.
“Of course boss. Home it is.”
“And Tony,” Natasha added as everyone quickly mumbled their thanks.
However, as Steve’s lips barely touched his he knew he didn’t have to defend his case at all. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut as Steve pressed closer and his hands went from Tony’s hands to encircling around his waist. Tony easily fell into the hold and guided himself closer to Steve until his body was practically only a hair widths apart.
Miles’ sleepy eyes seemed to brighten. “Peter!”
“Set aside the penguin, please. I’ll be back to pick it up later,” Tony said as he stepped aside letting the other group who was waiting to move forward.
The thought of it made him ill and become so vibrant with an anger coursing through his veins. For a moment, his vision swam and he had to rest a hand against the wall in order to steady himself. Bucky and Natasha had followed him. Both had been figures that had grounded him as he struggled to deal with how Fury suggested for him to leave the room and bring Tony in instead.
Steve wasn’t calmed in the least and his eyes darted between the two teenagers. “Peter come on son, what’s wrong.”
“I know that I haven’t been the best boyfriend to you. I know that the bruises I leave on your skin don’t fade away in days. It’s just sometimes I can’t control my actions and I know that it may sound like I’m just making excuses. But just listen to me honey,” Ryder whispered and leaned toward Tony.
“That’s a lie,” Peter announce. “Hello, I think I was the most integral part to this. I brought the ring back from Wakanda.”
“Bucky,” he squeaked and then in a clearer voice repeated, “Bucky.”
As the day grew closer to the evening, Steve looked at the time and realized that Peter’s flight was coming in a little bit. He drove off to the airport and let Tony know that he was on his way to pick up Peter. Tony sent off a quick thanks and told him to make it back safely.
“Yes, and I have no shame in that matter. Though actually just a little because I don’t want to like jinx Miles’ health because he’s been really good so far,” Tony said biting his lip. “I probably should’ve used a different excuse. Crap I probably just could’ve said I was coming down with something and needed to go home.”
?” a woman voiced, heading to the front door. She stepped over misplaced toys and tried brushing her hair back in a manner that seemed appropriate.
“Yeah,” Harley said. “None of this is your fault, so you don’t have to like ya know apologize. That’s not what we want. Honestly, we just came because we missed you. Steve’s not as fun to play UNO with, when you’re not there.”
“Let’s get
Tony did not trust that voice.
Immediately, he was brought back to the moment he first gave that bracelet to Tony at the Stark’s Charity Christmas Gala. He remembered with the fondest of expressions how much that day meant to him, even though there was pain attached shortly after.
“I just want to help you Tony. I mean you don’t have to tell me, if you don’t want to. Just know that I’m always here to listen,” Steve told Tony.
“Juice? I’m not five Steve,” Tony mumbled.
It was-
“I like baba’s,” Miles said.
Tony’s brows furrowed. He rested his head against Ryder’s shoulder as he rubbed Tony’s shoulder. Tony shook his head.
Mrs. Thompson huffed annoyed and began to grab her things. “Come on Flash. You and I can go meet your dad for lunch. Principal Davis. Mr. Stark.” She nodded briefly to them and began to leave his office.
“What?”
Ryder watched with a clenched jaw as Tony ran off to go back home. He waved off the waiter who came to his table. He took his phone out and went through his CMPNY contacts before settling on a name. He looked around the restaurant and locked eyes with some of the patrons of the restaurant. They all nodded once before clearing out of the restaurant.
But here he was finally after months of being with Ryder and he was contemplating calling Steve…because he didn’t want Ryder to stay. He wouldn’t need him to stay once the Avengers were here, even if they didn’t like him. He could pretend that they wanted to stay and that they needed and wanted him. He could pretend…it would be far easier than pretending not to be in physical pain every waking hour of the day.
Steve smiled at her and chose to sit in the chair closest to his bed. Harley must have pulled it so it was directly beside his mom, but Steve chose to create a little distance for some breathing room.
His breath caught and he didn’t want his hands to further explore his body…to see what had happened. He leaned over the bed wincing at his tight muscles. A hand went down toward his legs. He clenched them together. His hands shook as he tried parting his legs to feel…
“Why did you bring them?” Tony said pointing to the journalists. “Also what is this all for? Ryder I would much rather not to be surrounded by…goodness how many people are in here? What are we at, maximum occupancy?”
He left with a chaste kiss at the corner of Tony’s mouth before leaving the building. On his way out, a lady bumped into him looking harried.
“What?”
“Natasha often sometimes gives us the ideas,” he laughed, before skipping away.
“Steve,” Bucky whispered in warning.
The older man smiled. “Steve I do not lose anything. Alright give them to me. And the design is the same as we discussed on Monday, yes?” Steve nodded. “Good, well this should certainly be ready for you before Christmas that way you can give it as the Christmas gift.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “That’s quite literally what I suggested.”
The bar of soap broke between his hands.
Bruce, Thor, Sam, Wanda, and Vision all came in. Thor was seen pushing a cart that had three different Lego sets on it. Tony raised an eyebrow in question as Thor brought it in front of him.
Miles nodded his head quickly. “Okay baba. I’m sorry.”
Steve observed how the lines in his face slowly softened and the tension around his mouth eased up. Steve tried to ignore how watching this made the tension in his own shoulders relax.
“Please. Just please don’t bring my son into this,” Tony slurred, hiccupping around another taste of alcohol.
“Sorry,” Tony said curling into himself. “Sorry. I’m sorry. Don’t know why I…don’t know why I did that.”
Tony shook himself from those thoughts as soon as he realized he could feel Steve’s breath ghosting on his nose.
Tony stood with Miles. “FRIDAY save and shut down everything.”
Before Steve was even able to hand Miles a cup of apple juice, Ryder had handed Miles a cup of his own. Miles looked wearily at the cup, but deciding that he was thirsty he accepted it.
“What the actual fuck,” Tony breathed aloud.
“We’ll stop it after the wedding,” Pepper said laughingly. “But until then just go ahead and accept it. It will be much easier for you, if you do.”
Peter levelled him with a cool glare.
“So I’ll repeat myself again. Don’t make me do it three times. Take off your shirt for us Tony,” Ryder leered eyes growing dark. “Stand up and take off your clothes.”
Steve was so distracted with not wanting to find his shield and put it through Isak’s neck, that he hadn’t noticed Bucky taking the folder form him, closing it, and keeping it underneath his arm. Isak’s eyes immediately closed off and an easy expression overtook him once again.
“I know,” Tony exclaimed.
“Tony, I apologize for my behavior tonight. I truly do. It was wrong. I just sometimes I get fearful that I will lose you and disappoint you. You are the greatest mind of all time and you are here with me and that makes me feel special. However, it also makes me realize how much it can all go away,” Ryder said as he continued walking in the hallways.
“What the hell is wrong with you? Are you insane? You killed our fucking parents,” Isak said. Although he tried calming his voice, he couldn’t help how it elevated with every sharp turn. “Ryder! Stop okay man, this shit wasn’t funny when you did it years ago and it isn’t funny now.”
Bucky nodded his head. “Yeah.”
“I suggest you stop talking now, if you are going to keep suggesting that anything in these folders was safe, sane, and consensual,” Steve bit.
“You need to leave Mr. Stark,” Cali explained looking for Tony’s shoes. “And I don’t know if you’ll have another opportunity to actually get away before Ryder comes back and you both try acting as though nothing happened here.”
Natasha perked up from her seat. “Yes, I vote
A page ripped underneath her tight grasp.
“Now send my son back up to me please. I bet he’s wondering what we’re up here talking about and my son is awfully curious,” Bekah laughed.
“Rhodey you can’t just stop reading the letter to insert your own comments,” Pepper said.
Michelle rolled her eyes and sighed. “I swear if I hadn’t just done an interview with you both, I would assume that you couldn’t speak.”
Tony was grateful that when he entered the school, most students had already been called to the gymnasium for the program. The only thing he needed was to get a name tag from the receptionist and give them some form of ID.
The corners of Bucky’s lips lifted slightly. Tony smiled widely. “Okay dark humor. I can get with that.”
Just as Steve was getting ready to go back to their holding cells, Natasha caught him by the arm, “We have one girl who’s willing to talk.”
Tony whipped around taking his earbuds out of his ear, goggles set lopsided on his face, and oil deep in his fingertips.
Winston then let out a load moan and reverently touched where Tony had hit him. His eyes darkened and his mouth grew slack.
He looked on sadly as Miles burst into tears, when Tony told him he had to leave for a few days. Miles cried inconsolably into Tony’s neck and Tony had to leave the ballroom for nearly twenty minutes, before he returned a sleeping Miles to Natasha. It seemed as though he had quite literally cried himself to sleep.
Fury for his part did look ashamed, but did not seem to regret mentioning what they needed to do.
Also didn't really mean for this to be over 10k, but I didn't want to break it up into two different chapters. But next chapter is definitely going back to its normal programming.
“So how have you been? I see I wasn’t even invited to the wedding. She’s a gorgeous woman by the way. Well done. That did hurt me, but I think the biggest surprise was finding out you moved to Norway. Thought you were always a New Yorker through and through,” Ryder said pulling away from the house and driving out of the neighborhood.
“Exhausted,” Natasha answered. “But still energized? Entertaining kids and getting things ready for the carnival is a job. I don’t know how Karen is able to do that all day.”
By the time Steve had dropped (which thankfully Harley was on time…or early however one wanted to put it) Harley off at school, he began to spend the rest of the day running errands for tonight.
“Okay, Clint time for your lessons in vent hopping to be put to use,” Tony muttered to himself never thinking that he would ever use that knowledge. He stood on the edge of the bathtub and tried to see if there was any way he could fit his body into the vent. It would be a tight fit, but it was certainly larger than an average vent nearly five and a half feet in length and three feet in width. Perhaps the lack of clothes would prove to be an advantage.
