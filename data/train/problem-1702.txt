“Mr Watson had been dining out,” Moriarty explained. “He got back after eleven, but she hadn’t. The wind was howling -
,” Sherlock managed between kisses, too far gone for teasing, which was also a bit of surprise.
Moriarty said nothing. He stood in the entrance with his hands in his pockets and shrugged.
He sighed, aggrieved. John had already been helping before the signals had gone off, of course. John wasn’t even
John felt his temper flaring. If he was being honest, his frustration with Sherlock was due to much more than just being cross at him for becoming destructive. He wanted Sherlock to look at him. Specifically, he wanted Sherlock to look at him, like they sometimes did, like Sherlock didn’t mind being cramped in a base in the middle of nowhere, as long as John was there with them.
“I suppose John keeps the most beautiful room to show to the public,” he said, his patience truly worn thin, and still trying to end the conversation.
This was all, of course, for the best. Part of moving on, surely. Not a sign of being haunted by old memories.
“You can’t think of anything that had happened, that could explain it? This is the first you’ve heard it?”
> I look forward to it ;-)
A day after the spat between him and Sherlock over the bot, a man, who John had never seen in his life, appeared over the ship’s feed. The man didn’t waste time on introductions, apparently preferring instead to launch straight into an interrogation.
What an odd, yet fascinating thing to say. Though, John questioned it.
However, if Manderley was like a living thing, he could deduce it like he could any person. He decided it was time to distract himself by learning the ins and outs of the place, which he imagined he could master fairly quickly. When introduced to a new environment, it simply needed to be studied.
His arms snaked around Watson’s torso and grasped the other man’s hands on the reins, pulling back hard. “Woah!” Sherlock shouted, and the horse almost reared, but did stop.
Watson cleared his throat.
A healer at the clinic would have assumed he suffered from war-related nightmares. John almost wished that were the case. If anything, the memory of his time as a soldier was faded, and somehow even war was more appealing than his current state. Active service had at least meant being active.
“I experimented, extensively, on myself. I knew what I liked and what I had missed. I’ve never—”
“I would forgive him, of course.”
John: he just doesn't appreciate me [stares into the middle distance]
He hadn’t realized he’d been speaking aloud.
“You spoke a bit ago about a way of capturing memories. I’m sorry I laughed. It’s just that I see things very differently from you. If all your memories were unpleasant, you might prefer to forget them too.”
The boat’s retrieval was a long and grim process. He chose to remain distant from it, as if it was happening to someone else. John and Sherlock couldn’t speak privately, and exchanged very few words. Sherlock drifted in and out of the events around them, the only thing grounding him being his ever present focus on John.
He could feel the cold of the window pane pressing into his back.
Sherlock unlocked their bedroom door to find the hallway outside empty, apart from an old pair of shoes. They were small in size, indicating a young man’s shoes, dated in style to at least a decade ago, and hadn’t been worn since. Unlike the last gift, Sherlock found he did not understand the message. He brought them into their room, and slid them into the desk drawer as John began to stir in their bed. With their visit to Doctor Murray, whose intel might create the need for a trial, John had enough on his mind without Moriarty’s diversions.
“It is typical to present witnesses,” Sherlock pointed out, unable to resist poking holes in David’s accusation. John glanced at him. Sherlock got the message - he might have picked the wrong moment to be a smart-arse.
“Sherlock, if you keep that up—”
“I would not, and am not!” Lestrade exclaimed, stopping him with gentle grasp on his arm, which was then used to turn him to face the other man. “Look, yes, your brother contacted me before you even arrived. I thought it very strange a man’s own brother would ask me, a servant, to keep an eye out, but I thought maybe it was for my master’s, and your, safety. I haven’t been
A smile alighted his face, directed entirely at John. John found his boyish energy was infectious. Sherlock was always particularly endearing after he solved a case.
“No,” Sherlock reassured him, “I just haven’t eaten in quite some time.”
“All of those things are entirely plausible!” Sherlock argued, offended that even his imaginings might have contained incorrect details. “But you’re right. It was just a dream. We were in the past, by several decades in fact.” Offhand, with a line between his brows he said, “I suppose I traded the future in for that.”
“The book,” William (apparently) replied. “I now know all the words that were used in that book. I can learn more.”
“Because I — I don’t know how it would be,” he said, the honesty of it freeing. There had never been someone with whom he could discuss these thoughts that pressed in on him from all sides. Once he started telling truths, he feared it would all come pouring out. He reached for Watson, his anchor within the room, holding on to his forearm.
For the hundredth time, John’s gaze refocused on the drained mini-bag. “Okay. Yeah. Maybe there’s more. Like where do those come from?” John asked, waving in its vague direction.
“Not flowers John, dianthus, and whoever or
He supposed he wasn’t exactly acting properly, but John made no complaints beyond turning to face away from his light.
John’s animalistic reactions paused for a moment, as if something had just occurred to him. “That first time Magnussen came here, while I was away in London,” John said slowly, speaking that man’s name with particular venom, “did anything...? Did he...?”
“How did you fare with Moriarty?' John asked, rather abruptly. And unfortunately, given that he had just decided he’d rather not discuss it.
John shifts up and over till he’s on top of Sherlock, and pushes Sherlock’s fringe to the side. First, he kisses that wrinkling forehead, and then that downturned mouth. He pulls back to see the smile replace the frown, and then kisses just the bottom lip, again, and again.
Sherlock winced, and John rushed to correct his truthfulness, though the damage was already done.
,” she says giggling away on her hasty departure.
Janine still looked smug all the same.
He wasn’t sure if this was meant as a compliment, or merely offered as fact.
“That’s not surprising, the whole country is teeming with them,” Sherlock replied, now a touch breathless.
In contrast, Captain Watson was in the process of positioning himself to the right of the door, where he would not be in line of sight. Sherlock went to join him, knocking elbows in his haste.
Sherlock nibbled at the edge of their lip at this, seeming oddly hesitant. “We don’t normally… share our technology with the humans who come to the outer reaches. It’s mutual - humans don’t share anything either.”
Sherlock would have liked to tease him about that bit of contradiction, but even he occasionally knew when to be appropriate. “John, anyone can become frustrated and say something they don’t mean, under pressure and high stress circumstances.”
But then—slow and uncertain, Watson extended his arm toward him, in the fashion of a gentleman offering to lead a lady to the dance floor.
7 times a night, even.
The morning was perfect again.
“There isn’t anybody worth anything here!" Wilkes commented, without any interest in his reply. "If no good company turns up, they’d better damn well not expect me to pay full price. Do they think I come here to look at the help?”
> Those are a dead person’s toes, aren’t they. That is a dead person.
Sherlock grabbed at John’s hands in protest as he made to move them away.
): accountant, late for work again, the sixth – no, seventh – time in the last month. This time because one of his kids was sick, previous tardiness however had all been due to meeting with sex workers at cheap motels and falling asleep by accident (amateur) –
Sherlock didn’t even look in his direction. He abandoned his chalk drawings to stir a mixture in a bowl by twisting his hand in the air above it, sloshing the fuschia fluid inside.
“He showed so much promise, and from such a young age,” the Wizard continued. “I had hoped he might follow my example in working for the Crown, but alas. He insists on being difficult.” For perhaps the first time in their conversation, the Royal Wizard’s eyes met his, and held his gaze. “His heart was stolen, and now, he only uses his magic for petty means.”
“Watch it! Are you trying to say I dress like an old man?" Watson asked, but was clearly not offended in the slightest. "Anyway, I think you’re lying. Not about me being an old man – I suppose I am compared to you – but about the violin. I suspect you play beautifully.”
“I imagine this breach happened not long before I was sent out,” John concluded, easily. He was well aware that he wasn’t normally woken in the middle of the night over a single bot repair.
What Sherlock had once considered impossible now merely seemed improbable, and what remained was the truth, nonetheless. The Mary in his mind was beginning to fill in, and the face painted on looked sinister.
“They’d notice if something like that went missing Sherlock, and I don’t think I need to remind you that this needs to be kept discrete.”
He didn’t need to text Sherlock anything else. There was no reason to continue till he knew how to prevent Sherlock from taking the pill.
Magnussen, an uninvited guest, stood in the middle of the morning room and began to smoke a cigarette - heavy Latakia with Perique, if his memory of tobacco served him. The smell was potent and hung in the air, likely seeping into their curtains.
It wasn’t long before Wilkes opened the room’s door, with no knock as a warning. As a result, the door completely obscured him from Wilkes’ view as he entered and moved straight towards Watson.
“You know, particulars. Blow job, rim job, facials, deepthroat, double penetration, triple penetration, Greek -”
> How is the guide ruined, Sherlock?
It was not like other kisses he had come to expect from John, where John was painstakingly gentle, treating him like glass. It was hard, and honest, and anguished in a way that was as frightening as it was thrilling. It felt like John was saying goodbye.
“Oh,” Magnussen commented, softly and with obvious amusement. “Someone’s grown up since last I saw them. How grown up though I wonder?”
He could feel warmth spreading across his cheeks in a bright pink flush, still overly conscious of his dream from the night before.
Sherlock would need to write back all the same, otherwise it would fall on John. He took the letters to the morning room, supposing he ought to write responses in the place intended for penning letters. Sherlock sniffed the air upon entering, scrunching his nose up in distaste. It was stuffy, musty, old. Like the smell of that damn sailboat. He walked across the room to open all the windows, letting air into the room, and noticed the flowers on the windowsill were almost all dead. Their petals were on the floor, like the azaleas outside in the Happy Valley. Was anyone even working in this house? Before he realized what he was doing, as he had never done such a thing before, he was ringing the bell for the servants. Molly arrived promptly, peering around the door rather surprised.
Sherlock grabbed his husband by the arm, dragging him through the foyer and back out of the house. John attempted to provide some kind of hasty explanation to their host, apologizing for their abrupt departure.
After the call, John returned to the living area to find Sherlock had acquainted themselves with the 3D printer.
Sherlock was agitated. Almost desperate, as if they couldn’t work fast enough.
“Yes, like anything else living or dead,” Sherlock said, sinking into his chair and out of the mirror. “John, this will be much easier if you let go of any and all ridiculous myths.”
The room was silent, aside from John’s heavy breathing, and Anderson’s parts hitting the floor.
Manderley, like a spell, always had the power of causing a dark cloud to pass over John’s countenance. John, who had the patience of a saint, and was by nature a quiet and restrained man. All warmth from his face would vacate, transforming him into something distant and beyond all reach. And he could never resist the desire to please John. The only person it was important to please.
Reminding John of that, now of all times? He had a fantasy wherein he wrapped his hands around Wilkes’ throat and squeezed, which he called upon now to calm himself. Hateful Wilkes!
- as if I care about what happens to Billy!”
Firm in his resolution, he hurried downstairs to find Wilkes outside on the front hotel steps, occupied with instructing the staff impatiently in how to secure his trunks to the outside of the car. This was apparently to be an elaborate process that required several tries, and multiple cycles of the car being almost prepared only to be unpacked once more.
He began an investigation of Manderley that very day, slipping into all the rooms and hallways he could as soon as the staff had vacated the areas. He wore his slippers instead of his loud, clacking shoes to move about unheard. However, as Gladstone was kind enough to join him on his explorations, he was hardly as soundless as he wished. Ah well, the company made up for it.
“Farewell, Mr Watson. It’s been a pleasure. I think I’ll come to see you again sometime.” Magnussen held his hand in his own once more, and lowered his lips to kiss it. Luckily, it was brief.
John and Sherlock exchanged another glance.  “He means Anderson,” John clarified. “He lives with one of my tenants.”
At once the chaste touch was not enough, not nearly enough, not now that Sherlock knew John would not object. He abandoned his chair for the carpet, easing his way across the floor till he could turn to rest his back between John’s legs and against his chair. John made a soft sound when he’d dropped down from his seat, but seemed more than willing to accommodate him if he wanted to sit at John’s feet. John began to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, and he tipped his head further back against the chair’s seat, humming in pleasure. He understood that John took comfort in caring for him. Allowing John to be the comforter rather than the comforted was the best gesture he could offer to calm his husband. Though, admittedly, it wasn’t entirely selfless, as Sherlock greatly appreciated the spoiling.
“The tide won’t have cut him off, I suppose. Does he know his own way back?” he asked, attempting to smooth over his earlier mistake. He wanted John to forget, not remember. Perhaps they had both overreacted, and Gladstone was fine on his own.
Definitely projecting, John thought. “So, why did you leave? And why did you not know how to speak any human language?”
This was unfortunately a self-fulfilling prophecy. His attempts to anticipate John’s collapse only made sure of it, as John was immediately reminded of his limp. His problem was an issue of psychology, after all.
“I’ve been looking forward to introducing you to Gladstone,” John said, while rubbing the dog’s ears. “Do you like dogs, at all?” John asked. He almost sounded nervous.
Eventually, the multiple cars began to organize themselves for departure. Before leaving Lady Norton bid them both adieu, with the promise that she would ring them with all the best people to invite. It was a relief when the cars finally pulled out.
“I have no issue with waiting Mr Watson.” Magnussen’s quiet voice drifted towards him, in contrast to the alarm he felt in the other man’s presence. “Besides, I had promised you another visit, hadn’t I?”
“I’m his new shop assistant,” John said. “And I’ve come here to tell you he’s an incompetent wizard, who is wasting his talents away, and plans to defect. So, if you could stop sending him summons—”
> Let’s change the topic.
John was leaning on the black leather of the chair’s arms, the soft worn thing squeaking with his ill-use of it. John drew back from those lips—
“You’re aware of course that Mary had affairs,” Magnussen stated, and the bottom of Sherlock’s stomach dropped. He imagined John’s did the same. “All married men with lovely wives are jealous, aren’t they? Who knows what they might be driven to do.”
“Why didn't you
On returning downstairs he realized he’d been in the room for much longer than he’d thought. The sought-after owner of Manderley had already left the dining room and Sebastian, likely out of fear of losing him, had initiated conversation without the help of the letter. Wilkes now had his prize in his grasp on a sofa in the lounge.
“Oh, now I’m very sure I’d like to know.”
This conversation was like manoeuvring through land mines. He bit his lip, hard. The taste of blood didn’t help his delivery.
“So, how do you like it, Mr Watson,” Magnussen asked, gesturing to the sports car. “Have you reconsidered being stolen away?”
Irene was watching Sherlock with a soft expression, and John wished she wouldn’t. “Right now, I’m their priority,” she said. “And I need somewhere to hide outside of Belgravia.”
John also had a feeling he wasn’t dead, but that he should try to wake up to be sure. He grunted, his out of use vocal chords protesting.
John nodded. “Well, glad we’re agreed.”
“I understand you’re not using the West wing,” Harry commented, with a false casualness.
Moriarty had the gall to laugh. “Fired?
Stamford’s easy manner was to not mind anything much at all, and he turned to give a small smile to Watson. “Ah, yes, quite all right. Whatever you feel is best for solving my dilemma. I suppose Mr Holmes has already brought you up to speed on it then?”
The man watched the dog retreat, turning slowly on his heel till they were fully facing one another. The uninvited visitor showed no surprise at finding someone behind the door, beyond pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
“I don’t have such a thing,” he said, awkwardly. “I’m sure I don’t need one.”
“You cock! I knew it!”
“I should be allowed to live in a pigsty if I so choose—”
“Quite right, do feel free to get started on that.”
It might have been a magical protection spell for all John knew, but when he slid off the scarecrow and went to touch one side, his hand only met with cold metal.
He hummed, happy to accept the change in topic, even if if that meant discussing his brother. John had cleverly diverted them away from openly addressing Moriarty or Magnussen.
“Yeah, but I never intended for
He fit well into John’s small palm, and he gasped when John finally, finally, gripped him and began to stroke. He’d been grinding himself against John for long enough while asleep that he was already slick with precome, and ready to drive himself hard into the tight heat around him. He let go of John’s hand to the grip the sheets beneath him, willing to trust John wouldn’t withdraw again.
The frame is now diagonal across the floor. John moves to step closer to see–
Sherlock stumbled towards him, collapsing into the armchair across without a word, feathers and scales barely fitting within the confines of the seat. Sherlock shook off the bird-like features with sluggish exhaustion, his face blank.
> Have you been bloody spying on me?
“I’m not up to anything, but John is going to the palace in my stead. In fact, I think it’s time he was off.”
John nodded once, and rang the bell for the servants. When Lestrade arrived, looking about the tense room briefly with concern, John instructed him to take the car and find Anderson at once.
John covers his ears as a screeching sound of metal dragging against wood rings out through the room – the bed frame scratching across the floor - as he jumps backwards, immediately hiding behind the curtains. They’re thin enough that he can stare out from behind them, not quite believing–
As soon as tea was brought to them, John dove into a stack of letters with a heavy sigh. Occasionally John would look up from the task to smile at him reassuringly before returning to the correspondence. He drank his tea and watched John work, which he supposed was to be the way of a companion to such a man. Husband, he reminded himself. He was his husband now.
John supposed it didn’t. Motioning towards the kettle, John said, “Well, you weren’t using it.”
Sherlock, still a bulldog, pawed at the first step, then ran in a circle, his short legs unable to reach the top of the step. “Are you kidding me?” John asked, then sighed, and abandoned his cane to pick Sherlock up in his arms.
“You mean my
“I can see you’re on the right trail,” John said, with a wry smile, at odds with the tone of the conversation.
His body relaxed, and he felt himself begin to fall forward, over the railing. At this moment, the sound of a shot being fired startled him from whatever trance he had entered.
While considering his next move, Gladstone chose for him by stepping forward and beginning to growl.
He struggled. Sherlock watched, and waited.
“He got up to quite a bit of bridging then I gather,” John said with a flirty smile, which made Sherlock look as though they were in a great deal of pain. They groaned and rolled their eyes.
Sherlock and John exchanged a glance. John trusted him.
“There was a man on the shore, dressed a bit like a fisherman,” he said, thinking John might like to know that there was a stranger on his beach.
“Why would she flip them down?” John is starting to feel... agitated. “She was leaving immediately.”
> I’m just saying, you’re not as talkative as you usually are. In fact, you’ve been a bit silent since we met up.
Sherlock stopped directly in front of him, and John didn’t move an inch. Curiosity still marked Sherlock’s features in the form of a wrinkle in his brow, and John found he quite liked seeing a visual tell on Sherlock Holmes. Facial expressions were certainly new.
This was odd, all very odd - in an effort to search for clues, his eyes were caught by a change in the appearance of the house. The West wing, normally all shut up, today had the shutters on one of the windows opened.
“Ah,” Sherlock cries, holding a finger up in the air, “you might hope John, however the police don’t file those for dogs.”
“I know that dog,” the other man declared, pointing at him. “He comes from the house!”
Watson reminded him of a portrait he’d once seen in a gallery. It was a depiction of a Captain in action, someone who was willing to fight and die for his fellow man. He remembered the feeling of the soldier’s eyes watching him, continuing to follow him as he’d walked away.
“I see,” John said, finding it odd, though not odder than anything else in Sherlock’s castle. “And for solving it, what have you tried so far?”
There were two tall iron gates ahead, beside a lodge, with a long drive beyond. He could just make out the faces of people observing them from within the lodge, and he knew immediately they were pressed against the window just to see him. He imagined there would be a lot of that from there on out. Staring, that was.
He was making the right choice. A clean break was better for healing bone, why not for this attachment?
“No, no one else.”
“I thought—oh, I can hardly bear to say it, the plan was so ill-thought out and speaks so poorly of me—but I thought I would see how you would react to its disappearance. But then, you never spoke of it to me. I couldn’t be sure if you had noticed, or when I should return it. I started checking the lockbox at different periods, to see if you had even looked in it, based on whether anything had been moved. I don’t know how you found me out, but I’m glad you did! It has weighed on my mind greatly. Take it back! I don’t even wish to know any more. The past is the past Michael, I swear I won’t think of it any longer.”
Sherlock flushed up. Twiddling his thumbs, “You have to understand. At the time, I thought you were still with your girlfriend.”
There were
“Yes Doctor,” the Colonel prompted. “What was the result of the test?”
“What? That might be because you’ve never asked me, and you always know anyway.”
> You’re welcome, Sherlock. Are you 29 and a quarter, by the way?
*** There's now
She’d called John “Hamish” in the inscription, which was John’s middle name. He understood the preference for middle names quite well, seeing as he went by his own. John’s family, his aunts and uncles, grandmother, sister, they all called him John. People who didn’t really matter to John, the same people John hardly ever thought of, and why John considered himself largely alone in the world. With Mary it had been different. Mary wasn’t like those other people, and Hamish was her choice. She owned the name, written in her bold hand.
John was
John looked out of the small circular window of the charging bay to the bleak landscape beyond. It appeared more violet than blue for the moment, seemingly endless and uninhabited.
, how could John have gotten it all so
“It is my fault as well,” Stamford admitted. “I should have told you what it was. I shouldn’t have kept even this small of a secret from you.”
He had included massage oil in his order list, and Lestrade seemed to have understood very well what that had meant. Or misunderstood rather, seeing as John wasn’t actually in the bed with him. But that was a minor detail he was still working on, and this was something he rather thought he’d like to explore a bit himself first.
“You’re dismissed,” John snapped, short, and crisp. John was truly military, his forceful instructions given in the style of a drill sergeant, John’s way of coping with any situation slipping from his control.
When Sherlock finally spoke, a soft, “Thank you,” once John had finished dressing the wound, John sighed in relief.
“How,” John’s voice cracked and he paused, taking a breath, and swallowed before continuing, “- how could you do this?”
The alien looked up at John sharply, blue eyes shining in contrast against their still silver skin. John knew that likely nothing he said was communicated to the alien, but he thought for a moment that they could understand him, as the silver appeared to darken across their face, with small gold freckles scattering over their high cheekbones.
“Why expose yourself to the temptation?” John finished lamely, staring at the wood.
“Sir,” Lestrade said from the door, “Will Mr Watson be back shortly? It’s only, there’s a gentleman here asking to see him.”
“Wait a minute!” David said. “There just might be someone who saw Watson that night. What if I did produce a witness? You’d have to listen to me then wouldn’t you?”
“I - ” John began, bending down quickly to retrieve the towel. John cleared his throat. “Sorry, but, have we not been recently doing a bit of that, or -”
John’s hand and arm quaked, as it did when reminded of his limp.
John, who was still catching his breath and readjusting to time slowing back down, let out a light, airy sound, rather more like a giggle than a laugh. Short notice. As if it had been John who had demanded that all of that occur. Not to mention—
He’d been letting a lowly insect whisper in his ear, leading him down a path of misery and doubt, giving a dead woman more power than she had. Whatever hold Moriarty had over John, he had to protect John from him all the same. He would take back Manderley from her and her minion, if it was the last thing he did, if only for him to return it to John.
“Mr Watson,” Lady Irene greeted in her false insipid tone, only her eyes giving away her immediate understanding of his lack costume. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”
The book of love poems was in his bedside table, still next to the envelope containing the note John had written him that first night. He opened the drawer, and flipped open the cover of the book.
“The best,” Sherlock said, puffing out his chest.
he was quick to sign, his gestures less steady than they had been earlier.
Sherlock almost laughed, if he hadn’t been terrified of what Magnussen had only but a moment ago implied. John’s temper being unleashed in full would otherwise have been a joy to see. Now however, it was still a liability.
“Yes John, no need to shout,” the Hudson responded, and irrationally John was happy to hear its voice.
Two months. Drowned people were usually found after two days, if they were found at all. The body would have washed up close to the shore when the tide came. Two entire months?
“Why would anyone do that?” John asked, having momentarily forgotten that he was meant to be escaping.
“More for me,” the man murmured, before pressing a wet open-mouthed kiss to the back of his hand. When the man’s lips didn’t leave his skin after a full five seconds, he ripped his hand back, wishing he’d never extended it.
John hurries to catch up. On entering the bedroom, he moves past a desk and the end of the bed to see out the window. Sherlock stands further back, likely so there aren’t so many faces peering out.
“No, you don’t - you don’t understand. If you did, you wouldn’t offer me your friendship, which is still more than I deserve.”
“No one, except,” John paused, before reluctantly admitting, “I believe that Moriarty suspects. Or at least, he knows well that he could accuse me of it. He’s never said anything, not explicitly, but he has a way of letting you know that sort of thing. He knows at the very least that if I let him go, it would appear suspicious. He’s hung it over my head for a year.”
“Does everyone here have a curse on them?” the Witch asked, eyeing the scarecrow’s turnip face. “I’m Irene, by the way.”
Moriarty looked over at Sherlock, innocence incarnate. “Sir, don’t you enjoy a bit of detective work? Perhaps you can help the Colonel, if given a chance to inspect the diary.”
The bot’s video feed and locators had malfunctioned in a sector that John was easily guided to by the bot generated route maps loaded in the scouter. John hoped that the missing bot, which he’d recognized as Mike, wouldn’t have traveled too far from its breakdown spot.
Watson’s eyes on him appeared to mirror his own dark thoughts. The firewood popped in the grate as it burned, breaking Watson’s attention from him, but did not dispel the mood. When Watson spoke again, his jesting tone was gone.
“Oh my God,” John said, jaw dropping open for a moment. “It wasn’t the films. You always knew. You always knew what kissing meant,
They were silent for the rest of the afternoon.
Stepping out onto the kerb, John found an entirely new reason to resent the author. There were two buildings, and John had no idea which one Sherlock was in. If the ride had been quick, he could have waited outside and watched to see when they arrived. Now he didn’t have that luxury.
He tucked in his chin at the thought to partially conceal his face. Lestrade came towards him anyway, to help him out of his coat.
“She even predicted our divorce–“ John bites the inside of his cheek from saying that wasn’t a hard deduction and is luckily successful “–anyway, do you want me to give you her contact info or what?”
He transformed with his newly acquired energy, and flew out the barred window of the cellar, leaving John behind.
The man’s left hand reappeared to draw the sheet down past his right shoulder. His other hand continued to touch his nipple, now pebbled from the attention.
“Mr Watson,” Magnussen said, speaking slow and clear, “I’ve come to congratulate you on the result of the inquest.”
“What happened to dinner?” John asked, joking, but also thrown for a complete loop. Once he had the lost reins on the terms of their interaction, he had lost them completely. “And why would I come back to your flat?”
Closing the book with a snap, he returned to his notes on the samples he’d collected, which needed reviewing and further clarifications.
This was all Mrs Hudson needed to know before she was ushering Irene into the castle, and offering her fresh towels for her bath. John sat himself and the dog down, and waited.
John laughs. “It’s just a graze. And you’re the one we should be worrying about.“
-”,  in time with each of John’s thrusts with his tongue. All it took was one well timed teasing circle, tongue pressing past the muscle’s resistance, and a particularly hard stroke to his cock, till Sherlock was coming hard across his chest, some of his release landing as high as his neck. John continued to work his hole through his orgasm, drawing it out, till he thought he might black out from pleasure.
“What are you dressing up as?” Clara asked him quietly, while John and Harry bickered amongst themselves.
“No maiming,” he promised, and he could feel himself smiling. The kind of smiling when you know something someone else doesn’t.
John had a feeling, which was growing stronger by the minute, that this moment was a turning point. He could either deflect whatever Sherlock was asking him, or he could lay his cards on the table, right then, when Sherlock finally wanted to talk.
Did Watson think he’d been needling him for a lift? And so he’d offered out of propriety? Even worse, did he think he desired his company for his status? As they’d left the hotel, the staff had treated him much differently than how they had acted towards him before. Now that he was seen about the place with John Watson of Manderley. He remembered his father’s dislike of superficial snobbery, and couldn’t help but hate himself for the changes in others.
Sherlock didn’t even bother looking in John’s direction. The rectangular printer sat on the floor between them, every part of it transparent, including its currently fast-moving nozzle. It had just completed printing an L-shaped object by the time John finished crossing the room.
“Why did the new guest room have to be in the basement?” she asked. “What do I have to do around here to not stay in the damp basement flat?”
To his surprise, John’s expression fell, his face crumpling, before John pulled him close into a tight embrace. Overwhelmingly relieved, he thought of nothing else but hugging John back, and burying his face into the space between John’s head and shoulder.
I said think, not feel.
>  OK. Wow. Off to the races, you are.
your company, indeed. He owns your company, John,” Sherlock sighed, rolling onto their back in the tight space. “And he’s my brother.”
” Sherlock shouted again, the noise seeming to come out from their gills while their mouth was covered. “He can’t be exposed to the natural environment of this planet!”
. It’s worth a try.
“Sir, please calm yourself!” Colonel Barclay yelled out, and Sherlock instinctively stood in front of John, as if that would keep them away from his husband.
The lack of ‘unique’ personalities was a complaint Wilkes made most evenings, to the general offence of the other diners in the hotel as well as the wait staff. While he observed that the staff hated Wilkes, they were unable to direct their resentment to their actual target without fear of losing their positions. However, Wilkes’ meek and socially inferior companion was of course fair game.  The waiter this particular evening had brought him a plate of cold cow’s tongue, which had already been sent back to the kitchens at lunch. He had swallowed his own tongue enough on this trip to find this completely unappetizing.
The Royal Wizard motioned to John with one outstretched hand. “Wizard Sigerson’s new shop assistant, come to tell me that the wizard will not come to the palace of his own free will.”
“Sherlock,” John said, shaking his shoulder, which was only becoming more gelatinous. “Stop this. Your tantrum was amusing at first, but now you’re scaring Archie and Mrs Hudson. They’ve had to leave.”
Hands moving in a flurry of motion, John freed the both of them from their trousers before pulling Sherlock further back along the window seat. They both moaned as their cocks aligned, John pulling on his hips with an unrestrained possessiveness, as they frotted against one another in a steady rhythm. John took hold of Sherlock’s larger hand, curling it around their cocks together. Sherlock couldn’t tear his eyes away from the sight of them, focusing on keeping his grip just right, just the way John liked it.
The ragged edges of skin were misleading, creating the appearance of a wound long healed. To John, it only confirmed that he would never find any lasting comfort through non-magical medicine. It wasn’t the physical body that needed treatment.
Perhaps counterintuitively, it was John who often tired of whatever he was doing, and would invariably question him about his work.
“Again? I’ve already observed you, multiple times,” he’d reply. Of course he would never say no, but he liked it best when Watson had to plead with him.
“All right,” John reassured them, instantly drawing away his other hand from Sherlock’s groin. “What’s wrong? Should I stop?”
Adoring Mary. It seemed everyone had.
> I’m only teasing ;-)
“Nothing,” Sherlock said, crisp and clear, placing his hands on the chair arms as if to vault himself from the conversation. “Are we out of... biscuits? Maybe I should get some.”
” John snorted. That certainly wasn’t a Sherlock he was familiar with.
John realised, belatedly, that in a normal situation the only person who could have known about the suitcase was the killer. John hadn’t thought of that before, but it was clear to him that it had of course occurred to Sherlock.
> Sherlock, should I even be seeing this?
John’s eyes widened in apparent disbelief, overcome just from looking at Sherlock.
“A message from the club, sir,” Moriarty’s lilting voice spoke through the door. “Mr Watson arrived safely ten minutes ago.”
Sherlock’s body had been encased in slime. It was as if he was part pudding, and John just had to scrape past the top layer to find his skin beneath. This was entertaining in a way, till John became aware that he was uncovering Sherlock’s body, only partially obscured by the green ooze. Even with his eyes averted, and even with Sherlock being half jelly, John couldn’t help but take in his nude form.
“But why did you not tell Stamford before?” Watson asked.
The whole right side of his body was hot, even though John was pressed along his front. He was burning up, on fire, bucking his hips into John’s fist, and against the hard length he felt in John’s breeches. The room began to shake, the china on the mantelpiece tinkling, John’s voice low and encouraging in his ear.
“I do hope the party won't be dropped,” she’d said, clutching at his arm in a beseeching manner. His mask had dropped to eye her hand on his jacket sleeve with disdain. “You must use your influence with him! There wasn’t one last year, of course, but two years ago it was quite enchanting. Manderley so lends itself to fancy dress. The hall looked wonderful. There was dancing in the hall and music in the gallery. A tremendous thing to organize, but everybody appreciated it.”
Why did
> That was. Well, easier than I expected. And I can tell you’re not lying - that’s got to be your real name.
“I don’t want you to look like that,” he said, in a momentary fit of honesty.
Sherlock shuddered, eyes turning to the door, wondering if he could warn them all before it was too late.
He snorted. Understatement of the century.
Sherlock met his gaze for a moment, begging John silently to trust him. “I’m going to head back early, I think,” he replied, smiling apologetically at Colonel Barclay. “I’m quite drained from the day. I hope the Colonel won’t mind giving you a lift back to Manderley after a quick stop in Kerrith.”
“I swear I wish everyone thought I was as much of a philanthropist as you do!” John held him tightly, and though he thrashed for a moment, he eventually settled.
“I would be less startled if I knew your name, and your business,” he responded, smiling in the way he knew could be alarming. “I wasn’t expecting any callers this afternoon.”
“It’s the painting,” he said, his voice hushed, smaller than he’d ever heard himself, as Lestrade guided him back up the stairs. “It’s just the painting from the gallery.”
“You don’t know anything,” Moriarty snarled, moving towards him, and then pausing, thinking better of it. “Mary and I
John’s brow furrowed, but he quickly caught on. “Is this about the lady who contacted you through my old acquaintance Stamford? Mrs Hudson?”
“Is something annoying you?” Watson asked.
Sherlock’s lips were still in contact with John’s cheek, and he pulled back slightly to speak. The numbness of the shock was beginning to recede and he was able to think again - something he hadn’t been doing enough of lately, or too much of, depending on one’s perspective. He had certainly overthought the fancy dress ball to disastrous results.
“Farewell Mr Watson.” The click, followed by a dial tone, signalled the end of the call, and the last of his dealings with Magnussen.
“When had you seen the gallery last?” he asked instead, setting her up for the bait of his own scheme.
John realized that if Sherlock was content to stay with him for a time, he would let them. John thought he might let them stay with him for as long as they liked.
“Jesus, Sherlock!” John admonished, still having to shout. “Must you antagonize her?”
All the breath seemed to leave John’s body in one long exhale, his guarded expression opening in honest surprise. John’s grip on him tightened, and he realized they were both clinging to each other like they were one another’s last lifeline.
“His bed,” John repeated.
Moriarty laughed. “For a moment, I almost thought you had actually figured it all out. You always want everything to be clever, don’t you, and you always want the goodies to win. Big brother having gotten rid of your hubby’s wife for you!”
You don’t like the celery being saved by the cheese. I suppose that’s it. Okay. Scratch that. Let’s mix it up. The cheese is now a potato, and the celery has to—
He was annoyed with John. Very annoyed. Or at least, that’s what he had planned to mope about. Stew in his irritation with John.
“Yes, very charming, please feel free to see to your other duties.” Would his efforts to rid himself of this person end sometime before eternity?
Sherlock draws the flower in question from his jacket pocket. John recognizes it as the one last left on the kitchen table. He holds it up delicately, passing it to John. “Sentiment.”
John felt—relieved. Sherlock hadn’t forgotten about his curse. He’d maybe even been beating himself up about it. John couldn’t help the smile that grew across his face, as he reached into the bath water to find Sherlock’s hand. John pressed the flannel into Sherlock’s palm, and closed his fingers around it.
“Confirming a suspicion. You can see from the wear along the outside edges of the curtain that the Wilsons’ neighbour, Ms Hammersmith, spends her time pressed against the window staring out right at both their front and back doors.”
John couldn’t take his eyes away from them, which was when another realization took hold. “The bots,” John said, half-way through completing his thought.
On a whim John calls Dr Davenshaw, the original source of his troubles.
John breathed in, resting his weight on the railing, and aimed a kick directly over the key-hole with his good leg. The wooden door swung open after the first try, revealing more stone steps within.
“Particular requests...?” John looked back to the man on his screen, who had returned to tapping his fingers against the side of his face in agitation.
They joined the other servants, all ecstatic that Sherlock had been found. Lestrade clapped him on the back, and Gladstone eagerly licked his palms. Colonel Barclay, who had dropped John off, had already been sent out to call for help. They were still waiting for them to arrive, but likely, it would be far too late.
. Sherlock suspected John’s strategy was the more women he attempted to pull, the more likely he was to succeed. Quantity over quality, as far as Sherlock could tell.
“Well, no, you were rather. Like this, I suppose,” John answered, vaguely.
The lights in the room were dimmer than they had been earlier, and the door was closed. It was late, after midnight, on a quiet ward floor, and John had just said—
John wasn’t the only fan of Sherlock Holmes, with the books being so well loved and known. A friend of his had once tried to bond with him over the series, which had ended with the friend being downgraded to casual acquaintance. The friend had hero worship in his eyes, but for all the wrong reasons as far as John was concerned. He admired Sherlock’s cold reason and detachment, his interest in the game and the puzzle above all else, and especially his disdain for other people. That had, of course, rubbed John up the wrong way; Holmes wasn’t a bloody puzzle-solver, John had argued passionately, he just liked drama and was a bit of a loner.
He wasn’t particularly remarkable, John noted. Middle-aged with an accent and old gear, all suggestive of his lower social class. He also seemed to be operating alone, which John thought was rather good news for them. Surely, with two against one…
“No. It’s good,” John said, low and gruff. “That’s
> Right.
Watson had already teased him endlessly about not knowing the sun went around the Earth. Or was it the other way around?
John realized he had greatly misinterpreted Sherlock’s occasional standoffishness. Sherlock had wanted to befriend John all along, and had perhaps not known how. The idea of Sherlock watching him from afar all those months, and maybe simply wanting to know him, made John feel like he’d been an idiot twice over.
John waved Archie over to him, and took the note from his hand. After reading it, John understood why he hadn’t seen anything but the inside of the castle and the moors for almost a week.
“We should never have come back to Manderley. Oh God, what an idiot I was to come back here.”
This time only a second passed before John received a terse reply.
John hummed, looking back down at the paper. “Even after all those things she told the tabloids?”
“What’s the matter?” John asked, his smile dropping, concern etched in his features. “Has anything happened?”
And, with a mischievous look in John’s direction, Sherlock extended his arm.
“Did you have a bit of a crush?” John teased, smiling against their hair. “Was it the suit that did it for you, or….?”
Typical of dreaded things, the anticipation was in a way worse than living through the actual event itself. It was a great relief when it was finally time for them to walk out to the car. He and John hadn’t had much cause to go on drives since Monte, and the act of it was calming, familiar. Sitting in the passenger seat beside John was infinitely better than being stuck in Manderley, waiting like sitting ducks.
So John kisses him, slow. Not desperate, he doesn’t lose control. There’s been an energy in Sherlock since the start of this speech, the explanation, and it all comes out like a bad spirit exorcised, drawn out from his mouth in a mist. It leaves the same way it came, through the crack in the window.
“Sorry, I’m not—God Sherlock, I’m not actually mad about that. I’m worried about you. You just OD’ed for Christ’s sake. And now we have to worry about Moriarty again, apparently.”
“Oh, are these fighting words? And what exactly did you know about me then?”
Sherlock was having trouble meeting John’s gaze. It was very direct, and blue, and as of recent times, saw far too much.
Fantasies, John thought, he was familiar with. “What about this? Right now?”
Sherlock ground his teeth, wishing that John had done far worse. “Messenger indeed,” he bit out.
Moriarty bent down for the slippers beneath the chair, and forced his hands into them. The man was smiling, truly manic now. He was staring at him still, always watching his face.
Sherlock froze. When he could move again, Sherlock looked as if he couldn’t decide if he were more embarrassed for himself, or for John and that comment. John still hadn’t stopped rubbing his face.
_______
This not-peacock bird—a duck, we’ll say—thought the peacock was the best bird he had ever met, but he knew he would have to hatch a plan if he wanted the peacock to look twice at him. He tricked the peacock into thinking he was the same as him by collecting bright, colourful autumn leaves, and stuck them in his back to make them look like tail feathers.  When the peacock saw—
He faced forward, and hummed, noncommittal. He would rather talk about Manderley’s finances than John’s sister. She’d already been a sore spot for him personally (his long ago blunder of assuming John had a brother rather than a sister), and his bad luck with respect to her only seemed to continue.
“John,” Sherlock said, drawing his hands away from John’s face. “Why is there a witch in our castle?”
John had intended to ignore any form of passive aggressive communication from Mary he might encounter, but the ‘Shag-a-lot Holmes’ had proven too attention grabbing to ignore. He wouldn’t have been able to miss ‘Holmes’ written in a 6-point font nota bene, let alone when it was prominently featured in a loud front-page headline.
His own
> Interesting how?
“What were you thinking about?” Sherlock asked when the kiss broke off, turning fully onto his side to face John. “Before your death. Or, what was your death, in the version of events I’m familiar with.”
“You don’t even like milk!” John called after him, but Sherlock was already across the room, coat in hand.
“There you are, gorgeous,” John gushed, brushing Sherlock’s fringe back with his cleanest hand, and kissing him there along the hairline, where he had massaged Sherlock before. John kissed him across his brow, his cheekbone, his chin. John rubbed his shoulders, skirting across the dip in his neck, whispering, “You were wonderful.”
“My brother wrote me a letter when I first arrived here, warning me that he couldn’t protect me, suggesting he had a shared history with the place. He knew I was in a den of vipers, which given his distaste for legwork he’d been handling remotely, and long before I was ever connected. It was my brother who hired the assassin, who organized to kill your right hand, wasn’t it Jim?”
Sherlock surveyed the room from his preferred position by the mantle, avoiding the card tables and the dancing line formation. Watson kept catching his eye from over the shoulders of his dancing partner. The slight tilt to his mouth suggested he and Sherlock were sharing a private joke. He couldn’t help but return the expression, though he wasn’t sure what the joke was.
If it was a caller, a servant would have shown them into the library or the drawing-room. From the drawing-room they would have been able to see him approaching as he walked across the lawn. They would see him coming and be prepared, and here he was left unawares.
Not for the first time, he reflected on how potentially foolish this all was – running off with a man after a few weeks of acquaintance. And yet he couldn’t escape the fact that being near John felt absolutely correct. The feeling of synchrony had been immediate and stronger than anything he had ever contended with. He felt certain that to resist it would be his destruction.
“I wonder why the county paper would want to speak with you,” Moriarty pondered aloud, rubbing his chin and looking upwards.
John wakes up to an intense throbbing in his head and blearily opens his eyes to sunlight streaming in through a nearby window.
“At least there’s some protection on this thing,” John said, struggling for several more minutes.  No matter how hard he tried, he could not even reach out to touch the door, let alone try to open it.
“And what have I done now?” John asked. While he had estimated the time of death for a body not two feet from them, Lestrade did have people hired to perform that assessment.
“By all means,” Sherlock said, feeling his brows meet in confusion.
While John’s eyes lit up at the mention of protection, the topic was once again forgotten in favour of more pressing concerns, such as what curry John ought to order for dinner.
“This isn’t exactly my area.” Sherlock is looking anywhere but at him. John has screwed this all up royally. John had been afraid of pushing him too far, pushing him away, and Sherlock had been afraid that it had meant -
John made eye contact with Sherlock, who nodded their head once. John, still up to that point holding his gun with a death grip, dropped it from his hand. At that precise moment, a particularly strong hit struck the ship’s right side, causing the gun to be set off-course.
“You did a walk through of the place earlier, does the daughter’s bedroom have an okay view of the garden?”
Sherlock waved their hand, dismissing the suggestion immediately. John found Sherlock’s various gestures and tics entertaining, as while they were certainly strange, John was always able to understand what they meant.
He bent down, concealing his expression by patting Gladstone’s head. “I’ve hardly seen him,” he said. This was somewhat true. He hadn’t seen much of Moriarty, though now he was questioning whether Moriarty had been trailing him all along.
, listen. Backing up, I am a sign interpreter. I have a caller on the line who uses sign language, and I’ll be interpreting the call for both of you tonight. So if you can keep it fairly straightforward, it’d be appreciated.”
It also meant Moriarty had played him spectacularly. Moriarty had known all along that John and Mary’s marriage had been a sham. That talk of John being jealous, and Moriarty finding them together in the bedroom - that had all been invented, hadn’t it? To lay him low, to manipulate him?
Another creak at the top of their stairs announced John’s imminent arrival moments before he walked into their sitting room, a medical kit and kettle of boiling water in hand. Gladstone jumped up from where he had been lying at Sherlock’s feet, racing over to greet John, tail wagging. Sherlock felt much the same, but remained seated.
Sherlock sounds like a bowstring drawn back too far, and John feels like the arrow against it, living in anticipation of being released. John didn’t mean for this. He’s just trying to get across—he’s just trying to convey—how lucky he feels. I’m sorry, John says.
The video relay service hadn’t even wanted him; even with his certification, his tremor had posed a concern right from the start. In the end it was his sister who had gotten him the job, to John’s immense annoyance.
Maybe dying isn’t so nice. John wouldn’t know; he’s never had the luck. John does know a thing or two about nightmares, though, so when he does get up the courage to ask—just ask him!—he goes with: bad dream?
“Yes?” Sherlock tentatively agrees and asks. John slides further backwards, making room in the bed, and Sherlock gladly climbs back in.
Attempting to be reasonable, John supposed that to a man interested in a gay sex hotline, a woman interpreter probably did ruin the effect.
, just - ” Sherlock breathed out noisily through their nose. “Look it’s … it’s like a penis, but it’s not, exactly.”
John was watching him with a look of abject wonder, but it was still too sad for his liking. John, still leaning on his cane, reached out and cupped his cheek with one hand, mimicking his gesture from earlier. The lack of sleep from the night before, and the weight of the news, showed in the lines in his tightly drawn face, and bags beneath his eyes.
John ate the rest of his Indian food while he waited for a response. He waited a long while, and once he started to sober up, was a bit horrified with everything he had written to this complete and utter stranger. A stranger who knew exactly who John was. The exchange had been embarrassing from start to finish, and John closed his laptop for the night with the intention of pushing it from his mind entirely.
“I had a plan!” Sherlock protested. “I was going to allow him to kidnap me and then outsmart him, which I could have done easily. Hope, the man was called, thought he was very smart indeed. Thought he’d been chosen especially for this task.”
The first: “You’re him, are you?”
“Nice?” Watson asked, open to a new conversation topic. He would have responded, if Sebastian had not spoken over him once more.
Once he was out in the corridor, John was already at the lifts. “John!” he called. John turned slightly, but did not enough to face him.
“Why not?” Watson asked, as if that was that.
“I live in wait of the right partner,” Sherlock said, regretting it soon after.
“Look, I’m not really interested in force feeding you. Mr Watson mentioned you had actually only mimed eating during dinner.”
John was worried that he wasn’t happy - was John projecting?
John raised his eyes, wanting to see Sherlock watching again. He wanted to make Sherlock see it—his own cock disappearing in and out of John’s mouth, the
“She was so tremendously popular, you know. Such a personality.”
In the kitchen, Sherlock says. With the celery and the round bit of cheese.
Magnussen tsked. “Perhaps you really don’t understand, Mr Watson. What does an old house matter to you, once you’ve been hanged?”
In the land of Ingary, it was said that fortune favoured the youngest sibling, though John had never found that to be the case. Outliving his sister and parents could be considered lucky by some perhaps, but returning home to Ingary without a single living relative didn’t feel like any great fortune.
True to John’s word, it was fine. All fine.
The dog simply continued to pant, while the Witch wrapped her retrieved pocketwatch chain around her wrist.
When the Coroner did speak, the man seemed to wish he didn’t have to. “What holes in the planking? What do mean by man-made holes? What are you suggesting?”
“What?” he asked, dumbly.
His head was hanging down, chin to chest, so that it seemed like the wet back of Sherlock’s head was speaking to him. John poured more water down Sherlock’s neck and back, washing away any lingering slime.
Mary had never shown an interest in tabloids before, but the front page featuring her smug maid of honour was apparently the exception to the rule. John felt certain this was meant to be found, and to sting.
Now charmed, John played along. “Okay. What are you going to disguise me as?”
The words sounded like his own doubts repeated back to him.
“But what about my note?” David asked. “That wouldn’t explain why she wanted to meet me.”
“I’ll explain, later,” Lestrade kept saying. He didn’t care,
without ruining the moment? But then: a whimper, and the tip of his index finger slipped inside.
!” Moriarty said, splaying his arms out wide.
They were standing as close to one another as two people could without touching, but which somehow left enough room for Sherlock to crane his head downward to better scan John’s face.
John’s hairline lowers giving the appearance of raised brows. He finds himself both skeptical and immediately pleased by Sherlock’s use of ‘we’ rather than ‘I’.
“And no servants have left mysteriously in the night, I suppose?”
Now that it’s much darker outside he can see multiple holes in the wall and wallpaper along the three inner sides of the room that allow in some light to the otherwise completely pitch black room.
“Lestrade,” John said, out of breath, “I appreciate all your help, but -”
“I don’t know sir, maybe eat it,” Lestrade suggested glibly.
“You can barely scrape together two sentences without offending anyone at my parties, what are you going to say to all his friends? The Manderley parties were famous when she was alive. I assume he’s told you all about her, and their social gatherings. His family’s reputation was rather stunning when she was running things.”
“Not exactly straight, either,” John finished, finally not looking away from that all-seeing gaze.
“I’ve seen you eat toast and honey,” John said.
John tears it off in large strips, moving along the hall towards the kitchen entrance and main hallway. He finds it, whatever it was that he had been looking for, which in this case turns out to be an edge. An edge that is clearly part of what was once a door.
“Oh,” he said. “Oh.”  He’d known that.
, in the same way other married couples might use more saccharine endearments. John thought this was charming. It was.
Watson smiled at him, benign and pleasant, painting a very different picture from the cuttingly sarcastic man from the night before. How easily he could hide his nature, slipping into docility like a disguise.
He didn’t know the answer, and he didn’t like Sebastian’s smile. For one desperate moment, he wished that none of this had ever happened.
?” Moriarty snarled, whirling towards him. “She was meant to be working
John sighs. “Well, nothing new going on in the outside world since last we checked.”
At this, he finally turned to John in agitation.
This was enough to make Sherlock smile; John made note of that. “Yes, I know,” Sherlock said, one eyebrow lifted. ”I have seen a photo of you, on your blog.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He was being summoned. Not in the traditional sense of course, and yet still equally as undeniable and persuasive. John had that effect on him.
Without climbing over the table, John joined him, sitting in the remaining space available to the left. Sherlock remained silent.
Stamford laughed and clapped him on the back on his exit, relief over having his brooch returned to him evident.
His continued existence indeed. A moment passed where it was clear they both thought of the falls, and what might have transpired if Watson had not arrived in time to save him from Professor Moriarty. Despite his and Moriarty’s difference in height, it turned out he was not as strong in a physical bout atop a slippery precipice as he might have thought. The possibility that he would be the one to go over the side of the falls, either alone or with the professor, had been a near thing. Worse than the fear of losing his own life was the thought of leaving Watson to mourn for him; he felt that, strangely, with the bone deep intensity of the experienced.
By the time John had pushed one finger past Sherlock’s lips for him to suck, Sherlock was far beyond all reason, licking with enthusiasm and continuing to rut and push back into John’s erection. When John pressed that single wet finger against his hole, sliding in just the tip, it was more than enough to push Sherlock over the edge, coming hard over the sheets beneath him. Barely managing to get his breath back, Sherlock insisted that John still take him -- but John had promised him later. John had also promised that him coming like that had been the hottest thing he’d ever seen, and had thrust against his arse immediately after till he made a mess of Sherlock’s back.
"That's ridiculous, you’re being ridiculous,” he insisted, in a rush to squeeze the words out before John could be allowed to continue being an
Oh, had his old
“And what exactly am I supposed to be letting live, Mrs Hudson?”
“I thought maybe you’d forgotten how to talk,” John joked.
He pressed his hand into the top of the door, remembering at the last second that he couldn’t vault over it like he was in the habit of doing. He quickly changed tack, grasping for the handle. He managed to successfully exit the car, only to be met by many prying eyes. He wondered when their curiosity would die down, and hoped for sooner rather than later. How was he supposed to go about his business if he was to be gawked at like the new intrigue?
He could feel the self pity overtaking him till he feared there would be nothing left. Desperate, he clung to the only other emotion he could experience, and it was of course the antithesis of what had brought him here. Hatred.
“Charles August Magnussen,” the man offered. “I’ve come by to see the old place, and my old friend, Jim.”
He had prepared additional impressive observations, but found that they had all promptly left his head. Acceptance and praise for his usually derided talent was so out of the ordinary, he wasn’t quite sure what to say. He was afraid if he tried to speak, only gibberish would come tumbling out. Foolish things like ‘never stop looking at me like that’ and ‘do you know you smile when you’re angry?’ and ‘let’s have dinner.’ Had they only just had breakfast?
The flower’s petals were crushed and bruised, their once white colouring stained around their edges. However, as he rubbed it against his palm, the scent of the flower became strong and sweet.
Normally this would not have bothered him, he might have even appreciated the second hand smoke, but he was aware this was considered rude. Smoking in someone’s else house, dripping ash on their floor (when there was a perfectly good ashtray available), in their all-pastel hosting room. The act of it was almost... territorial.
John didn’t feel like answering, so he didn’t. He wasn’t in the mood to be reminded that living on BAK 2212 wasn’t a permanent situation.
“The garden’s on the other side of the house, if we’re going to watch for anyone snooping in it, shouldn’t we be over there?” John suggests, wanting to get away from the turned down photos, and back to feeling like they were doing something within his grasp.
“Can you?” John mused, though Sherlock paid him no mind.
Silence descends, colder than that damn breeze. John has been meaning to get that window fixed. John has a feeling this is about more than whether he remembers the specific flowers.
He didn’t need to be told they would not be dining together that evening, which was confirmed by Watson’s continued silence when they arrived back at the hotel.
“He gets like this sometimes,” Sherlock heard John say. It was fond. Did John always sound so fond? He wondered how many details he had missed over the months, all from being too close to the subject.
They came to see them only so they could return to their own nests, whispering behind tea cups, their saucers clutched in their talons. “Haven't you heard? John found him in Monte Carlo or somewhere, without two pennies to rub together. He was a companion to some other man.” It all unfolded like the following scene in their play. Cue the laughter, and the raised brows. “You can't be serious? John, who was so faithful? How could he, after Mary?”
“Try every exchange in London!” David protested. “That’ll take you all night, this is just another play for more time!”
“Wait. No. If Janine knew the two of you weren’t - ,” John broke off, pressing his index finger along the line of his upper lip. “If Janine was playing along, then whose benefit was that display for when I came over?”
. However, John asking him to come normally would have swayed him. But now, now, he was also
“I should tell you to fuck right off.”
As smoothly as he could, John sucked Sherlock down like it was his last meal. As soon as he had taken as much of Sherlock into his mouth as was feasible, he drew back off again, and repeated the movement.
Sherlock was about to point out that Moriarty’s connection with the press had in fact planned to backstab him, but was interrupted by the sound of shouts coming from the east, traveling up from the lawn.
He awoke with a startled cry, realizing that the latter sensation had in fact not been imagined. Several things became clear instantaneously - it was the middle of the night (half past one), John had come to bed following him after an early dinner, and he had just woken John up by pressing his erection repeatedly into the back of John's upper thigh. John had turned over in response, and was currently holding him still with a hand to the back of his head.
“That you still love Mary. That you always have, and that you always will. I understand that John. I’m sorry that I ever tried to change it. We can still be happy like this, with what we are, when you help me with my cases and I -”
Watson seemed to be contemplating this. “That made you uncomfortable? You really aren’t cut out to be around people like Sebastian Wilkes, are you? You’re too …. You’re not like that.”
And his conversation with Lady Irene had in no way resembled flirtation, but perhaps being seen in the lady’s presence at all was enough cause for suspicion.
“We will learn soon enough,” Sherlock assured him, ready to prepare the final touch.
Gladstone paid him no mind and continued his scrambling way up the boulders. Who had trained this damn dog? John? Of course John. Probably spoiled him rotten, and now he thought he could go wherever he pleased and his owner would simply follow. No obedience.
“The staff of the house, I presume?” he asked in response, attempting to appear unaffected in the face of John being worried for him. John becoming upset over the nature of his introduction to their new home was the last thing he wanted.
“That’s a matter of perspective,” Sherlock said. He shut his eyes tightly while breathing out a long exhale, before continuing. “You see, as you were apparently growing up reading novels about me, I grew up reading a comic book series.”
“So, what do you think?” Sherlock asked, a small grin growing across their features.
- clean from her torso. Mr Watson had to go to identify the body. He went up to Edgecoombe to go see her, all alone. He was very,
John couldn’t disagree with that.
John was prepared for that reaction. Resigned to it.
John had a feeling the second paragraph of the email was the culprit for why this email had taken longer than the others. It was obvious SH didn’t like not understanding, and that they had never considered that their personal experience was not necessarily universal. Some people were more than capable of having anal sex without needing affection or attention paid to them afterwards.
“Why don't you go?” Moriarty sung, his voice changing in pitch with every syllable. “He doesn't want you, and he never did. He can't forget her. You know he can’t. All he wants is to be alone with her again. She’s dead, but really, it should be you instead.”
“Then we’re at disadvantage. I know far more about you.” Realising that made him sound like a stalker (which maybe wasn’t far off?), he clarifies himself. “I’m a consulting detective. I’ve deduced things about you.”
“Why didn’t you say?” John asks, still completely amazed.
John made the decision for him by reaching up to hold the back of his neck, and pulling him down into a hug. He felt immediately comforted, and hadn’t realized how badly he’d needed it. He wanted that light pressure of John’s hand against his neck, the feel of it, memorized. Bottled, like he’d once said to John in Monte Carlo. When John pulled back, he realized belatedly he hadn’t returned the gesture in any way, too focussed on the hug itself.
More alarmingly, there was a man on the beach at whom Gladstone was barking.
He stroked John first, wanting to get a sense of his girth, and remembered John doing the same for him. He prayed determination and care would make up for his lack of experience.
“It’s a very charming room, and I’m sure I’ll be comfortable,” he said, hoping to end this little discussion. Perhaps because he hated not having the last word he emphasized, “I understand it’s been done up for our return. It’s just how I would like it.”
He’d never be able to impress Sherlock with his omniscience again.
John swallowed, and licked the corner of his lip. “How do I know you’ve got anything of the kind? And how would you come to have a letter written to a lover?”
“Dear God, who is that, coming here at this hour?” Watson asked, rising to his feet.
Sherlock wondered when the man might be planning to spill the “happy” news to the room. Perhaps he was delaying, considerate of how crushing it would be for his patient’s husband to learn that there had been more than one life potentially lost with his wife's death. Many lives lost in fact, if Mary’s pregnancy became the catalyst for opening a case against John.
Greg nods and begins to move from the room.
John seemed to need the walk. He left him to his thoughts, both of them walking side by side in silence. He hadn’t decided where he was taking John, beyond away, through the fog scaling the tops of the trees. When they reached the fork in the path, he reached for John’s arm once more. Perhaps against good sense, he led them down the left hand trail rather than back to the house. Manderley didn’t feel safe for them, not at the moment. He would take them to the Happy Valley, the one place he felt actually lived up to its name.
Sherlock decided that if any other fragments came up to the surface, he would take them all out of John. He would remove all the leftover remnants of Mary, and the nightmare John had lived, till there was nothing of it left still inside of him.

The man he was today would never have associated with Wilkes, let alone have agreed to an arrangement of that nature. However, at the time he had lacked the character traits he now valued above all others, confidence and self-security, and was unaccustomed to friendship or respect from his peers.
“Who cares if he’s odd if he’s got eyes and a memory,” David said, earlier bluster still intact. “Not feeling so sure now, are you Watson?”
“Whether it might be possible that I’d made a mistake in Edgecoombe.”
“Coward! Get back here!”
“Oh, come now John,” Sherlock says, matching him by leaning forward into John’s space, “we’ve done weirder.” He’s smiling devilishly, quirking one eyebrow, and his eyes seem to say they are sharing a marvelous joke.
John ignored the bot, and instead swiftly turned off the
To add insult on top of injury, John leaned upwards to brush away his sweat soaked fringe before kissing his forehead. John then promptly lay down on his back, and pulled the covers back over both of them.
“You haven’t much in common with him, Wilkes,” Watson commented. “What do you do it for?”
Sherlock’s delivery would have been equally appropriate for admitting he had a fungal growth, which John might have found funny, if not for the fact that he could hardly believe it.
He realized this was rather like poking a wild animal. And what he thought was a confrontation was becoming a circular argument - John was a master of denial and deferring.
“You’re the improbable one,” John insisted. “As I just mentioned, up until a few weeks ago you were a book character. To me, at least.”
Sherlock’s head snapped up, shooting him an odd look. “No. Other wizards. They’ve fully turned now.”
“Whatever it is Captain, I’m sure we’d rather just hear it,” John said, resigned, and frustratingly still not looking back at him.
John felt ownership of it all now. It was his dirty talk that had gotten them this far, and when the man came, it would be because John had told him to—it would be because of
The man’s jaw clenched, again, at the implication in the question. Mrs Watson’s death had obviously dragged his good name through the mud. “The boat was better than, sir. At least it was when I last saw it, which was early spring last year.”
,” Sherlock demanded, arching their back, and apparently able to be imperious now that they’d had an orgasm. “Get on with it.”
“Of course not,” he said gently, hoping to have a conversation with a calm person.
John practically snarled, each word bitten off, and the temper beneath them evident.
As always, a million thanks to Soli for looking it over and offering suggestions <3 (Rewriting scenes from another perspective without repeating yourself is a challenge to say the least lol)
“I’ve done some digging into the Coroner,” Sherlock said, pleased to see he was no longer referred to as the “young French husband” in the recent editions. “He apparently has a penchant for being a stickler. You’ll have to be able to keep your temper restrained under a litany of irrelevant questions, aspersions cast on your character -”
He realized that he had stopped moving forward, and had perhaps been acting in a way that would be considered eccentric by others. Moriarty had paused when he had, and was watching him in silence. His eyes gleamed from his face in the darkly lit hallway.
Bob sincerelywrong has actually made a little Sherlock bat with a polka dot shower cap I just wanted y'all to know he has one of those so don't worry
The apologetic Captain and Colonel Barclay approached him, having for the most part held their tongues that morning. “I am sorry, to you and your husband,” the Captain said, repeating his sentiments from the day before with head bowed. “This is all a dreadful business.”
“Oh, right just calling for a friend, like I’ve never heard that before. Listen mate, it doesn’t matter to me. Just let me know who you’d like.”
It was like the goat was floating. Like Jesus walking on water.
“No, no,” Sherlock insisted. “You use it more than I would. It hardly matters.”
John lifted his head, and a look passed between them over the lip of the tub. They both knew what that meant. More than just cause for reopening the investigation into her death. A pregnant woman planning to meet her lover the next day, but committing suicide that night. More than enough to put John on trial. And, in Sherlock’s experience, when someone had actually committed the crime, there would only be more evidence to be unearthed.
“Okay, well, that’s not what I meant,” John clarified, “and like you just said, I’m already involved. You can’t just leave me out of it like you did earlier. I could have
John continued to eye him with worry. “We obviously need to talk,” John said simply.
“Has he,” she said, looking ahead. She was silent for a moment before asking suddenly, “How do you get on with Moriarty?”
“Brilliant,” the officer replied, with an easy and open admiration. “But what is to be done in the meantime? Is there somewhere I can take you, Mister...?”
He should have deleted it, cut out the memory like the tumour it was. If only he could - once something became an essential part of his organization, it was impossible to remove. And Manderley had already wormed its way into his memory palace against his better judgment. An annoyance, given that he could never speak of it.
All right, take it easy.
John supposed he should have also found being watched disconcerting, but again, he found that he liked the attention. He also suspected he had been watched by Sherlock before.
“As always, you see but you do not observe!” Sherlock shouted, and then barreled towards him, scalp forward, while his hands pulled his hair taut. “Look, John!”
“I am just a businessman, Mr Watson. If there is no business to be done, I will leave you to it. Enjoy - I think you’ll find David to be quite the convincing mourner, completely devoted to Mary. Rather unlike her actual husband. We’ll see what the magistrate makes of his note, and the knowledge that your husband punched his messenger.”
John began to struggle anew, though it wasn’t any more successful than his last attempt. He was completely trapped in the in-ship bot’s metallic embrace, while an additional robotic limb attempted to pull his suit off from his legs. When it realized his leg brace on the outside of his suit was hindering the removal, the bot snapped it off his thigh without a second thought. John slumped down in its hold as his leg crumpled beneath him, forcing the bot to grip him tighter.
The act had been uncomplicated, until Sherlock reached for him after, obviously expecting that he had to return the favour. It was John who withdrew then, his guilt coming back to him swiftly and soundly. Was everything they were to each other simply John helping a friend, and the friend in turn feeling indebted to him? Besides, it was safer to hold off, lest he embarrass himself. Since Mary, John's trust issues had caused him some difficulty in that area, and at the moment he wasn't even sure if he could perform with his current thoughts. John had wondered then if he would ever see Sherlock's face during the height of pleasure, or if the most he could ever expect was the cold, hard outline of Sherlock's back. John had said he didn’t know what to do with Sherlock, but the truth was he knew what he
“I think it’s exactly what I think,” John insisted, the door between them luckily bearing the brunt of his disapproval. “Why else would our living room smell like an ashtray?”
When the wheel at last turned back to black, John was alert. He listened to the door open, and the clacking of claws against the seventeen steps leading up to their floor.
The hero brought home the missing tea bag—the one that could be used over and over again, forever, and which always steeped perfectly—astonishing every test tube, emptied ice cream tub, and stained mug in the entire kitchen. But it was not their praise that the hero sought.
“You can imitate English,” John said in wonder. “That’s fantastic!”
Is it?
Rated E for the button hole touching, though possible epilogue pending?
It was annoyingly glib, and entirely over-confident. John was hooked.
John peeled the strewn arm back from Sherlock’s face, and kissed the mouth beneath it, a no-nonsense press of lips.
“This path leads to a valley that I thought you might like,” John said, with a brightness that didn’t reach his eyes.
David laughed, and it did nothing to help his cause.
John signed, licking the corner of his lip.
“I’m sorry,” John said simply. “It should be me apologizing, and making promises. But it’s too late. The game is over.”
Can the other man see him looking? No - why would he be looking in the reflection checking to see if anyone was staring at him? The man’s gaze is pointed in the general area of Sherlock’s back. Sherlock suddenly wishes he’d cleaned the embryo off his suit jacket a little more vigorously.
“Oh no, Mr Watson,” Magnussen said, standing from John’s armchair at last. “Quite the opposite. I want to buy something from you.”
“Mary committing suicide,” Magnussen repeated, as if mulling it over. “You were married to her, weren’t you Hamish? Is that act something you find to be in her character?”
John was smiling, which meant he was angry.
An alien, John supposed. Though, the alien looked rather like a human man, with a long face inches from his own, slanted blue-green eyes, and a shock of dark curls atop their head. The only discordant feature was their skin, its pigment still the same as the planet’s blue-purple terrain surrounding them. John also belatedly noticed that the creature had gills along their neck, suggesting they were able to breathe the planet’s atmosphere.
