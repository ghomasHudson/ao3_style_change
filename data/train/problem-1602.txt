‘Excellent, excellent.’ Gilchrist drained his drink. John followed his gaze to Lola, Sherlock’s young cousin, who was twirling a lock of her ginger hair around her finger.
‘I’ve missed you too, Mrs Hudson,’ he said, grinning widely and hugging her again. ‘The place has been falling down without you here - quite literally, as you’ve no doubt heard.’ He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and led her towards the door, bending to pick up one of the cases next to the step.
‘He’s got a terrier.’
‘A flat in Marylebone, on Baker Street. For what I pay it’s--’
‘Love the bow tie.’ Gilchrist winked at Mycroft, who shook his head and sipped his cocktail, staring out of the window. Sherlock stood awkwardly for a moment before Gilchrist gestured him over to the drinks cabinet, looking far more at home than Sherlock had ever felt in their house before. ‘Let me make you something frightfully decadent, Sherlock old boy, you’ll love it.’
‘Sherlock, you come with me,’ Mycroft said, putting his dinner jacket back on as he stood. ‘Mother, you wait here--’
‘Sound advice, dear,’ she said, petting his hands and then walking over to where some crates of alcohol were stacked, tipping forwards slightly.
‘No,’ Sherlock gasped, swallowing, closing his eyes. ‘No, no John, I can be good, I’ll... I can...’
‘Oh, I do like this one,’ Mrs Hudson said, brushing the crumbs off her hands into the bin.
‘Oh, be serious,’ John hissed, frustrated. ‘Another dead rent boy turns up, another note for you, my initials this time – JHW, 1936, London – not exactly a difficult code for Lestrade to crack. What then? You heard him today, you saw his face when he looked at that boy. Doesn’t take the sharpest tool in the box for him to clock that this—’ John motioned between himself and Sherlock and then at the wider room, ‘—this is more than a convenient living arrangement. That room we pretend is mine doesn’t even have a bloody bed, for a start—’
: hard and fast and
‘Yes, that’s it, good boy, good boy,’ John said, running his hand up the back of Sherlock’s neck and into his hair, applying exactly the right amount of pressure to Sherlock’s scalp with his fingertips and just a hint of his nails and oh,
‘It just seems very… personal.’
‘You’re not well.’ John stroked Sherlock’s bare arm and kissed his neck. ‘You’re not well.’
Sitting up, Sherlock held the few inches of water the flask now contained up to the sunlight, squinting at its clarity. ‘Mycroft informs me you’re training to be a doctor.’ Sherlock threw the water back into the fountain, his grip on the flask slipping. Eyes drawn to the sudden movement, John reached out to steady Sherlock’s hand. He caught Sherlock’s damp wrist between his fingers, the index and middle of which slipped automatically to take Sherlock’s pulse. ‘Although I’d thank you not to practise on me,’ Sherlock snapped, jerking his wrist out of John’s gentle grasp. His hold on the flask faltered once more and, fingers fumbling uselessly after it, Sherlock watched as it fell into the water with a quiet splash.
Sherlock blinked.
‘I didn’t average half a day a month with you before the war,’ Sherlock retorted, sucking in a deep breath, holding the smoke for longer than he usually did before blowing it towards the ceiling. John took hold of Sherlock’s lighter, the weight of it in his hand comforting and familiar. He pocketed it without thinking when the young woman from behind the counter rested the edge of a tray on their table, setting the teapot out with two cups and saucers, a sugar bowl, a jug of milk, and the plate of buns and sandwiches that Sherlock had ordered.
John turned his sweaty, yellowing face to Nettle. ‘Alright,’ he said. ‘Alright.’
The journey down to Sussex was easy enough. The car one of Mycroft’s drivers had parked for them on Baker Street last night ran very well - Mycroft had naturally managed to circumvent the petrol ration if it meant Sherlock’s attendance at lunch would be a sure thing. John and Sherlock had bathed, shaved and dressed quickly, laughing whenever they caught sight of each other. They’d managed to leave for ten and although the drive was long, the steady change in scenery, from London’s density and greyness, to the green countryside with blossom on the trees, was very pleasant indeed. John lit cigarettes for Sherlock every now and again, and whenever they reached a long stretch of road and Sherlock didn’t have to change gear, he rested his hand on John’s thigh.
‘Atonement?’ he murmured, stroking the wooden handle of his umbrella. ‘I don’t really know.’
‘Do it, Sherlock,’ John said, leaning in. ‘For old time’s sake.’
‘Are you and he...’
‘I wouldn’t get too near the fire if I were you, Mrs Hudson,’ he said warmly, letting her pat his back and fuss over him, her eyes unfocused.
‘Who or what on earth has given you cause to suspect
‘Whiskey sour, please, barkeep,’ Sherlock said with a smirk.
‘Ten past nine.’ John shifted closer to Sherlock, who rested his free hand on John’s leg and squeezed. He nodded and leant back against the bath, moving his shoulders up and down as he settled.
news that the public should have any interest in. News is the Soviets being up to something, or a nice murder,
‘Stop it, you horrible boy,’ John’s mother said, smiling as she tapped John’s arm. John laughed and pressed a kiss to her forehead. ‘Oh, you’re rotten. I’ll heat you some water for a bath, we can’t have you going to dinner looking as though you’ve been dragged through hedge backwards.’ She sat up and rested her hand on top of John’s head. ‘Go and find your suit and I’ll see if it needs ironing.’
Lestrade nodded. ‘Alright,’ he said. ‘Cheers.’
His skin burnt and tingled when John took his hand away after a minute. ‘Mmm, John,’ he moaned, crying out wordlessly, his body jerking desperately when John grabbed a handful of reddened skin and dug his nails in.
‘Yes?’
They were quiet once more. Sherlock looked out across the sea of people in the bar. ‘I still,’ he murmured, cutting himself off with a troubled frown. ‘I never stopped--’
They began to move together at a steady pace. Their gasping breaths and quiet moans punctuated the sounds of the party outside, down on the street.
‘Disembowelled a pig,’ he said as though it was the only obvious solution, frowning and gesturing in the air with his cigarette.
‘Well, fuck me,’ he murmured.
John sank down into the bath, dipping his head underneath the water and remaining submerged for nearly half a minute. He took a gasp as he resurfaced, his hands gripping the bath’s sides. He couldn’t get Sherlock out of his mind. Sighing, he took his crumpled box of cigarettes off the small wooden stool next to the bath and lit one with the lighter he’d bought himself last year in Oxford.
‘That I love London so...’
‘Here, let me.’ John bundled his jacket up and rested it underneath Sherlock’s head before reaching down to undo the buttons of his coat and jacket. John ran his hand lightly down Sherlock’s chest and torso, applying the barest amount of pressure to each rib and making a mental note whenever Sherlock winced or made a pained sound.
‘I insist.’ Mycroft smiled his smile that wasn’t really a smile at all, just the slightest hint of gritted teeth behind stretched lips.
John huffed a laugh, rubbing at his bad leg. ‘It wasn’t as bad as all that.’
Mycroft looked down at the polished cherrywood and breathed out the smoke, dense grey clouds falling in faltering coughs from his lips.
‘Drinks at half past six, dinner at half past seven--’
‘He had no right to ask you the questions he did but I doubt it was malicious.’ Sherlock reached into his pocket and slammed some coins down next to the ones Moriarty had left.
‘People do little else.’ Sherlock jumped up from the sofa and headed into their bedroom to dress. ‘You can stay here and wait for your next shift if you like, or you can come with me and do something useful,’ he called through to John. ‘I don’t care either way,’ he lied.
John was waiting just inside. ‘I’ll let you do the honours, Mrs Hudson,’ he said, smiling as he handed his and Sherlock’s spare set of keys over to her.
John held it reverently in his hands. ‘You can make more like it?’
Harry glared and slammed her teacup down. ‘Settee for you then, is it?’ she said pointedly.
John stopped talking, breathing out angrily through his nose. He pressed his lips together, stalking over to the hat stand and pulling on his coat, bending down to tie his shoelaces. ‘I’m going out,’ he snapped, almost a shout. ‘There’s a sandwich under the tea towel on the kitchen table; eat it.’ He slammed out of the flat, leaving Sherlock alone with his thoughts as John’s footsteps down the stairs and then on the pavement outside faded from earshot.
The young reporter across the table in the hotel restaurant frowned.
The wailing of a child forced John’s eyes open as the moan of the Stuka grew closer. A woman stood a few feet from him in the middle of the road, turning this way and that, unable to choose between the farmyard and the field. Her child cried from within its shawl, pressed tightly against its mother’s breast.
The morning sun beat down on the Holmes residence and its impressive gardens. John Watson, twenty-three, seated himself on the fountain’s edge, a few feet away from Sherlock, one tanned hand spread across the sun-warmed stone. ‘First chance I’ve had to talk to you in nearly a year.’ John brought his right arm across his body and dipped his hand into the water, his eyes flicking between where his wrist disappeared underneath the water’s surface and Sherlock’s face, where perspiration beaded at his temple. ‘And that’s even with the both of us being at Oxford together during the term--’
‘Can’t imagine why,’ Sherlock muttered, still bent over his microscope and in a filthy mood.
‘No. Have there been any raids in the area recently?’ Sherlock swooped to crouch down next the the board game, peering intently at the counters. He lifted up one half of the board itself and raised his eyebrows.
‘Remember your promise.’ Sherlock shut himself away. John pressed his hand against the door.
John sighed again and snapped on a pair of rubber gloves he’d stolen from the hospital. ‘Am I alright to touch him, Lestrade?’ John called to where Lestrade stood, just outside, smoking a cigarette.
‘Three came in yesterday, Luftwaffe blew them to buggery. I lost three thousand men in one day.’
‘Thank you,’ he mumbled when John got them both under the sheets, shuffling closer to John on his stomach, resting his head in John’s lap. John moved his hands into Sherlock’s hair and stroked the tousled, slightly sweaty curls gently.
‘I should have known you’d find a way of getting here,’ John said, shouldering the bedroom door open, hands grabbing at Sherlock’s waist, plucking at his woolen pullover.
‘What are you doing?’
They were quiet; breathing in the scent of each other and of London, of celebration bonfires still burning and of smog and pollution. Sherlock turned his face towards where the light was strongest, in the east. ‘I love you,’ he whispered into John’s neck.
Sherlock sat with his face pressed against the cool glass of the bay window and smoked, waiting.
‘I’ll give you ten bob to fuck off,’ Moriarty snarled immediately, his dark eyes staring the man out.
‘No you couldn’t. You’d get bored.’ Sherlock licked his index finger and turned the page of the dusty book he was reading.
Sherlock kissed the inside of John’s wrist before John picked up their tea things and started to walk towards the kitchen. ‘If you insist, Doctor Watson,’ he said.
As soon as the train stopped, Sherlock sprang forwards and pulled the door open, grinning up at John. John smiled back and stepped down onto the platform, putting his hat on and dusting his smart brown suit down.
, I...’
‘Uh, yes, that’s me...’ John frowned, looking from Sherlock, whose face was equally confused, to Mycroft, standing by the telephone table, to the uniformed policemen and then the Inspector.
‘Him?’ Sherlock turned away from the window. ‘Easy.’
‘Perfectly acceptable when they’re as maddening as you,’ John replied, kissing the curve of Sherlock’s grin before wiping Sherlock’s blood off his mouth with the damp cloth. He went over to the sink and rinsed another cloth through, wringing it out and folding it into a neat square, placing it over Sherlock’s black eye. ‘Hold that there,’ he said, lifting Sherlock’s hand to press against the cloth.
The skin of John’s hands is cracked across his knuckles. Mud and dirt and blood is sunken in to every cut, every wound. His dull eyes glance up the weaving line of the trench in the grey, pre-dawn light, his breath dancing on the air each time he exhales. The time just before stand-to is always the quietest.
‘This wasn’t my fault,’ Sherlock said.
‘Want it, don’t you?’ John murmured, his voice thick as he sucked determinedly at Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock nodded and rested his hand on the small of John’s back. ‘I’ll go and warm the bed up.’
‘Mr. Holmes, a pleasure as always,’ John replied, his eyes wrinkling at the corners.
, pulling away from John’s lips and tongue and that wicked, filthy mouth, arching his spine. All that achieved, however, was pushing John’s fingers further inside him, and then there was a third finger pressing into him and Sherlock
He arched and writhed as John brought his palm into contact with Sherlock’s arse again, he lost count after seven and it was
John sighed. ‘Come on. Let’s just... let’s just go before the blackout starts, there’s no sense in arguing like this.’
‘I didn’t know where else to go, I’m sorry I didn’t call ahead, but it was all a bit last minute, see, and...’
,’ Sherlock moaned, pulling a face and collapsing onto the sofa. ‘Murdered prostitutes are ten a penny; she probably got too familiar and got herself killed as a result,’ he scoffed, waving his hand in dismissal.
‘They are simply doing their job--’
The only sound that could be heard in the silence that followed John’s question was the dripping of the tap in the kitchen.
‘You’ve been avoiding me.’
‘John!’ Sherlock exclaimed, his voice a deep cry. He gasped and panted, still pushing back insistently onto John as he rode out his own climax, his left hand gripping tight onto the headboard. ‘Oh,’ he moaned, sliding his knees back and pushing them outwards until he rested on his stomach on top of the tangled mess of sheets.
‘I thought you looked rather handsome.’
,’ and he came undone, his orgasm ripping him apart at the core as he arched into John, clinging onto his shoulders and hair and
‘Thinks it’s pointless. He doesn’t like the old dears who run his section.’
‘Oh, honestly? They’re talking about my violin?’
‘Cheers,’ he murmured, handing the lighter smoothly back to Sherlock, who immediately lit another cigarette of his own.
More cheerful than he’d been in days, since Sherlock’s last letter, John managed the stairs with relative ease, the card from Sherlock and a couple of other letters clutched tightly in his hand. He went back into the flat and switched the wireless on, humming under his breath as he went to fill the kettle. He grinned at the photograph of Sherlock in his Home Guard uniform, looking incredibly surly, that he’d rested against one of the canisters. He’d have to see about getting that one framed.
John paused before answering. ‘I ought to get back,’ he said, struggling to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
!’ Sherlock moaned around two cigarettes, lighting both. ‘I need him for
‘He’s useful
‘Horrible shit,’ John muttered at the commander’s retreating back.
‘Nettle would you for once in your bloody miserable life shut up?’ John shouted, inhaling again, almost frantic.
‘Doctor Watson!’ Mrs Hudson called, looking giddy as she waved from her chair at the long table. ‘Come and join us!’
Obediently, Sherlock parted his lips, allowing John to place two pills on his tongue and bring the glass of water to his mouth, seeing as his hands were soaking in the bowl of cold saltwater. Sherlock swallowed them and licked his lips when John took the glass away, tasting fresh blood on his tongue.
‘John.’
‘I always hated it when you left. I was so lonely and-’
'Mr. Holmes!' The girl who was manning the hatch controlling entry into the hut raised her eyebrows in surprise. 'We're not expecting you until tomorrow morning, I thought you were meant to be in London?'
The heat of the day had eased off somewhat as late afternoon was slowly replaced by the approaching evening. It was no longer uncomfortable to move around and even putting his dinner jacket on wasn’t much of a hardship for John. He looked in the mirror, cracked in one corner from an accident two years ago, and smiled at his reflection after re-arranging his hair with his fingers. He looked presentable enough.
‘Oh, you always need a cigarette.’ John kissed Sherlock once more before sitting up and swinging his legs out of bed. He was in the middle of stretching his back out, one hand resting over the scar on his shoulder when Sherlock’s long arms wrapped around his waist and he was tugged back down, Sherlock straddling him.
‘Are you alright?’
‘None.’
‘Sherlock, do come and meet Giles.’ Mycroft smiled his usual un-smile at Sherlock, who trudged into the drawing room. ‘Good God, boy, what’s that around your neck?’
‘I shouldn’t have laughed. I’ve heard about... about your new friend. He sounds really rather nice.’
‘As long as it looks like we’re joking--’
Smoke billowed up to the ceiling from John’s mouth.
‘verse: John, Sherlock, Mycroft and Lestrade are archangels.
‘Victor,’ Sherlock replied, paling somewhat. He didn’t smile back but walked over and offered his hand.
Mrs Hudson pursed her lips. ‘I’ve never known anyone to fuss about things like she does, Doctor Watson. Shot my nerves to pieces, she did, carrying on about bombs and death and how frightened she was.’ She drew some smoke in quickly. ‘She’s not been the same since her George was killed during the last war and I shouldn’t be unkind, but...’
‘You remember.’ Sherlock rolled on top of John.
‘I’m going with John--’
‘No. No, I don’t think it would. And I don’t say that--’
Sherlock worked until the shift ended at eight and handed his machine to the young woman taking over from him, tucking his notebooks and pen in his blazer pocket. He left the hut, pulling his coat and hat on for the short walk back to the house.
‘Watson. Yes.’
‘You’re not a bit like your father,’ she murmured. ‘Not one bit.’
Sherlock scoffed, the sound derisive. ‘Why? Neither you nor I are a cheap fairy rent boy who solicits for business in Hyde Park.’
‘Fucking sexy,’ John snarled, moving his hand as quickly as he could in the tight space. ‘Want you to come from this, Sherlock, just from this, want to hear you, want to feel you, see you, fuck, Sherlock,
‘What a way to go,’ Sherlock muttered, bending down to snatch the envelope addressed to him from where Frederick’s cold, stiff fingers gripped it. He held it up to the light and squinted as he appraised the ivory paper the letter was contained behind. ‘See if I’ve missed anything, won’t you, John?’ he said with a motion to the body.
John sighed and nodded. ‘Alright.’ He kissed Sherlock again. ‘I’ll see you next week, though?’
‘Kindly don’t remind me,’ Sherlock muttered, sipping his lukewarm tea. John smiled at the sour expression on Sherlock’s face and kissed his cheek.
‘I forgot how nicely diplomatic you are about these sorts of things,’ Mrs Hudson said, raising her eyebrows and exhaling steadily.
‘Perhaps I’d like to take my time with you, now I can,’ John replied, smirking even as he began to move with Sherlock, wrapping his hand around Sherlock’s length.
Laughing, John kissed the skin behind Sherlock’s ear. ‘Your mother’s going to have us for breakfast. We’re running disastrously late.’
‘Turning into a strapping lad, aren’t you, Colin?’ he said. Colin looked at the floor and mumbled something, folding his coat over one arm.
‘Time was you were inseparable.’ She squeezed John’s hand. ‘Still. You’re both very different, aren’t you?’
‘I’ll help you up, come on,’ John said gently, easing Sherlock into an upright position, grabbing his jacket that was now covered in dust. ‘Let’s get you standing.’
‘No, you get bored when you’ve nothing to do,’ John corrected with a raised eyebrow. ‘Something will turn up soon enough.’
They had been half-clothed in front of each other before, of course, back when they were boys. Somehow, though, somehow this felt different; the challenge in Sherlock’s eyes was unlike anything John had ever seen before, the pounding of John’s heart was new and other and different, the rush of heat he felt at the sight of Sherlock was strange and frightening. Flustered, John sighed and shifted his weight, folding his arms as he stared off to one side rather than watch as Sherlock slid into and underneath the water in the deep fountain, his dark hair fanning out on the surface like a lilypad before he disappeared entirely.
‘In a moment I will,’ John replied, smiling and lifting his glass to her. He wore his usual trousers and braces, his shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows and tie knotted loosely at his throat.
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
, Mycroft--’
‘When I was about halfway here.’
‘Sherlock?’ He moved towards the familiar noise, taking his jacket off and beating the smoke back with it, squinting down at the ground.
The door of the nursery slammed open and Sherlock heard two pairs of feet hammering against the floorboards as the twins, undoubtedly, ran past his room. Clenching his jaw and throwing the direction of their fading footsteps a filthy look through the bathroom door, Sherlock finished his shave with one final swipe to his cheek. He rinsed and dried his face before attempting to comb his hair into something resembling a tidy style, the beads of water running down the back of his neck before they caught in the towel that Sherlock had draped across his shoulders.
John laughed and nodded. ‘I did, yes. I seem to remember Mycroft saying quite seriously that he was going to rule the world. I know I was going to save lives and sometimes shoot wrongdoers and you... oh, what was it you wanted to be?’
‘Ten bob then,’ the man said, narrowing his eyes. Moriarty reached into his back pocket and drew out a ten shilling note, slipping it into the man’s hand.
‘It’s done, now. Over.’
‘“Private detective, Sherlock Holmes--”’
1939-40. Sherlock and Mycroft meet in London. For John, France is hell.
‘Sorry Sir, only just arrived, can you tell us what we’re supposed to be doing?’
Sherlock ignored him and dropped heavily into the empty space next to his mother on the sofa, crossing his legs and pulling a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket, lighting one. ‘John?’ he said, shaking the packet.
The twins bounded in and jumped up next to Sherlock, ignoring Gilchrist entirely.
to make this right, I...’
‘We’re meeting at the pub, Lestrade said?’ Sherlock asked, already striding towards the exit of the station. John hurried to catch up.
‘Cook says ‘er cheesy leeks are ruined because of ‘im, though, Alice, and they’re my favourite!’ Mary argued, glaring at Sherlock from where she stood in a pretty dress on the back step, her hair combed and face thoroughly scrubbed.
‘We’ve no music,’ John said, laughing and shutting the door behind them, turning the lock.
‘What do you want?’ he asked quietly, grinning despite knowing that by all rights he should be annoyed about being woken before getting up for an early.
‘One day I’ll have you in a bed,’ Sherlock moaned. ‘One day I’ll have you there and... and...’
‘Of course it’s me,’ Sherlock replied from halfway up the stairs, his curls appearing, then his long, proud face as he ascended. His curls were rather less wild than they had once been, Sherlock now opting for a short-back-and-sides haircut rather than the unruly crown which had once adorned his head.
‘Hmm,’ Sherlock said. He began to walk again, John following. ‘I really ought to have come back home. We’re wandering round a provincial backwater with nothing to do when I could have had you on your back with your legs in the air--’
‘Oh, I hate you, I
‘I... I’m only telephoning because...’
John poured the tea into of their mugs, chipped from an incident involving a pair of pliers and a cheeseboard. He added a lump of sugar and a small scoop of powdered milk, stirring frantically to make the clumps dissolve.
'Bloody hell, Sherlock--' John arched his back, fingers clutching at Sherlock's sleep-ruffled curls. 'Oh, stop it, that's not fair --
Victor looked around. ‘You can’t still be angry,’ he murmured, stepping closer to Sherlock, touching his arm. ‘Surely you understand.’
Sherlock’s face twisted into an ugly expression, the skin at the bridge of his nose furrowing, his slightly crooked teeth bared. ‘You idiot! That was a present from my friend!’
‘It’s quite alright.’ Mycroft rested his hand on the telephone. ‘You may go now.’ He dialled Sherlock’s number.
‘Uh.’ John reached into his pocket and handed Sherlock’s lighter to Moriarty, who flipped it round in his left hand, raising an eyebrow at the ornate
Sherlock curled his hand around John’s trembling one, pulling it down to press his lips to it.
‘You really ought,‘ Sherlock agreed, watching John’s left hand with narrowed eyes. John poured some more tea from the pot into his mug. The pot didn’t shake. The tea didn’t spill. Sherlock drank from his cup and flicked the newspaper open, scanning the lines of text without really reading the words on the page.
“Jesus Christ Sherlock!” John’s yell of Sherlock’s name filled the flat and shot straight to Sherlock’s own hard cock. John clutched Sherlock’s head to his chest as Sherlock pumped his hand up and down over John’s cock, John’s breath escaping him in gasps and whimpers.
“Thank you.” John flicked his eyes over Sherlock’s form, knowing that it wasn’t real, that he wasn’t really here in the room with John, and despite the fact that it obviously wasn’t healthy and it was a plain indicator of the fact that John was still having issues coping, John didn’t care how far it might set him back. He had Sherlock back.
Suspicion confirmed that Sherlock was enjoying this, John focused all his attention back on the cock currently in his mouth. He bobbed his head up and down over the thick length, his tongue swirling around Sherlock’s cock, cataloging every single ridge and vein and the feel of Sherlock’s cock heavy against his tongue. He experimented with kitten licks over the tip, took Sherlock all the way down to the hilt, and bobbed his head up and down on Sherlock. Each of these different things elicited a different series of sounds, reactions and movements. John loved each of them.
The walk to the bedroom was short, but it was passionate nonetheless. Hands scrabbling at clothing and fingers in hair, lips on lips. Once they reached the bedroom, John didn’t hesitate to shove Sherlock down onto his back on the bed. John followed him down, his fingers making quick work of the buckle of Sherlock’s belt and the button and zipper of his slacks.
“Sherlock…” John’s voice was soft was he stared at the pale brunette figure, sitting in his leather chair, one leg propped on his other knee, wearing his usual suit jacket, dark purple button down shirt (John’s personal favorite) and slacks.
“John what’s wrong?” Sherlock knew immediately that John was upset.
“Hello John.” John was on the tube, standing, one hand wrapped around one of the support bars by the door, his phone in his hand when he heard Sherlock’s deep baritone next to him. John’s attention snapped up to see Sherlock standing in front of him.
“I thought I was hallucinating. I thought you weren’t real. Jesus Christ Sherlock! Do you have any idea what the past month has been like for me!?” John slammed his hands down on the arms of his chair before surging to his feet again, anger coursing through him like electricity and giving him a burst of energy.
“No Sherlock. None of this is okay. None of this is okay! I’m going insane and I’m not doing anything to stop it! What part of that is okay!?” John screamed at Sherlock.
“John if you don’t fuck me right now I’m not going to speak to you for a week and you can forget about doing this again.” Sherlock growled, his tone serious. John raised his eyebrows and smirked at Sherlock.
Neither of them were sure who moved first but then they were touching, kissing. John’s lips against Sherlock’s, his hands coming up to tangle into those dark curls while Sherlock yanked John onto his lap so that they were chest to chest, John’s knees wedged between the sides of the chair and Sherlock’s thighs. Satisfied with the position that John was in, Sherlock moved his hands from their position on John’s hips to the front of his pants. His nimble fingers had John’s belt and jean buttons undone in less than ten seconds and then his hand was on John’s incredibly hard cock through the fabric of his pants.
“No!” Sherlock’s yell was insistent.
“Mine or yours?” He asked.
Later on, in the midst of their post coital bliss, both of them showered and changed, John just wearing his pants, Sherlock in pajama pants and a thin tee shirt. Both of them tucked together under the soft duvet, John’s head on Sherlock’s chest. John was enjoying Sherlock’s fingers carding through his hair a more pressing thought occurred to him. He pressed his palms to his eyes. He groaned as he dragged his hands down over his face. Sherlock looked down at him, concerned.
“Because, Christ Sherlock, because people will think I’m crazy.” John whispered.
“Yes, sure, fine. Good bye.” John stepped off the train and on to the platform. He didn’t make his way to the exit right away though. He waited until the train doors had slid closed again and watched Sherlock, who in turn was watching him, through the glass windows of the doors of the train until it slid off into darkness and John couldn’t see him any longer
“My apologies. I shall make that very clear next time.” Sherlock very much wanted to placate John. He didn’t like it when John was mad at him. Even if he thought whatever John was mad about was trivial, he usually tried to fix it as soon as possible. This was the same way. He didn’t want John to be mad at him anymore.
“Jesus Christ you’re gorgeous.” John murmured as he came eye to eye with Sherlock’s erection. Doing what he’d often thought about during his frequent late night wanks, John licked a stripe from the base to the crown of Sherlock’s erection. Sherlock let out a shuddering breath and fisted his hands in the duvet.
Sherlock wondered if this was what he sounded like as an army captain.

‘Disperse! Take cover!’
‘The very thought of you...’ Sherlock sang softly, swirling the ice left in his glass around with a fingertip. He sucked in a lungful of smoke from his cigarette, leaving it resting between his lips.
Sherlock chuckled. ‘My directions were satisfactory, then?’
‘Good,’ Sherlock whispered, swallowing. ‘Intense.’
‘Oh,’ Moriarty said, sitting back in his chair, blowing a lungful of smoke to one side. ‘A recent development?’
Victor nodded. ‘I don’t... I don’t want to... I’m not trying to... I’m very happily... I’d just like to tell him I’m sorry.’
‘You’re exactly what he needs,’ Victor said, very quietly, the look in his eyes sincere. ‘Take care of yourself, too. Don’t let that leg grind you down.’
‘No doubt being rotund and villainous somewhere,’ Sherlock muttered, following his mother and John out into the bright midday sunshine.
‘Ah--yes. Tunisia. Actually got shot in the shoulder, the leg’s nothing to do with...’ John trailed off, embarrassed.
The Inspector nodded and a policeman behind John gripped his wrists roughly, snapping a metal handcuff onto his right wrist.
‘Out with it, then.’
‘Lola’s an idiot.’
‘I don’t really feel you’re in a position to talk about fair and unfair, Sherlock,’ John snapped, sitting up, dislodging Sherlock from his chest and fumbling for a cigarette from the crumpled box on the bedside table. He swung his legs out so his feet were resting flat on the floor; lit his fag with shaking fingers.
‘No cuts, that’s good,’ John said, quickly applying some of the yellow cream to Sherlock’s knuckles before screwing the cap back on the tube and replacing everything neatly in his bag. ‘I’d run you a cool bath to soak in but the plumbing would be far too loud at this hour.’ He lifted Sherlock shirt again and spread his hand across a large violet bruise just underneath Sherlock’s ribcage, rubbing gently with his thumb. ‘Come to bed?’
‘John Watson?’ The Inspector who’d been interviewing everyone asked gruffly, meeting both John and Sherlock in the entrance hall.
‘And what am I supposed to do?’ Lestrade said, incredulous.
‘Jim,’ he said with a giggle, moving his arse to stimulate Moriarty’s cock, tucked between Freddie’s bare thighs.
Sherlock threw his book to the floor where it landed with a soft whump on the rug. He rolled over to face John and pulled him close, hands gripping his waist. ‘I prefer eccentric.’
The tap continued to drip. Sherlock held onto the soap and John’s hand and it was quiet for a very long time.
Sherlock chuckled, getting up and changing the record when
‘It’s my ribs,’ he said once they’d both calmed down. ‘I think I’ve broken some of them.’
‘They wouldn’t listen. No-one would listen, they called me hysterical, I... I’m so sorry. I love you. Believe me.’
‘Madness. Come along.’ Sherlock urged John to move and soon they were flying around the dancefloor in a quickstep, stumbling occasionally. They lasted about a minute before John began to laugh loudly when he saw the manic smile Sherlock had plastered onto his face in imitation of professional dancers, losing his rhythm and having to stop to hold his stomach as he laughed.
‘Charmed,’ Sherlock muttered, sounding anything but, engaging in a perfunctory handshake.
‘Yes,’ he said, not looking at Sherlock, instead pretending to be interested in reading the headings in the newspaper upside-down. ‘We are going to ignore it, if you don’t mind.’
‘I met him when I was getting cleared for this place. He doesn’t look like you.’
, what have you done to yourself?’ John stumbled backwards, eyes widening at the sight of Sherlock lying in a bath of water that was tinged pale pink, face covered in blood, smoking a cigarette.
‘Why?’ Mouth a hard line of annoyance and disapproval, Sherlock continued to rifle through the paper. ‘That is plainly
,’ he hissed, tugging against the cuffs and shoving his hips down into the mattress underneath him. John hit him again; five times in quick succession, one after the other after the other after the other after the other.
‘You know him well enough to be on first-name terms with him,’ John hissed, ‘despite the fact he’s clearly poison--’
‘Stabbed, Lestrade said.’
‘And I love you,’ John replied, lacing the fingers of his right hand with Sherlock’s, pinning it to the mattress as he thrust harder into Sherlock’s fist, seeking completion. Sherlock’s grip tightened as John’s pace increased, both of them panting for breath through open mouths.
‘Find us a seat,’ Sherlock murmured, nodding in the direction of the empty chairs and tables towards the back of the tea room, away from the windows.
‘Remember, wooden handle, single bit, straighter edge than usual,’ Sherlock said as they reached the main stretch of shops again. ‘Couldn’t be anything else from the bloodstain on that beam back there and the damage on the underside of the board game.’ He grinned, eyes alight with the thrill of the game being on again. ‘Hopefully one will still be in stock, the axe was definitely new, but I heard on the train here that some people were going to Woolworth’s to queue for saucepans - can you imagine?’ Sherlock muttered as they walked.
‘How was your journey?’ John asked as they stepped onto Whitechapel road, shifting to one side to avoid the throng of people.
Around them, crockery and cutlery clanged and the sound of people talking coalesced into one low hum. The piano in the corner cut through the background noise, playing a pleasant enough melody.
‘I don’t like the sound of this, Sherlock.’ John held tightly to the back of his chair, his mouth set in a grim, straight line.
John lay down his hand of cards and smiled, eyes unfocused, at the men he was playing poker with, gesturing for them to lean in. ‘Mr. Holmes here has bet me one shilling he can dance the woman’s part in a quickstep. Shall we see him put his money where his mouth is?’
‘Letter for you,’ he mumbled, handing it to John before shuffling into the kitchen, one of his large hands shielding his ribs.
Sherlock rubbed his thumb back and forth on the rim of his saucer. ‘You heard him, I don’t--’
‘I love you,’ Sherlock mouthed through the glass, not caring who saw, not now. ‘I’ll fix this.’
‘Sure you’re not a dilly boy, chicken?’
‘Not a good day, I observe.’
John remained still for a moment, staring at the calm-again surface of the fountain’s water as the sun beat down upon it. ‘Sherlock,’ he called, jogging to catch up. ‘Sherlock, I’m sorry.’
Moriarty cackled, pressing his hand against his mouth as he laughed. ‘Oh, that’s funny. You’re such a card, Sherlock.’ He giggled again, managing to calm himself as they stepped onto the main path up to the big house. ‘Did you see your... friend? Doctor Ibbotson, was it?’
‘Pleasure,’ Gilchrist said, his smile overly toothy, standing to shake John’s hand. ‘Medical man, I hear?’
‘John.’
‘It’s Sherlock,’ Sherlock said, raising his face to the ceiling and taking a deep breath. ‘I... I suppose you’d better come up.’
‘So I am,‘ John said, drinking some more of his tea. ‘Ought to have a bath, really.’
‘I love you,’ John said, stroking Sherlock’s hips with his thumbs. ‘Do you want to turn onto your front? I can’t promise I’ll--’
Bumblebees hovered around the wildflowers that grew at the edges of the path, their shadows growing long as the sun began to set.
Sherlock looked around guiltily at the logs ready to burn in the grate, his high-end cigarettes on the bedside table, the fine tweed coat hanging on the back of the door. ‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘I would have done anything...
‘I’ve probably played against him at one time or another.’
‘Oh, shut up,’ Sherlock said, throwing John a look as a smirk spread over his face.
Sherlock rested one of his spindly hands on John’s back, only to have it shaken off.
‘Experiment.’ Sherlock stared at John as though that was incredibly obvious. ‘Lestrade will obviously let me have a look at the body and I can inspect the pattern on the skull in relation to the weapon that carried out the scalping, which is most likely at the bottom of the Thames by now.’ He grinned again. ‘Hence our need to find one. I’ll meet you back here in an hour, you go that way and I’ll go this.’
That had been about half an hour ago. Now, John was sitting on the edge of his bed, Sherlock on his lap, his tongue in Sherlock’s mouth.
She shook her head and leant over to clip his ear. ‘I know,’ she said, pulling the kitchen doors half-closed as she went to make the tea.
, the sound long and broken, most of his usual mental capabilities long gone. ‘John!’ he cried, his cock twitching against his stomach as John thrust his fingers in and out, twisting and curling against his prostate again and again and
I was the whole time, even though I pretended I wasn't.'
, Sherlock thought.
‘Four or five fractured or broken and you’ll have some bruising on the others.’ John looked around for the first time since finding Sherlock, now that the smoke had begun to clear. Several people lay unconscious, some trapped by rubble. One elderly man bled from his head out onto the bricks and glass and wood he lay on top of.
John got to his feet and braced his weight, offering his hands to Sherlock, who used them to help himself stand (albeit after a lot of groaning and swearing).
‘I came back to you. I always did. I always will.’ John stepped forwards again and again Sherlock slipped backwards, along the rows of books to a darker corner of the library.
‘Kiss me,’ Sherlock begged, grasping John’s chin with sweaty fingers, pulling his face upwards. John closed his eyes and met Sherlock’s mouth, tongues pushing together, teeth clicking and catching on the tender skin of John’s inside lip. Sherlock sucked the blood away and began to move against John in earnest, establishing a rhythm that quickly grew in pace.
‘I’ll talk to her later,’ Sherlock said, ignoring Lestrade’s instruction. ‘John, come here.’
The knocking came again, louder and more insistent.
‘I had to see you.’
‘Sherlock!’ Mrs Hudson exclaimed. ‘What on earth do you think you’re doing, young man, throwing yourself off the back of a bus like that? You’ll do yourself an injury, you will, and I won’t be the one putting you back together--’ she stopped talking abruptly as Sherlock swept her into a tight hug, kissing her soundly on the cheek.
‘Manageable,’ leaning on John, who was standing straight and strong, for support. ‘Tired?’
‘I did?’
The two of them had walked slowly towards the town from the station, enjoying the pleasant, if not terribly warm weather. The mile that Sherlock usually managed in twenty minutes took somewhere near an hour with John’s leg, but Sherlock wasn’t about to complain.
‘No, it’s no good, Sherlock, I’ve got to see who that is.’ John managed to extract himself from Sherlock’s hands and walked over to their front door, wincing as he adjusted himself in his trousers. ‘I’ll be back up in a moment, you just--’
France was hell. France was hell and that was no exaggeration on John’s part. Horses lay abandoned in ditches, limbs splayed outwards, flies clustered around their empty eye sockets, sucking at what little flesh was left on the bone. The countryside for miles around was mud churned like butter: muck and filth and destruction. A smallholding crumbled at its foundations, the crops turned over, roots lying straggled above the ground. John felt ill.
‘Mary Macneil, just because you’re upset that you’re parents aren’t here... oh, just get inside! I’m very sorry, Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson,’ Alice called, looking anguished before she disappeared inside.
jumped up from the chaise and wrapped himself up in his blue silk robe.
‘He knows
‘No,’ Sherlock murmured, shaking his head. ‘Tell me you didn’t--’
‘He is, yes,’ Sherlock answered, stepping out of the bedroom, busy tying the sash on his plaid dressing gown. ‘And keen to know why you’ve come all the way down from bonny Scotland to bother... oh.’
‘I hardly even know him--’
Exhaling, Mycroft shifted his weight from one leg to the other and tightened his grip on his umbrella. ‘I thought it would be prudent to inform you that I have reached a position of sufficient influence that John’s criminal record could be made to disappear.’
Sherlock sighed and stared out of the high window, at the cornflower blue September sky.
‘To... to come,’ Sherlock breathed. ‘I want to come. Please, John.’
‘I really ought to go.’ Sherlock jumped to his feet, grabbing the flask again and running up the remainder of the steps, through the doors into the big house. John sighed and ran after him.
‘Oh, I’ve done well, then,’ John said, grinning against Sherlock’s skin.
‘Goodbye,’ he murmured, stepping out onto Baker Street.
John cradled Sherlock’s head against his chest and kissed his forehead. ‘I’m here now,’ he said. ‘Now and always.’
Sherlock beamed and pulled his mother into a tight hug. ‘I’ve missed you too, Mummy,’ he murmured, smiling at John over the top of her head.
‘Sherlock--’
Everything that happened next happened so quickly that John was powerless to react.
John took Victor’s hand with a gentle squeeze and shook it. ‘Don’t go to him,’ he said quickly, surprising himself. ‘Write, if you need, but don’t ask Mycroft and...’ he sighed. ‘Just... please.’
John’s head fell back onto Sherlock’s shoulder as his eyes dropped closed and his tongue flicked out to lick his lips. ‘Quite the wordsmith this evening, Mr. Holmes,’ he said, turning to press open-mouthed kisses to Sherlock’s neck.
He twisted the handle.
‘Come with me,’ the merman says, his voice deep. His hand rests on John’s thigh. ‘Leave them.’
‘You’ve not changed.’
we haven’t a choice.’ He pressed his fingertips to his temples.
John added sugar and milk to his tea. He stirred it, the spoon scraping against the china. He looked at Sherlock and shifted closer in his chair, just barely.
‘John! Oh, we’ll be late--’
‘Oh, I can tell you now that he certainly does,’ Sherlock said, eyes widening. ‘And that out of the two of us, he’s far less forgiving than I am.’
A bird sat on the stool John had built. Its feathers were threadbare, its eyes pale, and John watched as a feather was woven into the garment on the loom.
‘Hello,’ she whispered, her Scottish accent noticeable even from the short word. John kissed her forehead and pinched Colin’s cheek after putting her down, ruffling his hair.
‘No. Just... behave yourself.’
Sherlock gave Mycroft the slip after ten minutes of scouring the lawns with him - a feat that Lola managed, too. He headed down towards the boathouse, skin prickling from the heat that pressed in still. ‘Boys?’ Sherlock shouted. He shone his torch down the damp steps and ducked his head to look. ‘Boys?’ Nothing but the dripping of water. He turned and ran back up towards the house.
John nodded. ‘Yes. Yes, he did.’
it was him?’ The Inspector said, ‘Or you saw him?’
, made thinking rather than simply
‘We’re both very busy, mother. He has his chemistry and I’ve medicine to concentrate on--’
‘Ten past nine, is it?’ Sherlock said quietly, eyes flicking to a crack in the boards at the windows.
‘It appears Mary’s after your blood again, then, Sherlock Holmes,’ he said. ‘You’ve ruined the cheesy leeks because you insisted on “a good seeing to”, which, if I recall, was administered in exchange for a promise of good behaviour.’
‘Extraordinarily hideous, perhaps.’ John gasped, open-mouthed, as he pressed himself fully inside Sherlock, kneeling straight up, digging his hands under Sherlock’s sweaty lower back and holding tightly.
‘Should auld acquaintance be forgot, for the sake of auld lang syne,’ Harry murmured, squeezing John’s hand again. ‘Happy New Year, Johnny.’
‘Thought you’d never answer,’ she said, kissing his cheek and pushing two small figures inside before she stepped through the door as well, carrying a large burgundy suitcase.
‘It’s only been a week,’ John said gently, gripping his stick tightly as Sherlock led the way towards the station’s exit.
‘Oh, actually, Mycroft’s invited me to dinner.’ John finished his bread and wiped his hand on his trousers, scattering the breadcrumbs all over the floor. ‘He’s got a millionaire friend he wants to show off.’
They eat well. They had coal for the fire. John was happy. Sherlock’s eyes sunk and he coughed. He slept.
‘I...’ John spread the fingers of his right hand wide. ‘I can’t... I can’t help how I feel, Sherlock. I can’t help but be...’
‘Mmm, and why would you want to be kneeling at my feet?’ John said, turning his head to smirk at Sherlock, who squeezed John’s waist through the sleeveless pullover he had on.
‘Just the blast from a V2, Mrs Hudson, nothing to worry about.’
John shifted and gave no indication of the blow that was to come. He hit Sherlock hard, hard enough to make him cry out. ‘You want more, is that it?’ John said, bringing his dominant left hand down again, catching Sherlock in the same place, then again, then again, then again. ‘Greedy, desperate little thing, aren’t you, always after more, more stimulation, that’s it, isn’t it?’ he purred into Sherlock’s ear as he squeezed the hand round Sherlock’s neck and pushed Sherlock’s hips into the mattress by pushing his own hips against Sherlock’s bright red arse.
‘I do suppose it helps that his father didn’t die whilst he was young, as was the case with you and Doctor Watson--’
‘Uh, the name’s familiar--’
Sherlock was half-dressed and smoking frantically as he paced around his room. He couldn’t keep quiet any longer. He’d spent the entire year, probably even more, trying to ignore the near-desperate longing he felt for John. It had been there for years, since he was sixteen at least, but the events of the day had brought everything rushing to a head and he couldn’t
He looked skywards. The day was clear and probably as nice as November was ever going to get. John massaged his thigh discreetly as he watched a bird dive to land on the awning of a greengrocer’s, smiling at the funny waddling walk it had across the red and white striped material.
‘I love you,’ John breathed, cupping Sherlock’s face in his hands and pressing soft kisses to Sherlock’s mouth.
‘Mmm, yes. I met you.’
‘I am, I told you I won!’
‘If you’re going to call telling me the number of stops to count “directions”, then--’
a trick.’
‘And I you. Happy New Year.’
The old grandfather clock down in the hallway chimed. One. Two. Three pm.
‘No.’
‘“A source claims that Mr. Holmes is quite the musician, having composed his own pieces as well as being able to play anything from Bach to Rodgers and Hammerstein!”’
‘John, I will hardly be able to--’
‘You’ve no evidence to suggest I will,’ Sherlock said, ignoring the glare from Mycroft, his own frown deepening when Gilchrist burst out laughing.
John closed his eyes as the car pulled away.
John smiled again. ‘You’d be brilliant at whatever you set your mind to.’
‘I hardly think you’ve got any sort of right to be dictating what is and what isn’t appropriate.’ Sherlock glared at his brother, his contempt plain to see. ‘Not based on your track record.’
V-E Day
John kissed him again. Sherlock lit them both a cigarette. The sun set.
‘Oh, Sherlock, just do as you’re told, John is perfectly capable of searching by himself,’ Mrs Holmes said, pressing her fingertips to her right temple. ‘Lola, come here, darling, stay with me.’
‘What time ought we to leave?’ John asked, tangling his legs with Sherlock’s under the covers.
‘You’re... you’re fucking impossible,’ John spat, his jaw tight as he shook his head and sighed in exasperation, his face flushed with a mix of annoyance and embarrassment.
‘All the same,’ Sherlock said, putting his hands in the pockets of his coat. ‘I’ve missed you.’
‘Welcome home,’ John said, gently scratching the hair at Sherlock’s nape.  He smiled against Sherlock’s skin, his nose pressed into Sherlock’s cheek. ‘I’ll put the kettle on, shall I?’
‘No, no, I know, you’re right. Are you going to tell him I came?’
Sherlock smirked, sucking John's lower lip into his mouth, twisting his wrist at the end of each of his long strokes to John's prick. 'There? Is that right?'
‘What brings you here then, Doctor Watson?’ The bridge of Sherlock’s nose was burnt, his skin darker than it ever had been in London, turned a golden brown from the Moroccan sun. ‘I always imagined you’d be leading a decorated battalion or something by now.’
The twins began to howl with laughter. Sherlock dug in his pocket and pressed a small coin into each of their palms. ‘There. One trick, a shilling each, now bugger off.’ They ran out of the drawing room, whispering together, giggling again when they cast a backward look at Gilchrist’s nether regions.
John closed his eyes and rested his hand lightly on Sherlock’s chest, over his steadily beating heart.
‘Sherlock!’ A slight figure pushed through the crowd leaving the adjacent hut and waved at him, smiling eagerly.
‘Oh,’ Sherlock said, waving his hand. ‘Go, go and help. I just got caught by the blast.’
‘I love you.’
He dropped his hand and glanced upwards again. The sky was blue.
‘You’ll live without it,’ John replied, stroking Sherlock’s upper arm. ‘Get yourself to hospital and get examined properly. I love you,’ he whispered.
Their hands dropped as the clock next to them struck half past nine. Victor looked at it and then at John. ‘It really wouldn’t do much good, would it?’ he murmured, resigned.
‘I’d have to check, I haven’t been over this way--’
A knock at the door downstairs. Clenching his jaw in irritation, Sherlock intended to ignore it until the second, more insistent ring. Sherlock breathed out and went downstairs, throwing the door open wide enough that light spilt out onto the street.
‘Haven’t been practising, have you, son?’ The red-faced grocer who’d taken a fancy to Mrs Hudson asked Sherlock.
John said nothing, scooping a fast asleep Colin up into his arms. ‘I’ll come back down for Nancy. The bathroom’s next to Sherlock’s bedroom if you’d like to wash your face and clean your teeth and perhaps have a glass of water and an aspirin out of the cabinet.’
‘After the Easter vac in our third year he left a note in my room saying he was engaged and... oh, what does it matter, there’s no use in going over it again, it was years ago, John, I...’ Sherlock shook his head. ‘Mycroft took the opportunity to point out the fact that Victor-’ he almost spat the name, ‘-had managed to overcome his
'You always told me,' Sherlock said. 'You always said, always--'
The noise on Baker Street was deafening. Tables and chairs had been pulled out of front doors, bunting hung between houses haphazardly, food made and plated and offered to everyone. Music blared loudly from somewhere and children wearing paper hats squealed as they ran along, chasing one another.
Sherlock stopped his frantic movements and looked down at the poppy.
so much harder.
They both smiled giddily at each another as they caught their breath. A breeze swept in through the thin window, cooling the sweat on their skin.
Sherlock turned the lamp off and turned his head to brush a kiss against John’s temple. In the darkness, John smiled, the steady beat of Sherlock’s pulse against his fingertips and the sound of Sherlock breathing next to him easing him off to sleep.
‘The King’s Arms, this pub’s called,’ Sherlock said, adjusting his hat. ‘From looking at the map it should be just up on the left some-- aha!’ He grinned as he caught sight of Lestrade, looking world-weary and haggard as ever, leaning against the pub door about twenty feet away.
Sherlock took another drag on his cigarette as he watched Harry make her faltering way towards the bathroom. He stood up, his face twitching at a sudden flash of pain from his ribs.
‘Clear out part of the refrigerator. I’ll need it for fingers soon enough.’
, John’s nails were scraping at his pink skin again, hot and sharp and-- ‘Am I going to have to keep you still myself?’ John growled, his mouth against Sherlock’s ear, warm and wet, and Sherlock couldn’t help but shiver at his tone.
‘He plays that bloody song all the time,’ John said with a half-choked laugh, pulling a pack of cigarettes out of the inside pocket of his jacket. He extracted two and lit the both of them, handing one to Sherlock without looking at him.
‘Haven’t I always surprised you?’ Sherlock said, turning to look at John. He rested his elbow on the bar and leant his head against his fist, taking another drag from his cigarette. There was a moment’s silence before Sherlock said, ‘I’ve a room.’
‘Try that again and I’ll break it,’ he hissed, dark eyes glaring up from under his brow.
Mycroft Holmes turned the handle of his bone china teacup ninety degrees, the base of the cup making a scraping sound against its saucer. The heavy curtains shifted minutely in the barely-there summer breeze from the open French doors that led onto the balcony. Mycroft remained out of sight, just inside the hallway that came to a stop with the doors, but with a clear enough view of the large, deep fountain on the lawn. He lifted his teacup to his lips and watched as his brother approached the fountain, gripping an Erlenmeyer flask at its neck. A bead of sweat rolled down the back of Mycroft’s neck as he tilted his wrist and sipped his tea, which scalded his throat on its way down.
‘Looks to be.’ John squinted at it and touched the tip of his finger to the stain.
‘Shh, shh,’ John murmured, rubbing over where his palm had just landed, soothing the sting. He kissed Sherlock’s shoulder blade, grazed the skin gently with his teeth. ‘Lie down now, settle, come on, that’s it, good boy,
‘Shh, shh,’ John murmured, kissing Sherlock’s jaw and neck, slowly scissoring his fingers, rubbing Sherlock’s waist with his other hand, up and down, soothing.
‘Come with Sherlock and I. Gilchrist, John--’
‘Well, aren’t there any ships?’
‘Champion idiot,’ John said, kissing Sherlock’s chest as he eased Sherlock’s braces off his shoulders, unbuttoning his shirt and slipping the vest over his head. ‘Careful with your bruises.’
‘I, ah, I’d rather appreciate your medical expertise,’ Sherlock replied, taking his hat off and turning to face John, whose eyebrows raised comically at the state of Sherlock’s face and hands. Sherlock’s right eye was swollen shut, a large purple bruise surrounding it. Dried blood crusted around his nose and just above his lips, the bottom one split. A shallow cut followed the line of his cheekbone, pinkish blood surrounding it. The skin of his knuckles was split open, his hands swollen and bloody.
‘Mr. Holmes.’ John grinned and took Sherlock’s hand, squeezing. ‘I’ve missed you,’ he said quietly, the other people on the platform too busy to pay them any mind.
‘We’ll look for them, they won’t have gone far,’ John said immediately, stubbing his unsmoked cigarette out, getting to his feet. ‘Come on, Sherlock.’
‘Go away,’ Sherlock said, staring out at the path still.
Their numbers marching forwards grew by the day. The formal ranks had broken up and had been replaced by soldiers, British and French, and refugees weaving between the traffic that drove slowly on to the salt-tainted air of the coast. John’s eyes were heavy with both boredom and exhaustion as they neared the end of a village. The discipline of the earlier march, when they were fewer in number, had disappeared almost entirely. As a result, John was stuck listening to Private Nettle set the world to rights.
‘I think all London’s criminals must have gone on their summer holidays,’ John said, pushing the handle of Sherlock’s teacup against his fingers. ‘You haven’t had a case - a really good case - for weeks.’
‘I’m sorry I’ve no money. I’m sorry I can’t take care of you.’
“Easy Sherlock, easy, Jesus Christ you look so gorgeous, so handsome for me, god you’re amazing.” Using his hand that was sticky with Lube, John wrapped it around Sherlock’s cock and gave it a few strokes all while he started to gently move in and out of Sherlock’s body. Hearing a sound of distress from below him, John glanced down at Sherlock.
“Oh John. It’s okay.” Sherlock’s voice was soft, obviously trying to be comforting. It made John snap.
“Oh Jesus.” John pulled his rapidly softening cock out and rolled off of Sherlock as they both lay there gasping like they’d just run a marathon.
John noted the reaction with carnal satisfaction.
“Where are you going?” Sherlock questioned as John got to his feet.
So, he spent the next two hours talking with his hallucination, and loving every damn minute of it, until his phone buzzed and reminded him that he had dinner reservations with Mary in an hour.
“My therapist suggested that it might help me to find closure sooner if I was to visit again and I’ve found that visiting is helping quite a bit.” John explained. Mary accepted his explanation and didn’t question it farther.
"Nothing, it's nothing its just..." John shook his head and sighed. "What the hell am I going to tell Mary?”
“I don’t care, oh god, John, please, yes please do it.” Sherlock begged. John shook his head as a grin crossed his face.
His need to cum faded, John quickly set a bruising punishing pace in and out of Sherlock. Sherlock held onto John for dear life, his long legs wrapping around John’s hips, his nails digging into John’s shoulders.
“Jesus fuck Sherlock.” The need to cum was steadily building again. A few more thrusts and John was right on the edge again. John started to pull out.
“Good.” John’s confirmation of Sherlock’s reply was short and firm. And yet having got what he wanted, John didn’t move. He stayed with his hands on top of Sherlock’s, their noses almost touching, John looming over Sherlock instead of vice versa like normal. Sherlock’s breath hitched and it confirmed everything that they were both feeling.
‘I was lucid enough to walk to your flat, but you’re the expert.’
‘He isn’t like he pretends to be,’ John said, shaking his head minutely.
John stood up and placed the guard around the fireplace. ‘I’ve changed the sheets on my bed for you, Harry, and made up a bed on the floor with a spare mattress and some blankets for Colin and Nancy. I’ll give you a hand with getting the children to bed, come on.’
‘Uh, let’s see.’ Lestrade blinked a couple of times and pulled his notebook and own torch out of his pocket, clicking it on to read his notes. ‘He was discovered by the landlord’s daughter two nights ago when she came down to change one of the barrels. We questioned her and didn’t have anything to be suspicious about--’
