He answered and waited for one of them to say something. In the end, nobody said anything because Holmes was out of the door the moment he grabbed his coat from the mantelpiece. “This is at least a six, Giovanni!”, shouted an excited Detective, as he almost jumped down the stairs to get to his favourite place in the world: crime scenes. “I...am sorry, Greg.” “No, no. I'm used to his behaviour by now.”, Greg smiled in John's direction but still thought if it would be possible for him to shoot himself in his foot, so he could retire a little early. Like two or three decades early. He sighs again before John is ready to follow the world's only consulting Detective
How was John the only one who wasn't helping? “Mam, I think this belongs to you.” Sherlock was handing the bag to the woman, who just witnessed a robbery gone wrong, where she was originally the victim. This must certainly be her lucky day.
“This is most interesting. I truly did not anticipate such a forceful reaction, even with this amount of perchloric acid it shouldn't have been this loud. Interesting.” The reason for the not-so-quiet-morning in 221B Baker Street was standing in front of a half-empty kitchen table, his hair even more unruly than usual. The other half of his equipment was now lying on the floor, mostly broken from the explosive impact. “John quick, hand me my-”
“John, we should go back to the flat, I think this was enough exercise for today.” Sherlock was changing directions just after finishing his sentence, so John had no choice but to follow. “How did you react so fast?” He had long abandoned the idea that his flatmate wasn't really human, but he would still like some answers.
John was totally and absolutely pissed. Not only did Sherlock start a fight with everyone at the crime scene, from the Police Inspectors to the witnesses, he also ran after the possible murderer. Not that he would bother to take a gun with him while sprinting after almost-certainly-murderers, or maybe wait for him or Lestrade, no. This was Sherlock Bloody Holmes, who doesn't wait for anyone.
“No!”, John was already fuming and it was, still, not even nine in the morning. “How can you not even be able to survive one damn day without destroying something in our flat? Even one day where you don't break stuff?”, even though John was slightly bored with the normality of his week, it didn't mean that he wanted to fear safety in his own home. Almost his own home. It was kinda theirs.
John looked at the little creature, that was placed on their couch, so it could continue to sleep. The little thing was outright adorable. Its' brown and white fur was slightly dirty from lying on the street, but it looked nonetheless like an absolutely lovable little creature. “Did you find it outside?”, John asked and turned to Sherlock, who finally shed his wet coat and shirt while searching for a towel.
This couldn't be real. Sherlock Holmes did not just suggest that they train a Corgi as they...what? Tracking dog? “Sherlock! This is a Corgi. Not a bloodhound or anything of that sort. He doesn't want to help to solve crimes, he wants to play and maybe get a belly rub in the afternoon.” John could feel a headache slowly making its' way to his forehead.
“John, Sherlock I hope you aren't busy today, I think I have something for you.” When Greg Lestrade entered the flat he saw Sherlock Holmes, who looked like something blew up in his face, and Dr. John Watson with tea stains all over his jumper. One of them tried to look indifferent but was secretly craving for a case. The other looked like the could get back into his bed straight away. “What kind of murder?”, Sherlock didn't even feel slightly guilty as he asked about a dead person, like others would ask their mail man after their Amazon packages. Lestrade sighed deeply, “Double murder, wife and husband dead, no sign of forced entry and the murderer took their time to paint smileys on the walls. With their blood.”
“Couldn't.”, Sherlock whispered again but this time he opened his coat fully, so John could see why exactly he wasn't able to protect himself from the London weather. Under his coat, safely tucked in Sherlock's right side was a little Corgi half asleep, and perfectly protected from the rain.
“I would remember to feed him, it's not that hard. He would have a place in my Mind Palace, so he wouldn't starve.” Sherlock sounded so sure of himself, it was almost cute. Then John remembered that they would have a dog in their flat which he, most likely, had to care for. It was definitely too late for this crap.
John didn't want to admit it, but he did enjoy the morning walk in the park. It had a calming effect on him, perfect for going to the clinic later and having to deal with hysteric men with haemorrhoids, or little children with a fear of doctors. Nevertheless, he had to address the elephant in the room.
John Watson was, contrary to what his best friend thinks, not a stupid man. He realised quite early in their friendship that there was no use to prohibit the great Sherlock Holmes just about anything. He nevertheless had hope in some basic rules. Like no human heads in the fridge, or holes in the wall. He just couldn't understand anymore how other people complained about empty juice bottles in the fridge or untidy desks.
When John finally arrived at 221B Baker Street he was wet, hungry and in dire need of something stronger than wine. While making a beeline to the little cupboard where he kept his Whiskies, he noticed that Sherlock still wasn't home.
So now John was walking through the London rain because he forgot his wallet this morning and didn't have money for a cab. At least he remembered to take his umbrella with him. It was currently ten o'clock in the evening and he didn't eat anything since that morning, so it is relatively save to say that this just wasn't one of John's best days.
At that moment John thanked whoever gave Sherlock those cat-like reflexes, because even before he comprehended what was about to happen, Sherlock put his leg almost elegantly in the way of the mugger and gave him a not-so-gentle kick. So the poor lad went flying to the ground before he got barked at by a caramel coloured tiny monster.
to happen. Just a little murder. Or a kidnapping. Maybe Mycroft needed their help. Just as Watson was finishing his thoughts, a loud and almost window-shattering explosion was heard from the kitchen.
But when John walked into the living room, he had a slightly different picture in front of him. Sherlock was sitting in his usual chair, legs crossed and violin in his hands, he wasn't playing though. No, he tried to prevent The Puppy from playing fetch with his bow. At the same time, John could hear that he was explaining to the little creature the concept of...arsenic poisoning?
John had to smile at this, who thought that the only thing needed to kill the boredom of the Detective, was a little puppy with slightly too much energy. “Okay, you know what? You're gonna...busy him for some more time and I will get some dog food. And milk, we can't always steal from Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock just nodded as he tried to prevent the little dog from killing the couch cushions, John could still see some bite marks.
That came unexpectedly. John looked into his friends' face to see if he was merely joking, but no, he looked like he just announced the name of the murderer at any crime scene. This day was getting better until the very end.
Why wasn't there one day that went normal and without incidents? Any why was the mugger running in their direction?
“Easy, after he had the woman's bag he had to choose a direction. He had to run away from the scene as fast as possible, so he would not run further into the park. On his left side were too many people who could have stopped him and on the right side was an hot-dog booth in his path, so he had to run in our direction.” Holmes finished as if it was incredibly boring to know a strangers next steps, but Watson was still impressed.
“John, even you probably noticed that we didn't have a case for ten days, forty-three minutes and fifty-five seconds. What exactly do you expect me to do? My brain needs stimuli, it's not as plain as yours after all.” Deep breath in, deep breath out. John heard that this should help against spontaneous impulses of violence. The person who told him that was a God damned liar. “Sherlock I swear if you do not stop with-” “Geoff is coming.”, and again John Watson was confused by his flatmate. “Who?”, he blinked in Sherlock's direction and then to the door. No one was coming up the stairs. “Geoff, George, Gerald, whatever. Maybe he finally has a case for us that isn't simply a one or two.”, somehow Sherlock looked more and more excited every second and then there were fast steps on their stairs.
Holmes didn't even seem to notice that other people in the park were starting to stare as he jogged behind his little companion, to keep up with his enthusiasm.
The picture the Londoners were seeing at the park that day, was probably one of a kind. One of the most famous people in London was walking a tiny dog through the park, while his blogger was trailing behind him. If it is taken into consideration that Sherlock Homes is not a small man, the image comes to life as moderately ridiculous.
“Sherlock, listen to me. I know you've already made up your mind but...we really cannot keep a dog. He will be lonely and sad and...we aren't even at home most of the time.” “Then we will take him with us.” How could he think that everything and everyone was appropriate at a crime scene? The dog would most likely destroy evidence, or just run off because he would get scared by all the different people. Just as Watson was about to present his carefully constructed argument, a woman not even two hundred meters away from them started to scream. “My bag! Quick, he has my bag!”
The doctor nodded back and headed towards his coat. He clutched it in his arms and abruptly turned back to look at the other man. “I....”
Mary Morstan had always felt she had a simple soul, with simple needs and wants. She had often wondered why or how she had become a cold blooded assassin.
His thoughts must have played obviously across his face, as even his wonderful, unobservant John looked worried.
Mycroft’s theory had been proved right. Caring had left people vulnerable and at risk. His colleague, his housekeeper, his best friend had all become Moriarty’s targets.
John smirked “Your secret is safe with me.” He looked down into his cooling tea “What would I do for you?” At Sherlock’s curious look, he elaborated “When you had a nightmare. What would I do for you?”
John took a deep breath, Sherlock could tell he was trying to weigh his words carefully. “Why are you burning my shirt?”
“I remember” he gasped, he felt so overwhelmed. “God...I remember.” He fell forward on to Sherlock’s chest and started to sob.
“Don’t Sherlock, just don’t.” John snapped, as he grabbed his coat and left the flat in his pyjamas and bare feet.
His surroundings slowly came in to focus and he could see why this particular memory had chosen to rear it’s ugly head this evening. There was a thunder storm raging outside and he had left the window open, and slept in nothing but his boxers and a sheet, as it had been a particularly warm evening. The joys of summer in London. John would have checked the forecast and prepared. He didn’t do well with thunderstorms either.....in fact he was probably being affected by this one – even worse than usual, as his mind thought Afghanistan was only a few months ago.
“I was wondering what you used to do for your girlfriends in terms of romance.” John had frowned at his comment. “It’s research for a case, an experiment” He had fumbled nervously.
Fury seemed to rise on Sherlock’s face “Oh please do explain how I should react when I see my husband being pawed at by a beautiful woman, laughing and joking, when he doesn’t want to spend time with me.”
‘The fact that I am in love with you’ John thought. He hadn’t really accepted it until after Sherlock had jumped, it had seemed less risky to admit it to a ghost. And now he was back with his ridiculous cheekbones and John was struggling to handle his ‘new’ feelings.
Back in the apartment John grabbed Sherlock loosely by the lapels “So that’s not the first time Mrs Hudson has caught in the entryway then?” he asked, with his eyebrows raised.
Apologies for the gap in chapters, although this one is a bit longer than the others. Thanks for all the comments and kudos! Warnings at the end of the chapter.
Finn looked flustered and didn’t know what to do. She feigned a louder sob. “Ok, ok. It might be better to hear it from me first, give you time to process before seeing Pops again.” He paused and took a deep breath “He has regained his memories of everything, of us, of my Dad.” He beamed.
The advantage of having been ousted from Moriarty’s inner circle was that she wasn’t on a certain Mr Holmes' radar when he had set out to dismantle it.
“I know” John said, his eyes soft “but it exposed what you are feeling and it helped me understand why I feel so inadequate.”
Sherlock’s heart dropped at John’s words – something was wrong? With what? With them, with him? Something must have shown in his eyes or his face, because John quickly retracted his words “No I don’t mean it like that, nothing’s wrong with us.” He reached his hand out to Sherlock across the table. He paused and brushed their fingers together. “I love you Sherlock, never doubt that.” The detective would never tire of hearing those words from John’s lips. “These past few months have been.....extraordinary.”
They had automatically found their way back to Baker Street and it had seemed like the most natural thing to do. He had fallen asleep to violin music in his old bed, with hope for tomorrow.
John nodded and hung around at the doorway for longer than necessary, before leaving their flat, which now felt as empty as Sherlock’s heart.
“I have faith that our son won’t have fallen in love with someone so delicate to be put off by a lover’s tiff.”
“Sherlock I need to tell you something.....it’s not easy for me to say....but I want you to know that this....development has made me really happy and I know you want me to be happy.....and I want you to be happy too and I think this could be a new start for all of us....so I am just going to say it....Mary and I are engaged.” His eyes had stayed on the floor and he gradually managed to bring them up to a silent Sherlock.....who was still looking into his microscope, not paying any attention at all.
John always knew the right thing to say and his whole endeavour seemed ridiculous now. “Does that mean you would have said no?”
John smiled and stood up to kiss Sherlock sweetly and forcefully. He giggled again and murmured “Perfect”.
“No" John said as he stilled his movements. Sherlock lifted his eyebrows in disbelief. “I mean yes it is, of course, but I thought I heard something.” He pulled his gun out from the back of his trousers and motioned for Sherlock to follow him.
Sherlock had begrudgingly agreed to complete the paperwork at the station, so John could release Finn from Mrs Hudson’s watchful eye. Now that he was dealing with a sulky teenager, with something obviously on his mind, he wasn’t sure if he had got the better end of the deal.
Her plan had gone better than she could have dreamed. For once things not going to plan had worked unbelievably in her favour.
John was apprehensive about saying what he wanted to say however, as he wasn’t sure if it would be the best option. One thing he knew for certain was that Sherlock would think it was the best option, once he heard it. So John was scared to say it, because once it was out there it couldn’t be taken back and the other man would not rest until it happened, until they got that option. He was surprised Sherlock hadn’t thought of it himself, perhaps he cared too much in this – perhaps for once Mycroft was right - caring was a disadvantage.
“No I’m finished here.” Sherlock replied, as he handed John a mug. They headed back to the living room and Sherlock stopped in his tracks, as he saw John sit down in his chair.
Mycroft seemed to have a similar realisation to Molly a few moments before. His nephew was no longer the little boy he once was. The one who was scared of his umbrella and sulked on his bottom step because he didn’t get his way. He nodded “I wish you the best of luck. Inform me if there is anything either of you need, whatever it is I will sort it. I will also keep you informed of Dr Watson’s status, should there be an update.”
He must have drifted off at some point, as Mary’s alarm woke him up at her usual 7am wake up time. His eyes felt sore and he had a headache. He had slept, but he hadn’t rested.
“You absolute bloody cock” the doctor all but sobbed, as his face fell against a firm chest, with a rapidly beating heart.
How wonderful would it have been if John was already in love with someone else once he returned? How she would have loved to see his face when he realised he wasn’t the centre of John’s universe anymore! And it all would have been a lie! That had certainly felt like the sweetest revenge.
The other man almost rolled his eyes as if irritated. “It’s only a six.” He dismissed. John felt like pointing it had been an 8 when he had wanted his doctor out of bed this morning. Sherlock preceded to take the tags out of the box “But these are a 10- an 11 even.” His eyes found John’s, alight with wonder and possibility. “When you said you were finally going to move your stuff in here, I didn’t even think about finding these.”
Lestrade snorted and gave John his own long stare. “I don’t want to think what his life would have been like if you two hadn’t shared that bloody flat.”
“It was uncomfortable.” John finally offered. Finn looked to his father, silently encouraging him to continue. “He deduced my news before I had even sat down. He did his best to pretend he was ok with the fact that I am seeing someone.” John might not know Sherlock as well as he used to, but he could recognise when his still husband was putting on a brave face. “I felt so awful.” John shook his head, the emotions were getting to him. “I feel so awful. I feel like I’m cheating on him, I don’t know whether Mary is worth this. I should maybe give him more time.”
He looked back over to Finn. Love also had its advantages, Sherlock reminded himself in a voice that sounded suspiciously like his husband’s.
“He lives with and loves you, never mind Afghanistan, of course he can fight. Come on I think you should come with me.” He signalled towards the paramedics and started to pull Sherlock towards his police car.
Molly’s heart broke a little at that. “At least you will know it’s because this....tragedy has changed him, not because you weren’t entirely yourself. I’m not gonna lie and tell you I have all the answers and I know what will get John back to you. But I know that John is attracted to danger and things that are unique. If that doesn’t sum you up in a nutshell, I don’t know what does.” A small smile graced the detective’s face. “Sherlock you have also got to remember that this isn’t all about John. You have been through a tragedy too. In a way for you it’s worse, because you have all your memories and you know what you have lost.” Tears started to seep out of the man’s eyes and Molly wiped them away. “You need to give yourself some time to deal with this too and not worry about what that would look like to John. Talk to him, take him on a case for Christ’s sake – try to get some of your own normality into your life again. Stop trying to be something you think John wants and start being the man he loves. If there is one thing I know about John Watson is that he isn’t interested in anybody that is meek and polite.”
Before that thought could fully form in his mind a “John!” was heard from the flat. Bloody hell, they were here. ‘Pull yourself together Watson’ he thought to his reflection. ‘You are a soldier.’
Sherlock halted at this and considered. He looked at the cold cases strewn across the room, in his usual messy fashion. John would have something to say about that, he was sure. The hospital room had started to resemble Baker Street, except without the warmth and homeliness. He didn’t want to admit it (and he never would out loud), but Lestrade was right. John wouldn’t want him camping out here and, as he looked over to his unmoving husband, Sherlock was losing that hope that he would ever wake up......and the longer Sherlock stayed here, the sooner he would have to face that fact.
Despite the trickery, his heart had certainly been racing, more so than it had in Sherlock’s absence. God he had missed the thrill. He had missed the excitement, the risk, the danger....the man.
Sherlock pulled away and looked directly into Finn’s eyes “Your father has a direct trauma to his frontal lobe and has been unconscious since impact. He is currently in surgery to help alleviate the swelling. There is a 87% chance he won’t open his eyes again and a 62% chance he won’t survive the operation. As we have not yet heard from my dear, old brother, his chances of surviving the current procedure are increasing.” Sherlock paused and looked at their joined hands. “He also suffered a fairly minor stab wound to his lower chest.”
“I know” Molly replied without a trace of doubt. She opened the door to a private room, where Mycroft and Lestrade were talking hurriedly in the corner. “Where’s Sherlock?” she demanded.
Her beloved James had killed himself. He had put a gun in his mouth, because of that.....monster, so that he could win their stupid game. She knew Sherlock had goaded Moriarty into it, she knew it was his fault – he must have manipulated him somehow. She hadn’t been there to help, to save him from himself and the allures of Sherlock bloody Holmes. She would never forgive herself, but more than that, she would never stop until she had gotten revenge.
“Sherlock have you got porn playing on your phone whilst we are with our son at dinner?” he asked, bewildered and angry.
I'm back - I really feel like I am starting to get somwhere with this story. This is another flashback scene, whete John is fielding questions from a teenage Finn. I don't think there are any warnings, but do let me know if you think there is something I should flag. As always this is just for fun.
John snorted and laughed, the moment broken. Sherlock smiled and swooped down to kiss him, stopping him mid laugh. The kiss was soft and long and full of mirth. John revelled in it.
Ok now they were getting somewhere, John thought, but his blood was still pumping and he wasn’t backing down anytime soon. “Do you?” he countered.
As ever with Sherlock, John was a bit startled at the topic of conversation. “Is this one of those occasions where you think we have discussed this already, but I actually wasn’t in the room?”
Finn had mentioned that John had written a blog during his and Sherlock’s early years together, so he had turned to the only person he could truly trust at the moment...himself. He had found the blog page and poured over every entry, trying to find out who this Sherlock Holmes really was and find some insight into the man he himself had become. The first thing he had got from it was that he adored Sherlock or maybe worshipped him. The way his other self described the detective was like he was in awe of him. He had been surprised it took so long for the two of them to get together. If Sherlock had read this, surely he would have picked up on that in a second, if ‘idiot’ John Watson could.
Sherlock had contemplated John’s movement, annoyed at himself for not being able to put together the perfect, simple proposal.
Finn laughed and then sobered “It was for me.” And the emotion behind it took John’s breath away, he squeezed the boy’s hand. “Basically it’s helpful to have the man who is running the government as a brother.”
Sherlock giggled and John looked at him and slowly felt the beginning of a smile on his own face. Before he knew it they were bothering giggling like the school boys they had behaved like and the tension was broken.
A serial killer and a bullet through a window later, he was giggling with this extraordinary, loyal man at a crime scene. Sherlock couldn’t remember the last time he had giggled. No one except Mycroft had put themselves out there for him before. It had been an alien feeling to Sherlock and he had been John Watson’s ever since.
“Sherlock" John whispered, in shock. The detective went over to the other man and gathered him in his arms, as he joined him on the floor.
“Well I don’t know what else to do!....John has been through a ridiculously tragic and confusing thing and he’s stuck with me to help him through it. First time around I wasn’t trying to make him love me. I was trying to impress him sure and show him some excitement, but I never imagined I would end up with.... feelings. By the time I had accepted I was in love with him, he already knew everything about me and all my faults, so I didn’t need to change anything about myself.”
Sherlock started laughing without humour and pulled away from the edge. He looked manic, like the madman who once stood with him there. He looked at the younger man and said “I’m not going to jump.” Sherlock could hear the sigh of relief from where he stood. “If there is the slightest chance your father survives this nightmare, I wouldn’t let him wake to that....And you must know I would never willingly leave you Finn.”
So he had ‘put himself out there’ and had arranged a date with ‘Jackie’. She seemed nice enough, with easy smiles and an uncomplicated life (she didn’t look like she kept body parts in the fridge) and John found her to be a welcome distraction. She by no means led him out from the fog he was under, but she provided some light.
Sherlock seemed surprised at the turn in conversation, but recovered quickly “Well yes I guess you will need to speak...”
John was taken aback by this. Yes Sherlock and he had had their emotional moments, you know when a bomb and a swimming pool had been involved, but he had never seen the other man like this. He was used to the unemotional, unforgiving, unrelenting force that was Sherlock Holmes. That’s who he had fallen in love with
This adjustment had involved a lot of cigarettes, tears, anger and not much else. He received daily visits from Finn with food and demands to go to sleep. Despite Sherlock’s protestations, Finn wouldn’t have it that his body was only transport and that he needed more than the 40 cigarettes he was smoking a day. The detective had snapped that if Finn had anything harder available, he would be more than happy to take it. Finn’s eyes had gone cold at that and Sherlock had felt the chill in his veins, immediately regretting his words. Before he could stutter out an apology, Finn beat him to it.
Oh....well that did make some sort of sense to John. He could feel himself to start to feel a little lighter, but “What about Irene?”
The words were like a bucket of cold water to the detective’s heated anger. It was so strange to see the body of the man he loved, (adored, cherished) spouting such awful things about him. It was like the nightmares he had had when he came back from the dead – they were becoming a reality. How had he found himself here - how had he lost almost everything he cared about to be left with a  man who said such things?
He thought back to the dream, he could barely remember it now. Just the feeling of lust and.....Sherlock. The detective had finally asked him to join him on a case today, so maybe that’s what brought it on. John had been so excited to finally share this with him again - maybe Sherlock was ready to see more of John. It didn’t take the other man long however to deduce what his current relationship status was and the rest of the afternoon had been awkward.
“Exactly. So she was clearly sending a message to someone - she is part of an organisation or gang and has been wronged somehow. She has picked someone entirely random, so that we have little to go on to catch her. She is trying to bait someone to come out and play. I would start looking for people who look like this man or who have died in the same way. Or most likely both and you might get somewhere.”
Maybe John would have got married and Sherlock would have been best man. Both of them believing this was the best it could be, pretending that they weren’t the most important people in each other’s lives. John had never been more grateful for a text from Irene Adler.
“The way he spoke about you was so full of....love and I had never witnessed or experienced that before. I wanted to meet this man, who was worthy of my Sherlock.” Finn laughed “It’s so embarrassing to think of that now, how much I was in awe of him.”
John thought of their ceremony, his hands shaking and his eyes misty. He had fumbled his vows and had been a bumbling mess, Sherlock had been calm and collected...the bastard....but the look in his eyes had been everything John had ever wanted to see on his wedding day. “Err there was a bit of eye contact going on.”
John’s eyes opened again to find Sherlock’s, but he continued as if he hadn’t heard his words. “I took you to the circus.”
Now that the anger and hurt had faded, he realised he had been given a gift – a miracle that he had once begged for.
He almost hadn’t believed it when his goal had become a reality and he had been on his way back to London, to Baker Street....to John.
Finn snuffled in his sleep and the detective looked over to his son. He was elegantly drooling into his Belstaff, his signature coat swamping the young man’s slight form. He had loved that coat (and its many incarnations) since he was a young boy. It was almost like a security blanket to him and, seeing him wrapped up in it now, reminded him he could protect someone. He could provide comfort and he had to maintain his resolve. Finn did not deserve a weak father, he had already had one before...before Sherlock and John. He had promised him then that he would be there for him and he needed to keep that promise.
There was a long silence and the tension between them turned into something else. Finally John spoke “Do you know what I was thinking about as I came through the door just then? After spending the evening with a beautiful woman, who was ‘pawing’ at me?” the other man shook his head. “How much I wanted you to ravish me.”
But without their son there as a buffer, the undeniable truth started to creep up on John that he had left Sherlock, he had betrayed him. God how could he have done that? How could he forget such a man?
“Thanks” John replied, as he took a welcome sip of the hot drink “And thanks for last night – I didn’t know where else to go.”
“Come on Sherlock it’s a ten – at least!” Lestrade emphasised, as he stood at the bottom of John’s hospital bed. “We can’t solve it without you.”
His detective had been exuberant and alive and John had basked in it. In different circumstances it might have felt like a date.
Then there were the comforting hugs, the it’s not real anymore hugs, the I’m safe, you’re safe hugs – the hug that Sherlock could use right now. The last time he held John was the day he got hurt and it now felt like a physical ache to have that contact. It was all John’s fault of course, he didn’t need to be held before he met him. He had abhorred physical contact, unless it got him what he needed. Now he feels like he will never be warm again...
“It is neither of your Birthdays soon and a job promotion would only really excite one partner. Pregnancy would not be an automatic celebration, due to your situation with Finn and myself. So that only leaves...” John could see the moment the penny dropped in that brilliant brain of his.
“Of course I was at the hospital John – I came to tell you about the case, to see you – I don’t know share my day with you, as you were sooo busy working and couldn’t possibly spend time with your husband.”
“Oh really?.....Does my help include distracting you to the point where you have forgotten the experiment ever existed?”
Sherlock stood up, in all his glory, “Why didn’t you say so?” he said, annoyed and reached for his Belstaff.
“Well it would have been if you hadn’t interrupted us. Are you finally going to get to the point of your visit or are you just here to deny my sexual gratification? Because if that’s the case, I can assure you I am not shy.”
...but he hadn’t been able to face going back to his own flat alone. Despite his anger, a big part of him was too scared to let Sherlock out of his sight, in case it was another trick. In case he had dreamt it...
It was an overcast day, but dry. Not dissimilar from THAT day, the day he jumped. He was sitting within touching distance of where Moriarty had killed himself. A stone’s throw from where he had given John his ‘note’.
John snatched the shirt out of the other man’s hands and doused the small flames. “Hey!” Sherlock protested.
John sighed, relieved – at least he hadn’t ballsed that one up. “Maybe you should ask your Dad.” He suggested, although God knows what Sherlock would come up with, but he can’t be the only one fielding the emotional minefields.
John was very much on board with this change in pace, tendrils of arousal starting to move through him.
Here's another chapter - if you are still with me on this. I do have an outline in place and I am slowly but surely getting to finishing this fic. Thanks for bearing with me. As ever this is just for fun! No warnings that I am aware of.
Finn’s upbringing had been difficult to say the least and abnormal in every way. The life that John and he could offer him would seem like a dream in comparison, which they were more than happy to offer him. When Finn had started school, when he had made friends, when he had started asking questions, when he had gone round to his classmates’ houses, when he had started to learn about the real world Sherlock had started to panic. Why would Finn want to stay with them then? When he was surrounded by ‘normal’ people and ‘normal’ families? Despite these misgivings, Finn didn’t seem to show any signs of defecting to a more usual lifestyle. Sherlock would observe and deduce his every move and he didn’t seem to be thinking that he would be happier in a different environment. But Sherlock didn’t feel secure until the adoption had officially been approved. Not that he would stop Finn if he wanted to leave in the future, but the young boy had been given the option to back out. He had seen some of the world and still decided to stay at Baker Street, with John and with Sherlock. The detective had never been chosen by anyone except John and now he had a family. Not one that had been forced on any of them and Sherlock was overwhelmed with the feeling of permanence and....home.
But John ploughed on “I’m sorry I made you believe that there would ever be a world where I would leave you.”
But Sherlock was definitely aware of the doctor’s presence now, despite his current intense text conversation with another man. Said gentleman had actually interrupted their morning bedroom activities, which had also been suffering recently. He had almost resented the text from Lestrade as it had come in.
Sherlock nodded, as he rubbed his thumb over John’s hand. The doctor liked the feeling. The other man started to talk again “Thank you for saying that, but whatever happens between you and I, please don’t let that affect your relationship with Finn. If your memories don’t come back, he deserves to still have his father in his life. You can make new memories, you don’t need the old ones to-“
Then John Watson had entered his life, quite unexpectedly. He had not thought much of their first meeting, although instantly feeling that there was something different about him. He hadn’t expected their flat share would last long, not after John had spent more time with him, so he had wanted to impress him as much as he could. Hoping that John would at least remember him, even if he didn’t like him.
The thing is he was already married, even though he couldn’t remember doing it. Does it still count? It certainly did to Sherlock. Neither of them had mentioned the ‘d word’ since John had left. He hadn’t wanted to bring it up with the detective, as it felt cruel and unnecessary. Now however they would need to get the ball rolling and get....divorced. Maybe his engagement would be the kick up the backside they needed to get things sorted and for them both to move on. He was sure it wouldn’t be easy, but it had to be done eventually and there was no reason to draw things out.
“Oh and I love you, never forget that.” At John’s heart-breaking silence, he finally turned and left the room.
John had left the next morning and, despite the doctor’s assurance that he would be back eventually, Sherlock was frightened that his doctor would never forgive him. It was this fear that ruled his actions in the following months. He had kept his distance, didn’t initiate contact, didn’t pester.....didn’t ‘Sherlock’. It went against Sherlock’s very nature, but he would do it for John so he could have some space. He would do it to get him back.
Warnings: mentions of sexual situations (hints at het), mental health exploration, mentions of dead bodies
“It’s a close thing Sherlock, but he’s not gone yet. He’s going to need to fight for it, but he’s got a chance.”
Well if he had to imagine his life in the future, being married with a son would be pretty lovely. Especially when his spouse was bloody gorgeous. How the hell had he managed that? John coughed and looked down at his hands in his lap. He glanced up to see that his husband was half smiling. “What? Is this your deducing thing?”
John nodded and feeling bold, pulled at the collar of the infallible Belstaff to bring the detective closer. The other man was trembling, as his hands found John’s waist. “I had a great day today Sherlock, thank you. You are amazing.” The detective’s eyes went soft at this and he touched his forehead to John’s. Their lips tentatively found each other in a tame, soft kiss. The doctor however couldn’t contain the energy coursing through him and pulled Sherlock down for a bruising kiss.
John coughed and looked at his feet, a sure sign to Sherlock he was hiding something “Did you-you not hear what I just said?”
John had been on a date, if you can believe it. John almost didn’t. He hadn’t been on one since Sherlock jumped and the fast approaching year’s anniversary had made him realise how much his life had....stopped. He had stopped seeing his friends, stopped writing the blog, stopped dating. He realised he had been here before, renting a bedsit with his gun in his desk drawer...wondering if today would be the day that he finally used it. In that instance he had - on a murderous cabbie. He didn’t want to think what he would do this time round given the opportunity.
The sight he found once he turned round was, however, not what he expected. Shock jolted through him, as he registered John gripping the kitchen counter top, his eyes wide and knuckles white. He looked pained, shocked and terrified.
But this information was for ‘normal’ people, not for emotionally constipated people like Sherlock. So he had been determined to work harder than everyone else and he had known that challenging would be an understatement.
Sherlock was numb, but the underlying hope from John’s words caused him to dumbly nod in acceptance. “I look forward to seeing you again John, whenever that may be.” He offered, his voice shaken.
“Don’t ever let me go again Sherlock....please” the other man’s voice was thick with emotion and the words almost broke Sherlock's fragile heart.
She had known that Sherlock Holmes was trouble and that he wasn’t worthy of all that attention. She had known that he was Moriarty’s weakness and she had told James as much.
Apparently it was ‘normal’ for boys his age, how was Sherlock meant to know that? John still made him sleep on the couch (he wouldn’t kiss an ashtray), not that he slept much anyway....
After the police had arrived and they had assured Lestrade that they would return to produce a statement, they had still been high on the adrenalin of the evening. They had headed out into London, bought fish and chips and ended up wondering around aimlessly.
“You said she meant the most to you.” Sherlock tried to speak, but John wouldn’t let him get a word in. “And if that’s the case Sherlock, you should grab it with both hands.” His voice had a frayed, emotional edge to them.
"Hey, it's ok. Calm down," Joan said softly, trying to reassure her. She wasn't sure if Sophia had the strength to hold the child anymore so she gently took the sleeping baby into her own arms.
He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. He couldn't make sense of his own actions around her. It was as if his body wouldn't obey his mind when she was there. Vampires were supposed to take human lives, not save them... and yet he'd saved hers and had revealed his own secret in the progress; the most reckless and unthinkable thing for a vampire to do.
He looked down, trying to gather his thoughts; "I did what I had to do… no, what I COULD do, to make him stop. I didn't have time to think it though."
"They know I'm their superior in the field of solving crimes. I've spent my life studying and practicing it."
"Your attacker would have killed you. I had to stop him. And you've met Venenum now. You've seen how stubborn and dangerous they are."
"But-" Before she could react or say anything, he was gone; and had locked the front door on the outside.
"It only makes sense that I find out all I can about the vampire who's keeping me in his flat. Don't you think so?"
Sherlock was surprised to hear this but he soon deduced that she must have seen vampires lending their companions to each other at the bar. With a nod, he added the condition to the contract.
"Do you really think I'm gonna tell you anything about that? Come on, you must be smarter than this if your reputation is anything to go by," he smirked.
"You told my attacker that I'm your companion to scare him off. You'd revealed your secret to save me and you kidnapped me so that I wouldn't get either of us killed because of what I'd seen. Then you told Venenum I'm your companion. None of that adds up to what you just said."
"The population of vampires is pretty small. Quite a few will be in that bar so I rely on the balance of probability here. A human couldn't have killed a vampire, let alone two. I think the murderer likes to make a scene. That's the frailty of genius, Joan-  it needs an audience."
There was a heavy silence lingering between them for a long moment. "Fine. Why did you lie to my attacker that I'm your companion? Why did you help me at the risk of revealing your own identity? Your big secret?" She dared to look him in the eyes this time.
A muffled scream was what eventually pulled the brakes at the chain of his thoughts. He'd heard such screams enough times before to instantly recognise them; beyond a doubt, this shriek of sheer horror belonged to a human who'd fallen victim to a vampire's thirst. *'Ignore it and walk away!'* he mentally pinched himself, but his body refused to obey his mind's commands. Instead, he turned towards the direction of the scream and momentarily froze with the shock of the scene in front of him.
Joan on the other hand, thinks she's crossed some invisible boundary and misinterpreted Sherlock's withdrawal as his reluctance to speak to her anymore.
"Look, I'm the only one around here who's putting any effort into seeing this case from your perspective, the only one trying to help you. Talking to me will be in your benefit."
It's a miracle, my head spins just trying to wrap itself around the fact that Sherlock Holmes (of all people) is in love with me.
He himself hated humans; to him, humans made guns and started wars and killed one another in order to become the sole ruler of the world and to gain immeasurable power, except that they were all too dumb to rule it properly, and yet they'd rather die than to surrender to their own failure and simply accept it. They've done nothing but destroy this planet for centuries. He found them egotistical, unjust and even... ruthless. Not that he thought of himself any better than these said adjectives, but his savagery was merely a biological feature whereas humans choose violence willingly. Maybe that was the only reason as to why mother nature had accepted vampires as a part of itself (top of the food chain, actually). It had always seemed ridiculous to Sherlock that nature had even allowed vampires to exist to begin with, until it occurred to him that maybe nature was punishing humans and seeking justice for all the crimes they had committed against it for centuries by accepting vampires as a part of itself.
A few minutes later Sophia Miller arrived at 221B Baker street. She was of average height, with long brown hair and brown eyes. She couldn't have been more than thirty years old. Joan thought that the woman didn't seem like someone who was mourning a loved one but rather like a person who would prefer death over to the pains they've been through.
This was the first time she'd set foot into Sherlock's bedroom. Although it was out of necessity, it still felt like invading his privacy. A double bed, a nightstand, a closet and a drawer were all the furniture in the room to be seen. But there was a lot of stuff in it. A lot of his stuff were scientific things i.e; a periodic table on the wall and a few insect boards, a microscope and what else. Others were artistic; like a few paintings, a few old records and violin bows but a few luxurious and antique pieces could be seen as well, like old statues and expensive curtains and his bedding.
Silence fell over the flat for a short while before he replied,"Fine. If this is what's necessary to put your mind at ease, so be it." She would be the making of Sherlock, or make him worse than ever, Mycroft wasn't yet sure which one it would be.
He shakes his head. "I'd do it all over again. It was my choice. No matter what, in the end, we're both alive, here in Baker Street because of it. So nothing else matters."
"Yesterday I had a bad feeling... like something terrible might happen to you.  12 hours later, you collapsed. I told Mycroft...  I was just thinking out loud. I didn't think it was anything important. But he told me you and I have a bond. I don't know why you didn't tell me about those before and honestly? Right now, I can't be bothered to care but based on what your brother said, I think we ARE 100 percent sure about this."
He finally turned around after setting the glass down and their eyes met. "You're practically vibrating with questions."
His hands take mine. "I'm rude, obnoxious and arrogant," I chuckle and he smiles, "but do you really think I destroy criminal webs for just anyone?"
"He knew everything about Benjamin, said he wanted payback for something personal and he could help me get my own payback. I don't know how he found me, but he asked me for help and he knew I disliked Benjamin. He told me to find Benjamin's place, watch it and report back to him."
"Yes, idiots. If they're not always the same thing, then what's the point in beauty?" He put the violin and the bow down in the case, then sipped a few drops from a glass which was next to him on a study table; the glass was filled with... blood!  Joan’s stomach was made of steel by necessity due to her job but just seeing that glass filled with blood made her feel sick so she was forced to tear her eyes away to avoid throwing up.
"You..." he heard the girl murmur and turned around. The fear on her face washed away all the anger he'd been feeling. She backed away a few trembling steps from him, shaking her head. The horror of being attacked combined with the shock of witnessing a vampire's true face had shattered her nerves and she passed out almost immediately. Sherlock's instincts barely had enough time to act as he caught her in his arms to stop her from falling to the ground and hitting her head on cement.
"Yes, I'm alright," He nodded as he straightened up and rubbed his eyes, "I just... I better go and wash up."
"Yes! I felt so low, so alone after you left me that I attempted to kill myself and the baby I was carrying," she said with a sad tone. Sherlock remained silent, not knowing what to say. Jackson's expression spoke plenty; shock, sadness and pain all at once. "You know who stopped me? Who gave me shelter when I had no one else to go to? Who was by my side while I was in labour? Who willingly did everything a dad is supposed to do for my baby while you… her biological father were neglecting your duties to her? Who stopped her from crying the nights I was too exhausted to do it? It was Benjamin. I wanted it to be you, I desperately wanted… no, I NEEDED you by my side, I really did but you were gone and you didn't look back, not even once."
John was having more and more memories filtering through and maybe it was his mind playing tricks, but they felt real and it made Sherlock and him and Sherlock feel real.
Sherlock hadn’t known what to say to that. They had eventually come to a charged silence, which was broken when John had thrown his mug across the room. The sound of the ceramic smashing against Baker Street’s walls, releasing the tension that had built up.
“I can see where your mind is going detective.” John giggled, but he wasn’t laughing at him – it was a shared joy, a shared secret. He had learned this was usual in relationships, to laugh with each other, to have things only you know about – he had looked that up too.
“You know I couldn’t show any of it to you....show what I was really feeling. I had to play the part. If you had doubted it, the game would have been up and you would have been dead.” He paused and stared up at John “But Molly sIipped under Jim’s radar, which is ironic, as she was the person who meant the most.”
“Fine. Fine, you win. But believe me, the moment you neglect that animal I will never make you tea again, and I will tell Mrs. Hudson that she must never bake her scones for you again.” John Watson was pretty sure his flatmate was secretly smiling at him, but oh well. There are worse things than having Sherlock Holmes being amused by you. He just hoped that Plato would not crap on their carpet.
“Sherlock are you...alright?", that was the best he came up with because seriously, he had never seen Sherlock fail one of his tasks. “He wanted...wants to play. I don't know how he has so much energy at this time.” Sherlock didn't look like he had much sleep last night, so the little guy probably had been awake for quite some hours.
“I know Sherlock, it was quite an intense situation” John conceded “But we still need to talk about what you said.”
His ‘forced’ confession. He had forgiven Sherlock and the detective had ended up making a joke of it. Of course he had – what else had John expected? Tears, hugs and an outpouring of emotions? Had he forgotten who Sherlock Holmes was?
“Sorry my sofa isn’t the best” Lestrade offered, as he handed John a mug “And I made you a coffee, thought you might need it.”
She didn’t just want to kill John (as of course that was her ultimate goal), she wanted Sherlock to suffer along the way. She wanted him to know that this was for James and that he was still playing the game beyond the grave.
Seducing John had no longer been possible, there had been no way he would be tempted away from Sherlock then – especially once they adopted that brat into their lives.
There was a long pause as Lestrade digested the doctor’s words. “I guess sometimes life doesn’t go the way you expect it to.”
For the past few months the detective had not been himself. When he had first met John he had been a show off, deducing John almost to a tee and ‘curing’ his limp. He couldn’t do that this time round and he didn’t know how to interact with someone without offending them. So he had been being....polite and attentive. That’s how ‘normal’ people act right? The detective was finding it exhausting and he felt like he had to watch everything he was doing or saying. John seemed distant and Sherlock had let him be, as he must be doing it wrong and he didn’t know how to make it right. Now the gaping hole between them was growing day after day and he didn’t know what to do. So here he was hiding in the morgue and bouncing a ball.
Another sound came from above them. “Some one is still here.” John whispered and next thing they knew a woman was running down the stairs of the house and out the landing window on to a garage underneath. “HEY! Stop!” John shouted before running after her through the broken window.
“Performance?” Sherlock asked, incredulous “Do you think this is an act? That I want to be this.....emotional?”
Sherlock’s mind started whirring at this and kicked into detective mode. There was clearly something bigger going on here. Who was Mary Morstan? Sherlock had deliberately held back in deducing her – he hadn’t wanted to know. He cursed himself now for his emotions getting in the way. Especially as John was at risk – why would Mary want to kill him? Why then seduce him? Pull him away from his family?
John’s brain stuttered. On one hand that would be bloody brilliant, but on the other she wasn’t the one who had inspired his current condition and it felt wrong to share it with her. “Err no thanks got an early shift at the hospital tomorrow.” Her disappointment was clear. “I’ll- err -just go the bathroom. You try to get back to sleep.” He stumbled out of bed and found his way to the nearby bathroom.
Her first plan had been to seduce John while Sherlock had been ‘dead'. She had known he would come back to him as soon as Moriarty's minions had been defeated.
“God, you are the most infuriating man!” John finally managed to get his words out. “If you had just listened to me the first time or at least try again a second time-“
Finn’s eyes were burning a hole into the back of John’s head, he could feel them. Years of being a parent had taught him that particular skill. Funny how a child could teach him more than the army ever could.
So this is where our story begins, set about 2 years before the prologue and what I will class as the present day. I don't know anything about medical terms, so I have just kept things simple. Thank you for the kudos and comments - hope you enjoy! I have included warnings at the end of the chapter.
Having John by his side had allowed his inspiration to flow. He had felt like he was on fire and before he knew it he had been in a train carriage with another bomb. For a few desperate moments he had thought that it was really over, that it had all been for nought and it would end there for both of them.
Sherlock snorted “You might as well get on your knees Lestrade if you are going to beg” he was dishevelled and sounded worn out. He spun round to face the DI, as if struck by inspiration. “-or do you only do that for Mycroft?” he sneered.
John had been angry at him for giving in to his habit, despite secretly being amused by his reaction.
“Mr Holmes – it does sound like an interesting job – what’s it like?” Rachel asked, obviously trying to diffuse the situation.
He doesn’t remember much of what happened after the door slammed, just crumbling to the floor and being woken hours (days?) later by a concerned Finn. It had been tough going.....adjusting to being Sherlock Holmes without John Watson. He had lived for decades without the other man, it couldn’t be that hard right? They would still be friends, so it wasn’t like he was completely losing his husband. He had promised John that they would always be friends, even if only one of them remembered that promise.
“I loved him and I literally fell. There was something I could do to keep him safe. I had put him in danger and I fixed it. I stopped the threat. This time-“ His voice broke at this point and the wind moved through his curls, as he put his hand without the lit cigarette over his mouth. As if to try to stop the words from coming out. “I put him-I put him in danger again, it’s my fault. I don’t know what it feels like to hit concrete at speed, but it’s got to feel better than this.”
Greg laughed “I doubt it somehow.” John blushed and looked down into his pint. Lestrade raised his own pint and said “Congratulations – Sherlock is a lucky man.”
Molly laughed and pulled away from her grip on Sherlock. “See that’s what I am talking about, be obnoxious like that with John and you might get somewhere.”
Another update, sorry for the slow progress, but I am hopeful I will get to the end soon. This chapter is anothe flashback to the past and does have changing POVs and jumps in the timeline, hopefully not too confusing. Also I wanted to say that I know in the real world it would be very unlikely that Sherlock and John would be able to foster/adopt a child and the process would not be as straightforward as I have made it sound. I have used Mycroft to get around that and a bit of artistic licence!
John snorted and laughed in disbelief, standing up and pacing away from the coffee table. The reaction stung. “Of course Sherlock it’s just that easy.” He responded sarcastically. He took a deep breath “What you told me last night was horrific and I hate that you went through that for me. I hate that I didn’t know that you were going through that. That bloody Mycroft and Molly perfect Hooper knew and didn’t do a pigging thing about it. That they let you fake your death to save my life.” He air quoted at those last words and turned to look at Sherlock again. “But you weren’t here Sherlock, you don’t what I went through. You don’t know how close I came to becoming the man I was before I met you...” John looked at his feet again, before staring Sherlock dead in the eye. “...The man who regularly eyed the gun in his drawer.”
“That’s why Mycroft goaded him to call me...he’s trying to make Dad feel and accept what’s happening.” Finn thought aloud.
If only it would sooth the pain of the betrayal he was feeling too. The lies and deceit that apparently John wasn’t worthy of being privy too.
John had been speechless. He didn’t really agree fully with Mary, was he ready for this? Her face had been full of anticipation and John had felt the pressure of her expectations. His brain stuttered to a halt and he had heard himself say “Ok".
“Finn-“ How did he word this delicately? “Please keep this information between us. No Dad, no Uncle Mycroft. I can’t give your father hope, Christ I don’t want to give myself hope. This could be it. This could be all that I remember.”
“Hey – are you ok?” The words broke his melancholy thoughts and Sherlock could feel the current John’s presence behind him. A hand reached his shoulder and squeezed it in comfort. “I woke up and you weren’t in bed. Are you in your mind castle again?”
Maybe if he saw this side of Sherlock things would start clicking into place and maybe the other man would stop being so scared around him. So he had approached Sherlock and asked him if he could join him on a case, which had lead them to this moment, with Sherlock prancing around a corpse.
So she had got a job at the hospital and had ‘accidentally’ bumped into John with her coffee. It had been easy after that – his vulnerability had made him very easy to manipulate. Honestly she had no idea what Sherlock saw in him. She had been bored after a few hours, let alone the months they had been together, but the pain on Sherlock’s face every time she saw him was worth it.
“Come on Sherlock it’s not that big of a deal.” John broke through his melancholy thoughts, as he brought him a cup of tea over and joined him at the table.
The evening that followed had seen them riding on the highs of their success, the thrill of the case and for Sherlock the thrill of forgiveness.
Finn’s expression was pained. “You know Pops is never happier than when he is by your side. He would be berating you for blaming yourself.” Finn put on a fairly bad impersonation of his father’s voice “You know not everything is always about you Sherlock Holmes.”
The taller man pulled away and moved his mouth to John’s ear. “Of course there are some things I don’t know about you that I am very interested in finding out about.”
Sherlock’s face remained impassive and emotionless, but John could tell that his anger had affected the other man. “No of course she didn’t John, she worked for Moriarty. Why would you think that?”
Of course he was attracted to John, but he had not expected this...comfort, this security.  He shouldn’t have expected anything less from John, he had always been tactile with his girlfriends and those he cared about. He had witnessed Sherlock’s doubts and had soothed him with reassuring words, but now.....now he was physically reaffirming this by holding him. This was a new dynamic that was now open to them after their declarations. Maybe John needed this too. Had he thought of this during his death? Did he crave it as much as Sherlock was realising he did? He can’t remember the last time he had been held like this, most probably by one of his parents when he was a child.
And now he had had a highly emotional outburst in front of a man who considers his body transport and loathes sentiment. Who was currently acting unusually unsure. John could tell he wasn’t in his mind palace. He didn’t know what to do with his hands and his whole body was fidgeting. It seemed that for once the great detective didn’t know what to do or say.
John shook his head “Like I said, just moments. A lot of it is mangled and woven in to my other thoughts and memories. It was only when you highlighted it that the memory fully came back.”
John’s heart both broke and swelled at those words. He looked over to Sherlock for help, who looked as overwhelmed as he felt. This is what John could bring to the table, he thought, he could field the emotional hurdles they would likely face. Despite his detective’s brilliance, he was still learning how to deal with human emotion in all it’s forms. Swallowing down the nerves in his throat he replied. “If you want it to be.”
The detective took his silence as admission. “What would dear Mary think of her new, reliable boyfriend getting jealous of Sherlock Holmes? Are you sure you are ready for a new relationship John, when you clearly still have strong emotions surrounding your husband?”
I have had this written for a while, but have only just managed to post it. Warnings at the end of the chapter.
Finn didn’t want to think that his Dad would turn to drugs, he had never seen it himself, but he knew enough to know it was a possibility. “Whatever happens I won’t let there be an alternative. I promise.” He vowed.
There was another silence from their young charge, before finally he heard a whispered. “I love you both two Dad.”
So we are flashing back to the past again in this chapter, hopefully to get a bit of background on their relationship. Also I appreciate that when gay marriage was actually legalised in the UK might not fit in with the time line of this fic, so I am using a bit of artistic license with that.
They stared at each other, both trying to hold their anger in. At length they both started to come back into the room and slowly John began to realise how irresponsible and how childish their behaviour had been. He turned to Finn and Rachel only to discover that they had both gone, leaving their dinner untouched. “Piggin hell.” He said aloud.
John seemed to come out of the fog of his memory at that “Now hang on a minute that’s not fair – don’t say stuff like that in front of our son and his girlfriend, who by the way we are meant to be making a good impression on.”
“Yes alright Sherlock” John interrupted as a small giggle escaped him, followed by a quick kiss to the detective’s lips “Despite how well I know your body, it’s still a bit unusual to greet someone in the nude when they come over to see you.”
So yes raising a child was challenging and despite all the warnings and preparations, it was still taking him by surprise. He was currently lying in bed thinking of all this, John snoozing beside him, when he heard a loud scream from Finn’s bedroom.
He heard Finn hum in agreement. “Pops told you what he told me about love all those years ago? I’m surprised you remember.”
He closed his eyes in frustration, he needed to get out of his own head, he needed to sleep. He wanted someone to hold him and just tell him it was going to be ok, even if it wasn’t.
“No?” John looked confused and went to stand in the circle he had left clear. “Well it certainly looks romantic to me. Not something that does it for me particularly, but I bet there are plenty of people out there who would love it. Certainly some of my past girlfriends would be blown away by it....but if it’s not for an experiment, what is it for?”
He could vaguely hear Lestrade shouting his name urgently behind him, but he paid him no attention. He had finally reached his destination.
The reality in the cold light of the morning was slightly different, but still.....hopeful and John was determined to make something of it.
The other man blushed. “I see how ridiculous it seems now, but I do feel it. Of course I know you would never be unfaithful, but you could fall out of lust with me. I mean you practically had the same suspicion when I tried to propose......I guess I got frustrated that it was ok for you to feel it, but it was ridiculous if I did.”
Eventually he turned back to the window, lit another cigarette and watched John’s lonely figure disappear into the mist.
“Yeah it was good, I just wish I didn’t have to go through all this ‘paperwork’ you know. I wanna be helping people now.” Finn replied, as well as ordering a sugary coffee with the waiter.
She didn’t believe in anything as ridiculous as love at first sight, but the man had become her world the moment she had met him. And she could offer her skills to him, she could do his bidding. She could be everything he needed.
It was only when he had been standing on a roof that he realised that he was completely in love with him.
John seemed surprised at the change in tone, but sighed and said “I know.” He looked down into his mug and fiddled with the handle.
Before he could continue his thoughts or in fact try to verbalise them, John’s emotionally broken voice interrupted him “I’m so sorry.”
We are back in the present with this one. Thank you for those who are still reading, it means a lot.
John nodded “That sounds like me” he coughed, put his tea to the side and stood up. “I imagine you have been in a bit of a living nightmare since I woke up?”
He pulled John to him in a strong embrace. “I won’t, I promise.” He kissed his forehead. “I promise.”
He had lived his life by that motto for so long and then one day he had looked up from his microscope in this very hospital.....
Sherlock reeled in shock “You couldn’t have led with that?” his voice furious, despite the low tones. “He’s stable?” he asked more calmly.
John didn’t remember him. He didn’t remember their love, their cases, their adventures, their son....their life.
John’s train of thought stuttered, as the words filtered through to his brain. To be honest the train crashed and burned. His heart started to break, he could feel the parts of it falling into the pit of his stomach. He finally found his voice, “You and she then...you er...like her?”
“Well I thought so too for a while.” John frowned at this, but Sherlock’s feelings were all coming out now and starting to take over him. All he could focus on was the hot, white rage that was suddenly making itself known. “But have you though or are you just looking for a good shag and a cosy home?”
Right now her face was pale as she walked towards him, her expression worried. She released the arms that were wrapped around herself to pull him into a hug.
“You did and do, but you also work in the ER and were on shift for a lot of this case, plus for part of it Dad went undercover as a drug addict and didn’t tell you.”
It had been 9 months since he had left Baker Street and he had been flailing about ever since. He had found a bedsit and lived there for a while, seeing Finn frequently and Sherlock scarcely. That’s when the dreams had started, first about a gun in a drawer and a lonely life. He had wondered if they were memories, but had kept them to himself.
Sherlock had had his fair few nightmares about that, but “Not this time” he confirmed. He moved over through to the living room and motioned John to sit in his own chair (the doctor had not made that mistake again). “No this dream was a memory from my time when I was dead.” In the weeks that John had been at Baker Street, most of the big moments of their lives had been regaled to him by himself and Finn mostly. Him faking his death had been a bit difficult for John to comprehend to say the least, which wasn’t a shock as it hadn’t exactly gone down well the first time. He picked up his violin and stood by the rain splattered window. “I was sleeping rough and there had been this almighty storm. I was caught out in it and found this abandoned barn for shelter. Its structure was questionable, but it was better than being out in the storm. I got inside and wedged myself in the corner. I was so cold and it felt like I would never be warm again, never escape the storm.” He looked at John, who was listening attentively. “I thought of you and how I wanted you there with me.”
He looked expectantly at John, but Sherlock could not control himself. “Your father has remembered!”
Since then things had almost got back to normal, well Sherlock and John normal. The detective was just glad that their names were being said in the same sentence again.
John swallowed and his hands firmly gripped him hard. “Yes” he whispered. Sherlock kissed him firmly, before taking his hand and leading him towards his bedroom.
The doctor finished the sandwiches and brought them over to the table, before he joined his son to eat. He took a bite of his sandwich, as he watched Finn play with his food. “Do you want to tell me why you have been boring holes into the back of my head since I got home?” At the young boy’s silence he prodded “Is something up son?...Whatever trouble you have got yourself into we can help you, we can sort it.” Finn still didn’t say anything and wouldn’t even look at John now. “I could always give your Uncle Mycroft a call, find out what you have been up to.”
“Yeah well maybe he should have. Maybe I am able to say what he really thought now that all the sentimentality and the history is out of the way.” The words were said with such confidence and conviction and there was a smug look on the doctor's face.
Sherlock breathed him in. Finn was alive and in his arms, he would keep him tethered to reality. He was his only real connection to John and whatever happened they would remain a family. The smell of perfume started to permeate his senses and he noticed a black hair on the younger man’s beige jacket. A stark contrast to Finn’s dirty blond mop.
Sherlock wouldn’t remember much of what happened next. Of the killer disappearing into the crowd, of the shocked screams and exclaimed words of the people around, of the inhumane noise that was ripped from his throat at the sight before him, of the pale face of the driver, shaking all over as she left her car to see the carnage she had caused.
He bustled through the door, the bell tinkling and Finn dripping water everywhere. He caught sight of John and beamed “Pops!” He walked over to join his Dad at the table “I’d give you a hug, but I’m sopping wet.”
He pulled his hands away and sighed. Molly was staring up at him with a sad smile on her face. “I am here for you Sherlock, just like I was for the fall. I might not see you as well as John.....did and I might not be ‘hopelessly in love with you’ anymore, but I do love you Sherlock and I want to be here for you if you need me.”
Mary had been inconsolable, heartbroken.....suicidal. What had she to live for? Part of her had wanted to give up, give in and never look back, but she loved James too much for that. She would never give up on him, no matter what he had said or done. She would prove once again that she was worthy of him, prove that Sherlock Holmes was not worthy.
“You” John looked down at Sherlock’s raised eyebrow “Jumping around like your shoes were on fire because of that dog.”
And then there was Sherlock, who he was tentatively becoming friends with again. He....missed the other man, even though they had only spent a short time together, the detective had got under his skin. And then he was still getting  the odd moments of memories....or what he thought were memories – what else could they be? They would hit him at odd points in the day and sometimes smother him in his dreams at night. John had only been able to catch whispers of them, before he would lose grasp of them all together. He had been keeping this information to himself (except the one Finn had caught him out on that day at the park), but he had started to write them down. He was perhaps getting too hopeful about them, but he wanted to put the pieces back together of the jigsaw of his life. The memories were almost providing him with these pieces, but he didn’t have the picture on the box to work from and he almost felt as lost as ever.
Finn was asleep in what looked like a very uncomfortable position in one of the ghastly waiting room chairs. They had spent a while up on the roof, mainly in a thoughtless silence. He didn’t think either of them had had many words, Sherlock had had none. He had managed to get his son to open up about his new girlfriend, although he had deleted the details now. Finn would have to tell John everything again anyway, if he woke up.
Sherlock eyes widened, as if he realised what he had just said. “In life generally....no. In this....yes?” He finished, as if he wasn’t sure himself.
Raising a child was....challenging. Sherlock had read all the books he could get his hands on and they all said it would be. He had also read all the leaflets that the adoption company had sent through and attended all the meetings, interviews and counselling sessions, both mandatory and recommended. All of them indicated that it wasn’t going to be a walk in the park, especially when adopting an older child, with a difficult upbringing and distinct memories of it.
Sherlock was stunned by the outburst and felt his own rage bubbling up in reaction. He stood himself and gripped the toilet rolls, he had spent the last God knows how long staring at. “I don’t know, I haven’t heard his voice for nearly two weeks. I don’t know what to do, what to say, how to act properly. I don’t know how to comfort you or how to make it all go away!”
John nodded “Thank you. I am very lucky to have you. I must have been a wonderful man to deserve you both.”
Sherlock grinned and grabbed John round the waist, pulling their bodies together. His breath was hot against his ear as he whispered, “Oh my dear Watson, who said we are going to need a bed.” John then found himself yanked in the air and thrown on the kitchen table (he would never admit to the surprised yelp he made in the process).
Molly had been giving him body parts to analyse out of pity. The morgue was only a couple of staircases away from the ICU and John’s room. Sherlock was comfortable with that distance and usually ventured down there to give Finn sometime alone with his father. He had finally convinced him to get back to Uni and Finn usually came back to the hospital after classes, keeping vigil with his books and essays. His time in the morgue with Molly was helping him focus his mind and keeping away his itch for a fix, although his resolve was fading.
Sherlock actually made a sobbing noise at this and clamped his hand over his mouth, as he was full on crying at this point. Finn had never told them that he loved them and had never called either of them Dad. Although both of them considered the boy their son, they didn’t want to ever put the pressure on Finn to define them in that way.
She had become part of his network, earned his trust and she believed she had gained his admiration. She would have done anything for the man and she had spent every day trying to prove her worthiness to him.
John hadn’t been a player in this particular game, just a pawn used by Moriarty to get what he wanted from Sherlock.
“Do you think I know what to say?” He continued more gently. “What do I say to a man who’s partner doesn’t remember who he is? Who’s lives have been so intertwined for so long that anybody who knows them couldn’t imagine them any other way?” He turned back to look at Sherlock. “I’m just as lost, confused and hurt as you Dad. You don’t have to say anything; we are in the same boat. We are lost in the storm, but we have an oar each and we can get through it together.” He looked at Sherlock then. “No more negativity.” He clarified.
Adjusting to having Finn in their life, in his life, had been the biggest challenge he had ever faced, his most difficult case, his most emotionally compromising situation. He had had moments where he didn’t know if they would get through it, but he had never doubted it would be worth it and he would never give up on Finn, on John or most surprisingly on himself.
"I know your instinct is to get these humans out of here as soon as possible, but you honestly can't do anything about it," Sherlock said as he looked at her, his voice barely audible due to the loud music.
She looked up at him, hoping to make him see the situation from her perspective somehow. "I won't stop, Sherlock. You can't lock me up in a flat and expect me to do nothing. I am not a slave or a hostage. So you either have to let me go or kill me. I'm not going to apologise for wanting to be free."
"That's sweet of you, doctor; it really is. But I don't need your help. In fact, It's probably the other way around. I think you're the one who's in need of my help."
"I sure hope so, Mr Holmes," She said and got up. "I'll have to leave now, I'm afraid but please contact me if you have more questions or if you had any news for me."
He knew Venenum would never contact someone if the matter at hand wasn't extremely serious and urgent. Venerum used modern technology, in fact they enjoyed it but even in that, they were very secretive and knew exactly how to conceal themselves and not to leave any traces behind. They used code words in their messages and had many other ways of protecting themselves even against modern technology.
"I simply want to give you a word of warning. What you've just done - I'm afraid it might not end very well."
An idea crossed her mind like a lightning and suddenly she started looking around for her handbag; for her phone to be more precise, to call for help.
"That doesn't matter to Sebastian. So far, he had been killing vampires for some unknown reason. But now things have changed. Getting whatever this is was so important that he doesn't care if he dies for it."
"Yes. And we don't know what this poison is, who's killing vampires, or even why." Sherlock was frustrated, he hated not knowing.
He scoffed and waved her off. "The Scotland yard is full of morons. Fortunately Lestrade isn't one of them. He's at least tolerable and not entirely an idiot. He can understand things if I go a bit slow and he knows that he's in need of my advice far more than I need the distraction of his cases. London would be much more of a dangerous place if Lestrade was as idiotic as the people who work for him."
"Make sure no harm will come to her through me. If I'm unable to protect her at any point, I want to know that you will keep her safe above all else, no matter what."
*'Because I can't bear seeing you sick again,'* she corrected inside her own head but nodded to him."The way I see it, you're the only one who has a shot against him."
She opened it and found a necklace with a blue/green gemstone in the middle. "But this is antique and so valuable. It must be very expensive and precious."
She could see the question in his eyes and shook her head. "I'm fine. It only stings a little, I promise."
Oleander tilted his head to one side as a sign of disappointment for being underestimated. "Sherlock, you are unique in your mental powers, beyond the shadow of a doubt but we're not blind, nor stupid," he looked at his friends who silently agreed.
John jumped up and stomped to the other side of the room, slamming his untouched tea on the mantle place. “A year too bloody late.”
Then he had found drugs and with them the realisation that his body could get him what he wanted, what he really desired and he exchanged sexual favours for a hit. It was a means to an end for him and he doesn’t remember overly enjoying the experience, but then he doesn’t remember much from that period of his life. Except the exceptional high and peace that the drugs gave him.
The puppeteer of the British government had said that Sherlock (and subsequently his country) needed him for a case. Apparently that had been what John had needed to hear and for once he had done what Mycroft Holmes had wanted him to do.
Sherlock was completely stunned at what had just happened and must have been quiet for a long time, because John started to look worried again. “Yes” he finally managed to get out. “Yes of course yes.”
She was suddenly reminded of the bullet holes on the living room's wallpaper." Ah! I see. Of course. I should have known. Your brain is self destructive when there's nothing for it to work on."
Joan had been feeling off all day, as if something bad was about to happen but the day had gone along as normal as possible. With a glance at her phone’s clock which was laying on the nightstand, Joan decided to go downstairs and have a glass of water.
"I know and I never meant for you to find out. I ran away when you tried to call an ambulance so that you'd remain oblivious but our intentions don't change anything," a pause, "Now, your turn. Why do you want to know all this?"
"I want my bag returned to me. I want my stuff too as you insist on me living here and I want to be able to return to my job."
"That's too general, doctor. I have multiple situations all at once I'm afraid. You'll have to be a little more specific as to which one you're referring to."
"I am angry - no, I am furious but it doesn't mean that I will kill you. Although, I admit that I underestimated your desire to break free."
"It does. You've clearly done your homework, bravo. I'd clap for you but my hands are a little tied up right now," Sebastian grinned.
4: Each of them is obligated to be accessible through their phones. If not, they're supposed to get in touch as soon as possible.
"Look, I am content to be your companion but I think we need to set some boundaries. This has to be based on mutual trust. And I can't trust you on this matter if I can't have at least some extent of freedom."
"I can," a male voice replied, and everyone turned around to see Mycroft Holmes walk through the entrance of the hall. A relatively tall man dressed in an expensive grey suit, his dark hair combed to one side and his piercing black eyes set on Oleander. He wasn't thin or particularly muscular but there was an air of authority and power to him. He walked calmly with high confidence until he arrived to stand next to Sherlock; "As the representative of the British government, I asked my brother not to share what this information except with those who are present here at this moment."
"You haven't answered my question. I asked first. Plus, I thought you were clearing things up for ME."
"Why should I ever listen to you? You're a creepy stranger who's kidnapped me. I don't even know your name!"
"Venenum has guaranteed her protection as long as she doesn't reveal our secret but I don't trust them. If things go wrong, they may turn against us and try to hurt her or do something even worse. "
"Joan -you need to understand that in order to maintain peace, both humans and vampires sacrificed a lot. Vampires stopped killing humans, stopped feeding in public and stopped taking companions by force. And as you know, a few humans agreed to be companions. Every and each companion is here because they choose to be here. You can't change free will, no one can, not anymore."
Sherlock chuckled dryly; "Neither do I. So I'll get straight to the point then. First things first, you must know that some vampires keep human companions and there's a rule amongst us that prevents vampires from hurting one another's companions. I've been told that companions are considered as a sort of private property."
"Well if they did, we'll find something here, this must be why Sebastian was watching the house." He nodded at that and they resumed searching the flat until they found a hidden safe in the master bedroom. "Wait. I hadn't seen this safe before," Sophia said.
I met him on January 29th at Barts hospital. The memory is crystal clear in my mind. Mike introduced us in the lab and he was busy with an experiment when we walked in.
It was a typical early April evening in London; dark, cloudy and of course a bit chilly. Doctor Joan Watson walked out of the hospital that she works in. She had sandy hair, slightly tanned skin, a height of 170 centimetres with bright blue eyes. She was wearing a black top with black trousers and brown rust boots with a matching coat.
Joan spent the first few minutes of being alone in the flat searching for a way out. She'd started to feel the symptoms of coming down with a cold since she'd woken up in the morning but it was getting worse by the second and by now had become impossible to ignore. She kept searching for as long as she possibly could but she hadn't eaten anything since yesterday so she was getting physically weak and drained. The fridge had nothing but blood bags in it when she checked it and there wasn't any kind of human nutrition anywhere in the flat. Joan had never felt so desperate before. She was hungry, thirsty, sick, hurt and locked down in a vampire's flat. It would take a miracle for her to make it out of this place alive.
"The best strategy is often the truth itself. I think THIS is the real reason you're helping me. Come now, don't you ever ask yourself why you're still by his side? Don't you feel like a traitor when you go back to work, to being a doctor who saves lives after you've opened up your veins for a monster like him who takes them away? His darkness will consume your light. You hate it, but you don't run away because it's him; because he's different for you, isn't he?"
"About me." Sophia stepped into sight and stood next to Sherlock. Jackson was shocked but also pleased to see her.
Neither Mycroft nor Venenum were pleased with Joan's wish to speak to Sebastian for safety reasons but as she'd been told, a luxurious black Jaguar XKL took her to Sherrinford, which according to Mycroft, was a fortress built to keep the rest of the world safe from what's inside it, especially vicious vampires.
"He IS the british government when he's not too busy being the British Secret Services or the CIA on a freelance basis."
"One of the only five weapons on earth that can kill a vampire," he explained, "YOU had those weapons sealed away to guarantee the safety of our kind but my attacker had the knife. So evidently someone's got access to these weapons without your knowledge," he said in an accusing tone.
His mind raced uncontrollably, watching raindrops pour down on her face. Silver moonlight shone on the two of them as Sherlock held her unconscious figure.*"What am I to do now?"* he asked himself. He couldn't leave her alone out there in the rain especially after what had happened and his secret was already out now so there was only one thing that he COULD do;
"No. Not that. I mean, why would you help me? I kidnapped you, locked you up inside this flat. You almost killed yourself trying to get away from me. Why would you risk your life to save mine?"
Sherlock's eyes widened in surprise; why would a human save a vampire's life? Joan had already saved his life once and he had imprisoned her afterwards, why would she do it again?
"Yes. What's wrong with that?" He frowned in confusion. Why would she care? Why would this worry her?
Sherlock let himself in with his key but froze at the doorstep when he saw the state of the flat. Just one glance was enough to let him know everything that had happened in his fairly short absence; Joan had tried to break down the door, then she'd tried the windows which didn't do her any good; (Thanks to Mycroft's suspicious nature for that one. He probably thought Sherlock would punch them or something at one point and that therefore the windows needed to be strong enough to tolerate a vampire's strength.) After that, she'd tried to find her phone, and only once all of those had failed, she'd started trying to attract the attention of a passerby - down below, on Baker Street - by slapping on the window, and shouting.
He was overwhelmed, he didn't know what to do and having a mind like his certainly didn't help it. Joan was right and he knew it but still, something felt wrong about this whole thing. Tasting her blood was one of the most pleasing experiences in his entire life and there was no denying that but it was also one of the most terrifying ones. He had stopped this time but would he manage it if he feed on her again? Frankly, he wasn't unfamiliar with the picture, the vampire would crave blood more and more, their thirst never truly satisfied and the human would soon turn into a lifeless corpse. It would be the easiest thing in the world for a vampire to get lost in their thirst for blood, carried away by their constant desire for more blood...
