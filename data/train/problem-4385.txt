Castiel chuckled, and Dean smiled. "C'mon." He took Castiel's hand and stood up. Castiel stared at their hands. Dean had done it so casually. Their fingers weren't interlocked, but it was still such an intimate gesture, especially for Dean, and yet he was just standing there like it was perfectly normal, like he had done it a thousand times. And though Castiel didn't want to get his hopes up, a part of him wondered if just like he had, Dean had imagined it a thousand times, and that's what had made it so easy for him to do.
Rowena’s haughty demeanor softened slightly at his words. This seemed to happen often with Jack – he drew out a very human, almost tender side of Rowena, and she didn’t quite seem to know what to do with his warmth, his sincerity. “Yes, well,” she said. “Thank you, dear.”
And yet I admired certain things about him. His devotion to his brother, for example, was something I understood through my devotion to heaven (and respected deeply). He questioned my motives and demanded information, and although it certainly made my job more difficult, it also demonstrated intelligence and thoroughness. When he urged me to utilize free will, I could tell it was not only for his own benefit — he could see my true nature, crushed beneath thousands of years of obedience. I had freed him from his chains, and it was time for him to release me from mine.
“You’re… You’re my everything too, Cas. I mean, you and Sammy. So if you had that dream because you thought I’d go looking for something else, it’s not gonna happen. For the first time in a long time, I feel like… I’m not really missing anything. I know I got a lot of shit buried deep down, and I can’t expect anything to fix that. But if there’s anything that could, it’s you.”
“I don’t know. It just feels worse to me when he pulls shit like this. I guess I feel like I’m supposed to be important to him, you know?” When Sam didn’t respond quickly enough, Dean seemed to rethink his words. “Never mind. That’s stupid. He has a whole heaven full of angel-douches to worry about.”
He tried not to let it hurt his feelings; he knew that Dean had some issues with overcompensation and probably just wasn't ready to address the shift in energy between them. But however logical that explanation was, Castiel's newly entirely human body made it impossible to keep other, more emotion-based explanations from drifting into the realm of possibility. Without his grace, he could no longer regulate his psychological processes, and that left him vulnerable to emotional fluctuations he wasn't yet equipped to cope with.
Cas doesn’t need to sleep, and only chooses to do so when he’s with Dean. He’s even had dreams before, though he says it ‘takes practice,’ like how humans can learn to lucid dream. It’s also taken practice for him to be able to sleep through the night, and sometimes he can only manage a few hours. In those cases, he usually reads a book, or watches Netflix on Dean’s laptop with headphones in. Sometimes, though, Dean opens his eyes to find Cas just looking at him. Watching over him, as Cas used to say. As much as Dean tells him it’s creepy (and it is, a little), he also secretly thinks it’s sweet — chick-flick levels of sweet, which he certainly never expected to experience in his horror movie of a life.
“I know, I know. I’m just saying you need to take it easy. Let the rest of us handle this. I’ll call Dean, and then I’ll check the web for… what, demon flu?”
"Yeah," Dean replied. "We can have waffles. Maybe Sammy will share his blueberries so we can put them in the batter. Have you had blueberry waffles yet?"
He had been planning to tell Sam himself, eventually, but never quite found the right moment. Sam was the one to bring it up one night, as they were driving home from a job. Dean thought he had a lot of nerve to do that while they were in an enclosed space, let alone in a moving vehicle – if it had been during the aforementioned active denial phase, Dean probably would’ve crashed the car and killed them both.
Sam was glad it hadn’t. He had plenty of reasons to believe that Cas, good intentions aside, would continue to disappoint Dean in ways that could never be repaired, in ways that echoed the disappointment they felt about their own father. Dean had been neglected and abandoned too many times already. Sam knew it must have torn him apart to be discarded once again, pushed aside for the constant war that was waging around him. But Dean would never let them see his pain, so he locked himself away to drink once again. Sam’s heart ached for his brother, who had followed their father’s demand for apathy so dutifully that he now had repression down to an art form. Dean was raised to approach emotion as an enemy, even if it meant destroying himself in the process.
Cas, glad for the change of topic, held out his hand. Charlie shook it with a grin. “Yes,” he said, “I’ve heard a lot about you as well. Dean and Sam speak very highly of you.”
“Feel like showering?” Cas asks. “Or would you rather I just...” His hand hovers over Dean’s knee, waiting for permission.
Did everything have to be about something else? Dean clenched his jaw. “Just let me sleep in the damn car, Cas.”
“That kid Kevin that was staying here? Dean told me he’s back with his mom. Because even though you could use his help right now, you didn’t want to drag him into this any more than you already did. You wanted him and his mom to stay safe. That doesn’t sound like you’re a bad person to me.”
“Sure, Cas, if that would make you happy.” Dean smiled, though he inwardly flinched at the thought of walking into a liquor store or a diner holding hands with a dude.
Dean snatched his keys from the counter and stormed up the stairs to the door. He slammed it behind him.
Dean laughs, though his heart flutters from the thought of Cas working (that term used loosely, but still) just to afford something for him. “Shoulda let me teach you. You’d be a lot better.”
Jack seemed unconvinced. “What about Michael?” he said, jerking his head toward Dean. “Take some from him.”
“I’m in a lot of fucking pain, so if we could hurry this up…” It comes out harsher than she intends.
“Well...” Dean says to Cas. He keeps his voice low, and aims for a smoldering look. “Looks like you got me alone.”
When Jack returned with the holy oil, Cas made a wide circle around Dean. Sam entered the room. “Garth is secure,” he said. “And he should stay down for at least a few hours.” He looked down at the ring of holy oil and pulled a lighter out of his pocket. “We good?” Sam waited for Cas and Jack to nod before flicking the lighter open. “Everyone step back.”
“Alright, so tomorrow we go back to the bar, and the victims' families again if we have to, and find out who has something of Nick’s lying around. Then we burn it, and Nick gets to rest. And we can get back to Sammy.”
“I dunno. Chess? You’d probably be scary good at chess. Or you could read more books. You love books.”
“I know it sucks, but this is the only idea I have right now. If it doesn’t work, you’ll get some free amateur therapy out of it. Besides, you’re supposed to be the one who likes talking about feelings.”
Cas couldn’t tear his gaze from Dean’s face, desperately searching for any sign of him, any deviation from the eerie glow of Michael’s grace in his eyes. “Dean,” he said, “You can fight him.”
Castiel cleared his throat and shifted in his seat. “I want to apologize if I’ve pressured you at all.”
many problems. Because with women? No problem. But with a dude? Things got complicated. Cas wasn’t just some dude, but whatever sexual intimacy they would end up moving towards would be decidedly… well, gay. And how could Dean tell Cas that it wasn’t really the
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Sounds like you weren’t so confident about me beating Michael after all.”
Cas paused for a moment to catch his breath. “Cable ties,” he said gravely, gesturing to a box on the floor to his left. Jack rummaged through the box and returned to Cas’ side with a handful of white cable ties. Cas took them reluctantly, and said, “Holy oil, in the archive room.” Jack took off down the hallway, and Cas set his jaw, preparing for the part of this task he dreaded most.
He moved in slowly, dipping his head and pressing their lips together. It was chaste at first, but soon his right hand was cupped around Castiel’s neck, pulling him closer, and their lips moved with more insistence. When they finally pulled apart, they were both panting.
“I see you’ve discovered my gifts,” Cas said, turning back to Dean. “I understand that they may not warrant immediate forgiveness, but I hope they illustrate my intentions.”
“Sometimes, I see Nick,” Tammy said. “And I know you’re probably thinking it’s just grief, but it’s not. If it was grief making me see him, wouldn’t he talk to me? Wouldn’t he touch me? Wouldn’t my hallucinations actually make me happy, if they were hallucinations?”
The words stung, and Dean had to focus to drown his anger. “My past has nothing to do with this,” he growled. “Besides, unless I missed the memo on some weirdo angel customs, it’s not like we’re getting married.”
He pulls away to look at me. “You’re not useless,” he says, starting off the speech he’s made a hundred times by now. “But y’know, there are some jobs where I just can’t take you with me. I can’t do it. If I died on the job, you could… I don’t know, take up beekeeping or something. If you died on my watch, I don’t think I could live with myself.”
Cas unlocks the door and they both step inside, into a combined kitchen and living area. The interior is mostly wood, including the floors. It’s a small space, but with all the basics — a TV, refrigerator, oven, coffee maker (Dean’s especially glad to see that one), and ugly furniture that’s probably from the 70s. It’s the kind of place that looks like it would smell musty, but it mostly smells like cinnamon — Dean notices a plug-in air freshener in the kitchen that’s probably responsible for that.
Before he can continue, Dean leans down to kiss him — not to shut him up, but because he can’t help it. He’s overwhelmed again with the almost-heartache of feeling so much, and he has to let it out somehow. He cups the back of Cas’ neck, runs his fingers through his hair, and lets himself get lost in the kiss.
“Yeah, I know that. I meant, isn’t it boring for you to just sit there, or whatever? Are you at least doing something else in your head?”
Sam thought about telling Cas he was fine and sending him away, but as usual the look of confusion on the angel’s face tugged on his heart. Cursing his abnormally strong empathetic response, he sighed. “Sometimes people get anxious when they’re not sure how something’s going to turn out.”
Cas took a gasping breath and sat up. He was back in the dungeon of the bunker. Sam and Jack were at his side immediately, and Sam put a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Are you okay? Did you find Dean?”
“Like shit,” he said, and weakly attempted a smile that did not reach his eyes. “Like I got hit by a truck.”
“But I realize that I may have put you in an awkward position with the way I chose to apologize, and you were very emotional at the time– ”
Dean turns and looks at Cas. It’s probably dangerous for him to be looking away from the road for that long, but he doesn’t even care. He just needs to see Cas’ face, to make sure this is real. Cas’ eyebrows are slightly raised, as if he’s waiting for some sort of response. Dean finds his gaze lingering on Cas’ slightly messy hair, his chapped lips, his stubble that always seems to stay the same exact length. The staring does not go unnoticed.
Castiel considered not replying, but the frustration he had been holding in for weeks sensed an opportunity for release. “That’s interesting, because you’ve seemed to be avoiding any kind of interaction with me at all recently,” he said without looking up from his book.
“This may or may not be relevant to the case,” Cas said, “but Tammy was incorrectly gendered at birth.”
Waves of vertigo hit as soon as he understands what Cas is trying to say. “You – ” is all he can get out before he’s gripping the edge of the table.
“Well, I did some research on the trials you were doing. And for the last one, you had to confess your sins, right?”
Dean and Cas went to speak to the first two victims’ families that afternoon. Cas was getting much better at being an FBI agent, and luckily he was alright at the empathetic crap that Dean sometimes found difficult when he just wanted to get a case over with. After two very awkward conversations, they had a possible vengeful spirit suspect, a man named Nick who had been friends with all the victims. He had disappeared over a year ago, and was found dead weeks later in the Pine Ridge area where he had been on a hiking trip. His girlfriend, Tammy, was still living in Lincoln.
“Mhmm.” He kisses the back of Cas’ neck. Just a year ago, he never would’ve done something like that, it would’ve felt too earnest. But now he knows it doesn’t bother Cas in the slightest. Dean can kiss him, trace circles on his skin, play with his hair, all the sappy shit that seemed so impossible before. And he genuinely wants to do all those things, but it’s also a convenient way to ask for what he wants without actually asking; Cas seems to take note of the affection Dean gives him and return the favor by imitating his touches.
“How’d you find this place?” Dean asks. He’s curious to know, but he’s also sidestepping the sappy moment they just had.
Dean’s sobs faded, becoming erratic breaths punctuated by whimpers that would have mortified him had he been in his right mind. The angel said nothing for a long time. He just sat beside him and rubbed his arm soothingly. Finally, when Dean’s breathing returned to normal, Cas whispered, “Sleep. I’ll watch over you.” He wiped the remaining tears from Dean’s face with the back of his right hand.
“Sorry,” Dean muttered. He grabbed his clothes and retreated into the bathroom, worried that he was making Cas uncomfortable. He was clearly feeling
“Okay, you can lie if you want, but I’m going to pretend that you just said yes.” Sam ignored Dean’s look of contempt. “I know it’s complicated, because he’s an angel, but there’s nobody in this world more stubborn than you two, so I’m sure you can work something out.”
“To be honest, I think it had something to do with me. We were getting pretty serious, and I don’t think his friends liked me very much. That would explain why Nick didn’t want to talk to me about it.”
Jack was still eyeing the jar with trepidation. “Is that safe?” He looked up at Cas. “To give her grace, I mean.”
The fact that Cas is still enthusiastically hugging him has Dean feeling even more bold, so he presses a kiss to Cas’s temple. Cas pulls back with a surprised, but not displeased, expression, and pulls Dean's hands into his own. “I don’t have anything for you,” he says.
“Hold on, hold on. Are you trying to say I kissed you because I was emotionally compromised or some bullshit like that?” Dean kept a half smile on his face, even though he was a little hurt by what he thought Cas was getting at.
“She wants to make a personal trip in my car,” Cas says, clearly asking Dean for his opinion. They’re such a married couple.
Dean can’t imagine where this is going. They’ve done stuff – gotten intimate? He’s never sure what to call it – plenty of times before, and Cas is normally anything but hesitant. But Dean knows Cas’ body language pretty well by now, and since he isn’t closing himself off or tensing up, the question can’t be
“Yeah. And to be honest, I’m not sure if this is a case at all. I mean, maybe it’s just your run-of-the-mill serial killer. That would account for the similarities between the victims. I say if nothing goes down in the next couple of nights, we skip town, get back to Sammy.”
“He might not forgive you today, but it’ll get you a few points. It’ll be like… a gesture of friendship.”
When the door closes behind her, Sam says, “She didn’t even bring her bags down from the car.” There’s no bitterness in his tone; it sounds mostly like an observation tinged with a bit of amusement. They’ve both had a few years to adjust to Mary’s habit of taking off. She was dead for most of their lives, and now that she’s back, she doesn’t spend much time with them. Dean knows it’s nothing personal – she can’t pass up any opportunity for hunting, and it probably feels weird to hang around people she only really met a few years ago, even if they are her kids.
This time he woke up because his cell was ringing, and he prayed it wasn’t Dean calling to say that Cas had bailed on him, or Cas calling to say that Dean was in trouble. If he was going to die here, alone, then he at least wanted to know that his family was safe.
Dean spins them around and crowds Cas toward the bed. Cas puts a hand on his chest, and at first, Dean assumes Cas is just trying to get him to take his shirt off. But Cas pulls back from their kiss again, without the teasing look this time, and Dean realizes that Cas is trying to stop him. Anxiety flashes through his body. His stomach drops. “What – ”
Dean smirked halfheartedly. "No offense, man, but shouldn't I be the one having nightmares about that?"
“What, Cas? Trying to help? Lecturing me isn’t going to help right now, okay? I didn’t bring you with me so you could try to get inside my head.”
What with Cas’ complete lack of ability to respond to social queues, they sometimes forgot that he was still quite observant. He looked back and forth between the two brothers questioningly. “I see you’ve also noticed my other offering.”
“Don’t worry about that stuff. She said to get regular, so we’re gonna get one that says regular, but not the store brand.”
He had stayed with Dean all night, watching him sleep. When Dean’s breathing was deep and steady, he wondered what the hunter dreamed of, and even felt a twinge of envy– an emotion he had experienced for the first time fairly recently– when Dean’s face seemed to relax into an expression of calm and innocence. Angels didn’t sleep; they were designed to be efficient and had no biological imperative to dream. Castiel had tried to make himself sleep before, but even in his deepest meditative state he could still feel his consciousness like an itch in his mind. He craved to be completely unaware, to be reduced to an organism fulfilling its need for rest by separating from reality, if only for a few hours.
“No, but when a spirit is powerful enough – and if this one’s gone vengeful, it might be – it may be able to hide its presence from me.”
Foolish and prideful, Cas thought, would be an apt description of himself. But he suspected he would be that way with or without his grace. “In many ways, I’m not.”
Dean was unaware of the fact that he was pacing until he noticed Cas’ eyes following him back and forth. He forced himself to stand still for a moment. “Alright, let’s do surveillance here overnight, and we’ll see if anything goes down.”
“Nothing, I guess I just forget that you don’t feel like you’re babysitting me anymore. Sometimes I find it hard to believe that you actually want to be here. That you’re not bored out of your mind.”
Cas gets up. Dean’s heart hammers in his chest, and he swears that time slows down exponentially with every step Cas takes towards him. Finally they’re hugging, like they haven’t hugged in a long time, and Dean doesn’t force himself to pull away like he normally does. And he’s afraid that Cas will pull away, but he doesn’t.
It’s beyond awkward that Sam was so involved with setting all of this up, but Dean knows it’s probably just his brother’s way of being supportive without talking about it. And talking about it is the last thing Dean wants, so he’s willing to tolerate pretty much anything else.
“You taught me that,” Cas agreed. “You taught me that I could be more than what my Father wanted me to be.”
Dean laughed, and the sound filled Castiel with a kind of joy he had never really felt as an angel. Of course he had been able to feel happiness, but not to this extent (not until he had met Dean, anyway), and never on such a visceral level. For the first time since losing his grace, he didn't feel uncomfortable in his body. He was finally at ease. He vaguely recalled hearing the proverb, Laughter is the best medicine, and in that moment he understood.
Oh yes, Sam knew. He had known Dean all his life. He knew whether or not to break down a door based on the slightest look from him, he knew that the quick slide from carelessness to full-blown depression happened somewhere between beer number three and four, and he knew how he mouthed the lyrics to the songs he played on the car stereo when he thought Sam was asleep. If Dean really thought that his little brother didn’t know about his feelings for Cas, he was kidding himself.
Castiel lowered his voice. “Maybe that’s because your credit card is obviously stolen, Mr. Fredrico Suarez.”
“That’s great, Cas,” Sam said awkwardly, unsure if he was supposed to leave the room at this point. His eyes shifted to meet his brother’s, who gave him a glare to communicate that he should stay.
Castiel continued. “And then I wonder if you only hesitate because you’re uncertain as to how I would react. Let me be clear. Yes, I was upset with you for how you treated me when you were under the influence of the Mark. But I was also upset because even after that, even after you pretended it never happened, and even after you asked me to help you clean up yet another mess, I still loved you. No matter what you do to me, I think, I’ll still love you. I’ve been reduced to this ridiculous human emotion, and you refuse to confirm or deny whether you feel the same, and it’s maddening, Dean.”
“We got a case,” Sam said. His tone was flat, like it always got when he was mad at Dean but didn’t want to talk about it. “Just outside of Lincoln, three people have gone missing in the past week. All of them men in their early twenties, last seen leaving the same bar.”
Castiel stood in a field in Montana, a cool breeze sweeping through the grass and making it ripple around his shoes. His view of the mountains was partially obstructed by the trees at their foundation, a forest spotted with wildflowers and moss. A small herd of deer grazed a few hundred yards away, unconcerned with his presence.
Sam thought about his brother, who had locked himself in his bedroom with a bottle of hard liquor after a heated– well, from his side, anyway– exchange with Cas over his betrayal. There had been a lot of finger pointing and shouting about the tablets, but Sam knew what this was really about. Cas had chosen heaven over Dean, and Dean was not just angry, he was wounded.
“You’re already a Winchester by association, but you know what? I like the idea of making it official.”
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said quietly, looking down at his bare feet. After a short silence, he looked up at him again. “So you’re not… freaked out or anything?”
His eyes shifted to the side mirror, where the asphalt stretched out behind the impala all the way to where the sun was setting on the horizon. When he looked in the rearview, he jumped and hit the steering wheel in frustration. “Dammit, Cas.”
He cracks the Impala’s windows to let in some of the crisp, cool air, then hands Cas the box of cassette tapes, tells him to pick anything he wants. Cas puts on Bob Seger and looks out the window, gazing at the bare trees and scattered patches of melting snow with the expression of appreciation he often wears when observing the natural world. They sit in comfortable silence, except for Dean’s fingers tapping on the steering wheel along to the music, and Cas’ occasional driving directions.
Castiel felt a flutter in his chest, a strange flip in his gut, as soon as Dean had placed his hand on his. It seemed to him that this wasn’t something Dean was likely to do so freely, at least not in the real world. For a moment Cas felt that this must be Michael after all, disguised as Dean, toying with him. But Dean just looked at Cas intently, green eyes wide with concern, his palm still cupped around Cas’ hand.
“Yeah, let me pull it up.” Dean grabbed his phone and looked through several text messages to find what he was looking for. “Ok, so first vic was Robert Mendez, 23, went missing last Friday after leaving Ace’s Sports Bar around one a.m., and his body was found Saturday, beaten to a pulp. His apartment was locked from the inside, and the alarm system was set and appeared to be working. Friends say no one else had keys to the place, but police are investigating it as a homicide and suspect that whoever it was knew the alarm code.”
“That’s okay,” she said. She put down her stuff and approached him cautiously. “I don’t like sweaty hugs anyway.”
Dean has never taken things even half this slow with anyone, so the idea that they could move too fast is almost laughable to him. But that’s just it, ten years and all the shit they’ve been through, and Dean still can’t say ‘I love you’ to the guy, so maybe Cas has his reasons for being apprehensive. “Where are we going?”
“Yeah, except for you, maybe,” she said. “I’ll get right to the point. Dean called me. He said he and Cas had to leave you alone, and he’s worried about you. So I’m stopping by.”
Charlie knocked on Sam’s door three times before entering. He was still bedridden, swaddled in blankets, alternating between freezing and roasting. He tried his best to hold his head up when Charlie came in, but it felt a bit like trying to prop up a bowling ball with a toothpick.
“Yeah, if you can call it an address. You guys are full-on Batcave status now. So do me a favor and take the sharks out of the moat before I get there.”
Dean gets a worried look that’s almost identical to the one his brother gave Cas less than twenty minutes ago, and Cas resists the urge to roll his eyes.
“If there had been a dark magic cure, we would have come across it in our research. Maybe his body is simply recovering on its own.”
“He’s fine,” Cas said. “Relieved, like all of us. I did my best to put on a brave face throughout the whole ordeal, but I think he could see through the facade.”
In the store, Cas is perplexed by the sheer number of products that all seem to have similar functions, but also promise different things.
“It’s not real,” Cas said again. “It’s a memory.” When he looked around at their immediate surroundings, he found them particularly familiar – the dense thicket, the rocky clearing with a lopsided boulder and a cluster of tall ferns.
“And you of all people know how hard it is to do things for yourself when everyone else is telling you it’s the wrong thing. Just think, he might end up going to college because you told him it was alright to do something he wants to do.”
“No, it’s not,” Dean said, but all the usual forcefulness and certainty was gone from his voice. “What’s he playing at?” He cleared his throat and threw his shoulders back as if to jolt the masculinity back into his system. “I mean, does he really think that he can just give me some pie and everything will be fine?”
Cas opens the door just enough to lean in, smiling. “Happy birthday, Dean.” Even with the smile, he says it in that serious Castiel tone, like it’s the most important sentence he’ll ever speak. He says pretty much everything that way.
Dean, as usual, was the first to look away. “So you’re telling me you’re acting like this because I hurt your feelings?”
Castiel didn’t know how long he had been walking when a glint of metal in the distance caught his eye. He continued towards it, and the trees grew more and more sparse as he approached a clearing. Cautiously, he stepped to the edge of the treeline and peered around the mossy trunk of a cedar. In the center of the clearing, he saw the Impala. And there was Dean, tinkering with something under the hood.
“Yeah, and from what I hear, there’s a reason for that. So here.” Dean picks up a box of regular tampons and hands them to Cas.
“Yeah, you know, that’s your problem, Sammy. You’re too serious.” He swung the bottle around for emphasis. “I mean, for all we know, you could be dead tomorrow. And yet
Cas obeyed, and got the same result - three rings and Sam’s voicemail. “Sam? Call us when you get this.” The worry in Dean’s eyes only became more apparent. Cas watched the speedometer creep up to 95. “Can we track their phones?” he asked, trying to be helpful.
Super short chapter this time, sorry! But I'm already working on the next one, and I promise I'll try to be better about updating. Thank you so much for sticking with me.
“Hilarious,” Dean says, and he and Cas leave the room. That’s it. There’s no hugging (Dean’s pretty sure his hugging quota has been filled for a while), no questions, no weird comments. As they go up the stairs to the door, Cas gives him a look that says,
Sam, against his better judgment, stepped in. “They do. They do signify friendship.” His contribution was met with a dirty look from Dean.
“If that were true, you wouldn’t have taken me with you on this case. I think you’re worried about me. You want to protect me.”
“I know. I’ve read the books. So I already have a few ideas for things we should start with. Do you wanna start small and work our way up to the blood stuff?”
“I really appreciate you coming with me,” Cas says. “I could go on my own, but it wouldn’t be as fun.”
A green glow materialized ahead: an exit sign. Cas pulled at Dean’s shirt and started towards it. The water was now up to their ankles. “What if it’s a trap?” Dean said, shouting to be heard over the blaring alarm and rushing water.
“Perhaps I should have acquired an admirer sooner. I didn’t realize it would take jealousy to make you say something.”
When Castiel finished, Dean was crying. He folded his arms across his bare chest, suddenly very aware that he was still wearing only a towel. Such a strong declaration of love and acceptance made him feel incredibly humbled and vulnerable, and he wanted nothing more than to curl up into a ball on the floor, or better yet, disappear into thin air. “Sorry,” he muttered, because apologizing for crying was his instinct. “I thought I could go without telling you, but – ”
“I’m not going to ask him to come back. But he’s your brother and he would want to know how bad this is. Besides, maybe he and Cas can start thinking of ways to heal you. There has to be some spell, or something. You just don’t know about it yet.” She was smiling, but the worry in her voice was clear.
Dean shook his head. “Enough people get dragged into this life. If she wakes up one day and decides she wants to be a hunter, she has my number. But I didn’t want it to be my idea. It has to be hers.”
Several agonizing seconds go by, and Cas is still sitting in the passenger seat, his eyes wide and fixed on the road ahead. “You… don’t normally say that to people,” he finally says. “Not verbally.”
“Don’t worry. I’m not gonna make a run for it,” she says while trying to ignore her cramps. They’re always worst in the beginning.
Dean finds the closet empty, aside from a few hangers and an electric space heater. He sets up the heater a safe distance from the bed, and turns it on.
Jack gagged and turned away. Sam, who was far more accustomed to the organs and bodily fluids of monsters, stepped forward for a closer look, his expression an odd combination of interest and disgust. Cas knew that this wouldn’t have been an easy item to acquire, but found that he didn’t particularly care to know the details.
books where she thought there might be guilt, and brought up those situations if Sam didn’t bring them up himself. After two hours, they had filled up seven pages with things Sam needed to forgive himself for.
That might explain why Nick could show up there even though he died miles away: a deep emotional connection to the place. But why wasn’t there any ectoplasm showing up? It didn’t quite fit. Dean could feel a headache coming on.
“No! I mean, yes. The answer is yes. If you wanna get married, then I wanna get married.” He looks down at the ring. “I want to put it on, but my hands…”
He didn’t know why he felt surprised. It made sense. Cas had chosen free will, forfeiting his Angel Card. Just because he got to hold on to some of the perks didn’t mean he was still a member of the club. Still, Dean couldn’t help feeling guilty. He wasn’t exactly sorry for the way things had turned out – he was too selfish for that – but he was sorry for whatever pain Cas might have experienced.
Dean’s phone vibrates on the nightstand, shaking him from sleep. He has no idea what time it is (it’s always dark in the bunker, what with the whole underground, no windows thing), but he has the vague sense that it’s morning. He turns over groggily and reaches for his phone, unlocks it. The screen nearly blinds him, and he turns the brightness down, groaning. It’s 7:51 am, and he has a new text from Cas:
It soon became clear that their memory-selves couldn’t see them; Benny looked right through them both and kept walking. As the other Dean and Cas came closer, Cas could see that they were filthy and exhausted. Even so, Dean looked noticeably younger.
Cas has seemed pretty down lately, and as much as Dean likes to avoid conversations that could get too serious too quickly, he can’t stand that Cas is so droopy. So one morning in the bunker, while he’s drinking his coffee and Cas is sulking at the table, he just asks him.
Sam walked slowly to the staircase, being careful that his limp would not be visible. He gripped the banister for support and began the painful journey to the second floor, looking back to see Cas still fixated on the floor and Dean holding his head in his hands.
Dean nods and takes a sip of his coffee, which has gone cold. “Well, if you’re ever, you know, not alright, you know where to find me.”
“Maybe this should have been a summer vacation,” Cas says when he comes back with their bags. He deposits them on the floor, and watches with a somewhat apologetic expression as Dean holds his hands up to the heater.
“Dean?” Cas said after a few seconds too long of silence. In a few strides he was standing next to a still frozen Dean. “I apologize, I didn’t mean – ”
“No, thanks. I think we’re okay. Is it alright if we ask you a few questions about Nick?” Dean said.
“Humans as a whole, but yes, you in particular. My mission, the Righteous Man. You could disobey orders. Consider how foreign that was to me.”
The color drained from Dean’s face, but he kept his eyes shut. “Cas, he’s… he’s waking up.” The water crept up around the doorframe, now escaping from the gaps on either side as well as underneath.
“If Dean has to forgive me to save my life, doesn’t that take some of the sincerity out of it?” Sam asked.
When they arrive in downtown Lebanon (if it can even be called “downtown”), everything looks just as Dean pictured it would. There’s a block’s length of stands and booths set up, most with tarp canopies set up over them to keep out the lightly falling snow. People are strolling up and down the block, lining up in front of popular stands, and off to the side, a group of little kids are throwing snowballs at each other. The local businesses have strings of Christmas lights outlining their windows, and Bing Crosby’s recording of “Walking in a Winter Wonderland” is blasting from an actual
Castiel figured it was just his luck that during the same time he was learning to cope with being human, he and Dean were also learning to cope with being… whatever they were. Well, to be fair, it was mostly Dean that needed to adjust to that particular change. Castiel had been aware of their connection for quite some time, and for him it felt perfectly natural to let their relationship progress. It felt right to him to sit right next to Dean on the couch even when there was plenty of room, to let his hand linger on Dean's shoulder after a hug, to touch him simply for the sake of touching him. He relished the moments when a stray eyelash or piece of lint would provide him the opportunity to touch Dean the way he deserved to be touched, gently and attentively. Dean did not overtly object to these touches, but he never really reacted to them, either. He received them passively (sometimes muttering a thank you, like when Castiel had brushed pollen out of his hair), and then went on with whatever he was doing, Sam watching with a half-amused expression on his face.
Cas has been sleeping more and more now, among other human things, but otherwise he seems fine. Dean still isn’t ready to let himself feel relieved yet. He always checks to make sure Cas is still breathing when he finds him passed out in a chair in the library or sitting up in bed, an open book laying on his chest or held loosely in one hand. Cas seems convinced that if these changes were really life threatening, he would have felt unwell by now. All logic aside, Dean spends a lot of time worrying, and hovering, and making Cas drink more water than is probably necessary.
Cas lets out a small, soft laugh. “Text messages don’t count. I wanted to let you sleep in, but Sam and Jack got donuts, and if you don’t get up soon, I’m afraid you won’t get one.”
His tone implied that Cas was supposed to have done or said something, but he didn’t know what. “Yes?”
Dean turns around, setting down his wrench and wiping his hands on the rag that’s draped over his shoulder (not that it does much good, as it’s covered in grease as well). “Heya, Cas,” he says.
They walked together through the seemingly endless forest, Cas following a few feet behind Dean with his angel blade drawn. The only sound was their shoes crunching in the dirt. Cas found that he had no real sense of time here – it seemed strangely compressed. He could only hope they weren’t too late.
“Dean, you made that other door appear back there. You wanted to leave, and suddenly there was a way out. Maybe it’s the same for getting back to your body. If you focus – ”
“There’s a diner down the street,” Dean said. “How about we buy you lunch? We got a lot to talk about.”
"I know, I was mostly kidding. But sometimes it helps to have someone with you. Makes you feel safer. And we can't both fit on the couch."
“Hey, mom,” Dean says, and he can hear the surprise in his own voice. She’s been away for a few weeks, working on a series of hunts with Bobby, and it hadn’t even occurred to Dean to ask if she would be back in time for his birthday – that’s just not the kind of thing hunters prioritize. But here she is, and she gets up to give him a hug.
Dean shakes his head and Cas narrows his eyes. “No way,” Dean says. “They’re very strong, I promise. But I keep my controlled substances away from kids.”
This was not the first time Dean had to be restrained as a safety measure – far from it – and Cas knew he would understand. Still, there was something so crude about the cable ties, especially when he knew Dean was in there, probably drowning in pain and fear. Cas rose to his feet and placed two fingers against Dean’s neck to find a rapid, pounding pulse. Cas gently lifted one of Dean’s eyelids, terrified that he would see grace burning beneath. Instead he saw a dilated pupil, so large that it almost filled the entire iris. The other eye was the same. Cas lifted his hand to Dean’s temple and tried to get into Dean’s mind, to catch a glimpse of him, or even Michael. But he only found a dark, impenetrable fog. Cas couldn’t tell if it was due to Michael, or his own drained grace.
They went over the timeline together – Jack, Lucifer, all of it. It was difficult for Cas to watch Dean’s expressions as remembered Sam getting dragged away by vampires in Apocalypse World, the horrible things Michael did in his body, Jack sick and dying. Cas couldn’t imagine processing so much forgotten information in the span of a minute, especially as traumatic as it all was. He was impressed at how well Dean seemed to be handling it.
Rowena pulled some more materials out of her bag and began to set up a workspace on the table. Everyone was sweating now – Dean included, Cas could see – as the holy fire warmed the room.
“Besides, I think Dean let Kevin go because he reminds him of you. I think he knows you see a younger version of yourself when you look at Kevin, and this is his way of apologizing to you. For not giving you a choice. Even if he still thinks it was the right thing. Even if you both do.”
“Of course, Dean. I prepared for this scenario as well. According to my research, you may have PTSD – ”
“C’mon, Cas. You’re a friggin celestial being. You’re the strongest guy I know.” Dean gave him a little punch on the arm. “Besides, you’re talking like I had some kind of heroic comeback.” He chuckled humorlessly. “What I couldn’t ignore, I drenched in whiskey, and I’m not sure if that qualifies as brave, you know?”
There’s a long pause. Cas is looking at his hands where they’re folded in his lap. “And that would bother you,” he says. “If people thought that.”
Cas smiles, amused, and obediently gets up to change. He doesn’t usually let Dean boss him around, but it seems that Dean’s birthday is reason enough for him to allow it. Dean pulls his own sweats and thermal out of his bag and changes as well.
“I’m Julie,” she replied, blushing at Dean’s wink. Cas let out a huff, but the girl didn’t seem to hear it. “I’ve been here for about two months.”
Sam stood awkwardly outside Dean’s bedroom door, listening to the muffled sounds of what he thought was Anthrax blasting from laptop speakers. He took a deep breath and knocked, and allowed himself a moment of panic when there was no response. Dean’s constant alcohol abuse paired with his horrific diet and lifelong shortage on sleep was not exactly ideal, even for an otherwise healthy thirty-year-old. An even more disturbing possibility passed through his mind as he pictured his brother with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, finally free from his responsibilities, fear of inadequacy, and internalized homophobia…
“Let me,” Cas said, holding out his hand. Dean handed over the phone, giving Cas a questioning look. “It’s unsafe to make calls while driving,” Cas said, and Dean rolled his eyes. Cas was also tempted to comment on Dean’s current speed, which was 90 mph, but he thought it best to say nothing on this particular subject. All his past attempts at getting Dean to drive slower had been fruitless, and especially considering how worried he was about Sam, it was unlikely that Dean would change this habit now.
Dean didn’t look at him. Cas could see how uncomfortable he was, and backed off immediately. “I’m sorry, you don’t have to – ”
Cas continued. “I have been confused by your behavior recently, and now you have just had another confusing reaction to my apology. I am trying to understand. Why are you ashamed to speak about your attraction to other males?”
“Hey, that’s my species you’re talking about.” He was glad to hear– and feel – Cas’ small chuckle. “And c’mon, man, I’m pretty sure I’ve seen the worst of you already. You tried to kill me, for one thing. You’re weird beyond belief. And you’re not the best at keeping in touch. Don’t you think if my feelings were gonna change, it would’ve happened by now?”
Charlie and Sam made a list of everything he was feeling guilty for. Sam couldn’t even sit up enough to hold a pen and a pad of paper, so Charlie sat in the chair across from his bed and wrote things down as he talked. She had bookmarked pages in the
. If Cas takes any offense to Dean’s exit, he doesn’t show it, just gets out of the car and stretches.
Dean walked along the perimeter of the lot, and the readings on the EMF meter diminished the further he got from the bar. “Obviously we’re on to something here. Do you think the chicks that work here were lying? Covering up for someone, maybe?”
“Yeah, totally kidding about that last one. But the other stuff’s true. I’ll see you in a couple hours, okay?”
During Dean’s sleep cycle, however, there were also moments when his breath would hitch and the veins in his neck would pulse, his hands twitching and clenching, anxious sounds escaping his lips. He was easily soothed with a hand stroking his forehead or pressed against his cheek, but Castiel knew that in the past, Dean had suffered through these moments alone. This knowledge broke him, and although he could not blame himself for the years before he knew Dean, there were plenty of nights cataloged in his mind when he had chosen to leave soon after Dean fell asleep. Even worse, there were those nights he spent absent from the Winchester’s life altogether.
“I know,” Sam said, forcing some reassurance into his voice. “It’s just that Dean doesn’t care about intentions as much as he cares about the outcome. Sometimes an apology just doesn’t cut it.”
Sam tossed the bunker keys to Jack, who ran ahead of Cas to unlock and open the door. Jack’s eyes were wide as he looked back at Dean’s pale face. “He’s okay, Jack,” Cas said firmly.
“Just anything weird, like maybe coworkers acting strange, or maybe even some black goop lying around?”
Dean can feel himself blushing furiously, and gives a weak little nod of understanding. He then turns his attention to the Impala. “Sorry, Baby,” Dean says to her as he unlocks the driver’s side door, “We’re going out in the snow.”
“Before you shout,” Rowena said, coming into the dungeon with Sam, “I am quite aware that this is urgent, but I had to gather a few things.”
It’s a little gross, to be honest. They’re like dads to her, in a way, so she really doesn’t want to stick around to hear what’s going to happen next. But as she heads back to her room she can’t help thinking,
dying in the middle) surprises him more than the last. But something about this day, if not the age itself, does feel different. Maybe it’s all the attention – most of his birthdays have been celebrated quietly, with a couple of beers between him and Sam, and maybe a pizza. Now he has this whole family, hugging him, encouraging him to sit down and pick out any donut he wants, like he’s a little kid. It feels a bit wrong, a bit unsettling. But maybe that’s just because he’s never had it before.
“I assure you, if anything of importance had occurred, I would have made sure to wake you,” Cas replied.
Cas blinked back his tears and cleared his throat, obviously trying to hold it together. “I’ve never been so… attached to anyone. Before I chose free will, I don’t think I had attachments at all. There were things I was fond of, sure – humanity, for one – but if I had been asked to let go of those things, it wouldn’t have occurred to me to fight for them. Now… I am attached to you, and though it feels right in many ways, it hurts as well. It scares me, Dean, because I have never lost something so important as you, and if I did, I’m not sure I would survive it.”
Sam sighed. “I guess I just can’t see Dean being that open about anything, you know? I tried to talk to him about it, and he shut down.”
Well it's been almost 2 years since I posted the first chapter, but better late than never, right? Just wanted to give them the happy ending they deserve.
“Charlie, you don’t have to do that. I’m fine. Dean’s being melodramatic.” Even as he spoke, he felt himself getting lightheaded just from sitting up in bed.
Rowena began the verbal part of the spell, and Cas did his best to focus on relaxing rather than translating the Latin. A few Enochian words registered without any conscious effort, however, roughly translating to “merge” and “dive.” These words aided his concentration somewhat, and he imagined – or perhaps felt? – himself descending into a body of water, Dean’s mind enveloping his.
“Hey, you’re a whole person, Cas,” Dean said, repeating the words Castiel had said to him just hours before. “Not just some bucket of angel mojo I carry around with me.” His tone was decisively casual, and his eyes downcast, as though that could possibly lessen the significance of what he said.
Sam’s entire being seemed to protest his presence in the room, and he felt a rush of adrenaline stronger than the ones he normally felt on hunts. He instinctively glanced at the staircase, planning his escape. This was a conversation that Dean and Cas needed to have alone. Just because Dean had the emotional maturity of a twelve-year-old didn’t mean that he had to pick up the slack. If Dean was in the middle of a vampire nest, Sam would sure as hell go in after him, but this was something entirely different. He knew he had to stay out of the line of fire, especially if he was going to stay strong enough to complete the trials. He imagined being ripped apart by hellhounds or having a heart attack from all the stress on his body while his brother and his friend argued about their feelings. No, he couldn’t ref this one. He had to sit it out. He would let Dean and Cas hash it out alone, and try to be there for each of them during the aftermath. This wasn’t going to go well, and although the best-case scenario might involve his brother being truly happy, the worst-case scenario involved pissing off an angel who already had some serious attitude problems.
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Cas. I’m sorry I hurt your feelings. I’m sorry you thought we were just using you or something. But right now, we got bigger fish to fry.” Dean gestured at the books that were spread out across the table.
“It’s okay. I’ve had a lot of Christmases. This is kinda your first one. Or the first one you’re actually experiencing.”
“I enjoy spending time with you. Nothing more is required,” Cas said. “I am very sexually attracted to you, Dean,” he added, seemingly sensing that Dean was about to reiterate his doubt. “And we can proceed however you wish. I just need you to understand that I don’t expect anything from you. You don’t owe me anything.”
“Actually, I wanted to talk to you,” Cas says, ignoring the fact that it’s suddenly very difficult to breathe.
“You don’t have to answer tonight,” he says as he gets up. “You could think about it, if you need to.”
“I’ll go with you,” Jack says, and they both head into the library. For months, they’ve all been looking through lore books to find something that can restore Jack’s grace. He doesn’t need to be at full power, but everyone would feel better if he could defend himself without siphoning off pieces of his soul to do so. It feels kind of hopeless to Dean at this point, but if it makes them happy to keep researching, he’s certainly not going to stop them.
“ – so of course I had to get it back. If it fades away now, or becomes something else, then that’s all right with me. I’m at peace with it.”
French doors off the bedroom allow for a better view of the lake than the one they had from the car. The water is a deep blue-green, with glints of white and gold from the reflection of the sun, which has begun to dip low in the sky. Dean follows Cas out the doors and onto a deck, where stairs lead down to the wooden dock that stretches about thirty feet onto the water. A light breeze sends a sweep of goosebumps down Dean’s arms, despite the layers he’s wearing. It will probably be dark — and much colder — in less than an hour. Cas stops at the railing and looks out across the lake, his expression serene, and Dean joins him. They stand there silently for a moment, just appreciating the view.
“Okay,” Sam said, pulling out the chair at the head of the table and throwing himself down into it. “Sit down.” He gestured to the chair closest to Dean.
Sam turned to Jack and said, “C’mon, you gotta eat something.” Jack sighed and started down the hall. Sam followed, pausing in the doorway to give Cas a solemn nod. Especially in moments like this, Cas felt incredibly grateful that Sam still trusted him, after everything. There had been plenty of dishonesty and deceit to go around (in all directions) between Sam, Dean and himself over the years. When Sam forgave Dean for his mistakes, it seemed like a reflex, an obligation, one he did not owe to Cas in the same way.
— a case to run off on, someone to rescue, something to research, an apocalyptic scenario to circumvent. Now it’s just him and Cas, and unless some kind of lake monster emerges in the night, they’re in for a normal, relaxing weekend, a concept that Dean can’t quite comprehend. Hunting, research, even just hanging out at the bunker, he knows how all those things go, but this? Hours with nothing planned, no critical task to complete, no impending danger, and no one else around? It’s both wonderful and daunting.
“This conversation was not entirely fruitless for me,” Cas says. “You weren’t just jealous of angels in general. You were specifically jealous of Hannah…"
“They’ve both won against archangels now?” Rowena said. She waved a hand over her spell bowl, and the slimy contents vanished.
Rowena’s spell came to an end, punctuated with one final flick of her wrists in Michael’s direction. The angel cuffs glowed white, and Cas winced as Dean’s wrists began to sizzle and burn. Michael roared in pain and shut his eyes. “Now, Dean!” Rowena shouted. “He’ll be at his weakest now!”
watch it tonight,” Charlie said as she helped Sam clear away the empty beer bottles. On his way out of the room, Sam gave Dean a pat on the shoulder that seemed to be both an apology and a thank you. “G’night, nerds,” Dean called after them.
Castiel smiled, either from being called a Winchester or a fuck-up or both. “I’m sorry we had to have this conversation in the middle of a case,” he said. “All because I couldn’t keep my eyes to myself. You would think an angel would show more restraint.”
“And since you’re apparently not going to tell me, I can’t help you with that part,” Sam added, folding his arms and leaning back in his chair.
They walked to the car in silence, and Dean tried to make sense of Cas’ words. What did this have to do with the case?
“Sorry.” Castiel was in the back seat, making eye contact with Dean in the mirror. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
They had their badges out when they knocked on the door of Tammy’s apartment, but before Dean could say anything, she just opened the door and said, “Come in. I’m Tammy. I heard you were in town.”
Dean’s breath hitches. He’s the one that started the flirting just now, but it still surprises him how easily Cas can turn it back on him. He used to think of himself as a master of seduction, but Cas can disarm him without even trying. “I mean… if that’s what you want.”
If Cas’ words were meant to wound, they only did so because of the genuine self-hatred behind them. Dean sighed. “It’s okay, man. Thanks for trying.”
“Crap,” he said, and slid his ear protection off his head to let it rest around his neck. “Were you – ”
Dean seemed genuinely surprised, which Castiel supposed was reasonable. He had rarely seen him cry, and even then, it was never like this. Never like a child, never out of fear and hopelessness. Dean's demeanor changed instantly, shifting towards something Castiel had only caught glimpses of before, and only when he was interacting with his brother. His facial expression softened, and if there had been any trace of annoyance at being woken up again, it was gone now, replaced by empathy and concentration.
“Her consciousness was easy to read. And I don’t usually go around reading people’s minds, to answer your next question. But people are dying, and I could tell that Tammy was hiding something. The things that people have said and done to her… I am generally an admirer of humanity, but there are times when I feel that it is hopeless, if only for the ways you treat one another.”
“You appear to be in stable condition,” Cas said. “Dean is not in any immediate danger. The chances of us being detected in this building are considerably low. Even if I were to leave to obtain the dessert item you requested, the risk level for me is minimal.”
He feels guilty, he says, that I lost my grace. He’s certain that were it not for him, I would still be an angel, grace and all, not just ‘his angel’, as he says. I am perfectly content being his angel. I would not give up my free will to restore my place in the host, and I certainly would not give up Dean. As much of an adjustment as it was, becoming human, a part of me thinks it was always meant to happen. Perhaps my Father created me this way on purpose, and this has been his plan all along. And if His plan was for me to live on earth with Dean and Sam, these wonderful people who love me and care for me more than my siblings ever did, then I know that He loves me.
It’s late afternoon when Cas instructs him to turn onto a dirt road, and after a few miles, the lake becomes visible. It’s small (only a few acres, if Dean had to guess) and secluded, surrounded by birch and cottonwood trees. As promised, it’s not frozen over, despite the cold weather.
It was becoming increasingly difficult for Sam to tolerate Dean’s obliviousness. “C’mon, Dean. He adores you. Besides,” he added, “he needs you to help him navigate. Without you, he’s completely clueless.”
Here was Cas, still recovering from Rowena’s attack dog spell – a situation he very narrowly escaped, and with little help from the Winchesters, no less – aiding in undoing the chaos caused by the brothers’ combined hubris and overall dysfunction, and Dean couldn’t even be bothered to help. Instead, Dean stood with his arms crossed over his chest, with the impatient expression of a king awaiting his army’s return from battle.
Dean turns back to Claire. “Seriously. Everything gets all weird.” He gestures to his stomach. “The store’s not too far, anyway. It shouldn’t be longer than a half hour.”
When they pull onto the highway, it’s like Dean can finally breathe. He never would’ve realized on his own just how much he needed to get away with Cas for a while. The bunker is home (and he’s glad to have it), but it can get a little claustrophobic, and not just because it’s underground. Maybe it’s because he’s so used to constantly being on the move, but waking up in the same room every day feels almost depressing sometimes.
Castiel remembered the last time Dean was here, his arms and legs bound to this very chair, his eyes black and cold.
Dean’s eyes drifted to the floor, though Sam was unsure if it was due to the subject matter of their overall conversation or his mention of Jess. Neither brother spoke for a moment.
Dean’s heart sank. He never liked it went Cas disappeared, but this was a particularly shitty time for him to bail. He could have at least said where he was going.
Sam had been in bed most of the day, getting only the unsatisfying kind of sleep he got when he was feverish. He would pass out for an hour or so, then wake up soaked in sweat, fists clenched at his sides. It reminded him of detoxing from demon blood, though it was different in that instead of hurtling toward a terrifying, violent end, he could feel himself simply growing weaker, being carried further and further away from the living by currents that lulled him to sleep as they drowned him.
Dean took a deep breath. “In hell,” he began, “a lot of shit happened. I don’t remember a lot of it. But some of it I do. And one of the weapons they used against me was… they did things to me that were…” He could barely get the words out. “I never did it to anyone else. I couldn’t. It was the only thing I couldn’t do.”
“Yes, well, I understand that might seem obvious, given everything you’ve been through. But what I was trying to say is that you might have more specific trauma, directly linked to experiences with sexual overtones. And I understand that it’s important to be cautious if that is the case.”
He knew that Dean might not be ready to accept that. He clearly had doubts about his worth, regardless of Castiel’s efforts to convince him of its boundlessness. But Cas was a patient being, having lived for millennia with nothing but orders to follow, so he could certainly wait for Dean to feel more comfortable speaking to him about personal matters, especially if it meant enjoying the hunter’s company along the way.
“With you? To bed?” Cas was surprised. He had thought their relationship might need to be different now that they were back in the bunker with Sam.
Suddenly there’s a hand under Dean’s chin, lifting it up, and he’s staring into those chilling blue eyes. It’s now or never.
He wished he could be more gentle with Dean, but he wasn’t sure how much time they had. “What year is it?” he said, hoping this would be a quick way to prove his point.
part he was freaked out about, it was more the things associated with it in his mind, associations he had no control over?
It was never particularly surprising to me that I “fell” in such a manner; I am convinced that I have been defective by angel standards from the very beginning, and perhaps the most ungodly thing an angel can do is to love a human the way I love Dean. It has nothing to do with him being a man, as he likes to imply, but rather the fact that my love for him is selfish beyond anything I have ever allowed myself to experience. It has nothing to do with simple admiration for my Father’s creations, as I tried to convince myself in the beginning. It has everything to do with keeping Dean to myself, protecting him at all costs, and showing him the love he deserves. It is a jealous love, with far too much grit and fire and need to possibly be considered holy. And given my predisposition to emotional weakness, falling — and falling in love — was inevitable. I didn’t stand a chance.
Dean gave Sam a sideways glance that was probably supposed to be subtle, and Sam knew he was looking for direction. Sam met his brother’s eyes and then looked pointedly at the rose, hoping that Dean would take the hint and thank Cas for that as well.
“In ordinary cases, genetic mutations spread very slowly across populations. But the smaller gene pools paired with DNA that is already extraordinary… Theoretically, it makes sense.”
“Dean. This doesn’t solve our current problem. Either this is a vengeful spirit that somehow has the ability to make rational decisions, or we were incorrect in our original prognosis.”
As tempting as it is to simply enjoy Cas sleeping next to him, a different temptation wins out. Dean moves forward to press himself against Cas’ back and snake an arm around his waist. He mouths against his neck and gently drags his teeth across his earlobe. Cas’ breathing changes, and Dean can tell that he’s awake, although he doesn’t move. He pauses, briefly wondering if Cas doesn’t appreciate the wake up call.
“Maybe because two guys he was close friends with just turned up dead, and another one’s missing?” Dean offered.
“But unless I misunderstand you, Dean – and for once, I don’t think that is the case – then I feel the same way. I have for a long time.”
Cas rolled his eyes at her comment, but Jack pulled back from the hug to face her. “Thank you, Rowena,” he said. “You saved me, and now you saved Dean. You’re a very talented witch.”
One bacon cheeseburger and several baskets of bottomless fries later (all for Dean, of course), they decided it was time to check the outside of the building. Dean said this was looking less and less like a vengeful spirit case – unless this particular spirit was a neat freak, it would be weird for it to not leave any ectoplasm behind at all – but they figured they’d check outside for black goo just in case.
“Can’t help you with your stuff, either,” Sam said, feeling more and more useless by the second. “Since standing up is apparently an issue.”
Dean flashed his badge to the blonde behind the bar, and Cas followed suit. “My name is Agent Crosby, and this is my partner Agent Stills. We’re here about the recent disappearances. Would you be willing to talk with us?”
Cas narrows his eyes, trying his best to look displeased. Dean finally leans in and catches Cas’ lips with his own. But the kiss doesn’t last long, as both of them keep laughing. It’s from both the ridiculousness of the situation and the kind of pure elation that bubbles to the surface in the form of uncontrollable laughter.
A faint smile forms on Cas’ lips. “An angel rebels against all of heaven for you, and you never think it might be more than just camaraderie?”
“You truly are. You may not be used to that term being applied to males, but it certainly is accurate in this case.”
Dean tried to picture himself living in an actual house again, with the Impala in the driveway, retired from her long cross-country trips. It was a nice house, the one in his mind, and peaceful, but even with an imagined family inside, the scenario felt sad. It felt like an ending, not a beginning.
“I know that other people find you attractive, and that is not a reason for me to get angry. The way she looked at you made me feel something I haven’t felt in a long time.” Cas looked down at his hands, where they were folded on the table, next to his untouched beer. “But just because the nature of our relationship has changed doesn’t mean I’m justified in my reaction.”
“Because when Nick died, his parents tried for months to get the police to keep investigating. They didn’t believe it was an accident. They thought maybe…” She shook her head, like she was shaking away a bad thought. “The police wrapped everything up pretty quick, and never looked back. Why would they suddenly be interested now?”
Cas seems to decide against lurking in the doorway, and steps inside. Dean is glad to see him gaining the confidence to enter his room without an explicit invitation – in the past he’s seemed concerned about crossing a boundary or invading Dean’s space. Most of the time, Dean
“I do not understand,” Cas said. “Why do you find it unacceptable for a male to present another male with a section of an angiosperm organism?”
Sam opened the door and met eyes with Dean, who was lying upside down over the side of the bed, whiskey bottle in hand.
After a moment, water began to leak out from underneath the door closest to them. And at first, Cas felt relieved that something, anything, had happened. But then he remembered something Dean had said.
, the kind Dean had when he was fourteen. It feels like they’ve stepped back in time, and Dean catches himself thinking that it’s sort of romantic, in a way.
“Yeah, whatever. Hope your imaginary illness goes away,” Dean says, closing Sam’s door on his way out.
“Well, this wouldn’t be the first time a spirit could travel beyond where it’s tied to. Especially if it has some personal connection to the victims, it could probably hitch a ride with them.”
Cas looked slightly to his right, then back down at the asphalt, clearly trying to act casual. He turned to face Dean. “Hmm.”
“Thought not,” said Rowena, and set the jar down on the table. “In any case, I’m here now. I will, however, need one more thing. I’ll need... ” She paused, looking directly at Castiel. “... a wee bit of angel grace.”
Cas took out his angel blade and rolled up his sleeves. He handed the vial to Sam, who, without instruction, held it up against Cas’ forearm as he made a shallow cut. Rowena watched, and said, “That will do,” when the vial was half full. Sam capped it and handed it back to her while Cas waved a hand over the wound, sealing it off. He felt a brief wave of exhaustion pass over him, but did his best to maintain a neutral expression.
Sam has recently left for his morning jog (“Really, Sammy? Even on Christmas?”), so Dean just sits there alone and drinks his coffee, staring at his Christmas present for Cas. He’d gone back and forth so many times on whether or not to wrap it, and whether or not he should buy actual wrapping paper for that. In the end, he’d decided that it was not exciting enough of a gift to warrant actual wrapping paper, but the Winchester method of wrapping with newspaper seemed appropriate.
They start making their way down the block. Dean keeps his hands in his coat pockets and avoids eye contact with the townspeople, while Cas receives numerous compliments on his catastrophe of a Christmas sweater and seems intent on engaging every vendor in conversation about whatever they’re selling. He admires some tacky homemade ornaments, asks about cookie decorating techniques, and even tries some hot chocolate – he’s been trying more food and drink recently, so Dean suspects it doesn’t taste so much like molecules to him anymore.
“Arbitrarily masculine?” He smiled. “You have a very attractive physique. Many people would find you to be a suitable mate, especially based on the size and strength of your arms.”
“I’m not exactly a chef, but something tells me you’re not going to ask for a gourmet meal in this condition anyway. How about crackers? Can we do crackers?”
“It’s fine, man. I didn’t want to make this weird, but something… Something’s just different, you know? I guess it’s just freaking me out a little.”
Once their footsteps faded, Dean and Cas sat in silence for a few moments, the florescent lights humming above them. It was not an uncomfortable silence, and Cas felt no immediate desire to break it. He found himself overcome with appreciation for so many things... Sam was alright. Dean seemed to be mostly alright now, too, though Cas could still see the weight of the past few hours in his body language. He looked tired. Even after countless years of being sleep deprived, stressed, and burdened with unimaginable responsibilities, only the possibility of losing Sam could reveal just how exhausted Dean really was.
“Cas, for the record, I want to have sex with you. I do.” Dean was surprised he was able to say it out loud. “But like you said, I probably have some trauma or whatever, so I might be a little weird about it at first.”
Dean glances back towards the library, trying to decide whether he can get away with kissing Cas right here, right now. He doesn’t have a clear sightline to wherever Sam and Jack are, but he can hear their voices coming from what sounds like the back corner of the library, so he grabs Cas’ tie and pulls him forward. Before their lips even come together, there’s a whoosh of wings and the world spins. Half a second later, they’re standing in Dean’s bedroom, and Cas is kissing him breathless.
Dean broke his insolent glare and looked down, but the indignation remained clear in his expression.
“Yeah, I’m not sure if that’s something he’s ready to say yet. And especially if you’re going to live here, you have to give him enough room to be himself, even if he’s being ridiculous. If you try to push things between him and Cas, he’ll resent you for it.”
“Even if it did take us to Apocalypse World,” Cas posited, “it couldn’t be the real thing. We’re in your mind. It would just be your interpretation, a memory.”
Cas was smiling completely now, one of those rare, sincere smiles, and damn it all if Dean was going to let his dumb issues get in the way of seeing that smile more often. “Alright, let’s get out of here,” he said. He was half afraid that if they waited any longer he would end up dragging Cas into bed.
Dean showers quickly, brushes his teeth and throws on his predictable ensemble of a T-shirt, flannel, and jeans. When he steps out of the hall and into the war room, he’s shocked to see Mary sitting at the table, next to Cas, across from Sam and Jack. Everyone turns to look at him, and he gives Cas a questioning look –
“You didn’t make it awkward.” Castiel paused, initiating the kind of intense eye contact that usually made Dean squirm. “You’re beautiful.”
He attempts to smile. “I’ll try my damnedest not to die anytime soon.” He pauses, and looks like he wants to say something else.
But now Dean understood safe. His brief look into Castiel’s mind showed him that he was protected, guarded with such ferocity and intensity that he felt it in his bones.
“Oh?” Cas props himself up on one elbow and lifts an eyebrow, maybe trying for casual curiosity, but Dean can see something else behind it, something much more vulnerable. Much more human.
Cas didn’t know where to begin. He wasn’t sure which version of Dean this was, or if he had any clue what was going on. What could he say that wouldn’t cause him to panic? He put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean seemed surprised, hesitated for a moment, then put his hand on top of Cas’, as if to reassure him. As if Cas was the one who needed reassurance. “What is it, Cas?”
“I’m not just concerned for your safety,” Cas finally said. “I’m concerned that your feelings will change. Humans have proven themselves to be fickle.”
Dean’s expression made it very clear that he did not like to be bossed around by his little brother, but he sat down anyway, and set the rose back on the table.
Sorry it took me so long to update! I promise I have not abandoned this fic. This is a short chapter, with not much plot, but there is more to come soon.
is safe, and by his side, and taking care of him, giving him things he didn’t even know he needed. Dean wants so badly to be able to tell Cas how happy he is, how much all of this means to him, how he’s never felt so loved as he feels today. But he’s not good with words, never has been. So he just thinks about it, turns it over and over in his mind, hoping that somehow, Cas will feel it.
he is for this ridiculous mostly-angel. He keeps half an eye on Cas, and continues making their hot chocolate.
Sam smiled as he hung up. Maybe it was a good thing that Dean had called Charlie. He never would’ve done it himself, but it would be nice to have someone there with him when – if, he tried to tell himself– things got worse. On the other hand, he didn’t want to burden her with taking care of him as he inched toward his death. He pictured Charlie running around the bunker, bringing him water, making him soup, getting wet towels for his forehead, calling Dean in a panic, and trying to find containers for him to vomit into. If Sam continued on this downward slope, Charlie wasn’t signing up for a few days of hanging out, she was signing up for a few days of torture and the possibility of watching him die. Sam just hoped she understood that.
The table in the center of the bunker appeared to be completely covered in different varieties of pie, each with a handwritten label underneath. Sam scanned them, and his eyes widened. Key Lime from Chicago, IL. Lemon from Durham, NC. Caramel Apple from Portland, OR. Four Berry from Ann Arbor, MI.
Castiel didn’t know how much longer he could bear the tension in the motel room. In fact, it was more than tension; it was more like outright hostility. Dean had once referred to the three of them as a team, but now the term seemed far from applicable.
“Dean, I am aware that you have been intimate with a number of women. Anything you may have contracted – ”
In one stride he has his arms around my waist and his lips pressed to my forehead. “I know. I just meant 'cause you’re perfect."
In a private conversation months ago, Cas had – somewhat selfishly, he thought in retrospect – expressed his guilt to Sam for betraying their trust so many times. “You always thought you were doing the right thing,” Sam had said. “I know you didn’t want to hurt anyone.”
“Yeah. He’ll probably start acting all passive aggressive and saying, ‘No, everything’s fine,’ in that I’m Dean And I’m Angry voice, and then he’ll storm off or something.”
She smiles to herself and sits up in bed. She can hear Dean’s laughter coming from down the hall, and what sounds like Cas speaking loudly. But he sounds… happy? It’s not something she’s used to hearing. The only times she’s heard him raise his voice, he’s been angry. Now he sounds almost playful.
He was unsure whether he should call out for Dean or keep quiet. He walked for a while, weaving in between the trees, listening intently for movement and frequently looking over his shoulder. He wondered if Michael could conceal himself within the landscape of Dean’s mind. Would Michael already know that he was here?
If Cas was hurt, he hid it well. “Making jokes is a way that many people cope with things that make them uncomfortable. You’re uncomfortable with commitment, because you feel that you’ve failed the only people in your life who have ever mattered to you.”
“Dean, it’s okay,” Sam said gently, raising his eyebrows in concern. He knew that Dean would have a difficult time accepting the reality of Cas’ obvious feelings for him, but he had no idea that it would leave him completely unable to speak, as that was not a typical thing for Dean.
It was gentle, just the press of Dean’s lips against his, but with unmistakable fire behind it. Cas let out a startled groan, and Dean pulled back as though bracing for rejection. But Cas had other plans, and simply fisted his hand in Dean’s shirt to pull Dean down on top of him. They kissed again, and he could feel Dean’s slight smile against his mouth. But the satisfied flutter in Cas’ chest gave way to fear. Was this happiness? Would the Empty come for him now?
At first, I assume that his offer to talk is just his way of being courteous — it is three in the morning, after all, and regardless of our close relationship, Dean is not one for talking about feelings — but after I take a sip of milk and another bite of my sandwich, he’s looking at me expectantly. “It was a really stupid dream,” I say, and shrug. “It was just… upsetting to me, and I couldn’t get back to sleep afterwards.”
“So do you, smartass.” He lowers his head so our foreheads are pressed together and our noses are touching. I expect him to move away fairly quickly, but he simply closes his eyes and rubs the tip of his nose against mine. “After everything you’ve been through,” he says, “the scariest thing you can think of is relationship problems?”
They sat on one of the beds together, side by side, inches between them. Cas’ hand rested on Dean’s back, not moving, just a steady weight to ground him.
“I heard it ring. If it was dead, it would’ve gone straight to voicemail.” His knuckles clenched and unclenched around the steering wheel. “Try Sam’s phone.”
Castiel picked up the bill and put it in his coat pocket, but his expression remained the same. “Before I go, Sam, can I ask one more question?”
“Yeah, exactly. Second vic: Daniel White, 21. Went missing the same night they found Mendez’s body, from the same bar. He was there with some friends, and they said he left around midnight, acting really weird. The police didn’t find his body, but they found his car abandoned in an empty parking lot, with his blood all over the inside. There was enough blood that detectives say he definitely died of blood loss even if he managed to get away from his attacker. Ruled as a homicide. Third guy went missing a few days ago, left Ace’s around one a.m., and never showed up for work yesterday. At this point he’s just considered a missing person, but the cops are prepared for the worst, since it fits the pattern.”
“I know,” Sam says, doing that annoying face he does when he thinks Dean’s being oblivious. “So you two should go. Bring me back some peppermint bark.”
He was right. Dean didn’t want to leave him alone. He wanted to be by his side, with all the weapons in the Impala’s trunk well within reach in case this
Cas was suddenly very interested in the cement floor, studying the imperfections with his usual stoic expression. But Sam thought he saw the gleam of tears in the angel’s eyes.
Dean splutters. “N-no. But you could’ve just gone with what the cashier said. The girlfriend thing.”
Dean smiled to himself. Although it wasn’t great news that Cas couldn’t just locate the ghost with his angel radar, he always felt a little pride when Cas demonstrated hunting knowledge. Understanding that vengeful spirits were higher up on the food chain than your average ghost wasn’t exactly advanced material, but Dean still took it as a sign that Cas listened when he talked and was at least mildly interested in his work.
Sam slid a plate over to Dean with two eggs and a piece of toast, already buttered. Dean raised his eyebrows. “What’s the occasion, Suzy Homemaker?”
It was not, as they say, love at first sight. Once Dean was successfully saved, I still had to convince him to follow the path that God had chosen for him, and I am ashamed to say that at the time he was simply a pawn, even for me. My honor was at stake, and he and his insolence stood in my way. He was stubborn, irrational, and cynical. I hated him.
Dean opened his mouth to say something, maybe to ask Cas to stay. But he seemed to think better of it, and just said, “G’night, Cas.”
This seemed to sink in with Dean. He started to say something, then closed his mouth in defeat. “So if we’re in my head, then... are you real?” he finally said. “Or are you… me?”
“Um,” Sam said awkwardly. “I have it. Give me a minute.” He left the room, and Cas, Jack, and Rowena all looked at each other.
“I know you want to help,” Mary says to Jack, “but they’re in charge.” She gestures at Sam, Cas, and Dean. “They just want you to be safe.”
being around Dean, but of course it won’t be the same as talking to an equal. Dean feels something within him deflating, and tries to ignore it.
Dean was surprised to find that he didn’t feel guilty. At least, not for the kiss. Only for waiting so long to give in. He had enough to worry about without spending every waking moment trying to force himself back into denial. He knew how he felt about Castiel, and he had for a long time, but knowing something and coming to terms with it were two very different things.
“Jack was strong enough to wake you up from the Empty when he had his powers,” Dean pointed out. “Maybe if he gets juiced up again, he can kill it.”
“I don’t regret choosing you, Dean,” Cas continues. “I’m just sorry that I had to choose. Because it
to say to me, at least.” Dean sets his coffee mug down on the table and sits down next to Cas. “Or to Sammy. You didn’t even geek out with him over the research he was doing last night. You’re all broody.”
When Cas pulled his forehead away, Dean was jolted back into reality, and his face was streaked with tears that he didn’t realize he had been crying. Embarrassment washed over him, but he was still too stunned to move. Cas wiped his tears away gently and hushed him. “I’m sorry if that was overwhelming. I just wanted to answer your question as directly as possible.”
“Look, man, I know this thing sounds awful, but Cas has been wanting to go ever since he heard about it, so we can’t really bail on him now.”
“Yeah, okay, so before that. When you zapped me into that alley. When you thought I was gonna say yes to Michael.”
wanted to be the one to show Dean just how much love he deserved. And though he never thought he would admit it, there was lust. When his handprint on the hunter’s shoulder had healed, Cas had been more than a little disappointed. His mind often wandered when Dean removed his jacket, eyes fixed on the point where his shoulder met his neck, thinking of another type of mark he would leave on him if he ever got the chance.
Sam was quiet for a long time. When he spoke again, his voice was low and careful, but Dean recognized anger simmering under the surface.
“I don’t know that there’s much we can do about it,” says Cas. “That’s why I didn’t tell you before. And if I am falling, then at least this time it’s not entirely against my will.”
“Also, hi!” Charlie said, and stepped toward Cas with an awkward little wave. “I’m Charlie. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
They walk down the hall together, both of them grinning. Dean can’t keep his eyes off of the ring on his finger, and Cas can’t keep his eyes off of Dean.
“Inadvisable, dear,” Rowena said. “Any tampering with Michael’s grace could bring him back to the surface.”
At the casual mention of Ben and Lisa, Dean’s entire body flooded with rage. “Don’t you dare. Don’t you
Clearly Cas hadn’t hid his exhaustion as well as he’d hoped. “I knew it would be difficult. Besides, my grace will be replenished after a few days.”
They all looked at each other rather morosely, the uncertainty in the room palpable. “Well for goodness sakes, he hasn’t died yet,” Rowena said. “A little confidence, please.”
"I'm used to it," Dean muttered, sleepiness clearly taking its hold again. "You're like… a giant baby."
“You can start with your name,” Dean paused and threw in a wink for good measure. “And how long you’ve been working here.”
“No, Cas, it’s alright. You’ve been looking forward to it. I mean, look at you, you’re all… festive.”
I scoff. “I’m no longer an angel, Dean. The sin would be equivalent to infidelity to any other person.”
“We’re not in high school, Sam. So no, he didn’t ask me to go steady. Why does it matter to you anyway?”
“I’m saying it might not be an actual rift. Maybe it’s standing in for something else. Think about what the rift was, what it did.”
Although there wasn't any one thing that was the hardest, one of the hardest things was sleeping. Meditation was common among angels, but even its deepest states allowed for a shred of awareness that sleep could not provide. If one was meditating and sensed danger, the exercise could be broken fairly easily, whereas sleep was an entirely new level of vulnerability. Being unconscious was terrifying for Castiel. For the first few weeks, his mind fought sleep while his body craved it. Eventually, his body would win out for brief periods, and he would jerk awake, panicked, only to then remember that his grace was gone and that sleep would be the norm from then on.
obtuse. He knows Sam has been trying to get him and Cas to do stuff by themselves more. He just doesn’t want to think too hard about why.
If it hadn’t been for Dean Winchester, I would be telling a very different story. In fact, if it had been up to me, the
“Just up here,” Cas says, and points off to their right. The cabin is modest, a wood structure with dark green trim, framed by white birch trees on either side. It’s only a few rooms, from the looks of it, and Dean’s grateful that Cas didn’t splurge on anything too luxurious.
“Spend enough time around women and you’ll learn to recognize certain things,” he replies simply. Lisa had an irregular cycle and terrible cramps, and Dean has done runs like this a few times before. That’s the full answer. But he doesn’t want to talk about Lisa, and certainly not with Cas.
“Hey, if anyone can handle a midwest winter, it’s me. I just got spoiled with the heat in the bunker.” He drops his hands and steps away from the heater, mostly to show Cas that he’s not freezing or anything. “It’ll probably be plenty warm around midday tomorrow,” he adds. He wants to get in some fishing, preferably without turning into an icicle, but being stuck inside with Cas isn’t a bad prospect either.
Dean woke up on his back, still in his clothes. Although he would never admit it, he was disappointed when he reached out and felt the empty space on the other side of his bed. Cas hadn’t stayed. He retracted his arm and rubbed his eyes, which made gross squishing noises as he pressed on them. He could feel that they were still swollen and tender from falling asleep crying.
Dean turned around and smiled, looking genuinely happy to see him. He didn’t seem to question Cas’ arrival. Cas knew this theoretically could be Michael, but his instinct said it was the real Dean. He let go of his weapon and walked to the middle of the clearing.
Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had been so open with someone, and part of him wanted to run screaming from the room, but part of him felt okay. He figured that it might be because Cas was a little clueless when it came to human customs sometimes: he didn’t know what would be considered awkward, so he wouldn’t know to judge Dean for it. And he hadn’t been dragged through the kind of macho bullshit that was practically beaten into Dean as a kid, so he wouldn’t accuse him of being unmanly or anything. Even if it was just due to Cas’ innocence, Dean knew he wouldn’t be criticized. And that felt good, even if all this emotional availability crap scared him half to death.
When I was named as one of those whose mission it was to raise the Righteous Man from hell, I wondered why God would send a broken angel to rescue a broken man. I considered confessing my irreverent thoughts to my superiors, but I was too selfish to do so. I wanted to prove to myself that I could fulfill my cause, that I was worthy of serving heaven.
She sighed and scooted further onto the bed, lying down beside him and turning to face him, her hands tucked under her head. “Eat,” she nagged again, and Sam rolled his eyes. She kept her expression stern until he took a cautious bite. When he seemed to be okay, she continued. “So where did the lovebirds have to run off to, anyway?”
Dean seemed to be attempting to say something, but only a low croaking sound came from his open mouth as he turned the rose over between his fingers. He finally looked up at Sam, and managed to lift his empty hand to gesture at the pie-covered table.
Dean felt an odd rush of affection for Cas at that. He’d never been with someone who would do research in order to prepare for the
Dean’s eyes were dangerously close to watering, and he blinked repeatedly. “So whatever this is… I’m not alone in it?”
It’s the closest he can get to saying ‘I love you’ (at least for now), but based on the way Cas’ expression softens, Dean thinks he understands the intended meaning.
Dean shook his head. “I would’ve noticed if she followed us here last night. And I would hope you would’ve noticed, too.”
“I know what you’re thinking, Dean,” Cas says. “And of course, I consider you family as well. But please try to understand that for millennia, I had another family. And over time I have grown separated from them – in part, due to my own choices. I enjoy your and Sam’s company very much. But it’s painful to know that I may never have another angel as a companion.”
Dean tried his best to summon the fires of hell and direct them all at Castiel in an enraged glare, but if he was being honest with himself, he probably looked how he felt: desperate. Regardless, he moved past Cas and grabbed the suit out of his bag, avoiding eye contact as he walked to the bathroom and slid the door shut. He heard nothing but silence outside the door as he changed, though he became vaguely aware that he was muttering to himself as he tucked his shirt in. When he was finished changing he slid the door open again and stayed facing the mirror to tie his tie, back turned to Cas.
I run my fingers through his hair. “All that time didn’t amount to much. I’ve only just started living. I’d appreciate it if I didn’t lose you now.”
Castiel’s body language shifted towards something that Dean couldn’t quite name, but it put knots in Dean’s stomach, and his heart rate climbed instantly. Cas seemed to sense Dean’s panic, and softened his expression, but continued to move forward as he licked his lips and leaned in to press a kiss against the veins in Dean’s neck. Dean would never admit to the gasp that left his mouth, or the way he could feel his heart hammering in his chest, or the rush of adrenaline that flooded his system just from the angel’s touch.
In stark contrast to the rest of the house, the attached bathroom looks like it has been recently renovated. Dean steps inside and admires the enormous shower with glass doors. “We’ll see if the water pressure is as good as it is at home,” he says with a wink. Cas smiles.
They parked the Impala in the alleyway, and for a few hours they just sat there, staring at the empty lot behind the bar. Occasionally, an employee would step outside for a cigarette, or to toss a bag of garbage into the dumpster, but no one looked suspicious. Dean fell asleep around nine o’clock, probably from boredom, and Castiel was content with listening to his slow, even breathing.
This was clearly the right thing to say, because Cas looks at him like he hung the friggin’ moon. It’s too much, and Dean decides it’s a good time to get out of the car. His knees crack as he stands up, his legs stiff after several hours of driving, and he smirks to himself —
Besides, he had finally confessed his love for his hunter. And maybe that would be enough to keep him sane for a while.
Dean is relieved. Cas doesn’t see him as some debt he has to pay off. But he also feels like a dick. He reaches up to pull Cas’ hand away from his face, ignoring the fluttering in his stomach that ensues when their hands touch. “I’m sorry, Cas, this was supposed to be about you and why you’re upset.”
Despite Sam’s protests, Charlie made him lean on her shoulder and helped to walk him back to bed. Once he was lying down, she brought him a glass of water and started bugging him about food.
Still, I served heaven to the best of my ability. There was something almost honorable in my stillness, perhaps a sense of pride for containing the strange and blasphemous urges to which I have always been susceptible; for millennia I wanted nothing more than to wring out the grief from the world, and for millennia I watched with carefully forged stoicism, aware that my compassion exceeded that which was acceptable for my kind. I learned early on in my existence that I was flawed, and when I could not change it, I found ways to hide it.
Eventually, they reached another clearing. Cas was afraid it might be the same one as before, but instead of the Impala, the center of this clearing held something that made them both stop in their tracks.
Dean tried to detect guilt or nervousness in Tammy’s voice, but found nothing. She seemed sincere. Maybe the guys really were just dicks. And that would explain why a vengeful spirit might be after them. Maybe Nick went vengeful because he died so soon after his fight with them. But what, exactly, warranted their deaths for him? Sprits didn’t usually go vengeful over spilled milk. The fight had to have been over something huge.
Castiel got up from his chair and walked slowly over to the bed where Dean was still lying on his back, arms tucked behind his head. Cas sat on the edge of the bed, and Dean looked like he was afraid he might smite him.
Dean swallowed and nodded. The guilt hanging over him was palpable, and Cas knew exactly what he was thinking – they had sent Garth on this mission, and he had ended up hurt, separated from his family. Cas was about to assure him that it wasn’t his fault, but Dean spoke first. “Sorry you had to see all of that, in my head. Especially purgatory. That, uh, wasn’t a good time for either of us.”
The drive to Lincoln was filled with pleasant tension, and Dean wasn’t sure if it was from being on a hunt again, or from being in a confined space with Cas for so long. Maybe it was a little of both. Either way, it had Dean’s blood buzzing. Unlike Sam, Cas didn’t protest when Dean turned the music up loud and sang along – he even smiled. There was no judgment in it, just genuine contentment from seeing Dean so relaxed and happy. It was a miracle for both of them.
She got up and left the room, and came back with a sleeve of soda crackers. “You’re going to eat two of these now, and see how you feel,” she said, handing them to Sam and sitting down on the bed. “I think I already know the answer to this,” she said, “but why aren’t we taking you to the hospital?”
When Dean finally spills into Cas’ hand, Cas murmurs incoherent praise against his shoulder and follows a moment later. They collapse into each other, and Dean doesn’t loosen his vice grip on Cas’ arm until their breathing slows. He runs his fingers along the indents in Cas’ skin where he dug in his nails. “Sorry,” he mutters.
“Sammy, even if we finish this, there are still a million other creepy sons of bitches out there. Wendigos. Rugarus. Vampires. Are we just supposed to let them walk?”
Or maybe it wasn’t physical intimacy Cas had been afraid of in the first place. Maybe that was just one of
“Hey there,” Dean said, trying for a tone that was both businesslike and friendly. “Why are you tailing us?”
Have they always sounded like this? Like a couple? Dean can’t be sure, because everything feels different. Every word spoken and every glance shared between them is shaped a little differently, takes up more space in the air, now that Dean can see the potential they hold.
