“Do you think he will give evidence?” Sam asked. “I mean, its no shame on Cas if he can’t… I don’t even want to think how hard its going to be for him.”
“I need to know what your brother wants from this settlement, so I can start planning for the trial.”
The line went dead. Cas had hung up and Dean was just left feeling a bit confused.
“Well I better call Sammy.” Dean smiled, jumping up from the couch.
“Ok, so it’ll be a one-day road trip.”
“I’d have preferred to do this in the light but…”
Dean grinned, his chest swelling with so many emotions. “Not possible.” He choked out.
“Oh Cas, you can’t keep doing that to yourself.” Dean said sadly.
“Are you Sick Cas. Have you been eating properly?” Eileen interjected. Sam was trying to be sensitive, but Eileen knew they needed to be direct.
“I deserved it Dean. I was unfaithful.”
“Shame.” The man said, but Cas could barely catch the words, he felt detached from his body like he was floating. “Because they really are eager to meet you.”
Cas apologised for everything and although Sam found his friend adorable for it, it also saddened him greatly. He knew it was a remnant of the family and the past he rarely talked about. That guy had been through hell.
Dean breathed into his fiancés shoulder, holding him tightly as the relief poured out of him. He had stayed up all night worrying something had happened. Cas had never stayed mad with Dean for as long as he had yesterday. He’d called and called and called Cas’ cell, to no answer. He’d even texted Sam and Charlie and nearly called Jody to put out an APB or something but had decided against it. He figured Cas needed some space and now he was just over the moon to have him back in his arms.
“I’ve not been feeling well recently.” Cas admitted. Sam raised his eyebrow asking for more information. “Nausea, fatigue, feeling a bit dizzy. I just thought I was tired you know. I am tired. But eating just makes me feel sick, so I haven’t really been eating much.”
“Guys please stop!”
Quite frankly, he hated it. He hated his new job. All he wanted was to go back downstairs and tinker with the cars, talk to customers and Cas’ constant call’s and texts were grating on him to the point he just stopped answering them. He was trying to work and Cas couldn’t stop distracting him.
“Why is it taking so long.” He growled, passing Sam, who was sat reading, for the umpteenth time in the two hours that had passed. “And how are you staying so goddamn calm!”
By the time Dean had come home late the next evening, Cas didn’t feel like telling him about being sick, he looked too tired and stressed. Cas cooked that night for Dean, but despite the doctor’s orders he still couldn’t force himself to eat, the nausea was overwhelming. Instead of even trying to sleep Cas lay awake watching his husband sleep. That’s when he noticed a few things. Dean didn’t even lie close to him anymore, he stayed at the edge of the bed, leaving a cold and empty gap between them. Dean had always been a clingy sleeper, but now there wasn’t so much as a word or a hair ruffle when he got in or out of bed with Cas.
“I’m sorry Cas, I just didn’t think.” Dean said, mortified at his own inconsiderateness. “I’ll make sure you can see me at all times and I’ll, I won’t hold you like that…”
“You were amazing Cas and now you are broken! You can’t expect me to believe that this is worth all of that.”
“Cassie!” Gabriel protested.
“I would like that.” Cas admitted. “But its not very practical.” He sighed with a smile.
“How are you feeling?”
“Cas, talk to me.” Dean asked urgently.
“No Dean.”
Cas sighed. “I’m just tired guys. There’s nothing to worry about. I might have forgotten a few meals because I was rushed…”
“That’s not what I meant, I can’t either…But do you really think that’s what he might try and do?”
Dean didn’t come home that night either. Nor did he reply. Cas lay alone in bed and shivered with cold and fever, thinking of Dean.
“Thank God.” Sam could hear the emotion in Gabriel’s voice. He’d been through hell, Cas had been through hell and all of this was just the biggest mess up he’d ever heard of.
“For how long this time.” Cas sighed.
Cas sat in the back seat of Jody’s car without prompting. Its like he was trying to stay as far away from her as possible, but she knew it wasn’t personal, not after what he had just been through. He spent the whole car journey looking terrified, not saying a word and frankly breaking Jody’s heart.
“Cas.” Dean chuckled. “Pretty sure I already asked you that question and gave you the ring... twice.”
“Dean where are we going?” Cas asked looking out the window. They were headed in the complete opposite direction to the apartment they’d been renting the past few months since Cas had gotten the all clear and Cas was tired. After months of having his body attacked by poisonous chemicals, he still got tired quite easily, but it wasn’t so bad now.
Those damn blue eyes. You couldn’t say no them and she had to tred carefully or Cas would dig his heels in.
“Ok, Gabriel. Well they’ve set a court date to discuss the financial settlement. It’s on July 10
“Why?”
The driver smiled. “I know a place. You look like you need a drink.”
“The list for transplants is very long. It could be years until we find a kidney for your brother and this treatment course, you are looking at 2 months in hospital, but the kidney is salvageable. You’ll be returning to a healthy, normal life if treatment is successful. Believe me saving you original kidney is much preferable than spending the rest of your life on antirejection drugs.”
…………………………………………
Just a short update this chapter, but leaving this up with only one chapter doesn't feel right, so here's a little more.
“I don’t care.”
“Yeah, ok.”
“2 hours.” Gabriel said, checking the countdown on his phone.
His parents had seen their Son’s talent as a way of redeeming their family in God’s eyes from the shame of their son’s sexuality. They had taken control of everything, made him train every day, sleep early, never go out and controlled his meals to the point where he was starving. If he had a bad race, they would refuse him that day’s meals. Of course that only made things worse.
“Make me.” Gabriel said playfully. “I’ll see you on Friday, you take it easy, look after yourself.”
“Gabriel.” Castiel looked up into the eyes of his smaller, older brother. “What are you doing here?”
As he struggled to open his eyes the freezing air of the night seeped into his wet clothes and he gasped in shock. He was cold. So very cold and tired. It was like the ice had got inside him and frozen him to his core. The warm hands that were framing his face burnt his numb and sensitive skin. Everything hurt down to his bones, but the outline above him made it all worthwhile.
“I’d do chick flick moments for you.”
Cas walked into the apartment and tossed his keys in the bowl. It was lunch hour, but he wasn’t hungry. The nausea and dizziness had only been getting worse, so much so he’d stopped making lunch for himself. Thinking about it, he hadn’t eaten in 3 days now, just the odd protein shake, which was about all he could stomach.
“Cas where the hell where you? I was so worried.” Dean opened the door and immediately pulled Cas into their flat and straight into a hug. “Thank God you’re ok. I’m so, so sorry about yesterday I was such an ass… what I said wasn’t how I meant it at all.” Dean sighed, praying that Cas would forgive him. “I just really struggle to understand you sometimes baby and I don’t always understand how you can be happy with screw up like me.”
“Crap.” He groaned as his body folded. Cas crumpled, head hitting the floor with a thwack.
“No.”
“No Dean, you don’t get to ask for anything, not after how you’ve treated him…”
“Anyway, that’s great news. I love you baby brother.”
He pulled his clothing back into place with shaking fingers, tears sliding down his cheeks. It took all his strength. He didn’t know if he could stand. He had never felt so exhausted in his life, or so ashamed. After all this time, saving himself for Dean, now he was ruined, defiled. Dean would never want him after this. No one would. He didn’t even have the strength to sob.
“Cas, baby what’s wrong?” Dean frowned, tied between going to comfort Cas and staying well back.
“Dude, are you ok? You look really ill.” Sam asked concerned.
“But…”
“Oh, Cas no he won’t.” Jody stroked his hair instinctively and Cas flinched away violently, his eyes wide and terrified. “I’m sorry.” She backed away. Cas was too out of it to think straight, but he needed help.
“Cas look at me. Can you hear me?”
Gabriel didn’t want to leave Cas alone, but Cas had insisted he was fine and he would take it easy. But as soon as Gabriel arrived at his motel he rang his brother back up.
Sam glanced across at Cas who was signing something to Eileen. He loved how Cas, the linguist had picked up sign language the instant Sam had started dating Eileen. He’d actually taught Sam most of what he knew. The T-shirt was hanging off him loosely and suddenly Sam twigged.
“Find a hole to crawl into and die.” Gabriel shrugged.
“Oh, man sorry I disturbed you.”
Sorry to keep you waiting on this... and sorry about the excessive amount of dialogue, but hopefully this is the point you've all been waiting for. Time for our boys to use their words.
……………………
“Gabriel I’ll be ok.” Cas said softly.
“Dean, I think you’re underestimating how hard running a business is going to be. You can’t take a second job on. And now you’re the manager of a business, I expect you to be paying yourself a much bigger salary than mine.” Cas reassured. “And yes, it does make a difference. This job will be the difference between us having electricity or not.”
“Do we know how it’s going?”
“Yes. It seems that way.”
“Hello Sammy, to what do I owe this?” He said with a smile.
“Sam.” The short man greeted, taking the ever-present lollipop out of his mouth
“Anyway, I was just here to invite you both to Dinner at ours on Sunday evening. It’s been way too long.”
“He just said some things… things about me that I didn’t know bothered him.”
“Why am I crying?” Dean asked in disbelief. “Because I thought I’d lost you, you idiot.” Dean stroked the back of Cas’ head and squeezed him tighter as if he would never let go again. “How could you let me think that, huh? Let me think you’d cheated, let me call you those awful things when you’d just been…” Dean’s voice broke as he failed to finish the sentence.
“No, late as usual.”
………………………………….
“He was bad Dean... he just…” But it was clear Gabriel wasn’t going to finish.
This time when Cas woke up he was warm. He knew he was safe. The feeling of something heavy wrapped around him should have been a cause for panic, but it wasn’t. He didn’t know why, until he did, and the familiar smell of home met his tired addled brain. That smell was Dean.
Sam helped Cas to his feet and Eileen fetched his coat, draping it carefully over his shivering frame. They arrived at Cas and Dean’s apartment just after midnight and Sam made sure he got in safely.
“For Cas, Dean.” Sam said, looking at his older brother with puppy dog eyes.
“Yeah?”
“Yeah well, you better get well soon, because being this organised is definitely killing me.”
“Nothing. It’s just… That’s what Dean calls it.”
Dean’s face softened in understanding. “Did he say yes?” He asked hopefully.
“No Cas, I’m not going anywhere. I’ve got you. I’ll keep you safe.”
Cas was not ok.
“I know I couldn’t.” Gabriel sighed.
“What happened?” Dean asked, more calmly.
“Yes, Mr. Novak. You have been experiencing weight loss, swelling ankles, nausea, fatigue?”
“Right, well I’ll call you back when I’ve talked to Dean and made some sense of it all.” Sam offered.
“I deserve it.”
“It’s fine I’ll give it to him.”
Dean pulled the phone away from his ear and sobbed out loud.
“Yes, Dean I do.” He nodded solemnly. “Not right away. But I think we should set a date, maybe next year so we have plenty of time. But I would like to start planning, I need something… I need something to work towards, to look forward to. I want to get better, I want to be better by our wedding.”
“How far is the furthest you’ve walked with him?”
“I handled I badly Bobby, I should have called an ambulance straight away.”
“OK, don’t panic I’ll ring her, he can’t have gone far Gabriel and he’s not stupid...”
“If that’s ok?” Cas asked tentatively.
“So, Dean thought I was cheating on him because of the phone call, they found out I was ill from my old job and Sam doesn’t think Dean was cheating on me?”
“Nothing fancy. 4am-10am, Saturday at the Gas station
“Cancer.” Castiel’s shoulder’s sunk. They couldn’t afford cancer treatment. Not even with the insurance.
“Yeah. It would be nice to see him. Let me make the call, it will come better from me.”
“Dean.” Sam grabbed his brother before he started to punch the wall and did the usual damage to his knuckles in frustration. “I am so sorry Dean I really am. I still can’t believe that Cas cheated on you, I know how much you loved him.”
“Yes, things have finally settled down at the shop, I should be back to regular hours.” Dean said, trying not to let his voice break with the emotions that were boiling inside him.
“Nope not leaving you. Even for that. You’ll have to get used to it.” Dean huffed, and Cas chuckled again.
“We.” Dean said firmly. “Cas, I couldn’t have done this without you. You poured every cent you had into this, I can’t thank you enough. I swear you will get it all back.”
“There are so many ways we could fix this. We could sell to someone we trust, employ a manager and let you go back to being a mechanic…”
Gabriel knew what they were talking about. He couldn’t hear much of the conversation, but he knew what they were asking of him and he could see the fear in his little brother’s face through the glass in the door. Dean was trying, Gabriel knew that, and he was the best person to offer Cas comfort right now, but Gabriel, despite knowing it wasn’t Dean’s fault was still angry at the guy. Ok, maybe it wasn’t Dean he was really angry with, but without the real villains to focus on he had to be angry at something or he’d explode.
“Only you could be worried about someone else during all this.” Dean smirked.
“I’m not going to lie and say that its Ok Dean. Getting that letter… it was crushing. I nearly gave up there and then and if it wasn’t for Gabriel I wouldn’t have even bothered getting treatment.”
He got out his old spreadsheet and modified that with the new sales and salaries and stared at the numbers.
“Sounds like an admission of guilt.” Sam furrowed his brow. When he’d seen Gabriel at the apartment he’d been certain there was more to his. But apparently Cas had resigned at the DOD, all his stuff was gone from the apartment and he was living was his brother in Atlanta. It all seemed pretty clear cut. Cas had upped and left, probably to be with his new man, leaving Dean to suffer alone.
“Come over to mine and we’ll talk this through.”
“I know.” He smiled sadly. “Let’s get you back home and then maybe Deano can make you some of his infamous burgers.”
“Dean’s working, taking on Singer’s place, the debt… Cas’ working two jobs, he’s just worn out. The business is raking it in though, so it won’t be long before things go back to normal.”
“It wasn’t my fault.” Cas said easily. And it wasn’t. It wasn’t his fault. He’d never wanted this to happen, he’d have stopped it if he could have. He’d been drugged, he’d been raped. This wasn’t his fault. “It wasn’t my fault.” He breathed, this time believing the words. “It wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t my fault.” Then his voice broke in a sob. “It wasn’t my fault Dean, it wasn’t… I didn’t… Why Dean? Why did this happen? I didn’t do anything wrong but still I…”
“You know the trial is in two days, right?”
“You didn’t throw him out…”
……………………………
Cas had gone back to work after a few days of rest. But he wasn’t feeling any better. In fact, he was feeling worse and he was running out of sick days.
“I don’t want to do that Dean.” Cas said abruptly and Dean took a shocked step back.
“Nicely put Dean, but yes. Apart from it’s not tight anymore. It’s too big.”
“Boys please.” Jody begged, but they all ignored her.
“Ok…” He started, not wanting to jump to any conclusions, but worry curled in his stomach.
Gabriel nearly snorted. “Don’t you worry your pretty little head about me Sammich. Save your prayers for my brother.” He said as he hung up the phone.
“Yeah well I’ve picked up a job for the weekends to help us manage.”
“Ok, Dean, where are you?”
“I can’t pretend that nothing happened Sammy, its not right, not for him or for me." Dean sighed.
Lost in his thoughts, he suddenly realised how tense Cas was in his arms. His love was practically shaking. He pulled away quickly, looking Cas up and down in concern. He didn’t get far in his observations though as the moment Cas saw Dean silent tears started rolling down his cheeks.
“Are you feeling better? Sam said you had the flu. Baby, you look awful.” Dean said, taking in his husband’s appearance for the first time in a long time and it was true. Cas was thin and pale he looked exhausted.
Sorry! You'll have to wait a little bit because I really have to update my other 3 stories else my followers will lynch me. Thanks for reading. Remember comments make me write faster.
“It’s ok Dean, I’ll go around there, is Sam with you, can he drive you?”
“Yeah, yeah of course. See you on Saturday.”
“I’ll go pull Baby around.” Dean said with a smiled, planting a soft kiss to Cas’ forehead. “Will you be good without me for a few minutes?”
“I always cook, Dean. Though it’s usually for myself since you live on take out, which you can’t do anymore by the way, it’s too expensive.”
“All ours Baby.” Dean smiled at the speechless Cas, suddenly grabbing him and sweeping him off his feet.
“It’s fine Dean. I know how much you wanted this and if the sales figures are as good as you think they’ll be, then it won’t be for long.”
“I talked to Cas, Dean, the other day. I don’t want to sound like I’m stepping on your toes, you are doing a wonderful job of supporting Cas, he wouldn’t be able to cope without you, but that doesn’t mean he’s magically alright.”
Cas’ face fell.
“Did she tell you they think the barman was in on it to? She has the place under surveillance, hopefully he’ll do something to incriminate himself soon.”
“I had the flu last week.” Cas started. “I just must have gone back too early, I felt a bit faint and dizzy then I woke up here.”
Dean breathed a shaky sigh of relief.
“Dean you know very well I can look after myself and we can’t be using ‘baby’ for short trips and wasting fuel.”
“No, I’m calling you disabled.”
“It’s Dean and Castiel.”
“Yeah I am desperate to pull a good prank right now. Do you want to tell anyone yet Cas? Balthazar maybe?”
“Yeah, no…” Dean stuttered. “It doesn’t matter. I’m busy Monday.” Dean started backing towards the door.
“Goddamn it!” Dean yelled and kicked flowerpot across the yard and it smashed noisily.
“Gabriel, get off… No.” It was now Cas’ turn to have his phone snatched away as the two elder brothers were thrown into conversation.
Cas was curled on his side tightly gripping the blankets, skin pale and eyes glassy. Dean frowned as crouched by the bed and Cas looked right through him as if he couldn’t see.
“I know, we’ll get you warm soon I promise.”
“Eloquent.”
After 3 months Cas realised he hadn’t actually spoken to his husband for anything more than a sleepy grunt in 3 weeks. He was lonely, stressed and tired, but he knew that in a few more weeks everything would start getting better.
“Gabriel please.” Cas begged.
Sam sighed with relief. “That’s good. Ok….”
“Cas…” Dean said, the heartbreak evident in his voice.
“I… I’m not sure I want to see him.” Cas said sadly. “What if he was cheating on me, I… I don’t think I could take it, not on top of everything else.”
Gabriel sighed and brushed a tear from his brother’s cheek. “Now Cas, while you were in surgery… some stuff happened.”
Dean’s shoulders sunk. Cas was right of course. Dean would happily tear these men limb from limb if Sam would tell me who they were, but he and Cas were very different people. Dean let his emotions run riot, meaning revenge was often high on his list of priorities, but Cas was logical and calculating, it was why he'd often been called the ice man back in his running days and not in an endearing way.
“Hey Sammy, how are you?” Dean was delighted but surprised to see his younger brother.
“Dean, we’ve already rung round everyone he knows… no one’s seen him and, he’s not at the house, Gabriel’s just been there...” Sam explained.
Dean was on cloud nine. He’d finally done it. He was the owner and manager of his own business. It was a complete turn-around from two months ago. When Bobby Singer, who ran the car dealership and garage where Dean had worked as a mechanic, decided to retire and sell up, the main candidate for the sale was a redeveloper who wanted to level it and build luxury apartments. They’d all been about to lose their jobs before Dean had a crazy idea.
“Dean, Dean talk to me.”
“You get Pie?”
“And tired Dean, so very tired.” Cas started to trail off and Dean gave him a rough shake.
…………………………………………..
“Mr. Novak, it’s good to see you.”
“Mr. Novak…”
Sam sighed. “I will fight for you Dean, but I know people, good divorce lawyers who will crush Bela.”
Dean looked up as there was a knock at his door.
“You’re a cripple Cas! You still struggle on the stairs! You used to run marathons and now I have to carry you around when you get tired.”
Sam took one look at his brother’s face and knew something was wrong. He was staring intently at a letter in front of him.
Sam was all but ready to tear his older brother a new one the next morning. This situation was ridiculous.
“That’s really not helpful Gabriel.” Jody growled.
“I know, so am I.” Dean sighed, brushing strands of Cas’ hair out of his face tenderly. “I’m so sorry I made you feel like that, I’m so sorry that you were scared to tell me what happened, but Cas if you had just told me, I wouldn’t have been angry, not at you anyway only at them. I’d have been there for you Cas.” Tears were now tracking down Dean’s cheeks and Cas lifted a finger to wipe them away. He hated hurting Dean. “I want to be there for you. I love you.”
“I need you to say it Cas.” Dean demanded as he breathed warm air over Cas’ blue hands and gently rubbed them, before returning to rub his chest.
“How does that make you feel angel?” He asked, warily.
“Gabriel please… I don’t know for sure he’s cheating and even if I’m right I still love him. Even if he doesn’t love me back, I will always love him.”
Jody looked at her phone flicking between the two numbers, Dean or Cas. She had left it this long to call but having not heard anything from Cas she thought it was about time she checked he was ok. Hopefully they were at the damn hospital getting Cas seen to, but she had to know what was going on, she still hadn’t slept and had taken the day off work, though a text from her deputy told her that apparently they had found a fair bit of DNA evidence in that alley that would help get a conviction.
The guy looked wrecked. He was in his usual suit, but without the coat and jacket. His dress shirt was crumpled and half unbuttoned, his tie deliberately loosened and his already untameable black hair was sticking up at all angles.
His life back then had been miserable, the only thing he looked forward to was seeing his friends at school. Dean, Sam, Charlie and Kevin had made his life bearable without even knowing it. The only freedom his parents allowed him was in his running, so he spent every spare minute training. By the time he, Sam and Kevin reached college Castiel was a scholarship athlete with a very real shot at the Olympics. Marathon had become his specialism. Dean was a mechanic, staying behind as the rest of them went to Stanford.
“If it makes you Happy Cas, then I suppose I can tolerate it. Especially when we become rich.”
As the paramedics moved to lift Cas onto a stretcher Dean momentarily had to let go of his fiancées hand.
Dean pulled his shaking hand back up to his ear.
“Yes, I did, but I promised Gabriel I would never try to kill myself again, so I left it up to God to decide.”
“We need gas, I forgot to fill her up. Might as well get some snacks too.”
“Yeah, we are, how do you know?” Sam asked with a wary smile.
“Yes, we are Angel.” Dean smiled. “Yes, we are.”
“Jody?” Dean answered in a confused tone.
“Yes Dean, that’s good, it means he’s warming up, keep doing what you’re doing.” Jody encouraged.
“I’m not sure, but if you’re making burgers I’ll try and eat.”
“That’s Good.” Sam nodded. He was still reluctant to leave, but after some persuasion and assurance from Cas he did decide to leave. And Cas did intend to call Dean, he really did, but then he figured Dean would be home for lunch and they could talk then.
“Of course, I do you beautiful idiot.” Dean sighed pressing a kiss into Cas’ hair and then he reached into his pocket, pulling out the ring he’d taken from Cas two days ago. “Part of me wanted you to wake up with this back on your finger, so the moment you woke up you would know I loved you and I would never let you go again.” He sighed sadly. “But another part wanted to do this properly so…” Dean slid off the bed and got down on one knee like he had only months ago. “Will you marry me?”
“Whatever.” Gabriel rolled his eyes. How Balthazar could be so cheerful even with this going on, he would never understand, and it was starting to great on him. As he stepped outside he breathed in the fresh air, but the worry didn’t melt away in the slightest. He turned on his phone for a distraction and groaned when he saw the 5 missed calls from none other than Sam Winchester. This couldn’t be good and he doubted strongly that he was supposed to be talking to him so close to the settlement healing.
“I really don’t care Sam, what I care is that no one has seen him since and his phone is going straight to voicemail. Where would he go?”
“I can’t do it alone.” Cas sighed. “And I don’t want Dean to… you’ve seen me at my worst, I… I’m not ready for Dean to see that.”
“Cas, what’s wrong.” Oh, it was good to hear Dean’s voice, but Dean’s tone didn’t seem to return the thought and that killed Cas’ good mood instantly.
“God Dean, you look nearly as worn out as Cas does.” Those words bit a little at Dean’s insides.
I have always intended to potentially write a prequel t this back in the college days showing how Dean and Cas got together and more about Cas' background and the injury etc. Is that something you guys want to see.
“That’s private.” Gabriel said calmly.
“I don’t know if I could do it.” Sam said quietly. “He’s being so brave.”
“Cas, what happened to you, does not make you disgusting.” Dean said firmly. “They are the only ones who are disgusting. You are not ruined and as for you saving yourself… Sex should be about making love Cas, what happened to you was not making love, so the way I look at it those guys haven’t taken that from you, they never could. And unless your God is a colossal asshole…”
“You know me Sam. I’m incapable of it.”
“Me too Baby bro,
“Dean.” Cas sighed contentedly, but then tears started welling in his eyes as it all came flooding back. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” He sniffed, turning his head away and trying to bury his face in the pillow. But a gentle hand on his chin turned his head back to face his fiancé… if they still were together. Cas wasn’t so sure anymore.
“I can’t imagine.” Sam said sincerely. He knew what a stress money could be. “It’ll be worth it though, I’m sure.” Sam’s brow furrowed. He’d just told Dean his beloved husband wasn’t looking well and he’d barely got a rise. Even when Sam had still been at college, before Cas and Dean had been going out Dean was furiously protective of Cas. He’s get mad if Cas had so much as a papercut.
“I feel horrible for saying this after everything we both sacrificed to make this work…”
“No Cas. Don’t bother.” He tutted. “You’re disgusting.” He mumbled and walked away.
“Even if I had?” Dean said in disbelief.
“Yes, please, tell him I’m coming, tell I’m sorry I….” Dean choked.
“I found him outside O’Malley’s.” Jody said sadly. “I think someone had spiked his drink. He didn’t say much, but it was obvious from the marks on him that he’d... what had happened. He asked me to take him home to you, he was terrified.”
“Or Sam. He’ll just tell Dean. Or Charlie, she’ll be upset…” Cas sniffled.
He was interrupted by a knock on the door.
“Then call in sick. Come on.”
“Safe.” Cas mumbled. “Warm.” His shivers weren’t subsiding and now he seemed to be fading a little. Jody’s expression of worry urged Dean to keep him talking.
“Sheriff Mills, what can I do for you?”
“Cas has been forgetting to eat, or too busy, then he got sick and couldn’t eat. Me and Eileen had to intervene and get him to admit it. Then I had to make him take the week off work and take him to the Doctor’s for a check-up, because he wouldn’t have done himself. He’s just kept working himself into the ground. You know what he’s like Dean and you are the one who usually stops him going along this road. Let me just ask you this Dean, if you haven’t seen him in 3 weeks, who the hell do you think would be looking out for him?”
“I’m pretty sure.”
“Oh, I bet he’s mad at you.”
“What the actual fuck are you talking about?” Gabriel spats.
“Dean?” Cas breathed. His voice was soft and weak and hoarse, laced with confusion. If Dean was here, then surely that meant he had died… and gone to heaven? That didn’t quite fit though. It was more likely this was hell and the start of an ever-lasting torment the devil had devised for him. Here was Dean, showing him love giving him hope, so it was only a matter of time before he heard the words of truth spill from Deans mouth. Words telling him the full extent of his sin and indiscretions, that would burn him, hurt more than anything else could if they were said by the man he loved. This was to be his eternity he could feel it.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Of course, Dean. Go.”
“I think you and Dean should start driving.”
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas smiled weakly as he left the room.
“God.” Bobby breathed barely audibly. “So, what happened, why is he missing?”
“No thanks.” Cas grunted.
“So, my kidneys were already failing?”
“Hello, Singer’s Auto’s.”
“Yes Sam I’m fine.” Cas said with a weak smile, washing up a plate absent-mindedly.
“That’s what Cas would do.” He sighed.
Dean’s heart shattered. Into a thousand pieces. All of this, was for nothing. He’d hurt Castiel for nothing, because he’d been rash and jumped to conclusions. Why hadn’t he just asked him?
“You’ll tell him eventually though right?”
“Why the hell not?”
“Dean please, I just need to know now…” Cas begged, his voice breaking.
“Hey.” Cas answered tiredly.
“Well yes, I know it’s not been long, but I have some numbers I can give him, hotlines and the like and I know a really good counsellor who has a lot of experience…”
“Being held helps though.” Cas protested. “It makes me feel wanted.” He said, looking a little ashamed.
The door slammed shut.
“Look, can I start from the beginning please?” Gabriel said a little annoyed.
He wished Dean had never saved him, then he would never have to have hurt Dean like that. Castiel always ended up hurting the ones he loved. It was his curse. It was why he had to stop now.
“I’ve never seen you so organised.” Cas chuckled slipping the tubes of his nasal cannula over his ears. He had to admit the extra oxygen made him feel better. The chemo had made his red blood cell count drop and as a result, his blood oxygen was rather low.
In February Cas had started throwing up, in his typical manner he’d passed it off as a stomach bug, until he couldn’t. Dean had rushed him straight to the hospital and the cancer was back, with a vengeance apparently. More Chemo, more hospital hours, more of his husband putting on a brave face…
“You can stay as long as you need.” Dean opened his eyes to see Eileen had arrived home and had been reading his lips. “But if you leave your dirty socks on the table one more time I’m not cooking for you again.”
“Yes, all of that, but I have been working long hours I thought it was just…” Castiel stopped. He had nothing else to say.
“So, the surgery was a success?” Cas asked, tentatively.
“No, I didn’t, I… eluded something was wrong to Sam, I didn’t tell him…”
“Hey dumbfuck, cigarettes now.” The an tapped the desk aggressively and Cas took a deep breath as he tried to regain his concentration.
Sam had caught the one side of Dean’s phone conversation as he waited just out the room before he made himself known. Dean was stressed and tired. He could see the worry, the sorrow and the guilt in Dean's eyes and knew it was going to be hard to get him to part with it. It had been nearly 3 weeks since Cas had come home from hospital and although in Sam’s mind the man was doing remarkably well, but it was tearing Dean apart to see his fiancé go through it.
He thought it would be too far, but somehow he’d made it. It was as though his legs had known they were making their final trip. He didn’t believe in suicide… it was after all a carnal sin, but was it suicide if he just stopped trying? He just didn’t have the strength anymore. He would leave it to God whether or not he died, he would do nothing to encourage it either way. He remembered that the night had been forecast cold weather and more rainfall. But this place, his favourite place, with the trees and meadows, wild flowers and honey bees all dancing around the edge of the small pond, it looked equally as beautiful in the rain as it did the sun.
“Look Cas, I’m not comfortable leaving you alone right now, will you come back to ours?” Sam asked as they arrived back at the apartment.
“I love you baby brother. I’m so, so sorry.”
“You two sorted yourselves out then?” Gabriel said seriously, with a raised eyebrow, despite the fact that he’d evidently heard the entire conversation.
“I’m going to be ok Dean.” He decided and Dean looked down at him fondly with a smile on his face. Cas loved that smile, he loved that face, he loved everything about Dean Winchester. “There is a long way to go, a very long way, but I believe it now, I’m going to be ok.”
“Exactly.” Dean snapped. “I know what my fiancé is like, I knew his state of mind I should have seen this coming and I never should have left him alone.”
“Thank
“I’ll take you home.” She said firmly.
Now he was sat, staring out if the window at the Park across the street.
“What? What is it?” Gabriel asked worriedly.
“I’ll come in with you.” She offered.
“Cas has agreed to the divorce. No fight. He hasn’t even called, or texted.”
“You still ok with me touching you?” Dean checked, loosening his grip a little.
“Ok, I’m sorry bro, I really am. Carry on.”
“Well she’s good, but I’m Crowley.” The man grinned. “Let’s get down to it.”
“I know, but it’s the best hourly rate I could find locally and it’s within walking distance.”
“A few hours?”
“I’m going to wring that Doctor’s neck, the incompetent…”
“I can’t believe this Dean. I can’t believe you didn’t even notice!”
“Gabriel you can come in now.”
“I thought chemo was meant to make your hair fall out.”
Cas sighed and gripped his nose. He supposed he could take longer hours at the gas station and work on a Sunday as well, that would make up the deficit. He knew how hard Dean was working and how stressed he was. This was his dream and Cas wasn’t going to add any misery into this.
“Oh God. Castiel… We’re getting you to the hospital now. I’m calling Dean.” She bit back the tears and scrambled for her phone.
Jody sighed and calmly talked Cas through breathing. He needed to calm down and that wasn’t going to happen if she took him home to Dean in this state. Cas couldn’t think straight with that drug still in his system and when faced with the news that the love of his life had been… raped, Dean would be Dean, which meant over-reacting, getting angry and threatening vengeance on the perpetrators. That was the last thing Cas needed right now. That only left one option.
Dean’s face darkened at the last three words and he started to assess the situation. Forgive him, what on earth for? He took in Cas’ dishevelled appearance, the way his coat was torn, his hair ruffled and his voice more gravelly than usual. There were bags under his slightly blood shot eyes and the tell-tale bruise of a hickey just showing above his collar. His stomach lurched painfully. They’d had an argument and Cas had been gone all night. Cas smelt of booze and smoke and… sex; he had hickeys on his neck and had turned up early in the morning begging for forgiveness. As Dean added up the pieces his heart broke. More accurately it shattered. Cas had cheated on him. Not only that but after everything he’d gone out and given his virginity to some stranger.
But the car crash had changed all that.
“Through here.”
“Castiel…” Gabriel sighed and decided not too for now. He didn’t want to stress out his brother, not when he was about to have his first chemo and possibly surgery in the next few days.
“How do you know?” Sam could hear the heartbreak in Dean’s voice.
“You’re not leaving me.” Cas mumbled incoherently.
July 8
“I’m sorry Jody, I need to go and see him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabriel’s face darkened. “Cassie, Why?”
Jake was the boss and he certainly wasn’t a morning person. He was a nice guy and he got on well with him, and the rest on the weekend staff.
He had worried at first that Gabriel being there would have made it worse, but he’d been very right when he’d said he needed his brother. Gabriel somehow always knew what Cas needed and right now it wasn’t words, it was just gentle comfort. If Gabriel hadn’t been there, he’s have told them to stop 5 minutes in. But his big brother kept him just on the right edge of sane.
Dean backed away from the door where he’d been listening. Cas was smiling more brightly and broadly than he’d seen him since they’d first met after he’d hung up.
“Dean, I’m sorry I have to go. I should be back tonight and we’ll talk then.”
“Yeah, you didn’t know?” She asked in surprise. “His last shift here, he looked horrible all morning and then he just spaced out while this asshole customer was yelling at him and he collapsed. He wouldn’t wake up, I had to call an ambulance. Then a couple of days later his brother called and said he was seriously ill and had to resign.” She explained, wide eyed.
“Dean?” Cas said groggily. “Where?”
“Yes yesterday. Gabriel didn’t tell you.”
“He doesn’t?”
There's nothing graphic in this, just the aftermath for anyone who was worried. Jody has a real difficult situation on her hands.
“How can it be enough Cas… You had everything and now?”
“Why? What’s wrong.”
“Are you in the garage? Why are you in the garage?” Dean didn’t work as a mechanic, not now he was manager, so he should have no reason to be in the garage.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m so, so sorry. Please forgive me.” Cas begged, but he wouldn’t look Dean in the eye.
Sam chuckled. He loved how Cas treated his back as if it were a naughty child instead of a part of his own body. “That’s not the only thing bothering you though, is it?”
“No, not Dean. Please Jody, please. I can’t, I can’t see him, can’t look at him after…”
“Good.” The doctor smiled. “As planned we removed the worst affected kidney and the operation was a success. Scans have shown the Chemo is working, the cancer on your remaining kidney has shrunk significantly but we’re not there yet unfortunately. To save your other kidney we will have to continue chemo, but I’m very optimistic.”
“Ok, then I’m going to call Dean, ok? I bet he’s worried sick, he can meet as at the hospital.”
“Hi Chuck, its Cas, I need to talk to Dean if he’s about.” Chuck was one of the new desk hands, who was helping take the load off Dean as manager.
“It was partly me Cas and you can admit that.” Dean sniffed as Cas stroked through his hair, tears streamed down both their faces. “I’m glad I’m your reason to live Cas, but its not ok that I’m your only reason to live. That needs to change.”
It was true, Dean mused. Cas very rarely got angry and avoided violence and confrontation at all costs. But he recalled one night at a bar last year, they’d both had a little too much to drink and Dean had pissed off a biker, who had tried to ruff him up. Cas had floored the guy like it was nothing, and then proceeded to ruin three more hefty guys who’d blocked their exit as they had tried to leg it out of the door.
“Know what?”
“Gabe?” Cas said tiredly.
“I know Cas and I am so sorry. I don’t deserve your forgiveness, but I need to know if there is any way we can fix this?”
“Of course, I do.” Sam smiled warmly.
“Really?” Cas said in disbelief.
“As nice as that massage sounds,” Dean said, breaking the kiss. “I had something I wanted to talk to you about.”
“Yes.” Dean grumbled as they pulled apart. “No chick flick moments.” He said sternly.
“The money doesn’t matter Dean; the garage doesn’t matter. I of all people know that sometimes you think you know what you want, but when you get it, it wasn’t what you wanted at all. It doesn’t matter, money doesn’t matter Dean. Happiness is more important than anything. I am not disappointed in you for not being happy being a manager, its not who you are, and I can see that now. I’m only disappointed that you didn’t feel you could tell me and that you felt like pulling away was a better idea that talking to me.”
“I just… I know I have you and Zar, but Dean… he was my world Gabriel, I would do anything for him. I’d go back to him right now if he asked me to. I know you think I’m stupid for that, but you don’t know what its like, not being wanted, not being loved by the person you love most in the world.”
“Sounds great, give me half an hour.”
“What? Divorced… my perfect couple?”
“I will try and negotiate Mr. Nov… Gabriel, but it is unlikely. I’m afraid they have hired a divorce lawyer who is quite the Shark. Have you heard of Mr. Crowley?”
“What have those boys got themselves into now.” Bobby groaned.
“Castiel. You cannot put a price on your life. You know money is not an issue to me and I can ask Balthazar…”
“I think Dean has seen you at your worst as well Cassie. He loves you and as much as I hate to say it…” Gabriel sighed. “He’s a good guy Cassie.”
Dinner. With a shift the next morning. And food. Cas didn’t feel it was a good idea, but he loved spending time with the two of them.
“Yeah, sorry, I went a bit overboard while you were out.” Dean admitted.
“I’ll take your word for it.” Gabriel smirked. Balthazar was so wild he made the trickster look tame sometimes. Secretly he wondered if Castiel and Balthazar hadn’t been swapped at birth. It would make more sense if Gabriel and Balthazar were related.
There is the possibility for both prequels and sequels to this fic if the interest is there...
The buzzer went off and Cas went to turn off the oven.
He wanted to burst in there right now, take Cas and build a whole new damn universe where Cas could be safe and nothing and no one would ever hurt him again. If only he were God, Gabriel sighed to himself. That said, if he ever did get the chance to meet God, he would have a fair amount to say to that bastard.
“Dean don’t leave!” The desperation in Cas’ voice nearly broke Dean’s heart and Dean was back to his side in a second, grasping his hand swiftly as they wheeled him back towards the road and the ambulance.
“What’s going on with Cas is the love of his life, aka that scum of the earth brother of yours, is divorcing him.”
Cas sighed and looked up at the ceiling. “Look, can you please drop it. I’m too tired right now and I just want to rest.”
“Come on, no strings, you just look like you’re out of money and need it.”
Cas nodded clearly unconvinced, finally opening the car door and stepping out into the street.
“I know you’re worried he’s going to do something stupid, but he’s been doing better, he’s not a mess like he was in college, he’s strong Gabe.” Sam realised, eyes widening.
There was no answer.
“It doesn’t… me touching you, its ok right? After what happened, you’d tell me if you weren’t comfortable wouldn’t you?”
“And over protective fiancée syndrome.” Dean added.
“I’m sorry Cas, you know if I could go back and change it I would.”
Cancer. The word rang around his head and nothing else could penetrate.
“What is wrong with Cas, Sam. Did Gabriel tell you?”
amazing?” Cas asked sadly as he looked at Dean’s angry face. He nodded slowly in realisation. “Your right, I’m not anymore.” And for the first time in his anger and self-loathing did Dean open his eyes and really look at Cas. Then he saw the hurt in his fiancées ocean blue eyes.
“Shit. But it’s nice to see you Balthazar.”
“Yuh n’argument.” Cas slurred. “I’m too much of a burden for him. I don’t blame him for getting angry.” Maybe that explained why Cas was at a bar. She knew he didn’t drink, but everyone had their trigger and Dean could be particularly cruel sometimes when he was angry.
Dean smiled at the memory. “Fair enough. But as soon as business picks up you quit, right. I don’t want you working yourself into the ground.”
“So…” Cas smiled as Dean opened the door and walked into their little apartment. Dean smiled back at his newly-wed husband. Dean wasn’t really the marrying type, but he knew deep down it had mattered to Cas. Cas never told Dean what he wanted so Dean had, had to get good at reading his partner in life. Cas was so selfless it was beyond belief he always put himself last, which could be difficult at times, but Dean had got better at noticing when his lover was neglecting himself, or holding something back.
“Do you want anything to eat? Drink?”
“Your back?” Cas chuckled knowingly.
Cas took a moment to consider, then looked up at Dean seriously.
“Sam was going to talk to Dean and ask him to explain, but Cas… I think its something you need to talk to him about face to face.”
were the one who was too good for
“What’s low is your brother not coming home most nights, saying he’s working late when he’s actually reduced his hours, then getting you to deliver the fucking divorce papers with no explanation. Cas was fucking heartbroken!”
“No Dean I understand.” Cas turned swiftly, already having his hand on the door handle before Dean could react.
“You would?” Dean said in shock.
“Cas may want you there sometimes, and regardless Dean, this has been traumatic for you too, its hard for you too and I really think you should consider having your own session too.”
“Give it to me, Mr. Romance put his back out again.” Cas rolled his eyes.
When Cas woke up he couldn’t place where he was. The lights were bright and the room seemed incredibly white. There was a familiar voice breaking through the buzzing in his ears, as well as a soft beeping sound.
“Like I have 5 too many blankets.” Cas chuckled.
“I think it’s ok. I don’t know. I can’t feel anything.” Cas said weakly.
“Thank you.” Cas smiled, putting his head on Dean’s shoulder happily and dean stroked his fingers through his still re-growing hair.
“About 6pm Friday, straight from work, would be great.”
“We did 3 miles one day, he wanted to get to his favourite spot in the woods, but we barely made it. I had to carry him back to the road and then call us a cab to get back.”
“You need to come clean with me Gabe.”
“Cas? Are you alright?” A familiar concerned voice broke through, but he couldn’t focus on it. He felt like he was sinking.
Cas scoffed at Dean’s certainty of the latter, but the sentiment made his eyes burn a little with tears. Dean was not an animal person in the slightest, he acted so awkwardly around his brother Sam’s dog and it was adorable.
“The hospital called me when you were brought in, you still have me down as next of kin.”
“So why this time?”
“No, since he hired me and Garth, he’s been on 6 days a week 9-5.”
“It wasn’t my fault.” The words came easier this time and he was rewarded by a warm kiss pressed to his forehead.
Cas wandered back into reception a little dazed holding a piece of paper.
“What!” Gabriel tried very hard not to shout in disbelief. He kept his voice soft, his tone supporting. If attacked Cas now, he would shut down and there would be no convincing him otherwise. “Why not Cassie?”
The cashier looked up with a furrowed brow hearing the name.
“I’m here baby, I’m here, I’m so sorry.” Dean soothed, rubbing tender circles into Cas’ back.
“Good job Sammy.” Dean patted him on the back.
“He won’t get it if you leave it here.” Gabriel said, holding out his hand expectantly.
“I love you Dean.” Cas said as the medics quickly approached, following closely behind a worried Sam.
“We’re getting married in August.” Cas said with a happy sigh.
“You don’t think…”
It didn’t last for long. Dean pulled away when he felt Cas start struggling for air in his weakened state and thumbed his cheekbone fondly. Cas pressed another kiss to the tip of Dean’s nose and then turned his head to the door.
“Yes. It’s going to be a complicated settlement.”
Sam’s voice was cut off by a bit of static over the line. “Give me the phone Sammy!” Dean demanded, snatching it off his brother. “Cas, why on earth didn’t you tell me you were sick!” Dean shouted a little too angrily and Gabriel saw his brother curl up a bit in his hospital bed moving closer to try and hear the conversation. The anger in Dean’s voice made the line clearer in Cas’ head. Dean was mad at him. Dean didn’t love him anymore. Cas was just an inconvenience to him.
“No one’s heard from him. He texts me every few hours like clockwork, I’m worried.”
“Nothing.” He sighed. “Well, not nothing but I didn’t, I…”
“That’s right Cas, it wasn’t. Say it again for me.”
Cas tried to join in at dinner, he tried his best to dig in to the food, Eileen was a great cook after all. But despite the glorious taste, the more he ate the more overwhelming the nausea became. After a while he stopped talking and started pushing his food around a plate. He was absolutely knackered.
Cas had never even had a drink, but Dean always drank, he said it helped him forget. So, Cas decided that’s what he’d do. He flagged down a cab and climbed inside.
“Everyone. Bobby, Jess, Ellen and Jo... everyone.”
Gabriel had moved into the city to be closer to his baby brother. Sam and Eileen had started a family, just a few months ago she’d given birth to twins, a boy and a girl. Dean was over the moon to be an Uncle as well as a father… and yeah there was that.
“If we find out who did this Deano’s going to have to get in line.” Gabriel growled.
The they’d asked him for permission to take photos. He’d said yes, he felt he had to… I mean what would be the point in agreeing to all this so far and then saying no? But with every click of the camera shutter he felt like he was going to be sick.
“No Dean, I know different now, ok, but I need to say this. I felt filthy and disgusting and at the time I didn’t think anyone cared about me, so there was no one to hurt by letting myself die. I was going to hell anyway.”
“Dinner, last weekend. The one you said you’d be at. He was wearing that T-shirt that Charlie bought him for Christmas.”
“You look like shit Cassie.”
“Ermm… I can give her a run for her money, but she’s a specialist divorce lawyer Dean. One of the best.”
“Guys will you stop it please.” Cas said wearily.
“Then I don’t understand Dean, why haven’t I seen you for months, where have you been?” Cas asked, practically shaking with emotion, tears of relief streaming down his face.
“So, either he’s dropped 20lbs or he bought a bigger size?”
Sam and Eileen were silent at the moment. They’d known things were hard for them both, but this was a bit shocking. He wanted to push things, but Cas was so tired he was trembling a little with exhaustion. Eileen’s heart melted at the sight of their friend in such a vulnerable state. She crossed the room and pulled the now quite small framed man into a hug.
“Its beautiful Dean… But how did all our furniture get here?”
“I’m sorry Mr. Winchester, Castiel… I won’t keep you in suspense. Congratulations Castiel, you’re cancer free.”
Most concerning was the greyness to his complexion. The dark circles and the slight sheen of sweat.
“Actually, I was in the area. You don’t want to know why.”
“That… Dean cheated on Cas and now they are getting divorced.”
Something had smelt off about all of this from the very start and now Sam was determined to get to the bottom of it before their lives fell apart any more than they had already.
“I’m going to carry over the threshold.”
“Dean?” Cas’ usually deep, strong voice sounded small and weak.
“Yes really.” The smiling doctor broke Dean out of his thoughts.
“I came to check on Cas, he’s been texting me every day, but haven’t heard from him all day. He’s not answering his phone and I was worried sick.”
Cas nodded solemnly. “I’m sorry.”
“What’s that?”
“Gabriel. What are you doing here?”
“Good. Keep it that way. Look after them Jody and look after you. This isn’t your fault.”
“Ok, I’ve got you.” She said as they slowly made their way to her car. She sat for a moment in the front seat. She’d been called here to the scene of a disturbance, she needed to call this in, but this was Cas… Protocol would dictate she call an ambulance to the scene, get forensics…
“Cas…”
“Look, how about you come to mine, and I’ll take care of you, sleep it off and we’ll see how you feel later, ok?”
“Cas cheated on him.”
“You think Dean is cheating on you.” Gabriel repeated suddenly, resisting the urge to bang his head on the steering wheel. Why on Earth would his little brother think that? Those two were inseparable, a match made in heaven if you asked Gabriel.
“How can
Dean stood up suddenly. “Cas, you home?” He asked nervously. When there was no answer he moved towards the bedroom, just to discover the bed was empty and made. The bathroom was clear too and the kitchen.
“I want to, but I don’t want Dean to find out.”
“Cas, you got a minute before you leave?”
So some wrapping up to do in the next chapter...
“He made you feel small.” The man nodded in understanding.
“You’re one of the best in family law though.”
With a deep breath he fought to open his heavy eyelids and was met by bright clinical lights and surprised voices. But by the time the room came into focus, there was only one face present.
The road trip doesn't quite go according to plan...
“Dean, you never lost me. I was always yours. Always.” Cas held out his arms tentatively. “Come here husband.”
Gabriel froze. He couldn’t say a word.
“Yeah most of it.” Gabriel sighed. “I think it was the camera.”
“Stupid, no. But I don’t think you get it Sam, if Cas and Dean just broke up, then Cassie… I don’t even want to think what headspace he could be in right now.”
“Oh Christ, he looks…” Balthazar couldn’t finish that sentence. He looked like death. He was Cas’ best friend since they were kids, the one who’d convinced Cas to run away and start his own life. They’d lived together for years as roommates. Balthazar three years older looked after Cas while he was at Stanford. When Cas had met Dean, Balthazar had moved to LA, but the two had never grown apart.
“I’m afraid it’s bad news Mr. Novak.” The Doctor said sincerely. “You have stage 3 renal cancer.”
“Can we go home now Dean? I want to go home, please.”
“Zar!” Gabriel protested.
“I know.” Cas smiled. “And that’s all that matters to me.” I kind of have a surprise for you as well…”
Cas frowned when he saw Eileen on the sofa waiting, staring at him and he twigged. “Why does this look an awful lot like an intervention?” He said. “What I have done?”
“Oh, of course.”
I hope that ending did it for you all. I hate writing endings... I'm rubbish at it, hence the time it took to get this out to you. But I hope this was worth the wait.
“No, it’s fine Sam, you’re always welcome.”
“Any reason the accountant’s salary is $200 a month higher than we agreed?” Cas was too tired and now too grumpy for small talk. His pounding headache really not helping.
“You cooked?”
Sam frowned. Something was off here. He drew the letter back towards himself. Something was very wrong and he now was pretty certain that Dean was being too hasty. But, Gabriel took the letter out of Sam’s hand as he came back out of the apartment carrying Cas’s weekend bag.
“Bela Talbot.”
This wasn’t his house. It was Dean’s. He couldn’t stay here, it was wrong to stay in a place he didn’t belong. He had nowhere to go, no phone or money… his rapists had taken the valuables. Before he knew what he was doing he was stood outside the front door, rain tumbling off the porch and running in rivers down the asphalt. Putting the key under the doormat where they always did, he took one last look at the place that would have been his home, forever.
“I can drink to that.” Dean smiled.
The doctor nodded and left the room.
“So, you coming?”
“Damn right you will.” Gabriel nodded in respect, a little flash of forgiveness crossing his features. “Right, well time for you to get out lover boy, Cassie needs his rest and the doctors need to see him.”
“I don’t know…”
“You are coming home with me after this weekend.” Gabriel said firmly. He could barely believe what he was hearing, but Cas was right. Dean lying to him, not coming home at night… the asshole wasn’t even being subtle. “I am going to tear that piece of shit a new one.”
“You still want me?” Cas asked, a tentative hope in his eyes.
The doctor suddenly looked up and took in Cas’ appearance with a frown.
Cas’ eyes widened, and he tensed in Dean’s arms.
“On the scene of the disturbance at O’Malley’s. I have a suspected rape victim, but he’s a friend and refusing an ambulance. I’m going to take him home, see if we can’t talk some sense into him.”
“Don’t call me baby.” Cas giggled.
“How do you want me?” Dean asked and Cas position Deans arm around the back of his shoulders, so he could rest his face into Dean’s chest. Cas sighed contently and let his eyes fluttered closed.
A customer soon came and snapped Cas out of his boredom, but the room was starting to spin and his head went fuzzy and he realised he’d been missing what the customer was saying to him.
“Yes.”
“Dean…” Sam scolded.
“Thank God!” Gabriel huffed. “I thought you two were going to start going at it.” Gabriel sighed, stepping in from where Cas knew he’d been hovering just outside the door. His brother was the definition of overprotective and if Dean had put a foot wrong Cas knew Gabriel would have been in there like a flash to save his little brother.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked, his heart dropping through his stomach.
“Sam.” Dean turned to his brother, who was suddenly overcome with worry.
“Is it your back?” Sam probed, knowing better than to believe that answer.
Jody frowned again, face creasing in worry. Then as Cas’ had lolled back his neck exposed, she saw something that made the whole thing make sense. His neck was littered with red marks that she recognised all too well. Small bruised marked his neck, love bites, and she knew for certain that Dean hadn’t given them to him.
“Castiel, the doctors are really worried about you. You’re still losing weight, you need your strength if you are going to beat this.”
“I have talked to him, explained things, but I still haven’t had his permission to fill you in.”
“Dean?” Sam asked and Dean realised he had been stood there for minutes staring at the photo.
Bobby would have given it to Dean, Cas knew, if he didn’t need the money to pay off his mortgage, pay for his medical care and have enough to move to Australia to enjoy his least years in the sun.
“I love that idea Cas, I really do, but I don’t want you to put a deadline on your recovery, this isn’t something you should feel pressured to do.” Dean warned.
“Why would he think I was cheating on him?” Dean asked in disbelief.
Then his phone buzzed with a text.
“You ok, you look a bit peaky?”
“It’s ok, argument with the husband. I’m sorry for using my phone.”
Cas had been at the bar half an hour. He felt very uncomfortable and out of place and he wasn’t wrong. It was 2pm, no time to be in a bar unless you were an alcoholic or just plain miserable and although Cas fit the latter all the others in this place were certainly the former and the glances they were giving him they weren’t friendly either. He could feel the hostility in this dark and dingy place. He wasn’t welcome here. He imagined even Dean would keep away from a dive like this. He really didn’t like it here, but he didn’t want to go home.
“Dean, stop shouting, you are upsetting my brother, he’s not very well and he’s staying with me until he’s better.”
“Of course it is.” Cas sniffed in a mixture of joy and sadness as Dean slipped the ring back on his finger. Cas stiffened slightly when Dean slid back into bed and went to wrap his arm around Cas’ back. Dean felt Cas go tense and his face darkened. He sharply let go and backed off, causing Cas to startle and look at his fiancé in confusion.
“How did we get into this mess.” He sniffled, once he’d started to bring himself together.
“How are you feeling?” Gabriel asked, ruffling his hair fondly.
Cas had sustained fractures to his T2 and L13, 4 and 5 vertebrae. It was a miracle he could walk. The doctors said his recovery was thanks to how fit he was before the accident, it had saved his life, but he would never run again. The loss of functionality in his hips and legs made it difficult to walk, he could manage short distances and even years later he was still improving. Getting a little further each trip, but 2 years later and his back ached all the time, and apparently it always would. What annoyed Dean most was Cas’ refusal to take the painkillers the doctor had prescribed, but Cas didn’t see the point. If this was going to be the rest of his life he might as well get used to it.
“Dean, I’m back.” Sam walked into the apartment. Eileen would still be at work, but Dean should be back by now.
Cas just stood there staring through teary eyes at a spot on the wall. His whole world had shattered, any scrap of strength he had been holding onto left him in that moment. Because Dean was right, and Jody was wrong. Why would Dean ever have wanted him after this?
“Cas, just hear me out and please be honest. Charlie pointed out your t-shirt. That was too small at Christmas and now…”
“It’s Sam.”
“Looking for my brother.” Gabriel said spitefully.
“Right, go sit in the car, I’ll sort this out for you.”
“He barely ate a thing and that t-shirt, that’s the one I got for him at Christmas.” She hissed.
“When can we go home?” He asked, tiredly.
“He’ll hate me.”
“Yeah sure, Sam.”
“I do appreciate being able to use the bathroom in peace Dean.”
“Well I guess we’ve got some phone calls to make.” Dean smiled. “Thanks Doc.”
Well, from one way of leaving you hanging to another... At least now things are cleared up.
Cas’ job payed well, very well, even as a junior in the department. But with the mortgage repayments they were scraping for every cent and had moved into a smaller apartment a few weeks ago.
Sam sighed and looked over at Dean who was now stirring on the sofa. Sam pushed Gabriel back into the street and closed the door behind himself.
“And I’m going to stay to make sure you don’t smother my damn future brother in law.” Sam wake back in. “Don’t worry Cas, I’ll rescue you from these two. Just a few things to sign and we’re all good to go.”
“What are you saying?”
“Is Dean in?” Sam asked hesitantly.
“Dean errm…. He asked me to drop something for him, a letter for Cas.” Sam explained.
“Any bars I can get to for 5 bucks.” Cas smiled weakly, riffling through his pockets and discovering he as usual had very little money in his wallet.
“I thought… I just thought this would be forever you know.”
“They have stand in computational linguists?” Gabriel scoffed in disbelief.
………………………………
“I never cheated on you Cas.” Dean blurted out desperately, fresh tears pricking his eyes. “I could never… what you said about me being it for you, is exactly how I feel. You’re it for me too Cas. You’re all I want, you’re all I will ever want. I need you like I need air t breathe.”
“You don’t even know he’s sick do you?”
Cas just took a deeper breath, no emotion showing on his face which confused Dean.
“Something in your eye?” Sam chuckled.
“Dean, please don’t get defensive, honestly I am so proud of the way you are handling this. I know you are not a words guy and hate your chick flick moments but you are you are as amazing a fiancée as you were to me as a Dad and big brother. You are incredible Dean, I only hope one day I can be half as good as you are if Jess and I ever have kids. ”
“Where’s Dean? Did you call him.”
“I know. It doesn’t make it better.”
“Oh, is that what Cas told you? That’s low.” Sam expected better from Cas, he really did.
“Did they give him something?” Dean asked angrily.
“So, he is ill?”
“You haven’t heard then.” He said sadly.
Dean clapped over his face in pain and disbelief. He’d never thought Cas would ever be capable of something like that… it was Cas! How could he? He could hardly believe it even though he’d just heard from the mouth of the man in question. It was just like Lisa all over again. Dean knew he was far from perfect, but was he really so bad that every person he ever loved felt the need to cheat on him?
