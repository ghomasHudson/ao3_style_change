“I know,” she said a sadness in her voice.
Tony sighed as he listened to him, and Steve knew that this was him giving into the fact that Steve wasn’t going anywhere. They were a team, they were parents, but most of all they were married, and Steve honestly wouldn’t give it up for anything, not even the chance to live the life he had lost because even in their present, he had everything a sickly boy from Brooklyn could have ever wanted.
“Good job,” Tony said to Scott as he picked up the case. To everyone in the room he was just another SHIELD agent picking up something that had fallen by chance. “Meet me in the alley, I’m gonna grab a quick slice.”
It took them several hours to figure things out, and even then, they weren’t sure because the gem they were trying to synthesize kept breaking down. They weren’t sure about what to do, even two geniuses needed help every once and a while.
“Will do Rogers,” he smirked before activating the suit’s nanoparticles. “Get to it Tom Thumb, we don’t have all day.”
Instead of moving, Tony plopped himself back down on his pillow, secretly relishing the fact that it smelled like Steve, and stared at the ceiling. The popcorn tiled ceiling was only as distracting as his pillow, in his mind he was thinking about how everything would go wrong in his life. Starting with Bucky’s reaction to them just being in bed together asleep.
Scott let out a panicked “Excuse me?”
“I know, it’s just... well I was thinking that we could actually talk about it. I know that last year you were getting over that whole thing with Bucky, so you were within your right to take some time for yourself, but Bucky’s moved on... several times. And now maybe you can too.”
Both Steve and Bucky were staring at them, he wasn’t sure why until they started laughing, “What it happens a lot, plus they would never mess with Nat, not after one of Clint’s collectable figures was found dismembered in bed next to him, which one was it.”
“Are there any other options with the Tesseract?” Steve asked because he needed to focus his energy elsewhere or else he was going to punch an ant.
“He’s terrible at flirting,” Bucky said as he sat down next Natasha pulling her legs on his lap. “Remember when him and Peggy were talking, it had taken her three months to figure out that he had been trying to ask her out.”
“If I move on, who does this?” she says gesturing to the room around them, where moments before the team, while scattered across the universe, still worked together.
He couldn’t look up to see what Bucky and Natasha were talking about, he couldn’t hear them anyway over the pounding in his ears, it was weird that one moment he was on top of the world and the next it can come crashing down. He wasn’t sure if Tony would listen to him, not unless he talked to Sharon, or even checked with his own sister.
“Yeah well we didn’t get away with it completely last time either,” Tony said to him before pulling him down for a kiss. “This is different though.”
“We’ll get you your suit, but remember you can’t change anything at all,” Bruce said to him, and they all knew the reason was because if Clint so much as changes something it could have repercussions for them all.
“That works,” Tony said wondering if they were going too fast with this, but he really couldn’t imagine himself doing anything any other way.
“This is known,” Rhodey said before Tony could say anything else.
In the farthest corner of his sanctuary was a box that had been delivered over a week before, the box contained one Iron Man vibrator, it was going to be a part of the new line of toys coming out in the next quarter, they were more streamlined than the original set, some were more discreet, but this one was just for him and Steve… well mostly for Steve, because Tony already had a collection of toys. For those days when Tony was off on the other side of the world and Steve just wanted some release.
The door to his room opened and Bucky found him sitting on the edge of the bed, he knew he looked like hell, and this had only happened within the last twenty minutes. But Buck didn’t say anything, he just sat down next to him and stayed quiet for a moment, letting Steve cry right there. For some reason it felt like the end of the world to him, which was stupid because he’s known Tony for barely four months, but this is different than what he had with Bucky.
“0-7... Excuse me...” Steve said looking at his husband.
After that, he had made it a habit to show up at the store every other day, he read faster than most people anyway, and he was always going to need a book. Though he had restricted himself to only one book for every visit, or just coffee if nothing caught his eye. He tried not to always take pictures of Steve, he didn’t want to feel like a stalker, he really didn’t, but that weird childhood crush had come back with a vengeance and he couldn’t help himself. Luckily for him, Bruce would be there with him most days, they would take a table and order coffee just to grade papers, or talk about their classes.
“This is a punishment Steve, there’s got to be some consequences for your actions,” even if they were extremely painful for Tony as well. “Don’t worry, I got you,” he said before kneeling back down and putting three fingers inside of Steve’s hole, making Steve jerk up in the process as Tony brushed over his prostate.
“You know, the day it happened we were visiting this school, I had just gotten the acceptance letter,” she said to him when they were sitting on a bench. Her name was Riri Williams, and she had been accepted into the school the day her family vanished in front of her eyes. Instead of staying home, she took the chance to go to the school, because she hoped that she would make her parents proud of her, but also, she wanted to have a crack at trying to find a way to bring them back.
“What is this?” Steve said once the trio had gotten themselves under control.
“Sorry,” he yelled out before Steve could walk into the room.
“That’s only because you ran his foot over that one time, and now he refuses to sit behind you,” Steve said to him as he grabbed his stuff. Unlike Bucky, who lived in the dorms, Steve lived in the same house as Sam and the rest of their fraternity, though they weren’t like the others on campus, they were mostly just the guys on the baseball team, or those who had played baseball. Though Steve didn’t play anymore, he loved his room at the house, and wouldn’t give it up for the world, mainly because he had always shared with everyone and that room was the one place that had been his own.
Steve knew that while those kids weren’t biologically his, that he wouldn’t trade them for the world, superheroing ran in the family, it was bound to happen that the kids would follow suit, especially with two of them sporting actual powers, and a genius in their midst. Before he could say anything else, because the one thing that the kids had agreed to were secret identities if they ever used their powers, the small group that joined them started to come in. They were there to tell their stories, to talk about their lives, to find some way to move forward.
“Can we not talk about whatever this is,” Tony said as he pulled away. “I don’t know if I can take rejection from you right now.”
“We know that, but for now we just have to go into this with the knowledge that we won’t change anything, because if we start thinking that we’re going to mess up then we will, and we can’t go into this with that mentality.”
“Most likely no, it would just create an alternate timeline, and that timeline wouldn’t have to deal with Thanos, it wouldn’t change our past at all,” Bruce answered.
“Mom, Dad,” Steve said bringing Tony back to what was in front of him. “This is Tony, my boyfriend,” hearing Steve say that one word gave Tony hope for everything he could ever want. It was sweet and seeing Steve blush made the whole thing worth it.
Vision’s face came up on the screen, no longer grey and dead, it was strange to see him alive when everyone else had died. “Hello Mr. Stark.”
“I’m game,” Clint who had been sitting at the other end of the table messaging his kids answered them. “I’ll do it, I need to make amends for messing up my kids’ lives because I couldn’t let go enough to take care of them.”
“I will, after I’m done, I promise,” he said to her.
Steve couldn’t help but look at him dumbfounded by what he was saying. “What do you mean you blew up the TV?”
Grabbing him and pulling him into his arms, Steve knew that this was why he survived being in the ice for seventy years, this life right here, “I love you,” he said kissing Tony’s temple.
“Language,” he heard Steve say from the other room.
“I wanted to climb you like a tree at dinner,” Tony said and Steve really wanted to laugh, it was sweet to hear all of this, but he wasn’t sure just how much Tony was going to remember.
“Alright everyone suit up,” Steve said grabbing his shield as they all took positions, Scott and Hope both ready standing together, Shuri behind a glass wall, Tony activated the suit, but he saw an uneasy look in Steve’s eyes and he wasn’t sure what to think about it.
With a wave, Steve joined Tony as they walked down the long underground path, holding his hand, they were going back home. They knew that when the stones went back to their own times, they would have to avoid bumping into themselves. It was a long hard journey they were on, but it was worth it if it meant that their family would be whole again.
“I know,” he blurted out and he would have smacked himself if not for self-preservation. “I mean... she talked about you, and I saw you sometimes, but I was always in some corner or on my way out and I never got introduced, because I went to M.I.T.,” seriously why couldn’t he stop talking.
“Oh, well I guess we’re going to have to clean it,” Peter said though Steve could hear the guilt in his brother’s voice.
“Get to work Stark,” Steve said push up against Tony until he fell forward, and their faces were barely inches apart. “You know the rules, but just remember, even though you’re in control tonight, it doesn’t mean that you’re going to call the shots all of the time.”
The hospital had kept him overnight, although he didn’t really remember much about it, he could have sworn that he had had a dream about telling Steve that he could be a hot lumberjack, but that couldn’t have been real... right. His mother had been the one to pick him up from the hospital and get him home, Jarvis driving the car shooting Tony worried looks. It’s what happened when you’ve been looked after by the same people your whole life.
“I didn’t want to make Tony uncomfortable by being in the room without you there,” Steve said and couldn’t help the shy smile that he sent Tony.
“You guys can take the car,” Steve said not sure of what he should do. “I’m sure Tony’s cooking dinner and the girls are watching a movie, but I can’t leave them.”
“I know, he’s too good to try anything else, trust me we never got past kissing and maybe the occasional groping session, his mother would have castrated me if I had done anything to her boy,” Bucky let out a shiver that frightened Tony a little, he was afraid that Steve’s parents wouldn’t like him, that they would think he’s just like Bucky or something. “Don’t worry Mama Rogers would love you, she always said that Steve would end up with someone special, and honestly no one is more special that the youngest son of the Stark Family.”
“But for what,” Steve asked as the room studied the screen in front of them. So many eyes on one fixed point, they all wanted the same thing and that was revenge against Thanos. “What’s the point of using them a second time after what he’s done?”
In Professor Coulson’s office Tony felt weirdly calm, sitting in the leather chair next to Ty, Tony felt confident, even though he wasn’t fond of Ty or what he had done, because it didn’t matter anymore none of it did, he realized that just from standing outside with his boyfriend, his friend and his family.
“No but Steve, I can't help everybody.”
Ty smiled at him as if Tony had given him the keys to the world and Tony couldn’t help but blush, it was nice to not be a Stark for once. “I’ll see you there,” Ty said before Tony waved him off and rushed off towards his next class.
“He drove us here all night from California, I tried to make him stop but he swore that this what was needed to figure out a way to talk to you guys,” Hope said watching as Scott shoved the sandwich into his mouth like he hadn’t eaten in days.
He wasn’t sure what Steve meant, until he was handed a drawing of Captain America with his cowl pulled back, looking a lot like Steve, and Iron Man with his helmet off, looking like Tony. The latter had his arm around the other, they were both smiling as if someone was taking their picture, while they stood on what looked like a New York City yellow cab, destruction all around them, but it looked like they had won whatever battle they had been fighting. Tony wanted to cry, normally he had pictures like this commissioned by others, or he brought prints from people who had made them, because they didn’t know that Tony Stark boy genius was the one behind the stories. In all of those pictures Iron Man’s face was always covered, but this one, this one was different, because it was not just Cap and Iron Man, but Steve and Tony.
“Doesn’t matter right now,” Tony answered as he watched what was happening in front of him.
“So why are you ending the series,” Steve had asked looking at all of the hard work that his father had put into the characters over the years.
“Shut the front door,” Bruce said startling Thor out of his nap, the god smacking his head on the table. “Sorry Thor... sorry,” he murmured
“I’m going to have to call the Director,” Sitwell said ready to pull out his phone and make the call.
“This old lady would love to see her grandson settle down one day,” she had told him when he had come in that day. He wasn’t sure if it had happened or if he had hallucinated the whole thing. So, he had made a deal with himself that the day Steve took over, he would go over there and talk to him at least.
Rhodes left the room, the fading crunching sound of glass was the only indicator that the man had been there in the first place. Steve sat on the ground thinking about what the man had said, about where his heart was telling him to go, all he knew was that he wanted to be there with Tony. He thought back to that first real conversation that they had had when Tony had gotten back to earth, about how good it felt just to banter about some inane thing like how they looked.
“Okay, I’m going inside the core area now,” Scott told him as Tony saw Alexander Pierce walk up to the 2012 Avengers.
Before he could say another word, his other self moved forward, shield at the ready, and went at him, sending him backwards. He really hated himself at that moment, which was strange, but hell he hadn’t known just how much his own punches hurt. Steve took a swing at captain America, he really hated that uniform, and Tony knew it.
Tony put his hands-on Steve’s face, it was cold to the touch, but it felt real, “This was the first time I made a decision for myself, and you became a part of that.”
“Yeah well they didn’t have any singles left and they told me that if I roomed with a freshman, they would lower the cost of the dorm, which means I would have to work less to pay for everything this year, so it’s a win-win.”
“I’ll be working in the stacks around seven, usually I’m in the second floor towards the back, so if you find a seat around there, I can find you easily.”
“Do you want to know what I’m thinking about?” Steve asked genuinely curious about what Tony himself was thinking. He really did love listening to him talk, whether it was about mathematics or about his stories, or even about himself no matter how much it pained to hear him talk about his past.
“Just sometimes, we did talk about other things,” Tony said pulling Rhodey away from him, which Steve found odd in a way, mainly because the other man was about to say something else and was stopped by the shorter man.
“Do you think I have a chance at fixing this?” he asked because he wanted to know that he would get that second chance at having someone as great as Tony Stark.
“Okay daddy, I won’t tell pops,” she said but he knew that the moment Steve asked her about her day she was going to blab about their little misadventure. He was so screwed.
“Good to go,” Tony said and Hulk huffed out for a moment before turning to the glove. Bruce must have told him about what was happening at some point because the Hulk didn’t even flinch.
“Yeah, I know, I know,” he said trying to find a weak spot, but his other self landed a hit and his compass fell out. The picture inside was different, because it was one of Tony and the kids, he kept it close to his heart at all times. But he didn’t think that it would jar his other self so much.
“Holy shit man,” Bucky said before he burst out laughing at the sight in front of him. Steve didn’t say another word, dropping Buck’s stuff on the empty bed wanting to run away from the room as fast as possible. But there was something else on the wall that caught his attention, it was a rendering of a metal suit, it was strange to see, but this wasn’t a character that his father had created. The more he looked through the pictures the more he saw of this metal man, next to Captain America.
“Wouldn’t it though?” Steve asked, wondering what they were getting themselves into if they couldn’t change the present by changing the past.
“No, I told her that Sam was in love with her and that I already had someone that I wanted to be with,” Steve turned towards him and took his hand letting Tony feel just how cold they felt. “Tony I was going to leave a party with some of the best people I know because I would rather have been with you,” Tony felt his breath hitch at the words because there was no way that this was happening at this moment. “I want to be with you and only you. I want to take you camping.”
“I have to go see my professor in a minute, but when I’m done, we can go, I’m done with my classes anyway,” Tony told them all the while his head was on Steve’s chest, Steve’s hand was going up and down his back comforting him.
“I’ll make sure we both get back, alive and well,” he said to her, it was more of a promise to himself than to anyone else.
“So, I, uh...” she started, it was always hard when they had to share something that was truly intimate. “I went on a date the other day. First time, you know? Sit there, dinner... I didn't know what to talk about.”
“Thor put him in the office in the back,” Steve kneeled down next to Tony who was now bleeding heavily from his nose. “And stay with him until the cops come,” he really shouldn’t have stayed in the back for as long as he had. “Nat, Bucky’s in the back, can you get him to cover the front door for Thor, and also call an ambulance for Tony.”
“Can we talk about something else?” Tony really wanted to move away from the topic of himself.
“Yeah, but I don’t know... I feel a little jealous,” Steve told him, his face flushed with hints of pink, it was cute, and Tony’s heart did a little dance.
“No Steve, I don’t need a gift,” honestly speaking though Tony just wanted more time to spend with Steve, but with this would mean that Steve didn’t need his help anymore and he wanted to stretch it out for as long as he could.
“Alright,” Scott said before laying down on Tony’s shoulder. “Flick me.”
“Don’t use me as an excuse to go,” Bruce said but Tony really wasn’t, was he, damn it.
So, Tony declared them Kamala’s godparents, “If anything happens to her, I’m blaming them,” he said to Steve that night. After Carol had shown Kamala a particularly dangerous maneuver, that had Tony practically pulling out his own hair.
“Do you see me getting on your case about whatever you and Bucky are?”
“I’ll be here,” Tony said before nodding and walking away, a book in one hand as the other rubbed the back of his neck.
“Yeah well next time, I’m putting one of those kid tether things on her,” Miles looked up at his parents and smiled. “She’s too all over the place.”
“Cheez Whiz?” Rhodey said and Tony gave him a nasty look, it wasn’t the time to antagonize a Norse God, and Rhodey should have known better.
Maybe one day I'll get deeper into the relationships between the kids, and their adoptive dads. Until that time comes I hope you enjoyed this, because they're going to play a bigger role further into the story.
Tony was too distracted to notice what was happening until Sam called out, “What the hell is this?”
But on Tony’s wall there was someone very different when it came to Captain America, maybe a real friend, one that Steve had always wished existed. He had friends in real life, but for Captain America, he really only had allies, even with Bucky being a character in the story or Sam’s Falcon, there were days where it didn’t feel like it was real, because they were his real life friends. Steve studied the image at the center of all of Tony’s pictures, it was a drawing of Captain America, and from the name underneath one of the images, Iron Man, as the Captain held on tight to the other man while they flew through the air, not far from them he could see Stark Tower, the old building above Grand Central Station, the sun setting in the background as the stars slowly made their appearance. It was a great picture, though he wished that he had been the one to draw it for some reason.
He just stood against the wall at the other end of the ballroom, playing with the cuffs on his shirt, looking bored, when he really wasn’t, it was just him acting like he didn’t want to be here. Natasha stood next to him a few minutes later almost like she had been there the whole time and not sneaking off to get his phone.
“But why did that help when nothing else did?” he asked knowing that he needed to look into this himself. “Can you send me the notes on the whole,” he waved his hands not sure where he should start.
Somehow without him realizing, he almost always attracted people with special powers, or potential beyond anything he could imagine, and it scared him. Not because he was always surrounded by people with special skills, but because the world around him was evolving to match the threats that they would possibly face in the future. So, on days when he thought too much about everything, mostly on days when Steve was at his group meetings with Miles, Kamala joining them on weekdays when Riri was at MIT, Tony found himself headed over to one of the orphanages that had cropped up after the decimation. He knew that if he could help those kids too, he could also heal himself a little more. He didn’t have to think too hard with the kids, he could have fun, and do silly things for a few hours.
“Sorry,” he told him, knowing that he needed to understand this and figure out what to do that won’t send Tony running the other way.
“It’s going fast,” his mother said with a smile. “That means the girls will be out soon, or at least one of them, because usually twins don’t come out one after another unless they’re identical.”
“Ty you can’t hand that in,” Tony said shocked that Ty was even thinking of submitting it at all. “I wrote half of that story.”
“Okay,” Steve couldn’t help but smile, he wanted to know more, maybe even finding something to like about the character.
There was a painful look on Lila’s face, the same look Tony had always had when his father ignored him growing up. He knew what it was to have a parent who wasn’t there, it was one of the reasons he had been okay with the kids spending so much time at his house. When he looked at Clint, the man looked as if she had hit him, even though she hadn’t, and Tony knew that it was because the severity of what he had done, more like what he hadn’t.
“FRIDAY,” Tony called out.
Clint grabbed onto Shuri and pulled her away from her own monitor. “Yes,” he said pulling the young girl in the same way he would pull his own daughter. “You two are eating with me and the kids.”
“Well this one is feisty, or could it be the hours upon hours that he spent working on his projects only to come home and worry about his first date with Stevie over here.”
“I know,” he answered as another wave of sadness hit them both, this could be the start of something bigger or the end of it all.
“Hey, Queens. Heads up,” Steve called, and then Tony saw Thor’s hammer flying across the sky, picking Peter up on the way, right before Pepper caught him.
As he stood there gathering his papers, Tony watched as students walked up to him just to speak about things that hadn’t been discussed or asking about his grading criteria. Tony was just in awe of the whole thing it wasn’t every day where he would have the chance to meet one of his heroes.
“Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There’s an idiot on the landing zone,” she said into the earpiece, it had been something Tony worked on that bounced through all of the relays they had sent out during their trip.
“I got it.
“I feel like this is half bribery half coercion,” she said to him and honestly it could have been, but this was how they worked and have worked since they were in school together.
Tony dug into his food, realizing that this was the first time in days that he was eating a proper meal and not a random granola bar he had stashed in his bag. “Do you want to tell me the plan for tomorrow?”
He could feel Tony’s body shaking, there was a damp feeling on his shirt, and Steve knew that Tony was crying, not just at the thought of trying to pull off the strangest caper he had ever heard of but at the thought of losing the four kids that they had helped raise, and the thought that if he tried and failed to bring everyone back, it would break him completely.
“Usually it’s a scorch mark,” she said and he could hear the smile even if he didn’t see it.
she wrote leaving him alone with his thoughts and his bed now very soft and comfortable bed. He set his phone to go off fifteen minutes before she would get there, so that he could at least get a few minutes of sleep if anything, all the while letting the bed take him forever.
“Well, when I started writing these stories, I wanted to add more characters of my own, so I added my own brothers, it’s easier with Thor and Loki, they were named after Norse gods, so I just used that as their back story.”
“Yes, but no one has ever given me one where I’m Iron Man, because no one knows that I’m the author, the only people who know are my mom and Natasha, and well you,” he felt his face burn at the words but it felt nice to have someone who knows that it’s him, who took the time and effort for him.
“You’ll take them, and when you wake up, I’ll have a special surprise for you, but only if you’re a good boy and take your meds,” he said already tired of the game.
“I’m sorry,” Clint whispered as he pulled his daughter into his arms, “I’m sorry,” he continued as the tears fell.
“I used to have nothing,” she tells him while looking out into the room. “Then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better,” she was already in tears, and as much as he still wanted to cry over it all, he couldn’t not anymore.
“Yeah well color me surprised too, I didn’t know until I was in the car with Jarvis on the way down here,” he said knowing that he should be angry at his family, but they were never together around this time of year, there was always one meeting or another.
It was understandable to them all, Scott wasn’t ready for the pressure that would come from going back, he wasn’t ready to know if he would be able to do so without messing something up. None of them were prepared for the consequences of what would happen if they messed up so early into testing the machine.
“Yeah Bucky told me that you were smack in the middle and that you had five brothers at home and even sisters on the way,” Tony told him and Steve couldn’t help but smile.
“Just in case, call me,” he said to Tony with a smile before walking back to Bucky and Tony’s room, standing at the door for a minute. “See you later,” he smiled before closing the door, hope that this would be the first step before they would become friends at least.
“Okay,” Tony answered his face feeling flush, “But also because since I’ve been here, I’ve gotten to know you and Bucky, hell Nat and Jan are here too, and they would kill me if I even tried to leave, and I built a robot with a fully functioning AI inside of it, and while one of my stories hadn’t panned out in class, I did like all of the other ones I wrote.”
“I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true,” Bruce said turning the conversation back to what they were doing. “Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future...”
“I may not know you that well, but I’m almost certain that you don’t actually eat, hell you usually sneak out right after I get home, though I’m never sure where the hell you go, so I doubt you sleep a lot too, since I can see those dark circles around your eyes.”
“You’re repeating yourself, you know that? You’re repeating yourself,” he said the emphasize his point.
Thor who up until that moment had been quietly sitting in the corner listening to the conversation had gotten up and walked over to Carol and Tony was sure that he was testing her, but he wasn’t sure if it was a good idea until the ax flew towards Thor breaking through one of the walls.
“Thank you,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper as he to the picture and put it on his wall next to all of the others ones, careful not to ruin it. “No one has ever given me one like that.”
There had been something wrong with his comm where he was it wasn’t working properly and he couldn’t hear what was happening with Tony and Scott which only worried him more. There was no way to get in contact with them until he got back to their rendezvous point.
He was left in the workshop alone as the girls walked out, most likely in search of Steve’s cookies, or something to have for dinner, he hadn’t thought that far. It had been a long day, but he was glad to have the kids around to keep him busy.
“Here we go,” he said taking a deep breath, before the two of them were off once again into the quantum realm.
“Hey there,” he heard Ty say pulling him out of his thoughts about Steve and the good old Captain, Ty was a good guy, so maybe this could go somewhere and help Tony get over his crush.
Tony already knew that he was going to pass the class, the only course that he was really worried about was his fiction writing class, and lately it felt like the more he thought about it, after everything that had happened in the last few weeks, that maybe just maybe he had made a mistake. The whole thing with Steve had probably been a mistake, the whole first semester had been a huge mistake. He was a genius, but he had felt so stupid just giving up a huge opportunity at M.I.T. just to go to some small school.
“Where?” he said happy to hear that he hadn’t lost everyone.
“Go to the living area and stay there,” he told them knowing that Tony was going to have a fit about them all being there. “I need to talk to your father,” he looked at his kids knowing that while they loved them, they wanted to protect their parents as much as him and Tony wanted to protect them.
See you next time.
“Wait, are we in your hometown?” Tony asked, looking around for signs of what it was like to grow up in Steve’s life, but all he saw were trees and the diner, further up he could see Main Street USA type of shops, but the street didn’t stretch that far.
“Tony has these moments, where the press wants to get at him,” she said her eyes had this fondness to it, which meant that she had some stories. “But I think you’ll be fine as well as your store, so you don’t really have to stay.”
When they reached the waiting room, Tony was a little disappointed, Steve wasn’t there yet, and from the look on Natasha’s face, Bucky was missing as well. Rhodey was standing in a corner with a tall blonde, next to him were Pepper and May, who were both smiling. He saw Sharon with Aunt Peggy, along with Sam Wilson, Steve’s roommate and one of the people involved in that whole misunderstanding, though he was glad that everything had worked out for all of them.
“Morgan, that’s the name that was on her bracelet when she was found, she’s lucky to be alive after what had happened to her parents.”
“It was weird at first, but I learned that if I needed some stimulus, so did he, so he trained, and I trained, we learned, we shared, he’s not as angry as before, and we’re both calmer than I have ever remembered.”
“Born out of blood,” Steve said his shield raised.
“Wait, when you say a planet, you mean like in outer space?” Scott asked his eyes wide which only gave Rocket an opening to mock the man.
Steve bonded with her that day, both of them finding comfort in just talking about their families and their lives since the snap, he kept in contact with her and then called her when he had starting thinking about proposing to Tony. It was late Spring when they had made it to the now sleepy area, Tony had rushed around looking at all the projects with a gleeful stare, talking to each and every student individually about what they were working on. None of them asked why the Avengers hadn’t fixed what had happened, they must have known that somethings couldn’t be fixed, they were scientists after all.
“Whoa,” he hears Thor say.
Steve laughed at him before turning his head up and giving him a kiss. “Well at least now we know that you’re her favorite.”
“If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and Bucky really break up, I mean it looks like you still like him and all.”
“Will you ever tell me who it is?” he yawned as he tried to smile, he was glad that she found happiness.
“Did you finish your story for class?” Ty asked him as he typed away, forcing Tony to acknowledge that Tony had not in fact written anything at all.
“Do you think you mother knew... that Bruce was my brother?” Steve asked, he was genuinely curious about it because it felt like too much of a coincidence that this was all happening like this, but then again no one ever really knew everything.
He was looking at a picture of Captain America and Iron Man on his wall when he made the decision to go, he wanted to talk to Steve, not just about math or Tony’s stories, or their lives, or even coffee, he just want to be near him and talk to him about any number of random things that have popped into his head. It was weird that everything circled back to his relationship, well non relationship right now, with Steve. He stood up and grabbed a cable knit sweater, because as fun as it is to wear Rhodey’s sweaters all of the time, he actually wanted to look nice. Standing in front of the mirror he messed with his unruly curls in hopes of them looking at least a little decent, wondering if he should change his glasses for his contacts, when Bucky kicked the door open, slamming it into Tony’s head.
“Bruce bring Scott back before these two get any weird ideas,” Steve said keeping an eye on the other two, as they started laughing again.
Sighing Tony looked at him trying to be a serious teacher, before smiling, “Other than your atrocious handwriting, yes they were all right.”
The Hulk stood there for a moment, it was the most normal thing that Tony had ever seen, almost like Bruce had him in control, but the moment was gone when the Hulk smashed his way through one of the glass walls, grumbling about being woken up. From the other side Valkyrie and Nebula followed the Hulk after rushing over from the sound, Hulk acknowledging the Asgardian as if they were friends before pushing his way down the hallway.
“Oh, God!” Lang says holding onto his chest.
Before Tony could say anything else Steve left, he didn’t want to overstay his welcome, hopefully he could find something that they had in common, something that Tony would feel comfortable talking with Steve about. He wanted to at least make it up to Tony, and become his friend if anything.
He stood there for a moment, taking a few quick breaths before looking back at his other self and realizing that what Tony and Scott had been saying was right, “Geez, I’m never going to hear the end of this,” he said to himself. “That’s America’s ass.”
“We didn’t get to talk about this because you and Scott were arguing,” Steve said to him as he pulled them away from the fountain and sat him down at a nearby bench. “What happened with the Hulk?”
“Don’t worry about him,” Tony told Steve, because it didn’t matter anymore, not what Ty wanted, not what Ty’s father had wanted, they weren’t going to take anything from him, not as long as Steve was there, or Natasha stood nearby, his brothers would probably take the guy down too. He had his family, the one that his parents had stitched together over the years, and now he had Steve and Bucky, and all of the people who have their backs as well. Nothing else mattered.
“Faster,” was all Steve said but Tony shook his head and pulled out of Steve.
They sat back on his bed, leaning against the wall, just sitting there in the quiet, it was weird for him to be able to sit still for even a moment, but with Natasha they would always have these moments together. She used those moments to get his mind to calm down mostly, especially on days when he was running on too little sleep, when the equations in his head wouldn’t stop coming and kept him up at all hours of the night. That’s how he started writing, when they were sitting around talking about what it would have been like to fight alongside Captain America.
There was a groan, one Tony was familiar with, as Steve looked up at him, Tony was so happy to see the pair of bright blue eyes looking back at him. “That’s my man,” he said happiness in his voice. He stood up still holding the shield in his hand. “You lose this again and I’m giving it to Morgan.”
“If we do this, how do we know it’s gonna end any differently than it did before,” Bruce was still pushing, he was a scientist and Tony knew that he wanted all the variables, but Tony was losing patience with the questions, he felt guilty for being alive when Peter hadn’t lived and the Guardians hadn’t lived, when everyone that have been dusted from the snap had lost everything.
“I did once, but I realized that we would lose so much of each other, the Hulk and I aren’t one person, we’re two different people living together, I would rather it be the two of us sharing than one of us alone.”
“Well this just got a million times more complicated,” Natasha said as she leaned into Bucky while rubbing her face, “And we don’t know where he went either, because his first instinct is to go somewhere that no one would be able to follow.
“Too bad, I think he’s already taken, I met his boyfriend earlier when they were dropping off his stuff,” Tony said before moving behind them and smothering himself with his own pillows, the reminder of Steve’s baby blue eyes following him.
“I’m a fan of them too Tony, but somehow this reads more like fanfiction than anything else,” Professor Coulson said throwing Tony off his axis, “And while I know in some ways it’s an accepted form of writing, I wanted you to use this class to help you build your own worlds.”
“I thought that you weren’t that kind of doctor?”
“Don’t call me a moron,” Clint yelled out.
“You’ll never know since you drank your pills,” he said even though he knew that he wouldn’t have lasted an hour, Steve was too good to resist especially when he held Tony down the way he normally did. “Now get some sleep, I’ll be back with dinner later.”
"Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?” Natasha continued her questioning as if there was something there that no one was seeing, which was now worrying Steve.
Letting Scott and Hope into the building was one thing, but their crazy plan well that was another. It was something that Steve wasn’t sure that he was prepared to deal with, but he saw the hope in Natasha’s face, it was a second chance for her.
If he was in the bathroom a little longer than he should have been, it didn’t matter, he was tired and now hungry, though he was glad that he didn’t have to deal with the fact that his roommate was in a relationship with the guy who only hours ago had caught Tony’s attention, he wasn’t sure how far he could trust Jan’s word at the moment. It was only because sometimes people broke up, and realized later that they should have stayed together. Tony didn’t want to risk trying anything and getting his heart broken, so he filed it away and moved on.
“I swear they’re all right,” Steve said placing the paper on the near the side of Tony’s bed where he was standing, all the while Tony just stared at him, he wasn’t sure if a smile from Steve had some kind of healing properties, but it was working wonders on Tony’s mood.
“But.”
“Okay, so the "how" works,” Steve said to the room of mostly superpowered people. “Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six infinity stones.”
“Same stuff I’ve talked with my friends about, you know how things have changed, and... and going to school and working at the same time,” she said looking around to the room. They all had shared their lives with one another during their sessions, but this was more than she had ever shared with them. “How much we miss going out to games here in the city. Then everything got quiet. She cried as they were serving the salads.”
He knew she was right about that, especially since the last time they had a huge fight it felt more like a divorce than anything, and they hadn’t been together at that time. Since then they built a family, rebuilt their lives and their relationship, losing Tony would be like being thrown seventy years in the future all over again, and he didn’t think that he could deal with that and survive.
“My poor baby boy,” she said kissing him on his head like she had when he had been a little kid and had been under an engine that he had been rebuilding with his father and the thing had fallen a few inches right onto his head. His father had freaked out, mainly because Tony had bled a lot, but since head wounds tend to bleed like crazy, they had realized it hadn’t been too bad of an injury, but they hadn’t wanted to test the waters especially with Tony’s medical history.
By the time Steve had come to pick him up, he was nervous, dressed in Rhodey’s M.I.T. sweatshirt, and his jeans and converse, he looked like the world had swallowed him whole, except Steve was looking at him with a weird look.
“I’m not sure just yet, he’s still in the prototype phase, I need to ensure that his coding works, but hopefully once done this could be helpful for uses within an automated workshop,” Tony answered, although he was sure that the bot would be called DUM-E, because he was a little well dummy. In a way he was Tony’s crash test dummy, the thing that would help him create better versions of his projects, including his bots.
“Okay,” Steve said, and Tony couldn’t help but feel hopeful about just having Steve for even just a little while.
“It’s alright,” Steve said smiling. “If you want, we’re going out to dinner later, you can join us,” smooth Rogers, really smooth, you’re supposed to distance yourself not ask him out. He wasn’t sure if it were possible to yell at himself in his own head but apparently it was happening.
“That’s not the worse part, his father told him to make friends with the Stark kid who was going to school here, I bet he didn’t know that the two of us were here,” Tony said knowing that because of that Natasha would already planning the guy’s demise. “His father got a deal with S.I. because of this, and I hadn’t known about any of it. The whole semester he used me without me knowing and I guess that’s what threw me.”
“They’ll be fine, and you’ll be fine as long as you don’t fake any more heart attacks, plus they can come home on weekends, and we still have Morgan here.”
“I know you’re mad at me for taking that hit, but can we talk about this later,” Steve yawned as his body relaxed. “I’ll be one hundred percent in the morning, and we can duke it out then.”
The semester had started before the store had reopened, and Tony had to settle with going to a different bookstore all summer and brewing his own coffee. Yeah, he could do that, but he had money, why not have someone else do it for him. Plus, the Barnes coffee shop had some kind of crack in their coffee and Tony needed it at least once a day to function.
“Well you and Tony both should come see me when you’re ready, I’ve never thought to put Cap in a team like the Avengers, but that’s because working on the X-Men was enough of a team for me, but this would be great.”
“Bruce, how did you get here,” Steve said first in surprise, seeing his older brother walking towards them, he knew that Bruce was working somewhere though they didn’t know where, because he had transferred recently.
“But,” she started but he just looked at her, she knew that she was in trouble and there was no getting out of that. “Fine... geez, I hate that look.”
“I’m working on it,” Sam had said as they stopped at the house.
“Yeah well our resident therapist got dusted so we’re going to have to deal with everything on our own,” Tony said feeling guilty as he said it, he wasn’t close to Sam Wilson, he wishes that he had been closer to the man, but the divide was already there between his world and Steve’s. As he thought about it all he looked at the stillness inside of the cradle, Vision inside, but nothing was truly working. “Do we still have the notes on the stone?”
“No, I didn’t, I was in the kitchen packing up some snacks, because as fun as a party was I would rather sit with you wherever you were and draw while you just talked about anything, I was getting ready to leave when Sharon cornered me.”
“I can do this all day,” his other self said and god Steve hated that right at that moment. He thought back to the battle, he had been injured on his stomach, which should be a weak point at the moment, his body hadn’t healed very quickly from that blast.
“There’s my boy,” she said with a smile before smacking her husband’s hands away. “Damn it, Joe I can walk you know, the doctor said it was alright.”
“Yeah well, I didn’t know you went here either, I came because it had everything I wanted and none of the legacy shit that all of the other schools had been trying to sell, plus... I met Steve,” Tony said, and Steve could see the blush creeping up onto his cheeks.
The lake house had somehow turned into a place where people would come and go, Thor came with Bruce and Valkyrie, most of the time when Nebula was there, the four of them having a weird bond that Tony didn’t want to speculate about, but it worked. Each one of them housed a mountain of issues, either from family or the tragedy of their lives, but they were close. Nebula would bring them things that she found while traveling with Rocket, who because of Thor was Rabbit to Morgan. It was their own weird little family, one that Steve never thought he would have, even with the missing people in their lives, he knew that he had hope for their future.
Steve smiled at him before opening the door, “Yeah well this room is special,” he said as they walked in, the moon light washing the room in a slight glow, “There’s a skylight up here, plus everyone else complained because it was so high up, but I loved it the moment I saw it.”
Steve woke up feeling content, and really warm, he could feel Tony in his arms, the lights on the room had been dim enough that they had both fallen asleep without feeling the need to turn them off. Though to his surprise the lights were off anyway, and he wasn’t sure if it was because Tony had gotten up in the middle of the night to turn them off, or if Bucky had come back to the dorm and saw them sleeping like this. He was certain that it hadn’t been Bucky, because his friend had the tendency of snoring or at least snorting in his sleep. He was a deep sleeper and sometimes if he was in the wrong position, he would start snoring loudly.
“He’s not really alone you punk,” Bucky said as he walked over, his arm around Natasha, “but I appreciate you bringing Nat here.”
“I am,” he told her before looking over at Tony. “I’m happier than I could have ever imagined.”
He hadn’t thought of it that way, “Maybe that’s a way to look at it,” he told her thinking of all of their adventures when they were little. “I guess I’ll have another sleepless night.”
“You should not be wearing that, okay? This is part of a special gift for your Aunt Pepper and Uncle Happy,” he told her as he pulled the helmet off and saw the gleeful smile of his little girl. “There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? Want a handful of crickets with your sandwich?”
“Are you glad you made him into Vision now, even though he’s currently laying in that cradle, not moving, and with the possibility of him never coming back,” she said but he also knew that it had to do with the possibility of everyone they cared for never coming back.
The Captain America comics have been nominated for over two hundred Awards during it’s twenty year run and has won over a hundred awards including, The Legacy Award, Incredible Heroes Award, Phantom Award for rising Artist, and the Heroic Age Award.
“We’re here,” Miles said plopping himself down on the ground. “She’s faster than she looks and I have superpowers.”
Steve made sure the shelf was back in where it was supposed to be, before putting all of the books back and turning to the very real Tony Stark standing right there next to him, who had for some reason helped him out. He wasn’t sure if Stark was going to sue him for using his name as advertisement, or if the man was genuinely just being helpful.
“I’m glad you made the decision to come to this school,” Steve told him as he leaned down and put his forehead against Tony’s. “Before you came here, I felt so lost, the whole thing with Bucky threw me off for so long, I was just going through the motions to just keep going without people noticing that I was being... well different. But Buck told me the other day that it felt like we weren’t even friends for a long time, but with you I felt so happy, and you gave that to me, and I want to have it for as long as you’ll let me.”
“Sure man,” Sam said just as Natasha walked over to him, Steve guessed that the police already knew her side of the story and were in the back with Thor.
“Oh, okay,” Tony said before they walked out of the library and into the darkened night, Tony watched as Ty walked away without saying another word. Leaving Tony alone in the dark once again, he didn’t know what to do mainly because he didn’t want to rely on Steve to pick him up every time he came to the library.
“Tony,” Steve called out.
Tony laughed, because his father almost always said that but never actually made it home until well after two in the morning. Everyone walked into the ballroom just as the employees began coming in, Steve was nowhere in sight, and Tony was honestly worried. Natasha stuck next to him, a similar look in her eyes, though they had plenty of distractions in front of them. Their mother banned phones from the venue for all of them, especially after one party where their father had been on a business call for most of the time and hadn’t gotten off until well after the party had ended.
Tony was looking at him, his eyes wide and his mouth open, and Steve wasn’t sure why, but he kept telling the story of how the character came to be. “I had been weak as a baby, even in my mother’s womb, so he had created this character who had grown up sick, but got better because of some weird science, because you have to know that it’s weird there’s no way something like that was possible in real life, but anyway, he had wanted to give me hope growing up,” Steve sighed remembering everything, how painful it had been to breathe growing up until for some reason in High School, he started getting better. “I was a bit of a runt, and Bucky was one of my only friends, even in a house full of brothers.”
“Fancy meeting you here,” Steve said with a smile, which was really a nice surprise and also answered the question of why Steve smelled like coffee all of the time.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you,” Clint said hugging him, his friend was a fully-grown man child and they all knew it. “You’re the best,” Clint called out as he went back towards the front of the store.
“Tony, do you think that you really can?”
“Hot Tub Time Machine, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.”
There was a moment where his eyes met Steve’s and the blackness that stared back at him was enough to swallow him whole, he was never sure where this relationship was going, but he was sure that the way Steve looked at him during these intimate moments were genuine. Without taking his eyes off of Steve’s he slowly moved one finger in and started moving it in and out while feeding his boyfriend his dick at the same time. Even without the vibrator on, he knew that Steve was enjoying this as much as Tony was, and it was only the start.
“No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke,” he was voicing his opinion on the whole thing, it had been a small experiment on Lang’s end. “And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?”
“Yeah good luck with that theory, it’s weird and unnatural, I love your sister.... wait that sounds weird.”
The room was silent, his head pounding because of the constant heaving, his chest hurt, and he couldn’t tell if it was from his run in with the Hulk anymore. He couldn’t think anymore, he could hear the Hulk raging and something breaking around him, but he wasn’t sure if it was real. He wanted to think that they were all back safe and sound, that nothing bad had happened, he hadn’t noticed the tears falling from his face until he couldn’t breathe anymore. Steve was on the floor next to him holding onto him, he could feel his husband’s chest shaking. It didn’t matter if anyone else was in the room, it didn’t matter if they had all made it, she hadn’t, and they lost the one person who had tried the hardest to keep them all together all of these years.
Sam and Sharon were sitting on the couch watching a movie, and he knew that this was something that Tony would have to see, Sharon sitting next to Sam was enough to show Tony that there was nothing between Steve and her. “Sam,” Steve called out causing Sam to turn towards them.
“Okay, well I’m going to go get ready, and I’ll be back in a bit, no maiming while I’m gone,” Bucky said before grabbing his stuff and heading to the bathroom.
“Just make sure you dress warm,” Steve told him before giving him a quick kiss as he walked out of the dorm.
“Anyway, should we have any other rules?” Bucky asked him before digging into Tony’s eggs, before Tony tried to take them back.
"Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it,” Okoye answered clearly irritated by the whole thing, but they all trusted Natasha enough to keep trying, but all were worried about her and often called Steve or Tony to take her out of the compound for a while.
Bruce nodded from behind the console, “Clint, now you’re gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift,” he said as Clint took his place on the platform. “Don’t worry about it.”
“This class isn’t going to be an easy one, those of you who have spoken to me before hand or have taken any of my other course know this,” the professor told them before the class ended sternly looking at all of them, Tony knew that he was trying to weed out those who were on the fence about being there. “If you want to get out of the class, I suggest you do it now while you still can, if you want to stay well, I’ll see you next week.”
When Tony started traveling for work again, never too far because he needed to get back to the lake house, it was home, and sometimes being too far made him panic because he was afraid Steve would vanish, so the business trips were confined to the tri-state area. It was on one of these trips, to Jersey of all places, where Tony found himself helping a young girl who was crying on the side of the road near a pile of dead flowers. Someone else who had lost everything because they hadn’t done enough. Though she told him constantly that it wasn’t his fault, the first person outside of the Avengers to do so, he noticed that she looked a little malnourished.
“The robotics lab,” Steve said his heart painfully breaking in his chest. “It’s the one place I’m sure that he would go, because it’s the one place we can’t really follow him.”
“Here goes... please don’t die.”
“What did he do?” Bucky was the one who asked, and Tony could see the curiosity on his face.
“But that’s just being adventurous, trying new things, but also doing the things you like,” Tony said, he loved Shawarma, there was a place not far from the mansion that he went to all of the time, the owners knew him and usually had a place for him to sit where no one, not even the paparazzi, would bother him.
Tony couldn’t help but hug the teenager, he knew May would be happy to see him more than anyone else. “What are you doing?” Peter said as tony gave him a kiss on the head, the same kind he gives to all of his kids before bed time” “...This is nice.”
“Listen, there’s too much happening around here and I don’t know how I would have taken it if you had died on some godforsaken planet, and I swear I should have quit for real years ago, but and your no Pepper, you have to do this, you wouldn’t have an opportunity like this again bullshit and I listened,” she had run out of steam, sitting down in one of the vacant chairs next to the bed. “Tony, I know we’re not together anymore, but I can’t lose one of my best friends not after what happened.”
“Tony, seriously you don’t, and that shit isn’t healthy either,” Bucky said as he pulled out Tony’s nearly full garbage can, which was mostly wrappers at this point, which honestly was probably a bad thing, but he’s too tired to actually move lately so who can blame him. “I don’t think that I’ve ever seen you go to the dining hall.”
“It’s Rocket,” the raccoon said which only made Tony smile, it was a little fun when no one understood his pop culture references. “Take it easy, you’re only a genius on Earth, pal.”
Yet, whenever Steve drove into the city without Tony, he couldn’t help but feel the weight of the guilt that crushed him from the inside. The feeling of what if they had done this differently, what if Steve had called first instead of waiting for Tony to do so, what if he had told Tony the truth before everything got out of hand. He knew that Tony had the same thoughts, the nightmares he sometimes had were a testament to that fact. They talked about it, Tony sometimes came to meetings with Steve and Miles, but in the end the best healing that his husband has done is in taking care of the kids. Steve would have never seen himself as a family man, he told Tony that that life was long gone, but in the end, Tony was the one that had given him hope, hope for something bigger, hope for more, and he loved him all the more for it.
“Even if there’s a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who’s not in this room to try,” Nat said the reminder of how much they’ve lost over the last month hanging over their heads.
Before Loki could say anymore Thor slapped a device on his brother’s mouth effectively rendering him silent. “Shut up,” Thor said and Tony could swear he saw the god smile at his brother as if this was something they had done before.
“It’s a long story, and one that I really can’t tell you,” Steve told her. “You weren’t supposed to see me, we weren’t supposed to get caught,” he motioned towards Tony who was still standing on the other side of the room, quieter than he had ever seen him.
“Yes, I would love to hear the rest of the story,” Steve said, and Tony could feel Steve breathe in front of him. They were so close, all Tony would have to do is lean in and take the one thing that he had been craving for weeks, but he chickened out at the last minute and pulled back. His face was flushed, and he knew it, but he also knew that he couldn’t ruin what they had as friends.
“Yes Honey.”
Not knowing where to go, he went to Tony’s workshop to find the genius in there throwing things left and right. The bots in their charging stations not daring to come out in fear of something being thrown at them. He watched as Tony grabbed a wrench and flung it across the room before he fell to his knees, Steve rushed in and just held onto him while he started to cry, his shoulders slumped and defeated. It took a lot to take down Tony Stark, but even Steve knew that sometimes people had to break, even the Avengers were not immune to it no matter what people thought.
“She’s helping with the kids,” Clint told him as he looked between Steve and Tony. “Is that Tony Stark?”
“Here, here,” the three guys next to her called out. This was her life, now if only she could find someone for Jan that the guys knew, that way Natasha wouldn’t be surrounded by just men. It was something to think about, but until then she was just going to enjoy the moment.
“A special M.I.T. sweater just for you,” Rhodey said before pulling off his own sweater, “And it still smells like me, so that means when you get back to your school it’ll help repel all of the stupid people.”
“Oh,” Steve said, and he wasn’t sure if he was blushing or getting sick, but it didn’t matter because Tony talked about him. “I didn’t realize that I was a topic of conversation.”
Tony took a sip and immediately regretted it, not because of the taste but because the coffee was scalding hot. He cursed himself, but tried the drink a second time, and honestly this time it was nice, yes it was strong, but it tasted like gingerbread cookies, it reminded him of Jarvis and his wife and all those holidays that his parents had been too busy.
“You need to get a life,” he said remembering a time when she was trying her best to set him up with someone.
“So, how was dinner with not Tony Stark?” Bucky asked him as they got everything ready for the opening shift.
“What’s going on?” Bruce said, only to turn to see Shuri laughing next to him. Steve knew that this was going to be a disaster, just from the smiling and laughing that Hope and Shuri were doing. Bruce started recalculating before pushing a series of buttons.
He sighed before leaning into his husband, “We’ll try, but the first thing we’re going to have to do is get everyone here, we’re not doing this alone, we need a team.”
Honestly Tony wanted to block him out completely, not listen to anything that Ty had to say especially after what Ty had revealed about his father’s intent on having Ty befriend him and then Ty taking the story that Tony had helped write and turning it in as his own, well Tony wasn’t sure he wanted a friend like that. To his surprise, he saw that Steve had been waiting down the hall for him, and Tony couldn’t have been happier than he was at that moment, because it meant that there was someone there to be a buffer between Tony and Ty. What did surprise him was that Natasha was also there and Bucky was running towards them, almost as if they had planned to meet up and surprise him.
“It’s what you are.”
Instead of walking him towards the dorm, Steve pulled him towards the parking lot, Tony knew that they were going to go for a ride, but it was too surreal for him, he had been pissed at everyone over the weekend. Mostly at his own luck, so what were the odds that when one person had used him, Steve would be there to pick up the pieces. This was new, and not something that he was really expecting.
When he had gotten to Riri’s project he was astonished at what she had accomplished, Steve knew that the two would hit it off, considering how much they had in common, but it amazed him even more when she started talking about replusor technology and how Tony’s reactor could help the world around them. Eventually leading him towards where she had helped Steve set up the proposal, in a small classroom nearby, under the guise of asking for help with the rest of her project.
“Sorry I didn’t get the chance to meet your parents,” Steve said as Tony snuggled into him, yawning as he did. “I wish I could have been there, if anything to see the look on Bruce’s face when he realized that we’re both dating Starks.”
“What, you wanted more?” Wong said exasperated.
Tony wasn’t normally alone at the lake house, there was always someone around, but it was eerily quiet as he made lunch for him and Morgan. He knew exactly where Morgan was, in her little fort that Riri and Kamala had helped her build before they had left for the semester. The fort was visible from the window, so he wouldn’t lose sight of her, but it was strangely quiet which meant that the little girl was up to something. He had learned long ago that his kids were evil conspirators, he loved them, but when the four of them were together they plotted things and scared the hell out of him on more than one occasion.
“Do you think he would step back from helping us?”
“Hey Shuri,” he said as the picture of the Queen of Wakanda illuminated the room. “Is he up?”
“Very well Mr. Stark,” Professor Coulson said with a smile. “Please stay for a moment, I need to take Mr. Stone to the Dean’s office so that I may give her the final decision on this matter.”
“But would you be able to rest?” Steve asks him, looking into his eyes, and Tony knows that he wouldn’t. Shaking his head, feeling as if he had already lost everything.
“Yeah, I know, but after everything that had happened with us, and the conversation with that professor after one of my stories, I guess it’s was just the nail on the coffin on whether I should have just gone to M.I.T. like my father wanted.”
“The breakers are set, and the emergency generators are on standby,” Shuri said working from her own set of computers, a hopeful look in her eyes.
When Steve let out a laugh as that and pulled him into his arms Tony felt himself relax a little, “Sounds like a deal Shellhead,” he whispered into Tony’s ear.
“No,” he said trying to grab something to hold him to the desk.
“I like this one,” Thor said a huge smile on his face.
“Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay,” Thor said kneeling on the man’s other side. Tony watched as Steve pulled away while Thor comforted Bruce.
“Well, technically I’m a certified genius, but it’s not something I really tell people,” he said, but mainly to himself, he had been bullied for being a nerd in school, for a lot of things actually because of the glasses of course being shorter than his own brothers one of which had been a huge football star at the school, the whole thing made him wary to tell people about it. “I’ve done most of my prerequisite courses while I was in high school, so I only really have to concentrate on my major courses.”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?” Tony called out as he watched more ships appear.
“It’s never too late when I can control it,” Tony smiled at Steve before noticing that Steve was struggling against the bindings on his arms. “Stop pulling on those, I made them to withstand even the Hulk so you’re not getting out anytime soon.”
This chapter is super long because of the rewrite, but I love my little family, and you will have to pry them from my cold dead hands.
“You gave your parents a heart attack, and Tony was the one who made you that suit,” Steve said wondering how his own kids didn’t understand that their parents knew everything. “We let you kids have KAREN as a defense, we don’t interfere with her, but it would be nice if you guys would warn us a little when you actually decide to use your powers.”
Pepper nodded and then walked over to Steve, when the two of them were left alone, he knew he was in for something. “You’re going to travel through time,” she said as a fact and not a question.
Every so often Ty would show up and read what he had done, amazed that he had gotten it so quickly, “This is really good,” Ty would tell him before someone from the library staff came around the corner and told him to get back to work.
“Spiderman is a teenager?” she looked at him shocked. “But from what my brother told me he fought with you two years ago, he couldn’t have been older than fifteen.”
“Do you like the stars?” Tony asked him, and Steve couldn’t help but remember that night the week before, although now it feels like an eternity ago. He remembered how the light from the moon had made Tony all but glow in Steve’s eyes.
“We don’t have time to grieve Steve, we don’t have time to do anything else but finish this, because it’s what she would have wanted,” he stopped talking, he couldn’t deal with this anymore, but the sadness in his husband’s eyes meant that they had to take the moment, even if it was a short one.
If there was anything that Steve knew for certain, it was that Tony liked coffee which was good since Steve worked at Starbucks and could make all kinds of drinks. He had seen the bill that Tony had dropped in the tip jar and had to make sure that he had been the one to get it, though he wasn’t sure what it said, and he didn’t want to check either, it was all ones and zeros and nothing else. But it was something that Tony had written and put there for Steve to see, so he wanted to make sure that he was the one who got it and not one of his coworkers.
“Bring him back Nat, those kids need him,” he told her before putting his arm around her. “We’ll get her back for him, we’ll get them all back, but I don’t want Clint to have a guilty conscience because of what he’s done to cope with losing his wife and their child.”
“The multiverse theory,” Shuri said looking at them. “The theory that there are an infinite number of universes out there, but even in those universes we all exist in different ways, but we still exist within our circumstances.”
“I started reading the comics because I had been bullied in school for being too small, I was in advanced classes when I was young, but my mother didn’t want me to skip too much and miss having a normal school life either. So, Natasha and I had a lot of similar activities growing up, things we could do together, we were the youngest in the family so of course we’d be together all of the time.”
“That’s nice of you Steve, but I don’t even have your number, and I heard Bucky, you guys are going to a party tonight.”
Tony had been quiet the whole drive up, his eyes still vacant of anything remotely resembling the man Steve had once known. He knew the guilt was eating him up inside, it wasn’t any different then what Steve was feeling himself, but Steve needed to be the stronger one for once and not let everything fall onto Tony’s shoulders. When he pulled up to the house, he noticed just how run down it was, but it was something that they could work on together.
“Why do you hate him so much?” Tony asked him back, and Steve knew that he was going to have to give a little before Tony told him anything at all. “I mean Bucky said it was because you had been bullied over having the same name, but I can tell that there’s something else there.”
“Nope, just you, everything else is something I create, you on the other hand are someone I care for, someone who doesn’t like me because of my family name or because I can further your life.”
“I will help them,” Vision’s voice rang out loud and clear. “I have kept your children safe, now it is time for me to help as well.”
If there was one thing about the proposal that Steve would never forget, it would be the look on Tony’s face when he walked into that room, it was full of flowers that Steve had picked, and lighting made by Riri which only illuminated everything so that it would have an ethereal glow. He had watched as Tony looked around the room, surprised at what was happening before his eyes had settled on Steve, kneeling down at the center.
“Hear you loud and Clear oh Captain my Captain,” Tony said over his comm line as he got into place. Since Steve finished his part, Tony knew that they just needed the tesseract and they could go back without a hitch. “Thumbelina, do you copy? I’ve got eyes on the prize, Cap’s got one, so now it’s go-time for us.”
“Well let’s finish this homework and then go to the party, I have to ask someone out on a date today, hopefully she’ll say yes,” Bucky said smiling at Tony as he said it, before going into the room.
Pushing them all into the house, before shoving his brothers into the living room, and taking Tony to the one place he was sure his mother was, in the den. His father worked in the basement of the house, his mother on the other hand had created a little library in the den for the babies and usually sat in there when the house was too much. She was the mother of five boys, and sometimes it gets to be too much even for her.
Before any of them could react to what could have been a world ending attack, Carol flew up and took them down one by one, Tony could hear Rhodey whistling out at his girlfriend, he was proud of his girl and he wasn’t afraid to show it. Tony was glad that his friend had found her after all of these years, even happier that they had found each other. Tony worked to make sure the debris didn’t hit anyone, even with the fighting, something like that falling on them would still take them out.
It was the last few days of the fall semester, that one week that ended right in the middle, and Tony wasn’t sure why it was needed other than to torture him with more classes, and even with all of the ups and downs that had happened over the last few months, Tony was absolutely happy. He was sitting in his final fiction writing class, having moved towards the front because he didn’t want to sit next to Ty at all, while their professor talked about all the work that everyone had put into their final stories, never once singling a student out. He talked to the class about some internship opportunities as well as his spring semester teaching assistant position for the next year, as long as they had a good GPA in the major, they were welcomed to apply. Tony wasn’t sure he wanted any of that, he was happy just taking his classes and working on his own projects, so it didn’t really sink in for him. It was a good way to end the year, even when he had thought he wouldn’t finish the class, when he felt down about everything, this was the best way to finish.
“What is Vormir?” Natasha asked, her voice in full business mode as she took notes on everything they were saying.
“I’m not sure, I barely talked to him when he was in Wakanda, and when I did take the time to see him it was still a little strange,” Steve said holding Tony close. “We’ll never know unless we try to fix it all, but it’s too late for them if what Clint is saying is true.”
“Time to get back to work,” he said sending Tony apologetic looks as he walked off towards his next task.
Now they were alone in the backyard, a tent set up, and a fire going so that they would be warm, the fire pit was actually at the other end of the very huge yard, so they weren’t too close to the house, which meant that they wouldn’t burn the place down if they fell asleep at any point, which was nice. Out there it almost felt like they were alone, even when Peter and Harley tried to go out and sit with them, only to be dragged back into the house by their father, because apparently the two had been grounded and needed to finish their homework before they were going to be allowed anywhere near the tent.
Rhodes started walking towards the door, the sound of his braces reminding Steve of everything the man had lost, “Listen Steve,” he said as he stood at the other end of the room. “I forgive you, honestly, I know you and I have been on different ends of everything involving Tony, but I also know that without you he would work himself to death, and without Tony you wouldn’t have the motivation to keep going. It’s one of the reason I’m certain of this, that you have that stupid beard, you don’t forgive yourself for any of it, but eventually you’re going to shave and Tony is going to blow something up, and you’ll both move on, because it’s what you do, but this time just follow your heart.”
He needed a moment, he needed to breathe, he wasn’t sure where the gauntlet was in all of this fighting, and he really didn’t have time to stop while a war waged on around them. Before he could take another step forward a very family suit landed not far from him, before Peter’s face appeared in front of him.
“So, what's the plan?” Scott said turning towards Tony, excited as ever about the prospect of running an op with the Avengers.
“Go ahead,” Steve said smiling at him, which honestly was a little distracting for Tony, no one should have that kind of power just from smiling.
“Yeah, I know.”
It was one thing to be reminded of that vision he had from Wanda all those years ago, but to see Steve in the rubble like this, it was bringing back some awful memories. “Steve,” he called out as he retracted the glove before reaching out to check Steve’s pulse, sighing when he felt the steady beat of the man’s heart. “Come on buddy, time to wake up.”
“I promise, I will do everything in my power to make sure that we come back,” Steve said as he held Tony tighter. “I don’t want to lose you, or anyone in our little family.”
“Alright, let's get to work,” he said pulling Nebula and Steve along, Nebula had grabbed onto Rhodey and started pulling him along. She was more, well human in the years since they met, she still didn’t show a lot of emotion, but she held the people she cared about most very close to her. Tony knew some of the reasons why, even after they had all lost everything, the ones left behind needed one another more than anything. Hopefully doing this will give her something more than what she already has.
If all it had taken was one picture to send the store into a frenzy, he would have done it himself, though the person who had taken it had apparently come back several times because there were all kinds of photos on the so-called Instagram page of one Tony Stark. The account wasn’t even verified, there was no way that it was his to begin with, but it was good for business, and it hadn’t stopped any of his friends from teasing him since a lot of the pictures had happened to be him with a book or helping someone. Whoever it was, according to Natasha, had a crush on him and while he was flattered it almost felt like stalking.
The room was quiet as they all took in what he was saying to them, he tried to remember all of the things that Sam used to tell him, about recovery after war, about getting over your fears, things that he tried to take in even when it seemed like everything was falling apart. He started this group because he remembered Sam’s work with the VA, he wanted to honor his friend’s legacy by doing something that would make him proud, because there were days when Steve felt guilty for dragging him into the whole Avengers things.
“Where are you off too?” Bucky asked before Steve could even try to ask anything.
“He walked in on what he thought, hell what I thought, was you and Sharon kissing,” Bucky said, and Steve knew that his eyes were wide, he knew that somehow the one thing he had been excited about he had somehow messed up, even if was because of misunderstanding.
He hadn’t realized that he had fallen asleep until someone plopped down next to him on the couch making him bounce on his side before his face was fully plastered against the pillow. He knew it was Rhodey before he could fully wake up, his best friend home for the holiday just like he was, and of course he comes to annoy Tony the first chance he got.
“Because that’s where the mirror is genius,” he answered rubbing his head, thankfully the mirror was intact, and so were Tony’s glasses.
“Who’s going to go and who’s going to stay,” Clint said addressing the elephant in the room, there were too many of them to pick from.
“What, it’s not fair if Tony got to meet the parents, and they’ve been together for a week, while we’ve been dating for over a month and I haven’t met anyone,” Natasha said to Bucky pushing him back with her body.
“Also, you elbowed Tony Stark in the face,” Natasha added, and it was only then that the guy blanched. “Yeah next time you put up a fight make sure you know who you’re hitting.”
“I’m an Ant not a Bee,” Scott said to him.
“They told me not to rush over to you, that you wouldn’t take any of it well.”
“Tony,” he started but the other man held up his hand.
“No problem,” he couldn’t help but mumble, he wasn’t sure why he was shy about the whole thing, but when he saw Tony packing up his stuff, he wanted to stop him, he wanted a moment to get to know him a little better, even for just a second.
“You take your coffee too sweet and its gross, I hate drinking it when it’s yours,” Bucky said before pulling on a new shirt. “I have a date tonight, so I shouldn’t drink that shit anyway.”
They went back to the front of the ship, no one saying a word otherwise, the rest of the trip was a quiet one for all of them. Even as they got off the ship greeted by those left behind, they couldn’t bring themselves to say anything more than the truth. Tony left soon after the words had come out of his mouth, Steve still holding onto the jar that said Peter’s name. Everyone walking off, Thor talking to the last of his people, Bruce next to him seeking comfort from people who he had become friends with. Natasha going to Clint, hugging the kids telling them that they would be alright, they would find a way. She was still holding onto a bit of hope, when Steve was ready to give up.
“As in your childhood home, but I wasn’t supposed to meet your parents until tomorrow, you promised, I had flowers to buy and stuff like that.”
“All right. You heard my man,” Tony said before turning to Steve and planting a kiss on his lips. “When we get back, we’re going back to our room and having words,” he whispered to Steve with a wink before turning to Shuri, “Hit those keys Shuri.”
“Well this date is going a lot better than I had planned,” Steve smiled into the kiss. “Now let's go get dinner.”
Steve just mumbled to him before dozing off, which shouldn’t have been as cute as it was but honestly it was the best thing in the world. “J, put a timer on my watch for forty-five minutes please,” he said as he stood up from the bed and rushed off towards his workshop.
“Are you okay?” he asked once the doors had closed.
The ring was made specifically for Steve, with Tony’s pleasure in mind as well, he slipped it on before Steve could even make a comment about Tony calling his dick mini Cap, kissing the head of that beautiful cock as he pulled away, slowly slipping himself down until he was face to face with Steve’s hole. He couldn’t help but lick his lips as he pulled out the lube and coated his fingers, but before he placed his finger inside of Steve’s ass, he leaned in and sucked in one of Steve’s balls slowly working his finger around the rim as he did it. He could hear Steve growl from the top of the bed, but Tony ignored it and worked his way down, using his tongue to trace his way towards Steve hole and tentatively running his tongue around the rim as his finger worked its way inside. He didn’t want to go to fast, this was supposed to be a punishment, though it didn’t feel like it to Tony, hell it felt like he had gotten a prize at the moment, but he needed to keep going or else he was going to blow everything by coming just from opening Steve up.
