but for some reason this mysterious guy he can barely see one side of is suddenly
“Oooookay.” Claire pushes on, “
but Mr. Hunky Mysterious you've been ogling for the past hour," he says gesturing towards the tall green eyed, sleek haired, gorgeous Greek god, way out of Cas' league if you asked him right now after a few drinks. But the most obvious problem was that he wasn't playing for their team obviously! The women loved him!
. I think I'm a
How Jack made it through the garden, horse stalls, and cottages, without absolutely blowing everything he’ll never know.
Cas jumps, almost falling over but he catches himself. Looking around wildly for the source of the voice. His eyes land on a boy standing near the ponds edge, a bright red tee shirt catching Cas’ eye. A stark contrast to Cas’ blue collared button up.
“What is it? What’s wrong?” Cas ask worriedly.
“Seriously? You’re not in your best mental state.” She looks over him.
out.” They laugh, eyes wild taking a step closer.
Bobby rolls his eyes, "Ash is due here any minute, alright? Now, go!"
GUESS WHAT? THIS IS IT. THE FIRST DEANCAS INTERACTION🎉😍 Sit down. Buckle up. Please keep all hands inside the vehicle at all times. Caution there will be angst on this ride, but never fear it’s immediately followed by fluff. ENJOY!❤️🐝
"Alright, alright but only if you promise to drink. REALLY drink! I just want you to have fun," Gabriel smiles.
"Morning Bobby," Dean says as he slides out wiping his hands on his jeans.
Dean smiles,
"Oh! I definitely wanna go back," Castiel says trying to turn.
He tries focusing once more but sighs frustratedly. He shakes his head,
The guy chuckles, dear god honestly he chuckles.
“Down to business then.” They sigh tiredly, tentatively stepping back, palms up in surrender. “I have two of my best men posted outside your home. You have ten minutes to surrender the child.”
“It’s really ok. I don’t wanna take your lunch.” Cas objects.
.” Gabriel shakes his head.
Castiel's mind yells,
florist?” Gabriel calls out curiously, leaning against the stair post.
"Alright, alright! Leaving! Jerk!" Sam says continuing out of the garage.
“Do you know what happened to Dean Winchester? Why he left?” Jack ask dryly.
She fumes starting to stalk towards him, “YOOUU-“
"Come on, let's go," Dean says suddenly.
Anna laughs and is about to comment when the the glass doors to the gallary swing open wildly behind them.
Claire silently decides to back track in the diary. Reading some of the simpler, happier passages to her brother. They lose track of time drinking cheap whiskey and taking turns reading the worn leather bound book aloud. Jack finds out fast that he’s a tearful drunk, and Claire already knew she could hold her own quite well. Hours pass as the pages and passages fly by. The sun falling and and moon rising high.
Sighing heavily, his breath raggedy returns to normal. Cas rest his head against the cool wood headboard. The same nightmare he’d been haunted by for weeks. He can’t seem to blame himself really.
Dean gets between Crowley and Bobby, "Whoa there Mr. Crowley, first of all we fixed your car. If there
“It doesn’t make sense.” Gabriel turns away, head shaking, “That’s impossible-“
He wishes Gabriel were here. His elder brother was so much better at hypnosis. He was better at everything it seemed.
Cas’ up to his feet, looking every which way.
He breathes along with himself. Trying his best to remember each of Gabriel’s steps.
“It’s always the strictest parents,” Gabriel smiles ruefully, patting her shoulder. “Believe me, I helped your dad in and outta a lotta windows gumdrop.” Because of Dean Winchester, he thinks to himself.
“No- I didn’t mean it like-“ Dean groans dramatically, dropping his hands against his sides, they both hit his hips as his head rolls back. “What’s your name dude?” He looks back at Cas, hands on his hips.
“I think we should put it back-“ Jack barely gets out.
, feeling
“Gabriel?” Their mother asks appearing suddenly from around the corner. Barely glancing their way, a young woman on her arm. “Would you mind joining me with Ms. Hawthorn on our stroll through the aviary?”
“Yes-” Gabriel squints, ringing his hands, “yes and no. It’s more complicated than that. Because then you had the other side of the coin. The Winchester’s. Shifters who fought for humans and magical beings. Dean was the eldest son. Well him and your dad hit it off as kids and always kinda drifted together. Our mother and his dad hated it, despised it. So Cas told our mother he broke off the friendship, Dean did the same with his pop. Buuuut they didn’t. It’s a long story, your dads to tell. And again, I’m leaving out a hell of a lot. Eventually the war started, and your dad, being the total rebel that he is, kept meeting with Dean and eventually they ran away and started this ol’ place.” Gabriel gestures around them to the inn.
Dean stops Cas slamming down into a chair ungracefully and putting his finger against Cas’ lips.
Dean feels where Bobby's looking on his forehead and feels the bruise coming up, "Sam, showed up this morning while I was under the Mustang and caught me off gaurd."
“December 24, 2000: Sam’s going to propose to Jessica. Deans so happy for his brother. I can’t help but find joy in the small things during these dark times. The love between Sam and Jessica. Claire’s smile and laugh. Dean’s bottle green eyes. Claire took her first steps today on the porch. She’ll be running in the fields in no time. Playing with the other children, tumbling along with the pack. I don’t know what was more beautiful though. The moment she started walking or Dean’s magnificent smile when it happened. Both-”
They stay like that in silence for moment, just the two of them for the first time in weeks.
.” Kissing his cheek and running off as fast she appeared.
"So?" Castiel asks confused.
Dean turns around and comes back halfway yelling, "I'm dead serious! If I don't get a call back within 72 hours I'm gonna be so heart broken!"
“Can you reach that?” Claire groans, practically climbing up the rickety attic cabinet, trying her damnedest to reach the top. One eye on her brother, the other on her prize at the top of the shelves.
"Castiel! When was the last you got laid?!" Gabriel yells.
She flips open the worn buckle, clearing her throat as she reads the first passage her thumb finds aloud. “November 10, 1996. Today has been trying. Let the record state, it is a diary your honor.” Slamming it shut dramatically as she bounds over to the old couch they’d found in the attic years ago. She flips through the book quickly, falling in between the boxes she’d thrown down, “Look there’s a bunch of entries and doodles. I didn’t know dad could draw. It must be from during the war or something.”
“Dean,” Sammy called, bursting into his room. He relaxed when he saw Dean sitting on his bed, “You okay, dude?”
“Welcome in, go ahead and take a-” she turned around, stopping mid-sentence when she saw Dean.
Dean was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday after a thorough check-up. To say John was pissed would be an understatement. John Winchester was a mean drunk but even worse when sober and angry. No one was safe when he was mad. Dean took the brunt of the damage, protecting Sammy as best he could. The bruises he could blame on the accident. It was the words that did the real damage.
“Apartment 333?” Cas said when Dean stopped in front of the door.
Castiel gasped and choked on his spit. He doubled over coughing. Dean smacked his back until he could breathe again then rummaged around, grabbing a cup and getting Cas some water. “Thanks,” Cas managed to rasp.
“But-” Sam started.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You could come,” Dean offered. Cas looked at him, “It would be pretty boring and we wouldn’t be able to hang out for long but you could watch me play and maybe meet some of my friends.”
Cas was looking at him like he was a hurt puppy. Dean didn’t like telling people about his mom for that exact reason.
“Cas,” the other barista said as she placed his drinks on the empty counter. She smiled at him when he came to collect them, “Have a nice day!”
“Dean, wait,” he said. Dean stopped and started to raise himself onto his hands when Cas strategically flipped him over onto his back.
Cas wanted to sleep the headache off and never wake up again. The only thing that dragged him out of bed is wanting to visit Dean at the hospital. He sat up and gingerly opened his eyes, wincing at the thud in his head. He looked over at his dresser and found some aspirin and a glass of room temperature water left there by Balthazar. He silently thanked him before popping the pills into his mouth and swallowing them down with the water.
“What?” he asked groggily.
Mr. Shurley introduced him, “Everyone I’d like you to meet Dean Winchester. Please take a seat.”
“So you’re Cas, huh,” she said, giving him a once over, “I’m Charlie.”
Cas plated his feet, turning his back on the man, and looked at Meg, “I can’t. You know how I get around guys,” his fingers scratched unconsciously at the choker on his neck again.
Dean followed him to the kitchen, leaning on the counter and watching him rummage around. He pulled out 2 mugs and set them on the counter. Dean took in the sight before him. His eyes lingered on Cas’s ass, flicking up when he turned around.
Cas looked at him, “Uh, sure?”
“Oh, come on, Cas,” Gabe said exasperatedly, “live a little.”
After Dean was done talking to the other people in front of him he turned around and smiled.
Cas thought for a minute, face flushing as he realized what Dean meant. “Oh,” he murmured. They pulled into a parking lot, drawing Castiel out of his thoughts. Dean parked the car and turned off the engine.
Dean studied the face of the man above him. Eyes dragging across it and resting on the slightly chapped lips. They were only inches apart. Every inch of his body screamed at him to close the distance between them. To reach up and pull the other into a kiss.
Castiel’s mouth parted in a gasp as his eyes traced across the metal from the trunk to the hood. “This is yours?” He asked in awe.
“Anytime,” Gabe reassured him.
“Okay. How was class?” Cas responded. His voice sounded unused.
“No,” Cas lied, he could feel his ears heating up and hoped his dad didn’t notice them.
“Well, what the-” Gabriel started, his face quickly changed from confusion to realization, “Ooooh. You like him.”
“‘Morning,” the man grunted, releasing his lips from the mug they were latched on. He set it down on the table with a small clunk before going back to reading the paper.
“What is this place?” Cas asked, leaning forward to read the sign as he turned off the car.
“Thanks.” Cas smiled and did a little victorious fist pump.
That day, Cas felt more tired than usual. He’s had a long day. The spring musical had just started rehearsing, they were doing Little Women. As a part of the lighting team and being the stage manager, he had a lot to do and worked harder and later than normal. So when he went in that night to check on Dean and read him the usual story, he wound up falling asleep with his head on the edge of the hospital bed. He was torn from the abyss of a dreamless sleep by loud stomping and yelling. He peaked his eyes open just in time to catch a glimpse of a brown jacket before the person attached to it grabbed his arm tight and dragged him out of his chair viciously. Castiel fought back against his assailant as much as he could in his dazed state, smacking his head hard on the ground in the process. The man was shouting something as he dragged the struggling boy through a puddle of what he hoped to be spilled coffee in the doorway and out into the hall. Most of what he was shouting was incoherent but Cas managed to make out the words “fucking faggot”. The commotion quickly caught the attention of everyone in the immediate vicinity and probably farther. Security guards and nurses quickly took action, racing over and attempting to pull Castiel from the man’s tight grasp. Once free Cas skidded back to the nearest wall, stunned and confused. He looked and identified his attacker to be none other than John Winchester, Dean’s father. Cas, still weak from his recent nap and probable concussion looked at him, perplexed, as he continued to yell slurs and other things towards him. “You stay away from my son! Stay away you fucking fag!” he screamed over and over as security guards dragged him away.
Once he could breathe again, he walked back over to the window and shut the curtains promptly. This wasn’t the first time he’d accidentally seen Dean naked. It was the first time he’d seen Dean naked..like that.
“Yes, why do you ask?” Castiel answered.
“I know a place,” Dean chuckled, “No, it’s not the movies. You’ll have to drive. How’s today after school?”
Cas looked at Dean’s arm, he pulled it down to his side, “Why?”
“There was a,” he faltered, “situation. We couldn’t get it.”
What he hadn’t expected was a plethora of his classmates attempting to fight their way into the hospital. It appeared that half the school, Seniors and Juniors mostly, had heard of Dean’s accident and were here to pay their respects. Security guards were struggling to herd the masses into a sort of line. Some girls held bundles of flowers or balloons, others chocolates or cards. The boys mostly came empty-handed. A few held footballs or cards. Cas hadn’t thought to bring anything, mostly because Dean was in a coma and wouldn’t need any of those.
“You don’t know that,” he shot back, tears stinging his eyes. He hid them in his hands to stop Sam from seeing them.
“Oh,” Cas said, shoveling another spoonful of cereal into his mouth. His guilt nearly spilled over at the comment.
“I might have found a way to defeat her.” Sam offered the book to Dean, who had just taken another big bite of cheeseburger, causing Sam to retract his offer and instead read it out loud to him, “it says here we need something called the “Arrow of Brahma”, I haven’t been able to find a location but we can run things over with Cas back at the bunker.”
“What?” Cas exclaimed, “How?”
“Give me a minute,” Cas groaned. His legs felt weak. It had been more than a while since he’d done anything like this.
“Uh, yeah. My dad had an early meeting and had to borrow my car.” Dean responded with a chuckle.
An attractive boy with black hair sat in the back corner of the semi-crowded class. He was staring out a nearby window. There was a look of disinterest shrouded on his slightly stubbly face. He was the first thing Dean noticed as he walked into the noisy and crowded class. Some students looked his way when he entered the classroom. The teacher cleared his throat to introduce the new student. They quickly silenced, turning to the front to face the pair. Dean was nervous but he smiled at them confidently. He was used to moving around and going to new schools. Dean’s gaze wandered over the other students before returning to the attractive boy who hadn’t bothered looking towards the front.
“You were saying?” Charlie asked, a smug smile on her face.
“No,” Dean said, batting away his hand. His hand froze in the air, shock taking over the pained look on his face, “Weird.” Castiel squinted at him, head tilted in confusion. Dean blew it off, slowly getting up. He hissed, hand grasping at his side again. “Let’s go,” he said once he’d steadied himself again.
Rowena hummed, leaning down to inspect him. “Interesting,” she smiled, “and this all started when you touched the crystal?”
“Oh,” Cas said, disappointment leaking into his voice.
“I am beyond done for the day,” Charlie said with an exaggerated yawn and stretch. Dean rolled his eyes but followed her up. She pulled him into a hug, “Don’t fuck this up, Winchester,” she whispered in his ear, pulling away with a wink. The sky was starting to grow dark as the sun set lower on the horizon. “It was nice to meet you, Cas. You should come to more of these.”
He picked up his phone, still ignoring Dean’s messages, and hauled himself off the floor. He splashed some cool water on his face before leaving the bathroom. When he got back to the room Balthazar was awake, a silhouette in the moonlight shining through the window.
Eli: I’m glad you texted! :) I was a bit worried there ngl
Dean balled his fists on the table and placed his head on them briefly before the waitress came over to their table.
Dean moved over to Cas, getting uncomfortably close, before he reached around him and poured himself a cup of coffee. Cas looked slightly panicked at the act but calmed down once Dean sat at the table.
“Dean,” Cas called, shoving around people. Eventually, he made it outside and saw Dean tripping down the driveway. He ran after him, still calling. Either Dean didn’t hear him or he was ignoring Cas. Cas ran after him the best he could in his own slightly drunken state, following him around the corner and down the street to where the black chevy from earlier was parked. Dean was fumbling with his keys in a futile attempt to unlock his car.
“I almost didn’t,” Cas chuckled around the lip of his own bottle, “But, I am glad I came.”
“Why?” Cas asked.
The only evidence that last night had actually happened was the blinding headache Cas got when he opened his eyes the next morning. The curtains were open just enough to spill light across Cas’s hungover face. He groaned and pulled one of his blankets over his head.
After Dean got his drink, he grabbed Charlie and tugged her back into the crowd to dance.
“Hiya, Cas!” He yelled.
“Yeah, I got it from my old man,” Dean smiled as he watched Cas. He walked over and unlocked the door, holding it open for Cas, who promptly sat down. He twisted every which way, admiring the classic car.
“You don’t remember,” Cas muttered.
Dean thought for a minute, “We could go to the movies,” Dean said, a smirk spreading across his face.
Charlie: I need a favor...
That smile.
Though I am writing another extra chapter I may not publish it so let me know if you want me to. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you had as much fun as I did!
“Leave it,” Dean said, grabbing his wrist to stop him.
Cas grabbed a fry with his free hand, shoving it in his mouth. It was good, better than McDonald’s. He grabbed another, contemplating asking for ranch to dip them in.
Cas smiled, “Do you know where we are?”
He wasn’t expecting a response but had been proven wrong.
“Stay. I’m gonna go see if we have any books on the Arrow.” Sam said, nudging Dean towards the brightly lit table in the center of the room where Cas was sitting.
“Whatever you say, Casanova,” Dean muttered. Cas chuckled a bit at the comment. Dean smiled, pulling him into another kiss. “You are
“Dean,” was all Cas said, giving the other two a stern look.
Then, something hit.
The first thing that Cas noticed when he walked into the hospital room was the sudden emptiness. Someone had gotten rid of all the flowers, cards, bears, and other gifts that had littered the room. The only thing that remained was the painting of flowers on the wall that belonged to the hospital. His eyes trailed back to Dean who, somehow, looked even more lifeless without the various sympathy gifts that used to surround him.
She tucked the tray she’d been holding under her arm and walked back to the counter. Cas looked at him curiously. Dean shrugged the look off, grabbing a fry and dunking it in the shake.
Read 12:34 AM
Cas paused for a moment before asking, “How do you take it?”
Cas frowned a bit at that, thinking.
“It’s the best I could do, we don’t have many options,” Dean said. Sammy rolled his eyes but grabbed the hotdog anyway, letting out a satisfied hum as he bit into it. Dean took the seat right next to him. They ate quickly and quietly. Sam kept glancing at him, worry lingering in his gaze.
“I have a shower,” Dean said, following him off the counter, “and a change of clothes.” He wrapped his arms around Castiel’s waist and raising his eyebrows.
Bobby had excused himself shortly after dinner. Sam and Eileen followed suit.
Dean picked at the blanket, not looking up, “I should have done more. I should have told him I-” he cut off, realizing what he was about to say. “I should have figured something else out,” he corrected.
Dean had not expected to see Cas at the party, and he DEFINITELY didn’t expect him to look so, well, hot.
Dean stared at him, a smile breaking out on his face when he realized what Cas was asking. “Oh, you mean this.” He stuck out his tongue, showing Cas a shiny silver piercing. Cas just looked at him wide-eyed. “I told you I had other piercings,” he laughed.
Dean never paid attention in Economics. It had to be the most boring class that he had. Lucky for him it wasn’t hard to distract himself from the seemingly eternal boringness of the class. His eyes dragged across the board at the front of the room. They picked out every small detail, eventually coming to a stop at the date on the edge of the board. Wednesday, February 12th. Two more days before the weekend. He sighed in defeat. The only thing he had to look forward to was pre-calc in the morning. Dean’s mind wandered to the handsome boy who sat behind him.
Dean had been to his fair share of high school and college parties in his years. They usually involved a lot of drugs, alcohol, and drunk people trying to get laid. He would often get drunk and hit on people until he got bored or got in a fight and got thrown out. None of this was helped by his lack of need to worry. What can he say, he’s got daddy issues. Sammy would be fine on his own for the night. This had become routine for him and his brother.
Castiel visited Dean every chance he could, which was basically after school and whenever he could get the car or when the busses aligned with his schedule. He wound up taking care of Dean more than his father did, changing the water to the gradually dying flowers, shaving his face, checking in with the nurses to see how he was doing, and, his personal favorite thing to do, sitting in one of the nearby chairs or on the edge of the bed and just reading to Dean. Whenever he read aloud, he felt a connection to Dean and he was sure that Dean felt it too because when Cas read to him his fingers twitched and he started to mumble, though Cas could never understand the words. Currently, Cas was reading The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, recommended by Charlie. Occasionally Cas would just sit on the edge of the bed and hold Dean’s hand, just so he would know he wasn’t alone.
“You had enough time for a staring contest though?” Charlie asked, sarcasm dripping from her voice. Dean’s face flushed. Charlie put a hand on his shoulder, “Dean, you’ve been pining over this man for months. He clearly likes you. What’s the problem?”
“Right, the whole ‘I raised you from perdition’ thing.”
“Oh, did he now?” Gabe wiggled his eyebrows playfully.
“Cas’’ a whisper.
“No,” Sam said, obviously lying. He looked away from Dean, fidgeting with his sleeve, “Are you okay?”
“You got this,” she said, shoving him again, hard enough to make him stumble and almost fall. Almost being that he suddenly found himself clutched between a strong pair of arms. He opened his eyes cautiously, surprised to find a pair of green ones staring back at him.
“Cas?” he said, voice breaking slightly, “Cas, what is this?”
“Alright,” Cas said, pulling out of Dean’s arms. “I should probably go home to shower and change,” he shifted uncomfortably in his pants.
It all seemed so familiar. Like a distant memory that he couldn’t quite put his finger on.
Dean went to take another drink from the cup in his hand but Charlie quickly snatched it from him, drawing a whimper out of him. “I think you’ve had enough, let's go find you somewhere to lie down,” Charlie wrapped his arm around her back and pulled him up. He clung to her like she was the last thing on earth. She mouthed a silent “sorry” at the other girl before dragging him back out into the hallway.
They read through all the books in the library with no luck on finding its location. At that point Dean was almost completely knocked out. He heard Cas say something about using his angelic powers to look for it but Dean was too tired to register what his actual words were. He checked the time on his phone, it was almost two in the morning which didn’t seem too late but Dean had only gotten a few hours of beauty sleep the night before. He stood and mumbled something about hay to Sam before finding his way to his room. The second his head hit the pillows he was out, not even bothering to change out of his sweaty clothes. That night he dreamed happily about guns and a certain pair of blue eyes.
“Nice to meet you, Charlie,” he answered, shaking her hand. He was about to ask what she meant by her comment when Dean walked in.
“Yeah, sorry,” Cas answered. The lunch bell rang, saving him. He stood up quickly, grabbing his bag and tray, “I better go. I’ll see you after school?” he asked Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas was sure he was still asleep and this was a dream. If it was a dream, he and Dean would be a lot closer. Cas risked another glance up at Dean and found him staring back. Something moved outside the kitchen window, drawing Cas’s attention. His face fell when he saw the light on in Dean’s room.
His dad paused, “The hospital told me what happened.”
“Well you see,” Rowena said, grabbing his hand and placing it on Dean’s shoulder. She studied Dean’s reaction as she continued to explain, “That was no ordinary crystal. Though I’m not sure why it affected you two.”
Sam looked and immediately looked back at Dean with an annoyed face.
Cas whipped around, surprised at the sudden words. He quickly hid the paper he was holding behind his back.
“Dammit,” he muttered, “dammit, dammit, dammit, DAMMIT!” He sat up, overwhelmed with emotions. Unsure of whether he wanted to laugh, cry, or punch something.
“Uh, egg white Omelette with coffee, please.” He responded with a respective grin. He was always too formal when ordering food, Dean thought.
Hey guys! My last chapter and first post on this very confusing website got 2 Kudos and 33 Hits which doesn't seem like much but I'm so proud of myself! It would be amazing if I got more! Anyway I hope you enjoyed this chapter. I didn't mean for it to be all from Cas's POV but I got kinda carried away and I didn't want to have too many words. 2k seems like a lot but once you get into your writing it turns out to be a lot less then one would think. This chapter was also hecca late but I went on like 3 vacations in a row so it was hard to find time and privacy to write. School is starting up again soon as well so either expect a lot more a lot quicker or a lot less. I hope you're all staying safe and remembering to wear masks during this virus!
Dean smiled and let out a small chuckle at the sight. He had to force down the temptation to reach out and wipe away the spittle. Dean’s chair creaked loudly when he sat down making him wince. Castiel immediately sat up. His ocean blue eyes looked dazed from sleep. They stared directly at Dean for a while, not fully registering what was happening. Dean felt his face start to heat up as he tried to hold back a laugh. Cas made a sudden gasp of realization. His eyes cleared and widened as his cheeks began to turn pink. He wiped the drool from his cheek and ran out of the classroom.
When Dean speaks up roughly, “You better be in this bed in ten seconds Cas.”
“You can fix it though right.” Gabriel eyes the horizon wearily.
“But I wanna share. Think of it like a thank you for playing tag.” Dean smiles, shaking the offered sandwich half.
as you call 'em. Let's get to work."
"Really?" Cas is shocked, not for the first time that night. He wants to ask Dean more but doesn’t want to poke and prod. But then Dean is drunk out of his mind so…. "About what?" Cas says beginning to massage Dean’s scalp.
“CAAAS!” Dean cries out further away.
"Not just
-“ Cas protest, pulling on his brothers pant leg. “I don’t wanna-“
Cas winces, ready for Mary or Ellen to scold him but it doesn’t happen.
Gabriel rears back eyes wide, “GEEZ- You read it?!” Looking to Claire, “You corrupted your brother, I’m proud of you BUT that’s for another time-” Looking back to them both, but obviously contemplating his next actions before sighing heavily. “Talk about a rock and a hard place. You’re dads already gonna kill me or send me into the next dimension when he finds out about this,” Gabriel massages his temple, “SO I might as well have fun before I inevitably die…” Gabriel collects himself, trying to choose his words carefully. Gods I knew this day would come but couldn’t I have got some damn warning? He chides himself. Huffing as he looks between the two persistent Novak’s. “The cliff notes version is… Dean Winchester... The Winchesters were an odd constant in our lives growing up. They were always kinda there. You know about about our parents. Well the Winchesters were sorta one of their biggest enemies. They were everything The Miltons weren’t. Fighters for the little people.” Gabriel sing songs, hooking his elbow, as he pacing anxiously. “You either loved the Winchesters or you hated them. Our mother tried to make alliances with them but Dean’s father refused every time. He wasn’t really the ‘alliance’ kinda guy. He hated magic users as much as our parents and family disliked shifters. Did I mention that?” Jack and Claire both shake their heads. “Yeaah. So you had two sides of a coin. One side was the miltons, rich elite prissy magical bags of dicks who thought they deserved everything, literally they wanted to rule over everyone.”
“I’m sorry little bro. I couldn’t resist.” He laughs quietly.
“Claire?” He calls out aimlessly. “Dean?!”
Meet Castiel Novak, owner of The Beehive Inn, busying himself in the garden and totally not avoiding his brother. While Claire and Jack get sidetracked once again with their father’s diary and cheap alcohol. (*Note: Claire and Jack are both over 21 in this AU)
“I don’t know if I should impressed or mortified.” Jack sighs heavily, eyeing his sister.
“JACKPOT! Look, it’s a diary” Claire giggles maniacally, practically shaking with excitement.
“Oh, save it.” The attacker grabs Cas’ chin, “I have tiptoed through all your little tulips. Your
Mary laughs to herself amusedly watching dean run off. Dean spends the twenty minutes doing his best to wrangle a very confused Cas around the grass. Cas who just wants try and understand the dynamics of tag. Dean who didn’t realize you could ask so many questions about tag.
“Oh hell no. This is waaayyy too much power for you two knuckleheads. If your father had any idea you found this, and knew I knew, HAH! All three of our heads, ON A PLATTER.” Gabriel motions exploding, “Meltdown of the century.”
Sam's? No one home. And even if Sam was there he'd been getting on Dean's nerves the last few weeks with the whole 20 questions gig.
“To hell you are.” Castiel grounds out, looking them dead in the eyes.
Dean left the dishes for later, instead, digging in the fridge for another beer. He grabbed two, handing one to Cas before popping his open and leaning against the counter. Cas accepted it, leaning across from Dean on the island.
Just then the final bell rang, cueing them out of class and school for the weekend.
“No,” Cas replied cautiously.
It started soft with their lips barely on eachother. Dean grabbed Cas’s face to keep him close as he pressed further into the kiss. Cas moved his hand from Dean’s cheek up to his still wet hair. It felt cool as it slid through his fingers but it quickly warmed at his touch.
Dean took it gratefully, “Thanks, make yourself at home,” he gestured to the living room and walked over to the kitchen.
“At least it’s mine, you still drive around in your daddy’s car.” Anna retorted. Gabe flashed her a look of fake insult before rolling his eyes.
Dean's perspective of waking up from the coma and a little bit of a hint at the next part of the series.
The name registered in the back of Cas’s head just in case he needed to know it. Cas only moved when Dean sat down in front of him. He looked at him in surprise. There were a lot of other empty seats in the classroom. He dismissed the thought creeping up in his head. Cas’s heart was beating quickly.
When Chuck arrived at the hospital to pick Cas up, he found him sleeping in the chair once again. A barely visible bruise had formed just below his hairline. Chuck managed to nudge him awake so he could help him to the car and get him home.
“Well somebody did something. A huge faction of angels just found their way into Kansas.”
Dean grumbles and snatches the spray bottle of bleach from Cas’s hands. They start to tackle the mess. They work well together, mostly in silence, but Dean can’t help but feel as if there’s still distance between them. Cas moves in a controlled – almost calculated – fashion. When he does this Dean feels the oppression of it too. It’s a weight that neither of them deserves to feel. So, while they kneel, watching wasted wine saturate off-brand paper towels, Dean takes another figurative step forward.
“Wait,” Dean interrupts with incredulity. “Cas – Cas that wasn’t what I meant.”
“Alright!” he holds his hands up in surrender. “Fine. Pitch in if you want, but don’t come crying to me when Cas starts asking you to do his laundry.”
But there’s still Castiel. Castiel stays quiet and it eats away at Dean. There’s so much to be said. There’s so much Dean wants to ask, but he also doesn’t want to poke a sleeping giant. He can’t imagine what Cas is feeling… mostly because Cas won’t tell him. Sure, the guy eats and sleeps on a regular schedule. He even complains about what Crowley picked up for him at the thrift store. They all laugh at his insistence that, despite what seems to be the going trend, he’s just not a plaid
Kevin seems far more relaxed.
“Uh… No.”
sweats.
“The trench coat! It’s what he’s known for… in some circles. That and the backwards tie.” Charlie starts to circle Cas like a cat does a wounded bird. She’s studying him. Waiting. Scheming. “Seriously, you’ve gone and
“You think… Crowley?” Sam shuts his journal and sets it aside.
“That’s my Cas. Now come
“What?” Dean grumbles, snatching the remote off the coffee table and returning to the couch. He doesn’t sit quite as close as before, but he also doesn’t put as much space between Cas and himself as he really could. It’s a compromise, he decides, but a compromise of what? As the previews roll, he props his bare-feet atop the table and crosses his arms. Cas is still watching him.
The town of Lebanon, Kansas boasts a population just under 300. Most of these people are longtime small-towners. They live and die in their isolated communities. They take in the fresh country air each morning and tend to their rural gardens with a sense of ancient and unusual pride. Technology has been slowly seeping into the pores of small town America, but not in Lebanon. These people do not feel the draw of modern comforts. Cell phones are for business men, computers for programmers. It is a fascinatingly old community. People still drive to their neighbors’s homes to borrow cups of sugar and invite each other over to Sunday dinner. The idea of the church potluck is alive and well here. God is carved into the bones of every hardworking farmer and he drips from their brows as they labor in the warm Kansas sunshine. They do American work, with American values, in the name of The American Dream. Even when that dream breaks down. Even when it disintegrates entirely like topsoil in a dust storm. They cannot be moved. Lebanon is a town of survivors.
There’s a heavy silence. Sam sighs again.
Castiel did not turn to look at Dean, but kept his head downcast.
“I am no longer an Angel of The Lord, but yes. My name is Cast—”
I apologize for the wait. I'm seriously embarrassed with how long this took me to write and I'm sorry I left you guys hanging. I also apologize that this chapter isn't full of excitement. This is one of the reasons it took me so long to churn out. But it's a necessary chapter and I hope you enjoy it nonetheless!
And then, in an act of unspeakable cruelty, Dean begins to sing.
“I know it’s not you, Cas. It can’t be you”—Dean found it necessary to clear his throat—“I saw those bigmouths rip you from the inside out.”
Kevin scowls. “This isn’t my fault.”
idea!” Kevin wipes tears from his eyes and tries to stop giggling and hiccuping. Dean’s very glad that Kevin has been able to loosen up since joining them in Lebanon, but the drinking is worrisome. Not that Dean can really talk.
“What song?”
After his initial indulgence, Dean recalled flopping onto one the motel’s single beds. His face had been pressed into freshly laundered pillow cases, but they’d still smelt stale. His mind had wandered and tripped over passing thoughts. There’d been slick black pools of leviathan and headless corpses and inexpertly tied ties. At some point he’d heard the slam of a door.
“I don’t know.”
“… Maybe?!”
“I understand, Dean. Thank you.”
“Oh…”
A million excuses flooded to the forefront of Dean’s mind, but for the first time ever he chose to dismiss those things instead of his initial impulses. Maybe all of this was true. Maybe he was… something else— and that was okay. Maybe he didn’t know himself as well as he thought. It didn’t really matter.
“No. We don’t. Well, Sam seems to a little. I’m not so sure.”
It’s why The Men of Letters chose to erect their home base in the middle of such an antiquated world. They recognized the timelessness of the people and their lives. They knew this tradition would carry on and their secrets would forever remain hidden behind hospitality and faultless courtesy. They knew they had nothing to fret in little God-fearing Lebanon.
“This… this is being a human.”
“Okay, why are you
to update your knowledge of pop culture. The eighties references are getting painful, Dean.
Sam looks up from his Journal again.
“Apparently,” shrugs Sam. Charlie still looks wary, but shakes Crowley’s hand anyway.
“I know…” Cas looks at his feet. “I’ve let you down. I don’t deserve anymore chances and I don’t expect a ‘pass’ from you. I –“
“Cut him some slack? All anyone’s done since he fell is ‘cut him some slack!’ I’m kind of fucking tired of tiptoeing around him.”
I also apologize, perhaps unnecessarily, that this chapter is fluff-city. I promise this thing has a plot! That I have in fact outlined! And that has all the elements of a plot! It is plot-tastic!
“I don’t know, what do you think?” she asks Dean when he approaches.
It’s not even an interesting drive to Smith Center. There’s nothing to look at, Kansas having a distinct lack of impressive scenery or interesting geographical phenomena. They follow a single road all the way west until they hit civilization. It’s a straight shot and a fairly short one.
“It’ll go quickly, I promise,” says Charlie with finality.
When he pushes past the front door and into the shop, a wall of cold air meets him. The AC is cranked to the max and a little chill runs down his spine as he surveys the place. The clothing is hung on different sized racks all around the store and there appears little method to the madness. Some racks tower over others. Some are organized by color, others by style, and some by no discernible characteristic at all. The single cashier, an older woman with a beehive, glares at Dean from over the pages of her periodical. Dean spots the top of Cas’s head by the far back wall and moves in that direction. When he finds his way through the mess of the store, he sees that Charlie’s got a couple of different shirts by the hangers. She holds them up one at a time in front of Cas’s chest.
The laughter from the table is right on cue and Charlie leans back in her chair to survey them all with a smug smile.
Charlie looks at her feet and starts to pick at one of her fingernails.
Dean pulls up in front of one of two clothing stores in town and lets Charlie and Cas get out before he goes to find a parking spot. He parks quickly in an effort to guarantee he doesn’t miss the opening act of what’s sure to be a show worth watching. Knowing Cas and Charlie, they’ll all get kicked out in no time for generally unacceptable behavior. The whole outing vaguely reminds him of that ridiculous incident at the brothel – Cas looking all terrified and debauched, a half-naked prostitute screaming at him to get the hell out of her sight. Dean shakes his head and chuckles under his breath as he rounds the outside corner of the consignment store.
It’s about time he changed his sheets anyway.
“Oh. My. God. Oh my
“Sure,” Dean says, standing up from the bed and stretching. “I mean, it’s not like I

“Unless Kevin—”
our angel?”
Dean looks up for a moment over her head. Sam’s still scrolling through his and Charlie’s phones with a puzzled expression, but Cas stares straight back at Dean. He tilts his head sideways in a familiar manner. There’s something strange about his expression though. It’s a mixture of surprise and something else Dean can’t quite place. He supposes Cas has always been a little confused by public displays of affection. He dismisses it as Charlie pulls out of their hug and hits him on the chest a couple of times.
The surface doesn’t stay placid for long, though.
about certain things, I’d probably try to cave your head in too. So, yeah, it matters,” says Dean.
– COME ON! SING ALONG –
Cas stares at Dean and his whole face turns bright pink.
“Right. Kirk’s like Spock’s opposite in a lotta ways. He’s hotheaded, goes with his gut, a real ladies man. But… you know. They make a good team.”
“What texts?” asks Sam, immediately reaching into his pocket to fish out his phone.
Sam sighs. “What do we do?”
“I don’t know about the cardigan but this shirt fits you perfectly. How’s it feel?”
“It’s not my fault!” she shouts. “You should have seen the fandom!”
Again, I owe the world to my fabulous Beta
Dean finds himself outside Castiel’s bedroom, a fist held inches from the surface of the shut door. He stands there, frozen like an idiot, and tries to decide whether having this conversation with Cas is even worth it. It’s not like he can just snap Cas out of whatever mood he’s in. He’s not a freaking miracle worker. So why in the hell do Kevin and Sam expect Dean to know how to make it all better? What do they expect him to be able to accomplish here?
Dean couldn’t tell at the time whether Cas was asking him or the tattoo artist.
“Winchesterfied? That’s
The downside to such a place is the same as its upside: There is no convenience, nor modernity. The nearest decently sized shops are a good thirty minutes west in the marginally larger borough of Smith Center. Most necessities are regularly stocked at The Lebanon General Store, but occasions like Charlie’s intended shopping spree require a bit of trip. It’s not as if Smith Center offers too much more of a selection, but it’s a considerably better spread than The Thrift ‘N Save puts forth. So, they make the drive – Charlie and Dean and Cas.

Something smushed up against the back of his skull told him he had.
Just wanted to thank all of my readers again for being so patient and generous with their kind words and encouragement! I am determined not to let you down. See you in a week! I PROMISE.
Silence. Cas didn’t move. Dean slid his hands down his face and took a deep breath.
Dean has no clue how he’s supposed to handle it, but he doesn’t crack. He is all smiles and hot soup and pats on the back. Crowley is surprisingly helpful. He does the dishes. He goes on grocery runs. Sometimes Dean hears the former demon sobbing at night from the room they’ve set him up in, but he doesn’t put his damage on display. Crowley doesn’t admit that he’s trying to atone for all of the shit he’s done in the past. He just makes shopping lists and scrubs the pots and pans.
“You are
Dean notes) he presses play on the remote and settles in for The Kobayashi Maru and Ricardo Montalban. As the film progresses he finds himself explaining aspects of the plot to Cas, who nods and follows the details surprisingly well.
god. If I had only listened to any other instinct but my own, I might have had a chance... But in the end, I have always been a soldier – just an infantryman. My ego has cost me everything.I even lost the one thing that made me of use in your war and what does that leave me? What does that make me?”
It would be different than living with a brother. It would be undoubtedly different. But that didn’t make his interest… that didn’t mean… did it? Dean lay on his back with the cracked motel ceiling above him and sifted through those intentions, opening them up for scrutiny. It hadn’t been a fluke. Just recalling the dream sent a certain sort of warmth to his abdomen.
Cas nods and exits while Dean stoops to start collecting the bigger pieces of debris. He runs Cas’s little explosion over again in his head. He hopes that he got his point across. He hopes this means that Cas is on the road to accepting his new circumstances. Lord knows Cas can deny trauma with the best of ‘em. Maybe that’s even Dean’s fault a little – learning to handle emotional strife using The Winchester Method is ill advised at best and permanently psychologically damaging at worst. The truth of the matter is that seeing Cas so…
Cas narrows his eyes for a split second and crosses the length of the mat.
Cas lunges forward and catches Dean off guard. He’s forced to dive hard to his right and slams his shoulder against the mat, which only moderately softens his fall. Cas turns to attack again, but topples over when Dean trips him with his legs. This provides a small window in which for Dean to get back on his feet, but Cas recovers quickly. He kneels, swiping at Dean’s ankles. The two of them fight with skill and vigor. Neither proves to have a distinct advantage over the other, only different styles of combat. It’s an oddly complimentary arrangement. Cas moves like a cat, graceful, darting, even under the constraints of his flesh. He does not hesitate. He only acts.  Dean, meanwhile, eschews subtlety for raw power and forces Cas back with every indelicate attack.
"Fine, be pissed all you want. I've got bad news anyway."
on me.”
“But you didn’t have to do anything!” Says Dean heatedly, still wondering how anyone could find their pain and misery so fucking entertaining. Crowley leans back against one of their wall instruments and tries not to smile. He is unsuccessful in this endeavor.
“Oh, I don’t think I’m the one who needs to worry about his ass.”
let it come to that.
Charlie smiles at Kevin. Dean fears the kid might faint in his weakened state.
“What’s this about now?” Dean grumbles, turning away from Sam– who’s trying desperately to find the right page in his book again.
“You weren’t… You weren’t trying to watch over me… were you?”
“But Kirk… Kirk is human.” Cas continues to fight the drugs that are now holding him captive on the edge of unconsciousness.
“Thanks, Cas! That’s… Just – Thanks.”
Dean’s eyebrows shoot towards his hairline. He thought Cas had been doing better.
Thing is, Dean actually kind of enjoyed himself. But he can’t just admit that. Not to Sam. He remembers the Zeppelin shirt tucked inside his dresser and feels a warm little twinge in his chest.
And remembering the pressure of those lips and the soft scrape of that stubble sent Dean upright with a jolt. His desire to…
“What’d he say?” asks Sam. He shares a worried look with Dean.
,” Dean stutters, “is this even here? In a thrift store? In East Jesus, Nowhere?!”
“Maybe you misplaced it?”
Kevin is… Kevin.
“Don’t do that,” Dean says.
The shirt that Cas wears beneath a stylish tweed blazer, and that Dean begins to inspect, is a Zeppelin tour t-shirt from Knebworth Park, 1979. It features The Swan Man – his countenance much like an angel’s, his feathered wings spread wide. He appears to fall from the black and starry heavens. Dean grabs at the bottom of the shirt and pulls it outward to get a better look at the design. Cas seems completely bewildered by the action and turns a little red as Dean exposes the top of his beltline and a portion of his lower abdomen.
Cas has retreated to his curtained stall and Charlie just smirks, scooping up half of the “buy” pile and leaving the rest for Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cured? You can cure demons now?”
“Well,” she says, “I think we can risk one teensy little trip topside for something as vital as this.”
Almost all of them blame Castiel for The Fall.
It takes Dean a while to find the hidden dirt path; it lurks behind a gnarled oak tree. The hairs on the back of his neck stand on end when he first spots it and any remaining hope that the whole thing's a fluke slips from his grasp. The sun draws closer to the horizon as he pushes past the brush and into the woods. The branches of the surrounding trees hang low over the trail. For something supposedly used so recently, the walkway screams of neglect. When Dean finally makes it out of the weeds, he hits a clearing. A large, round clearing cut from the thick of the forest. Once again, something about the area sets off Dean's sense of impending danger. His fingers grip the handle of the gun resting at the small of his back.
“Fashion is identity, Dean! Cas is human now, right?” She glances up at Cas. He nods. “Yes. And that means he has the right to personal expression – Clothing, being a major element in the exhibition of one’s inner self.”
Charlie sends Cas back into the dressing room with a new set of hangers and returns to her seat. She immediately picks up her and Dean’s conversation.
“And I’m Kevin. Kevin Tran. Prophet, actually – I’m a prophet.” Kevin steps directly in front of Crowley to grab Charlie’s hand with an anxious smile. He winces a little as he speaks, the hangover still working its magic. There’s a moment of awkward silence. The kid looks at her like he’s never seen a woman before. To be fair, he hasn’t exactly been in the presence of a woman who wasn’t his mother in a considerable amount of time. There’s no harm in having a little crush, Dean thinks. It’s not as if he’s got a snowball’s chance in hell with her anyway.
“I’m not used to being confined to the dimensions of this form. I’m curious to see how it affects my movement. Under pressure. Plus it might… help… things.”
“What the hell’s that supposed to mean? Hey! Don’t you walk away from me! What do you want me to do then, huh?” Dean shouts as Kevin heads for the staircase of the control room.
off Death’s doorstep. Actually, I’m pretty sure the next time I die I get some sort of reward for my customer loyalty.”
“I’m… done
He re-enters the control room as Charlie delivers the punchline to her story.
Cas looks very nervous.
Their hug was now stretching past a reasonable length, but neither of them had the heart to pull away. Dean could hear Cas’s breath coming in shorter and shorter bursts and he could feel a knot begin to twist inside his stomach. Far on the other side of the meadow the nameless man began to laugh with uncontained glee. His kite was spinning and spiraling through the air, performing a series of acrobatics that should have grounded it. It kept flying despite this.
“I didn’t mean to wake you,” he whispers softly, his voice low and gruffer than usual.
Dean tosses the clothes he’s been holding over the left arm of a couch just outside a row of curtained changing stalls. Charlie’s already picking through the pile as she mutters under her breath. Her thin fingers make quick work of things and she soon sends Cas off with an outfit and a flick of her wrist. Cas does as he’s told. However reluctantly.
Cas huffs in irritation. Dean sighs, remembering their conversation about trust. He figures practicing what he preaches might not be such a bad start.
Dean rolls his eyes and pulls Cas close, "For what! Doing my civic duty? I don't care what he does."
“OH? HOW
.” He smiles forcefully.
🐝Ello lovelies!
"Should I tell Samantha to can it?" Dean asks sleepily.
"Hey, whoa! You're a loopy and gold digger drunk? Huh, who knew?" Gabriel says looking over Castiel then pulling him back away.
Gabriel?
“Yes,
“Would you just-“ she steals the book away.

Early morning light just beginning to stream under the curtains edges.
"What happened?" Cas realizes people are beginning to stare and takes Dean down the short hall to his office, closing the door behind them. "Dean's what's wrong? Is someone hurt? Are you hurt? Is it Sam?" Cas runs his hand along Deans cheek and slowly brings Dean's face up.
Gabriel’s eye strain before widening in shock, “Holy Mary, Moses, and Josè. Where’d you find that? Better question-“ he swipes it away before they can protest.
Sam comes singing lowly down the hall an hour later “
"No Cas! ‘Be ASSERTIVE and YOU WILL WIN
Dean stares at him for a moment. Cas is afraid for a moment thinking he should have lied.
“Really?” Claire lights up immediately. “How? Where?”
He remembers Gabriel reciting. Cas feels calmness wash over him, at ease. Smiling to himself as he eyes the bee softly once more. “Hello there.” He leans upon the railing, kneeling on the bench. His palm gently reaching for the purple flowers, “it’s ok little buddy.” The bee leaps down, buzzing from bloom to bloom, inching closer to Cas’ palm.
"Hey I'm sorry man, I just.. I suck at this okay," he laughs lightly.
"Ohhhhh no, no, no. Not on my watch. Come on, let's get ya somethin' to drink!" Gabriel beams dragging Castiel through the bodies towards the bar.
Dean says matter-of-factly, "I punched a guy!"
"Thank you Dean," Cas smiles. He’d always been fond of drunk-Dean. He was so carefree. Cas imagined it was what Dean would be like without hunting or the heartbreak he’d been forced to go through.
Cas smiles and rests his head atop Dean’s kissing his forehead, “I love you too,” Cas whispers.
he stares at Deans hand once more.
Gabriel thinks for a moment before answering, nodding, “Not at first, but kinda yeah.”
CLAIRRRREE!” Jack grabs his sisters shoulder.
"Anywhere! Anywhere but here! Come onnn," Dean says dragging Cas towards the door.
“Tablecloths?”
"Then it wouldn't have been meant to be," the man shrugs.
Dean turns towards him opening his hazy eyes, “Come on I don’t bite.”

Dean sits his beer down, “I’m going to bed and I’m taking something.
Patrons flock in every day to witness nature’s beauty for themselves. Children ran along the sidewalks, reading the plaques and watching the hummingbirds in awe. Couples walked arm and arm along the koi ponds edge. A few artist even sat upon the grassy knoll, the busy gardens a perfect subject.
“NO-“ Gabriel laughs nervously, again waving his arms between the two of him. This is his worst nightmare. Yes, he’s absolutely had this nightmare before. Usually this is the point where Cas burst in and sends him out the window.
"NO. GABRIEL. That is…" he looks at the man across the dance floor, his head thrown back in laughter as the the men and women around him talk, "no. I am not doing it." Cas says sternly and then turns back to the bar asking for another drink.
Jack’s about to protest but something catches his eye, “Whoa,” he reaches into the tattered trunk, retrieving a picture, “Is that-”
"Seriously Cas, if I have to call-"
Dean snaps, "Cas and I
“OOOUFF,” Ellen laughs hugging him over her shoulder. “What are you feeding this kid?” She laughs.
“Casteel? Holy moly you got one crazy name.”
Jack rolls his eyes half heartedly, “Dad says I’m not supposed to use my powers unless it’s absolutely necessary.” He’s about to give up when his fingers catch the edge of the box. Jack reaches further, just able to pull the box down when-
The duo shares a look before Claire sighs, revealing the book from her jacket.
“Holy moly you’re smart. What grade are you in? I’m in first.” Dean smiles proudly.
Below is Chapter 1, rewrote and ready for your entertainment! Enjoy!💛
Dean jumps fist pumping in the air, “YES!”
“DADDY!” Claire’s voice cuts in from the direction of the barn. Her voice catching him off guard.
Cas sees red. Spinning around without thinking and spitting out, “Don’t you
kind of your mothers wheel house. Love is such a simple potion-”
"COOL? I get you into the hottest club in town and all you say '

"Noooo way am I drinking that! It taste like... like... Crap!" Castiel says pushing it back down.
"Oh... ouch... But a Mustang?! What year, you've always wanted to get to work on one!" Cas lights up.
“Calm down. I stopped once I got to the mention of a Kline. But dude you’ve
. Oh my god.” Jack looks around her living room, shock setting in as he takes in the scene before him. “Is this ALL from the trunk?” He gestures to the scattered mess of items spread across the room. Pictures strewn across the coffee table, a handful of shirts folded upon the chair, vinyl records stacked across the couch, books tossed on the table amoung the photos, the infamous diary lying open amoung them.
“What a unique and exotic name.” She gasp. “How lovely,” taking Cas’ arm in hers as they walk down the path around the inn.
Something changes in Dean, Cas can almost feel him thinking. "I’m so sorry Cas," Dean says looking up at him through his long lashes.
"Dean you really should lie down and take something," Cas says starting to clean up the mess of bottle and boxes.
Claire finds herself upside down on the couch, bare feet against the wall, clutching a Led Zeppelin vinyl against her chest, cool empty glass against her cheek. While Jack’s on the floor, plaid flannel he’d found folded in the shirts tied around his shoulders as he reads, propped up against the couch.
Dean tries to brush it off, "Some guy at the shop, he was giving Bobby trouble and-"
"Besides you're the one works on the cars right? Did this hack job on my baby? You probably didn't even go to college. Still live in mom's basement? Or better yet maybe you live here? Hell, I don't know. I don't care," Crowley smirks, hands in his pockets.
“Mhmm,
"Yeeeeep."
Thank you everyone who’s joined us so far! Your comments, kudos, and bookmarks make my day!❤️ We meet one of our side pairings in this chapter but I don’t wanna spoil it 😉 AND the mystery theme is revealed!
“This feels like a movie!” Jack high fives Claire over Gabriel.
Cas looks quickly between Mary and Dean. “Oh. Um. I- I guess so.”
Castiel thinks, because this guy is a 10 on Castiel's scale. Which is pretty much unheard of! He's honestly never given much thought to

to his daughter’s retreating form. She’d smiled brightly, practically tripping as she threw him a wink and disappeared into the inn.
Cas bites his tongue, focusing on the bee.
“CAS!

I just wanted to update anyone following along and let you know I’ll be slowly rewriting this over the next week or so. I’m almost done rewriting Ch. 1 (currently editing). Hopefully after it’s rewritten it will flow much better! Below is the new summary. Thank you again for reading!💛
“THATS THE SPIRIT!” Claire jumps up, slapping his back. “Now, before I get to far-“
"That's an order Dean! Get outta here, alright? There's no telling what this whack job is gonna say or do when he wakes up."
"This is much better than you creeping on me in the corner," Dean says getting comfortable and resting his head under Cas’ neck.
Deans pops his neck. Bobby tries to stop him, "Dean-"
“No, Cas-tee-el.” Cas tries.
, breathing calming, trying to block out the distracting hum of the garden. The birds chirping, customers talking, a crying baby in the distance, the sound of footsteps, a passing breeze. Unconsciously reaching towards each passing sound, silencing them as they pass by, searching for
"Whoa, whoa. What do mean
not to mention monotonous without me.” Gabriel shoulders him.
. HOW?” Dean accidentally squeezes his sandwich too hard, jelly dripping onto his shirt.
Jack Novak loves his older sister, Claire, dearly. Their father and uncle always say they’ve been inseparable since the day he was brought home. Two year old Claire clutching to his tiny hand the moment they met, their fates were immediately sealed. Growing up side by side, making mud pies (together), building pillow forts (together), learning how to toilet paper the neighbors trees using Jack’s developing powers without so much as leaving their porch (together), and becoming the star pupils of their specialities (together). Although they definitely got into their share of trouble, Jack and Claire were best together.
“Okay,” Cas said, shoving more fries in his mouth.
“Oh,” Cas said, unable to think of anything else.
“Yeah,” Dean said, a sleepy grin on his face. A smile pulled at the corners of Castiel’s mouth as he leaned forward, catching Dean’s lips in a gentle kiss. “We should do this again sometime. Fewer clothes next time though,” he said, pulling away with a wink.
The arm on his shoulder disappeared. His empty arms fell to his chest as the portal closed, taking Cas with it.
Cas looked up and made eye contact with him, his smile immediately fell away when they made eye contact. Though, he didn’t look away.
“What?” Dean asked, stopping mid-pancake-flip.
“Castiel,” Dean repeated, contemplating the name, “That’s different.”
Cas smiled at him before looking back down to the coffee in his hand. Dean couldn’t take his eyes off Cas, trying to memorize every detail he could.
Cas turned away from the bed, tears falling silently down his face as he started towards the door. He stopped abruptly. Dean’s hand was holding his. He turned back around, finding himself meeting a pair of beautiful green eyes. Shock and joy overwhelmed him and he cried harder.
He had another text from Dean: What’cha doing?
“I guess practice was good,” he laughed, pulling away.
Against all of his instinct, Castiel left the room and sat in the library as he waited for Dean to come out. He didn’t know how much time had passed when he looked up to see Dean limping into the room. His skin was pale and sweaty, his knuckles were pressing into his side. “Dean,” Castiel called, standing up from where he sat. He pulled Dean into a hug, wishing he could fix whatever was wrong with him.
Cas sighed, relieved. He mustered the only response he could: See you then.
Somehow that thought made Castiel’s face impossibly redder. He glanced over to where Dean was sitting with some of the school jocks. He was laughing at a joke one of them made. Dean made eye contact, making Cas look away quickly. Heat radiated from his cheeks as he felt the green eyes staring at him. Instead of looking back he turned to Gabe and leaned his head on the table.
“Castiel.” Cas managed to say without stuttering which sent a sense of pride running through him. Eli scribbled it on the cups.
Balthazar was already awake and out of the room. Cas guessed at the time, not wanting to risk the pain of finding and checking his phone. The best guess is that it was around 2 in the afternoon.
Cas parked in the closest spot to the door.
Cas gulped down the fries, “Uh, I guess I could until my Dad is done.”
“What?” he asked, hoping he didn’t sound as embarrassed as he felt.
He thought-
“Yeah, why?” Cas asked, taking a bite out of the fry.
“Cas?” a voice said behind him, “Is that you?” Cas looked up from where he was fiddling on his phone. It was Eli.
“He definitely is,” Cas teased, earning a kick from Dean.
“I’ll have a bacon cheese burger, extra onions, extra cheese and bacon, with fries on the side and a coffee, black” Dean said(of course). She jotted it down and turned her head to Sam.
hot,” he murmured into Cas’s lips.
His dad nodded uncomfortably. He started to walk towards the living room but stopped in the doorway. He turned around and pointed at the entry table where the keys sat, “You should visit him. I have a good feeling about today,” he smiled at Cas before walking into the living room.
“Yeah, I guess he thought you’d be awake sooner.” Sam smiled, “get changed and meet us in the kitchen, you reek.”
Sorry for the delay! I know this chapter was super late!
Dean hesitated, making Castiel’s gut churn. “Of course, he’s my best friend.”
“Oh?” Cas shifted nervously in his chair.
“Yes,” Cas responded before turning back to Eli and apologizing.
“Yeah, well, I’m not really in a talking mood,” Dean muttered. He fixed the blanket pulling them over him, hoping Sam would get the hint.
Dean lost count eventually. The world seemed to spin around him. Charlie was reaching for another doorknob and opened it to find another couple kissing in it. The two pulled apart quickly, allowing Dean a view of each of their shocked faces.
“It’s okay,” he responded with a sad smile. Cas nodded at him and Charlie before shoving past her and in the direction Dean went.
A wide smile broke across Dean’s face, “I thought you’d never ask.”
Cas chuckled and kissed him again before shouting for a doctor.
Castiel watched him walk away, bashing himself mentally for not being able to make decent conversation. He scuffed his shoe against the concrete as he debated leaving. Just as he turned to go, Dean yelled that dinner was ready, summoning them to a picnic table near the grill. Cas wandered over hesitantly.
“Wait, don’t I have to talk to the police more?” Cas asked.
Neither looked away until Charlie asked, “You two know each other?”. It was then that Dean realized that he’d never told her the name of the guy he liked. His expression faltered, but just for a second so he doubted Cas noticed.
Dean made eye contact with Cas as he approached the table, sitting across from him. He put his head on the table, giving into his body’s plea for relaxation. He almost fell asleep like that but couldn’t for some reason. He lifted his head enough to see Cas staring at him with a slightly confused and concerned look on his face.
“If you wouldn’t mind, Cas, I’d like a word with him in private,” she said, looking up at him. His eyes flicked between her and Dean a few times before he lifted his hand off of his shoulder and headed towards the door.
“Jesus, Cas.” he said, with a slight tone of annoyance.
It was the smell of bacon and coffee that finally lured him out of bed. He stood in the doorway, a small smile pulling on his face as he watched Dean flitting around the kitchen.
“Not the kind I want. It’s just down the road. I have money.” he pleaded, pulling out his best puppy dog eyes.
“Hiya, Cas” he heard himself say, just loud enough so that Cas could hear it over the blaring music.
“No, ‘cause he ran away. Didn’t even f-f-f-fuckin’ kiss him man,” he garbled.
She was blonde, tall, skinny and beautiful, couldn’t have been more than 25. Just Dean’s type. Dean was obviously checking her out and was about to make a move before he saw the scowl on Sam’s face. His smile faded into an uncomfortable smirk.
Cas hesitated, inspecting his beer as he said “I’m not very good at this sort of stuff. Normally, I would make up some kind of excuse as to why I couldn’t go.”
He woke up, breathing heavily. Sweat gathered on his face and chest. His heartbeat was hard in his chest like he’d just been running.
Dean felt a hint of heat on his face as he sought an answer. His hand moved to rub the skin on his now clammy neck. “Just tired, I guess,” he tried. Benny contemplated the answer for a second before accepting it and moving back to the subject on hand. The party.
Cas’s cheeks heated up. His face felt slightly wet and he was sure his bed head was terrible. Adrenaline from embarrassment shot through him. It gave him the energy to run out the door to the closest bathroom. Hands resting against the sink. Breath coming out in shallow bursts. Darkness rimmed his vision. He stared into the mirror at his reflection. It was messy.
Dean choked down the laugh forming in his throat, “So, what do you do for work?” he asked, changing the subject.
I have never been to a party before so all of it is based off what I've read and watched. It may be completely inaccurate. Don't cite me on any of it.
“Shit,” Dean muttered, making Castiel glance up. His hand was clutching a spot on his side.
“Okay. Thanks again for the coffee,” Dean said, winking before walking out. Cas barely managed to stammer out a ‘bye’ before he heard the door shut.
“Let’s get this party started,” he said with a clap of his hands.
“Because they think you’re hot,” Charlie said.
He walked back to his room and threw on a shirt. It was cold out despite the fact that they were in the middle of a heatwave. Dean regretted not wearing a jacket. He sped up his pace.
“Okay,” Dean said, flipping the pancake again.
By the time the group got to Adam’s house, they were all out of breath, except Balthazar. All the space in Adam’s grand driveway was filled but luckily they managed to pull into a spot at the end of the just before a black Impala pulled into it. The driver honked angrily before moving down to the next available spot halfway down the block. The four just laughed and got out of the car, making their way to the door of Adam’s house.
More silence: Yes, it is.
“Boyfriend,” Cas said again, contemplating the word, “I like it.”
“What was what, dearie?” Rowena smiled innocently, turning to Castiel and asking, “Do you have my crystal?”
Cas: It’s Cas, from the coffee shop
“What the-” Dean started.
The next day Dean stumbled, tiredly, into his pre-calc class. Usually, he didn’t arrive so early but his Dad had an early meeting and a busted tire, so he and his little brother, Sammy, were dropped off at school early. He yawned and rubbed his eyes. Finally noticing how empty the room was. The only people there were Castiel and Mr. Shurley. Cas was at his desk using his hands as a pillow. While Mr. Shurley graded some papers.
“Uh, yeah,” Benny responded, staring at him dumbly, “Dude, what's wrong with you today? You’re so out of it.”
He kept his eyes down. Dean had a single-story home making his room visible from the kitchen window as well. Cas rinsed the pot out and filled it halfway with water, dumping it in the machine.
Anna waved at them when they approached and motioned to the backseat. Cas let Balthazar in first before climbing in beside him. Gabe turned on the radio and off they went. Cas tugged his seat belt around his waist and shifted positions. Maybe skinny jeans weren’t the best idea.
“No,” Dean repeated, wrapping his arms around Cas’s neck. “No,” he begged, “Cas, no. Please. I love you. Don’t leave me.”
The next morning Cas woke up with a plan. He took a quick shower and got dressed. He decided to go for a dark grey, kind of tight, T-shirt and jeans for today. He threw on his favorite pair of Converse and went to grab his backpack.
Cas looked at clearly drunk Dean and followed the green eyes as they landed first on Eli, then shifting slowly over to Cas. Their eyes locked briefly, and Cas saw pain slowly overwhelm them. Then Dean turned and quickly stumbled out of the room. Charlie looked at Cas in shock for another second before turning and yelling Dean’s name in an attempt to draw him back to the group.
“Uh-huh,” Cas said, a bit dazed. His face was bright red, Deans cheeks burned a similar shade
The crowds visiting Dean died down as the weeks passed. By the fourth week, his only regular visitors were Cas, his brother, Mr. Winchester, and a few girls who had a crush on him, though their visits were rare.
That's all, enjoy!
Those green eyes.
“It’s fine, we get that a lot. We’re just friends, she’s a lesbian and I’m very gay,” Cas laughed.
“Let’s just get this over with.” Dean grunted, he started the car, turned on his tunes,drove off. The clock read 7:30.
“What the hell, Cas?” Charlie said, stopping him before he could go after the drunken boy.
Dean sighed, “I won’t press, I’m here if you need me though.”
Just then he got a text. It was from Charlie.
“Your mom will be here to pick you up in about half an hour.” He said unmoving.
“Cas is back with the arrow.”
At some point during the dinner, Dean had pressed his thigh against Castiel’s. He chalked it up to the tight proximity but didn’t move to pull it away.
“Like I said, funny. Ouch!” Gabe yelped when Anna smacked him.
“Dunno man, when is it?” Dean responded.
Cas leaned his head towards his desk. Using his arms as a pillow as he stared out at the dimly lit sky. His eyes shut as he gave in to his exhaustion. It wasn’t exactly sleeping but it was something. Cas could still feel the coolness of his desk and the annoying hair brushing gently against his face. He was too tired to move. His mind drifted. Uncertain whether to stress about school or dream. It chose the latter. He dreamed of a beautiful man with green eyes.
“That’s not unusual, plenty of people stare at me,” he answered.
Anyway, hope you enjoyed the new chapter. Make sure to drop a kudos and bookmark for more updates to come! Only a few more chapters left!
“How tall did you think he’d be,” Dean asked, flipping one of the burgers. Charlie raised her hand an inch or two above his head, bringing it back so that he could see. Dean chuckled, bending down to check the grill heat.
He found her, sitting in an office close to the back of the house, talking to a girl with brown hair which was pulled back into a loose bun. She had on a brown leather jacket which was pulled over a white button-down shirt which in turn was tucked neatly into a pair of khakis. She looked like an adventurer. The pair looked over when he entered.
“That was just me repaying you for the Gatorade, besides it was cold.”
“This is Cas, he’s uh, my boyfriend,” he answered, his confidence wavering. Cas looked at him, face tinted pink but lips pulled into a big smile.
Cas leaned his head back against the wall and let himself breathe. The cool air felt nice against his hot face. His arms were wrapped around his legs. His phone sat unlocked next to him on the bathroom floor. Dean was still texting him. Cas screwed his eyes shut, ignoring the messages as long as he could. His head felt fuzzy and heavy. His face was still wet with snot and tears.
“No, I pretended I was your dad. Since you weren’t entirely drunk, all you get is some community service for possession of alcohol or something. They wanted to take you in for the night but I managed to convince them otherwise,” Balthazar answered, ushering Cas to get up and come with.
“Nothing,” Cas said.
“I, Uhm, yes,” he stuttered, shifting a little but not moving. That earned another chuckle from Dean.
“Of course I am,” Dean answered, his voice thick. He cleared his throat before continuing, “I always am. You know that. What do you want to eat?”
Dean finally gets a chance to kiss Cas. However, when he tries to take it, Cas pulls away, leaving Dean embarrassed and ready for another drink. Dean later finds Cas kissing Eli and, feeling hurt and betrayed, tries to escape in his car. This doesn't go well and Dean gets in an accident.
Lunch was over too quickly but he only had one more class for the day.
The next day, Cas woke up around 2 PM with an overwhelming headache. Initially, he thought he’d missed his alarms, come to find out later that everyone had just decided to let him sleep in. He immediately went to the bathroom to empty his bladder and check on the now very obvious, very dark bruise on his forehead. He touched it gingerly, hissing at the sharp pain that followed. Groaning, he went downstairs to find his father sitting at the kitchen table. He must’ve taken off work.
Dean looked over at her, exasperated, “He doesn’t ‘clearly like me’. He avoids me. He runs inside almost every time I try to talk to him.”
“It’s okay, take your time,” Dean said quietly. Cas closed his eyes, turning his face towards the ceiling again. The bed shifted as Dean got up, shifting again when he came back a few minutes later. “Hey, I brought you some things,” he said, prodding Cas.
Cas sat on the floor, processing what had just happened as nurses and doctors swarmed him, making sure he was okay. He subconsciously mumbled answers to their questions. Some nurses helped him up and sat him back in the chair in Dean’s room with a cup of water, some Tylenol, and an ice pack as they called his Dad.
Cas chuckled to himself beside Dean, though his gaze never left the sky. Dean looked down at him for a little while longer before turning his eyes to the sky. It was nice. Sitting there with Cas, looking up at the faintly star dotted sky, music quietly playing in the distance, crisp night air making the noses and cheeks cold. Dean felt the tension leave his shoulders and he took a deep breath, his eyes closed gently.
Dean sucked in a breath, “I love you too,” he smiled.
Dean sat in the empty seat in front of the boy hoping to strike up a conversation. Before he got the chance some other kids by him started to introduce themselves. Dean introduced himself to them.
“Where we met,” he finished, his voice practically a whisper, “or, rather, where you remember meeting me.”
“That might be best.” Cas agreed.
“No, the ghost standing behind you,” Dean joked, earning a small chuckle from Cas.
Cas was rushed out of the room soon after he called the nurse. Nurses fussed over Dean, taking his vitals and forcing him to drink water. The cool liquid felt nice against his dry throat but he didn’t like taking orders. By the time the Doctors and nurses had finished interrogating him, the sun had set outside and Cas had gone home. There was no sign of John or Sammy coming to visit him
The man at the counter cleared his throat. Ellen sighed, “I’d better get back to work. You boys enjoy.”
Lisa was still soundly asleep when he left the room and walked to the kitchen. He needed coffee.
Cas gave her an awkward wave in response.
Dean watched Cas walk away, confused. Did he do something wrong? He sighed, following Charlie and the others up. He could ask him about it later. For now, he had to get to class.
“We’ve been busy,” Dean lied.
Cas sighed, putting the first show that came to mind: Orange Is the New Black, why?
“Brahma,” Sam corrected, shooting Dean a sour look, “it should be able to stop Aella.”
“I can’t keep pretending, holding it back. Now I have to tell you because of this stupid fucking curse,” Dean continued to ramble, “There’s things, people that I-I want to experience differently than I have before, or maybe even for the first time,” he looked up at Cas, eyes making a silent plea.
The elevator door dinged, announcing its arrival. Dean cleared his throat, stepping in and holding the door open for Cas. He grinned, stepping in beside Dean. As soon as the doors closed, Cas lunged at Dean, catching him off guard. Hiding a smile against Dean’s lips as he let out a surprised squeak.
He stood, pulling Dean up with him. “We need Rowena,” he said. They made their way to the dungeon slowly, Castiel practically carrying Dean.
“Oh?” Rowena asked, her smile growing from innocent to eerily knowing.
“Yeah, I did.” Cas glanced over at him. They were silent again. Cas took another swig from his cup, finishing it off. “I’m all out,” he stated, awkwardly trying to get up from where he was lying down. Halfway up, he stumbled and fell on top of Dean, knocking the other onto the ground. Dean groaned under him at the sudden weight. Cas pushed himself up onto his hands and found himself staring right into those green eyes. Dean’s head was caged in between his arms. The air between them grew warmer with each breath. The smell of alcohol wafted on their breaths.
“You two know each other?” Charlie asked, looking back and forth between the two as they maintained eye contact. (aka dean and cas’s signature eye fucking)
“What?” Cas asked.
“I don’t know-” Cas started hesitantly.
Dean’s day went by quite a bit slower than anticipated. Surprisingly, none of his friends had texted about the party and everyone was being oddly quiet online. So far Dean had spent the day sitting in the crappy motel bed, watching television. Sammy was sitting in the corner, working on some homework. Dean glanced over every once and a while to make sure he didn’t need help. One time when Dean glanced over at his brother, his tongue was stuck out in concentration as the pencil in his hand flitted over the pages of his homework. Dean chuckled, he may not be the smartest or best at school but he would always be there for Sammy. He’d always protect him.
“Sir, yes, sir,” Charlie answered, mock-saluting him. Dean rolled his eyes but headed towards Cas and Sam anyways.
He pulled back to steady himself, eyelids shut in fear that when he opened them it would be a dream. Dean breathed heavily in front of him. The smell of alcohol wafted on his breath. Castiel chuckled, “You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting to do that.”
Cas smiled at him, the tears on his face replaced by the goo. “Goodbye, Dean,” he said, grabbing Dean’s arm.
By the time they were done in the shower, Cas was ready to pass out. Dean helped him slip into the soft, gray sweatpants before leading him back over to the bed. His tired eyes followed Dean as he went out the door, coming back with two glasses of water.
“Uh, yeah, I just,” he turned, expecting to find Meg but instead found a space where she had once stood, “Oh.”
“Why didn’t you stop by? I would’ve loved to see you and little Sam,” Ellen frowned.
“Not at all,” Dean grinned, reaching for the fake silk. He undid the knots with careful fingers and gentle touches. His lips found Cas’s neck again, making his breath hitch. With one final tug, the knots were untied and Dean let out a laugh as the dress fell to the ground. “You wore briefs under that?”
“Cas.” slightly louder.
“About what?”  Dean asked.
Cas felt a pang of guilt. It was his fault Dean was even in this situation. What right did he have to be annoyed at him right now?
“It worked,” Dean gasped, hands fumbling over his torso, searching for an invisible scar. Castiel chuckled and pulled him into another kiss.
Hello hello!
“Dean, it was the only way. If Billie got to you, she would have killed both of you,” Sam reasoned.
Did he read the situation wrong?
The Security Guards eventually got the crowd to settle down and they started letting people go in the building. In small groups so as to not disturb the peace. The waiting room was already filled with patients and other visitors, so Cas and the other high schoolers had to wait outside.
“Hello, Dean,” a voice said softly behind him. He spun knife in hand.
Dean thought for a minute, finishing his pancake flip. “Yeah, yeah I’d love to,” he finally said, turning his head and planting a kiss on Cas’s cheek.
He instantly felt more awake when he saw the top one. He quickly stood, nearly falling, and ran down the hall to the bathroom. He sighed after closing the bathroom door and leaned against the counter.
“Wait… are you saying what I think you’re saying?”
All I knew was that I wanted Charlie's gun to be funnily small and the
And that means you. So you can – you can take that shit about being stuck in a useless meat sack and shove it. It doesn’t hold water with me and it ain’t gonna hold water with anybody else in this bunker. You understand me?”
"Alright, see ya soon."
“What the fuck’d you ask him?”
“I’m serious. You’re letting me stay here. You’re lending me your bed. The least I can do is
Dean is stunned momentarily. Crowley peaks his head in from the kitchen and, upon witnessing the scene, slowly retracts it again. Cas shakes and lowers himself to squat on the ground. He puts his hands on the back of his head, rips at his scalp with white knuckles, and releases one last shout of frustration. This sets Dean in motion again. He rushes to the side of his friend and kneels. Dean reaches out his hand and gently places it against Cas’s back. The fallen angel lifts his head and turns. There are tears in his eyes, magnifying and exaggerating their azure tint. He takes a shuddering breath.
Sam’s getting better.
“Well I’m no use staying here!”
“That’s not a line! That’s my life!”
“Listen. You don’t even know. It doesn’t matter what you’re into. If you’re born with a vagina in this country, somebody at some point is buying you a frakkin’ Barbie doll. It’s easier to just embrace the uber-femme tradition. If we’re being fair though, I did get pretty creative with my Barbies. I’d always have them dare one another to make out.” Charlie stares into the distance as she reminisces. “That probably should have been everybody’s first clue.”
He wasn’t alone though. A man stood at the far end of clearing in outdated attire. He held in his hands a large spool wound with string. The string stretched upward, seemingly defying gravity, and Dean saw it tugging at the edge of a multi-colored kite. The kite bobbed and fluttered in the strong wind. It never fell or faltered. It just kept flying.
As if fueled by spite, Dean overpowers Cas and flips them. Now Cas is the one pinned, his weapon rendered useless by the fierce grip Dean has on his wrists. They breathe for a moment – an impasse – Dean straddling Cas’s torso and Cas unable to wound him. Sweat beads off of Dean’s chest, rolls over his tattoo, and drips into the hollow of Cas’s collar bone. Their eyes meet. Pupils dilate.
He lies in bed the first week. He doesn’t take care of himself. Dean eventually forces him to take a shower and eat and do all the little human things it’s now necessary for him to do. The second week is better. Castiel gets up every morning, at least. He burns the coffee while Dean cooks breakfast and Crowley hovers in the kitchen – hoping to be of assistance. Cas doesn’t talk much, but then none of them have ever talked much. Dean accepts any sort of progress blindly. He’s never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
“If I was the neutered ex-King of Hell,” he mutters. “Where would I go..?”
Castiel lifted his head and there was sadness in his features. He stared at Dean, his gaze intense. Dean met this prolonged glance with a clenched jaw.
“Did you borrow some aspirin or something?” Dean asks, leaning against the edge of the armchair.
out. But he didn’t.  If Cas notices the specificity of the statement he doesn’t show it. Dean figures if there was ever a time to make things personal, it would be now, so he continues on his slightly altered path.
They make good time. It only
And that's my official stance on the matter.
“I don’t understand.” Cas turns to look at Charlie for some sort of explanation. She laughs at his mildly frightened expression.
“Ah! Is it my night already? I best get on with it then.” Crowley smiles amicably and saunters off to the kitchen, throwing Sam a pointed glance as he goes. His agreeability only pisses Dean off further.  Sam’s guilty expression isn’t helping either. The remnants of the conversation Dean’s just overheard chafe at the insides of his skull. And since when are Sam and Crowley best pals, anyway? Sharing secrets over homework assignments like prepubescent girls. He’s about to round on Sam and demand an answer when Kevin pulls his headphones out of his ears and stands.
Dean thinks.
“Yes, yes, yes! Thank you, Dean!”
Just like darts.
… Kind of.”
Dean taps out of the GPS app on his phone to avoid being pestered by anymore haughty voice commands. Sometimes he misses the days of paper maps. At least they were mute.
And that’s when Dean sees the wings. Pairs upon pairs of stone wings. They extend in different ways – rear up to take flight or curl into the backs of their hosts. They’re made heavy from granite and marble. The angels stare at one another -- smiling benevolently, gathered around the garden path like old relatives at a family dinner. A couple of them are cracked and leaning against one another. It’s a strange little shop, Dean thinks. The Impala roars past the garish display. Before it’s out of his sightline he notices a large black hatchback hiding in the shaded drive. It’s a hearse, freshly washed, and all dressed up for a funeral. Cas probably saw The Den on his way into town that first day after The Fall, trudging through the brush, making his way to his own den. His own brittle friends. Dean has an urge to turn around, burn the whole house to the ground and salt the ashes. But he keeps driving.
Dean remembers what a future with a human Castiel looked like before. How could he forget? Drugged up beyond recognition, over-sexed, manipulative, and ambivalent about everything – including his life. Dean betrayed Cas in that timeline. He let his friend go to waste and rot before his very eyes and then he sacrificed him without a second thought. Cas was just another pig up for slaughter. But Dean’s not that man. He keeps telling himself that Cas and he are different than they were back then. They aren’t going down that road. It will never come to that. Dean decides right then that he won’t
“GOOD MORNING THERE KEV!”
“Then start acting like it.”
know and neither do you and I’m not gonna go sticking my head where it doesn’t belong.”
He prayed.
As a result, the sass in the bunker is palpable.
He decides in one moment to step forward, to round the edge of the door frame, and peer into the shelled-out home. The walls on the inside look just like the ones on the outside. Leaves that have blown in over time, huddle, clumped in corners and reeking of mildew. Though the floor creaks ominously with each step Dean takes, he walks forward. He scatters the piles of leaves with a boot heel and checks the walls for angel warding or spell work. There's no evidence of squatters -- demon, angel, or otherwise. In fact, there appears to be nothing supernatural about the house at all and by the time Dean finishes his inspection, he feels certain it must have been a technological error after all.  He'll have to rag on Charlie for this one.
Dean opens his mouth to retort, but is cut off by Cas emerging from the changing room. He steps out in a red cardigan and a pair of what must be uncomfortably
“Guuuuuuuuuuuuuh.” Kevin moves his hands to cover his ears.
"Yeah. I got it."
The Chapter:
” Kevin laughs.
“You can’t do shit like this, Cas! You’re gonna make yourself sick!” Dean throws the blanket off his lower half, pointedly not caring that he’s only in a t-shirt and boxers. He gets off the couch and stalks out of the room, leaving his friend behind in a confused stupor. When he returns, he’s clutching a packet of some kind and a glass of water.  He sets the glass down heavily on the coffee table and fumbles with the silver and plastic pouch. As he sits at Cas’s side, Dean pops two pills from the packet and holds them out in his hand without comment.
“No, it couldn’t have been Kevin. He was out cold, remember?”
"Bye."
jeans – the legs seem almost saran-wrapped to his calves. He sloppily adjusts a skinny tie around the collar of a white button-up.
“Oh God,” he says.  “Don’t get me started. I about committed murder-suicide right there in the store.”
There's a pause on the other end. "Bad news?" Sam asks.
“You know exactly what I think is going to happen. I think it’s been happening for quite some time.”
“Can’t let it get too crazy. Cas’ll break out the Twister board. Haha! Ha.” The silence continues and everyone stares at Dean. “Ahem – Ah – Isn’t that right Cas?”
“My thoughts exactly,” Dean replies.
“I just think maybe Kevin has a point. He’s not a kid, you know. And you can’t deny that Cas has been… difficult.” Sam frowns.
“I’m not sure how to explain it,” says Cas, finally. “Before now his questions would have upset me, maybe made me uncomfortable given their implications, but the rage – that was something new. Not like any rage I’ve felt before. It was as if a dam inside of me had reached capacity and burst. Everything behind it came out, not just what was relevant. It’s a very particular way of feeling.” With an air of chagrin, Cas sits down on the edge of his bed. “I don’t know if I’m making any sense.”
Thanks so much for waiting. You are all lovely readers.
“What do you mean you can’t find my texts? Look!” She pulls out her own phone and taps the screen a few times. “Right there! Dozens! I’ve been trying you for weeks. I’ve been calling too, but I could never get through.”
Rather, it was a bright and true-green pasture Dean saw. There were shrubs and flowers lining the wide clearing he was standing in. Thick trees blocked his view of anything beyond the immediate. The sky above him was crystal clear— the blue of early day-trips in the impala with his father and toddler brother. The wind blew sharply, but not unpleasantly. It was a beautiful day. The park was unfamiliar and this concerned Dean.
“Not so easy now, huh?” The question comes out a little huskier than Dean thought it would.
“In what universe?”
Dean nods again and leaves the room. There must be Tylenol in the hall bathroom. The pain is unholy -- like some asshole wraith is gnawing on his grey matter. And while Dean finds the right bottle of pills in the medicine cabinet, he tries to get the image of liquefied brains out of his head. He downs three Tylenol and a couple of Aspirin before closing his eyes and leaning hard against the sink. He dry swallows and the tablets stick as they slide down his throat. He feels more than tempted to take a serrated melon baller to his head – try and scoop out the parts radiating agony. He trudges down the stairs and into the kitchen and downs a can of soda. The caffeine should help eventually.
“You know I’m doing this for him! So he can get his stupid angel mojo back and the least he could do is not rip me a new one when I ask a simple fucking question!”
Dean takes a final swig of water and walks onto the mat at the center of the training room, admiring again the charm of the place. A not-so-secret part of him wants to put on “Eye of The Tiger” at full blast and reenact the montage from
“Thank you!”
Charlie stops trying to measure Cas’s waist with her hands. They can all hear the poorly concealed anguish in his gravelly tones. Dean forgets sometimes that the angels are actually Cas’s family. It’s not really fair of him to forget, but he does. As much as Cas is mourning the loss of his grace, he’s also mourning the loss of something far greater. It’s hard to understand the scale of such a loss. Dean imagines Cas in his old suit – a black tie done the wrong way around instead of a blue one – leaning over some sort of immense grave. Flowers in hand, he places them on the mass of winged bodies. It’s a funeral every day for Cas in some respects. Dean’s had those days. He remembers them well.
to kick your ass, but if you insist.”
“Nothing, Cas.”
“Crowley – former king of Hell, ex-crossroads demon, and resident wine expert.” He extends his hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
And Dean does. Vividly. He still can’t scrub the stench of vomit out his work boots. He stares down at Sam and sees his brother sink slowly into the couch. His face is without expression, his eyes wide and focused on something invisible.
“Listen, this whole ‘humble host’ shtick is giving me the creeps,” she says, making a grab for the bottle. Dean holds it out of her reach.  She frowns and takes a step back. “No, seriously. If I wake up tomorrow morning to find Sam wearing an apron and you making me a muffin basket, I’ll vomit. I will actually, literally puke.” Charlie lunges toward the bottle and Dean tosses it over her head to Sam who catches it instinctively – but not before it almost smacks Kevin in the face. The kid screeches a little and holds his arms up in a delayed reaction. They play “keep away” for a minute or two before Charlie’s had enough. And even though Sam is the one with the bottle, she straightens up and glares at Dean with her hands on her hips.
“How was, uh, shopping?” Sam asks, trying to reign in a sneer.
something’s up.
“Cell phone. You of all people should be familiar with that particular technique.” Dean gives Charlie a look.
“This isn’t real is it? Any of it,” Dean asked, maintaining their embrace.
The kid really can’t catch a break.
Dean’s knife is knocked from his hands and off the mat. It clatters on the concrete floor of the training room. Cas takes immediate advantage of Dean’s vulnerability and propels himself forward. They both slam to the ground. Cas almost wins then, but Dean succeeds in keeping the wooden edge of Cas’s blade away from his neck.
“Not bad!” says Charlie as she hops off the couch.
“I think I’ll go to bed now. Goodnight, Sam. Goodnight, Dean.”
Dean doesn’t say anything. Cas continues speaking.
Kevin responds to this advice by silently loading his plate with the greasy stuff.  By the time Dean joins the table, with a large pan of scrambled eggs, the bacon has been thoroughly picked over. Crowley practically attacks the scramble and Dean frowns.
“Yes, let go. And when I do manage it, I’m inundated with visions of the past – dreams, memories. It’s very disconcerting.” Cas props his elbows on his knees and lowers his face to rest in the cradle of his hands. He massages his forehead with his fingertips. “I’ve never slept like this before – fully human. It’s… it’s harder than I imagined. So, I thought I would see how long my new form can function without rest. The less I’m required to sleep, the better off I’ll be.”
Outside however, they are public enemy #1.
“Son of a bitch! I thought the sneaking up behind me would stop when you lost your—”
The nostalgia he’s been feeling for his life on the run disappears completely. There’s something to be said for putting down roots. Real roots. Not the easily removed roots of weeds and daisies, but the forever roots of oaks and pines.
to get yourself killed? Jesus. What did you find?"
“The song… The ‘Barbie Girl’ song.”
Dean stares at Cas for a moment and then reaches down to grasp the other man firmly beneath both arms. He grips the strong length of ribcage just below Cas’s armpits and heaves his torso to the right. Cas drops onto his side and nearly drags Dean down with him, but the hunter catches himself on the edge of the coffee table. Using a similar method as before, he tugs Cas’s body along until his head is far enough down the couch to allow room for his feet to rest on the other end. Dean lifts Cas’s legs onto the cushions and throws a blanket over top of them. Again, he goes to turn out the light and stops.
And now that it’s Cas who is vulnerable and in need? Dean understands the urge to protect him. Even as he snores on the living room couch.
The dazed smile slides from Cas’s face and he furrows his brow in concentration – as if the information Dean has just relayed is of monumental importance for him to understand.
“No you’re not.” Dean huffs out a little laugh and Cas narrows his eyes. He shuts the book with a snap that echoes in the chamber. He calmly places it on the table in front of him and puts both hands in his lap before he speaks.
He had a headache. His mouth tasted even worse than when he’d fallen asleep. Sam was in the shower and Dean could hear the spray of water against tile through the bathroom door. He wanted to go back. He closed his eyes and tried to conjure up the clearing, but it was no use. The location, once unknown to Dean was becoming that way again. Every move Dean made served to erase a little part of the vision. He tried to shut out reality. Reality was hard.
“What?” Dean’s mind is elsewhere. “Us? Sam and the boys and I? We’re uh, well. We’re alright.”
Dean explains quickly about the third trial, the botched cure, and how they couldn’t be sure it would manifest a permanent change in Crowley’s demeanor. They decided, rather hastily given the circumstances, that keeping the demon with them was the best course of action. Then, after a while, when it seemed that Crowley’s contrition wasn’t completely fleeting, they let out a little slack on the leash.
“Hello, Dean,” says Cas.
“I am eons older than you. I was sentient before your species evolved.”
“Goddammit! Now I’m gonna have that song stuck in my head.”
“Dammit, Cas!”
, Dean. I track your cellphones, remember? And I watched Sam’s little dot get further and further away from your little dot. And Sam wasn’t answering me and your stupid little dot was just fucking
” Cas hisses as if they’ve already had their difficult conversation and are now drawing it to an embittered close.
things to Dean. He tries not to think what he’s thinking. He tries to quiet the buzzing in his head. He’s been keeping this… tendency hidden for this long. Why is it all of a sudden so much harder?
The month passes like this. Crowley ‘borrows’ a car from a nearby used auto dealer. He makes the decent point that the Impala is highly recognizable. Dean is internally relieved about the new vehicle, a ‘96 Mazda Protégé with a not-insignificant amount of paint damage. It means he doesn’t have to let a former demon drive his car anymore. He still doesn’t entirely trust Crowley, despite the housewife routine. Castiel is silent, but functional. Kevin trudges through the word of God, but takes time to catch up on something called
So while Charlie yells and her eyes get misty, Dean does the one thing he knows to do. He walks forward and gives her the biggest hug he can. It’s not something he would do with most people, but then again, Charlie
to stay and work with me on this. And you have to remember that you don’t have a free pass anymore. You’ve used all the ‘Get Out Of Jail Free’ cards you’re gonna get.”
Again I humbly thank the beta of my dreams,
Charlie looks tired, as if she hasn’t slept in a couple of days. She slowly lowers her gun and Dean does the same. He makes a mental note to put it back in its hiding place as soon as possible. The top of the fridge trick is something that became a habit when he was still living with Lisa. It was a discreet place that almost no one thought to check. It also kept Ben from toying around with a gun when Dean wasn’t looking. Charlie stows her piece in her large and button covered shoulder bag. She then flings it at Dean and makes her way downstairs. He catches it, tosses it into one of the balcony chairs, and tucks his gun into the pocket of his robe. They’ll have to fix her up a room if she intends to stay, but her presence will definitely crowd things. When Dean reaches the bottom of the balcony stairs and steps into the control room, Charlie is laying into Sam. It’s actually kind of hilarious how genuinely terrified the giant younger brother appears in the face of little Charlie Bradbury.
He can’t find it. A headache, which has been threatening to overtake Dean since his morning spat with Kevin, pounds against the sides of his head. And he can’t find the damn bag. It should be tucked at the back of his underwear drawer, a drawstring pouch filled with little orange bottles. Excedrin and Xanax and Valium and Vicodin -- for the rough stuff. All mislabeled, none of the prescriptions made out to Dean. He turns the drawer upside down, shaking balled-up pairs of boxers to the floor. Dean scours his room, to no avail. Exasperated, he tracks Sam down in the den.
There’s a shift in the air. That’s why Dean wakes up. The change is subtle, but distinct and it disturbs the hunter from his sleep. Normally, with a shift like that, Dean would be up and out of bed – ready to maim or kill whatever the cause. Maybe it’s because the security of the bunker has made him soft or maybe it’s just that he recognizes the scent of the intruder, but Dean does not wake on the defensive. Instead he yawns, blinks open his stinging eyes, and raises his head slightly to stare at Cas, who leans against the arm of the couch by Dean’s feet. It’s almost pitch black in the den, but Cas’s outline is completely recognizable. His silhouette casts no shadow. He makes no noise.
The Queen of Moondoor had congregated everyone in the center room after dinner, first by challenging Sam to an arm wrestling match (the fight had lasted about 0.2 seconds), and then by answering Kevin’s line of questioning on her career as a professional hacker. The prophet had been awestruck by the revelation that he’d heard about and even witnessed some of her handy work. Apparently, Charlie was some sort of infamous hacktivist operating under the moniker “H@rl3y Qu1nn.” A discussion about her reprogramming of some corporate websites led into talk about her many other hobbies and eventually into a bawdy series of recollections from her favorite comic book conventions. Halfway into a story about how she’d drunkenly stumbled into Elijah Wood once while in full Legolas cosplay, Dean remembered that he’d done nothing about the sleeping arrangements and finished off his beer before heading upstairs.
” Dean growls
“Vulcans are like these – well not emotionless, exactly. But kind of. They’re all about logic. And having feelings for them is kind of seen as this weak thing. So Spock tries to keep his human side under wraps.”
Cas glares from his seat and turns away, but releases some of the tension he’s been holding in his shoulders. His lungs fill with air and he exhales slowly. He leans back into the seat of the Impala, closing his eyes, and the wind seems to overtake him. It whips his hair around and pulls at the edges of his shirt, rippling the cotton over his skin. Dean has to force himself to watch the road.
“Oh yeah?”
. I honestly don't understand how she manages to be right about everything, but it's delightfully annoying. Seriously though, she's always right. ALWAYS.
Sam’s broken the news to him.
“…Why?” he asks slowly and Sam hesitates.
Before Charlie had gone she’d left Dean with a couple of parting gifts: 1. assurance that should they ever need anything, she would prefer they only call her as a last resort; and 2. a new ringtone. One which, Dean quickly discovered, was password protected.  He lifts himself off of Cas’s chest, suddenly a little self-conscious about the whole affair, and goes to pick up his phone. Cas just laughs and raises himself up on his elbows.
“Yeah. Oh.” Dean grabs his shirt off the bench to his right and pulls it over his head. “I wasn’t trying to lie. I just didn’t think you’d care to be honest.”
“He’s not my ang—!” Dean’s cut off by the sound of Kevin slamming the door to the upper hallway. The silence in the wake of their argument is only slightly deafening.  Dean puts a hand to his head and massages his temples. He feels a headache coming on.
Sam regains the ability to bitchface and all seems superficially well.
“And you have music.”
In the present, Dean doesn’t just notice the tattoo or how it’s identical to his own. He notices strange things, like the perspiration on Cas’s skin.  He notices muscle definition. And how snug and low the waistband of Cas’s sweatpants fall. When the former angel turns around it becomes even more difficult for Dean to ignore or deny that how he’s looking at Cas isn’t exactly ambivalent. The guy’s fit. That’s not new. So he’s got great arms… and hip bones that form a v-shaped ridge… So what?  Dean’s seen it all before – and covered in bees, no less. So why does he reach to remove his own damp t-shirt? Why does his skin burn with a heat that isn’t from exertion?
“Maybe,” Dean grunts. He probably has a thousand dollars’ worth of medication stashed in that bag. He didn’t misplace it. He never misplaces it.
He hops down the porch steps and something catches his eye -- gleaming, just for a second from the bushes. Tilting his head to get a better look, it happens again. A bright flash from within the overgrown hedges blinds him momentarily. The closer Dean gets, the more the object reflects the fading light of the sun and he stoops to rummage in the leaves. His fingers paw around in the dirt, scraping at something cold and metallic. Finally he gets a grip on the rounded handle of the thing and pulls it out --
“The – the song... You know the song! The – the –” Dean realizes he’s on the verge of humming a few bars and stops himself. “I’m not gonna sing it! It’s bad enough I even know it!”
“I’M GOING OUT,” he yells to no one. The echoes of his shout only serve to clang around in his skull. He refuses to sit and wallow when he could be fighting. Fighting the headache, the inevitable confrontation with Crowley, the perpetual guilt that accompanies being himself.
you, Cas. I—” Dean’s throat feels like it’s closing up. He chokes back whatever embarrassing insight into his mind he was about to supply.
“And who are you?” Charlie asks with uncontained curiosity.
He's too preoccupied to notice that he's not the only one awake on that particuar Summer morning.
“4:00 AM.”
“Wait, what are you talking about?”
“What are they?” Cas asks with apprehension.
“Not on a daily basis just… sometimes. When business is slow.” Charlie smiles politely at the old woman and watches her untangle the hangers. “Mostly I hack on contract. I point out the flaws in a customer’s system by exploiting them and they shell out for the service.”
Sam looks honestly bewildered. He takes the phone from her hands and scrolls through the conversation feed. Then Charlie rounds on Dean.
“Did you need something?”
Cas returns with more supplies than Dean sent him for.
“Who could use a little what now?” he asks, skipping up the steps into the library – a big, fake smile stuck to his face. Sam jumps at his brother’s entrance and accidently knocks a book off the table. It clatters against the tile and Sam scrambles to retrieve it. Crowley, however, doesn’t miss a beat.
Dean’s head snaps up from staring between his knees at the floor. He looks at Cas strangely, watches him smirk.
“Dean and Sam have informed me that it’s not necessary to wear a long coat indoors,” Cas says, a little forlorn.
. Time to sleep it off.”
First and foremost I owe you readers a very serious apology. This took me far too long to get up and, while I have many excuses, they all basically boil down to the fact that sometimes writing is just freaking hard and life gets in the way. This also may seem like a short chapter, which it is. It was originally intended to be about twice as long, but my Beta suggested I split it up. So, do not fear! I have Chapter Four ready and waiting in the wings. I have to make some final edits and then I'll upload it a week from today. That'll give me some time to really crack down on finishing Chapter Five and hopefully y'all will never have to wait this long for a new installment again.
Thanks for reading! And thanks again to my lovely friends Emily and Balke for their edits and for encouraging me to return to this story. Y'all rock ass.
“She’s not my girlfriend,” Dean said quickly.
“It’s- I-” Cas started to say. He never finished the thought.
Cas was sure his face was as red as a tomato. He spaced out for the rest of the day, thinking of the green eyes and calloused skin that belonged to the new kid.
Gabe dropped them off at the same corner that he’d picked them up. Balthazar held Cas’s upper arm for some extra balance as they walked down the block towards the house. Luckily, Cas didn’t need it until they reached the stairs leading into his house. He barely made it up them without tripping.
“How old was Jimmy?” Dean asks as he wipes sweat from his brow. He’s curious.
“Yeah and it looks like they got you too,” says Charlie.
Because they were still hugging, Dean didn’t have to look at Cas when he said what he said next.
were the ones involved in the sky falling. He just listened to the new intel.
“Dean! Um, can I talk to you about something?” he says, sliding the angel tablet away from him like an empty plate. Kevin’s taken over an entire corner of the library. The walls of this space are covered in notes, most of them illegible, some scrawled on the torn corners of takeout menus, others organized into neat outlines. He normally works in silence, blasting music, and ignoring the rest of them.
” whispers Sam, dropping his arms to his sides.
And even though the music pulses throughout the car with an impressive intensity, Charlie isn’t discouraged. She either misses or ignores Dean’s hint and only endeavors to speak louder over each drum solo and guitar riff.
I thought I could help. I thought I could be a new leader – a new God even. A
bastard, I believe,” Crowley corrects. “But I meant it with the utmost respect.”
Cas gives him a pained look and Dean realizes the significance of his offer.
Totally on time!
“Alright, your highness, you should be all set.”
“I don’t think I
Once Sam was satisfied that Dean would avoid alcohol poisoning for the time being, he guided his brother back over to the closest bed. Dean slurred insults at Sam, but the younger brother refused to take the bait by offering a response. It was late. He was tired in more ways than sixteen and it just wasn’t worth a drunken shouting match. He covered Dean with the starched and rose emblazoned motel duvet and turned off the bedside table lamp before climbing onto his own sunken mattress. He could hear Dean mumbling even still and said a little internal prayer that there would be no repeat puke performance during the night.
When Dean finally looks up from the floor, Cas is smiling. It’s the sincerest smile Dean’s received from him in months – maybe years even.
“What is this?”
“Good Morning,” says Cas, crossing the kitchen to pour himself a cup of coffee.
Like I promised!
“I do care, Dean,” says Cas – a little too forcefully. “I do.”
“Cas.”
“I don’t know!” Kevin calls back without turning around. “He’s your angel! You figure out!”
And miraculously, above all odds, the angel heard.
“Good! How’s…” She goes silent for a moment and then seems to make up her mind about something. “Okay, what the hell’s with Crowley?”
“What is
Cas scoops up the capsules and his fingers linger against the skin of Dean’s palm. Dean chalks it up to poor motor control and sleep deprivation, but something about it is... strange. Intimate? It doesn’t help that Cas stares directly into Dean’s eyes the whole time. It’s as if he says, “Okay, Dean. I trust you. You know best.” Their knees collide as Cas reaches for the water and downs the medication. Then a moment of silence, neither knowing what to do or say. There’s no reason for Dean to be so close to Cas now, but he doesn’t move away. Instead he takes the glass from Cas’s hand and allows their fingers to slide over top of each other. Again, it’s a small gesture, an almost irrelevant point of contact, but it
“Deeeeeeeeeaaaaaan.”
“Well!” Charlie interjects, hopping up from the couch. “I think that just about does it. Cas, you can go put your regular clothes on again and Dean and I can start taking this stuff up to the front.”
Dean wonders.
“Oh come on–”
Dean could feel moisture welling up behind his eyes and he swallowed hard to stop it. It was ridiculous to cry, he thought. Ridiculous. He hadn’t had anyone to confide in for the majority of his life. It made no sense to miss that luxury now. The wind ran through his hair and picked up the edges of his plaid shirt. He thought it might have gotten colder, but he wasn’t sure.
Cas smiles in a sad sort of way. Something unsaid passes between the two of them. Neither acknowledges this wordless exchange. Dean coughs a little in order to break what’s turning into an uncomfortably long staring contest. Cas glances downward. He sees a spread of glistening shrapnel and is reminded of the mess he’s made.
It’s coming from the front door atop the balcony. Someone is
out of the room, but he doesn’t.
Dean reaches to run a hand through his hair and sighs.
Sam looks as if he’s going to say something else, but leaves without another word. It isn’t until he’s up the stairs and out of sight that Dean realizes he still has no clue what Sam and Crowley are hiding from him. If they’re hiding anything from him at all.
There’s a night in the bunker when Dean looks around and something stirs within his chest. He’s sunk in a leather wingback tucked between the brick wall of the library and a book shelf. The chair’s angled to see the room at large and his vantage point reveals a pleasant scene. Earlier, Crowley had served drinks. As a result, the space turns giddy. Dean clutches a tumbler of scotch in both hands and watches from the side lines. Kevin and Sam sit at the long table furthest from the entryway. The number of empty beer bottles beside them grows as they converse between stacks of books about some mythological legend or other. Their deep, intellectual conversation slowly devolves as the booze flows. All the while Crowley circles the table next to them with a glass of wine, running the fingers of his empty hand over ancient tomes and occasionally making a quip that doubles Kevin over with laughter. From the way Sam narrows his eyes ever-so-slightly at the remarks, Dean doesn’t have to guess who they’re about.  There’s a word on the tip of his tongue. It’s not family. It’s not residence or permanence or brotherhood. Its
Dean let himself shut his eyes. Castiel was still swimming there, closer than he’d ever been before and yet forever far away. Dean didn’t know what to do. So, he did what he always did when he was at a loss.
worthless. I don’t know how many times I gotta say it before sticks in that birdbrain of yours… but I – we –
Dean reaches over to his left and scrapes his cellphone off the polished coffee table. The glare of the white little screen blinds him temporarily. “3:46 AM,” it reads. He locks it again and tosses it back onto the table with a loud clunk. He can’t see Cas anymore.
“FUCK YOU BOTH,” shouts Kevin, throwing his hands to the sky as if praying for God to put him out of his misery. It’s at this moment that Dean and Sam decide to take pity on the young prophet. Not to mention Sam has a coughing fit in the wake of his enthusiastic solo that temporarily preoccupies Dean. Crowley pats Kevin on the back as he makes his way to the dish cupboard and begins to set the table. After assuring himself that Sam is fine, Dean passes him the plate of bacon and points where to place it.
“You gotta start trusting me, Cas,” Dean says calmly. “We’ve gotta start trusting each other. Because when it really counts, and it will, we have to be ready.  And that starts now.”
