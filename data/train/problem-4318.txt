Cas slowly turned sitting up on his knees so he could turn and see Dean's expression. It was pained with yearning. He leaned in so he could take comfort from Cas's lip again. Their kiss grew and Dean's hands searched Cas finding all the places that were reserved only for him. He felt himself grow hard again, and wanting everything from his lover. He put Cas back onto all fours as he gently bit at his back. He took small bites leaving delicate marks that quickly faded. Building noises escaped Dean as he was losing himself to the desire. The need to devour was great. His hands found Cas hard and eager. With his other hand he rubbed his sex against Cas. Taking his time he made sure they were both ready. He made small, slow, gentle motions as he put himself deeper in his lover. This was no race, there was no need to be forceful.
Cas was stunned, but quickly returned the anguished probing kiss in kind. He tasted the tears from Dean mingle in their mouth. Those tears were for him, they were for them. The faint taste of whiskey was still clinging to Dean's tongue. Cas felt a deep sound of need escape him without having any control over it. Dean knew this sound, knew this response.
“Yeah I have.”
“Sam, don’t. I know everything you’re about say.” He kept his eyes on the road not taking a moment to see his brother’s reaction.
The thing that was the same for both of them though, was to ask Jack to watch over Dean. While they had asked for Cas back several times, they were more concerned for Dean and the sadness that was taking root.
Dean actually laughed so hard he had to put his tea down so he didn't spill it. "What did you see when you searched for salty teens?"
"I know, I knew you must have. It is me though. I have all of my memories, all of the feelings, and the emotions I had before. When I woke up in the empty my first thought," Cas hesitated not wanting to admit this out loud. "...my first thought wasn't about Jack, it was that I had left you. I was almost too scared to return to earth in case Lucifer had killed you. I didn't even want to come back to a world like that. I nearly decided to stay there, awake forever if only to keep my memories of being with you, of us alive." As Cas was still trying to explain, Dean closed the distance between them. Fuercely grabbing Cas's trench coat he pulled him into a deep searching kiss.
“Welcome home, pal.” The skepticism was still in his eyes. If this was an impersonator the best way to find out would be to welcome them as if it were Cas and see how it interacted with everyone. He embraced this being that smelled like Cas, acted like Cas, but still defied all logic. Dean was good at the long game, and would hold back his approval until he could be with Cas one-on-one. Sam hugged Cas as well feeling like maybe he could let his guard down now that Dean appeared convinced.
Cas sat on the edge of the bed. “Which side should I take?”
“How? I mean...where are you?” Dean knew not to believe it right away, though his heart wanted to so badly.
“Dean, it’s me.” The voice was gruff and unmistakable.
"It's good huh?" Dean was already halfway through his. He didn't have the restraint to wait and chanced burning his tongue.
"I never thought he could or has that kind of love for me. I...he...he's….oh god. He was an angel, I'm just human. It's always been Cas." Choking back more sobs he tried to control his breathing.
Cas took a deep breath of the spiced tea closing his eyes reflecting on how to reply.
Jack's eyes were filling with tears as he began to fully process what he was getting from inside Dean. He felt sorrow, loss, pain, happiness, excitement, fear, loathing, sadness, joy, peace, and love. Love, for them of course, he could feel they were all family even after everything he had done Dean saw him as a son, as his responsibility. But there was more love, complete love. He pushed this feeling deeper inside Dean's mind and Cas's face came to him he saw and felt how the Empty took him. The feeling spread over him and Dean's mind quieted as well. Slowly Jack pulled his fingers away and waited. He just knew Dean was still there and still had things to fight for, he was gonna wake up.
“Turns out the missing ingredient to ensure the soul stays here was a
Dean smiles, nostalgic.
“It’s not that” Dean words came in fast, raising his voice as he goes, holding his anger.
Dean looked at him seriously and went straight to him through the table. Dean puts his hand on Sam’s shoulder, and softly smiles.
The touch made Jack relax, he feels better now so he smiles and slowly nods.
They’re truthfully happy, finally at peace.
“Bite me!” Dean voice echoed from down the hall.
She walks onto his side, smiling at him like old friends. Eyes glowing orange and the same light as before covers her till they see Jack is now in control.
The time froze, they didn’t move and no sound was in the room.
The gag catches up for a bit. Talking through the time they spent apart, joking and telling stories they’ve lived for the past months. Nothing but laughs are heard in the room.
“Hello Dean”
Far from where he was standing, he could see two figures. He recognized the first one. It was... himself?
“First, that’s for not locking the door last night.” Sam stares at the food in the kitchen and continue. “Second, what’s with all this food?”.
the front seat” Cas yelled from the other side of the car.
Dean pass-walked his brother side, almost crashing into Eileen who’ve just arrived.
Castiel, still lying on the ground, looked up to see a version of himself and Jack standing in front of him.
“Dean, listen, it’s okay.
Sam, although looking conflicted about Jack words, nods agreeing.
“So, what about you guys, how’s the Rocky’s doing.”
Eileen smiles as she hugs him, taking him by surprise. Dean sets apart a few inches in order to see her face, he moves his lips soundlessly for her only.
“Dean, are you okay?”
Dean’s walking around the room, passing by the few things Castiel left. Not much, only a couple of trench coats spliced on a chair, a few frames and some notes. As he walks by the desk, he glimpses a picture of Cas wearing the cowboy hat he gave him a while ago.
“There’s still a lot to fix of Chuck’s work that is beyond bringing everybody back.”
“How? Sam sounds genially surprised.
“Just for a few days” Dean continued.
Jack, still smiling, turns to see all. “I know I’m not actually family of...”
Sam smiles at the mention, realizing that, it kind of is.
“You are your own Cas” Dean’s confident on his own voice. “you heard Chuck, every other version of you blindly followed his plans. But not you. You changed the fate of this world, just by being you and ever since we met, ever since you pulled me out of hell
“I’m sorry.”
Rowena slowly approached Dean's side, and gently, she puts her hand over his chest. A soft touch.
He tries to speak but Dean interrupts, sharp.
“What changes?” Dean frowned.
“Easy” Dean stood next to his brother.
“You can’t! We made a deal!” The shadow, screaming, tossed Castiel into the deep underground again.
They were real. This is real.
They fell apart, eyes red from both.
The brothers, looking surprised, recognized the woman.
Jack stood, facing the brothers. “In order for the empty to release him”
“Later, boys”
As a personal joke, the shadow changed its form to Castiel’s classic look with the trench coat.
Sam sees her. The mixed feeling between panic and joy spread over him. He rushed his way to catch her between his arms. Desperate.
Dean’s looking more vulnerable than he had ever been, but in all that mess, in all that fear he held for so long, Dean smiles, finally true to himself.
Sam smiles at his brother's better mood.
“I got this...shaky feeling that everything will just work for you as well”
Sam rushed his way to Dean’s side but got stopped with a sign of Dean’s hand.
“I’ve been screaming my guts out for hours” He’s now screaming and he’s sorry because Sam doesn’t deserve it but Dean can’t help it”I’ve been preying to Jack, I’ve even went to death library, looking for something, for
“I get that, but what’s with the pile of PB & J?”
Sam rushes to his brother’s side and traps him into a hug.
“I also know how you see yourself, the same way I used to see me...”
Dean began to shake, his frustration, his pain,
Dean’s still calling him from the other side. “Cas!”
...and so am I” Sam stands, taking Eileen by her shoulders as he kisses her check quickly
Sam’s afraid to move, fearing that if he let go, he might lose her again, but he won’t let that happen, not ever again.
Sam nods as a thanks for the drink and fixed his eyes again on the room.
Dean reacted to the word Amara emphasizes and as a reflex, he touched his left shoulder, recalling the words Castiel told him years ago.
For the past twelve years, their relationship went in different places but at the end of the day, they were family, and now even more so. This felt heavy for both.
The gag looked confused, not getting the reason for that.
“We wanted to surprise you.” Eileen’s looking pleased.
” Sam smiles at his brother. “I’ve spoked of it with Eileen and she’s on board.”
“Sleep!” an anger scream from an unknown force, filled the place, forcing Dean to cover his ears, turning all around to see where it comes from.
Dean sees his brother, smiling as well, standing by the entrance.
Jack’s eyes glowed and turned dark for a second and a light covered him. After vanished, they see Amara now in his place.
family, behind.
Sam still’s adjusting to the blast and he feels it, she feels her.
They started as a family and end up as one, cause after all, f
Dean feels comfy, he drowns his arm between his brother’s arms.
Sam jumps at her voice, still impressed. “Yeah...just need” he clears his throat “to punch Dean later for not locking the door”
“Hello!” He waves his hand as usual. Smiling warmly.
Jo and Ellen sacrifice, Bobby’s death.
As he managed to avoid, he smiles at her “Lovely lady” and with a slight bow, he keeps his way out.
Sam, now more awake, nods in understatement. “I know Dean, I know”
“But they don’t have to, so I make sure he dreams of his happiest moments”
Dean half-smiles, relating.
the one who sent him there, knowing that loving
“I don’t want to fight you, but if I must...” Jack’s voice was defying.
“I want” he sees at his family. “to spend the day with you all.” Now shyly.
“Sleep! Sleep! Sleep!”
“Alright” He stands. “I think we’re all set.”
“I teach some spells, rituals and basic data from monsters. Charlie teaches a few hacking skills; she’s even working in ways to upgrade the bunker without Mrs. Butter’s magic.”
He knew this place. He has been dreaming of it for the past weeks, since Castiel sacrifice for him.
“I’m not here to fight you”
“You still worry.” Sam completed the line of thoughts.
From the other side, a glow made it through the darkness. Dean sees it, eyes wide open as he recognizes someone.
The light fades.
He goes quiet as Dean recognizes the mark forming around his left shoulder. The handprint of Castiel,
Dean looked up for a second, just to get it back on the table, pretending his brother wasn’t really there.
“You’re gonna clean this mess!” Sam yells from his seat.
“Cas made a deal, back when Jack was dying”
“I’m not pretending anything” Dean raised his voice. “it’s just...”
Dean rolled his eyes frustrated.
As soon as the light shuts off, a dark rift, much as the one it took Castiel, appears over the wall near Dean.
“Hello” Standing behind it, Jack waved his hand as he characteristically does, smiling.
“Hey buddy, ready? Where do you wanna sit big boy?”
The landscape changes in every mile they go.
that you ever felt that way.”
“Oh... Okay”
Sam stands, ouching. Jack smiles at him but keeps walking right in front of Dean and Cas, still lying on the floor. He puts his hand on Castiel’s forehead and a less bright light covers Jack's hand, making Castiel frown a bit.
“Give your best shot”
“He was the only angel, since creation, that was able to love selflessly, by his own choice” His voice echoed the room. “to see beyond orders, even if it cost him a piece of himself”
Amara walks around the room.
Dean, looking now to Castiel, lanes for a quick and out of balance kiss. Turning Cas cheeks slightly red.
“Cas?” Dean whispered.
Dean and Sam first encounter after years. Charlie’s dancing. Eileen attacking Sam, Castiel entering the barn.
is a go.”
Next to the bed, he spots an old radio almost hidden behind some frames with pictures of the “Free Will” team. The old gadget Dean gave him was “pause” pressed. Curious, he changed to play.
“Cas... you matter, your life matters”
Rowena then snapped her fingers.
While moving, he realizes Dean hasn’t released his hand and Dean notices precisely that, watching their hands together. As a reflex he slightly free his fingers but refuses to and holds it again sure of himself.
“Love you too Sammy.”
Dean might have raised his voice more than he intended to and regrets immediately. He had done this more times he could remember, but this felt different, like it was his first time, and in a way, it was.
“Sam...”
... cause when I had the chance to speak up, I was too damn scared to say it back”
Dean stretched his last words, side eying Castiel to see his reaction.
“I mean, they did everything wrong, but it doesn’t have to be that way. We can make a difference not only for hunters but for everyone. Imagine” He stands in front of his brother, looking hopeful “no more deaths.”
“You know, it’s late, and my room is far from this one” Dean’s visibly blushed. “maybe I could...stay here.”
Dean and Sam sighed as relief.
From behind, Dean sneaks to his brother's side, beer in hand.
“Oh, don’t mind her. That was a teachable moment” She paused. “The poor bitch had the audacity to muck magic if you could believe that”
into his body.
Dean uses sign language but fails at the end with an extra open gesture making it look like he said, “How do you puke?”.
“Cas is human now, he needs to eat”. Dean raised his shoulders, pointing the obvious.
Dean smiles, he had no clue to that answer and couldn’t be more excited about it. Joy barely holding, he turns to see Castiel, watching him hopefully optimistic.
As the engine starts, the music does, high and deep.
Tears began to break free its way down Dean’s face as he lanes over the bed, song playing midway at the background.
“So, is she--"his voice trembled, afraid to ask. “--is she in heaven?”
He got no response, he attempted to release his hand to call him, but the other man held it tighter, not letting him go.
A memory came to his mind.
Dean looks up, struggling. “I think it’s a great idea, I do...I just..."
“Heaven, I was -- with my mother.” Jack looks a bit sad.
“Trust me, I’ll explain later, but this is the best way, and we might get more than we just came for.”
“He has been brainwashed more times than I could tell, and every time, even if it took some time, he stayed true to himself,
She then turned to see him, with a thoughtful sight.
!” Dean was determined to speak his truth. “You are gonna let me talk this time” his voice turned softer. “you don’t need to be afraid of the answer”.
Reality hits Cas. This was the first time he hears those words; this was the first time he feels that’s true.
“Seriously, are you gonna worry about me..now?
"Because that’s how he became human” Jack turned to see directly at Dean.
“I’ll make you a new deal” The voice of Amara echoed through Jake’s body.
Cas turns to see them, quiet pride of himself. “It’s honey-- I collected it myself” he smiles proudly.
Sam’s smiles fade and as a reflex, Dean’s went for a quick, tight, hug.
“Don’t we know it”
“Apparently when he experienced a moment of true happiness the empty would be summoned... and take him forever”
Jack smiles, but he seems like he doesn’t get it.
“You like what you see..." His voice got deeper “...cowboy?”
” He paused, controlling his emotions. “and I’m not letting you pass through this alone”
The song goes louder as he drives. With every mile he feels lighter, he feels braver.
Castiel sighed at Sam’s question. “Nothing. We’ve been praying but no answers”
“But that was before I was the queen of hell” She smirks.
Sam question instantly changed the mood.
“Breakfast?” Sam asked, using sign language.
“Samuel, always a gentleman” She winks at the boy “I have news from the Winchester boy. Thought you might like to know the updates”
“Dean, don’t!” Sam tried to stop him, scared of what might happen.
“You don’t have control over him, don’t you?” Amara said defying, amused.
“Great” Dean said annoyed “What are you doing here?”
“Jack? Where have you been?” Sam was trying to process the situation.
Dean’s looking like he gives a damn. “And what about the demon in our dungeon?”
“What?” Dean’s blushed.
The first touch followed the second and so, till the shape of their lips were no longer strangers to each other. They kiss truth spoken, by choice, they kiss,
Dean, confused, turns to see a light coming from his arm. He rushed to lose his jacket and shirt. In panic he sees something forming.
The song, continued,
Dean gave up into his brother’s arms. He needed to say it, he needed it to become real, not only for Castiel but for himself.
“Well, if it doesn’t work you can always go full douchebag with the TED talk wannabe, kale lover. What was it? -God bless kale?-”
Cas goes into the group hug, greeting them as well.
Dean raised his gaze, still holding Miracle’s head, looking suspicious, like if he didn’t said such a thing.
“Do you smell that?” Sam asked, sniffing deeply. The smell of sulfur filled the room.
“What? Maybe we could re-create the spell he used to summon the empty and...”
A hand holding his own. He follows the path of his hand to see the other one. Dean, forehead over the bed, still sitting on the chair next to him, is sleeping.
“Dean…” Before he could even say another word he was interrupted.
Sam jumped back scooting away quickly. "What is it Sam? What's doing this? I don't understand."
Dean watched as Cas's wings flew out behind him, this always meant Cas was letting go, he was completely in this moment. The first time he saw Cas's wings like this he...his mind suddenly started making small explosions. "Wait, wait…" Dean's voice was strained, but holding on. "I want to be inside you when I come." Cas's eyes looked up the body of his lover licking Dean one more time before letting him move. Dean shuddered trying hard not to show his glee in a dopey grin. He went to the end of the bed controlling Cas's position by gently tugging at those extended wings. Kneeling on all fours was often the easiest position they could take when his wings were out, and Cas didn't mind at all. This was also the same position they had the first time they had made love. The memory prickled down his spine, "I.." Cas could barely get his words out. "Are you okay?" Dean sounded worried. 'Had he pulled the wings too hard?' He leaned in to get closer as Cas continued, "...I've missed you so much." Softly smiling Dean put his forehead against Cas’s back between the wings. He laid a gentle kiss there, “Not more than I’ve missed you... I know it’s you Cas, I believe it, I feel it."
He had never used the shower in the bunker before, there was never a need when you could instantly clean yourself. The water was ice until he figured out how to make it warm. The sensation of almost falling on a slippery floor was new. Eventually he read, smelled, and used every bottle of liquids in the shower not really sure if he was following the directions correctly. Drying off he put his towel on an empty drying rod and started to look over the clothes Dean had given him. He knew this shirt, it was one he often saw him in when it wasn’t flannel and a jacket. Holding it up to his face to take a deep breath, it was Dean’s alright, in fact it wasn’t even clean but smelled of him in the most comforting way. There was a pair of clean briefs, and socks too. Cas put on everything but the socks and then brushed his teeth. He was very familiar with this part, when he was done it put it in the cup that had one other brush in it.
Chuck had an agreement with the Empty. While it certainly has never been as powerful as himself it always existed, or at least it seemed like it. The thing about the Empty though, was that it couldn't create anything. It observed, watched, hibernated, and generally was a black hole to the entire universe. When it noticed Chuck was beginning to create things, using matter, it could tell it's existence was slowly being pulled away. So it struck a deal to help maintain its own existence.
“Cas?” His voice was betraying him and he knew it.
"When were you in Jerusalem?"
Both Eileen and Sam watched Cas make his way to the staircase and take a mug from Dean. "Is that tea?" Eileen signed. "Yes it's tea, am I not allowed to like tea?" Dean said sarcastically with a hint of actual frustration. "No, no of course not that's fine." Sam had his hands up baffled and wanted to laugh as the couple headed outside.
"I just thought I'd catch the sunrise." He took a slow sip and watched the steam blur his vision.
"Well, I mean you do come off as a macho hetero guy. I can see why Cas might have thought there would be no chance with you, he...I shouldn't tell you this." Sam wriggled on his chair and set down his coffee. "Cas once asked me if his vessel was displeasing to you. I didn't understand for a while what he meant, but it became pretty clear the way he would look at you, only respond when you prayed to him, and generally was only interested if you were involved."
“Really?” Dean was even less inclined to believe this.
This was the last test. If this was Cas he would be able to tell. It might sound like Cas and be convincing in other ways, but they would never be able to impersonate how it was between them. No one had known about them either. Dean had kept it quiet not out of any shame, but for protection. It was no secret how important Cas was to the Winchester boys, but no one knew Dean and Cas were lovers.
They were both laying flat on their backs looking up at the ceiling.
"Dean! Calm down! I mean you two looked in love for years but nothing. I thought, and I think he did too that his vessel stopped you two from ever being more."
“Oh, well not usually, but I've started to finally read some manga that I’ve been wanting to read for years. The library in town has every copy, everytime I go in I switch out for the next one.”
"If Jack does bring him back…"Sam took a breath seeing his brother's reaction. Dean winced his eyebrows furrowed in a look of anguish. "...would you allow yourself to love him the way he loves you."
Dean was an all over sleeper he didn’t really have a side. But he put his book on the table so he took the right thinking it made the most sense.
"Sam? Sam where are you? Did you find them?" Jack was rushing down the halls trying to find where Sam had gone when he caught them from the corner of his eye as he passed. Back tracking he came in abruptly stopping seeing Dean like he was.
Cas felt breathless while his need grew stronger. Angels weren’t meant for this, having love, making love, it was just just one more thing he never imagined he'd experience, or want to. He always gave himself to Dean, as much as he could. He would never be able to show him his true face, his true voice. It used to bother him, but now he would choose to be human if only they could keep this between them. His head was swimming as he felt Dean kiss along his neck. Light teeth ran across his pulse as Dean laid his mouth down and gently sucked. He never wanted to give pain to Cas, but there was a trust between them that he had never given to anyone else. He sucked on that spot leaving a very small mark that healed itself moments later. As he pulled away Cas’s eyes were drowsy and fluttering with a smile at the corners of his lips. This look often meant he wanted more. Cas wanted to see all of Dean now.
The giant being instantly disappeared and Sam could focus his eyes. He saw Dean still running, but there was a figure there. He knew it was Castiel even though it was shrouded in a dark shadow.
“What was it like?” Sam wasn’t catching all of the subtext, that was to be expected though as he wasn't fully aware of how close Dean and Cas had been. To him Cas was like a middle brother keeping Dean and himself working together rather than at each other’s throats.
"Dean, I am going to need a lot of help. I have nothing, no powers, no money, no human history. It will be difficult for me to really be a human for a while. I know what you just said downstairs. And I want that to be true, but if being together like an actual couple will be too hard I can go, figure it out on my own and come back when I won't be such a burden."
“Okay, but...” Again he was interrupted.
"No, no...not the monsters." He shifted leaning forward in his chair.
Energy has to come from somewhere. When Chuck would create anything the Empty could feel it's matter leave. To try and maintain balance it demanded that all the beings, his angels and demons, had to come back to the fold of the Empty. One angel's mass was enough to offset what Chuck would take to create thousands of beings on his worlds.
"You okay?" Dean was suddenly very afraid.
Every night Sam and Eileen would pray to Jack. Not in the traditional praying to God with a wishlist and confessional. Sam's was always talking about the day. He used it as a way to help cherish each extra day they had now, but also like it was writing a letter to a family member.
“I do.” Dean sounding assured and went to Cas to embrace him.
“Oh of course, I’m not used to you needing that kind of stuff. Just give me a second I’ll grab some things.” Dean hurried off to his room and found his favorite tshirt and some other items he figured Cas would need. The towels were all fluffed and put away, Eileen had whipped them into shape on keeping the place tidy now that they weren’t having to leave at a moment's notice for every apocalypse.
“I would like to take a shower. Are there any clothes and towels I can use?”
"Well I better go, Dean is trying to tell me something with his head."
"Remember when we used to catch sunrises driving all over the country? I guess we don't have to be doing that anymore."
'Always the wordsmith.' Dean thought, as the sides of his lips curled into a bright smile. Trying to stifle his grin he leaned in and took the love from Cas's lips again.
“Yeah.” Dean’s voice was as cool and distant as ever. He didn’t give his name, normally whoever called knew who they are calling.
Cas turned around as a knot jumped into his throat. They were here, surely they could both tell it was him. But it wasn’t like the other times when God had brought him back. This was so different, he knew he had left behind a body. Dean's held breath forced its way from his lips as he swiftly got out of the car. Sam and Dean both walked up to Cas with questions in their eyes. If it wasn’t him they both felt themselves almost willing to accept this ruse just to have him back. Things weren’t always great when they were by themselves.
---- Added late 11/13
Dean looked scared for a moment, not in heaven? He thought of what it had been like in Hell for him, imagining Cas suffering broke his heart.
Cas spent his first day back from the Empty and human in utter bliss.
Dean held onto Cas's wings as nearly the whole length of himself had filled Cas. He knew not to pull too hard, but those wings were an extension of Cas and deserved to be included. Cas's head rose up as he couldn't hold back his moans. Dean felt that he was starting to hit that spot within all men that leaves them helpless. He reached around and held Cas in his hand. He was pulsatingly hard and cried out as Dean began to move his hand over his sex. He knew Cas was near climax. His wings began to shine, and like a bulb bursting the wings disappeared while Cas was writhing. He came powerfully, almost violently. Dean held him tight taking Cas's seed into his hand. As Cas quieted he put his lover's seed on his sex and continued. He too was close. Cas pushed back against Dean, but was quite spent now leaning down unable to keep himself on his arms. He could feel every inch of Dean filling him, and relished the sensation. Dean's hands were digging into Cas's ass as he thrust himself over and over. He felt the building sensation. "Cas…" He whispered losing his speech.
Cas smiled with his eyes. He knew why they hadn't told others, they had agreed a long time ago it was for the best. The world they lived in was so complicated and not becoming more simple. He didn't know what this year would hold, and if the Empty would pull him back tomorrow, this was more important. Laying the clothes back down he got in the bed pulling the covers over them both. This time Dean had turned on his other side so Cas would be big spoon. Cas drew him tightly against himself closing his eyes. He didn't sleep, but he could meditate. He took in every movement, smell, and sound as Dean slept. Cas would protect this man, this man he pulled from perdition so long ago, he was a guardian angel after all.
“Well it’s dark, and nothing. It’s like...nothing.” Cas made a slight shrug as he was trying to be supportive of Sam, to help him follow what he was saying, but he was breaking on the inside from what he had experienced. He knew it would be his future again. “I was sleeping, and I heard a voice that said my name, and I woke up. I thought you...had done something.” He looked to both of them, but could clearly tell from their faces they weren’t the ones to thank for coming back.
Dean felt it, he knew what was happening. He didn't even look behind him and went running down the open field towards the being.
"One day, you will die, and so will I. But we get to do that together now. No Chuck and no Jack will take that away from us."
Pulling Cas against him the feeling of their skin together surged butterflies up his body. After all of these years it was always the same when they returned to each other.
“I didn’t know you liked reading if it wasn’t demonology.”
“No, I was in the Empty.” Cas said it plainly as to not make it sound more threatening to them, as humans.
"What does it matter Chuck? This is all over. Let us be there, at least there you'll  have some trace of me, of us, your favorite characters."
Sam needed answers, "Where were you? In Heaven?”
Sam was still waking up when Dean threw the phone down between them. They had just finished a case and were already exhausted having driven several hours that night. Sam was worried by what he had just heard. Dean had been barely hanging onto himself for months now. If this was real or fake he knew his brother was going to break.
He stopped moving for a moment and Dean abruptly was pulled to look at him.
"I...I don't know. I have never felt this before, even when I was human a long time ago." He had a concerned look on his face.  "I feel tingly, my heart is beating very fast. I feel a joy, but this is so intense. Is this a heart attack? Should I be eating toast?"
Jack watched the two humans he loved more than any others, these two men were his family. The only family he'd ever get to know. He savored the moment even in it's sorrow, it meant he was alive still.
"Castiel" Jack's voice boomed, shaking the ground. "You have a choice, you can remain an angel keeping your true form and the chance to possibly find another vessel, or you can become human using the vessel you have bonded with and live a human life."
Dean's phone rang stirring Sam out his dead sleep. Dean picked up the unknown call. In the hunter’s life you don’t screen calls, you know that picking up the phone can be life or death for the person on the other end. With all the pain in their lives lately, getting a call to help beat some supernatural ass was the distraction he needed.
When they came back Sam and Eileen were already back in their quarters. They had taken over one side of the bunker and converted a few rooms into a larger master bedroom. All of what was left from the Men of Letters didn’t seem as important anymore but nothing was gotten rid of.
“The chair is fine, we'll get them in the wash tomorrow and you can borrow some more clothes.” Dean had set down his book.
"When Chuck said that our world is the only one that Cas didn't do what he was written to, it hit me. Our bond was always real, it was always pure, it was ours." Hot tears started to flow again and he wiped them away. "I didn't get to tell him I loved him Sam. The Empty took him before I could even process what was happening."
Sam looked like he had just cracked the case, “Jack.”
"Dean, Cas sacrificed himself. It was the most selfless act anyone can do. I was going to do it for all of you. We love you both, but Cas. He was in love with you Dean. I don't know a lot of Earth and existing in it. But love, it poured from him to you from every moment I saw you both together." Dean made small whimpers and tried to clear his throat.
Dean laughed he couldn't hold it back. His head was raised to the sky as he tried to contain himself.
“Is he okay?” Cas said concerned, he knew they all would be a good influence on Jack, but being a baby it would be difficult for them both. Mary was with them though, she had taken care of a baby more recently than any of them.
She play slapped at him, and he caught her hand pulling her against him. A little surprised she stumbled, but he held her tight.
"Let go Dean." Cas felt him do just that, sometimes that small permission was all Dean needed to finally finish. With small grunts and deep breaths Dean came in surges. It was a moment he never thought would happen again. His mind was left white, empty, and content.
Before he had died, the bunker had begun to feel like home to Cas. Being there again he felt his body relax from tension he hadn’t known was building. The boys went to Jack first to try and prepare him. Meeting Jack was a proud moment for Cas. His emotions showed on his face as he held onto this boy he had given his protection to from the womb. As an angel he never imagined a life like this for himself. The chance to help raise a child of any kind was never meant for him. The joy he suddenly felt was intense, and not like an emotion he had ever experienced. He felt true pride. They spent several hours getting to know each other, eventually Dean and Sam slipped away to give them some alone time.
Dean slumped onto his back in a catatonic state. His pupils were tiny dots in green. His face was raw with tears and flushed cheeks and nose that were bright red. "What happened Dean?! Where's Cas?" He kept trying to get Dean to snap out of it.
Dean locked his fingers into Cas hand that was resting over his stomach. "I've never been the little spoon before. It's...I like it." Leaning forward Cas kissed the back of Dean's neck. "This reminds me a lot of how I held you when pulling you out of hell. The hand you're holding was further up on your shoulder, but I guess it was a bit like spooning, and my angel blade was in this hand. I killed many demons that day."
change him” Jack emphasized “and when you admitted your love for him, when he heard your prayer, your bound was even stronger, and it was all he needed to allow himself to feel true happiness,
For the next hours, the chat reaches till the blank spaces are filled, letting the reason they were there come into picture.
“What are you thinking?” Castiel asked knowing by now what that look meant.
“So, are you still the Queen?”
Sam looks at her and kisses her forehead gently as the four sets near the table.
Dean looks confronted.
He obeys. Jack leans over the cake, eyes closed, he blows the candle as he opens his eyes again, looking hopeful.
“Rowena?”
To Dean, Jack’s words felt as a knife, twisting inside him. It was painful to hear just how blind he was.
“In order to do so, it’s needed a bond between the angel or demon in the empty and someone on the other side, praying its name.”
“So, how’s Claire, I heard from Jody that she and Kaia went to you guys a few days back”
“Hey no, no-- don’t!”
Dean, still edgy, walks away, about to leave the room, he’s done.
“It’s okay Dean, It’s okay”
“Okay, I trust you”
Total silence and nothing but darkness again, until Jack opens his eyes, glowing orange.
“I’m taking my father out”
Sam sadly smiles as he hugs him as he whispered something to his ear only.
Sam’s looking troubled at the shelfs, wondering over the possibilities in the books and tapes guarded in the bunker.
As soon as Jack nodes, he opens his eyes, one glowing orange and the other full in black.
Jack stands, still smiling. “The empty”
“Can it do that?” Jack asks concerned, sinking in the threat.
Jack remained silence for a moment. He goes to Castiel’s side again and he smiles, he feels Cas emotions as it was his own.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about” Dean plays defensive “and now..." He takes the salver, both hands. “...if you excuse me, I have someone to impress”
Jack smile fades.
They remain silent for a bit. Still wondering till Sam speaks his mind.
“He’s okay, he’s just sleeping”
“That’s great -- isn’t?”
Sam, speechless smiles to Jack as he hugs him too.
Dean, head down, slowly nodded. He gets what his brother’s saying.
All in the family has matching pink and purple Hawaiian shirts, even Miracle has one.
“Is everything okay?” Sam slowly stepped to his brother's side on the opposite side of the table so he could get a better gaze.
“Dean?” his voice, still weak called for him as well.
“Only if we don’t see anything” She said playfully.
Through the screams, a little shock of power interrupted the ongoing sound of despair, making the shadow turn, recognizing the presence.
He tried to stand but Dean, looking quite frustrated, stopped him.
“Jack, it’s okay, we get it.” Sam tried to comfort Jack.
“I have an idea” Dean smiles.
The light is still the same, but feels way more intimate now, both still in front of each other, smiling.
“Dean! Hi” She smiles brightly.
“Like we said, Angels were not made for love truly, selflessly, but his love for you” Jack approached Dean’s side, face to face. “Is way stronger that everything he felt before, something he didn’t even knew he could feel”
Jack turned again to see at Castiel, bright smiling. “And it was beautiful guys” he paused. “I saw his memories, even those heaven attempted to erase, even those who he forgot, and I know now, I know why I felt he was special since the moment he touched my mother”
Dean’s impressed but not surprised. He winks at her, sipping from his drink.
Sam’s body tensed up.
“Already talked to Charlie and some from the apocalypse world who stayed here and they’re coming in a few days.”
She sees deeply into Deans eyes.
“I’ve convinced her to try school, at least for a while.” Castiel said but sounded oddly sad.
“I love you Dean”
Jack barely holds the happiness he feels after hearing those words from Dean.
“Eileen!” no response. “C’mon... C’mon” Sam moves her gently, in desperation for waking her up. Still nothing.
Dean’s interruption made quite clear the state of mind he was. Sam, went with it, at least for now.
“Although I can’t take all the credit” She points out to the every corner of the room, making visible the warding. “You might want to lose a few...you’re making a lady feel unwelcome”
Sam, still nervous to be in Rowena’s presence, hands her a glass of whisky.
“You’re thinking what if all of this could help everyone.”
Eileen, amused, smiles back. She looks at Sam's hand and drags him out to the end of the hallway, into Sam’s bedroom, feeling every inch of the other’s bod as they get into the room, feeling the heat with no restrictions, just the joy to be together again.
“I got an idea” She paused “Switch places with me”
Eileen wrinkled her nose, happy at the touch and smiles brighter to Sam.
A red smoke embraced her till she vanished, leaving
“So, are you gonna go full British on the bunker?”
The place underneath started bobbling in some kind of dark mass till a figure appeared. It’s Castiel, unconscious.
“What?” Sam’s confused.
“Take care Cas”
Dean, full hands on the wheel, smiles at the song.
Sam looks around the books, arms raising.
“Always” He nods to Sam.
He made an attempt to stop the one Eileen was fighting with when another man came to the picture and stopped Dean with one hand only. Dean was about to let the box drop and throw a swing when a deep, loud voice made everyone freeze.
“Look, I’m happy, I’m genially am, hell I didn’t even knew what that was until these last days” The struggle is written on every expression in Dean’s face “but being in here, it’s just a reminder of what it was,
Dean, briefly, looked into his brother’s eyes for an answer that doesn’t exist.
His emotions, trying to run free, were held sharply by the sound of the door knocking.
But this felt unfamiliar. The emptiness, the sorrow and despair were overwhelming.
The empty knew they were right, for some reason, the angel keeps waking up, no matter how broken he was, how damaged he is, Castiel keeps fighting.
She raised her hand, shaking, afraid it was just a cruel joke from hell. But she could feel Sam, he was real,
Not much there has changed, although everything has. The place seems more meticulous, more in order. There’s only one big table around the map and behind them, an empty room is now where the shelves were. Only that now, it’s not exactly empty.
“Deal”
“Dean?” His voice is still weak.
Dean’s playing with Miracle, kneeling and talking like it was a baby.
“So, team free will 3.0 is a go?” Sam asked, trying to anticipate to his brothers line of thoughts.
As he struggles, Dean manages to stay in front of the portal, ignoring every warning his brother has to say. Without hesitation, he leans his left arm through the portal, knowing only one thing, that Castiel is there.
Amara smiled, since she was with Jack, she started to feel in real harmony, to feel as unity,
“But it’s not lying. Every reality, every universe, has its version of heaven, hell and purgatory while the empty-- there’s only one”
“No, I mean...” Castiel tried to use his grace but got nothing. “My grace...” he looked at Dean, confused.
In a fast move, the shadow took Jack’s head. “You started this”
Rowena, pleased of herself, stood up and started walking around the room as she continued.
Everyone stopped and turned to see Jack, full attention.
As the figure kept squeezing his hand harder and harder, it changed its form, first Dean, then Jack, Sam to Dean again.
, he smirks.
“Alright, it’s all set again.” Dean lit up the candle once more. “Come on Jack, make a wish.”
As Castiel pulls a shirt from a drawer, he looks at Dean, suspiciously, eyes half closed. Then he reacts, he remembers that same look from the
“Jack! You made it.”
“I just got a call from a hunter” he took an exhausted breath and continued. “A nest of vampires slaughtered a family in Canton.”
Sam side-eyed his brother to reassure him. “She handled, but it got me thinking” he paused “What a waste”
Dean, barely holding his tears, walks away into the bed again.
“That’s how Jack was able to awake Castiel the first time. But that bound hasn’t ever been strong enough to also make a trip back home. A
As a reflex, the mention of that name made Castiel open his eyes wider.
“Cas!” Dean screamed.
The ocean’s clear water waves with the fresh wind. Sun gently shines through all. A peaceful scene.
The darkness, as expected, filled the scene. Someone is standing in the middle of the nothingness, as it gets closer, we see is Jack, eyes closed again. Next to him, a black mass starts to emerge till the dark tossed Castiel free.
Dean briefly raised his gaze to catch his brother’s eyes, but he couldn’t bare it, so he immediately turned his head away.
“Dean...” Amara voices echoed through Jack, like a whisper, looking at the angel, tying the missing dots.
Dean’s trying to clear his tears sneakily, avoiding eye contact with his brother.
“I...” Castiel hesitates. “I think so, yes. Are you?”
“That was my class” Eileen answered in excitement.
The brothers looked at each other a bit scare.
, they all started to overwhelm him.
Amara still focuses on Dean.
“She’s...fine, she’s sleeping. Apparently being brought back to life is exhausting” He breathed out audible.
Overwhelming emotions filled the moment, as Jack continued.
and decides to play along.
“Hey!” Dean started, visibly offended at the audacity, when he saw his brother going his way with a determined look, fist closed when and-- ouch! Sam punches at Dean on the shoulder.
Slow steps of heels coming from behind them echoed as a woman entered the room, making the brothers turn, guns pointing.
boys,
“So that’s it Sam, no spell, no tricks...just a curse, because loving me is that” His voice sounding defeated. “a curse”
Sam nods, eyes rolling, he’s done talking. He grabs his brother closer and seals him in a hug. Dean smiles, and hugs back.
“Hey buddy” he starts to play with him. “I’ve missed you too.”
Sam’s looking a bit ashamed, even ridiculous at the mention, excepting some kind of joke from his brother, but he doesn’t.
Music started and filled the room with a very clear mood.
“He’ll be back.”
“So... movie night?” Sam asked after a short while, smiling at Eileen.
Castiel smiles.
He looked away ashamed for a moment, but he wanted to do this.
me too.”
“What did you wish for?” Eileen asked curious.
Sam’s still thinking, still clueless, trying to process that.
“That’s my boy!” He hugs them tighter. “I’m happy for you Sammy, and” he turns to Eileen. “I’m so sorry for you”
“You take him, and I’ll release every being out of here, not only the ones in your world... I’ll release every creature from all universes.”
Staring down at her he tried to show his love through his eyes. She understood, nodded and signed, "Of course you do." Grinning and taking a moment she then signed, "I love you too."
Dean smiled, this already felt like the healthiest relationship he'd ever been in. Within moments they were both asleep but still intertwined.
"This is a different brand from what you used to drink." Cas observed.
Dean went for the door checking that no one like Jack was lurking in the hall, then closed and locked it. With the door secured he felt his shoulders relax, and he let out a breath he hadn't known he had been holding. Dean had this conversation with himself over and over on the long drive home. But then it hit him, ‘Cas heard my prayer!’ Waves of realization on what that meant rushed over him in a tingling sensation. Almost afraid to turn around and face the real possibility of it being him he heard Cas speak first.
"You knew I liked tea?" He was completely shocked anyone had found his stash.
Cas smirked, but not because Jack was already grown, and remembered him. He smiled at the small fantasy he had, had before dying. Part of himself imagined raising Jack with Dean as their son. Dean showing him the best of being human, and himself teaching Jack what it was to be angelic. That dream was only something he allowed himself in moments of weakness. He had almost been happy Kelly would surely die in childbirth for his fantasy to come true. It was his one dark thought, even now it still gave him joy visualizing Dean as a father. Cas knew he was not the angel he was before meeting Dean. That thought didn’t frighten him as it did so long ago. He had free will, he felt emotions, he was unlike most angels in many ways, and there was no way to explain it.
"Far better actually. But I'm not sure what to do with my other arm. It feels odd here." His fingers brushed against Dean's butt and Dean caught his breath for a split second. "I have put it up under my head." Dean felt him shifting to try and do that.
Nearby, Dean, Cas and Sam are sitting in some beach chairs, toes in the sand, holding drinks with little umbrellas, just enjoying the moment
Dean’s conviction is overwhelming, Castiel’s eyes lose the fight on holding his tears.
“Cas said he loved me”
As Sam approaches his way next to his brother, a blasting noise echoed through the bunker. Lights flickering between red and dark started to cover the place, the alarms goes on and loud, making the brothers react in high alert.
“Of course, Samuel” sounding offended.
That made Dean to stop sharply.
The shadow, hesitating, makes the mass of darkness release the angel from the ground once again.
“That mark was never on your skin, Dean. It was in your soul, and that can’t be erased.”
“You’re human now”
“We’re besties now” Creepy smiling.
Castiel nods, but Dean looks quite awkward.
“Hello!”
“Jack?” Sam confusion was taking his sanity. “What the hell happened?”
He takes Dean’s by the shoulders. “We’ll be alright. We got this. You can rest now.”
“Dean!” his brother shouted.
“Sam?... is it really you?” Eileen mutters weakly.
Dean’s looking proud for both,
“His love for you broke heaven’s control over him, it changed the fate of this world, his love for you defied God itself”
“I told you Dean” She smiled at him. “we will always help each other”
, is not getting better. It doesn’t help that he’s exhausted, he hasn’t slept properly in.. a while. He can’t anymore, he doesn’t want to, because every
The clock keeps ticking, the wheels keep turning, and the nagging sensation Dean’s been having ever since..
They stop at the diner after the short ride there. Dean gets a burger, Sam gets a salad, Dean drinks more than he should, the usual, except it’s really
. It was.. um... At the time I couldn’t really process what was happening, or what you were saying, ‘cause it was just a bit too much, you know..  I mean, you were gonna die, man..” He shakes his head as his vision gets clouded by tears. “You know I’m not good with all of this.. emotional stuff.. but I want you to know that...” He clears his throat, attempting to make his voice sound clearer, more sure of itself, but alas, failing miserably. “It meant
“You son of a bitch.. you did it. You actually did it,” he responds in awe. “Now tell me where you are so we can come pick you up and bring you home.”
“Are you okay? Where are you? Are you hurt? Wait- hold on, Cas, I need to tell you something.” He was not going to let this chance slip by. Not ever again.
be. He feels the anger flooding back, all of the emotions he doesn’t understand, that he hasn’t gotten a hold of, and he can’t take it anymore. By some divine power, which certainly isn’t Chuck, Dean stands up with such force that he surprises even himself. Sam looks up at him with a startled expression and asks, “Dean, what are you-”
“Cas?” Dean asks disbelievingly, having put the phone back to his ear by now, clutching it with both of his hands, still worried that
.” The angel speaks the words as if it was written in the stars, in the most heartfelt way imaginable. And with one sentence, Dean feels a hundred pounds lighter. Tears come pouring down his face a second time this evening, which isn’t a normal Thursday in his books. But what’s even more unusual is that he’s crying out of
might disappear again. Sam looks over at Dean, eyebrows raised, shocked, watching the road as much as he keeps turning to his brother.
Sam on the other hand, is doing just fine, he’s been texting with Eileen almost constantly since they got in the car, and he is, to an extent, happy. They did it, once again, saved the world and all that. Brought everyone back.. Well, almost everyone. Dean was the one who said that they were ‘finally free’ before they left, but Sam knows that’s a bit too good to be true. It’s been four hours now, and Dean has spent the entirety of it, with a pained expression on his face, staring straight ahead at the road. That, to Sam, doesn’t look like someone who’s ‘finally free’. He tried talking with him at first, but he soon got the message Dean was trying to send, more on a mental wavelength than a technological one this time. His brother was not in a mood for talking, and when Dean doesn’t want to talk, Sam has learnt it’s better to leave him be, until he’s ready to open up about it. Although, this time, he’s pretty sure he knows what’s wrong.
.. or something..”
Sam and Dean have been on the road for a few hours now. Although, to Dean, it feels like an eternity. They’re going to get Eileen, which is great.. It is.. but there’s a nagging sensation at the back of Dean’s mind that he can’t get rid of. He’s been trying to place where exactly it stems from, but all he’s been able to figure out is that it seems to be spreading all throughout his body, as well as the fact that it gets worse every time he looks over at Sam.
angel, in more ways than one, responds lovingly.
Dean looks down, suddenly getting a rush of anxiety. He takes another shuddering breath, trying to calm himself, collect his thoughts. But it’s hard when he could have sworn that he, for a second, could see the blue star changing its gaze. Making it burn right through his eyes, straight into his soul, challenging him, no.. not challenging him,
The name clumsily stumbles its way out of Dean’s mouth.
.. and all..
He’s taken back, to a place he recognises very well, and even though it’s not a pleasant occurrence, he’s gotten used to it by now, but so far only in his sleep.
Coming from the bathroom there was only a sliver of light peeking out from Dean’s door. He looked through the crack to see if he should come in, he suddenly felt very awkward. Dean was on the bed in different clothes reading a book. Cas knocked while pushing the door open. “Where should I put these?” He was holding his clothes in a bundle.
His hands searched Cas, but it wasn't enough. Without taking his attention away in a fluid movement he slipped off the trench coat laying it on the chair. Their entanglement of hands and mouths continued as they found that familiar comforting rhythm. Dean knew it was Cas, he had no doubts now. He didn't care how Cas had come back or who he owed for his only prayer to have been answered. He had the love of his life back in his arms, and it wasn't a dream.
Dean and Cas were now walking up to the bunker. Grins on both their faces Dean hesitated for a moment in an awkward feeling of "this is what couples do, but I've never been in a healthy relationship my entire life moment" and then reached for Cas's hand. He was not going to let his inner failings and hate traps he's always set for himself get in the way of this. He wanted every annoying, frilly, frustrating, and joyous moment that has escaped him in the past.
Castiel left Jack when they had finally discussed as much as they could in one night. His heart was full at seeing how well Jack was doing. He couldn’t have hoped for a better outcome, but Jack wasn’t the only one he needed to talk to that night. He walked through the kitchen and saw the whiskey bottle on the counter. He smirked lifting the bottle to his nose. He didn't drink often, it was more of a social activity to him. It took a lot for angels to get drunk and no one had the money for that.
Dean threw his arms around Cas almost knocking him over. They were chuckling with joy not wanting to pull away from each other.
Dean was sitting on his bed looking up from his laptop as Cas entered. He closed the computer quickly and put it on the desk in a fluid motion that left Cas remembering many other smooth fluid movements he had, had with this man.
"Yes, it reminds me of the spice markets in Jerusalem."
"Stop it, don't try that. No more selfless flogging. We do this together." Dean was never gonna let Cas leave again. Too many times in their past Cas would disappear, they would have a squabble and it could be months with no word. The thought of that happening now made his stomach hurt.
Sam's smug look turned into a giant grin as he looked over to Cas.
Eileen came bursting out through the door to see Dean and Cas down the hill in a tight embrace. Grinning she looked over to Sam who had the most coy smile.
"Oh, no I mean the kid has so much to take care of." He lied, he had asked once. The night they got home from their victory and he didn't find Cas in the bunker. He didn't want to admit that he had tried and Jack hadn't answered his prayer, his desperate plea.
“Well, he...he won’t look the way you would expect. You’ve not been gone long enough for him to look as old as he does.” Sam tried to explain with hand gestures as he talked, which of course were lost to Cas as he was sitting in the back.
A dim light covers the room in an intimate tone. Sound off, the place is froze in time.
“Yeah, just tired” Dean smiles for a second. “I think I’ll head to sleep too.”
Dean’s sitting in front of the table, his gaze rests over the names carved on the wood he was leaning on, specifically Castiel’s.
Rowena, as soon as Sam’s lips touched Eileen’s, she muttered a few words barely hearable for the brothers, here eyes turning purple.
“Memories?” Sam was losing it. “Did you take his grace?... Jack, what the hell is going on?” he insisted.
The memory of Castiel’s words came to Dean, “
“It’s just gonna be for a
“Quiet!” The shadow, edgy, screamed again and again, losing the little control it has left.
Eileen wanted to set the mood lighter. So, a bit surprised nobody notices already, she clears her throat stretching one hand over the table.
Sam covered his eyes with his free arm and shoots the door fast, shaking his head trying to erase what he just saw.
Sam grabs his brother into a comfort hug, he needs it, and so does Sam.
“You think that no one will noticed your gone and that’s just...” He’s beyond emotional. “that’s not true, Cas.”
“A classic” The brothers said at unison.
“Keep an eye on him, would you?”
The boys turned in alarm. Jack’s standing outside the room as he walks in from the door.
His voice soften. “I can’t Sam..."
He looks at his brother, arching.
The pain he has been feeling since he was taken is gone. He slowly flickers confused. He feels it, someone’s calling him. Castiel tries to stand but fails. He heard the voice again, as he finds the strength to stand.
“Take care little brother.”
“And don’t be strangers boys. I’m a profane spell away”.
A dark mass, coming from the shadow, made its way to Jack, in an attempt of consuming him but couldn’t.
“Man, I don’t get it either, but he loves them so...”
He tried to recover fully, but still looking impressed.
Eileen instead of laughing she feels heartwarming and answers with a thank you, as she hugs him one more time. Dean feels a bit blushed.
“...There are rules that even the empty can’t ignore” She paused “Humans can’t stay there”
Rowena nods, taking another shot of her whisky.
“Why not? Maybe we--"
“Still on hell? No dear, he left shortly after, I have no idea what he’s up to”
Putting aside Dean's mess, they start cooking together, goofing around. Time slowly passes, with both just owning these moments as if they had never been apart, as if they’ll never be apart again.
Dean and Castiel looks confused, sharing a look, then Dean notices.
Sam frowned, offended but smiles at Eileen, now walking his way, smiling back.
Dean gets closer, a few inches away from Castiel.
“I’m gonna miss you Dean”
From the back, Sam sneaked, spotting his brother pass drunk. “Dean?”
bond is needed”
BUNKER. DUNGEON. CONTINUOUS.
Dean sees him, standing, Castiel is there, a few steps apart. He tries to stand near the portal, fighting back the impulse of energy coming from it. A few steps at a time till he reach it.
“Dean, you just said: how you puke” Sam pointed, laughing a little.
Into the nothingness, a scream made it through. There was something else, now he could hear a voice coming like a distance echo.
“Enough!” The shadow screamed, and in that second, Dean woke up heavy breathing. Next to him, Miracle rushed its way to be in the space between his arms, trying to conceal him.
“No, we didn't”
Dean stands up to get the box he and Cas bring out of the fridge. He puts it in the center of the table and opens it.
“Feel stuck?” Sam sad-eyed. He understands.
Eileen sets closer to Sam, she comforts him by hugging and taking him by the waist in an intimate embrace.
“Well at first, I was slightly--” She stretched her voice at the ending. “--worried he might want a staff change. You know, with the new management who knows who will survive the cut.”
Dean lights up the candle and the rest gather closer.
Dean, from behind, was standing a bit shocked, but smiling warmly at the sight.
“Sure” he looks confused but didn’t ask further. “I’ll just stay in the next room”
“Amara? How...”
They all smiled in excitement.
“Well, that was the idea, but...” Rowena struggled admitting her words. “Magic isn’t always perfect Samuel, painful is to say it”
“We’ll make sure he stays asleep till it’s time for him to be free, you do that, and you will never have to worry about him anymore, deal?”
“He’s mine” the shadow stands slowly. “we’re having so much fun together”
The brothers smiles briefly.
Just as the shadow was about to free him, Castiel, for unknown reasons, woke up with an inner scream.
“So, what with all the dismiss crap?” Dean insisted.
Castiel smiles, he always secretly loved when Dean worried about him.
The boys nodded in understanding.
Looking confused, Sam frowned.
He sets off but is still by Dean’s side letting him to say goodbye.
“Cut the drama, this isn’t a goodbye. I’m a phone call away if you need me.”
Jack lanes, putting the few strings of hair in his forehead aside, smiles as he plays gently with Castiel’s hair.
“Screw you jerk.”
“The hell is a demon doing here?”
“He came right after Chuck’s tantrum with a special delivery. Apparently, the new dashing God, caught the old one trying to gain some mojo”
“Don’t mention it Samuel” She smiles back a bit blushed. “But do me a favor and stop dying would ‘ya? Is getting harder to look for ways to bring the Winchesters back”
“A fallen angel, falling for selfless, true love, can turn his grace into something else, even before the empty took him, my father's grace was fading, only that it wasn't really fading, it changed within him and that's how your bound was able to reach him, even in the empty ”
Castiel, eyes closed, overheard someone familiar, the voice he knows so well, calling him over and over again as he wakes up slowly.
“It’s time”
He opens the door in one fast move “Dean what’s... Oh my god!”
“Hello boys”
“Yeah?” She bites her lower lip, amused “we shall see”.
Music’s abruptly off.
“You made it?” Eileen asked impressed.
He was the first in line to say goodbye to Eileen and Sam. Cas smiles at both, first he hugs Eileen and although they never had the proper chance to bond, they smiled at the possibilities to come from now on.
“What you’re feeling...I mean, if you love him...” Sam struggles, trying to find the right words.
At the touch, a blast of light went through the room. Sending the three of them away into the walls again.
“And you need the carbs? Smart” Sam interrupts his brother, landing at him a complicity look, eyebrows raising repeatedly.
A single tear made its way down Dean’s face, till others followed the first one, till he couldn’t stop.
Castiel understands the internal fear Dean has, hell, he’s afraid as well. But they’re not stopping now. He slowly puts both of his hands-on Dean’s cheeks.
“It’s great to see you all too.” Jack’s now more excited.
They stayed like that for a countless time because they both knew this was, in several ways, a goodbye, whether they admit it or not.
She throws at Dean a “defying” look.
“It’s okay, it doesn’t-- hurt"
“What are you doing?” Jack, alarmed, approaches Amara.
“I know, me too.” Sam reassures him.
“Yeah,
“We even set up a mini stage and there’s a Karaoke Friday Special” Castiel seems excited. “I make the nachos, and sometimes I even make tacos.” He winks to Sam and Eileen.
“Dean, you know that’s not--“
“We didn’t took his grace” he said softly. “All he is, all he was, is still inside him”
“Cas? Is...” Dean’s still sleepy. “are you okay?”
Dean starts the engine on, baby’s roaring louder as the up-funk bit of the song gets higher. He is feeling his own now, full smile, he adjusts the rearview and spots his brother holding Eileen but, strangely, he doesn’t feel blue. For the first time he feels he’s going in the right direction, even if he doesn’t know where that is.
“Always.”
Suddenly Dean steps back abruptly, losing his brother’s grip.
As Jack walks to the door, he gives a last gaze to his family and smiles, and with that.
“Is everything alright? I’ve been trying to reach you”
From behind, Castiel enters the scene, fully charging a box with a few jars, trying to hold Miracle but failing. The dog runs straight to Sam.
The room is in complete silence, the boys almost frightened to breathe as the light on his shoulder turns off slowly and the full mark starts to
Sam gets it, more than that, he feels it. His brother has gone through hell, literally in fact. Never a single break, even growing up, ever since their mother died.
, is glowing.
“I can’t take it Sammy... I just can’t” He started to shake into the admission “I love him, I love him so damn much”
Barking, Miracle comes from behind, rushing into Dean arms.
Dean took a deep breath. Going through this conversation, it would make it real and that just terrifies him.
Dean stands again, confronting his brother.
And so, they hit the road. This insane road that made them feel all kinds of experiences and memories of that came to scene.
“What are we gonna do?” Jack looked at her worried.
Dean froze, he wanted this for so long that he was scared of screwing things up as he usually blames himself.
“What’s happening?”
Sam notices as he walks in.
Castiel notice. “Are you okay?”
The place seems oddly different into Sam’s eyes. The room is pretty much the same, the light hasn’t change and every book is in its place, but something’s off, something doesn’t feel right.
All his life was hunting, pain and loss. Feeling nothing but the responsibilities of others as it they were his own, and now, now that everything’s gone, he can actually have a shot to live his own life.
-“ Rowena blushed. “such a flirty boy” She eye dreamed at the memory.
“Oh, don’t you worry boys, he’s been handled. The little lad realized the danger he was and asked me to take good care of him”
Jack took full control of his body again, smiling at the sight of his father.
“Why are you telling us this Jack?” Dean spoke, unable to keep hearing what he already knew Castiel was... what Castiel still is.
His heart sank heavily at the sound, it was a song from the mixtape Dean made for Castiel, one of the “Dean’s top 13 Zepp Traxx”.
Dean softly nods, avoiding eye contact with his brother.
As they were about to light off the candle, it turned itself off. Surprised, the gag turned to each other when a voice echoed.
Sam gets that humor is emotional getaway to his brother, so he went along, smiling
“Then how...?” Sam asked, confronting her as he realizes the only way, he knew Angels can turn to humans. “Did you took his grace?”
Little by little, he reduces the distances between the two.
“Damn it Cas! I’m asking if I could stay here
Jack nodes.
Apron on, Dean’s cooking and suggestively dancing, as he makes scramble eggs, bacon, some coffee and finally, a stack of PB and J sandwiches.
As a proof of its power, an infinite amount of shadows appeared, coming from the underneath them, surrounding Jack from every direction.
Slowly, his hand reached Eileen’s forehead, moving carefully the strings of hair in it as she closed her eyes.
“Then why do I feel so broken?”
Sam looked at his brother, dead serious, but Dean’s attention is still on Castiel.
“Well not to brag but I’m a hell out of a kisser” Dean told proudly.
“What the hell just happened?”
Dean stands and walks the few inches into his brother’s side, till they’re face to face.
“Get this” Dean shakes his arms, trying to prepare what he was about to do “How - are – you”
“Hey Sammy” He sees the look in his brother’s eyes. Dean hands him a beer. “are you alright?”
“What’s up with the beard? Where is Cas?” Sam looks around, searching.
“No, stop. We are going to drive in silence until we get there. If it’s not Cas we’ll deal with it then. If it is him...” Dean felt his voice choke, so he hid it by clearing his throat. “If it is him, then we have a win. And we’ll beat down all this shit that’s been happening. Maybe death was wrong.”
“No, that’s good. I can do that. I’ll just go take that shower.”
"We can still roadtrip Dean. We just won't be hunting. Jack seems to have taken care of all that now."
When they pulled away from the kiss their foreheads rested against each other. "You taste like coffee, is that how you've always tasted?" Cas asked quizzically.
