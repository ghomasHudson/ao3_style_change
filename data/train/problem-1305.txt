Feeling bold, he pulls back slightly from the kiss so he can bite at John’s bottom lip, rubbing hard against John’s nipples as he does so, savoring the desperate sound it pulls from John, the involuntary press of his hips forward into Sherlock’s.
John’s lips are warm, the taste of his mouth against Sherlock’s as sweet as the first drink of water to a man dying of thirst.
In his rage, Sherlock has turned his eyes back to John’s. He sees John’s face filling once again with surprise at his words.
Sherlock is delighted to find John’s body responding just as eagerly to the knowledge that neither of them are wearing any clothing, and as John pulls Sherlock’s hips in against his own, Sherlock feels the unmistakable heat of John’s erection.
But Sherlock wasn’t a reasonable person, and shutting doors without slamming them wasn’t something he typically did, especially after coming home from a case. Of course, there was a range of different door slams—from triumphant to enraged—but this quiet, polite method was completely out of character.
He tilted his head to the side as Sherlock’s mouth worked its way down his neck, sucking and biting softly. John made a helpless sound that he would have been embarrassed about had he been in his right mind. Instead, John made the sound again. He could have sworn he felt Sherlock grin against him.
Under his hand, he bites his lip, hard, forcing his mind away from thoughts of the other detestable passengers and back to the memory of John’s hands on him, so strong and so warm, guiding him.
He can see a cluster of ramshackle buildings up ahead that mark the beginnings of the town, toward which their small group is now heading, and where, he imagines the other members of the
Opening his eyes, he catches John watching him from where he’s standing at the front of the crowd, and feels a different kind of heat entirely fill him at what he sees in John’s gaze.
John deliberates for a moment about how long he’s willing to draw this out. He decides he doesn’t have the patience. “He’s not dead. He’s been coming to the house at night and drugging me in my sleep.”
Despite his disappointment over the fact that the alleged party this evening will not include John, Sherlock has been unable to shake the disagreement between Mr. Knott and Mr. Ferguson from his mind, and he is curious to see for himself whether the party will take place, and if so, how the captain will behave if he decides to make an appearance.
Sherlock lifts his hips ever so slightly so John can feel the full length of him, where he is straining hard against the soft fabric of his breeches.
He’s across the room, dragging the case back out of the way before he can think whether it’s a good idea to do so, and even if it isn’t, at the sight of John’s tarnished blonde head emerging from the mildewed shadows, his heart gives a leap of pure relief.
He rubs his thumb over the head of it, the way John always does, and has to push his arm up above his face to stifle his whimper at the thought.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say. He can scarcely believe his own ears—much less determine how on earth he can find the courage to tell John that he feels the same way.
“I’m not teasing you. I really mean it. I’ve seen you watching me work. And I know that look, like your skull might crack if someone doesn’t give you something to keep your hands busy with. I can show you if you like, help you keep yourself occupied.”
Sherlock watches the irritation on the man’s face war with his resignation. “What’s the nature of the offense?”
John laughs in response to Sherlock’s request, pushing at the obstinate piece of hair that’s determined to cover Sherlock’s eye with a fondness that makes Sherlock’s chest flood with sudden warmth.
Sherlock looks back at him, picking out the flecks of color in John’s irises. Today they are the color of the sky in a storm. Sherlock wishes he could get lost in them and never come out. He watches a furrow appear between John’s brows.
There is a moment’s hesitation and then he takes it, wordlessly, his expression shifting to one of gratitude as he begins to dab at his swollen lip.
He fell hard against the wall of the shower, shuddering, wiping the tears from his eyes with the heel of his hand. He told himself the tears were simply the result of the stress of the last twenty-four hours, and the fact that he hadn’t masturbated since the night he’d arrived back from New Zealand.
The stunned look on his face must have been quite extraordinary because Sherlock suddenly seemed to grow self-conscious. He pulled his hand out of the water, and dropped his eyes, apologetic.
Sherlock bids the Colonel farewell. Watching him make his way toward the staircase to the upper decks, Sherlock makes up his mind.
John’s answer is a sigh of heat against Sherlock’s lips and then John’s mouth is sliding in against his and Sherlock parts his lips in a gasp of pleasure as John’s hands settle in his hair.
John is pulling the other hand from Sherlock’s eyes and kissing the knuckles, pressing his lips to the curve on the inside of Sherlock’s fingers, to the heel of his palm, the inside of his wrist.
Sherlock feels the warmth starting somewhere in the base of his spine. It travels up into his belly—up, up, and then down the lengths of his arms until he feels it blooming in his hands, singing along the half-healed cut on his palm, making the tips of his fingers, raw from playing earlier, tingle pleasantly with warmth, until he’s going soft with the sensation of all that warmth, as if some of John’s golden light has been siphoned directly into his veins and now he’s melting, his body unable to withstand its force, dissolving into one bright shimmer of heat.
John heard Sherlock’s voice hitch and he reached down to push his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, offering comfort.
Sherlock is nodding, too relieved to pay attention to the steadiness of John’s gaze. “I think whoever it was that poisoned him was counting on the fact that it would go unnoticed because of the party. I think they imagined everyone else would simply think the man was drunk.”
John’s flesh is hard and hot under Sherlock’s hand, but also, soft, so soft, like living silk. Sherlock can feel John’s pulse along the length of him, can feel every vein, every ridge of flesh, and he is breathing hard now, so hard he almost cannot catch his breath.
But Ferguson’s motivations are not so obvious. The only reason for him to lie low as far as Sherlock can tell is because he’s plotting something. The last words Sherlock heard him say to Knott were that he wasn’t giving up on his plan to blackmail the captain. Perhaps it would be worth taking a stroll past his cabin later to see if he can ascertain anything of interest…
Sherlock is hot, so hot, the want in his belly trembling and twisting like a living thing. He knows what he needs—it’s what he’s needed all along, but hasn’t had the courage to voice aloud.
He was still sitting on Sherlock’s legs, effectively pinning Sherlock to the bed beneath him, and although he liked the added element of control this gave him, it meant he didn’t have access to as much as Sherlock as he wanted, so he lifted his weight off of Sherlock’s legs, sliding his fingers in between Sherlock’s knees to push them apart.
He’s panting around the words now, his hips finding a steady rhythm, and Sherlock relaxes the muscles of his throat, tilting his head back to give John easier access as he thrusts, delighting in the clench of John’s buttocks under his fingers, the little hitch in his breathing as Sherlock takes him slightly deeper, feeling the head of John’s cock hit the back of his throat.
Sherlock steps back to let him go, but at the sound of that horrible bell, at the immediate physical reaction it provokes in John, he feels the inferno of rage inside himself harden into a fury like nothing he has ever known, a fury so intense it feels as though it will burn him from the inside out.
Then with a sudden violent movement, he turns and slams his fist into the wall above the porthole, making Sherlock jump.
“Wrong.” Through the haze of pain John hears Sherlock’s voice as clearly as though he were standing in the room behind him. “Poetic justice would be me breaking every bone in your body and then pulling your organs out through your mouth, one by one, saving your heart for last so that you die, slowly, drowning in your own blood. Honestly, does no one read Dante anymore?”
Sherlock turns, fury stark in every line of his face. This time he really is going to punch Anderson, right in the mouth. He drops his weight back on his right foot like John taught him, pulls back his fist.
Somehow the cut of the material made available all the qualities of Sherlock’s long, elegant frame that were normally masked by fabric.
And after, how Sherlock tried to tell John what he means to him, slurring, desperate, his thighs clenching hard around John’s waist, lips slipping over his throat, hand working the length of him as though he could draw the life out of him up to the surface through the grip on his hand—god, the things he said.
“Sherlock…” John’s voice is gentle but matter-of-fact, as though trying to talk Sherlock back from some wild pursuit, which Sherlock realizes, is precisely what he’s doing. “What you’re suggesting—it… that’s treason. The pair of us could be hung simply for having this conversation.”
Sherlock obediently looped his arms around John’s neck. Sherlock’s skin was cold where it touched John’s. John could feel his breathing, quick and shallow against the front of his chest. “I can’t believe you’re carrying me.”
If he has to choose between madness and giving up on Sherlock, John will choose madness, every time.
“But sir! It isn’t possible. We cannot finish restocking our stores in that amount of time. And with the
It is well past noon when Sherlock exits the dining room, and the heat below decks has reached an almost unbearable capacity. As he moves through the dark and airless corridors of the lower deck, Sherlock feels the full weight of the mid-afternoon heat suddenly make itself known to him.
“I came to ask if you’d like to venture up on deck, get a bit of fresh air before nightfall. It’s a gorgeous evening, and I’d be happy to accompany you. That is,” he goes on to add, “In case the stairs prove too much.”
Sherlock lets his head fall back to the sand with an inarticulate sound, and John laughs softly before rolling off Sherlock to alleviate the pressure on his now overly sensitive cock.
John pushes the last button free and Sherlock holds himself very still, eyes still shut. He can feel John’s breath—warm and unsteady against his cheek.
But just as quickly, John seems to grow self-conscious again, his smile vanishing from his lips. “Only if that pleases you, of course. To try it like that.”
To make matters worse, Sherlock sees Lieutenant Deverall striding up the beach behind the men, his gait as strong and confident as ever. Never has the man looked more casually elegant and at home in his surroundings. Instead of making his appearance more ragged and disheveled, as Sherlock is certain he looks after their brief journey to shore, the salt spray appears to have sculpted his dark locks into perfectly tumbled curls. The waters of the bay at his back, the wind pulling at the gold braid on his coat, the splash of the waves around his boots—all the details of the landscape around him somehow lend a dashing, noble air to his appearance that makes him look as though he strode right out of a painting by Girodet.
. “Hey Sherlock, fancy a shag?” John liked to think of himself as a fairly accomplished sexual partner—he knew that communication was at the basis of any successful interaction, sexual or otherwise, but somehow his communication skills just seemed to fall apart when it came to Sherlock.
“It’s fine. I have plenty of other things in mind to keep us occupied while we’re here. Don’t you worry.”
cheating on you with her aerobics instructor, I’m sorry to say. But you knew that really, didn’t you? Deep down.”
It’s as if a wave has pulled him under. All Sherlock can hear for several long seconds is the roar of his own heartbeat in his ears.
But then the wind changes, dispelling the wreaths of silvery smoke, and Sherlock sees that it is Burns; a clay pipe clenched tight in his blackening teeth, and relief courses through Sherlock, swift and immediate.
It’s far too risky, far too stupid to go on meeting when it’s blatantly against the rules onboard the ship; when there’s—not just one—but what feels like a legion of people against them, just waiting to catch them out.
There are so many different emotions in John’s voice; Sherlock is desperate to try and decipher each one—sorrow, astonishment, fondness; regret.
“You want your shoulders to be in line with your hips.” John’s strong hands move down Sherlock’s back to settle just below his ribs. Sherlock feels a shiver run through him at the movement like a bolt of lightning down a metal rod. “People think the power comes from the swing and some of it does, but most of it comes from here. You want to roll your hips as you throw the punch. This will help you keep your balance. But you’ve got to relax. Let the tension out of your shoulders.”
is better than the situation he’s in now, with nothing but the seed of his worry to keep him company, growing every moment into a darker, more tangled manifestation of his terror until it feels as if there’s no oxygen left in the crowded room, as though Sherlock is being crushed beneath the force of the thick, choking branches.
John gazed up at Sherlock from where his head was resting against Sherlock’s shoulder. His eyes were dreamy, unfocused. He smiled up at Sherlock fondly.
He’s about to retire to his quarters to escape the heat of the noon sun, when Sherlock notices a crowd of passengers gathered nearby, staring up at the top of the main mast, tittering nervously and pointing. He follows the line of their eyes and there, climbing his way down the masthead with a bucket in one hand and a brush in the other, is John.
“The usual rules pertain. If you do not return to the ship in your allotted time, your pay will be docked accordingly—one day’s pay for each hour’s absence. I expect you to complete your work in the next twenty-four hours as carefully and efficiently as possible. The other lieutenants and I will be watching you closely to ensure that you do. Now, see to your officers for your duties!”
Sherlock is just beginning to think Ferguson will ignore his question completely when he replies, words lost in a cloud of smoke.
John’s breath leaves him in a rush, his own fingers momentarily falling still as Sherlock’s fingers press in against his own.
John must read some of what Sherlock is feeling in his face because Sherlock watches John’s look soften further as he holds Sherlock’s gaze. John’s hand slides back into Sherlock’s curls, the gesture so full of feeling that Sherlock has to shut his eyes.
“Alright, alright, I’ll play one more. Although I don’t know so many songs for the guitar… Let me think a minute.”
Sherlock’s eyes crawl over the space of his narrow grey cabin in desperation, noticing for the first time how filthy the room is, the articles of clothing strewn about, the shattered fragments from the glass he’d thrown against the wall and never bothered to pick up.
And then Sherlock’s body is arching hard off the bed, head tipped back, hand tightening around the base of his cock as he comes, the finger of his other hand biting crescent moons into the soft skin of his upper thigh.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “You started singing ‘Blow the Man Down.’ Quite enthusiastically I might add.” He paused and then added as an afterthought, “Let it never be said that you don’t have a lovely singing voice.”
“Well, there’s been a change,” snaps Anderson. “I’ve just had a conversation with the Captain, and he has put me in charge of your mess. Any complaints you might have about this decision may be given directly to the Captain.”
“After the storm, the captain ordered everyone up on deck to take an inventory. Most of the passengers were badly shaken, but no one was hurt, thank god. The only person unaccounted for was you. When I asked around, they said when they’d knocked on your door you didn’t answer. Apparently no one could be bothered to open the door to see why.” John’s voice takes on an edge of darkness Sherlock has seldom heard before. “I asked when last they’d seen you and when it became evident no one had seen you since before the storm, I worried some misfortune had befallen you. I had the steward show me to your room. When I knocked and received no answer, I went straight in, only to find you on the brink of death for a completely different reason.”
The sea is calm and flat today so the movement of the ship is minimal but even so, to see a man walk with such perfect ease on such a slender piece of wood with no trouble, all the way out to the edge of the ship’s vast girth, as though he means to keep right on going out into the sky—it takes Sherlock’s breath away. How John keeps his balance is impossible to understand.
It’s like an arrow pointing to Ferguson’s class, his boasting about the wealth of his clients. People from Sherlock’s background never spoke about anything so crass as
“I didn’t say anything to him!” Sherlock snaps, still struggling ineffectually to twist free of Ferguson’s grip. “A fact, which you should not only be grateful for, but which should have been obvious to you—based on the fact that you’re still alive!”
He tries not to think too hard about how he’s also washing off the unwelcome touch of Steven’s hands on his shoulders—around his throat—and finds himself wishing for one impossible moment that he could somehow scrub away the faint bruises that still linger on the skin of his neck so that he could erase every trace of the incident.
Every passenger gets a portion of fresh water to wash with every morning; but the cold water that Sherlock splashes on his hands and face before breakfast just isn’t the same. And it’s been so oppressively hot that Sherlock feels stickier and filthier than he’s felt in days.
“You have a lovely singing voice, Mr. Watson. I do hope we get the chance to hear you sing again sometime.”
Sherlock, whose eyes were unfocused, smirked up at John. “Using my vulnerability to take advantage of me, Doctor? I never thought you had it in you.”
His mind explodes into panic. He has no recollection of time or place. Where is he? How much time has passed since he went to sleep? He gropes for the bedside table and switches on the light. Some of his panic recedes as he recognizes his bedroom at 221B—and then all at once memories rush him from the night before, fractured and bizarre, shocking him like a burst of ice-cold water.
He straightened up and felt his body protest as he did so, all the muscles that had taken a beating over the last twenty-four hours announcing their discomfort at once. The sudden need to be immersed in hot water momentarily drowned out all his other concerns.
His heart is pounding hard in the column of his throat, his cheeks burning with the force of his disappointment in himself.
I want to dedicate this story to three very important people who helped me along the way. My dear friend,
Sherlock was wrong about Moriarty. He hadn’t underestimated them. He understood the situation precisely. He’d known from the very beginning that they were stronger together. And it was for that reason that he’d worked so hard to drive them apart.
He stares hard at the bright spot of John’s head in the darkness, willing him to look up so that he might catch Sherlock’s gaze.
Being in John’s presence—and yet so far from it—reminds Sherlock of everything he misses about John, so that the longing that had settled to a dull ache within him feels as though it’s been torn open again, like a wound that was partially healed.
Sherlock scarcely has the breath to speak. It feels as though his heart has swollen to such a size that it’s crushing all the air from his lungs, pressing against his ribs, but if he knows one thing, it’s that it has never been more important than it is right now for him to try and communicate to John just what he means to Sherlock.
He falls to his knees beside his bed, groping in the darkness until his hands find the contours of the case, easing loose the straps and drawing it towards him with infinite tenderness.
This room is smaller than the main room—it’s a sort of annex, but it’s mercifully less crowded, with fewer tables and chairs, most of which are arranged against the walls. There’s some open space in the center of the room where people are standing, and there, directly opposite Sherlock, is a trio of musicians, just warming up their instruments.
Sherlock reached down, wrapping the long fingers of his free hand around John’s erection. John gasped in response. Sherlock’s fingers, still slick with lube, felt lovely and cool against his aching flesh. They began to stroke and John felt the small light of his pleasure begin to grow brighter again.
He grits his teeth, stomach roiling with self-hatred. For one wild, irrational moment, he wishes he could go back in time and change it, scrub out the names he’d written on the page, so clearly implicating him and John, so thoroughly damning them if discovered.
His instrument has more strings than a violin as well—Sherlock peers closer and sees that he’s only actually playing four of the many strings—the others appear to be situated underneath and his bow does not touch them. They must be responsible for the extra resonant quality of the sound.
He lets the material fall to the ground and then his mouth is back at Sherlock’s throat, warm in the dip between his collarbones, before sliding down—just the slightest hint of teeth as he drags the fabric away from Sherlock’s chest to mouth at one nipple, making Sherlock gasp and bite his lip—his other hand tugging apart the fastenings on Sherlock’s trousers, knuckles brushing the bare heat of Sherlock’s erection teasingly, once, before he lifts his hand away.
The air is heavy with the scent of sweat and old liquor, but rising above that is also a pleasant savory golden smell, of food cooked with unfamiliar spices. The scent of it makes Sherlock’s mouth water and he remembers, smelling it, that he’s skipped far too many meals in the past twenty-four hours.
He should have known better. The man doesn’t like Sherlock—he never has—and he should have guessed from the way his sly, sloping face twisted up in obvious dislike at Sherlock’s approach that the man wouldn’t deign to give him the time of day much less grant him a favor.
He should respect the tension in John’s body, all the warning signs that tell him not to touch, but he cannot stop himself from reaching out and taking hold of John’s wrist so that he might look at one of his hands.
John took another sip of his champagne, willing his eyes away from the movement of Sherlock’s throat as he swallowed.
Sherlock shifts his hands around to hold John by the hips, smoothing his thumbs over the twin curves in a distracted gesture.
Despite the fact that the flat was a disaster, the kitchen was in disarray, and Sherlock was clearly as mad and disaffected as ever, John found he was happy to be back. It wasn’t just the dysfunction of the last two weeks with Sarah; he realized his life felt off-kilter without Sherlock’s strange, disruptive presence. He hadn’t really felt like himself. Even when faced with the overwhelming prospect of being thrown back into the fire of his newfound attraction, he felt happier than he had in days.
It was a good thing the shock of the cold water had revived John from his swoon as Sherlock inadvertently swallowed a great deal of filthy water when he opened his mouth, and the fit of coughing that ensued prevented him from effectively pulling John to safety.
The shame he feels at this admission is so great Sherlock wants to curl up into a ball and hide his face. He
“Oh no, you don’t.” John climbed over Sherlock’s legs, settling himself down to sit on the backs of Sherlock’s thighs. “You’re staying right here.”
He dresses well, almost too well for someone of his background, with a self-consciousness that leads Sherlock to believe he comes from one of those families that has only recently pulled itself out of poverty in the last few generations.
“Cleaned up?” Sherlock wraps his legs around John’s waist to keep him in place, brushing his closed lips against the edge of John’s jaw. “What for?”
of the customs of polite society; it’s simply that he doesn’t care to abide by them. Thanks to his upbringing, he is intimately aware of all of them, all of the stupid codes and rules that dictate proper behavior, even if he may be hideously out of practice.
“Easy now,” he says, guiding Sherlock over to the railing where he can hold on and look out over the sea.
Sherlock lay back. He looked irritated but it was clear he was getting exhausted. He shut his eyes. “I hope this isn’t how you treat all your patients. You have a terrible bedside manner.”
Sometimes, he wishes he were an artist, so he could try and capture John’s beauty with pen and ink or paint, to give expression to the feelings he has for this man that are so powerful he feels half the time that his own fragile body cannot contain them.
The ghosts are motionless, the only movement the occasional ocean current that lifts their hair in strange haloes behind their heads.
“I can still hear you, you know,” Sherlock said but his eyes were closed. His forehead was drenched in sweat. John could feel his grip around John’s neck weakening.
that John’s feelings for him are real, his memory of the dream makes him question, fills him with doubt.
He heard the rasp of Sherlock’s breathing, felt the pliancy of his body as he let John direct him, and once again was struck by the marvel of this soft, vulnerable Sherlock, willing to be led, to be maneuvered by John.
By the time he’s come to stand by Burns’ side, the other man's face has settled back into its normally impassive expression, but Sherlock can’t forget his look of startled disbelief that Sherlock would dare to come up on deck so soon after Anderson’s reprimand.
John seats himself on the edge of Sherlock’s bunk and reaches out to take Sherlock’s wrist, feeling for his pulse.
“Yes,” Sherlock hissed as John’s mouth traveled up the length of Sherlock’s cock without touching it, so near—but not touching—his hands settling over Sherlock’s hips, thumbs stroking the twin grooves of his pelvis as his mouth reached the tip, still so close but not touching.
John seized the opportunity to pull Sherlock down against him, and then locking his legs around Sherlock’s back, he flipped their positions and rolled off of Sherlock. He crawled several paces away and rose to his knees, where he looked at Sherlock with a challenge in his eyes.
His heart is pounding—he feels light-headed with the intensity of his desire, like he might fall off the earth if he doesn’t keep a grip on the feeling, as though if he surrenders to it, he will be washed away.
Because John is patient and beautiful and good—and essentially a god in human form—he waits several long minutes for Sherlock to catch his breath and does not stir until Sherlock lifts his flushed face from John’s neck to reach down between them and take the hot, slippery length of his still very hard cock in his hand.
“We are not all of us creatures of the deep, content to live forever in the ocean’s embrace… I, for one, now have sand in places I didn’t previously know existed…”
He dreams that Billy leaves, distraught, and Burns comes to take his place, his weather-roughened features set into a mask of stone.
Sherlock is desperate to ask John about it—to know more about this younger, carefree John and all the events that have made him into the man he is today. The conversation brought to light how little he actually knows about John’s past.
The only dent in Sherlock’s pleasure comes from the knowledge that two men down the line, on the other side of Ironsides Jake, looms the dark and unsettling presence of the scowling sailor with the bruise on his face, the one Sherlock is certain felt the effects of John’s fists the other night after talking about Sherlock.
“When will I see you again?” he blurts, so panicked he forgets to feel self-conscious about the question.
Thank goodness for the heavy wool of John’s own overcoat. It did an excellent job hiding John’s growing discomfort, which he was sure would otherwise prove quite visible.
“It nearly ruined me.” Sherlock drew a shallow breath, his head on John’s chest. “Keeping myself from you.”
But in glancing away, his eyes light on Deverall, who is standing and watching from the other side of the deck.
“It doesn’t seem right.” There is something sorrowful in John’s voice as he goes on speaking. “Me sticking my hand down your trousers in the filthy, rat-infested darkness. You deserve better than this.”
Moriarty’s grip beneath John’s jaw was making fresh blood run from the cut on his neck. He watched out of one eye as Moriarty studied the wound. “I imagine Sherlock wasn’t pleased at all when he saw this.” He dragged his thumb over the incision. “He so
Hearing it from Stamford makes the pain of it all the more vivid—his descriptions of John as a carefree youth—all of his illusions shattered by the war and Mary’s loss. The darkness of losing her—it makes sense based on what Sherlock knows of John. John has told Sherlock as much himself—that Mary had been more of a dream to John than a reality. But privately, Sherlock agrees with Stamford. How else could John have coped with the reality of losing his first love?
Sherlock pushes his chin forward so that his bottom lip just brushes John’s, sending a shiver down his spine, causing John’s fingers to press in with a hiss against him, hips shifting forward again to drag their erections together.
With something like relief, Sherlock recognizes Matthews, Patterson, Burns, Half-Pint Lee, Ironsides Jake, Stapleton, and Banana Bill.
There are ripples in Sherlock's mind—waves of white. Light and music curl around one another within him until he cannot tell one from the other—light and music, music and light. His hand must have started moving again because he can feel John's fingers tightening in his curls.
John is straightening up over him, and Sherlock arches his body forward like a bow, pressing the weight of his erection against John’s hip.
There is a group of passengers on the other side of the deck, enjoying the evening air, but they are standing far enough away that Sherlock cannot make out the individual words of their conversation, and it is easy to imagine the low murmur of their voices is just the sound of the wind.
In fact, Sherlock is so engrossed in his assessment of the assembled crowd that it takes him a moment to notice John standing at his elbow, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder.
Oh, how he had hated Mycroft in that moment. How useless were those words to him then, when it was too late?
Stumbling, disoriented, he failed to anticipate the blow aimed at his head. It caught him on the brow bone and this time, it knocked him off his feet.
“Certainly not, Mr. Bailey!” Ms. Grimsby snaps at the awkward young barrister. “Madras is a post controlled and operated by the British Empire. The seedy shores of Rio de Janeiro are quite another matter.”
Sherlock, perhaps sensing John’s stillness, redoubled his efforts; stroking John’s cock in sharp, brutal bursts, leaning into catch John’s bottom lip between his teeth.
John is like morphine. The steady drip of his presence into Sherlock’s veins makes time immaterial; from where he stands in the corner the night seems to pass in a heartbeat and before he realizes it, there is light leaking in through the gap in the curtains.
“Come back! Come back.” He’s falling to his knees, shaking, yelling at the top of his lungs. “Godammit, Sherlock! I know you’re there. Come back, you
“Sometimes I’m half afraid I dreamed you up, that I’m going to wake one day to discover this was all just one long lovely dream… that none of it was real, because how could it be?”
“I don’t know, my love. Maybe.” He can hear the regret in John’s voice that he cannot give a more reassuring answer. “It all depends if the men are willing to keep watch again, like they did tonight. It’s a big favor to ask them…”
He groped for his torch but before he could flick it to life, something struck him hard in the back of the knees, making him stumble, knocking the torch from his hand.
This information would be utterly baffling to Sherlock if not for the fact that he knows the real reason behind their dedication. It’s because they would do
He didn’t even make it to the living room before his legs gave out beneath him. He fell back against the door of Sherlock’s room and let himself slide down to the floor, his entire body shaking. He put his head in his hands and struggled to breathe deeply, all too aware of the erection still pressing painfully against the front of his trousers.
Without pulling his mouth away from Sherlock’s, John crawled closer, climbing over Sherlock to straddle his hips.
He moved his free hand from where it was holding Sherlock’s thigh to slide it over Sherlock’s hip, up his side and over the stark grooves of his ribs to join his hand with Sherlock’s where it was rubbing over Sherlock’s nipples.
John was right to worry. This new information does make Sherlock feel intimated, and absurdly jealous over John’s past lovers, but if he is perfectly honest with himself then Sherlock has to admit that he had already suspected as much. John being who he is, Sherlock doesn’t understand how half the world hasn’t already fallen in love with John.
The smell of Sherlock beside him—some new brand of expensive aftershave that Sherlock had no doubt purchased exclusively for this trip, muted, sultry, mixed with the smell of the cold and the heat of his body from the chase, was more apparent now than ever in the confined space of the elevator, and the bouquet of scents seemed to tug actively at John’s self-restraint.
After all, the nature of John and Sherlock’s relationship isn’t exactly a secret anymore on board the ship, at least not to the members of John’s mess. Anderson is certainly aware of it; and it’s very possible that Anderson had complained to the captain about the two of them in the aftermath of Lestrade’s poisoning, that it was for this very reason that the captain had agreed to put Anderson in charge of John’s men.
“God, I could use a cigarette though.” Sherlock glanced longingly toward the skull on the mantelpiece.
“Very good.” Lestrade looks significantly at Sherlock before walking away, but doesn’t say anything more. He doesn’t have to.
“No, it doesn’t,” Deverall says, laughing, the sound of it charming and effortless, and then he’s looking up at Sherlock, a smile still on his mouth. “Holmes, I was wondering if I might have a word.”
John tugs gently, tilting Sherlock’s head back on the pillow, baring his throat, and Sherlock can feel his entire body filling with heat, his arousal gathering force between his legs. He can feel their joined fingers rising up and down with the rapid movement of his belly.
Sherlock feels the change in John at his words; feels the shudder that moves through him like thunder.
If any incident has transpired between John and Stevens, or even Anderson and the rest of John’s mess, Sherlock is sure that the passengers will have heard about it by now and the supper table will be alight with gossip.
Sherlock knows there is no way he’s going to be able to take John’s cock as deep as he wants, at least not this first time, so he does the next best thing. He slides his mouth off John’s cock briefly to rub his fingers through the slickness at the tip, then wrapping his slippery fingers around the base of John’s cock he begins to stroke.
This is the first time in his life he’s ever had more than one person he’s liked so much, so he’s never had the experience of getting to introduce them to one another. He finds the experience not altogether displeasing.
John had already eaten his way through almost the entirety of the contents on the cart and was just tucking into his second plate of pastries, happily spilling crumbs all over the sheet and the newspaper in his lap, when the mound of eiderdowns beside him stirred.
Sherlock makes a sound of protest, but John holds himself just beyond the reach of Sherlock’s searching mouth.
There are several horrible beats of silence in which all of the blood drains out of Sherlock’s face.
He hears John’s sharp intake of breath, and then before he can answer, Sherlock plunges out of the circle of John’s arms and down into the water.
There is a special pleasure in dancing with John too, not just because of how closely they are dancing together—the way John’s body feels against his as they dance sending whole new currents of information spiraling through Sherlock’s brain—this is how John’s hips feel when he’s dancing, this is how his back moves under Sherlock’s hands—but because John clearly takes as much joy in it as Sherlock.
He can feel the breeze from the open doorway teasing over his skin, cooling the drying sweat from their trek through the jungle, and suddenly all he can think about is the promise of the water outside, of how good it will feel against his overheated skin.
It’s true that the different sections of the ship, briefly mingling during the musical performance, have now gone back to their self-segregating natural order, with a few exceptions. Sherlock sees Charles Bailey, the young passenger who’s about Sherlock’s age who has the unfortunate habit of always saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, sitting and drinking with Colonel Jackson and the others. The boy looks like he’s already had far too much to drink.
However, his fatigue was so acute, that eventually his troubled mind succumbed to his exhausted body and was pulled down into a world of nightmares.
Molly giggles, but manages not to relapse into full hilarity. “God, I can’t think the last time I’ve laughed so hard.” She turns her warm smile on Sherlock. “Thank you for that.”
It was cold in Vienna at this time of year and standing huddled beside Sherlock on a wind-swept corner, the golden street lamps lit up against a dense grey sky that threatened snow, hands shoved deep in his pockets, John spent a lot of time fantasizing about what it might be like to go on a normal holiday with Sherlock.
“John,” Sherlock whispers, his voice full of reverence, stroking his long fingers down over John’s muscular hip, his thumb lingering in the groove of his pelvic bone. “Tell me what to do.”
Sherlock can feel John’s eyes, still warm on his face. “There’s no pressure for you to play. If you don’t want to…”
It had been several hours since Sherlock had come home to find John on the coffee table fending off spiders, and Sherlock was relatively confident that the effects of the drug (s) were beginning to wear off.
Lieutenant Deverall steps forward with the cane in his hand, and the expression on his face, Sherlock can see, is as grave as Lieutenant Lestrade’s. His features are drawn, his mouth a hard line that poses such a contrast to his usual open expression that it’s shocking to behold.
At the feel of John’s mouth yielding beneath his, and the warm lovely heat of John’s tongue in his mouth, Sherlock cries out, low, helpless, full of delight, as everything around him fades beyond his perception—the hard boards under his knees, the sun on his back, the distant roar of the foam against the hull—everything, everything dissolves around him until there is only John’s warm body under his hands, John’s hot, slick tongue in his mouth.
“You must forgive me for disturbing you like this. I didn’t know where else to go—and I had to know. Is it true what they’re saying? That the captain’s ordered the ship to leave port tomorrow morning? Is it true, Sherlock?”
The structure was based on the layout of the Holmes’ estate, which Sherlock could easily walk through in his mind with his eyes closed. He started out by grouping certain types of memories in particular rooms, organizing them by a complicated schema of logic that made sense only to him. Over the years as he continued to add to it, Sherlock modified the structure in his head—gutted rooms that he’d never liked, replacing their interiors with objects that were important to him.
“Take this,” she says with a smile. “It will help keep the sun off of your face and it’s ever so much cooler than your usual hat.”
“Yeah,” John bit out, his voice catching as Sherlock licked a trail down the length of his spine. “Yeah, it was…” John licked his lips again. “You made it all very…” Now Sherlock was mouthing at the hollow at the base of his hips. John arched his back at the sensation with a little moan. “Very…”
It doesn’t look as though she’s introduced herself to anyone yet and seeing her there, alone and uncertain, Sherlock feels his relief replaced by guilt. He never should have pushed her into one of the longboats by herself. She seemed so confident this morning when they headed up on deck. But perhaps she’s feeling just as overwhelmed as Sherlock by all the unfamiliar sights and sounds, the hubbub and chaos of the harbor bubbling around them, as heady and intoxicating as some strange new liquor.
Sherlock listens to the ebb and flow of their eager voices, disinterested, but unable to block them out.
He pulls out his pen and ink, almost spilling it in his haste to wet the nib, and begins scratching out notes to write new ones in.
Thank you for continuing to be the loveliest bunch of readers anyone could ask for. This story has a long way to go yet, and I can't tell you what it means to know that you are all still in this with me!
John licks his lips then, the corners of his mouth curling up into a wicked smile, his dark eyes settling on Sherlock’s mouth.
He waits until the feeling passes, eyes screwed shut, counting every heartbeat that shudders through his temples. He
Sherlock nodded, putting a finger to his lips to motion for quiet. He pointed at the building directly across from them.
Sherlock made a desperate noise in response, his hips jutting forward into John’s, and for the first time John felt the swell of Sherlock’s erection against his hip.
Sherlock shakes his head. He wants to convey to John what it meant to him, but there are no words to describe the feeling.
His arms are shaking on either side of John—he’s biting his lip so hard he’s about to break the skin. He can feel the peak of his pleasure drawing closer, like a wave gathering force, tightening the muscles in his belly and his legs.
However, luck is with him in some small way this morning as Sherlock looks up from a half-hearted bite of porridge to see Miss Molly Hooper sitting down beside him with a smile on her face.
What seems more and more apparent to Sherlock is that there must be a correlation between the two events—the attempted poisoning and the captain’s obsession with getting to Rio—but what is the connection? What could possibly link the captain’s desire to kill one of his passengers with his need to get to the South American port city on time?
Sherlock rounded on Lestrade, his voice a snarl. “So what are you waiting for? Why are we all still standing here when there’s a serial killer currently
It feels good to be free of the dingy garment and Sherlock shakes his curls to help lay them flat once John has thrown the shirt down to the end of the bed to join his own.
The fact that Sherlock was covering his face with his hands, and the low and almost scandalized timber of his voice suggested that he was somewhat… shocked by what John was doing. This realization made something like pride spark to life in John’s chest, but at the same time it gave him pause. After all, he hadn’t asked before he’d started. Probably it was best to ask.
Moriarty adjusted his grip and pushed the blade deeper, his breath now coming fast against John’s face.
Sherlock is not an idiot—he knows that the backbone of the British Empire is supported by slave labor—as are most of the monarchies of Europe—their wealth and prosperity built on the backs of people who are captured and then bought and sold as chattel. But it is one thing to know of its existence—to read about the horrors of the slave ships, to hear of the ghastly treatment of enslaved peoples on plantations throughout the British colonies—but to see it with his own eyes, is something very different.
The voice is unfamiliar—someone well educated, posh accent, perfect diction. He’s standing behind John just out of sight. He considers turning to look, instantly thinks better of it.
But almost as soon as John leans into him, he is pulling away, breaking the kiss, and dropping his hands down to Sherlock’s shoulders to hold him at bay.
Sherlock knows he should head straight below so as to avoid calling any further attention to himself—especially since his goal right now, above all else, is to keep a low profile, to ensure that he will be able to leave the ship tomorrow morning on the first boat bound for shore.
“They found two more bodies in a house in Chelsea. Same exact scarring patterns of the butcher shop murderer, but with several… additional organs missing. Obviously the locale is drastically different. They’re not sure whether they were murdered in the house, or if the bodies were simply brought there after the fact. Lestrade’s on his way now.”
His mouth is watering—filling with saliva—and he almost moans aloud at how badly he wants this, but he has just enough presence of mind to know that he should ask John first—be sure that John wants this too. He looks up at John in question, his lips struggling a moment to form the words.
“You’re cold.” He closed his hands around John’s upper arms, pulling his hands from where they were tucked into his armpits. Sherlock took John’s hands into his much larger ones, folding his surprisingly warm fingers around John’s.  “We should go back inside.”
Before Sherlock can answer, John is kissing him, his thumbs stroking over Sherlock’s cheeks, his mouth parting against Sherlock’s to lick along the seam of his lips.
Of course, Mycroft had survived, much to Sherlock’s later dismay, but he will never forget the sight of his older brother, pale and sweating, his skin like wax, muttering, restless, his eyes unseeing while death hung like a specter over the shuttered room.
Sherlock lifts one leg and twines it around the back of John’s calf, drawing their hips into alignment. John gasps softly.
I'll admit, I might be even more excited than I usually am to hear back from you all. I hope this moment lived up to twelve chapters worth of anticipation. ;)
“Can we—?” Sherlock puts his hands on his knees, struggling to catch his breath. “Take just a brief—rest?”
John reaches a hand out to cup Sherlock’s jaw, tilting Sherlock’s eyes up to his own. They are full of flame.
There seems no need to say anything at all—John’s posture conveys his contentment more eloquently than any words ever could. Still, Sherlock feels the need to sit up a bit so that his head is propped on his hand and he can get a better look at John, searching for the right question.
in danger. Or at least I should hope not. Then again, who knows? Perhaps you’re more self-involved even than I presumed.”
John trembling between Sherlock’s legs, his eyes squeezing shut, his body pushing up into Sherlock’s weight—it is beautiful like the stars are beautiful, like the first curl of frost on the window in winter, like the light of the sun on Sherlock’s cheeks. It is rare and so delicate, so brief, Sherlock wishes there was a way he could capture this moment and all its sensations and bottle it up somewhere, to ensure that he could have some part of it always within himself.
He is utterly focused on his work; he could be alone in the room, save for himself and his patient, so intent is he on the matter before him. His brow is creased in concentration, his blue eyes serious and dark, thin lips pursed as he pulls out another instrument from his bag and sets it to the man’s skin.
Sherlock sits on the edge of his bed, eyes shut tight, not moving, scarcely breathing, trying as hard as possible to ignore the details of his current physical reality so that he may better focus on the memory of the sensations that are so recent in his mind.
It’s like looking suddenly into a mirror to realize that John—even sun-bright, irrepressible, invincible John—has moments of self-doubt—that he wants Sherlock so much that sometimes he can’t believe any of it is real.
“Are you headed to the forecastle?” Sherlock asks, knowing full well that’s where Billy is headed if he is to take his supper.
Anderson says nothing in reply, but before he leaves, he throws Sherlock a look that could peel paint off the starboard rail.
“Sweet Jesus.” John arched his back at the sensation and Sherlock did it again, this time rising up to lick John’s neck as he did so.
He dumps the whole mess into his slop bucket before crawling into bed, determined not to dream of bronze-armed sailors swinging from the rigging, leaping over the waves.
John pulled Sherlock down against him as he felt the warm rush of Sherlock’s release spill out over Sherlock’s fist onto the skin of his belly, hips hitching up instinctively to bring them closer together, the smear of liquid on the sensitive skin of his cock drawing one last, long shudder from his body.
And before Sherlock can answer, he’s vanished through the doorway beyond the stairs, slamming it hard behind him.
Sherlock’s breathing was already growing uneven above him as John’s mouth dipped down to brush his areola.
When he comes to, the first thing he notices is the smell of rot—a putrid stench like old flesh decomposing—and the sound of water rushing very close by.
There is a hunger, a desperation welling up between the words in this letter that reminds Sherlock of the way John sometimes looks right before he throws a punch, the line of his jaw defined, the muscles in his shoulders tensed for action; it reminds Sherlock of the way John’s kisses felt when they were down in the orlop deck, a need behind them that Sherlock sensed John had been holding himself back from expressing, an urgency in the press of his fingers on Sherlock’s thighs where he held him up.
The captain steps forward, his beady eyes glimmering as he turns to look into the faces of the men standing in a circle around him.
Sherlock whimpers, grinding his hips against the mattress, and John must be able to feel the sound all the way through his cock because his hips jerk reflexively up into Sherlock’s mouth, and then Sherlock really does choke.
“No.” Lestrade’s eyes are hard. “It really wasn’t. That’s one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you. You put both of your lives at risk just by coming to my aid. There’s still the possibility that whoever made me ill did so with the intention of killing me. If that was their intent, they are by now well aware that they didn’t succeed. If they know that either of you tried to help me the two of you could be in very real danger.”
Sherlock jerked at the first press of his finger and then whined with longing, pushing his hips greedily forward. “Y-yes, John. Yes. Yes, yes, yes—I need you in me.
John let out a sob, his hand coming up too late to cover his mouth. He held his hand there a moment, swallowing down the gravity of what Sherlock had just said.
The song is over far too quickly, and Sherlock and the drummer play twice more through the melody before drawing to a close.
The sight of it gives Sherlock a tiny glimmer of hope because it means all of John is not lost to this misery, his light is still there, it’s just taken on a different shape, flame-bright and crackling at the edges with rage.
It is John who breaks the kiss, pressing his forehead to Sherlock’s cheek and inhaling deeply as if to steady himself. Sherlock can feel his hands trembling where they hold his curls.
, who weathered the final years of her PhD program while editing piles and piles of angsty smut for me, always offering heartfelt encouragement to John and Sherlock in the margins.
The quarterdeck is bristling with officers this morning—Sherlock has never seen so many of them on deck at once—and the captain stands in the midst of them all, his hands folded behind his back, his eyes narrowed in concentration.
He can feel sweat crawling down the back of his neck and Sherlock does not know whether it is simply the heat of the tropical night or the fury of his emotions that is causing his body to feel as though it is lit up by a small furnace.
John’s self-defense instincts kicked in. He was prepared to elbow his assailant in the kidneys with deathly force when a hand clamped over his mouth and Sherlock’s voice in his ear hissed, “It’s alright. It’s me. I doubled-back so I could surprise him. He’s coming this way. Don’t make a sound.”
The sidewalk outside Speedy’s was shimmering with heat. When John exited the cab he felt it crash over him like a wave. Within seconds, his forehead was drenched in sweat.
“What’s that? Is there a minor earthquake occurring somewhere just outside Vienna or is Sherlock Holmes waking up?”
He points disinterestedly at each box, barrel and crate, watching with a faint sense of satisfaction as the rage grows on Ferguson’s face.
Sherlock lifted his head then, and slid back up John’s body until his mouth was hovering over John’s, his eyes glittering in the firelight, brimming with urgency. “I need you to know what you’re worth.”
Not for the first time in John’s presence, he feels as though his chest is too small to contain his heart.
He would normally ask John what he wants—would normally take much more care to touch him in a certain way—but there isn’t time, so Sherlock rubs his palm over the slit, which he knows is very sensitive and is delighted to find the head of John’s cock is already slick with moisture.
As Sherlock began to pump John’s cock in and out of his mouth, John found himself responding in a breathless canto of needy, high-pitched sounds. Embarrassed, he pushed his fist into his mouth to stifle them.
John’s breath is hot against Sherlock’s neck as he pulls the last button free and then he lifts his hands away in surrender, leaving Sherlock to the rest.
John lifted himself onto his elbows to give him more momentum, and they groaned together as the movement pushed Sherlock’s finger deeper into him.
Ever since his sudden awareness of his feelings, he hadn’t let himself get near Sherlock. He tensed up every time Sherlock got close, simultaneously flooded with terror that Sherlock would deduce his feelings, and shame that the feelings existed in the first place. Having Sherlock temporarily out of the flat because he was immersed in a case was not a solution to John’s problem.
If he is, then Sherlock will know that the man simply skipped supper because he was hot, or perhaps had too much on his mind, in which case Sherlock will know that nothing out of the ordinary is taking place.
John’s voice would be moving enough on its own, but the accompaniment that he plays on the guitar adds a depth, a texture to the music that enriches what would otherwise be a simple melody. Set against John’s lovely voice, the march of the changing chords lends gravity to the words that he sings. In contrast to the quick sweet sound of the high notes there is something dark and inevitable in the deep reverberation of the low strings. Sherlock can feel them resonate in his chest.
John smiles at the older sailor in apology. “Excuse me, Burns, but I’ve got someone I’d like Sherlock to meet.”
“Time of death estimated to be sometime early this morning. It’s not clear whether they were… whether it happened here or elsewhere.”
He wonders how far she could have gotten by now. The other longboats were no more than an hour ahead of theirs.
“I know they don’t like us—you—and that’s fine. I don’t blame them. But this is too much. This time they’ve gone too far. I’m not going to stand for it, Sherlock. I’m not.”
Sherlock is relieved by this response because it’s a sure sign that the older lady has no inkling of any of the drama that went on last evening, nor indeed that there was a stark naked John Watson at one point hiding underneath her bed.
John could feel Sherlock melting under his hands—his movements around John’s cock began to lose their rhythm; his fingers clutching John’s arse so hard, John was sure they were leaving bruises.
Sherlock can see how badly he wants to reprimand John, but it is not technically within his purview to do so. He turns back around, his face splotchy with rage.
“Besides, when I saw you were trapped between your aunt and George McKinley…” Sherlock mimes gagging over the railing. “I couldn’t leave you to that fate.”
John staggered into the space that had cleared in the center of the room. He was about to turn and say something to Donovan when he saw Sherlock being pushed toward him.
John stiffened at the contact and fought the instinct to rub himself against Sherlock’s leg. He had about one scrap of dignity left and he intended to keep it.
The next morning Sherlock still seemed miffed by John’s refusal of his offer the night before. He didn’t look up from his microscope when John entered the kitchen and his “Good Morning” to John was several degrees colder than usual. John searched the perimeter of the room hopefully for a mug of tea but no such luck. He sighed. He’d known the appearance of fresh, perfectly prepared mugs of tea would be fleeting but it was still disappointing to face reality.
Ferguson eyes him shrewdly for a moment, and in the cold assessment of his gaze over Sherlock’s person, Sherlock can see the businessman in him.
John looks back at Sherlock with his mouth fallen open, and then begins to laugh, softly, helplessly, into his hand.
When he felt Sherlock’s mouth become soft and pliant under his, body bearing down towards John to seek more of him, he tightened his fingers in Sherlock’s hair and tugged his mouth away. He felt Sherlock’s gasp of pain rather than heard it, and leaning back against the pillows, he let his eyes trail down the flushed skin of Sherlock’s throat and chest to where his cock was half-hard, outlined against the material of his shorts.
Sherlock lets out a breath, shakes out his fists. There is so much hatred coursing through him he fears for a moment that he might be sick. He puts his hands on his knees and takes a deep breath, waits for the sensation to pass.
Then John is lifting his legs and wrapping them around the backs of Sherlock’s thighs, pressing in just below his arse, pulling Sherlock in against him with the grip of his legs.
Hearing the pitch of desperation in John’s voice affirms Sherlock’s decision—John needs this—and of course he does—he’s essentially been nursing an erection for the past hour without release.
John’s growing excitement is palpable. He sheathes the blade at his back, hitching the strap of his bag further up his shoulder as he begins to lengthen his strides.
“Most accounts of people seeing ghosts are people from life who they had strong emotional connections to. If you think of ghosts as collections of memories, as impressions they left on the people they loved—”
One eye was still swollen shut but he lifted his head and looked at Sherlock out of his good eye. He immediately wished he hadn’t.
Sherlock sees an expression flicker over Lestrade’s face faster than he can identify before it’s gone again. “Did you remind them that no leniency would be tolerated in the completion of their duties?”
The muscles in John’s raised arms are gleaming with a fine sheen of sweat. Sherlock watches the sunlight glimmering on his shining torso as he moves and all he can think is
But Sherlock has never been good with words—when he reaches for them, they skitter away like dust before a wind, scattering.
Sherlock was watching him with heavy-lidded eyes, his chest rising and falling rapidly with every shallow breath. He lifted his hips in invitation. His voice was a whimper. “John. Please.”
Sherlock did not see his mother again until they buried the child—she stayed locked away in her rooms, eaten away by grief.
It’s almost unbearable—the force of his love for this man. John is like heat—like light—like the heart of a star; he is too good, too bright for Sherlock to contemplate without feeling seared to the core of his being, too much to hold in his mind at once. He should be impossible. No human should be able to have all the qualities that John has—to walk the yardarm with the casual grace of a dancer, to fight three Frenchmen with blood pouring out of his side and emerge victorious, to sing so softly and sweetly even after all the suffering he’s faced, his smile, so lean and bright and full of heat, bringing out the color in his eyes as blue as the ocean’s waves—and yet there he sits, within Sherlock’s reach.
They eat in the cool shade of the doorway, looking out at the deep blue ocean, and once again, Sherlock feels from the roots of his hair down to the tips of his toes, a feeling of the most exquisite earthly bliss.
Keeping himself from going to pieces in John’s absence is the least he can do in the time that they are apart. He needs to be stronger—he can be, he
His fingers were still rubbing delicate circles over his nipples and John made a frustrated sound, pushing his chest closer to Sherlock’s hands. The touch was too teasing, too light. He needed more friction, but Sherlock’s hands slid back down to grip his hips, stilling him.
The tension between their bodies is like a living force, vibrating with possibility. Sherlock can almost see it, like the shimmer of heat that’s visible on summer days. It’s as though the warmth of both their bodies is filling up the space. Sherlock’s face feels hot and for the first time today it’s not because of embarrassment.
“I…” Sherlock falters; shakes his head. His heart is pounding so hard it’s difficult to get the words out.
“I didn’t have a mind palace then. I hadn’t learned how to delete things so the pain was with me constantly. It was unbearable. The pain manifested as rage. I had a lot of trouble. They had to send me to a special school.” There was a note of dark amusement in his voice. “You could say that’s when the trouble began.”
Sherlock stumbles, fatigue making him dizzy, hands on his knees as he struggles to catch his breath.
The shrill sound of the boatswain’s whistle drags his attention back to his immediate surroundings; the men are being called down from the sails.
John lifts his chin, stretching his head back to give Sherlock better access to his neck. The world is still hazy around him. Opening his eyes and looking up, he sees blue, blue stretching on and on above him into infinity. Funny, a moment ago, he could have sworn he’d seen bathroom tiles.
It’s not until John is out of sight that Sherlock turns to look and see who has stopped to watch them from across the deck, and when he does, all the heat in Sherlock’s body turns to ice.
John could feel his pulse pounding in the tense line of his throat. He fought to keep his voice calm. “What did you give him?”
He does so now, turns his hand slowly, watches it ripple over his knuckles, the palm of his hand like a living thing as his mind resounds with a single thought.
“Well done, lad, well bloody done,” Stapleton is saying, green eyes crinkled almost shut with joy as he shakes Sherlock’s hand with vigor. “I thought we’d never be rid of that stinking dung heap. We certainly owe you one.”
“Well, I’ve found some answers for you. The instrument you were wondering about is Swedish. He said it’s called a
“I am happy to report that we are finally making our desired speed. If all goes well we shall reach the port of Rio de Janeiro in two days time.”
They were nearing the bottom of the pile and John was feeling triumphant, not because they were getting any nearer to finding the evidence they needed, but because he had managed to successfully feed Sherlock a second plate of curry and two more mugs of tea. He had just finished flicking through his current stack of papers and was leaning over to place them in their respective pile, when he looked over to find Sherlock sound asleep beside him on the couch.
Sherlock grabs Billy by the shoulders in sudden desperation. “Did he hurt Stevens, Billy? What did he do?”
He had planned to take it leisurely, to give Sherlock a proper show, but he finds, now that Sherlock is beneath him, looking at him like that, he can’t deny himself the satisfaction of fucking up into his own fist, hard and fast, buttocks clenching and tightening and then, Sherlock startles him by reaching down to grab hold of John’s arse, tugging a little, fingers kneading the muscle, and that is all takes to make John come, his abdominal muscles rippling as his body goes tight and he stiffens and spills all over his own fist and Sherlock’s pale chest, splotchy with arousal in the guttering candlelight.
Sherlock is still silent beside John. He’s trying to listen to John’s words but he’s having trouble focusing, he’s lost—he feels like he’s drowning in his own helplessness. He wants to give John what he needs but he’s realizing now just how powerless he is to do so.
Sherlock’s small appreciative noise made John even more aware of what felt like the live current of longing for Sherlock running through his body. He could feel it even in the smallest point of contact between them—where the tips of his fingers rested under Sherlock’s jaw, in the drag of his fingers over Sherlock’s cheek—burning with an almost palpable heat.
Sherlock returned with two bulging bags of steaming containers. He began to pull them out, one by one, and unveil them ceremoniously in front of John. In addition to green curry, Sherlock had ordered all of John’s favorite things, and then half the items on the menu besides.
“It was also incredibly reckless,” he adds with a touch of exasperation that makes Sherlock stiffen slightly, “But we’ll get to that. What’s more important is that you
John is right—these trousers are the tightest Sherlock owns; he knows how flattering they are. He chose them deliberately. Although Sherlock may be nowhere near as well endowed as John Watson, he knows how to display the assets he does possess to their best advantage.
.” The man smiled condescendingly at John, his eyes traveling pointedly down the front of John’s mud-splattered jumper. “Go home and get some rest. I think you need it as much as your friend. If you’d like to file a formal complaint with the hospital for any reason, feel free to come back tomorrow and one of our secretaries can assist you in filling out the necessary paperwork. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have patients to look after. Good day to you.”
John grins back at him, for real this time, the worry sponged away in the blink of an eye, until he’s beaming at Sherlock, reaching over to grab him by the shoulder. “Welcome to a party with the other half of the ship.”
“John,” he breathes, rising partway out of the water and sliding his dripping arms around John’s neck to hold him in place.
“God, yes,” John said, tipping his hips forward in his eagerness, feeling hungry, suddenly conscious of an ache somewhere inside him that only Sherlock could satisfy. He wanted to be filled. “God, please, Sherlock. Please.”
Sherlock’s hips pistoned harder into him than ever and John could tell Sherlock was close as he began to lose the rhythm of his thrusts.
Sherlock lowers his eyes to find a woman in a faded polka-dotted dress watching him from across the deck, the parasol in her hand shading her eyes from the sun.
Ironsides Jake, who is apparently too overcome to speak, shakes Sherlock’s hand so hard he nearly takes his arm off.
Sherlock’s face was grim. “This whole thing stinks of Moriarty. And if I know anything about dear Jim it’s that he’s not keen on survivors.”
The lanterns suspended overhead cast everything in their swinging golden light, the wreaths of the pipe smoke coiling in and around the bodies of the men like friendly ghosts. The slide of the lights over their faces, the sinuous movement of the tendrils of smoke, gives the scene the shifting other-worldly quality of an underwater grotto, puts Sherlock in mind of the dream he had when he was ill, of the drowned sailors congregating at the bottom of the sea.
