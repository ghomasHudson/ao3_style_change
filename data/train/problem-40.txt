“Well, it is her favourite,” Sherlock stated, the obviously heavily implied, and John just shook his head in mild exasperation, and perhaps more than a small amount of fondness. They walked quietly the rest of the way to Baker Street.
John reached up a hand to touch his friend’s face. His fingers traced over his cheekbone, his jaw. His thumb traced the shape of his bottom lip. He felt Sherlock’s breathing pick up, felt his pulse as it began to race under his fingers. John met Sherlock’s gaze again, saw the truth of his words in his eyes, and gently pulled him down to his mouth.
“Sherlock, I know it’s terribly cliche this time of year, which is why I supposed you might just miss it because it was so obvious.”
Then the nightmare with Magnussen happened and he almost lost Sherlock again. Again and again. Sherlock in his life, giving him life, then taken out of it again and John was left struggling to keep his head above the water.
“Yeah, well, you aren’t the first to make that assumption,” John admitted, irritation clear in his tone. “He’s my best friend, but that’s as far as it goes. He doesn’t do relationships.”
It was a lovely day, mild and sunny, and he enjoyed walking around. He wasn’t even annoyed with the sound of his cane tapping against the stones as he walked. He stopped several times, pulling out his camera and snapping photos of the inside, before he finally made his way outside about an hour later.
Sherlock went silent as John turned to hand him his prepared tea. They both took a careful sip before Sherlock spoke again.
“Yes. I love dancing,” Sherlock replied. “Is it so hard to believe that I went out dancing at a club?”
John sat up a bit to look at Sherlock more fully, a grin pulling at his lips. “Did you just point out something in the solar system?”
She stood in front of Sherlock, hopping up and down in excitement. “Is it chocolate? Is it chocolate? Chocolate!”
“Just that she reminds me a lot of you. She’s curious, always wants to know the answers to every question she can think of. She’s impulsive, quick, always jumping from one thing to another.”
“I’m going to kiss you, John. Then I’m going to lay you out and show you what you mean to me. I’m going to watch you fall apart under my hands and then put you back together. I want to taste and touch and know you in every way one person can know another.”
Sherlock liked the Detective Inspector as a person, but today was not a day he could deal with idiots who ignored the evidence in front of their eyes. He rose as swiftly as a tidal wave and spun around, glaring at the man in front of him.
He wished her goodnight, then closed the door behind him as she settled onto her couch to tend to her hip medication.
“He said he would like to continue our acquaintance,” he replied as he saw no reason to lie to his brother. He would know as soon as he did and it was a waste of both of their times to bother lying.
After she was settled, John went and took a quick shower. He changed into his pajamas, then made his way back downstairs after checking that Rosie was asleep in her room. He went into the kitchen and filled the kettle with fresh water and placed it on the hob. He pulled down mugs and found the tea.
“Bless you,” John responded automatically, then he frowned. “Go get out of those wet clothes, Sherlock. Take a hot bath. I’ll make some tea.”
Not that he really felt that way, of course. There was absolutely nowhere else he would rather be. As he watched Sherlock scoop Rosie up into his arms, dancing her around the living room between the chairs and tables as he whispered something in her ear, he also knew there was no one else he wanted to spend his life with. He ended his call and put his mobile on the kitchen counter before he walked into the living room where his friend and daughter danced.
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked up at John again. At the familiar eyes, the doctorly and friendly concern in them. He felt the sticky sweat that had dried on his skin. The salt from his tears that lined his eyes. He nodded and John gave his hair another pet before he leveraged himself up off the floor by Sherlock’s head.
He opened his mouth to say something, he wasn’t sure what, but then Sherlock stepped impossibly closer, crowding him under the water. His large hands came up to cradle John’s face and their eyes locked. Neither spoke, just breathed, or didn’t breathe, John wasn’t sure, he was getting dizzy from the heat of the shower and the rush of emotions that had collided in him earlier, and now he was standing under the water with Sherlock on the wrong side of the curtain, but no, it was the side he needed to be on, right now, to know that he was alive and well and the blood that had bloomed on his throat earlier was gone, washed away, and no, he was sure now, he definitely wasn’t breathing.
John lost control at his words, his body flooded with pure want and he slammed into Sherlock once, twice more, his balls drawn up tight to his body before he came so hard his vision went black around the edges, Sherlock’s name on his lips as he cried out.
This, though, was different. There was something familiar about that contact. Something that went beyond the familiarity that would exist between old schoolmates. It was intimate.
Mrs. Hudson nodded absently as she fussed with the garland and John let her carry on without further conversation.
John wasn’t sure how he made it through his workday, but somehow he managed to muddle along, correctly diagnose patients (he’s pretty sure), avoid the aggressive flirting of the new nurse, and fill out his paperwork in a way that didn’t end up in him getting fussed at by the staff.
John wrinkled his brow in confusion. “What is that supposed to mean? As long as I get there, that’s what matters.”
“We need to go back to the crime scene so I can check the mud there. There’s something in the sample from the victim that I can’t figure out…”
“Glad to see you still have your coat,” he said, his voice hoarse as he pushed it out past a dry throat.
“Sherlock, look. I’m more than happy to come and help out with your cases. I really am. But I don’t need to live here to make that happen.”
He pulled the shades on the windows closed, blocking out the early evening light. Crossing over to his bed, he laid down on the floor beside it, then threw his legs up into the air, letting his calves bounce against the edge of the mattress as he stared up at the ceiling.
John sighed and shook his head, listening to make sure Sherlock was still playing and not listening to their conversation. He kept his voice low, even though the sound of the violin continued on from the living room.
“I don’t even want to know how you knew that or saw the results,” John said but accepted it. John trusted him. After all this time, he still trusted him.
They made their way down the stairs, briefly stopped at the door to throw on their coats, then headed out the door and down the pavement. It was a mild day and the restaurant close enough that walking there made more sense than getting a taxi. The sounds of the city, alive and thriving around them in the midday rush, accompanied them as they walked in sync, and Sherlock took in every moment he could. He walked a bit closer to John than he normally would, their shoulders occasionally pressed against each other, but there were enough people around them that Sherlock felt he could get away with the small brushes. For one electrifying moment he thought about how easy it would be to reach out and grab John’s hand, to hold it in his as they walked, but he swiftly squashed the thought down.
Sherlock’s lips quirked up as he stepped impossibly closer to him, one large hand coming up to cup John’s jaw, and John’s eyes closed without his consent to revel in the feeling of that warm palm against his flesh. Sherlock’s hand moved back, long fingers curled into the hair at the back of John’s head, and John felt Sherlock’s breath ghost across his lips before there was the soft, tender press of those perfect lips against his. He was surrounded by Sherlock. The warmth that radiated off of his body and the lips pressed against his, that sweet honey-scented conditioner and some herbal concoction that John had never been able to parse apart, the faint trace of the chemicals that he worked with, then something else that was just Sherlock. Something that spoke of home.
“John,” he says, eyes opening, and John sees the desire clear in that gaze. Desire, and something softer, something deeper.
Why was he letting his thoughts wander off to Sherlock right now? The man had been clear he wasn’t interested, and his current date had been relatively clear that she was. Much more pleasant thoughts. She was shy, but he could work with shy. He knew how to give genuine compliments, and even not-so-genuine ones. Yes, this date could definitely go in his favor. He shook thoughts of Sherlock out of his mind and turned his attention back towards the movie and the woman at his side.
There wasn’t time to dwell on all of it, though. Sherlock was on the computer attempting to track the victim’s phone to geo-locate her killer and the flat was thrown into chaos between the two bickering men, the several other officers conducting the supposed drugs bust, and Mrs. Hudson who repeatedly interrupted everything to tell Sherlock that his taxi was here and the cabbie was getting very irritated at being kept waiting.
After about ten minutes of walking, he found himself standing in front of the Colosseum. There was something very humbling about standing in front of a stone structure that had stood for generations of men, and would continue to stand long past your own existence. It made him feel small and insignificant, but at the same time, there was something inspiring about it. That man should build something that lasts that long was awe inspiring, and he let his mind wander as he made his way into the amphitheater.
Sherlock pulled him down, causing him to slip further in, and they both groaned as Sherlock kissed him again. Sherlock’s tongue was hot in his mouth and his body was hot as it closed over his cock and John was dead.
“I just happened to notice that you seem to have moved into the flat at...221B Baker Street,” his brother replied, pausing deliberately over the address as if he didn’t know exactly where Sherlock was at almost any given point in time. He didn’t bother replying and was awarded by an annoyed huff of breath a moment later. “Did you find a flatmate?”
Sherlock had entered into his life quite by chance, and he had given John his life back. A purpose, a reason. Even if that reason was mainly to make sure the madman stayed alive to give John a
“I’m afraid if I don’t say this now then I never will, and that isn’t fair to you or to me. Not anymore.” Sherlock took a deep breath, then looked up at John. “Yesterday evening. At the ice cream shoppe. That woman. You didn’t correct her when she assumed we were together. Why?”
“Oh no, dear, these aren’t for you. They’re for Joy,” Mrs. Hudson informed him before plucking a biscuit off the plate and holding it out for Joy, who took it eagerly.
“You can’t without evidence. And I didn’t break-in,” the DI replied easily in the face of his anger.
John groaned and Sherlock reined in his laugh to keep from waking Rosie. John turned his groan into a good-natured chuckle.
Sherlock hadn’t looked away from John. He wasn’t even sure the other man had blinked. There was something in the way he was staring that made John’s muscles clench, his belly swooping low.
John tossed the flannel back towards the bathroom, missing by several feet, but he didn’t care. He turned his eyes back to Sherlock and simply looked at the man spread out before him. There was still a soft flush to his chest and neck, his cock was soft and spent where it lay against pale skin and dark curls, one hand splayed wide against the stomach that could benefit from a few more pounds, the other arm propped under his head, causing his curls to fluff out around the pillow in a halo of utter chaos. He was breathtaking. John’s heart nearly hurt in his chest as he felt the true enormity of what they had done that day. Sherlock was his now, forever, and he could cry for joy and triumph in that claim.
A warm presence appeared near his head. Strong, competent fingers touched his hands where they clutched his curls. Stoked the long fingers until they started to release their stronghold. Gentle fingers wiped at the remnants of tears, collecting and smearing them away. They went back to his fingers, coaxing them to further relax, and carefully pulling them away from his hair.
“Yes, I am a doctor, and I know I’ve had several sick patients recently and could very well be a carrier. So, don’t argue with me and listen to your doctor. Eat your soup, then you’re going to rest.”
“No, I was just out and thought I’d stop by and see how you were,” he said, and he found that he meant it. Their friendship had grown in the year he had been back from the dead. He had not always been the kindest to her, but she had been there for him regardless, and he was grateful to her. He had found that he actually liked Molly. It helped tremendously that she no longer tripped over her own tongue when she talked to him.
“Sherlock!” he called out, and the man turned towards his voice, his eyes widened slightly in surprise before he seemed to gather himself. “What are you doing here?”
“Since when do you think of nothing in particular? You’re always thinking. Usually about very specific things.”
The presence of Sergeant Donovan at the tape didn’t help his mood, but he breezed past her and brought John along without much trouble. They made their way up to the scene, and it was another moment with Lestrade to ensure that John would be allowed in, as if the detective inspector would actually make a stand against him, and he couldn’t help the smile that rose to his lips when the DI gave in even quicker than he expected. He must be truly desperate.
Sherlock bit his bottom lip and John was drawn to the action, his brow furrowing because it wasn’t an action Sherlock did often. His eyes flicked back up to Sherlock’s eyes, but his eyes had shifted away. Sherlock put his cup down and had leaned forward, elbows on his knees as he watched Joy. John waited silently, content for the moment to see what it was that Sherlock was anxious to say.
Sherlock reached out with his right hand and took John’s offered left hand. John’s fingers closed around his hand and he stepped up to him as his right hand went to Sherlock’s back and pulled him closer still. Sherlock’s other hand instinctively went to John’s shoulder as they took their positions.
“I’ll pack this up if you go catch her and tell her the bad news,” John replied. Sherlock smirked before he stood up. He straightened out his shirt and quickly tucked the ends into the waistband of his tailored trousers. He bent down to grab his jacket, slung it over his arm, and tossed John a wink before he took off towards Rosie.
At his wedding, Sherlock said he loved him. In front of a room full of people and his brand new wife, and John had cried. The tears hadn’t left his eyes, but they were there, burning behind his eyelids and he had stood and pulled Sherlock into a hug because what else could he do? He was married.
“Hm. Truth, then,” John answered. He was curious what Sherlock would want an answer for that he couldn’t or hadn’t already deduced.
John was kind of rambling, and he knew that, but he also didn’t know what else to say and just kept going.
John stared at Sherlock, his heart beating wildly in his chest at the implications in his words. He knew about them all. How? Had Mycroft been feeding him information the whole time? He wouldn’t put it past Mycroft to be spying on him. That didn’t even touch on the fact that John had often spoken at the apparently empty grave, as well. Had he been recorded? His heartbroken and honest confessions to a dead man preserved against his knowledge for any bastard who had the right clearance to listen to?
Something was calming about the position, with his legs up and resting against the bed, his back on the solid ground beneath him. He was able to breathe easier for a moment. Something about being inverted like that forced him to center himself and he drew in a long, shaky breath, feeling his chest expand, before letting it out. He shifted, felt the pull of scars against his back. A physical reminder of just one of his many failures.
It took the cabbie raising his voice to wake him from the doze he fell into and he tipped him far more than he usually would in appreciation for the man not murdering him for his negligence. And, you know, holiday spirit or something.
He watched as Sherlock took a bite of the muffin, crumbs falling from the pastry and he leaned forward before they landed on his linen shirt. He hastily wiped the crumbs from his chin. John couldn’t help the smile that stretched across his face.
A little over 20 minutes after he had sent his texts, John strolled into the apartment, cane banging against the floor in counter to his soft-footed steps. A few minutes of inane conversation took place, including John’s doctorly concern regarding his rather unorthodox use of nicotine patches, but then he gave him his phone and he sent a text while John crossed over to the window and glanced out.
His knees slipped back under the water as he sat up, the cooler air in the room causing his exposed skin to bubble in gooseflesh and producing an involuntary shiver. John murmured something unintelligible, his hand now brushing over his shoulder and down his arm until it touched the waterline and disappeared.
Greg had moved to sit on the couch and was petting Joy when he returned. He held out a mug, and the DI took it with a quiet word of thanks. Joy went to curl up on her bed since she was no longer being petted. John watched the DI with as passive an expression as he could manage as he settled into his armchair.
John had watched the whole interaction, which had the intensity of the final match at Wimbledon as it played out, and as soon as Rosie took off he let out the bubble of laughter that had lodged in his chest during the whole exchange. Sherlock straightened up and looked at him, a brow arched primly, and John laughed more.
John stared at his friend in confusion at the sudden announcement that Sherlock apparently had plans for the room that John had agreed to move into just 2 hours ago. Had Sherlock changed his mind about John moving in? Did he no longer want to share Baker Street? Why was he holding John’s hand? Was it in an effort to let John down gently? John forced his face to remain as still as he could in an attempt to hide the warring feelings of anguish and disappointment over losing the room and the flutter of hope and desire that shot through him from the feel of Sherlock’s hand on his.
While Joy was content with her dog bed while John was downstairs and in his armchair, it would simply not do when he climbed the stairs for bed. After her leg had healed, she had followed him up, jumped on the bed, and made herself right at home at the foot of it. John had made one token effort to try and convince her that dogs didn’t belong on beds, but they both knew she was going to get what she wanted.
“If that game is too young for you, then we could play Doctor,” Sherlock purred in that deep voice, and honestly, it should be illegal to say things like that in his voice.
Anything he said would roll off the back of the oblivious detective, so it was best to just get whatever this was about over with. He took his razor and rinsed off the gathered cream. Then he tilted his face and started to shave the other side, methodically working his way back towards his chin. He had made three swipes with the razor before he realized Sherlock was still standing silently behind him. He glanced up at Sherlock’s reflection in the mirror and saw that he was examining John with the same intensity that he examined a murder victim. He ignored the flutter in his stomach at the heightened scrutiny.
John’s feet came to a standstill in the doorway as he took in the features of the man he hadn’t seen in several months. It wasn’t so much that they weren’t friends, really. John had forgiven him for the part he played in Sherlock’s downfall, eventually, when it was too obvious to ignore that Greg beat himself up for that role he played. When John had been able to look back with a head somewhat calmer, he could acknowledge that Greg was following orders, and didn’t believe that Sherlock was what they were claiming him to be.
John blinked up at her. Immediately, “We’re not a couple” jumped to his head, to the tip of his tongue, the years-old response to those who read more into his relationship with Sherlock than was there. It was a response born out of frustration. They weren’t a couple, never had been, no matter what his feelings on the matter were. He was content with their friendship and having it thrown into his face that they weren’t more, always hurt more than he would ever admit.
Joy was easy to buy for, as well. He may have gone a bit overboard, actually. He had started an online cart at one of those fancy pet websites and the pricetag was at a rather embarrassingly high number considering he was buying for one dog, but he felt absolutely no regret for those impending purchases. She would love the squeaky toys and the new chew toys that could be filled with peanut butter. And the little raincoat only made since. They lived in London and purchasing his dog a raincoat just made sense. He went back and forth on the necessity of the wellies.
“Maybe we can get chocolate later,” Sherlock told her as he handed her the muffin, which she grabbed and took a huge bite of.
“Well I’d love to see it when you calm down a bit,” John chuckled and she stilled long enough for him to see a flash of cloudy blue before she turned and ran towards Sherlock, jumping in his arms without hesitation, who deftly caught her and swung her up on his hip as he continued walking towards John.
When he stood outside the door to their flat, his hands were freezing (how had he forgotten his gloves?), and his hair was plastered to his forehead thanks to a sudden downpour he had found himself in. There had been three blocks left in his walk when it started.
Sherlock watched him leave, listened to the sound of his steps as he climbed the stairs to his room, then the creak and click of the door as it shut behind him.
“Sherlock,” John’s voice was low, throaty, and Sherlock savored how breathless he sounded. He had done that to him with just his mouth and hands. Already John sounded ravished and they had only just begun.
He jumped forward through memories and skipped to other relevant ones. Ones where outsiders saw more to their relationship than was there. It never bothered Sherlock when Mrs. Hudson alluded to a more intimate relationship between him and John, or when someone suggested they were together. John, however, always jumped to the defense. “We’re not a couple,” he would deny. “I’m not gay,” he would proclaim from the proverbial rooftop to anyone who suggested that he and Sherlock were more than just friends.
John nodded, then turned and made his way down the stairs and into the kitchen set at the back of the house. The kitchen was light and airy with clean white cabinets and buttery yellow walls. More windows here let in the light and there was a door set into the back wall. John opened it and found himself in another section of the garden. This one was clearly meant for kitchen use judging by the different herbs he could identify throughout. Rosemary, parsley, sage, thyme, basil. Others, too, and the smell was lovely and earthy and John simply breathed for a moment. They had needed this. A chance to get out of the city for a bit, with its exhaust and claustrophobia and the cloying scent of the Thames.
He wasn’t entirely sure what Mrs. Hudson was capable of if he didn’t get to work on the tree and he wasn’t keen on finding out, either. The woman was formidable, and when possible, he preferred to stay on her good side. He had ignored her gentle pushes for as long as he could and he wasn’t interested in seeing just how hard she could shove if he didn’t comply sooner rather than later.
One chocolate drip made it past his attempts to clean, though, and fell right on top of Sherlock’s knee. John reached out automatically with the napkin to spot clean the chocolate and barely heard the sharp intake of breath from the man.
“It wasn’t difficult. I researched his employees and figured out that his secretary had been involved in an illegal gambling bust several years ago. Apparently he wasn’t as reformed as the image he projected. Easy enough to track records and realize how he was stealing the money. It was pretty obvious, actually. The man’s hardly a master criminal or even a decent one. He barely knew how to cover his tracks,” Sherlock explained, and as he did, he realized that it was really too obvious. Mr. Campbell had to have known how the money was being stolen. The more he thought about it, the more he became convinced that the man had known, but when he was presented with a crime taking place, he took advantage of the situation as a way to reconnect with John.
John huffed a laugh at that and turned his head away to hide his smile. Sherlock turned to hide his smile as well.
“You take me so deep, John. You look so beautiful with my cock in your mouth. Your throat is so tight as you swallow me. Your hands on my arse, fingers tight and bruising as you push me into you. You want me to fuck your mouth. You want all of me.”
John put his mug and plate down on the table beside him. Sherlock put down his own plate and mug and stood up. He took the two steps to stand in front of John’s chair and carefully placed his hands on the arms of John’s chair before he leaned down further into John’s personal space.
He stepped closer and Sherlock seemed to hold his breath. John reached a hand up to his hair before gently pulling the dandelion free. “It’s just you still had a flower in your hair,” he explained as he held up the item in question.
Things like that changed a man. John knew that. And the more John observed, he saw the subtle changes in Sherlock that weren’t merely related to the passage of time or his physical injuries.
Sherlock stopped just outside the kitchen doorway, completely rooted to the spot as he took in the gentle swaying of John’s hips and the smooth cadence of his tenor blending with the singer coming from the speaker.
Sherlock was stretched out beside him on the blanket, eyes closed with his arms crossed beneath his head to serve as a pillow. He had set his jacket aside during their lunch, and John let himself admire the way the tailored button-down stretched across Sherlock’s chest. He had untucked the shirt before laying back, and every now and then a breeze ruffled the ends up and offered tantalizing flashes of smooth porcelain skin.
John had not expected to see Greg Lestrade sitting in his living room when he returned after his evening walk with Joy. He was sitting on the couch, blunt fingers tapping anxiously against the teacup in his hands that Mrs. Hudson must have supplied.
Sherlock was staring at the ground as if the meaning to life was written there in the mud and grey icy slush on their path. John stared at him, his flush of anger fading as he took in the diminished stance of the man beside him. The hunched shoulders, the bowed head, and John wasn’t sure if he was being manipulated into the emotions that followed after the anger, but he took a deep breath and tried to push it all back.
John sat back as the car started and pulled out of the abandoned area and back into the traffic of London. His hand tapped absently against his cane as his mind went over everything that had happened. This day felt more like something he had seen while watching a television drama than real life. A chance meeting with an old friend that led to a potential flatmate in central London when he could barely afford the abysmal bedsit he was in seemed too good to be true. Then it turned out the man was a veritable genius, clever and endearing in surprising ways, but then he was whisked off to a murder scene and left behind. And then, then, of all things, he was essentially kidnapped by some egotistical prat with a brolly who had stolen his therapist’s notes about him in an effort to get him to spy on his potential new flatmate.
John took one look at Sherlock’s wet hair, the curls nearly straight and a lot longer than John would have suspected, and couldn’t help the bubble of laughter that escaped. He felt giddy, lighter than air. Sherlock’s eyes immediately crinkled in response, his low chuckle joining in a moment later. John took a step closer to him, one hand lifting to brush the wet hair from Sherlock’s aqua green eyes, and pushed up on his toes to press a kiss to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock smiled, a small and shy thing that John adored.
Reality came crashing back in, all of John’s senses switching on to high alert, and it was all there. Underneath the fresh pine of the trees and boughs that decorated the flat, there was that scent that had always been in the background of 221B, but had faded after two years. Something citrusy, some kind of cologne or aftershave, John had never figured it out. His eyes scanned over the man in front of him.
“Ok, Peppa, look at this mess you made,” he said and Rosie giggled, then tried her best to snort like a pig.
Ah, there it was, Sherlock thought. ‘I’ve read about you’ is clearly ‘I read Dr. Watson’s blog’, which would explain why he seemed to keep looking for the blogger.
Sherlock had accepted that. Perhaps he had misread the signs. He knew what sexual attraction looked like, of course, but he misread cues sometimes. Hours before he had misread the Harry on John’s mobile as a brother instead of a sister. It happened. So he let it go, and they went on to become flatmates and friends.
Sherlock breathed deeply, refusing to flinch or acknowledge the dig, and kept walking until he found Lestrade.
Greg stood and John stood to follow him to the flat door. He offered his hand and Greg took it in a firm shake before heading down the stairs. John watched him and called out before Greg rounded the corner.
It was past midnight when Sherlock finally returned to 221B. He had wandered around London aimlessly during the hours he had been gone. His mind kept offering up imagined scenarios of what had happened between John and Alex after he had left. Alex would have confirmed that he wasn’t attached to anyone and John would have asked him to dinner or maybe to get drinks. Maybe at a future date, but maybe that very night. It had been early enough that they could have gone out then. Or perhaps they didn’t go out. They had a previous sexual relationship. Perhaps they had gone straight to John’s room. Or Alex had taken John back to his flat. Sherlock’s brain was more than happy to provide all manner of imagery for that scenario and for once he cursed his Mind Palace and its ability to provide all the details that he hadn’t yet had time to delete. These new images would be deleted as soon as he got a moment to go through them all.
Work had been a constant stream of flu and strep tests, runny noses, and one memorable ingrown toenail that could possibly give him nightmares. And he knew a thing or two about nightmares.
Sherlock pulls away this time for breath, and John feels the absence of his mouth acutely. Their eyes meet, and Sherlock’s lips quirked up as he reaches out and begins to unbutton John’s suit jacket, then pushes it off his shoulders and tossed it next to his on the couch.
“It’s just hard, for me. You get that, right? It’s hard for me, all of this. I trusted you and then you just...left. And I want to believe you that you didn’t have a choice or another option. But it’s hard.”
Another moment of silence passed and John had never been so thankful for how loud the water groaned through the pipes of their flat. Almost there…
“Yeah, fine. Not as smooth as I thought I was,” he answers with a laugh and Sherlock’s eyes sparkle with mirth.
When it became clear that Sherlock wasn’t going to add any more to his story, John glanced at him. “Well, I’d love to see it if you find it.”
Greg looked at him and gave a small nod. He finished his tea quickly and put the empty mug down on the table.
“This is going to need stitches,” John announced, still frowning. He turned to the kit beside him and pulled out the necessary supplies. “All I have is topical anesthesia. It only needs a couple of stitches, though. Think you can sit still for that?” he asked, looking back up at him from his kit.
“Soup should be ready,” he said before he stood up and got two bowls down and filled them. As he placed one of the bowls down in front of him Sherlock sneezed again.
“No. Not a case. I was just out dancing,” he said, and that seemed to get John’s attention enough that he looked up from his book.
“No, thanks. Nothing in particular. Just wanted to take a look around,” he replied, and the woman nodded.
It was several moments before Mrs. Hudson opened the door. Her hair was pinned atop her head, and her white frilly apron was protecting the purple dress she wore whenever she was working in the kitchen. The apron, not the dress. The enticing smell of sizzling sausage and hot coffee wafted throughout the flat.
It was 12 days in, and it had been a decent enough day. John had gone to work for a shift, came home to another delightful meal that Mrs. Hudson joined them for before she went back down to her flat, and then Sherlock pulled out the scotch and they had steadily made their way through the bottle since. He was warm and his muscles were sufficiently relaxed. They were sitting together on the couch and had just finished watching a news program when Sherlock leaned forward and closed the laptop.
He stood under the spray and let the warm water cover his face and hair and drown out any outside noise. When he reached for the shampoo he glanced through the curtain and saw the shadow of Sherlock as he stood near the sink.
“I wanted to be a pirate when I grew up. I didn’t have any gold, but I knew all pirates needed treasure, and I thought sea glass would be as good a treasure as anything else. A shard of glass that had changed its appearance through its time in the ocean. Became something special despite starting off as something no one wanted,” Sherlock said and there was a touch of sadness in the way he explained it that broke something in John’s heart. Sherlock cleared his throat. “So I would come down every day and look for pieces. I collected several hundred over the years. They should be in the house somewhere unless Mummy did something with them.”
“Sherlock, I swear to God if you,” John managed to get out, but the rest of his sentence was drowned out by the sound of the commode flushing and the water in his shower went instantly to freezing. “Damnit, Sherlock!” he roared as he jumped out of the now glacial spray. He was unable to reach the tap to turn off the water to escape. He flung open the curtain and jumped out where he found himself face to face with a very calm consulting detective, who stood before him holding a towel. John yanked it out of his hands and quickly rubbed the cold water from his face and body, nudity be damned. “I hate you,” he intoned flatly.
Sherlock invited him along constantly. Found countless ways to engage him in the Work, but it never seemed to be enough to sway his opinion on taking the room upstairs.
Sherlock nodded and went off to a different section of the house. John found the salad dressing and closed the fridge door. He finished setting the table and had called in Rosie to wash her hands before eating when Sherlock returned with a rather expensive looking bottle of merlot in his hands. He pulled the lasagna from the oven and prepared a plate for Rosie while Sherlock opened the bottle.
“You can’t grab me, that’s cheating!” He called out as Sherlock kept a hold of his ankle and twisted his body.
When he returned less than two hours later, just as John was ordering a pizza for their dinner because there was no way he wanted to cook in this heat, he briefly wondered what on earth he had done in his life that justified Sherlock as punishment.
Sherlock was sprawled across the couch when John got home from his shift. His hands were pressed together under his chin, but John noticed how they weren't actually touching his face. For once.
Sherlock stared at him, those clever eyes of his flashing silver in the dark that surrounded them, and John let Sherlock see him. He wanted Sherlock to see that he was telling the truth. That he believed him and forgave him. It was important that Sherlock understand that.
“Hey Johnny,” Alexander Campbell returned in a much softer voice than before, and Sherlock was immediately on the proverbial edge of his seat. No one called John “Johnny”, except for Harry. He hated it. Or at least, Sherlock thought he did.
Sherlock had taught her the song. He had been singing it to her since she was 3 or 4 months old. John had come home early from the clinic one afternoon and when he got up the stairs, he didn’t see his friend or his daughter. Just when he was about to head downstairs to see if Mrs. Hudson had her while Sherlock went God-only-knew-where, he had heard singing and the sound of feet pacing on the floor above him. In his bedroom. He had climbed the stairs to his room carefully, the voice getting louder but still soft. When he reached the top and peeked around the open door, he saw them.
They got takeaway and went back to Baker Street to eat. They ate, and talked, and laughed, and Sherlock was sure John would take the upstairs room now. But when dinner was finished and they had packed up the leftovers in the fridge, John had left.
Sherlock’s thumb made another pass and John quickly opened his mouth further and sucked the digit into his mouth. His tongue pressed against Sherlock’s thumb before he swirled it around the tip, his teeth biting down gently on the nail and the fleshy pad. Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered at the sensation and John couldn’t bite back his groan in response.
This chapter is significantly longer than the others, but I hope you all don't mind. Think of it as a two-hour-long special finale!
“So you have a boyfriend?” John asked as he again ignored the way his chest tightened at the potential answer.
“You know, I’ve been considering turning the upstairs bedroom into a laboratory,” he began. After the conversation about the kitchen, it seemed like a good place to start. He could purchase a small refrigerator and freezer for any experiments and specimens he might need. Perhaps that wasn’t as good a place to begin as he thought, though, because the expression on John’s face went from confused to some expression he couldn’t read. He swallowed hard. “So I was just thinking maybe you’d like to share my room instead. If you wanted, that is,” he continued, but John stayed silent. He kept his eyes locked on their hands, unable to meet his eyes, and he felt his stomach fall through the floor of the taxi as he clung to John’s hand. “It was just a thought,” he said and hated how small his voice came out.
“You’ll have to wait your turn,” Sherlock challenged and John grinned, twisting his head so that he could take Sherlock’s mouth in another kiss.
“Good luck convincing her to leave for any amount of time,” Sherlock said, nodding his chin towards Rosie as she concentrated on getting a pyramid of sand higher.
Rage was rippling under his skin like a thing alive as his eyes took in the sight Mycroft Holmes. He looked the same as when he last saw him two years ago as he raged at him for selling his brother out to a madman. As soulless and uncompromising as ever in a three-piece suit and shiny black shoes.
“No. No, nothing is wrong. I just...I wanted to tell you,” he said, his gaze still intent, and John had to look away and take a sip of his wine.
When he heard the water for the shower turn on he opened the laptop and waited impatiently while it booted up again. As soon as the screen was opened, Sherlock once again took in the visage of an incandescently happy John Watson. After a moment of indecision, he quickly copied the link for the page and emailed it to himself, then deleted the search history on the laptop. Luckily John wasn’t exactly the most tech-savvy and that would be more than enough to hide his internet trail.
“Look at you, pointing out stars and quoting Shakespeare. I wouldn’t have thought them important enough to bother remembering.”
John took a deep breath, letting the jealousy settle in his body for a moment before choosing to let it go with a nod.
“Learn anything new about gardening?” John asked quickly before sitting down on one of the armchairs across from the sofa.
John sent a heatless glare at Sherlock, who was visibly biting back a grin at the scene playing out before he turned back to Rosie. “If you and Sherlock eat all your dinner, then yes, we can go get ice cream after.”
“Not in those exact words,” he hedged. He didn’t want to explain the flowers to Mrs. Hudson right now. Or maybe ever. It had been something he did for Sherlock and he didn’t think he wanted to tell anyone else. There was something about it that just belonged to him, and he supposed to Sherlock as well. “But believe me, he knows. He doesn’t feel the same and that’s okay.”
“Then why are you here with me instead of at lunch?” she asked, confusion clear in her voice and face.
“He’ll like that one,” she approved as she settled a plate of the fresh biscuits on the table beside a pot of tea. “Come sit, sit. Have some tea with me.”
“Yeah, me too. He’s great.” Her smile grew a bit wider, but then she hid it behind her coffee cup. “How are you doing?” she asked.
“Hello, John,” she said, her nose wrinkling at the smell that had made its way out of his flat and now hung dully in the staircase and hallway. “What can I do for you?”
“So many times I’ve thought about your cock, John. Tried to deduce you. What you looked like, the shape and feel of you, what you would taste like. I’ve had so many fantasies about finding out. Coming up with experiments that would give me a reason to look at you. Hold you in my hand like this,” Sherlock whispered in his ear, his hand tight and giving a delicious twist on the upstroke.
At his movement, Joy had lifted her head, her ears perking up as she watched him before she stood and stretched on the bed, matching John’s own stretching movements as he stood up from the bed.
Mrs. Hudson was somewhat trickier. He wanted to get something thoughtful for her. Somehow, and God only knew how, his landlady had become an integral member of his life. One of the only integral members of his life, really. She had been there for him when he most needed a friend, and he was grateful to her. Yes, she occasionally overshared, she wasn’t shy about laying on guilt trips, and she always implied things that just weren’t true about John and his relationship to a certain curly-haired man, but she was quiet when John felt the need to talk, and would hold his hand in her smaller one when he couldn’t find the words, and made sure he ate when he couldn’t be bothered to feed himself. She took care of him without coddling him and she was possibly the only reason he hadn’t completely faded away into the shadows.
Sherlock blinked and opened his mouth, then shut it again. John patted the empty spot of mattress beside him.
Sherlock stood there, looking at him, and John watched him for what felt like forever as his words settled into his skin and bones. Sherlock was telling him what he never expected to hear. He had accepted what he thought he could have and now Sherlock was telling him that there was far more to be offered. That he could have it. He reached out and took one of Sherlock’s hands in his. His hand was warm and dry under John’s, which were still somewhat cold from being outside for so long. He took a deep breath and reminded himself that he could be brave when he needed to be.
Granted, it wasn’t usually do to the pain in his leg. He could actually walk pretty long distances with the cane. It was the looks he received from passersby on the street that really bothered him. He was too young to need a cane, too young to walk with a limp, and pitying looks of strangers did nothing to help his mood. Luckily, people in Rome didn’t seem to care as he trudged along. He ignored them, and they, blessedly, ignored him.
“So what’s the case?” he asked, and Sherlock finally looked at him as they stepped outside the doors and to the pavement outside the building. He approached the kerb and waved an arm, managing to snag a taxi in that way he almost always did.
Ah! Billy was missing. He went to the bedroom he had claimed as his own and rummaged around in one of the few unpacked boxes left there until he pulled out the familiar skull. He carried it into the sitting room and placed it on the left corner of the mantelpiece. Billy grinned at him in approval of his new spot and Sherlock smiled. Perfect.
“No, you stay here and have lunch. We’re here anyway. I’ll meet you back at the flat later,” he said, then turned, satisfied with the dramatic twirl he felt his coat give and hailed a taxi.
John walked back to the black car and let himself in, not surprised when the woman from before was sitting inside, still tapping away at her phone. “We’re to take you home,” she spoke as he settled on the smooth leather cushion, and he nodded.
John groaned into his pillow as her small body bounded onto the mattress, bouncing wildly between the small space left between him and Sherlock, and sang some version of Santa Claus is Coming to Town with her own choice of lyrics.
Warm palms came up to cradle his face and John’s breath caught in his chest as Sherlock’s sea glass gaze held his. “Do you understand, John?”
Dinner had been a lovely affair, with a home-cooked meal and a bottle of red wine that clearly wasn’t the cheapest available. There had been candles on the small kitchen table in the flat, and the conversation, flirting, and wine had been free-flowing and generous. They had even opened a second bottle of wine, which wasn’t as nice as the first, but John wasn’t going to complain. He was feeling delightfully lightheaded, his limbs loose and languid, and was absolutely thrilled with how the evening was progressing.
“John,” he answered, turning towards him and pushing a hand into the pocket of his great coat. “I could ask you the same question.”
“You forgot how cranky you get when you’re hungry,” Sherlock reminded him and John laughed as he squeezed his hand.
Still, they had been able to move on. He had slowly earned John’s trust again, and while they weren’t completely at their old level of camaraderie, they were close to getting there.
He wasn’t sure why he had started. He really should have known better by then. But, well, sometimes he just really enjoyed a good wank in the shower. Especially after a rather exhilarating chase on foot and the solid tackle of a suspect that his old rugby mates would have been proud of. Adrenaline was still coursing heavily through his veins and he just needed a release. He needed a shower first, though.
They managed to snag a small table with two chairs outside. Rosie moved from Sherlock’s hip to his knee while they enjoyed their cold treats. They spoke of nothing important and it was one of those evenings that John loved where they just spent time together and the conversation never felt strained.
“Interesting, that soldier fellow,” his brother’s voice came out smoothly without waiting for a greeting.
“The view. It’s beautiful,” he said, eyes lingering on Sherlock for a moment before he turned his eyes back to the horizon where it was now a light pink as the sky itself brightened to a soft blue.
If there had been any worry that Sherlock was a really good hallucination and not actually there, that bag in his fridge put it to rest. Soundly.
So, John packed himself and Rosie a bag, and two days later they had pulled up to a small cottage on the coast.
When he met Mary, he thought maybe he could turn his miserable existence around again. It wasn’t perfect, but she seemed to accept his flaws and they made it work. He told himself he was in love with her. Just another little lie he told himself. He should have realized earlier how bad he was at lying. He never should have married her. But he wouldn’t give up Rosie for the world, so it didn’t matter anyway.
“True, but I’ve never had sex with my husband,” John replied as he started to pull the sheet off of Sherlock’s body, revealing miles of lovely bare skin and tight black silk pants. He crawled onto the bed and over Sherlock’s body. He nuzzled into Sherlock’s neck, breathing in the clean skin and the unique smell that was Sherlock. He pressed a kiss into his neck as he let his weight settle over Sherlock.
Time had no meaning. His chest was on fire, his heart slamming against his ribs, his throat tight, his eyes burning as he pinched them closed, the tears leaking through regardless. He let out a scream, but there was no one to hear him, no one to care, and it did him no good, so he clutched his hair tighter, trying to center himself.
He wasn’t sure if he had managed to keep it, but he hoped the paper would be enough of a distraction.
John stood under the hot spray of the shower, hoping that the water would work its subtle magic and help him to rid the images of Sherlock with a knife at his throat. John had almost been too late. It had been too close of a call. He had taken off, his long legs catching up to their suspect moments before John could, but those moments had been enough for the man to pull a knife and somehow manage to get his hands on the detective. Behind his closed eyes he could still see the well of blood that had risen on Sherlock’s throat as the man brandished his blade. If John had been a second later…
“I’ll tell you what. You think about the answer. If you come up with one and you still want me to kiss you tomorrow, then we can talk about it then.”
She climbed onto the bed, crawled past him, and settled right beside Sherlock, pulling the duvet out and tucking herself in against his body. Sherlock’s eyes drifted from her to John and John shrugged with an apologetic smile. Rosie always crawled into bed with John during thunderstorms, and it appeared that night would be just like any other. It didn’t phase her for a moment that Sherlock was there. She was already most of the way back to sleep when John sighed, pulled the duvet up, and settled beneath it himself. He lay down facing Sherlock, who watched the entire scene silently. John raised his brows and wiggled a bit of the duvet at him.
“You used to be better at following me without me realizing it. I thought you wouldn’t bother with that anymore.”
“I saw the way you looked at me downstairs. I’ve hurt you and I don’t even know what I did wrong,” Sherlock spoke quietly, hands clasped together in his lap. He refused to look up.
Sherlock took in all these details and made his deductions within the seconds it took for the man to fully enter the room.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she evaded and John snorted a laugh.
The action actually had John choke back a sudden laugh. Sherlock had once done something very similar on a case. He had knelt down on all fours, his sensitive nose close to a box rather like the one Joy was occupied with, and he had sniffed and moved to different angles until he finally identified what he was smelling.
“Why did you leave earlier?” John’s voice was soft, questioning, from behind him. Sherlock hesitated a moment before he turned back.
“Yeah,” John confirmed, turning back to his meal as he only had so long to enjoy his lunch, after all.
He wasn’t sure when the conversations that took place there began to change. Sometime after the "Incident", for sure. It had been gradual, he knew that, but no specific fixed point stood out in his mind. It used to only be about cases or that rather ridiculous time with the milk. Slowly, though, it evolved into more. John would be showering, and suddenly Sherlock would be there in the room discussing the results of his latest experiment, or what he hoped his next one would accomplish.
“Yes, and just imagine, next time you can just go upstairs and collapse on the mattress instead of jumping on the tube for a 30-minute ride below London.”
“John, I…,” Sherlock started, but then Mrs. Hudson came into the room, tea tray in hand, and Sherlock stopped talking.
Well, that just sealed that it was Sherlock. Even in a text, the man commanded a presence and a certainty that his demands would be met. John sighed. In this instance, it actually would be. He wanted to tell Sherlock about this man who’s trying to pay people to spy on him, then he was going to tell him in no uncertain terms that he would not be taking the flat, and he would go back to his bedsit and figure out his life later.
The dog turned to look at him, tail picking up speed as if in recognition of the moniker, and she hobbled over to him. John bent down to scratch behind her ear and she leaned into his hand, the picture of contentment.
Earl Grey. A mixture of colognes and perfumes. Cigar smoke. Gasoline. Cold air. Lemon verbena shampoo.
Sherlock seemed to sense his hesitation, his refusal of the room, but before either of them could speak Mrs. Hudson came bursting out of her flat in a tizzy.
Maybe it wasn’t sun or Rosie, then. John pushed the thought from his mind, that line of thinking leading down a dangerous road, and he cleared his throat before giving a more forced smile than he had previously had.
He dreamed of the unrepentant force of gravity and woke with the memory of another pair of dead eyes.
“I used to hunt for sea glass as a boy,” Sherlock’s deep voice suddenly disclosed and John turned to look at him.
“An attempt to say what I haven’t been able to tell you before. You spoke to me in flowers. Your anger and your hurt, in the beginning. Your guilt. I wish you hadn’t felt guilty. It wasn’t your fault and I’m sorry my actions made you feel like they were. But your messages starting to change. You left a different kind of flower. I thought maybe I could try and explain who you are to me the same way.”
Their laughter eventually died down, hiccoughing into the random chuckle until both were left with content smiles on their faces, the color high on both of their cheeks. Rosie continued to build sandcastles in the near distance while the surf lapped at their ankles.
And he was terrified of his feelings for Sherlock. Well, not the feelings themselves. He had long ago accepted that he was in love with his best friend. No, he was worried about his friend knowing the actual depth of those feelings. It was obvious they cared for one another, and anyone who ever spent more than a minute with Sherlock in Rosie’s company could see how much he loved, truly loved, and adored her. But brotherly love, whether of blood or choice, and love of a child are not the same as romantic love. He knew Sherlock loved him, but that didn’t mean Sherlock loved him beyond the bounds of their friendship. He had accepted that, but he did live in fear that Sherlock would one day realize that John’s love for him went beyond their agreed parameters. Their “married to my work” and “I’m not gay” boundaries. He’d had his sexual identity crisis before Sherlock fell and had made a shaky agreement with himself that even though he had never been attracted to a man before, he was very much attracted to his flatmate, and that that was okay. That it was all fine. After he fell, and Ella confronted him with the simple task of voicing those things he wanted to tell Sherlock and never did, he finally admitted out loud that he had been in love with his best friend. Not to her, of course, but to the quiet of the bedsit he had moved to when Baker Street held too many ghosts. He admitted to being completely and utterly head over heels for the man.
“I need things to keep Sherlock occupied. I was hoping that if I have whatever you can give me I can keep him inside.”
“It’s not your job to know, Dr. Watson. It’s your job to do your duty when called upon. And you will be called upon. Very soon.”
He pointed to the red plastic beach pail that she was nearly standing on top of and when she spotted it she giggled.
He shook his head. John knew that nothing he said right now would make a difference to him, so he didn’t even bother explaining that three patches was a horrible decision. Besides, he had other things he needed to say right now.
It was the site for the latest fundraiser where Mr. Campbell’s clinic was a recipient. He had just finished reading the “About Us” section when his mobile pinged and he went immediately to his texts.
He picked at the food on his plate mindlessly. He did appreciate the potstickers. When he was finished eating he got up and took the empty plate to the sink. He looked through the containers of food still on the table, then packed them away and put them in the refrigerator. He grabbed a clean rag and quickly wiped down the table of stray grains of rice. When that wasn’t enough to keep his mind busy, or rather unbusy, he found the broom and swept the floor as well. Then he looked towards the sink that held his dirty dinner plate, as well as John’s plate and fork from his own dinner and a couple of tea mugs, so he went ahead and washed them while he was there. Despite what he would have John think, he didn’t actually mind washing the dishes. He was just putting the last mug on the rack to dry, glittering suds sticking to the backs of his hands, when he heard the front door open and John’s steady tread on the stairs. He grabbed the towel that hung on a hook on the cabinet under the sink and had just finished drying his hands when John entered into the kitchen.
Thanks to an early end to his shift, it was still light outside when he finished his shopping, and he decided to walk for a bit before heading back home. The shop was actually rather close to the cemetery where Sherlock was laid to rest, and since he was close anyway, he decided to make his way there.
“You know how they don’t leave notes? This one did,” the stranger replied without any further information. “Will you come?”
“So me and Mrs. Hudson, Greg? Your family, obviously,” John said, and couldn’t help the small note of anger that slipped into his voice at the mention of Sherlock’s family, his brother. He shook his head at himself. It didn’t matter. “What about Molly?”
“Yes, I can see the secondhand embarrassment blush on your cheeks,” John teased before he flicked his tongue over one of Sherlock’s nipples, then bit gently on the rounded nub.
Rosie nodded her agreement to his statement. “I found a new snail, too! Maybe Ice Cream and the new one can be friends!”
He loved times like this. Watching and listening to Sherlock play had somehow become a part of his life that he couldn’t imagine not having. It soothed a part of his soul that would always hurt. Chasing after Sherlock had cured his limp. Sherlock’s music settled his mind when it was all too much.
John rinsed out a tea mug and flipped it upside down to dry on the rack by the sink, still singing, then turned off the water, patted his hands dry on the towel by the sink left for such a purpose, and turned. He blinked in surprise at Sherlock’s appearance at the doorway, but instead of turning off the music as he would normally do, he offered Sherlock a small smile as another refrain of the chorus began.
She crossed the room and laid them out on the table. John quieted, but let the smile linger on his face.
Sherlock glanced at her, then nodded and made himself comfortable on the other side of the beach blanket from John. Long legs stretched out in front of him and he leaned back on his palms as he kept his eyes on his goddaughter.
“Alex is still very much attracted to you, John, and more than interested in taking up where you left off. If it was any more obvious he’d have a glowing neon sign above his head. I simply thought it best to give you two the room you need to reestablish your previous relationship.”
“I could use a coffee. Do you want to get out of here?” he asked, and her brows shot skyward instantly.
John laughed, shoved his hands in his pockets, and fell into pace beside Sherlock in a way that was more muscle memory than a conscious decision. Laughing was good. Talking was good. What they had, what they could grow again, would be enough. It had to be.
It was the same. John still called him “amazing” with that look of wonder on his face. He still laughed and giggled in the post-buzz excitement of a chase. He still ordered the pork potstickers Sherlock liked best even though John preferred the shrimp.
“Up, please.” Rosie pulled her hand from John’s and turned to reach up to Sherlock, who bent down and lifted her easily before propping her on his hip. One small hand immediately went to Sherlock’s hair and she played with his curls, only earning one gentle reminder to please not pull. She stayed there happily until after they placed their order.
A year ago, John had almost wished the bullet that ended his career had ended his life instead. Three months ago, he was reminded that being alive might not be so bad. Three months ago, he was thankful that the bullet that ended his previous life brought him to a new one. One that he never imagined for himself, but could now no longer imagine any other way. He held the hand in his hand tightly and leaned against Sherlock as he sat beside him in the back of the taxi, the warmth of his body seeping into John’s skin where they pressed against each other. He was tired and wanted the rest that one seeks after emotional exhaustion. He let his eyes fall closed and his head rest against Sherlock’s shoulder. He breathed in the familiar scent of his friend. The subtle notes of something citrus and herbal, the leather of his favorite chair, the chemicals that he often worked with, and some deeper scent that was purely Sherlock. It reminded him of Baker Street. He released a breath that was more sigh than simple exhalation.
He sipped at his tea as a hand absently rubbed at his chest. It didn’t hurt as much as it used to, to think about Sherlock. Which was a good thing, really, because John thought about him all the time. An attractive woman flirted and winked at him, and instead of being able to engage or encourage the behavior from her, he sat in his office remembering someone else who used to wink and flirt with him, though he knew it wasn’t really flirting, not really, when it came to Sherlock.
They swayed to the rhythm of the song, their bodies flush from thighs to chests as they circled slowly. Sherlock breathed in the familiar scent of John once again, his arms tightening around him slightly as John carefully pressed his cheek to Sherlock’s shoulder.
He threw his head back, breathing heavily but trying to hide that fact, his ears ringing, while he waited for his brain to kick back online. That was quite possibly the best orgasm he had ever had in a shower.
“There’s our man. Taxi. Clever. Why is that clever?” he asked himself as much as John, and when the taxi began to take off, he jumped up and called for John to hurry and come along, and they swept out the door quickly.
John frowned, looking down at the dog that had curled up in front of the hearth, soaking up the heat from the fire. Her injured leg was resting comfortably, he supposed, and the wrapping seemed to have worked, at least for the moment. She had hobbled after him gingerly all morning.
Once outside, he took a few more photos with his camera, walking around the perimeter and taking photos at different angles. He wasn’t sure why he was bothering to take that many as he most likely wouldn’t bother to ever print them, but he wanted to remember this trip, and pictures seemed as good a way to remember as any other. Well, he did have his laptop. Maybe he would write up his little adventure on the blog that his therapist kept insisting he should write and he kept insisting would be an utter waste of time as he had absolutely nothing to write about.
They piled into the back of the taxi and Sherlock gave the address to Baker Street. The cabbie pulled out into the traffic and they made their way to the other side of the city. They sat in silence for some time. John’s thoughts wandered over everything that had happened to him in the last several months. It was nearly a year since he had been shot and invalided out of the army.
He hardly felt the first pull of the blade against his cheek. John was confident, precise, methodical in his shaving. Sherlock trusted him completely. He trusted John's surgeon hands; his soldier hands. The hands that could save a life with a scalpel or end it with a gun.
He had felt a flicker of some emotion, then. Anger, he thought. Anger at Sherlock for leaving, and at Mycroft for meddling, but it faded into the background as everything else had in the haze that surrounded those first few months after Sherlock’s death.
“Your archenemy, apparently. Do people have archenemies?”John asked his tone a mix of incredulous and actual curiosity.
The weather had been mild enough that he elected to walk the forty minutes to Sherlock’s grave. It gave him time to think over anything he might want to tell the man, and he usually had a lot to say. Things that he hadn’t told anyone before. Things that he hadn’t been able to say out loud. Things that he’d never get the chance to say, so he reckoned he might as well say them now.
But Sherlock didn’t want everything that John would undoubtedly end up giving, and John wasn’t ready to follow that path all the way to its undeniable dead end.
Sherlock turned his eyes back to his laptop screen and he tried his best to ignore the older woman. He hadn’t invited her to stay for tea for this kind of conversation. He had assumed she would just natter on about Mrs. Turner next door or her recent troubles with the radiator or some such. Something that he could mainly ignore while he worked. She was usually satisfied with a properly timed “hmm” or “oh”. It made her ideal for this kind of boring background research when John wasn’t there to entertain him.
“You’d leave London?” John asked, completely caught off guard at the turn in the conversation. He ignored the way his stomach twisted in on itself.
“That’s still cheating,” John grumbled, but he let it pass as he pulled the spinner closer to flick the little plastic piece that held his fate in its nonexistent hand.
“How did I do?” he asked, unable to quell his desire to know if all of his deductions had been accurate.
John slipped the key in and unlocked the door, then gathered his boxes again and they made their way up the seventeen steps to 221B. They dropped off the boxes and suitcase just inside the door and John glanced at him before he took a step closer. He reached around him to push the door to the flat closed, his body pressing against him as he leaned forward. Another step closer and Sherlock took a step back, eyes locked on John as he crowded him against the door. The heat between their bodies and in John’s eyes was scorching as the smaller man reached up to run a thumb along his cheek. Sherlock’s hands fell to his hips, holding lightly, thumbs circling absently.
Unable to get a read on what was going on that he was satisfied with, he turned to go to the kitchen and return to his microscope. Of course, nothing on the microscope actually held his attention like the proceedings that took place in the living room.
“I hate repeating myself. I’m trying to explain that statistically sharing a flat with a relative stranger,” he  began but was cut off by the sound of heavy footsteps running up the stairs. Ah, Lestrade. He glanced at John, though his attention was turned towards the opened door of the flat.
“Must be a neighbor or something. I’ll be right back,” she said, leaning back in for a quick kiss before she rose to her feet. “Stay right there…,” she whispered against his lips with a flirtatious giggle. John watched her walk towards the door and the steady source of knocking. He glanced at the television, then let his thoughts wander to how to move this to the bedroom when a deep baritone that had absolutely no business being anywhere near this place filtered into his hearing.
“Rue the day that comes,” John said with a wry smile, and Sherlock smirked at him before he turned away to presumably walk to his chair.
“Ah, John, you’re here. Can I borrow your phone? I need to send a text,” Sherlock’s deep voice came from the sofa, and John found him lying there in complete repose.
“Just think. There are so many fun ways to stop from being bored now,” Sherlock proclaimed, a twinkle in his eyes, and John smiled as Sherlock twined their fingers together and led them down the hall to his room.
“Stop thinking. It’s fine. It’s all fine,” he says, and John feels something akin to relief wash over him at the statement. After that, the tension that had seemed to sit over their table broke, and they fell into their usual easy conversation and banter. John stopped thinking, and dinner went smoothly after that.
“Daddy, it’s my favourite. Obviously,” she stated, and John turned to look at his friend who had the decency to look mildly guilty at the new word that had been added to his daughter’s ever-increasing vocabulary.
Mycroft watched him, his hand twirling his idiotic umbrella on the floor of the car, before he smirked at him.
“Well, I certainly hope not. I’m nowhere near done with you, John,” he spoke softly as John passed, and John turned to him for a moment, unsure what to make of the comment. He settled for a quiet huff, a non-answer, and a small smile, then went after Rosie who had already let herself into the flat.
When they finally caught the taxi Sherlock quickly deduced it wasn’t their murderer and with a quirky “Welcome to London!” thrown at the traveler, they promptly raced back to Baker Street and collapsed against the wall of the landing in hysterical giggles. John’s blood was singing in his veins at the thrill of it all. The mad dash through London following Sherlock Holmes was the happiest he had been since he had been shot.
He slammed the laptop lid closed, then put it down on the table beside the cold tea and stood up, irritated at the tea, the phone, the laptop, the case, and himself for being irritated at any of it at all. He was used to being irritated with the world at large and its idiotic occupants. It was a newer feeling to be irritated with his own self. He made his way through the kitchen and down the hallway to his bedroom to grab his mobile. It pinged again just as he reached it and he quickly tapped in his passcode and unlocked the screen.
I'm sorry for the late update. My laptop was appropriated for most of the day and I just got time to work on this. I'm not 100% in love with this chapter, but it's the best I've got for now. Thank you so much for reading!
Showers, the kind where the water is so hot that flesh flushed red with the heat and felt like it could melt from the bones, where anxiety and the clutter of unpleasant thoughts washed down the drain along with the dirt and sweat of a day well lived, were one of the simple pleasures that John looked forward to. A chance to simply be alone, to breathe, to be in his body if he wanted, or out of it if he did not. To think or not think as he needed.
Sherlock watched as he picked up his needle and thread, then set to work. A small flinch, from anticipation rather than pain, and John paused, eyes on him.
“So get out of here and get them!” He yelled through the vinyl shower curtain, but the shadow of his flatmate didn’t move.
He had no other family to visit whether he wanted to or not and the list of friend’s that he would spend any kind of time with during Christmas was exactly one, now that he wasn’t dead. Well, and Joy, of course.
He shook those thoughts away as he filled the kettle with water for tea. He got down mugs and bags while the water heated up and tried to keep his thoughts from wandering too far again. He could just hear Sherlock as he settled Rosie down for her nap and her requests for the blanket to lay a certain way, the pillow to be fluffed to optimum fluffiness, her stuffed rabbit to be tucked in as well. John couldn’t decipher Sherlock’s deep baritone replies, but Rosie soon stopped her requests and he could hear the steady rhythm of the story as he began to read.
The skeletons dancing with festive hats across the bright turquoise paper were positively atrocious and John couldn’t wait to see Sherlock’s face when he saw his wrapped gift.
John groaned, lowering his head into his hands as he pulled his knees up. Fuck. His heart was pounding, his throat raw from where he had been screaming for the man to wait, and it took everything in him to not scream again in frustration.
The man didn’t look at all impressed or surprised by his comment. “You miss the war, Dr. Watson. When you walk beside Sherlock Holmes you see the battlefield,” he intoned as if John had never spoken.
John tilted his head to change the angle of the kiss as his hands came up and fisted into the lapels of Sherlock’s suit jacket and pulled him closer. One of them made a noise, a groan deep in the back of the throat, and Sherlock didn’t know who it was, but it didn’t matter. The sound triggered the opening of a floodgate. Years of misunderstanding, of wanting and denying, crashed over both of them and there was too much space between them.
He should have realized sooner that it would just be another part of his life that a certain consulting detective would invade upon.
His curry arrived 40 minutes later as he was scraping what was supposed to have been the base for a cottage pie into the bin.
Sherlock watched him hungrily, his eyes every bit as sharp and calculating as they were at a crime scene, and John felt nearly transcendent at being the recipient of that gaze. He took more of Sherlock into his mouth, letting his throat relax to prove to Sherlock that his fantasy could be reality. He didn’t stop until his nose was buried in the dark curls at the base of his cock and he breathed in the smell of the man, of Sherlock, there. He pulled back and off, then licked from base to tip as Sherlock watched him.
“What do you think you’re doing?” John asked when he found Sherlock in the large bed after his shower. He hadn’t bothered to put on pants and stood naked beside the bed already half-hard.
When he was within view of Baker Street, his phone had pinged with three other texts that he had ignored. He opened the door, noting that Mrs. Hudson was out, as he pulled off his scarf and coat to hang them on their hook. As he climbed the seventeen steps, focusing on each stair, he deliberately stepped on the squeaky fourth step and the creaky eleventh for no other reason than to hear the sound in the otherwise silent space. He pushed the door open to the empty flat, walked immediately to the kitchen, and filled the kettle for tea.
The light was soft and it was warm and inviting inside. He found himself smiling without meaning to as he made his way down the first tight aisle of books.
Joy whined again, resting her head on his bed as he scratched behind her ears, breathing slowly, in and out. In and out. His heart rate slowed, the tight band that had constricted his chest easing its hold on him, and he opened his eyes as the last of the dream faded from his mind.
He looked over at his clock and sighed. Three in the morning. Damnit. He turned, pushing himself off the bed, and pulled on his dressing gown to combat the chill that had settled in the flat before he went down to the kitchen. He filled the kettle and sat at the table. The sound of Joy’s nails clicking down the stairs as she followed after him was sharp in the quiet of the flat and he gave a small smile as she made her way over to him and curled up on the floor at his feet.
He wasn’t sure how much time passed as John stood there with his eyes still closed, but suddenly his quiet voice broke the silence.
“It is always nice to have a friend,” Sherlock agreed, and John didn’t miss the verdigris eyes that shifted up to him for a moment before he turned his attention back to Rosie. “We’ll have to put Ice Cream where you found the new one tomorrow before we leave.”
For someone who so quickly shot him down, Sherlock keeps managing to ruin all of John’s dates. This wasn’t the first date that Sherlock had come barreling into with demands and pleas and reasons for why the date must be cut short this instant. Sherlock had managed to break up nearly all of John’s dates and was the cause of more than one eventual breakup when John had managed to convince a woman that a relationship with him would be worth the trouble of dealing with his roommate. Apparently, it never was worth it, in the end.
True to his word, Sherlock did sit and watch as John packed up his meager belongings. John rolled his eyes at his friend and his lack of help, but he couldn’t even be annoyed with it. He was quietly ecstatic to finally be leaving this awful bedsit with its beige walls and its silent witness to the lowest points of John’s life. It took a little over an hour to pack his books and clothes, a few random mementos from his time in the army and the one picture of his family that had set in a downturned frame at the bottom of a drawer in his desk. Somehow, the few other possessions he knew he had were already at Baker Street, like his laptop and his favorite tea mug. He didn’t think too deeply about why that was.
There were things that needed to be said, spoken aloud for them both to hear, but there would be time for words later. At that moment, they moved on instinct alone. It was time for feeling, for showing, for proof of life. For breathless moans and clinging embraces that would end in bruises on both of their bodies.
He took a sip from his nearly empty wine glass, fingers tapping thoughtfully on his phone. No missed texts. If it was a case, surely Sherlock would have messaged him. In fact, John was fairly positive that Sherlock took any case he could if it timed well with one of John’s dates, even the ones, and twos. He had too much proof to go on. So why hadn’t he texted? Was he in trouble?
“She said we have a beautiful family. You and Rosie are my family. There was nothing else to say except ‘thank you’.”
Yes, he did love Sherlock. Had loved him. But he wasn’t under any illusions that Sherlock ever loved him. He believed Sherlock cared for him, of course, in the way he could. He believed Sherlock saw him as a friend.
“She went through a lot of trouble for just a weekend,” he chuckled and Sherlock smiled at him for a moment before he walked back out of the room and towards the end of the hallway.
John smiled and obliged his daughter, whisking her up in his arms and giving her a hug and kiss. Sherlock followed her into the kitchen and was watching them both.
She went out to her living room and fussed about with her advent wreath. She would light the last candle tonight and get the story from them over some mulled wine.
“Stay on the sand, Rose!” he called after her, then turned his attention to Sherlock who was turning to go back after her again. “We can watch her from here. Come sit down.”
“I think Mrs. Hudson may be trying to kill me slowly through baked goods. Death by sweets. Almost every day she’s shown up with some new biscuit she’s made or cake she’s baked.”
Yet he knew deep in his bones he wouldn’t betray the man even if he did. There was something magnetic about Sherlock, and John was drawn to him in spite of himself.
Mrs. Hudson’s eyebrows rose at the question. “Was he not? He looked so similar to the others I just assumed I suppose,” she gabbed and Sherlock cut her off again.
He had known Sherlock for real, just as John had. He just hadn’t had the luxury of being able to defy anyone who believed otherwise.
“I’ll be there in a moment. You two go ahead,” the taller man answered, not quite meeting John’s eye.
Now he just needed to sign some paperwork with his previous landlord. Maybe find something to do to mess with Lestrade. He had seen the papers and knew what the man was working on. He was annoyed that the DI hadn’t come to him for help yet, especially after he had managed to send off those texts. Clever bit of technology, that, and he didn’t even bother to text him back. Well. It was only a matter of time.
“Honestly, I don’t know if she’ll notice a difference. You’ve always been there. Nothing will change for her.”
Sherlock had left him all the money from his cases. John didn’t know how or why. Anthea had shown up one day with a folder and paperwork for him to sign. He didn’t bother reading any of it before he grabbed a biro and signed the dotted line in a rush to shove her out of his flat. It was foolish, really, to sign anything that came from Mycroft without reading it, or probably just throw it in the fire to burn, but it had been done. The next day he noticed a significant increase in his bank account. When he went to pay the rent, Mrs. Hudson informed him it had been paid in full for the next year, all utilities as well, and he stared at her for several moments before turning out of her flat, out the front door, and down the pavement.
“Swing me, please!” she corrected, then ran forward and John and Sherlock pulled up their arms a bit to allow her a moment of airtime, legs kicking wildly, before bringing her back down where she giggled. “Again, again!”
John squared his shoulders again and put on what he hoped was his most earnest expression. He took a deep breath before he spoke.
John nodded his acceptance of the thanks. “Thanks for cleaning up. I was going to do it when I got back.”
Then there he was, standing in front of John, eyes sweeping over him and clearly reading everything from his undone buttons to his pinkened lips. John barely kept himself from jumping off the couch.
Oh, that was delightful. John had essentially been kidnapped by his overreaching, overbearing older brother and the man hadn’t been intimidated at all. He had refused any kind of bribe. Somewhat surprising, given his lack of funds and not knowing him enough for any kind of personal loyalty to be in effect. Just a part of his personality, it would seem. That was good. A man who couldn’t be bought when he was down on his luck was something to be commended.
John offered a half-smile and removed his hand and the napkin from his knee. “We’ll need to treat that when we get back or it will stain.”
All he knew were Sherlock’s hands on his hips as he held him close, the taste of him on his lips, the sounds he made when John scraped his nails down his back and sunk his fingers in the glorious roundness of his arse, the way his body arched against him.
“Whoa, Watson, settle down. You’re completely filthy,” he chided and plopped her on his knee without any regard to his fine clean clothes or the mud all over her, and completely ignoring John’s aborted attempt to remind him of that fact. “Did you find anything interesting?”
Rosie rounded on him instantly. “Please, Daddy? Please can we have chocolate ice cream?” she begged, eyes pleading and her small fists held together under her chin, little fingers crushing the muffin that was still held in them.
The vision was still there. Joy was wagging her tail, oblivious to the fact that her owner was clearly having a psychotic break, and really, it had been a long time coming. John should be happy that he lasted as long as he did.
“As soon as you want. Whenever you’re ready. Tomorrow or in ten years. It doesn’t matter to me. It’s enough just knowing that you want to marry me.”
, he thought. He was so close and there was no way he was going to stop now. He closed his eyes as he thrust harder into his fist.
He made his way through a side entrance and down to the morgue in search of Molly. There was no body for him to look at, of course, but he did think it would be a good idea for him to be seen here by someone on the off chance John ever asked anyone about the case he made up.
“Where do you even find these kinds of flowers in the middle of winter in London?” he finally asked, because he didn’t know what else to say, and the silence that had been growing between them felt suffocating.
“You make me so happy,” John quietly confessed. “I can hardly believe you’re here with me. That you’re mine and I’m yours.”
“Oh, I didn’t see that. I’m going to look for more!” she proclaimed before she grabbed the bucket and ran back off to the waterline.
John brought his elbows up on the table and leaned his head down into his hands as he stared at the tabletop. So, it wasn’t just them. It was John, too. John was the liability. John was the cause. He choked off a bitter laugh. Of course, he would be the cause of his own heartache. Everything was always his fault. He was filled with dismay, but honestly, it just felt like most days of his life.
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asked as their laughter calmed down, and John smiles as he nods his head.
He tried to convince himself that that was a good thing. Stability and safety and all that shit. He didn’t believe it, but he tried to, anyway.
John’s heart ached in the best of ways as he watched the two people he loved most in all the world. A love that was spoken aloud endlessly for one and unspoken for the other. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He had told Sherlock he loved him, years ago. He had told him when he asked him to be his best man at his wedding to Mary. “The two people I love most in the world,” he had said in the kitchen of 221B. He had lied to himself for so long at that point that he actually had believed that. That he loved them both equally and that he could have them both.
“It turns out there’s room for more than just the work in my life,” Sherlock stated plainly and John bit his lip to hold back his grin, but it was a wasted effort.
Sherlock turns to his side, his eyes locked on John’s and he smiles. “That was hardly our first date, John,” he says. He leans in and gently presses his lips to John’s, and John smiles into the kiss.
Another name that he really had no reason to write down, for several reasons, but he liked seeing his friend’s name written in his hand. His name looked good on the list of those important enough to consider buying gifts for.
John could hardly believe most days that he was allowed to have Sherlock in his life again, much less that he was allowed, and encouraged, to have him this way.
John blinked, taking that information in slowly. Sherlock hadn’t mentioned Molly last night when he discussed what he had been doing while he was dead. John swallowed hard on a feeling that felt very much like jealousy that roared through his body at the fact that Molly had been trusted to keep Sherlock’s secret. He had to look away from Sherlock, then, because he knew he couldn’t hide that emotion, and he didn’t want Sherlock to think he was angry again. Even though he was. Hurt, and angry, again.
“Have a seat, Dr. Watson,” the man offered coolly as John came to a stop a couple of meters away from him. “Your leg must be bothering you.”
“Yeah, just um, text me if you need help with anything for Alex’s case. I only have a half shift, so I'll be off at 1.”
The plume of smoke that wafted out of the oven was both terrifying and almost nostalgic. John couldn’t count the times that one of Sherlock’s experiments ended (and occasionally began) with odorous blooms of smoke that filled their kitchen before finally dissipating through the windows that would be thrown open.
What he didn’t expect when he walked in was John sitting in his chair. He was leaning back against the Union Jack pillow, legs crossed, completely relaxed as he sipped at a cup of tea, and held an open paperback in his lap. It was one he had clearly read several times before. The spine was cracked in multiple places and was even pulling away from the glue in the corners.
It was the domestic soundtrack of his life in 221B with one Dr. John Watson. A melody he was as familiar with as the ones he coaxed from his violin. An aria that filled the hole that had been carved into his consciousness during his time away. It was comfort and contentment and served as a balm to soothe the stripes across his back and through his psyche. He had so desperately missed it.
“That’s two things, John,” he says, and John is now a thorough mix of confused and exasperated, but he decides not to call Sherlock out on the fact that he’s not answering John’s question about the case.
John finished his drink and pushed himself off the stool that he had been occupying for the past two hours. The room spun for a moment before righting itself, further proof that he was at the perfect stopping point to avoid any negative side effects. He gave a nod to the barkeep as he pulled on his coat before making his way out.
Purple violets. Red roses. Pink tulips. Peruvian lilies. Baby’s breath. Forget-me-nots. Camellias in several colors. Daffodils and chrysanthemums. Other blooms he couldn’t name because he hadn’t ever seen them before. He had never seen so many flowers outside of a garden or flower shop in his life and here they all were, filling his living room with their delicate brilliance.
John found he didn’t mind these interruptions to his showers so much. He had begun to look forward to them and missed them when he managed to spend an entire shower alone. He was aware this wasn’t exactly normal flatmate behavior, but he also didn’t really care. He skirted the border of normal on a good day, and his flatmate showed up naked save for an Egyptian cotton bedsheet at Buckingham Palace. Normal was not a concern for them.
“Maybe you could cook for me sometime,” Mary said from the doorway where she had apparently stopped. John whipped his head back around to look at her. She was watching him with a small, shy smile on her face that didn’t match the boldness of the sentence she had just said to him.
Except now there was an underscore that wasn’t there before. Or perhaps he was simply fooling himself that it hadn’t always been there. He was aware that he had always been attracted to John. His intellect and his dark humour that complemented his own so well. John was reliable, trustworthy, and showed a kindness that Sherlock rarely experienced from anyone, nevermind someone who had more reasons than most to not be kind to him. Someone who knew him better than anyone else in the world and still chose to share a part of his life with him.
Naturally, he was to be denied that because John Watson never got what he wanted out of life. As soon as his feet hit the pavement outside the clinic, he felt that tingle on the back of his neck again. That old instinct that told him he was being watched. He turned to walk towards the closest Tube station, his headache receding as his senses kicked into overdrive.
John smiled at that, glad that he was looking up and not at Sherlock as he spoke. It was almost too easy to understand exactly what Shakespeare was trying to say. Sherlock was John’s guiding star. He had been since the moment the man took one look at him and read his story from the way he stood and his mobile phone. Despite all that had happened to them, and it was a hell of a lot more than the average person probably dealt with, John still loved him. He could still look to Sherlock and know where he was meant to be. He could still find his way home.
“Yeah, that’d be nice,” he replied. He didn’t think they ever would, but he didn’t want to outright say no.
Both men turned at the sound and John watched as an attractive man with silver hair came into the flat without knocking, his gaze fixed on Sherlock.
John waited, but he didn’t hear a reply. He continued to stare at the door to his flat, then shook his head with a wry smile before opening his door.
“I never said it was smart. I was just saying that’s what they call it. And it definitely makes sense. Rosie can get very hangry.”
John stared at the empty doorway for several moments before he shook his head at himself. He wasn’t anywhere near the right headspace to even consider whatever it was Mary suggested or seemed to suggest, in her comments and her winking, and John wasn’t ready for that.
When John was done asking his questions and writing the answers, he put down his pen and looked up at the two of them.
John settled down into the space of Sherlock’s arms. They turned toward each other on the bed and after a moment Sherlock twisted his body to pull the duvet over their rapidly chilling bodies in the February chill. They held each other, and kissed, and hands gently explored as they ignored the sticky mess between them.
John noticed his socked feet, the toes of his right foot tapping quickly as he stood there, his hands were moving incessantly, long fingers fidgeting seemingly without conscious input, he was chewing on his bottom lip, and his eyes were locked on John with such intensity that John thought he wouldn’t be able to move if he wanted to.
“Well, she does love to dote on her. I hardly think she considered it any trouble at all. She’s not likely to have any other grandchildren to…” he started, then coughed and shook his head. “Not that Rosie is her grandchild, of course, she doesn’t see her that way,” he tried to backtrack, clearly flustered, and John reached out a hand to place it on his friend’s shoulder.
“You need my help. So you just thought you’d show up in my home after two years. Two years, Sherlock.”
“Of course, I’m sure. Christmas with you and Joy sounds far more enjoyable than a Christmas watching Mycroft see how much plum pudding he could eat in one sitting.”
“Bed,” John gasped into his skin and Sherlock nodded, pressing into him and pushing him backwards a step before releasing him and pushing his own trousers and pants all the way off.
“We live in a physical world where everything is dictated by chemical reactions. Every action has a reaction. One element does this, another does that, put them together and they’ll do something different. Science, John. It’s important.”
John’s voice was a soft command. Sherlock slowly opened his eyes to look up at John, ears ringing from his elevated blood pressure, fingers digging into the flesh of his thighs, his chest and throat tight. John held his gaze, breathing slow, measured breaths, and didn’t look away until Sherlock began to subconsciously mimic those measured breaths and his heart slowed to a more reasonable pace.
It was bitterly cold and the wind whipping over him cut through the layers of his coat and the gloves on his hand. He was thankful he had remembered to grab his scarf in his rush out of the door that morning. He had had to ask Mrs. Hudson to take Joy out for her morning walk after he had woken late for the first time in years. He hadn’t bothered with an alarm clock because his body always woke in time, but apparently not that morning.
Sherlock gently used his hands to tilt John’s face up as he leaned down to meet his mouth with his own, just a careful press of lips together, tender and tame.
Sherlock scowled. “Fine, take me to Bart’s,” he picked as he figured he might be able to convince Molly to let him do something in the lab.
“Yes. Mycroft and I used to go visit her over the summer holiday when we were young. Three weeks of no rules and the run of the entire estate,” Sherlock answered. “She kept beehives on the property. I used to sit and watch them for hours as they worked collecting nectar from the flowers in the garden and then returning to the hives. They’re fascinating creatures, bees.”
The next day found John shopping for Christmas gifts. The clinic’s holiday party was coming up and he hadn’t managed to pick up anything yet. So, after work, he had made his way to the small chocolate shop where he bought gifts for his co-workers and a larger one for Harry. He went ahead and bought a small assortment of truffles for Mrs. Hudson, as well. He’d give them to her when he got back as a thank you for the meal last night.
John smiled as he chased the last remnants of the dream that was partly memory. The dream had ended before Sherlock had discovered The Woman’s gift, and John had a feeling that if the dream had been allowed to continue, Sherlock never would have found it and The Woman wouldn’t have ruined their celebration with her ill-timed fake death.
John pulled out his wallet and paid the cabbie as they arrived in front of 221b, and he followed Sherlock out of the taxi and into the now misting rain. Sherlock unlocked the door and they made their way inside and then up the stairs to their flat.
Sherlock felt the blood rush to his face and cursed his anatomy for the tells he couldn’t always hide, like the blush he knew stretched up the back of his neck and rose into his cheeks. Damnit. He had used John’s laptop, hadn’t he? He needed to delete the history as soon as John left.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t realize...” Sherlock started, stopped. His brows were scrunched down, the little dip between them prevalent, and John felt his chest tighten at the look in his eyes.
He let the robe fall from his shoulders and pool on the floor before reaching over to turn the taps off and stepped carefully into the hot water. The temperature was perfect, almost too hot to handle, and he could feel the blush that crept over his skin as the heat of the water warmed him, his muscles relaxing, his nerves uncoiling. He let himself sink into the tub, his knees popping up out of the water and into the warm air of the little room as he let his shoulders be submerged.
Sherlock was standing in the middle of the room and John absently noticed that the fire was going in the grate, and he wasn’t sure if Sherlock had just done it or if Mrs. Hudson had started it before they came home. It was an unimportant detail, but it was one that he took in along with everything else.
They had stumbled through the door of 221B in the early hours of the morning, riding the high of a successful evening chasing the criminals of London along its dark streets. John had made his way to the kitchen to get the kettle started for tea as the inevitable exhaustion that followed these types of evenings began to creep along the edges of the adrenaline that still coursed through his veins.
“During, actually. We walked and she agreed to meet me outside since Joy isn’t a certified working dog.”
That was three years ago. There had been some adjustments to the flat with the addition of a baby, then a toddler, but Sherlock took it all in stride and never seemed to regret his decision to have them move in. He played his violin at reasonable hours and often to help Rosie calm when she was crying or sleepy, didn’t shoot the walls, kept body parts in a small fridge in his bedroom, kept his experiments in places a small toddler couldn’t reach when it became necessary, and often watched Rosie on his own when John had shifts at the clinic because Sherlock hated the idea of Rosie in daycare.
“What for? You don’t have work on Friday because it’s a bank holiday and you don’t have hours on Monday. Plenty of time for a short holiday.”
Secondly, I'll be honest and say I'm not 100% in love with this chapter. It was kicking my butt and John wasn't ready to cooperate with me. Hopefully, he gets his head together tomorrow for me. He's a stubborn one.
It wasn’t until he was in the middle of deducing the shooter of the cabbie that he looked over and saw John standing beside a panda car with flashing lights and realized exactly what had happened. A man with military experience. Nerves of steel. A strong moral principle. John Watson possessed all of those things. John had killed a man, he was sure of it, and yet he stood there surrounded by police officers clearly waiting for Sherlock. He had been fooled by one Dr. John H. Watson, which both rankled and intrigued at the same time. It wasn’t every day that Sherlock was caught by surprise by someone, and yet the diminutive doctor kept doing so.
Sherlock tugged at John’s shirt and pushed it up and over his head before he tossed it on the floor to join his jacket. John’s hands returned to his shirt and he pushed it off his shoulders, fingers trailing over his flesh, and Sherlock felt the moment John’s touch encountered scar tissue. He watched John frown, and he was struck with the inability to move as John’s fingers reached further down his back, following the length of one of the scars that crossed his skin.
“She’ll be safe to explore. There’s nothing dangerous she can get into besides maybe upsetting a bee,” Sherlock said as his gaze shifted to watch Rosie as she ran up to a tree and pulled on a low lying limb to smell the flowers there.
“Well, you have to ask your father first,” Sherlock reminded her, silver eyes flashing up at John with a wicked glint.
“Obviously,” he replied, suddenly very aware of the water that collected and dripped from his hair down his face and the open collar of his shirt.
“Yeah, I suppose you would know better than me what you’re thinking,” John said with a chuckle, and he heard Sherlock’s soft laugh in reply.
“Sorry,” she said around her food and Sherlock shook his head before he glanced at John, who was placing cups of water down in front of their plates.
Sherlock rose from his crouch beside her bed, eyes cast down and away from John as if he suddenly remembered that John was in the room and that this shared moment between him and Rosie had been on full display for an audience and he was waiting for criticism.
He sat up, rolling carefully off Sherlock, as Rosie approached the bed with her new stuffed rabbit clutched to her chest.
“Nonsense, dear. She’s more than welcome to stay. She needs a name, though. You can’t keep calling her ‘dog’.”
Sherlock’s grin turned predatory as he uncrossed his legs and leaned forward. He rose to his feet in front of John and he let his gaze travel up Sherlock’s lean body, the black trousers that clung to his legs, the white silk button-up that had come half untucked as they had made their way through the wine and scotch.
The truth of the matter was becoming harder and harder to ignore. At the end of the day, he really just needed John.
John stood on that edge and felt that inexorable pull towards the unknown, and he wasn’t sure he was content to let the world continue moving around him. But he also wasn’t ready to make that decision, to wade in and let himself feel all those emotions that being out there would reveal. He knew they were there, but fully acknowledging them when there was a distinct possibility they would never be reciprocated in the same way was terrifying. Not when they had remained so long ignored by all parties involved.
“Jesus, Sherlock! Don’t just sneak up on me like that,” he half-shouted before forcing himself to lower his voice. “You scared me.”
“Oh yes, actually, I like this one quite a lot,” he replied smoothly, not rising to Sherlock’s bait.
It had been building slowly since he forced himself out of bed that morning. Sitting in the back of his mind like some insidious toad, biding its time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment. A weight on his chest, tightening and releasing as he forced his mind to other tasks, ignoring the shadow that danced on his nerves. The edges were beginning to fray, but still, he pursued any activity than the one where he had to look that beast in the face.
