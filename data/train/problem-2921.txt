Back in Singer's Scrapyard, the group starts putting the clues together. But as Castiel starts realizing that perhaps someone other than Raphael is involved,  Sam gets a surprise visitor.
Before leaving the car, he sent a message to his brother. Alfie  had been acting strange for a week or so, and Dean was starting to get worried. Everyone at the garage assured him that Alfie proably just had a girlfriend, Dean couldn't stop himself from worrying. So he asked Alfie to stay away from the apartment until the FBI agents left, because if Hatch's surviving goons decided to silence anyone, it would be better if Alfie wasn't involved.
Cas took a step back, but Dean was not going to let him go. So he stepped forward, until he had Castiel, angel of the Lord, pressed against the wall of the Bunker.
Dean took a deep breath at that. Truth was, he was a bit curious about Cas's family. Since they had met at Hell's Coffee -Great coffee, terrible service, to be truthful - Cas had been completely silent about his family. All Dean knew was that they were a huge family and that at some point, Cas's father had been going through a really religious phase since most if not all of Cas's brothers were named after angels. Including one named Lucifer, which to Dean always have sounded as looking for trouble because the guy must have been bullied to hell and back in school.
“You should let her out of you,” Dean interrupted again. “She was tricked by Chuck… and given how angry she got after all the time she was locked up, you don’t want to deal with her a millennia down the line.”
Trying not to picture exactly that, Sam nodded. "I promise. Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine. It's not the first time we've been separated by a hunt."
"I don't know if it is connected, but while I was away I remembered something," Castiel explained, walking towards Bobby's car. "You said that the three deaths were similar to the plagues of Egypt, Sam. There's only one weapon in the world that could cause that."
When Castiel had said goodbye to Dean Winchester, he had let Dean believe he was now 'heaven's sheriff'.  It had been a lie, and not a very good one at that, but it had served its purpose. Dean had been satisfied that Heaven wouldn't meddle in humanity's business again. It was all Castiel could do to repay all of Dean's sacrifice.
It reminded him of that first year hunting with Dean, when they were looking for their dad. If there was one thing that Winchesters knew how to do, it was to keep themselves hidden, from law enforcement, from supernatural creatures on revenge fueled trips, even from other hunters when needed. But this was too much. Not even John had managed to keep himself completely out of sight, and from time to time, reports of him being in town would crop up. Not so with Dean. Ellen, after almost chewing Sam and Bobby's head for not calling her sooner, had started some very discreet  inquiries with the hunters she trusted. After Sam had killed Lilith, most hunters had decided that he was something else to be hunted and thus, it was difficult to ask for help. Jo had teamed up with one of Bobby's friends, a gangly guy who seemed as if the wind could blow him over named Garth, and they also had their eyes and ears opened for anything that sounded like Dean.   As far as Sam knew, Castiel hadn't gone back to Heaven, instead searching for Dean with the same  fervor that he had while looking for God all over the world, and Gabriel
"I thought you were going to teach us how to be hunters," Alfie asked, and Dean would've groaned if he had been able too. It was very obvious that his little brother wanted to change the subject. "How can we learn here?"
“We don’t need to talk about that if it makes you uncomfortable, Dean…” Cas said at the same time as Dean gathered his courage. “I told you, saying it was enough.”
That made an impression on Sam's head. They had once forgotten each other thanks to Zachariah. Sam still remembered his month as "Sam Wesson", and how even if he had thought "Dean Smith" was familiar, he hadn't felt any emotional connection to him. And that time? Zachariah had only taken him for the ride because he knew Sam wouldn't stop looking for Dean if he remembered.
"Well, then, what are we waiting for? Let's go and find your brother and see what kind of mess he got himself into to get you out of hell," Bobby shook his head as he walked past Sam and out into the yard. He still had to summon Crowley to get his soul back, but the way he saw things going, if he didn't accompany Sam  the kid could do something really stupid like no telling Dean he was back if he thought his brother was happy with that Lisa woman.
After Dean accepted to stay in the Panic Room, Bobby led Sam and their unwanted guest back upstairs.
Castiel didn't answer, choosing to attack. The faster he dealt with his brother, the faster he could go back to search for Dean.
"Wait, Cas... your Father won't mind? I mean.. I know you say your family is big but... he wouldn't mind having the whole Winchester clan there too?"
"Dean? Dean Derringer? You have got  to be kidding. That guy is up for sainthood in this neighborhood!" The girl, Marion according to her name tag, grinned. "That's the thing, see? Dean is a volunteer at the local youth center, and Chris was one of his kids so he was devastated when it happened."
Sam lowered his eyes and swore. That had to be before Dean had decided to cave to Zachariah's demands, before they found out that the angels had brought Adam back. Which meant he had just lost his only clue to his brother's whereabouts. Because if Dean wasn't with Lisa, and he wasn't with Bobby, Sam had no idea where his brother could be.
It had been at that moment when he realized that Father was dead. After all, doubt was punished with falling, and yet here Raphael stood, the only archangel surviving the failed apocalypse, while Zachariah and Uriel had been killed by the rebellious angels who had sided with the Winchesters.
Besides that, Dean had also included a lot of clippings on Hatch, Gray, Colfax and Grant, about suspicious arrests and their work, that seemed less than stellar.  Birch's school grades, which were very high. Bobby had to admit that it was possible that the kid had been unjustly killed.
"My brother Charoun threatened me. He made it clear that he was siding with Raphael. And they were keeping something important here in Easter. Something that he is protecting."
“Rowena and Crowley were reviewing the contracts… they claim that since you also were a Knight of Hell, they…”
They opened it cautiously, to find a pink gadget that they knew was an iPhone thanks to the memories of their former captives and a note inside. The note read:
He appeared on the living room of Robert Singer's house, still invisible, trying to assess the situation.  Sam and Bobby were there, both of them worried. It took Castiel less than a second to realize that yes, the man standing there was Sam Winchester. His soul was unmistakeable. There were muted red lines around it, the scars created by the demon blood that he had ingested since he was a baby, as well as a muted patch near his heart, a sign of the multiple times that he had been possessed, but it was still Sam. Still human, filled with love. The love that Castiel had originally refused to see when dealing with him because his orders were clear: Lucifer's vessel was of no consequence. Now, he regretted those actions because, if nothing else, he knew that the way in which he treated Sam caused Dean pain.
At the time, Sam had been relieved to see that the Impala was not only intact but was still Dean's most important possession. While he didn't have the same unhealthy attachment to the car that his brother had, he couldn't have bested Lucifer if it hadn't been for all the memories that his brother's car held for him. For one brief second, Sam believed that everything was going to be fine.
“Unless you call for help, yes. And not every demon and angel goes to Purgatory. Cas comes with me.” Dean smiled at the Shadow, making the Shadow feel something… different. They were starting to understand why the annoying noisy angel liked this former human. “And as I said before, no other angel or demon dying will ever come here. We will make sure of that with either the new Death or the Old Death if he wants his job back.”
After Bobby had interrogated the manager, they had decided to wait for Cas there. The angel had not gotten confused again, but he was trying to pinpoint the origin of the angelic energy he could feel permeating the city, and he insisted it was better for him to do so away from any human. So while they waited for Castiel to arrive -through the door, they had been clear on that-they at least could eat. If  Sam could find at least one item on the menu that wasn't deep fried.  The idea of eating somewhere else was nixed by Bobby not because he thought the food there was any good, but because according to the manager, their three victims were regular costumers. If they had a common enemy, there was a big chance he or she was a regular too.
“We weren’t supposed to interfere again, Dean,” Castiel told him, as he walked towards him. It was then when Dean realized that Cas wasn’t glaring at him exactly, but at the stupid rebar piercing his body.
Even then, Bobby was still wary. Because something wasn't right.  He could've believed that Dean came back from Hell, even before they found out an angel had pulled him out. But Sam hadn't been just in hell. Sam had jumped straight into the deepest circle, Lucifer's cage. And if Sam was out... that meant the cage wasn't as inescapable as they had thought.
It took Dean at least three pushes before he managed to get the mammoth to let him go, and he immediately asked what the hell was his problem. But the agent  -who, as if it wasn't enough that he was completely insane, also had hair so long that it
“Don’t I get a say on this?” Dean finally asked, reeling over the implications of what Cas was saying. He was grateful he was alive, but at the same time, he was not worth a cosmic war.
It was a weird sense of Deja vú, Dean thought, as he and Cas said the exact same thing at the same time, after two days of not talking to each other. Two days of grumbling, of avoiding the room where the other was, of grunting to pass the salt at dinner, and Dean had had enough.
However, that train of thought was interrupted when Dean violently doubled over himself in pain, touching his head.  Castiel moved forward,  but 'Alfie' was faster, touching Dean's forehead in a gesture   Sam knew all too well.  In the instant his fingers touched Dean's forehead, Dean's seixure stopped and Dean closed his eyes,  falling into the Samandiriel's arms, who, to Sam's distaste, seemed actually protective of Dean.
"No, Alfie is not here," Marion answered the question that Dean hadn't asked. "And I have no idea what this guy's problem is. They said they were FBI agents..."
"We are... a lot of brothers and sisters, Dean... I'm sure Father won't mind six more mouths.... " Cas seemed to be considering the possibilities. "I could call him... to be sure."
Alfie stopped  as he realized that Dean wasn't alone. Dean was starting to wonder exactly how he was going to explain the two hunters in the living room when something strange happened. His brother's face went completely emotionless as he saw the other men. And still... it reminded Dean of how Castiel looked at him.
"Balls!" Bobby seemed to agree. Because the man who had just come in, looking at all the clients in the restaurant as if he was looking for someone,  gesturing with his hands at the guy behind the register,  was none other than  Dean. Dean, his brother,  looking perfectly fine, as if he had been taking a vacation while every one of their friends was going insane looking for him.
"I thought you wanted an explanation," Samandiriel said, looking down. Castiel frowned, since his brother actually looked repentant. As if he wasn't happy with his own actions. "And Dean... he can't hear what I have to tell you."
"Last I saw your brother, he said he was going to fulfill his promise to you. Do you have any idea where he could be?"
"Can that happen?" Now Sam looked... worried. And that confused Dean, because Sam looked as if he was worried about
Sam Winchester's voice was clear as a bell inside Castiel's head, despite the fact that Castel knew that it was impossible for prayers  from hell to reach heaven. Sam had said yes to Lucifer. The last time he  had seen and heard Sam had been when Lucifer had killed Castiel.
"Who? Alfie?" the girl smiled at him. "He had a family emergency. You know how it is. And anyway, you should talk to his brother, if you want to know about Chris. He worked with him at the garage  and took Chris's death really hard."
“I take it that you found a way to beat Chuck?” He said, trying to sound calm despite the fact that his vessel’s heart was beating a mile a minute. They were alive, he was out of the empty, and Dean had kissed him.
"And I take it didn't work,"  Bobby said. While he hadn't had much contact with angels other than Castiel, what Dean and Sam told him was more than enough to know that.
But there was no annoying angel, nor music or snoring or screams of pain. The Empty was silent, and empty except for the Shadow, as it had been on the beginning.
“The Reapers won’t allow it,” Cas sighed. “They… they want you to be the new Death, given that you were the cause of the death of the First and most thought Billie was just… uh… keeping the throne warm for you.”
Castiel looked at Samandiriel, wondering if the younger angel knew what was wrong with their charge. As it was, Castiel had only once seen a human vessel speak with the voice of an angel. Thousands of years in the past, when mankind was barely starting to create their first civilization. The first angel that had taken a vessel had not know how to manipulate human vocal cords. The bodies  were far too primitive, far too limiting to what angels really where. It had taken some practice back then, even if now they all could do it almost instinctively.
"What? We might as well tell him," Bobby said, and there was something else. A silent conversation between them. Dean couldn't guess what they were saying with their eyes, but he knew they were having an argument. He was well versed in silent conversations after all. "We can't let him go on blissfully ignorant, and you know it."
“And while you do that, Cas is suffering,” Dean shook his head. “I’m doing this, and if you don’t agree, you can wait until we come back or make your bags and go to Eileen. But you’re not stopping me.”
That was obviously the wrong thing to say, as Dean's features clouded immediately as he moved to keep Aaron as far from the angel as was humanly possible in the small room. He kept signing, to Cas, to Bobby, and completely ignoring Sam as he had realized that Sam had no idea what those movements meant.
"Raphael believes that he's following Father's orders," Castiel tried to explain.  "But he will fail. He can't reopen Lucifer's cage."
he asked, remembering how Sam had reacted upon seeing him. While it sounded like hunting was a worthwhile activity, he couldn't imagine that the retirement plan was very good.
Since he was four years old, when the doctor had told him that he would never speak again, he had known that sometimes, life just didn't go his way. It had been hammered further when he had been the only one able to take care of his brother, pretending that his father wasn't a drunken mess so child services wouldn't take Alfie away from him.
"The Impala is not in the driveway," Bobby's voice pulled him out of his thoughts and he tried to see the Breaden's  house. True enough, there was no sign of the distinctive black car that was his brother's pride and joy.
Dean shook his head, probably annoyed at the possibility of Bobby not understanding everything, and then he walked into one of the rooms. Before Bobby could remind both Sam and Castiel that they had to focus in the case and not in Dean, he came back with a huge folder, filled with newspapers clippings.
The mortal, however, moved too fast for Kutiel. It was a human who knew how to fight. Kuriel turned around, furious that a human was causing him so much trouble when the two sided mirror that separated them from the other room.
"Not a crossroad demon, feathers." The demon smirked at him. "And it wasn't MY side the one that fucked the plan up. We did everything  we were supposed to do, it was your guys who couldn't make sure that Winchester One followed the plan."
"I don't understand," Samandiriel answered, at the same time as Dean batted his hands away. The older Winchester was angry, as angry as Castiel had seen him when he had thought that they were going to smite the town of Salem. Castiel lowered his sword, trying to make sure that Dean realized that he meant no harm to him, Samandiriel or the Impala.
“I dunno if you heard, but we’re under new management,” Dean shrugged, and someone waved from the portal. The loud nephelim that had woken up every sleeper in the Empty. The Shadow frowned, but at least the nephelim –who now seemed far more powerful than before – didn’t try to come inside. “We have a new system to deal with dead angels and demons that won’t involve you. So even if we have another apocalypse, no one will bother your sleep.”
And he was 95% sure that the kid had gone and gotten himself possessed by an angel. Sam couldn't always tell, some angels were far better than Cas at pretending to be human, but there still was a stiffness on the way they stood that was hard to miss if one knew what to look for.
As he walked into the town of Sioux Falls, he wondered if they should pray to Gabriel. He had promised he would look around for Dean, and they had found Dean after all. Not only that, Gabriel was as powerful as Raphael. If anyone could break the hold Raphael had on Dean's memories, it had to be him. But then, Sam still hadn't quite forgiven the archangel for killing his brother a hundred times just for fun, and at the same time, he didn't want Gabriel to ask more questions about Sam's own escape from Hell.
"Cas, get us out of here," Sam said, opening his eyes carefully. As he suspected, the angel that had killed Grant was on the floor, looking peaceful, surrounded by the burnt silhouette of two huge wings. "Before the other cops come here to investigate."
"When Zachariah zapped us, Dean was his complete opposite," Sam added. "I remember him eating salads, and not wanting to take any risk with his health. It took me a lot to convince him to check the ghost haunting, and he really didn't want to get on the road to hunt again."
Dean finally signed, looking defeated. It convinced Bobby more that Dean had a very good idea of what was happening in Easter, even if he pretended not to. Unfortunately, his body language was still familiar to Sam and, without understanding ASL, the boy jumped to the wrong conclusion.
Dean perked at the possibility. He didn’t want to go to hell ever again, but a small interference from Rowena saving his life and giving him a chance to see Cas again? It was good enough to send her a fruit basket. However, Cas was shaking his head in the negative. There was more to the story apparently.
"As far as I know, they're still on the cage. But about Dean, that's the thing. We don't know," Sam answered quickly. "He wasn't with Bobby, he wasn't with Lisa, and I'm running out of ideas. Can you find him?"
"That was an angel speaking," Castiel said, just before he disappeared from the back seat, making Sam curse.  Obviously, they were not going to be able to escape Raphael that easily.
"Wait, before he disappeared, Dean said that you were the new sheriff in Heaven," Bobby pressed. Behind them Sam had gone silent. The boy was hiding something, of that Bobby was sure. Unfortunately, with all that was happening, he wasn't sure when he would have the time to confront him about it. "Why aren't you putting a stop to it?"
"I... thought he was with you," Sam answered, looking confused. It was an expression Bobby knew well, from the days when John had left the two boys under his care where he went off hunting clues to the Yellow Eyed Demon's whereabouts. "Do you think he did this? He promised me he wouldn't try it..."
"There are angels in this town," Cas announced,  as he appeared on the back of Bobby's car, surprising Sam. "I'm afraid there might be a Weapon of Heaven here. Probably the Staff of Moses, although that wouldn't account for the small scope of the effects."
"Dad called me yesterday. He and mom got an RV... they want to travel all over the states next year and this is going to be their first stop. They are going to stay with us Christmas and New Year's... and Sammy and Sarah are coming too."
“What do you mean, where Dean is going to spend the afterlife?” Sam asked, frowning. Bitchface #9, one that Dean rarely saw not directed at himself. “We’re going to Heaven, aren’t we? Don’t we deserve it after… after everything?”
"I'm confused, if you found Dean, why is he not with you?" Sam knew that Cas was not judging them for not having Dean with them, but it sounded close to it to Sam. And that made him angry at the angel. Because HE couldn't have protected Dean since was in hell, and Dean would never let Bobby protect him. But Cas? He was the one who promised Sam he would protect Dean. He was the incredibly powerful angel. He shouldn't have left Dean alone.
“Because it’s Cas, Sam!” Dean defended himself. “How many times did he threw away his grace for us? For me? If he did that… I can do the same for him. And at least, if Jack is making me an angel, I know he’ll leave me being me. You’d do the same for Eileen!”
“I don't want to see any of you ever again!” The Shadow replied, offended. Behind the Portal, the Mariachi were now about two hundred, and were playing something about Eyes coming down a Mountain, and someone wanting a mole that was over someone else’s lips. It made no sense, and it was making them testy.
"We're not discussing that right now," Bobby interrupted them, stopping the car behind Dean's Riviera. "Not a word about angels, or the apocalypse. We need to figure out what killed those cops, and then what exactly happened to Dean. But we're not going to have the chance to do that if he is convinced we're a bunch of psychos."
"I'm sure it's not normal. I could buy him not remembering anyone and creating a new life," Bobby said. "But that doesn't explain why he's  suddenly fluent in ASL."
"Dean?" Sam frowned hearing the name. Of course, it had to be some other Dean. There had to be  thousands in the United States alone. But hearing that name, in the same town where Castiel couldn't remember if he had seen Dean or not, was enough to make Sam suspicious.
"I had a weekend off," Singer answered, looking at Dean as if he had been expecting that question.  But before Dean could really think about that, the older man turned to the angel and thus, couldn't see Dean's hands anymore. "What did you mean when you said that Dean had angelic energy around him?"
By the time had Sam turned 45, Dean noticed he had stopped aging. Cas said it was a precaution, just to make sure old age didn’t take him before negotiations were over. When Dean held his first niece in his hands, a tiny little girl named Eileen Madison Winchester, he looked no older than 26. A gift/bribery from Rowena who gave Dean eternal youth while on Earth, since the negotiations were slow and going slower.
, not about what could happen to them if there were other side effects. That made no sense. Besides, Dean felt fine. Of course, the voice thing had been a surprise, but  Dean could avoid that. After all, he hadn't been able to talk since he was 4 years old.
With one last disapproving look from Sam, Bobby started explaining Dean about everything.  Angels and Demons were real, but so where ghosts, werewolves, ghouls, wendigos, and every single thing that went bump in the night. And Sam and Bobby, and other people around the world, dedicated their lives to hunting them.
“If he did, it could start a cosmic war,” Castiel ignored Dean’s joke, but the glare he sent Dean’s way made clear he didn’t appreciate it. “Heaven doesn’t have the strength right now to fight so… we thought a more diplomatic route would be better. But then, Dean almost died, just as each faction had send an ambassador to a neutral point to begin negotiations.”
"Sam? You still there?" Ellen sounded pissed, so Sam guessed he had missed something important she had said.
“DAD!” Jack was right next to them, and as Dean let Castiel down, the young nephelim hugged Castiel tight, as if he was afraid that Castiel would leave. It was only then that Castiel realized Dean was not the only one who was far more powerful than the last time they had met. Now Jack was brimming with power and warmth, at a level that Castiel had only felt when…
And so, two years after he had drove Dean in that same truck to find his brother Sam, he was doing the same for Sam. Maybe now John and the kid Adam could also come back and so Bobby would get the whole Winchester set.
"Well, if you say so. But if something happens to Chuck, you're going to have to explain it to his girlfriend."
Ironically, the memory that tortured the noisy, annoying old angel the most was of him killing the new angel. And now, belatedly, the Shadow realized who this new angel was: It was the former human named Dean Winchester. The annoying angel Castiel’s happiness in the flesh, walking into the Empty as an angel instead of as a human hunter.
"I said that  maybe you also had to keep an eye out for a group of hunters that seem to be bad news," Ellen repeated, cautiously.  "Remember what you and Dean told us about Mary's family?"
Dean was getting anxious. Once that the angel had figured out who had bought Aaron's soul, he had insisted on making a spell and then disappeared from Dean's apartment. Literally disappeared, in the blink of an eye. The other men didn't  seem to mind, so Dean figured that was normal for them.
Dean was signing so fast, that Bobby figured he was having a panic attack. Not that he blamed the boy, since he apparently had been living a normal life.
There was a long silence on the other side of the line. Long enough that  he feared that the call had been cut.
Dean  knew that Alfie was not going to change his mind. He had a lot of other questions, starting with how the hell had his brother known about Hunters in the first place, why he wanted to be one, and why hadn't he told Dean
When Dean died for the hundredth time, the one that was supposed to be definitive, Sam had taken to take long walks in the morning, trying  to clear his mind and figure out how to get his brother out of hell. At first, it had been because he was looking for crossroads, to find one where the demon was willing to make a deal. Later, when he hooked up with Ruby, he had also needed to burn some excess energy after drinking her blood when there were no demons to exorcise or kill.
Trying to keep his hands to himself, he focused on the older agent, the only one who seemed to understand ASL, while also keeping a vigilant eye on the other one, the one who had hugged him, just in case. He tried not to be paranoid, but he still had a scar on his arm from the last time that he had  not trusted his gut.
To Dean, it sounded like a good job. Far more meaningful than his 9 to 7 at the garage. Because he could imagine something like the officer's deaths happening to innocent people. People who didn't deserve to die because a vampire got hungry, or a ghost was still mad about something that happened thousands of years ago.
"But you have to! He said you would!" Becky insisted, pulling him into the house. Now that was more like the Becky he remembered. Inside, the house was both better and worse than the last time Sam had been there, when Dean had been frantic to find Cas just to hear that Cas had been blown apart by an archangel. It looked as if someone had actually cleaned and organized the place... and then gone insane and turned everything upside down again.  "Right before he disappeared, he  told me that if anything happened to him, I was to come here and wait for YOU."
Chauron's words echoed in Castiel's head as he flew towards the Impala. He couldn't help but feel that if Dean was hurt again, it was only his fault for not paying attention.  He had heard a soft, almost familiar voice, singing in enochian coming out of nowhere, but it had been so low, so tentative, that he hadn't actually registered that it was real until he saw the jeep windshield start to crack.
Unfortunately, the sheer quantity of research made Dean look like the main person who would like those officers dead. Sam seemed to agree with that idea, since he put away the folder almost immediately.
“Fine, sing one more song. But when you’re done, I’m throwing you out that portal and everyone not in your arms to Purgatory and you better fulfill your part of the d… the arrangement!”
Yes, the Empty was just a black void, with no distinguishing features, not even a way to know where was the floor and where was the sky. The only direction Dean had at the moment was the portal that Jack kept open. But it didn’t matter. He knew his heart would guide him to where Castiel slept, and his voice would wake his angel up. And so, he started to sing.
Dean texted back, feeling a bit easier. Of all of Alfie's friends, he liked Rachel the least. She was one of her classmates, and for some reason always looked at Dean as if he wasn't worthy of licking her shoes clean. No matter what he did, she seemed to dislike him more. Until the feeling was mutual.
Once that Castiel introduced himself -and later Sam was going to ask him where the hell he got his alias- Dean took a moment before starting to sign again. Any hope that Bobby would remember that he didn't speak ASL flew through the window in the moment Sam realized that of course Castiel would understand sign language, and of course he would not think to translate it for him.  So once again, Sam was only listening to half the conversation, looking at his brother treat him as a complete stranger.
"I saw the papers outside it. A police officer died during an investigation. All his internal organs liquefied into blood."
.  It had seemed stupid, when it had only been Hatch, but after Colfax died with a bunch of insects hatching on his skull, Dean had been a bit more open to the possibility. And he knew exactly who would have paid such price.
Assured that his brother was not going to be looking for him if he disappeared for a few hours, Dean put on his jacket and left the apartment. During the research he had made, he had come across a couple of sites that swore up and down that witchcraft existed, that it was possible to kill your enemies at a distance
"The Campbells, yes," Sam nodded on the phone, lowering his speed. He was in a hurry to get to Bobby's but he didn't want to get in an accident because he wasn't paying attention to the road. "Family of hunters, never even tried to contact Dad after Mom died. What about them?"
Why Raphael had insisted on erasing the Righteous man 's memory when he had first been alone with him? Why not take him to the green room or even a temporal heaven while the rest of the garrison rescued Michael?
Because the guy also looked familiar. Dean couldn't pinpoint from where, but he was sure he knew the third agent. He also had the strongest urge to go and fix  the agent's tie and straighten his trench coat collar.
This was all the Angel’s fault. He had woken the Shadow and now the Shadow had a headache, an existential crisis and all they wanted to do is sleep.
Dean's glare lessened a bit, and he started moving his hands again, this time gesturing in Bobby's direction. It went for a full minute before Bobby raised his hands in defeat.
He pointed out.  He was trying very hard not to pay attention to the idiots who had convinced Alfie to throw away his life while Dean had been unconscious. He hated when that happened, and it was far more often that he wanted to admit. He just hoped that Alfie wouldn't use the fainting spells as a reason why Dean couldn't take care of him. Last thing he remembered was Alfie arriving home, and then, nothing. Just his brother telling him he wanted to quit college to go and become a drifter.
There was something about this men that made him want to trust them, even if so far they hadn't really done a thing to earn his trust.
As if it knew the Shadow wouldn’t be able to hurt him as long as the loud noise broke their concentration, their beautiful silence. And damn the new Angel, he was right. But the Shadow knew how to fight too, they sent a wave of power towards the waking angel, to make him go back into slumber, into his most terrifying and painful memory.
Cas made a gesture that reminded Dean of a long time ago, when Cas still was not precisely on Team Free Will, and used his powers to close a dripping pipe. And suddenly, the pressure on his chest disappeared, and he was falling to the ground, free from the rebar.
And Grant had been  fine with the idea of his impending death. Unlike  the others, he had the chance to put his will in order, even make arrangements to say goodbye to his family without making them worry. But then the FBI had come to talk to him, and he realized that perhaps the punishment wasn't that heavenly. The Agents keep asking them about HAtch, and if they had any enemies in common. And then agent Denver had mentioned the Derringer guy, who had been coming over to the station, demanding that they reopened the Birch case just because he was one of his 'project' kids. Everyone knew that those kids would end up in jail anyway, everyone except Derringer who was a pain in the ass and who had put the FBI on his tail.
"A deal creates a mark on the human soul," Castiel explained, but he didn't move closer to the chair where Aaron was sitting, looking scared. Dean had positioned himself between the kid and them, protecting him. And again, that hurt Sam horribly because not long ago, he had been mentally complaining that Dean did that for him. "Each angel has a very specific mark. It's possible to read the mark and find the name of the angel that bought his soul."
As he sang, he let his feet guide him, not really thinking of the direction they were taking. As he did, the warmth in his arm grew, and he knew he was close to Cas.
“Morning, Sunshine,” Dean said, and since he had always been better at actions than at words, at least when Cas was concerned, he closed the distance between them in a kiss, at the same time that he crossed the Portal out of the empty, and the mariachi finished the song.
"Nothing on the Dean front, sorry" Ellen's voice calmed him a little. In those months, he had separated himself completely from people. Now, he had friends. And they were going to help him find his brother. "Gabriel thinks that someone must be  hiding him through some spell, and that's what we're looking at now. "
Castiel blinked, confused, as Dean broke their kiss and a huge cheer erupted from the hundreds of Mexicans around them as the portal to the Empty closed. He knew he was awake: in the Empty, he was only allowed to dream of things that had happened and he was pretty sure that Dean had never kissed him while dressed as a mariachi and shining with grace more powerful than an Archangel.
The Shadow blinked, confused. No one had ever cared for what they wanted. From the moment that the Light and Darkness had been created in that horrible explosion filled with noise and light, all contact with the realm of the Empty had been to know what they could take from the Shadow. From the promise to keep Demons and Angels asleep, to giving them back, to getting them inside again… it was all taking, no giving.
Sam risked a side glance at Bobby, who was discretely grabbing his gun. Sam did the same.  From experience, he knew that angels were immune to bullets, but he felt better with a weapon in his hand.
"He said his name was easy to guess," Aaron said, so softly that Sam almost missed it. "That every Epiphany, he got prayed on to help children. That's why he heard my prayer."
“We will,” Dean Winchester said, smirking at them as the humans kept singing behind the portal. Trumpets had been added now, and the song grow louder even without Dean’s voice leading it. “When you give me what I want.”
Dean Winchester smiled again, and this time, his smile was so bright that the Empty was, for a moment, covered in white rather than the black void it really was. And now, the Shadow understood perfectly why so many of their prisoners dreamed of this being.
In fact, as soon as he found Dean, he was going to apologize for a lot of things, starting with making him promise to go to Lisa. If Dean hadn't been alone on the road, this wouldn't have happened. Bobby would've kept an eye on him, of that, Sam was sure.
He missed his brother. Dean would know what to do. In fact, that's what he had been counting on from the moment he decided to jump into the Cage. That Dean would, despite the promise they made, find a way to save him, find a way to fix everything. But now... now he had to do it without Dean.
(Which was not the case when Anubis also came knocking, since Anubis wasn’t known for having a sense of humor. By then Sam was 70, and both he and Castiel wondered if Dean had just pissed off the whole Egyptian Pantheon because he liked being functionally immortal. Dean swore up and down that it was not the case, it had been the only way to save a young woman from being eaten by a giant crocodile)
It had been a very innocent question, one that had never crossed Dean's or Cas's mind, so they both looked at each other, as Sam kissed Jess' forehead.
When Zachariah and Uriel had come forward with the plan to work with Lilith and her demons to free Lucifer, Raphael had expressed doubt.
He had barely touched Earth when a new prayer reached him. A far more personal prayer, which was also impossible.
He hadn't let his father's prejudices make him ruin the best thing that had happened to his life before, and he was ready to give up, to tell John they'd see each other after Christmas... and now Cas was surprising him with the exact opposite news.
"Is there any way to figure out who gave him the staff?" Sam asked Castiel.  He guessed that if things got too complicated they could call Gabriel, but Sam figured they didn't need that much attention from the angelic brigade. The Archangel had made it very clear that he didn't want his brothers to know he was alive.
Part of their consciousness wanted to blame the angel. To think they had lied, made something to cheat. But they knew it was not the case. The angel had been truthful and took away all the noise. All the annoyances, so that the Shadow could rest.
. Lucifer's vessel and the one who would allow demons to walk the Earth. It had been difficult for Castiel to be around Sam in those days. But later, as he slowly fell from Grace and learned more about Sam,  it was just because there was nothing Castiel could do to answer said prayers. The little power he still had was reserved for when Dean needed it. Because Castiel would never not answer if Dean was in trouble.
By the time he was ready to go, at 103 years old and the oldest non-supernaturally protected hunter in history, Sam was surrounded by family and friends. His kids, his grandkids and even a couple great grand kids. None of them active hunters, but all of them aware of the dangers that went bump in the night. And all of them the apple of Sam’s life.
“The Empty won’t let Castiel go without a fight,” Jack shook his head. “And humans can’t go into it. Nor can I, or I would break the balance. Aunt Amara says…”
Dean, whether he wanted to or not. However, the bell at the door rang interrupting her."Oh, speak of the devil. Hi Dean! Alfie just left to meet you at the shop. Didn't he text you?"
"I don't know," Samandiriel answered, ignoring Dean's affronted signs. It seemed that now that they were there, the other angel had decided to forego the charade. "I didn't take his memories. I was just ordered to watch him."
The new angel, no, the former human, stopped in front of the Shadow, who now looked like a tiny blonde woman with short hair. Meg master’s first vessel, the Shadow knew. A demon who had hurt Dean, long before he met the sleeping angel.
He maneuvered to get his sword back, only to find that the first born that he still couldn't kill had grabbed it. A small annoyance that wouldn't save his life, but in fact, make it shorter.  Kutiel needed his sword to fight Castiel, and the human presented no real threat with it.  Avoiding Castiel's attacks, he jumped the table in the middle of the room to reach the human, who, almost mirroring Castiel, attacked him with the sword.
"He was Kutiel, an angel," Castiel answered, with no emotion. Bobby tried not to groan. Of all the people who shouldn't be explaining the supernatural to a civilian, the feathered idjit was probably on top of the list. At the very least, he always sounded sincere, so Dean would only think they were insane, not that they were trying to con him.
He had promised Dean that there would be no more secrets between them after what happened with Ruby. And he was going to fulfill that promise. As soon as they found Dean, as soon as he was in his rightful place in the passenger seat of the Impala, Sam was going to tell his brother
Caught by surprise as he was, he almost didn't register the shock in Gabriel's features until the archangel slammed him against the wall.
More humans were there, accompanied by Castiel, one of the rebels. The tall, younger human, was of no consequence. But the older man was also a first born. First, Kutiel would take care of Castiel, and then, when the only threat to him was vanquished, he would deal with the two humans.
"It'd be a nice change in our routine, yes," Cas was nodding. Of course, Cas could work wherever he wanted, being a writer. All he needed was his laptop.
“You want the annoying angel?” The Shadow narrowed their eyes as Dean smiled. The noise from the mariachi kept going, as they had now started a new song. And, from the looks of the portal, another big group had joined in. And onlookers were singing too.
"Raphael plans to free our brothers," Castiel said for the benefit of the mortals. That was why heaven was divided now. Samandiriel had thought once that it was all Castiel's fault. Castiel, and Anna, the two angels that had insisted that Father didn't want Paradise on Earth just yet. Now, he wasn't all that sure. "He must assume that with a fake set of memories, Dean would've more agreeable to accept Michael."
Either that, or he was still in hell because he was certainly being tortured. If this was Lucifer's plan, he couldn't have done better.
Sam had to choose between keeping his secret, or help Dean. Sam knew what Dean would do in his place, but he still wasn't ready to give that information up.
Castiel still couldn't believe it, not even as he entered the opulent mansion at the edge of the town. He remembered clearly when Uriel had given him the news, that Balthazar had been one of the many angels fallen to the unseen assassin that was destroying their garrison, the pain he had felt at knowing that his brother was no more.
"So the dead guys were part of a group that came here regularly," Bobby explained taking his notes. "According to everyone here, they all are a part of  a nice group of people, dedicated to their job. Hatch and Grey got a promotion over a difficult case not long ago, and they came here to celebrate."
"I am not sure," Castiel lowered his head. While the Angel didn't have many tells, that one was a very noticeable one. He didn't want to admit he didn't have all the answers. "It's a city  that is a complete blind spot for me.  I can enter it, but I don't remember what I saw inside once I leave. I've tried many times, with the same result. And there's a case for you there."
"I'm agent Moscone, I'm working with agents Cash and Denver in this case," the man with blue eyes said, not even blinking as he offered him his hand. And Dean, who usually hated to touch people, automatically raised his hand to shake it. As their hands touched, he felt a shock, as if he had licked a battery. It was so sudden that he had to remind himself to let go of Moscone's hand in order to keep signing.
"What did you do?!" Castiel repeated. He was also bleeding, but it wasn't a serious injury. He could heal it easily, once Charoun was dealt with.
It is a common misconception that angels are constantly listening to prayers. In fact, most angels couldn't care less when humans prayed. Castiel knew very well that most of his brothers and sisters considered humans a lesser life form and, when they actually lowered themselves to listen to the prayers in question, it was only to mock the inability of humans to deal with their problems on their own, always asking for their Father to solve their suffering with a miracle.
As Bobby  tried to remember everything that he had ever learned about ASL, he kept a close eye on Sam. It was obvious that the boy was not happy that Dean had seemingly recognized Castiel and not them. Because Dean had recognized the angel, there was no doubt about it.
Until he tried to get on the passenger seat of the Impala just to be stopped by Dean grabbing him by the shoulder.  Apparently, only "family" could ride Baby. Even Cas's offer to go with them had been denied.  Dean really didn't want anyone but his "brother" with him. And since Dean had said he was going to go with them, insisting on keeping a close eye on them was not going to make Dean like them more.
"So we're back on square one," Bobby finally interrupted, looking even angrier. "You should've taken away those scribbles of yours when you healed him."
Not that Sam couldn't guess that Dean was completely against the possibility of torturing a kid to get an answer. Sam agreed in principle, not only because it was an innocent kid who had made a shitty choice, but because he didn't want to think about the fact that it opened an option to figure out if Dean had also made a deal to get him out of hell.
"No. Dean is not in hell, and he wouldn't break again if that was the case," Castiel assured them, his voice regaining the steely resolve he got every time he denied that Dean could be dead. "And both the first and the last seal are needed, and they are impossible to change.  The last seal is Lilith's death. They cannot bring her back from where she was sent when Sam killed her. All the seals could break today, and it wouldn't make a difference to Lucifer's cage."
“Don’t be in such a hurry for me to die, Sam,” Dean joked. But mostly because he was starting to feel nervous. He hadn’t liked it when God seemed to have it in for him, even before they knew God was Chuck, he didn’t like this much attention on him.
One of the old angels was reacting to the voice. Not just “one” but “THE” one. The one that had taught the Shadow what it meant to be annoyed, to feel like control was slipping out of their hands and made history by being the first being the Shadow had wanted OUT, away from their realm and to never come back.
"Yep, Alfie's brother," Marion continued, with a very similar tone of voice to the one Becky got when she talked about Sam, which told Sam that he was going to hear everything wonderful about
"Sorry to tell you this, chocolate bear, but I'm lying low. There's a new boss in Hell, and he wasn't very fond of the whole free Lucifer plan."
"I'm sorry," he said, as soon as they were out of the building. Neither Bobby or Cas seemed to blame him, but Sam still needed to apologize. "I jumped the gun at the thought that Dean is the only person we have seen so far with a clear grudge against the victims."
"Dean is all right," Sam hurried to say, trying to comfort her. Or maybe to comfort himself. "I just... we got separated and I thought... when was the last time you saw him?"
They landed on their motel room, and as soon as they were there, Dean scrambled away from Cas, still holding the angel blade he had gotten from the dead angel. As his hands were occupied, Dean couldn't sign, but Sam could read his expression well enough. It was an expression he had seen more than once in the witnesses they talked to when they saw the supernatural for the first time.
Dean took a deep breath as the pain disappeared, and he could feel his body knitting itself up. It was just like in the old days, before they knew about Chuck, before Cas lost his powers. Apparently, Jack had fixed things up upstairs quite fast.
"Not really," Balthazar's smile grew wider as he touched his forehead. "The kid's debt is erased. I just needed him to send a big enough signal so you and the hairless apes would get a clue."
Lisa was the one who opened the door. And as soon as her eyes met his, Sam knew that his brother wasn't there.
Kutiel dropped his sword to the floor and tried to grab the mortal's neck. He was going to smite this first born, make him regret having touching him before sending him to the eternal garden. For the first time in his existence, Kutiel was angry.
“Ok, that’s enough of cryptic remarks, Cas,” Sam said before Dean could voice the same concern. “What is going on?”
“I think that’s a good idea,” Jack piped in, after a long time of consideration. “Castiel would like it too, because it would mean… no one is beyond redemption. Everyone gets a second chance, if they want to work for it.”
"He's not," Castiel tried to reassure the younger Winchester.  But the truth was that he couldn't quite tell. There were traces of angelic energy around Dean, but unless Castiel purposely touched Dean's soul again to make sure, now that he knew that Dean's  human voice had been replaced by an angel's.
Jack nodded, but soon he was frowning, as if listening to someone else. Sam figured he probably was.
Sam was starting to lose his patience. Dean was there, but he wasn't quite there. As soon as he had hugged his brother, Sam knew he had made a mistake. After all, his brother had never been a fan of physical shows of affection even under the best of circumstances. But instead of just getting away, and maybe punching Sam for being out of hell when he shouldn't be, Dean had started gesturing wildly,  not even uttering a word.
"But are we sure?" Gabriel pressed. "Or are we chasing our tails while your big brother is enjoying the memories of all his one night stands in heaven? Because you must know, after all you and your brother did? It's highly unlikely that you would go downstairs."
Charoun smiled, pulling out his own sword. "Even if Father is dead, we are still following his orders. Disobedience is the real crime, brother."
"He's a prophet who thought his dreams about Dean and me were just his imagination and decided to write our lives into very shitty novels,"  Sam explained, trying to find consolation in the knowledge that at the very least, he had stopped writing before they freed Lucifer, and that the existent books were out of print and forgotten in one dollar bins. After all, he had put an end to Becky and Chuck's plans to publish the following books himself.
“Cas!” Sam smiled as he saw Cas, Dean and Jack appear in the Bunker’s dinning room, trying hard not to comment on Dean’s clothes. Biting his lips not to, actually, but his companions weren’t that generous.
"I can't give him his memories back, and I can't let Raphael keep using him," Samandiriel said, looking down towards the sleeping Dean. That was as close to the truth as he could say.  It was what he could understand of his own motives anyhow.
"As it stands, silence is the only protection these mortals have." Charoun answered, still smiling, despite being hurt. His vessel was bleeding profusely, and there were bits of grace spilling out. He was defeated, and yet, he looked triumphant. That was what made Castiel stop.  That Charoun looked as if he wanted to be killed.
"I set an obvious trap for you and waited." Gabriel shrugged. "I  hoped that you would come before I had to bring Lou Ferrigno to the mix, but you were always slow that way."
"What the hell was that?" Bobby asked, immediately, not letting anyone talk. He could see that Sam was ready to punch Samandiriel, and that would only end up hurting the idjit boy more than the angel.  What they needed were answers, and fast. "Is an angel riding Dean?"
A demon whose regrets also swirled around Dean Winchester, albeit in a different way to the way Castiel’s did.
“We were really hoping that you would be able to stay alive until the negotiations finished,” Cas replied, looking down. It wasn’t until a few seconds had passed that Dean realized that he was looking at his name, carved in the table.
It helped a lot that Jack broke his own “no interference” rule to the wedding, and both he and Rowena agreed that no supernatural creature, demonic or heavenly, could enter the new Roadhouse if they had ill intent. It would be a safe space, and that’s how Sam wanted it.
Learning that Raphael had no intention of respecting their Father's wishes had been a strong blow to Castiel's already dwindling faith. But faced with the option of kneeling to what he knew was wrong, or rebelling again, he wasn't sure he still had the courage to do the right thing. Not without Dean's support.
At least not until a hunt with a young hunter that had not been trained by them, who didn’t know Dean personally so he wasn’t aware his partner at the time was THE Dean Winchester… and started praying to Dean to protect them from the Arachnes that had invaded America again.
"And the Dean we know would never leave his younger brother alone, especially if he thinks that his brother could be in danger." Singer finished. "So how are we going to convince this Dean to come with us?"
“So… what dumb deal you made to get me out, Dean?” Castiel asked, worried. Not about his confession before the Shadow took him, as Dean’s kiss back there, and the fact that the former human was not letting go of his hand, while his grace caressed Castiel’s invisible wings, made quite clear that Castiel had completely misinterpreted Dean’s feelings.
The Shadow blinked, confused. And then blinked again, as a new feeling came to be known within their frame.
After another bout of tossing and turning, and wishing themselves a glass of warm milk, and counting even more sheep to the point that parts of the inky Empty were starting to look like actual sheep, the Shadow remembered the box the Angel had given them.
However, the idea that now angels were making deals with humans was sickening. Because if now Angels were willing to trade with souls, there was no much difference between them and Demons, in Sam's book.
It was noisy, and loud, but despite themselves, the Shadow had to admit… it was beautiful in a “If I didn’t want to sleep right now, I’d appreciate it” sort of way.
“We can try to find another way! We’ve found many spells in the Men of Letters’ Bunkers, maybe there’s one to allow humans into…” Sam insisted, but Dean was too tired to let him go on. He was itching to get to Cas, and he knew that even if everyone agreed with his plan, even if Jack turned him into an angel right there and then? They still would need to wait, to make sure everything else in his plan was ready.
For one second, Sam was tempted to tell her everything. She already knew what he and Dean did, she had faced a changeling using the face of her son trying to kill her. But then he saw her house. Her perfect house, where no demon, vampire, werewolf or ghost had ever stepped in and he couldn't bring himself to tell her. He told himself that Dean would never forgive him if he brought the horrors of their lives to Lisa's doorstep.
Eileen had died a few months earlier, and she was the first one to meet him in the new heaven, before Jack begged him to become Heaven’s representative in the ongoing talks about Dean’s final rest.
"And what is it?" Bobby asked, standing next to the driver's door. They probably would end up going back to the motel where they were staying, since they had absolutely no clues to go on.
"What the hell did you do to him?!" Sam and Bobby yelled, bringing up their useless guns. Castiel couldn't blame them for being angry, but until he figured out what was Samandiriel's angle, they were running the risk of hurting Dean, so he moved slightly, just enough so he could block any bullet fired. "Why did you put him to sleep?"
“I’m sorry?” Jack frowned and tilted his head. It was a lot more unnerving now than before, and it reminded Sam a bit of when Jack had just been born, before they knew the kid wasn’t as evil as his biological dad. “Dean… I just want to…”
Not that he would be much better. Sam had to admit that he wasn't very good at letting go either. After all, he had also tried to exchange his soul for his brother's.
"You're in danger." The note said, making  Grant laugh internally. That was perfect, to have an actual threat in the handwriting of the suspect. "You've got to go away from Easter."
Dean gestured quickly, a movement that Sam figured meant 'how' since Castiel kept explaining even as Sam wished that the angel would just stop. Or lie. But as far as he knew, Cas was incapable of lying to Dean.
His voice sounded hoarse, and he spat a bit of blood. Yeah, that was a huge sign that he should be dead. Dean took a deep breath despite the pain, and cringed. He had been dead enough times to know this was not a wound you walked away from. And still, he was still alive.
Yes, he could wait to hear the explanation in the Bunker, especially if it meant Cas was staying around.
Once Sam and Castiel had explained about the blind spot, he had agreed to go with them as backup.  While he also thought that whatever that was powerful enough to  block an angel's memory was perhaps a bit above their abilities, there was no way in hell that he was going to let Sam go there alone. At first, he had been sending Sam on easy hunts in order to distract him a bit from the fact that none of them seemed to be able to find his brother, but he'd be damned if they managed to lose Sam in the process.
“I can send everyone who is currently sleeping to this Purgatory realm,” The Shadow said, carefully. Dealing with Dean Winchester was very different from dealing with the Light. For once… the Shadow actually believed Dean was not trying to manipulate them. “But if you want me to spare Castiel… you will have to find him. I… I am not exactly sure where I put him to sleep.”
"You always have had little faith, Dean," Castiel said. "Kutiel was called down by the staff of Moses in order to kill the officers that killed Christopher Birch. We came here to retrieve the staff and assure that no innocents will be harmed by it."
"Oh, thank god, I found you!" Sam looked up, confused.  Becky Rosen was standing in front of him, next to three wheeled suitcases, a backpack and a pet carry on. "I was so afraid that Chuck had  decided to change the name of the town where Bobby lived, so I'd have to walk around the whole South Dakota looking for you. And now that I think of it, maybe Chuck
Sam grimaced. Remembering the months without Dean was a sure way to make himself question why the hell they were trusting the Archangel. But it made sense that there was something magic keeping them from finding his brother. With all the resources they had
It wasn’t until Sam went to Heaven for the final time when Dean and Cas noticed that something else had changed. It started with a small whisper in the back of Dean’s head at weird times. As if someone was calling his name, but no matter where they were, Dean never could find the person calling.
"Because  angels might be after you, and while Cas here can offer some protection, he also needs to help us figure out why they're after you," Sam said. "Look, if you want, we can bring you stuff to help us with the research, but it's safer for everyone if you stay here."
“So, what now? You’re… not leaving again, are you?” Sam asked the question Dean wanted to ask. But Dean didn’t really trust his voice with that. He knew he’d sound like a needy girlfriend, which was not who he wanted to be with his angel.
Cas nodded. He had only met John Winchester once, and the meeting had not been particularly pleasant. John was not precisely homophobic, but he had made it clear to Cas that he had hoped that Dean would settle with 'that nice girl Lisa from the yoga class'. Mary had been nicer, only once mentioning that she would have to count on Sam for grandkids.
"Where the hell have you been?" the agent was saying, still getting into Dean's personal space. "We went to look for you at Lisa's! Cas and Gabriel have  gone everywhere in the world and you... you were here?! Why didn't you call Bobby?"
After the apocalypse that wasn't, Castiel now appreciated the irony of it. After all, all angels, from the lowliest cupid to the most powerful archangel, were just waiting for their Father to come back and tell them what to do.
, causing him to choke to death.  Finally, Edward  Colfax, had died when a bunch of locusts hatched from his brain.
"At least promise me you'll let me know when you find Dean," she said, glaring at Sam. It was obvious that she wasn't happy with his answer. "Let me know that he's really fine. If you can't tell me what had him so spooked, at least don't let me think that he's dead in a ditch somewhere."
"What kind of deal did you make, Dean?"  Sam  yelled, making Dean step back. After all, Sam was imposing when he wanted. "Is this why you don't remember us?"
He had dreamed with Dean dressed as a mariachi, yes, but it had been when he had been human and as far as Castiel knew, only Metatron knew about that.
"Enough stalling, Sam, you're here," he told himself as he knocked on the door. Even if Chuck knew the truth, it was all right. Because it meant that he also knew where Dean was.
"What the hell is wrong with him, Bobby?" the agent asked at the same time, finally clueing in that Dean had no idea what he was talking about.
"We don't know," Sam shook his head. "If he got in an accident, it had to be right after he left Bobby, but he didn't look to have any scars. "
Castiel himself was still not completely comfortable inside Jimmy's body. In contrast, Balthazar almost seemed to have been born human. Almost like Gabriel.
Grant was not going to let an investigation put all his pension on hold just because an idiot mute mechanic with nothing but a GDA to his name had a chip on his shoulder. He was going to get rid of Derringer, and then wait for whatever God had decided as his punishment.
Sorry, sorry, this has been slow. But the latest episodes have made really hard for me to write protective!Sam. Hopefully, a rewatch of the whole series will help to get away from this block.
"That's the dead kid brother," Bobby explained to him as they followed Dean into his apartment. "Dean has been counseling him since the death of his brother."
“Why are you so eager to throw away your humanity, Dean?” Sam yelled, now angry. “After what happened with Michael… “
Because when she hadn't been able to erase those damned runes, Raphael had sent more angels to help her. She knew each one of them, and where they were posted, as Dean's friends, coworkers, clients... and of course, his brother.
After the first week of waiting for any news, Bobby had sent  Sam to check a series of disappearances and mysterious deaths in Indiana, not far from Lisa's house.  Sam tried his best to avoid her, with no answers about Dean's whereabouts which means that what would've been a somewhat simple hunt for a group of djinn take far longer than it should. Or perhaps it had been just that, without Dean, Sam didn't have the heart to put his all into the hunt.
As for which afterlife ended up claiming the God of Hunters? Well, the negotiations are still ongoing so I will have to get back to you on that.
There was no constant humming or snoring, or even that annoying buzz that sometimes permeated the edges of the Empty where it touched the Light’s realm.
He walked into the Gas-N-Sip, hoping that they would have pie. While 'Dean Derringer' had never mentioned having a favorite food, Sam knew his brother, and his brother would never pass up the chance to eat some pie. And maybe that would be enough to sparkle something... at the very least, the knowledge that there as something wrong with his memories, something to make Dean trust them enough to let Castiel touch his soul.
Dean was about to yell indignantly when he realized Cas was smiling. And the warmth in his chest grew.
Zachariah? The slimy toad would probably be the first one to try to kiss Jack’s ass now that he was God.
"I know a spell," Castiel explained, as Dean turned to glare at Sam. Apparently they had asked the same thing at the same time.
But the angel was asleep now too, he had fulfilled their deal and the Empty was silent again. Not Empty, but Silent. And that was ok with the Shadow, even if now they had a bit of a conflict because how could they be the Empty if it wasn’t Empty. And was it Empty even if They were the only ones there?
“It’s ok, Cas,” Dean was a bit flattered that Cas had spent his own afterlife talking about him. “Uh… It is not getting me, is it?”
“It’s not enough for me,” Dean said, getting up and way too close to Cas. Close enough to kiss if he wanted. And oh, now that he knew he could have Cas, that Cas felt the same way? He wanted. But he needed to clear the air first. “Especially because you never let ME say it. What was it you said after Purgatory? That you knew so I didn’t have to speak up?”
"What about Hatch? Did he also eat there?" Bobby asked, taking notes. It wasn't much to go on, but if it was the only place that the victims had in common besides the police station, it was better than nothing.
Bobby swore under his breath, narrowing his eyes. Back in his study, away from curious eyes, he had a package that had arrived just the day after the apocalypse that wasn't. Dean had left it in the motel where Sam hunted him when he had been adamant to accept Michael's offer, and some helpful clerk had mailed it to Singer's Salvage yard. While he had intended to give it back as soon as Dean called him to tell him where he was, Bobby's curiosity had gotten the best of him, and he had read Dean's letter to Sam. That was exactly the same promise Dean had asked of his brother. Apparently, the idjits were both convinced that the other had to get out of the business, even if neither was in any hurry to do it themselves.
"Exactly what happened between the dead officers and this kid?" he asked Dean, trying to keep himself on track. The truth was that he was sure that they were no longer that invested in the exploding cops, but there was still work to do.
In the two years they had been together, Cas had seen Dean angry in many occasions. At the school, when Cas's job had been endangered because Cas had suspended the son of the president of the parent's board because the kid had been bullying and harassing a girl from his class, Dean had practically single handedly organized a demonstration outside the school. When clients were particularly difficult at Singer's Garage, where Dean worked. Whenever something happened to hi s brother Sam. Usually after a phone conversation with his father. When a jerk barista refused to serve Cas because of his discrete rainbow pin on the lapel of his trenchcoat, Dean had come to his rescue, making the barista end up almost in tears.
“I promise. In fact,” Dean threw a small box to them. “Here. This helps me when I can’t have my four hours a night.”
Sam and Castiel have found Dean... but things are not going to go easy for them as many other angels are keeping watch on the city of Easter.
“It’s not fair, Cas, that you got to say it and I didn’t,” Dean said, breathing the words against Castiel’s lips. “That you went away before I could reply. That you said you knew my feelings… and yet thought me was someone you couldn’t have.”
"Is Dean possessed?" Sam asked, with so much concern that Castiel figured that it wouldn't be long before Dean would start asking again why those strangers were so concerned about his well being.
At that, Cas looked up, locking eyes with Dean, who immediately swallowed. Cas’s gaze was as intense as ever, looking straight into Dean’s soul. And Dean wondered how he had been so stupid not to notice the love that Cas’s eyes irradiated. It was so clear, now that Dean knew what to look for. Now that he knew the truth. And he wondered how Cas couldn’t see the same on his own eyes. How much he meant to Dean.
"Cas... what do you mean, we're spending Christmas with your parents?" Dean asked again, rough and angry. Even the nickname that Cas had once found annoying sounded like a threat.
Sam disliked Dean's 'brother' the moment the kid entered the room. It was not really the kid's fault, he figured, except that he was part of what kept Dean trapped in this place. The kid didn't even looked like Dean, not enough to be passed off as his brother. He was shorter than Dean to start with, which was just wrong. He had brown short hair, and at the moment was wearing a horrible white and red shirt from the Weiner hut.
Dean signed slowly, just to check if the agent understood him and realized that he actually could hear them.
"He is safe," Castiel answered, not even bothering to ask. Which meant that the prophet's disappearance had to do with Heaven. "No matter where he is, if he was in danger,  I believe Raphael would protect him."
(The fact that later Uriel had been revealed as the assassin had made the pain even worse. It was the first moment when Castiel thought about going against his orders, because he couldn't understand how following their Father's will could bring so much destruction to his brothers)
"What the hell was that?" Sam asked, once the sound stopped. His ears hurt, and he was pretty sure he was feeling the beginnings of the worst headache of his life.
So, if he couldn't convince Alfie that becoming a hunter and leaving everything behind was stupid... then there was only one possible solution.
A battle between Angels was something that a human mind couldn't comprehend.  It was a battle through dimensions, through time and space. But fortunately for Castiel, that was only when they were in their true forms. Inside vessels, it took time to get used to fight in just one dimension, with just two arms, one head. Unlike his brothers, Castiel had spend the last two years inside his vessel, never leaving Jimmy except for when Zachariah had forced him out for 'rehabilitation', so he had far more experience fighting in the human plane. Charoun was not used to his vessel, and while Castiel  hesitated for a second, thinking about the poor man who had consented for his body to be used as a weapon of the Lord, at the end that experience gave him the upper hand.
"What happened to Lucifer and Michael? And where is your brother?" Castiel urged, stepping forward and all but ignoring Singer, who was frowning at Sam. As if he had just realized that if Sam was free from hell, that meant that the Apocalypse could still happen.
"It doesn't feel like that," both Samandiriel and Castiel answered at the same time. Castiel glared at Samandiriel who just stared back, not intimidated. How the kid had managed to pretend he was human long enough to fool Dean, even an amnesic Dean, Bobby didn't know.
"Dean is hidden  from all angels," Castiel explained. "But I hoped that perhaps you knew another way to find him."
Same as when they found out that hunters were starting to wear a little squirrel charm to symbolize Dean. Apparently, Odin had gotten tired to wait, and he and Crowley of all people had ganged up together to start the rumor that Dean was the God of Hunters, protector of Innocents, and that he favored the Squirrel as his totem.
"Dean isn't in heaven or hell," Castiel interrupted with such certainty that Sam couldn't help but be glad. If Cas was sure of it, then Dean was alive. Any doubt created by Gabriel's words dispelled instantly. "I can't sense his body, but I know his soul. If he had died, I would've known immediately. "
"Dean, this are the agents Cash and Denver. They were asking about Officer Hatch..." Marion choose that moment to interrupt, although now she was looking at Sam with a  weary expression, rather than the slightly flirty look that she had given him when they arrived.   "... although they're a little weird."
“Yes, of course,” Cas hesitated, just a second, before touching Dean’s forehead. It was then when Dean realized that he had not said the words that were stuck in his throat after Cas confessed his love, what Dean tried to say when the Empty arrived and only muttered to himself when he was alone.
"What do you have for me, Ellen?" He asked as he answered his phone. He was thinking about not going back to Bobby's but just driving, finding himself a crossroads and then finding any demon who was willing to talk to a Winchester just to find his brother. So far, that plan had been nixed by everyone as no one really knew what was going on in Hell, and no one wanted to alert some of the bigger threats that Dean was missing. But Sam was starting to lose hope, starting to feel like he had in those months that hadn't happened, after Dean had died for the 101st  time.
"Not if it's just for your general Michael to kill him as soon as he's out," the demon pointed out. Raphael smiled, as he had been expecting this.
"We had... he... We worked better as friends," Becky said, still smiling like a damned doll. "It was better for both of us. And I don't think he knew he was going to 'disappear'... It's more like... he suspected someone might come for him. He said... he said that some angels were still listening. That things could go two ways, depending on what you did on Stull and... he kept notes of both things. And
Dean shook his head, that was not good enough for him. In fact, it sounded once again as if Cas was giving up just because he thought it'd make Dean happy. And that was not a good way for this Christmas. Or for their relationship. Dean hated that Cas gave up so easily when it was something that was obviously important to him.
Dean dared to open one eye to confirm that yes, he was still on the barn. Still pinned like a stupid butterfly, and his back still hurting like hell. And no Reaper in sight to get him out of his misery.
Only that Dean had drunk far more than his usual limit, and still didn’t even feel a buzz. While Sam had fallen asleep about ten minutes earlier, in the middle of Castiel’s explanation on why Eve’s claim for Dean was sort of valid, despite Dean killing her and sending her back to Purgatory seconds later.
“Shut up!” The Shadow yelled at the new Angel, who was now smiling as he sang. As if he knew who his voice was reaching. And behind him, the humans who were beyond their reach, kept playing and singing along, making the noise louder, stronger.
"Dean... I thought you wanted to spend Christmas with John, Mary and Sam... I can call Father and tell him we will be home after Christmas, for New Year's."
It was loud, which automatically made it bad. But it was worse because the Shadow could feel that, within the Empty, something… SOMEONE… was stirring at the voice.
"Derringer!" Grant yelled, calling the attention of the mute mechanic. "You want to talk about the case, come here."
“I will explain in the Bunker, where we have some privacy,” Cas finally said, then looked straight into Dean’s eyes. Straight into Dean’s soul. “I trust you can get there without getting killed again?”
The Wiener Hut was exactly like every other grease filled, heart attack inducing place that Dean loved so much. That was Sam's first impression upon reading the menu, that didn't include pie, but had deep fried oreos as part of their dessert.
Officer Grant was nervous. Everything had gotten out of control since the Birch kid's death. At first, he had thought that they would get away with it. IT had been an accident.  Hatch had honestly believed that Birch was carrying a gun. An honest mistake that shouldn't have cost Hatch his badge, so Grant had agreed with Colfax and Grey to keep it silent when they planted the gun. But then the thing with Hatch had happened, and then Grey and Grant hadn't been able to deny that God himself was punishing them.
“Not really, Dean,” Cas replied, making Sam frown. “I just made sure your body wouldn’t betray your… situation.”
"I'm on the 90, just past Chamberlain, Cas." Sam said and hung up the phone just as the angel appeared in the passenger seat. At times, Sam wondered if it wouldn't be better just to ask Cas to erase the enochian sigils from his ribs so Cas could find him easily, but  somehow, it never seemed a good moment to ask.
A hunting trip to Mexico complicated his after-life situation a bit as Quetzalcoatl decided that Dean should’ve honored with the Aztec warriors of the past, but by then the negotiations were so stalled that the other leaders found the new addition somewhat fun.
"I guess?"  the officer shrugged, pointing to the table behind him. Sure enough, there was a red and white take out bag with the Wiener Hut logo. "Half the station eats there because it's close."
"What was the case?" Sam asked at the same time as the waiter came to their table to take their order. Once he had left,  Sam continued. "Could that have gotten them any enemies?"
But he didn't got to see what Derringer was writing. The room started shaking, and the wall grew brighter, almost enough to blind him.
"Don't!" Bobby swore, as a minute passed and the angel didn't come back. Given his speed, that was worrisome. "Idjit angel. Call him to make sure he didn't get mojoed into forgetting why are we here again."
"I'm sorry to have bothered you." Sam started to leave, when Lisa grabbed his arm. She was fighting back tears, and Sam felt his heart break. That was his fault. He should've made sure that Dean was there before bothering her. But now it was to late to take that back.
"That was the plan, yes," Samandiriel lowered his head, checking that Dean was still asleep.  He was keeping the mortal asleep, but Dean had surprised him once before.
He had been very careful on the trip, biting his own lips as to avoid talking again. And that had been a surprise. He hadn't even noticed when he had started singing along his tapes, and he was terrified at the idea that he could have hurt his brother when his voice had, apparently, destroyed all the window panes from both his baby and Singer's Chevelle.  Castiel, had fixed both with a touch, but it felt wrong for Dean. If he had hurt the Impala, it had to be him the one who fixed it. He had promised his father that he would take care of the Impala when he had inherited it. After all, it was the only good thing in his life that his father had given him.
Despite the fact that Castiel thought it was impossible, and it could be a trap, he couldn't ignore this prayer. Sam himself  he could and had ignored more than once. At first, because Sam was an
Instead, he closed his eyes and let his consciousness free. He couldn't find Dean. That was far beyond his powers. But there was one other angel who didn't hate the Winchesters, and who had more than once proved that not  all laws regarding angels applied to him.
“Why? The Shadow wants quiet, no? The best thing we can offer them so they will give us back Cas without a fight is to make sure they get that quiet and Purgatory is as good a place to put every demon and angel we’ve ganked!” Dean crossed his arms, glaring at his brother. He knew, deep down, that that part of the plan was not what Sam was really objecting to, but he wasn’t ready to explain his reasons for the other part. At the very least, Jack seemed to agree with Dean. And if he had the new God’s back up, Dean could handle Sam’s bitchface.
"I... I think it was three weeks ago? Before the strange storms in Kansas," Lisa said, her eyes turning a little colder. "He said something was going to happen, but that me and Ben... we shouldn't worry. He said he was going to make arrangements for us to be safe and... some other things."
In the end, the trip to Kripke's Hollow wasn't a complete waste of time. Sure, now Sam had to find both Dean AND Chuck, with no clues at all to what could've happened to the former, but Becky had promised him that she would keep looking for  Chuck's missing notes.
Alfie seemed relieved at that, as he hugged him tightly, not letting him sign anymore. However, he could still see the other men. Singer and the angel looked happy, as if they had been counting on him to come along. But Winchester? He looked furious.
Winchesters weren't very good at letting go, he guessed. One more thing that was wrong with Dean here.
"We found Dean," Sam interrupted. While a weapon of Heaven on Earth sounded like bad news, he was far more interested in his brother. After they figured out what was wrong with Dean, then they could worry about the dick angels and whatever they were doing.
“No more deals, I promise,” Dean beamed at him. “But that’s a conversation to have back at home. Jack? Want to do the honors and show Cas your new powers?”
“I’m not drunk,” Dean said, interrupting Cas, but low enough not to wake up Sam. “Is that your doing?”
Dean frowned, looking at Samandiriel, before turning back to Castiel again. For one moment, the angel was afraid that his friend would try to speak again, but instead, Dean started signing again.
Castiel beamed at being called Dean’s husband so brightly, that all supernatural creatures thought Earth had suddenly grown a new sun.
I don't know if it's the same in the USA, but since angels are all knowing, I'm pretty sure that Castiel would know that yes, every 6 of January, Kids of Mexico, Spain and other parts of the world ask toys from Balthazar (Well, and Melchor and Gaspar,and they're not angels, but the name fits. And I didn't want to torture Aaron so... sorry about that)
"If it is a witch, it must be really powerful to hid a whole town from you," Sam started thinking about his father's notes. But nothing he could think of was able to actually liquefy a person. In fact, that sounded a little bit out of his league.
But worse than the frustration, the pity, the anger or even the fear, there was also a small nagging doubt.
"So whatever you did to my friends can catch up with me?" Grant asked. He couldn't turn on his recorder, because this was not an official interrogation, but at the very least, he could make Derringer write everything.
Until Dean signed that if they were going to get on the road, he was not going to leave "Baby" behind.
“Yeah, but I love…” Sam stopped himself at the middle of the sentence, as if he was finally figuring things out. He looked at Dean, who simply shrugged and looked away. He knew what Sam was thinking, but Dean wasn’t ready to confirm his brother’s suspicions. Not because he didn’t love Cas, but because he wanted his angel to be the first one to hear him say the words.
They were starting to fall asleep again, when suddenly a strange portal opened up, filling the empty that was not empty with light. The Shadow was up in a second, and was about to shriek that they were tired of angels and demons and rifts when something even worse happened.
And, armed with courage as Castiel was not flying away, Dean finally closed the distance between them and locked their lips into a passionate kiss.
"Even if Lucifer gets out, you won't accept to be his vessel again,  will you?" Castiel raised his tone, just a little. But enough for Sam to realize that the angel was getting angry.  "Without his true vessel, Lucifer cannot fight Michael, not even if Michael still could use your brother Adam."
“Only Demons, Angels and horsemen,” Jack said sadly. “And I don’t think anyone will volunteer to help since…”
"I know," Dean interrupted his thoughts, as if he had read them. "Dad... wants to patch up things with Sam. Mom says that, after his accident, Dad has been rethinking a lot of things."
As soon as Sam and Bobby were at his reach, Cas touched Sam's shoulder and Dean's forehead. Sam knew that his brother hated this kind of transportation, but they were in short notice. And yes, part of him was aware that Dean had a life here, and people would wonder how two men ended up dead in a room where Dean had been with them, but at the moment he didn't care.
"We cannot sense Dean with our grace," Samandiriel explained. He was sure it had been Castiel's work, although he could sense Sam Winchester without problems. He should mention that to Castiel, except that then... then he would be accepting that he wasn't on Raphael's side. He would've rebelling. "If he left Easter, where Raphael has him watched in every corner... it would be impossible for us to find him again unless someone prayed the information to us. Even if only Raphael can give him back his memories... at the very least he would be safe, wouldn't he?"
Truth was... Dean didn't know anything about Cas's past, and that was how Cas liked it most of the time.
The Shadow started to feel a new emotion they had never felt before. A cold stirring in the part that, had they been human, would’ve called their stomach.
“Nice duds, brother. Did they come with the upgrade Sam said you got?” Benny LaFitte grinned, as he took a swig of a beer. The vampire hadn’t been too keen on returning to Earth at first, but Sam had apologized for his actions before, and swore they could make him human again so he had finally agreed. Sam wasn’t sure they could do what he promised, but he guessed that between the Men of Letter’s library, Rowena’s sources and Jack’s powers, something could be done.
