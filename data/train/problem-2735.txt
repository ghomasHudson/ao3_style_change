This chapter got ridiculously long, so my beta rightly advised me to split it in two. So stay tuned for the rest of their third night in the Walters house :)
“It's electrifyin'!” the boy sang with exaggerated drama. Sherlock’s face turned ten shades of red. He knew the boy was just having a little fun and meant no harm, but he was not amused.
“John. Breathe. What happened?” Sherlock’s hands gripped his face, forcing him to steady himself.
She focused her attention, and pulled the trigger.
"A scavenger hunt!"
They waved their lights around, looking for anything of interest in this empty, seemingly random room in the back of the cellar. Sherlock felt around the walls, knocking on certain spots, wiggling loose boards and bricks.
– save you from Vizzini!”
“Actually I, uh, had a pretty bad reaction last time I had Thai. I think I’ve developed some kind of aversion to the nuts in the sauce or something. Or maybe it’s the spices. I’ll just grab dinner somewhere else.”
Side note: the night swim part of this chapter was inspired by an art piece by @anotherwellkeptsecret on tumblr. I don't know how to link to blogs or posts on AO3 otherwise I'd direct you, but go check her out if you get a chance!
What did this mean for her? For them?
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed all the little games you’ve been playing. With me. With Sherlock. All the little glances and the secret rendezvous. And the spying on me. I’ve just about had it. And I’m not putting up with you.”
“Who said anything about taking lives? I’m simply going to take what I need from them, and if they seem to possess valuables, rob them of everything they own that could prove to be of use to me.”
“Then how the bloody hell do you explain last night? Did I try to strangle myself? What about Josephine? She just made up her whole childhood, did she?”
He got a deep, disappointed sigh in return. Like a mother dealing with a stubborn child.
The gunshot echo rang in his ears.
“You're the one that I want. You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey.”
John smiled teasingly. “Wow, Sherlock. I never knew you to be so insightful about relationships.”
The light drone of the ceiling fan lulled them into a drowsy daze. John’s eyelids grew heavier by the second, his blinks slower, his mind hazier. He would fall asleep any minute.
She kicked the drawers shut and half-sprinted to the window bench John didn’t know could open. She’d even covered the surface in plush, decorative pillows so there would never be a need to sit on it. She brushed them all off in one careless sweep and lifted the top.
“Well, we know Moriarty has been following a very distinct pattern with his pirating, which we’ve tracked successfully up until now. John and his comrades hold the next vital piece of information necessary to complete this pattern. If we are to catch up to Moriarty before he slips away again, John will need to forfeit every bit of information on Moriarty’s whereabouts. Or at least everything he can remember from the last time they met.”
“Shh, you can’t giggle, it’s a crime scene,” Sherlock murmured gently against the corner of his lip, a callback of their first case together.
At some point in the journey, John walked ahead of him, seemingly a little affronted. Sherlock didn’t blame him. He remained behind and let John get far ahead of him, watching the slight stomp in his step and frustrated hunch of his shoulders. When they reached home, John turned into the alley first. As soon as he disappeared into it, Sherlock heard an unexpected thud and a light grunt.
"I knew it. He's changed you, Sherlock. Whether you want to admit it or not. You've got a soft spot for him, and we won't stand for it."
“I’ve scouted out the building. Due to the layout, you won’t have to worry about any other eyes being on you.”
“I know,” Victor groaned. “Drove me up the walls. But god, he was a good shag. That man can suck a dick like no one I’ve never met, man or woman. Ungodly talent.”
He opened his mouth, but Sherlock cut him off. "It's okay, John. You don't need to speak." Sherlock didn't want to be comforted right now. He was hurting and did not wish to discuss this any further. But he wasn't pushing John away either, who was still pressed to his forehead and holding both his hands, which meant he craved company and security.
“Thank you, Angelo.”
What the hell was he doing? He and Sherlock were
All the lanterns in the hallway and living room had already set fire to the rest of the house. John began coughing into his sleeve when smoke got in his lungs.
John stood on the floor for several moments as his brain caught up with what had happened. Whereas a moment ago he had hated Julia with every fiber of his being, his heart now went out to her. They were fighting the same battle, and he mentally wished her all the best. At least he didn’t have to worry about tracking her texts like he had with Irene Adler, he thought on a slightly more positive note. Finally shaking his head clear, he wormed his way off the floor and set out looking for Sherlock.
The carnival scene was inspired by Beyonce's XO music video :) Also now that we're about half way done, I want to take a moment and thank everyone who's kept up with this story, and also new readers for giving it a chance! It means to world to me <33
Comments and kudos are greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading :)
John looked up from where he was sitting reading the paper. They had barely communicated for days. Their conversations were limited solely to “good mornings,” “good nights,” and “I’ll be home later.”
“I’ll figure it out, John. Don’t worry about me.”
He reached out and ever so gently held Sherlock’s chin between his fingers, his breath ghosting over his lips.
he thought. That was okay, he figured. He can always talk to Sherlock in more detail later.
“What do you want, Jim?”
“Lestrade,” he panted.
Sherlock placed his skull on the mantelpiece – the one he’d had since he was a boy. It was one of his most prized possessions. He’d picked it up from his mum and dad’s house that morning, glad to finally move it into his new home. He straightened it until the angle was just right and then stepped back. It was one of the last little touches the flat needed, like his framed picture of the periodic table and John’s Union Jack pillow. After a month of unpacking and rearranging things to their liking, 221B had begun to feel like home. Sherlock put his hands on his hips, admiring the setup of the mantlepiece and fireplace with a satisfied smile.
John merely glared at him in reply. “Anyway, this does put a bit of a damper on my plans for the rest of the evening.” He looked up. Menacing thunder clouds were rolling in.
He unsuccessfully yanked at the knob once more before sheer terror overtook him and he began pounding his fists on the door.
This is what he got for letting someone into his heart again. Caring was not an advantage. Sherlock flopped down onto his bed, dreading the morning when he would have to face John's rejection. Again.
Sherlock paused uncomfortably before speaking, shifting anxiously from one foot to the other.
Sherlock rested atop his head, wrapping his arms back around him.
“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. So it’s alright then? If I . . .”
Of course he did, he thought was a weak smile as he wrapped his arms around his shoulders.
“Come on, Sherlock. I grew up just like everyone else. I pictured my wedding day. I wondered what it would be like to have kids. These are just normal thoughts people have. But I don’t
John heard the men scurry away and finally dared to move. He attempted to sit up when a shiny black boot on his chest shoved him back down. He looked up, and on the other end of it was a tall, lean man squinting down at him. He had a pale skin and head of messy, black curls topped off by an impressive black pirate hat. He wore a thin, white shirt with a long, black coat that trailed behind him dramatically.
Saying he missed Sherlock was perhaps the understatement of the year, but it would have to do for now. It seemed to be enough for Sherlock, who remained frozen with his fork still in the air, his eyes now wide and glistening.
“Sorry, what?”
He didn’t fail to see the irony in working their case. His client was in love with her best friend (Pierto) and concerned that he was in a somewhat abusive relationship with Beppo. Little did he know how much his life would reflect this particular situation in the coming years.
Sherlock sat up, clutching at his chest. He pulled his hand away to reveal three lines slashed through his shirt, over his left pectoral, and blood oozing out of the gashes in his skin.
Sherlock continued ruthlessly, his voice beginning to wobble.
In an instant, Sherlock’s eyes darkened. John could practically see the carnal desires and instincts taking over.
“No… Sherlock,” John moaned again, much louder this time.
“It’s . . . likely,” he answered quietly. “The timing just makes sense.”
Stop it, John coached himself.
Sherlock raised his head slightly from his microscope. He was still looking at it, but his vacant eyes showed that his mind was elsewhere. His shoulders had slumped like a guilty child being confronted by his parents.
“Can you remember where they are now?” John could feel Victor’s breath on the side of his face as he spoke, and his voice vibrating in his chest against his back. As much as he tried to keep his head up, he couldn’t stop it from rolling back against Victor’s shoulder as the blade suddenly pressed harder into his skin.
He leapt out of bed and grabbed his robe. That’s it. Whether he had imagined it or not, he wasn’t going to get any sleep like this. More annoyed with the night’s happenings than scared, he trudged downstairs and straight to the master bedroom.
John knew it. Uncovering Mary’s history, the forgiveness, the miscarriage. Sherlock was by his side through the whole thing. Never once wavering.
“John,” Sherlock warned. He knew he wouldn’t want him arguing, that it would be better to just cooperate, but he didn’t care.
Sherlock caught him and spun him outwards, both of them now smiling ear to ear from pure enjoyment.
“We’re eventually going to have to ack-”
But he would rather have Sherlock as a friend than not have him in his life at all. If that meant a lifetime of unrequited feelings and unspoken love, so be it. At least they would be together - sort of. He heaved a heavy sigh and at last got out of bed.
John’s stomach threatened to upheave everything inside it. He thought he even felt a little hot, acidic vomit rise up in his throat. His body begged to physically recoil from Evans’ sickeningly tender touches, but he couldn’t move an inch. Evans seemed to thrive off his discomfort. The horrifying smile on his face only grew the longer he squirmed.
“Right. Yeah, I was just wondering.”
John watched in dismay as the men tore through the ship he had grown to love, rummaging through bins, tearing open cupboards, wiping shelves clean. They looted through everything John, Molly, and Greg had held dear and carried it back to Moriarty’s ship over the board that connected them.
John automatically stood up, doctor mode activated. His first instinct was to ask what happened, inquire about the case and find out what had gotten him in this state. It seemed like a bloody fantastic tale and he was simply dying to know every detail.
“What?”
He tried making his way to his friend, pushing past several people on the sidewalk outside of Bart’s. When they finally parted, he got a full, unobscured view of the dead body in front of him.
Yet now, she found that a large fraction of that awe had evaporated with time and distance. Time that he’d been alive and never bothered to contact her. And distance she happily would’ve crossed to be with him, had he only asked. Looking at him now, she felt only confusion, betrayal, and a twang of bitterness.
Thanks to everyone who's stuck with this story, whether you've been commenting along the way after each update, or you just binged it all in one night - I appreciate you reading this story so much and I hope you all enjoyed the journey as much as I have <33

“I’m fine, John!”
So that was that, then, John thought. There was nothing more to read into anything Sherlock had said.
“Yes.”
“You are going to tell me how you did it, you know,” John said as Sherlock lazily stroked his blonde hair, his chin resting atop his head.
“Oh, John. I gave you one job. Just one tiny request.”
“I’ll be back later.”
“Sherlock, is everything alright?” he tried again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Caught between crippling embarrassment and concern for Sherlock, he stayed against the wall, in the safety and concealment of the dark room. After debating what to do for a minute, he finally swallowed his pride and followed him. Outside, he carefully avoided the smashed fixture on the ground and weaved through the hallways before finding him in the kitchen.
Drug use, murder, and mention of suicide in this chapter
“But why would he need James dead in order to do that?”
John would sometimes not be able to attend cases in their lives before the fall and Mary. When that happened, Sherlock would always text him an almost minute by minute update of what was going on, to the point of being annoying even. And John would always instantly jump in when he was available, already up to speed on everything and eagerly ready to assist in any way possible.
John was lost for words. So this madman of a pirate was not only into science (which he should have guessed after the drug incident,) but he was also a downright bloody idiot. John made eye contact with Molly who was wearing a facial expression that perfectly reflected his thoughts, and the two of them broke out into a shared, understood laughter.
He peeked his head inside. Sherlock was facing the window in his blue dressing gown, the violin perched on his shoulder. His dark, ravenous curls were wild and tousled, as if he had been pulling at them in frustration. He stood with his back to John, looking out into the darkness of the night outside. The yellow light from the lamp cast a soft, warm aura around him. He seemed to almost glow in it.
She raised the gun to strike again. Sherlock winced and turned away, bracing himself for another blow.
“Do you know where she went?”
He rubbed the back of his head. “Did you really never see
“No, no. It’s just… disappointingly simple, if you don’t mind me saying. I mean, you don’t get to fake your own death every day. I would’ve thrown in, I don’t know, a hypnotist, a team of confidants, a fake corpse, some dramatic music… you know.”
“What happened?”
John panted with need, squirming as Sherlock wriggled a fingertip into his arse. He groaned and reached back, fumbling into his drawers for lube.
John’s eyes grew wide. Sherlock Holmes? THE Sherlock Holmes? The infamous pirate he had heard endless tales about? No. Way.
What, did he think he was too weak and fragile to attend cases now? Did he think he was too out of practice and would not be able to keep up? Did he think he was so unable to take care of himself that he needed breakfast prepared and served to him on a platter?
“Molly!” he called. “I need those feet! It’s urgent.” He clasped his hands behind his back and looked around the empty lab. “Molly?”
work for you.” Molly hugged his arm tighter and Greg gripped his shoulder in affirmation, a silent gesture that they were there with him till the end.
*****
“Lower me down there. I have to get him,” he said, already wrapping the rope around his middle.
“Hm? Oh, yes,” Sherlock replied, clearly being pulled out of deep thought. “I was just revisiting some old cases.”
Where the hell was Sherlock?!
John bolted upright in his bed, the hazy outlines of his nightmare still lingering in his vision. His entire torso was coated in sweat, yet he was shivering. His chest was heaving, yet he was gasping, desperately short of breath. “Just a dream,” he whispered to himself. “Just a dream.”
“Oof!” he yelled as he fell beside Sherlock on the floor. Sherlock scrambled to his knees, tugging at John’s arm again.
“But now you know,” Sherlock said.
He flipped through the channels, but nothing captured his interest. His restless sleep from last night began to catch up to him. His eyelids grew heavier as he began to nod off listening to the news reporter on the screen. Within ten minutes, he had drifted into a dreamless sleep . . .
The boy seemed even further impressed. They sang the entire next part strutting in circles around each other. The crowd was loving it.
“Think of it this way. I’m a key player here. You’re a tag along. And I don’t think Evans would appreciate the fact that you’ve been spying on and harassing his most important connection.”
She sucked in a deep, wobbly breath, and looked away to privately dab at her eyes.
He walked up and down the area until he found a small opening through a side door leading into the same area. He knew he had no business there but curiosity got the better of him. Especially when he heard Sherlock's voice, easily distinguishable among the other muffled sounds.
No. Not Sherlock. Because John was here by himself. And he and Sherlock were –
Sherlock began turning towards his gun which was just slightly out of reach. “John,” he croaked, sounding like a garbled mess. But John hushed him and kept his head still with his hand. He didn’t want him moving much until he got that blow checked out.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock” John whispered through his hands. He peeked one eye open and saw he was confused.
He jogged to keep up with Sherlock who was bustling around giving orders and only half paying attention to him.
John didn’t know what would be worse. Sherlock remembering their kiss, or not remembering it.
Sherlock smirked and accepted his challenge.
“Er, yeah,” John croaked back, his eyes back on Sherlock’s lips hovering over his. He cleared his throat. “Coming.”
“Hey there,” John said with a with a weak smile when he could look Sherlock in the eye again.
Josephine thanked them with tearful hugs. If no prosecution came out of this, at least she had closure and could live the remainder of her life in peace. With that, they cordially parted ways.
“No you fucking don’t,” he growled again. He wrapped his arms securely around his waist and pulled them both through just before the gate closed with a final bang.
“John, let me remind you of who I am.  I am an intelligence agent and an experienced assassin.  If you think you can get away with spitting in my face like this, then frankly, you’re an idiot. I can make you suffer. I have killed and will kill again. And John,” She paused, her voice lower and crueler than he’d heard her speak before. “You do not want to be on my bad side.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“First thing we’re doing when we get home is getting you in a hot bath.”
“Take yours upstairs,” came a familiar voice beside him, making him jump.
“Oh John, congratulations!” Mrs. Hudson said, giving him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. “Doctor Watson does have a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?”
The water was up to John’ s neck. He raised his chin up in attempt to keep his mouth and nose above the surface for as long as possible.
All comments and kudos are greatly, greatly appreciated!
They kissed breathlessly for what seemed like an eternity. Their shared breaths mingled hotly between their lips. They pulled soft, needy sounds out of each other that resonated into their otherwise silent living room.
“John,” he repeated in whispers. “John.”
Ray supported a stumbling Sherlock by the small of his back and led him towards the exit.
John felt frozen in his seat. He thought about how his dream was once to work at that hospital, to wear the white coat and the stethoscope and be a hero to all those he could help. But he clamped his mouth shut and shook his head.
Their knees knocked contentedly under the table, and neither made any attempt to move them. Sherlock’s fingers drummed lightly. But not impatiently, like they usually did. More like there was a tune in his head, as he was tapping it out absent-mindedly.
This time it was John who cradled Sherlock’s head to his body and rested his head atop the damp curls. And Sherlock who privately whispered the no longer forbidden words into his skin:
, John!”
“But Christine lived to adulthood and had Josephine. It was Gina’s second child that mysteriously went missing.”
“I am so proud of you,” Sherlock said when he finally pulled away.
“Are you referring to our newly advanced relationship, or Mrs. Hudson walking in on you sporting a boner in the kitchen?”
He and Greg both realized that they were making no attempt to slow down or stop where Greg and Molly were. Their gaze was fixed past them, directly on John. He realized they didn’t care about Greg or Molly. They only wanted him. Greg realized this too. “Go. GO!”
“The killer was male. 6ft and 180 pounds judging by the footprints. Worked as a – oof!”  Sherlock scowled in annoyance and dusted off the remains of the snowball that had just hit the back of his head. After an extended deep breath, he continued. Probably just Anderson being an idiot.
“You’re just upset that I’m finally getting everything you wanted. Just because you failed doesn’t mean I’m going to. I won’t. And you get to see it all happen, front and center. Because I now know exactly where Moriarty is and we’re heading there right now. On we sail, boys!”
"You've grown rather attached to him, eh?” Victor asked tauntingly.
Sherlock flinched back slightly at this. “John?” he asked again, more cautiously this time. “What’s wrong?”
“Fine.”
At the same time, they leaned in, their lips barely grazing. Sherlock gasped at the contact. After a moment of adjustment, their lips slowly closed around each other.
“John!” Sherlock barked over the commotion. “Keep your mouth covered and stay down.”
He was dressed in a black tuxedo, dress shirt, tie, and pants. His hair was gelled up even more than usual. Each shiny, ravenous curl was deliberately placed for maximum, lush volume with one curl falling perfectly onto his forehead. His head-to-toe black outfit contrasted beautifully with his pale as moonlight skin and further accentuated those damned sharp cheekbones.
“No. Never again.”
“Oh, please,” she said. “I’d have to be blind to not notice how many times you looked over at him.” At the panic in his eyes, she switched tones to reassure him. “Oh, don’t worry. Takes one green-eyed monster to know another.”
“It’s not going to get rid of itself, now is it,” Sherlock mumbled teasingly, glancing down between them.
“He’s going to be okay. He just needs to rest.”
John plopped into his chair, stretching his feet out. Sherlock joined him on the opposite chair.
“How’s Mummy?”
“His feet. They’re chained up. Lowering a rope will do nothing.”
Jackson stared at him obliviously. Handling firearms was Molly’s job.
Sherlock practically tore him away just as the chandelier crashed onto the spot he was just standing. They guarded their faces as broken glass flew in all directions.
“So, you want to um . . . I don’t know. Maybe we could –,”
Sherlock kissed him all over his belly, caressing the soft plushness he had acquired with age. His fingertips stroked and grazed every bit of skin they could reach. He sucked the side of his waist, leaving several marks and wet stripes. After pressing slow kisses around his navel, he delivered a hard one directly over it, flicking his tongue inside.
Sherlock had left him breakfast? What was-
“You… you mean…”
“Not Irene?”
“Alright?” he asked between kisses. Sherlock managed a shaky nod in return.
Sherlock nodded curtly at his refusal. Without another word, he wrapped his scarf around his neck and left with his head down.
“I heard all about it, John. You don’t want a future with me. Fine. I guessed from the moment I met you that you were using me for a place to stay. I thought I’d been proven wrong over time, but I guess my first instinct was correct. But if you’re looking for a future with someone else, do us both a favor and stop wasting my time, because frankly, I don’t know what you’re still doing here.”
“If she made a deal and paid the agreed upon price, why would it still be haunting the Walter’s family?”
“Where’s your flashlight?”
“John!”
Thanks to everyone who answered my question in the comments last time! I really appreciated all that feedback and input <3
"Don't be absurd!"
“No,” he moaned, tossing his head from side to side on his pillow.
The beginning of ‘Lucky’ by Jason Mraz played into their living room. He made his way back to Sherlock, his heart filling with warmth at his shyness, and stuck his hand out in offering.
He managed to slit his eyes open once again. His vision was blurry, but came into focus for a moment. Sherlock still held him in his shaking hands, tears streaking down his face. His bottom lip trembled as he struggled to form words.
“Okay, we’ll take it,” Sherlock said with finality. John was shocked, unsure of what detail could have changed his mind so quickly.
John was alright. He knew he was. It probably looked a lot worse than it actually was.
Could he go back to Baker Street now even if he wanted too? Would Sherlock have him back?  Was he angry with him for not reaching out for so long? Did he miss him too? Did he also stay up at night thinking of that day in the taxi, that night in the alley, that afternoon in the kitchen?
“Let there be no doubt about that, John. I will kill him . . . I will burn the heart out of you . . .”
He spotted a broom in the corner and made his way towards it. "This broom is not usually out like this. It's been recently used." He looked in the trash can. "Broken glass and lots of wet napkins.” After breathing in a huge whiff of the garbage, he continued, “A glass of milk must have spilt and you stayed to help her clean it up." He opened the cabinet which contained Mrs. Hudson's glasses and found an envelope. He snatched it up and tore it open, clearly pleased with himself.
“What’s in the bag?” he asked, wanting to break the miserable silence.
Squaring his shoulders, he turned around, facing Jackson and Bolt head on as they cornered him, red-faced and panting. He tried to think of a sarcastic one-liner, but didn’t have time before they lunged forward, each taking one of his arms and holding him back. He grunted and struggled, but even with all of his combat training, the fact remained that they were both bigger and stronger than him, and he was pinned helpless.
(See the end of the chapter for
They looked at each other for a moment, dead serious. And then the corner of Sherlock’s lip twitched up, and they both burst into a fit of childish giggles. Once they started, they couldn’t stop. John clutched at his heaving stomach as tears formed in the corners of his eyes. Sherlock put the back of his hand to his mouth trying to contain his laughter.
She broke into his office, but horribly misjudged the timing. Sherlock showed up and offered to help her. She nearly laughed. Did he even know much shit she’d pulled herself through all these years? What did he think he could offer her that she couldn’t do for herself?
Thanks to everyone who's stuck with this story for this long! I appreciate ya'll <3

John choked out a wet laugh. “So, you’re not . . . disappointed in me?”
“Don’t worry,” he said. He had a surprisingly pleasant voice. Utterly charming. This did nothing to help the butterflies swarming in his stomach. “It’ll be over soon.”
Lestrade set them off sailing out into the open sea. John helped Sherlock wash up and change out of his wet clothes before standing with him at the edge of the ship. He stood in front of him leaning back into his chest, the pirate’s long arms tight around his body.
“Ooh, you bastard,” Lestrade said, all too thrilled to see the man. But John remained motionless. Their gazes remained locked on each other as Sherlock cautiously approached him.
“I’m so sorry,” he repeated.
John and Sherlock simultaneously released the breaths they were holding and stepped apart.
“Get BACK HERE!”
“Hey, come on. Let’s go back to bed,” John said.
Sherlock first suggested calling Lestrade to handle the burnt down building, but John gently told him he probably wouldn’t appreciate receiving that phone call: “Oh hey Gavin, hope you’re well. By the way, we’ve just burned down a mansion about four hours from London. Could you take care of that for us? Thanks.”
, John thought in his half-asleep state.
Mary glared down at them. Her cold, distant mask had shredded. In its place was a horrid scowl, a furious red-hot glare. She shook her head at John’s stupidity and pulled a spare gun out of her coat.
Sorry this update took a teeny bit longer than usual! Hope you enjoyed nonetheless - Please leave a comment if you can! Feedback really helps me to keep going :)
“Yeah, it does surprise me, actually. Sorry if I find the thought of The Great Sherlock Holmes playing hide and go seek with a three-year-old a bit more amusing than you.”
. He was just about to tell him so when Victor’s hand dropped lower and gripped his throat, cutting off his airways harshly.
“What?” Sherlock asked with wounded eyes as he flinched back.
This intrigued John. What were they talking about that needed to be so secret, and away from everyone else? And why did it bother Victor so much when John just barely noticed them? He tried to keep to his work the rest of the day, ignoring the three of them. Regardless of his efforts, he couldn't help but notice how strange they were acting, even hours later. He told himself to stop being paranoid and drop it. With this, he tuned back into Molly, who was still talking to him.
He sighed deeply rubbing his temples. If intimidation didn’t work on this one, which he should have been able to tell by how he responded to Jackson, he will have to try a different approach. As frustrating as it was, he saw this new prisoner as a challenge. And he looked forward to beating it. As he was about to open the door and turn in for the night, he heard familiar footsteps approach him from behind. He looked behind him down at the all too familiar brown-haired, stocky man.
John launched his tale, starting with Mary’s phone call on his first morning back in 221B. How she threatened to kill Sherlock if he ever got too close to him. How John tried so hard to distance himself to keep him safe. How it only made them both miserable, but he had no choice. How he couldn’t risk Mary finding out if he ever got help. How torturous it was to refuse Sherlock on so many occasions. How lonely he was all this time. How lost, and confused, and unhappy he was without him.
Molly led him to the front door of Sherlock’s room before smiling at him and leaving. As he raised his hand to knock, he heard a familiar baritone voice say, “Come in, John.”
“Oh, nothing. It can wait until you get home.”
"Because you're very obviously
Sherlock sighed into his pillow as John took his time sucking a mark into the tiny dip of his back, making him squirm.
A good song to go with the scene of Sherlock getting high is "Monster" by Imagine Dragons :)
*****
“No,” Victor shot, drained of all his previous confidence. “You lot had your chance.”
Jackson and Bolt pushed John, Greg, and Molly against a mast. Victor hauled Sherlock up and had him join them and tied a thick, sturdy rope around all four of them together.
“No, thank you.” She wiped her hands over her eyes again. “Thanks for . . . what you did. Earlier.”
It started off as a simple gesture in the backseat of a cab.
“Why did you lead me here?” John asked to draw her attention away from Sherlock.
He released a single soft sob as quietly as he could, even though he knew his friend standing at his bedside could full well hear him.
Tony turned to John. “He told you about the meeting, right?” he asked, almost in annoyance.
"I know what this is about. It's that new cabin boy isn't it?" The other men murmured in agreement.  He assumed it was Jackson and Bolt.
The corner of Sherlock’s lip twitched up in bewilderment. “John,” he started, with an amused twinkle in his eye. “I was relieved. Not disappointed.” He gripped John’s wrists over his shirt and stroked once over the skin. “Never disappointed.”
“Who the hell called you?” he snapped at Lestrade.
He could tell.
Looking down, he realized both he and Sherlock were lightly tapping their feet and watching the dance floor, a heavy silence present between them. He noticed Sherlock’s head was even nodding slightly along to the music.
But after another minute of listening to him babble about facts and logic, he had to speak up.
“Happy birthday, love.”
“John!” Sherlock’s voice called.
*****
However, it was the first time since the party last week that they would be spending this much time together, so it never hurt to prepare.
The cab arrived for them about twenty minutes later, since they were so far out from the city.
“So you like it then?”
“Aye, Captain,” he replied quietly, much less confident than he was a moment ago.
“Yes, yes, I have it,” Molly said. “Can you not talk so loud please?” She took out a bag with four preserved human feet. Left ones, as Sherlock had requested.
John tilted his head at him, confused.
“We’re on a case, John.”
“Well, invite them along. I’m sure they could all use a break. Give Greg a call, too.”
“So, er, any news on the case?” John asked as casually as he could the next morning. Sherlock was bustling around the kitchen while he was drinking his morning tea in the doorway.
Sherlock who would always be there for him.
“Fine. Be a party pooper. I’ll be back later.”
Sherlock was already gone when John came downstairs the next morning. Most likely on a case, he figured.

“He does practically run the British government. I suppose I could have him pull a few strings…”
Thank you guys for your comments so far! I really appreciate all of them!<333
They were both right on the edge. Sherlock lifted up and looked down into his eyes.
He pulled up a record of Gina Walters. “Her maiden name, John.”
Soothing, classic 80’s music was playing. Men and women were swaying hand in hand in perfect synchronization. Colorful dresses twirled around numerous pairs of legs.
At the sound of his near-panic attack, Mary chuckled. Blind rage boiled in his stomach as his wife made light of almost killing the man he loved. “So…” She continued. “Last chance, John.  You can come back to me or face what’s yet to come.”
There was a heated silence as they all waited for his reply. After several moments, he very quietly said, "No."
John gave a small courtesy laugh. “We’ll see."
John didn’t fail to notice the hostility, coldness, and distance in his voice.
Sherlock had said.
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
He halted. “Where am I-? Where the hell do you
He watched the two converse quietly, too far for him to hear. The man struggled to explain what had just happened before Sherlock cut him off with simply a raised hand. He then turned his icy gaze to John, who got the message quickly and picked his mop back up.
There was the first selfie Sherlock took (after John had showed him how), with a body at a crime scene.  Then the two of them celebrating Sherlock’s birthday at Angelo’s. Angelo stood behind them with one hand squeezing either of their shoulders. John was smiling like a normal human being and Sherlock sat with an almost intentional look of indifference. Behind that was a picture John had secretly snapped when Sherlock was laying on the sofa lost in his mind palace. He had looked so ethereal all stretched out in his posh, tailored suit, his pale hands steepled under his pointed chin. He couldn’t resist.
The two of them had been living together at Baker Street for one month now. And although they’d settled in fairly quickly, neither were used to the safety and security their new lives provided them. Sherlock worried when John didn’t arrive home when expected. John worried when Sherlock didn’t answer his calls. And so on. It was natural, given the chaotic and dangerous lives they were used to living. It would take more than a month to let go of the effects those experiences had on them, but they were making progress.
“I’m always afraid,” Sherlock whispered, almost to himself.
John!” He was raising his voice now. John stood to match him eye for eye – well, as much as he could.
“So this means… will you… stay? Here? With me?”
John let his eyes travel back up to his chest, remembering his cuts.
Eventually, in the distance, he saw a pale hand peek out of the water before disappearing again. John trudged through the water, the current both helping and hindering him in turns.  Eventually he reached the spot where he saw the hand and plunged underwater. He didn’t have to look too long before a pair of long, skinny arms wrapped tightly around his waist. He kicked back up to the surface, and sure enough, Sherlock popped up with him, gasping and clinging to him for dear life. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist supporting him with his hip.
Mycroft, meanwhile, refused to visit Baker Street without calling in advance several times. Especially after walking in on them one afternoon, John in his chair, Sherlock in his lap, naked from the waist down.
Just as before, John’s outfit was laid out on his bed by Sherlock and ready for him when he got home from work.
"Detective Sherlock Holmes' coat and scarf have been stolen! But luckily, the culprit left behind some clues." Sherlock looked to John’s coat pockets again before digging in and pulling out one of John's gloves.
Sherlock caged him in against the counter. Their chests were pressed together, their noses and foreheads touching. Neither looked the other in the eye, but rather gazed down at each other’s lips. Neither dared to break the delicate silence by speaking. They simply stood there like that…. Breathing…. Waiting…
Through Mycroft’s research, Sherlock learned what Evans had been using to blackmail her for all those years. Erotic photographs. Hundreds of them. Irene had managed to wipe the internet clean of them herself, but Evans had somehow gotten his hands on some digital copies and had threatened to leak them online unless she worked for him. Mycroft destroyed these copies as well as her criminal record, so she could rebuild her life in London.
“Where are you going?”
They’d never been to Angelo’s in the daytime before. The restaurant was brightly lit with afternoon daylight instead of dim street lights and candles.
Anxiety raised in John’s chest at her threat. At least previously she had tried to keep her malicious intentions subtle. Her sudden switch to being so direct and vicious towards him sent an ominous shiver down his neck.
Harry pulled back from the hug with a massive smile on her face. A look of understanding passed between them. John was delighted to have her back in his life, and she felt the same. She had flown out there to attend his graduation. And in a few months, he had a flight booked to spend her birthday weekend with her. Every time he saw her, he was thankful for that evening he decided to call Mycroft back.
As the door closed behind her, silence once again settled over the flat. Ever so slowly, John turned his head back towards Sherlock’s. The moment their eyes met, they burst into shared laughter and looked away again.
“Yeah. Thank you."
“I love you.”
John sighed and leaned against the circular bar counter, watching from afar. He couldn’t deny that a part of him was hoping Sherlock had run off the floor in a fit of jealousy. And that when John found him hiding off somewhere alone and upset, they would have some deep, heartfelt talk like something from a rom com.
John's kiss had been chaste and subtle. This was passionate. Everything they had been holding back these past several weeks, every pining glance, every unspoken word, exploded into this moment. They gripped each other's heads as if their lives depended on it and kissed fiercely for what felt like an eternity.
“If you hadn’t called me the day after I moved in threatening to kill Sherlock if we ever got together, none of that would have happened.” Sherlock’s head turned towards him in surprise, his eyes wide and wounded.
The entire next day, John could barely focus on his work. The only thing on his mind was looking forward to meeting Sherlock in his room in the evening. So when night fell and everyone retired to their cabins or a recreational area, John weaseled out of a chat with Molly and snuck over to the captain’s quarters.
So John settled for scooting them both back to the headboard of the bed and pulling Sherlock into his chest, burying his face in the curls on top of his head. He stroked his arms and whispered soft, comforting words into his ear. When the taller man had fallen asleep, John laid him down, pulled the blankets up to his neck, and retired to his own cabin.
He grabbed his jacket off the back of his chair and nearly bolted towards the exit.
“A trusted coworker of mine, Ryan. He’s very good, I promise. He said everything seemed to check out fine.”
The last thing he heard before slipping into unconsciousness was a bullet clicking into its chamber.
The corner of John’s mouth lifted slightly as he shook his head furiously. “Just when I thought you were more than just a cold hearted, inhuman machine of a pirate.”
“Stop.
“Hey, you two,” he said, addressing him more than the blonde boy. “Don’t be nervous. Just go for it. Have fun!” He gave the two of them a once-over and chuckled. “Besides, you might thank me for this one day.”
But when he opened his mouth, he was soft and vulnerable again. "John," he breathed almost silently gazing down at him almost desperately. John remained cupping Sherlock's face tenderly before the world around them came crashing back into reality.
But if she left, what would happen to Sherlock and John? Well, Sherlock she could care less about. He’s had this coming to him since before she was in the picture. But John.
Sherlock hushed him and pulled him in closer to his own jumper. Huddled in a cocoon of arms and dwindling body heat, they fell asleep and remained so until the cab screeched to a halt in front of 221B Baker Street.
They had expected the killer had continued to run, but instead, he was lurking in the dark waiting for him. He shoved John up against the wall. Before he could fight back, he grabbed a fistful of his hair and smashed it into the brick.
“Sherlock, you bloody humiliated him.”
His wedding day. When he spontaneously hugged him. Desperate for some physical contact after that declaration of love. Desperate to touch him, to breathe him in, to declare it back to the world.
“Sherlock . . .” he moaned louder as he struggled beyond his abilities to stay awake.
Their mutual silence saturated the room. John took the opportunity to observe Sherlock’s face. His eyebrows were furrowed in confusion, his eyes intense and focused on him. Neither spoke. It seemed Sherlock’s brain was on overdrive trying to comprehend what had just happened, so John broke the silence first.
John smiled devilishly and climbed back up his body on all fours, more than happy to comply. He dipped down and captured his waiting lips in a soft, caressing kiss. As he lapped into his mouth, he wormed his hand down between his legs.
Why not kill two birds with one stone while she was here? She’d be gone before John ever found out, and her secret would remain safe. Sherlock would be dead, and she could go back to being Mary Morstan.
He gripped his knees and breathed in heavily through his nose. Closing his eyes and exhaling through his mouth, he tried to calm himself down.
“Take in your daughter. Make her our own. Raise her with you. If that’s what you wanted. If that’s what would have made you happy, I would have done it without a moment’s hesitation.”
pirates.”
“No, it’s not. But if we’re doing confessions, I’ve got one for you.”
Sherlock looked around, exaggerating his motions with big, bugging eyes. “Okay. Got a feel for it. I’ll go upstairs and you take the cellar. Not afraid of the basement are you?” he said with a smirk before walking away.
It was 8:30. And right below the time was a notification with a text from Sherlock.
“But for now I’ll just take care of the second Holmes brother. I at least hope he’ll be more of a challenge than his old haggard of a mother and cowardly drunkard of a father.”
“Why the hell would you not tell me your plan, Sherlock?”
Was that a note of threat he detected in her voice? It didn’t matter. He would take however long he bloody wanted. He dialed Sherlock’s number and rushed out of the flat, hailing a cab.
“Right, uh, yes. Um, Jackson! Load the cannons!”
“You heard him, Johnny-boy. Let the big boys play.”
“Three years, John."
“Okay, obviously not. But better safe than sorry until we get a better feel for the place, yeah?”
The chandelier began to tauntingly swing back and forth.
Sherlock looked taken aback. “And why on earth would I be disappointed?” he asked, sounding almost angry at the ludicrous suggestion.
John shook the man once in his arms, knowing he couldn’t do much else to hurt him without getting everyone shot.
Sherlock leaned back on the refreshments table and nibbled on a piece of fruit. Up ahead, Greg chatted with his parents. Molly was with her bridesmaids. There was really no one else he knew. He felt that familiar ache in his stomach that usually appeared during social situations like this. Where everyone around him seemed to be with someone while he felt like he was enclosed in a glass box, invisible to everyone outside it. He wrapped his free arm around his middle, closing in on himself, and took another bite of his fruit. It was then that he caught a voice that instantly melted his worries.
"Yes." John could tell from Sherlock's tone and demeanor that he was not willing to talk further, so he dropped it.
“Oi, shut it! You would’ve died if I didn’t!”
He blinked a few times, but his vision remained hazy. Still, he was able to make out that he was in a hospital room. The look and smell was all too familiar to him.  His mind whirred trying to remember what had happened.
“John. I think we need to investigate the cellar again. Tonight.”
The door opened and Victor came back in with a glass of water. Evans took it and gently tipped a bit into Sherlock’s mouth. Despite himself, he couldn’t help but eagerly swallow every drop that was offered to him.
“Text from Lestrade. Gotta run.” He hitched his coat on and waited by the door, watching John. Both knew he didn’t have work that day and could easily come along.
“Phil, meet Sean and Victor,” Tony said once they broke apart, vaguely gesturing to the other two men. Sean and Victor approached, and immediately, John’s body tensed. He felt like the closer they got, the more they’d be able to see what a phony he was.
Remember when I promised that everything would be resolved? I need ya'll to remember that and hold onto it! :*
“But you said
Sherlock smirked at him like he was a child asking to hold his mommy’s hand. “What’s the matter, John? Afraid a ghost is going to jump out and get you?” He reached out and grabbed his arms in imitation. John pulled out of his grip.
Sherlock agreed, and was much happier to dump the problem in Mycroft’s lap. Now, as far as the government was concerned, the Walter’s mansion never existed.
But there was something that happened . . . something that stuck out in his fuzzy, hungover memory.
“There are no such things as
The blonde man hauled him to his feet by his armpits saying, “Up you go.” John was not self-conscious of his small size, but he did not appreciate others using it as an invitation to talk to him like a child. As the blonde man began to search him, he stuttered, “Yeah, just a minute… I should probably tell you…” He pulled John’s gun out of his back pocket and looked at him accusingly.
John chuckled at his partner’s deduction. They had been dating for five months now, and he still never failed to be impressed by him, even with the simplest displays of his genius. “Don’t even know why you’d want to wear that thing out anyway.”
“But don’t worry. I won’t kill you just yet.” With that, he pulled his arm back and thrust a punch deep into John’s gut, knocking the breath clean out of him. Before he could regain his breath, another punch landed in the same spot. And then a third one on his jaw, causing a sickening crack.
“It’s . . . it’s 5 o’clock.” Sherlock shifted on his knees in front of him looking embarrassed.
Sherlock was positively fuming now. His teeth were gritted and his chest heaved with rageful breaths.
He didn't get much further before Sherlock lunged forward, grabbed John's face and pressed their mouths back together. Sherlock's warm lips completely enveloped his as the kiss deepened. John's entire body froze from shock. He stood still as one of Sherlock's hands ran tenderly through his short, blonde hair and the other wrapped around his waist pulling his body in completely against his. John finally melted into the embrace, reaching his arms up and weaving them into Sherlock's curls.
“Hey, don’t worry about it.” When Sherlock didn’t meet his gaze, he got up and went to the cell door, as close as he could to him. “Sherlock. It’s fine. I don’t even remember a thing,” he chucked uneasily. Sherlock looked up, let out a relieved breath he had been holding, and smiled. A true, genuine smile that John had never seen before. And it was beautiful.
Sherlock knew of his reputation. All the girls went crazy over him. Not that he could blame them, he thought, now that he was getting his first good view of him. With those muscled arms, that golden-blonde hair, those sparkling blue eyes. . . oh shit they were looking right at him.
He peered down at her knowingly. “Isn’t that what you wanted? Why else would you have kept your guns and disguises if you really believed I was dead? Whether you realized it or not, you’ve been ready to up and run away from your life since you got married. You’ve never been truly happy here.”
“John.”
“Look, Sherlock, about last -”
John stood in front of him. He looked completely and utterly lost. Normally when Sherlock couldn’t explain something, he grew frustrated. He would stay up all night, screeching away at his violin, and being an utter pain until he figured it out. It was a game to him, and he didn’t like losing.
“John, don’t you see? None of them have seen Phil in person. Someone is picking him up right here in five minutes to take him somewhere and give him extremely confidential information.”
Forcing his eyes further open, he blinked several times to focus his vision. He was in the brig. He recognized it from his first few days here as prisoner. He attempted to sit up, but every muscle in his body tightened in protest. As he let out a groan of pain, a hand gently coaxed him to lay back down. It was then that he realized he had been laying with his head in Sherlock’s lap for who knows how long.
Yes, definitely home.
“It seems there’s been a slight mix up in the reservations for this evening. We have double booked your table by mistake. Any other day, I would give you two the best seats in the house, free meals, all of it. But you see, my niece is bringing her fiancé here for their anniversary. She’d never forgive me.” He looked at John an extra moment, begging for forgiveness with his eyes.
“Sherlock,” he said as soon as the ringing has stopped. “It’s gone. The AGRA drive is gone.”
“I’m hungry.”
Sherlock stepped in to hold him, swaying them side to side. Their hands met again and they stepped apart, their arms outstretched between them.
This was strange. They never talked about their feelings like this. And most certainly not at 3 am like teenagers at a sleepover.
“Shut up, Sherlock.”
“Sorry?”
disappointed with John (but let's be real. We all thought 'Cheating' on the soundtrack meant either this or a reveal that the baby wasn't John's). Regardless, I'd love to hear all your thoughts! Until next time ;)
“Because you mess with me, you mess directly with Sherlock Holmes. And more importantly, you try to mess around with Sherlock Holmes, you mess with me.”
“I’m John,” he said sticking, his hand out.
“I’m. . . I’m afraid, John,” he confessed into the quiet space just between them.
Jim threw his head back and laughed, startling her. “I made you into Mary Morstan. Don’t tell me you actually thought you could become her. I once was your life. And I still am and always will be.” He took her hands in his, dipping his head slightly to look into her eyes. “Remember what we once had, Annie?”
“Well you picked my bloody outfit.”
Then, in an instant, they drew together like magnets, pressed against each other in a desperate, earnest kiss. John brought his hands up and tugged at Sherlock’s curls, deepening the kiss, needing more reassurance that he was really there, alive and breathing- needing to feel him, to taste him, to breathe him in.
He flew out of 221B, intending to find some darkened, isolated place where he could release his emotions and not return home until Sherlock would for sure be asleep.
“Deal with m-?”
Before he could communicate anything to him, John rushed forward and easily tackled Ray to to the ground, aiming his gun at him.
Allowing Sherlock to spend the night with him? In his bed? He rolled onto his back and cast the crook of his elbow over his face. He had even woken up in the middle of the night. Why hadn’t he told Sherlock to leave?
John missed it terribly. And he missed Sherlock. He missed their easy intimacy, the long nights they spent out working on cases, the precious moments they would catch between work to just be together.
“So you, handsome,” Julia drawled, turning Sherlock’s face towards hers with a long, slender finger. “I want to know why you’re here alone. There’s no way a gorgeous face like yours could be single.”
Moriarty looked back to John and smiled. “And now, Sherlock gets to watch all of his friends die before I kill him.” He paused. “Unless…”
Also feel free to come say hi to me on tumblr @one-thousand-splendid-stars!
“Come back to London with me. We could find a flat share and live together. Molly and Greg too. We could start a new life.”
John looked further down and away. He hated this. He hated himself for being such a burden and couldn’t stand for Sherlock to see the self-loathing on his face.
John’s head dropped onto his shoulder as they swayed to his music. Slow and rhythmic. Nothing fancy. Outside, the first flurries of snow began to fall in front of their window. It was a bit early in the year for snow, but the sight was welcome. The yellow streetlights and empty sidewalks made Baker Street appear picturesque and quaint. Quiet and homely.
“We’ll bring you something to eat in a bit,” he offered with a weak, apologetic smile, and left.
“You don’t know him. He’s ruthless.”
“Well, obviously not, John!” Sherlock leapt up and began pacing around John’s chair, thinking out loud. “But this does tell us more about Gina herself. Who she was. What sort of things could have motivated her. Tomorrow we’ll look more into the Walters family history itself.”
What was worse for John was that he knew he could do nothing about it. He, Molly, and Greg were unarmed and outnumbered. Moriarty had demonstrated he had no qualms about killing a man in cold blood. They were utterly helpless.
So when John saw the striped magnifier at some odd booth at a fair, he grabbed it, not even bothering to look at the price. He grinned remembering how Sherlock had lit up like a Christmas tree and starting taking it on every case immediately. John set that one aside. Sherlock would probably want it back.
“Don’t you worry about a thing. I’ll get you out of here. Breathe, John.” With that, he dove underwater, crouching at his feet.
“Mmm hmm…” she said with that look on her face again.
“Your brother. . .” came John’s voice, sounding irritated and bemused at the same time. Sherlock’s smile instantly fell as he turned around. “. . . is the most ridiculous person I’ve ever met,” John finished.
John slowly stood, wary of his wobbling legs. He took one step forward. Two. Three. Never once breaking eye contact. At last they were standing right in front of each other.
“John, STOP IT.” Another to the jaw. Lestrade, Donovan, and Anderson were still giggling, and John had given in to his laughter. Sherlock’s brow furrowed in irritation.
John turned away here. Sherlock was going to see it up close and personal, and he couldn’t watch. He felt him caress it lightly with his fingertips. Again. And again. John expected him to move on soon, but he surprised him by leaning down and pressing a hard, lingering kiss right over the scar. He opened his eyes in surprise and looked down at him.
One hour later, a rough bump in the road jolted him awake. He didn’t even notice when he’d dozed off. But he did notice the weight of another head atop his own, and the slow rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest.
“What do you-”
“No. And I'm guessing Gina also tried to offer up all those other children as a substitute as well. But Moloch wanted Christine and only Christine. Perhaps the hackings in the cellar wall were a brutal reminder of that.”
He had to stay awake for Sherlock . He must protect Sherlock. He couldn’t die. He mustn’t.
“Sherlock Holmes?” Evans asked.
He turned on his side and closed his eyes, trying his hardest to ignore the prickling feeling in his spine that something was watching him. From behind. The same feeling he had gotten in the cellar. He turned on his back and stared at the ceiling so he could keep both sides of the room in his peripheral vision.
“I applaud your diverse vocabulary as always, John. It’s nearly one in the morning and tonight has been eventful enough. So I say we head off to bed. Yes?”
“Uh huh. I never would have thought that he’d be, I don’t know,” he trailed off.
for them to be doing this again.
He sprinted towards the doors leading to the pool feeling horribly empty and vulnerable without his gun in his pocket.
“Don’t bother."
John smiled in encouragement.
“Sherlock?” he asked cautiously, his stomach knotting with anxiety. His eyes seemed to be unfocused and darting around, like they did when he was solving a puzzle.
Stacey, red in the face and still slightly dazed, turned around to follow John’s gaze.

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed! Happy summer to everyone who's on break and good luck to everyone taking final exams at this time<3
“And now you don’t want to go on cases anymore. It’s like you don’t even want to be near me.”
“Let’s go, John,” Sherlock whispered. He nodded solemnly. And this time it was John who led Sherlock out with a solid hand on his back.
His voice was light, but his expression was stern.
As their eyes met, their smiles dropped slowly. The unspoken question was written all over their faces. They both remembered.
"Dammit, Sherlock! We don't care! This is the final straw! You've called off seven ambushed in just the past week alone. With no reason. We’ve all noticed this sudden change in your judgement. We demand to know what the hell has gotten into you." John recognized this as Victor's voice.
“Well, looks like lover boy pulled,” John joked in a low voice. To their left, the man Sherlock had deduced earlier was dancing with the lady in the violet dress.
John dropped the cargo load he was carrying and dashed up to the bow. He saw Sherlock’s mouth desperately form his name as his grip slipped and he was hurdled into the raging water. Seeing as everyone else was busy at their stations, John left it to himself to take action. Greg and Molly took notice as he looped several meters of heavy-duty rope over his shoulder and across his body.
Back in his room, John laid on his bed staring up at the ceiling. He knew Molly would likely be out later than him, so he had plenty of time to think.
He thumped down the stairs and nearly ran into Mrs. Hudson.
John shrugged. “I dunno. Maybe it’s bored?” he joked. “Look, Sherlock. I know if you don’t solve this, it’ll tear you apart not knowing. So let’s tackle this together for one last night, okay? And if we don’t get anywhere, we go home.”
John raised a brow at him, caught off-guard by the sudden inquiry. “Me?”
“You don’t just call someone 59 times and then bloody disappear!”
“Well, it’s just, you know. Usually you answer your calls. If you had ignored a call from me that would have been a bit more understandable.” They looked away from each other when he said this, the painful memories of last night hanging in the air.
This chapter contains murder and attempted sexual assault.
For security’s sake, she understood that everything had to be kept under wraps. The mansion never existed, and they never met. When John and Sherlock broke the news that she shouldn’t have children if she didn’t want to pass on the curse to another generation, they were relieved she conveniently didn’t want any.
Okay, stop, John told himself. Clearly spending too much time with Sherlock clouded his judgement, and distancing himself from him cleared it. He could never allow this to happen again. He could not allow his carelessness to get Sherlock killed. He would simply have to distance himself emotionally and physically from him as much as possible, as difficult as that may be.
And oh,
Sherlock only glanced at him out of the corner of his eyes. John shook his head and turned to face his own window.
“John,” Sherlock said, sounding surprised. The line was quiet for a few seconds. “I’m – I’m glad you called.”
We returned home as a broken family. Just the two of us alone. I closed myself off, refusing to accept any help from anyone except my brother. I wouldn't talk to any of the therapists or government officials that pathetically attempted to ease our pain. Just him. Of course, he was to leave home in a month to begin his new job in the government. Right before he left, he encouraged me to let go and move on, like him. I was appalled at his proposition. A month after our parents' deaths and he was already moving out and starting new life, leaving me completely alone and telling me to move on. I shut him out too as he left. And never quite forgave him. After that I was alone in the house. I had no one."
“You’ve done nothing but make me miserable.” John’s voice dripped with venom as he practically snarled into the phone. “You’re the worst thing that could have ever possibly happened to me.”
The floor beneath them trembled slightly, and another low growl vibrated throughout the house. They stumbled flowered and gripped each other’s forearms for balance.
“And that’s … Lestrade at the wheel. Well, Greg. I mean, yeah. You can just call him Greg I’m sure. I know you’ve met him.”
he thought, and ignored it.
Time stopped for John. The music faded out and he heard nothing but his heart pounding in his ears.
“I didn’t mean to wake you.”
He rose from the chair and picked up Sherlock’s hat from his desk before going back and standing between Sherlock’s knees. He placed the hat on Sherlock’s head and pushed his damp curls off his forehead. “Goodnight, Captain,” he said with a smile, and left.
Sherlock, in the same clothes he had worn at the pool, scooted up to the edge of his seat. One hand was near his lips, as if he had been chewing his fingertips and and then forgot about it. His eyes bore into him, watching him intently. John wouldn’t have been surprised if he hadn’t blinked once for . . . however long he was out.
“NO! Don’t you fucking
Their lips hovered dangerously close, and they were both well aware of it.
“What you called me.”
Some of his anger must have still been lingering on his face because Julia then asked, “Are you alright?”
John timidly raised his fist and lowered it for the fourth time.
"Why should I know?"
She was stunned into silence at John's turning of the tables.
“Moriarty can make Sherlock dance like a puppet, John. You know he can. He can make him do anything he wants just by pulling the right strings. He can make him hurt himself, Mrs. Hudson . . .or even you.”
But then Sherlock Holmes had turned up alive, on the night John was going to propose to her no less, and ruined everything. She heard from Jim what this man could do, and she knew fooling him about who she really was would be no easy task.
“You alright?” he asked again.
“John, you . . .” Sherlock looked taken aback. “You took a bullet for me.”
*****
“I . . . I had everything under control. You shouldn’t have-”
“Actually, um, I better go too.”
Mary hastily pulled open drawer after drawer, rummaging through layers and layers of clothes she never wore.
In a sort of compromise, John bent down and untangled the dog tags from the skull. When they caught onto another bone, he yanked in frustration, but a pair of pale, familiar hands quickly assisted him in freeing them. He put them around his neck and tucked them in his shirt.
were his only thoughts as he snogged her senseless for several long moments.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock paced and tugged at his curls. He passed John and Molly, who were eyeing him curiously, and Lestrade who was doing the same while sneaking side glances at Molly.
he thought with a sinking feeling in his gut. He realized Mr. Daniel Ray was probably what Sherlock had had his gaze fixed upon in the booth the whole time Julia was flirting with him. And he had probably asked them to dance so he could keep a better watch on him, but he got distracted and lost track of him. So he ran off.
Angelo entered the waiting area and they both broke their gazes to look at him. John’s stomach growled expectedly, but he frowned at Angelo’s expression.
But above all else, it was his facial expression that caused panic to rise at an alarming rate in John’s chest. Apart from his dark, dangerous-looking eyes, his entire face was completely relaxed. His stance was tall and looming, but at the same time… relaxed. This was a man that killed and killed again with no second thought. A man that held no regrets of the terrible things he had done. A man with no conscious.
John ran a hand through his sleep-tousled hair contemplating the fact that he had dropped everything and fled a case simply because he hadn’t answered a call.
The prickling feeling of another presence behind him sent sharp tingles of fear down his spine.
“What can I get you boys this afternoon?”
He wondered if Sherlock even remembered everything that had happened last night. He had been way more drunk and was acting perfectly natural at the moment.
“Remember? Remember the time with the cabbie? With the two pills?
“And Sherlock?”
“Alright. Sherlock,” he began as gently and cautiously as possible. “I think it’s time we entertain the possibility of something paranormal being at work here, yes?”
*****
He swallowed tightly. “I didn’t mean what I said last night. I was just angry. I’m sorry.”
He was safe.
John stomped forward. He grabbed the back of Sherlock’s chair and swung it around so he would be forced to face him.
His heart pounded in his chest as endless possibilities flooded his mind. He shouted directions impatiently at the driver and hung up.
“You're the one that I want. You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey.”
“Great. I’ll see you in a bit, love.?
Behind him, the door opened. Without looking, he recognized the sound of John wiping his feet on the mat and hanging his jacket on their coatrack.
“What, I can’t just drop by and say hi to my favorite girl?”
He cleared his throat uncomfortably. “And there’s the room.” He directed his light to the ‘S.’
“No. I didn’t. You have no idea what was going on.”
In the end, Jim let them go.
Sherlock’s head snapped towards him, his expression confused.
“I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove.”
Sherlock’s head snapped towards him as the crowd cheered in encouragement. Particularly the rugby team. He was good! . . . And his big, blue eyes were focused directly on him.
John’s heart dropped into his stomach. Was this not what he thought it was? Did Sherlock just feel ramped up from the danger and adrenaline and need an immediate release? Was he not supposed to bring feelings into this?
“Yep. Born with it. Lips, tongue, and all. Oh, and would you look at that? You’ve got one too! Oh and look, everyone around-,”
"You've had these gloves for about four, no, five years. Been through all types of wear and tear. But you only lost one. So you had to remove them for some reason, and left the other behind. The tips of the thumb, index, and ring finger are dirty." Sherlock sniffed and dabbed his tongue on the material. "Crumbs. Cookie crumbs. And the back of the glove is damp with a single streak of..." Another taste. "Milk. You had cookies and milk. Who would give a grown man cookies and milk?" Realization dawned on him.
“No, John. Um, also… I apologize for my mistreatment of you. And for taking you from your friends. And any inconvenience and hurt I may have caused you.”
Sherlock's mouth. Within moments Sherlock was whimpering and barely holding himself up.
And next year, on the fourth anniversary of Janine’s death, John cleaned the house of all traces of alcohol and was prepared to be there for him in whatever way need be. But all Sherlock needed was a late-night cuddle and a bit of distraction. He had no urges to use and only scratched at his arms once or twice. It was still a dreadful night for him, but it was progress. And any progress was meaningful, no matter how small.
“Shut your mouth, you prat,” John growled, pulling Sherlock’s hair to the side and scraping his teeth along his jaw.
“So you’re saying you both faked your deaths the same way? Stealing corpses?”
“Good morning, John. Sleep well?”
“Well, he told me you pushed him out of the way so you could take the bullet. He fell in the direction of your gun lying on the ground. He said he grabbed for it, and then crawled back to you hoping to god you were alright. He saw that you had been shot, and sort of lost all control at that point. He and Mary both reloaded their guns. You passed out, and he shot her first. That’s it, I think.”
At the god awful sound of the hinges, his anxiety came creeping back into the pit of his stomach. The sound of the door slamming behind him, the prickles down his spine, the cold breath . . .
“Remember the first time we came here? The day we met, I believe?”
“Oh, for god’s sake.”
The gate was beginning to close.
With the other gun still out of reach, John shoved Sherlock out of his arms as hard and far as he could.
“What do you mean that’s all you have?” Sherlock asked. “Tell me you aren’t serious.”
“What?” he asked, taken aback. He felt his heart break all over again, until Sherlock spun around to face him. He was white as a sheet.
John looked him over curiously. Even with those puppy eyes, that confused brow, and that raised chin, he somehow still managed to look like a stuck up prat. His head spun as a rush of affection for this adorably clueless man washed over him.
“John. Look at me,” Sherlock said quietly after a while. It was barely above a murmur. Just meant for the two of them to hear even though Lestrade and his officers were standing nowhere near.
he told himself.
Their teeth and tongues clashed as they kissed and panted into each other’s mouths, riding through their orgasms together. Finally, Sherlock collapsed on top of him, earning him a hiss of pain.
“Victor,” Sherlock growled low and dangerously. “For just one moment, put your overinflated ego aside and realize that you stand no chance without Molly’s help. And the rest of us for that matter. Release us now.”
He opened his closet door and shoves his clothes to the side, clearing a space in the far back corner. Reaching down, he removed the three spare comforters covering the box he was trying to reach, and pulled it out into the room.
THIS IS NOT THE END!!!!
“Alright,” he said reluctantly. One more drink couldn’t hurt. Besides the next round of random karaoke was about to start, and it was always amusing to watch a pair of idiots get up on stage and embarrass themselves. He relaxed against the bar counter and took in the scene around him.
Sherlock, still buried in his microscope, was now turned completely away from John so he couldn’t see him at all. More frustrated than before, John clenched his teeth. Here he was trying to get somewhere with Sherlock. Trying to rebuild their relationship after the whole incident with Mary. And the stubborn man was simply ignoring him.
Just one chapter left guys! yay!
“The ceremony, the picket fence,” Sherlock spat, uncurling himself and sitting up properly. “That’s what will make you happy, yes? If you don’t want it with me, then I do hope you’ll find it with someone else. In fact, I wish you the best in your efforts to find it.”
He raised his fist, knocked, and waited. No reply. He knocked again. Nothing. He put his ear to the door, but couldn't hear the normal noises of Sherlock bustling around his room. Pushing the door slightly open, he peered inside. When he still didn't get a response, he pushed it open all the way. Sherlock was gone.
Sherlock’s skin tingled in the spot where Evans’ thumb gently circled. The sweet release of the needle was the most alluring thing that could’ve been offered to him. All his pain would go away. He wouldn’t think of John, he wouldn’t feel the blood drying on his clothes, caking on his skin, he wouldn’t feel so cold, so sore, so alone.

John could feel him relaxing his throat, breathing steadily in through his nose to allow him full access. When John’s full, impressive length was fully engulfed, they both moaned gloriously. Sherlock bobbed up and down with fervor, his hand roaming his thighs and arse.
Sherlock put two fingers to his neck, just as his body fell limp. He panicked with helplessness. He didn’t have John’s medical knowledge. He wasn’t equipped to deal with this. He didn’t know what to do, who to call, where to go.
“N-no,” he cleared his throat. “Of course not. I’d just met you.” With every word that left his mouth, he felt more and more like vomiting. He tried not to notice how Sherlock’s eyes lowered, how his shoulders dropped just slightly.
“What are you laughing at?”
As I've said before, this fic was loosely inspired by Ed Sheeran's song
John’s heart hammered at the reminder of how much he talked about his past life with Sherlock in the two years he was gone.
A razor-sharp, searing hot pain exploded in his side, as he fell forward. The blazing, fiery sting burned through his whole torso. His vision went black from sheer agony. He couldn’t see. He couldn’t think.
“I guess that’s our cue to get out of the attic.”
They didn’t sleep. They stayed awake in each other’s embraces, staring at the ceiling, offering silent comfort, and wondering what the hell they were going to do tomorrow.
"Not what I expected." Another minute passed with the two of them watching the still water in silence.
Evans slammed the drawers shut and stalked right up to him. “Where were you last night?” he asked plainly.
“This is not where I left it. I remember perfectly well setting this on the dining table to look at later.” John felt it would be a bad time to remind him that
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John growled as he glared at Ray’s quivering form on the ground.
Several long moments passed. John’s breathing quickened as emotion filled him: love, anger, betrayal, love, relief, love, grief, rage, love.
“Do you believe me now?” he asked gently, his hand skimming over the bandages again. Sherlock’s bottom lip trembled, and he looked genuinely afraid. His face noticeably paled at the reminder of what had just happened.
"Will you just shut up and go with it, you big baby?" With another dramatic huff, Sherlock read the paper out loud in mock-excitement.
“I’ll leave you to it then,” Sean said. “The rest of us will be in the lounge until Evans gets here. You can join us, or not. Up to you.” The door quietly shut, leaving John all alone. His jittering nerves died down and were immediately replaced with a dull but painful ache in his whole body.
“John, please don’t,” Sherlock said. His voice was hoarse and cracked.
“No.”
This realization made Sherlock’s reaction highly amusing. His eyebrows were raised and his eyes defiantly asked “What?” as his fork was frozen halfway to his mouth. A bit of sauce lingered on the corner of his lip.
“I know,” Sherlock said, standing in front of his cell with his hands behind his back.
“Sounds fantastic.”
John smiled and they continued to effortlessly step and glide in perfect sync.
“Oi,” he said. “Something wrong?”
“I’m really not,” John replied a bit too quickly.
He slowly met Sherlock’s penetrating stare with glassy eyes and nodded once.
“You can’t do this. You’ll die. We’ll all die.”
“Yes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock looked at him. For the first time, he realized his friend appeared to have aged significantly since Mary’s identity was revealed. The creases in his forehead ran a little deeper, his eye bags hung a bit lower, he seemed exhausted.
They sat in comfortable silence. Just like old times, he thought.
John burst into his own fit of giggles, but was interrupted when Sherlock’s hand reached up and pulled him down too.
John hissed and buried his face in Sherlock’s neck. He was aching for it at this point. His hand joined Sherlock’s and together, they pulled harder and harder. They were both slick and leaking, almost ready to peak. The sounds created from their hands were bordering on obscene. John couldn’t stop his frantic noises, nor could Sherlock. It didn’t take long. Within minutes, hot, sticky, liquid was spurting between their bodies. John groaned into his skin while Sherlock inhaled in shuddering gasps.
Victor lunged forward and grabbed him by jaw, squeezing hard. He spoke through gritted teeth.
John suppressed a sigh. “Do you mind if I hang out a Baker Street for a bit?” He really just needed any excuse to stay away from the flat longer. Yes, Mary had practically threatened him to not be too long, but he’d enlist again before he let her put a leash around his neck.
He noticed how perfectly their hands fit together, too. It felt as though an enormous weight had been lifted off his chest and the icy boundary that had been between them since the wedding had melted away.
John ignored him, and they continued eating in comfortable silence, their ankles crossed against each other’s under the table.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Yeah, okay,” they heard Lestrade mutter from away. “I’ll just… go then.” And he left.
“So I suppose there’s no point in making any attempt to get you to come back.” Mary’s voice was cold, not the warm and sweet woman he’d married but the assassin who had almost killed his best friend.
Beside his bed was a large biscuit and a glass of water.
Sherlock drew in a shaky breath. John's hand had been covering his mouth throughout the tale, too horrified to speak or even breathe. Two tears slowly trickled down Sherlock's nose and fell into his hands. Unable to find his voice, John reached out and touched the other man's hand, letting him know he could continue at his own pace, or stop entirely if wished.
“What is it?”
“Really?” John sounded surprised. Just as surprised as he himself was.
“No, not just for that. For-” He swallowed thickly. “Everything. You’ve done so much for me.”
Sherlock looked him steadily in the eye. “I need you to go undercover. Go wait for the van and be Phil Reese. Be my eyes and ears at the motel just until we know enough to save St. Bart’s. I can’t do it because Evans already knows who I am, so it has to be you.”
Feeling a tug on the rope around his waist, he looked back to the ship to see Molly pulling the two of them in while Victor, Jackson, and Bolt uselessly watched. John clung tightly to Sherlock, who was shaking violently and nearly passed out, while they were pulled up into the air and back onto the ship. John pulled the rope off his waist and threw it back over the edge of the ship before collapsing onto the other man, panting and coughing out the remains of water in his throat.
John removed his graduation cap and tossed it above his head. Cheers filled the air as caps came raining down on him and his fellow graduates. His face lit up with joy, and pride filled his heart. Never in his life had he been so proud of himself. It hadn’t been easy to go back and finish medical school. He’d had to relearn a lot of material and retake a lot of exams. But god, it was worth it in the end. In fact, he should have done this so long ago.
“God, Sherlock. Warn a man before you just spring something like that on him.” But he softened when he took in Sherlock’s vulnerable, waiting eyes. “Um . . .”
“No!” he yelled, reaching his arm out.
“Seriously?” John asked, stifling a giggle. “Sounds like a total womanizer.”
“It kind of was my fault,” John answered, looking down at his feet.
“Sherlock, lo-” A brief panic in his chest halted his words. He couldn’t deny that the word “love” was just about to roll off his tongue with ease. But now wasn’t the time to contemplate why it had felt so natural to say that.
“John, I’ve got another one,” Sherlock said much quieter.
Mycroft’s manic grin morphed into something resembling a genuine smile. He stuck his hand out and waited for John to take it.
A few years later, she heard him say he needed someone to seduce John Watson. Sherlock Holmes was going to die, one way or another, and someone needed to watch his companion to make sure he was dead. If he somehow escaped his inevitable death, John would be the one to know.
“Aww, none of that now,” he drawled, rising from the chair and stalking towards her. He stopped in front of her and watched blankly as she continued sniffling softly and wiping forming tears from her ducts before they fell. “Are you happy to see me?” he repeated softly – and genuinely this time.
“Of course! You’re the Holmes boy. The younger one if I remember correctly. Your older brother was something of prick, was he not?” He paused, stroking his chin thoughtfully. “Yes… That’s right, I shot up your mummy and daddy, didn’t I? Gosh,” he said, smiling as if remembering a fond childhood memory. “That was so long ago. We were both so young.  I was just starting out in my life as a pirate lord, and I was already able to take down one of the most influential families in Britain.”
Mary shut the door to her office behind her, setting her purse and keys down on the chair.
He was vaguely aware of someone shouting his name in a panicked frenzy, though it was muffled and disoriented. There was some shuffling, someone yelling . . .
burned brightly on the screen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock lifted his head, inviting him to explore the white column of his neck. “You do call me a colorful variety of names, don’t you,” he teased.
John’s shouts were again muffled by the hand pressing onto him. His kicking and thrashing got him nowhere. Whatever this force was was stronger than any human he had encountered.
John thrashed on the bed, gasping for breath and trying not to hurt himself. He was already so close - between the warmth surrounding his cock, the wetness of his tongue, and seeing Sherlock down between his legs, his cheekbones hollowed out from sucking
John couldn’t help but chuckle as he watched two massive policemen leap out of the way for the tiny woman.
“Sean, show him to his room,” Tony ordered. John nodded at him thankfully and then followed Sean out of the lounge. His shoulder brushed Victor’s as he passed him, and he could feel his brown, almond eyes tracking him all the way until they turned around the corner.
John couldn’t reply just yet. Of all the things he thought Sherlock was keeping from him, he never thought that was anywhere in the realm of possibilities. He had accepted long ago that his feelings would forever be unrequited and had stopped trying figure out Sherlock’s romantic and sexual orientation. But this… it was a good thing Sherlock was repeating it over and over again into his palms or he would have thought he hallucinated it.
Angelo arrived with their food, breaking the dreadful, heavy silence. John plastered on a fake smile and thanked him as he set down two identical, steaming plates of pasta in front of them.
Hoping Sherlock wouldn't notice in the darkness, he slightly turned his nose to breathe in the scent of his curls, shamelessly indulging in their closeness the same way he had in front of the fireplace. He shivered remembering how goosebumps had raised on every bit of pale skin his fingers skimmed over. How they had been so close, he could feel Sherlock's warm puffs of breath on his lips.

John chuckled at how much lower Sherlock had to duck to avoid hitting his head against anything. It felt like a nice payback for all the times Sherlock could reach a high ladder or jump a fence, and he was left to struggle.
“Hello Annie dear. . .” a familiar voice drawled from behind her.
John grabbed his face and pulled him down for a rough, hungry kiss. One and two more thrusts, and Sherlock was coming inside him with a loud, strangled cry. He reached down and fisted John’s cock, one, two, three times and finished him off as well.
“You are a human being.” Another tear.
“Oh, and John,” she said, as he turned to leave. The genuine softness in her eyes snapped him out of his hazed fury. “I really hope you two sort things out. Whatever it is that’s going on between you.” She smiled knowingly at him.
“Sherlock,” he croaked.
And of course, thanks to each and every single person who took a chance on this fic and read it! I'm so happy this is finished and I hope you guys enjoyed the ups and downs of this journey as much as I have. Take care, I love you all! xo
“Victor, no. It’s not tracking him down that’s impossible. You can’t possibly hope to take him on and survive. He’s too dangerous.”
John dumped his bags on the bed and headed back downstairs. Once in the living room, he found that Sherlock had prepared two cups of tea and had started the fire.
He rose and spoke to John, Molly, and Greg. “I brought you all up here so that you can witness me carry out the ends of my plan. And Sherlock, so you can see me have everything you worked for. While you just sit there. Because you gave up. Tie them up.”
“Jacket.”
His voice shook, but remained relatively controlled.
“Good, good. I’m working on a case today. An ongoing one, in fact. Been working on this one for a while. Most interesting case for months. Want to come?”
“You slept well?” Victor’s eyes remained locked solidly on his, confident and mischievous.
"When I was fifteen, my family went out for a week on our cruise boat. Mycroft and I both groaned at our parents' need for a vacation. But the thought it would do us well to get away, so we were dragged along. On our fourth day out at sea, we were ambushed by a pirate ship, led by the infamous pirate lord James Moriarty. Mycroft and I watched as our parents were brutally shot and killed when they realized we brought minimal valuables with us on board.
“What?” Sherlock peeked one eye at him.
John woke to an empty bed. He lay on his stomach with his arm outstretched as if it had been thrown over someone. Sherlock waking up before him was to be expected. He never slept long, and it seemed that somewhere between the hours of 4 and 6 a.m. they actually had fallen asleep.
“He wasn’t always like that, you know.” John realized Molly was watching him stare at Sherlock while they worked, which he admittedly did quite a lot.
His blood ran cold.
“Oh.” He blushed slightly as realization dawned. “Carry on then.”
Sherlock leaned against the patterned wallpaper, clutching the wrinkled piece of paper in his hands.
“Have coffee?” Molly finished for him, perking up.
Collapsed side by side on the pavement, they caught their breath and listened to the house continue to go up in flames. The soft crackles, the collapsing beams . . .
After what felt like several minutes, John felt a sudden dizziness overcome him, and he went weak at the knees. Sherlock felt his shift in weight and supported him in his arms.
"What's new with you?"
He looked around and noticed a mini fridge in the main room. It was unplugged. Anything inside surely would have gone bad by now. But that meant this room has been used to store and possibly prepare meals. Surely then, there would be something here he could use.
He tried opening his eyes, but his vision was blurry and all he could make out was the blinding sunlight. Allowing his eyelids to fall back shut, he forced himself to tune into the conversation around him to keep himself from drifting off again.
“Hey,” they heard from outside. “What’s that over there?”
(See the end of the chapter for
before last night?” he asked, leading into the inevitable conversation he knew was bound to happen.
“Excuse you,” John mumbled to himself.
“No, you’re my fair maiden, John. I have to come rescue you!” He lunged forwards and tackled John by the waist so he fell backwards onto the couch.
John cleared his throat. “Did I mean what?” Even to himself, his voice sounded cracked and unsteady in the still, quiet kitchen.
“What?”
I'm really sorry if you were hoping for a more detailed description of their night together! I tried really hard to write something smuttier, but I just... couldn't do it. I know, I'm a terrible person. Maybe when I write my next fan fiction I'll be less self conscious :P
That evening, John sat in his claimed armchair by the fire while Sherlock paced in front of him, pulling at his hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Across the room, Sherlock didn’t appear to be doing much better. He stood still as a statue with his flashlight pointed to the ground, like he couldn’t look away. John remembered how he had panicked when Moriarty strapped a bomb to that innocent child. As much as he liked to pretend he was above it all, he knew he cared. Particularly when it came to children. He almost wanted to go and console his friend. It seemed he didn’t even know how to cope with what was in front of him. How to process that someone could commit such inhumane acts.
Everyone barked out a collective “Aye!” before running to their respective stations. John tried to shield his face from the forceful wind smacking the frigid rain in his face and get a look at Sherlock. He was up directing Greg who was pulling and yanking and the wheel with his whole body, attempting to navigate the thrashing waves.
“John, you are distantly in the Walters bloodline. Moloch has reason to want to harm you specifically. We must leave immediately.”
"Oh, don't be like that, love. We go to dinner all the time. It’s our first time celebrating your birthday together and I wanted to do something special.”
He lept up the stairs, two at a time, his face reddened by shame. He yanked the door open just in time to hear Sherlock’s bedroom door shut quietly. He could practically hear the sulking going on on the other side.
John grabbed his coat and stormed out the door leaving Sherlock rooted to the spot, head down, not having uttered a word in response. Part of him knew he was overreacting, but sometimes Sherlock needed to be told off.
“Did you take it?”
Instead he focused on cleaning his chest. He brushed his thumb over a patch of skin a bit too slowly . . . a bit too softly . . . lingering a bit too long. His eyes met Sherlock’s for the briefest moment before darting back down to the cuts.
“Where did Sherlock go?”
Or he could fess up. Once he was no longer with Mary, he’d be able to begin his life anew. He could start fresh with Sherlock too. This was a conversation they’d probably never have again.
He ran his fingers delicately over the intricate, hand-carved design, and then over the wicked, gleaming blade that jutted out of it. On the side of the wooden handle were the initials ‘B.R.’
He shook John’s hand firmly and released it, leaving John dumbfounded. John shook his head in confusion and turned back around. The men were still standing in his way.
“What am I doing wrong, John?” It was barely above a wobbly whisper, but given their close proximity John heard every word perfectly. And it cut through his core.
(See the end of the chapter for
John knew who he was addressing. But before he could reply, Julia said, “Oh, I’d love to.”
He tossed the invitation on the table in annoyance. One case, he told himself. He would go on this one case, behave himself, and then explain to Sherlock that he couldn’t work with him anymore.
(Actually, it's just because the ch11 is super short, so there's no point in dragging it out)
“Well, let me check on them at least. Come over here to the kitchen. Better lighting.”
John’s heart halted abruptly in his chest. She and Sherlock have . . . what?
*****
Sherlock caught his eye and began backing up to the bedroom, the invitation clear in his twinkling, mischievous eyes. John followed without hesitation, unbuttoning his shirt as he did so.
Thanks for reading and for sticking with this fic as I always take forever to update! <3 I appreciate it!
“Oh god,” he breathed, taking his phone out with trembling fingers and dialing Sherlock. “Oh god no. No, no, no.”
Greg Lestrade came pounding down the stairs and let him out. “Feeling alright?”
More than a few times, Stacey had to pull on their linked arms to draw his gaze away.
“None of us did.” Sherlock smiled down at him gratefully.
“Sherlock, you saw it this time. You must have seen it!”
Sherlock leaned forward and cautiously placed his hand on his forearm. He was thankful when John didn’t pull away.
I hope you’re not trying to evasively refer to the paranormal, John.”
Btw, my tumblr is @one-thousand-splendid-stars if you want to say hi :) As always, I hope you're enjoying, and comments are kudos are appreciated!
“John. You need to leave right now.”
John could feel the twisted scowl on his face and made no attempt to mellow it. With a deep breath, he diverted the conversation away from Sherlock.
“Sorry.”
“Okay. Want to tell me what this is about?”
Anyway, I hope this chapter was worth the wait, at least. A lot of comments last chapter had something to say about Sherlock’s one mattress… patience my darlings!! ;)
*****
Moriarty snapped his fingers in realization. John’s couldn’t figure out if his hesitation in recognizing Sherlock was an act or not.
“Yes. You know what I need to do? What I didn’t get to finish doing before?” She shook her head. “I made a promise to burn the heart out of him. I intend to keep it.”
“M’fine. Just a nightmare.”
In fact, John spaced out so hard that he didn’t even realize when everyone else had finished eating and the table was cleared to make way for a skinny, silver briefcase. Sean opened the latch and lifted the lid, revealing rows of circular, colored chips and a deck of cards.
*****
John stared in shock as the other man’s face scrunched up in anticipation of rejection. He thought for a moment. He had nothing back home. No friends, no family. Not even a place to live. He wouldn’t really be giving anything up by staying here. Plus, being on this ship has been the most exhilarating adventure he had ever had.
He was mumbling all kinds of jumbled nonsense back in the alley, and said so many things he probably didn't mean to say. On top of that, it seemed like Sherlock had been on his own for a long time. His question was probably just his drugged-up way of asking if John really cared for him. Which, of course, the answer was yes. That much should be clear to him in the morning when he wakes up in his bed. Besides, what would it matter if John did supposedly love him? What would someone like Sherlock want to do with someone like him in the long run? Sherlock was so far out of his league it was almost unbelievable that they'd even struck up a partnership at all.
John was stunned into silence. He had never considered that someone like Sherlock actually had a history, and could have been hurt. His heart went out to the man, and he became even more intrigued about his past.
“Hey,” John said, coming in the room. “You okay?”
“Shit,” John breathed. “Sorry. I’m so sorry.”
“You can call yourself a sociopath all you want. You can pretend you’re heartless and immune to emotions and have no conscious. But at the end of the day, I know you better than anyone, and I know that’s not who you are.  You’re my best friend.”
John had happened to own an identical flash drive and had scrawled Mary’s initials on them before Christmas dinner. That was the one he threw in the fire while the real one remained safe at home.
“I was supposed to have a fresh batch of cookies ready for you, Sherlock. We were all going to have snack together before you two continued on your way,” she said as they headed back inside.
Settled in the back of the cab, John sized up Sherlock’s condition. He had just run through a burning building shirtless and was now consequently covered in scrapes and cuts. John immediately removed his jumper and wrestled it onto him.
Now, in their first moment of complete calmness since taking the case, he sized him up for remaining injuries.
Molly made her way over to John to begin their day's work together, but stopped in her tracks upon seeing the  two giggling men staring at each other, lost in their own world. Looking past Sherlock's shoulder, John caught her eye. Putting her hands behind her back, she slowly backed away from them, and with a cheeky smile, turned to go chat with Greg at the wheel.
John smirked, unintimidated. “Alright, suite yourself, mate.”
he told himself.
All those years ago where it could have ended . . .
Moriarty had anchored onto them.
“In fairness though, he was an idiot, too.”
“Sherlock… Sherlock…” John repeated in desperate pants as he crawled to the edge of the ship. His heart pounded steady and firm in his ears. Gripping the ledge, he pulled his entire weight up with only his wobbly arms.
“I call you lots of names,” he tried, in an attempt to playfully change the topic.
He wasn’t sure how long he could hold his breath. Not very long surely. And his body going fully into panic mode wasn’t helping things.
“If –
John took it out and fished around in the toe to find – nothing.
John kneeled in front of him. “Shit, Sherlock. I’m sorry. Don’t cry, please.” He placed his hands on his knees.
“So,” he started, clearly amused at the sight of the three of them huddling together on the floor.  John, still weak and limp from Sherlock’s death, was heavily leaning on Molly for support.
John lifted Sherlock’s splintered hands, breathed onto them, and rubbed them together between his own. Sherlock let him, sighing in appreciation at the burst of warmth. He reciprocated afterwards by wrapping his arms around John and rubbing circulation back into his arms.
“No. Oh god, no… you can’t…. please…” John’s knees had now gone so weak that he slumped forward. The crew man’s arms were the only thing keeping him from falling. He watched a single tear trickle calmly down Sherlock’s face and his heart tore in his chest. His body shook with sobs.
“I’m alright,” Sherlock slurred. He clearly wasn’t.
“Hi, handsome,” she said in reply, her voice low and seductive.
He cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Ready?” he asked and cocked his head towards the door.
“What thing?”
Sherlock’s eyes widened innocently. “You do?”
“The lady in blue over there seems to be chatting up Mr. Posh Mustache.”
Warning for mentions of child death in this chapter
She let out a nervous chuckle. “Yes, well… he’s a halfway decent guy, isn’t he? No, sorry! I just meant- I mean not that he isn’t…Anyway,” She shook her head at herself and moved on.
– if I’m Westley, then you’re Buttercup!”
With horror, John only then realized that she was in fact holding his gun to Sherlock’s head. His gaze dropped down to Sherlock, whose widened eyes glanced up at him momentarily before looking back down.
The tall, metal gate was already opened for them, granting access to the cleared path to the front steps.
He thrust the bottle into Sherlock’s free hand. Before he knew it, an entire cool, slick finger had slid into him. He cried out and they both stilled, giving him time to adjust. After a moment, Sherlock added another and began scissoring his fingers in and out.
“No!” he screamed and dove to the ground, beating her to him. He pulled Sherlock into his chest, cradling his bleeding head in one arm and wrapping the other around his torso. “Don’t touch him.” He hissed quietly, anger warping his voice into something low and feral. “Don’t you ever fucking touch him
“No, please,” Sherlock begged. “I’ll talk. Just leave John alone.”
With a suggestive smile, he guided his knees to rest atop his shoulders. Now with his head between his thighs, he gazed up at him adoringly.
Beside him, Sherlock was smiling fondly to himself and eyeing the floor with much more interest than before. His lightly drummed his fingers along to the music.
Sherlock turned the page of his chemistry book and sighed. Why did he think he’d be able to get any studying done here? He never should have agreed to come.
“Someone tell me what the hell is going on!”
“John.” Molly touched his arm reminding him they had a job to do.  They began gathering the discarded chests and items that had blown out of place and tying them down. The ship continued to lurch back and forth, often undoing their work.
But almost in an instant, the hunger he felt was replaced by the tight squeeze of dread and guilt.
“Oh please,” he said with a warm twinkle in his eye. “Call me Jim.”
“In my duffel.”
But his fingers didn’t leave his skin.
“Yes, Sherlock, you were.”
“Why so many?”
“No.”
Thankfully, Sherlock’s phone beeped, breaking the dreadful silence.
But on the rare days when John woke up first, he took full advantage of it. He’d admire Sherlock’s sleeping form next to him, then teasingly drag him out of his slumber for a morning treat.
“Yeah?” After the sixth time getting caught by her, John had given up on denying he was staring at Sherlock.
“Hello?” came a familiar, deep voice.
He watched that pale, bony hand trail slowly and teasingly down the side of her curvy body, grip her thigh, and pull her leg up against him. He looked back to John and smiled coldly.
One of their last nights together before the fall. John had reached through the metal bars and pulled Sherlock in close by his coat, their hand cuffed together above them. Their lips hovered. He could feel his breath on his skin. He could have done it then. They were so close . . .
Sherlock looked over at Molly, who was removing her dishes from the cabinets and placing them in a container. He normally didn’t socialize much with anyone who wasn’t John. The time he spent with others was limited almost solely to family or work-related events. He just didn’t see the point in spending useless time with others. But John must have caught him in a good mood, because the idea of going to a group dinner with these people – his
Behind them, Lestrade gave a hearty cheer and Molly giggled. John pushed deeper and deeper into Sherlock’s mouth, indifferent to their audience. Sherlock broke the tight seal of their lips and pulled back with much difficulty. “John,” he gasped.
“You alright, mate?” Mike Stamford asked.
His feelings for Sherlock had not diminished in the slightest over the past few weeks, but his mental stability sure had.  Being a part of Sherlock’s life and without actually being with him how he’d want to be had taken a toll on him. With a heavy weight settling into his chest, he finally and fully understood that he was in for a torturous life. There was no end in sight to this. And now, not even was any chance of a romance with Sherlock gone for good, but their friendship was at stake. Just hanging by a thread.
Even when they had all left, John remained tucked in his corner, his chest heaving as he tried to work out what just happened. What the hell had he just heard? What was the crew going to do now that Sherlock had no plan or objective to lead them on? They surely didn't seem too pleased about it. Even at the end, their suspiciously calm response still gave off a spiteful vibe. And they had called him lover boy, too. He knew most of the crew by now had at least inferred that they were more than friends, but to hear them explicitly state it left John feeling very uneasy.
John cast a forearm over his face. The events from last night left him certain of only one thing: Mary had won.
“Alright, good.
John looked up into Moriarty’s empty, black eyes in defiance. He was not afraid. He chose this and would rather die than sacrifice his dignity and spite Sherlock’s memory by working for this despicable man.
“No, you can’t! How are you-”
“No, first thing we’re doing when we get home is going the fuck to sleep.” It meant to come out as a playful, yet somewhat serious retort, but the effect was lost through his chattering teeth and shaking voice.
“Right. And how exactly will we do that?”
“It could have been the two of us, you know,” she continued.  “I could have kept you safe from Moriarty. But you chose Sherlock. You chose wrong and you will pay for it and that’s your fault.”
For instance, on this morning, he awoke bright and early, rolling over to gaze at Sherlock. He was asleep on his stomach, his arms wrapped tightly around his pillow and his face turned to the side. John placed his fingertips on his nose and cheek, stroking him fondly. With his beautiful body on display like this, adorned with the pale sunlight peeking in from their curtains, he just couldn’t resist touching him.
Sherlock mixing up baby formula into his chemistry set by mistake. The two of them arguing over who gets up in the middle of the night. John having to stop him from performing experiments on her.
Giddy smiles grew and remained plastered onto both of their beaming faces as they danced in careless circles around the living room.
“Ready?” Sherlock asked, pulling him back to the present. He opened the door, allowing John to climb in first. They settled in for the four-hour drive while the cabbie took off.
They slotted their legs together and used each other’s thighs for a bit of much needed friction. John shamelessly moaned as he ravished the mouth he had fantasized about since first seeing it. Sherlock gripped his head, returning his every move and hardly letting him breathe.
“First off, some news,” Evans said. “Unfortunately, there was a break-in last night.” All three of them snapped to attention at this. “When I arrived this morning, a window was cracked open and the screen was torn. Naturally, I went right to the office. Found it unlocked. Nothing was taken, but we need to be more vigilant. I don’t know who did it, but if someone’s after us, we need to keep our eyes peeled. Got it?”
John let that sink in. Sherlock was actually willing to die for him. They gazed out into the water for several minutes, content in their silence. John settled further into Sherlock’s chest and enjoyed the sound of the rolling waves, the crackling sea,  the rushing wind, and Greg and Molly’s cheerful laughter up at the wheel.
“I think we can agree after last night that it’s best if we no longer split up.”
Several days passed and no one came for Sherlock. Until one day, Jackson came down to the brig with a different order to carry out. Sherlock rose from his spot to follow him up, but was stopped.
Besides, even if he did take the plunge in initiating a romantic relationship with Sherlock, who knew if he would accept? Maybe John had just been imagining things these past few months and he really wasn’t interested after all. Perhaps this was for the better. Maybe Mary was just saving him from an inevitable heartbreak.

Sherlock might be able to brush this under the rug and pretend it never happened. Heck, the man had probably already deleted it, now that he had no immediate need for sexual stimulation.
The endless uncertainty of Sherlock’s feelings for him chipped away at his sanity day by day, but he never left. He couldn’t face Sherlock again after so long until he had figured things out.
*****
“Sherlock?” he asked.
John wasn't too worried. Perhaps he was dealing with something important and would come back later. He started to head back to his cabin when he heard several hushed voices coming from further down the hall. Following them, against his better judgment, he located the closed off area they were coming from. Pressing his ear to the door, he tried to make out the muffled sounds but it was no use.
Oh god, he thought, running a hand through his hair. Guilt crashed into him as he thought how brutally he had treated Sherlock not two minutes ago.
Sometime later, they both settled in plush armchairs by the fireplace, hot cups of tea in hand. For a while there was only silence except for the logs crackling under the flames. John let his eyes glaze over as he stared into the fire.
Yet he couldn’t bring himself to just admit it. Just one word.
Sherlock held tightly to John’s waist and clutched the rope with his other hand as they were pulled up to safety.
“Where the hell is he?!” he bellowed into the phone ignoring the driver waiting for instructions.
Sherlock’s eyes crinkled and the tears threatened to pour out.
And the baby. She was almost seven months pregnant. If she had to flee at any point, what would she do with her child?
“Yes, but what else do you have on Tony and Sean? Their motivations, how they know Evans, etc. What have you deduced?”
I don't think I'll be doing a third "episode" for this series to make it a complete "series." Just cause I've already fixed everything I wanted to fix from S4 and everything has been resolved, I don't think it's necessary, and I don't really want to lol. So yeah, this is the end!
“No.”
Sherlock simply stared back in question. No one ever paid him even the slightest bit of attention. Why would the rugby captain, of all people, care to do it? The boy grinned at him once more before returning his attention to his mates.
“It was lovely meeting you both. Just call if you need anything.” She dropped a wink. “Sherlock has my number.” She chuckled lightly at his expression when she said this.
He pushed himself out of Sherlock’s hold and rushed off the floor. Behind him, Sherlock remained rooted to the spot, alone and confused, but he couldn’t bring himself to look back.
John’s insides were frozen and he was shivering violently.  Suddenly a blanket was being draped around his shoulders and there were large hands rubbing firmly up and down his arms. He pulled the blanket tighter around his body and finally allowed himself to look up at Sherlock.
And he knew the last piece of the puzzle to complete his happiness was to be with Sherlock in every aspect of the word. And now that possibility was within his reach, but he still couldn’t have it. That was the worst punishment Mary could have inflicted upon him. She really had burned his heart out.
At her feet, Sherlock’s breath hitched at the reminders of all the cruel, heartless things he had done over the past several weeks. John wanted nothing more than to rush forward and take his face in his hands. To brush away the soft tears that were no doubt there, to tell him how much he was loved, and how badly he’d wanted to tell him all this time.
He just held him there for a moment, feeling his trembling breaths and wordless apologies.
“Sherlock what the hell. What are you talking about?”
"But you could have looted. Taken their valuables. And you didn't. I know you have a great heart underneath all that, Sherlock. I could see it from the start."
Sherlock sat shirtless on an armchair as John knelt in front of him, dabbing ointment onto the three slashes. They weren’t that deep, but they bled quite a bit.
“Don’t worry about it. I’ve got to help Leah and Sally with the move in a few hours anyway.”
“Go on your own, John. Maybe you’ll meet a nice woman to settle down with while you’re there.”
Sherlock ignored her and rummaged through her files, adding to the increasing pile of loose papers on the floor and table.
“Time for me to own up too. I miscalculated something major which resulted in me capturing the wrong ship and taking an innocent captive. My apologies, John.”
