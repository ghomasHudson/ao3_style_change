The glare Cass sends Dean’s way is nothing short of scalding, though Dean doesn’t seem to notice as he glares back.
“Then why did I hear him coughing in his room? He seemed really tired yesterday too.” he says with a small pout.
The door is flung open with a loud bang that jars Dean. He glances at Cass and sees his expression change… it’s as though any semblance of emotion has been wiped away and he sits there in stunned silence.
Dean fumes, turning away and marching back down the path, “We’re done here.” He calls over his shoulder.
“I’ll take that as a yes. It’s a classic after all,” Crowley smirks at his discomfort. “Let’s think of the little squirrel as Dean, naturally. And the acorn he destroys anything chasing after as Castiel.” It’s not a bad comparison, Sam thinks. “The squirrel continuously breaks the world in some futile attempt to catch the acorn, that for some reason, just keeps leaving him. Imagine if the squirrel had a book, telling him how to catch the acorn, or the acorn had a book telling him the best ways to stay with the squirrel. The world would be a better place.”
He gasps, realising that Adam must have been taking the brunt of the screeching transmission while he surveyed the area to make sure it was safe. Now, Michael is here, so he won’t have to suffer any longser. “Thank you for bearing this Adam.”
Dean jabs his shoulder, apparently having forgotten about his earlier anger. “I thought about making a mini trench coat out of the original… then I realised Cass will skin me alive when he gets back and I’ve shredded his only outfit.”
When Cass looks at him next, his eyes are vulnerable. “Because I’m feeling the same things you are, Dean.”
“He played my fears, like a movie, in front of me.” and at the horrified look on Dean’s face he adds, “Your prayers helped alert me to the fact that none of it was real. They gave me a reason to hold on and not get lost in my own mind.”
“I was confused.” He reminds his friend, setting a pancake out (like a peace offering) “I just had some of the best sex in my life… I just wanted to make sure you hadn’t broken me.”
His eyes search Cass’ face for any sign of uncertainty. He doesn’t want to start this thing off wrong. But is that possible as it had started with Cass yanking his ass out of hell?
Castiel grabs the frail box with his meagre belongings and races to the garage. Sam’s words swirling in his head. He was right. He’s always been selfish when it came to Dean.
Castiel’s eyes flash to Cass and Dean sees some form of silent communication pass between them. “Some things… aren’t for you to hear from me.” he takes a step forward and wraps his arms around Dean, cradling his head to his shoulder. “But I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you. I’m sorry that you suffered but I hope that – that the time we did spend together wasn’t completely horrible for you.”
Just as he’s shoving the pearl into his pocket, wanting to let them all have a moment to think clearly about the situation, Cass topples into him sending him crashing into the wall.
is there.” He presses a hand to his lips. “You stopped coming. It’s been… almost an entire year and I don’t know what to do?”
Something tears inside him and his fist darts out, hoping to knock Sam out, give them some time to think of a plan. But his panic makes him sloppy – easy to read. Sam bats his hand away and dives backwards. Dean realises what he’s going for a minute too late. As his fingers wrap around the lamp, Castiel’s form flickers as his new owner takes control.
He forces himself to shut his eyes, pushing it down as he was thought. Someday soon he’ll find that there’s no more room in the inn, no more space for the guilt and shame to be shoved into. He dreads it.
“Cass.” Says Dean, reaching over to shake Castiel’s shoulder, the angel leans so far in that he almost topples off his chair. Under normal circumstances Dean would find this hilarious but the look on Cass’ face answers questions he’d been too chickenshit to ask.
But as they make their way down the bunker stairs all he can think of is that he wanted to get back early to decorate. Cass takes most of his weight coming down the stairs and thankfully doesn’t make a fuss about it, before carting Dean off to his room.
It gives him a thrill, that some part of him is inside Cass. Soon to be expunged by the angel’s ‘digestive system,’ but there nevertheless.
But that doesn’t matter, he’s got a fancy new coping mechanism… better than beer, better than sex… welcome to the world of weed.
“Come on, you’re plenty useful.” Dean tries to comfort him. Evidently, Cass really believes that he’s useless.
Dean lets out a breathy laugh, feeling his dick twitch at the change in sensation. “Dude. Means you can pull off and I’ll finish with my hand.”
Castiel follows Dean as he saunters over purposefully to the receptionist. “Hi there.” He says, flashing his badge. By now, Castiel knows to do the same.
“So you’ll stay away?” Sam tries to confirm. He chooses to spare Dean’s dignity and pretend he didn’t hear him validate his trench-coat fetish.
As Dean flashes him a feeble smile and walks out of the room on unsteady legs Castiel wonders what he’s really doing.
Castiel wraps both hands around their cocks, trying to touch as much skin as possible. Dean immediately moans into his neck, hips picking up the pace. Castiel wars with keeping his hands in place and taking the opportunity to squeeze Dean’s ass. He’d regretted not doing it enough the night before.
“Well, uh, I didn’t think you were interested in the first place.” Dean says, “Bigshot angel and all.”
The first finger enters him slowly, dragging deliciously over his prostate and causing him to just about jump out of his skin.
Holding up a hand, Dean silences him. “I know, I know. Don’t worry.” He smiles. “I just– You have me at a disadvantage now.”
Using the sleeve of his trench-coat, he tries to wipe away the dirt to reveal the inscription. He can tell why Dean is so obsessed with it and learning its properties. There’s a certain pull he feels, as though something is leading him towards it.
Had Castiel sensed him and flown over to dispatch of him? Ugh. Right when he caught onto the story of the century.
“Offered to make it threesome myself, but our dear Dean seems quite adverse to the idea. Doubt you’ll have much better luck feathers.”
“This isn’t the Dean you know.” His Cass’ voice is gentle but firm yet it makes his counterpart’s face fall instantly.
He’s been gone awhile and in that time, Castiel has drifted in and out of consciousness quite a few times. He kind of prefers unconsciousness at that point because it’s the only time he doesn’t feel the crushing guilt of knowing what he did to Dean.
Cass hurriedly shifts his hand to cover Dean’s, mimicking the up and down motions. Soon enough, Cass’ hand slows and loses rhythm, actually interrupting Dean’s tandem.
“It’s never happened to me.” He admits. “We just… walked right by it. It handed us a ticket and I let it buckle me in.”
. Needed and never wanted. He came to them and did a task. When that task was complete he was in limbo until the next time he could be useful. He just wishes Dean would understand that.
Sure, bringing them all out for a day of fun had been a nice idea initially. He hoped that he could possibly trick Cass into believing Dean is happy. Now though, it’s like a living nightmare for him.
Sure, Cass had said that his lines were blurred too. But it’s no guarantee that by the end of this he would have romantic feelings towards Dean. There’s also no guarantee that Dean will have feelings for Cass.
Dean isn’t sure that’s the right thing to say, but it’s the first thing that comes to mind. Cass just gave up so much for him… to be with him. Dean is still reeling.
Sam knows that that’s not the real reason, but he doesn’t push. This is all about them realising that words are important too.
of an excuse after what you’ve done to me.” The hurt and utter betrayal in Dean’s voice guts him, but it’s the look in his eyes that strikes the killing blow; it’s a look of utter dissonance. Dean doesn’t care what he has to say because Dean can never trust him.
“That – that…” Cass clamps his jaw shut for almost a full minute before speaking again. “I can’t believe that my wish
And of course, because the universe hates him, someone calls Dean’s name. He gives Castiel an apologetic smile before placing the bill on the table.
Dean seems lighter than he had been. More free. He always was when he didn’t have to constantly worry about Sam. Maybe he’d finally come to terms with the fact that he’d raised his brother and helped turn him into a capable adult… one who no longer needed a babysitter.
He shakes his head. Focus. He must remain focus. It had only been days since the call but Castiel felt his friend’s loss like a barbed arrow through his heart.
He turns to Cass a teary smile on his face, he can see the angel’s mind trying to churn out a solution. He stayed by their side through thick and thin and now there would be no more. Throughout his life, Dean managed to weasel his way out of many jams, but an apocalypse year in and year out has taken its toll. Dean is tired. He knows he should be following Cass’ lead. To find a way out. Glancing to his other side, he can see the look of determination on Sam’s face. If anyone deserves to make it out alive, it would be Sam. He’s the only one of them who has a chance at normal. But Chuck won’t let that happen.
It’s his own fault. If Cass trusted him he wouldn’t feel the need to do this. But Dean knows that Cass is right; that he’d take advantage of his gentleness.
He chances a glance over to Cass, finding hi gripping the door so tightly that his fingers were turning white. Dean swallows his guilt once more. His new mortality must be the reason for his new found fear. After years and years of driving these roads he knew them well enough to wear a blindfold… which, honestly, probably isn’t what his friend needs to hear at the moment.
Dean freezes like a deer in the headlights as he sees the doorknob rattling. Just his luck, it would be the old lady, or worse… Becky herself.
“Where is he?” Castiel demands, drawing his angel blade. How could he be so stupid. The plan had been to separare them all along. And he’d left Dean alone and vulnerable with a
“We’re going to scream boisterously at my rebellious plants.” Crowley says excitedly. “If that doesn’t suit your fancy feel free to hop out. But I am not stopping.”
Sam assesses him slowly, clearly considering his predicament and the ramifications of the cure. “Cass.” He begins, “You do realise that you can’t use this as proof that Dean wants something more.”
They drive in silence for a while before Dean speaks up, “You know I love Baby. But right now I’m sick of her.” he sighs, “About – all those… things… that I saw –”
“Dean you’ve slipped before.” He say wanting to placate Dean. A sulking partner is no good. “Let’s not make a big deal out of it. Get up and let’s get back to work.”
With a confident stride, Crowley saunters out of the devil’s trap, the blade raised, and pointed at Lucifer.
Maybe this ‘closeness’ can bring them all together. Kind of like a team-building exercise. Where two thirds of the team are secretly boning. Not just boning, he reminds himself. He’s like Cass’ emotional support dog, who also specialises in sex stuff.
“More than you know.” Gabriel smirks back. He tosses the blanket aside and approaches Crowley predatorily. “There is one item from last night that I’ve just been
Throwing up his hands in defeat he takes another swing and curses. Of course he had to choose the one place on the block with a screaming baby in it. Only… the pained shrieks aren’t coming from inside. They seem to be emanating from just a few paces away by his estimate… not that he can estimate all that well right now.
But Sam can’t support anyone… not even himself… he finds himself flat on the floor staring up at baby Cass and wondering when things had gotten so royally fucked.
And maybe – maybe – one last ditch effort in a world gone mad is enough to turn the tides just enough so they might hear what ‘the exultant sound of a canon booming in the night’ really means.
His grace was no longer kicking like a bull in a pen and somehow along the way he’d completely forgotten the purpose of this endeavour. Castiel’s smile withered and he felt himself withdraw. He should tell Dean. He never wants this dance they’re doing to stop but he doesn’t want his first time with Dean to be something coerced due to misplaced gratitude.
The need to beg him to say something is strong, yet the lack of emotion in his eyes has him quailing.
Cass nods then ambles over to the side of Dean’s bed. He slides the door open and casually takes out the bottle of lube before walking over to Dean and setting it down.
He just bought himself the new Casa Erotica Film actually. For a particularly luxurious session that he’s planning for later.
His hands feel numb in his lap. He isn’t sure what to do with them. Should he use them to comfort Dean just like in the movies? Is that something Dean would appreciate at this moment?
His bones ache and chills run through his skin. Dean almost wishes he could cry but the panic blocks any of other emotions.
“Okay.” Dean takes an exaggerated breath. “Water… it isn’t really wet you know. Use the conditioner to slick things up down there.”
“Oh, you - I’m going to enjoy making you scream.” It purrs, stalking closer predatorily. “I could definitely be lulled to sleep by such a sweet sound.”
“Hmm.” The man hums, he leans close. So close that a thrill of fear spikes through Michael. What if this man kisses Adam? What if Adam goes along with it?
If Dean found out things would never right between them. He’d see Castiel as he’d seen every woman who sought his attention. He’d push him away, even more than usual. Dean would never share his true thoughts on anything… not if he knew.
Castiel even has a hard time coming to terms with it. He’d hated himself for even thinking it for so long. The first time Dean had wanted to leave them, he’d thought about it. But Dean had agreed to stay so he hadn’t pursued the thought any further. Even Castiel could come away from this plan driven to madness if even one thing went wrong.
Footsteps echo against the concrete floors and the light is flicked on. “Hey!” Sam says excitedly. “Cass you found that thing… the… uh oh.”
“I think I understand why Dean likes you,” Sam says with a grin, the fear he had felt just a few moments ago, fading seamlessly into the background.
He’s always held a smidgen of hope. Tormenting himself with it for years. Now, maybe it’s for the best that he has a clear answer. He can stop making a fool of himself. Stop holding out hope for something that would never happen.
Yeah, he decides. Venturing out of his room might be good. The only bad thing that could happen is seeing Sam in curlers, but then again, that hadn’t happened for a while.
Castiel passes Dean in the hall and the look that he gave him… guilt… shame. If he didn’t know better, he’d say Dean was on his way to rob a bank.
“Just stop.” He tries to grab onto the lapels of his coat. “It was wrong – I know it was wrong – please –”
Dean hasn’t smelled anything that putrid in a while. It takes him back to the thousands of decaying bodies him and Sam dealt with. By the smell of it, it’s been there for a while. Dean half hopes that it’s the thing that ate the poor birds. Maybe a racoon or a fox. The smell leads him right to it. And boy is it a beast. Just… quite obviously, not the one he’d been hoping for.
He knows that breaking it would negate any wish in progress. He knows that wishes can’t circumvent cosmic entities. He knows that Dean has the pearl. He shakes his head, refocusing on the camera.
He cuts the engine off, half surprised neither of them had come out. The Impala parked to the side lets him know that they’re definitely home.
Castiel gives him a knowing look. “Just imaging what you could be if he knew it too. Dean and I were in love long before we ever said a word about it to each other. The only difference between us and you and your Castiel is that we both recognised the other’s feelings.”
“Dean, what if turns back one day and finds that you’re old… or worse… dead?” Sam asks, because he suddenly feels like he has to remind Dean that they actually do want their friend back to normal. “What do you think he-”
Frowning, he wonders what brought this on. Why now? It had been years since Dean started calling him ‘Cass.’
“Dean doesn’t know.” Sam divulges, feeling his skin crawl. Cass had gone over a year thinking that Dean knew but didn’t care.
To his right, Sam stirs, sitting up slowly and pressing a hand to his head. “While you were sleeping over there, some mystery figure peppered us in mystical dust.” Dean snaps.
“I know you Cass.” Dean says firmly. “You’re not getting out there anytime soon. You deserve to feel all the things you want to feel. You and me Cass.” He offers, holding his hand out. “I can show you what it means to be close.”
“No. No.” Sam assures, still looking at him curiously. Like he’s one of those weird crosswords Sam likes to solve. “It’s just, I thought you and Cass should go to dinner alone. Capitalise on your time together. It’s already making you this happy.”
Dean shuts his eyes to avoid the constant staring. Cass had walked out a few minutes ago and ever since Mom’s been watching him like a hawk.
Dean thinks for a moment before patting his thigh and hell if Castiel doesn’t stiffen. “Nah. I don’t – don’t want them to hear us.”
Relief floods through Dean once more. He’d been so worried that Cass would abandon him. Head back to Sam and the bunker and leave him here to rot. “I didn’t want to confuse you.”
Dean tries for almost two hours. But the game is rigged and he has twenty dollars in his pocket. He can’t get Cass the bee. He can’t get him a memento of their time together.
“That they leave us alone.” He stares up at Dean watching his expression carefully. “That they take let me live a human existence and accept us in heaven when we die.”
Maybe things are different between Cass and him and him and Sam. But that doesn’t matter. Cass is still family. And who cares what strangers think? And Sam must have been teasing. Dean knows his friend, and he knows the limits of their bond.
A moment of unending understanding; devoid of judgement and selfishness. With his sweet kiss, Dean lets him know that it’s okay if they don’t go through with this.
Cass’ tongue in his mouth manages to wrench a real moan from him. His eyes fly open in shock, almost shoving Cass aside as a reflex. The angel’s face is relaxed and Dean has to admit his kissing is definitely doing something for him.
Sam walks into Dean’s room to hear shouting and yelling from Dean and a series of high pitched giggles from Cass. Peeking in he sees Cass with his itsy bistey baby arms wrapped around Dean’s hips holding him about two inches off the ground. Both sway, off-kilter around the room. Cass with a grip of iron and Dean trying to latch onto something before he squashes the child
All of them had generally remained in the bunker over the past three months. Sure there were some cases here and there, but nothing that they weren’t used to. A salt and burn in Idaho and a nest of vamps that had been running a strip club were the most interesting things they had come across in a while.
Dean remains frozen in panic as the body pins him to the ground. It isn’t Cass. And … rationally, he knows that. But it might as well be. He’s been gone for
“I don’t know.” Cass says, oblivious to him. “I didn’t look at it long before…” Cass trails off as his eyes rest on the broken pen.
Clenching his jaw, he turns away from the angel and back to the other Dean, casually fishing on the dock. Dean feels almost guilty for interrupting what must be his one moment of peace. The guilt evaporates though, as he sees the sun gleam off a fishing hook. A fishing hook that floats in mid-air.
“This – I shouldn’t be forcing this out of you.” Cass steps away, “Something obviously happened in my absence. Something to do with why you panicked – in the bathroom.”
“I wasn’t looking at you.” he retorts, “I was waiting for you to give me one and a half of those burgers.”
Sam feels his brows raise in surprise. “You did this?” Dean is usually such a good cook. He doesn’t burn stuff – not recently, at least. “What the hell, man?”
The amusement drains from Crowley’s face. “You figured it out sooner than I expected,” he says morosely.
“I learned from the best.” Cass replies causing warmth to bloom in Dean’s chest. Once again he’s reminded that this being, this powerful creature who is older than mountains and oceans, has chosen to model himself after a flannel wearing, pitiful excuse for a human.
“We’ve bonded for over three decades Dean.” Sam snarks. “I think we’re fine. And you and Cass have your ‘more profound bond’ so there’s really no need.”
A scream almost has him ripping the box open. Because it’s undeniable Cass’s fingers that were caught in the box. But he can’t.
It’s terrifyingly easy to insert Cass is an actual lover. Cass seems to have the same problem whether he realises it or not.
Castiel makes the first move, pressing their lips together and stroking along Dean’s tongue with his own.
His eyes darken, feeling the jealousy from earlier rearing its head, “And what did you conclude Dean?”
“This bottle contains fairly little impurities.” He announces, “And the scent is appealing, even to me.”
“Of course I did.” He admits. “That was a turning point in our relationship.” It was when he realised that he was in love with Dean. He’d had an inkling before but he only realised it that day. When Dean was the only one he really wanted help from and the way he’d completely misinterpreted Dean’s ‘last night on earth’ line.
Dean laughs and Castiel feels some of the worry dissipate. Surely if something had gone wrong… if Sam had been injured, Dean would get to the crux of the matter right away. The signal distorts and Castiel presses his ear further into the speaker, “Dean? What’s that sound?”
He sits silently, staring at the mallet in the back seat. Maybe he should destroy the car, like Dean had wanted him to. It had practically been his dying wish, and Castiel knows enough about humans now that he knows that a dying wish should always be fulfilled.
When Cass senses the speed of his approach, he moves to shield the brow bag, no doubt filled with pies.
Recoiling, Cass backs into Michael who rolls his eyes, “You’d think after the first few time you get accustomed.” Cass scowls.
“Adam?” Michael sets them down in a secure location, in a universe with no life at all. The creature following them will have no clue that they’re here.
“Pretty slick, Cass.” He whispers, his hand continuing along its path with a bit more confidence now. His fingers reach the nape of his neck and pause, their first brush against his hair feels spectacular. Soon enough, Dean doesn’t seem content with just his fingertips. His hands thread their way through his hair, running his fingers back and forth, and clenching his hair in surprise when Castiel presses a wet kiss to his neck.
Now that they’re all back at the bunker though, it settles down. They can all retire to their respective hide outs. Dean vows to keep an oath of silence until they figure out how to break the spell and Cass doesn’t seem very talkative either.
Castiel heaves a great sigh, “After all the times I’ve lied to you and Sam… this is probably fitting pay back.”
Maybe Cass just needs a confidence boost, he tells himself. Some training wheels before Dean lets him ride solo.
“I’m collecting the books.” Crowley sasses. “I’m here because I enjoy the accommodation.” He tugs playfully at his chains. “Really top-notch service you boys give here. I brought along Juliette because I thought you’d like her. And I’m not
Without a word, Cass manifests his wings. They span the entire length of the room and their silver and blue feathers practically exude grace. They eyes dance across them not knowing where to focus. The feathers don’t look hard and dry like some of the birds’, but soft and fleecy. He notes the parts where some feathers were singed off in the fall and where the muscles lay exposed, the spots where new feathers had begun filling the gaps. Most of all though, he admired the full sections the majesty of it all… the honour and trust that was placed in him – that Cass would allow a mere human to see and touch his heavenly form.
“Hmm.” Cass strums his fingers on the wheel contemplatively, “What’s that thing the kids say – ah – lmfao Dean.”
“Cass, stop.” Dean’s voice cuts through his panic. His expression has softened considerably. “I’m not throwing you out.” He looks away, mumbling the next part. “Never again.”
Gulping, he watches the door to the garage close gently. He’d disappointed Cass. He’d disappointed himself.
It’s like a cycle with them. They fight. They ignore each other. They find a hunt and blow past whatever started their fight in the first place. In a weird way, it’s Dean’s way of making peace with him. And while he appreciates the effort, he hates that they never get a chance to talk about the real crux of the matter.
“I’m sorry Cass.” Dean gestures to Sam. “Things aren’t looking good. And – and we all know where Winchester’s go when they die.”
“Oh but it’s delicious.” He insists, letting his voice ring out. “Tangy, angel zest. That boy’s been to Hell, Heaven and Purgatory. He tastes like a delicacy of power. You’d be honoured to have a sip.”
Tenderly, he lowers them both to the ground, stroking a hand through Cass’ hair. Cass’ hand is still clutching his own tightly, as though afraid to let go.
He knows that going against his father would be a death sentence for them both. If Adam’s wrath is the price he pays to keep him safe then so be it; it’s a worthy trade in Michael’s eyes. What Adam doesn’t know is that he’s doing this to protect him. Even if Michael can never tell him that in explicit detail, he can’t bear the thought of losing Adam. And he certainly won’t be a part of his death when he had already stolen so much of his life.
Sam’s wrist – it just – spasms. Suddenly his laptop is flying halfway across the hotel room and everyone is staring.
Feeling Dean’s muscles relax, Castiel creates a steady rhythm, slowly inserting and drawing away his finger. When Dean begins to swivel his hips and his fingers thread with Castiel’s atop his cock, begging him to move, Castiel slips his second finger in.
“Sure.” He says. He’s blown all the other rules to hell anyway. It was only a matter of time before this one came crashing down too.
“You are from another universe, right?” she inquires, peering over at them in interest when Dean nods. “And you just want to get home?”
Clenching his jaw, he struggles to remain still. Stabbing Crowley would be the easiest thing in the world. He could step forward and trip over a piece of air, tumbling forward, the hand with his angel blade flailing wildly as he tries to brace. It would be a tragedy, cleaning Crowley’s blood from the floors. But, accidents happen and he can feel the angel blade burning a hole into his coat.
“Whatever.” Dean snaps; he can grill Cass’ to his heart’s content later. Or maybe not. The angel’s love confession has his mind in tatters. How could he not have known? How could Cass have kept this from him? He knows he isn’t the most emotional person in the world, but Cass is one of the few people he’d actually hear out.
“It’s like the baby sitter and the pizza man. Some people are into spanking and others are just into role play.”
Looking up, Castiel examines his face, searching for any traces of a lie. ‘Then why did you make me leave?’ but the question never sees the light of day.
Sam is about to blurt everything out, when he suddenly has a much better idea. They still have no idea what Cass’ wish was in the first place. They still have no idea why Dean reacted like that to Cass’ affection.  “What’s the last thing you remember.”
With Crowley – he’d hurt Sam and Dean still forgave him. He literally left them to clean up his mess and Dean forgave him. He worked with Sam behind his back and they got Charlie killed and Dean forgave him. He chose Kelly over then and Dean forgave him. He died like an idiot and when he got back he kept secrets again and Dean forgave him. He didn’t let him know that Jack wasn’t all there and then his mother died because of that and Dean would have forgave him. But then he check out first chance he got and Dean realised… Cass keeps leaving. And Dean keeps forgiving him.
“What do you want, Crowley?” he demands. There must be some reason for him showing himself, revealing his plan so soon. Castiel will do anything to help him if it means keeping him away from Dean.
Castiel hums to himself as he packs the kitchen. Absentmindedly he scrubs at the pie pan. Dean ate two thirds. All Castiel can think about are the expressions on Dean’s face as he ate and the myriad of appreciative noises that Castiel would never tire of hearing.
“I’m telling you he doesn’t.” Crowley insists, cutting off any protests. “Now, you two may think that facing the devil is going to be a walk in the park, but some of us have a real stake here. Things we want… things we can lose. So we can’t afford your drama with him screwing us.”
But given the way Dean clings to him, his hands scrunched in his shirt, the way he shakes in Sam’s grasp… it’s impossible for him to miss the truth.
That couldn’t have been easy and Dean knew just how bad Sam was messed up. With Cass, it wasn’t 180 years, granted but who was he to judge… he’d broken after only thirty.
But he’s too tired, and honestly, he doesn’t want to know some of the answers. They can only bring him pain.
“Thanks for telling me.” Sam winces as the words come out of his mouth. He just doesn’t want to make Cass feel bad. “And your wish?”
“What?” Sam says in disbelief. “I thought you came here to – to get with Dean. What happened to Dean… writhing… and – ugh.”
Gently, Castiel coats his finger, pressing against Dean’s opening. He sees Dean’s pulse hammer in his throat and his watches the movement of Castiel’s hand.
Had he done that? Made those noises. The things he’d done in the heat of passion now shrink back at the first sight of common sense.
“Cass this isn’t anything to feel embarrassed about.” Dean says gently, “Besides, if you went at it with those scissors you’d just make it scar.” Dean holds a finger up, like he’s giving a lecture, “The key to this pimply problem is to not touch it. Don’t irritate it and it’ll go away.”
And Dean takes advantage of the luxury as much as he can. He lets himself moan a little louder than normal, not having to worry about Sam hearing him from across the room, or through a thin bathroom wall.
Their relationship hadn’t started happily. He’d been against Sam, but getting to know him –both through Dean and his own ‘looking in’ on the brothers– showed him that Sam has many sides. They’ve grown especially close in the past few years, they share things other than their love for Dean. They both enjoy research and helping people. The countless hours they’d spent together in the library, pouring through lore and research, were happy memories.
Then why is he so willing to do this? Dean knows love. With Cassie and Lisa. But he also knows brotherhood, with Sam and friendship with Lee. Cass is none of those things - not really.
Does that sound like a date question? Yes. Yes, it does. But Dean’s decided to stop caring. If he has to treat this like a bona-fied date to convince Cass that he means something to them, then so be it.
cheesy, but she’s honoured to be having this version of the walk with one of her boys, even if it’s about thirty years late.
He’d begged her not to say anything back at the bunker. She only just realises that it’s because thinks Dean doesn’t love him back. Not the way he wants any way. Mary is sure that Dean does love him back, but he’s confusing his emotions. Castiel is scared of what will happen if Dean finds out, and here she is shoving everything in his face.
He stumbles through his words, “I mean… do you f-feel the same. As me. About me. Us. Our bond. You know… mumbo jumbo.”
When they break apart Castiel finds himself panting and a short glance at Dean tells him that he’s also having a hard time controlling his breathing.
Grasping at straws, Castiel blurts the first thing that comes to mind, in an attempt to fix things, to stop Dean from spiraling “They’re real! What we have is real. I know it.”
Cass may not have feelings for him, but something is still bothering him and now Dean knows better than to let that kind of hurt fester.
plan.” he whispers bitterly. It haunts him… had he made the wrong choice? Being selfish like that? One life for many… and he knows Cass would easily make the sacrifice. The problem is Dean. The problem is always Dean.
“So good.” He moans as Cass continues his licking. He moves up and down, making Dean’s head swirl with pleasure. His tongue does all the right things making him shiver deliciously. His actually terrified of blowing his load too soon.
He knows that Crowley should be back yet. But Castiel had been expecting some sort of deceit from the demon and had prepared himself.
Turning his mind away from such morbid thoughts, he turns instead to Dean, the love of his life. Castiel takes solace in the fact that they spent their lives together, and they’ll spend their afterlives together in the same way.
The ‘we have guns and we’ll find you’ approach doesn’t work well when you’re dealing with your creator.
"I've contacted the Michael of this world." Michael announces. "Dean will be here shortly and for three of the seven days in a week."
A few seconds later and Dean is as spritely as ever. Like he just chugged a gallon of coffee or a Monster.
But Cass doesn’t even try to lick the batter until Dean offers him the lump on his finger. Cass licks it off and beams at Dean, nodding. “Yummy.”
But what are they going to do? Kiss? More? Dean doesn’t know if he’s ready for more. And if he’s being honest with himself, he enjoys kissing Cass. It’s actually kind of calming; being with a friend.
He rifles around in Dean’s duffle absentmindedly picking out the clothes. It doesn’t matter what he wears anyway; it’s only Dean and him. Castiel is still blissfully tucked in the shine of Dean’s eyes as he explored all the rooms. The fact that Dean had
“But I won’t.” He can’t stop the jubilant smile that forms on his face. “I won’t suffer because I’m happy.”
“Dean,” he announces, no longer comfortable in the stillness and silence, “I don’t like this position very much.”
Their final moments are upon them. They’ve played their final card and Chuck is announcing curtain call. But Dean still has a few seconds left. A few seconds to right the only wrong he’s ever truly regretted.
His eyes gleam with sincerity and enthusiasm, the likes of which he hasn’t seen in a while. “Thank you Cass.”
He can’t believe that he almost told Cass about – the thing he said he would never think of again. The poor guy is probably sitting there, beyond confused, thinking that Dean is in love with him. It could ruin this new equilibrium that they have.
Dean seems to share his sentiment; wanting to preserve the mood, he shushes Castiel. “You don’t have to say anything right now Cass.”
“So… what you’re saying… is that I need to build up a tolerance… to pleasure.” Cass says slowly. Dean doesn’t even have a chance to reply before he picks up the pace, belting out his next sentence like a round of bullets from an automatic. “Okay. Great. This is perfect. You can help me build up my tolerance. Three times a day should be enough. Or should we start with ten? I don’t know. We can figure this out tomorrow. I can’t believe how great this ‘after glow’ is.”
He looks over to Sam and Dean, hoping to get some clarification. All he sees is panic on their faces.
“Oh but Crowley.” He purrs, rolling the ‘r’ “There’s not enough time in the world for our entire story.”
“Oh my God!” he moans past the food in his mouth. Believe it or not, Cass brought them mini-burgers as appetisers. “I love this. You’re like the best cook ever!”
But, his eyes narrow as he approaches the pie shack, it seems as though someone has already beaten him to it.
Something else caught his eye… just before the beet actually. A small book. It was so inconspicuous that he would have missed it, had it coat not got caught on its spine. It fell with a loud clatter and the store clerk winced on his behalf.
“Because I wanted to know what it feels like.” Cass whispers. “To have someone think that you’re in a relationship. I’m so sorry Dean. I understand that you’re angry that I broke your trust and betrayed you. I – I’m just sorry.”
He’s figured out a while ago; that Cass had taken to hanging out in there so that he’d see Dean whenever he popped in for beer or snacks. Common sense had struck at some point, and he’d taken to leaving small caches of food in his room, to stop the constant trips. But then, he realized that he’d been seeing Cass less and less, so he ditched that habit and swung by the kitchen as much as possible. Sometimes, he even haggled Cass into movie night, and they both pretended that it was a chore; Dean to convince him to come and Cass to actually watch the movie.
“Cass…” he says slowly, hardly daring to look him in the eye. “This… this isn’t what I – this isn’t how it looks okay?”
Sounds of pleasure spill from his lips as his hand moves faster and faster. He feels himself getting closer and closer but he can’t seem to send himself over the edge. He moves his hands faster, wincing as it almost
It’s not that he’s not happy to see Dean – that he’s alive and generally ok. But he can’t help but think back to their last interaction. Their fight, after which Dean had abandoned him completely. Maybe if Dean had come to look for him, he would have noticed the imposter right away.
The spaces between words have been punctuated by kisses and soft touches. Just knowing they were in each other’s presence had been enough.
Dean watches him out of the corner of his eye. He’s lying next to Castiel in an all too familiar position. He has to remind himself again and again that Dean is real… he won’t leave him; at least it seems that he doesn’t want to leave him. That’s enough for him.
Sure, he would have to be blind and then some to miss the smouldering looks, soft touches and general tempering in Dean’s presence. He couldn’t imagine their bond becoming any more profound. Dean knew too. His brother was too versed in the art of the chase to not recognise such a blatant attempt at flirting. Sam is sure that Dean doesn’t reciprocate though. Completely disregarding the fact that his brother had only ever been with women and his massive porn collection, Dean had explicitly stated his disinterest in all matters angel-sex.
There was obviously no case and no need for the guise of investigation but that only meant that he would be trapped here with Dean. Dean whose soul is just as beautiful as his face. As an angel he was never insecure or unsure of himself. Now though, as a human, everything feels out to get him. Which is ironic because the last time he was human he’d been homeless, tricked into having sex and then murdered; now he is in a nice cottage with the human he loves more than anything, so he has no real reason to feel the way he does. Except last time he’d felt some drive, some urgency to retrieve his grace and redeem himself. Now he’s barely spared two thoughts to his grace. At the moment, though, it
Dean shakes his head once more, a slight tremble passing through his muscles. “I can’t imagine how, Cass.” He mutters, “I don’t feel comfortable.”
“When I think of happiness I think of you too Dean.” His voice is rough, with shock… with joy. That Dean would forgive him… need him again.
The lines had been exploded into a bajillion pieces. Cass hadn’t seemed to realise the significance of what they’d done. He talked to Dean normally when they met in the washing area. He doesn’t understand these things. Boundaries and traditions escape his understanding.
“You have to do something.” Dean says urgently. “Get Billie and tell her Chuck is whipping up a storm in there. Sam could be dead and her plan to stop Chuck won’t ever happen.”
“I want you too.” Dean pecks his lips quickly and works his way downward, stopping right above his pants.
Dean bolts, he makes a dash to the coat rack and flings the door open, completely prepared to march out and save Cass.
Dean’s room hasn’t been completely silent for a long while. Now that it is… he feels hollow. Like the light from his life had just been sucked out.
Castiel wonders how best to answer. Afraid because this could still be another simulation. Panicked because he remembers just what got him here. Or scared of how Dean will react… real Dean, because that’s what this Dean is. He’s never been more sure of it as he stares into his green eyes. Another thing his captor hadn’t been able to get right was the way Dean’s eyes got when they looked at him.
When Dean presses firmly against his prostate and swallows his erection, hollowing his cheeks and humming quietly Castiel loses it. Blinding pleasure rips any other thoughts from his mind. He screams like a banshee, his hands holding Dean’s head in place as he sucks him through the orgasm. His hips thrust automatically and his back arches as his body writhes, the lights flicker and he feels as though his grace might explode through his vessel, but Dean holds him throughout, stroking comforting lines on his thighs.
Things aren’t weird. Baby is a bubble. Nothing that went on … in there… could ever be possible in the real world.
“I think both of you are wrong.” Sam says suddenly, causing Dean to look at him weirdly. “We’re all family here. When we get mad at each other, we don’t just … run off. And Dean, we try to forgive. We’ve all made mistakes. We should all be supportive. Be here. When one of us is mad, Cass, that doesn’t mean that you’re not welcome. When we’re mad, we might want a little space to cool off, but we never want you to leave. Right, Dean?”
“I don’t have as much experience as you do with intimacy.” He states. “The one encounter I had… was fatal. I -” He glances away then and if Dean is seeing correctly, the angel is blushing. “It’s nothing. You- you just went through an ordeal and you don’t need me bothering you.”
Reaching over the table, Dean places a fork in his hand. Their fingers brush for one tantalizing moment. Dean’s expression falters and Castiel thinks that maybe he felt it too.
He hates this waiting. The suspense is about to kill him. A clear cut answer had been all that he wanted – all that he expected. Why couldn’t Cass just put him out of his misery.
“How could you!” he shrieks, feeling tears of shame gather in his eyes followed by the shame of his tears creating a sickening feedback loop of leaky eyes.
The angel nods. “You could barely stand. I’m not leaving your side until you can prove to me otherwise.”
To his surprise though, Sam just laughs. “Dude. Be real. If you want to know something about porn or sex you’re better off asking me.” he turns to Dean then. “You probably traumatised him with that! What were you thinking?”
Flat on his back, now, Dean’s face buried in his neck, hands tight around his throbbing member. One of his hands remains tangled in the sheets and the other threaded in Dean’s hair. He’s helpless to do anything but moan against the relentless pleasure.
“Look.” Gabriel waves the girls away and turns to face Crowley with a cocky grin that looks too fake. “Thanks for the rescue and all. But if it’s all the same to you, I’d rather get back to my welcome home party.”
“I was going to call you.” he insists. “When I was sure that I was so far away, you couldn’t catch me in time.”
He loses his balance when Dean unexpectedly launches himself at him, pitching him back into a shelf. The rattle it makes, echoes loudly.
Dean’s words resonate within him. It’s not their usual promise… it’s something more profound. It easies Castiel’s nerves. It reminds him that Dean will be waiting for him in heaven when all is said and done. For the first time that day he relaxes, letting his body sink into their memory foam mattress.
Honestly, he doesn’t see the appeal in watching Dean stir cake batter. Sure, he also remembers watching Dean when he was a kid. Amazed that dad trusted his big brother to do so much. But he can’t remember ever watching Dean so attentively – so raptly – like there was nothing more engrossing. Sam mostly stuck around to sneak a taste of some of the batter, or help Dean break the eggs. He grins, remembering just how much cracking an egg seemed to amuse him as a kid.
Another sob bursts forth. Dean presses his fist into his mouth and turns his face away. In such a confined space, it’s about the same as flying into another galaxy. Except Cass can still hear him.
It’s gold and shaped like an elongated tea-pot, it’s value is evident, despite the object being covered in dirt. Looking closer, he can detect some writing near the base.
Damp lips press against his neck and Castiel shivers as Dean slowly sticks his tongue out moving it in tiny circles. His eyes shoot open and he finally catches himself enough to yank out of Dean’s arms.
Dean scoffs, “That’s ridiculous. Of course he knows that.” ‘That’ being that Dean isn’t in love with him.
Dean presses on, “She knew that you loved me and eventually, that I loved you back.” He intertwines their fingers; because he
have. The realization hits him hard.  Mary had been right about Dean’s emotions towards him all along. He doesn't know how he feels about it now, just that his mind has been plunged into chaos. Everything that brought them closer came from the books. This is just as much his fault as it is Dean’s. At least they’re opening up now. They can work through this together. Now that he knows, Castiel can assure him he appreciates the effort Dean put in to make him comfortable.  But first, Castiel needs to catch Dean up to speed.
Smiling softly, Dean stills his hand by gripping his wrist lightly. His tongue snakes out, swiping the last bit of excess honey from his fingertip. Castiel stands frozen; trapped in uncertainty. What if Dean was just teasing him? He hadn’t forgotten what Dean had witnessed in the bathroom either. Things were getting confusing again. Lines all jumbled together.
“I’m sorry.” He blurts, looking over to Dee. “I just – I never meant to deceive you, Dee – it – you were only attracted to
In a flash, Lucifer flies them back into the bunker, into Dean’s room. Sam wants to believe that this is all a hallucination, but the smell of burning leather stays with him, reminds him of just how royally he’s screwed up.
“I love you.” he says firmly. Then presses a kiss to Cass’ lips. It’s nothing like he’s ever imagined. It’s horrible. He can’t bear to enjoy a second of it. His skin prickles and his tongue tastes like acid. He wants to rip himself away.
“Okay.” Dean replies, but even though his voice is disembodied, Castiel knows that he doesn’t really mean it. “But just so you know, you don’t have to feel bad about this. It isn’t on you. They clearly … concocted some sort of elaborate trick. And we don’t even know why.”
Castiel swallows. He hadn’t expected such a simple answer from Dean. He expected at least some doubt about their feelings or their compatibility. Dean sounds sure now, surer than when they had last spoken.
“Woah.” He backs away, “Y-yes.” Sure the pie tastes good, but he’d be scared to say no even if it tasted like shit.
He shuts the stove off and turns to face a contrite Cass. “I  still expect you to eat that.” He says.
Kissing him, he’d surely felt something. Mostly confusion. But he’s old enough to understand that relationships aren’t just based on the physical. They connect. He feels like he can talk to Cass about his feelings – albeit not his emotions and feelings
fun though. Like I said, most I’ve laughed in years. And after… you plan… sitting in silence. That – that wasn’t actually half-bad.”
“What? Cass grow a tail or something?” Dean ask tactlessly, bending backward to peer over at his rear.
He glances over, wincing as he sees Cass’ disappointed face. “Why don’t we take a break before you spend all your money.”
“Yeah.” He agrees, rubbing at his eyes. The gang is getting together tomorrow to discuss strategy. He suspects that he’ll need all of  his energy for that one. “Night Cass.”
He swallows against his nerves as the door clicks shut. The words turn to ask in his mouth and suddenly, even looking at Cass is hard.
I know it's been a while, but I hope you liked it! I have the rest of this mostly planned out so updates should be more frequent *fingers crossed*
Before, when he just thought that they kept him around for the heck of it, he’d been stingy with his opinions, not wanting to be put more at odds with Dean than he already was. Now though, things could be more open between them from here on out.
As Crowley takes Aziraphale outside to comfort him, Anathema invites them to sit and promptly returns with two cups of tea.
Inside the convention are more people than Castiel had anticipated. He attributes it to the Winchesters’ personality. Anyone would be drawn to their light. He certainly had been.
Castiel watches through blurred vision as the Winchesters leave the room. How could he be so stupid? In all his bliss, he forgot about the book. He should have incinerated it the moment Dean said yes to being with him.
He rubs his knee, “Nah.” He tries for nonchalance, “Says he’s still got a few good years. Then he’ll be like Bobby… running the phones and research from the bunker.”
He hasn’t moved in hundreds of thousands of years. Even if exercise had been a priority while they were down under he’s pretty sure that neither he nor Cass would have bothered. He feels dazed, like a fish out of water as he flops around on the… concrete floor?
He doesn’t clench his jaw as much. Moans spill past his lips with increased frequency. His hand grips onto Cass free one, using it to anchor himself and now drown in the sensations.
“So, I hear you and Dean are sharing porn now.” He says with forced casualness. “Leme guess, you’re not supposed to talk about it.”
Maybe he should talk to Dean. Hint at the topic, after all, he’d been about to say something important back at that fountain.
He can’t remember the last time he heard to Dean taking anyone home. Sure, he still flirts relentlessly, but he doesn’t make it past groping in an alley.
Dean licks at his dry lips, chancing a glance at Cass who seems to have just deflated. Dean can see the worry on his face, the panic. He can’t actually believe this crap can he? Dean wonders though, looking at his face once more. He’s never seen the angel more perturbed.
“I’m doing some research on truth spells, trying to figure out which one you guys got hit with. Maybe we can find a way to reverse it then.”
Dean lies sprawled out on his bed. His mind of completely fogged over. The ceiling looks like cotton candy and lollipops – like that Katy Perry video.
These wings carried him out of the pit. His fingers itch to thread through the soft feathers. He wanted things to be normal again. He wanted to prevent Cass’ pain.
“Nothing’s up.” He says, keeping his voice smooth and unbothered. “Maybe he needed somethin’ and I was dead asleep so I couldn’t hear his knocking.”
“Your room?” he raises a brow with interest. “Last time I came here, this room was very clearly occupied by two people.”
The child grabs hold of his finger, yanking with a force a three year old couldn’t possibly have. “Stay.” He begs, popping Dean’s finger into his mouth and sucking gently.
But Dean is still holding his hand. He’s holding it so tightly that the tremble isn’t even noticeable anymore.
“No.” he assures, trying to scrupulously peek into the room, “Nothing’s wrong. I just wanted to check up on you.” Cass says nothing and Dean feels like an annoyance, “You were acting strange at dinner.”
“I trust you as well Dean.” He says hollowly. “I’m glad you told me. I never want you to do something that makes you uncomfortable, Dean, you mean too much to me.”
“Maybe we should practice making some healthy dishes.” He suggests, “So that when Sam gets here he’ll have something to eat.”
“This morning you sucked me off in bed!” one says, just as the other retorts with, “This morning I called you creepy.”
Castiel keeps telling myself it might be nothing. But the look in Dean’s eyes as he came apart under him…
Dean turns to find Crowley and Aziraphale observing them like some sort of bacteria in a microscope. The level of concentration coming from them is unnerving.
what Cass reads aloud, nodding along contemplatively and listening raptly. If he can believe this so easily, then he doesn’t know Dean at all. Which is a huge relief.
She looks at the scene on the porch and stops in her tracks, her eyes darting between the two Deans. “Babe, let me sort this out okay?”
“Oh.” Dean says in realisation, “Trust me, it’s better when you see it spoiler free.” But in his mind he’s trying to remember if he left any of his porn out. It’d been a few days. Mom finding his stash is probably the last thing she needs to help her adjust to this whole having two grown ass sons jam.
It’s unbelievably good. Somehow the angel has no gag reflex and doesn’t even graze him once with his teeth.
“You won’t.” He assures. “Truthfully, my feelings about you… they’ve also become…” he tries to find the most fitting word; one that won’t reveal everything, but won’t be a bald faced lie either. “… blurred.” He decides on.
Dean’s fingers move without his consent. They massage and caress a path along both wings, noting the spots that cause Cass to buck up into him.
“Are you – is this like what you told me in that motel? After purgatory? That you’d… off yourself?” Castiel smiles gently at Dean’s attempt at communication. His confusion is preferable to any – other emotions.
The look Dean gives him is one of a man who has had enough. “Just a little longer, Dean.” He assures.
How can he tell if their little outing meant anything to Cass? His first thought is the little box of memento’s Cass has hidden away. But Dean hadn’t managed to win that cute plush toy… but the Ferris wheel…
Dean chuckles at his own joke. He immediately second guesses himself though. After the wake-up call that came to him as a wet dream, Dean is particularly careful about what he says and does around Cass. He can’t let himself get into the mentality that this is a date. First of all, it’d be straight up wrong. And second? Cass is his best friend. He can’t let himself let confused like this. Even to make Cass happy. It just can’t happen.
Castiel feels the blade twisting and twisting and he struggles to maintain composure. “If you don’t react to males … then why did you enjoy my kissing?”
At the moment, Castiel wouldn’t mind. Dean seems dead set on going in and pretending to be ‘Dean and Cass bumping uglies.’ That situation would make it all too easy to give something away. He prefers to go with Sam on this one.
Dean manages to sit still as Cass makes his way out of the room. But as the door clicks shut he flings himself over to the other side of him bed and fumbles with his phone.
Things continued piling up on them until they find a rhythm to talk  at all. Dean isn’t about to let that happen again.
Two more chapters till the end!!! It's taken a while but we're almost there. Hope you like what I have planned... :D
Impassive, Dean just glances towards the exit. Of all the reactions Sam had expected this one never even made the list.
“Well, it doesn’t matter.” He announces, shutting off the engine. “This is a dictatorship. C’mon Cass.”
When Dean pulls into the Carnival parking lot he finds himself doubting the entire idea. There are tons of people here. It’s the middle of the week, so it isn’t as packed as it would be on a weekend, but somehow it’s still more crowded than he’d like.
“You two – you click. Nowadays, you don’t find that very often. It’s not something you want to pass up easily.”
Instead, he turns to investigate. The pot on the stove is still boiling. In fact, the water has almost evaporated. With a sigh, Sam turns off the burner and shakes his head. He peeks inside the pot at the sorry piece of food that Cass decided to mutilate.
Castiel tries to figure out where it all went wrong. Because it had. Terribly wrong. Irrevocably wrong. He pulls at his hair, biting his lip to concentrate. He’s determined to do this thing. This one thing, he can do it.
“No nothing can come between you and I.” he continues with a straight face. “Here’s your iced beverage.”
“It’s lube.” He says. “It makes it easier. Just rub it up and down the length and let’s see how that feels.”
“Of course,” Crowley says, “I’ve been searching far and wide for dear Moose’s book. No luck.” He nods at Castiel. “Good thing I got my dog to sniff all the icky places that I didn’t want to.”
“Do you think that I– that I do things that make it seem like I’m in love with him?” Dean ignores his question completely.
“You’re an angel.” Jack Frost look-a-like says, practically flitting over to Cass side. “I’m honestly surprised that you haven’t tried to kill me yet. I’m a – what do you say – persona non grata in heaven.”
Despite how cute and jovial the angel now is… he finds himself selfishly missing his friend. He misses talking with him and having his shoulder to lean on.
“Fine. Cliff notes.” He huffs. “My dumbass brother touched the pearl, turned into a child along with Cass, played with lube in your room. The pearl started heating up again. Cass turned invisible and you were convinced that he was your imaginary friend and voila! I smashed the pearl and here we all are, waiting for Cass to explain what his wish was.”
“With all those magical angel powers, can’t you just…” he makes a pshew sound and mimics an explosion.
“I miss the grass.” Whimpers Cass. “Most of my time was spent looking. At the earth… since the beginning. Thousands of species were created and have died but grass was always a constant. It’s always green it’s always rich. I wonder if humans have managed to destroy such a resilient lifeform. I miss the bees and I miss heaven.”
“I just want to talk… and– and it’s not going to be a great talk.” Dean whispers. “But there are things that need to be said and at least we’ll have some privacy in Baby.”
After a late night out, Dean remembers walking down the stairs, drunk off his ass. In the darkness he almost broke his neck while tripping over his sleeping brother. They literally have hundreds of chairs for Sam to sit on. And if chairs aren’t his fancy, there’s always counters, and table-tops and… the floor.
The glove box clicks open and everything inside comes tumbling out. The tissues, old ID’s, and something larger… a book.
Cass is silent. Watching Dean as he finishes off his slice of pie. They stare at each other a moment, Dean, almost too angry to even bother asking for Cass’ share. Sighing, Cass pushes the plate over and leaves his fingers on the edge, as though waiting to pull away at a moment’s notice.
Castiel wants nothing more than to curl up and be dead to the world. But since angels can’t sleep, he settles for dimming the lights in his room and staring blankly at the wall… like a form of meditation.
Castiel scowls, kicking up the dirt as he marches away from the stupid cottage. Michael is waiting for him by a little table and bench a few feet away. He smirks, in amusement as Castiel sits by his side.
Cass’ lips are on his own in an instant, pressing against them in a way that has his lips opening up to accept Cass’ tongue. Sagging into their embrace, Cass lets Dean take control, knowing that he’s confident in this skill after all the times they’ve kissed before.
When they’re almost to their motel Sam leans over to Cass who stares out the window listlessly. It’s honestly the most at peace he’s ever seen him. Sam almost doesn’t want to ruin it, but, as always, curiosity gets the better of him.
And he can finally do so in peace. There will be no new monster. There will be no new threat. There will be no more hurt and despair for the Winchesters.
“Dean, keeping him locked here isn’t doing any good.” He keeps his voice even and sincere, “He takes up all your time and energy and we haven’t properly searched in over two days. We still have no idea whether the wish needs to be complete by a certain time, we have no idea what the wish was and we certainly have no clue as to the whereabouts of the pearl.”
Dean slides down the hall in his slippers falling on his ass just before he hits the wall and the phone beside it.
“Of course, I do,” Cass stresses. “But I’m tired of this. Being used, constantly worrying if you’re going to send me off to die like a good little soldier. I can stand a lot of things… but my choices will always be my own.”
“Hey, don’t beat yourself up over this okay.” Dean assures, “I –well, I got tricked by a siren once too and I never saw it coming. If Bobby hadn’t shown up when he did, Sam and I would have killed each other.”
He wants to speak. Force some words from his lips to finally end this ordeal. But his tongue is pinned to the roof of his mouth and he struggles to even get a breath out.
“Dude!” Dean slams the door shut. “What were you thinking?” he demands, tugging at the collar of Cass’ trench coat.
come here to sabotage them,” Sam growls stepping out from behind the corner. There was never a doubt in his mind. Maybe if they can get it through Crowley’s head that Dean isn’t interested, he’ll back-off.
The next comes at just the right time. He admits to Dean that he wants to kill himself and Dean – Dean just scowls at him, saying it’ll save me some time.
“Because I have to set certain things right, so that I can stay with you for a lifetime and more.” Cass doesn’t sound happy about it.
He carefully rests the bag on the table, slicing open the small piece of rope that holds it together. It’s larger than the usual hex bags… about three times the usual size. The first thing his eyes zero is the bone. The exact same one from the duffle. Dean’s duffle.
“This place is mine.” He blurts. Dean had wondered how long he would get away with his home decorating spree. “Like, the deed is on my name.”
“You have to understand how hard it is for him.” Sam continues. “The only reason he told me was to save you both.”
Crowley gives a mock gasp, pressing his hands to his chest dramatically, “I’ll have you know I’m a treasure to the ladies… the guys too.” Wink.
“I need to do this Dean.” Cass says quietly. “I promise that I will explain everything when I get back.”
“Why haven’t you said anything?” Sam can’t help but pry. “It’s obvious that your feelings are real and that they’ve been around for some time.”
Worst yet, he can’t remember the words. The words he had made Dean repeat so many times, never thinking that it would actually be
“I am no longer accepted by our brethren either.” Castiel says, his voice tells Dean that he’s already entranced.
No. Dean doesn’t need rest. He’s been in that box for years. No. He remembers, his earlier anger crashes into him like a tsunami.
It seems that Dean finds himself unable to walk in silence. “And you,” He says brightly, elbowing Sam harsher than necessary. “you’re now anti-research, think you can pull that off Einstein?”
Castiel’s eyes crinkle in amusement. Though she doesn’t bother commenting. Her cheeky grin is enough to make Dee flush. They banter, back and forth like an old married couple. Dean would never guess that they’ve only known each other a few measly months or that one of them in an incorporeal ball of smoke.
Rolling his shoulders, he stretches, noting how relaxed his muscles still are from the massage and oils. The level of relaxation that Cass could induce was almost catatonic.
The only time he remembers feeling longing was at Garth’s house. He remembers the laughing gas and how it made him hallucinate. But the thing is, he’d had that exact dream before.
“Right. Whatever.” He waves his brother away. He half wonders if mom wants anything but he doesn’t think either him or Dean would be comfortable enough to bother her in the shower.
Dean squeezes his eyes together even more tightly. How he can still hear those words past the blood rushing through his ears is unbeknownst to him.
Dean gulps, trying to push down his rising fear. Cass catches on this time and breaks character, stroking his cheek. “Baby is a safe space, remember? Nothing we do in here has any standing out there.”
Narrowing his eyes, Chuck takes a step closer. “Maybe not yesterday.” He says menacingly. “But today is a new day. The last day, in fact… for some of us.”
The evidence has been there time and time again. But his mind refuses to accept it. Dean doesn’t really need him. Dean isn’t nice to him… he doesn’t really care. Castiel could die bloody right here and now and the Winchesters would move on. Sam… well Sam is a people person and a loyal man. Whereas Dean is straight about what he feels, he has known Sam to push his feelings aside… suck it up and work with whatever monster they need at the time.
He’s withdrawn from them completely and any attempt by either Sam or himself has led to flat out refusal. Dean can only assume that he’s still mad about their… incident. But whenever he tries to have a conversation, Cass brushes him off. He can barely stand Dean’s presence for more than a few seconds and seems to drift off into space sometimes.
“No!” Dean feels like he should stomp his foot for good measure. This is like when he thought Cassie was Cass that first time – except worse. “Are – you’re saying that you and your Dean are together?”
Tapping his chin, Cass actually seems to consider that. “It’s because of the way your soul reacts when you lie to me.”
Common sense kicks in and he presses his ear to Cass chest. His heartbeat thunders loud and strong in Dean’s ears.
Cass has his arms pinned securely above his head and he continues to pummel his lips. Realising that he’s not kissing back, Dean forces his lips to move, not wanting to make this more awkward for Cass. If the angel wanted to indulge himself a bit, Dean wouldn’t stop him. Besides, this kissing felt different to the usual sloppy ones where his back was pressed to the wall or he was drunk out of his wits. This felt… safe, maybe even caring.
He can’t listen to Dean make light of this – of them – of something that should change everything, but he knew would only be forgotten.
That’s when the beet came in. Bright red and popping from the page. Castiel remembers picking it up to inspect it and reading:
Dean is up and about for most of the day and at night, when he finally allows himself to rest Castiel finds him sprawled across the entire bed. It had hurt, knowing that he was no longer welcome in Dean’s bed, but Gabriel had prompted him to talk to Dean.
“Yeah.” But it sounds like he’s only saying it for Sam’s benefit. “You have to promise that you won’t tell Cass.”
For the umpteenth time, Sam thinks that this whole process would be that much easier if he could actually see Cass.
“So if I stop you from having fun… you’ll laugh about it?” Cass sounds sceptical and his facial expression would be funny, except Dean can tell he’s really worried about somehow messing this up.
, Dean’s body stops shuddering and his breath gusts out in shallow pants. It takes everything Sam has, to swallow his questions and not demand answers immediately.
Trembling violently, the angel doesn’t even turn to look at him. Dean feels his nerves increase for the first time in a long time. Tentatively, he pokes Cass’ shoulder. “Buddy?”
At first, Castiel is too wrapped up in his own head to realize where they’re going. But once the garage comes into view, he stills, causing Dean to tug at his arm.
Castiel stares at naked Dean, unable to tear his eyes away. Dean for the most part doesn’t even seem to notice. His main concern is running his hands all over his body as though checking to see if all the parts are there.
Sam ducks his head and Jody pats his shoulder. “No offence.” She says. “But you can count on my help.”
“You were too good for my training apparently. Found the damn hex bag and all.” he mutters. Words become harder and harder as Cass’ fingers linger, but he doesn’t have the will to shrug them off; not right now.
A biting: ‘no,’ is on the tip of his tongue, before he remembers the guard is still right there. He keeps his mouth shut. But that seems to be enough for her. She screams again running down the halls, chanting “Destiel is canon.” Dean almost hides his face in shame, but he notices some of the people chant along with her.
“Cass…” Dean’s voice trails off and he glances around hesitantly. “You… say you don’t feel like you can stay.” He swallows, but Castiel can tell there’s no pie in his mouth. “In the bunker. Why?”
Impatient, Castiel starts unbuttoning Dean’s shirt, shoving it off when Dean moves his hands from Castiel’s nipples.
It’s been a while since he’s had someone he could just kiss for the hell of it. He has to agree with Cass; kissing is a different kind of closer than sex. Dean thought he already knew that… but kissing’s never felt like this.
Dean yanks his hand away and Castiel sees him glancing at the floor sadly. “Sorry I’m screwing this up for you.”
“Okay.” He breathes, “We’ve got it all out in the open.” He moves his hand and it gravitates towards Castiel’s shoulder; the friendly pat that had always done wonders for him, but pulls back at the last second. “So what you’re saying is… you can be happy… to an extent. He won’t take you as long as you don’t forget.”
The other Sam’s eyes widen as he spots them but he doesn’t move for the gun that rests a mere foot away. “Time travel?” he wonders.
“What?” Dean blusters, trying to stop the flush from creeping up his neck. “Of course I have.” Sam’s eyes widen.
He thinks back to the play, to afterward with Mary and his vehement denial of having any feelings towards Castiel at all.
With bleary eyes he tries to focus on something. To find Dean. His hands scrape against the dirty floor, trying to find purchase on something. His mind is functioning clearly, despite his body’s malfunctions. Castiel knows that it’s the after-effects of Lucifer’s simulation.
Sam looks up from his coffee to stare at Dean who’s clearly expecting some sort of answer. Probably blind acceptance.
Dean glares at the demon who against all odds has stuck with him on his quest to find Cass. Even when Sam had wanted to give up, Crowley had stood there and bitched until his brother saw sense.
“I’m going to… gouge my eyes out… fall onto an angel blade… maybe even sell myself to the devil.” He mutters, “Please don’t carry on in my absence. Mother,” he gives her a poined look, “I expect you to take a vow of chastity after my death. Fifty years or so would do.”
Dean had realised though. They weren’t real. It was then that Castiel realised that he had to leave.
Dean wakes up with a groan. He can’t remember the last time he slept that soundly, but somehow he’s still tired. Baby purrs as though greeting him. Cracking his eyes open he finds Cass with both hands on the wheel and focused on the road.
“Kinda.” Murmurs Cass. “But I missed you. I want to feel close to you… and no.” he interrupts when Dean moves to open his mouth. “Cuddling won’t cut it.”
Cass had engraved them into his vocal chords for all eternity. To have a way out and never be able to use it is torture.
Not five seconds later he hears Dean groan. Should he have offered to take a shift with Cass? It seemed useless at the time because all he does in Sam’s company is cry until Dean comes to rescue him. He turns on his heel and heads back to Dean’s room.
Their bodies pressed flush together, their hands wandering. Their lips, pressing together feverishly.
Then his finger brushes a jagged edge; sparking pain. He yanks his finger back he pushes it in his mouth hoping that he hadn’t stained Dean’s clothes. The object didn’t feel like any knife he’d ever seen. It was unbelievably hard. Thick…
Sam steps in carefully. “I’m not here to lecture you Dean. You’re entitled to how you feel right now. I just wanted to see how you were doing. If you need anything.”
What other reason could he have for making their first few sessions all about Cass? It was a culmination of all the stuff Cass said before, nothing else to it. He doesn’t get why Cass is psychoanalysing it. It’s in the past anyway.
Immediately, he thinks of the bunker and Dean’s mattress. He hadn’t given it much more than two thoughts during their time together, but he knew how fond of it Dean was.
“Do you want to find out what we do after dinner?” Castiel’s voice holds a more playful note now. Dean is almost astonished how normal he seems now that they’re alone. Now that he isn’t acting batshit crazy and screaming about pie.
Sam wrings his hands together as he watches Dean head for the shower. How is he supposed to tell his brother this? It will
“You saw the guys in the video right?” This is bordering on some – some shit. “That they all had problems too. Did you see what they did?”
His new perspective on Cass’ silence isn’t something he can share with Dean though; not without arousing his suspicion.
Cass almost pouts at him… and it looks way more adorable than it should. “Of course you don’t want Sam to know since this would be strange for you two and I respect that. Though I still don’t understand it I would never intentionally reveal anything.  But you have to admit, it doesn’t cover everything. If Sam does find out he won’t have any way of gauging your level of participation. He’s more likely to assume that you
The sadness creeps up from time to time, dulling even the sweetest of Cass’ words. It creeps up on him today as they reminisce about the good old days.
Gabriel nods then Crowley slams the blade down, pressing it into Lucifer’s heart and twisting for good measure. Lucifer’s eyes flash in horror, as the blade begins to destroy him.
But Adam talks over him, as though he hadn’t heard a word. “You don’t trust me. That’s why you’ve started hiding things from me.” he says in a panic. “What have I done?” he gulps. “What have I done to lose your trust?”
“I just need fifteen minutes alone with him,” Sam says sinisterly, focusing entirely on Crowley who just grins smugly at him from his iron chair.
Castiel knows her well. Mostly as Dean’s first love. The joy he’d been feeling evaporates and his shoulders slouch. He should have known better than to hope, that in any universe, Dean would see him as he wants him to.
He opens his mouth to reject that. To tell Dean that he was always his friend. Someone who loves him.
Castiel tries to step back in horror but there’s nowhere left to go. It fooled him completely. Again.
Except… the words feel like they’re bubbling up in his throat. Trying to force their way out of his throat. Dean clamps his hand over his mouth and flees the room, but not before the ‘yes’ escapes his lips while Sam is still in earshot.
been seeing a lot more fresh fruit and veggies around the house, but he just ignored them on principle.
Castile glances at Dean, once more enjoying the air of relaxation that surrounds him. It seems as though Dean shares his desire to not dredge up any of the nasty stuff that had happened before he was captured. Strangely enough, though, it doesn’t bother him in the slightest. It doesn’t fill him with malevolence nor feel as though it’s driving a festering wedge between them.
“You hold on for as long as you can.” Sam says fiercely. “And if he gets out then we’ll deal with it. But I have faith in you Dean, never forget that.”
Anathema rips the door open, almost causing Cass to fall over. Dean’s hand shoots out to grab his sleeve but Anathema doesn’t look bothered. In fact she looks frantic and scared.
“We’ve only ever done this in dim lighting.” He immediately feels bad for his omission… and the fact that he’d once again killed the mood.
The bunker door slams behind him and he finally lets his walls drop. Three sobs burst from his chest in quick succession. That is all he allows himself. Anything else would be excessive. He can’t let himself fall apart when there was still work to be done. He had to find Jack. Ananel. Maybe, if things in Heaven were bad enough, they would allow him to return and help keep the lights on. It would be a shame if Rowena’s sacrifice went in vain; that the world ended because Heaven broke open and trillions of souls rained down.
“It’s okay Dean.” His brother assures. “You’ve been through something traumatic. You need your rest.”
Like a man possessed, Dean leans in once more, carefully flicking his tongue over the spot again. The tasteless substance coats his tongue but he doesn’t have much time to think about it as he’s flipped harshly onto his back. Blue eyes glare down at him and just behind that, Cass’ wings rise imposingly. Dean flushes; in any other situation this would be undeniably hot.
When Dean remains silent, Castiel continues. “Then what? When you’re dead what purpose will I have in this world?”
The young man, Elis, who answers the door fumbles through a response, shuffling aside to let them pass.
What else can Castiel do, but nod? Because just then, Dean waltzes into the kitchen complete with his ‘dead man’s robe’ and a pleasant expression.
Dean traces the edges on one carefully, snatching his fingers back as some of the words are revealed. ‘
“Don’t be jealous.” He warns. “That isn’t what this is about.” He shakes his head. “Dean had something here… something special with Castiel. And we’ve managed to ruin it in less than twenty four hours.”
The strip club. He remembers that night fondly, if not for the way that Dean stuck to his side and stick it to Raphael. And the way he got to be a hunter in training for a day and hear Dean laugh and tell him how much fun it was to be with him.
They stare a moment. Cass looking at Dean just as he always had, and Dean, staring back at him, trying to figure out why he feels like reconstituted garbage.
And he does, his fingers grappling at Dean’s shoulders as his orgasm races through him. Dean steadily pumps into him, his mouth nipping at his neck. Castiel’s entire body spasms as he comes, the wetness splashing between them and being spread by Dean’s movements.
“No.” the voice crackles. “No. They trapped me in Baby. To watch as they tricked you. The shifter came to you first and it knew everything about me to get it into the door. Then you came to your senses and tested it… only it was the siren this time. And it seduced you… with it’s venom. This isn’t your fault buddy.”
“You’re going to die Dean.” Castiel whispers, blinking a few times to clear the image from his mind. “Not for many years, but your death is inevitable.”
But now, staring down at the camera, all he can think about is how unequivocally wrong this is. Because his main reason isn't helping Dean anymore... its spying on him. Because Dean sure as hell is hiding something important, something to do with why he had that seizure and Sam isn't going to let this opportunity pass him by.
Cass chuckles wryly at his side, shutting off the gas before marching outside, running a frustrated hand through his hair.
When Dean pulls out a notepad, Sam half wonders if he’s going to ask him to draft a contract stating that Cass can’t leave without prior approval – which would be a very ‘Dean’ thing to do. But no, Dean scribbles something on the top and makes a couple of scratches.
Leaning forward Castiel swipes the pie off Dean’s fork. His mouth freezes mid chew as he fully assesses what’s actually in the pie. “This is… pleasant.” The molecules are by no means complex and they slide across his tongue in a familiar dance.
He raises his brows. “The boys clearly take after John. You’re intuitive. Quite like my own mother, damn her to the darkest pits of hell.”  His strange expression of nostalgia makes Mary uneasy.
Watching the time pass by and counting the seconds were the worst yet. Dean would sense something was off and distract him most times with kisses or stories or just a song. Dean’s singing voice was something special, and Castiel would always relish in the way that Dean let himself go, unconcerned about judgement or ridicule.
On his trek back to Dean’s room he finds Cass standing there, glaring pensively at the door. Sam winces, half in sympathy. This didn’t bode well at all. Dean had obviously kicked the angel out some time during the night in typical Dean fashion and Cass was back trying to mend things in typical Cass fashion. If Dean came out and saw him right this minute there’d no doubt be a fiery dispute ending with things even more broken than before.
It should be the easiest thing in the world; to tell Dean that he loves him. Yet Castiel feels his tongue lock up whenever he tries.
Cass cocks his head, trying to figure out what he’s saying. While Dean simply sticks his tongue out. “Come on Sam.” He says teasingly, “Don’t be the Grinch. He’s pretty fun like this.”
But, then again, the last few times Cass came to him, he was already drunk on pleasure and that was what his mind was zeroed in on. It makes sense that he’s the one coming to Dean with a rational suggestion now that the hype has worn off.
“How could she know that?” Castiel is almost aghast, “I – I was always very careful. To never give anything away. I thought that you would be uncomfortable with my affection.”
something. But what? If the djinn is right then Dean is in denial. There’s no denying that his relationship with Cass is different to all the others in his life. But to call it love? Dean isn’t sure.
Dean rushes through the dishes and practically bounds back to his room. He locks the door behind him and reaches for his DVD with a huge sigh. ‘Casa Erotica: Loco.’ His dick is literally reaching for it at this point, straining against the zipper of his pants.
“Hey, Sam.” Jody’s voice booms through the receiver. He’s so startled that he fumbles with the phone.
Dean swallows before focusing directly on Castiel. “Then I’d try my damn best to be good enough for you.”
“Well, to be fair, I did just want to check on why the bloody hell you haven’t continued with the case.” He shrugs, “Then I waited around hoping you might want to indulge in a threesome later.”
Cass remains silent, his features becoming more pinched with each passing second, Dean keeps staring and staring, and Sam is ready to start waving his hands wildly to get their attention when his phone rings shrilly, doing the job for him.
an angel do anything, “It’s not the same.” Castiel takes a breath, “Dean’s cooking though. He cooks for people he cares about. It’s not quite the molecules…”
Cupping Dean’s face in his hands, Castiel strokes Dean’s ear with his thumb, letting his grace probe carefully, to ensure that everything is really okay. He could wake Dean up, it would probably do wonders for everyone’s nerves but he knows how important it is for Dean to rest… and how hard it usually is for him to even fall asleep.
“Move it.” he shoos him away from the machine. “It isn’t hard Cass. Look. Just twist and push to full the water and wait.”
“Yeah.” Sam isn’t the one who should be saying these things, but Cass does need to hear them. It’s truly a shame that he can’t remember his time as a child.
Sam words along side him blissfully unaware of his plan. If one could even call it a plan. Truth be told it seems more like a disaster waiting to happen, but it will do the trick – he hopes.
Dean should be concerned about having the same preferences as a demon, but this is hardly the worst thing that’s happened to him.
Dean is dead. Castiel killed him. He wretches violently, barely managing to stumble more than ten steps away from Dean. He glances back at the body and vomits again, he can make out traces of burgers and cheesecake. Just the other night, Dean had been alive, eating and laughing with him. Castiel struggles to reconcile that Dean with the corpse on the floor.
“Okay.” He says, still trying to maintain his ‘tough guy, I don’t give a flying fuck’ attitude. “I’ll come with you, but the minute anything – and I mean anything – comes up, that I’m not down with. I’ll haul ass so fast that my own father would never find me.”
“I do not like that trench coat!” he says in a huff. “It’s hideous.” Then, he turns to Cass to placate him. “You make it work though, it’s just not what I’d call ‘a turn on.’ Sure, it’s nice and warm and when I see it, I feel safe but-  I’ll give him one thing. I do enjoy cowboys…. Take note, Cass. Or I guess you already know.” He says with a grin, thinking back to Cass’ tryst as Dr. Sexy.
His face is pressed inches from Cass’ his ears right near the angel’s lips. “I’ve already forgotten Sammy’s voice. And sunshine and birds. What if after a few thousand years I forget everything about my life and my family? What if I go crazy and – and Michael takes over. I’ll kill you. What if he leaves me behind the wheel afterwards and I have to sit here for eternity with your corpse?”
He curses the twists and turns that force him to slow down, he hates that Cass is crying and that he doesn’t know how to help Dean.
Gabriel wraps his hands around Lucifer, pinning him in place. Lucifer’s eyes blaze red, a warning that neither of them seem to heed.
Worst yet, he can’t get a hold of Jody at all. No matter how many times he calls, it always goes to voicemail. He has half a mind to drive all the way up to confront her.
He’s wanted the angel to shut up on other occasions too. Then, he either said something wildly inappropriate or just walked off in a huff. Either one of those would have been sufficient here… but Dean had
“What about the Bermuda Triangle?” he asks, pointing out the area on the map for Sam. “People complain about things getting lost in there all the time. Dean and I once watched a documentary about it.” They had no other options. Billie refused every summoning method they had tried and even if she were to appear, Castiel is certain that she won’t help them.
He tightens his grip. “I don’t want to make you feel that – that you can only stay if you’re a certain way.” Which is how he made Cass feel for years. He didn’t know then, but he does now. And he can do something. He can stop him from doing something that he could regret forever.
