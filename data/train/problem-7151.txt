Steve just looked at her for a moment.
And, at last he recognised what that resistance was. He remembered the words for this frustration, he
noticing Tony… “I mean… Obviously someone here knows more than they’re saying, so maybe trying to break one of them, or… follow them, or something…” he petered off into a mumble.
Everything felt soft, and sleepy and… warm and cold, all at once…
Even before he’d had the chance to process it, Steve already knew this was a
And then Tony pushed deeper, past the back of his throat, taking his entire length. The head of Steve's cock was suddenly engulfed by that impossible tightness, a searing pleasure shooting all the way through the core of him, piercing deep into his muscles. He let go of a shuddering cry, his hips already rocking upwards as that initial hit rolled through him, his body acting on autopilot,
He was so overwhelmed and drained, possibly still under the influence of the very thing he was trying to work out, and
“Okay. When did you last see them?”

happening. Steve could hear it in his voice.
Steve had only been thinking of Tony, when he’d decided it was time to leave the White Room – at least in so far as he was up to thinking about anything, at that stage.
“What would be the point?” Steve frowned “She’s only going to lie to us again. We don’t know enough about what’s going on to threaten her, even.”
“...An alien warlord named Thanos-”
Oh, he thought he was finished with priority point one… he’d said something about the drugs and just ticked it off the list, and now…

needed Steve to show him who he was talking to, before he could talk. He couldn’t have understood Steve’s actual mistakes and empathised with his genuine situation if Steve hadn’t shown him what they were – he couldn’t be expected to forgive the man Steve actually was, based purely on actions that had been given no explanation.
He froze, his muscles still tensed in anticipation of standing, and watched as a 21 year old Bucky strolled across his field of vision, his head slightly lowered, one of his braces about to slide off of his shoulder…
What was the big deal about anything?
Also, any advice on additional tags this fic might need in light of this chapter are greatly appreciated.
And - as of thirty seconds ago - he was sure that he couldn’t trust anyone else on earth to take it seriously…
“To help me.” Tony repeated, shocked and scared and mostly just stalling for time.
“…But we know we’ll
And Steve smiled.
...But, damnit, he didn’t want to recognise this one.
It wasn’t quite enough to wash the smile from Steve’s face… but the utter bliss of getting everything he’d ever wanted hadn’t been enough to drown it out, either. Not completely.
to chose Bucky when it came to it –
Steve could picture the shy smile tugging at his lips, the casual way he averted his eyes when he was doing something as brave or personal as offering advice. The almost imperceptible shrug that would’ve looked awkward on anyone else, but seemed so natural, almost charismatic, coming from him.
for bringing that up… That petulant part of him, that had always been prepared to get his head kicked in rather than let anyone treat him like shit -
Steve.
“The thing is, before the airport, I really didn’t take any of it personally. I thought everything was just turning to shit” Tony heard himself explaining – probably more curious to find out what he meant than Steve was. “I thought Wanda didn’t agree with the detainment and Clint was there because he feels a debt to Wanda, and you were doing it out of loyalty to Bucky and Sam was doing it out of loyalty to you – shit culmination of issues, but what can you do. And then I get to Germany, and you just casually drop it on me that,
A more genuine smile warmed through, when Bucky noticed that little detail. He wondered if Steve even knew he’d done that…
didn’t you tell him?”
“Oh, okay, thanks” Tony muttered, entirely mindlessly
He took another deep breath, relaxing his body as he exhaled,
Steve felt his body soften, instantly. There was a pleasant swell of dizziness when he managed a slow, deep breath. There was even the faintest tingling of a smile, as noted the familiar defiance in Tony’s eyes, the battle-ready posture, the thousands of calculations that he could see Tony running in his head…
? What sort of relationship could there be, what possible sense of self could Tony have, if the other person simply existed to support him?
And he pictured it – or, imagined the feeling of it, more. The
That would mean stepping outside of himself, and being vulnerable, in a way he’d not considered in even his most inventive fantasies…
And Tony took a moment to wince, thinking of how he was going to say all of this to her…
Zan turned around, clearly keen to get out of there – and found Steve standing so
in a very loud voice.

...Whereas there would be immediate consequences to picking a fight with the Council Secretary on a hunch. Consequences that could affect the team he’d come to think of as family - the team Tony was a part of, and cared about… Even if Steve was right, and there was something greater at play here, he stood to do more harm than good by leaping to action. If he was wrong - and he was increasingly sure that he wasn’t - but if he

“Well, as much as we’d like to send Agent Romanoff to babysit you… She’s had run ins with some of these people before,” Nick explained regretfully. “Might draw more attention to you than you’re going to attract already. So, we’re in the process of finding an agent who could possibly put up with you for a few days.”
The feeling that having a conversation

“Okay, so, as I said, it’ll take a few moments for the effects of the atmosphere to settle in” Janine explained-
“Like whether slavery is legal and accepted on Anni Vara, or whether this is a super villain at work?” Steve sighed, rubbing his eyes.

And then the cold, sinking sadness as Tony remembered exactly why that could never be him.
Steve was just so soaked through with love for him, he-
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered, dropping his arms. There was an instant, plunging disappointment in Steve,
“Are you feeling any better yet?” Tony asked, turning to Rhodey first. He was pleasantly surprised by how normal his voice sounded.
Tony had never felt this naked.
“Yes!” Steve laughed. “God, yes – people are

That’s all.”
That this really wasn’t the time to be thinking about how he was going to break that news to Steve.
knew what he was feeling right now, he’d have a better chance of working out what to do about it.
And Tony was shocked to find the floor gave way beneath him, finally recognising that he’d stepped onto a giant mattress as he crashed, knees first, into it.
He was especially beautiful, like that.
Why did he still want to –
“And I should thank you for coming to see me today,” Pierce carried on with the pleasantries, as he closed the door behind them. “I was hoping to arrange this meeting outside of daylight hours, but it seems your schedule is the only one more packed than mine.”
So, he handed Tony his empty glass… finding that he had to put more thought into it than he usually would… and took Tony’s drink in exchange. Then Steve gave his head a little shake, and told himself to pay attention.
“You ever wonder if

The cover story was based on a mistake they’d actually made a few weeks earlier, so Tony was pretty sure that there were no holes in it – no reason anyone should make Steve feel uncomfortable by questioning it.
The memory of strolling into the breakroom with Pepper, talking about… something…
He heard a wet growl as Tony swallowed, a low, feral sound that Steve could feel deep in his groin.
“His fault! He threw it!” Bucky gestured wildly towards Tony, as Peter began to stalk across the patio.
Tony had always assumed that, if it existed,
But he’d said too much already, he knew he had.
By now, Steve’s head felt muddled, and messy, and strangely dulled…
Tony could hope for then was that he got through to the inevitable end of this, and had his heart shattered. Far more likely was that he slipped up again before then. And then he’d have to watch Steve recoil in horror, which would hurt so much more. Or, he’d watch Steve get confused, or angry… or, the outside chance that he’d leer, and say it sounded

And again,
As Steve was talking, Tony could feel his stomach turning to slime. That physical discomfort grew with every word, closing all around him, like it was crushing him.
“He said he saw someone come out from behind one of the bars, but he didn’t think you worked here…?” Tony prompted. Zan screwed her face up, obviously unimpressed.
And his voice just cracked from under him, like he’d fallen through a floor. Suddenly, he was
the insensitive ass that he’d just tearfully begged forgiveness for being… But he knew it was true that he’d never put himself in Steve’s shoes, not really. That he’d put Steve on a pedestal, that he’d not been fair to him – that he
Steve simply
If it had what it needed, it could survive damn near anything.
And then Tony pressed his foot to the top of the little device, like he’d been told to, and the portal just disappeared – like a projected image when the power is cut.
“And the easy part of that is - I can promise you, you aren’t fucking this up,” he said, more resolutely. “Even if it feels like it sometimes. Even if you still feel lost and confused and… broken, sometimes. That’s just the things that have happened to you. That’s always going to linger a while, no matter what sort of person you are afterwards - so you can’t use that to tell you what sort of person you are. But I can tell you what sort of person you are. And I can
still felt he needed to apologise for, even if Steve didn’t have anything else. And he knew, really, Steve must have other things… That there must’ve been things that’d gotten to Steve over the years, ways that Tony’s misconceptions had hurt him… things he just wasn’t thinking of right now…

- and, also, why is everyone naked here?”
“I’m really sorry, but I can do this,” Tony told her, efficient and determined.
It was like, all of a sudden, someone had a gun to his head. To Tony’s head. It was pretty hard to concentrate on anything else.
He knew that he had to invest as much into any friendship as he was prepared to accept from it  - that he’d always owed Natasha as much loyalty as he’d taken from her.
he’d stared at Tony for far too long. He actually preferred to think that Stark had given him a strange look, rather than think that maybe he’d started it. That maybe Tony was just responding to the strange look Steve had given

But, at the same time, there was also something wonderful about it. Being
“I was worried you might think I was trying to talk for you, or something,” Steve confessed - randomly selecting one of the many, many thoughts he’d had about that moment, just for the sake of something to say.
...And maybe a part of him
How could he possibly explain that the real problem was that he
And Steve didn’t even feel it building up. He had no idea where it had come from.
But he hadn’t let them go, apparently. He’d buried them.

Then he typed,

pleased for Bucky, he
Steve could so clearly picture him undressing. The way he dragged his tie free of his collar, the crisp white of his shirt against flawless tanned skin as he unfastened the buttons… There was a constant, compulsive urge to turn and look, to reach out for him, to call out – a repeated, grinding satisfaction at overcoming it.
Except Tony.
He hadn’t meant to…But it just took so little effort – it just happened.

And Tony just fell into it.
“Understood,” Steve grinned, as a pleasant blush ran up his neck.
“In which case, you will probably find that our fruit juices have less of an effect than our water,” he suggested, gently, like he was expecting Tony to demand-
It was just one of the thousands of words lost in the haze of his head, one of the things that had broken down into pleading moans and panting.

Steve knew that Bucky hated the idea of going under a general anaesthetic. Even though he never felt like he could complain about it, because it had always been his treatment of choice. Steve could see it, in that resigned little shrug Bucky gave –
The beginning of a new relationship had always been an anxious time for Tony. He was usually so preoccupied with not messing things up, or second guessing whether he really wanted it, or waiting for the other person to change their mind. Even with Pepper, who he
And, Jesus, why couldn’t Tony just tell him yes? Why couldn’t he just lie, and say it was fine, and that Steve really didn’t have to do this?
just said he meant it, that they really
But he felt quite sure it was all his fault, either way.
And then he saw Peppers eyes melt into a kinder expression, despite her anger, and he knew-
This time it was more a romantic desperation than a physical desire that overwhelmed him. An impulse just as strong and every bit as primal - a need to do something with this incredible abundance of
And now that didn’t matter either.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded, and reluctantly met Tony’s eye.
And then a thoughtful look came over her face. There was a pause, while she contemplated.
“Yeah, good plan” Tony nodded.
Harder,
what the hell he was doing in the first place-
An hour later, Steve and Tony were still cuddled up together on the workshop couch, surrounded by the papers that they’d sent sliding in all directions in their haste to undress each other.
Tony knew what tone of voice Steve was using here.
? And each time he remembered it, he came closer to having to acknowledge the truth in it… and everything else Steve had said. And Tony didn’t want to acknowledge that he was being spiteful to Steve, and he certainly didn’t want to think about
By the time they actually reached their room, Steve was smiling so much his face ached. And then Tony glanced up at him, smiling just as broadly, and they both recognised what they were doing at the same moment – and laughed.
He looked back at the cabinet. The

And the radiators
“For what it’s worth, I never sought that information out, and I’m not going to tell anyone-”
“Gee, I don’t know Tony, maybe it’s because everyone I ever knew in the world is dead. Or maybe I’m still stuck on that horrific plane crash I was just in, right before I spent hours slowly freezing to death. Or maybe it was waking up on an alien fucking planet where I can’t understand what anyone is saying and I don’t know how anything works and I literally don’t know a single fucking person. Or are you only interested if it’s something to do with you?”
just think… God, there are
...Steve hadn’t given any of this enough thought, before this moment.
“…What if the troops are evil?” Tony asked, contemplatively.
“So… What happened last night?” Rhodey asked in that same diplomatic tone.
…But maybe he could still sleep.
Because he knew Tony just didn’t know what to do with his face, right now.
“And I’d already decided to be very polite if for any reason it wasn’t,” and he paused so Steve could giggle at that. “But, yeah – I actually
So he bit his lip harder, and forced a slow breath out through his nose, and glanced up at Bucky. Trying to think of something sensible to say instead-
This was just a terrible batch. That’s all it was. That, and the fact that he’d felt sick anyway – he was tired, and hungry and anxious-
thinking about whether he wanted to. Weighing up the idea of another setting, against the effort of actually moving – that was all.
There was no way Tony would let this go.

to do this at all. And Steve knew it was petty, and petulant, and that a younger version of himself would have been most disappointed…
Tony unfastened Steve’s jeans, pressing kisses to each inch of newly exposed skin as he tugged them down over his hips, Steve arcing his back to let him, kicking his own legs free of them just as soon as he could. And Tony could
This was
His mind drifted through all the ridiculous things he’d been roped into by his own ‘politeness’.
And then he recognised the pounding in his head, the burning in his lungs.
And Tony was even pretty sure they were thinking the same thing about that…
“Prove it,” he challenged.
...Of course, on the other hand, Tony was literally making all of this up.
It was the relief of letting go of all of this tension –
have been much more angry if Steve had chosen to keep any of that from him - he didn’t need the advantage of time travel to know that was true.
And then, slowly, the shapes started to distinguish themselves from the noise, and Tony began to find words for them…
“None of it’s mine,” Bucky rushed to assure him, palms held up as though in surrender. “I’m fine-”
He wasn’t thinking about anything besides being in Steve’s arms again, and rocking into that feeling, and kissing him-
you doing?” Steve enquired, as he lowered himself to a sitting position behind Tony, glancing over his shoulder in a questioning sort of way,
The team of agents on the other side froze in unison, like a crowd of animals trapped in headlights. Steve tilted his chin up and straightened his back as he walked confidently between them, a hot surge of power pulsing through his veins. The room was completely silent, save for the dull thud of Steve’s footsteps echoing off of the walls-
Now, after so many nights of terrible sleep, and so many hours of mental exertion, Tony couldn’t muster the resolve to control his mind anymore-
to… which is probably what I was mad at…”
“Oh, yeah, no, of course, right…” Tony babbled, willing his brain to catch up with his mouth. Hearing Bucky’s tone before he heard the actual words, feeling gently reassured that Bucky didn’t sound panicked… And then he realised what Bucky just said. “You’re in pain? What sort of pain?”
“You’re certain? Because you know it doesn’t have to be now. You know I will always want you, that-”
“Of course not!” Steve exclaimed, faux outraged. And then poured a confident glug of his drink over the back of Tony’s neck. “-
And found that everything
Steve froze, his eyes locked on Tony as he hovered, and then paced, his breath occasionally catching as though he was about to say something... and then thinking better of it.
“Right, so I should probably better explain the specific experience – yes, this is an opportunity for
traumatic – and, anyway, he’d much rather listen to Steve gossip than discuss medical techniques.
By the time Steve strolled into the living room Tony was already making coffee, still wearing the same clothes from the night before, now endearingly crumpled from sleeping on the couch. His hair was soft and untidy, sticking up in little tufts at the back of his head. Steve could see him pursing his lips in thought, daydreaming about something else entirely as he collected mugs and spoons and sugar from around the kitchen-
, the skinny kid from Brooklyn, who was thinking back to that night in Tony’s workshop. The pain he felt for Tony, the anger he felt on Tony’s behalf, the deep understanding of just how many issues were layered on top of each other. It was Steve’s own voice that spoke up to admonish him,
Well. Who’d’ve guessed?
After ten solid minutes of comprehensive background details, Tony actually stalled to an awkward halt, catching Steve’s eye in a wary challenge, almost

This wasn’t a moment of internal conflict, but a moment of genuine enlightenment.

He knew every inch of Steve’s skin… every vein that ran beneath it…

“You still want that ride?” Coulson enquired casually, looking directly at her.
He realised; he wasn’t going to come to his senses quickly enough to be useful. He became aware of a time constraint…
Which would have been a truly tragic thought, if it weren’t for how blissfully happy Steve was right now.
This went against every natural impulse, every learned behaviour – and he loved it.
Somewhere along the line they became oddly self-aware dreams… he almost

Even fresh out of the ice, facing the prospect of an alien invasion, while under the control of the mind stone, Steve still hadn’t completely let go. He’d lost his cool, yes, and been more controlled by his emotions than he’d like - but still, that whole time, he’d resisted the urge to scream or swear or cry. He’d been

. That desperation to call out to Tony, as immediate and panicked and confused as it was when Tony was actually standing there.
He cast one final glance at the cabinet – and had to flinch away. He knew that being over hungry was probably one of the reasons he felt nauseous, but there was simply no way he could face that. Not yet.
And then Tony sat up, encouraging Steve to lean forward so that he could slip his jacket over his shoulders. Steve felt his heart leap into his throat, a wave of dizziness rolling through his head as he recognised this line they were about to step over.

that Varian society saw nothing inappropriate in public displays of affection. He knew that there were other couples at the party displaying rather more affection already… logically, this was the exact reaction he was expecting.
At last, his brain remembered the concept of words - providing him with one delighted voice that whispered,

about…
Tony could tell, Steve was still a few minutes behind him. His lips were softened with sleep, his brow creased with confusion… But, when their eyes met, Tony could hear what he was thinking, as clearly as he ever had-
that, in the moment, he’d really believed it was the only way to save Bucky’s life – that his motives were entirely reasonable…
to stay.
Bucky looks at him for a moment while he goes through those words again. And most of them probably go over his head… But he likes the way they make him feel.
Bucky was half-way across the room before he noticed Steve. His step stuttered to a pause so that he could give Steve a little wave of acknowledgement, a non-verbal
“But how? If it’s not in the air, or the water, and I assume putting it in the food would be the same…” Steve thought aloud. “Wouldn’t they have to give us a controlled dose, a pill or an injection or something? Wouldn’t people know if…” But he trailed off as he saw Tony shaking his head.

How many times Steve had said nothing – or worse still, joined in the conversation – when Tony had mentioned his parents. Knowing that Sam knew the truth about them. And Nat knew the truth about them. But Tony wasn’t allowed to.
do anything that Tony told him to… that it would feel…
He’d been excited and terrified and elated and devastated and desperate and calm – sometimes all in the same minute.
That time, Steve laughed.
And it was
Steve just smiled back.
“I’m just trying to think of ways to get more information - it’s just an idea,” Tony replied, with a defensive edge. “Why, what did you want to do - the flower show?”
Wesley's breath seemed to seize in his chest. His shoulders hardened inwards, and the colour began to drain from his skin. And then, as Tony was debating whether to change tactics or ramp it up another notch, Wesley managed to bite out an answer,
How could he – oh, he was a horrible,
“Hey,” Steve smiled back. He also looked as though he was blushing, but Tony knew by now that it was just the flush he always got across his cheekbones when he was

“And, you know,
That he and Steve were literally being drugged by the very air they were breathing.
...But if he could just find
Steve had spent most of the evening thinking he might actually be sick.
It was like he’d put down a heavy weight.
He wanted to give Tony everything he wanted.
It was probably the first moment Bucky had believed that at some point in the future, he really
kiss Steve. For the first time, he could kiss Steve without fighting the dread of what happened tomorrow – he could keep him.
“...Honestly, I think maybe I want to do that for me,” Steve realised out loud - briefly so engrossed in the thought that he missed the way Tony’s face lit up when he said it. “I don’t think I knew that, before last night. I think, if you’d have said this before last night, I would’ve said
It felt a lot like being an infatuated teenager, whose heart-felt crush – the guy who didn’t even know he existed – has just
“You know I’m sorry too,” Steve murmured, eventually.
Instead focusing on that familiar pinch of injustice he felt on Tony’s behalf, that very specific protective instinct that he’d bitten back a thousand times before…

of panicking over his fatal illness. And because of all that, you so confidently committed acts of torture, and kidnap, and threatening to kill him, always so sure that you were the good guy in that situation. Well, guess what Nick?” And he leaned in just a little closer, for emphasis. “You are guilty of everything you hate Tony Stark for, and so much worse. If anyone needs to be put in their place for being arrogant and reckless, it’s you. If anyone needs to be shown that they’re not as smart as they think they are, it’s you. And if anyone deserves to have their apartment bugged, or all of their friends turn out to be spies, it’s you. However.”
Or, maybe better than that-
“Hey you,” Tony smiled, from behind the dividing wall that separated the kitchen from the living area of their suite. Steve felt the tension melt from his shoulders immediately. Three months after they’d moved in together, and he still wasn’t over the novelty of
But he was.
“I’m sorry, I’ve just-” Tony giggled, trying to reel it in enough to explain. “I just thought of that from Zemo’s point of view.” And he put on what was actually a pretty good Sokovian accent when he added “I have studied and trained all my life, and spent years putting together this complicated plan and – now you’re making out-” The accent broke down as Tony dissolved into giggles again, and this time Steve broke down with him, letting Tony rest his head against his shoulders as he laughed
Steve was going to drink the alcohol, even though it was a risk – because, hey, he was already drinking the water and eating the food and breathing the air. He took the risk of being killed or ambushed or mind controlled on every mission. They’d just have to be careful.
The tenderness in Tony’s voice as he reassured him… Steve couldn’t even remember the words, now. Just that warm, gentle melody…
He and Steve had been back to Anni-Vara twice since their mission at The Facility, both times related to the ongoing investigation. And anything related to
And it was that mentality that had gotten him through when he’d woken up in the future, when he’d seen the sky open up over New York, when he found out what Bucky had been through, when he realised his whole world was a lie… The same mentality that had gotten him through the horrors of war, and losing Bucky the first time around, and the over-whelming head fuck of becoming Captain America in the first place…
It was because they were strangers to each other now.
He didn’t know if Steve
“Which was back when Tony Stark was untrustworthy and short sighted, wasn’t it?” He carried on instead, his voice getting grittier as he spoke. “Look, I’m sorry if you’re offended that we don’t all suddenly share this vision of Saint Tony that you’ve just decided on right this minute, but some of us are still trying to help anyway.”

The innovator and engineer in Tony, the part of him that was able to see the right patterns and ask the right questions and recognise the right reactions – the part of him that had been there all his life, quick and confident enough to believe that he understood what he was looking at.
And then he felt Steve take his hand, protective and affectionate and reassuring.
, the same embarrassment rising up in his eyes as Sam went on, “I don’t know why I kept on at you to eat everything…”
fantasy you’re going to enact. That person agrees to take control of the situation, the other person agrees to comply with it.”
…But, well. Fair’s fair. Tony had invented the stupid Alien-planet-card thing. He could hardly demand Steve talk about his feelings when he’d already refused to.
Steve laughed softly, his whole body relaxing with it. He realised that actually talking to Tony wasn’t nearly as difficult as thinking about it had been. Steve felt a gentle stirring of hope, that maybe he was finally finding his feet with this thing-
And then there was the tiniest little flicker of excitement, or joy, in his eyes. Like he’d briefly thought of something nice.
Tony recognised a potential cue and decided to go with it. He took a heavy step upright, and went to stumble off to the left of the room. And Steve caught on immediately, and yelled after him in exactly the right tone,

And - without even thinking about it - Steve knew exactly where he wanted to go.
And then Tony glanced up, and caught Steve’s eye for the first time.
But Tony had pulled back immediately, simply letting two thin trails of blood run over Steve’s skin, only the faintest trace of that taste on his tongue-
Too late, Steve realised that he’d spent the last few weeks coming to terms with all the things he might be, and all the questions he still couldn’t answer. That he’d given
about what had happened-
Tony let his lips trail up along Steve’s throat, leaving a line of deep, purple bruises from the sweep of his shoulder all the way along to the back of his ear – Steve’s breathing getting higher and faster as Tony moved, Tony rocking into him in time with Steve’s ever increasing panting. And then Tony broke away to nip very softly at Steve’s earlobe.

It meant he could look at Steve and feel nothing but love and affection.

“No, actually,” Steve conceded, with a weary sigh. “As a matter of fact, I have a whole timelines worth of experience of them doing that to
It was like a balm on a burn.
Steve’s chin tilted up instantly, like it was following the command directly, a glowing sensitivity already building up along the back of his neck. His cock twitched as soon as Tony’s fingers grazed his collarbone, the pressure coiling in his hips to the point that it ached-
...And he knew he shouldn’t, really.
“Levels are holding steady...I think…” Pepper informed him, as he walked through the living area.
“Because… I don’t know, it’s like that thing, with your dad. Like how I acted when I met you ended up proving your dad ‘right’ about a whole load of …ridiculous things, and it wasn’t even about you. I didn’t even know you then. That was just because I was… scared… and really angry, I think… I don’t remember, and I don’t really know what I was angry
But even that wasn’t enough to jar him out of his good mood.

He actually did.
And that wasn’t how
...And yes, a part of Tony was thrilled to remember that Steve would’ve taken on the world for

decision…
But, for all the things that Tony was pleased about, there was no stopping six am from coming – and nothing he could do about the unavoidable sadness of saying goodbye. It seemed a shame that there should be any bad feeling at all, tonight. That plunging melancholy Tony felt as Steve settled in front of the door seemed both at odds with the narrative and an evitable part of it… But at least this moment was bittersweet rather than just bitter. That was a definite step forward, from Tony’s point of view.
And then, apparently, Steve

comfortable with all of his actions, now that he had a chance to think about them.
“Sorry,” he murmured, looking between Tony and the floor. “Yeah, I’m okay. Just… a bad day at work,” he shrugged.
And then Pepper strolled into the workshop, already scrolling through the items on her tablet computer.
Just a bit too close.
somehow - and certainly less tense.
But, Jesus, either of those would’ve been better than getting drunk and childishly demanding that Tony reassure
Stape threw his arms wide to gesture wildly at that, and Steve tried not to look too openly relieved that he’d moved the gun away.
“Ignore what?” Steve heard himself asking, his outrage running on autopilot while that enlightenment continued to unfold in his head.
So, if he was that fair to
… It wasn’t until he picked it up that he realised how soft the leather was, and that it was subtly studded with what were probably real diamonds-
It took a concerted effort to tug the drawer open. Carefully, Tony picked a folded ivory paper from on top of the betting slips and receipts. It felt expensive.
“You want to order some dinner and discuss how we help liberate the city of Mallamen?” He suggested, instead. And Steve just nodded, gratefully.
it, much less crack it, remotely.”
Whatever happened, Steve had been granted a miraculous blessing.
,” Tony exhaled, strolling past Steve and back in the general direction of the couch. But he didn’t sit, and neither did Steve. Tony saw the way that Steve looked him up and down, the subtle little swallow… He couldn’t help wondering if Steve was thinking any of the same things he was.
At another time there might have been an exhilarated sort of shame to this, a forbidden thrill in being this exposed – but there was no such thing as shame, right now. Steve
Steve had never felt as much in his life as he did in this moment.

of the things he’d brough with him. Tony could only smile at that.
The impulse to panic about the night before-
Anyway, really hope you like it!
“Right, thanks J…” Tony muttered… his voice slightly dazed now… his body stiffer…
“Or, I don’t know, maybe they want one of us to do something for them, or build something for them… Tell them something we otherwise wouldn’t, I don’t know,” Tony stammered on, hoping to create some conversational distance. “I’m just saying, being here seems to make us all a lot more… suggestable, so, maybe they brought us here to suggest something to us….”
...That was quite a revelation, actually.
“I am
It just seemed
By the time Steve had finished his second drink, he’d started to feel almost relaxed…
THEY TOOK HIM TO SWITZERLAND, THEY’RE EXPERIMENTING ON HIM
he was okay.
His head had been mostly quiet, for however long they’d been lying here. Occasionally, a lazy thought would stroll through the void, and sometimes Tony would consider it, and sometimes he would simply let it float by…. And sometimes he’d say it out loud, just because he could.
Hurting because it felt like Bucky had yelled at him, and Bucky never yelled at him.
And, the more Steve thought about that, the clearer everything else seemed to get.
He tried to remember that conversation... to remember the person he was when he had that conversation. None of the things he’d said seemed to fit now. None of the things he could remember thinking felt familiar in his head.
...But he couldn’t really remember.
…Nope.

But, at last - it's finished!
He pulled Steve’s fingers to his lips with the nervous excitement of someone stepping into a first kiss. Knowing it was right, and wanted, and natural. Not wondering if there was more to it, anymore.
And, once again, I very much hope you enjoy it 💘
A dizzying, liberating emptiness that he was free to stretch into now –
This could only be bad.
“What’s it like fucking Captain America?” The photographer shouted, dialling up the aggression in an attempt to get a reaction.
But now he knew that nothing really mattered.
Somewhere, Tony felt the realisation begin to stir - just an uneasy sense of awareness, for now. He still couldn’t picture what Steve was talking about, he still couldn’t thread these ideas together…
was the instinct he knew. This was the simple part.
But then SHIELD fell, and there were all those new questions and anxieties to keep him from drifting off…
That moment in New Jersey in the Spring of 1970
Confident enough that he was no longer listening out for anything, as he started running theories in his head…
And it would’ve been

ripped something. But he definitely heard a distinct tear as Tony pulled his own shirt open in one perfunctory tug, sitting up and dropping his shoulders so that Steve could finally push it back over his arms. And then Steve leant up, desperate to kiss Tony again, to feel his skin pressed close against him-
” Tony commented acerbically, still not entirely sure what tone he was going for “He used to say you’d be mortally disappointed if you ever met me, and how you would immediately call me out for being a shallow smart-ass,
“I’m sorry, that came out wrong. I didn’t mean-”
Not when I wasn’t perfect. Even if I had been, I still couldn’t say it, because
And then he heard Tony huff out a little sigh…
So, he had no choice but to brace for conflict.
Tony’s shoulders sagged. He
He felt his mind slip into a different place… and then he was just there.
it was better… he had the odd feeling that he wouldn’t much like the answer, or himself, if he did work it out…
And then Tony dropped his head and took the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth.
Eventually, Tony just smiled and accepted it. Unlike him though it was, he decided that there was no point in overthinking this tonight. That dazed and happy was just going to be it, for the moment.
At the worst possible moment, Steve remembered
“Sugar, or honey?” She gestured to two cups on the countertop.
Steve managed to ignore that thought, for as long as it took Bucky to fall under. Pointedly concentrating on his anxiety for Bucky – he felt better about feeling bad about that.
Steve struggled to swallow his heartbeat, as he glanced over Tony’s shoulder again.
. “Bucky Barnes is not dead,” he announced, raising another finger,
“Oh,” Tony blinked, shaking his head as he remembered why they’d started talking about this. “Oh, that was the big mistake, not telling me?” He frowned. “Wait, why didn’t you tell me that?”
When Steve broke away this time, Tony didn’t have the oxygen to protest. He could only gasp, and keep trying to writhe up against him, even as Steve sat up completely, kneeling between his legs and looking down over him… Tony felt his heart stall in his chest, even

But his sentence was cut off with a horrible, wet choking sound, as Tony grabbed him by the throat.
But, right now, they came as an overwhelming relief - proof that whatever existed between them wasn’t simply a side effect of something beyond their control, it hadn’t simply been triggered by them meeting one another - it had

“Yes, Sir,” JARVIS agreed. “Would you like me to alert Ms Potts or Colonel Rhodes?”
Century, at least he wasn’t that fucking ignorant…
And he was slowly coming to terms with the idea that his entire existence had changed, in ways he couldn’t even process yet…
Any fears he’d had about a lingering resentment, any connection he’d made between Bucky and his parents death, had been quickly smothered by Tony’s affection for Steve. In no time at all, Tony’s focus had shifted to the task of bringing Bucky home

But it was everything.

...Oh, but that

He’d felt guilty for being relieved that Steve died.

why it was that he couldn’t be selfish, right now.
And Tony knew that if he tried to talk to Steve firmly, and maturely, and led in with a bunch of confident assertions about fixing these issues and helping Steve in the long run… just like his dad used to… Then Steve would no doubt feel like shit afterwards, just like Tony always did. And he’d resent Tony for telling him what
He couldn’t bring himself to be rude, and he still flinched away from anything spiteful - but he couldn't bring himself to make the effort, either.
But he couldn’t.
“And you’re
Something about this wasn’t good…
…He’d take that.
Steve forced himself to picture it, to believe it would be every bit as bad as his panicked mind could possibly make it.
...His skin almost glowing against the crisp white collar of his shirt
“No, Steve,” Tony cut him off again. “It’s… a good thing. Well, it’s a necessary thing. To be honest, it’s probably something I should’ve faced up to anyway. And, actually, it’s ridiculous that I know so little about myself, and… The point is, I want to be with you more than I want to avoid this topic. Like, a lot more. So.”
Because Steve was
Steve felt a little bit guilty acknowledging it, but it was true nonetheless: he quite liked it when Fury called the entire team together at the Tower.
“JARVIS?” He demanded, his system suddenly flooded with adrenaline, his eyes locked on the elevator door as he jumped to his feet.
All in all, it had always been a firm

sulking. He wasn’t quite sure how it’d crept up on him, but by the time he’d taken his seat Steve recognised a definite petulance bubbling under his skin. He hated himself for it, obviously, but he couldn’t deny it anymore.
Steve being so desperate to leave a world that he had given everything to return to - to think that
… okay, so, you remember he was talking about the drugs we could take if we wanted to combat the natural effect of the atmosphere?”
That knowledge clearly outranked any instinct to sink his teeth into Steve’s throat. It spoke over any neurotic overthinking there might have been.
And then Sam had arrived to pick him up for the BBQ.
“So, let me just-” Tony waved Steve quiet, running his other hand over his eyes. “Just… To summarize the evening so far. Captain America is not dead - Captain America got frozen for seventy years, woke up and fell in love with me, and then used time travel to come and find me again after I died,” and he raised one finger dramatically,
“...Where are we?” Rhodey asked, still squinting against the light. Sam stirred again, rolling heavily onto his side.
“The initial biological scans have completed, sir,” JARVIS informed him, “If you would like to initiate the neurological scans.”
Except that Steve didn’t let his hand go, when they got into the corridor…So… Tony didn’t either… And he wasn’t leading Steve up the corridor, or helping keep him upright… They were just… walking, holding hands…
Idly wondering how he was going to explain the marks all over him – wondering if Steve would laugh, if he asked that question…

Tony huffed again, finally starting to lose patience with himself - because, really, what the

But it was actually surprising hard to think, as the day wore on… and what little he could manage should really be focused on the people he was trying to talk to.
“I am feeling great,” Bucky announced proudly, holding his arm out and looking at it reverently. “You know, this week was probably the first time ever that I haven’t thought about how this fucking thing works?”
Whether he’d be nervously hopeful, because
Steve laughed again, a giddy, playful excitement bubbling up under his skin.
“Sir, Colonel Rh-”
“Yeah, he was your friend growing up, he died retrieving the Tesseract from Hydra - well, thinking he did, anyway…” Tony replied in a more sombre tone… and then he saw the way that Steve had looked up at him. “What?” He demanded, a touch defensively. “I read the comics when I was a kid,” he shrugged, looking away again.
He wonders if he existed between those two points.
Immediately, he knew that the most important thing was-
He would never be able to watch Steve suffer. He would feel every agony twice as deeply as Steve did, his whole being would recoil from it… his entire body flinched at the very idea. That instinct was as fundamental and as primal as anything he could ever feel – no bloodlust or vampiric loyalty could ever be as basic or as certain as this.
“The Eden – strongest drink they do” Tony told him with a salesman’s grin. Steve took a cautious sip… actually, it wasn’t too bad. Sweet, and sugary. “I told anyone who’d listen that you have an impossible tolerance. As loud as I could.” As Tony was talking, Steve was deliberately draining one of the glasses – mainly because he didn’t want to have to hold two of them. Tony waited until he’d finished, and set the empty glass aside, to tell him, “Well, the barman is definitely looking at you”-
He didn’t want to say it was

...Okay, so
…” Tony answered, pointedly, “that it might be worth checking out that massive tower at the edge of the city. And I was thinking it would be easier to slip away, if we went to something that was in that general area…”
And Steve just couldn’t have that, either.
“Oh God Steve yes please more that please yes” Tony barked, already bucking his hips against him, working himself off against Steve’s hand. Steve pushed another finger into him, trying to push as much lube into him as he could, trying to match Tony’s erratic movements.
Steve let out a relieved breath, far less subtly than he would have liked – still not relaxing entirely.
Steve thought back to Nick’s stuttered attempts to respond when he’d first asked for these files… And, immediately, he was sure that Nick wouldn’t have tried to keep anything from him. Whatever Fury could possibly get his hands on was now sitting on Steve’s desk…
And then he felt Tony’s fingers dig into the sensitive flesh at the bend of his waist, and a shock of wonderful pain run through his muscles,
just saying,
“You don’t get to dictate staff policy to the directors,
Well.
“Uh, yeah, how am I feeling…” Tony repeated, taking a few heavy, staggered steps in the direction of the couch. “Well, let’s see… I think I might be having the world’s happiest nervous breakdown…”
“It’s okay,” Rhodey said, and Steve glanced at him purely as a reflex. Saw him gesturing to a patch on his forearm that Steve recognised… just like the one Steve was wearing…

“So Genesis Day is the day you drug everyone on Earth with ‘reasonableness?’” Tony exhaled, growing ever wearier with this cryptic guessing game.
“And then?” Steve asked. Tony looked up at him again.

“Which is a nice change” Tony conceded “But, you know that doesn’t mean all that is

For the first time, he tries to make sense of his surroundings, looking around him and trying to find names for things…

“But… You
safe - and that was good, in there,” he nodded in the direction of the house, never taking his eyes off Steve. “That was perfect.” Steve smiled, that frantic need in him uncoiling just slightly. Tony waited until he felt Steve’s hands soften against his back before he added, “come on, let's go home, and I’ll look after you.”
And he thought back further still, to all the bitter things they’d said to each other in Siberia and Germany, to the arguments they’d had in the compound, to the justifications that had run through his head when he relived those altercations at 3am, with a bottle gripped in one hand.
And no matter what Steve did, he couldn’t move Tony, or rush him…
Arg. Everything was
“Shhh, it’s okay baby” Steve soothed, already tugging the rest of Tony’s clothes down over his legs. And Tony writhed desperately, in a not-especially-coordinated attempt to help Steve with this, letting Steve’s voice echo in his head, hot and low and protective,
at him first. He wanted to be able to remember forever the perfect image of Steve in this moment, lying naked and spread open for Tony, flushed and needy and hard, his perfect skin glowing against the ivory and gold of the bedsheets…
And the idea that there were people who

“Drink something,” Tony corrected mindlessly, grimacing again.
“...The day with the invasion of earth, that day?” Tony reminded him.
“So… is that all you called to say?” He bit out.
Steve nodded, very enthusiastically.
And then, just as Tony’s lungs were starting to burn, he heard Steve make a panicked, begging attempt at his name. He’s legs braced rigid against Tony’s hands, his voice tightening to a strangled cry, his back arching off of the bed-
“Huh,” Tony managed. He was taken aback by how much that affected him - by how surprised and fundamentally
Whether it was simply because Steve had said something so important, entirely unprompted - whether Tony’s sudden

And it wasn’t that his concentration slipped, exactly. It was just that, for maybe half a second,
“You want mustard?” Tony asked, as he pulled two plates out of a cabinet.

Perhaps, a few minutes earlier, Tony would’ve taken it that way. Maybe he would’ve made an attempt to hear her out, see this from her point of view, ask himself if he was being as manic and unreasonable as he must seem to her.

“You think that about everyone who talks to you?” Tony asked, cautiously.

Because Tony had been

“Early morning, I guess?”

“…It’s hard to explain.”
And Tony had just decided that he believed him. That there was nothing useful to be gained from this man. That it was time to toss him aside and carry on down to the basement-
This reminded him of being a short kid from Brooklyn, before he and Bucky headed out on one of their ridiculous neighbourhood adventures.
“Okay then,
Tony cocked an eyebrow and flashed a smile, and for a second Steve was just pleased that he hadn’t dropped the bowl. He let a pleasant shiver run up his spine as Tony took it…

He shrugged, and swallowed it in a single mouthful. It was sharp, and slightly metallic, and he didn’t really like it much – but at least it wasn’t sweet.
He wanted Tony to say it again, he wanted-

Tony knew he knew he hadn’t-

And he couldn’t tell Steve to shut up.
And Tony just nodded softly, the slightest hint of confusion in his eyes, like he’d been vaguely surprised this was the route Steve had chosen… but not defensive, Steve noticed. Listening, properly. That was a huge help.
When this was

Then he caught Steve’s eye.
It rolled over Tony like an invisible wave, washing away his previous mindset and consuming him in something else completely-
He tries to swallow down the fear, but in the end it bursts out of his mouth,
“Shh. Don’t speak until I tell you to, okay?”
Steve fought the urge to look away again. He told himself that it
It was one thing to think that he’d gotten into a relationship with Steve while he was a vampire – that was probably reckless enough. But to think that they’d gotten into some sort of

Letting his teeth pinch gently at either side of the vein-
Steve’s hands caressed over Tony’s hips, his thumbs tracing the line of his groin, encouraging Tony to part his legs. By now Tony’s lungs were burning, an aching desperation throbbing from the small of his back to deep in his thighs. He was so tense and breathless he could barely get the words out,

“Uh, no, I don’t think so,” Bucky replied, glancing up at Steve. Steve just shook his head.
He felt
In fact, there wasn’t any time left at all. He would have to face the music now, whether he knew what to say or not.
Many thanks for still reading, and I really hope you enjoy!
Somewhere, he knew he was never going to get used to this idea unless he thought about it.
He kissed Steve again. And this time it
This was not the point.
That low friction curled deep in Steve’s hips. A searing heat flooded his face, as he suddenly became very aware of his surroundings-
That had been a distant hypothetical, up until now. A vague warning of what could happen if he didn’t fix this thing – something he’d flinched away from, because he’d been so determined to avoid it.
He should probably have stopped to think about that.
He imagined Tony’s hands, pushing him down, tearing his clothes off, gripping Steve’s hips while he fucked him, just like this.
And then the faint scratch of Tony’s teeth, a shock of friction that tore through him, mercilessly taunting that growing desire. A stab of visceral satisfaction, like finally finding an itch – the scorching frustration of not quite being able to get at it. The torturous ecstasy of teasing
That he was very pleased that Tony was being so nice to Bucky.

. If nothing else, it was easier to follow a pattern, to do what they always did because that meant they didn’t have to think about what they were doing. Moments like this were always about meeting a specific need, easing a particular pain. Whatever got it done.
Tony instinctively did a quick scan for quiet spots where they could interrogate her – even though he already knew that Steve would beat him to it. And sure enough, before Tony could think of the criteria he was looking to meet,
“No, Tony-” Steve interrupted, sounding almost tearful. “God, I’m so sorry Tony…” But then he shut his mouth and shook his head,
He wished he could decide what mood he was in.

Why would it be any harder to think about that stuff now than it was then?
But hey, at least they proved that Steve was prepared to roll with whatever life threw at him.
Maybe it was the surge of adrenaline that came after a near-death experience.
“Marketing.”
But he knew this was the moment he had to make sure.
“And hey, it looks like food now,” Tony observed playfully, giving the pan an approving nod. “Bowls and forks?”

It seemed strange to question any of it now, when this was just how he lived his life, and nothing about it ever seemed wrong…
He’d been paying attention when Bruce was dancing. He remembered that. Steve remembered watching Nat’s face light up as she cheered him on, and thinking it was nice… But he’d sort of drifted into the middle distance after that. And stayed there ever since, really.
He looked towards the other end of the table again. Nat, Pepper, Rhodey and Tony were all leant forward, their faces in their hands, breathlessly telling one another to stop giggling-
And oh so very, very happy…
Tony still made sense.

His mind latched onto it with all the desperation of a drowning man, until it was all he could see, floating in the darkness. Trying to reach him was like trying to swim upstream - but, inch by agonising inch, Tony managed to push his way through the revellers and to within shouting distance.
He’d expected it to take a lot longer. And be a lot more difficult. And he’d never expected to come up with anything on this scale.
“...Yes.” Steve nodded - trying not to get too excited over Tony’s use of the word ‘we’.
“Hi, how can I help you?” She smiled back, snapping to customer-service mode in an instant.
“Eh, the solution wasn’t nearly as complicated as the problem,” he replied, dismissively – and she shook her head.
And Tony didn’t want Steve to know that pain-
“I remember that,” Sam said, decisively. “I was with Rhodey, and we ran over to the commotion - and Tony was yelling something about going to get Natasha… And then Rhodey went to find her and never came back.”
Steve knew, on paper – whether in 1945, or 2012 – he’d at least have a cast iron case that it wasn’t

okay for you not to be okay with that.” Tony forced himself on, when it became obvious that Steve wasn’t going to speak any time soon. “It is okay to have a line. You simply existing doesn’t mean you have to take on every… torture, the world can dish out, just to make up for other people being bastards. And you have flown a plane into the arctic, and you did try very hard to go down with that helicarrier, and, idiot that you are, you did decide to run head on at Thanos’ entire army, so, I don’t think anyone could say you’d not done enough, if you said this was your line. And it’s a fair line, by the way. I don’t think anyone would ask you to explain that, I think they’d know.”
Oh, but…

He literally bounced on the balls of his feet for a second before he started his run down to the front door. He reached the first-floor landing in three wide bounds-
And then Steve suddenly broke away, his arms immediately tense, and when Tony glanced up he saw Steve’s face creased with concern.
Tony tried to smile at that… But he’d just recognised the source of this irritation. The struggle to explain his fears to Rhodey, to get Rhodey to take them seriously-
“...Just… Having a look,” Tony managed, clenching his teeth against the rapidly increasing threat of giggles. He had to drop his eyes - he knew, if he looked at either Bucky or Sam, he was done for.

Right now, Tony missed Steve so much that he could feel it as an absence against his skin, like an itch he couldn’t find. It had been two months since they saw one another. Two months of picturing Steve in some damp motel room, or squashed into one of the narrow bunks on the jet, and wishing he could make him comfortable. Two months of worrying about worst case scenarios and detailing ridiculous contingency plans, in the desperate hope of keeping Steve safe.
“And, uh, I don’t know,” he forced himself on – mainly trying to push past his own uneasiness. “I kind of have a checklist, I guess… But I couldn’t think of a reason it could kill either of us, or hurt either of us, or put anyone
this man, of course he did…
Tony’s eyes widened in surprise, and then softened in relief. He swallowed hard, clearly gathering his thoughts, and Steve was possessed of such a powerful urge to kiss him that he was already reaching out - he only stalled because Tony spoke again.
“Sure, sure, the car’s up on the kerb,” Happy replied, gesturing to what was clearly an illegal park job.
Agreeing to comply
Finding that spot so easily,
And then came the tiny little flinch, somewhere deep in the core of him. That low, irregular tic that fluttered beneath the surface of Steve’s elation, that kept catching on the edges of his attention…
“Some people,” he answered, with an unsure smile. There was a little prickle of anticipation over his skin, some instinctive warning that something was about to happen… But Tony wasn’t sure what exactly he’d picked up on…
The problem was that Steve didn’t feel any connection to these long dead people - especially since he’d started reading this file. Now that he knew exactly how much human science and everyday engineering had gone into creating him, how many centuries separated him from the last of ‘his kind’... Now, these were mundane stories of the lives of strangers, and nothing more.
“It does sound less chaotic than trying to break into an unknown tower,” Steve muttered, his gaze fixed on Tony. Tony narrowed his eyes.

He couldn’t even think how he’d word it.
A little voice pleaded, the only clear command in a muddle of conflicting ideas…
“Yes,” Steve whispered.
Tony tried not to smile too broadly at that.

The featherlight flick of his tongue-
The way his eyes had widened…
“What?” Steve smiled.
And then his voice cracked into a low, keening groan, his hips jerking sharply as he came hard over Steve’s thighs.
It may’ve been random chance which thought spoke up.

– and who had been good enough to do them a favour. He was also kind of rude, and obviously had a limit as to how far he would go to help others… And beyond that, Steve didn’t know him at all. But he had no reason to think he’d like him, as a person, if he did.

knew he’d done it. There was the vaguest flicker of an observation, somewhere on the peripheries, as he felt that little tug of gluey resistance… the foreign object he was distantly aware of, stuck to the outside of his thumb for a second, before it fell away…
“Better” He commented, taking a second shot, and then a third, just to get them out of the way. “Is anyone even paying attention to this?”
That he hadn’t needed a folder full of test results to
He didn’t know what to call this awed sense of joy and excitement that was so far beyond either of those words. He didn’t know how to categorize this nervousness that wasn’t bad and wasn't frightening…
Still, it just felt…warm.
And Tony kept thinking he was in a room that he recognised… the workshop, or his bedroom from when he was a teenager, or his dorm room at MIT… but it seemed to shift in front of his eyes. He kept recognising it as somewhere it obviously wasn’t.
know that my letter was really fucking annoying, even before this,” he spoke quickly now, like he knew he might’ve already put his foot in it. “I, uh, I mean, I knew even when I was writing it that it was coming out all wrong, and it wasn’t saying what I wanted it to say… And I thought maybe there just was no good way to say it, but I couldn’t not say anything, and I wanted to make sure you had some way to contact me, and…” he cut himself off with a sigh. There was another brave little breath, the shivering more audible now. “And yeah, I knew it was bad… But, yeah, maybe I didn’t think about… About how you’d feel, reading it. Not really. And I don’t know if that was the point you were making, but… Well, you made it, anyway.”
Steve was going to be in his kitchen.
Unfortunately, this didn’t seem like the best place to start paying attention. The Folk Dancing event was, obviously, right at the outskirts of the festival, far outside the heart of the city centre. Now, they were standing on glossy grass, surrounded by stalls and tents and people lounging on blankets, rather than tall glass buildings and light displays. The roll of the ground and the clutches of lush green trees had obscured the shorter buildings from view, reducing the imposing Bulsara skyline to an artistic backdrop. It reminded Tony of being in Central Park... feeling close to and separate from the city, all at once.
It took every ounce of resolve Tony had to resent him for it.
And it occurred to Tony that… They’d always had so much in common. He’d just always been too preoccupied with the differences to pay attention to that. He’d never sat there and listed
. He had no problem over thinking, now. But unfortunately, no amount of thought after the fact could replace the memories he hadn’t formed at the time, or make sense of things he’d done when his head was fuzzy, or undo any of the choices he’d made while under the influence. And having a perfectly sober head with which to remember a completely wasted head was not a good mix. It just meant he was far too aware of-
Steve felt himself grin again - and chose to lean into it.

“So, the photographer is going to be okay,” Tony began, his voice warm and confident, as he took his seat at the other end of the couch. “Pepper went down there just after we left. Apparently he has a few broken bones - but they were all clean breaks, so, nothing that won’t heal. Some torn muscle tissue and some pretty serious bruising, but, again, it’ll heal. He had a mild concussion, but they think it’s from when he hit his head going down, not… Anyway, he’ll be fine. And he doesn’t want to press charges - he didn’t want anyone to pay his medical bills, but Pepper insisted. Covers our backs in case he changes his mind, or something. And he has a brand-new camera already on order. So. That’s that…”
He felt Steve grip him by the hips, his thumbs curling over the waistband of Tony’s pants and rubbing little circles against Tony’s bare skin… But there was something almost hesitant about it. Like he was being careful of something. Tony broke the kiss and looked up at him, and saw the briefest flicker of a question across his brow.
“Steve, listen to me, listen…” Tony breathed, trying to calm
But it would.

And then hesitated.
Noticing the way Tony’s smile flickered on his face, when he said it.
Steve could be snarky and sarcastic at times, sure - but only ever in defence of a moral good, or when he was in too much of a temper to keep it in. Casually joking that he didn’t like a guy was more like something that Bucky would do… and then Steve would’ve gotten
“Oh! Sorry-” Steve laughed, when he realised that he’d just spilled ice cold lemonade over Tony’s stomach…
. That was the part he’d perfected, the bit he’d intended to base the rest of his work on, before his attention had been so completely dragged away…
“Ah, the new-fangled Talk-O I’ve heard so much about.”
…But not something he should indulge in.
“I know that they have slaves on Anni Vara. I’ve never met them” She muttered.
And then Tony shook his head, and shuffled close enough to put a hand on Steve’s knee when he promised him,
…It was going to be

And then Tony pushed back with more force, all but throwing Steve onto the bed, climbing on top of him with incredible speed. Steve groaned, arching his back in desperation as Tony leant his weight up into his arms, so that he could look down over him.
Talleroy Communications.
“What? No,” Steve blurted, not even thinking about what any of those words meant-
Steve felt his stomach dip, his cock pulsing sharply as he flexed his wrists against Tony’s hands. It was like Tony wasn’t even fighting him – like he didn’t even have to. He just carried on teasing Steve’s lips apart, kissing him deeper, warm and unhurried and confident. Steve let himself get carried away with it for a moment, just thinking of how perfect Tony’s mouth was and how much he loved the taste of him…
“I don’t know.” Tony exhaled. “But I think it’s a possibility, at least. One power hungry scientist stumbles across an alien world ripe with natural riches. Uses the people here as slaves to harvest and develop them. Maybe The Facility is just a testing ground, or a focus group, or something…”
“Hm?” Tony smiled - mainly because he enjoyed the game of it.
And a little voice in Tony’s head whispered,
And, for whatever reason, he was starting to think that maybe he could stop, for just a moment. Just for lunch.
...Unfortunately, that meant he had to find some evidence of it.
Basically, Steve had had avoid that whole topic.
And he thought of Tony again – and
And Steve’s immediate impulse was to simply say,
He had no idea what he was going to say, or what was going to happen – he couldn’t even remember what it was he was so afraid of… or, maybe he hadn’t worked that out yet…
“Do you understand what you’re here to do?”
“Yeah, you should have left it in the ocean.”
Steve breathed a laugh, letting his forehead rest against Tony’s, his palms stroking over Tony’s hips.
tried to respond to that taste, tried to
“I’ve no idea, actually,” Steve admitted.
And then came a memory he should have flinched from. An idea that he knew was dangerous, that he was already in the habit of distancing himself from…
…And, increasingly, he was worried that he couldn’t know the real harm of
Tony, losing Bucky, losing anyone… But he knew better than to force the issue. The point was that all his ‘biggest fears’, the things that had lurked just under the surface, the things that had leapt up to answer this call… weren’t there anymore. And without that default file to rely on, and without the time to go searching for something else… His brain just blanked on that whole ‘fear’ thing.
And that meant he’d spent all night thinking and not really gotten anywhere at all, now didn’t it?
And it wasn’t like Steve was going to get any less hot, anytime soon…
And there it was.
“So, America never became a fascist state, then?” Steve pressed on, a knowing edge on his voice. “Nobody being arrested by the government just for existing? No one being locked up and monitored because they are ‘
And then Tony looked at him.
And Tony’s frowned deepened just a little – which, was fair enough, at this stage of the explanation.
“What, because Steve’s coming over?” Tony asked, pointedly.

“I don’t know… Assuming that’s the true story, I think I just feel sorry for her.” Tony answered, thoughtfully.
That didn’t mean they
“Oh, no, no,” Tony shook his head - immediately alarmed at the idea. “No, I don’t
And there was no point in trying to plan this thing with Steve, because it would only make him angry.
...Damn it, he was thinking about it.
Breaking out in a sharp, delighted cry, when Steve nipped lightly at the sensitive skin behind his ear.

“Maybe it’s a good thing-” Sam tried to suggest, but Steve cut him off.
Sometimes, Steve tried to comfort himself with the idea that this was nothing more than
And the difference was subtle, but so important… he didn’t wonder what he was
“Oh no, no, no, no…” Steve muttered out loud, all alone in his room.
And again
that there was nothing more important than stopping this, that this whole ‘fantasy’ was just Tony leaving him forever and that all he had to do now was
In the moment, the scale of it made him feel slightly dizzy. The recognition that he really could do whatever he wanted, for maybe the first time in his life… spiralling into questions about what he wanted, and why... eventually dissolving into a vast, wordless realisation…
Tony gave himself a little mental kick. Called himself spoilt and self centred, for good measure. Right now, it didn’t matter how much Steve had hurt him. Right now, Tony just had to think about how not to hurt other people.
“And, anyway – the technical details are
“...Spartacus.”
Steve gasped.
, for someone to be that devoted to you before you even meet them. Outside of
“Would…uh, would that be okay?”
The pressure in Steve’s head built and built, to the point of a blinding headache, as he tried to work out whether he was delighted that Tony was home or devastated that the moment had come - whether he was dreading this reunion, or dying for it to happen-
for health, richer and better. No one wants to deal with a debilitating illness or a family disaster, no one
That was… exciting. And disturbing. And terrifying. And confusing.
Tony leapt back immediately, knowing that Zan would instinctively swing around to face him. As soon as she had her back to him, Steve stepped forward and grabbed her by the arms, pinning them behind her while Tony kicked the office chair out into the middle of the room.
“But this is, in fact, not the whole issue?” JARVIS reminded him, just as he started to spiral.
taking his breath away-
Why would Steve be embarrassed he’d said any of that? Why would he want Tony to ignore it?
“And it’s fine,” Tony forced the conversation forward, glancing away again. “I mean, it gets the job done. I’m not going to starve to death on it…”
Steve had already put so much thought into stopping Hydra, and saving Bucky - and so much of that planning had been about keeping Tony safe.
Steve felt his smile break into a full-on grin, subconsciously wrapping his arms around himself because he wanted to throw them around Tony-
Like, from
far back? He’d not even thought of-
“Okay, why is Rhodey here?” Pepper demanded – and, again, Tony ignored her. He just waited until Rhodey strode into the kitchen, already brandishing his phone in a,
“Three?”
And two seconds later, he realised that the advice didn’t really apply any more, and certainly not in this situation - so, he set about doing the exact opposite of what he’d been told…
“How much warning did they give you, about what you were getting yourself into?”
It was the things Tony had chosen
. Maybe he could just… Do neither, for a moment. Not be responsible for the situation. Not discount his own feelings entirely, simply because he didn’t want to let them rule him completely.
“See, now I wish I’d said
“I thought it sounded more like a company they’d have in a children’s book,” Bucky mused. “

“Well, assuming you’ve not forgotten where that Siberian Bunker is,” Tony answered him anyway, reluctantly raising his head-
“Okay computer, turn on the lights” Tony panted – over by the control panel now.
JARVIS was programmed to do in that situation… But it suddenly seemed unfair to inflict such an existential crisis on his AI. So… “If, later on, I decide it would be a good idea to call Steve, or invite him over… Could you just take a moment to remind me that I still don’t know if I’m risking his life? Just –
Because he just couldn’t stand waiting for it.
It changed something…
“I know, I know,” Steve smiled sadly, sliding his phone back into his pocket as he stood up to leave.
...And he looked down at Steve, his skin flushed to the point of glowing, his eyes alive with such a

...Even though he already remembered that there was something anxious and guilty and painful, without having to remember what it was
But then, as the evening wore on, Steve began to think it wasn’t only the relaxed atmosphere that he appreciated. By then it had occurred to him that this was the first time he’d ever been to an event like this as Tony’s boyfriend… That, for the first time ever, Steve didn’t have to hide how much he loved him.

to put a defence up now even if he wanted to-
But Steve had resisted the temptation to speak to him - even though it had been almost unbearable at times. As much as Steve longed to just be in his company again, as hard as it was to know that Tony was real and alive and once again part of the same world as him… The plan was too important.

He remembered Steve saying,
“On the third floor, where they have their experiment parties.”
And then, when he was satisfied that he had considered Steve’s every need, Tony let himself fall back onto their bed and sighed. He took a second to indulge in the warmth of Steve’s happiness, and the tingle of his own anticipation…
Tony pulled Steve into him, his palms so much hotter against Steve’s skin now, his whole body imbued with that inhuman strength…
Which wasn’t to say Tony had decided it
“Yeah?” He whispered close, deliberately letting his lips brush against Tony’s throat. He felt Tony’s ribs twitch under his hands, his legs tensing harder against Steve’s thighs like he was trying to anchor himself.
He slotted Sam’s intervention into it. He didn’t even know he had.
“Okay, so, just an idea, that I’m literally having right now – might not be a good idea, but.” He started, and glanced back up at Steve. “So, you know the drug they put in the air here, that makes everyone all talkative and relaxed – the one that Dev was

that Steve needed to be better prepared for this. Tony knew the natural order of this.
And Steve lifted him onto his feet, like he was weightless – just like Tony knew he would – and pulled him close, and whispered,
It was the first opportunity that Tony had really had to think about how hard it would’ve been to live with that secret. How lost and confused Steve must’ve been, with no one to turn to for help. How scared he was of anyone finding out, of letting people down…
“Well, that’s my point” Possibly Trish agreed, eagerly. “Already ten per cent of the way through, and you’ve not worked the place out yet. It takes ten days to really

be considered appropriate – but, after last night, the walk down to breakfast was a blessed relief.
“Okay, before I hear you out on this - do you promise that this isn’t just you trying to keep me safe?”
Steve moaned quietly, a wanton, primal sound that set Tony’s blood alight. He saw the way Steve’s shoulders tensed into it, like he was being drawn up into a sitting position by the strength of his physical need.
“Don’t lie to me, Jesse.”
… whole thing…” he said, gesturing vaguely towards Steve, and then to himself, and then more pointedly at Steve again, “

And then, at last, he snapped himself to his senses - at least enough to remember the opening lines he’d so carefully prepared.
“Er…yeah.” Tony surrendered eventually. “Why not?”
He felt slightly guilty, when the memory of ‘

They should be able to point to a reason the world would be worse off if these enhancements were allowed, or why it’s unfair, or whatever – and the thing is, I actually agree with all that. I think experiments like Strucker’s should be banned. But not because they contravene some made up ‘law of nature’.”

And an ancient and ingrained impulse to step outside of the situation and think about what was
Well, she might’ve.
Tony was sure there had been a time, somewhere towards the beginning of this endless, awful night, when he’d been genuinely furious at Steve Rogers. He couldn’t remember what for, specifically… there might not have been a specific reason, even at the time. Only the irrational anger that came with pain, and the wordless idea that Steve had brought it all on him…
“...You may feel a little less inhibited,” Scaramouche answered, more cautiously. “You may feel more relaxed, and have marginally less impulse control-”
“Er, no, I don’t think so.” Tony mumbled. And then he heard familiar footsteps echoing behind him, as Steve walked back over to join the discussion.

Steve had no idea how Bucky had worked that out – but he could hear that Bucky was completely sure, and that was enough.
Steve held his breath as he nodded again,
Steve stared at the keys for a moment, before closing his hand around them and squeezing them tight.
… Simple, and uncluttered, and
And, oh, it hit differently now, watching Steve writhe gently against the sheets. Steve was less guarded now, more vulnerable, more honest in his reactions. For a moment Tony just watched, mesmerised, as Steve parted his lips in sincere, simple pleasure.
his senses sharpen, the familiar smell of Tony suddenly crashing over him as a wave, his mouth watering with the taste of Tony’s skin…
And then the third mouthful didn’t hurt quite so much, and there was a rush of shapeless elation as his body recognised a change.
And it was nice, apologising like this – that particular revelation had been real, at least.
And it wasn’t until it had finally died away again that Bucky realised…
, maybe. That excess of energy had finally burned itself out in a natural, satisfying sort of a way… And Tony had started to feel his mind relax… and…

Tony screwed his face up, and shook his head, thinking he’d just start over-
“Uh, no, not
Oh God, he loved that.
In the last few months, Steve had finally had a chance to mourn that man. He had allowed himself to feel that pain and loss. He’d recognised that - as amazing as this opportunity was - it could only be a chance to find love again, and be a better person, and carry on living. It could never change the love he lost, or the person he was in the past, or the life he’d already lived. He’d made his peace with it, knowing that the chance he

He had no idea if he’d done any of that right, or if it would lead to anywhere better… But there was a truly dizzying relief when he realised that it wouldn’t end up in the
“It’s not-” Steve had to cut him off. And then he sighed. “It’s not that. It’s not me struggling to deal with the 21st Century or some side effect of being frozen, or me not coping with what’s happened to me…”
Steve groaned as that low ache grew heavier, the throbbing pain of it getting hotter and sharper with every needy little sound Tony made.
“From what?” Tony cut in
Then it became a daunting and terrifying prospect.
Which only left the cold, empty sadness.
And then took a moment to think.

He remembered the car ride to the hospital. The razor-edged focus on Wesley; the hyper-awareness of every move he made, every word he whimpered under his breath, every pained expression. And, looking back on it, Steve was horribly aware that he’d not even been thinking of Wesley as a threat, at that point. By then, it was like a concentrated hatred, an inability to move past his blind outrage that this man had
Which made very little sense, because that very particular kindness of Tony’s was one of the reasons Steve had fallen in love with him in the first place. That intelligent, understated kindness that was meant entirely for others. Steve wanted to just be grateful that Tony was being nice about all this, after everything.
,” Tony replied, with the same baffled expression.
. Steve responded instinctively, coming to a patient pause under Tony’s hand. With the most subtle of gestures, Tony bid him,
But then Steve dropped to kiss Tony’s neck, and it was such a deeply intimate feeling that Tony’s body simply turned to water around it. His arms fell helpless at his sides again, as an electric shiver ran down his spine and pulsed out into his muscles. He felt Steve shift his weight, spreading his knees so that he could lower himself closer to Tony, pressing down against him as he sucked long, slow kisses along the column of his throat. Without thinking, Tony writhed up to meet him, one hand finally getting with the program enough to grab roughly at Steve’s hair. And then he felt Steve’s tongue flitting over the line of his collar bone, the faintest grazing of his teeth over the sensitive skin,
But he still had the image of Steve in his mind, nonjudgmental, and interested, and… excited. He imagined
It helped that it was so remote. The GPS had given ‘Stykkishólmur’ as the entire address, because the house itself was miles from any named road or landmark. It wasn’t in any ‘area’, beyond the broad region of Iceland. The nearest town was over ten miles away.
He again wondered about his decision to keep his former self in the dark about everything. Not that Steve had any doubts left about any element of his plan… But as he had nothing else to think about for the next...seven minutes and thirty seconds, he decided to run though all of his very good reasons one more time.
But, all in all, on top of everything else, Steve was really starting to believe that he was going to get his best friend back. That he really could make everything better for Bucky… That he’d really get the chance to enjoy it all with him.
And Steve had the all too familiar feeling of not know what to panic about first.
Steve hadn’t planned that reaction; he hadn’t been looking for any particular effect

“I already know that, Steve,” Sam groaned, wearily. “And, honestly, it

This had always been one of Tony’s favourite places; an iconic luxury hotel in the centre of Paris, famous for two centuries of effortless class and quality. This specific suite - although not the fanciest one available - was still the first image that sprang to mind whenever he thought of the historic elegance of France. It was a light, airy space, decorated in white and gold leaf, furnished with high-end silks and antique silver. The king-sized bed, draped in gold fabric and flecked with light from the chandelier, used to make Tony think of the palace of Versailles-

Too much explanation. Sorry. - I'm nervous!
Which may have remained a simple fantasy, had he and Tony never gone back to Anni Vara. If they’d just come home to Earth, with all it’s complicated realities and personal risks, this idea may have always stayed just that – an idea. Something he liked in isolation. Something he liked to think about, without ever actually wanting to
He was about to get the shovel talk.
Which was ridiculous, for so many reasons - not least of which, the fact that Steve probably never gave Tony a second thought, and no doubt would’ve recoiled at the idea that Tony was laying down any sort of foundation for him…
The first thing that came back to him was the powerful, painful urge to

The way his desperate, agonising hope had burned out and collapsed into despair as he realised Steve really wasn’t going to say no, of course he didn’t, he was sorry… Surely thinking of that would be enough to smother this feeling.

There is something… reassuring about looking at this man.
There was a gentle clicking sound all around Steve’s head, as all the cabinets in the workshop unlatched. Instantly, Steve went back to throwing open the doors, still just looking for yellow.

And from the other end of the table, loud enough that everyone could hear it, Wanda gave a derisory snort.

And then Steve thrust into him,
“Well, I have to admit, it doesn’t sound that dumb so far,” Rhodey conceded, his features still scrunched up in exaggerated scepticism…Tony smiled at him, but it still felt bittersweet.
Tony looked up to find Rhodey’s face looking down on him with calm concern. A familiar expression, a voice that felt like home…
So, Steve began to flex his wrists against the restraints, pushing his arms out as subtly as he could…
Which made for some beautiful views, of course. Acres of unspoiled, rolling green, stretching out to picturesque hilltops, above which a dazzling spray of stars was beginning to peek through the advancing twilight…
And then, of course, a little cooling of guilt.
And he opened his eyes.
He’d spent all night trying to get his head around the scale of the threat and the size of his emotions and the ways in which the world had changed, and he’d gotten nowhere. But at least he could address the state he was currently in.
“Perfect,” Tony purred, his voice warm and dark. “You look so beautiful, waiting for me like this…”
...Maybe he

But when Tony opened his mouth to say it, he could only whimper – and then cry out sharply, as Steve did it again anyway. The same strong, slow stroke, the same sudden spike of pleasure – the same need.
And Tony hated to think of Steve just waiting there while he ‘decided’. Or, really, it was that he hated the idea of
The first one came in a plain white box, made of thick, matte cardboard - all the more intriguing for how little it gave away. Steve actually held his breath as he slid the lid free-

Tony had never seen anyone look as lovely as Steve did right then. That flawless body relaxed and open and just displayed for Tony against the crisp, white sheets, his skin shiny with sweat.

“Mm-hm,” Tony responded cynically, pursing his lips. Trying to give the impression that he was thinking very hard about this offer, as opposed to thinking very hard about all the reasons he might be fucked right now.

But then he’d found himself on an unknown planet, under the influence of drugs that he hadn’t chosen to take, under entirely alien circumstances… It had just sort of
He pinched his lips tight as Tony bit down harder, pushing deeper into Steve’s muscles. A perfect, pure pain pulsed around Tony’s teeth, a vertiginous thrill rolling after it, flowing through him-

couldn’t force himself to say no.

Of course, he still begrudged having to get out of Steve’s bed at all. If Steve hadn’t scheduled a meeting with the Secretary of the World Security Council, there was no way either of them would have bothered going back to work today.
“Enjoy your evening, both” She told him warmly, and left him to close the door.
And that would do.
But he couldn’t go along with it.
And, now that he thought about it, it reminded him of the moment he’d walked off stage at that infamous press conference - when, once again, he’d found himself risk-assessing something he’d already done, and asking himself how that whole ‘I am Iron Man’ thing might ripple…

And so it was that Tony found himself curled up in a ball on the couch at three in the morning, soaked through with misery and feeling trapped inside his own head. Veering wildly between bitter self-justification and aching self-doubt, not sure whether he was angry or insecure… and it occurred to him that he had the perfect word for this.
- everything he’d ever wanted to shield Tony from…
“I’ve had several really good parties in chemistry labs, I’ll have you know.”
“...Yeah,” Tony nodded, shuffling closer.
Was it more like the relationship between a drug dealer and a client… and which one was Tony, in that analogy?
“Are you okay?”
That he
That distant little sensation…a harsh, abrasive tug against Steve’s skin-

, Steve wanted to touch him.
And then,
But this really wasn’t funny. This was awful for so many reasons. Just being alone with Steve was awful, these days. Tense, and painful, and burdened with a thousand unspoken words…
There was a dull, searing pressure, that crawled all the way up his body as Tony slowly filled him up. Steve tried to catch his breath, his hands wrapped so tight around the chains that his knuckles were white, his shoulders trembling as he felt Tony’s thighs push up against the back of his legs-

He swallowed the pill, and squeezed his eyes shut, and tried to remember what the happy prime numbers were-

And then Steve dropped his head, and sucked a deep, bruising kiss against the sensitive skin on the inside of his thigh.

“What happened at the drug-flower-show-thing, by the way?” Tony asked, brightly.
So, at the opportune moment, they made their way through the crowd, subtly parting ways when they were about a hundred feet from Maribelle, so that Tony could casually circle round behind her.
Immediately, the room fell into total darkness.

life with Steve was better than being without him - however strange or dark or outside the realm of his imagination.
Tony blinked at it twice, sure that whatever he thought he was looking at was about to turn back into something mundane...
But, if it was going to get him out of bed, if it was going to get him through this whole thing, he could cut that scene for a minute.
It hurt… But it helped.

He felt Steve push a hand down between them, fumbling slightly as he unfastened Tony’s belt, before he helped Tony wriggle free of his clothes. They carried on stealing kisses from one another the whole time, Tony pressing his lips to Steve’s shoulder and jaw and the side of his face – just, wherever he could reach.

seen that name anywhere, not once, since he woke up in the 21st Century…
Every muscle in his body was tensed as he finally left the bedroom, not sure what it was bracing for. But when he got to the living room Tony wasn’t even looking at him. He was too immersed in the papers he had spread out on the coffee table.
“And now?” Tony asked, like the thought had just occurred to him.
“Well, no… And I don’t think those things would be considered the same, anyway…” Tony continued to muse…
he should care so much… But, suddenly, Steve could see exactly what he’d been doing all evening. Trying to eat up the time until he saw Tony again, trying to do something with the excess of excitement – trying to find something he could control in the midst of this confusing situation.

He climbed back onto the bed, kneeling between Steve’s legs. And then he placed a gentle hand on Steve’s hip, and whispered,
Nick took the hint, and nodded a goodbye.
but surprise when his voice cracked just a little at the end there-
“So, one group of Varians in helping to enslave another.” Steve summarised, and sank heavily into the couch. “Thinking about it, I don’t know why I’m saying it like it’s ridiculous. People enslaving people from their own species, wow, never heard of that before…” And then his eyes snapped up to Tony, and he seemed to gather himself a little bit. “Sorry, not helpful” He muttered, with a little smile.
...Steve had brushed him off at the time. Huffed out some joyless rebuke… like he was

You didn’t tell me you were going in to help Bucky in Bucharest, you didn’t tell me the full story even while I was trying to broker a deal to keep you all out of prison, you didn’t call me or leave me a message after Bucky broke out of the compound – you didn’t tell me about my parents then, even when you knew it was relevant, when it had been the big main clue. You didn’t tell me about the super soldiers, then. You call Clint, and tell him to get Wanda, and you get Sam to hire a convicted criminal he’s met once, and – taking Bucky with you – you try to steal a Quin Jet from an airport. Your plan includes letting Scott Lang run around my suit pulling wires out. It does not involve evacuating the airport. Your one attempt to explain is the line ‘this is all that psychiatrist’s fault’ – which didn’t mean a fucking thing to me at the time, by the way. And when I ask you to come home, and discuss it, and work

That was way more than unfortunate. This whole thing already felt like a test of his personal limits –adding a fake relationship with Steve just seemed unnecessarily spiteful. The sort of thing a supervillain would have thrown in, because of a personal grudge against Tony.
“I’m sorry” He tried to say, through more inappropriate giggles.
Steve’s chest was heaving again, his skin awake and tingling, all of his muscles beginning to tense towards this growing sensation. His cock started to ache, already leaking steadily against his stomach, twitching every time Tony moved.
Now, there was no reason to be selfless… no real meaning to the word ‘selfless’, no substance to the idea…
Suddenly, he remembered the story he had so completely abandoned in the last few days, the version of reality that had actually carried on existing without him...
Steve jerked his gaze away, immediately uncomfortable-
faulty component that was causing all the, uh,
“So pretty,” Steve murmured against his throat - and then nipped lightly against his skin, teasing with the very edges of his canine teeth. Tony gave a breathless yelp, his entire body flinching into it, dissolving into shivers as Steve covered the same spot with an intentionally sweet, chase kiss.
Tony carried on rolling into that motion, falling into the rhythm of it, and Steve let himself move to meet him. And then Tony threw an arm around Steve’s neck, forcing him to break the kiss as he braced himself and shifted, rocking sharply against the outline of Steve’s cock. Steve barked a surprised moan as the pleasure coiled tight through his hips, a more visceral need flooding through him as it burnt itself out-
But if Steve came over now, and found Tony just as he was… then it really would have happened. Whatever Tony said or thought or did, that really would be him. He felt like, when he thought back to this later, it would still look the same…
to think back to it. A voice that reminded him of how many times he’d pictured kissing Tony, how often he’d wondered what it would feel like to have him pressed up against his chest… a voice that kept telling him that he knew now, if he’d just let himself know it. He had that memory now, a living, breathing, full-colour fantasy of Tony Stark in his arms, kissing him desperately –
, and you weren’t like anyone else, and it wasn’t like falling in love with anyone else. It was… confusing, and painful, and I didn’t – I didn’t understand how anyone
And then he saw Tony pick on one of his many custom-made tools, those delicate, clever hands that Steve knew so well by now… He looked up before he could stop himself. Looking for a smile that wasn’t there, a light that was missing from his eyes…
In fact, he felt embarrassed that he’d fallen for the publicity stunt.
And the consequences of breaking it had always been too great.
, he noticed that he had no urge to
“Let me be
Everything with Tony was so easy and natural and…
And then the half-memory of a story that Thor once told about his mothers favourite garden, leading to a curiosity about which garden it was…
“Oh, I have no idea,” Tony answered, immediately. And then he thought about it. “Well, no, what I mean is, I have no idea what the fuck is going on, or what’s going to happen. But, yeah, you were right. You always are.”
“Are you done?”
Tony, to understand Tony.
He knew what he had started with this one rash decision,
But then his fingers traced over a closed cut on Steve’s back… And another idea occurred to him, vivid and complete and in all ways better.
“Do you think that Stark had figured all that out before we even went there…” he mused. “That maybe that whole appointment was just him…
Whispering that he loved him, over and over –
Good.
But, Jesus, he had no way of explaining
Acting on that instinct alone, Steve dropped his head and sucked a long, slow kiss to Tony’s throat, caressing his hands over Tony’s back. Tony moaned, letting his head fall back as he grabbed at the back of Steve’s hair, writhing into him,
“No, that’s fine,” Steve agreed, eagerly. “I mean… If it’s
, watching Steve think. Just
Why would he care if Tony ‘tore this shirt’, whatever the fuck a shirt was-
“Until when?” Steve bit back. “You think any of us are going to be less hurt and bitter next week? Next year?
Reminding himself, as he had a thousand times since yesterday, that Steve
be doing, if Steve was there with him-
By then, Steve had fallen into a gentle doze on his lap, and Tony had kind of lost himself in this rare opportunity to just look at him… He was quite sincere when he told Belle that he didn’t mind. That he’d barely noticed it getting later.
Before Tony said a word, Steve had started to figure it out.
But it had been a while since the thought of Bucky
“Oh, yeah, the trip,” he remembered at last. “Oh, fine - boring, but, yeah. No catastrophes…” He trailed off into a shy murmur as Rhodey narrowed his eyes at him.
Even time travel hadn’t given him the chance to relive his life. It wouldn’t undo his mistakes, or erase his trauma, or rid him of any one of his regrets
He wondered if he’d be able to explain to Tony how much he appreciated the thought he’d put into it - how perfect every detail of this house was… how clear it was that Tony had listened to him, now that he thought about it.

“What would you expect me to
hard enough to bruise - eliciting a needy little whine that he instantly wanted more of. He let his mouth move down the column of Tony’s throat, trailing a line of long, languid kisses that left a pattern of ever darker marks. Tony’s breath moved higher in his chest as he tried to push himself up against Steve’s lips, his hips still rocking in that wonderful, infuriating rhythm. Steve stroked the flat of his palms over Tony’s hip bones, hard, pulling the fabric of Tony’s jeans tight against the outline of his cock. Tony whimpered and bucked up against this new source of friction-
He’d heard that sound so many times before.
...He didn’t want to tell Pepper about any of this.
“Thank you, that’s very sweet of you – thank you for all of this.” Tony babbled, still more interested the fact that he was
Steve felt it closing in on him. The fluttering feeling rising higher in his chest. The increased awareness of his own skin. The fluidity of his thoughts, the way his observations and interpretations and daydreams ran away from him – which seemed entirely inappropriate, under the circumstances… But so natural. So hard to fight.
“Please don’t leave me Tony” Steve whispered, his voice still trembling.
Or ran away to an island somewhere and swore not to intervene.
“I’m sorry – could you go and get a member of staff?”
far too much, to think of Tony drinking from anyone else. There was no way they could build a relationship if it relied on Steve accepting that…
He’d never asked himself why.
When Steve had walked out of the bedroom, that adorable little smile on his lips, those ocean blue eyes looking at him through those impossible lashes –
Steve let go of a heavy breath, as Bucky closed the door behind them and slumped his weight against it.
Brief flashes of it were incredibly vivid - but it would’ve taken considerable effort for Tony to put them in the right order.

“So, what happened?” Rhodey insisted, when Tony finally got to handing him his mug.
And why…
And God, he wanted more, he just-
what Steve was able to see and understand.
“Nat said to invite you along,” Bucky added in an entirely rhetorical way. And Steve very briefly entertained the idea, purely because it was his instinct to help… But, no. He was far too comfortable with his current thoughts – his current facial expression and affect. The thought of trying to look causal, and making small talk, and having to think about something else… nah.
So. There was a nice, objective certainty.
All those equations he’d been running without even thinking
Oh, yeah.
you make a pitch for Bucky, when you’ve not spoken up for anyone else, in all this time?” He asked. And Pepper just absorbed the question, the same way she did at press conferences and board meetings and senate hearings….
He reached out to snatch it up, holding it between his thumb and forefinger, instinctively careful not to tear it-
There was a pregnant pause. He could feel the first two guards holding their breath under his hands.
…But he still
It smelled…
to laugh-
“Thank you, for… everything you’ve done for him,” Steve carried on, “You don’t even know… just how much all of this means…”
, so genuine, so… real.
, but I remember breaking a lot of punching bags…”
“We have an interpretive light show around the theme of redemption, and we’d
, Tony sank his teeth into Steve’s throat.
“Well, I
had found his way in this modern world well enough to have a sex life, by now. That fact made it much harder for Steve to pretend that he was putting ‘all that’ to one side because of what had happened. Steve had to accept that Bucky didn’t really need him to put his whole life on hold anymore... Which meant Steve probably had to accept that he had his own, full blown issue with sex, now.
This wasn’t the cautiously optimistic start he’d been hoping for-
“I don’t mean that. I mean… anything you like about me, you couldn’t have known then, right? You didn’t have any reason to like me or not like me,
. All the barriers that would normally have stopped him, or guided him to a certain type of action, or at the very least slowed him down… Just weren’t there anymore. It wasn’t that he was pushing through them, or overlooking them-
And Steve couldn’t do that.
, and in
“But?” Steve prompted
And when they did, Steve realised that this room wasn’t quite like the others. This room was full of pillows, and duvets, and blankets, with walls clearly designed to resemble padded headboards rather than being a continuation of the floor. That, essentially, he and Tony had just tumbled into a giant bed.
“Get inside before someone sees you,” Tony snapped, squeezing his eyes shut and gesturing wildly towards the living room.
, so it was sort of… everywhere, you know?”
, I know why you don’t get to do that very basic thing a lot of the time. But, since the chance has come along – I’m glad you’ve not got the chance to sabotage yourself out of it, there I said it.”
That he had met Steve, and been attracted to Steve, and liked Steve, and then fallen for Steve… just like people do. That a lot of this really wasn’t so different for vampires, at least at the start. That it really hadn’t been an instant blood bond, or an ancient supernatural draw to Steve… just a spark. A spark that grew into a friendship, and then a bond of trust, and then the vulnerable, desperation of genuine, human love…
...He was quite sure that Pierce had been braced for this moment.
It was how much Tony loved him, and what Tony could do to show him… the incomprehensible idea that Steve loved him back…
“Steve,” Tony whispered, his gaze dropping to Steve’s mouth, his thumb stroking over the curve of Steve’s shoulder.
And then Steve paused, and turned towards him…
How much
wanted to take. You don’t see me trying to make laws for anyone – you don’t see me trying to
By now Tony’s regular thoughts were beginning to filter through. Not that the urge to throw himself into Steve’s chest had worn off at all… But Tony was starting to think of other things as well. He began cataloguing the important details of the situation, trying to put them in order.
Steve felt his fear boil over into anger - a scalding, physical rage that tensed his jaw and curled his fists-
“You’re needed back at Avengers HQ.”
Tony liked it very much.
“Dumpsters,” he said, bringing Sam and Bucky’s bickering to an immediate halt.
He thought about the rest of his life. The massive list of issues he’d had before any of this happened, and all the ways they really didn’t help things now.
‘like’ you, the first time I saw you,” Steve told him, through gritted teeth. “I mean, I thought you were the most beautiful man I’d ever seen in my life – and maybe fixated on that a little bit, I guess. Mainly, just… I am pretty sexually frustrated, I don’t know if you could tell-”
Tense, and guilty, and anxious, and-
...He could
But instead he pushed Tony a little further from him, so that he could unfasten Tony’s belt and unzip his fly. Tony’s attention was immediately grabbed by this new idea, his fanatic attempts to get at Steve completely abandoned as he refocussed on just getting out of his clothes. Awkwardly, and roughly, and with Tony doing what little he could to help, Steve managed to push Tony’s pants and underwear down over his legs – enough for Tony to violently kick his way free of them. And then he went to finish undoing his own jeans, and felt Tony curl his fists into the material at his hips, and just force them down over his thighs – almost certainly tearing something.
However, there are some not very subtle parallels here to a sub/dom sexual scene, in so far as Tony is, quite knowingly, excited to finally be in control and to assume some power - and Steve is quite knowingly excited at the idea of being powerless for once, and even the idea of Tony 'punishing him' - in this case by yelling. (these are themes they continue to explore in the next update, but under very different circumstances)
, it is this human-designed - but apparently also Varian-used - system that is delivering the drugs.” Tony clarified. “But, looking at this… all the places they’ve used a ‘hybrid drug’ they’ve labelled it – and you can tell, from the chemical formulas, where some of them are
that they’d never share those particular formative experiences… It was that she wouldn’t be that person yet. She would be younger than the Nat Steve was thinking of, she would have so much less life experience, she would be so much closer to the traumatic past that Steve had watched her leave behind…
“I…uh, really haven’t been keeping you up to date with this whole thing, have I?” Tony remembered aloud. And he could see that Rhodey wanted to tell him,

Instinctively, he told himself
But, of course, he knew the situations were entirely different, even if the narrative parallel was somewhat amusing.
And then Tony grabbed at him again, kissing him desperately, his body warm and solid in Steve’s arms… And Steve stilled. He held his hands firms against Tony’s waist, forcibly changing the pace of this, kissing Tony slower, and deeper…
And pressed his other palm hard against the still-tender bite on Steve’s thigh-
“Well, no, not always” Steve yawned, snuggling closer into Tony. “Sometimes I get to take care of you…”
, he didn’t even know how to lie about this.
“Er, not today, I don’t think” Tony answered, scanning the room. “Two, three days ago, maybe?”
, part of him just wanted to grab Tony by the shoulders and yell at him,
“It’s okay baby,” Tony soothed. “Just breathe, okay?”
“And, when I look at you – now, especially… I know I do have something to make up to you.” A more aware sort of sincerity had come into Steve’s voice now, a

And Tony hadn’t had a chance to catch up with Rhodey in far too long-

Bucky swore that he hadn’t gone there to talk about Steve. That he ‘hadn’t even mentioned Steve’s name’. But Steve knew, immediately, that was total bullshit – Bucky just looked too damn sheepish about it. And the very fact that he was pretending it wasn’t about Steve made it infuriatingly difficult to figure out exactly what Bucky

A grudging determination to turn this event into a celebration, and pretend those in attendance were a team.
But then he realised… he wasn’t frustrated.
When the lights came back on Steve saw Adam sprawled on his back, blinking furiously against the trickle of blood flowing steadily into his eye.
The indescribable, impossible wave of pure

And then Tony turned, and looked right at him-
With Steve, right there next to him.
The music in Tony’s workshop was blaring loud enough that he could hear it over the top of the industrial angle grinder he was using. Not that he was really listening to it. The scream of tortured metal and the chorus of electric guitars had all faded into the same wall of sound, just a buffer between him and the outside world, focusing him on his work-
“Don’t see how.” Steve sighed, “And I don’t think she can be pissed at me for… failing to save her family, or whatever, seeing as I’m pretty sure she’d never even heard of me. Well. I think.”
“...But even if it

would sleep on the couch… but he couldn’t think of how to do it, without picking a fight.
Steve just took a trembling breath, and let his head fall against Tony’s palm…
“Not if you use it right.” She answered, almost dismissively “I just mean – you have to promise me, you won’t leave him
where everything was different - where all the people had different memories, and nothing looked the same, and a whole new range of things were possible. He could take a trip and watch another version of himself have a different youth and feel different things and become a different person…
“This is Franciszek’s office, on this floor” She spoke quickly, not looking either of them in the eye “He’ll come back here once or twice, while he’s here tonight – or, I don’t know if you can get him to come back here. From here on out, it’s on you.” There was a sudden edge on her voice when she said that. But still, she didn’t look at them. “But no one will bother you here, and I did my best to cut the security tapes, so that’s all I can do.”
...Maybe then enough time would have passed that it wouldn’t look too eager-
– to be able to have him, completely, without compromise or regret.
be any happier…
And then he was sort of laughing and crying at the same time-
“Where are you?” Tony frowned. “Are you okay? Are you hurt?”
But, now that Tony had some real work to focus on, everything was a little bit easier. He could direct events more confidently, now that this was a scientific procedure rather than a social interaction. He knew in advance that he could always fill an awkward silence with a bit of technical detail. He could think ahead to the next question, the next task, the next checkpoint.
Steve could have so easily fallen into it without another thought, if a hollow clattering sound hadn’t snagged his attention. They broke the kiss and looked together at the source of the commotion - which turned out to be a stack of empty file boxes overbalancing. When Tony looked at him again, it was with a bashful smile.
He allowed himself two seconds to centre himself, before he went to retrieve his bag of supplies. He slung it over his shoulder before he went back to Gary, scoping him up bridal style and carrying him back up towards the main entrance. Steve left him slumped against the wall just out of sight of the door-
So, helplessly, he looked to Sam again.
And he hadn’t meant to say it. He couldn’t
And then, just as quickly, he was back to that night again – thinking of those hours
And that both he and Steve had been slowly stepping forward. That, if he wanted to, Tony could reach out now and put his hands on Steve’s arms… maybe take that last step and-
A ritual, in a grand, ancient house.
“...But there is other stuff,” Steve went on, timidly. It was the nervous tone that snagged Tony’s attention.
“…And I’m telling you, no. I don’t think that, no.” Tony answered, and Steve looked at him so hopelessly, Tony could tell – “You don’t believe me.”
He heard Tony laugh. He could pick it out of the general babble of the bar; he’d know that laugh anywhere. It made Steve’s chest ache. He made himself look over, and saw Tony smiling at a well-dressed young couple, his eyes alive and happy as he looked between the two women – both of whom were obviously enthralled by his attention.
“To be honest, I thought I was being ridiculous writing any of it down, so…” Steve started awkwardly, worried he’d already killed the mood. Desperately scrabbling for any way to move on from this topic… Maybe just a
“But, also… I’ve just realised that, just because something worked out badly, doesn’t mean it was that bad a call. Well, no, it’s worse than that really, because it’s not like I didn’t know that. I just… didn’t think about that, when I was mad at you. And I didn’t stop to think that… you probably made the same choices I would’ve, in a lot of those places, if I had the information you did… And then shit just happened, like it does. And. Anyway. I just wanted to say I’m sorry that I blamed you for a lot of that, and I’m sorry I turned some of those choices into a lot more than they were, is all…” Tony trailed off, blushing again.
And Tony lifted his head, and looked at him-
His own voice seemed to be coming from miles away.
wasn’t hurt by any of the things that Steve had told him about Bucky. Tony still didn’t know why he would be. Steve started that relationship before he even met Tony, it was about something entirely different to what he and Tony had, it was based on completely different needs and emotions and experiences…
And then Steve was doing what everyone does, when faced with a truth serum or a mind reader – he was thinking specifically of the things he’d be
