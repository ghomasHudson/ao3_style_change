“They’re just as dead if I don’t enjoy my work,” Sherlock answers. “Really, how many times do we have to have this argument?”
“Happy about it?”
If only they’d let him sleep.
“Tea?” Sherlock asks and flicks the kettle on. “I’ll add some lemon juice to the poppy seeds for the next batch.”
“He runs a food blog.”
“Thank you, Molly, and good luck.”
“Oi, Holmes, new boys just arrived.”

Sherlock doesn’t answer, and John’s almost relieved. He’s got time to think of something to say, then. He takes off his clothes, pulls on his pyjamas and gets ready for bed as quietly as possible so he won’t wake Sherlock.
Sherlock believes him.
“I should let you fall on your stupid, smug face,” John mutters, but he’s smiling, and Sherlock likes it when John smiles. John has nice smiles. And so many of them. There’s the adrenaline-fuelled mad one, and the Sherlock’s-done-something-brilliant one and the Sherlock’s-made-a-joke one, the I’m-a-war-hero-and-a-real-catch one, the relax-I’m-a-doctor one, and dozens more that Sherlock hasn’t yet catalogued. Right now he’s wearing the I’m-fond-of-you-you-mad-git one, and Sherlock likes that one especially.
Sherlock smirks, enjoying Moriarty’s bad mood, and John nudges him. “Told you. Soppy gran stories.”
“Sherlock, I’m surprised to hear from you.” Janine’s voice sounds tinny over the speakerphone, and he can hear her typing in the background.
“Interesting,” he says, wagging a finger between the two of them, then settles a deeply unpleasant gaze on John. “I never thought you’d be his type.” His eyes linger on John’s cane long enough to make a distinct point.
John squirms under him, and when Sherlock looks up he notes that John looks deeply uncomfortable. Sherlock stops immediately. “Does it hurt?”
“This is the warm hug I was talking about,” Lestrade adds. “Great job.”
Nothing happens.
Thinking back over the last few days, especially Sunday, John tries to identify what might have happened to cause this insomnia. Sherlock never sleeps that much, and he can go longer without it than most people John knows, but usually when John comes home from the pub - or date nights, but he hasn’t been on many of those lately and he won’t start asking himself why now -  Sherlock is already asleep, and he’s often still asleep when John leaves for work in the morning.
His stomach growls and it occurs to him that he hasn’t eaten all day.
The contestants minus Moriarty are sitting around the dining table, most of them in various states of undress. Mary’s wearing a revealing tank top and yoga leggings, Janine is in a grubby jumper and worn jeans. Irene looks perfect as always, she even renewed her make-up, offering a sharp contrast to Molly, who’s in pyjama pants, slippers and a thigh-length jumper. Mike and Neela are both wearing sweatpants and giant hoodies. John is wearing the oatmeal-coloured atrocity that Sherlock peeled off him last week, and Sherlock tries not to think about how the wool felt when he fisted his hands into it.
“I think we’ll cut that. Thanks, Sherlock.”
“Another recipe from your gran, I suppose?” Mrs Hudson guesses.
He wants something fruity to offset the dark chocolate, so he dips some raspberries in chocolate for decoration.
"This is surprisingly hard."
“So what now?” John finally asks.
John’s stomach rumbles, loudly. John rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed, grinning ruefully at Sherlock.
“Afghanistan,” John answers, looking at him with a vaguely stunned expression. Then he visibly shakes himself out of it and gives Sherlock a small smile. “That was pretty good. You’re very perceptive. Just don’t tell anyone, all right?”
John looks at Sherlock for a long time, searching, letting his eyes trace over Sherlock’s face as if looking for something. “You’re so lovely,” John finally says, voice soft and fond. He tucks a curl from Sherlock’s face and it’s almost physically painful, how obvious it is that John loves him. It twists through Sherlock like a corkscrew, trying to extract something essential.
“What did they do to the stones?” Sherlock asks, low and intent.
Sherlock shrugs. “Not that different from baking on YouTube.”
“Taking advantage of the intel you just shared with me by taking the work space with the second least amount of temperature fluctuations,” the man says, giving Sherlock a conspiratorial grin. “John Watson,” he adds, holding out his hand.
The other boys dislike Sherlock, and it’s easy to see why. He’s blunt to the point of rudeness to everybody, snaps at John for being slow, constantly wakes him up at ungodly hours to tell him what an idiot everybody’s being, has already left several of his things strewn in John’s room, has no concept of peoples’ need to eat and sleep, sometimes ignores John for hours and then follows him around like a puppy, and has little to no concept of personal possessions, like John’s socks, or John’s pens, or John’s mug of tea.
"Fresh corpse just came in. Might be a good one. Do you want to watch the autopsy?"
But sometimes, nothing works. Sometimes his mind just goes on and on and on and Sherlock feels like he might die from exhaustion, and he just needs something to turn him
In hindsight, he doesn’t know what he was thinking.
“How did you get there?”
Then he goes back into his workshop and makes another batch of filo pastry. The challenge this week is called “Roll Me Up”. The technical challenge is a classic strawberry whipped cream roulade, and Sherlock has already done a video about how not to roll roulades, which he’s going to post after the episode airs.
He wants to eat that voice, wants to swallow it down so it will vibrate in his body, too, not only in John’s. He tugs and moves, and then he’s kissing John, biting at his lips and his mouth, trying to pull that voice out of John’s body and into his own. John tastes like worry and anger and bad coffee, like violence and thunder and gunpowder. John’s breath hitches, his lips quiver, a small moan escapes him, a tiny little sound Sherlock feels down to his toes. It’s entirely, bone-shakingly perfect.
John can’t. His watch. His father’s watch. It’s the only thing of any value John possesses in this world or in their own.  The only thing connecting him to his dad’s fading memory. Tangible proof that John Francis Watson existed, breathed, laughed, loved his son.
“You should say that to Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock points out mildly. “You can’t go on doing two jobs and getting paid for one forever.”
“Oh, shut up,” Sherlock answers, and everybody laughs, then John asks Mike a question about his job and Sherlock tunes out the rest of the conversation to answer this incredibly stupid YouTube comment. But he’s entirely aware that John is standing a bit too close to him, and that their arms brush whenever either of them shifts. He doesn’t move away. John doesn’t, either.
What he finds is preposterous. Irene has forwarded him a call for contestants in a new reality show called ‘The Great British Bake Off’.
“So he can re-open Speedy’s, but this time as a bakery.”
He’s smiling at Sherlock a bit awkwardly, and Sherlock gets up, and one of these pauses ensues where it’s entirely unclear how they’re supposed to greet each other. Handshake? Hug? Nothing at all?
Sent: 5:45 am
“Yes,” Sherlock agrees between hungry, greedy kisses. “Yes.”
Sherlock smiles, and wonders again that John Watson is sitting here, eating chips, like this is any other night, like nothing whatsoever happened, like they didn’t just live through what felt like a seismic event on par with a solid six on the Richter scale.
Apology accepted.
Sherlock’s thoughts are still on the kitchen table upstairs and on his hands on John’s hips pulling John back onto Sherlock’s cock, so it takes him a moment to notice that John’s gone pale.
After, they lie tangled together on the cold ground, tucked away behind stacks and stacks of metal boxes filled with assorted goods meant for export.
He meets Sherlock in the kitchen. He’s loading his teacup into the dishwasher, and he also puts in the glass he apparently took off stage with him.
Of course the moment he’s uttered that sentence Rosie starts crying.
It’s the last glimpse of normalcy going up in smoke.
They’re both silent for a while. Then John says, “We’ll keep looking.”
“What is it?” he asks. “Too much?”
John swallows, stunned. For a moment he doesn’t know what to say. Then he croaks out, quietly, his voice not entirely steady, “How did you know?”
Sherlock makes a vague humming sound in the back of his throat that could be enquiry, or could be agreement, as you choose to take it.
“No, I’m fine,” Sherlock says, and it’s difficult not to reach out and touch John, rest a reassuring hand on his arm or his shoulder, and he realises how used he is to touching John by now.
What is it? - SH
Or maybe something stronger.
Fortunately, they all have lockers at the theatre, so John gets out some fresh clothing he stores there for exactly this purpose, and his toothbrush, and goes to shower. The tiny backstage bathroom is disgusting, but anything is better than facing the day the way he is.
“I don’t know,” John says, putting milk into his tea. “Anything but puff pastry, and I’m fine.”
John doesn’t know why. Maybe it’s the life-saving. Maybe it’s the army background. Maybe it’s the fact that John doesn’t feel threatened by Sherlock’s intellect but admires it. Maybe it’s just John’s stupid fanboy-admiration for Sherlock’s sheer brilliance. Maybe it’s that John occasionally tells Sherlock to stuff it, to shut up, that he’s an idiot, and maybe he’s the only one who’s ever said that to Sherlock and meant it affectionately. Maybe it’s the fact that he’s just as screwed up as Sherlock is.
John stars, which
“John?”
“Agreed. Let’s go back to resentment and badly veiled insults, it suits us much better,” Mycroft replies in his usual acerbic tone, but the small smile that flits over his face doesn’t go unnoticed by Sherlock.
And he is going to, any minute now.
The tactic is mostly the same. Get in, get evidence, hand it over to local authorities that aren’t corrupt -finding them is sometimes more of a challenge than the actual infiltration - and get out. The cover varies, mostly on account of the information they have been able to gather on the organisation, and Sherlock’s level of proficiency in the language. Sherlock speaks 22 languages, and reads 13 more, but the difference between speaking a language and being able to sound like a native speaker is the difference between life and death in scenarios like these.
“Hey,” John says gently, taking Sherlock’s chin in his hand and turning Sherlock’s head so he has to look at John. “This isn’t a trick question. There are no wrong answers here. If the answer is no thank you, how about you suck me off with that pretty mouth of yours, then that’s also fine.” John grinds back against Sherlock, rubbing their cocks together, and Sherlock gasps. “More than fine,” John breathes, voice not entirely steady. He leans down and kisses Sherlock, deep and dirty. “Tell me what you want,” he whispers against Sherlock’s lips. “Tell me how to make you feel good, you absolutely gorgeous bastard.”
No. Wrong. All wrong. There must be something, some way to fix this.
He lifts his head. “Invigorating, if not very sanitary.”
“When exactly did you come here?” Sherlock asks.
John turns his head to look at Sherlock, and there’s so much heat in his deep blue eyes that Sherlock’s knees go weak. John grins. “Yeah, all right.”
“Spend unnecessary amounts of time outdoors?”
“Speaking of acting,” Lestrade says, checking his watch. “Let’s get back to work.”
John flashes him a quick smile and takes Molly’s hand. “No different than the tent.”
The souffles go in the oven, and Sherlock is alone with his thoughts again.
Or, he doesn’t let himself pay attention. He doesn’t let himself think about it.
After a quick goodbye and apology to Sarah, John follows Sherlock out of the pub. It doesn't surprise him when Sherlock leads him towards the clinic. What does surprise him is Sherlock's uncharacteristic silence. He asks Sherlock several times to tell him what's going on, but Sherlock only answers that John needs to see for himself.
“Did you know she didn’t live in that building? Nobody who lives there even knows her. Why would she break into the cellar of a building she didn’t live in to commit suicide?”
John makes a protesting sound and cracks one eye open. “Sod being late.” He grabs Sherlock’s arm and pulls until Sherlock’s sprawled over him.
,” Sherlock bites out with a venom that surprises John, and walks out into the rehearsal room.
“Yes,” Sherlock mutters, gripping John’s hands like his life depends on it. He thrusts up into John, and John feels it down to his toes, feels his entire body sing and respond. He’s painfully, achingly aroused and any coherence he had left flees when Sherlock thrusts up again. They move together, and it’s sweaty and uncoordinated and messy and fucking perfect.
“Apparently Miss Jones works as a cleaner at the Watch Headquarters,” Sherlock says, meeting John’s uneasy gaze.
“Well, then that's our best option.”
Sherlock shifts so he’s facing John. “Do you want to become an apprentice medic?”
There’s a spark in Sherlock’s mind that travels through his synapses and sets off a cascade of connections and suddenly a plan crystallises in perfect clarity before his mental eye. “Mycroft,” he breathes. “Don’t lend the money to me. Lend it to Mr Chatterjee.”
The door opens and an elderly matron welcomes them in. They’re ushered into the kitchen and into chairs, where bowls of steaming soup are placed before them, with soft, brown bread and actual butter. John eats happily, and even Sherlock tucks in, while Mr Lestrade fills in the elderly lady, whose name, they learn, is Mrs Hudson.
“The coriander is too dominant as well,” Sherlock adds, glad that John is open to criticism. “What is it supposed to be like?”
“Oh my god,” John mutters, looking over at Sherlock, whose expression shows the same awe John feels.
“Attention, Sherlock,” Irene says, and he can hear her predatory grin in her voice. “Instagram followers. YouTube followers. Sponsorship deals.”
When he enters the dining hall, Sherlock is already there, eating and reading an enormous book.
John hasn’t said a word to Sherlock since they came up to their room. He can hear Sherlock, lying on his bed on the other side of the room. The silence is almost deafening.
John moves to his side quickly, just in time for Sherlock to vomit on his shoes.
With that, he turns and walks away and Sherlock is left there in the parking lot, still dumbstruck. Half of him is seething, and the other half thinks the same thing he thinks every time he sees John.
He hits reply and types
And then they’re just looking at each other in the dim light of rapidly descending winter dusk. Sherlock is losing the sense of his body, and he doesn’t know whether it’s from the cold or from the heady rush of being with John again, of seeing him, hearing his voice, looking into his eyes.
It turns a bit competitive, the way these things often do. It’s obvious that Sherlock has had more practice, but John is a fast learner and he’s surprisingly good at this, the way he is surprisingly good at a number of things one would never expect just from looking at him. And at a few that are immediately obvious.
You’re going to need to be more precise than that.
"Extrapolation." Sherlock looks at John,who’s taking a drag from his pint and seems to be waiting for something. “What?” he snaps.
John makes him eat, makes him drink, makes him talk.
There’s a pregnant pause, and then Mrs Hudson says, “Of course,” to Lestrade, as if Sherlock hadn’t spoken. “I’ve got a perfectly good room in the attic, it’s a little drafty but easily large enough for the two of them.”
Below that are several anonymous comments with varying degrees of pornographic speculation about their respective penis size and sexual preferences.
John rubs a hand over the back of his neck and looks into his tea as if it holds the answer to anything. He’s silent for so long that Sherlock is sure he won’t answer. But then he sighs and seems to come to a decision. “Honestly?” He looks up and meets Sherlock’s curious gaze with a small self-deprecating smile. “This is something I will never say on tv. But. Afghanistan.”
John holds his gaze for another moment, and then he calls in sick for the first time since Sherlock met him. He can hear Mrs Hudson on the other end of the phone fussing over John, and he’s satisfied that he doesn’t need to threaten her after all. He is rather fond of her.
John had a back row ticket - he hates sitting in front, especially when Sherlock’s onstage - and now the actors, who’ve seen him around picking Sherlock up after shows and rehearsals, all want to hear how he liked the play.
Sherlock doesn’t live very far away, so they decide to walk. London is bustling, even at this time of night, and they take their time. They walk past the busy Baker Street tube station and along sidewalks teeming with tourists and locals.
Sherlock needs a second to remember what they were talking about; he was focused on John’s naked knee just now. “The ones I lost are yellow. I wanted to figure out why I lost these, but there’s no rhyme or reason to it, really.”
John moves even closer, and ever so carefully entwines their fingers. Sherlock’s heartbeat picks up, and his breath catches. “I’m glad you’re back,” John says, carefully not looking at Sherlock. “I’ve missed you.”
Sherlock smiles, small but genuine, and he gives John an approving look. “Very good, John. You’re learning.”
Sherlock leaves for Aden 6 hours later.
Once all the pies are out, the crew send them out of the tent for what they call the ‘money shots’ or ‘food porn shots’.
“Obviously.” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I didn’t walk here in the middle of the night because I think they’re fine.”
“Getting shot is boring?”

John’s fallen silent again. They’ve been walking aimlessly through London’s deserted streets, wind biting at their hands and ears, trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy. Finally, John said, “I’m starving,” and turned into this place.
He’s wanted to since Ukraine.
You barely weigh and measure. I’m not disputing that it works for you. But less experienced bakers would fall flat on their faces if they baked like you. Though, to be fair, now that I’ve seen your gran’s recipe book, I know where you get it from.
Alter the variables.
Sherlock opens his eyes and sees John hover next to the sofa he’s sitting on. He’s rubbing the back of his neck, and Sherlock recognises the gesture as a sign that John is uncomfortable. He ruthlessly suppresses the little voice in his head that says,
“Fine,” Sherlock sighs and John can see him try and fail to relax.
“I don’t do dinner,” Sherlock says and takes a bite of his scone.
But, he thinks as he slips on his mud-encrusted shoes, it’s a risk they’re just going to have to take.
“Our Twitter interactions are through the roof, mostly because of those two,” Emma points out. “Our market share is increasing by the week. The show is a hit, and while I’m sure it would have been successful without the two of them, this is still good for all of us.”
Mike jerks a thumb at him. “That’s Holmes. Good lad, but mad as a hatter.”
Sherlock finds himself completely mesmerised by the tops of John’s ears. The gentle curve of his helix, especially.
The man nods and lowers his crossbow. “Let’s go, then.”
He turns the picture around. There, washed-out and barely legible, is the date. November 10th, 1917.
“Thank you.”
“What do you hope to find that the police missed?” John asks, even as he steps closer to the building.
the bloody theatre," Sherlock snaps."
When he sees Sherlock, John smiles at him brightly, annoyance apparently forgotten. “Hey,” he greets Sherlock, then looks around his workstation. “No tea?”
“Oh no,” Sherlock sighs. “I loathe boarding school.”
“There’s something out there,” he says very quietly, stepping closer to John. “Something’s watching us.”
He can see that Moriarty understands him exactly. He takes a step closer to Sherlock, but so does John. It’s a decisive sort of step, one that makes a point. He’s not doing much of anything, really, just leans casually on his cane, and the expression on his face is deceptively mild, but there’s a flinty coolness in his eyes that visibly makes Moriarty pause.
“I know. That’s the opposite of helpful.”
“But you said nobody ever heard from them again,” Sherlock insists. “That’s not what people do. They write letters. They buy tickets. They communicate their intentions to their neighbours.”
John puts a hand on his arm to calm him and adds, “Please. We're lost.”
Sherlock types, eager fingers stabbing at the tiny keyboard of his phone.
Sherlock smiles, and in his joy he manages to ignore that John’s voice sounds as if he was just involved in an exhausting wrestling match and lost.
“Impressive.”
Second proofing time, and Sherlock is having a hard time keeping his annoyance at bay. He’s sitting in the catering tent, scrolling through his emails, listening with half an ear to the other contestants moaning about their bakes.
Sherlock washes his hands at the hospital and while he watches the bloodied water drain out of the basin, he slowly and surely deletes everything about this night.
Moriarty is sitting in a corner, sulking. He’s obviously either texting or writing an angry email, if the way his fingers are stabbing at his phone is anything to go by. Occasionally, he gives Sherlock a withering glance
No. Just…
As soon as they’re horizontal, Sherlock starts pulling on John’s clothes, even as John peels his layers off, coat, jacket, shirt.
your bloody job to take that bullet in the first place. Not for her. And sure as fucking hell not for me. For nobody. I don’t want you to throw your life away for me. Not ever again. All right?”
Moriarty arrives and glares at Sherlock with open hostility. “This week you’ll lose. My bake is spectacular.”
Unfortunate.
Molly doesn’t react, she just stands stock-still, eyes flicking from the cameras to the lights to the audience. “I think I’m going to be sick,” she whispers.
John flashes him a small, self-deprecating smile. "I suppose it was. Sorry, I'm pants at this."
“I picked it up at the meat market.”
Sherlock nods and greedily watches John’s every expression, every stroke and flick and twist of his hand, every shudder and bitten-off moan until he can’t take it anymore and all but pounces on John.

An hour ago, Sherlock felt frozen in time and space and his own brain, stewing in its own juices, like a trapped animal, ready to devour itself to get free, get out, get away.
“You did what you had to do,” Victor continues, never one to let a silence sit. “And I can’t say that I didn’t resent it at the time, but on some level I understood even then. Part of me would have given anything to walk away, but I wasn’t ready. But somehow we both survived, and that’s the thing that matters now.”
She doesn’t yet know of the many ways in which he has failed her, failed her father, failed her mother, failed as a person and as a detective. She doesn’t know yet that he’s broken his vow, that he allowed her mother to die.
“Bugger all,” he mutters, but there’s nothing he can do about it now. He’ll apologise tomorrow. Right now he has to find Sherlock.
So Sherlock does what he always does.
Sherlock is standing in the middle of the sitting room holding a tennis racket and a tennis ball.
sorry I shot him,” Mary says quietly, matching her tone to John’s. “But I don’t know how to prove it to you. And I don’t know where we can go from here. I want to try to fix this, John.”
He sets down the cake and there’s a noticeable pause, where they hold each others’ eyes, and then John gives an almost imperceptible nod. Sherlock sits down in an empty chair next to Janine, and conversation resumes, but Sherlock can’t listen to a word, because his ears are buzzing with a sound like the ocean and the errant pounding of his heart.
Sherlock smiles at the amusement in John’s voice, and not for the first time, he wishes he could freeze this moment and live within it, John here, at 221B, smiling at Sherlock’s bad joke, and for once he gets his wish, because he falls asleep like this, peacefully, with John by his side and wholly his for one more night.

Suddenly he wants nothing more than to collapse into Sherlock.
“What are the measurements for a large tin, and how much flour is more flour?” Sherlock asks. “Be precise, John. For once in your life, be precise.”
“Still, he’s so cool during filming, I never thought he’d be the type to stress-bake,” Irene says, ladling some of Sherlock’s home-made jam onto her scone.
As always, he posts a note on the door of his ground-floor studio that says
Of course he’s forgiven Sherlock. Of course he will always forgive Sherlock.
Slowly, slowly, so slowly, so carefully, inching back together, not taking anything for granted, never ever again taking anything for granted, that fragile wonderful exquisite painful lovely heartrending perfection of John Watson, just sitting in his chair and breathing. So careful with each other, always tip-toeing around each other, the certainty they used to have of each other lost.
“In here,” Sherlock says, and lifts his feet so John can sit down on the couch. John lets himself fall heavily into the couch cushions. He’s been in tech all week, but he’s home earlier than yesterday, so apparently it’s going well.
John just stares at him, still unable to form a word, or even a thought.
Sherlock gets praise for originality and taste.
The words hit Sherlock hard. He knows that everybody thinks he’s a complete and utterly heartless bastard, but he does in fact have some idea of how John must have felt, if only because for the year he was gone he often felt like an amputee, looking over his shoulder for someone who wasn’t there.
“Don’t complain about cakes, people. Sooner or later we’ll get a savoury challenge, and you will all wish you could just bake a goddamned cake again.”
Sherlock stares at him open-mouthed because John Watson is
Kitty stares at him in open-mouthed shock. “How did you…”
“How about your competition?”
Start again.
Suddenly, Sherlock misses him intensely, the warmth of him, the security of him, the fact that he doesn’t spin, doesn’t look like he knows how, like he’s the axis of the world, the only fixed point in the universe.
John shrugs. “Needs must. The work needs to be done, otherwise there won’t be a play.”
Sherlock flips the kettle on and watches John knead the scone dough. “You never measure,” he points out, and it comes out vaguely accusing.
She nods, satisfied that he means it, and opens the door. Sherlock all but falls into the room, but catches himself quickly and looks critically at John. “Anything broken?”
John leans against a tree trunk and closes his eyes. “Can I ask you something?” he says, quietly.
“Religiously,” John says with a teasing grin.
“You heard our judges,” Mrs Turner announces into the camera, “the competition is still wide open, though Sherlock has edged out a lead with his technical proficiency. Can John surprise again? Will Irene or Jim fight them for the top spots? I guess we’ll find out tomorrow.”
John darts a quick glance at Sherlock, who quickly busies himself with his cake again, a bit angry at himself for getting caught listening.
“Shut up and say that again,” John says, and he sounds irritated, but his eyes are shining and he’s smiling ever so slightly, like something amazing is about to happen.
Sherlock quietly sips his tea and hopes nobody will ever know that there is one criminal out there who has found a way to make Sherlock Holmes afraid of him.
Anderson looks for a moment like he wants to respond, but John lifts an eyebrow and Anderson shuts his mouth, picks up his plate and walks away.
“Who took it?” John asks before Sherlock can.

It’s dark and uncomfortable and cold, but they spend most of their time with hands exploring every inch of newly discovered skin, breath fogging up the small windows.
“That’s a good taste on you,” he whispers, and Sherlock honest to god whimpers, because he’s hard enough that it almost hurts, and John is relentlessly teasing him, running his tongue along Sherlock’s lips.
John catches the end of that second yes as he leans in and kisses Sherlock. Gently. Cautiously. Sherlock is still kneeling between his thighs, and John wraps one arm around his waist and gently threads the fingers of his other hand into Sherlock’s hair and pulls him even closer. Sherlock huffs a surprised breath against John’s lips, then kisses back, carefully, deliberately, hands fisting in the fabric of John’s jumper. John can feel the tremor that runs through Sherlock’s body when John licks against his lips, and John moves closer, drags Sherlock in, wants more contact, more warmth, more of this heady, quiet intimacy. Sherlock seems to be on board with this because he grabs at John’s clothes and holds John still.
“You mean…” John whistles quietly as an idea occurs to him. “So you’re saying we stepped through a fairy ring into the Otherworld?”
“Softie,” John mutters under his breath, an amused half-smile curling in the corner of his mouth.
“Nightmare,” Sherlock deduces before John can open his mouth.
And then what?
Sherlock sits down at the kitchen table and John sits opposite him. The only light comes from the dim lamp over the kitchen sink. It’s oddly cozy, for all that the tiles are cold against Sherlock’s naked feet and he’s dressed only in a thin sleep shirt and pyjama bottoms.
, he’ll swallow his pride and ask Mycroft for help.
When John calls the fifteen, Sherlock can’t take it anymore. He passes quietly through the stage door and goes to stand in the wings, listening to the house come in. John’s at his stage manager’s desk and checking with Sally over the intercom that everything’s set.
John snorts. “You’ve got to be kidding. How am I supposed to be quiet with you doing that?”
Sherlock tries to pretend that he isn’t staring at a small, innocuous piece of skin and says, “Onions, finely chopped.”
it every night. He could just go upstairs with John and strip him and touch him all over and have him in every way imaginable, and John would let him, would encourage him even, and with every hit, Sherlock would get more addicted, more dependent, more strung out when John’s not around.
“So, Sherlock,” Mrs Hudson says as she appears at his elbow with the steadicam. “Talk to us. I see you’re making sticky toffee pudding, but what is this?”
Whatever John expected doesn’t matter, it turns out, because they don’t make it to the gate, or even halfway there. They take three steps into the forest and immediately, they’re surrounded by twenty Fey’a pointing wicked-looking spears and arrows at them.
John separates the sponge into three different tins, and adds food colouring to one of them. Then he puts them into the oven and sets the timer.
“Different war,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock shrugs and tries to pretend he’s not shaking a tiny bit. “It was a complete coincidence that it wasn’t the other way around.”
John turns to Sherlock, who’s looking at him with an indecipherable expression. “Tea?”
Lestrade waves him off. “No, why would you? If anything you say is remotely true, you thought you might get home this way.” He sighs. “But I think you sprung a trap that might have been meant for you, and it might not be.”
Sherlock arrives at another mansion turned hotel with a giant park, in rural Berkshire. The drive up from London was uneventful, and it’s so early that it’s barely light.
There’s a light on in one of the ground floor windows.
“Yes, because giving the ex who broke your heart another shot at it is easier than figuring out the logistical details of marrying the woman you love,” John says quietly, so Sherlock won’t hear.
He walks and walks through the city streets, unseeing and unheeding. To say he’s confused would be an understatement.
Molly turns to them, and she looks a bit shaken. “I need a cuppa,” she mutters and vanishes in the direction of the catering tent.
The Sherlock from Before, the Sherlock who hadn’t lost anything yet, who didn’t realise how stupidly he took John’s presence for granted, would dismiss these small moments. Mugs of tea over breakfast, toast crumbs sticking to John’s upper lip. Eyes meeting in darkened alleys, hearts pounding, faces stretched into matching grins. Quiet Sunday afternoons doing nothing in particular in perfect silence for hours.
“Sod off,” John says without heat.
John blinks up at her, feeling overwhelmed by life and entirely unprepared for bride rage. “What time is it?” he asks.
“What about John?” Sherlock echoes the question, trying very hard not to sound defensive, and realising that he absolutely does.
John shrugs, carefully not looking at Sherlock. “I never really thought about what I want.”
Right now, though, he would commit actual, literal murder for a cigarette.
“It should be possible,” Sherlock points out. “There are, after all, objective criteria to what constitutes a good bake.”
Sherlock opens his mouth and closes it again, because yes, he did, and that wasn’t planned in any way, shape or form. But it’s true, nonetheless.
When John wakes up, the sun is shining into his eyes, his head aches, his throat is dry and he feels like he played rugby and collided with the entire opposing team.
John’s moved beyond pain, beyond cold. Every nerve in his body is on high alert. He’s wriggling his hands, his feet, anything to get out of these ropes, but the knots hold fast. He’s stuck. He hopes Moriarty will cut him loose from the tree at least to display him to Sherlock, and he’s moving his legs around as much as he can to keep them from falling asleep.
He wants a shower and a haircut and Angelo’s lasagna. A good night’s sleep and the sound of London traffic outside his window.
Lestrade sighs and rubs a hand over his face, obviously tired after a long day. “Fine, I won’t say anything more. Just…” he turns around and looks at Sherlock directly. “Life is short. People who truly make it better are very rare.”
It feels nice, and John leans into it for a moment before shrugging her off. “I’m fine, really. Sherlock’s fine, too, he’s just having an odd reaction to some Fey’a medication and a concussion.”
That moment, the communications unit crackles to life. “Lift number three, any occupants?”
Sherlock turns around in John’s arms and presses them close together. “Never say that to him,” he mutters as he leans down for a kiss.
he doesn’t say.
He nods and offers her his arm. “I was about to leave myself.”
With clumsy fingers he opens John’s fly and pushes his underwear out of the way, reaching for John’s cock without a hint of finesse. It’s been so long, and he’s missed this so much, the smell of John, the feel of him, the way he looks and sounds.
Nothing else has been quick. The wallpaper Anderson picked out was a nightmare, so they had to replace it, the sofa was missing two of its four legs when it was delivered, and actually hanging and focusing lights went on straight through the weekend, because Mike’s useless. He disappears every day before lunch, and even before that, his hands are shaking too much to be of any use whatsoever. So John has been doing two jobs, and the strain is showing. The crew has been pressuring him to talk to Mrs Hudson, but he just doesn’t have the time. And they all know what she’s going to say anyway. Mike is family. She won’t fire him, no matter how late he is or how much he fucks up. It’s her one Achilles’ heel as a theatre owner. She loves her crew, and she’s loyal to them, and most of the time, that’s a huge asset, but sometimes that loyalty is misplaced, or abused, and it takes a long time for her to see this sometimes.
John smiles to himself and shakes his head. “Sometimes I think you’re actually psychic, you know.”
John quite intensely for no logical reason. He craves John’s self-contained stillness, that’s true, and sometimes he wants to crack him open and crawl inside him to find that unruffled calm and smash it to bits or else absorb it entirely into himself, but if he really wanted to destroy John, he could, and he finds he has no desire to do that.
The man follows him and looks around the room, obviously comparing the workstations. “They’re all the same,” he says, gesturing with his cane.
Donovan starts. “For this week’s decision, since it’s about who’s getting into the final, we looked not only at this week’s bake, but at the previous bakes as well.”
The oven dings, and he takes out his first try of the mini-pies with apple and poppy seed filling. He sets them down to cool and cuts and posts the video.
John grabs Sherlock’s arm and forces him to stop, to turn around and look at John. “Sherlock, what do we do if we’re really stuck here? You know, for good?”
John’s working steadily, introducing the eggs into the dough one at the time. He works with a concentrated frown that is very much unlike his usual ease. He’s got bags under his eyes, and every line of his body screams exhaustion.
John relaxes back against him, warm and trusting and sure, and suddenly Sherlock can see it perfectly. Small ceremony. Expensive suits. No jumpers in sight. Canapes, good champagne. Rings, worn on thin silver chains around their necks when they’re working with their hands all day. Promises that no longer scare him, that say
“For me?” Sherlock sits up, utterly surprised. “All of you?”
Sherlock thinks for a moment, then he says, “Creativity is important, but so is precision. Baking is a delicate balance; truly perfect bakes need perfect control.”
“When I was 26, I overdosed,” Sherlock blurts, out of absolutely nowhere.
“He cares a hell of a lot more than you did when you just abandoned us,” John points out, and finally, finally, he seems to come out of this strange, numb detachment, but all he feels is anger.
He loses track of time, as always. Before he knows it, the stage is dark, the lone green headlight illuminating him as he speaks the well-known closing words. He feels every eye in the house on him, and none of them matter as much as John Watson’s, who is waiting in the wings, smiling with the obvious excitement of live performance that he isn’t yet cynical enough to hide.
He walks over to the table he’s commandeered as his own and hands Sherlock the script. “I’ve highlighted the cuts in a different colour for you, I figured it would be easier for you to know which lines to delete than the other way around.”
Sherlock smirks and pulls the gun out of his coat pocket. “Oops, I seem to have forgotten I still had this.”
“Another?” John asks, holding up a potato.
The oven dings and John gets up to get the scones out. They’re fluffy and gorgeous, and John plates up two and fetches the butter from the fridge.
John laughs quietly, and some of the sadness leaves him. “No, I’ll just tell a soppy story about my gran. People love soppy gran stories.”
Sherlock gets up when Mycroft does and holds out his hand, nearly trembling with nerves and suppressed joy. “You won’t regret this, Mycroft.”
John can’t help a small smile, because trust Sherlock to play semantics during a moment like this. “All right. Let me rephrase. Would you like to try that again, without the hyperventilation?”
John searches his face with his eyes for a second, then, apparently dissatisfied with what he’s found, he nods, turns and walks away without another word.
He concentrates on the feeling of it, trying to block out the rest of his body.
John shrugs. “You’d have to taste it. I can’t explain it rationally either. It’s more moist that way, and the ratio of cake and chocolate icing is better.”
Sherlock feels his cheeks stretch into what he’s sure is a slightly silly grin, but he can’t seem to stop smiling. He might get out from under his brother’s thumb and John is waiting for him at home. A good day.
“How is making a cake collapse the point?” Irene asks.
There’s a commotion in front of them, somebody apparently fell down, and a few people are leaning over them. Somebody jostles John from behind and shoves him into a boy roughly his age. John loses his balance and trips, falls down to the ground. Sherlock is there two seconds later, pulling him up. “You all right?” he says, brushing the dirt off John’s jacket efficiently.
“What?” John asks, trying to get a deep breath through his panicked lungs.
“I think we’ve stretched this metaphor about as far as it will go,” Sherlock says, unable to keep the amusement out of his voice.
It’s brilliant, and he hates that he didn’t think of it. He needs to step up his game. Fortunately, the technical doesn’t count for much, and his showstopper is going to be fantastic, so he can still win this round.
Sherlock wakes in a nondescript hospital room. He’s curled on his side to take pressure off his bandaged back, and he hurts everywhere.
And then he leans in to kiss John. It’s intense and consuming and John has never, ever been kissed like this by anyone else, like the world could end and it wouldn’t matter as long as the kiss continued. John gets his hands under Sherlock’s shirt, running them along his back, and Sherlock bites John’s lips. slides a thigh between his legs, and the kiss tips from intense to dirty, hot, single-minded and only going one place.
Sherlock is quiet for a bit as he thinks about it. It’s… not a completely terrible idea. Especially given the platform he has right now. Bake Off is astonishingly popular, apparently.
“Thank you, but it’s ridiculous that I co-won with Sherlock. My bake was perfect, and much more difficult than Sherlock’s. His bake shouldn’t have been classed together with mine.”
“Could it be?”
“Yeah, right. That’s why you’re leaning against me like you’ll fall over any minute, and that’s why you’re dropping half your syllables when you talk.”
Quiet settles over the car. It’s a cool night. The warmth of John and the soothing cadence of his breathing is lulling Sherlock into a doze.
"Telling me that you told me so isn't going to actually get you anywhere," Janine points out, unfazed by his bad mood. "You need to talk to your brother. Tell him to give you control over your trust fund or we'll drag him to court."
Sherlock stays quiet, waiting for John to decide whether he wants to speak, sick with hope and apprehension.
In the doorway, he turns back again. “Wait a tic, you two’s the blokes who came through the Gate, like, a few weeks ago, right?”
This shouldn’t surprise him, logically, but it does. He’d sort of thought that John would… wait for him, somehow. But since John didn’t know Sherlock would come back waiting for him to do so would have been entirely illogical, though perfectly in character.
John pauses as a thought occurs to him he hasn’t had before. Maybe Sherlock really doesn’t remember him. Maybe Sherlock’s deleted him from his hard-drive of a memory, maybe John’s space in the Sherlock Holmes Mind Palace was taken up by a play, or a new boyfriends, or several new boyfriends, or a wife, or husband, six children…
Sherlock turns around and tries not to be amused, tries not to find John charming and funny and oh so very attractive with his soft button-down shirt and his well-fitting jeans and fails on all three counts.
“Dull.”
John’s startled laugh is surprising but welcome. He looks at Sherlock, and Sherlock knows that they’re going to be alright. Not tonight. Not tomorrow. Not for a long time. But eventually. And something passes between their eyes, unspoken like the best of their moments, and in that moment he knows John knows too.
Billy tersely reports that nothing’s moving, and they settle in to watch. John starts eating the sandwich he picked up from the little shop next to the clinic, and Billy watches him hungrily until John gives him half.
Entirely unnecessary. Also, the Sacher isn’t the original, as you know very well.
John just nods, because when Sherlock puts it this way, he’s right, it’s obvious. “So Lestrade was here.”
Finally, they reach the road that used to lead to the village. It’s overgrown and in bad repair.
“This one is powidl,” John explains when he points at the one coated with poppy seeds and sugar. “This one is rhubarb-strawberry,” he gestures at the one coated with breadcrumbs and more sugar. “And this is dried pears.” The last one is coated with cinnamon and sugar. All three turnovers are covered in icing sugar. John has poured a liberal amount of melted butter over the lot.
“Crowdfund.”
John rubs a hand over his face and sighs. “Fucking hell, I hate this,” he mutters and turns to Sherlock, obviously not deterred from having this out, no matter how deeply uncomfortable it makes both of them. “Sherlock. How serious were you about this whole ‘no dinner’ thing?”
They kiss again in Nice.
Two women are seated next to each other on seats that seem to grow out of the tree trunk, and one of them gets up as they enter. She nods at John, and John recognises her immediately. “Lya!”
They're somewhere near Slough when John asks, out of nowhere, "So what was my mistake?”
Sherlock briefly looks up from the microscope, then re-focuses on his work. John drains a glass of water and puts another down next to Sherlock.
John clears his throat. “Sherlock’s got a fitting in half an hour.”
“Then stop to think before you act. Just for one bloody second,” John says. “Please.”
need you. I need you healthy and happy and with me for as long as we both shall live, you enormous idiot, and as far as I’m concerned, Baker Street Theatre can burn to the ground tonight, and every other night until you are well enough to get out of this bed. And you will stay in this goddamned bed until I or a trained health care professional says otherwise. Or  so help me God I will tie you to that bed, and this time you won’t like it.”
“Baking is easier because it’s more precise,” Neela agrees.
John laughs. “That’s the spirit,” he says and herds Sherlock out of the door in the direction of the tent.
“All the more reason to get out of here,” John says and pushes the lift button repeatedly.
John is leaning against a nearby tree and reading something on his phone. When he sees Sherlock, he grins and gestures with his phone. “Listen to this little gem from Moriarty’s blog: This week’s question concerns the right consistency of whipped cream and how to flavour it. When I was a child in rural Ireland, my greatest pleasure was helping my mother milk the cows and enjoying a glass of still-warm fresh milk.”
“Not an option.”
Later, when the director has dismissed them to a late lunch, and everybody’s dispersed, Sherlock goes back to John’s workstation and tastes his cake.
Finally, it’s Harry, who’s obviously drunk, who speaks up for the non-physicians at the table by yelling, “Enough already! Let’s cut the bloody cake before the rest of us fall asleep!”
Each of them has a three-tiered cake stand on a large table that they’re supposed to fill with their bakes.
The attraction is obvious. The spark, the chemistry, the
Molly sticks a candle into the cake, and they all sing the obligatory birthday song, most of them falsely. John blows out the candle, everybody claps. Then John cuts into the cake and goes quiet.
John thinks of how to best phrase what he wants to know. “Do you think they’re… good?” he finally asks, making a face even as he says it, knowing he sounds like a child.
“Doesn’t matter.” Mrs Hudson waves away the point with a dismissive gesture.
Their eyes meet, and Sherlock suddenly realises he’s done waiting. He reaches out and traces a finger over the soft ridge of John’s left ear. It feels just about as divinely good as he thought it would. “Sunburn,” he says, softly.
Sigh.
He's on his way to his car when he sees John sitting on a bench in the parking lot. He lost sight of John in the commotion after their joint victory. John looks tired, frustrated and sad rather than triumphant, and he's fidgeting with his cane and rubbing his leg, oblivious to Sherlock's presence. There's a duffle bag at John's feet that looks heavy.
His phone dings. YouTube comment notification on the weighing and measuring video.
“You know,” John continues, not looking at him, taking off his glasses and fiddling with them, “for the longest time, I didn’t believe it. There was no body, so you couldn’t be dead. I even had this long row with Lestrade and Mycroft about the funeral, because I knew you’d think it stupid to hold a funeral for an empty coffin.”
“Not everybody has a trust fund, you know,” John points out a bit grumpily.
The next thing Sherlock is aware of are gentle hands on him, untying him, catching him when he can’t stand, cradling him carefully.
“It’s simple chemistry. Over-whipping the cream causes the structure of the foam to collapse. The air you’ve whipped into the cream evaporates and the cream curdles into milk fat.”
“It’s all right.” John turns to Sally. “He and I started at Baker Street Theatre at the same time. We had a steady cast of actors that season, so we were always rehearsing the next play while performing in the evenings with the same cast, and it was… well, intense. Sherlock was…” John trails off, lost in memory.
“Predictable. She’s a solid baker, but the time for solid baking has passed.”
“You do realise the sandwiches in the catering tent will probably be soggy, nearly tasteless and salmonella-infested?”
“Don’t get them started, we’ll be here all night,” John says.
“Jim, strong second place.”
He lifts his shirt and she examines his bruises again. “Looks about as well as was to be expected,” she says, probing gingerly with her fingers, making John wince. “Sorry.”
Sometimes he feels bad for reveling in Sherlock’s loneliness, his friendlessness, the void that is his life.
“I think she used the same tent company,” John says, nudging Sherlock with his foot. “Where to with the cake, Maestro?”
“Yes, Daddy is sick, but Daddy very much wants us to leave him alone. Say good night, darling.”
And god, that’s true. He wants, wants to feel Sherlock inside of him, wants to have him underneath him and completely gone with pleasure, wants to claim him and own him and never let him up for air.
“As long as we can count on you both to be impartial.”
John grins back, irrepressibly. “Oh, God, yes.”
Sherlock arrived late for breakfast and is in a rotten mood, so John leaves him alone to get himself out of it.
Sherlock looks up and realises that he has no idea how much time has passed. John has finished his scone and put his plate and cup away in the dishwasher. His phone is on the table, and it looks like he’s been checking his emails. “Of course you can go upstairs, what a stupid question.”
Sherlock works steadily, peeling and cutting apples into bite-sized pieces. The room is oddly quiet, only the hosts are moving from station to station, asking the bakers a bit about themselves and what they’re baking.
“What are we supposed to test?” Janine asks, sinking her fork into the pie.
“Yes, but I'm afraid I miscalculated somewhat, so I’m going to have thirteen identical cookies.”
Pics or it didn’t happen.
“Strawberries.”
“Irene, would you start?”
Sherlock reaches for his laptop and goes to work.
John looks at him expectantly and waits.
Sherlock draws his notebook closer and jots down a few notes. “Any thoughts on what you’ll do for sweet?”
like it. You
He remembers the last time he saw John, Sunday evening after dropping him off at a convenient tube station. He offered to take John all the way home, but he said it wasn’t necessary. John just told him to pull over, and got out of the car, nodded at him in thanks and walked off, cane tucked under his arm.
“Have you slept at all?”
“What is he doing in Yemen?” Sherlock asks, even though the answer occurs to him two seconds after the question is out of his mouth. “Of course,” he says. “Doctors Without Borders, is it?”
He can hear John long before he can see him. The tread of his feet on the stairs is heavy, he favours his right leg. It’s five in the morning, just before dawn. He’s exhausted, just coming home from a night shift at Bart’s.
“And nobody’s heard from them since?” John asks, intrigued and a little spooked by the story.
Not that it matters whether John shows up or not. It’s better if he doesn’t, then Sherlock won’t have to deal with the repercussions of his possibly very stupid idea after all. Better to not have anything more to do with John than he has to. Better to put a bit of distance between them, no matter how good the sex is. He can get good sex anywhere; he doesn’t need John for it.
Then their oven timers go off, and they all abandon half-eaten sandwiches to ensure that their bakes remain edible.
It twists something inside John, three words filled with so much warmth and unspoken affection, and John wishes they were twelve again and he could crawl into Sherlock’s bed and it would mean nothing at all. But they’re not twelve any more, so he just closes his eyes and waits for sleep.
John, is that the chap from the show? The one you said was ‘complicated’?
“What about Sherlock?”
The gingerbread recipe seems fine at first glance. He leafs through the book and stops here and there to read recipes of things he’s never heard of. Buchteln. Powidl, yeast dough, custard. Sounds delicious. He grabs his notebook and starts jotting down a few ideas as he continues to leaf through the book. He finds the recipe for the Punschkrapfen John made, sees where John modified it (mostly by using far less rum). The apple and poppy seed pasties he made on Sunday are also in here, but as a sort of cake. The judges loved the combination of Austrian and Afghan flavours and influences, and Sherlock thinks privately that John should have won last week. He didn’t because of Moran, because Moran loved Moriarty’s pretentious little bite-sized pastries. But they weren’t nearly as interesting as John’s. The combination of poppy seed and apple is delicious, and Sherlock thinks he might try making little mini-pies for when he finally has his bakery, with interesting latticework.
He’s almost through his repertoire. He’s used ‘Well, I liked
With an effort, John calms himself. If he starts down this road, he’ll never get through the production. He reminds himself that the fact that Sherlock was this epic, wild, head-over-heels-world-spinning-heart-thumping-larger-than-life affair in his mind, doesn’t mean their relatively short relationship wasn’t some casual fling for Sherlock he remembers fondly but doesn’t hold any significance six years later. The way it ended does seem to suggest that all he’d been for Sherlock was a bit of fun and some extremely good sex.
“Probably,” Sherlock agrees. “I’ve observed that many people confuse nostalgia for their childhood with a general belief that life was simpler or easier or better then, simply because they were children and had all their needs catered to by adults whose job it was to look after them. Stupid, really.”
Then they turn to John, and there’s a pregnant pause. Sherlock looks at John and gives him a cooly professional, and entirely noncommittal nod. “Hello, John.”
Sherlock drops his gaze and contemplates his hands again. “Oh.”
Only not quite, because there seems to be a part of John’s that is still as much Sherlock’s as it always was, because John sticks around as much as he can with a fiance and a job and a life in which Sherlock is no longer the center but a fringe benefit. Important, yes, but he used to be John’s oxygen, and now he is merely his friend.
And later, when John takes Sherlock apart with his fingers inside Sherlock and his mouth around Sherlock’s cock, Sherlock isn’t quiet either.
“Obviously.”
Sherlock pauses, and starts a bit when he feels John’s fingers entwine with his. He doesn’t say anything, but the squeeze of his hands encourages Sherlock to go on. “Victor started backsliding almost immediately, and he sort of pulled me along, and we went right back to it as if nothing had happened. Most of our friends were junkies. We lived in a bad neighbourhood. Neither of us had a job or were especially close with our parents. No structure, no goals. Just overactive brains screaming how boring life is, both unable to find a more constructive outlet. It made it worse, in a way. That he understood so perfectly how boring everything was.” He pauses again, and John’s fingers tighten around his. The silence stretches, and Sherlock isn’t sure whether he wants to continue.
Irene’s strawberry sponge cake looks fantastic, and the judges love it. She beams and returns to her station confidently.
And it held firm and strong again only when he was chasing a killer with Sherlock Holmes through the dark streets of London.
One good thing about having so few contestants left is that the judgings are thankfully short.
John nods. “Want me to come with you?” he says, even though he’s dead tired, but he feels a bit uncomfortable letting Sherlock walk the night streets alone right now.
Sherlock thinks.
Sherlock is staring straight ahead. “Fey'a crystals... that's how the Gate is powered.”
“Cambridge dictionary defines a hallucination as an experience in which you see, hear, feel, or smell something that does not exist,” Sherlock quotes. “It doesn’t specify the hallucinator’s knowledge of the hallucination as a determining factor.”
“But it’s in Sydney.”
Sherlock hates pink.
Sherlock is so tired. He wants his violin and proper Earl Grey and Jeremy Kyle and the good dim sum from the place with the door handle. He wants Angelo’s and a candle. He wants Mrs Hudson’s scones and a good old-fashioned double homicide. He wants to insinuate that Lestrade is stupid and Lestrade’s good-natured eye-roll. He viscerally misses the smell of the tube. He misses his Belstaff. He wants to sit in his chair and watch John sit in his.
being John Watson.
John’s smile fades as he realises that Sherlock is serious. “You….”
John grins, locking eyes with Sherlock. “Like I don’t care whether I win the actual one.”
Checking what? -SH
“Of course she did,” John says. “Well then, I’m in the mood for soup anyway.”
"Anyway," John adds around a huge yawn, "everybody missed you."
Sherlock scoffs. “I was perfectly fine, you were overreacting. I was just tired.”
No such luck, apparently, because when Sherlock walks into the tent, John follows closely.
John checks his wristwatch. “Nine-thirty.”
When Sherlock’s done drinking, John sets down the cup on his nightstand and sits in his chair again.
He can hear some of the other contestants chuckle, mainly those who’d briefly stopped what they were doing to hear Sherlock’s answer.
“Me first,” Sherlock breathes, suddenly hungry and hot and wanting, and walks towards John. He grabs John’s hips and walks him back until John’s knees hit a chair and he sits down in it. Sherlock sits in John’s lap. John looks at him for a moment, clearly surprised, but when Sherlock kisses him, he kisses back, deep and greedy, running his hands up Sherlock’s thighs, over his arse, pulling him in, closer. It feels insanely good, John’s hands on his back, on his sides, John untucking his shirt and sliding his hands along Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock grinds down his hips against John’s, and John gasps into Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock can feel John grow hard against him, can feel his own erection straining against his trousers.
He rubs a hand over his face. Sherlock is nothing if not confusing. He’s watching John when he thinks John isn’t looking, then he’s flirting with Irene, then he shows concern for John and then snaps at him. John has no idea what Sherlock is thinking, but that’s nothing new.
When Billy’s done eating, he leans back in his chair. “Now, what’s this all about then? This one,” he gestures at Sherlock, “said you blokes need some information?”
Sherlock comes back to Baker Street after 959 days, and John is gone.
He pulls John back in for another kiss, number seven now.
“I don’t know yet,” Sherlock admits. “But it’s probably going to be stupid.”
“The day you’re asking stupid questions, so it could literally be any day of the week or year,” Sherlock answers immediately, he’s been down this road before, after all.
Sherlock blinks at their surroundings, disoriented after their interminable time in the elevator. He doesn’t quite feel like the same person who entered it just a few short hours ago.
Mrs Hudson looks between the two of them for a moment, scrutinising them with barely suppressed curiosity, then she apparently decides to act professionally and asks him about his bake.
“Sometimes a scone is just a scone, John. Not everything we eat needs to have a fond memory attached.“
If it were up to him, he would never mention Mary ever again. He knows John feels similarly, and since Rosie has no memories of her mother, she wouldn’t think to ask on her own. But everybody always asks about Rosies’ mum, and Sherlock hates that, almost as much as John does. It’s not even that Mary’s death is so difficult to explain without going into a whole lot of things that nobody needs to know about. It’s the assumptions people make about how John feels about Mary’s death, and how Sherlock feels about it. They assume John is devastated and Sherlock is being noble by helping the poor widower raise his daughter.
Promise?
Sherlock sets his phone down and busies himself with his equipment to stop himself from blushing.
Then John deliberately and slowly, without breaking eye-contact, kisses Sherlock again. “Stop thinking,” he says quietly against Sherlock’s lips.
John’s hands travel languidly over his body, curve over his arse.
“This is ridiculous,” he greets John when he comes in the door. “This so-called Doctor, Miss Hooper, insists I need to stay here for another day at least. I feel absolutely fine!”
“What did she take?” John asks, clenching his hands to stop them from shaking with barely suppressed excitement.
Mrs Turner turns to the camera. “Can’t argue with that.”
Irene’s cake is all right taste-wise, but her flower design is lopsided and her food-coloured sponge is overbaked.
John finally tears himself from the contemplation of his watch. “You want some tea, Billy? Sherlock?”
His phone vibrates with another text. This time it’s from John.
“Why don’t we meet at the station later?” John asks, and everybody agrees.
“Stay forever, then,” Sherlock says, drawing back to look at John.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Most of them are imbeciles who can barely tie their own shoelaces,” he says. “Come on, John!” He pulls at John’s arm impatiently.
“Will you stick to the script,” Sherlock says from off-camera.
The silence is absolute, save for the sounds of a forest at night. The hoot of an owl, the rustling of leaves as small animals forage for food. The steps of an underweight, tall, sixteen-year-old body on thick under-brush.
Moriarty gives the fakest smile Sherlock has ever seen. “None taken.”
John just stands there, a small frown line between his eyes, looking at Sherlock expectantly. He doesn’t point out that it’s the middle of the night, and he doesn’t ask what Sherlock wants and he doesn’t complain about Sherlock waking him up. He just stands there and waits for Sherlock to say whatever he wants to say.
“War? Weren’t that over when our folks first come here?” Billy asks, scratching his probably lice-infested head in confusion.
The killer puts two vials in front of Sherlock with a malicious grin. “One of those’ll kill you quick, like falling asleep. Other’s nasty stuff, will have you writhing on the floor like a drunk caterpillar.” He makes an inviting gesture. “Choose.”
He can’t say any of this to Mycroft. None of it would be considered a good enough reason to bake even as a hobby, let alone professionally.
“Time to go, Johnny boy,” Jim whispers to John and cuts him free from the tree. His hands and feet are still bound, and Jim all but drags him to the edge of the clearing, just outside of the circle of light created by the torches.
“What do we do now?” John asks, turning to face Sherlock. Their beds are on opposite walls of the room, but he can still see the outline of Sherlock’s profile in the moonlight coming in from the window.
But they’re in the middle of a case, and John was supposed to re-read the autopsy reports and fell asleep with them on his chest.
“I’m sorry about the cake. That was bad timing.”
John snorts, quietly amused. “Good to know.”
“Fucking hell,” he whispers and rests his forehead against the cool glass of the cab window.
John shrugs. “Five bakes in six hours. One of these will probably go wrong.”
“My sister is an alcoholic,” John says, quietly, into the darkness. Sherlock can feel his voice rumble in his chest that is pressed against Sherlock’s side, feels the breath ghost over his skin. “Has been since… I don’t even know. A long time. She’s been dry and not and dry and not so many times. In and out of rehab so many times.”
@janine_lawyered
Silence.
He’s never been good at sleeping. He only ever sleeps when there’s nothing more pressing demanding his attention, like a case or an experiment or even just an interesting line of thought worth pursuing.
“Is she right?” Sherlock asks, too exhausted to tiptoe around.
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock dismisses John’s concern with a wave of his hand. He gets up and starts cleaning up, more than a bit irritated when John starts helping him.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, but goes back to whipping his cream, but he knows he’s smiling and he somehow can’t bring himself to stop.
Sherlock is leaning against the back wall of the Shropshire hotel they’re staying at this week, a charmless fifties building without redeeming qualities.
Mary went home about two hours ago when it was clear that John would be made to stay until his blood tests came back. No sense in both of them being exhausted tomorrow.
“Shit,” John grits out. “What now?”
John stares at the little cake, stunned speechless. This is the first time Sherlock's even acknowledged his birthday.
“I’ve invited your young man as well,” she says sweetly, but with a hint of gravity in her voice.
“So you need money,” John finally says.
“Mrs Hudson said it won’t open,” John points out but he’s starting to dress anyway.
Nobody knows that Sherlock leans into him sometimes, just to brush their bodies together. Nobody suspects that they kiss, sometimes, randomly, for hours, mostly when something’s exploded, or when there’s nothing on TV. Nobody knows that Sherlock would willingly and readily die, kill, steal, and most importantly, lose, for John. Nobody knows that Sherlock occasionally listens to John, that he respects him, that he sometimes plays the violin for hours when John has nightmares, that he values John’s opinion of him, that John
“My room,” Sherlock pants.
John smiles at him, and there’s something in that smile, something
“There was an explosion. He hit his head and got a piece of wood lodged in his shoulder. The Fey’a stitched him up and gave him something to make him sleep, well at least I think they did because that’s what they did with me, but I think he has a concussion, because he was dizzy and threw up several times,” John explains, sitting down on the other side of the bed from the doctor.
He pushes John’s thighs apart and kneels between them without any subtlety, then he bends down and swallows down John’s cock as far as it will go.
Sherlock glances at the chess board on the phone. “You’ll be checkmate in three, you know that, right?”
“So, Sherlock, tell us a bit about why you bake.”
He doesn’t know what to say. He knows he would have panicked and made a fool of himself without Sherlock there, and he knows Sherlock knows it.
Wordlessly, they walk back to the hotel. They go back in, the warmth of the lobby stifling after the crisp, cold night air outside. They ride the lift in silence. Second floor. The lift doors slide open.
people do things, not just how. Mycroft had John figured out five seconds after they met. Sherlock did too, but he wouldn’t have considered manipulating John into a stubborn loyalty to Sherlock by reverse-psychologically trying to bribe him into betraying Sherlock. Mycroft plays John like an instrument every time they’re in the same room, and Sherlock both admires his skill and resents him for manipulating John, who, if Sherlock had his way, would have permanent immunity from being used as a weapon, or a bargaining chip, or a chess piece.
“Well, seems like you two get along really well?” Emma wiggles her eyebrows in a suggestive way.
“But you’re doing all his work.”
It’s six in the morning, and Sherlock is woken by the sounds of activity in the house. For a moment, he lies still, listens to the others moving around, bathroom doors opening and closing, the grinding of coffee beans from the kitchen, accompanied by the smell of fresh coffee floating upstairs. He turns his head and buries his nose in John’s hair. John smells of sweat and cheap shampoo and vanilla.  Sherlock is filled with a drowsy sort of contentment, lying here listening to the house wake up, feeling John’s chest rise and fall against his own.
“You’re here at 2:30 am for a three?”
John grins. “You’re really a glass half full kind of chap, aren’t you?”
Sherlock shrugs and finally takes a sip of his own beverage. "Tolerable."
John rolls his eyes. “Yes, you won. And we both know that’s all that matters to you.”
“How do you know?” Molly asks.
John swallows hard, taking the dress from Sherlock. He suddenly remembers the last time he saw his sister, cheek pressed against the buttons of her uniform as she hugged him tightly. “She can’t have been here long,” he says, knowing his voice isn’t entirely steady.
“I’ll take it to my grave. Promise.” John pauses a bit. “What can you tell from how I look at him?”
He doesn’t expect an answer, and yet he stares at his phone as if it holds the secrets to eternal life.
He also knows that facing down death together and escaping by the skin of their teeth made him almost psychically aware of John in a way he wasn’t before. Also, John has some qualities that Sherlock obviously lacks, patience, practicality, common sense, which make them a very good team in every way.
Sherlock frowns, because he was pretty sure he’d locked that door behind Wiggins. He cautiously peers out through a small gap in the swing doors that lead to the kitchen.
So far, Mrs Hudson hasn’t made him go. It’s obvious she feels sorry for them, especially for Sherlock, and John thinks it a bad sign that Sherlock doesn’t even notice her friendliness is mostly pity.
One of those nights, he went to John’s bedroom. John has a stillness about him, something eternally calm and quiet, something untouchable and unchangeable, an anchor, a mountain, something to rest on and cling to and hide inside. And that night, Sherlock craved that stillness, that quiet, that calm, the kindness and generosity with which John took Sherlock to his bed, no questions asked, no explanation necessary, even though he knows exactly what Sherlock is and what he is capable of.
John shrugs, tries for a smile and fails. “Well. You told me from the start. My own fault.”
John runs a hand over his face. It’s the middle of the night and he has no idea what Sherlock is talking about. “What?”
It’s not Mycroft, though. It’s a new comment on his YouTube video:
Their lips are already parted when they meet. It’s a good kiss – it should be, it’s the fifth time they kiss, after all - real and solid and breathtaking, hot and heavy. John’s lips are soft and wet and feel amazing against Sherlock’s. John’s hands are in his hair, and Sherlock is gripping at John’s clothes, holding him in. His heart is beating wildly, and he thinks that right now he could defy gravity and actually fly.
Then Sherlock presses him against the door and covers John’s entire body with his. He leans in, breath ghosting over John’s lips, but not kissing him. He entwines their fingers and leans his entire body against John, so they’re pressed together from thigh to chest. Sherlock draws back a bit, and looks at him, searching and hesitant. “Tell me what you want,” he whispers against John’s lips.
And yet.
When he gets home, it’s still three hours until Mr Chatterjee and Janine are due.
Sherlock still sounds so very, very calm. “I know. But I also know that she’s pregnant with your child, and that’s not going anywhere.” He pauses ever so slightly, then continues, softly, barely audibly. “And I also know an act of desperation when I see one.”
He’s scribbling out complex formulae on the walls with thick permanent marker. He writes over the papers tacked to the walls, the cold cases, crime scene pictures, newspaper articles, pages of chemistry textbooks, all firing his synapses with tiny sparks of input, setting off a reaction of deductions and inferences and information. It’s glorious.
Finally, Sherlock can’t take it anymore, and even though it’s the most obvious thing to say, he asks, “Can’t sleep?”
He snakes his hands along the waistband of John’s jeans, along his hip bones, up his back underneath his jumper, seeking skin. John growls into his mouth, and starts unbuttoning Sherlock’s dress shirt, not breaking the kiss. Sherlock shrugs out of his jacket and shirt when John is done with the buttons and tugs at John’s hideous jumper. It lands on the floor, together with John’s t-shirt.
John huffs a laugh, easy and amused and so very, very charming, and Sherlock wants to taste that laugh, wants to chase it into John’s mouth with his tongue. “Glad it’s over?” John asks, still smiling at him.
“What are you thinking so hard about?” John asks, warm and fond.
“I’m not sure he can walk,” John answers, gesturing at Sherlock, who’s only upright because he’s leaning against John.
Sherlock puts a hand on his shoulder, both to calm him down and to restrain him. “Don’t be stupid, Billy, it’s just a dead body. It can’t hurt you. I’ve got a business proposition for you.”
And Sherlock answers, silently,
“Sherlock! Wait up.”
Sherlock should hate her, really. And he does, he hates her for touching John, for taking him away, for being good for John. At the same time Sherlock should love her, because she held John together with her bare hands, because she’s tough and brave and kind and carries a bag of heavy secrets. And Sherlock does love her. Which is why he doesn’t destroy her, doesn’t use every trick in his repertoire to get John away from her, because John, damn him, is happy. John has moved on.

They arrive at a large double door, and Sherlock knocks.
“Last time I did this play it was four years ago and I make less mistakes than you, even though you’ve done it every day for the last five weeks,” Sherlock points out. “And you’d better forget everything Jim told you about me. You’d also better decide now whether or not to quit in solidarity, since you’ve been clearly thinking about it, as it would be incredibly boring to have to do all the work we’re doing now again. And, you should mention to John that you’re allergic to strawberries, he won’t buy strawberry cake next time if he knows.”

“Our first Star Baker…. is actually two Star Bakers. The judges couldn’t quite agree, therefore we’re awarding Star Baker to Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.”
“Anything?” John asks, keeping his voice low the way people sometimes do at night when everything is silent and they don’t want to disturb any ghosts.
Sherlock shrugs, looking only slightly abashed. “I was only going to have a look around. He caught me a few hundred metres from the house. He knew I was coming and he was waiting for me.”
Sherlock goes from asleep to alert in 0.3 seconds and is out of the bed and up the stairs in less than two.
John comes back for the judging and doesn’t look at Sherlock, doesn’t even glance in his direction, he stares straight ahead and the
Sherlock has ever wanted there with him.
Mrs Hudson’s Big Ben clock strikes the half hour. Sherlock rummages around in the kitchen. Rosie sighs in her sleep over the baby monitor.
Moriarty smirks. “You’ve kind of shown your hand there, Sherlock. Now I’m doubly motivated.”
To say that the last four hours were gruelling would be an understatement. He hasn’t slept at all, and from the look of him, neither has John. The fun, light, joking atmosphere in the tent is gone, suffocated under the silence between their two workstations. John hasn’t looked at him once the entire day, and it’s glaringly obvious to anyone that something has shifted between them. The only person who seems to be unaffected by this is Moriarty, who’s been smirking smugly into his bake every time Sherlock has glanced in his direction. Sherlock almost wishes he cared, but Moriarty’s smugness is like a pinprick compared to the silence from John’s workstation.
It takes a while for Billy to calm down, but when he finally does, he puts a comforting hand on John’s shoulder. “Seriously, though,” he says, and John looks up, because Billy sounds genuinely serious. “Why do you think two boys having sex is wrong?”
“At this rate, the cake will go stale, and neither of us will win,” Sherlock mutters under his breath, but loudly enough that Mrs Turner can hear him.
He approaches the table hesitantly. Everyone else is already there, including a petite blonde woman Sherlock doesn’t know but who’s so obviously related to John that it can only really be Harry. She looks very little like her childhood self he remembers from the picture in John’s recipe book, but the resemblance between her and John is still strong enough to mark them as siblings.
Sherlock gets up and holds out his hands, and John grasps them and pulls himself up. When they just stand there, hands clasped, Sherlock is oddly reminded of how he taught John to dance, John’s hand sweaty in his, John’s insecure little laugh, the way he bit his lip in concentration, unaware that Sherlock’s heart was hammering out of his chest two feet away from his own.
“Let’s go back.” There’s something in John’s voice, dark and intense, and Sherlock shivers a bit, and not from the cold.
He can still feel it, all that ugly, dark, heart-rending grief he carried around with him for the last two years. And the fact that he knows Sherlock is alive doesn’t make it go away. On the contrary, it only makes it worse because it was entirely pointless. It’s a bit like the scar in his shoulder. The bullet is out, but the wound was real and it still hurts when it rains.
And all the while, Sherlock is so bored he can barely keep a straight face.
Moriarty glares at all of them. “We’ll see how funny you find all of this when I win without fucking a co-contestant.”
Greg sighs. “About the rehearsal…”
Sherlock waves a dismissive hand. “That was a mistake. Apologies,” he says coolly, his entire body one rigid line of tension that wasn’t there a moment ago.
“I want to state that I’m the dissenting voice this week,” Moran states. “I see Sally and Greg’s point, but I disagree with their conclusion.”
“Definitely.”
“I-" she hesitates just for a second. “I wanted to ask you to leave him alone,” she finally blurts out. “You don’t know what it was like, when you were - well, when we thought you were dead.”
John trails kisses down Sherlock’s neck, hands already at his belt buckle. He bites at Sherlock’s throat, and Sherlock wants more, now, now.
“Like I was shot,” Sherlock mutters, rolling his eyes a little at the general stupidity of the question, a point which John is willing to concede. “What time is it?”
John shudders and turns, pulling Sherlock into a sleepy, languid kiss. John’s sweaty and his morning breath is sour, but Sherlock doesn’t care, he kisses back with enthusiasm.
“Ahem… what are you doing?”
Sherlock swallows around a sudden lump in his throat, because somehow, that simple statement means a lot to him. Their two hosts have been perfect throughout, lightening the mood, showcasing their strengths, glossing over their weaknesses, mothering all of them indiscriminately, and being consummate professionals all the way through.
“You do realise it’s a wish, not a statement of fact, right?” John asks, and sets down the duffle bag at his feet.
Mycroft shrugs. “You said to give him something to do.”
John looks at him oddly, then grins. “I don’t have your phone number, genius.”
“A what now?” John asks.
“You miss the war?” Sherlock asks, keeping his tone carefully neutral.
And suddenly, Sherlock is five years old, running his fingers over the cracked formica table top in their giant, cavernous kitchen. He’s mixing eggs and sugar with a hand mixer, and his nanny - her name was Peggy and Sherlock adored her - helps him crack in the eggs. Cinnamon, sharp and somehow still sweet. Nutmeg, Peggy lets him grate it, telling him to watch out for his fingers. Flour, he gets to spoon it in while Peggy folds. Into the oven, and he sits and watches it rise while the smell of caramel fills the kitchen. They eat the sticky toffee pudding out of the tin, still warm, dipping the chunks of the sponge into the sauce. It’s delicious and altogether forbidden and they grin at each other over the breakfast counter, co-conspirators.
“No ego problems here,” Mrs Turner says into the camera, and Sherlock can hear John huff a little laugh in amusement.
Sherlock is watching him closely. “Unlikely, though remember that time passes much more slowly in our world, meaning she could theoretically have arrived before we did.”
The twelve workstations have already been prepared. Oven, KitchenAid, two hot plates, workspace, fridge and freezer.
Sherlock, who looks awful, pale and tired, doesn’t answer, he just sits down on his bed wearily.
John nods, abashed, and Mary pulls him in for a hug. “Now go find a corner to sleep in, you enormous idiot, or I’ll knock you unconscious with a moving light.”
Sherlock drops his eyes again. “I lost the Lodestone.”
The car stops, and John gets out into the cold night air, and with a last nod, he acknowledges that Mycroft is right.
“What happened?” he asks without preamble.
Not that he necessarily thinks that admitting it would be a problem.
John isn’t amused and delighted, he’s gutted and so very, very angry, and as the night progresses, and they get thrown out of increasingly shabby restaurants, he’s no less gutted and no less angry.
Guests are already milling about, greeting friends and family. Irene, Neela, Mary and Mike are standing in the shade under a nearby tree, with Mike’s wife and Irene’s girlfriend. Irene calls their names and they make their way over to join them.
Sherlock shrugs. “That doesn’t surprise me.”
“When? Where?”
They walk on in companionable silence. John leads them down a path that ends them up by a small lake. They stop at the water’s edge and look out at the lake, without speaking, and Sherlock feels oddly peaceful, oddly content in the moment. John picks up a few small stones and starts chucking them into the lake.
“Now we go look at the Gate,” Sherlock says, sounding, John’s pretty sure, more confident than he feels.
Seb scoffs. “Come off it.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer, but gives her a curt nod to show he’s understood, that he’s taking this seriously.
But Sherlock knows it isn’t the room. And it isn’t the bed, either.
“I once shared the stage with a sheep. The problem was that the sheep liked the limelight, so one night I couldn’t get the bloody sheep off the stage. I towed, I pushed, it just wouldn’t move, so finally our props master went and stood in the wings and lured the sheep off with some kind of sheep treat. So I’m relieved and am just launching into my big monologue, when I hear a very loud ‘Baaaaah’ from the wings.” Adriana pauses for effect and the entire room is in stitches with laughter. “I open my mouth again. ‘Baaah’. The audience is roaring with laughter by this point, obviously. So I decide to hell with it, and I get my monologue out, and every time I hear ‘Baaah,’ I just speak more loudly. The audience members didn’t hear a word I said, but they had the time of their lives.”
He falls asleep with John's even breathing against his ribs.
Three entries.
Six years. It should make a difference that it’s been six years. Six years should have transformed John Watson into a footnote. A side note. A fleeting, fond remembrance.
Sherlock kisses him.
“All right. No, no, and no.”
John grins at him, predatory and wicked, and Sherlock swallows, desire making his skin tingle.
Sent: 4:47 am
When he comes out again with his bag, he meets John, who’s standing under the awning of the hotel’s front entrance, duffle bag at his feet, hands jammed into the pockets of his jacket, looking unhappily at the dark sky.
Billy looks between them, and seemingly decides something. “How the blazes did you get through the Gate?”
For a moment, his finger hovers over the call back button. He can still say no. He hasn’t signed anything. He can still back out. He should. He made a choice six years ago not to let emotion get in the way of making himself the best actor he can be.
“You’ll never guess,” Sherlock says with a confident smile.
“John.” Gently, carefully.
Mary gets up, then turns and gives John a hand up. “I’ll get started. You shower.”
“Bit freaky if you ask me,” Seb mutters.
“Of course, of course,” Mr. Musgrave says, gesturing around the room invitingly. “I’m somewhat of a scholar of local history, you know, and I’ve been showing Sherlock some of my findings. He was the first boy to arrive, and in the beginning we had only each other to entertain. Now of course he has you all for company, which is infinitely better.”
He takes a deep breath and walks out into the rehearsal room to face another fucking day of the nightmare this production has turned into.
“Not as such, no.”
He thought about saying the words so often, during these endless weeks and months of slowly regaining his place in John’s life.
“How long were you together?” Sally asks, watching John.
“I’m sorry,” John whispers, closing his eyes against the tears welling up again. “I’m just really scared.”
Finally, clothes are flying left and right and John tackles Sherlock to the bed, grabbing his hands and pinning them to the mattress next to Sherlock’s head. Sherlock’s looking at him like he’s the most brilliant human being in existence, and John’s heart is so full he can’t help himself. “I love you, you know,” he says softly, looking down at Sherlock, half-naked and wide-eyed and happy.
“Nine-thirty.”
“It’s just math, Mrs Hudson. Easiest thing in the world.”

John doesn’t cling. Not to things, and not to people. Most of the time, at least. He had next to nothing when Sherlock met him. No stuff, no people. No family.
John’s heart starts pounding wildly at the implication, and the look in Sherlock’s eyes. “Yes,” he says, his voice sounding as strangled as Sherlock’s.
“Well, I can only say that this recipe made my granddad propose to my gran, so it’s definitely a winner.”
“Ah,” John says and smiles. “Yes. That’s completely true, of course. It’s the thing that truly separates amateurs from professionals.  Consistent quality.” He carefully rolls out his scone dough and takes a knife out of a drawer to cut it into squares.
“Your sandwiches were amazing,” Sherlock points out. “Your cheese toasties were the best in London.” It’s difficult to keep the nostalgia out of his voice, and he knows as Mr Chatterjee watches him that they’re both thinking of the many times Sherlock came into Speedy’s, as a lanky university student, a strung-out junkie, a recovering addict trying to hide his shakes, and how Mr Chatterjee never asked for Sherlock’s order, just made him a toastie and very rarely let him pay.
“Oh, Jim,” Sherlock says, grinning openly now. “Who would have you?”
He walks away without looking back.
“Are you stage manager now, if he’s got some problems?”
John’s birthday is on his day off, but he spends most of it in the clinic. A building collapsed and ten people have been injured, and one person killed. He’s busy bandaging wounds, and assisting Dr. Sholto with an amputation until six that evening. When he's finally done, he’s exhausted, sweaty and feels sixty, not sixteen.
There's an audible pause and Sherlock can hear Janine pressing buttons on her mobile. "Added you to the contestant group chat and the extra one for John's birthday. Tomorrow from eight at the Anchor, it's a pub in Camden. Neela and Mary are coming up from Bristol especially, and Molly's in town as well."
Sherlock smiles. “Absolutely.”
John smiles. “About bloody time, too.”
Sherlock gets shot in Malta.
“So, John, what are you doing first?” Mrs Hudson peers at his list.
John tries to control the shaking. Breathe. In. Out.
He drags John into a side alley and together they watch as their pursuers run on, oblivious of the fact that their prey is gone.
John gives him a small, grateful smile, as if thanking him for not being an arsehole about this, and Sherlock feels a powerful urge to break every bone in the bodies of all the people who have ever been arseholes to John, ever. “Don’t do that,” he snaps.
John shrugs, and his smile fades a bit. “Nobody, really. Just me.”
“Irene and Moriarty?”
“Question is, what do we do now?” Lestrade asks. He reaches into his pockets for his cigarettes, then remembers the cardinal rule: No smoking in the office.
John is so tired. So very tired.
“What?” Sherlock asks as he picks up.
“John. Look at me.”
“I am not,” John says, automatically defensive even though he knows it’s true.
Any minute now.
“Touch yourself,” Sherlock pants, running greedy hands over John’s skin. “Let me see you. Let me feel you.”
They manage to catch up to the criminals, board the boat, overwhelm them, get a confession and find the treasure that belongs to their client. Altogether it’s an absolutely spectacular night.
Sherlock can’t answer, because something seems to have happened to his voice. There’s a lump in his throat and a knot in his chest, and somewhere between his voice is trapped. Finally, the pressure eases and he mutters, “Thank you.”
Moran shrugs and carefully doesn’t look at Moriarty, who is clearly seething.
I bet Moriarty could curdle cream simply by looking at it.
“Adrenaline is a mood-altering substance,” John says, but there’s mischief in his eyes and he can’t seem to help laughing at Sherlock’s outraged expression.
He never does this. He doesn’t feel randomly attracted to near strangers and thinks about kissing them.
John smiles a little. “John Watson, by the way.”
John grins back. “Unfortunately no, but I’m not sure how much the croissants really had to do with it, since she eventually went out with my sister.”
You’re welcome.
John laughs, and Sherlock can feel the vibration in his own body. It’s the best feeling he’s ever experienced in his life. “Merry Christmas,” John answers, then moves in for another kiss.
“Yes, please.”
John.
His phone dings again, and he sees that he’s got another like for the video. From John Watson.
Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock watches as John looks down and smiles, because Lestrade fails to mention that John was the DSM in question at the time.
Sherlock sits up and looks at him, and he has about half a second of satisfied glow until John opens his eyes and gazes at Sherlock, predatory glint in his eyes. “That’s a good look on you,” John whispers, pulling Sherlock back into his lap and kissing his swollen lips, moaning.
“Love what you've done with the place,” Sherlock says loudly, his voice carrying over the clearing over the hum of the Gate.
John and Sherlock turn as one to Moriarty, who’s standing in front of the judges and is practically vibrating with fury. “I’m a better baker than John Watson even when I’m sleepwalking. You’re letting your obsession with their stupid flirting cloud your judgement.”
John’s been half-dozing, but he perks up when he realises that Mrs Hudson is deeply uncomfortable. “What is it?” he asks.
“Pawn E2 to E4.”
Sherlock shrugs. “I just thought you’d moved on.”
She hangs up.
Then John growls, low in his throat, and their mouths meet in a hungry, desperate, all-consuming kiss.
Sherlock’s own bake is in the oven. The pumpkin-pistachio filling smells amazing, and the filo is browning perfectly.
John grins at Sherlock from his workstation, sweaty and floury and gorgeous. “Thank god, I’m starving.”
He re-checks his setting and goes over to the theatre once more to see whether everybody’s doing all right.
Sherlock ignores her and takes his dough off the heat. He slowly and methodically adds the eggs, stirs them in with practiced ease. He turns off the stove and lets the dough sit to cool.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and reaches for his phone. This is tedious.
John puts his hands up in a disclaiming gesture. “Okay, I’ll leave you to it. I’m just here to get-”
“So that’s where you’re hiding,” John suddenly says from behind him, and Sherlock starts visibly.
He also
“The content got lost among the fuckings,” John says, sitting up and rubbing his eyes. Every muscle in his body hurts. “Oh god, I need to stop sleeping here.”
“I don’t care what you did with other people when you were high. You. Will. Not. Do. This. With. Me,” John says, low and angry, smile completely gone now. “I will not be an experiment, Sherlock.”
He shakes himself out of his funk, trying to ignore the pressure under his breastbone, and refocuses his attention on Molly’s words, who’s giving him an update on the construction. Apparently everything’s going as planned. Don Anderson, their set designer, is in today, and he brought the wallpaper he wants to use. John’s had a meeting with him and Mary and Lestrade during lunch to settle on the lighting design, and another meeting with Lestrade and Dimmock to settle on which of the six annoying ringtones Dimmock selected they’ll use for Sherlock’s character’s phone.
Together, they rig the eggs so they’ll fall out and break on Moriarty’s shoes when he opens the fridge tomorrow. It’s going to annoy him, but won’t seriously interfere with his bake, because he can just get new eggs from the contestant store room where the BBC supplies them with staples like milk, eggs, butter, and flour.
“Come on, darling, let’s give Daddy some space,” he tells Rosie, who stopped crying when John started vomiting, and is looking at him with an almost academic fascination that Sherlock finds ridiculously endearing for the situation.
look. He concedes the point with a shrug, and John can see Sherlock’s relief in his smug smile.
“No trace of him so far,” Sherlock says and starts pacing again.
Quickly, he positions himself by the back door and takes off his shoe, then flings it against the dilapidated shed as hard as he can. The noise isn’t as loud as he’d like, but it’ll do.
John smiles at him and pecks another kiss on his cheek. “Wake me at eleven? And save me some strudel.”
Sherlock doesn’t move. He bends his head to nose along John’s throat, enjoys John’s hitched breath, the way his body squirms, trying to get away from Sherlock, but Sherlock grabs hold of John’s wrists and pins him there, against the wall.
The jurors then grow serious again and eliminate Mike, which surprises nobody except Janine, who clearly thought she was going home today.
John smirks. "No, it hurts like hell."
There are a few superficial reasons why he and John click. There’s the obvious and shallow fact that they’re both severe adrenaline junkies with near-suicidal reckless streaks. There’s John’s admiration for him and their mutual obsession with crime-fighting and catching bad guys. There’s John’s intelligence, and his capacity as a fighter. There’s the fact that John’s the only person who’s ever bothered to rush after Sherlock into the darkness to drag him out again. Also, John’s killed for him, and they both know it, and this fact alone would be enough to explain their partnership to anyone who isn’t Sherlock.
“Sherlock?” John asks after a short silence.
They drive to Kiev from Rome. It takes them two days. They spend the night in a trailer park in Hungary. It’s practically deserted - it’s a rainy Wednesday in April - and the trailer creaks with every move they make.
“Oh. Well. You’re welcome.”
John goes back upstairs to deal with his patients. He’s selfishly hoping for a hellishly busy day so he won’t have to think about any of this for a few hours.
John gets up and fetches a glass of water from the pitcher on their dresser. He hands it to Sherlock so forcefully he spills a little on Sherlock’s shoes. “Drink, for God’s sake, before you pass out.”
Three workstations have been erected, identical to those in the tent, but with an extra kitchen block to give them more space. Sherlock can see even from a distance that his is in the centre, John’s to the left and Molly’s to the right.
John snorts, amused, and Sherlock flashes him a quick grin.
“Our technical challenge this week is a British classic: Battenberg cake.”
“The Gate,” Sherlock says, impatiently running a hand through his curls. “It should have been obvious much sooner!”
“You saved his bake today.”
Sherlock feels himself smiling back almost automatically. “Let’s say the line to inedible remains firmly uncrossed.”
Finish your sentences, John. -SH
“Don’t worry about it.” John lets down his shirt as she straightens. “All right, I’m off then. Thanks for everything, Molly.”
“Me, of course.”
“Tale as old as time, I suppose. Man works too much and gets divorced. Wife moves away, takes children. Man starts drinking.” John smirks humourlessly. “Bit of a cautionary tale, really.”
John turns around and winds his hands into Sherlock’s hair, kissing him, dirty and open-mouthed and single-minded, and the food gets very cold indeed.
“Do you want me to do it again?” Sherlock asks, staring at John, a challenge in his eyes.
Sherlock’s phone vibrates.
Mycroft smiles thinly, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Sherlock isn’t entirely heartless. I am.”
John smiles. “Looking forward to it.”
John snorts. “Well, we can’t all live on nicotine patches and air. And don’t pretend that you’re not going to start stealing my chips any second now.”
Sherlock watches out of the corner of his eyes the way John handles the yeast dough, and the competent surety with which he moves, the strength and precision of his hands, and the way he only leans on his cane very lightly, very occasionally. His workstation is a complete mess, and the way he just reaches into the flour to add it, instead of carefully measuring it, sets Sherlock’s teeth on edge, but there’s no question that John knows what he’s doing.
He knows the second Sherlock sees him, because his face lights up in a way that makes John’s heart twist and beat faster. They’ve been together for two and a half years - well, if you don’t count the hiatus - and they’ve been married for a year and a half of those, but Sherlock hasn’t lost the ability to quicken John’s pulse merely by looking at him, and John fervently hopes he never will.
John swallows, and hates himself for how much he wants Sherlock to not go. “Could you…” he begins, but can’t finish the sentence around the lump in his throat.
“My granny used to make this extremely heavy coconut cake for all our birthdays, and last year I made it for my cousin’s wedding and she bloody cried.” Neela takes a sip of her pint and grins. “It was embarrassing.”
“Fine.”
John pulls Sherlock to his feet, and they dress themselves as neatly as possible under the circumstances. Sherlock picks up John’s glasses from the floor and finally examines them (-1.0 right, -0.75 left, antireflective glass, impression marks seem to indicate that John only wears them rarely – reading, work, computer monitor -  frame type ten quid Marks & Spencer, plastic, infinitely replaceable – conclusion: Sherlock needs to get John new frames.)
Sherlock nods and grabs his notebook. “I need more detailed feedback than ‘good’.”
“Good.” John gets up. “I’ll go get the rehearsal room ready.”
“Don’t be absurd, Molly, you’ll be completely fine,” Sherlock says, patting her shoulder, knowing he looks awkward and unpracticed.
His room is on the first floor, and he’s just making his way down the corridor to look for his room number when a door opens. John steps out, obviously surprised to see him there. “Hey,” he says with a slightly nervous smile. The door to his room swings shut behind him and bounces back without closing.
John looks at Sherlock, who just looks grimly focused now. “Let’s go.”
Sherlock is gone, the kitchen table is spotless, and the cook is making a fire in the Aga to cook a large portion of porridge for the children.
There are days John wishes it was nerve damage.
he thinks.
They all nod, and with a kindly smile, Mr. Musgrove sends them off to the dining hall, a large, elegant room with a crystal chandelier that looks decidedly odd paired with several plain wooden tables and chairs that serve as the boys’ dining and school tables.
“You know, for the longest time, I wasn’t sure that you actually like him,” Lestrade finally says, slowly, carefully.
The challenge for next week is desserts, and Sherlock has decided on a creme brulee souffle.
“To get your brain to stop eating itself when you try to sleep?” John suggests.
“Fine.” He doesn’t point out the fact that she should have gone through his agent, because he appreciates the time constraint, and also, if she’d gone through his agent, he would have been almost forced to say no.
Moran takes a second bite of the cake and looks thoughtful. “Can I have the recipe for the spice blend?” he finally asks, and everybody laughs as the tension in the room breaks.
How bout tat threesome
Sherlock nods his thanks and starts leafing through the pages.
And maybe it’s none of that, maybe it’s the ticking clock in his head, counting down the last minutes he gets to spend in the same room as John Watson.
But then he hears the unmistakable sound of a hand mixer scraping over the bottom of a plastic bowl and suddenly he knows where John is and what he’s doing.
“Morning,” John says, sticking his head in. “You got a moment?”
John goes still, and Sherlock pulls back. For a moment, they just look at each other, quietly, and that’s another thing about John Sherlock appreciates, his ability to be absolutely, completely still. There’s something in John’s eyes, though, something dark and warm, something that feels ever so slightly dangerous, like Sherlock has poked a tiger or teased a rattlesnake. It’s wonderful. It makes him tingle all over. He moves back in, to taste that danger some more, but there’s a finger over his lips, and John shakes his head.
John thinks hard about turning around and going back to sleep.
“Now will you admit that drinking Anderson under the table was a bad idea?” John asks, voice muffled against Sherlock’s coat.
Sherlock lifts his head from where it’s resting on the back of the uncomfortable green room sofa, and catches Mycroft’s eye. His brother looks bored and out of place, but he’s here, and Sherlock gives him an appreciative nod, which Mycroft returns.
Moriarty’s done what he calls a “deconstructed” apple pie, he’s cut pastry into the form of maple leaves and put the apple filling on top, then glazed it with maple syrup. He’s looking very proud of himself, and Moran loves it, but it’s clear from the looks on Lestrade’s and Donovan’s faces that they think it’s stupid, though they only say it’s off-topic and tastes a bit bland. Moriarty looks furious when the judges move on, and Sherlock smiles to himself.
John laughs a little hysterically, relief and adrenaline making him light-headed. “Thank you.”
The doctor is holding a candle in front of his eyes now and asking him to follow the light. Sherlock manages to roll his eyes but he complies, and the doctor appears satisfied.
The food porn shots take longer than usual today, and they’re all standing around outside the catering tent, hungry and cranky and cold.
Except tonight. Because the moment he picked up the saline solution, the moment he put bow to strings, his mind started going through all the steps he has taken to lead him inexorably to where he is now, somehow watching John Watson break apart under a weight he doesn’t even know about, and not being able to do a thing to stop it.
Now they’re sitting together backstage, actors and crew. Lestrade’s done with his notes, and they’re all having beers and relaxing. They’re regaling each other with the weirdest moments in their theatre lives.
“What’s obvious?” John asks, a bit bewildered.
In her office, Molly offers him a seat and a cup of tea. John gratefully takes both.
“It wasn’t that bad, I suppose. It just...” Sherlock sighs and runs a hand through his hair, messing it up still further than it already naturally is. “It’s so very, very dull. School, I mean. Until the war broke out, Mummy taught Mycroft and me at home. Then Mycroft went off to Oxford and Mummy had to do her bit for the war effort, and I was shipped off to boarding school. At first I thought it would be a great challenge, to have other teachers beside Mummy. But I soon discovered that most of them knew less than I already did, and those who knew more taught subjects I didn’t care for. It was hell, trying to pretend to care for Shakespeare and dreary old history. Math, Chemistry, Physics, Latin, Greek, were hell likewise, because I had to sit through hours of teachers explaining -badly - things I’d learned years ago, and sometimes they taught things the newest research had already disproved. When I argued with them, I was given detention. It was so, so very dull. And the other boys hated me, for knowing more than them, for being uninterested in sports, for outperforming them without even trying. So I started to sneak out of my dorm room at night to read in the library, or experiment in the chemistry lab. One day, I feel asleep over the Bunsen burner. The fire really was very minor.”
“How do you mean?” John asks, sitting up a bit straighter, because this seems like a conversation he should be moderately alert for.
John freezes when he sees it’s Sherlock, who’s about to go into his dressing room.
“Watson should have been disqualified. English High Tea and he serves something our judges can’t even pronounce.”
“Bloody hell.” Mary takes away his beer and pulls him to his feet. “You need something stronger than beer. Come on.”
He picks up his bag and turns to Mary, who’s watching him warily, silently. She hasn’t said much since they caught up with her. John doesn’t blame her. There doesn’t seem much to say.
Sherlock shrugs. “Did you ever have the urge to do something stupid and self-destructive? You were the least stupid stupid thing I could think of.”
“Holy mother of god,” he whispers at what he sees.

Nobody knows that sometimes, late at night, Sherlock comes to John’s bed, cold and pale and obviously lonely without even being aware of it. He tries to be quiet every time, but John always wakes up, and Sherlock always notices. Sherlock reaches out a hesitant hand, and John pulls, and they touch each other with ever more steady hands, quietly, the only sounds muffled moans against each others’ lips. Afterwards, Sherlock always falls asleep almost in spite of himself, in John’s bed, tips of his fingers brushing John’s side, and John watches him for hours until he falls asleep himself. When he wakes up, Sherlock is always gone.
“First, because we don’t actually have the lodestone. And second, and I don’t believe I need to even say this: Because he’s a killer, we can’t ignore that,” John points out, trying to stay calm, but honestly he’s a bit worried by now.
John is two metres away from him right now, covered in flour and working at his Christmas pudding with a small frown of concentration between his brows. And it might be the last time Sherlock sees him sloppily weigh his ingredients and shrug at them with a ‘good enough’ sort of air, sweaty and covered in flour, smiling inanely, humming out of tune while he works. It’s painful, how much Sherlock loves every imperfect inch of him. It’s also distracting, and Sherlock forces himself to focus back on his bake, when all he really wants to do is soak up as much of John as he can, fix him into his mind palace so he has a place to visit him when it inevitably ends.
She grimaces. “Nothing good. New one, Grimy Joe, he found the bloke Holmes was lookin’ for.”
He tries to say something. He isn’t sure what comes out of his lips. His voice vibrates pleasantly inside his body, but the sound is indistinct and unidentifiable.
Sherlock looks down to hide his smile. "Yes."
John steps back, embarrassed. “Sorry,” he says, looking at the floor.
Silence. He can hear John breathing.
“Is he in costume?” Adriana whispers back, confused by Sherlock’s sharp dress pants and crisp shirt, a marked contrast to the jeans and ratty t-shirts the rest of the cast are wearing for rehearsals. John bites back a smile. For Sherlock, no suit jacket and the rolled-up sleeves of his designer shirt are casual wear.
“Well. Good luck with the show, Sherlock,” Mr Chatterjee says and rings off.
Mike calls the five for Act 2 beginners, and Sherlock goes through the stage door and steps into the wings. Anticipation makes his skin crawl because this is his favourite moment of the night.
The very idea of being homesick used to be ridiculous to Sherlock. Four walls and a permanent address aren’t things you miss.
John looks at him, a bit startled. But he says nothing as Sherlock pulls him in and kisses him, deep and dirty and suggestive.
