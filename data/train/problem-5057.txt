“I know our dear boy, Sammy,” Gabriel said, wiping his floured hands on the front of his apron. With no customers around he came from behind the counter and perched himself casually against the wall. “He and his brother stop by once in a while. You remember, Cassie, that cute little omega I was trying to set you up with—”
“Place looks like a madhouse,” Garth comments, voice filled with awe. “All those people there to see you?”
Sam grimaces at the description and Dean flexes his eyebrows, grinning. “It’s against the rules, remember?” he says, just to drive his point home. It’s been a were bylaw since the very beginning. Packmasters are always alphas. That’s just...the way it’s always been.
“No other family?” Castiel asked. The Keurig coffee abandoned, at some point during the last half-hour Castiel had fixed the kettle and made them both chai tea with milk and honey. Dean had insisted he wasn’t a “frou-frou drink” kind of guy, yet his cup of tea was almost gone…
“I never am,” Missouri said, eyes turned back to Joshua. “
Oh god. Castiel wished desperately to disappear into the floorboards.
Castiel 2:51 AM >>
“Sammy,” he croaks, daring to crack an eye open. Around them, the crowd has tripled—he sees Jo, Charlie, even Missouri watching them with worried expressions. “You okay?”
“What happens if you don’t make it?” Gabriel wonders. “Is that like…forfeiting? Would Papa Winchester automatically win?”
leisurely on the couch while the alpha paints. It’s a gorgeously peaceful and domestic scene that makes Cas feel warm and tingly all over, a rare moment of relaxation and contentment, and he realizes that nights like
“Onto step two of ghost patrol,” Dean said, and lifted an eyebrow towards the dance floor.
“You’re beautiful,” he said simply, honestly. “Let me take care of you.”
“Maybe it is,” Dean mumbles, his voice a low rumble, and wow, why can’t he stop staring at this guy’s lips? They’re just so pink. “Depends on the offer.”
“Do you think…I mean, was he trying to…”
“I am too. Jesus, Cas...I have no idea what I’m doing.” Dean pulled his head up for another kiss and Castiel obliged. “I just wanna be with you.”
happened?
Dean rubs his hips back experimentally, wondering what the friction might feel like, and is overcome with lust when he feels Cas’ hard cock rub against his ass check. He lets out a breathy moan totally by accident, and Castiel hands grip him tighter, traveling up his bare sides. “Dean…”
Castiel is tempted to ask when
The next half-hour goes much more smoothly than the first. Dean and Castiel are not only more comfortable with each other, but approve of the song choice, and they sound…well, pretty damn good together. He’s actually looking forward to tomorrow’s concert now, which is a complete one-eighty from his earlier attitude. Jesus, what a rollercoaster day.
“Nope, sorry. Unpaid, amateur, high school BFF editors don’t get bossed around, no matter how famous you are,” she said, looking up from the pages and crossing her arms. “Besides, dude,
other than his parents’ sex life, but he only nods in understanding, keeping his snarky commentary to himself.
commercial ads, after all.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Tempting offer, but the funeral is tomorrow and we need time to settle in.” He smiled encouragingly. “You’ll be fine, Dean. It’s just a quick flight.” Quick or not, they still had to
“Not with this,” Dean said quietly, and he sounded miserable and wrecked and Castiel knew he didn’t mean it. But it nearly broke his heart in half all the same.
Relief. Castiel is flooded with relief. So his brother hasn’t spent the last decade or so being tortured by demons. But then, that means the night of the demon war… “So how’d you get away?”
according to the bank, he got sick in the bar. They ushered him outside and he stumbled back to his room, woozy and disorientated, searching his pockets for the room key. Realizing he had locked himself out, he wandered to the front office. Everything that followed were delivered in flashes: the motel clerk cringing at the sight of him, Dean collapsing on the floor, suddenly clammy and fatigued, vomiting again without warning, the clerk asking him if he had someone to call, Dean muttering the only phone number he knew by heart...
“Put your elbows on the table. I’ll go get the lube, but—” Cas pulled Dean in for a rough kiss, teeth clashing and tongues circling, messy and debauched and
His eyes are hooded and imploring and his hand snakes steadily down, skimming the alpha’s chest and abdomen and then—
At the thought, Dean’s stomach turns… He’s here for a reason. They don’t have much time.
Castiel wants to point out that Dean isn’t giving him any slack, but he supposes being the bigger person means not pointing this out. “He’s miserable?”
“You’re sure?”
Silence stretched on again and Castiel felt himself grow uncomfortable...which was strange, considering they sat in a shed together practically every day and worked, side by side, without speaking. But this was different, Castiel supposed, because they had come here
Three days. He spent three days in a crappy motel in a highway town. Three days walking to the nearest dive bar and wondering if it was possible to drown himself in whiskey. He was only aware of the passage of time because he passed a bank on his way to the bar, the electronic billboard flashing today’s date in ornate cursive. He was drunk almost every hour of the day—anything less made him self-aware and lucid, and that was the last thing he needed. Each morning he would wake-up sore and almost sober and think things like
How could Cas possibly know about that?
here.” Castiel chuckled, the sound hollow to his ears. “It was awful. I was young, I had no plan. Just a backpack full of clothes, books, and a toothbrush. I spent the first few nights in homeless shelters, until two men approached me and…” He looked up at Dean, smiling weakly. “Let’s just say they didn’t approve of what they
None of this matters, though. Not when there’s a chance of having Dean’s lips back on his.
They're gonna be wild crazy AU fun!!
But Castiel pulled back and stilled his hands, somehow not on-board with the whole, get-naked-as-fast-as-possible plan. Dean was already breathing heavy, already half-hard simply from a few frantic kisses. Still, he willed his eyes open in search of answers.
Castiel couldn’t hear Joshua’s reply—he was speaking more evenly, his face turned towards the ornate waterfall. Whatever he was saying, though, Missouri was disagreeing vehemently.
Dean 2:53 AM >>
The man hadn’t seemed unusually open or outgoing, so Dean typed out words like “shy” and “timid” before shaking his head. No, that wasn’t right. He replaced them with “coy” and “kind” and “self-assured” and felt much better about that assessment. He mentioned his observation about the books, hypothesizing that Castiel was probably a grad student with a high reading workload, maybe something like English or Literature. His bizarre attire could make him an adjunct professor, sure, but Dean figured the trench coat was probably just a personality quirk. The kind of thing Castiel would wear regardless of the setting, ‘cause he was kinda badass and nerdy that way.
Jody sighs, and Dean imagines her planting her elbows on the desk, looking at him with concerned eyes. “That bad, huh?”
“Who? Cas?” Bobby nodded, so Dean took a deep breath, trying to find the words. “Nah, not snooty. He’s actually from around here. He’s, uh...interesting. I guess. Like no one I’ve ever met. Smart and thoughtful and annoying as hell sometimes. I like him, even though I hated him at first.” Bobby shot him an interested look, and Dean shook his head. “It’s a long story. Really fucking complicated.”
“I’m sorry to disappoint you, but...” Castiel’s voice dropped, low and rumbling. “I do not have a fancy ass boyfriend in New York with a loft apartment in a skyscraper.”
“Wait—you two were—” Dean gripped the sides of his temple, fighting a forthcoming headache. “You were both in Charlie’s case study too?”
the sunshine, can feel the brush of earth like a hand cupping his cheek. It’s calming in a way he’s forgotten, being surrounded by the familiarity of the backwoods, and he tries to savor the moment. In all his recollections of home he had imagined it was perpetually summer, his best memories with Dean taking place during the three months when they were free from school. Swimming in the lake, running through the fields, wrestling warm and rough and wild. Altogether they’re a collage of moments when Castiel fell in love with his best friend, years of his adolescence marked by quiet nights lying side by side in a field of stars, willing himself to stay still, to resist the urge to
There’s already a crowd gathered by the time they approach the center. At Bobby’s earlier urging he approaches pack members he’s hasn’t spoken to yet—like Kevin and Linda Tran, who were both incredibly young when he saw them last; Ash and Garth, who fittingly work at the Roadhouse bar under Ellen; and Sam and Charlie, the former hugging him tightly while the redhead nudged him in the side and made suggestive comments about his relationship with Dean.
Dean’s eyes are wide and open and full of love, tears escaping out the corners, and he opens his mouth to speak, to reciprocate, whenever Castiel stops him.
credit than that?
He takes a step forward to seal the deal with a kiss, but Castiel holds up his hand.
pissed off. Somehow in equal measure. He closed his eyes, ready for the impact of whatever Castiel planned to give him…
“There’s nothing to do out here,” Castiel debates, though he’s not sure why he’s trying to make Dean leave. Usually he absorbs every moment he can in the omega’s presence, whether they’re alone or in a group, at school or at home. But there’s something he’s missing, some substantial clue to why he feels so
“Sh, Lil,” Gabriel whispers. “No flirting in front of my baby bro.”
“Is this when you give me that full body massage?” he asks suggestively, and Castiel huffs out a small chuckle.
“You gotta be fucking kidding me,” he grumbles out, and Castiel chuckles beneath him. “I’ll get that, but just, uh, don’t go anywhere, okay?”
“Oh, Dean…” Castiel was cupping Dean’s chin, a thumb wiping at the tear tracks on his face. Dean looked up at his boyfriend, unashamed and unguarded, receptive to whatever Castiel might say next. He was tired of holding himself together all the time, of controlling everything around him. He had a partner now, right? Someone to help shoulder the responsibility. Someone he trusted and had his best interests in mind.
pacing, but Sam is blocking his usual circle and he can’t bring himself to start a new one.
Throwing open the passenger door to the Impala, and sliding inside after all this time…it’s a near religious experience for Castiel. How many times had he daydreamed about this same scenario, sitting side-by-side with Dean, driving on a sunny day without a destination in mind? More importantly, his brain provides with some mischief, how many times had he laid awake in bed, his right hand wandering down south as he conjured up an image of Dean in the backseat, naked and on his hands and knees, presenting himself to Castiel…
Dean snorts, shaking his head. “I bet you will.” He adjusts his favorite
“Hey there, champ,” Dean whispers, fingers skating across his skin. He touches the alpha everywhere—forearms, shoulders, shins, and Castiel winces at the grazing pressure. “You’re...how bad are you hurt?”
having this conversation?
“Gabe, that dude from the bakery. He tried setting me up with some frat guy.” Dean chuckled, thinking about how different that guy must be from Cas. Castiel seemed like the last kind of person who would participate in Greek life, though Dean had been known to attend a sorority party or two. A guy had needs and all that jazz.
“Holy shit,” Dean said breathlessly.
“So?”
“Do we have a game plan?” Sam asks abruptly, and Dean turns in the seat to face him.
Dean clamped his mouth shut. He didn’t want to incriminate himself or Cas if Zachariah was somehow bluffing.
It was Monday morning and they were sitting in Charlie’s cramped office space. It had been a long weekend, tortuous even, waiting for the appropriate office hours to arrive in order for him to come clean to Charlie. He was eager to know if they would be allowed to continue on with the study, and the various possibilities of how this all might end was making him tense with anxiety.
“You’re quitting,” Castiel said evenly, feeling as though every shred of stability was slipping through his fingers.
“Uh…”
“Don’t be…I sorta started this.”
“No, but…” Sam stares between then. “You do this, you’ll be the one who ends up dead. That’s not an option, Dean.”
“Wow.” Curious, Dean fishes his own phone out of the back pocket of his jeans and taps on the screen. It’s nearly the same as Castiel’s, and he’s distracted by it for a moment, but then he thinks about holding Cas under the hot stream of water…
Dean brings a hand to his face, scrubbing over his face and grinning like an idiot. “Where the hell did you come from, man?”
“No, I don’t think so,” Castiel reasoned, thinking he meant the now forty-five minutes they had spent entwined together, “my knot is just sensitive because it’s our first time, and we’ve just mated, and—”
The question was evidently such a surprise that Dean choked on his drink, coughing until Castiel had to lightly pat his back.
“Good to know,” she replied breezily, though Castiel wasn’t sure if she was referring to their new, platonic friend zone situation or the fact that Castiel had just declared them best friends. Either way, she gulped whatever was remaining in their shared solo cup, then stood up, face smooth and determined. “Time to go back on the hunt, then.”
Sam sighed in disappointment, leaning against the leather seat and looking out the window.
“We watch over you, brother,” Michael adds, forever oldest sibling, forever in charge. Castiel smiles, examining each of their faces, trying to memorize every detail so he’ll never forget this moment. The moment that had been stolen from him all those years ago.
Castiel seemed totally in-control now, his usual dominating-bedroom-persona floating to the surface as he unbuttoned Dean’s jeans. His pants fell to his ankles and Dean stepped out of them dutifully. As soon as he finished, Cas was palming his dick through his boxers, and Dean sucked in a breath and nearly stumbled.
“Well, then your experience is incomplete,” Castiel says simply. “Because you know what happens next?” Dean shakes his head, feeling emotional and drained, and waits for Cas to continue. “Well, we’ll clean up the kitchen. Talk some more, maybe take a nap. At some point I’m gonna prep myself open and ride your cock for as long as humanly possible, which I’m eager to experience.” Dean’s interest in piqued and he nods automatically, making Cas chuckle. “We’re gonna shower, eat, sleep. And then we’re going to tell Sam and Madison—” He entwines their hands, squeezing tight. “And find an OBGYN. We’re gonna buy the books and take the vitamins and—”
“What he said,” Dean grumbles, hooking his thumb over his shoulder. Castiel is relieved they at least agree on one thing.
“God, that’s hot,” Castiel mumbles, sounding wrecked, and he brings Dean’s face closer and begins to lick the come away. Shit, Dean agrees. That
“I look like a douchebag,” he announces, lifting his arms up high as the fabric sways down around him.
“C’m’here, pets,” she chirps, ushering the two vying alphas closer to the center. Like the first trial, the rest of the pack has formed a misshaped circle, with the elders observing from a closer distance. With her empty hand—the one
looks borderline embarrassed at being caught.
Dean opens his eyes with a groan.
“I did at first,” he admits. “I’ve been through…a dozen memories already,  maybe more. But this one…”
and it starts to thaw some of the muddled emotions from his hardened heart.
“Yeah,” Dean said, chuckling. “He has this weird way of talking—kinda formal and stiff, but when you get him going, dude’s super witty and funny.” He felt energized again, talking about Castiel. He had spent almost every waking hour with him this week, but now that he finally had an afternoon to himself, he missed Castiel’s company. Dean hadn’t experienced any other sex dreams, panty-related or otherwise, thank the fucking lord. But lately, he still thought almost daily—or, to be honest, hourly—about what it would be like to be
“Dean—”
to the pack members, to engage with them on an individual level. It’s a tough job, and he dreads whoever they’ll end up with. The only good alternatives in his mind are already elders, or aren’t alphas—which is a bylaw they’ve never omitted.
Dean’s expression is a mixture of cavalier embarrassment and immense delight, and the blush spreading on his cheeks is such a stunning sight that Castiel reaches over, tucking a hand under his chin. “But if you don’t come back to me safely, tell that demon he’ll be dead within the hour.”
Dean whips his head around. “Seriously?”
Castiel smiles down at his omega, despite feeling like the insides of his body are pushing against bone and skin, pleading to be transfigured, changed. He can see it in his head, the painting above the mantle, what he thought would be his final farewell to his father. Instead he was face-to-face with his father again in heaven, and the painting…
“So please, man, let me keep things the same. It’s important to me, and honestly, I think my readers will dig it. Which is what really matters, right?” It was the closest thing to “asking for permission” that Castiel had ever witnessed from Dean. He knew it was an offering not to take lightly, and he gave his boyfriend a small smile, admiring him greatly.
He doesn’t know if his instructions are making any sense, but Castiel’s breathing gets more and more ragged, his hand fondling Dean more and more desperately. As Dean’s climax begins to build, cock hard and aching and ready to blow, it’s not Dean who lets out a needy moan.
the one who cut
Sam scrunched his eyebrows together, seeming bewildered, but eventually his face softened.
, Dean thought, finally shooting his brother his most irritated glare. Sam shook his head, still smiling.
He takes a deep, shuddering breath, trying to calm down. He’s covered in come, his hand and cock and even parts of his thigh. He’s never had this high of a sex drive before, never imagined he would be so aroused he couldn’t wait a few hours for his omega to come home.
Happy Friday, reader babes. So this chapter is a whopping 9k, so grab some popcorn (maybe wine) and take off your mascara, 'cause yeah…fluff fest ahead.
He’s down to his boxers by the time he scents Dean. Usually the omega’s leafy, lush fragrance blends well into the wild, making him harder to track, but tonight...tonight his minty bouquet of sage is undeniably vibrant, effervescent and energizing. Newfound energy pulses in Castiel’s blood, and many things happen all at once.
“I don’t wanna,” Dean mumbled, looking down at the phone as if it could somehow transport Cas here.
Sam looked at Dean with panicked eyes. Dean shared his brother’s worried expression—the
“Stop trying to change the subject,” he nips, before another thought occurs to him, sending a rush of nervous adrenaline through him. “Unless what you have to tell me is
“No, you’re not, Cas.” Sam’s expression is earnest but careful, and Castiel wonders if he’s keeping his skepticism to himself. “And speaking of Dean—”
off of, but whatever. He’ll be the mouthpiece of the higher-ups if they’re too worried to get their hands dirty.
“Are you blushing now?” Castiel asks, voice deep and rich as whiskey.
make Castiel lose every molecule of air in his lungs.
“After today,” Dean complains, “we’re burning every piece of clothing we have that’s goddamn wool.”
“Pie contest?” Cas asked, eyebrows scrunched, and Sam and Jess looked up in excitement, both speaking at once.
the contract? Really read it? Or how about when I asked if Sam would read it and offer you legal council? Did you ever even ask him about it?”
He brings himself back to a standing position, feeling weakened and dazed by all the admissions he’s just let out. Of course, even if Cas does hear his prayer, he won’t know everything Dean’s thought in his head—he’ll just know what Dean has spoken aloud to him, the apology of a best friend rather than the desperate pleas of a one-time lover.
Dean huffs, taking a long draw from his beer. “You’n Sammy both. But you probably knew that already.”
“Not really. Just…intense.” Dean knew he was being ambiguous, but really, it was the best he could do under the circumstances. Sam nodded understandingly, placated for the moment.
Dean wasn’t one to brag, but that dedication had been a great fucking idea. Possibly his best ever. He had woken up via blowjob for almost a week straight after Cas read that shit.
Come and chat, come and hug, come and cry…all are options in the comments, my dears!!
He needs his omega with a throbbing need, a craving, a longing so deep it’s practically bottomless.
In the end, neither speaks.
“Hey, we’re all busy,” Charlie counters. “Head of Technology Services over here.”
“Yeah, well. You know what else I know?” She leaned in closely. “Cas is just as into you. Like, crazy into you. You big idiot.”
“Of course I do. Dean, I…”
“You belong out here,” Dean said without thinking.
Because Castiel does not consider himself weak. Far from it.
Probably the latter. Cas is a busy guy, he’s got a lot more on his mind lately than getting Dean naked…despite how badly Dean wants it.
“Uhh…” Dean turned from the coffee pot, realizing he hadn’t been paying attention. “Yeah.”
“Isn’t it an honor?” Castiel asks, surprising Dean with the curiosity of his question. “Sacrificing yourself for something you believe in?” His own ancestors had done the same, Dean recalls, in order to close the gates.
“Therefore, we have determined that having an exact match of your Z-chromosome does not guarantee successful or lifelong mating. However, despite limited communicative contact, the matching extraneous chromosomes guarantees an intense social reaction may be established—this could be friendship, hatred, or love.”
“Chuck became packmaster in 1988, and led our pack faithfully for thirty years,” Pamela says, continuing her non-scripted eulogy. “We honor his service tonight, his sacrifice and passion, his love for each of us and his willingness to help us regrow during the most difficult of days.” Dean burrows closer to the alpha beside him, offering all the physical comfort he can. Pamela reopens her tome of a book and begins reading again. “Now we spill the flowing, living blood of The Wolf. Earth Son, do you recognize the fallen’s fulfilled duty to the pack and the responsibility of the next-of-kin to uphold the same decorum?”
The rush of intimacy was like a drug, a surreal ignition of desire that made Dean’s consciousness float away until all he felt was pleasure. After a moment he was dragged back to earth by teasing, nibbling teeth scraping against his ass cheeks.
“No,” Castiel interrupted, then wrinkled his forehead. “Wait, Dean. What do you mean? I don’t see any cradles nearby.”
“Because I wanted to.”
“Okay, yeah, thanks for stopping by,” Dean interrupts in a rush, pushing his brother-in-law out of the front door with both hands. “Drive safe, fly safe, just, uh, see ya at Christmas or whatever.”
“Well…” He pauses, while Dean glares up at him with a look that’s eerily similar to his brother’s infamous bitch-face. “You seemed uncertain earlier, and I didn’t want to pressure you—”
In reality, of course, there were no such things as demons. But sometimes, Dean liked to think that a demon
But finally, for the first time today, he lifted his head and looked at Cas.
“Drinking and dancing,” Dean echoed. Castiel noted a hint of nervousness in his voice, but decided it was pre-hunt jitters. They filled their pockets with iron, salt rounds, and a small pistol—including Castiel, whose angel blade wouldn’t exactly be effective on a ghost. Dean slammed the trunk, then reached into his pocket, pulling out their wristbands. He handed one to Castiel, who easily fastened his plastic clasp. Dean’s seemed stuck, however, and he struggled with the clasp for a few minutes (stubbornly and much to Castiel’s annoyance), before finally accepting help. Castiel flipped Dean’s arm roughly—how is Dean Winchester the only human who can make me so irritated?—and wrapped his long fingers around the man’s wrist.
Castiel looks at him like he’s the most generous person on the planet and Dean shifts on his feet, blushing at the intensity of his alpha’s gaze. Before he can reply, Cas gets pulled into a discussion by Ash and Charlie about the possibility of offering free, pack-wide wifi. Dean takes a step back, folding the ridiculous cape on the edge of the counter, his heart dangerously full as he watches everyone he loves talk and laugh.
“To free will,” he says, holding up his beer for a toast. Dean raises his eyebrows approvingly and echoes his words, and then they both take a long sip, maintaining eye contact for so long that Castiel forces his eyes down. There’s a heat between them, there always has been, but now it seems less argumentative and more…
“Let’s…let’s start from the beginning.” Dean rubbed his temples and closed his eyes, like the conversation was already difficult for him. “Why did you leave?”
He takes Dean’s length in his mouth, feeling it harden immediately against the roof of his mouth. Dean’s breathing has increased, his legs twitching faintly, and Castiel sucks him down deeper and breathes carefully through his nose. He feels the smallest hint of precome down his throat, salty and bitter, and he groans. At the sudden vibration Dean moans in his sleep, a high-pitched sort of whine that Castiel relishes. He loves taking Dean apart, making him feel good, driving him wild. He pops off, catching his breath, and admires Dean’s hard and shiny cock standing at full attention now. Castiel scents the arrival of Dean’s slick in the air, almost surprised it can happen in his sleep, and fights the urge to wake his boyfriend up fully with teasingly slow rim job. But this isn’t about what Castiel wants, it’s about Dean, so he licks the head of cock with determination while he strokes the base, using his free hand to graze Dean’s ball delicately.
“That’s not much to go on,” Dean interrupted, rubbing his eyes in exhaustion. “It was the early nineteenth century, man. Death records were spotty at best.”
“It’s fine,” Castiel responded, trying to force the oncoming tension to roll off his shoulders. He spotted his suitcase leaned against the wall and went to retrieve it, unzipping it and deciding on a sweater and jeans. Dean sat on the bed as the towel dropped around Castiel’s waist, eyebrows raised in interest.
“Nah. I only went there ‘cause the bar’s name is Gaelic,
Dean didn’t break eye contact as he grabbed a chair, casually spreading his legs wide, fingering the denim holes in his jeans. He licked his lips pointedly and continued his eye contact with Castiel, who looked totally absorbed in the omega’s every movement.
Damn it all to hell.
Charlie bouncily crossed her legs and grinned at him. “Oh, I don’t know. Probably around the same time that
Dean 3:17 AM >>
Castiel felt his cheeks turning red, heartbeat rattling in his chest. He had never realized Zachariah harbored so much resentment towards his father, himself, and...who was Joshua? A spike of self-awareness drifted through Castiel’s subconscious. The name sounded so familiar…
Castiel snorted and they wandered over to the bar, which wasn’t quite as busy now, thankfully. Sam, Ash, and Garth hadn’t returned yet from outside, and Castiel wondered if Benny had given them any trouble.“You get used to the aggression in New York,” he said conversationally. “Some gay men can be very...forthcoming.”
When Dean cracked his eyes open, evening had settled outside. The window was filled with darkness. Fuck—how many hours had he slept? When had he even fallen asleep? He groaned, rolling on his side and wincing at the bruises, when he realized something had woken him up. A buzzing sound. His was phone was ringing on the nightstand. He stretched forward, searching for it in the dark. There was an unfamiliar number on the screen, with a New York area code…
“I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I don’t agree.” Zachariah had one leg crossed at the thigh, hands casually on the table, as if they were discussing something trivial like the weather. “We’re not an innovative publisher. We’re a traditional publisher. We’re not here to make political statements about men
“No,” he says out loud, though he’s not entirely sure what he’s refuting. “No,” he says again, and it makes him feel better, so he repeats it again, embracing his own stubbornness. It’s the middle of the afternoon and he’s surprisingly been unbothered for that whole stretch of time, since Charlie and Sam and Madison taking over some of his duties as the unofficial pack mayor. They’ve tried to comfort Dean during the wait, urging him outside and asking him to come run errands with them, anything to keep him from fixating on his missing alpha. But Dean has been sulking and isolated, afraid to leave the cabin, worried he might not be here when Cas inevitably returns. The only productive thing he does do is finally fix Cas’ front door, which has been a thorn in his side for, what, a week now? Apart from that he sleeps in their bed and cradles Castiel’s pillow, seeking solace in his alpha’s scent, and passes most of his time in a sort of fever dream.
The blonde smirks at him and pulls the machete out, looking irritated but unflustered, like a woodworker dislodging a small splinter. Castiel watches in horror as the heavy knife dissolves into thin air, it’s one-time-only use wasted on the wrong foe. He doesn’t even have time to process what a colossal mistake he’s made before the arachne is behind him, the sound of its sticky web gearing up, sticking to Cas’ shirt. At the same time the hulking gray beast—which Castiel recognizes now as a wendigo—is barreling straight towards him. In a last-ditch effort he bends low and rolls, and somehow his swerve technique works: the arachne and the wendigo collide against each other. Castiel pants heavily, the race of his heart like the steady pounding of a drum, and reaches for the only other weapon he feasibly has left. Wendigos are killed with fire, so the magnifying glass must be the right (though daunting and entirely cumbersome) weapon in sparking its final end. If the machete didn’t work on the vetala, Castiel reasons, then by process of elimination, it was meant for the arachne. That leaves…
Dean’s wicked facade only magnified. “Sounds good,” he said, slapping Castiel’s ass cheeks playfully as they headed for the bathroom. “I like a challenge.”
“Cool,” Charlie says. “Hope my library penpal likes LGBTQ fantasy novels, ‘cause they’re getting a lot of ‘em.”
He takes off running, stumbling and tripping back down the path, heading back towards the outside of the tomb.
Dean felt his heartbeat quicken, his breathing shallow. “Why didn’t you?”
It’s already late afternoon and they’re barely halfway finished. According to Dean, they need to be back on the road by tomorrow morning…they have to be, in fact. This is a very important weekend, what Charlie has rightfully dubbed The Weekend to End All Weekends, and they should’ve packed up Castiel’s apartment ages ago instead of leaving it for the last minute. But they spent the past three weeks lazing around, establishing a new routine and figuring out what their relationship looks like when it’s not benchmarked with near-death experiences. For Castiel it was a lovely, loved-filled few weeks with his omega…but that carefree attitude feels like a lightyear away now.
Castiel bites his lip, quietly musing. “I figured as much,” he admits. “I-I asked Dean what I should do.”
Because his alpha is beaming at him.
“Stop it.” It was a benevolent reprimand, but there was still authority in Castiel’s voice. Dean felt his mouth close on instinct. “Don’t talk about yourself in that way. Either tell me the truth, Dean…or just get to work.”
“It’s not much,” Dean mumbled, leaning close towards Castiel’s ear, hand casually on his back. “Not a lot of options in town, you know? But the best damn cup of coffee in the county, I swear.”
“Oh, Dean…” Castiel pushed him against the wall again, staring at his parted lips. “Please don’t tempt me.”
librarian. I get my rocks off when I need to and it’s not a problem.”
Castiel nodded. There was only one way to make Chuck proud. Only one way to truly find peace, no matter the outcome…
“Is it always like that?” Dean didn’t realize he had vocalized the question until Castiel stirred beside him, turning his head and staring.
Castiel arched his eyebrow high and licked his lips, examining Dean’s tanned skin with obvious appreciation. “Oh, I’ll make sure of it.”
‘It’s a preventive measure,” Sam says quickly, dropping his voice down low. “Or have you already forgotten about what Dad said? About the Novaks and their blood and the danger Cas is in?”
. “You were...that confident….about getting laid, huh?”
“Oh shit, Dean,
if you had been honest about your writer’s block.”
“Maybe.” She gave him a tight, rueful smile. “But I’m a cultural anthropologist, Cas. I have to be empathetic towards the people I study. If not, I can’t do my job.”
Castiel has never heard the words aloud before, not from Dean,

They hugged longer than two men should, given the environment, until Dean slowly pulled away.
his interaction with the guy. Castiel or whatever the hell his name was. The study had no maximum age, so the dude was almost definitely some elderly professor guy with nothing better to do with his summer. That was fine, as far as Dean was concerned. It’s
“Mister Winchester, will you read another?” a little boy asks shyly. His mother, Lisa, stands upright and flashes Dean a dazzling smile. She’s a pretty brunette with plump, pink lips and a firm yoga instructor’s body. To be honest, Dean’s been dying to hit that, but he puts Little Dean on the back burner while he’s at work. It was hard enough working his way up the ranks in this department as a single guy, but if uses his facetime with the community as a way to hit on hot moms (or dads) then he’ll be jeopardizing his dream job.
Fifteen minutes later, leaving Bobby’s office and heading down the block where his ‘67 Impala was parked, Dean’s cell phone started buzzing. He pulled it from his pocket, feeling a sudden flurry of nerves, but shrugged.
“I have some ideas as well,” Castiel replied, scrunching the back of Dean’s shirt until he touched bare skin, exploring with his hands. “Some that involve the apron you were wearing.”
Lilith is wearing tight jeans and a low-cut, black top, smiling at them all. “Whoever lives here should really update the wards,” she comments. “Any demon with half a brain could bust in.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “Well, that’s highly impractical of you, considering that ghosts can be dangerous and homicidal.”
“Sorry,” he replies, his left hand weaving in the grass and reaching for the handle of the knife. “I’m already spoken for.”
“What do you think?” he asks, almost mockingly, and it’s such a fitting response to such a serious question that Dean laughs. Whatever retort he considers gets buried by a kiss, a sudden and soothing gesture, and he wraps his arms around his alpha and deepens it instinctively. Whatever’s to come, they’re no longer stuck in the in-betweens, the what-ifs. They’ve made it through the worst of things, grief and loss and war, and now there’s only the most difficult challenge remaining for Dean and Castiel.
The race is winding and tedious but Castiel wins, which ultimately, is how he knows. Anna always won, was always the fastest wolf in his family, and he recalls the second trial more quickly this time, flooded with another disorientating lurch. He’s not in his were form, not really—he’s lying dead in the grass, his soul floating around Heaven. The dose of reality isn’t nearly as difficult to accept as last time, but it leaves him just as angry.
Dean had the impulse to make a “that’s what she said” joke—or even better, considering his audience—a “that’s what
“We can talk about this later,” Cas said, noticing that Dean had turned quietly introspective. “But in the meantime, can I…” He inhaled sharply, hands coming to rest on Dean’s neck, shaking. “Kiss you again?”
“Nobody’s been more involved than you,” Bobby points out. “And they’ll listen to you.”
“Don’t tell me,” he said, pointing between the two of them, “you’re the mystery omega? The one from the case study?”
Dean was filled with relief when they finally reached the river, chuckling when he spotted the canoe rental sign. Castiel tilted his head, searching for whatever Dean was seeing. There an old chipped sign in front of the office, and in green letters, it read “Uncle Wiz’s Canoe & Kayak Rental.”
“Yeah, well…” Dean huffed out a breath, lifting his gaze from his shoes and looking at Anna with apprehension. “I have good reason to be.”
“I could tell you, but I’d rather maintain some mystery,” Castiel says with a chuckle. “My brother tells me it keeps things fresh.”
“Don’t I get a show?” Dean jokes, but really, he’s feeling a little vulnerable in his boxers-only status, and he wants to touch Castiel as much as he wants to be touched.
“You know I can’t tell you that,” she said patiently. “But hey—when did you give him a nickname? That’s fascinating…I need to add that to my notes…”
Dean inhaled sharply. “Jesus, Cas. Your voice is so fucking sexy.”
still angry with Cas. His boyfriend had an apparent inability to stand up to Zachariah, which really fucking sucked considering everything Dean might lose if he didn’t. But another part of him knew it wasn’t Cas’ responsibility to get him out of this mess...he had created it by not reading the contract. They were stuck in a web of roadblocks and complications with Anna and Zachariah on the outskirts, and Dean and Cas stuck at an impasse in the center. Neither wanted to compromise, neither wanted to lose each other. So they had spent the past two days cuddling and kissing and avoiding all discussion of the actual issue, despite the fact that Dean only had five days left to rewrite certain sections of the book. If that was what he decided to do…
“Those things are rigged,” Dean complains, ducking his head down to check on the burgers. Castiel watches him with piqued interest, trying hard to figure the guy out. Is he truly this modest, or he is trying to get Castiel to compliment him?
Standing in the water, Michael shouts something self-righteous about not appreciating being grouped in with Gabriel or Lucifer,
There was no changing it.
Dean shrugged noncommittally, hoping to seem nonchalant. Sam narrowed his eyes excitedly. “Dude, you
The discomfort turns to pleasure quickly, as it always does with Cas, and then he’s clasping his dick at the tip and trying to stave off his orgasm. But his alpha smells
Castiel nods diplomatically, though he doesn’t loosen his grip. Dean still worms his way up and off the couch, searching the living room for his shoes and car keys.
believe it. Do you really think you’re traveling across the country, to the home and undoubtedly glamorous apartment of your hot-as-sin boyfriend, and not getting blown to smithereens?”
A few minutes later, after Dean salutes Sam and Bobby a quick goodbye, he ducks into his bedroom and calls Cas. It rings and rings, and the voicemail picks up. The automated voice bounces around in his ear, there’s an intrusively loud beep, and then…
“You okay?” Dean whispered, and Castiel nodded mutely. He wondered if Dean would be self-conscious later about holding his face this intimately in public, in front of all his friends and a few-dozen of his readers, none who knew yet that Dean was bisexual. Castiel should’ve been thoughtful enough to subtly push Dean away, and have this discussion later in privacy, saving Dean from potential embarrassment. But he had yearned for this
a thing, but wow, it was nice of Cas to try).
He’s right, unfortunately—Dean isn’t the packmaster. At best, he’s the future son or husband of packmaster, which doesn’t quite carry the same reverence or respect.
Dean moans, nodding his head into the pillow. “Okay, okay…” He breathes as Cas’ fingers unbutton his jeans, snaking a hand and cupping him outside his underwear. Dean’s whole body shudders. “I want…”
“Cas isn’t an option,” Dean interrupted, pointedly avoiding Charlie’s gaze. She knew him too well, could read through him in an instant.
“I expected you to care, Cas. Or actually, here’s an idea. How about you treat Zach like you’re treating
indeed. How did he ever think he could live without this man? How could the universe give him the gift of a rare, lifelong love if it always intended to cut his life short?
When Sam speaks again, his voice is softer, quieter. “What about Cas?”
Thankfully, his dad’s third attempt was successful and he’s been clean for five years now. Even so, hearing his words sung in Castiel’s gorgeously deep bass, voice shaking with vulnerability, hits Dean right in the gut. Castiel maintains eye contact with him during the whole song, never flinching away from the emotion on Dean’s face. Somehow, he’s forgotten that the stage is buzzing with people and onlookers. He’s simply mesmerized by Castiel, by the husky depth of his voice, the endless blue of his eyes, the careful and measured way his fingers touch the frets. He finishes the song out with a slow fading G chord and Dean can’t believe it, but his eyes are watering a little—what the hell is happening to him?
But most nights he successfully pushed those thoughts away, content to just exist in Castiel’s orbit. He fit into every part of Dean’s life flawlessly—a firm and discerning editor, a witty and reassuring friend, a breathtakingly insatiable lover. They still hadn’t gone
Damn, maybe he should’ve asked Sam to crash with a friend in the dorms. ‘Cause if things went the way Dean hoped they would, he’d be straddling Cas’ hips and sinking onto his thick alpha cock in just a few hours’ time…
“I think so. But Nathaniel was already damned, in his mind at least. Edward had ruined his chance at salvation and then he wanted to leave him. That’s why Nathaniel stoned him. That’s why he targets people doubting their homosexual relationship—they represent Edward all over again.”
Ellen nods solemnly. “And a few others.”
“Huh?” In lieu of more coffee, Dean downs his remaining glass of milk and burps quite attractively, if he does say so himself. “You’ve lost it now, dude. Feelin’ feverish or what?”
“Cheer up, Cassie,” Balthazar says flippantly, legs crossed with a pair of outlandish sunglasses on. There are two bodyguards, one beside Castiel and one in the front seat, but they’ve barely spoken. They’re not his usual crew—just hired muscle for this specific event. “One little duet and then it’s over.”
Castiel checked his watch and sighed. It was nearly seven o’clock, and if he didn’t leave the office soon, he would miss his bus. Most days he biked to work, but the temperatures were already dropping in New York, some evenings on the cusp of freezing. He closed his laptop and tucked it safely into his messenger bag, then tossed on his trench coat. On his way out the door, he noticed his friend and fellow editor, Anna, was still in her office. He approached her open door—intending to chastise her for not having a life on a Friday night, though Castiel had little room to talk—whenever he heard her mentioning his name. He squinted to himself in the empty hallway, figuring he should definitely wait now and speak with her. She might have something urgent to run by him, a last minute editorial question or a book suddenly behind on its to-printer date. He checked his watch again, picturing his tiny apartment twenty blocks away.
The omega seems to sag in relief, some of the anxiety visually released in his shoulders, kissing the alpha’s forehead and clutching his hair. Castiel wants nothing more than to whisk them both back to his house, safe and warm under the covers of their bed. But then Dean lets go of him and stands, squatting down beside John, who’s still…
“Uh, hey Charlie?” he said into the microphone. Dean had no idea if he was allowed to interrupt mid-presentation, but hell, nothing ventured nothing gained. “Permission to leave?”
There are hands.
“What?” Castiel asks innocently, though he’s smirking as if he already knows somehow, the bastard.
“If that boy’s psychic, then I’m a blonde, six-foot amazonian queen,” came a woman’s voice, a thick southern accent accentuating each word. Her hair was fuzzy and black, her frame short and supple. She was wearing a gardener’s uniform similar to Joshua’s, a pair of shears passing between her gloved hands.
like to touch you now.”
It was an unremarkable Wednesday night, three weeks later, when it happened. Sam was taking Jessica to a concert that night, so they were free to spend some time at Cas’ place instead of their usual “family” time. Dean came over after work to fix his boyfriend’s dishwasher, which was old and on its last leg. Castiel didn’t care about repairing the appliance, but Dean had insisted in that thoughtfully persistent way that brokered no argument. Castiel was thinking about ordering them pizza whenever he rounded the corner—having been instructed to go grab a pair of pliers from the trunk of the Impala—and Dean was bent over, ass up and presenting, tight and round and simply
They gazed into each other’s eyes with all the intensity and longing of two men really about to fuck each other’s brains out, and the camera began snapping away again. The voices of the room, the directives from the photographer, everything faded into a dim buzz as Dean lost himself in Castiel’s warmth. His neck slipped to the side and Castiel’s lips trailed there, mouth not moving as the camera captured the motion. He slipped a hand into the waistband of Dean’s panties, inches away from grabbing his ass, and Dean felt his cock begin to thicken. His breathing sped up, his eyes shut for the camera in a “moment of passion” that was far more real than fabricated.
Castiel stole a glance at Dean, hoping it would go undetected. The hunter was clutching the steering wheel and staring out the window, distracted. He stopped the Impala abruptly at a stop sign, and Castiel slid to his left, accidentally brushing shoulders with Dean. Dean froze at the contact, tension visibly burdening his shoulders.
“Yeah, yeah, leave us alone, we’re tired,” the omega protests, though good-naturedly, but Pam and Ellen are shaking their heads.
“What? What the hell do you have against Kerouac?” Dean asked playfully, and Castiel scoffed.
Castiel pictures home, the outside of his father’s cabin, but Dean shakes his head. He closes his eyes, concentrates, and then Cas sees it. A field, the one from his altered memory in heaven, the place where he and Dean would go as teengers to drink and stargaze. Where they silently pined for each other.
“Wanna gimme that again?” Dean had taken a seat at the table, folding his hands on the surface.
Everything Castiel had noted about the club hours ago was suddenly magnified: where the room had been dim, now was in near darkness, the only flashes of visibility coming from colored strobes and yellow spotlights. This afternoon there had been a subtle buzz of music playing, mostly in the background while the staff prepped; tonight, there was a DJ behind a wall of audio equipment, his hands shifting between decks and visibly turning the volume up louder. The music was a fast-tempo version of two songs mashed together, and while Castiel didn’t find the tune at all unpleasant, Dean turned to him and rolled his eyes.
Only then does Castiel take himself in hand, shaking and sweating and wheezing, bursting with the need to finally come. It’ll be his first orgasm of many, he knows, because...
Dean didn’t respond. He knew his therapist was right, but he couldn’t tell Bobby everything, not yet. “I’m just not ready,” he admitted, staring down at his hands.
“Yes,” Cas said, nodding towards Sam. “I found those to be particularly suspicious.”
as the petite, beta redhead had insisted, since she hadn’t technically graduated with her PhD yet. He stared at the bland cement walls, gray tiled floor, and dark oak table and chairs… Wow. So much for finding a distraction in here.
The man looking back at him was Dean Winchester.
“But then, why…? ”
“Dean.” The cocky smile had faded and now Dean felt nervous, breathless.
“After that I slept in parks, which in my case, turned out to be safer. I somehow got a job as a busboy, but still hadn’t saved up enough for my own place, so I slept anywhere I could. Public bathrooms, libraries, buses. Parks were my favorite, since it reminded me of being outside and tending to the bees...the only part of home I missed. A few times I got citations for loitering.” He took a deep breath, willing himself to finish. He had never told anyone this story. “One morning I woke up and there was a man sitting on my bench. I had fallen asleep reading, I believe it was a Sylvia Plath chapbook. I couldn’t stop reading one of her poem’s... ‘Elm.’ Do you know it?”
“The publisher’s retainment of rights.” Anna’s voice was trembling—she had started to cry. “Legally, we own your manuscript now. Zachariah can make whatever changes he wants and still publish it.” Dean felt nauseous, dizzy. Now his own goddamn book didn’t belong to him? But it was
“I could borrow a pair of yours,” Castiel whispers, and it takes Dean a full ten seconds to remember they’re talking about swim trunks. Jesus.
Standing there on stage, microphone in hand, he somehow managed to channel all these distracting thoughts into his performance. He was subtly trying to entice Cas, who was sitting at the nearest table with Sam and Jess, those impossible eyes hanging onto his every word. But Dean accidentally enticed the whole bar instead. He made his voice low and alluring, and read a scene from the first chapter of his new novel (much to the excitement of the few super fans in attendance). Dean’s eyes inevitably wandered to Cas as he read the first scene between Mike and Angel—the intense, emotionally charged rescue from Hell. Dean had never read it aloud before, having just written it a few weeks ago, and the impact of the scene made his voice begin to shake. He had come so far in just a few weeks. He’d started therapy and was making steady progress; broken through his writer’s block in a tremendously prolific way; and met a man he could no longer imagine his life without…
, he told himself firmly. Dean Winchester does
as demanding as thirst or hunger and Castiel can’t remember feeling this way, not in years at least, which seems an important clue for some reason…
This is one of the strongest monsters out there, and even in his wolf form, Castiel can feel the pressure of the wendigo’s claws digging into his stomach. The creature slashes Castiel’s soft middle with its razor-sharp claws and the wolf whines audibly, blood trickling down. He can’t fight this monster physically—its strength is superhuman, its vulnerabilities limited. With intense dread, he realizes he’ll need to shift again in order to defeat the wendigo.
, no one was interested in his version of events.
Dean had no idea who this woman was—Missouri, apparently—but hey, if she was helping their cause, Dean was grateful. Hell, if she could convince Joshua to help them, Dean would invite her to Thanksgiving dinner.
“Mate,” Dean repeated, his voice rough and shaking with emotion. Before he could lunge forward for another kiss, he heard someone clear their throat, or throats, or—wait, there were multiple someones?
Jesus. Dean’s heard of this book—isn’t it satirical?—but he’s never found the time (or, to be honest, the bravery) to dive into a book this incredibly long.
He swipes a finger across his throat again and when he pulls back, his hands are no longer covered in paint.
“Now move,
Well. Really fucking unstable right now.
Castiel came forcefully then, painting his fist and stifling a moan. He leaned into the hot spray of the water and washed himself off, hoping the whole floor of the B&B hadn’t heard him shout Dean’s name.
“This isn’t real, all right? Just look at them.” Dean nudges his head down and towards the other three. “They haven’t even noticed us talking. This is a…hallucination. A dream.”
“Weaknesses,” Castiel repeats quietly. “So, let me get this straight—there are three trials crafted through powerful magic, which are designed to test my personal shortcomings, and are so dangerous that they might even kill me?” He closes the book in front of him, sighing. “In the words of your brother, I’m fucked. Aren’t I?”
“What’s up with you?” Dean asks, unable to keep the accusation out his voice. “You haven’t seen your big bro in two months, and day one of your trip, suddenly you’re tied to your phone?”
His body.
“Right,” Castiel said, thankful for the distraction. “She told me about a reading series they’re doing down at the Roadhouse—“
Dean shoots his boyfriend a text anyways, hoping he doesn’t wake him, but he needs to hear from his alpha right now…he needs to know he’s safe.
The thought skates across his mind again, the directive Castiel had given him days ago. He had ignored it up until now, feeling rundown and unmotivated in Cas’ absence, wondering if he’s experiencing separation anxiety from his alpha before they’re even mated. He’s frustrated by his own hormones, by Cas, by the circumstances that are preventing them from being together right now. But he swallows down his overwhelming tide of emotions—time to get all Nancy Drew up in this bitch.
“So,” Sam said, his tone overwhelmingly cheerful, “when were you planning on telling me? Engagement? The wedding day?”
but he doesn’t wanna fuck with the official ceremonial lingo, so he repeats, “I will.”
He came over Dean’s fist with a shudder, panting hard, too overcome to open his eyes. Dean dropped his hand and kissed Castiel’s forehead before heading to the bathroom, coming back with his hands freshly washed and a warm washcloth to clean Cas with.
They looked at each other across the long stretch of stage and chuckled, arms waving between the two incredulously. There were very few differences between them, just minor details, like Dean’s suit jacket only had two buttons while Castiel’s had three. Dean could see that Cas’ tie was such a rich shade of dark blue it almost looked indigo, patterned with small circles. Otherwise their outfits were coordinating almost

and the alpha exhales.
The silence that followed was practically nail-biting and Dean fought the urge to leave, to walk around the block, to go into the barn and toss around a bale of hay,
Castiel was stirred awake by a hand on his shoulder three hours later.
“This isn’t necessary,” Castiel argued, looking at the pills in his hand. “It only hurts when I—”
What he ultimately comes away with is a sketch of his father in his human form, exactly as Castiel remembers him on the last day of war. Chuck is sporting a thick beard, jeans, and a sweatshirt, in his mid-forties but still vivacious and strong. He’s cresting the top of his favorite spot in the woods and there are angel wings protruding from his back, the wingspan impressively huge but delicately beautiful. Castiel paints the surrounding scene with a palette of oil-based neutrals, lots of dark greens and browns and grays. But the wings are the centerpiece, and they’re dark with ashes, black and sparkling against the sunset sky. When he pulls away nearly six hours have passed, but the small painting is shockingly decent and finally finished.
Dean’s cue to leave. He had enough to worry about—last thing he wanted was to get stuck in an awkward, impromptu blind date with Gabriel’s brother. Who apparently was in a Stanford fraternity, along with Gabe. No fucking thanks.
Sam is biting his bottom lip, likely in shock, his eyes brimming with tears. “Is there anything we can do?” he asks, eyes on Rowena.
Smells like home.
The game continues without too many other developments, but in a weird way, it feels good to ask questions—to be upfront with each other for once. An hour later the discussion turns back to normal topics, and Dean feels relieved. Sam and John are having a surprisingly interesting conversation about how they both almost fainted after getting married and claiming their mates publicly, but Dean is too distracted to listen, sliding his phone from his pocket. He frowns, examining the empty screen—no texts or calls from Cas.
Castiel tightens his grip on Dean’s sides, sighing heavily against the omega’s collarbone. Even with the funky scent blockers, Dean shivers against him, not quite believing he’s holding Cas right now. Or being held. Whatever.
His jaw dropped.
in their human form, but here they are, Dean and Cas, mated for all of two seconds and united in a way others could only imagine.
“This is amazing,” Castiel says finally, after swallowing. “Dean, you have a gift.”
“Hmph.” Dean made a general sound of disapproval, tilting his glass sideways. “Sounds like Sam’s already filled ya in, whaddya need me for?” he gripped, and Ellen narrowed her eyes. He didn’t wanna snap at Ellen, but fuck it, he couldn’t be held responsible for his bad moods lately. He was frustrated in every sense of the word—situationally, emotionally. Sexually.
“I like this,” Dean answered slowly, leaving a small trail of kisses on Castiel’s jaw. He was still running his fingers through Castiel’s hair. Castiel leaned back, feeling immensely more relaxed. This was
“I never wore a beret,” Castiel interrupts.
Castiel ordered two whiskeys, neat. The street outside was dark, though the cityscape was brightly lit. It felt strange to be back in the city again—too loud, too busy. After their plane landed, Castiel had taken Dean to his small, four hundred square foot apartment on W 27th. He felt embarrassed by how cramped, yet equally empty, his apartment was. He had furniture, sure...a loveseat, a bistro table with chairs, a small bookshelf. But he had lived in New York City his entire adult life, and never acquired much of what made a home,
Once they were in the Impala, Dean looking immeasurably content behind the wheel, they shared a kiss before heading into town. Dean wanted to take Castiel to his favorite local diner, explaining the whole way there that he rarely got to come here anymore since Sam was on another rabbit-food kick. Castiel listened to him speak about his family with interest, asking questions about Sam’s law practice and Jess’ enthusiasm for farming. Dean was full of stories, and was sharing a particularly embarrassing recollection of Sam’s fear of clowns as they exited the Impala and walked towards the diner door.
“Hell no.” Dean snorts, shaking his head in his usual, self-deprecating way. “And even if they were, you think I’m not a walking, talking contradiction?”
possibly forever if he plays his cards right, which is quite possibly the best thing that’s ever happened to him. He holds his phone in his hands gently, still beaming, as he texts back.
, he thinks. He spends several minutes varying up his method, sometimes offering long strokes before licking the underside or rubbing the head against his plump, wet lips. It’s only when he takes the now fully aching cock in his mouth again, hollowing out his cheek and moaning at the weight in his mouth, does he finally feel Dean begin to rouse fully.
“What? No witty retort? No sarcastic comeback?” Zachariah hummed.
But he looked up instead, needing Castiel to see how much he wanted this. Wanted him.
“We’re getting married tomorrow.” He threaded their fingers together and raised Dean’s hands to his lips, kissing every knuckle. Dean seemed to visibly melt into the touch. “Your idea was perfect, Dean. I wish I had thought of it myself.”
Gabriel snorts, placing his empty mug in the sink. “‘Turns out I’m not just the hot brother, I’m also the smart one.”
“Rowena,” Dean breathes, feeling as though he might faint. “Rowena…”
moment, the enemy forces would have never gotten in. For over a decade, Chuck had dismissed Dean’s suspicions that Rowena was somehow connected to the demon army. But he could never quite shake the feeling that the petite redhead had been playing both sides, that she had a vested interest in making sure the demons won and the weres stayed in the dark.
He had heard of instant chemistry, of an immediate pull, of an allure that was inflamed and unstoppable. But this alpha and omega, fairytale wet dream was reserved for the big, capital “M”—and Dean had never expected to find his, not after all the starts and stops and one night stands that colored his romantic history. But here he was, one month after meeting Castiel Noak, ready to bare his soul and neck and...
“Amazing,” Dean breathed. He closed his eyes, trying to remember the exact details, but all he felt was Cas’ hands on him
“Huh.” Dean put his hands on his hips, and slung his head down, thinking. “Yeah, he tried cornering me earlier. Dude’s got the best gay-dar in the damn county. I haven’t been hit on like that in...I’ve
“Castiel will now blindfold his future mate. Both will kneel, and the packmaster’s objective is to find the miniature pearl hidden in the folds of the floccus, only searching through the instructions given to him by Castiel.”
“Sam,” Dean sighs with finality, hoping to wrap up this conversation sooner rather than later, “he does what he does for a reason.”
“When did we become boyfriends?” Castiel asks huskily, wanting nothing more than to dive back in for another deeply satisfying kiss, but forces himself to resist.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Something I surely would have mentioned, had we exchanged numbers.”
Yeah, pump the brakes. Dean
and then he’d tip back the whiskey bottle until the thoughts were silent. On the third night,
That, of course, is when the guilt sets in.
“What was that?” Sam asks, still standing a few feet away and glancing at him curiously.
“That’s sorta above my paygrade,” Dean mumbles, deflecting ‘cause it’s what he does best, and ‘cause he can’t stand the thought of telling Cas what he truly thinks.
And then, with one final nuzzle into the warmth of Dean’s neck, he spins around on his paws and leaps off the porch steps, flinging himself into the early morning forest and obscure darkness.
The woman who had died last night, Sarah Blankschaen, couldn’t have been more different from Aaron Samuels. Whereas Aaron had been closeted—Sam had interviewed his boyfriend the night before, confirming their suspicions—Sarah had been in a committed, and incredibly public, relationship with her girlfriend for over ten years.
Dean pulls away and searches Cas’ face, his own brain short-circuiting. “You–you want me to fuck you?”
“Um,” he shuffles on his feet, uncomfortable. He looks around for Dean, hoping to have an ally in the whole, make-Charlie-ask-for-help mission. “Are you sure?”
“This isn’t working,” Castiel declares loudly, not only to Dean but Missouri, Balthazar, and Dean’s entire group. “We need to try something else.”
Castiel is still on his knees, sorting through the endless mess and feeling frazzled. “The loneliness,” he quips under his breath. There’s a beat of silence and then the shuffle of feet, a pair of hands sliding on his shoulders and kneading the tense muscles there. A container of old primer slips from his hand, clattering to the floor.
“Hey,” Dean said softly. Castiel craned his neck, feeling stiff and unsettled. They were still in the Impala and it was dark outside, the only light cascading from a nearby street lamp.
had changed in just three weeks.
Snapping back into the present, he realized the man across the table was staring at him intently. Dean squirmed in his seat, wondering what the alpha was noticing about him. He had stopped by straight from work, so his navy blue trousers were damp with cooled sweat, his forming-fitting t-shirt grubby with dirt. Dean flushed, feeling embarrassed—no way a smartie pants like this goddamn dreamboat would ever consider going out with Dean, case study or not. Somehow Castiel seemed to sense Dean’s discomfort, his eyes shifting from his work uniform to Dean’s face, the gaze gentle and encouraging. With little else to do, Dean stared back. The exchange was deep and concentrated, strangely unblinking, and the depth of the silence was suddenly making Dean sweat.
still on a first date, after all, but fuck if these aren’t some unusual circumstances.
“There they are!” Jo calls triumphantly, and the music dims. Dread creeps into Castiel’s stomach.
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose and chuckles hollowly. “Dad?”
Zachariah laughed, the sound cold and hollow. “Now, is that anyway to talk to your publisher?”
“Hey, babe,” Dean mutters, hoping his laissez faire attitude will bother the annoying ass demons who are eavesdropping. “Fancy seein’ you here.”
Dean began packing up in record time.
There’s blood on him, and lots of it—his neck, the front of his shirt, the grass, the knife, Rowena’s hand…
Sam and Charlie turn quiet, eyeing each other in a knowing way that makes Dean’s anger flare up. Is Dean, or is he not, a pretty damn respectable country music artist? Has he not had a whopping five albums go platinum? Is his current single, “When I’m Riding Baby,” not at the top of the country music charts?
“Rowena,” he sneers, at the same time as Azazel and the woman come around the corner, drawn in by the commotion.
Cas liked him.
fucking way. Outside the air was crisp, the trees gorgeous with foliage, and Dean started unpacking his ingredients for a big pot of chilli. Meanwhile, Sam changed his clothes and went outside to help Jess do some last minute farm chores. Dean felt guilty that they had lost their part-time help thanks to him and his irresistible ass (Cas never laughed whenever he made that joke). But Benny was a natural flirt, obviously, so Dean didn’t feel particularly special. More than anything, it seemed like he had a drinking problem, and Dean knew what that looked like. Hopefully he would get cleaned up soon.
“Don’t you remember, Winchester?” Gabriel whizzes past him, wearing tinted aviator sunglasses. “My sweet baby bro can’t swim.”
He reaches over turns on the lamp, the light bathing them in yellow, and Castiel continues to suck seductively as Dean’s eyes meet his—widening.
“Still chatty as ever,” Bobby says, and Cas realizes the pack elder must have been speaking to him, tossing him an olive branch of “welcome home” chit-chat. The alpha flushes, embarrassed to be so lost in thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
Around six that night, still in his office, Dean starts to freshen up for his date. He wishes he had the time to go home and get ready properly, but that’s in the opposite direction, and he doesn’t want to be late. He keeps on his same jeans and boots, but slips on a fresh button-up, then goes in the public restroom to brush his teeth and check his hair. The only employees left now are the circulation specialists who check out people’s books, and the tables and stacks are pretty empty by this point in the day. There aren’t any events this evening, so he shuffles down the steps, the quiet hallways unsettling him today. Most of his bravado from last night has evaporated, and now that he’s tasked with the reality of seeing Castiel again without any excuses—work, family and friends, dangerous cursed objects floating around the library—Dean’s not sure he can handle being one-on-one with him.
“Well, the contract says you have to prepare for either,” Charlie said, squinting on her phone as she read the contract’s fine-print. “But they’ve got Mick Davies signed on as your partner, so they’re recommending him as the ‘bottom’ and you as the ‘top.’”
Balthazar kicks him squarely in the shin, which is more startling than painful. Before Castiel can protest, his manager is speaking to him in a firm and unyielding voice, and he just takes a gulp of his coffee and waits for the lecture to end. “Don’t let Dean Winchester get to you,” Balthazar says fiercely. “You just finished up the European leg of your
“Somebody’s skittish,” Castiel breathed playfully, kissing and nipping the globes of Dean’s ass. “Or just daydreaming?”
too many clothes from his closet and there simply wasn’t enough room in his suitcase. He held up a t-shirt Charlie had attempted to sneak in and regarded her with skepticism.
“Why?” Castiel asked genuinely.
“I would. And I would be interested in returning the favor at a later date, but I realize this is your first time with a man, so I’m more than willing to be on the receiving end.” Castiel’s tone is smooth and straightforward, as if they’re discussing who’s gonna ride shotgun in Baby that day. Not, you know,
When Dean wakes up for the second time, beams of sunlight are streaming in through his window. He’s sweaty, his head pillowed back on his side of the bed. His limbs are tangled up with Cas’ under the sheets. He yawns and leans up on his elbows. He takes a moment to stare at him—wondering who Castiel Novak is.
“I just met you, yeah. Don’t mean I don’t know you,” Dean argues, not sure how much of his hand he’s willing to play here. Castiel just looks back at him, the need for an explanation clear on his face, so Dean sighs and wipes his mouth with his napkin. “Fine. You were born in New York City, went to a fancy ass prep school, then an equally fancy college. Your dad is a famous novelist, your mom’s some corporate queen, and your brother owns casinos in Las Vegas. You met your agent three years ago at a party in the Hamptons, then were introduced to Balthazar, and the rest is history. Sometimes you date Meg Masters, that sexy but super unhinged model, who’s not really good enough for you in my opinion.” Castiel’s eyes are wide and he’s regarding Dean with something like shock and awe. “How’d I do, teach?”
the festival to me,” he repeated, and he couldn’t help it, Dean was grinning like a goddamn, lovesick idiot.
The subsequent entries mention the King in passing, more secret phone calls and even one clandestine meeting, and it seems as though Chuck was in the process of finally making a move against Azazel just before he died. Dean leans into the couch cushions, biting his lip and thinking. Then he walks into Chuck’s old bedroom, the alpha’s scent almost entirely faded by now, and snoops around the bedside table until he finds it. The packmaster’s old cell phone. The battery is long dead, but he reaches for the charging cable and plugs it up, waiting for it to be revived.
“Huh,” Sam says with a shrug, “so exactly what we expected to happen, then.”
“They’re not supposed to do that,” Balthazar mumbles snippily, “they’re going to make you late.”
The gritty texture of chalk coated Castiel’s fingers, and he clapped his hands together, turning from the chalkboard and looking down at his students.
LIke he’s a lock on a door his friend is intending to crack.
Charlie looked startled for a moment—the pair of them doing a French exit had obviously not been a possible option on her master plan—but she grinned in approval, her academic facade slipping for just a moment. “Go for it.”
Dean let himself be drawn forward, hands finding the dip in Castiel’s lower back. Cas gripped Dean’s neck, bringing their foreheads together.
Saliva drips around his neck as he uses all his strength to hold one back. His grace blasted the other two away, but it did no damage. They were already back on their feet and charging forward. With no grace left, Cas feels no hope for his situation. He needs to get back to Dean, but if he takes his hand off this beast he’ll lose the battle of strength and his entire throat would be ripped out in one bite. For all the times he’s died, all the times he has sacrificed himself for Dean or Sam or the world, he always had hope he’d come back. Chuck always sent him back. He had work to do, and as long as the Winchesters were still kicking, Chuck kept bringing him back—setting him right there next to Dean. So he can’t die here, not like this, not without first telling Dean how much he means to him. He’d said it once, that day in the barn, so it’s only fitting that he say it again as he waits for death.
With a lump of emotion in his throat, the omega swallows and keeps reading.
Yeah, he thinks, sex is one thing he might actually be decent at, so if that helps his alpha recover he’ll do that all day long. But that’s the old Dean talking, the one whose emotions are cut off with steel walls and heightened barbed wire. Sex with Cas would never be casual, would never be just a means to an end or a distraction, and he has to make sure the alpha knows what he’s signed on for.
” Dean’s voice is all incredulity and disbelief. “Dude, I doubt he’s even staying for long, much less taking over leadership of the largest werepack in Kansas.”
just got shot.
“You,” Dean gushes, and Castiel rewards him by stroking him lightly from outside of the cotton.
Dean swung his legs over the side of the hammock and swallowed. “You really think it’ll help?” He tried to ignore the newfound hope in his voice.
no dream required. “Your fingers were long and strong and I was so close to coming, shouting your name, but then I woke up with the biggest pair of fucking blue balls.”
“How could you know something like that without Dean telling you?”
kind of release before he accidentally punched someone.
He’s now crouching on the ground, nude and panting, and the wendigo is gawking at him with an air of disinterest—like a giant regarding a fly. But the monster underestimates Castiel, or rather, the forty-eight hours of instruction he’s received from Sam. There’s a mound of loose dirt near the alpha’s left knee, and it’s just enough space to dip his finger into the soil and draw a deep circle with lines spiking from the top. It’s an Anasazi symbol that the creature can’t cross, and Castiel is unashamedly impressed that he’s remembered it...but he is an artist, and he had spent twenty minutes yesterday mapping out a potential painting utilizing the same mark. The wendigo howls in displeasure for not being allowed passage beyond the symbol, but Castiel forces himself to block out the screeches. He grabs the magnifying glass and stares up in the sky, examining the sun.
“Hello?” Castiel grumbled, and fuck, his voice was all dark honey and whiskey and gravel and it made Dean’s cock twitch. “Yes, we’ll...we’ll do that. Thank you.”
Dean squats low, still running his hands over Cas’ thick and coarse fur, pulling stray twigs and blades of grass from his mane. “Can we…” Dean licks his dry lips and turns, looking at the tent behind him. “I gotta do this, but after—meet me at the bunker?”
Well, like the impact of an oncoming train.
the one who the people love, Dean. Not Dad. You basically rebuilt this place with your own two hands. You always help out with the farming, you fix everybody’s cars and roofs and hot water heaters. Hell, you’re the only reason we have electricity and running water to begin with. If there’s an issue everyone always asks you to mediate, because they respect you more than—”
And the man he loves may never actually know it.
Castiel was jacking him off so expertly and
However, when they turned onto the correct street, the B&B finally in sight, a realization hit him.
But he started feeling tense for an entirely different reason once Dean started measuring flour...and tossed an apron on. It was clearly a necessity as white powder dusted the countertops, thick as heavy snow, but Dean looked adorable and domestic and strangely sexy with it on. He imagined coming home to find Dean in the kitchen with an apron on, face flushed and grinning, wearing nothing else underneath…
Still linked together, the air around them had intensified—some of the professional pretext seeming to drop. Dean, true to form, tried to ease the moment with a chuckle. “You an’ everybody around here, man.”
with a man for the first time. The situation with Castiel might’ve been a reoccurring daydream, maybe even a spank-bank scenario. Would Castiel be a top? Or maybe he liked switching? Dean could certainly get on board with either possibility…
“Thank you, ma’am,” he says, using his best southern drawl, and he sees her grin widen.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean said, smiling. “You know what...I think we really do.”
But there was more to think about, more complications for why Dean should accept the space Castiel was offering. Because Castiel was a Novak—a flushed-with-cash, spearhead-a-fraternity, likely-the-future-president-of-a-multi-million-dollar-business, Novak.
After dropping off his brother, he treks up the hill and down the sloping valley, spotting the bunker from yards away. He shifts back on the outer doorstep, feeling shaken and sore, but relieved to be back on two feet again. He grabs the spare key from its typical hiding spot—twelve years later, and this knowledge is
Except...except for he can smell Dean again, and the scent is
LOTS of amazing art in this chapter, so get ready and enjoy!!
“Don’t you talk about her,” Dean growls, hands tight in fists. “Don’t you even say her name.”
And there it is, Castiel’s cue. He walks to the pyre, and—no longer perfumed in the irritating, chemical spray—Dean is immediately struck by Castiel’s scent. He puts down all his carefully placed guards and allows it to flood his system, the aroma unbearably rich and chocolatey, like a cocoa bean split open and nestled in sugar. His mouth dries, his floppy pink tongue hanging from his panting jaw. He wants to get closer to that mouth-watering fragrance, to
“You’re taking farming advice from Cas now?” Dean shot Castiel an apologetic look. “No offense, buddy.”
To make a deal with the infamous demon Fergus MacLeod.
Castiel grins wickedly, pulling a blanket over his arms.
“Are you running?” Dean spits out, all fire and fury. Sam is trying to shush him but Dean bats his brother’s hand away. “For packmaster? Are you?”
“Girl?” Dean wrinkles his forehead, confused.
Before Dean could comprehend what was happening, there were car doors slamming and opening again and then there was Sam, standing above him and pulling him up by the shoulder. Dean swayed, gripping the Impala’s exterior.
“Sam!” Dean shouts, because there’s no way he’s losing his brother here tonight, there’s just no fucking way… “You have to shift!”
The persuasive logic of their argument and the possibility of conceding was crossing Joshua’s face in tense waves. But then a deeper, more rooted emotion took hold, making Joshua’s eyes dart to the ground and his hands shake.
to lead the largest were pack in Kansas.
Dean, who’s still laying in the middle of the angel trap while Cas gets carted off to Eve, must be remembering their time together here. He’s felt Dean have this dream before, and he can feel his friend’s longing anywhere—even from across the country. Most times he’ll do all he can to shut it out and give Dean his privacy, but now he stays with Dean in the dream, if memory can be considered a dream. It was the only time he’s ever been allowed to touch Dean like that and it’s something he remembers well. He just wishes he wasn’t surrounded by Chuck’s lamest creation being carted off to pay for his crime against the Mother of all Evil, so he could take a moment and enjoy the memory.
“Dean?” Castiel says softly.
“Just, uh...thought we’d come check on Cas,” Sam explains, holding an amber vile in his hand and sloshing the contents around. “Rowena mixed up a potion for him—”
He leaned forward, planting his hand firmly on the table, his other arm landing against the side of the booth. In this position, he towered over Benny like a crouching animal ready to pounce.
“I’m frustrated that I didn’t know the details of my own life, my own history,” Castiel admits in a whisper, jaw still clenched. “But that’s as much as Bobby and the other elders as it is on you. And I’m scared for you, for the pack, for our future.”
She looks up instantly from her screen, red hair hanging down in waves. “If it was anybody else—maybe,” she admits, but then adds, “but dude, it’s
“Dad!” Sam murmurs breathlessly.
“Yeah?” Dean knows he sounds a little insecure, but he can’t seem to help it. He’s totally out of his depth here.
“If I recall correctly, we have some unfinished business in that hot tub,” Castiel whispers, his voice so low and mischievous that Dean shudders, his mouth suddenly parched.
Another missed phone call. More banging on the door. Distantly, Cas hears a loud thud from the front of the house. The living room, the front porch. The sound is like the friction of wood forced against a threshold, a door being kicked off its hinges, and then—
Castiel gripped Dean by the back of neck, took a deliberate breath, and brushed their lips together. Dean clung to the erratic, half-open collar of Castiel’s button-up shirt and opened his mouth fully, inviting Cas to give him whatever he was willing to provide. Their lips slotted together perfectly, wet and wonderful in an unpredictable pattern, with Castiel sucking on his bottom lip before Dean returned the favor, leaving small nips and dragging Castiel’s lip to him. They gripped each other by the neck and shoulders, fingers memorizing the touch, the texture of each other’s skin. Their heads tilted together, left and right, left and right, smooth and gliding as a piece of machinery. When Castiel finally deepened the kiss Dean gasped at the flick of tongue invading his mouth, making him tremble and tighten his hold in Castiel’s hair. Eventually their tongues collided, making eager contact in the space between their open mouths. It was erotic and overpowering and Dean felt his knees begin to buckle.
Castiel took a deep breath—though the action wasn’t really necessary for an angel—and tried to steady himself. He touched his lips lightly, and Dean continued to stare. “They feel much better. Thank you, Dean.”
Running.
“I wish I had my medical kit.” Sam buries his forehead in his open palm, closing his eyes. “Short of robbing a hospital closet, I can make-do with pliers, a needle and thread, hydrogen peroxide, antibiotic ointment, gauze pads, gauze wrap, adhesive tape…” He rattles off a full list, including food and water and a change of clothes for them all, and Dean drives Baby to the closest twenty-four hour supermarket. The bright overhead lights make him squint, his eyes red and puffy. As he wields his cart down the aisle, it’s strange to him that all these people he’s passing…late night shoppers, tired cashiers…
before slipping out the door, extracting himself from the unfolding mayhem and walking down the block towards Baby.
Dean thought there was a ninety-nine percent chance his heart would actually burst at the gesture, which would have been very inconvenient, considering he had a boyfriend that needed to be kissed. Now, immediately, and forever. He looped a finger around the straps of Cas’ stiff denim overalls—where had he even bought these, Home Depot?—and cupped his face in his other hand.
“Cas,” Dean said frantically, “ignore the stupid bastard and just
if you know what I mean, just from thinking about you.” Worse, worse, worse, this is way fucking worse. Cas looks at him in surprise, though noticeably pleased by this embarrassingly transparent piece of news. Dean is wishing he trusted Rowena enough to ask if she has a spell for fucking time travel, ‘cause what the actual fuck is he saying right now? He wants to abandon his body, crawl out of his own skin, and start life over somehow.
He was hauled to his feet and then Castiel was kissing him again, filthy and eager and sloppy, Cas’ come pooling between their open mouths. It was the dirtiest moments of his life, though Dean knew the whole goddamn day would be spank bank material for years to come.
direction except for Cas…'cause yeah, that nerdy hot editor of his had been a major part of that perfection. “Long story short, though, my publisher Zachariah—Anna and Cas’ boss—he hated that little sliver of gay I had written in. Enough to give me an ultimatum about writing it
Dean nods mutely but doesn’t offer any other commentary. He’s done keeping stuff from Cas—this is something they need to discuss and decide on together. Maybe in the morning, after a good long cuddle fest…
It’s why I couldn’t finish the book before Cas came and snapped me out of it.”
“Dude,” he said, “you really serenading me with Alison Krauss right now?”
“What’d ya say?” she asked, still shivering slightly.
Dean treks down the familiar slope, heading towards the bunker.
“What?” he shouted, leaning closer.
“I-I’m sorry. I should’ve said something,” Dean admitted, the back of his throat burning. “I wanted to, I really did, but Sammy told me to wait—”
Sam nodded. “I dunno, public persona versus private life? Seems like a lot to juggle, though. We should go interview his boyfriend and find out. Let’s grab some dinner, go over the files, and then head out—”
Then he spills all over Cas’ chest and abdomen.
Still facing each other, arms wrapped around each other’s sides, Castiel watched Dean’s smile fade as he closed his eyes. Soon enough his breathing was labored and sweet, and Castiel looked at the bedside clock, noticing it was barely eight o’clock. His hand drifted to Dean’s hair and ruffled it gently, taking another deep breath and realizing their scent had properly mixed now—a sugary spice that made him suddenly insatiable. They were mated, he thought with a surreal amount of self-awareness. This gorgeous, defiant, sweetly-sleeping omega was his forever.
Unfortunately for the first hour, their rehearsal is anything
“Kiss me,” he asked instead, and his boyfriend obliged, pulling Dean in by his neck and sliding their lips together soundlessly.
But during their next session he would meet Castiel the alpha.
He clapped his hands together, looking at Charlie expectantly. “So what happens now?”
His phone vibrates on the kitchen counter and he takes the opportunity to stretch and stand, exhaling deeply in his chest before reading his latest message.
But leaning towards
it. Had Castiel been thinking the same?
“What about us?” The question comes out in a rush, and Castiel squirms beneath him, wishing he could angle the omega’s chin so he could read his expression. Usually his boyfriend’s emotions are broadcasted all over his face. “What does it mean for us?”
“My brother paid me a visit a few months ago, when Father first finished his will,” Joshua explained carefully. “I’m not sure what had him more upset—our father’s illness, or knowing that I was set to inherit the company.”
He grins to himself in the dark.
Castiel instinctively scrunched his face up in protest, then swayed and grew dizzy. Given his current state, he decided that denial wasn’t his best course of action. “So are you,” he accused instead, and Dean shrugged.
“I’ll sew them back on for you,” he said, because even in his heavily aroused alpha state, he did feel bad for ruining one of Dean’s work shirts. Dean cracked an eye open and grinned up at him.
Eventually, though, Dean managed to turn him around until they were face to face. He cupped Castiel’s chin, thumb stroking his cheek gently, and Castiel leaned into the contact. He looked into Dean’s eyes, the man’s expression full of curiosity and tenderness, and Castiel felt his fury begin to evaporate.
that was supposed to fit inside of him. Jesus. Before he could lose his nerve, he pulled Castiel down for a searing kiss and rutted their hips together, pushing Cas’ finger in deeper. A moment later, Dean was breaking away from the kiss, panting and cursing, begging for a second finger. Turned out, it was much more of a stretch and took a moment to adjust; however, when Castiel began scissoring him open, whispering words of support and adoration in his ear, Dean realized how significant it would be to have Cas as his first. He felt intensely and recklessly turned-on, but also safe and completely taken care of. The combination was enough to make Dean emotional, maybe even allowing a single man tear to fall down his cheek...
“And I’m working on a computer program.” Charlie brushes a strand of red hair from her face, as if it’s an afterthought to mention, but Dean has learned not to underestimate his scrappy, badass friend. “It’ll gather every known variable about John, Cas, and their various weaknesses. It should give us concepts for future trials based on probability, so we can develop a strategy for each potential challenge.”
In-between singing, Castiel can only gape at him, wide-eyed and staring, transfixed by the man in front of him. God, he could get lost in those green eyes, could lose himself in this if he’s not careful. He wants Dean so much, too much, and his body is vibrating with the need to close the distance between them.
“Look,” Dean said finally, eyes glued to the steering wheel, “you know I’m not one for chick flick moments, which is one reason why I’d like to file last night’s rom-com behavior under ‘never to be discussed in public, or within a twenty-mile radius of my nosy fucking family.’” Castiel snorted despite himself, but Dean continued. “And the sex...well, that’s the best spank bank material of all fucking time. Best sex of my life, no joke.”
“Let me out of here,” he growls viciously, bloody fists beating into the ground. “Let me out!”
but it’s almost always mated couples, thanks to all the trust and intimacy required to be, ya know, fucked by a massive wolf. Dean never imagined he would ever have the opportunity, not after Castiel left for good, though it’s not the kind of thing alphas and omegas talk about in conversation. But Dean is suddenly wishing he had done more research on this particular kink of his, maybe read a book or at least watched some were porn, before wiggling out of his jeans and boxers and baring his ass to the warm summer air.
does his own laundry, stubborn as he is. But with him writing all day and night, I doubt he’s had the time.”
The redhead omega sighs dramatically, fist clutching a bundle of purple, long-stemmed milkweeds.
“Next time, we’ll wash up beforehand,” Castiel said, lips exploring Dean’s lower back, “and I’ll eat you out all night long until you come, untouched.”
Time stops for a moment. Dean’s skin is raised with goosebumps, his breath lodged in his throat. Castiel is singing one of Dean’s songs, a forgotten track from his first album, one that he never plays at shows because it’s too personal, too dark. It’s been years since he’s even thought about that song, but suddenly he’s transported back to the night before his dad was admitted into rehab again—his alcoholism at its breaking point—and Dean hadn’t been sure if his dad would survive the fight. He hated being in the in-between state, constantly waiting for the bottom to drop.
“Davies apparently has a nasty bout of food poisoning and refuses to work today,” Balthazar said, sounding more irritated than sympathetic. Dean winced—the industry could be cutthroat, he knew.
“Dean has many fine qualities,” Cas protested, and Dean looked down, feeling sheepish and undeserving of the compliment. Being direct wasn’t how he and Cas interacted, at least not lately. Since they had transitioned from enemies to friends, their conversations were lighter, with more joking and bantering, but rarely did they say what they were actually thinking. Well, at least Dean sure as hell didn’t. Dean thought Cas was bold, unafraid to share his opinions...if his strange distaste for Benny was any indication.
“You didn’t tell them the best part,” Anna interjected. “Well, maybe not from a legal standpoint, but...oh well. Cas punched Zachariah in the face!”
know was that the guy was definitely not into him, having mistaken Dean for a homophobic piece of garbage. So, yeah. It figured that the first man Dean considered drop-dead gorgeous would hate him. After everything that happened yesterday—the feeling was pretty much mutual. It was time to push Castiel completely out his mind.
Not a man.
“C’mon, alpha,” Dean whispered, with much more confidence than he currently posed. “Gimme your best shot.”
“He’s jealous,” his manager says simply, and though Castiel thinks that might be part of it, he believes something else is going on with Dean Winchester that’s much more complicated. He’s a country music icon and Cas has followed the man’s career for years now, knows the lyrics to nearly all his songs. He was Castiel’s inspiration all those years he played in rundown bars or on sidewalks for spare change. It never hurt that Dean is drop-dead gorgeous, single, bisexual, and seemingly funny and kind, checking all of Castiel’s boxes. As recently as two weeks ago, he fantasized about them playing a show together and hitting it off instantly… Then Balthazar had gotten a call from the country music benefit concert in the Smokies, asking Cas to join the lineup. Even though he would be incredibly jetlagged from his recent tour in the UK, he told himself that he couldn’t miss the opportunity to meet his idol and crush.
smarter than me. I have ideas, sure, but people like you come along and make them a zillion times better.”
He pulls up close to the bunker, and they heft John in through the doorway, his head lolling to the side. They shuffle down the hallway and plop him onto his bed, still fully clothed and saturated in whiskey, and Dean winces at the sight
“And a classic,” Dean defended, noticing that Cas was typing on the laptop in front of him.
“Now there’s a pretty picture,” Castiel says, half-teasing and half-serious.
“Uh, right.” Dean sorts around in his wallet, pulling out four twenties and passing them over the lane divide.
“You should do more of what you want, Dean. Life is too short to be controlled by society’s concepts of beauty.”
“Anyways…”  Dean scrambled to reform his thoughts, reaching into his mind for a way to persuade the man in front of them.  “At the funeral I told you I’m a farmer. Right?”
“I have to—”
“Better hang up soon, then, ‘fore you slap a bill on me,” he joked. “I’ll, uh, call you when I get back. Thanks Bobby.” Dean hoped Bobby understood that the “thanks” covered multiple gratitudes—thanks for calling, thanks for therapy, thanks for helping me indirectly admit that I’m madly in love with Castiel Novak…
“We gotta jump the gate,” Sam says gravely, and Dean stiffly nods, heart thrumming in his chest. He keeps waiting to see the van finally make its grand entrance. Despite everything, he’s most antsy to see Cas and make sure that he’s okay. But for now he has to focus on the task at hand, so he steels himself best he can and grips the metal post, launching himself deftly and landing on the other side. Sam follows him a moment later and they stagger forward on tip-toes, hoping beyond hope that they won’t lose the element of surprise. Azazel and the woman are still on the other side, but taking gradual steps in order to circle the tomb, and in his panic Dean increases his pace and begins to sprint. Sam is way ahead of him, though, his long legs striding forward easily.
He actually…won?
“I’ll meet you,” Dean whispers, standing to his feet. Castiel hesitates, fearing what may happen to him if he leaves Dean’s side, but staying at the scene of his attack could be unwise.
There were waves of anxiety coming off of Dean and Castiel put a steadying hand on his back. There was nothing to say, no words of comfort to offer that actually rang true. The only way out was forward.
Annnnnd on with the show!
Dean cleared his throat, head spinning. He tried his best to keep his voice level. “What do you want, Zachariah?”
“I know, just—let me say this.” Castiel took a deep breath, grasping the table. “I never understood how the queen could have so many lovers. I mean,
Castiel feels like grinning, like weeping, like hugging his newfound family with every remaining ounce of strength inside him. The weeks of animosity, of him and John vying for packmaster, seems overwhelmingly absurd now. Perhaps with Azazel gone, John will finally start to heal…will be a proper father to Sam and Dean, and a supportive father-in-law for Castiel. Maybe John will become the packmaster after all, or maybe Castiel, or Gabriel…he really couldn’t care less at this point because they
“Was I too late?” Castiel’s voice was gravely, the absence of Dean’s dick in his mouth making his mouth feel strangely open. “Did I just perform fellatio on the ghost of Dean Winchester?”
Holy shit, they had hooked up last night! Cas had given him the best the blowjob of his life! Also, he apparently found it super sexy that Dean wore panties! What the actual fuck kind of dream was Dean having? Had any of it actually happened?
“Guys, seriously—”
“A traitor. Someone who double-crossed them.” Dean’s fingernails rake against the glass whiskey bottle, the sound filling up the room. “Fuck. What a fucking mess.”
“So it’s true then?” Dean stepped closer, the three of the forming a misshapen circle. He tucked his hands into his jean pockets, nervous. “Chuck is really your dad?”
Dean groaned dramatically, clearly as distraught about the rush as Castiel was. “Shower time, then?” Dean gave him one more pecking kiss before rising up and off the bed. Castiel followed suit, and once they were vertical again Dean looked down, regarding Castiel’s erection with a mischievous grin. “Hey, Cas...since we’re on a countdown and all...what’s the fastest way to get you off?”
“I said, I would like you to penetrate me, please, if you’d like.”
Castiel stands outside the front door of Dean’s cabin feeling jittery and nervous. It’s been several hours since he had accepted the man’s invitation, and now he’s doubting himself, wondering if he made the right decision. He has no idea why Dean invited him over tonight, but this means a lot to Castiel—he’s been daydreaming about the famous Dean Winchester for as long as he can remember. He hasn’t quite figured the guy out yet, and doesn’t know what to expect on the other side of that door…
really and sincerely fucking growls, and Dean thinks he might come just from the sound alone. The alpha nudges Dean’s hand away with a frenzied motion and wraps his fist around their cocks, damp now with Dean’s slick, and begins a hurried, desperate sort of rubbing.
“He came to last Friday’s session with a black eye,” Castiel said, by way of explanation. “He was very…distant. Angry.”
Castiel held the microphone, his heart pounding erratically in his chest. He couldn’t believe Dean had put him on the spot like this...though he supposed it was payback, a playful retaliation he should’ve expected. Clearly this man would never stop finding ways to drive him crazy—in the best and worst ways. He coughed quietly, his throat feeling dry.
Dean clears his throat, blinking as he throws out the remainder of his lunch. No offense to Danielle, but she’s not a children’s librarian trying to maintain a decent reputation. He really can’t afford to keep daydreaming about a total stranger, especially one he’s never gonna see again. Why the hell has Castiel gotten stuck in his subconscious like this? Dean gets hit on pretty regularly, and can go down to the Roadhouse on any given day and find someone to take home. That’s what he needs, he decides, just a random barfly to scratch this itch. He texts Benny right then to see if he’s down to get into some trouble after work.
“Thank you,” Castiel told her, expression soft and honest. “Your name again…?”
Dean snorted and shook his head, obviously not expecting such an honest answer.
It seems like a century ago that they were having rut sex, but it’s only been less than three hours and Dean wants it again, needs it, can’t imagine an hour in the day when he’s not writhing on his alpha’s dick.
Dean narrows his eyes at both of them, officially crabby. He’s also had two stout drinks and not enough to eat, so he’s feeling a little off-kilter. Maybe they should order cheese fries… That’s definitely not on his stupid diet, but screw it. Dean deserves some fun—he just finished a worldwide tour, and all he wants to be doing is relaxing back home in Lawrence.
He’s shaking, whimpering from the aftershocks, but it only take a few moments of labored breathing before he returns to his task. Without any distractions his blowjob technique is expert level, every swipe of the tongue and back-throat swallow making Castiel writhe beneath him, holding onto his omega’s hips so roughly he worries he might leave marks.
“Must be a generational thing,” Leo mumbled, and Dean tried not to glare.
“I’m sorry I made you do it. I’m really, fucking sorry Cas. I was just messing around, but I never thought about what might come of it. The whole thing was freaking idiotic on my part. I can’t even tell you how much I regret doing that to you—”
“Cas,” he mutters into the comforter, shuffling onto his elbows a bit, “I’m not sure this is…”
But honestly though, I am still REELING from my first convention experience. It was freaking amazing.
Twenty minutes later, he carts the supplies into their hotel room and cracks open a bottle of water. Sam is freshly showered, though wearing his soiled outfit from before, and Dean tosses him an off-brand pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. Sam comes back from the bathroom changed and looking grateful, then sorts through the makeshift medical supplies, sterilizing everything thoroughly over the bathroom sink. Castiel is still passed out and shivering, but Sam stirs him awake and asks Dean to help hold the alpha steady.
“What the hell does that mean?” He speaks instinctively, though he knows exactly
Cas stared blankly at him.
Then Castiel turns and walks back inside, leaving Dean with a dazed look in his eyes and a blush setting on his cheeks.
Jessica laughed, her face theaterically dismayed. “Sam, your brother is a disgusting pig!” she called out.
“It sure as hell wasn’t to get fired, I can tell you that much.” Dean felt the truth stumble out of his mouth before he could stop to regroup, to gather himself again. “I work sixty hours a week at my uncle’s auto-shop, but it still ain’t enough to cover my little brother’s school stuff. He got a full ride to Stanford, but there’s still senior trips and class rings and did you know a high school
Castiel propelled his cock deeper and faster and they both moaned instantaneously, muttering each other names over and over. By the erratic rhythm alone Dean could tell the alpha was close, on the precipice of something staggering, and he had the urge to touch his cock—but decided against. He could come, untouched, if only…
“We’re talking about another war,” Ellen says bluntly. “We’re talking about John’s not-so-secret plan to attack the demons again, to avenge Mary’s death. And—” She sighs and tips the flask back. “We’re talking about
“What?” Dean mumbled, a light blush reddening his cheeks. “It’s not all cars and pies up here, ya know.” He patted his temple with a finger for good measure.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean mutters, opening the front flap for any sort of note. He never quite considered the negative impacts his gambit could have, but it seems picking the longest and most tedious read for his exchange means he’s receiving the same treatment in return. Obviously whoever’s tasked with reading
Dean shrugs, nonplussed by the news. “Makes sense.” He takes another long swallow from his cup, and when he glances back up from the dark brew, Sam is staring at him with a measured scowl. A classic bitch face.
“Yeah, I, uh…” Dean pulled into his driveway and parked, but kept the car idling. “I think I have a crush. On Cas, I mean.”
“Because…” Castiel shifts in Dean’s lap, hoping his weight isn’t too heavy. “They’re sort of contradictions, aren’t they?”
“No, I mean…really touch you.”
“You never finished,” Castiel whispered, and when Dean squinted his eyes in confusion, he continued, “telling me what your other ‘fine qualities’ are.”
“Uh, yeah, will do,” Dean said, face turning red. Cas tilted his head, probably wondering what could possibly be happening
“Don’t,” Dean warns, his voice a calculated threat, but Castiel pushes him away with every ounce of emotional strength he has left. He’s completely mixed-up by Dean’s reaction, when earlier he had seemed completely accepting of Castiel’s fate. But he can’t think of that now, can’t allow himself to wallow in whatever damage this is doing to his relationship with Dean.
“Oh fuck, Cas,” Dean cries.
He squeezes Dean’s wrist reassuringly, and whispers, “Can I see you after…?” It’s as intimate as he’s willing to be with John watching them, but there are so many things he wants to do with Dean while he’s home…so many conversations they need to have. Dean only nods, though seems less irritated than he had a moment ago. He waves a quick goodbye and heads east, towards the community center, while Castiel and John remain north. They’re only a few yards away from the edge of the tree cover, and once they reach the property again, Castiel notices lights on every porch and strings of lanterns scalloped in the trees. He can see John properly for the first time, and fights the urge to cringe. His earlier suspicions had been correct...the alpha looks worn around the edges, both bulky and haggard. It reminds Cas of the people he’s encountered in the city—a sort of blank and hopeless expression blanketing their features.
“Uh, I hadn’t invited anyone else,” he confesses, rubbing his hands together then reaching for his spatula. “But, y’know, I can call some people up. Benny’s in the cabin next door, and Charlie’s just down the road. Sam has a hotel room in Pigeon Forge, but he can be here in twenty minutes or less—”
“There was a riot here in 1969, which is where the first pride parade comes from. At the time, it was illegal to serve gay people alcohol or or for them to dance with one another.” Dean’s eyes widened in surprise, and Castiel shook his head solemnly, continuing. “During a typical raid, men who dressed in drag, women who weren’t wearing three pieces of feminine clothing, and most of the bar employees, were arrested.”
“No joke here, honey. The association is making an effort to be more inclusive, so the classic ‘love song’ performance was chosen for you two instead. Isn’t it exciting?” Her smile begins to falter as she takes in their slack-jawed expression. “You don’t seem too happy.”
Sam rolled his eyes, shut his computer mid-game, and collected the stray garbage from his earlier snack—a bag of veggie straws and a can of fresca—before heading towards his bedroom and shutting the door.
“Dean!” Sam’s voice is laced with concern, his large palm shaking Dean by the shoulder. “C’mon, wake up!”
Before the war he had been unacquainted with death, the idea of losing a fellow were inconceivable at best. But then the demons had come, and at fifteen years old, he could only watch as his pack members burned to ash. Some were beaten until they choked for air, others had their hearts ripped from their chest. His mother had gone toe-to-toe with the demon leader, Azazel, and ended up a bent and bloody heap in his father’s arms. All told, they had crafted over fifteen funeral pyres that day—a third of them for the Novaks. Now, shedding his clothes and folding them by the back door, Dean feels ill just imagining how closely one of those bodies could’ve been Cas.
“Your agent friend, with the gorgeous eyes?” Leo guessed. “What was his name? Townshend?”
A moment later Cas paused to locate the lube. Afterwards he slipped Dean’s panties to the side, looking down at him.
“Can you blame me?” Charlie retorted, apparently having her defense ready and waiting. “I’ve read both of your reports, Dean. You and Castiel have grown...close...”
Mentioning Sam, Dean wondered how he was doing at the morgue, examining the body of Aaron Samuels—a twenty-two year old man who had died at Holy Grail just last night. His injuries suggested he had been stoned to death, yet he had died in the middle of a crowded dance floor...with not a single stone in sight.
“Sorry,” Dean mumbles, and he genuinely does feel bad—it was irresponsible of him to wait this long. “Haven’t exactly been on two feet since I, uh, heard the news.”
Distantly, as if he’s underwater and someone is calling his name from the shore, he hears a man clear his throat and approach them. He scents the air, chest heaving, and fights the urge to snarl. The interrupter isn’t an alpha, which is perhaps the only thing keeping Castiel from hurling himself forward in a possessive claim, because he’s with his omega and he wants to mate him, bite him, keep him safe and protected and sated and hot and moaning, his his his
“I see him,” Bobby breathes on the other end, “him and Gabriel both. They’re roughed up, but alive.”
“Wow,” Dean breathes, not sure what he’s more attracted to now—Castiel’s body or his huge ass brain. He’s incredibly intelligent, but somehow still down-to-earth and kind underneath layers of self-assurance. On anyone else, this sort of talk would come across as boring or pretentious, but with Castiel it’s fascinating even for Dean, an avid nonbeliever. “That’s like…crazy impressive, Cas.”
“Never said I wasn’t,” Castiel replies flirtily, crossing his arms and looking his fill. If this morning’s weather is anything to go off of, it’s officially summer, which…Castiel has no qualms about. Dean is golden brown and firmly muscled, still wearing denim and a form-fitting t-shirt when all Castiel can think of is stripping him bare.
Content warning: Canonical Character Death
“Who?” he demanded.
He didn’t fully recognize that he was running until he was stumbling out the front door, chasing Castiel onto the sidewalk. Dean shouldn’t have bothered running, though—Castiel was just outside scrolling on his phone, likely hailing an uber for a ride back to the airport.
“Me too,” she agreed softly. They shared a moment of comfortable silence, listening to the ancient furnace creak to life, the wind gusts outside shrill as a whistle.
Dean balanced two arm-fulls of groceries, unsteady and slipping, fumbling to find his house key. Castiel was inside their cabin, undoubtedly pacing in his office, but Dean refused to ring the doorbell and break his concentration. Cas had a god-awful case of nerves about tonight, and after three years together, Dean knew well enough to let Cas process things on his own time. He would respect that, no matter how desperately Dean wanted to throw the groceries down, run inside, and kiss every single one of Castiel’s problems away... And hey, if kisses weren’t distracting enough, there were plenty of other options...
“Jesus fuck...” Dean’s voice was rough and wrecked and Castiel pumped him faster, watching Dean’s reaction and getting even more turned on by it. “Please don’t stop.”
Because once he starts, Castiel will never stop.
“Where’s your phone?” Sam asked, exasperated.
feelings with you, and—”
“What this lovely little stalk of Minnesotan sweet corn is trying, and failing miserably, to ask,” Crowley interjected, “is if you and your navy-suited doppelgänger over there are doing the manky panky, enjoying the back passage, fondling each other’s dangly bits?”
of him—
Whew! There in a pine fest headed your way, folks. Take a deep breath and dive on in.
“Well, that was different. Swallowing pre-approved come is fine,” he mumbles. “It’s sneaky potion come that I ain’t putting anywhere near my mouth.”
Dean scoffed, his tone light. “No worries, Cas. I ain’t afraid of no ghost.”
“Smile, Cassie. You’ll scare off Tim McGraw,” Balthazar whispers with a nudge. Cas tears his eyes away from his stare down with Dean to see McGraw waving him over, looking jovial, and Castiel plasters on a fake grin and tries to appear pleasant. He’s met most of these performers before at various award shows, though it’s still bizarre to be respected by pillars in the genre when Castiel grew up listening to them. Not everyone is here yet, of course, since the concert is several hours long and they’ll be rehearsing in waves throughout the day. It still feels surreal, being surrounded by a group of such talented performers, and he tries to focus on his peers instead of the impishly annoying Dean Winchester.
“Dean Winchester…the most self-righteous omega in Kansas,” he grumbles lightheartedly. He elbows Dean’s arms, the touch warm and lingering. “Nice to see some things haven't changed.”
Morning, y'all!
There’s just enough time for him to grab two syringes. Hurriedly he tucks one between his teeth and palms the other before the hoard is on him. He throws his arm out wildly, and has to stop himself from thanking God when he feels the needle push through flesh.
“We do,” Dean concedes to brother, wiping thoughts of Cas and blowjobs out of his head for now, ‘cause yeah…ew. Not with Sammy around. “But you gotta know that what happened with that asshole at the bar—it’s not something I go ‘round advertising. It was an embarrassing fucking night for me and not one I wanna relive.”
He felt strange wearing such casual clothing, not to mention Dean’s casual clothing, but this wasn’t the first hunt that had required unfamiliar apparel. The outfit Sam had selected wasn’t a perfect fit— considering Dean was slightly taller and bulker—but the bagginess didn’t bother him. What did bother him was that he smelled like Dean...like his detergent, of course, but Castiel could pick up on much more than that. Angels have superior senses, and Dean’s clothes were old, carrying years of musk and sweat and sweetness. Castiel followed Dean into the club feeling dazed and distracted.
And then his stomach drops.
“See if you’re getting laid tonight,” Dean grumbled half-heartedly, though he didn’t mean it. Honestly, Cas would likely have much easier time withholding sex than Dean would. Damn. They had been official for like, three whole days, and Dean was already whipped. He slid off the counter and stirred his simmering chilli, estimating it would be ready in about ten minutes, staring down at the mixture and avoiding Sam’s gaze.
Dean’s always been good in a crisis, and he runs in the direction of the commotion, Sam and Benny hot on his heels. There’s a middle-aged woman in the grass, clutching a leather bound book. Dean’s had the right training for this, and when someone reaches down to grab the book from her, he shoves a hand onto the guy’s chest. He kicks the book instead, knowing a cursed object requires contact with human skin.
Castiel drew in breath. “Fuck, Dean,” he said, unable to look away. For some reason, Dean
“Only if we add ‘merciless tease’ to yours.” Castiel continued his trail of concentrated kisses on Dean’s neck, but snuck a hand slowly down and palmed the front of Dean’s panties. Dean shuddered as Cas brushed over his erection, fingertips lightly grazing but not providing enough pressure.
,” Dean said, his tone hard. “But some things—like orgasms—are private, you know.”
“You’re beautiful,” he whispered reverently, not even intending to say it out loud—but that was the power this man had over him. The influence of his presence, his being, his scent, was all at once tremendously overwhelming and enormously freeing. Each and every day, Castiel’s words were careful and measured, thoughtful and guarded. But with Dean…
So. Let's. Do. This.
“Uh, sorry, didn’t mean to run off like that. Just needed a minute,” he mumbles lamely. He wants Castiel to go and let him sulk in peace, but a much larger part of him wants Castiel to stay.
. And we can borrow the Colt from you whenever we want.” Dean’s hands are in fists and he’s trying
“Well,” she says loudly, a grin plastered on her face, “that was certainly…interesting…”
Dean’s head jerked towards his brother so quickly he wondered if he pulled a neck muscle. Leaving Cas’ gaze felt surreal, even startling, as if just remembering there was a world outside of them that had continued spinning.
“He’s fading quickly,” Rowena mumbles, eyes still closed. “He hasn’t moved towards the light yet. He won’t…he’s not going to make it…”
for me.”
“Wait, what?” Dean shouted, his voice rising several octaves. “What the fuck—no! We weren’t fighting! It was the opposite!”
They’re in the woods, his entire family racing together, his father immeasurably large and brown at the front. His mother isn’t far behind, smaller and lightly black, and he’s flanked by Anna and his brothers. Something is peculiar about this but he’s too busy running, claws digging and loosening the soil, leaping over tree roots and fallen branches. He can communicate with his family if he concentrates on reaching their consciousness, and he looks at his siblings, rattles his snout playfully, and thinks:
Thirty minutes later, Balthazar finally came to visit Dean in his dressing room. Dean had been expecting him for a while now—the designer usually came to greet him as soon as he arrived, being one of the chattier and more flamboyant people Dean had ever met.
“You’ll get a show of some variety, trust me,” Castiel murmurs suggestively, his hands sliding back to Dean’s hips. He fingers the stretchy elastic of Dean’s underwear, slipping his hands underneath. “May I?”
“Your car, everyone in town knows it,” Castiel said reasonably. “Do you really want to explain to Donna and Doug why you stayed overnight?” He hated to even consider it, especially after being out for so many years, but Dean was still closeted. Castiel wanted to be sensitive of that fact.
“Seems like a full-time job,” Castiel says with a chuckle, and Dean grunts, debating on if he should kick Castiel’s shin under the table.
He spotted Sam sitting on the couch, his lap filled with case files, and they made small talk. When he turned around, Jessica was barreling down the hallway, an oversized hamper in her arms. “Can you believe two people can have
“I can think of a few things,” Dean said. Without warning, he spun around in Castiel’s grip, holding him by the hips, until they were nose to nose. Castiel’s heart began race—Dean’s lips were pink and wet, his eyes staring at Castiel’s mouth.
of us,” he growls, taking a step closer to the table and out of Bobby’s reach. John stands up abruptly, the feet of his wooden chair scraping against the concrete floor.
“About that Dick guy,” Sam answers, and his voice is sad now, melancholy. “Dean, if I had known an alpha messed with you—”
“N-No, Cas, you’re gonna be way too tight man,” he protests, hands on Castiel’s hips in an attempt to halt him. “You gotta let me prep you. We need…fuck, we need lube.”
“But before I go, I’d like to…” He searched for the right words. Stay in touch? Exchange emails? It all seemed too nonchalant, too inconsequential. “Remain a part of your life. If you’ll have me, of course.”
Sam glances between them as though he wants to ask a million questions, but at that instant, Dick begins shouting at an absurd volume about
“I’m talking about sharing the responsibility of taking care of Dad, so
, as a person, and how he’s—”
“Don’t you go telling Castiel all of this,” Bobby says quietly, peering over his shoulder in a soundless way that makes Dean jump.
“I’m sorry two weeks wasn’t fast enough for me to quit my job, Dean,” Castiel said sardonically. “As far as doing what’s best for
Sam looks floored at the suggestion but Dean just sighs, hanging his head. “Let’s just say…he likes to rough up omegas. Force them into shit.” His voice is grave, carved in stone. “Never had the chance with me, but he damn well tried.”
“No,” Charlie says patiently. “I don’t. That’s why I’m asking.”
“Just because I don’t have magic doesn’t mean I don’t
best friend first, you know.”
I am very sorry for this cliffhanger, I just had SO MUCH plot I needed to explore here. So after doing some final touches, I'm going to post the next chapter ~extra early~ for you babes!!!!
Dean doesn’t necessarily want to get out of the water, but he wants to get off much more, so he scrambles to the side of the hot tub. There’s just enough space on the outer edge for him to rest his head and shoulders, feet planted in the curve of a seat, his ass and dick both open to access.
Their friends bring Sam and Dean to their feet, asking a million questions that Dean feels too woozy to answer. Of course he wants to know how a cursed book ended up at the library—and how it got past all their security charms. It’s an unsettling question he’ll have to think about later. Sam does a good job of recounting the situation to Charlie and Jo, and by the time he’s finished, the emergency medical team has taken over. They approach Sam and Dean, but they both wave them off steadily, requesting that they focus on the woman instead. They move a few yards away from the crowd, needing some air.
Castiel’s eyes are gleaming, and Dean doesn’t know him well enough to read all the emotions on his face, but he can’t look away. “You mean ass
I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS CHAPTER. This has been a long time coming, and I'm so glad we've finally arrived. If my betas' reactions are any indication, heh, you guys are gonna love it. This one is on the longer side, and I nearly split it into two chapters, but I decided I wasn't THAT evil, and should just go on and share.
“Hey fellas,” Dean greets conversationally, with feigned cheerfulness, as if being dragged away from Cas mid-makeout sesh isn’t the most annoying part of his day. In the back of his mind, he knows his brief interaction with his alpha had been a bit...off. Hot yet strange, which was Cas in a nutshell. It left him wanting so much more. He had been dying to jump Cas’ bones good and proper for forever, but the timing had been wrong. It was only three days until the second trial…was Cas panicking? Had Dean just been a distraction, a way to resist the doom and gloom?
The panties were black lace with embroidered white flowers on the side, boyshorts slung low on his hips. Dean’s dick was compressed inside the fabric, the outline of his erection huge and heavy and absolutely obscene, and Castiel put his mouth against it without a moment’s warning. Dean moaned from the shock of it, thrashing and gripping the bedspread as if hanging on for dear life.
“Huh.” Dean burrows in closer, trying to not think about the fact that he is definitely,
He just hopes it’ll be enough.
Until John Winchester breathes his last breath.
“Don’t want you to stop,” Dean answers huskily. His lips are grazing Castiel’s neck and the alpha shivers involuntarily, trying not to think about how many times he’s imagined this same scenario in his mind the past few hours. Dozens of times. Hundreds, maybe. “Want you to fuck me six ways to Sunday, Cas, knot me up real fucking good, and then I’m gonna kick your ass for not calling me to come help. Got it?”
they were hit Castiel all at once. It was Sunday morning, sure, but why had Zachariah instructed them to meet here...in his recently deceased father’s apartment?
that he almost whines.
But Crowley is already pulling Bobby into a harsh and vehement lip-lock, and Dean looks away on instinct, wondering if there’s ever been an interaction more awkward than the one he’s witnessing right now. When he hears the smack of lips parting, he grimaces and warily eyes them again.
“Of course I remember,” the omega interrupts quietly, longingly, with reverence. “Kinda hard to forget a kiss like that, Cas.”
“Shit,” he whispered, finishing his sentence while also remarking upon his current situation, cause...
“Yeah, take your pretty girlfriend there and go home!”
his heart might burst. If Cas already thought he was reckless, maybe it was time to prove it. Keeping his head angled, both of them still lying shoulder-to-shoulder on the ground, he reached for Castiel’s hand. Their fingers intertwined instinctively, as if they had always done this, as if every moment they had spent together was building up to this. The expression on Castiel’s face was difficult to decipher. Surprised? Excited? Afraid? Either way, he tightened his long fingers around Dean’s and they shifted their bodies closer, desperate for more contact. Finally touching Cas after weeks of resisting was intoxicating.
Dean chuckles darkly, opening his eyes and wiping the sleep from his eyes. “Whatever I feel for Cas doesn’t matter. Lawrence is barely a blip on his radar, man. Can’t get attached to someone I can’t have.”
“Which is?”
“I have to ask you a question,” Castiel begins steadily, hoping he has the courage to do so, but Chuck just holds up a finger.
Dean 2:31 AM >>
The implication of something
You should know that the correct answer is D)
“Cas?” Sam questions, smirking suggestively, and Dean rolls his eyes. “Seems like you two have picked up right where you left off.”
The odds of his first kiss with a dude being fucking awesome were well in Dean’s favor.
“And what if he doesn’t like this ambush method? What if he gets violent?”
“And the wedding?” Castiel’s voice is muted and low and practically slurred, still distracted by thousands of overstimulated nerve endings on his knot.
Castiel turned abruptly, narrowing his eyes. “Where?”
It worked, thank the fucking cosmos, ‘cause suddenly Cas was palming Dean’s dick from outside his jeans and dragging his wet lips fervently across the slope of Dean’s neck. Dean trembled and moaned, already so fucking ready to get naked—and more importantly, get
“You know, this is the problem with authors...no practicality, an overactive imagination.” Zachariah shook his head, making a condescending
“And you shared your feelings with me, Dean, but I haven’t been able to share
Castiel pulls away slightly, gazing around at the hot tub as if he’s trying to figure out logistics, and then says, “Sit up there, sweetheart.”
Dean shakes his head and snorts. If you put their situation in black and white, his boyfriend beating the shit out of his dad would probably fall into the “fuck yeah, I’m angry” category. But their circumstances are as sticky and tangled up as a pot of overcooked spaghetti noodles and Dean hasn’t had any time to sort through all the bullshit. When pleading and physical force hadn’t worked, Rowena had used magic to separate the two alphas, and Dean had all but drug Castiel home by the collar. So…is he angry with Cas?
“I really want that, too,” Castiel admits, mumbling against his skin, and Dean tries not to get too excited by this prospect. It’s not as if he didn’t think it would ever happen—this is what fuck buddies do, right?
“The honeymoon chase,” Dean translates for him instantly, before Castiel can even show his confusion. “We’d have to shift. The alpha is supposed to chase the omega, and everyone chases behind us until, uh…”
So let's take a little quiz.
“Does anyone know ‘Tennessee Whiskey’?” Castiel asks mildly, and the crowd reacts just as they expect—standing, cheering, shouting. This song has been around for decades, but Chris Stapleton recently made it popular again. Castiel and Dean both smile giddily, and then, Dean plays the first chord. Castiel adjusts his guitar, checks the mic briefly, and then joins in.
Dean sighs with relief, feeling a little foolish. “So, I’m not like, under your spell or something?”
said?” Charlie corrects, with a pointed giggle. Dean laughs with her and positions the last box, feeling momentarily unburdened until he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket. He scrambles to check messages:
“So,” he says, hoping he sounds conversational, “anything I can do to help?”
It’s Dean’s turn to be quiet and introspective, staring forward at his dash. Every molecule in his body is telling him to ignore Sam’s advice, to play Russian roulette and see if something good happens. No matter how illogical that might be—Azazel is after all Novaks, Cas could still die in the third trial, and they’re not even mated or married yet. The cards are stacked much more firmly in the “this isn’t the time to start a family” category, but Dean is filled with a stubborn certainty that he needs to wait it out and see what happens.
“You had me at burgers,” Castiel says, giving Dean a short peck on the lips before climbing over him and heading towards the bathroom. “How do you feel about shower sex?”
“Jesus Christ, Cas,” Dean groaned, voice muffled by his hands, “remind me later to tell you again what an ‘innuendo’ is.”
worth it.
“Sam, I just—I would like to know—” Castiel hadn’t realized that he needed Sam’s approval before further pursuing things with Dean, but it was becoming apparent that he did.
“You would be amazed at all the things I know,” Crowley says offhandedly, though he’s distracted now, rummaging inside his pockets. His phone is buzzing—Dean can hear it thanks to their close proximity. “Duty calls, ‘m afraid. Feel free to take a moment, debate my offer amongst yourselves, while I take this call.”
Once they were all gathered, staring at the front door as if it might bite them, Dean surprisingly broke the silence.
The first time Dean Winchester ended up in Mr. Novak’s office, it wasn’t by choice.
“Me too,” Dean says, scrubbing a hand against his face and hiding back a grin. “So, when did you start playing music?”
There was a pause, and Dean wondered if Zachariah’s cool facade was finally beginning to slip...but in no universe was Dean Winchester that lucky.
They no longer had a need for words.
“Y’all talk a lot?” he asked, wondering if Cas would know him. Maybe he should wave him over...but he noticed then that Cas wasn’t standing beside Anna anymore. Strange. Maybe he was mingling somewhere, out of sight?
“Wait a minute,” she said slowly. “I called Castiel your boyfriend and...you only said no because he’s ‘better’ than you, or whatever.”
“You rang?” Sam said sarcastically, eyebrow raised. He had spent all day trying to get Dean to open up, and standing now in the archway, he looked rather skeptical. Apparently, he no longer felt confident in Dean’s ability to open up.
Thanks again for all the love this story has received! You guys honestly keep me going. <3
After trading a few lazy kisses, Dean broke away to go knock on Sam’s door, closing it behind him. Castiel wandered around the apartment, taking in the domesticity, the feeling of warmth and family that covered every inch of the space. In a flash that made his heart race, he imagined him and Dean having a home of their own one day, a place they owned together that Dean could pour every part of himself into. Despite the omega’s occasionally gruff exterior, Castiel knew now it was largely a facade. He saw the potted plant that had been carefully watered, the pantry overflowing with groceries, the framed photo of their mother on the mantle. He knew what these small touches meant, knew the love and reverence that went into them.
you’re doing tomorrow, I meant to
Cas closed his browser and glared impatiently. Dean had been avoiding his glance all day, mostly because Sam had been around and annoyingly observant. But there was a variety of stronger reasons he had been dodging the angel’s gaze. On a subscious level, Dean was battling his own confusion (
Dean 6:17 PM  >>
Castiel surged forward without another thought, fueled by rage and adrenaline, arms positioned and ready to strike.  He swung his fist wildly, desperate to make contact with Benny’s jaw, but before he could properly throttle the Louisianian pervert who clearly had a death wish, there were hands holding him back. Castiel innately knew it was Dean behind him, hands pulling him by the elbow, repeating Castiel’s name over and over again in an attempt to calm him down. By this time, the whole bar seemed fascinated by the spectacle, and Ash and Garth came over to help Sam take hold of Benny. Castiel kept his eyes fixated on the man until they were out the door, but even then, his whole body was stiff with anger and rage.
“Jonathan doesn’t like to talk about it,” she interrupted, waving a vague hand towards her husband upstairs, seemingly ready for Dean’s question. She scooted her chair forwarded, voice hushed. “But there are reasons his great-great grandfather’s death was especially...scandalous.”
Dean stared at his lips, barely comprehending a word he was saying. “What, my...oh. Right.” Being this close together, smelling the earth and the river and Castiel’s detergent, was making him feel dizzy. “All tapped out on those, sorry.”
It’s not that
“Gabriel.” The man reached over the counter, offering his hand to shake. Dean looked between the outstretched hand and the door, and took a side step, shaking Gabriel’s hand hesitantly. Before Dean could offer up his own name, Gabriel continued.
how,” Anna said smugly. “Cas and I have a plan, but we need all hands on deck.”
Sam and Dean appeared in the doorway. Castiel allowed himself to look away long enough to search Dean’s face, the hunter’s eyes wide and panicked. “Cas,” he shouted, tossing him an iron bar. Castiel caught it with one hand and gripped it tightly.
“Uh, hey’a Sammy.” He took a long sip of his abandoned beer and tented his vision with a raised hand. “Enjoyin’ your time swimming with the sharks?”
“Well…” Dean swallows, staring down at his hands. “There’s, uh, one more thing.”
Slowly the guests began to leave, either for home or hotels. Castiel began making plans with their out-of-town guests, but Dean pulled them aside conspiratorially, making vague promises to “text them later.”  Castiel wrinkled his eyebrows, but shrugged. It was possible Dean had made plans he needed to rearrange.
“Dean?”
“Technically I already have. About...three minutes ago. According to my inbox,” Anna answered briskly. Castiel scoffed in surprise—she had emailed her resignation just moments ago, while Castiel was still in the room? What in the world was happening?
“Knew it,” Sam said, his eyes beaming.
Dean tucked his hands into his pockets. “Thanks,” he mumbled. “That’s...uhh, decent of you.”
On the day of the shoot, everything seemed to go wrong. Dean woke up late, didn’t have time to grab coffee, and was forced to park his Impala on the street.
“Got a thing,” Castiel crowded against him, their lips a breath apart, “for you.”
having spotted the fire heavy in his fist. But there’s nowhere to run here, not in this magical cage of Rowena’s making, and the wendigo is fully backed into a corner by the time Castiel sinks the lit torch violently into the creature. It flings and wails and stumbles over to Castiel, burning the tops of his exposed feet and shins. The alpha cries as the flames scorch and scald his skin, but manages to run far enough that the wendigo can no longer use the spreading blaze against him. Castiel covers his burns in loose dirt and wheezes with considerable effort, watching the beast finally burn to ash, immobile in the grass.
Dean didn’t have much of an argument for that, so he rolled his head back to the ground, closing his eyes. Fuck, he really needed to show Cas how to throw a proper punch. He could’ve avoided a sprained wrist if he’d known better.
That might just drive Dean crazy.
He finally looks sheepish, as if he just realizes he’s been wandering around naked for the better part of two hours. Dean can’t fucking help it.
Hearing his words repeated by Cas broke the tension, and Dean laughed freely. He felt relieved, though he didn’t understand why. If Cas was getting some action, he should be celebrating….not sulking. “Dude, then what the hell?”
Castiel followed shortly after, as Dean suspected he would, and slumped forward, head resting on Dean’s back. They rested quickly in the afterglow, chest expanding and contracting in a matching rhythm, and Dean was so filled with love that he had to say
“I came onto you, but you took some convincing—”
“My definition of ‘fun’ reading is translating the Book of Knowledge from the original Sanskrit,” Castiel says with a self-deprecating smile. “I spend too much time buried in my research.”
“That’s my girl,” Ellen says, the pride in her voice evident. “Though, Dean nearly gave her a heart attack that day. Handling a cursed object and gettin’ poisoned…” She smacks Dean on the shoulder suddenly and he hisses in surprise. “What were you thinking, jumping in like that?”
He’s thrown himself into the act and Dean moans from the lewdness of it, the recklessness. He’s getting stretched all to hell and it feels so goddamn amazing, his hole dribbling now with slick and saliva, but he needs more.
“The alpha catches his prey,” Jo supplies, in an exaggerated tone and with an outrageous wink. Dean’s cheeks burn pink and he scoffs, looking away, but his scent gives him away to Castiel. There’s a spice there that wasn’t present before—intrigue, interest, arousal.
“Like you two have much room to talk,” he pointed out.
Castiel wrinkled his eyebrow, tilting his head instinctively. “I don’t know…what are my options?”
He’s totally about to get fucked by a huge-ass wolf.
Castiel rubs his face in exhaustion and sighs. “Yes?”
Dean nodded. “No idea who or why, though. We’ll need Sam to do some research, cause this whole, ghost-inside-a-church-turned-gay-club thing is just...too much.”
“Lucky,” Hannah says, clearly not sensing Dean’s ironic tone and crossing her arms conversationally. “I haven’t seen this one in almost two years. But oh, his show in Paris—you cannot imagine how much champagne we had that night…”
Dean pulled his duffel opened and drenched the cross in holy water. Sam flicked his lighter open, looking at Dean, then paused. “Burning a cross, um...you think we’ll go to hell—again?”
“Shoot,” Dean says, trying to sound casual.
Castiel’s face flushed, uncomfortable with the attention being turned on him. “I just do what I can, like any other writer,” he mumbled.
When he finally unlocked the screen of his phone—his battery life severely depleted—he discovered it was ten o’clock in the morning. Huh. His eyebrows raised in surprise. Those must be some high quality, light-blocking curtains in the room. Apart from hangover or illness, he hadn’t slept this late in a long time. He found Dean’s still-sleeping form curled on his side, hand clutching the sheet, and smiled. They had both needed the rest after such a physically and emotionally exhausting day, clearly. But for Castiel, it was more than that. Being in Dean’s presence made Castiel feel settled…safe and wanted in a way he had never felt before.
Ah, there you have it folks. This is the official end of the story. However, I have a VERY SATISFYING epilogue planned out that I think you'll wanna stick around for. :) Gimme a few days to crank it out, and I'll post it ASAP.
“Either,” he admits, then adds, “But for you, sweetheart, I’d bottom all night long.”
“Not exactly,” Dean said coyly. He didn’t want to confuse Leo, but he also didn’t want to fall out of character before the game had even begun.
His eyes fly open.
Sam shrugs, still on his phone. “I dunno, something about this weekend’s concert.”
Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed, his face a hideous snarl. “How dare you leave me,” he screamed, itching closer to Castiel. “I gave you everything, Edward. I rebelled against the church, against Heaven,
Last week they had discussed this scenario in detail, one lazy morning in bed, sharing what they would find most alluring about meeting again as strangers. But now it was happening and Dean was panicked, tempted to run to him, to call the whole thing off. Instead of seeing Cas, his adorable and nerdy angel boyfriend of one year, this was Castiel. Cold, distant and sexy. Insanely attractive, even untouchable. Dean watched him saunter towards the bar, determinedly taking a seat several stools away.
“Don’t you think there’s a chance that Castiel Novak is a nice guy just like you?”
The first one is easy to kill. The four keep walking, still not noticing the distance they’re putting between themselves. Now that he knows the restraints aren’t keeping him in, he pushes his grace down to his wrists and melts the rope away.
But it would be a senseless kill, a way to scratch the nervous itch he feels about today, smothering the apprehension he feels about seeing Castiel again after so many years...
Dean nudged his head in the direction of his ass, up in the air and ready. “Clearly,” he retorted, and Castiel grinned and rolled his eyes, his weight leaving the bed as he searched through Dean’s duffel. Dean buried his head back into the comforter, musty and damp—they seriously should’ve stripped this thing off the bed before getting down to business, but Dean wasn’t interested in delaying this anymore than was strictly necessary—and waited for Cas to return. His footsteps must’ve been soft, though, because Dean felt him first: a pair of lips grazing his neck, traveling down his back, nipping the flesh of his backside, and then a tongue against...
“I’m sorry,” he said earnestly. “I got carried away, and didn’t mean to move too fast—”
Dean can already feel his heart ache, his stomach dropping like an anvil’s sunk to the bottom. He’s been wondering how long Castiel will stay now that the funeral is over, and once Cas consumes Chuck’s ashes tonight, it seems his lifelong friend is contemplating how much longer he might stay. But there is a very real possibility that demons are still after Cas, harboring some sort of decade-long grudge against the Novaks. Is Cas endangering them all by staying here? If he moved back to Lawrence, back to
“Castiel Krushnic. He was discovered in Russia but has been working in the States for a few years now.” Balthazar’s assistant stopped by, handing him a clipboard. “Anyways, darling, duty calls. Just wanted to give you the update.”
His desk was under a window, the autumn breeze sifting through the window screen and rustling the curtain. The walls were stacked high with bookshelves, more industrial and modern than the rest of their furniture, but eclectic and weird in the best way. The Cas way. The books were more disheveled than usual—what had Cas been reading today? Dean’s two favorite things were additions he could take credit for: the honey bee shadow box, featuring the first honeycomb they had collected from their hive, just months ago; and the second was the small leather futon, where Dean spent most of his afternoons reading when he grew tired of his own office, or had no farm work to keep him busy, or…you know, just missed Cas.
“We welcome you
“Never say no to a good cup’a coffee.” Dean gave him a lopsided grin, and some of the anxiety clawing its way around Castiel’s insides began to lose its potency. He could do this. They could do this.
Dean squints in confusion. “Uh, wanna run that logic by me again?”
“So it
“Ooh! Exciting!”
Castiel caught his eye and then tapped his temple. Dean squinted in confusion, then either seemed to understand or blindly trust Castiel’s intentions, moving his chair over to the side. Catching the invitation, Castiel picked up his own chair and placed it beside Dean’s. Like all other sounds in the otherwise quiet room, the shuffle of wood against concrete jolted them both. Castiel had become much more sensitive to noise lately, seeking silence out whenever he was alone and trying not to think too closely on why it comforted him.
As if reading his thoughts, Castiel mumbles, “It’s weird, right? Having them on the other side of this door?”
of that sentence. As uncomfortable as he feels, he feels the need to play Devil’s advocate. “I’m not entirely comfortable with it either, but it would be excellent representation for the LGBTQ community,” he comments evenly.
Dean hums in agreement, closing his eyes. “Your idea. Fuck, these jets are doing god’s work.”
The demon stands and chuckles, sliding his hands into the pockets of his trousers.
He flicks his wrist carelessly and Dean, Sam, and John are launched into the air. They’re separated now by several feet and leaned against headstones, the corner of one which caught Dean’s forehead and scratched him up bloody. But he barely registers the pain, because situated in front of the tomb doors are two blindfolded alphas on their knees, with two demons standing smugly behind them.
cuddling with Cas right now. Fuck. This is amazing and perfect and will probably end with Dean getting his goddamn heart broken. “All work and no play makes Cas a dull boy.”
Dean considered Castiel’s words. Strangely enough, he hadn’t been focusing on the fact that he had kissed
He breezes past Castiel without a second glance, resisting the urge to turn around, to see what the guy made of Dean’s exit.
The man whistled, expression impressed. “Hope you hold onto it, keep it in the family. It sounds very special.”
Castiel’s eyebrows knit together. “All-fours?” Dean’s cheek feel flush, and hopes to not-god that he won’t have to explain that innuendo to Cas. “Oh, you’re referring to a sex position.”
Sam squinted his eyes in curiosity. “Wait—who else...?”
He’s standing in the old Winchester house, the one that burned and collapsed during the Demon War, the site of his mother’s death. It strikes him as equally extraordinary and expected, being here again, amazed to see his childhood home returned to its former glory.
and intimate moments wrapped in bedsheets. They had the rest of their lives, in fact, for just that. But right now Castiel only wanted to watch Dean’s face as they entered their home-turned-party-venue, processing the scene in front of them.
“Red’s right—stay tuned. We might just turn this whole alpha ‘n omega thing right on its head.” Ash sounded and looked more a Lynyrd Skynyrd roadie than a scientist or whatever the hell he was, and Dean stifled a chuckle.
“Yeah, sometimes I forget.” Dean cupped Castiel’s jaw, thumb stroking his chin. “It just blows my fucking mind, you know? All
Castiel bites his lip, looking around the empty meadow nervously. There are about ten round tables situated on the grass, half of them strewn with wrinkled tablecloths, and two buffet style food lines and he just realizes he has
“Holy fuck, Cas,” Dean breathed, lifting the sheet and ruffling Castiel’s hair in the process. Castiel gazed up with a pop, eyelashes thick and fluttering, knowing he looked sinful and sensuous and feeling zero self-consciousness about that fact. His hand snaked beneath Dean’s sizable, glistening cock, fondling his balls and rolling them gently between the pads of his fingers. Dean audibly whined as Castiel wetted his lips, leaving damp and dragging kisses along Dean’s length. After a few teasing grazes he took Dean’s cockhead into his mouth again, hollowing out his cheeks, eyebrows raised and suggestive. Dean looked simultaneously adorable and debauched, the remnants of sleep still in his eyes with his mouth frozen and agape. Castiel thought suddenly,
“At the beginning,” Dean says, answering on instinct even though the question isn’t posed to him. “And be honest. You’re supposed to be leading them, not policing them.”
“Well,” Castiel said slowly, as if he had no actual answer, but was making it up as he went along. “There...could be...
Jesus.
“I love all of your music,” Castiel admits softly.
what Dean thought until Cas’ hand flew to his mouth, muffling his cries. Why in the fucking world
And yet, even though he was feeling a variety of emotions towards his author-turned-boyfriend-turned-whatever, he couldn’t deny that it still felt right just to be in Dean’s presence. Riding together in the car, his awareness of Dean’s body grew more and more as the minutes passed, heightened because he couldn’t reach over and touch Dean’s knee, or stretch over for a quick kiss. Every time Dean’s hand reached down to put on his turn signal, or fiddle with the travel mug of coffee Jess had packed him, Castiel felt his heart pound. It had been weeks since they had denied themselves physical contact, and Castiel wasn’t sure he was going to survive eight hours of the cold shoulder treatment. It was maddening.
“How do you know?” John rears back, heated once again. “You can’t save everyone, Dean.”
“I want to touch you,” Castiel rumbles, his hands slipping beneath the layers of shirts until Dean’s skin is smooth beneath his fingertips.
And then Dean is still, motionless.
. “Maybe,” Dean mumbled, his cheeks flushing.
poetry and novels when all I cared about were facts and figures?  A man who made me feel like a villain because I’m not like you, I’m not like
was a one-hundred-thousand word love letter to Dean.
Pamela and Ellen look at the alpha curiously, but evidently decide not to pry. Now that the ritual is over, the elders have relaxed considerably, lounging around the tent. Bobby pulls a flask from his back pocket and they pass it around without comment. Castiel nearly laughs at the sight—instead of a ceremonial pipe, these elders share cheap whiskey.
He won the second trial?
“Hold the fuck on.”
“Aren’t you Dean Winchester—the model?” one of the girls asked, raking her own eyes over him appreciatively.
a random Tuesday off? Castiel might be the best freaking thing to ever happen to him. But, he reminds himself, a very fleeting thing. He can’t get attached. He frowns a little at the thought, but he clears his mind before he can get too somber. He doesn’t know what’s on Castiel agenda for today, but surely he won’t mind being woken up in an extra special way?
Dean shuffles to his feet, feeling clumsy but determined, and Bobby nods—it’s time.
“I’m serious.” Sam’s face and tone of voice are equally solemn and Dean struggles to look away, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “
“I mean—imagine one of the trials is, I don’t know. Your father and I racing to the top of a volcano.” Cas thinks it’s the most outlandish example he can think of, but with a sharp sting of dread, realizes that it may not be far off. “How would that trial even be...powered? And who controls it?” He waves his hands, trying to find the best way to express himself. “In other words, who stops the lava from burning everyone up?”
