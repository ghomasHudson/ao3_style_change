[5:06PM] First of all, don’t go on websites for army wives. Secondly, I love you, and I wouldn’t throw away three years just for a quick shag. JW
Under normal circumstances, Sherlock might have fought back, but he could see that any aggression on his part would only make this man’s temper more dangerous, and with such a beefy opponent, Sherlock’s risk of injury only grew along with that dangerous temper. He had gotten good over the years of determining when to fight back physically and when to use alternative tactics. In this case, he would be sending the man’s wife a detailed set of instructions for getting as much out of her divorce as possible.
Sherlock barely refrained from rolling his eyes.  Really, with the man offering things like that, it was no wonder he and Molly hadn’t done much of anything yet.  “I’ll pass,” he said, walking away before Lestrade could make any more idiotic offers.  He glanced back over his shoulder to watch the two of them talk, both blushing lightly and smiling. It was ridiculous. He would have called it disgusting if he hadn’t been slightly jealous of what they had.
Sherlock ignored him and pulled out a pasta dish he’d apparently bought during his shopping excursion. He warmed it up per the instructions and was so focused on that task that he was startled into jumping when he felt a hand on his arm.
John hated that Sherlock’s personality was rather sweet in person as well, because it made it that much more difficult to get a grip on this big-and-growing-bigger crush. “Want another cup?” John asked, gesturing to the aggrieving mug. “I should probably get some for myself.” They were ostensibly meant to be having coffee, judging by Sherlock’s choice of meeting location.
It was a loud crack, like a tree falling. Except, well, trees normally fell during storms, and there wasn’t even the slightest hint of wind right then. He could hear howlers barking in the distance, likely upset at the disturbance to their mid-morning nap. There was something else beyond that, though, something that sounded almost…metallic. It couldn’t have been. There was no man-made structure out in the forest aside from the house he and the researchers stayed in.
He could tell that John was smiling. How was it that they seemed to know one another so well already? “Oh, I think we’ll have time for another round in the morning. I don’t have to leave until shortly before lunch.”
John shook his head. “I don’t understand. If you’re Sherlock’s sibling, why did you threaten them if they didn’t leave?”
There was a slight pause.  When Molly spoke again, her tone had changed drastically.  “He actually ditched you the morning after? That bastard.”
As promised, here's the next chapter.  This one and the one after it were originally one chapter, but the final word count on that clocked in at around 5k, so I just decided to split them up.  The next one will include the party, and the rating will definitely go up at that point.
He tried to ignore the way the simple contact between them instantly unfurled the tension in his chest.
[1:05AM] You’re seriously bringing that up? That was three years ago, Sherlock. Three fucking years. And I made it up to you after the fact. Also, I wasn’t ashamed, so don’t try to make me into some sort of bad guy over this. JW
John had been working at El Panadero Biological Research Station for nearly a year now, and there were some things that were just impossible to get used to. For example, the mantled howler monkeys that lived out in the adjacent forest that decided to start shouting at half past four every morning just outside his window.
John gaped at them for a moment longer before shaking his head. “You’re absolutely mad,” he said, but there was enough fondness in his tone that Sherlock didn’t get angry with him.
Sherlock leaned forward and pressed a tentative kiss to John’s lips, still not entirely sure that it would be welcome. While much of the initial awkwardness regarding the state of their relationship had dissipated, there had been no move on John’s part thus far to bring them to the full extent of what they had been before he’d left.
John met his gaze, and said, “Can you blame me for being eager? I mean—look at you. You’re perfect.”
John moved to stand beside the armchair he favoured, on which they had placed a large notepad. He tore off the top sheet, crumpling up Sherlock’s remarkably accurate one-third of a microscope. “Well, you don’t get points for drawing,” he replied amiably. “You get points for guessing. If you weren’t so rubbish at that bit of this, too, I’d accuse you of drawing poorly on purpose to sabotage me.”
“Do you ever sleep?” John asked when he found Sherlock sitting on the foot of his bed once again. It hadn’t happened since that first night that Sherlock had come back to the main house. Or, at least, John hadn’t noticed it happen since that first night.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, feeling more confident. He had a definite mission in mind, and he would not let his own uncertainty deter him from it. “I’m not stopping this,” he said, wiggling his arse a bit just to feel John’s hands tighten around him. “I’m getting—” He fumbled around in his drawer for a few moments before pulling out a small bottle, triumphant. “I was getting this.” He tossed the lube over at John and pulled himself back up on the bed properly. “We’ll be needing it.”
John didn’t appear to care that he had been overheard. “God, and the way you looked—damn. You’re amazing.”
Sherlock arrived precisely at eight o’clock. As he stepped out of the cab he’d evidently taken, John was struck again with just how beautiful he was. Those curls and
“—because the man was right-handed, and to get the injection mark at the angle, he would have needed to—“
Sherlock nodded, grinning slightly manically.  “I’ve got to get down to Scotland Yard.  Those idiots will never be able to put it all together unless I’m explaining it to them in person.”
Luckily, John continued on.  “I had to take biochem, and it killed me.  Maybe you can help me brush up on it sometime.”  He was perched on the edge of the table, leaning down, and Sherlock suddenly remembered his dream.  The image of them holding hands didn’t really seem out of place right then, and Sherlock felt his face grow flushed at the thought.
John reread those words a few times, trying to work it out. He supposed he could see how it would be easy to infer that he’d been trying to pull someone new based on how the conversation had started, but there was one thing he didn’t quite understand.
“I do sleep,” Sherlock said, scooting a little bit further onto the bed, as if John talking to them was somehow an invitation to stay longer.
John had tried holding his hand across the table at first, but Sherlock had needed to shuffle the file around before him, so John eventually let him have both of his hands free.  Instead, John’s legs were pressed up against his own under the table, a subtle, reassuring point of contact.
When Sarah realised that John wasn’t following her, she turned to him, brow furrowed. “Aren’t you coming?”
“Hey, you,” someone said, and Sherlock briefly wondered if he was hallucinating, because this was not just any
John smiled and soothingly stroked a hand through Sherlock’s hair, gently rubbing at the nubs of his antennae. “Sod Mycroft,” he said. “We don’t have to see him, and if he tries to bother us, we’ll tell him to get lost.”
“Sherlock,” John said, a bit forcefully.  He squeezed Sherlock’s hand.  His expression relaxed into something soft when Sherlock finally glanced up away from their joined hands.  “There you are. You were starting to freak me out a bit.”  He chuckled. “You’ve just been blinking like that for two whole minutes now.”
John groaned, his playfulness evaporating as a look of pure lust settled on his face. “God,” he said, dropping his head down onto Sherlock’s hip as if he couldn’t bear to keep it upright anymore. “Now
John recalled that first day they’d met and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Speaking of genitalia…”
“Do you want to come back to my flat?” he asked, and though his face betrayed no shyness, his hands were fidgeting nervously.
Sherlock took an embarrassingly long moment to process John’s words. “Our first kiss?” he repeated, a bit breathless.
John laughed again and dropped Sherlock’s hand in favour of scooping him into his (incredibly strong, devastatingly sexy) arms. Sherlock yelped, startled out of his momentary panic at being called perfect by arguably the most perfect man in the world, and barely had time to protest before he was tossed onto the bed, John almost immediately settling on top of him.
,” Sherlock cried, and though profanity wasn’t usually in his vocabulary, there was no other word he could use here. He was breathing heavily, every breath coming out as an urgent, “Yes.”
Victor never invited him over again.  Wouldn’t even look at him, really.  Pretended they had never known each other.
“Oh, don’t be like that,” Seb called after him. “Come on, you’ve got to at least do your little trick for me.”
Sherlock was smiling wider than John had ever seen them do in the past. “You could tell that she considered throwing that bag of peaches you’d just bought on the ground.”
John was admittedly nervous. He hadn’t been like this before any of the other dates he’d gone on recently, but Sherlock was different. Granted, this wasn’t so much a proper date as a very large dinner shared between several couples. Still, he had made his intentions clear, and now Sherlock knew that he wanted this, and, God, he was really very nervous.
He smiled cheerily as he sat back down and passed one glass over to his companion. “You look like a man who enjoys whiskey,” he said.
“Yeah, I imagine they usually react the way those idiots did last Friday. They asked for it, though. I mean, they shouldn’t have goaded you into doing it if they had something they wanted to hide.” John actually looked genuinely frustrated on his behalf about the way Wilkes’ friends had reacted. Sherlock didn’t know what to do with that.
Their conversation from that point on flowed easily and freely, and it seemed they had reached a sort of equilibrium. Sherlock was just so easy to talk to. Their personalities seemed to be entirely complementary, which was not something he’d ever felt with anyone before. Granted, that was mostly because he had a bit of a temper and a general disinterest for most people, but it seemed like Sherlock had similar issues, being quick to close off himself and equally disinterested in others. Except for John, apparently. Sherlock listened with rapt attention while John spoke, sometimes finishing his thought for him by deducing the ends of his sentences. It was probably the most clichéd, romantic thing he’d ever experienced.
John didn’t seem to be fooled. There was a slight smirk on his lips as he went back to work. “Are you going to continue to ice that bruise?”
He used a moderate amount of force. There’s a little bit of bruising, and aside from difficulty talking immediately after the incident, I’ve seen no changes in my ability to speak, breathe, or swallow.
Sherlock woke the next morning with an impending sense of dread. It seemed a fitting enough way to wake after getting drunk for the first time.  He hoped for half a moment that perhaps his drunkenness might have wiped away the memory of the previous night, but he remembered it all. He wasn’t sure whether or not to be pleased about that.  A blackout episode might have offered him some sort of escape from the consequences that undoubtedly awaited him.  But, no, he remembered everything: getting drunk, kissing John, doing…other things with John as well.  He groaned, squeezing his eyes shut as if he could force himself back into unconsciousness.
Sherlock shrugged nonchalantly and picked apart the food in front of him. His stomach felt far too fluttery for him to even think about eating anything just yet.  “If you wanted to go, I thought I might tag along. It was interesting last time we went.”
Sherlock grinned down at the oven where their dessert was being prepared. “I have to admit, I’d be much less pleased with the outcome of the day if I’d been deprived of cobbler at the end of it.” Sherlock hesitated, then frowned. “Actually, I don’t really know what a cobbler takes like, but I’m assuming it’s good.”
John sighed and wrapped one arm around Sherlock, trying to offer comfort for something he didn’t fully understand. “Am I still missing something?” he asked softly. Then, knowing that maybe Sherlock needed the extra push, he added, “Boyfriends should know these things about one another.”
His thought process ground to a halt when Sherlock surged forward and kissed him—just once, just a hard peck, but it was enough to bring him back to the present.
Sherlock finally glanced up. “Hmm? Oh, my people typically live to be around eighty-five years old. And before you ask, yes, our years are similar to Earth years.” John hadn’t been about to ask that, but he supposed he should take it as a compliment that Sherlock thought he was clever enough to actually think about the similarity in their calendar years. “Our planets have similar rotations around their…” They waved their hand through the air, as if unable to locate the proper word, and finished lamely with, “Their whatever-they-are.”
Sherlock stared up at the ceiling. One of his arms dangled over the edge of the sofa, and one was placed carelessly over his head.
Sherlock continued smiling down at his mobile for a full minute before he remembered that he was meant to be using that time to be getting ready. He pocketed the device and turned his attention back to his appearance.
John offered an apologetic smile and moved to perch on the edge of the bed. He was still several inches away from Sherlock, just in case they didn’t want him to get too close. “I think you’d like London,” he said. “That is, if you’re not really leaving to go back to your planet.”
Sherlock refused to look at her and shut his eyes, trying his best to look like the corpse he would soon become. “I’m dying,” he said again. It had been days since anyone had even been up to check on him, and he had been in an even worse state without an audience nearby. Now, at least, he had Mrs. Hudson to fuss over him, and that was better than being abandoned up in 221B, left on his own to wither way into nothing.
Hearing John’s voice like that, low and dark and unbearably sexy, caused a new wave of arousal to sweep through Sherlock’s body. He moved more quickly against John, chasing that pleasure he’d gone without since they had last been together.
Sherlock thought that last part might have been intended as a joke, but he hadn’t exactly been in the mood to laugh since John first left. He thought John might have been upset with him for that, but they were still holding hands, so he counted it as a success.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said sardonically. “How did you know that I prefer my coffee with seven creams and twelve sugars?”
Thanks for reading!  Sorry again that this took so long to upload.  The next chapter is going to be a lot shorter, so that one shouldn't take me nearly as long to get finished, and then I'll add a little epilogue to this!
John glanced up from the carrots he’d been chopping to find Sherlock holding up a ballpoint pen. He furrowed his brow.
Sherlock laughed as well and held tightly to John’s hand, thinking that this was the happiest he had ever been.
[1:19AM] I’m not the idiot you seem to think I am, Sherlock. I’m not going to run into the path of a bullet. JW
Sherlock frowned.  He hadn’t known that there was a game scheduled for that evening.  That would certainly explain why John had left early. Perhaps he hadn’t scared the man off, after all.
Sherlock hesitantly sniffed at his own drink, nearly recoiling as the smell assaulted him.  Not wanting John to think him weak, though, Sherlock took a healthy sip of the rum.  He forced himself to swallow the mouthful, despite its awful taste.
He nearly threw his phone across the table in his haste to grab it when he heard the telltale alert coming from it.
Sherlock remembered the first time he had brought John back to his Baker Street flat. He’d been living alone back then, and as he remembered, Mrs. Hudson had almost immediately humiliated him by telling John—the very man Sherlock was intent on being with—that Sherlock had been ‘love-struck.’ It was perhaps the most embarrassed he had ever been, but John—perfect, patient, noble, stupid John—hadn’t made him feel bad about it. On the contrary, John had kissed him softly, had led him upstairs, and had taken him to bed.
Sherlock, in spite of his resolve not to care too much about John’s opinion of him, felt rather terrible reading through those emails. He leapt from his cab when he arrived at Heathrow and made his way toward the appropriate meeting point.
That depends entirely on whether or not you’re as good as you were last time. You might have gotten rusty in the last few months.
Here's the next chapter!  I've decided I'm going to do a short little one after this of them texting just to sort of further develop their relationship!  This has basically been all fluff and very little plot but in chapters 5-8 there'll be some plot!  I'm just a sucker for fluff I guess :)
“Hi,” John said by way of greeting, his eyes scanning Sherlock’s form. “Wow, you look great. Really, just—wow.”
[3:37AM] I was shot in the left shoulder. I somehow ended up with a bit of a limp, too, which is ridiculous. JW
“Never have I ever grown a beard.” John took a sip at that one, now having seven fingers up, and Sherlock started to imagine just how good John would look with a full beard instead of just that ridiculous mustache.
The door opened, and he didn’t need to look up to know who it was. Those footsteps would have been familiar to him under any circumstances.
Sherlock frowned at him. As attractive as John looked right then, he made no sense. “John, there is no other way for me to provide you with the necessary payment for your services aside from giving you money.”
John raised his eyebrows at the message. For some reason, he couldn’t help but read it as being slightly stilted and awkward, especially given the pause that had just occurred. It wasn’t an easy, effortless sort of flirting, apparently, and John found he liked it this way a bit better. Now he knew that SH had taken the time to mull over an appropriate response, and he couldn’t help but smiling like a lovesick fool down at his phone.
At first John thought that Sherlock might have been rattled by the man on the phone. Of course, Sherlock didn’t have nearly enough emotional range to experience something like that, so it seemed unlikely that they would be worried. Besides, they had seemed remarkably unconcerned when hearing about it. The only part that had surprised them was the man’s insistence that they return to their home planet. Still, John doubted that Sherlock would be the sort to simply pack up and leave at vague threats from some creep.
John hesitated for only a moment before responding, revealing even more information about himself in what was probably an unwise manner. At least it was keeping him occupied, he reasoned.
“Gorgeous,” John breathed, and in spite of the fact that he repeated such compliments every time they had sex, Sherlock still found himself flushing at how genuine it sounded.
, in ways that were not wholly platonic, and he was still so in awe of it that he couldn’t allow himself to think about it for too long, lest he risk his mental capabilities for the next several minutes.
“Your pasta—” Sherlock started, but John interrupted him, saying, “Sod the pasta. I’m not hungry anyway.”
Sherlock spread his fingers apart just enough so that John could see the glare that was being directed at him.
John sighed and came to stand behind him, placing one hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Donovan was trying to get a rise out of you,” he said. “I’m sorry she’s being so horrid. We can leave, if you want.”
Sally was so shocked at the sight of Sherlock with another living being that it took her until they’d gotten inside the building to yell, “You can’t just bring
Now, Sherlock was putting in order the flat that had once belonged to both of them, that still technically belonged to both of them but had been inhabited by only one for so long.
“For the past twelve hours,” they replied. “It didn’t take me long after hearing you speak, and I read all the books in your library. I’m fairly certain I have a good command of your language now.”
“You were going to be a soldier,” he blurted out, because his mind, in its current addled state, was only capable of repeating back the last deductions it had made.
Sorry it's taken me an age to update this!  I've been super busy again, and I sort of haven't been able to organically write the next scene I had planned out for this fic, so I'm kinda stuck!  I was going to add a bit of angst here, but re-reading the stuff I've written so far, the angst I had planned doesn't really fit!  Oh well, I'll figure something else out.
“I don’t know what to do here,” Sherlock admitted, pulling back slightly. Their lips were wet and glistening, and they looked far sexier than they had any right to.
Sherlock moaned and tried to grind against John’s to get that feeling once more. John’s hands tightened on him in order to keep him upright as he undulated his hips. “Too big to be a wrench,” he said, caught between shock and lust. John must have been incredibly large, and while Sherlock had previously noted the distinctive way John walked, he hadn’t quite put together the implications of that particular stride on penis size.
“Rough,” John said. He made his way to the armchair that he had claimed back at the start and collapsed down into it with a grimace. “Believe it or not, being shot in the shoulder makes it even
“You shouldn’t have come here in the first place,” someone said. The voice was coming from inside Sherlock’s room. Adrenaline pounded through John’s veins. No one else was meant to be at El Panadero. He’d stopped in his tracks on his way up the stairs upon hearing that voice, old instincts kicking in.
John stared at it. “What’s this, then?” he said, and his voice had lost any of the friendliness that had returned to it earlier.
Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he could see Molly smirking at him, like she had just figured it all out, but he was far too distracted to pay much attention to that at the moment.
That was a good sign, at least.  John clearly wasn’t upset with him for his assumption.  Still, as they walked out into the crisp evening air, Sherlock couldn’t help but feel disappointed that he had misjudged the situation so badly. John ushered him into a cab, laughing about how “after two drinks you’re already sloshed,” and Sherlock was so delighted to hear John laugh that he allowed himself to be teased.
[1:12AM] You weren’t my long-term partner at the time. We’d only just started dating when I joined up. JW
John grimaced. “Yeah. I didn’t know they’d be here, or I would have chosen another spot for us to meet.”
Sherlock didn’t react obviously, but his posture seemed to relax a bit, and John could tell he was smiling behind his hands.
Hesitantly, Sherlock cracked an eye open, confirming what he had already suspected. He was still on the sofa, as he had been the night before, but John was nowhere to be found.  His chest felt painfully tight.  Ah, he thought, so that was how this was going to be. Sherlock hadn’t imagined that John would be the type to flee the morning after, but he couldn’t say he blamed the man. For John, it had likely been nothing more than a drunken mistake.  Sherlock merely hoped that he hadn’t ruined everything between them.
John laughed at that. “I’m afraid tea is off the table until I get this thing fixed.” To accentuate his point, he held up the insides of the kettle.
John’s hand was on his cheek again, and there was a look in John’s eyes that made Sherlock’s heart clench into itself. How long had it been since he’d seen that expression? How long had it been since he’d remembered that he was loved? “I missed you so much,” he murmured. The tenderness in John’s voice made Sherlock want to cry again. “I think when I was over there I forgot how hard this was on you.” He sighed. “It was easy to get angry.”
“In love with me, hm?” John said, and he was clearly aiming for a joking tone, but there was an undercurrent of concern that made the statement fall flat.
“So if we can rule out which places he’s already gone to, we can figure out which bars might be potential targets for him in the area,” Lestrade offered.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and tried to ignore the way John’s laugh made him feel. “If you didn’t write it, then by the process of elimination, it must have been one of the ones I wrote down. We’re the only two people playing.” He gestured around the empty flat as if demonstrating for John that there was, in fact, no one else around. John had told him that Pictionary was usually played with more than two people, and Sherlock had asked him if he knew of anyone he wanted to invite over to play, and John had agreed that, no, they really didn’t need anyone else taking up their time together, so they had settled into this rather poor imitation of the game. Six days into John’s leave, they were running out of ideas on how to entertain one another, clearly, but Sherlock at least took heart in the fact that John hadn’t yet grown bored of his presence.
He recalled how John had talked to him on Friday and then again the day before. John had called him hot and had been impressed by his deductions.  All of that, right down to the way John had said goodbye after the rugby match, seemed blatantly flirtatious.  Sherlock knew that considering it as such was a dangerous thing to do, but he was fairly certain he hadn’t misinterpreted their interaction. Besides, John hadn’t denied Sherlock’s deduction about his sexual orientation, meaning that he likely was indeed interested in men as well as women.  Just this once, Sherlock allowed himself to embrace the hope that had been plaguing him all morning.
Sherlock had indeed managed to find them an absolutely ideal flat in central London. Their new landlady, Mrs. Hudson, exuded the sort of kind, motherly energy that made it impossible not to adore her.
Sherlock nodded, recalling how Scotland Yard had dismissed his information. At least Lestrade knew that he had been right. “All the murders committed using a different method, all in the victims’ homes,” he murmured, eyes scanning the information contained in the file.
John had tried texting Sherlock the day after their failed date, but as expected, there had been no response. He wasn’t known for quitting, though, so he hadn’t let that get him down. Instead, he’d sent another text, and then another, and then another, but all of his texts over those next few days went unanswered.
John was silent for a long moment, and Sherlock wanted so desperately to look over at him, but he couldn’t blow their cover.
Sherlock’s face flushed, and he hid it against John’s shoulder. “I hate you,” he grumbled. “You’re a terrible boyfriend, teasing me like that.”
Sherlock studied the victim and stalked around the body in what he hoped was a sufficiently dramatic fashion. His coat flared out behind him, so that ought to make him look fairly mysterious in John’s eyes. “These aren’t random attacks,” he noted. “The killer seems to know the perfect time to break in. He calls them from a withheld number—taunts them. A true sadist.” Donovan muttered something under her breath, and although Sherlock faltered a moment, knowing what her comment had likely been, he almost immediately continued his spoken train of thought. “He develops a different method to end each victim. Strangulation with the first, bondage and suffocation with the second, stabbing, and now poisoning.” Sherlock knelt down by the body and picked up a limp hand. After a moment, he jumped back to his feet. “They’re meeting him at a bar.”
NOTE: This chapter is not going to look good on mobile!  For mobile users, please scroll to the bottom and see the end of chapter notes for a non-formatted transcript. This chapter is written in the way that a text conversation would appear on an iPhone, so the sender (Sherlock)'s texts appear on the right where the receiver (Lestrade)'s texts appear on the left.
Sherlock frowned.  “You’ve got an exam to study for.  You’ve been moaning about it for weeks.  You need to study.”
John shuffled forward a bit. “We wouldn’t be able to go for a few months,” he continued. “The researchers don’t get here for a little while longer, but after they leave and give me my paycheck, I’ll have enough money to afford two tickets to London.”
Sherlock shook his head. “He hasn’t. Confirm with the victims’ credit card charges in the days prior to their deaths, but he seems to only strike once per location.”
Their drinks were set in front of them, and still no one had approached either of them. It hardly took a detective to figure out why that was.
Sherlock thought for a moment. He pulled the cold compress away from his face and dropped it onto the sofa. It was making his hand far too cold. “I could use a doctor in my line of work.”
John shook his head, but he was grinning. “I’ll take you to a seedy bar, just the two of us, and we’ll shag in the toilets, but I’m not exactly in the mood knowing that Donovan is only a few meters away out there.”
The man stomped off, his footfalls heavy with anger, leaving Sherlock alone in his sitting room on his collapsed coffee table. The air had been knocked from his lungs, so he allowed himself a moment to just breathe while the wood pressed uncomfortably into his back. He was glad that Mrs. Hudson wasn’t home, or she would have been fussing like mad.
John grinned at him. “How can I refuse an offer like that?” he said, and he slid into the back of the cab after Sherlock.
Sherlock hesitated for a moment before nodding. John kept his hand on Sherlock’s elbow for the entire walk back.
“Sci-fi. You know, science fiction.” Sherlock continued to stare blankly at John. “Science fiction is all aliens and robots that become sentient and weird impossible things happening,” he explained.
With every round, Sherlock and John used their turns to expose another part of their relationship to their companions, saying things that clearly only applied to one another.
Sherlock’s cheeks heated a bit, and he shot John an affronted look, knowing that that statement had been targeted directly at him. A few people took drinks, and everyone stared as Sherlock did the same. “Never have I ever been in love with Sherlock Holmes,” he shot back, still staring at John.
Taking care to keep his tread light, John slowly crept down the trail, one hand on his gun. He scanned the area the same way the primatologists did when they were looking for monkeys, though he kept his gaze lower to catch his more terrestrial target. He walked that whole trail in the same, slow fashion, and yet he still managed to reach the river’s edge without finding anything. He wondered if perhaps whoever had been there had gotten spooked and jumped in the river, but they’d have never been able to handle the currents. There was no other possible explanation, John thought, and he was oddly disappointed that his opponent had made such a stupid decision as to try to survive the river.
“See?” Sherlock said, breaking John from his fascination with their form. “I’ve got all the same parts as you.”
John broke the kiss, tearing an involuntary whine from Sherlock, and murmured, “God, the things you do to me.” He kissed and bit his way down Sherlock’s neck, all the while grinding their hips together, and,
There was another pause, this one slightly longer than the rest, and John half-wished he could go back in time and prevent himself from ever being so open. Where had that ever gotten him before, honestly? But, he couldn’t stand the thought of Sherlock not knowing precisely how serious he was about this. Those five minutes of waiting were pure agony, but in the end, it was worth it—well, maybe worth it; however good John had gotten at this, Sherlock was still difficult to read sometimes.
Sherlock tried to glare at him, but he found that he was having a rather difficult time making the look as biting as it normally was. “Why don’t I put my mouth near your erection and see how eager you get?” he returned, proud of himself for getting all of the words out coherently.
John’s hands rested on his shoulders, and his thumbs began to stroke softly back and forth. Sherlock was mesmerised by the feel of it.
The two of them pushed their way up to the bar. Crowded as the place was, they still managed to remain beside one another.
and the occasional whine. Their skin had gone back to its natural colours, and John had only just begun.
He forced himself to get it together. To distract himself from the image, he pulled out his bottle of Cabernet and two glasses, giving them each a healthy portion. He passed John his wine and sat down beside him on the sofa, careful to keep himself at a respectable distance. He drank half his glass in one go as John watched him with amusement.
At that, Sherlock had stopped arguing, and he’d ducked his head away to hide a smile. John counted that as another success on his part for the night.
John looked up at him and must have seen the concern on Sherlock’s face. He reached up to rub at Sherlock’s shoulder. “I don’t need your money, gorgeous,” he said softly. He stayed there for a moment, just running his hand down Sherlock’s back, before he stepped around him. “Until next time,” he said as he passed, and then he was going down the stairs out of the flat.
Molly thankfully let the issue drop.  “Whatever you say, Sherlock Holmes,” she murmured, which meant that she didn’t believe his lie, either.
His phone buzzed, telling him that he had a new text from Molly. Sherlock read it immediately, grateful for the distraction from his own bitter thoughts.
John smacked him in the arm but kept smiling, even as he took a sip and held another one of his fingers up.
. Sherlock’s fingers itched to reach out and pull John into a kiss, and he decided that he really needed to do that as soon as possible, lack of brushed teeth be damned. And then, before his brain had really agreed, in a surge of impulsivity in keeping with his character, he took two steps forward until his toes touched the corner of the shower, and when John looked over at him inquisitively, Sherlock took his face in his hands and kissed him square on the mouth. It was chaste and brief and sent Sherlock’s heart panicking almost immediately.
He flushed at the thought of being entirely naked in front of a fully clothed man. He didn’t think he had ever been that physically exposed to anyone before.
It startled Sherlock just how much he hadn’t been deducing during his post-roofie stupor. He pushed himself up so that he was propped against his headboard. John had only changed once in the last three days. His clothes, though relatively new, bore distinctive signs of the sofa, where John must have slept during his observation of Sherlock. He looked tired, and there were faint worry lines that hadn’t yet smoothed out in between his eyebrows.
So, going shopping with Sherlock was very much like going shopping alone at first. John went about picking up his standard, monthly ration of rice and beans, (though this time he took care to also buy ingredients for a cobbler,) while Sherlock flipped through a soap opera guide (and they were lucky that about half of the magazines were in English and were therefore legible to them).
was that one person?  No, it couldn’t be. Or, it could be, but he couldn’t jump to that conclusion without proper evidence.  God, it was getting difficult to think.  His thoughts felt too fleeting.
John walked forward until they were standing nearly toe-to-toe. “You are a genius,” he told Sherlock, lifting one hand to cup his cheek.
Sherlock’s awed expression made John’s heart kick in his chest. “You’ve got too many to count,” they reiterated, obviously fascinated.
He obligingly kissed them again, this time parting his lips and licking gently against Sherlock’s. John was rewarded with a little
when a girl came up and tapped John on the shoulder. She had light brown hair and a relatively pretty face, and she was obviously
Sherlock had perched himself on the little bit of counter space beside the sink to ensure that he had a good view of John working.
“Your turn,” John said, forcing Sherlock’s eyes to flick back up to his face. John looked both cocky and amused, and on anyone else it would have been an infuriating expression, but John had certainly earned the right to wear it. “Let me see you.”
of another species’ biological imperative, but, Christ, did he hate the idea of Sherlock being with anyone else.
, he thought as they made their way out into the street and into a cab. He had never been courted before, and it was rather reassuring to know that John thought he was worth the effort. Realistically, John could have merely dragged Sherlock into his bedroom without any protest from the detective, but the attempts at chivalry suggested that perhaps John’s interest in him extended beyond the purely physical.
John cursed under his breath. He shook his head and broke out into a smile. “You’re going to be the death of me,” he said.
Sherlock got to his feet and started back up the stairs. His hands started to fidget anxiously again. “I can clean this up,” he assured John once they entered 221B. He went over to the coffee table and stacked two books on top of one another.
John nodded. “It doesn’t. Or, at least, it’s not supposed to. Now you see my concern. Somehow someone got the phone working again, and figured out all about me and my therapist back in London and that you’re living here.” He paused trying to impress upon Sherlock how serious this situation was. “He said he knew
The harsh whistle of the kettle startled him out of his thoughts. Before John could even step back into the kitchen to pull it off the stove, the alien came running in from wherever they had gone.
John was openly flirting, and he wondered if SH would even pick up on it. The several-minute-long pause that followed his message seemed to indicate that he had picked up on it. John was a bit worried that he’d gone too far, but he didn’t let himself dwell on that too much. He could handle a rejection if it came.
John looked like he was fighting a grimace.  “I guess I’d better get back to it.”  He gestured with his free hand to the counter.
Sherlock, John, Lestrade, and two others in their group took sips of their drinks and held a finger up.
“Good,” Sherlock said at first, but he reconsidered.  “Well, it was good at the time, but now I fear there may be consequences.”
Sherlock spent a ridiculous amount of time getting ready, according to Mrs. Hudson, who had come up to check on him early in the afternoon. Sherlock had already been mentally cycling through outfits for hours by that point, and he happened to think that his dedication to his appearance was perfectly reasonable given that he was going to have to make himself appealing to a murderer. It was for the case, after all.
He bent over and took one nipple into his mouth, sucking and biting gently. He pinched the other one between his thumb and forefinger. Sherlock’s whole body seemed to jolt at that, and they let out a strangled cry. John was initially worried that he’d done something wrong, but then Sherlock brought a hand up to hold his head in place. John smirked. So Sherlock was going to be loud in bed. Well, that was all fine. After a few moments of relentless teasing, John switched his lips to the other nipple, and he received the same reaction as he’d gotten with the first. It was intoxicating.
“Is that what you came here to do?” John wondered if Sherlock intended to keep up his imitation of human skin tone for the rest of their life.
Sherlock knew he had brought this on himself. A few days prior, Donovan had come to him for help—a rare thing for her to do—and he had been so preoccupied with John that he had (perhaps rudely) refused to look at the case she was offering. It seemed that Donovan, when upset, reacted much in the same way that a wild animal might, by lashing out at the thing that had caused her pain. In this case, that thing was Sherlock, and he had a feeling that it was only going to get worse.
“Go on,” Murray said. “Give us a demonstration.” His eyes lit up. “I’ve got it. See if you can tell who shagged last night.”
John raised his eyebrows and tried to figure out any other way that Sherlock could have known all of that information about him. He came up empty. “Christ, you’re amazing,” he breathed.
Sherlock didn’t figure it out for another three days. There had been seemingly no connections between the victims or the locations in which they had been held and set ablaze. It took hours of digging through property records and class lists before Sherlock discovered the common factor. Anthony Blaine. He’d gone to primary school with the first victim and secondary school with the second and third. His family had also been previous owners of the three flats that had been targeted thus far. There was only one flat left before their current residence, and Sherlock wasted no time in getting there. If the pattern held as expected, then Blaine would attempt to kill again before the day was out.
, John would say, and Sherlock would respond with a nod and a blank expression, and all would be well.
“Mycroft lives in London,” Sherlock noted, looking down at their prospective itinerary. “He’s an annoying git, and I don’t want him in my business.”
Unbidden, the thought that John was about to ask him out crossed his mind. He felt hope flare within him, bright and hot and unexpected.
This time it was Sherlock who broke the kiss entirely. “Come on,” he said, and he took John’s hand and led him down the hall toward what must have been Sherlock’s bedroom. In contrast to the remainder of the flat, it was very tidy. There was no clutter on the floor or the furniture, unlike the sitting room. John caught sight of a framed picture of the periodic table, and he couldn’t help but smile. Why was he growing fonder at every new revelation about Sherlock? It was ridiculous. Not that he was going to try backing away to stop it. No, he would let it happen, and he hoped that it wouldn’t end up biting him in the arse.
John really does smile at this. He reaches out and tames a curly strand hanging dangerously close to Sherlock’s eye, smoothing the hair back into place. “I don’t know. Maybe you can get your own freezer. Not use the kitchen one.”
John’s intake of breath is almost inaudible. It takes him a minute to say anything, the time stretching slow and sticky.
“Right,” John says. Then, more hurriedly. “Right. Ms. Hudson.” John pulls his forehead away from Sherlock’s back, their skin sticking together briefly, and then rises from the couch. He strides into the kitchen and the whistling ceases.
“While you were away.” John inhales sharply. “Jesus, Sherlock, when you got back I- I punched you. I pushed you down. Were these still healing then?” John shakes his head. “No. That doesn’t even matter. I can’t believe I-” John pulls his hand away reflexively, as if Sherlock’s skin has burned him.
“Please. Don’t do that. What are we doing?” A bubble of adrenaline threatens to burst in Sherlock’s stomach. In his fantasies it is always John who sweeps him off of his feet, who crashes through the careful distance they maintain, who presses Sherlock against the nearest flat surface in a post case rush. And yet every time they seem to be hurtling towards something one of them slams the eject button.
Sherlock discovers a sensitive spot on John’s neck, just over his pulse point. Each time Sherlock runs his tongue over it John’s breathing falters and he arches his neck a bit more.
“Yes. It’s fine.” Sherlock says. His chin falls to his chest and he closes his eyes, blocking out the drifting streetside view.
“I usually am.” Sherlock stumbles backwards towards the chair, pulling at John’s arm. He wants John to sit down first, wants to slide into his lap like he had imagined.
“Kettle’s on,” John says, and sits down next to Sherlock, wrapping his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders in an easy movement. He begins to squeeze Sherlock’s arm and then hesitates. “Is this alright?”
Sherlock starts to interject, but John cuts him off. “I know you had to do it Sherlock. This isn’t about that.” John rubs Sherlocks arm through the heavy blanket, and Sherlock goes quiet, watching the soft light wash across John’s face.
Through the open window the sounds of London at night crested into a symphony familiar enough to situate Sherlock in time and space, giving him something to wrap his mind around and move forward with.
“Sherlock,” John breathes out. He presses his free hand to Sherlock’s hip, calloused fingers bracketing Sherlock’s body. His thumb drags over Sherlock’s bare stomach, up across his chest, and catches against the mottled mountain of Sherlock’s gunshot scar. “God-” John forces out, and then he is kissing Sherlock in earnest, and this is more like what Sherlock had imagined, this is frantic and fast and everything all at once. John wraps his hand around the back of Sherlock’s burning neck, pulling him down urgently. A high pitched whine slithers up from Sherlock’s chest, and he pushes back against John, sandwiching him against the counter.
John stares at him. His hand stills, resting solidly in Sherlock’s tangle of curls. “Lemon,” he says. “Your hair used to smell like lemon.” John’s eyes flicker down to Sherlock’s lips. “Whatever you want,” he says as an afterthought, the words jumbling out of his mouth. Sherlock can tell by the slight indentation of skin that John is biting his cheek.
Sherlock turns away from the toilet to face him. The nausea has passed, and John’s wide olive eyes are staring at him, full of some emotion that Sherlock can’t parse. John lifts the washcloth to Sherlock’s face and wipes the dried blood from his chin and lips.
Sherlock is alarmed to find tears springing to his cheeks. He is not sure if he can force his voice out in a normal cadence.
Even in the state that Sherlock is in, he can recognize an edge of horror in John’s eyes, and realizes what the sight of his mouth and chin covered in blood must stir in John’s memory.
Sherlock wakes choking on coppery breath. For a moment, he can’t remember where he is, images of the prison cell in Serbia flashing through his mind, the smell of his own blood making bile rise sharply in his throat.
Sherlock twists the faucet of the sink and cold water washes over his quivering hands. He cups his palms and splashes the water onto his face. He notes that he cannot stop shaking. Usually, when he is struck by one of these, he is able to calm himself down by keeping detailed track of what his body is doing, is able to separate mind from body, take on a disaffected view of what he is going through until it passes. This time, he is drifting beyond coherent thought. Bitterly, he spits more blood into the sink. If he can’t even deduce himself what is he good for? His vision fades away for a moment, and he stumbles, back hitting the wall. He slides down in a controlled motion, hitting the ground slow.
“Let go, Sherlock,” John says. “You’re right there, let go.” With his free hand, John cradles Sherlock’s jaw, tilts his head up so that all Sherlock can see is John’s face. “God, you’re perfect. Look at you. Just look at you. I love you so much.”
Sherlock is hovering. John once told him that hovering is rude. That it is off putting. Bloody creepy. Those are the words John had used. And now Sherlock is hovering behind John in the kitchen at three AM, so close that he could press flush against him just by leaning forward.
The wind picks up outside, tunneling through the alleyway underneath the kitchen window. In the street below a trash bin falls over with a metallic echoing crash.
The tap sputtered and the bathroom sink rattled as water reintroduced itself to the pipes. Sherlock braced himself against the counter. His reflection stared back at him from the mirror, hair flattened to one side, a crust of dried blood fringing his right nostril - all his earlier primping evaporated into a disheveled shadow of what he thought tonight would be. He ran his hand across his freshly shaven jaw and pressed two fingers to the swelling around his eye where John had hit him. A bruise bloomed rose fresh under his skin. He pushed down hard where it felt most tender. His eyes fluttered shut as the ghost of John’s touch throbbed through his orbital bone.
A few moments passed and the boy smiled, deeming his scientific endeavor a successful one. He turned to grab his notebook when he heard it, the slight crack of breaking glass. He barley had time to react before the beaker exploded on his desk, spewing glass and chemicals all over the floor. Sherlock sat on his floor, having being put of balance, eyes wide with shock and terror.
“And in that week you knew my life story with a single glance, and have been the only person I’ve talked to in that class. Of course I consider you my friend.”
“Sherlock,” John speaks softly. “I’ve seen them. I won’t think differently of you. Please, show me.”
And I hope in due time to answer them all.” He shifted his gaze from Johns eyes, and continued. “You seem to be a reasonably smart man and have put two and two together. All I want to say, John, is that my Father is a cruel and spiteful person, and I hope you are never unlucky enough to cross paths with him.”
“Fuck. Hey come on, let’s get you back up.” John mumbles more to himself to then to Sherlock as he kneels down next to Sherlock lifting his shoulders gently.
After class John discovers that he and Sherlock are locker buddies. He also discovers more about Sherlock.
“Oi! Sherlock? Mate you okay!? Been over an hour, foods getting cold? I’m coming in, sorry, but I’m fearing the worst here.” he entered the bathroom timidly and froze in his tracks.
‘James Bond is an exceptionally predictable man.’ I thought as the movie played on the television in Johns quaint living room. I sat crossed legged on the couch with a plate of chocolate cookies John just so happened to be bringing out with every trip to the kitchen. Sherlock took a glance at John to see that the man was fully engrossed in the film, seeming to know every word to every line in the script.
Thirty minutes came and went and John answered the knock of the door, gathering the food and setting out plates around the styrofoam boxes. His mouth watered as he got a whiff of the egg rolls.
‘At least he’s eating.’ he thought as he threw a soy packet at Sherlock, and took a bite of his own roll.
“Sherl, will you open your eyes for me, there’s a good lad. Come on now, off your hands-oh there you go, gently!” He cooed towards his brother, his hand a steady anchor on the younger ones back.
"Going to introduce your self? You're not exactly sly. You've been looking at me since you sat down."
“Oh Sherlock, no.” Mycroft cried, collecting his trembling frame into his arms. “No, don’t let fathers words get to you.” He cooed as Sherlock sobbed into his jumper. “Come now,” He said looking at the bloody mess of Sherlocks knees not minding the blood seeping into his jummper. “Let’s get you washed up, yeah? Maybe play Pirates before bed?” Getting no response from the trembling mess in his arms, he stood up, and proceeded to walk up the stairs humming a lullaby to try and soothe the ache in the young boys heart.
"It's...fine. I was caught up in my thoughts. Happens a lot." Sherlock stops talking and takes his books from John. "You didn't need to do that. Thank you," He says looking down.
"You're the youngest of two siblings. You're worried about your older brother who is going back to Uni after dropping out. Your parents are happily married, but travel a lot leaving you to man the house seeing as your alcoholic of an older brother won't. You worry for your brother, not only because of his alcohol abuse, but for the mentally abusive relationship he's in," Sherlock states while his eyes roam up and down John's frame.
It was a bad day. He knew it when he woke up. Probably should have stayed home under the covers where nothing could get him. Mycroft was proud of him though for trying school again without breaking down. He has to try today. But now his hands are shaking and he can't open his locker and-oh god-his arms itch and his head is becoming crowded and, and...
Sherlock looks up and meets his gaze. "To nick the vein. I was trying. I-" he looks down at his wrist. "My brother found me that night and...stopped me before I could."
“Oh John, really I’m full you don’t need too-“ he was cut off from his excuse by John holding up a finger.
“I enjoy reading. I have quite a collection of books at home ranging from Dickens to Rolling. Classics are my favorite though, especially “Frankenstein”.  That’s a favorite of mine.”
“M’sorry, John. I can leave if you want. You,”� Sherlock gulped. “can forget we ever met. And we can go back to being-“
"My, don't. John's not a goldfish," Sherlock says softly looking at his brother. The brothers share a look John cannot figure out. They must have had a conversation like this before because Mycroft nods before turning and saying, "I'll be in the car. Don't be long."
Sherlock was quiet as he laid on the pull out bed in Johns room, collecting and filtering all the data he could about his new found friend. The glow stars on the ceiling, obviously left from when he was a child, were scattered without a pattern or care and spoke of childhood curiosity. The bookshelf to the side next to the window was littered with trophies and family photos. Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes. For once, he didn’t want to automatically know all about someone. He wanted to learn about John, from John. It was strange to not want to know everything at once, and Sherlock felt a grin tug at his lips at the thought of being normal for once.
"And I've finally met the famous rugby captain! It's nice to meet you, John. I'm afraid you missed my lecture about class procedures, but you won't be tested on it so I wouldn't worry." Mr.O'Brian says with a wink. "I think there's an empty seat in the back, Mr.Watson."
'Defiantly self harm marks. From bullying? Possibly. Apparently he was homeschooled all last year...could it have a correlation with his scars...' John shudders, not liking where his train of thought is going. He pulls his keys from his pocket and unlocks the front door to his house.
He looked away from the body in front of him, toward the shower tile, and saw it had little rivers of blood flowing towards the drain.
“I’ll start,” John answered, moving to lay on his side, head held up by his hand. “What is your full name?”
“It’s...it’s quite a beautiful story. The movies, of course, got it all wrong. But then again they always do.” He answered with a slight chuckle. Above him, he heard John laugh along with him.
I tried my hand at deducting in this chapter and hope I did it justice! Please let me know what you think!!
“I said, I’m sorry I don’t have much else in terms of blankets and pillows. These are some of Harry’s old sheets. Seem to still be good though. Mom washed them before they went to the closet so,” he threw the bedding at Sherlock. “Hope it will do.”
Sherlock swallowed the lump that was suddenly in his throat. He pulled his knees up to his chest, and laid his head on his knees.
‘Make it go away, gotta make it go away, make it quiet again’ his mind continued to ramble as he shakily got to his feet. He walked to his bed and without thinking flipped over his pillow and grabbed the scalpel hidden there.
The belt hit him like steel, and pushed his hands and knees farther into the glass. He tried to count the blows, but was finding it harder to do as pain clouded his thoughts.
“I will admit it’s not for everyone.” Sherlock repeated, only to be bombarded by a pillow to the face.
Hi lovelies!! This chapter is sort of a filler, but I feel it’s important. I just spent the last hour or so storyboarding and setting up characters-those introduced and those not yet- so I feel this chapter is a good set up for the coming storyline. This chapter also took me a while to get started writing.  I never thought people would actually want to read what's in my head.
"Don't mention it." John says as he leans over to collect the books that had once again fallen. He is about to hand them to the curly-haired boy when a voice breaks through the corridor.
"Do I really have to go to school, My? You have connections, I know you do, couldn't you find me a private professor to teach me at home?" Sherlock asked his brother while glaring out of the tinted window of his brother's black sedan.
“What was that?” He questioned, eyeing the bright pink blanket and grey pillow the blonde was holding.
“Hush.” John cut off. His voice barley a whisper. “Just...hush. Dry off and come down stairs. Like I said, food is getting cold. Didn’t know what you’d, uh, like. I ordered beef and broccoli and we each have an egg roll. So, uh yeah. Just dry off then.” He stammered shutting the door to the bath.
Somehow, he knew Sherlock had been brought back to a childhood trauma. Child abuse, it had to be from the way he spoke of his father.
“It’s complicated...I don’t mind. But...would you be okay with just the basics right now?” Sherlock finished, looking back up at John.
John couldn’t help the smile that made its way across his face as he heard the slight snoring from the boy below him. It had been a long day and he was glad to see him finally get some rest. John moved so he was laying on his back. He sighed deeply. What a day it had been. In all his exhaustion he had nearly forgotten the reason he had brought Sherlock to his house.
John sighs as he opens the fridge and pulls out last night's spaghetti. As he puts the bowl in the microwave, a small smile twitches at his lips. His mind had gone back to thinking of Sherlock. He can't wait for first period.
‘To think this was all caused by a broken beaker. It didn’t even have a thing in it.’He thinks to himself as he tries to control his breathing. He hasn't had an attack like this in quiet some time. He had forgotten how they felt. The panic pounding through his veins, the self-doubt clouding his mind accompanied by the voices and the uncontrollable shaking. He shudders and tries to take a deep breath.
“Not Mycroft, Sherlock.” John replies worried. Disorientation is never a good sign in any situation.
John hung up the phone, and sighed. He ran his hands over his face and looked at the kitchen clock. The digital numbers gleamed back at it him, the neon lights telling him it was nearly eight o’clock. He heard the water turn on and smiled.
“When are you gonna stop protecting this queer, Butterball?” His father jeered, as he let his hands fall to his side. “You won’t always be here to protect him, ya know?”He whispered, as he began to re align his belt.
They sat in a comfortable silence for a while. Both just laying, looking at everything and nothing all at once. Sherlock snuggled into the covers, getting comfortable.
‘Better now than never to think about what you saw. What you heard.’ He thought somberly. His mind traveled back to what he saw in the bathroom. Sherlock, knees to his chest, eyes blown wide with fear at some unknown scene in his head.
“First game if you want too. The season starts soon. I’ll let you know the schedule when I get it. Ah! Home sweet home!” John exclaims as they get to a little robin blue house in the suburbs of London. Sherlock watches him struggle with the lock and key before he unlocks the door. He enters and looks back at him. “You commin?”
“That’s okay. You deserve some mind time to yourself after that fiasco. Anyway, I was wondering if you wanted to go to one of my rugby games when season starts.”
“Yeah, they aren’t they?” He heard John reply. It sounded muffled, as if it was coming from the other end of a tunnel. ‘Weird. He’s sitting right next to me.’ He thought sleepily. He had no time to ponder the thought. Sleep overtook him like a tidal wave and he felt himself succumb and relax into the bed before he remembered nothing at all.
John sucked in a breath and looked down. “Eh...yeah so,” he looked around and Sherlock noticed a slight blush on his cheeks. That was odd. ‘Must collect more data’ he quickly thought before John continued.
John sits there in a stunned silence. He didn't expect Sherlock to share such intimate details if his life. Before he realizes what he's doing he finds himself pulling Sherlock into a hug.
“I didn’t. It was all we had in the kitchen," John says as he watches Sherlock eat two more cookies like a starving man. A thought strikes him, and fearful of the answer, John finds himself asking: "When was the last you ate?"
‘But, my calculations where nothing but perfect! Nothing wrong should have occurred! I double-no triple- checked all my work.’ Sherlock’s mind raced as he pushed himself to his feet. Mycrofts meeting had him running late again, and for once he was thankful of his brother not being here.
He walked down to the kitchen and sat down at a chair. Sherlock followed not five minutes later, still damp. He sat down and faced John, hands folded under his chin.
Sherlock is slammed out of his thoughts by the sound of people entering the room. He watches them, deducing them slowly one by one. A tall brunet girl walks in followed by the loud pop of her chewing gum-cheerleader, cheating on her boyfriend with a university guy. The story is made clear to him by her anklet: it's gold, thin, and has a charm of an eagle-the local University's mascot. Father's a banker while the Mother works with the PTA giving her some control over the school; only child. The cheating brunet is followed by a set of twin boys with short brown hair and Heterochromia. That was interesting. Each sibling has one brown eye and one green eye, and if they were to face each other directly, each color would meet its mirror. After deducing their eyes, he spent little time on them, not wanting to deduce their sex life-obviously twincest by the way they look at each other: the taller of the two obviously being the dominant by the way he-nope, moving on.
Sherlock caught the bedding and looked down at it. The bright pink was almost blinding. He had always liked the color pink. “It’s...good John. Thank you.” He replies with a smile.
“Science. If you can consider that a hobby. I like experimenting, seeing and figuring out how things work. Science is concrete. It always makes sense, always has a reason.”
He took the stairs two at a time and knocked on the door. No response. He knocked louder and cleared his throat. Still, no answer came from the other side. Getting worried he banged on the door and called out.
John turns to find the seat O'Brian is mentioning, and spots the chair. He makes his way to it while looking around to see who is in the class. There is Jessica, the cheerleader who is dating Jake Wyldeer: number 15 on the rugby team. The Twins-as everybody calls them -Marc and Chase; along with about three other faces John recognizes. He gets to his seat in the back, and looks around to see he was sitting by. For thrifty seconds John forgets how to breathe. Siting directly beside him is the most beautiful boy John had ever seen. He is skinny, with marble like skin and dark black curls that frame his face. He is slouched in the chair as if hiding with his long legs stretched out in front of him.
"Well I find it creepy that your brother knows that you're here, but I don't mind you staying the night. Harry's at her girlfriend's and my parents are out traveling, it will just be us. I'm sure I have some extra blankets..." John stops and looks up at Sherlock. "If it's cool with you,that is."
“Yes? What’s wrong? Did I do something?” He asked, panic rising slowly in him. Had he done something on accident to make John uncomfortable.
"It's not a problem," the boy says while turning to face him as much as he could while still being discreet. John's breath once again decides to stop. The boy has jutting cheek bones that sit high on his face, and the eyes that look back at him are beautiful. John tries placing a color to them, but soon gives up. They seem to flint from grey, to blue, to gold.
Like a zombie, he headed to the bathroom and laid down in the tub. He rolled up the sleeve of his left arm. Scars littered the paleness of his forearm greeting him like an old friend. He smiled, and brought the blade up to his wrist.
“Okay, okay that’s all right. Just breathe.” Sherlock finds himself pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around his legs. He puts his head on his knees and breathes deep.
He sighed as the blade cut into his skin, rivulets of crimson staining porcelain. Again and again the blade went down across his arm, before he stopped to look at his work. He blinked slowly, and stared at the blue vein in the center of his wrist. He brought the blade up lengthwise against the pounding blue vein, and pushed deep, pulling down.
“The only instrument I ever learned was the clarinet in grade school.” John chuckled. “Not much of music theory there.”
'That answers that question. I wonder if he will let me order dinner tonight. Chinese food sounds nice...'
Sherlock yawned as well, and laid back down closing his eyes. “ I like Winter. Everything is quiet. The city always seems to be asleep. Plus,”- He stifled another yawn as his eyes closed. “Snow angels are quite fun to make.”
I’m sorry this chapter was a little late getting out to you guys! I hope it was at least worth it. I meant to have it up yesterday but life and work got busy. Should I write more in Johns perspective?? As always please leave your comments and kudos down below! I love hearing what you have to say! Love you all!
"I said: Leave. Him. Alone. Do you understand that? Or are you too stupid?" John snarls with a cold furry.
He gasped as pain flooded his body, making him drop the scalpel on the bloody bathtub tile. He keened as he looked at his arm, blackness edging in the corners of his vision. He could no longer see the paleness of his skin. All he saw was the beautiful waterfall of crimson.
“Freak, queer, sociopath...”he rambled to himself as his hands pounded his skull trying to quiet the storm inside. He had not thought of that specific memory in months and his knees ached with memory of the pain.
“WILLIAM YOU BETTER NOT BE IN MY STUDY!” The bitter memory of his father was like a gut punch, and he shook his head to clear the fog of his mind.
"It's not a problem; just be sure to not make a habit of being late," the teacher, Mr. O'Brain says with a smile. "I was about to take roll, and since you happen to be right here, I may as well start with you. What's your name?" The teacher asks.
"Three firsts. I'm introducing you to James Bond tonight." John can only laugh at Sherlocks confused look.
“I guess playing my violin could also be considered a hobby.” He chimed. “You should see it, John. Vintage, German-made circa 1880. Made from well-flamed maple with a fine belly grain, varnished in orangey brown. It’s beautiful.” He paused. “It was my mother’s. It got passed down to me.” He finished his thought quietly.
" I don't know what's happened in your life, but to see how it's affected you. God whatever hell you've been through to make you-I'm so sorry, Sherlock." John says suppressing a sob as he grabs the boy's shoulders, looking him in the eyes. The eyes that meet his shift in color and he finds that he can't look away.
"I'll be back to pick you up when classes are over, but I'm afraid this is where we must part ways brother dear." Sherlock only nodded, and shut the passenger side door. He breathed in a lungful of the cool Autumn air as he watched his brother drive off. He let it out shakily and adjusted his blue scarf, before he turned and faced the school in front of him. Slowly, Sherlock pulled out a slip of paper from his pocket and stared at it before starting to walk to his first class of the day. Fourth Year English with Mr.O'Brian.
Sherlock slammed his hands to his head as soon as he was safely inside the locked bathroom, and prayed himself to not go there, not yet. He staggered on his feet towards the shower, and turned the water on full blast to drown out any noise he may make, sat under the faucet head finally allowing him self to go back to that night, a week before school.
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes.” Sherlock replied, not looking at John. He had to admit this game was a little nerve-wracking. He didn’t know what questions John was going to ask him, or if the blonde would respond well to what he had to say.
Sherlock scurried to find a way to clean his mess, his year two mind scrambling. But he was too late. He felt the unkind hands of his father grab him by his nape, and slam him into the wall.
"Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. I'll warn you next time," John says as he bends down to collect Sherlock's books.
"Really? That's not what people usually say. Or how they react." the last part is mumbled, as if he had spoke a thought out-loud.
“…so yeah sorry I don’t have much else in terms of blankets and pillows, but I hope this will do.” Johns' voice broke Sherlock out of his thoughts.
John cuts Sherlock's thoughts off again, "You're not broken, Sherlock. You don't need to be fixed. Whoever told you that is a fucking idiot."
“Oi! Sherlock? Mate you okay!? Been over an hour, foods getting cold? I’m coming in, sorry, but I’m fearing the worst here...” Johns voice trailed off as he entered the bathroom, eyes locking onto the scene in front of him.
“Fucking cry baby.” His father laughed, as he forcefully tore Sherlock from the wall and slammed his hands and knees into the broken class littered on the floor.
He had no answer. He didn’t know what compelled him to bring Sherlock home with him. He was right when he had said they barley knew each other, and here John had them acting like mates around the telly. But he couldn’t help it. He was drawn to Sherlock, more beyond the sable curls, something deeper attracted him.
I’m trying to keep the characters as canon as possible while still putting my own twist on them, which means I have a lot of research written in a notebook for my fiancé to find and think me crazy for XD
Sherlock turned and looked at his brother. Auburn hair combed to one side, three piece suit pressed, new pair of black Cole Haans polished to perfection, hands clasped in his lap, exasperated expression on his round face, eyes glancing at his watch every view moments. Sherlock-despite his best efforts- deduced the signs in a matter of seconds. He had made his brother late yet again to another important meeting.
“I really wouldn’t know John.” Sherlock answered laying back down to stare at the scattering stars again. He pulled the covers around him, before continuing. “You are, like I said my first friend if you don’t count my brother. It does sound interesting though.”
“Stop that!”John scolds as he sits next to him. John opens the water and hands it to the crystal eyed boy. “Drink.” He commands as Sherlock takes the bottle in a shaking hand.
"By the way, what you did in class today was utterly fantastic! You never gave me the chance to tell you that. You left right when the bell rang."
Sherlock hesitated for a moment. He actually found the movie quiet bland and predictable. But, seeing Johns excitement he couldn’t quiet say that to his new...friend. He’d have to get used to thinking that word.
“Fine. Since you, like my brother are so determined to get “meat on my bones” “, he raised his fingers to indicate the quoting, “Chinese food sounds nice.” He finished, lowering his hands back down.
Hey guys. This work is not abandoned. Depression and writer's block sucks. I am working on a new chapter, it’s just happening slowly as I figure out how to get to the main plotline of this story. Thanks for sticking in. Feel free to comment if you have anything you’d be interested in reading! Love you!
It takes ten minutes to walk from school to Johns house. The entire way, John chatters. He talks about everything. Rugby. School. The quiz they have next Friday. Sherlock watches John as they walk and takes note of the way his hair turns gold in the light and how his eyes take a gleam when speaking about his rugby team. He feels butterfly’s stir in his stomach when John turns his blue eyes to his multi colored ones
But oh, how Mycroft was wrong. He was a freak. He rocked on the floor as the summer breeze blew through the window of his room.
“If I have any say in it, I will.” his brother said defiantly, staring dead straight into eyes that so matched his own. Oh how he hated the resemblance he had with his father.
Mycroft said sounding worried. He had tried his hardest to keep the irritation out of his features. The next thing he needed was Sherlock blaming himself. He turned his mind away from that train of thought, not wanting to relive the moment he found Sherlock curled up in the bathtub, wrist a mangled mess, all because he had told the younger boy he had made him late to a meeting that could potentially lead to him loosing his job. No. Not that again.
"Oh, don't tell me this little queer has gotten to you, Watson," Troy says with a sneer as he shoves his way past John to stand in front of Sherlock. "After all, all he wants to do is go down on you. Isn't that right, freak?"
"Here. We should probably get off the floor," John says as he heaves himself up and reaches a hand down to Sherlock. Sherlock tentatively takes his offered hand and lets himself be pulled up.
He looked down at his hands. The same hands that had cleaned... he gulped...that had cleaned Sherlock’s suicide attempt wound.
“How do you like your tea?” John calls over his shoulder. His only answer is a muffled thumping sound. “SHIT!” John cries. He leaves the empty cups he had been retrieving to rush back to the living room. His eyes grow wide and his heart races at what he sees-Sherlock lying face down on the carpet. He seemed to not have the strength to raise himself back up.
Mycroft closed his eyes and sighed. He'd been over this nearly a thousand times with his little brother.
“Well, you did say to say it again.” Sherlock replies grinning and moving the pillow under his head. “I believe it’s your turn for a question.”
"I have to go." Sherlock says while grabbing his books from John. John feels his heart leap in his throat at the rejection in the boy's eyes.
Secondly, this chapter is incredibly long, and dark! It has two flashbacks in it as well, so please be warned: if you are triggered by scences of self harm or child abuse, please proceed with caution!
“No need to thank me mate.”John says as he accepts the out stretched hand. “Shit, you’re bleeding!”he murmurs eyeing his arm.
He closed his eyes and pulled the covers over him as another yawn overtook him. Tomorrow was Saturday. He’d think more later.
‘Fuck, no, no, no’ he cried in his mind, increasing his pace up the stairs and slamming his way into his room. He quickly cleaned his room in hopes to calm his mind. His work was to no avail, and he found him self sinking to his knees on his now clean floor, fingers clinched in his hair, as memory’s he’d rather delete-but could never seem too-bombarded him.
"I see my brother has taken to you, John," Mycroft says as he takes John's offered hand. "Do not let it be misplaced."
“That’s it. There you go. Do I need to call someone for you?” John asks, concern lacing his voice. Finally Sherlock finds his voice, even if he hasn't mastered breathing.
His father only bellowed a laugh in return, and turned out of the room with an echoing “Good luck with that.” before slamming the manor doors behind him.
Sherlock stilled his body for the hit he knew was coming, and let the stream of tears flow as he babbled our pleas of “I’m sorry!” and “Please!” Knowing they would go ignored.
“Sherlock, I promise my opinion won’t change. I just,” John shifted, “just want to get to know you.” He finished.
“Oi, Sherlock,” John stared again grabbing the larger mans attention. “If you’d like to wash up, showers on the second floor, second door to the left. Should be a towel in the upper cabi-Oh, yes hello? 813 Chinese...”
“WILLIAM!” His father screamed again, his voice a booming thunder. His feet, like hammers down the hallway.
“Two rehab trips and twice as many relapses says otherwise,” John replied sighing. “But it’s still something to hope for.” He smiled at Sherlock as he finished.
"It doesn't look too bad. Just opened the scabs. You worried me; that was a lot of blood. Thought you nicked a vein." Sherlock remains quiet as John wraps his wrist in gauze. "Keep that on overnight."
Sherlock stared at the man in front of him. Once again in the short time between them meeting, John had surprised Sherlock. For all his stature John Watson had a quiet strength about him;must be what made him captain of the Rugby team.
"You were wondering about my eyes: what color they are. I don't have a specific color. It's rare, and I have a specific type. The twins up in the front have it as well, only not sectoral," the boy replies while leaning back.
But that’s not what caught his attention. No. What made him stop cold in his tracks and sent ice through his veins was how he was able to count every rib on his body. Spinal notches visible through thin skin, the stark whiteness only disturbed by what seemed like cigarette burns.
“John! No! Don’t. It’s fine. Really.” Sherlock panics tugging his sleeve back down. John saw a bit of the scars that litters his wrist the first day but to see the whole extent-Sherlock can’t bear to show him. John would surely think him strange, then re-think being friends with him, and Sherlock-not ever considering having one before-can’t bear the thought of losing him.
He looks to John for an answer. John had a hand placed on Sherlock’s shoulder and the other on his hip-when did John get in front of him? He seemed to be trying to get Sherlock to sit down. Slowly Sherlock feels himself slide down the lockers.
Sorry about any and all typos! Work was recently deleted by accident and having to fix things on an iPhone is weird! Please feel free to comment and leave reviews!!
“I conduct experiments. Keep all the successful ones written down in a notebook. I also compose music on my violin.  No finished pieces to date, but I’m working slowly.”
"Good. Because if I ever see, or hear, that you fucking laid a hand on him, there will be hell to pay. Now scram." John says as he throws Troy off to the side. Troy stumbles before running down the hall. Sherlock watches him run as he slowly lowers his shaking form to the floor and clutching his head in his hands. He curls his finger in his curls and tugs. He didn't notice he was crying until John spoke again.
"Don't be. I think it's great having a sibling who car-" John's voice falters as he notices the boy's wrist. The sleeves must have been pulled up during his incident with Troy. Along Sherlock's wrist is a mess of silver-white scars. Noticing his gaze Sherlock pulls his sleeves down muttering, "It's not important."
"You think you know everything don't you? Fucking homeschooled last year and skipped a grade. You think you're so far above everybody else, but you're not freak. Everybody else knows you're nothing but a pathetic little faggot wh-"
“ ‘fell ‘croft. Nothing to worry-to worry ‘bout.” the limp brunet mumbles incoherently in Johns arms.
"Hey, Mike! My break was uneventful, as usual. My parents left Harry and I on our own all summer. Which means I was stuck in my room while she and Clara snogged on the sofa. Aside from rugby practice, all I did was binge watch the James Bond movies and surf the web. You?" John listens to Mike, as he talks about how he and his dad had traveled over the summer and how his mother had applied him to a jumpstart medical program. Mike's detailed description of his summer was soon cut short by the sound of the school bell telling everybody to go to class. John gathers up his bag, says his goodbyes to Mike, and heads towards his first class. Mr. O'Brian's English 4.
"It was my fault you dropped them. I should be in charge of picking them up," John says with a smile.
“Well,” John said still chuckling slightly. “My mom and dad travel a lot, as you already deduced. My dads a journalist and my mother is a reporter. They travel with some news company. They come home once or twice every two months or so to check up on Harry and I. Harry is five years older than me and is often at her girlfriend's house-when they aren’t fighting- if she’s not at a bar.” He finished, furrowing his brows. “I hate her drinking problem, but who am I but her younger brother. What do I know” he spat.
He stops deducing his classmates, and moves on to the teacher as he enters the room. Sherlock has an entire semester to deduce those around him, but needs to deduce each of his teachers thoroughly on the first day to determine how the semester would go. Mr.O'Brian is a stocky man, with straight dark brown hair. He seems to be in his mid thirties, about 5'5, and happily married to his husband of five years. (The photo nearest to the laptop shows the couple together.) He has a kind face and trusting sea green eyes which seemed to be dancing as he looked about the classroom as more students pour in. Dog owner, due to the hairs stuck on his trousers. Sherlock notices he is a thumb biter by the way the skin near his cuticles are frayed.
Sherlock's head snapped up. That was surprising. He had thought John would be straight, maybe even a  bit of a womanizer. “That’s...” Sherlock started.

“Plates of cookies on a couch do not substitute as dinner Sherlock. You haven’t eaten in a week, and even if I have to stuff it down your throat, I will get you to eat something.”
“Well, I guess rugby could be considered a hobby of mine. It's relaxing, the physicality of it all. Great way to let off steam.” John paused, and Sherlock looked up to see him smiling and staring off in the distance. “ I also like to study and read up on medical discoveries and techniques.” He continued, pointing to the books on his self. “Those medical books were given to me by my grandfather last Christmas. They are the most up to date books he could find on medical practices and techniques. It’s fascinating, Sherlock. The way the body works, the way it can heal itself. It’s just-ugh I can't explain it. It’s just amazing.”
“No, that’s not what I meant.  I love you and I know you love me.  It’s just … I just want you to know that this can be separate.  You don’t have to ‘be in the mood’ for sex with me if you just feel like your symptoms need to be relieved.  I don’t want you to feel imprisoned by needing this done.  This should be done at least once a month, more if needed.  I can do it myself, always, if you want, but if you don’t want, I won’t take it personally.  Understand?”
John spent the five minutes making tea and brought in a fresh cup for Sherlock when he knocked and entered the room with his suture removal kit as well.  Sherlock was still dressed in his button-down shirt and socks but had taken his trousers off.  Either he took off his pants or his pants leg was hiked up to the crease of his groin.  John couldn’t tell because he was covered in a blanket from his chest to his knees with the blanket moved aside just enough for John to access the wound.
When the two made it through the door, Sherlock had most of his weight on Lestrade.  John jumped up and was at Sherlock’s side in an instant pulling at the man’s coat.  “What the hell happened?”
John had an automatic, visceral reaction to such an intimate touch and felt his knees go weak.  Strong hands held him up against the door as he felt Sherlocks lips close to his, just breathing him in.  Sherlock’s hands roamed up his sides, under the jumper, under the shirt.  John felt spent already, completely and utterly weakened by the touch his gaze mesmerized by Sherlock’s eyes locked with his own.  “Ugh … gawd.”
“It’s true, I didn’t want you to know.  I’m infuriated that Mycroft sent for you for this.  I am livid and betrayed and absolutely incensed about this entire event,” Sherlock gritted his teeth and looked seethingly angry.  He closed his eyes and took some deep breaths.  “But not at you, John.”  Sherlock opened his eyes and sighed.
Should he have made another choice of physicians?  Did he really feel so indifferent about John seeing him after he’d had sex?  After he’d had rough sex?  After he’d been … abused?  No, not abused.  Children are abused.  Powerless people are abused.  He wasn’t a child and he was far from powerless.  Assaulted.  He’d been assaulted.  John and Mycroft threw other words at him about the event but he could not let his mind go there.  No.  He was still trying to control his PTSD from Serbia.  He just could not let another r… any other thing sidetrack him on reprogramming his mind palace.  This was a small distraction.  That’s all.
“Fine.  Just trying to help you.  If you need… more sexual partners, if that’s what you have to do, fine.  But you are NOT answering any Lonely Hearts ads and you’re not meeting anyone alone”
“Uh huh.  So deep throating the banana?  Walking around in just your pants with an erection?  Your experiment on ‘the coagulation rate of ejaculate in the human male’?  Where did you get the samples for that Sherlock?  You sodding tossed off whenever it suited you to have another sample, that’s what you did.”
John nodded, “yes, I suppose that’s true, but I’m not the one sporting a gash on the palm of his hand from grabbing hold of a particularly rusted through fence.”
Yes, Mycroft had eventually “waded in” in Serbia, but he had already spent months in perdition and they had performed every type of torture known to man, he was sure of that, being the recipient of them all.  Repeated sexual assault was the least of it.  There had even been times he would rather have been raped again than endure the horrific beatings, waterboarding, and creative uses with sharp instruments.  He remembered having to bite his lip to stop himself from begging for them to just fuck him and be done, just for a while.  Fuck him or kill him.  He hadn’t cared which.
“Hmm.”  Sherlock grumbled noncommittally.  He turned and flipped the light switch back on and John felt a firm grip on his chin pulling his jaw downward.  Soon he found himself with a wooden stick shoved into his mouth.
Just when John was about to insist Sherlock let him do a complete once over, he remembered the physical he had done on Sherlock and the reason for the delays then.  “Oh.”  John turned toward the sink and began washing his hands again.  “It’s just a small form of shock, Sherlock.  Not a big deal.  It’s what makes your pulse and your breathing so rapid.  You’ll get sleepy here shortly as well,” John explained attempting to give Sherlock a bit of space and attempt to dissolve some of the humiliation he might be feeling.  Not for the first time John found himself wondering about Sherlock’s medical kink and how long it had been going on.  He wasn’t one to judge others for what made them go ‘round though.  It wasn’t his business.  If Sherlock had a kink, so what.  If Sherlock liked to masturbate in front of pink-haired troll dolls it had nothing to do with John whatsoever.  John toweled his hands off and put on a fresh pair of sterile gloves to finish the job.  “Just put your hand down on the table.  I think we can both sit for the last of it, yeah?”
At some point, Sherlock lost the hold on his own legs and began fisting the sheets and pounding on the mattress.  John still took his time, going for the sweeter, slow build that would tear the man apart.
Dr. Humphrey finished examining Sherlock and then turned toward John. "I'll have to expose him a bit in order to do the stitching. You might want to step out for this."
With a gentle hand John’s fingers wondered around Sherlock’s back then migrated southward toward the sac held high and tight to Sherlock’s body.  He was so close.  John wished he could see his face, hold him more closely.  The best he could do was stand behind him, kiss his back and grind his hips into Sherlock’s to let him know he was still there.  Well that, and continue to stroke his prostate.  Left border, in. Right border, in.  God, his finger was in Sherlock’s ass.  Sherlock wanted it to be there.  He was stroking Sherlock’s prostate.  Not in a clinical way but in an intimate way.  He nipped at the swell of Sherlock’s buttock, took a lick of his skin.
Not for the first time since they’d become partners, John felt protective toward the man sleeping in his lap.  He stroked the dark curls away from Sherlock’s face fondly and rubbed soothing circles into his hip with the other hand.
“John.  I’m sorry.  I should have asked.  My clean bill of health is on my dresser.  I was tested last week and I promise I have not engaged in any risky behaviors in years.”  He rubbed by shoulder.  “I apologize.  It’s no excuse but I was caught up in it.  You must know that I would never put you at risk.  Not for anything.”
With the patience of a saint, John resigned.  “Sod it,” he whispered to himself.  “Nevermind,” he stated to his friend as he reached for the button on his trousers.  Finally in nothing but socks and his boxers, John reached for the gown.
"Good God, get that smile off of your face. It is way too loud." Sherlock tried to move out of bed but it seemed as though his limbs were not working properly. "I'm completely naked. Why in the hell am I naked?"
He was able to make it to the loo.  A bit stiff, but he made it without too much cause for concern.  His backside hurt, obviously and his head had a lump but no bleeding.  A massive headache but he didn’t feel like he was concussed.  His skin itched.  All he wanted was a good shower to rinse off the remnants of last night and forget about the entire thing.  He stared longingly at the shower.  To hell with Mycroft and his three bloody minutes.  He wasn’t concerned about preserving evidence.  He had no intention of filing this incident with The Yard.  The thought of giving his statement to Donovan or Lestrade made his stomach churn once more.  No, that was not happening.
I push him up against a nearby wall.  My cock was hard as hell and I thrust against him pushing him into the wall.  “You want my cock in your arse?”
John stopped Sherlock before they began their nocturnal adventure.  “Sherlock, I just want to be sure you understand.  This involves some extensively intimate examinations.  I have to be thorough, you know.  I won’t cock this up trying to allow you your privacy.”
He was aesthetically pleasing, but there was no chemical reaction in his brain to make Sherlock feel the necessary physical response one needed to make this more pleasurable.  Sherlock’s date rid himself of his jacket and his shirt quickly then turned to Sherlock and wrapped his arms around his waist.
“Oh.”  Sherlock removed himself from his garments and shoes like they were on fire and then tossed them across the room.  A moment later, after he had deduced he wasn’t even safe from his own shirt, he yanked that off as well and it soon joined the rest of the pile.
“I know.  I’ll be careful.”  Sherlock flipped open the cap and placed a generous amount of the gooey substance onto two of his fingers before kneeling between John’s knees.
“Oh for … dammit Sherlock,” John admonished.  “Stand with your weight on this leg,” John gave a smack to Sherlock’s bare left buttock, “then let this leg go limp,” he instructed as he gave the right buttock a quick slap as well.
John grabbed the crisp, white sheet and quickly draped it over Sherlock as soon as he’d sat down on the table wearing just his button up shirt.  “Up you go then.” And he directed his patient onto his back.  “Let me put this stirrup into place before you move down the table.”  He made quick work of the other stirrup.  “Actually, just stay where you are a moment.  I can get your ultrasound completed without you being in the stirrups.”
