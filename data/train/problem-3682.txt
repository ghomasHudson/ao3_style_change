Dean nodded and stood up, wiping his eyes and climbing in the car. He scooted much closer to Cas this time and laid his head on his shoulder.
Dean smiled and patted his back softly. “You’re the hero here, buddy. I’ve got you.” The emotions he was feeling were overwhelming, and before he could catch it, Dean closed his eyes and let a single tear fall.
He takes a moment to watch that ass walk away, then sighs as he steps through the gate. It seems weird as shit that Frenchie didn't take him the whole way, but the moment the gate shuts behind him, he's greeted by another prisoner.
better than the alternative. He stared at the gorgeous marks and cleared his throat, distracting himself from how badly he wanted to leave more. “I think they can fill in the blanks themselves, Cas.”
He hit with a grunt/moan combo that sounded so delicious Dean slipped right between his legs and rutted their hard, clothed cocks together. “Shit... Dean...”
“I eat everything, seriously... everything.” Dean grabbed a plate and piled it high. “Thanks, guys. For the food and for lettin’ me crash.” He sat down across from Adam. “Been kinda in hiding.”
Dean looked down and noticed they both had their pants on backwards. He chuckled and pointed at Cas’ plaid pajamas. “Dress much?” he teased, while tugging at the waistband playfully.
“Usually, when Ares and I watch television, we watch the news or a documentary. I haven’t seen many movies or tv shows… I’m sorry, I know that’s not interesting at all.” He blushed, and hated the feeling of the heat in his cheeks. “What about you? Other than sports, what do you usually watch?”
Cas reached out and brushed his thumb over Dean’s jaw. He wanted to know what he was going to say, but didn’t want to push him. “Did I at least give you what you wanted?”
The diner is relatively empty so Dean doesn’t have to play anything off as he makes his way inside the bathroom. When the door closes behind him, Cas is already bracing against the stall and stroking himself.
Cole laughs obnoxiously. “I don’t know. Look, if you don’t want to ask like an adult would, you got to test him.”
Jask laughed quietly. “No people food, scouts honor. How much longer are you gonna be? I miss that ass.”
He flashed back to the days Dean had shared his lunch, that day by the tree where he’d intentionally sought Cas out, and all of the other encounters they’d had recently and smiled against Dean’s heated skin. Something that felt a lot like real, tangible
“I meant as a bad guy, asshole!” Jask snickered, standing up and picking Ares up with him. “But I kinda feel the same way. It’s a little silly to fuck Dean when I’ve got what I need right here.”
His moan had Dean leaning down to kiss along the back of his ear as Cas said, “I’ve wanted this since the first time I saw you, Dean.”
He could feel himself hardening and panicked, breaking the kiss and dropping his forehead to Dean’s shoulder. “I think…”
“That so?” Dean looks him up and down and realizes he’s actually pretty damn hot, especially now that he’s felt his strength. “So no punishment from you, Frenchie?”
"I wouldn't be mad if you did. I tend to be the more bossy one in bed, though." Dean winked again and walked toward the doorway. "I'll get our plates ready while you get comfortable. Feel free to snoop all you want, you wanna beer?"
Dean chuckled and stood in front of him, having to pull the tie off completely to start over. “Gods, you're adorable. It’s gonna be perfect. Watch.”
Cas licked his lip and squirmed a little in his seat. “I suppose you need to know this, anyway. I tend to have a lot of nightmares. They… bleed out into my books, no matter how hard I try not to. It’s like they’re the only inspiration I have sometimes.”
Dean sniffs the air again, ignoring how most of the omegas there back away, fear etched on all of their faces — all except one...
“No... let’s try it.” He reached out and grabbed Cas’ hand. “Would you go on a date with me? There’s this dingy ol’ restaurant in the middle of nowhere I’ve been dyin’ to try.” Dean smiled widely, trying to make the best out of their situation.
Two fingers press up behind his balls as his cock disappears completely into that tight throat, and Dean loses the battle. He comes with a growl, emptying into Cas and humping his face through the aftershocks.
Cas turned his head but knew he wouldn’t be able to see him unless he moved his entire body. “You are. During this month, you reminded me of all the reasons I love you. Ask me something... anything.”
Cas prompted Cole to continue, and that brave little toaster did. “Crazy girl broke into Dean’s house. She was harmless, but the window’s shot to hell and it took way longer than it should’ve for the cops to show up.”
Sam opened his mouth to speak and Dean cut him off again, "and why do you assume it will be me who kisses him? 'Have you kissed him yet?'" He mocked in a horrible Sam-like impression.
Dean said it again, this time with confidence and truth ringing out in his words. “I love you, Cas. And not just cause you’re the only one here now. I love you because you’ve been there all along. Whether it was good or bad, you were there. You loved me before I loved myself... and thanks to you, I actually
Cas swallowed thickly as Sam continued speaking, but he was no longer listening. He was preoccupied trying to figure out how any of this was possible, and more importantly, how to open his mouth and introduce himself without sounding like he’d caught the first bus out of the mental institution. “H-hi,” he stammered out, oblivious to where Sam had been in his own introduction. “I’m Castiel, I’m… your new neighbor.”
Dean ran his hands up P’s thighs and gripped his hips, loving how confident he seemed on top. That ass was incredible, and when P started to bounce and fuck himself on Dean’s cock, all Dean wanted to do was see his damn face.
Cas pulls out then thrusts forward again, even as he says, “You can't — you can't talk like that, I don't want you to be hurt but I can't —” he lets out a ragged moan as he eases in deeper — “can't fucking resist you when you talk like that.”
“Yes... sir.” Dean kept jogging, possibly regretting that pie. He made it a mile before he slowed. “Alright, I should probably run more often.”
Cas ate quietly, watching more than talking like he always did, and Ares laughed loudly as Jask smacked him. “It’s his balls I keep under the bed, not his dick.”
there’s a lot standin’ in our way, but I don’t care about that. I’m crazy about you, and we’ll figure the rest out. Guess I can unpack this time.” He grinned, and the implication had Cas was still staring in disbelief.
He was watching Dean pace around the living room and was dreading asking why, because he was pretty sure he already knew what Dean wanted and it wasn’t something he was prepared to suffer through again. But when Dean started biting the skin around his thumbnail, Cas braced himself and spoke up. “Is everything okay?”
Dean chuckled and grabbed the lube, settling back between his legs and glancing up. “We got another date tomorrow so... it’s all yours sweetheart. For now, I get to see
“Heaven doesn't have anything to do with it, and that's not where I'm going. I just need out for a little bit. I've dedicated a lot of time to these prisoners and I'm afraid that if Dean tries again, all of it will crumble. I'll end up sneaking him out of here and hiding him from the law and then what? Everyone else here just has to suffer?” Cas keeps pacing, then goes to the fridge to pull that water bottle back out and squirts some whiskey into his mouth. “I've come too far for that. So have all of them.”
Cas tried to do the math. Adam lived in Blackwater, Missouri, which was a full day’s drive. Factoring in sleep and stops for fuel, it would probably take them another three days to get there. “We’re not leaving where we’re at until tomorrow… it’ll take us a few days to get to Washington. Hang on.”
He contemplated that for a couple of minutes, and Cas hoped that meant he would be honest with him. “Yeah. I am. But… not as mad as I am at myself for lettin’ you. You mighta left, but I sure as shit didn’t try to stop you.”
The radio had somehow switched from classic rock to some fucking new age ‘I’m not emo, I just have a lot of feelings’ type rock and
“There isn’t anything to talk about, Jody. It wouldn’t change anything if there was, anyway. I have no control over my life or my damn emotions anymore.”
The first thing he noticed happened to be the only thing in the room - a life-sized, marble statue of the most gorgeous human being he’d ever seen.
Cas knocked on the gym door and walked in when he heard the sound of rubber soles sliding on the court floor, realizing no one would have even noticed he was there.
He had a loving smile on his face when he locked eyes with Dean, and without hesitation he leaned in and kissed Dean on the mouth. “Hi, baby.”
He assumes it’s the latter and gets dressed in some old-timey detective suit — complete with a hat — and makes his way downstairs. “Think this outfit will get me laid?”
Dean doesn’t fight him in the slightest. The copper taste of his blood touches Cas’ taste buds as he kisses harder, rutting his thick cock against Cas’ with a moan. Any thought of resistance disappears as Cas fumbles to pull off his apron, then starts undoing Dean’s slacks. He spins them both, pushing Dean roughly against the wall and biting that infuriating tongue when it slides back into his mouth.
“This isn’t Roman Enterprises, Chuckles. I doubt you have to be a master hacker and crack the password.” As if on cue, the television flipped on above their heads, revealing yet another fucking riddle.
“Hi.” Ares nipped his throat and kissed back toward his mouth. “I want more.” He kissed him, moving to straddle him again, and Jask flattened out on his back to better support him.
“Yeah?” Dean bit his lip and tried to push into Cas’ finger. “Gonna have to stick somethin’ in there if you wanna hear me moan, baby.”
Cas chuckled and pulled up some dental treats. “Here, this will help keep his teeth clean.” Starting Baby sent a chill up his spine, and nothing could wipe the smile from his face.
That seemed to be all that chair could take, and Dean heard it snap a half second before they tumbled to the ground. Everyone was unhurt, but Havoc licking Cas’ bitchface was the icing on the cake, and Dean laughed so hard he couldn’t breathe.
where he should be — he should be at the station singing to Cas. When he stands to go and do just that, it hits him that Cas might not be there; he might never come back after what Dean pulled last night. But that’s not all that hits him, the alcohol smacks him so hard he stumbles over the stool and when he tries to play it off, Ben comes running inside the bar.
“You tell me. I personally prefer to make love not war.” Dean followed him to their table and kept his eyes on him while they ate.
“Yeah, you can, Dr. Phil. Cause I’m not on your little couch.” He realizes how stupid that sounds, especially since he
Dean pulled the book out, instantly able to tell it wasn’t a real book. The others were still arguing over the clue and didn’t even notice when Dean pulled out the damn fake blade. The lock clicked again, and no one so much as glanced in his direction.
Cas huffed a laugh and nodded, carefully getting up. “Yes. I imagine I’ll be sore tomorrow, but… it was incredibly worth it.” He looked at the broken table and sighed. “Something tells me if this keeps up, we won’t be getting our deposit back.”
He was so turned on just from the taste of Dean that it didn’t take him long to get off, and they laid in bed lazily kissing and exploring each other’s bodies until Dean’s stomach growled.
“Nah. I mean, sometimes, but I didn’t schedule any for the time you’d be here. You wanna do somethin’?”
“Please do…” Cas lifted his hips and tipped his head back, moaning quietly and digging his fingers into Dean’s sides. “That feels good, really… good…”
The rest of the day went by faster than should’ve been allowed by nature, and even though they were up late, Cas eventually had to call it a night.
“That depends, I guess. How big is your elephant?” Jask grinned, heading over to lay back on the couch he missed so much. “Fuck, it’s kinda good to be back.”
“Yes.” Cas made kissy noises as a student walked in and then slid out before he got to see Dean’s facial expression.
“Mmhmm... yeah... I do.” His hips cant off the chair in anticipation, but he bites his lip and calms himself, wanting to make Cas proud.
He reached up and gripped the back of Ares’ neck, pulling him down and darting his tongue into that perfect mouth. Tipping over, he groaned, covering his bare chest and the sides of his open shirt with his own spend.
“You have my full attention, Dean.” Cas wrapped his legs around him and looked down into Dean’s eyes. “Take out your contacts.”
“Enough!” Cain screams, trying to shove the shackles from his wrists, but they won't budge. Cas extends his palm out with a deadly expression and continues speaking that strange language, and the Sword and the Trickster step in a moment later. Cain snarls, turning and hurling himself at Dean — but the Trickster does too, and they disappear into thin air before Dean can even shield his face.
He gripped the plug and slowly pushed it forward until Dean gasped, then pulled it out completely and let it fall to the floor. The excess of lube they'd added started dripping out and Cas shoved it back in, pinning Dean to the counter as he fingered him for a moment to slick his fingers. “You're gorgeous, Dean. I'll never stop being amazed by you.”
“I deserve one every few years. You got this.” Dean leaves the station with a grin and after filling his belly at Missouri’s diner, he makes his way to the bar. It’s been years since he visited the bar out of uniform, but the warm smiles from all the townsfolk help ease some of the shame. He doesn’t feel judged at all, and it helps him order his drink confidently. “Hey, Az. Can I get a whiskey? Straight.”
“Thank you. Cas... what about you? Will you come with me? Please?” He doesn’t want to be set free without his angel, he knows he'll just end up back in the same shitty spot he was in to begin with.
Thursday laughs. “Dean, I work with hardened criminals on a daily basis. I think I can handle a grumpy uncle. For today, why don't you shadow Azrian? He works in the kitchen. You can help prepare dinner, and then once you eat, you're free for the rest of the day. I'm going to try and get ahold of Bobby and we'll talk more tomorrow, if that's okay.”
Cas bit his lip and placed a bruising grip on Dean’s hips as he lifted his own off the seat with each hammering thrust until the sight and feel of Dean pushed him over. He came hard, grunting and burying himself inside Dean. “Oh —
“Don't apologize. It's okay… I'm okay. Or, I am now, anyway. Just promise me you won't leave again.” His chest tightens with fear and he refuses to make eye contact. This is the very thing he's been so afraid of — if Dean doesn't want to stay, it'll break him.
Ashton had even hired another bodyguard in preparation — though they both thought that might’ve been a little premature. Dean was unpredictable and their decision not to tell Dean beforehand complicated things. But in the off chance that Dean got heated with someone or let it slip to the wrong person at a party, they couldn’t risk it. The success of the plan required them to be far, far away from the Miami convention center by the time anyone even noticed he was missing.
“...no. I never cheated. We were never actually a couple.” Dean tried to reason with the man with his hands raised but before security could reach them, the man charged.
Oblivious, Cas raised his eyebrows. “Who? Me and Benny?” He flicked his eyes toward the bartender and bit back a laugh. “He’s not really my type.”
“Ye—yeah. Fill me up! Come in me! Mark me inside and and out. M’all yours.” Dean holds his place so Cas can come deep inside him, his jaw slack from pleasure.
“Both... fuck... both.” Dean clenched the soap so hard he changed the shape of the bar, leaning over to rest his head on the shower wall. “Kill me. Just kill me here and now.”
They sat too close, but never quite touched, and Cas didn’t know if that was better or worse. When the movie was finally over, Cas cleared his throat and glanced toward Dean. “Do you feel better?”
Jask’s cock twitched at the same moment his heart jumped into his throat, which was a bizarre experience. “Is that permission, Ares? Say the word, and I’ll take you right here.”
He crossed his arms and leaned against the wall, letting out a breath. “Thankfully, the first one didn’t last very long. Maybe he’s available?”
“I feel guilty. The selfish dickhead in me hoped you caved too. Is that dumb?” Ares looked down at Cas’ feet and then back up to his gorgeous blue eyes.
Things with Cas were going amazingly. He’d practically moved into Dean’s house at that point, and neither were complaining. The one night they tried to stay  apart, they ended up texting until 2am and only stopped because Dean went to Cas’ house. Work the next day was hell.
He brings his come-covered hand up to Dean’s mouth and clamps it shut as he speeds up his thrusts, then comes with a yell that he muffles by biting into the back of Dean's shoulder. Every inch of his body is buzzing as he milks himself dry, and he’s only halfway through his comedown when he realizes exactly where he is.
He raised his eyebrows and took another bite. “Why? You’re hot. Secretly crazy or somethin’?” Dean bit back a smile and watched Cas from the corner of his eye. “It’s been a year for me, I can see how it would be easy to go another four.”
He had work in the morning, so he didn’t watch too long before he was drifting off to sleep. Working at 5am every day was rough, but unless he wanted to roast in the summer sun, it was necessary with a construction job. Dean didn’t even try to make it to his bed, he slumped over in his jeans and passed out.
“The first thing that comes to mind is a beehive. Y’know, thousands of bodies, one mind? Like a play on hive mind?”
on display. He knew a decent person would just go into the room without waking him — maybe toss a blanket over him first — but Jask didn’t consider himself a decent person. Moderately okay-ish, maybe… but good? No.
drunk,” Cas counters. “And I'm definitely not too drunk to consent. Ask sober me any day and he’ll say the same thing… probably.” Dean’s eyes widen, so Cas adds quickly, “Sober me is a chicken shit. The only reason I might not say it sober is because I've been afraid you'd deny me for years, and look.” He grabs his bag and makes his way out of the cell. “Instant regret on your part. I’ll walk home, don't worry about me driving.”
Being with Dean may have been legal, but the fact that he was his teacher made it highly frowned upon, so Cas kept his mouth shut. Jimmy noticed Cas was happier now than he was at any point with Benny, but he only asked about it once and then let it go. There were times Cas felt like he knew, but he didn’t push and Cas was thankful. He attempted to research homeschooling a few times over break but he couldn’t concentrate on anything that wasn’t Dean.
“It’s the washroom’s floor. And no, I started them.” He rolled his eyes and sat down to check out the spread of food. “I seriously got it made here.”
The fork clattered to the plate and Cas apologized, fumbling to pick it back up. “I... we should eat. It would be a shame if the food got cold.” He took a bite, but Dean didn’t miss the way Cas’ pupils were overtaking the blue.
Benny shrugged. “You’re askin’ the wrong person, Cas. I imagine they have to wear them to remain professional, but I don’t know why students can’t. I mean, seems like you’d just have a bunch of horny people fuckin’ all the time and pregnant chicks all over the place because of it.”
Jask reached down to stroke him, biting and sucking on the back of his neck. Ares flattened out against the counter for support and rocked back as Jask owned him completely. “Mine,” he said, teeth grazing down his spine.
Silence met his confession and Cas looked like he was actually struggling to process those words. After a moment to collect himself, Cas nodded. “Are you sure, Dean? I don’t want to seem like I’m undermining your decision or making it out to be something it’s not, but I want to make sure that this isn’t coming from a place of fear. If you want to fight for your career, I’ll stand beside you.”
“Thought you didn’t wanna talk about him?” Dean flipped them and straddled Jask’s waist. “Still gonna fuck me when I’m married?”
Dean laughed and offered an innocent gallic shrug. “It’s a very nice ass. What’s a filter again?” He winked and started on his boots, instantly regretting that he probably missed a beautiful blush by looking away.
Dean didn’t have to ask Cas how he slept the following morning, he knew he slept just as shitty as he did. “Mornin’, Cas. One of these days you should sleep in. I try not to wake you but here you are, bright eyed and bushy-tailed again.”
Dean’s impatience with people on his payroll — or people in general — ensured they didn’t have a driver, so Cole pulled the limo around and Cas loaded up the luggage. The longer he went without hearing from Sonny, or Dean’s handlers, the more suspicious Cas got that his job was about to become even more taxing.
“GiveittomeCasitsmine,” Dean mumbled, once again all as one word. Cas huffed a breathless laugh and released Dean’s spent cock to grip his hips. He held him still, fucking up into him hard until he was slamming inside to fill him up.
He set his phone on his bedside table and crawled into bed, sinking happily under his weighted blanket and slowly shutting off the rest of the world. Maybe he
“This ass is mine! Fuck, Dean!” Cas slammed inside with a growl, milking his cock inside Dean’s tight ass. He laid his forehead against Dean’s back, panting as he caught his breath. “I love you.”
“Nah, never heard of him. Try the garage over,” he says flippantly, trying to act like he isn’t about to piss himself — but he's pretty sure that's obvious.
Something tightens in Cas’ chest, and for a moment, he lets his frustration ebb away. “It wasn't really yours, Dean. You weren't allowed to say it, not even once. You were never allowed to explore it. I'm so, so sorry that you had to keep that secret for so long.” He brings the rough, callused hunter’s hand to his lips and kisses his knuckles. “But it can be whatever you want it to be now, Dean. We're free… free from your father, your brother… Chuck… and the powers controlling Chuck, too. No one can tell you who to be.”
Dean hastily stood, walking to the counter and shoving down his shorts. “Please, Cas... love it when you fucking own me.”
Cas didn’t hesitate, he crawled onto the bed and reached out for Dean. When his hand hit Dean’s shoulder, his skin felt like it was on fire and Cas’ chest tightened. He maneuvered himself behind Dean, not thinking it was probably extremely inappropriate, and wrapped his arms around him. “You’re okay. I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Before driving back, Dean decides to jack off. He can spread around the precome enough so he smells like sex, but edge himself for the awesome angry sex he’s about to have with Cas. Just the idea has him fully hard as he pulls himself out, and it doesn’t take much to have his head falling back with a moan and his hips bucking off the upholstery.
After one more bite, this time to Dean’s right asscheek, Cas stands and licks his lips. “And I'll remember
Before Cas even had a chance to answer him, Ares’ phone rang. He glanced at it, failing to fight the smile on his face. “It’s him.”
“Apple... and cherry.” After one more kiss, Dean steps back and looks down at his crotch. “Goddamnit... how am I supposed to explain this?!”
He takes Dean’s breakfast to him when it's ready and then sits down, giving Jask a look that he hopes says “go away.” When the brute doesn't move, Cas clears his throat quietly, but all Jask does is ask if he needs a glass of water. “No, Jask. I don't need water.” He sighs, rubbing his chin for a moment. “Would you mind stepping out so I can talk to Dean?”
It takes a few moments of breathing, but his cock is still rock hard as he tucks himself away and wipes off his hands. They’re still shaking as he starts the car and heads home — especially because he knows Cas is there.
Cas’ eyes roved over his body. “The good ones do, they won’t match you with someone you’re not compatible with.” He cleared his throat and looked toward the door. “Are you sure it wouldn’t be better to wait for Jaskier?”
“Just curious.” Ares’ fingers tap on his desk a moment and he bites the corner of his lip. “And why does green remind you of him?”
When they finally broke apart, Cas kept his eyes closed and licked his lips. “That wasn’t entirely what I expected to happen this morning, but not one part of me is complaining.”
anything, really, I saw you leave the locker room, looking like you just got laid — which was weird, seeing as your
Amara smiled, looking pleased with his answer. “He is pretty special under all that sass. Does he make you happy, Dean? Because I know you make him happy.”
“No. Never. I don’t know what he’s doing here, honestly... he probably doesn’t either. I just know he really wants you and he doesn’t know how to just ask someone on a date like a normal adult.” Jask takes another bite and chews quickly. “Not his fault. Never had a normal life, so...”
Grateful he’d already pulled bacon out for the following morning, he made Dean some scrambled cheesy eggs, bacon, and toast. He threw it all on a paper plate and grabbed a Gatorade, then made his way up to Dean’s room.
“Okay.” He thought about it the whole drive, and when they got there, he had an idea. “I know Jagger has a bunch of romcoms, let’s watch that
Jimmy frowned, crossing his arms on the table. “If he does, I can’t really say I blame him. Is it really that serious for
“Um, no, sweetheart. You didn’t.” Dean looked as though not being face to face was hard on him, too, and all he wanted was to reach out and hold him.
“If only. That Ikea table took you an entire day, and then you almost lit it on fire.” Dean laughed and went to grab the cheese from the fridge.
Dean takes his time, kissing along his entire length and keeping eye contact before he finally swallows Cas down, and he grips the sheets to keep from floating away. If he closes his eyes, it feels as though no time has passed — but he forces them open to watch, noting all the small changes in Dean and how hollowed out his cheeks get when he wants to shove Cas toward the edge.
Warmth spread through him and Cas saw endless possibilities for the future. One way or the other, they’d figure it out. He tilted his head to kiss the underside of Dean’s jaw and grinned. “I just have one question for you, Dean. Do you like lemonade?”
The growl he let out was hotter than hell. “I just fucked you an hour ago. Ready for me again already?” Jask spread his cheeks apart with one hand and shoved his middle finger in, pressing his body into the mattress. “I wonder how many times I can fill up your tight little ass before I finally let you come?”
Cas slid his hand up under Dean’s shirt and pressed his palm flat against his abs, holding him impossibly close. He breathed in Dean’s scent and nearly lost his mind, still not over the shock that Dean actually wanted him, too. Another handful of thrusts into that gorgeous, tight ass had Cas emptying with a grunt that echoed through the trees.
Dean grinned and bit the inside of his thigh as he nudged Cas’ legs further apart. “Fuck, Cas... I’ve wanted this ass for so long. Next time you can have mine.”
“If you mean their hormones... it takes some getting used to. Students in my gym class’ eyes change so much it gives me whiplash, and by the end of the day they’re all either angry or horny. What happened with your students? All the girls got pink eyes like you farted on their pillow?”
“Let him... c’mon, Daddy Cas.” Dean held the puppy up and pouted his bottom lip. “Pweeze let me fart in your bed.”
He squirted lube between Ares’ cheeks then gripped his wrists to hold him in place. “Tell me if I’m hurting you, okay? You said you wanted to feel it.” He bit his own lip and ran his fingers through the lube coating his crack, then nudged two of them in.
For the first time since Jask started high school, he looked miserable. Truly, ridiculously miserable. His shoulders slumped like all the air had been forced from his lungs.
“There’s nothing wrong with that, Ares. You don’t owe anybody anything, except yourself.” Jask didn’t want to push too far and come off seeming like an asshole, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d be able to make Ares happy in ways Castiel never could.
Saturday morning, Dean woke up while Cas was already brushing his teeth and washing his face. He felt overly groggy and considered staying in bed all day.
“Who, me?” Dean still had his contacts in, which was infuriating. “Yeah, couple... few times.” He smirked a little, glancing over. “Why do you ask, sweetheart?”
Dean rolls his eyes and wishes the pizza was there at least, but he pulls out his phone and goes to Cas’ Facebook again.
He smiled as he nodded, hoarding as much honey as he could fit in his arms. At a stern look from Ares, Cas blushed and put several of the jars back. “Yes, a new recipe sounds good. It’s been a while since we’ve done something spontaneous.”
Nothing could take away his smile after that, and once they ate, Jask followed him to the bedroom and pinned him down to the bed. Ares knew he'd never get enough of Jask and every single part of him was completely okay with that. “You’re too big to be this adorable. It isn’t fair.”
“Plug? Oh, baby.” Cas had to palm his instantly hard erection before he unbuckled his slacks. “You’re so perfect, Dean. Everything about you. Turn around, sweetheart. Let me see that gorgeous ass.”
He pushed his way through the crowd and caught sight of Dean, jerking his head subtly to the right. Relief flooded his body when Dean ducked to the side and headed toward the opposite exit, pulling his hood up and avoiding the hoard people still screaming questions at him with Jody on his heels.
“Yeah, I am. He won't touch you without your permission and he'll kick the living fuck out of anyone else that tries.” Jask lowers his voice. “Hell, if I wasn't otherwise taken and not all that into bottoming,
Dean came back a few moments later, walking over to Cas still in the kitchen. “You okay?” He leaned his hip against the counter and eyed Cas, reaching out for the beer.
By the time Cas let him know they were coming up, Dean was feeling pretty damn low about himself, and all he could hope was that it would be worth it.
“Remind me again why you’re here?” Cas asked, annoyed that the man seemed to shed more than the dog did.
“Do you think he found a girlfriend?” Hannah asked, leaning in toward Cas so no one else could hear. “No one wears turtlenecks because they like them, right?”
His brother grinned softly. “I sure didn’t. I don’t know how to tell her, though. I’m afraid she’ll just laugh at me to protect herself, you know how tough that shell is.”
Cas snorts as he wraps a hand around the rebar. “It's not nice to be rude to the people who sign your paychecks, Dean. But then again… your time with them is done. It's not like they can hurt you anymore.” Sucking in a breath, Cas turns the rebar into dust. “Not on my watch.”
His whimper was so needy Jask nearly caved right then but like the good boy he was, Ares began thrusting into his fist, desperately chasing his release.
Cas shrugged, watching Dean closely. “I met Arthur a long time ago. Maybe you should try online dating, unless there’s someone else you know personally that you want that type of relationship with.”
The rest of the flight was quiet, and landing was a bitch, but Cas always tried to hurry his shit up and get Dean off the jet as soon as possible. He took care of the bags and swapped off with the latest limo driver. The guy really
Ashton glanced behind them and nodded toward the side of the stage, then clicked his tongue and stood up. “Alright everyone, give it up for Ms. Olivia Mell and Mr. Michael Havoc!” He waited for the applause to die down enough to speak again. “Sorry, you guys are stuck with me now, but I promise I’ll be more fun than those two lovebirds.”
At the first sign that Dean was awake, Cas nipped at his thigh. “Be quiet, I can’t wait another moment.” A hand fisted in his messy hair as Cas dove in, sliding Dean’s boxers down and taking what was rightfully his. He sucked slowly, swirling his tongue around Dean’s cock until he felt it responding, then hummed in satisfaction.
The next morning, Dean was still dead to the world when Cas got ready to leave. He left some aspirin next to a coffee-filled travel mug with a note that said ‘Take me’, then snuck out as quietly as he could to go see his father.
“Good. We don't have a lot of time, so don't hold back. Let me know right before you're going to come.” He sucks Dean’s thick cock into his mouth and sucks greedily as he undoes his own jeans and frees his length, and it doesn't take much to get him hard.
didn't break into the damn house last night, but my guess is Sonny only put out the SOS to Ben cause he was closest. I'm pretty sure Cas was with his boyfriend." He opened the door for Dean and gestured inside. "I'll grab the bags."
Cas shifted in the seat and clenched his fists, releasing them slowly. Otherwise, that damn expression didn’t change. “His name is Arthur, and the only thing I’ll be catching from him or with him... is a break from
With a click of his tongue, Jask’s eyes darted down to Ares’ lips. “I like to think of myself as an equal opportunity sportsman. I’ll bat for any team that’ll have me… though, I do have a preference.”
Cas pulled his pajamas back up and searched for the plug, mercifully finding it quickly, then made his way back toward his car with his heart hammering in his ears. How
“Almost 10pm. I called before your nightmare kicked in. Kids are in bed but we’ll see them at breakfast. Ready to go in?”
Ares was already in just his panties, and the top of his cock was spilling out over the waistband. “Cover my mouth,” he whispered.
Cas dove in unapologetically, swallowing the man down as he quickly undid his own jeans to free himself.
Cas smiled genuinely and pulled Dean into a hug. “I know we barely know each other, but this is... by far the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me. I will help you in any way I can, and if you don’t mind living in Illinois for awhile... you’re more than welcome to come stay with me. I’m not quite sure how we’ll get you through Customs, though...”
They made their way off the stage, and Dean immediately pulled out his phone. He was distracted earlier and didn’t get to check on Havoc.
noise just to show P he was enjoying it, and then sucked him down again, setting a pace that would hopefully drive him crazy.
He smiled and stood up, walking over with his damn rebel swagger and sex hair. “You would? Would you give me after school specials?”
As adorable as that was, it screamed bad idea. “You need water and food. If I know Jask and Ares, they’re not coming back. Go upstairs and change into something more comfortable. I’ll bring you some food in a couple of minutes.”
“They’re not dumb. They’re damn gorgeous, just like the rest of you.” Jask’s breathing sped up and it looked like he was about to have a full blown panic attack, but Cas stayed where he was, not saying a word.
“Fine.” Dean waited until he knew Jask was hard before he reached back one hand, a grin on his face. “Need a hand?”
His pupils were blown and his skin was flushed as he tugged in Dean’s hair, trying to pull him closer. “I’ve spent the last three weeks fantasizing about this and now you’re going to tease me?” Cas gripped his own cock with his free hand and angled it toward Dean’s mouth.
The truth of it rings through his bones and he moves as much as he can without hurting either one of them, chasing both feelings. He comes with his alpha's name on his tongue and paints the table in front of him, even as the mix of come and slick starts to make him dizzy.
“Fuck, Ares,” Jask groaned, gripping the back of his neck with one hand while keeping the other on his hip. He pushed Ares’ shoulders to the mattress and squeezed the sides of his neck as he grunted, slamming into him so hard and perfectly that Ares was coming before he even knew what was happening. Jask cried out as his ass clenched around that thick cock, and a couple more brutal thrusts had a stream of hot come filling him up.
Dean got up and rolled his eyes as he walked to the door to yank it open. “Don’t you asshats have a key by now?”
“Do you want me to conjure them up? I'll need a sacrifice to get the spell to work, are you volunteering?” he deadpans.
He palmed himself and bit his lip, but his boner was instantly killed when Rowena entered his office. “Are you wankin’ in here, boy?” She smirked behind her hand.
“Course you did, sweetheart. I knew you would.” Dean kissed him fully as his friends came over to join. Jask, Ares, Jimmy, Abaddon, Nick, and Gabe were all there to cheer him on. Aunt Amara was standing behind Dean with a proud smile and tears in her eyes, but it was clear Dean wasn’t letting go of him anytime soon. “Y’know, when we get home… I’m gonna kiss you fifty-
“Oh, fuck...” Ares tossed his head back with a huge, gorgeous grin, spreading himself as told. He loved when Cas lowered his voice and he wished he’d do it more often.
“Yeah... I do. I just didn’t want you to think I abuse my power or anything and kinda freaked out. Sorry about that, I want this too. A lot.” Dean smiles as he thinks about that night, and how adorable Cas looked that hammered. “You asked me if I was an angel, but the second I saw your eyes I wanted to ask the same thing.”
Relieved they were getting to the point quickly, Cas sat down and gestured for them to do the same. Ares complied, but Jask’s stance was defensive. “Please have a seat, Mr. Morningstar. No one is in trouble here, provided you’re capable of having a conversation about it. I have no more interest in involving Ms. MacLeod than you do.”
“Okay. Pick a page.” Cas cast it open as Dean picked fifteen. He flipped open the book to the page Dean requested and scratched off the bottom date, reading out loud. “‘Buy a cheap apron and wear nothing but that as you bake a pie. Turn on the movie Twilight, and every time Edward looks uncomfortable, be the first to wipe filling on the other person’s face. How you choose to get it off is your business.’” Cas frowned, staring at it. “They ended with a winky face, which tells me how
“To be fair, I’d thought I was still working in the traditional sense. I can’t very well go vette your latest conquest in pajama pants.” He dreaded the thought of changing again after he just went through the trouble of putting his damn suit on, but he was tired of sleeping in them if he was being honest. “I’ll get there.”
“What are you lookin’ for? Normally we just clean the cuts with some vodka. I cleaned ‘em all last night. You should see his face.” Dean grins proudly and winks at Cas.
“Sounds like a good goal in life.” He took another drink and set it behind him. “So, how do I tell my best friend I want someone else without hurting him?”
Dean didn’t answer right away, not until the show was found and on pause. “Never know. Honestly being this big is always a threat to dudes, and they want to challenge the biggest guy in the room. I just don’t turn the other cheek well. My brother is bigger than me but if I’m there, I take care of it for him. He isn’t the fighting kind unless he has to.”
“I know. But… Aaron actually really helped me. He made me want to be stronger, and I wanna deserve to be his hero. I wanna stop hiding, Cas. I know right now isn’t safe, but I mean hiding in here.” He pointed to his head. “I’m ready.”
He jumps up as fast as possible, not wanting anyone to see him on the ground and dusts himself off. “When’d you become his bitch, Tiny?”
That was all the answer Cas needed to flick his tongue over Dean’s balls then suck him in, moving slowly and reveling in the feeling of Dean hardening in his mouth.
He really didn’t want to snap on Jody, but the anger in his chest had completely bubbled over. Dean turned away from her and punched a hole straight through the drywall.
“He was mine for longer than you can imagine,” he spits, picking Dean off the floor by his throat. There's sheer, unrelenting hatred in those eyes, and Dean knows he's done for — right up until he hears the best sound in the world.
He flicks his tongue over the shaft and sucks the tip in, turning challenging eyes up to Dean and not pulling off until Dean starts to move. "No, stay still. You don't get to come for me yet."
His mind was flooded with visions of bending this man over the hood of his Impala. Dean nearly had the restoration done, but who knew how long the painters would take.
He pulls back in surprise but huffs a laugh and just dives back in. He’s no stranger to weird, magical things, but he’s never had actual sex with anything but another human.
erection rubbing against Cas’ crotch as he kissed along his neck. “Need you, Cas. I already turned the stove off.”
Mother’s Milk comes to get him when his time’s up, cuffing him again. “Still firin’ on all cylinders, Winchester?”
“No... Cas.” Dean stumbled over his words, not sure of how to tell Cas that it was okay. He realized the best way was to show him so he moved the bag letting Cas see for himself that
I can’t even look at you most of the time without feelin’ like I’m gonna come right outta my body. I know I’m an idiot and I screwed things up a lot, but… it’s you, it’s always been you. It’s been… what, almost fifteen years now since we got together? I’m crazier about you now than I was that first day you bent me over the -” His eyes widened and he looked at Bobby, mouthing the word sorry before continuing. “Anyway, I’m still shit at words and I don’t know if I’ll ever get better, but I’m tryin’. And I’ll keep tryin’ every single day until you bury me. Ahh, c’mon, Cas. Don’t look at me like that, we both know I’m dyin’ first, it’s science. Anyway, point is… I love you. And I’ll marry you a hundred times if it keeps you around, cause I don’t ever wanna live without you again.” He stopped, but when no one else said a word, he gestured between them. “That’s it. That’s all I got.”
“Do you always do that? Kiss a cock when you’ve sucked someone’s soul from it? That kiss ruined me. You know that, don’t you? I think that was the moment I knew I would never be able to get enough of you.” Cas pulled Dean to him and kissed the taste of himself right out of Dean’s mouth, sliding a hand down to palm him.
“You really sell the place, buddy.” Dean laughs and shakes his head, tipping it back against the cold wall. “Guess we’ll see where I end up.”
“After. It’s Drake’s birthday that night. They’re having breakfast and celebrating early so she can meet us there before the show.” Jody closed up her laptop and stood.
“Ah! You’re right…. right… can’t go without that.” Dean realizes he lost that little argument and looks around for Jask to save him.
Those were probably Jask’s six favorite words. He shoved his fingers in deeper, tugging on Ares’ joined wrists to make his back arch. “I think I’m gonna take my time with you tonight. Make you come all over the counters before I even
He edged a few times, fighting back real life thoughts as he got closer and closer to the edge before his mind drifted to that damn livestream - that he watched three times since - and how pliant Cas was when he lifted him and laid him down on the couch. Dean’s hand sped up when he remembered Cas’ scent filling all of his senses and he had never been closer to kissing his best friend.
“Je pourrais mourir dans ce cul et être heureux!” He bites his lip and lets go of Dean's cock, grabbing both hips and pulling him flush as he grinds up, burying himself as deep as he can go.
That earns him a satisfied hum and a chuckle. "Clever. Will you come quietly this time, or would you prefer to fist fight someone else first?"
That perfect, tight ass clenched around him as Cas bowed his body. “Dean! I — I’m too close, please...”
When Rowena finally made her way to her office, Cas stood and followed her in. “Good morning, Rowena. Do you have a moment?”
“Alright, take care. Check in when you can, and if you want me to check in on the house and your boyfriend, I will.”
“Fuck... so good, Cas...” Castiel smiled at the sound of his own name, happy to know he was listening. “I’m... gonna come... ah, fuck, finally!” Dean bit down on Cas’ neck and slammed inside, filling him so much it leaked out.
That broad hand wraps around his cock again and Cas starts to stroke, just rolling his hips to stay buried deep and locking eyes with Dean. “You're incredible. Don't thank me. Just let me take care of you, you deserve it.”
do it. It’s something you sign up for online, so no television show. And it isn’t only for wives, but this is crazy.” Ares handed Cas the phone to see the Facebook ad, and Cas turned a skeptical gaze on it.
Dean shook his head, turning toward Cas. “No, no, not like that. I mean, it was definitely a time of fear, but that wasn’t what I meant. Even conscientious objectors need to serve. If their reasons for the classifications exempt them from active duty but not service altogether, there were still non-combat roles to be filled. Or, if someone
Saying goodbye to the only family he had was hard. Claire had definitely warmed up to him and wasn’t afraid to boss him around, Jesse thought he was fun to climb like a jungle gym, and he got to have a few nice talks with his brother. But it was time to go.
“Cause everything is a party for you, asshatt.” Dean sat up, hearing a noise. “Is that the shower? Ima see these fucking tattoos.” He sprinted towards the door and rushed towards Cas’ side of the house.
what Ares was talking about. “You think I can just wash that off in a shower? Ridiculous.” He slapped his ass again. “C’mon, sweets. I’ll race ya home.”
“I wasn’t good at it years ago.” Cas chuckled and let out a sharp breath, then sat up and winced. “We might have to raincheck me fucking you, though. I don’t think I’m going to be able to move tomorrow.”
Cas could feel Dean watching him while they sat in silence, and when they finished their drinks, Dean cleared his throat and nodded to the bathroom door. “Should I…?”
Cas eyed him with a rebuttal on his tongue, but stopped. Whatever he was going to say was going to be a lie, because he
Coming inside Dean felt too good for Cas to be embarrassed that he came so soon, even though it meant he was sliding out way before he wanted to be. Cas spun Dean around and shoved him against that tree before dropping to his knees, the leaves crunching under him. “Good, I wanted to taste you anyway.”
Jimmy pushed Cas’ water toward him and huffed a laugh. “You know, rendering you speechless is something I take pride in and it really isn’t fair that we’re having such a serious talk and I can’t make fun of you for it.”
“Nah, but if you’re gonna do it again, play with my nipples. Drives me crazy inna good way.” He winked, darting around Ares and stripped right there in the middle of the bedroom down to his briefs.
After he grinned, Ares flicked his tongue across his slit and moaned at the flavor. “This tongue?” He flicked it again, staring up into Jask’s eyes and he slid him inside his mouth for the first time.
Whether it was fortunate or not, they didn’t make it to the garden. Cas nearly begged for it right where they were — he knew getting dirty would mean showers, and Ares needed sleep, so he tried to make up for the change of plans by taking control.
“You can trust us. Hell, you have to... not much choice, there.” Cole stopped the limo on the tarmac and glanced back at Cas. “You riding with Princess or do you want cleanup duty?”
They devour the pizzas and Jask cleans up the mess, then comes over and flicks Dean in the forehead. It's not hard enough to hurt, but just enough to be annoying. “Earth to D, where you at?”
Ares kissed along his neck as he caught his breath, pouting slightly before pulling out. He definitely didn’t hate topping, especially with Cas.
“Thanks, Cas,” he mumbles, exhaustion finally tugging at him now that Cas is back. “Can I stay here?”
Cas shuddered and moaned, pulling his fingers out and using the rest of the lube to inch his way inside of Dean. He paused, fully seated, breathing heavily against the back of Dean’s neck. “We need to figure out a way to drive like this, your ass feels incredible.” He thrust once, barely pulling out before slamming into him hard enough to shove him against the tree.
“Yes.” Ares moved to take off his shirt with Jask’s help, shivering when his hands brushed his bare skin. “I want you to have all of me... fuck, I need all of you.”
Jimmy fake frowned. “Oh, what a shame, all the teachers will want to screw me.” Amara gave him a look and Jimmy clicked his tongue. “Sorry, Aunt. He makes me like this, I swear. Besides... I’m taken. Or... will be soon, hopefully.”
Cas opened his mouth to argue and then shut it quickly, clenching his jaw. “It’s in my pocket. We’ll add that to your end of the bet. If you win, I’ll put it in and show you my tattoos.”
“Probably half of them.” Cas laughed fondly, already wanting to see Dean’s smile as he ate pie. “I think we’re all set. Let’s go double knot the knot.”
“Yup. Yes. Now? Right now?” He pretended to grab his phone but stopped short, rolling on his back with flushed cheeks. “Man, I love you.”
“Silver!” Madison yelled excitedly. “Silver bullets kill werewolves, and a lot of other monsters, too.”
The water sloshed around them as Jask caged him from behind — one arm wrapped around his chest, and the other hand finding its prize between Ares’ legs.
Cas rolled toward him, wrapping his arm over Dean’s chest just to feel him breathing. It was clear he was fast asleep and wouldn’t be answering
In that moment, there was only one person who could make him feel better, and it was the person he was panicking over. After he took a few deep breaths in and out, he called Dean before he could chicken out.
“Yeah... I still wanna be friends though. I mean... Havoc kinda likes you.” Now he just felt like an asshole. “M’sorry.”
Cas turned slowly, letting Dean’s hand trail across his skin. The goosebumps under Dean’s fingertips were just a bonus. “Well? Are you satisfied?”
He watched their lengths slide together for a moment, then braced one hand behind him as he bucked up. Cas’ body was screaming for more - he wanted to pull Woody forward and kiss him breathless as they tipped over the edge, wanted to dig his nails into broad shoulders and spear himself on that gorgeous cock - there were so, so many things that Cas wanted.
Castiel palmed himself under his desk and forced his gaze away. He knew his eyes were pink, knew Winchester
A soft, surprised moan left P’s lips and his head thudded dully against the wall as Dean leaned in to kiss his neck. P ran his hands all over Dean’s shoulders and gripped tightly as he pressed forward, pinning him harder against the wall.
Cas rolled his eyes with a fond look and picked up a slice of pizza, wholly satisfied when the food settled the uneasiness in his gut. If he’d ever been more grateful for Dean, he didn’t know it.
“What's up, Doc?” Dean does a pretty awesome Bugs Bunny impression — if you ask him — and sits back as Jask slips from the room.
“Ah fu—” Dean doesn't have a chance to be startled this time, he feels too damn good — and when he comes, he thinks he might black out. It feels like his orgasm is never gonna end, and by the time it does, Cas’ stomach is covered.
with absolutely no complaints. Things with Jask were as easy as breathing, and knowing that Cas — hell, even Dean — was happy made all right in the world.
“He was obviously joking, I crawled up his ass for the next three years and we never spoke another word about marriage. Unless you count the fact that he called me his wife sometimes,” Cas laughs. “But… while we’re on the topic… how did you end up back here, anyway? You never said that night at Rocky’s.”
“Nice try. I don't really need you to do much of anything but bend over, so... bend over.” He pushes him down, then pops the button on Dean's jeans and exposes his ass. “I've had dreams about this ass, Winchester. Nightmares, really —” he splits open his cheeks and spits on his hole — “Hope you don't mind... forgot to pack the lube today. Oops.”
He did, but pulled back chuckling. “You sound like you’re insulting me with a very stereotyped Irish accent. Like the Lucky Charms leprechaun.”
Dean was putty instantly, letting out a soft hum against his lips. “He did, but then tried and failed to beat me up cause I threw my boxers in his trash.”
Cas snuggled against Dean as Jask grinned, having gotten exactly what he’d wanted. It made Cas smile — that was something he couldn’t ever give Ares, and was glad to see someone else was. He kissed the hollow of Dean’s throat and let out a sigh. “I’d have been here hours ago if you’d have called. Ares told me instantly what had gone on with him and Jask.”
Thankful he kept lube in his shower, he squirted a line over his length and fucked into his fist, biting the apron hard enough he could feel it dampening between his teeth.
by a demon, and his whole life after that is spent in constant pain and misery cause his dad became an obsessed bastard. Wouldn't it be easier to just think angels don't exist than to find out they really do, they just don't
“Yeah, sure.” Dean finishes his water then gets up and packs up their garbage, then dumps the tray. “Lead the way.”
Dean nodded, imagining them married and in open relationships sounded fucking taxing. He hated it now, he imagined he’d hate it even more then. “We don’t gotta... I can quit.”
“The what of Thursday? Angel? People are scared of an angel? Sounds ass backwards.” Dean chuckles at that. “Who am I to talk about ass backwards?”
“What? Pie? That doesn’t count, that’s dessert.” Jask argued and Dean could have sworn he heard Cas chuckle to himself, but when he glanced over, his face was as stoic as ever.
He nodded, snapping out of his thoughts. “He wasn’t the first and he won’t be the last. I don’t understand why Dean feels the need to keep putting himself in those situations. One of these days... someone’s going to end up getting more than just a couple of bruises.”
Blue eyes raked over Dean’s body and he let out a tiny, barely audible whine. “He’s an idiot.” He pocketed his phone and cleared his throat. “But yes, that’s what I was asking. I was curious.”
Dean slid up his boxers and then used the towel to dry his hair better as he walked back by his phone. “I got three houses to hit and then I’ll come home for lunch. Probably before noon, but it depends on how long it takes to fix the last house's gutter. Then I’ll hit the last two houses and be home. It’s hard to say an exact hour, some days are shorter than others. Want me to bring us dinner tonight so we don’t gotta cook?”
Jask stands up. “Whoa, whoa... wait a minute. You can't just stop, they'll never find each other again. Can you just see him one more time? Maybe toss him the number and tell him the truth or something?” He gives Ares puppy dog eyes, and Dean copies.
“Yeah,” he said, then took a drink. “Yeah, he’s worth it. Isn’t it obvious? Have you ever seen me like this?”
Ares chuckled. “If you don’t mind me on top of you, yes.” He knew it wouldn’t be the most comfortable thing, but they could definitely fit.
“Yeah, but I never wanted to hurt him, so I never said those words. We’re wondering what something like this might do for us. It will make or break us, and I don’t want to lose him as a friend. Do you think that’s even possible? To live with someone else, possibly have sex with them, yet remain friends?” Ares gravitated closer, seemingly unknowingly.
He reaches over and places a broad, cool hand on Dean’s arm. “You don't need commissary money anymore. Anything you need, you tell me. Anything currently in your fund will stay there, and you'll continue to get paid for your work detail. Whatever you have to your name when your sentence is done will be handed to you to help you start over.”
Jask gallic shrugged. “Pretty much. Neither one of us have looked back since. It was just... right, y’know?”
The things that happened in Cas’ chest were likely illegal. “I... are, um... Should we go home or just stay here?”
Knowing the only name he’d remember in that bunch was Dean’s, Cas nodded like he’d committed all of those to memory. “My name is Castiel, and thank you. Maybe I’ll join a little later.”
“Adorable.” He stared at the phone a moment longer with a lovestruck grin. “Damn, he’s so cute. You’re feedin’ him the good stuff, right? No people food.”
He sniggered and lightly scratched the side of Dean’s neck, then brought his hand down and tweaked Dean’s nipple. “Go to bed, you’re distracting me and I have a job to do.”
Knowing he would regret it when they had to walk out of there, Cas reached and gripped Dean’s short hair, pulling him back for a kiss as he shoved his cock back inside with one quick, rough thrust. “Why are you sore, Dean? Who’s cock splits you open?”
The smile on Cas’ face could’ve lit up a city as he watched Dean, now sure he’d made the right call. “He’s yours. Well, ours.” Havoc licked all over Dean’s face then snuggled against his neck, and Cas forced himself to turn around — it was too cute to even watch.
“No, not yet, anyway.” Cas ran his hands down Dean’s body and pulled him closer, staring down at the spaces where they were joined. His voice was way goddamn lower than necessary. “Tell me you want this, Dean. Tell me you want me.”
“You know we have to kiss them later, right?” Cas asked. “They’re both going to taste like ashtrays… and somehow, I still don’t think either of us will care.” He sighed as Ares agreed, and then poured himself a drink.
Dean was speechless as he approached Cas and reached out, running a finger down his toned, tatted chest. He nodded, knowing he probably looked like an idiot but he was too far gone to care.
“Holy fuu— Cas... that tongue ring. I c— I can feel it.” Dean shuddered, his knees nearly giving out.
Thursday nods, sliding his yogurt-covered spoon in his mouth upside down. “That's understandable. Most of the newcomers here take a few days to get used to how I run things, but if you have any questions or concerns… you can always come to me.”
He ran until his leg started to cramp and he cursed himself for not stretching first, but jogged back onto the porch and stayed outside for a moment longer to catch his breath. Cas wasn’t sure how long he’d been gone, but the last thing he wanted was to wake the entire house up because he was teetering on the edge of being out of shape.
“Hey. You must be Dean,” he says as he holds out a bandaged hand. “I'm Jask. Jask Morningstar. Guess we're cellmates.”
“Mmhm... it helps me open my mind. You can just watch me if you want.” The idea made him nervous, but in the best of ways.
He couldn’t leave without saying anything at all, but he also didn’t know what to say. In the end, he wrote a note and hoped those three little words would bring Dean comfort in the morning.
She smirked, flicking his ear. “You wanna share with the class what you were daydreaming about? I’m sure Luce here wants in on it.” Abaddon abruptly ducked out of the way of a swinging fist, the boy attached to it scowling.
“Cas!” Dean drops the box on the floor and walks over, pulling Cas into another kiss but this one is slower than the last and laced with love and affection.
He chuckled, shaking his head. “No. Prior to our pool game, that room and yours were the only two I hadn’t been in.” Cas shrugged one shoulder and brushed his thumb over the back of Dean’s hand. “I always assumed if you wanted me in there, you’d tell me.”
“Amazon.” Cas frowned and looked down at them, tugging on the fabric. “Is there something wrong with them?”
Dean sat back and held onto his legs absentmindedly. “People are crazy, man, especially when getting arrested.”
“I’m not goin’ anywhere.” Dean cuddles into the pillow and closes his eyes, hoping Cain is dead or at least back in his cell.
Being the party animal that he was, Cas turned on a prison documentary and drank until he couldn’t stand the taste anymore.
Cas leaned forward, dragging that damned tongue ring up the length of his dick as he added a second finger, scissoring slowly. He couldn’t fight the moan that escaped; everything Cas did was just
Cas swore loudly and then came downstairs, his hair sticking up in the back. “I can’t get it to lie flat. Whatever, deal with it.” He took the stairs quickly and lightly touched Dean’s side as he passed him. “It’s hard picking a shirt that is nice enough for an actual date but disposable enough that I don’t care if I drop eight pounds of burrito on it.”
“You the school shrink now, too?” Dean smirked a little, then pulled his bottom lip between his teeth as Ares wrapped his hand. “Just, uh… have a crush on someone that doesn’t feel the same. Gripped my ‘Best Teacher’ mug a little too tight thinkin’ about it, that’s all. I’ll be more careful.”
“I like blue eyes. Maybe I’ll try and get on his good side instead.” He sits back with a groan and leans his head back. “That shit doesn’t work either, though. Nothin’ works in prison. It’s just friggin purgatory.”
Cas didn’t answer for several seconds as he ran his fingers along Dean’s prostate. “Yes... come, sweetheart.” He bit down on Dean’s shoulder and continued stroking. Cas could tell he teetered on the edge for as long as he could but when he clamped down harder, he instantly painted those bricks white and they watched the evidence wash away in the rain.
Dean shook his head a little, then went over to his desk and pulled a hoodie out from his bottom drawer. He came back and handed it to Cas, blushing and scratching the back of his head. “I have an actual jacket in my car you can borrow, but I won’t have a chance to go grab it until lunch. Hopefully that’ll work for now?”
Sorry it’s late this week. I was actually on social media today and Cettia’s Dawn came out so we all know I have to read that again. Okay, back to my hole. Enjoy!
Slowly, Dean pulled out his contacts and looked over at Cas. He could see the yellow tint covering his eyes turning to gold, and smiled like an idiot at him. “Yeah. He makes me happy.”
The numbness Dean was feeling started to wear off about two hours in. He had hoped the first emotion he felt would be relief or happiness... definitely not panic.
“Gonna have to try harder than tha—” Cas cut Dean off mid-sentence by clamping a hand over his mouth and flattening out on top of him until he could feel Dean’s hard cock between them.
Dean’s entire body shuddered and he moaned low, fingers splayed across the outside of the stall wall. “All yours, Officer. Always.”
He’d truly never been happier. When he made his way downstairs, Cas was sitting at the table with a cup of joe under his nose, staring intently at the Pathokinesis book as if it might burst into flames.
Dean growled in response. “One of these days you’re gonna let me prep you, but I’m so fucking happy you said that.” He pulled Cas towards the garage eagerly. “I don’t know how I’m going to ever keep my hands off you.”
“It can't,” he says quietly, then gently repositions Dean so his legs are together. “But unless you have something that can, we have to improvise this time. Do you trust me?”
His hips rolled and he braced his hands on Jask’s knees, staying close enough to feel Jask’s knuckles furiously brushing against the fabric of his panties. “Fuck... I want this beautiful cock so bad.”
“Nothin’ like some burgers on a hot summer day. I’m glad we chose the townhouse with a damn patio.” Dean stood in the doorway watching his best friend stare at his laptop so intently it looked like he was reading another language.
His hand moves faster as Dean gags around him, and before he knows what's happening, he's rolling over and bracing himself on one hand as he fucks into his fist, letting the tip of his cock drag along the pillow below him.
“Probably getting drunk or doing push-ups. I don’t know, they get weird when they’re together.” He laughed and got comfy on the couch after they ate. “How is the project going?”
“He isn’t. And he never would have stepped foot in this place. He doesn’t trust vegans.” Ares looked up to greet the hostess and take the menu.
Gripping both of Ares’ hips, Jask let go, no longer caring how much noise they made. “Fuck, I can't” — his movements became erratic — “gonna” — with a strangled, choked off moan, he filled Ares up for a second time. It felt so good he was lightheaded almost instantly, digging his fingers into perfect skin and completely forgetting where they even were.
“Good...” Ares gasped when Jask kissed down his neck and he laid there with a stupid, lovestruck grin.
"I assure you," Cas says before he can stop himself, "He's not getting flabby. And now, I'm going to make sure to bring them to
Dean rolls his eyes and shoves him playfully. “Put him in a headlock again and I’ll have to take you out, buddy. That was your free Jask pass.”
Woody gripped the bottom of the partition, and Cas could see his rough, white knuckles. His hands looked so strong, he couldn’t help but fantasize about them gripping his hips while he fucked into him - which only had him pulsing in his own hand.
“He was, but I don’t think he was nearly as effective as he thought he was.” Cas put some more food on his plate and came over, sitting next to Kate. “Dean isn’t exactly a mastermind when it comes to pranks.” He winked at Dean and took a bite, making a tiny noise of appreciation. “This is delicious, Kate. I haven’t had a home-cooked meal in a very long time, unless you count diner food.”
“Dean…” Cas pulls him into another messy kiss and strokes them both, his hips rolling as they slide together.
“I see you, Dean,” Victor growls out. “Yeah, I had a feeling you'd like this, getting stuffed with your own come and fucked like a whore. Surprised I didn't get you on that too, honestly.” He changes the angle, hitting Dean's sweet spot over and over again. “Gonna come for me again, pretty boy?”
When he comes back out, Cas’ Uncle Chuck is walking in with some chick Dean’s never met, so he goes over to greet them both, holding out a hand for Chuck.
Cas sighed, not wanting to make it worse but wishing he could explain to Dean the full truth of what happened. “Right. Dean… I would have never done that to you.”
“While I am definitely interested in hearing more about you being taken, you were right the first time. Dean is here because Castiel hoped he’d be able to convince me to let him homeschool.”
“Goddammit... Cas... please. C’mon...” Dean didn’t give a fuck if he sounded needy, because he was. “Please.” He gripped his own cock and started stroking again.
“Let’s go home. I know you don’t sleep good without your favorite pillow.” Dean kissed his temple and grabbed the things from his hands.
“I know. Thanks, Cas.” Dean kissed his lips softly. “I’ve honestly never wanted anything more. I know it’s only been like less than a day, but I already feel happy here. This was always my happy place and now I get to be here with you.”
He chuckled, pulling his arm back and setting the razor down. “I’m confused, are you trying to see my tattoos or my penis?”
A few seconds later, a long, thick shaft was sliding through the hole and the man took a deep, nervous breath.
The door swings shut once more as Butcher checks out his knuckles with a satisfied hum, then fixes his eyes on Dean’s ass. “Didn’t even break the skin.”
Cas wasn’t one to believe in fate. The universe and her strange ministrations, maybe, but not fate. Ares’ beliefs didn’t differ much in that department, so while a normal couple might’ve taken their lack of willingness to take that next step as a sign from above to go separate ways, they both assumed that eventually, the other would give in.
Dean shoves the rest of his tray away and stands up, instantly swinging on him and busting his nose. The toast falls to the ground and Dean nearly grabs it to shove down the dude’s throat, but he doesn’t want to turn his back for a second.
Dean did a little dance with his mouth open. “We shoulda been doing this a long time ago, Cas... but at least we’re here now.”
A moment later, his inner desire to throttle Dean sends him straight to a bridge, and he extends his wings wide as the car that was treated better than he was in life approaches.
Dean cried out and huffed a throaty laugh. “Fuck, Cas. I’d let you fuck me anywhere.” He planted his feet and pushed back, and Cas drove himself deeper.
“This was a stupid idea,” Jask said quickly, turning to face Dean. “Can we hit the undo button?” The truth was, he didn’t really know what he needed, or if he even meant that. He hated new situations and getting to know new people, which was one of the things that made him so incredibly, stupidly happy with Dean. He might not have been in love, but he was content and comfortable and knew he had it better than most. Not to mention, Dean was outright the best friend he’d ever had. Spending a month away from him sounded like fun at the beginning, but now that he was actually here… he was scared. “I hate new shit.”
“Dean! C’mere, boy.” Bobby pulls him into a hug and claps his back, laughing as he pulls back. “Ain't you a sight for sore eyes?”
Cas nodded a little with a small smile, wondering if that meant things between them were changing for the better, or if it was simply the beginning of the end.
“Go ahead... I’ll be right here getting off.” Ares reached inside his briefs and gripped his length, sliding his hand up and down before Jask even had the opportunity to walk away.
Jask shifted a little, and it was his turn to squirm a little bit. He wanted that more than he’d admit out loud. “Knowing D the way I do… Cas is struggling. No way he’s around Dean like it’s no big deal.” He licked his lip, scooting a little closer. “Do you want me to… hug you? Hold you?”
“I’ll give him a call on Sunday. If he’s working at the bank, he should be home then.” He reached over and brushed his fingers over the back of Jagger’s hand, shivering at how cold it was. “Tell me how I can help, Dad. Please. I know he doesn’t come see you as often as he should, and I’ll never believe they’re taking adequate care of you in here.”
Cas doesn't move an inch. “Oh, excuse me for not asking the angry cosmic entity to give me a few minutes,” he growls. “You've been emotionally constipated your entire life, how was I supposed to know you'd suddenly learned how to use your words?”
“You're not,” he says softly. “I won't. I'd like to keep working at the prison to help the others, and a big reason why I got you out was so you could keep hunting. This is what you're supposed to do, Dean. But I don't think it should be the
His mood was instantly better once he was in Jask’s arms, and when they kissed, most of his doubt disappeared. “Maybe I’ll go... or maybe I’ll show up in panties and a plug and get you fired.”
Dean above him, eyes closed, cheeks flushed from arousal... it’s the most beautiful thing Cas has ever seen and when those gorgeous greens meet his gaze, Dean smiles and moves to kiss and suck along Cas’ neck.
Cas raised an eyebrow and pulled his hand back, moving it back to Dean’s length. The lube was noisy, and allowed him to simply squeeze and let physics do the rest. “I put up with your brattiness the last couple of times because I’d wanted you so long I couldn’t help it. Now…” He pressed his thumb into Dean’s slit and flashed a small smirk. “You’ll ask nicely, or I’ll simply get back on the road.”
You know you’d never find an ass like mine, right?” Turning back to the TV, Dean checked out the guy's ass and gallic shrugged. “That
He stayed there, nose pressed against cold metal with the stranger’s cock shoved down his throat, and he heard a guttural growl as the man pulled away with a moan then jerked forward again.
When Kato returns hours later, Dean rushes home as quickly as he can. He wasn’t smooth about it, and he’s sure he’ll have a million questions to answer later that evening, but for now he sits in his kitchen and stares down his own bottle of whiskey. Ben is still sleeping, and he’s thankful for the quiet as he contemplates drinking the whole bottle. “Whatever,
“Definitely.” Dean climbed on top of him and kissed down his neck. “I don’t think I could have slept without you, Cas.” They settled together perfectly and for the first time, their cuddles weren’t wracked with guilt. Part of Dean hoped they’d wake and those two downstairs would already be gone. Their mornings were always laced with passion, and now that he had permission… Dean wouldn’t be holding back.
They pulled into the hotel’s parking lot and Cas got out, opening the back door. He handed the man a condom without a word and led him up to the room, pausing just outside the door and nodding to Cole, who had been standing guard. Cole got a good look at the man with Cas and turned on his heel to go wait by the car. “This is your last chance to ask questions or back out if you don’t think you can comply with the terms.”
He dropped the hammer he was using on his foot, and realized he had zoned out in the middle of work.
“Love is generally - though not explicitly - defined as having three core elements. Intimacy, commitment, and passion.” Professor Ketch leaned forward on his desk and eyed the room, and Cas took a deep breath.
“That’s good. I didn’t think he would, you got some great Yelp reviews.” Dean slid his palm into J’s shorts playfully and squeezed his bare ass. “Gonna miss this ass too, I need to talk to him alone, don’t listen.” He kneeled down and kissed each cheek and started his goodbye. “You’re not allowed to be with anyone else. J junior and J can... but not you. Ima miss you so much it hurts, I’ll think of you every time I get off.”
“So… give me your number, go solve the mystery… and call me when you're done. I'd very much like to see what happens next,” Cas says with a blush. “Is that okay?”
“I was actually in t— well, one and a half, but those are conversations for a different day. All that matters is that we did it. We found our way back to each other, and I'm firmly okay with kidnapping you to keep you here.”
Part of him wanted to discuss it — but it was selfish, he just wanted to hear Dean say that even on day one, he hadn’t wanted to sleep without him. That would’ve been unfair, so Cas shook his head. “We don’t have to talk about it. I’m glad you never offered it to me, and that’s all that matters.” He kissed Dean softly, certain he’d never get enough. “We should kick them out early tomorrow.”
“Dumb. Course I wanted you in there. In my bed. Naked.” Dean grinned and started looking around the car. “Car is nice, Cas. Did you buy this?”
"I want it, baby. Fuckin' need it. Fill me up and pull my hair... please." His gorgeous skin trembles under Cas' fingers and Cas can't hold back — he grabs a fistful of Dean’s hair and yanks his head back, his teeth threatening to close on his neck as he empties into that tight, hot ass.
Dean opens his mouth — surely to argue — but he closes it with a snap and walks over to lay his head on Cas’ shoulder.
Not Woody, not someone else. Dean. The one that had been right in front of him for years, but just out of reach. He laughed, relieved and sated, kissing Dean with all the hope for things to come that he could muster.
The choked off whimper Ares released sounded like it came from another person. The experience was nearly out of body, and he wasn’t going to last long regardless. Happy Jask told him he could, he angled his cock and called out his name, coming hard all over his torso and chest.
He looked back at the group just as Jask opened up the box, and Matt caught the paper that floated out. “Okay, here we go.”
Cas pulls back just enough to use Dean’s come to jack himself off, letting the tip of his cock rub against his ass each time. “You're beautiful, Dean. Beautiful and —
“Nah, just asked how his day was. You gonna let me in?” She blocked the doorway for a few moments more before turning and making her way toward her desk.
“Yeah? We might have to.” His mind went instantly to the gutter, but he realized that wasn’t fair so he pushed the thoughts away. “Can you hand me a tape? Doesn’t matter which.”
Thankfully, Jo spotted him pretty quickly and came running over, throwing her arms over his shoulders and hugging him. “It’s about time.”
“Why’d you really come here? Be honest. When I told you I wanted you to move back in, you basically told me to fuck off.”
But again, Dean barely glanced at him, and the one time Cas actually tried to engage, Dean shut him down. They ended up having another one of those interactive learning sessions and when it was done, Dean sat at his desk and didn’t pay a bit of attention to Cas
He laughs, cold and low. “Murder. Identity theft, credit card fraud. Grave desecration. What's that last one about, anyway? Seems like a lotta work to dig up a grave just to get your rocks off on some old lady bones.”
Cas must have liked what he saw, because his thrusts became erratic and he slammed deep inside, filling Dean up with the hottest sounding grunt Dean had ever heard. They laid there as long as they could, breathing together as their orgasmic bliss slowly faded away and his ass kicked Cas’ spent cock out of his body.
The officer sighed and radioed his partner outside, then stepped forward as Cole let Dean up. “Is that a yes or no on the charges?”
Cas instantly began fucking him relentlessly as he chased his own release, not wanting that damn person to call the
Cas smiled softly at his phone and tried not to think too much about how the nickname and goodnight text made his stomach flip like a teenager.
happened, so…” Dean meets his eyes and sees he believes what he says, so he doesn’t push it. “Well... you wanna ask me something, or should I just keep asking you questions?”
That earned him a playful eye roll and a gentle shove to the shoulder. “Did you see Jaskier and Ares?”
Cas watched Dean from across the cul-de-sac with a soft smile. This was their first year attending the block party together and while he couldn't be happier, he also couldn't wait for it to be over. Going five hours without being able to touch Dean was a little too much for him.
nothing he couldn’t have… except for the freedom to be who he really was. So, when Ashton had called him out about the night when Dean snuck in, Cas was at an impasse. He could’ve lied, found a way to explain the sounds… but something about Ashton’s demeanor behind closed doors — the decent human he’d proven himself to be, not the asshole he showed the public — told him he’d find an ally in him, not an enemy. Even still, Cas hadn’t made a secret of what he’d do to Ashton if he attempted to use the information to harm Dean in any way.
Content to just listen, Cas mouths the words instead of singing along: “You had me dead to rights, holding down my chain. You had me dead to rights, I got out again… never been the same.”
Dean’s eyes widen at his size, but he stands straighter and looks around for a guard. His stomach sinks when the only one present slips from the showers without a word.
The room was a decent size and the bathroom was right across the hall. Adam didn’t hover too long, and after Cas checked and double checked every nook and cranny, he finally came back into their room to relax.
The world slowed to a stop around him. He could vaguely hear Jody standing up for him, and Cole actually laughing now, but it sounded like he was underwater and the voices were coming from somewhere above him, somewhere where other people weren’t drowning. “This is a mistake. I’m capable of remaining professional, there is no one that will protect him like I will.”
Dean kisses him again, pulling him in for a tight hug that speaks volumes, nuzzling into his neck. “Yeah... where?”
Ashton gave them a thumbs up and then raced onto the stage, yelling loudly and trying to draw the attention to himself as they made their escape, and Cas had a fleeting thought that he might actually miss him.
could feel it, and he shouldn’t have been surprised when she brought him a Jamba Juice and some donuts. It was a small solidarity offering, and it helped… for a bit.
He swipes up some of the mess from his thigh and stands, holding his finger to Dean’s mouth. “Show me how you would've sucked me.”
The words seem disjointed from reality but Cas eats them up, fucking into Dean faster until he's nearing the edge. “Tell me you want it,” he gasps out.
Cas nodded quickly, stepping back with blown pupils and sweat beading on the small of his back. “Of course… if I ever get one when you’re free at the same time.”
Cas avoided Charlie like the plague over the next couple of days. The last date with Dean had been draining in ways he hadn’t expected - and brought up a lot of confusing emotions. He chalked most of it up to being at his dad’s house while he was stuck in some facility trying to recover, and the fact that he and Dean rarely used their words like that.
“Things are good. Thinking about getting a dog. We’ve talked about it for a while, but my birthday is coming up and I want a damn dog.”
She looked skeptical for a moment but seemed to realize that was what he needed, and she’d never let him down before.
“Hah!” Jask said, triumphantly. “We were wondering what your shrug meant… I don’t think I should say what I thought it was.” He looked a little sheepish suddenly, and cleared his throat. “Sorry, though. If you were mine, I’d… well fuck, I probably should say that, either.”
“Lucky Charms?” Dean asks excitedly as he walks to the cupboard, grinning when he pulls out a brand new box. “Is this for me?” He hugs it to his chest.
Cas looked up at her with a small smile. “It’s a really nice dress, at least. You do have a little spaghetti on it, though." She kicked him again, more playfully this time and then cleaned her shirt.
Somewhere in his mind, Cas knew what that meant. “We dismissed the thought pretty quickly when we spoke of it to begin with. Did you want to discuss it further?”
“You're welcome to feed me anytime, then,” Cas says quietly, but his drunken state ensures he doesn't know when to shut up. “Any kind of meat you'd like.”
Suddenly, Cas wanted to call off the entire thing. “Ares... if they go anywhere near my gloriosa superba, I’ll kill them.”
tight and Dean didn’t want to hurt him. He pulled out a small bottle of his own and squirted it on his cock, elated not to have to use a condom. He lined up behind P and tapped their code against his arm, giving him one last chance to back out but praying he wouldn’t.
He instantly missed feeling Jask’s length against his, and he already regretted the damn lines he drew. But deep down, he knew it was best.
wasn’t even out, the only two souls in the entire district that knew he was gay were Rowena, and now Ares. It wasn’t fear that had stopped him, but even still. He worried for Ares as he worried for anyone in his situation, but particularly because he didn’t think Jaskier Morningstar was anywhere near ready to come out. The potential for disaster was high, but at least Ares now knew he had somewhere to turn.
“Ah, shit.” Dean set the pie down and closed the door behind Cas, then pulled him into a hug. “I’m sorry, Cas. That was a rough part for all of us.”
Cas rolled his eyes, but remembered he’d been in Dean’s position not that long ago and didn’t have room to judge. “You had better not be hungover for our date tomorrow.”
He had no clue where Cas was, but the thought of him trying to fuck Jask bothered him. He didn’t even know if he had the right to be pissed, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t, and he sure didn’t need to take it out on the poor apple pie.
Cas glanced down at the blue vest and then back up at Dean. “Thank you, Dean. What brings you to the office?”
Smirking, she wrapped her lips around her drink. “Can’t it be both? Takes more to satisfy a girl than a quick fuck, you of all people should know that, Castiel.”
Dean rutted into the air, his crotch brushing Cas’ chin. “Fuck... sorry about that.” He ran his hand through Cas’ hair and sighed. “I used to imagine you pushing me back on the couch and fucking taking it. Tellin’ me I don’t even know what a blowjob really was — ”
“We can argue all day, but those asshats are all nerds… especially your boyfriend.” Dean ruffled her hair, earning himself a slap. She knew better than to argue, though; Sam read a new book every week.
Havoc jumped out of Jask’s arms and scrambled to Dean faster than his legs could carry his little fat body, and he fell forward more than once in his struggle. Jask stood as well, smiling widely and making his way over as Havoc jumped up, trying to lick Dean’s face.
He managed to remove his hand and sit up, yawning and stretching. It was still very early, and Cas obviously didn’t have anywhere to be, but he wanted to ask Dean something before he left. When he finally came back out, he was wet and wearing nothing but a towel… which sent the question on Dean’s mind somewhere far, far away. “Fuck.”
She rifled through the files on her desk until she found the couple they were paired with, then clicked her tongue. “Sorry, looks like they’ve checked ‘no’ on the box about infidelity, so if you’re just looking to get laid… there’s no point in switching partners. But if you’re still interested, yeah. Their email address should be in the welcome packet we sent over.”
Dean knew it would take a lot of planning, but he was excited. “Hell yeah, we do. Where’s our Scooby?” He whistled for Havoc and reached down to pick him up. “Let’s do this, Daphne.”
The omega's breathing is damn near ragged as he watches, and he actually does stop Dean before he lays down to take a picture of the front of him. “I… Dean, I don't have words. You're insanely beautiful. I've never seen anything like it.” He pulls him into a kiss and then lays him down, going to retrieve the new restraints. These ones have actual fucking anchors on them, and once they're secured, Dean knows they'll hold. There won't be any breaking out this time.
That is, until Charlie yells at him before he’s out of earshot: “Stay away from the damn bakery, Dean! You better interrogate some people!”
Cole grunts. “And now you know why I spend all my time here. I'm in for at least 25, but I'd rather spend it in here than out there.”
Desperate to focus on something other than what was happening on stage, he pulled out his phone. Now that the days of Dean online dating were over, Cas was curious about what kind of a profile he’d made that attracted such different calibers of people. He bit his lip, knowing he shouldn’t look… but what was the harm, really? It was innocent, and it wasn’t as though he was going to message Dean or anything. He doubted he’d even be able to find the profile since he’d made it anonymously, but at least the hunt for it would keep his mind occupied.
It felt incredible, but the sight was almost even better. Dean looked like a vision on his knees with his cheeks hollowed out around him — around
Dean’s mouth gravitates toward the bite like a magnet and he latches on again, the sting making Cas flinch. His alpha fucks up into him until he comes with a muffled groan, milking himself deep inside Cas.
let my common sense dictate what happens here, and common sense says I will always be on duty when it comes to keeping you safe. Go to bed.”
Cas didn’t catch one word of the lesson as he watched Dean move about the room. Every single thing he did turned him on.
“Fuck yeah... love when you cover me in your jizz... so fuc—“ Dean slammed up into him hard, growling as he filled Jask’s tight, abused hole. He laid his head back with a sigh, licking his lips breathlessly. “All of you is perfect, J... inside and out.”
“Come here. Maybe this will help me recognize you.” He spins Jenny around and palms her face, then smites her with a satisfied hum. The last of the mimes shoves Dean and he heads dangerously close to the rebar, but is able to spin out of the way ungracefully.
It was dark out, so Cas’ eyes didn’t have to adjust much and he realized exactly where they were, except there were candles surrounding them in the parking lot of the truck stop where they met.
Jask’s lumbering body came through the door. “You two are lucky this isn’t a real wedding. I’d have separated you already,” he teased. “C’mon, though. D needs to get into his tux.”
“I don’t think so.” Cas bit his lip for a moment. “I think we have everything else we need over there, the projector, movies… blankets. I think we’re good, especially because most of this is superfluous, anyway.”
“Are we done yet?” His voice was thick with arousal, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Absolutely every time Dean touched him felt like electricity in his veins, and he needed…
“You’re twenty-nine, asshat. Not that far behind. But I wonder if these people can have sex.” Dean clicked the link to read reviews. “Holy shit, people actually do this. Look, this chick said it changed her marriage for the better and helped them appreciate shit.”
“Well, you caught me off guard. I wasn’t expecting you to show up… but here, I doubt I’d have worn them anyway.” Dean stepped into the shower, tilting his head so the water hit his neck and ran down his chest. “I’ve always wanted you, Cas.”
Ares walked around Jask, rolling his eyes. “Have I told you how hilarious your boyfriend is, Castiel?” He walked up and pulled Charlie into a hug.
He set him down slowly and lifted up his shirt to take it off, then removed his own, pressing their bare chests together for the first time.
He laughs his ass off when The Trickster points out the Cas tree topper, but it's hard to look away from the huge smile on the real Cas’ face.
Not one part of Cas believed him, but that was simply because he’d spent enough years with him to know the things that would make Dean uncomfortable on a fundamental level. The motel they’d chosen wasn’t horrible; it had basic amenities and was cleaner than Cas could’ve hoped for, but it was… small. Cramped, even, and one of the reasons Dean had chosen the house he had was because it was so spacious.
to prove it. I had a feeling you weren't going to believe me. Bobby told me as much.” He continues pulling off his shirt and Dean gets his first look at the tattoos covering his body, but he's too worried about what's gonna happen next to focus on them. “Dean,” Cas says quietly. “I have wings. Please… you can leave if you want, just please don't scream.”
hunters — and the urge to get close to them has always been dangerous. Most hunters don't believe in angels, and even the ones that do are terrified of them. It would never work.
Cas shivered in his arms. “No, no. I can promise you, that was better than anything Ares and I had ever done.”
Ares huffed a deep laugh as someone started banging on the door. “Excuse me. Is everything okay in there, sir?”
Cas rolls his eyes, but straightens his back and washes his hands quickly before donning new gloves. The Winchesters own the half of the town that people like Cas don't associate with — the gun ranges, sporting goods stores, bait shops. They went from backwoods hunters to new money in just a couple of years thanks to a rise in crime and climate change extending the warmer seasons.
Ares looked like he hoped someone else would start the conversation but when no one did he cleared his throat. “Okay, well... we all are happier this way, right? So... what happens in two weeks? Is everyone on board with making this... permanent?” He blushed, naturally moving closer to Jask for comfort.
When he finally pulls himself out of his memories, he's standing in front of his door with his hand on the knob. He's had his moment now, had his chance to dive in and lose himself in the fantasy — but the moment that door opens, it'll be lost.
The scent hits him like a freight train, causing him to instantly drop his hammer. He basks in it for a moment — eyes closed, nose in the air, cock twitching in his jeans — and before he realizes what’s happening, his feet begin to move toward that delicious, sweet smell… one word repeating over and over in his mind:
“That's not funny, Dean. You're lucky our son loved me enough to get me out.” He slides in unceremoniously, but the sudden squeeze around his length has him completely forgetting what he was trying to say.
Not surprisingly, Cas lubes up and sinks in with a mix of awe and irritation. “Stop talking, you're going to ruin it for me.” He rolls his hips to sink deeper and rests his head on the back of Dean’s shoulder, glad Dean can't see just how much Cas loves this.
Cas blinks. “No, not exactly. I just… need to be honest with you, and I wanted you to understand that I know who you are, and I'm not afraid. I'm hoping you'll feel the same."
"See now you're just trying to get in my pants." Ares laughed at his joke and turned off the water. "Fine, but if they're still there after my shower I'll end up doing them. Dishes in the sink is a pet peeve."
For the first couple hours, they really do work. Part of the exterior of the prison needed painted and the small, pathetic-looking garden needed dug up and replanted. When they finish with that, Ishim wipes dirt from his brow and points his small, dull rake at Dean's chest. “Shed. Now. You and I have other business to attend to.”
Ares turned his head so he could stare up at Jask, still clinging tightly to him. “Does this feel right for you, too?”
“It was the bloodiest day in naval history until World War II. The morning of the second day, the USS Monitor arrived complete with a sleep-deprived crew. Lieutenant John Worden pulled up to a stranded, scared, exhausted USS Minnesota. You wanna know what he said? ‘I will stand by you to the last if I can help you.’ How many of you would’ve done the same? Not
“Incredible.” He pulled Dean down to his chest and stayed inside him, brushing his fingers over Dean’s back with a sated smile.
He sighed, draining his beer and setting the bottle on the table next to Jask’s foot. “I know, I know. Guess I’m just a little nervous they won’t respect me since I’m young, y’know? At least you started college late, you’ve got a decade on the seniors. I’m only five years older than most of them. I know
Somehow, they made it back to the car without further incident and Jody said her goodbyes before they started the drive back home, though Cas’ mood was shot.
His breathing slowly evens and he turns his attention back on his omega, rolling his hips as an answer. “Want you to face me, omega.” Dean leans back and moves so Cas can maneuver himself to the side. “Hope you’re bendy.” He lifts Cas’ leg up and turns him, grunting when Cas’ hole tugs hard on his knot — but he smiles when they face each other for the first time.
Flopping over onto his ass, Jask took the compromise. His eyes locked onto Ares with curiosity more than anything, which relaxed him. “I could watch you do this all day. You’re very bendy.”
Apparently, Jask felt the same. “Oh, yeah, Cas? I can draw you a map of them, if ya’d like.” He winked, and Cas glanced up toward the ceiling like he’d had about enough of Jaskier’s shit.
“Don’t you dare.” Dean started her up and went to the Taco Bell closest to the theater. They ate way too much, and by the time they walked down to the bar, they were almost too full to have a drink. “Can’t eat like I used to.” He rubbed his belly, acting like he didn’t just eat five burritos all to himself.
He grinned and huffed a laugh as he finished chewing. “There’s always food in this kitchen. It’s awesome. Feel better?” He pointed at Cas’ sweaty clothes.
“It’s a damn shame too, that car is beautiful. She deserves some more love, babe.” Dean kissed his pout away and then laid back on the bed, his arm behind his head. “You ready for this?”
Licking his lip, he opened the second email and set the phone down so they could both read it. By some weird twist of fate, Dean and Jaskier were
Gabe grins like he just proved a point. “We can handle things around here. Go, sow your wild oats, whatever the kids are saying these days.”
“Ca—” Dean facepalms and then busts out laughing, looking down at Miracle. “Did you hear your new daddy? Friggin’ angels man. Just... c’mon.”
“Don’t fucking talk to me. None of you.” Dean stormed out of the office, pushing past Alistar without a second glance.
Ares instantly opened for him and snaked one arm behind his back to grip the waistband of his jeans. “You sure? If you’d be more comfortable we could go inside the car, the windows are tinted at least.”
Amara digested all of that information and cleared her throat before speaking. “All of that sounds reasonable, Castiel. Are you sure this is what you want?”
The sight of his come seemed to push Ares over and he moaned as he came, soaking his lace panties so much Jask could feel it seeping through. His eyes were blown with lust as he moved back and it was his turn to lick Jask clean.
Maybe the spark didn’t really exist? Maybe this was as good as it gets? Especially for someone like Dean. Call him a helpless romantic, but Dean didn’t know he could ever settle for anything less than that fake spark he pretended to feel on TV. He wanted that,
That train of thought makes him uneasy, though he knows it's futile. There's nothing in that prison that can kill him save for his own brothers and Cain, and they keep Cain so heavily guarded, warded and sedated that he's not much of a threat. Dean wouldn't be able to kill him — but he
“Damnit.” Cas chuckled and looked over, then rolled his eyes. “The first time, I said ‘you shine brighter than all the stars in the sky’ in Russian. And then... in order, it was something along the lines of ‘so good, perfect, don’t stop’ in French, Irish Gaelic, and Italian... respectively.”
His cock finds Dean prostate and he tosses his head back with a groan as his cock rubs on Frenchie’s stomach. “Fuck... I’m gonna—”
Castiel was jolted awake by his favorite obnoxious redhead - or used to be favorite. Right now, not so much. “Cas! We have to get back to packing. You napped for two hours.” She looked at his face and sat up straighter. “Was it him again?”
It's said so damn seriously that Dean’s probably the only one that hears it for the dig it is, and he looks down, biting back his response because none is necessary after that.
“Yo-” Cas froze, not expecting it to be so easy. “Seriously? I... I have to put in my two weeks, but I can start as soon as that is up.” He was still shocked, and nearly dropped his phone as he pulled up his calendar for them to talk dates. “Thank you, Cain. I... can’t thank you enough.”
The last thing Dean wants is to suck his nasty cock again, so he stays against his better judgement. “It's a nice day outside. We can talk here.”
You’re lucky my job is to protect you.” And just like that, Cas clasped his hands together in front of him and resumed that stupid wall-decoration pose.
Castiel’s pupils blow as he shakes his head. “I insist you keep it on, but make sure your slacks are down far enough. I don't want to get butter stains all over them.” He frantically starts peeling the tops off the small packets and swipes his fingers through the butter, fumbling as he starts to coat his cock. “Come here and turn around.”
“Nah,” Dean beamed and quickly planted a kiss to Cas’ temple. “Honestly, I don’t care where we live… so I guess we’re gonna have to find somethin’ else to argue about.”
Dean pulled off slowly, placed another kiss to the head of his cock, and kissed his way back up his body.
and not our bed.” Cas stood behind Dean and wrapped his arms around his torso, kissing along his back. “I love your smile, sweetheart. It’s my favorite thing ever.”
Dean laughed loudly, grossed out by the visual. “God, you’re foul. No, though, none of the girls. One of the guys. I’m tellin you, J. I’ve been actively having sex with people whose eyes weren’t that fucking pink.”
“Right here.” He watches Ares leave the room to give them some time, and then tries again. “I’m good, J. Didn’t really sleep last night if you know what I mean.”
“If he’s the killer, I’m not making any promises,” Jask quipped. “But will you shut up about how much you love each other and actually put yourselves to good use? We got six different case files, all bank robberies and murders, all different perps. I don’t see how any of this helps.”
He grunts whether he wants to or not and braces his hands, letting Butcher take over so he can focus on the pleasure. Soon, his cock is hard in Butcher’s hand and Dean is moaning, pushing back onto his fingers. “Let me have it, fuck... c’mon.”
Dean nods toward Cas with a grin. “Oh yeah, that’s my angel. Off with her head, babe.” He takes advantage of the vamps’ distraction and slips from one’s grip, quickly kicking him off and turning to fight the bigger one. “Man, you fugly.”
The fact that Dean doesn't seem scared has Cas rutting up and gasping into his mouth, sucking his tongue and curling his fingers against his skin. “Cas…” Dean mumbles between kisses. “Take the rest off.” He kisses down Cas’ neck and grips his wings tighter, and Cas can't seem to do anything but moan for a moment, shaking under Dean until he loosens his grip. Cas’ eyes are unfocused and lust-blown as the rest of their clothes disappear.
He didn’t know if it was out of guilt or habit, but seeing Jask on his couch all comfortable did things inside his chest that he couldn’t explain.
Dean dove in hungrily, his hands running up into Cas’ already fucked hair. He could feel how much Cas wanted this too, and he was fucking
“Ah fuck, don’t make promises you can’t keep.” Dean groans in that sinful way Cas has always loved, and he realizes that for the first time, Dean’s making these noises all for
His girlfriend Eileen walked over and signed to him that everything would be okay, and her warm smile was almost enough to calm the monstrous butterflies currently having babies inside his stomach. He signed a ‘thank you’, happy he and Cas had started ASL learning at home. Eileen could read lips like no one’s business, but they still wanted her to know she was a member of their family. They could adapt a little for family.
It feels good to know he caught him by surprise, and the shocked look on Dean’s face is worth five jobs at least, but his glee only lasts a few more seconds before Dean’s fist is connecting with his cheekbone and he’s being shoved back against the brick wall. “Nice jab, Cas.”
As badly as Jask wanted him to do exactly that, he knew they weren’t going to have a lot of time once they got where they were going, and figured they’d be better off if they were both on the edge. “Maybe just a taste.”
“Have I told you how awesome you are? Cause you’re awesome.” He interlocked their fingers and kissed the back of Cas’ hand.
“I didn’t think that walk through, sorry.” He nuzzled into Dean’s chest, inhaling his delicious scent. “I already feel better.”
The volumes of character growth that spoke were almost too much for Cas. When he’d met Dean originally, all he cared about was himself and his image, and Cas felt
He didn’t see Dean the rest of the night, and the following morning was… tense. Cas wasn’t sure if he was back on duty yet or not, but his gun was sitting on the table so he holstered it, relaxing at its comforting weight. He made his way into the kitchen after and saw Dean sitting at the table. “Good morning. Did you sleep okay?”
He paced in Ares’ bedroom in a last ditch effort to change his mind, and then started opening drawers.
Dean stared out the window, completely forgetting that he had wanted to drive. He wasn’t in the right mind frame, regardless. He took deep shaky breaths, trying to compose himself.
It had been a while since Dean had a day off. He got the fireplace going and plopped on his comfy ass couch and tuned his guitar. “How’s the handler search goin?”
Dean swallowed him whole, stroking himself quickly between Cas’ legs. Cas rocked in, pulling Dean’s hair hard enough that the moan he let out vibrated through his length and made his toes curl.
“C’mon, Get in there. He can feel that’s fake. Let him get some licks.” Dean was probably enjoying this too much, but seeing Cas nervous with a puppy was just hilarious.
With a grin, Dean bared his neck and reached down to pull Cas even closer. He could feel Cas was hard too, and hoped they were actually going to fuck tonight. “House has alarms, no one knows of this place...” Dean rutted up into Cas. “Gonna fuck your boyfriend tonight, Betty?”
Laughing, Dean bit his lip and tilted his head at Cas. “I think I gotta use the restroom. Bad timing, I know… but that water you’ve been makin’ me drink just goes right through me.”
Dean sat up with flushed cheeks. “Yeah? Can’t wait, Cas?” He started undoing his belt. “Oh, I’m clean, by the way. Haven’t been with anyone else, and I got tested that Monday after you asked me to. But I’m not open, gonna need a little help.”
Dean chuckled deeply and rutted into his ass. “Never had ass like it, J. So fat it fills up my whole palm.” He slapped his hand down and bit his lip. “So fucking perfect for this dick. Ride me like you’ll miss me, baby.”
“Fuck yeah... Fill me up, Cas!” Dean tossed his head back and reached down, bumping Cas’ hand away so he could stroke himself quickly.
“Course not. Tellin’ you, I think I was born in the wrong time. Music, movies, lingo… everything was better back in the day.”
She cleared her throat, looking as nervous as they always did. Jo smiled reassuringly at her and she seemed to relax. “So w—what’s next for Michael and Olivia now that Olivia’s back from France?”
Dean scoffed. “Whatever, man. Ima see ‘em.” And Dean being Dean, he started singing a remix to Blondie’s ‘One Way Or Another’.
Knowing the truth surprisingly didn’t make him feel better - on the contrary, it made him squirm. He flicked his eyes down to Dean’s strong hands and shuddered, thinking about Woody’s... and how similar Dean’s would probably feel splayed across his thighs.
He blushed, happy it was hidden. “I… might have been daydreaming a little bit, and laughed. Out loud. It’s not really his fault, I would’ve singled me out, too.”
with you?” The anger builds in his chest until Cas is walking forward and shoving Dean backward. “I'm going to lose my job because of this! And for what, so your pathetic ass could get in a couple of laughs?”
When he opened his eyes, the well deserved hangover had him praying to the porcelain god and promising he’d never drink alone again. Dean would have never let him get so out of hand.
Cas heard Amara open the front door and then the only voice he ever wanted to hear saying hi to her.
That weekend, Dean put on in his best fitted dress shirt and nicest jeans. He put his contacts in just in case, and tried to make his hair look presentable. With a nervous huff, he pep-talked himself in the mirror. “Okay. You got this. She already knows he’s into older guys, and it’s better to come clean now than wait until later. What we’re doing isn’t illegal, just frowned upon.” He nodded once, fixed his tie, and then drove over to Cas’ house.
Dean started to remove the busted fan. “He’s one of those take-no-prisoners types, y’know? Just says and does whatever’s on his mind, to hell with the consequences. He doesn’t let
His gorgeous boyfriend had his phone propped on his dresser and his hard, leaking cock was sticking out of some beautiful pink, satin panties.
“Yeah, peachy. Trying to think and drink at the same time, you know I don't multitask well.” Dean plays it off and then pulls up his guitar, settling back in his chair with a groan. “Any requests?”
Dean smiled and pulled him into a hug. “Too long.” He pulled back and cleared his throat. “Um… this is Cas. My bodyguard… Well,
They picked up speed, rutting against each other until they were both coming with loud, intense groans, and the table split clean in two. Dean landed hard on top of Cas, who let out a pained grunt. “De—”
That was something he understood fully. “Most of the time I don’t bother, but if I do… I end up eating the same thing for a week. For someone as perpetually single as myself, you’d think I’d have learned to cook in moderation by now.” He stabbed one of the potatoes and chewed it slowly, amazed by the pop of flavor. “No girlfriend, then?”
Cas and Cole were out there doing... whatever it was they do for these things, and once Dean was finished opening himself up, his mind began to wander. They really
“Nothin’ everything is fan-friggin-tastic. Gettin’ married, all is well, right?” He pushed away the pie tin and stood up, knowing damn well he should have eaten less.
Dean checked out his face slowly and licked his lips. “How could someone ever want to punch that face?”
“You’re in charge, remember?” He smiled a little, turning to glance up at Dean. One month wouldn’t be enough time to stare into those green eyes.
“MRE? Those damn plastic packets?” Dean opened his eyes and stared at Cas, fumbling with those dog tags, again. “My dad had those. I remember that cookie they came with was so good. I ate 'em all and got in trouble.” He chuckled to himself, but it was low and almost sad.
“Gonna fill you up again, omega.” Dean lifts up and fucks into Cas hand, and the sound of him fucking his come is so obscene that the others slide down the table to put distance between them all.
Dean takes a step back with fear flashing in his eyes for a moment — but figures maybe Bobby spilled the beans. “So, what… you think I'm crazy now or something?”
He brought Cas’ hand to his mouth and licked it clean as Cas continued grinding down. “I’m close, Cas. Fuck. You got so damn tight when you came…” Dean’s eyes fluttered closed and Cas leaned down to kiss him hard, rolling his hips as Dean pistoned up into him and came with a growl and a possessive bite to Cas’ lip.
“I probably wouldn’t. I’d just go back to— never mind. I’m not used to getting anything from anyone. I’ve been on my own most my life. I raised a brother that wants nothin’ to do with how I live my life. Dad was hardly around. Even before this... nothin’ ever came easy.”
He slung his duffle bag over his shoulder and grabbed his suits, then huffed an obnoxiously deep breath as he approached the front door. He knocked loudly, then belatedly noticed the doorbell.
“That was close.” Dean swings the blade with a grunt, smiling at the final thump of a skull hitting the floor. He bends down to check out the rebar. He pokes it with his pointer finger, shaking his head. “They thought shoving this in me would stop me from liking dick?” Dean tilts his head. “Kinda looks like a dick actually... Hey, Cas...” he does an obscene tongue movement at the tip and cackles at himself. “Who’s the cuck now,
He flicked his eyes up toward the set and wished he hadn’t, this particular part had Dean kneeling with his back straight and the sheet pooled around the bottom of his thighs. It gave Cas — and everyone else in that room — a crystal-clear view of Dean’s ass. Cas had seen it before, but something about the lighting and the way the scene was staged made Dean’s physique look even better. Cas dropped his phone and it clattered loudly to the ground, but only a couple of heads turned his way.
They lost themselves in that kiss, and this time… Dean didn’t shut him out or pull away. He stayed so close to Cas that it was hard to tell where one of their bodies ended and the other began, and that was something that hadn’t happened in years. They were one.
the control, and both of them knew it. On one hand, Cas was happy that they were having sex at all instead of their usual escapades, but on the other… he couldn’t help but wonder if someone like Dean wouldn’t be able to give him exactly what he needed. He came with a grunt, barely stopping Dean’s name from rolling off his lips. As Ares filled him up, he was overcome with shame at the realization that he’d fantasized about a man he’d never even seen in person, let alone met.
“Almost. Yes.” Ares nuzzled in closer. “I’m so happy we all found each other. I mean... it wasn’t in the most traditional way, but... who cares.”
That same battle, while the Cumberland sank, the Virginia turned her sights on another ship, the USS Congress. Confederate commander Buchanan
“Yeah. And no work this weekend. M’all yours tonight—” he kisses Cas— “tomorrow—” he kisses again— “and the next day.”
Cas waits until he swallows the bite he's taken to answer. “Good. Does this mean that we can go on a proper date this evening? I put out, if that's any incentive.”
Normally, Jask got home well before Dean fell asleep but tonight, Dean was already knee deep in a dream about angels and demons when he felt the bed move. Dean offered him nothing more than an annoyed grunt when his overgrown boyfriend shook his arm to wake him, and the dream was already slipping away by the time Jask spoke.
cook, but that’s probably up to you. Maybe it will be in the paperwork, actually? I don’t know, sorry. You wanna cook for other people? He eats enough to feed a small army.”
“Atta boy.” Butcher pulls his fingers out and shoves his cock in without warning, tugging Dean up until their bodies are flush. “Ahh, fuckin' 'ell, knew this ass would be top notch.”
Shifting, Cas kissed Dean’s chest and then his chin, eager to have his lips on any part of Dean he had access to. He yearned to go lower, to sink beneath the blankets and taste him fully — and suddenly, he couldn’t think of a reason not to. Sure, it would be a waste to try to have sex when they’d have to be quiet, constantly conscious of their exes sitting just outside. But sex wasn’t the only trick in the book, and Cas needed
He walked in, his gait strained from the bulge in his pants, and sat on one of the bleachers looking for Jask. He spotted him across the gym talking to a couple of students, and then his eyes landed on Cas. The moment Cas spotted him, he started nonchalantly making his way over.
“Fine.” He studied the cabinets, the floor, the patterns in the table... anything to distract himself as he wondered whether or not to bring it up. “Has Cole checked in?”
Tears formed in the boy’s eyes and for a moment, he looked like he was going to break down... but he launched himself from the booth and wrapped his arms so tight around Dean’s neck it would’ve been painful if he was older than maybe eight years. He buried his face in Dean’s neck and Dean could feel the dampness there as the boy muttered something that sounded like ‘thank you.’
“Sure is. She yelled at this student one time and I swear the kid never stepped outta line again. Bet you he had nightm- hey, Row… how’s it goin’?” Dean blushed, hoping she wasn’t listening to that, and the flush darkened when he saw Cas fighting back a laugh.
They head back through the prison as the alarm continues to blare, and the flashing lights make it hard for Dean to make much of anything out. He’s grateful for that — he'd rather not see the look on other inmates’ faces when they see him being bridal carried by a guard.
“Yup. With everything, Cas.” He bites his lip as Cas pulls his pants down below his cheeks and strokes him.
Ares looks away because those eyes always make him melt, and Dean can tell he wants to play mad — but he can also see the small smile on Ares’ lips.
Dean was wearing boot cut jeans that hugged his ass and a dark green henley that hugged the rest of him, and would almost certainly bring out his eyes. He turned with a smirk to face Cas, eyeing him up and down. “Hey, Anita, you finally get that nap?”
“Shit... yeah... I wanna go with you.” Dean squeezed and kissed the side of his head. “Thanks. See... my personal angel.”
“I know this doesn’t really answer your question and is gonna sound like a cop-out, but it just… happened. Cas is wicked smart — even if he doesn’t know it, he challenges me every day to be a better teacher and a better person, he’s kind…” He trailed off, knowing his face was a deep shade of red. “He’s got a fire in him I don’t see very often.”
The bathroom door was closed, but the water was definitely running. He placed his ear to the wood and quickly shoved the door open. “Ha!!!” But Cas was fully dressed and fucking shaving. “Sonofabitch!!!”
She narrowed her gaze, and then backed toward her bug. “Fine. But don’t have sex in that bathroom. I hear it’s pretty gnarly.” That only made Dean laugh and Cas blush harder.
He was in Dean’s lap in an instant, pushing him back against the couch. “Good. I was worried suggesting we throw the rule out the window wasn’t going to go over well, but this is one time I’m happy to be wrong.” Cas slid his hand down Dean’s chest but stopped. “We’re two consenting adults. None of this has to change anything. We’re just… two adults - best friends, actually - fake dating and having very
Did you show up here in panties, Cas?” His hands slid down Cas’ body and pushed at his waistband, trying to see for himself.
“I’m sorry about your father.” He placed a hand on the table and then retracts it. “I have a question... and you don’t have to answer it out loud, but if you can... I’m here to listen. If you were to see
“Umm....” A small smile formed on those beautiful lips. “Cuddles... blowjobs?” He chuckled at his joke and then finally met Cas’ eyes. “And kisses... gonna let me kiss you, sweetheart?”
He nodded slightly, focusing on the food. “A couple of times in the shower. Never anywhere else. Ironically enough, I was scared of getting caught in the act… and I doubt I look anywhere near as good as you do.”
“Alright then, brother. Carry on, didn’t mean to disturb you.” Benny nodded to him and walked back out in the living room just as Jask texted to confirm he was on his way over.
He couldn’t tell from the low resolution, but it didn’t stop him from wondering… and now, he was about to find out.
criteria, but it’s all I know about her so far. I’ll report in after the date... or maybe the next morning. Might be a good night.” He wiggled his eyebrows.
“It might. But, if you aren’t strong enough to handle a month apart... how could you handle life? And honestly, the temptation is a good thing. You always said you were worried Ares wanted something else in bed, this is a good test for him.”
Cas rubbed his palm over his crotch and stayed still, clenching his jaw. “Far be it from me to interrupt, then. But if you’re pretending it’s me, the least you could do is move your hand right.”
love myself. I love your personality and how you’re secretly nerdy. I love how fierce you are in everything you do, because that’s just who you are. A fierce Marine, a fierce friend, and an even fiercer lover. I don’t know if fiercer is a word, just roll with it.” Dean laughed with a smile that lit up the room. “The point is, I feel safe with you, I feel home with you. I...
Cas pushed open the door to see if Dean at least wanted breakfast before he started working out, and realized Dean wasn’t working out at all. “Oh!” Cas mumbled, his eyes locked on Dean’s exposed length.
“Language, Hannah. But, you’re not wrong. If the draft happened now, twenty year old males would be the first to go. Legal adults, but… barely, right?” He turned toward the group of guys next to him. “Of course, some of you might not actually serve. Ashton, you might get out of it as a married man. Carlos, maybe you’ve got a medical condition you weren’t aware of that’ll come out in your physical. Cas, you could’ve claimed to be a conscientious objector had you not enlisted on your own. But, the truth would be that most of you would serve, and at least a few of you would die.”
Jask shrugged, playing it off. “I’ll wear one for you whenever you want, but yeah. Boss says he found me a couple of jobs around here. They pay pretty damn well, so I don’t work every day, but usually two or three days a week.”
“Wouldn’t you be? I can’t say I’d handle it with a whole lot of dignity. And say whatever you want, we both know you’d be screaming something stupid just for show, like... ‘fight the fairies’.” Cas grinned, watching the way Dean gallic shrugged.
the goosebumps spreading up his back when his knuckles brushed the skin. Cas nodded a little, speaking quietly. “I know, Dean. That’s the whole reason we’re here, isn’t it? You’ve got me, when no one else does.”
“You sure.” He pointed at Cas’ shorts. “Seems like you might need the release. Bet you Dean is getting ass-rammed as we speak.”
When Dean reached into his pocket, Cas nearly had a full blown heart attack, and that was nothing compared to when Dean slowly kneeled down on one knee. “Cas—” As if the flood gates from heaven opened, summer rain began to pour, blowing out all the candles in seconds and Dean’s face completely fell. “Fuck! Cas... m’sorry. I didn’t check the weather.”
Dean’s drooling around his hand and he’s hard again, groaning loudly as he slides his tongue between those digits and sucks. He couldn’t use words if he tried, couldn’t even think a full sentence. He’s never been so used before, and he shivers when he realizes just how much it does for him.
He was actually excited to fuck Jask, and not some stranger in the dark. But knowing them, they probably wouldn’t leave the bed for at least a day, so that pie was comin’ too.
Cas sighed happily, leaning into him as much as he could without being overly obvious about it. “I love that song, so you won’t hear an argument from me.”
Saying goodbye was actually a little sad. Dean felt bad when Havoc followed Jask to the door like he was going with him. As he watched him walk away, he feared he’d just given up something good. They had an arrangement that worked, and he was throwing it away for what? A bodyguard that looks at him like he’s an annoying child? Who wanted to fuck him, just to say he’s fucked Dean Winchester? Even as he thought these things, he knew they couldn’t be true. He overheard Benny on the phone with Cas and walked closer to listen.
Dean got up and walked towards the bedroom door. Havoc was there in seconds, jumping into his arms. “Hey, Hav, where’s Daddy Cas, hmm? Let’s go find him.”
“It’s only like a day, D. He’ll be back here tomorrow night. And if I know anything about anything, he’ll be happy it’s over. No way he’s around you and doesn’t want you, it’s not possible.”
“Mmm, gotcha.” Wet, sloppy sounds invaded Cas’ ears and he tried with everything he was not to picture that asshole kissing over Dean’s naked body.
Ares bit his lip and then answered quickly. “H—hey Jask. Miss me already?” He blushed and mouthed ‘sorry’ at Cas but didn’t really know why he apologized. He wasn’t doing anything wrong, especially now that they talked.
They stripped in the bedroom and could hardly take their eyes off each other. Jask climbed into bed and held open his arms, hoping Ares would join him. “Yeah. I work all weekend.”
Dean spent the rest of the day thinking about Cas, but surprisingly, it wasn’t about his panties. It was just about him. How he wasn’t getting what he needed from Ares, and how he knew without a shadow of a doubt that
It was irritating and adorable all at once, and Cas chuckled. He scratched under Havoc’s chin and then did the same to Dean just to be an ass. “Daddy Cas is still on duty, he can fart in whomever’s bed he chooses... I’ll never know.”
“Oh... Yeah, just one guy. The same one from the summer, Benny. I told you about him.” They finished up the dishes and Jimmy asked to be excused so he could puke over their conversation. “Such a virgin.”
By the time Cas walked back, Dean already had flour all over the counter, on his cheek, and in his hair. “Alright, it wasn’t my fault, the bag... poofed when I opened it.”
Benny didn’t protest on the drive over there, or when they got out and Dean was immediately swarmed by all the fake ass celebrities he made nice with in public.
“Gross, see ya later, D. Wish me luck with my nurse.” He set his unopened beer aside and nodded a goodbye.
Adam nodded and led the way to the kitchen, where the smell of bacon wafted quickly to Dean’s nose. He pointed at the stove and a stack of plates next to it. “Help yourself. We weren’t sure what you liked or what you were even allowed to eat, so Kate made a little of everything.”
Laughing, Ares held up his hands like he was trying to separate them. “Okay, okay. Break it up, and let's take a step back.”
He served their dinners and set the table, not grabbing the beers until Cas was making his way back out so they would still be ice cold. "Hope you're hungry."
Under different circumstances, Cas might’ve taken him up on that offer. Jaskier was objectively nearly as good-looking as Dean, but Jaskier
Words fail him when the breeze hits him again. He growls, his hands clenching at his sides as he approaches a small group of people having a barbecue. They all stare at him, and under normal circumstances, he’d be embarrassed — but that isn’t an emotion he can cling to. All he feels is
Cas pulled him in by the front of his shirt and licked into his mouth like he was chasing the taste of himself. He stopped the kiss, running his other hand down Dean’s body and shoving Dean’s pants down without breaking eye contact. “Honestly? I think you’ve teased me enough over the last four years.”
Dean chuckled and closed his lips to suck, relaxing his throat so Cas can push in further. He did, biting his lip, but then stilled as he bottomed out. The point of that currency was to see what Dean could do with just that mouth alone, and Cas was extremely eager to find out.
because such a position would put Dean’s mouth entirely too close to his cock, the thickening in his shorts proved otherwise.
Dean walked over by the trunk and leaned against it. “Heard you have a lotta tattoos… gonna share with the class, Betty?” He was still doing his adorable grin he knew people couldn't resist… well other people, apparently not Cas.
Ares was still awake, sitting on the counter while he sipped brown liquid from a clear glass. His cheeks were flushed, letting Jask know that wasn’t his first drink, and the grin he had was adorable. “You were supposed to be home before I got drunk. What happened to your face?” He hopped off the counter, all humor gone as he examined Jask’s cheek.
“You got it.” Dean stripped down and pushed his cock down to lay on his stomach. “C’mon baby. Show me you wuv me.”
“Alright, folks! I know break is right around the corner, but you’re all still obligated to pay attention to me for the next couple of days, so pull out those books, let’s go!” Dean clapped, then winced as he learned the hard way that was a horrible idea. “Today, we’re gonna talk about the draft.”
The party officially kicked off with a reading, but thankfully, Cas wasn’t the one that had to do it. Charlie had volunteered for that particular job. He listened with a smile wide enough to hurt his face as she read — no,
“I assumed a proper detective would have handcuffs, my mistake.” He glances toward the timer on the oven and mumbles something under his breath, then goes to take it out, bending over to reach it.
Cas glanced back over at Aaron and his mom as Madison brought them their food out. “If you think it felt amazing for you, imagine how good it felt for him. At eight years old, maybe nine… he received the validation so many of us live our entire lives without receiving. You just did a very, very good thing.”
ridiculous. He tried to convince the waitress his name was legally King Tut, complete with a likely offensive Egyptian accent.
Dean stands up and walks closer. He can't help it, for some reason… he wants to test that steely resolve. “I could help you out with that, y’know. Not inappropriate if I offer, right?” He licks his lips and meets those blue eyes, losing himself in them for a few moments.
“Take off your pants and lay down on your stomach. I'll get you sweats to put on after, where's your bag…? Nevermind, I'll give you a pair of shorts.” Cas digs around in his drawers until he finds a pair of Dean’s old ones that he'd kept all this time, and when he turns back around, his breath catches in his throat. Dean’s laid out exactly as Cas told him to be, and it's a gorgeous enough sight that Cas can't actually move for a moment.
When they arrived at the diner, Cas went in to get the food. The hostess gave him an odd look but didn’t say much as he paid and made his way hastily back outside, only relaxing when he was back in the car and no longer out of Dean’s sight. The bags rustled as he dug through them and handed Dean his burger.
sound she makes has him laughing out loud and he stands to take the plate over to the sink as told, kissing her cheek before returning to his seat.
Dean didn’t fight his laugh that time. “Damn straight. But you’re a kid, too. What do you do for fun?”
She squeezed his arm and let go, glancing toward their director who was attempting to wave them over. “Dean, I adore you, but maybe you should listen to them. If they say they need help… they probably do. How often have you heard
His cheeks flush again. “At this point? No, I won't be picky. But before... yes. I'll be surprised if you don't already know what that is, I can't seem to turn it off.”
The reality of it all hits Dean like a train and he pulls away, shoving his cock into his pants as he backs out of the cell. “Cas... we shouldn’t have done that. You’re— I’m— shit... I’m the friggin Sheriff and you’re supposed to feel safe with me. I just— you’re drunk, Cas. Fuck, I’m so sorry.”
“Hell yeah! I owe you a big one for that. Asshat would have demolished that pie.” Dean stood up and started cleaning the grill. He always took good care of it, and made a face at the state J left it in. “Ugh, he didn’t try at all to clean this damn grease off, he’s not allowed to touch my grill either, anymore.”
He pictured some Pegasus printed ones and realized he was getting too distracted. That wasn’t why P was here. He kissed his way down his torso to take him in his mouth, reminding himself what to focus on.
Neither, apparently, was his bodyguard. Cas walked up behind him and lightly grazed his ass, continuing around to the other side of the table. “I’m a top, Dean. I assure you, there’s nothing up my ass.”
Part of him was curious, but he wasn’t sure if asking was a good idea. Cas decided the less he knew the better, and folded his arms in front of him as he leaned against the wall. “I’ll have Jody print out more of those... agreements. How many
He shrugged and averted Cas’ gaze. “Yeah... I do.” Dean blushed and chuckled to himself. “I always wanted kids. I used to say I didn’t, because I used to imagine how they would feel if I died and left them behind. But even then, I wanted them. D—do you?”
Chuckling at his own joke, he made his way back inside his house to have a snack. It wasn’t quite dinner time yet and he was still trying to figure out what to bother cooking for himself when someone knocked on his door. Assuming it was Sam again, he opened it hesitantly, but found himself face-to-face with a middle aged man with even longer hair than Sam’s. He looked a little like a grizzly bear, but it wasn’t off-putting. “Hello, can I help you?”
“First day? The one I wasn’t at? Does that mean you wanted Jimmy?!” He teased, knowing Dean meant the first time he saw him. “That’s gross.” Cas smiled against his lips and kissed him again.
He contemplated lying, or brushing it off by getting into an argument over who was the favorite in their family - but they both already knew it was Sam, so that would be useless. “Yeah, I guess. Sophomore kid, Cas Novak. He’s... interesting.”
“Goddamnit,” he growls, more come flooding into Cas’ abused hole. “Shit’s never gonna go down if you don’t stop moving.”
Cas grinned and started grabbing everything else to take it back inside. After a couple of trips, the grill was clean, so Dean followed him back inside. Cas shut the dishwasher and nodded toward the pie. “We better hurry.”
Thick hands pull him down until he's split open on Cas’ cock, and he leans back against his chest, turning his head to kiss him. Cas rocks up, reaching around to stroke him as he sucks on his tongue.
The memories of his entire stay threaten to drown him. It takes pretty much all he's got to stay awake and alert and
“Commitment can mean a variety of things, but the most important thing to discern is if it means the same thing to you and your partner… or partners. To some, commitment really does involve a white picket fence, wedding bands, and sharing only in each other until death do you part.” Professor Ketch glanced around the room like he himself found that appalling. “For others, it could be a mutual agreement not to sleep around, with no intention of ever getting married to the other.”
Dean gripped Cas’ wrist and looked at the mess. “I’m not that sweet, sweetheart.” He pulled Cas back in. “How you gonna clean that off?”
The man underneath him squirmed, biting on Dean’s bottom lip as he searched for contact again. One, single word came spilling almost inaudibly from his lips over and over again:
Cas grunted, his hips stuttering and his hand tightening around them as he felt himself on that razor-sharp edge, knowing he was seconds away from release but not being quite ready for it yet.
The omega shivers on top of him, then snatches a hot dog right out of Jask’s hand on its way to his mouth. “I prefer ketchup, next time… whoever you are.” He takes a bite, wiggling a little on Dean’s lap. “I'm grouchy because… well, we’ll have that conversation when you're
Cas didn’t so much as outwardly flinch, but the things that went on inside his body at the question... he was squirming. “A while, Dean.”
“No. He said he was goin’ to see that Arthur guy and I didn’t tell him. I felt stupid. I broke up with someone I wasn’t technically with, because I let Cas fuck me against my pool table.” He took another long drink. “Then I let J fuck me because I pictured Cas with someone else, and I just feel...” Dean polished off yet another drink and sighed, not quite sure how to finish that sentence. “You gonna drink that?” He grabbed her cup and chugged it.
He nodded, trying to keep his expression from betraying him. “Of course she is. Are we done, then, or are we going to finish out the movie per the terms of the date?”
“Holy shit. Marry me, Cas. I don’t care that we’ve already done it twice.” Dean grinned, kissing him again and then stood up gingerly. “Fuck. Note to self, I’m too goddamn old to wear a plug for that many hours.”
Chuckling, Cas pulls his son in for a hug. “I told you a long time ago that the ones we love never really leave us, Jack. He's in your heart.”
“I didn’t know you batted for her team. I guess we didn’t discuss that. Do you?” Ares shifted closer so he could be comfortable again.
Cas wore his marks proudly. No one could see his back, but Dean had left others on his neck as well. When his friends asked about them, he just smiled and brushed it off. It felt like a dirty little secret…
“Grace, Dean. That's me.” He does it again, urging him faster with his other hand, then moves suddenly, flipping them and laying Dean down with one of his wings tucked under him for comfort. He thrusts hard, leaning down to kiss him, and Dean’s a goner.
asshat no. It wasn’t so bad, I got off for the first time in a while so…” he trails off with a gallic shrug.
Dean’s mood was completely shot. “Oh... well... thanks, I guess.” He gripped his hips. “Mine, huh?” He asked, trying to lift his spirits back up.
"April." Cas walked over, stopping himself before reaching out. He shouldn't comfort her, that wasn’t his job and it wasn't fair to her, it would never mean what she wanted it to mean. "I know I've said the words so much they've lost their meaning but... I truly am sorry. I should have never let this..." He waved a hand, struggling with his words again. Even what he was about to say was going to be insensitive. "I'm an ass."
The whimper Cas released was pathetic, but he didn’t care. For the first time ever, Dean wasn’t fighting himself. He pulled back and kissed down Dean’s neck, grinding his ass down onto him. “Dean...”
Before he could try, Cas peeked open one of his beautiful cerulean eyes and looked around. He must have felt there were no threats, because he closed his eye and went back to sleep.
“You don’t want the responsibility? Fine. I’ll figure it out myself. I know how to do laundry now, I can find some dick without the SWAT team.”
“Do you usually go anywhere on Friday evenings? Bars, restaurants, that sort of thing? Ares never has a set schedule, it always varies, so he doesn’t really have a ‘weekend’ like most do. And since I write from home, every day is sort of a weekend.”
He followed quickly, nodding and dipping down to kiss the corner of Cas’ mouth gently before settling down next to him. They shifted together until Cas could feel him across almost every inch of his body, and it sent a warmth through his bones. “C’mon, angel. I’d never say no to this.”
Dean snapped him out of it as the director yelled that they needed to start over. “The fuck is the problem here? Shit was perfect like five takes ago! Ima need to
“No... today was my last day. I quit. But I still have my handcuffs.” Cas flipped Dean around and pressed his chest to his back while he reached around to unbuckle Dean’s pants.
guard, the prisoners too... no.” Cas shakes his head. “He's making something of himself over here. Not to mention... he's a
He screwed up his face and finally looked at Dean again. “I don’t work out in my suit, that would be ridiculous.”
Jask’s cock twitched involuntarily at the way Ares said ‘sir’, and for a moment, he couldn’t speak. “Nah, not convinced at all. I hope you’re lying though, I’ve uh… never had the pleasure. D never really seemed to give them a second look.” From the look on Ares’ face, he’d be giving Jask’s suits more than a second look… and that was
Swallowing it all was actually unnecessary with how deep Cas was, and when he slowly pulled off, he lapped at Cas’ heavy cock just to watch his body shudder.
“Good.” Thursday flips through a stack of papers on his desk and pulls out a file, then spends a moment getting organized. “Tell me about yourself. What did you do before you were arrested?”
Madison set their silverware down and wiped her hands on her apron. “You’re welcome here anytime, Dean. No one in these parts will judge you or make a fuss about it, we’ll leave you to your business. I’ll have that pie out to you shortly.” She turned on her heel and disappeared back into the kitchen.
“You're serious? You think your mouth is worth an entire damn pack?” Ashton raises his eyebrows, but doesn't give him a chance to answer. “Fine, deal me in. You're hot enough that I don't care if you suck at it.”
“Ah, hell...” Dean’s tongue peeks out as he reaches down, stroking his throbbing, leaking cock in sync with his thrusts. “Damn, Angel. Never felt so... fucking good.”
The eye roll he received was epic. “I’d have thought you’d want to date someone that doesn’t like pie… more for you.” He sat down in the living room, still within sight of Dean. “How long do you think we have before those two break down the door?”
Cas’ mouth was watering before he even slid off the couch. He pushed Dean’s chest gently until he laid down on the ground, then slid Dean’s pants the rest of the way off. He licked and sucked a line up his left leg and flicked his tongue over Dean’s balls, then kept going up his muscled body until he was hovering completely over him. Cas’ spent cock hung heavy on Dean’s hips as he leaned in to kiss him, savoring his own taste and the way those gorgeous lips felt against his own.
At the end of the day, Dean had been just as willing to fuck a perfect stranger… Cas had been a fool to think he’d be different.
Once the classroom sounded empty, Dean took a breath and turned around, only to find Castiel with his sunglasses back on. “Perhaps the douchebag look was better?” He lowered them to show off his pink eyes again and then walked out of the room without a look back.
“Where have you been goin’? I thought after Cain you’d stay, but what the hell. Are you... seeing someone else?”
“Adam did. He didn’t have many, but Kate showed me a few while we were there. You were in them, your whole family was. Maybe he can make you a copy.” Cas kissed the top of Dean’s head, knowing he was useless with a loss this devastating. Anger welled in his chest at the people who would do something so heinous to another human being, and he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt he’d murder the person responsible if he ever saw them. That thought should have been scary, or repulsive… but he couldn’t bring himself to care. “I’m so sorry.”
“Cas... fuck... so good. Mine...” he nips along Cas’ jaw and starts sucking marks on his neck. Cas moves faster, whining and hanging on tighter as his cock thickens again between their heated bodies. He's shaking now, all crabby, bratty pretense long forgotten.
A few of the kids shook their heads, but for the most part, he got no response other than Cas… which was the only one he cared about, anyway.
Cas had been standing with his knees pressed against the side of the bed, knowing in his gut that this had been wrong. The second Dean said his name, Cas’ hand shot out and wrapped around Ishim’s neck. “Out.”
Whatever she tried to say to defend herself was absolutely lost to her sobs as one of the cops handcuffed her. He looked at Dean and nodded toward the window. “She do this?”
“Wait, wait. You matched on Tinder? I think that’s the green light, chief.” Benny growled a laugh and sat up to watch Cas.
“You, or the pie?” Dean smirks as he takes his first bite, and it’s so damn good he moans, closing his eyes and pounding his fist down on the table. “Oh my — fuck. Will you marry me? There’s a church around the corner.”
"From the snippet Jack showed me, Sam mentioned getting the kids out of there but completely forgot they existed after you died. Oh, also... your dog is at the bunker. I'm not sure when he was fed last, so we may want to hurry up." Cas takes a moment to admire how insanely beautiful Dean is like this, then kicks in the barn door.
"Only one way to find out though." Dean winked and walked toward the bathroom to turn on the shower.
“That's where I've been going, Dean. To all of the places you didn't cover your tracks well enough. Not one precinct has a record of you ever being arrested now, and no officers or agents remember your name. You're free.”
About an hour later, Cole checked in and Cas surfaced out of his room. “Cole? You’re not on duty tonight, why are you here?”
A weird look crosses his face. “Yeah, maybe a little. He uh... he helped somebody I care about out in a big way a few months back. Figure if I can help you both by pimping you out, then… why not?” Jask asks, shrugging it off as he tosses the ball again.
The lube was next to the couch, but there was no rush. Just sitting together sounded so enticing, Dean felt like a kid on Christmas. He set out a few blankets and pillows for them on the floor, and set up the scene to look like a winter picnic.
Dean grips his shoulders and slams inside, coming with a choked-off whimper as his face falls against Cas’ neck. “Cas... fuck,” he whispers.
She eyes him like she knows something is up but doesn't say anything beyond a cursory “thank you,” and Cas keeps up his ministrations until Dean’s knee jerks hard enough to hit the table. He pulls back as Jimmy makes a snide comment about Dean being a “bull in a china shop” and fixes his eyes on his twin brother.
