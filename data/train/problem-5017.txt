The sun was shining. There was still a nip in the air. Spring was on its way. Flowers were only just beginning to bloom, but a predicted frost would kill them all off for another week. Thankfully, inside his favorite coffee shop, there was a respite (turns out faux flowers were immune to frost). Their only florals were various ivies and succulents.
“I shall bring tea by in about an hour,” Jarvis said, interrupting his conflicting thoughts. “He should be feeling hungry by then.”
With just music playing to help someone guess at the pace of the plot and the mood of the setting, one really had to make a lot of inferences and pay attention. Overall, the plot wasn’t too exciting—it seemed to be a mashup of different plots from the original canon, set in the 1920s instead of something more Victorian. Tony supposed that was a trait of Sherlock Holmes: he could be adapted to any time period, depending upon what someone wanted to do.
What good were the counselors and paraprofessionals and administrators and detention officers or hell,
Did HYDRA really think this was a good idea? With all of the equipment and glass, this was going to get dangerous and messy.
“Great!” He moved the papers around so all of them were visible, checking for papers that had anything written on the back. “JARVIS, scan all of these and let’s figure out what is going on.”
Thank you all so much for the comments and kudos on the last chapter. They really made my day as they came in! I hope all of you are doing well and are being as safe as you can. I know this world-wide lock down is hard, and our lives are never going to be the same after this, but I know we can get through it. Hang in there!
. Letters that he had been writing over the last few weeks, carefully writing onto the special stationary he splurged on, and fully intended to give to him on some other day than this.
“We got a count of 200,” Steve replied. “They came from a central location—not sure if they’re a hive mind like last time.”
It was great to see the movies, to have a regular movie night with friends. To share snacks and make jokes and just appreciate a night in. It had been a while since he had taken the time to just … relax. Not focus on work or what he was going to do with the armor or Stane. He knew he would have to deal with it soon, along with the aftermath of the kidnapping, but he was happy to let everyone keep their distance and think him in a fragile state of being yet again. He wouldn’t have to argue against having to attend meetings or sit through overly long annual reports.
It seemed to have the standard fare, but he had no idea what any of the specials to the right of those were. Just
Steve impulsively reached forward and felt his forehead with the back of his hand. He didn’t feel too overheated, but with how he was sweating, he would need to be watched and drink plenty of fluids. He would bet his left hand that Tony had a slight fever. He probably worked too many hours and forgot to eat again, but why was he in this part of town? He should have been heading to the library or his tower, not here.
Especially when he had to excuse himself to cough up some gladioli while Steve got the last bits of a fern leaf out of his mouth.
Steve smiled like Tony had just made his day and went behind the counter. Tony watched, but didn’t try to figure anything out. It was just a thing of beauty to see Steve move and work.
“Oh,” Thor said, apologetic. He handed Steve his drink, which helped the slight burn in his throat. “I am sorry, Steve. I did not mean to cause this.”
A little over a year ago, he had gotten into an argument with a spitfire over who was better—Picasso or Monet—at a random museum trip to clear his head.
“The upper floors are going to be compromised too,” the sniper said. “I don’t think we’ll be going to the roof either, unless the bomb was localized to this corner of the building.”
It was soft and blue, unlike anything he had ever seen. Not even the sky or the ocean could compare. It shone on his hands and down his body, but he could not tell where the source was from. Not immediately. And when he suspected, he shook such a thought away.
“Ice cream does sound good,” Steve suddenly said, making them both jump. “Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you.”
Steve knew that the whole idea of courting an alpha (or an omega for that matter) was old-fashioned, but dating hadn’t worked so far, so he thought, maybe … maybe …
The debriefing that SHIELD insisted upon got tedious rather quickly. Tony told them everything from his end, Captain America told them everything from his end, and they collaborated on the part where they met up. The sniper, whose name he never got, was nowhere to be found. He should have been part of this super boring meeting too.
The two actors crept around the room, caught in some deadly, instinctive dance, just missing one another by mere inches and seconds, until Sherlock slipped into another room.
“When did you lose your heating?” Clint asked, already seated on the couch and watching one cartoon program or another.
A few people, proper lords and ladies really, stared at him openly as he stood in his working clothes and boldly knocked on the front door of a grand, rich house. Was it any wonder? He had soot and dust on his shoes. His pants were fraying slightly at the hems. He probably was going to leave footprints on the steps, which someone else would have to clean again. If only there was a patch of grass he could have wiped his shoes on or some sort of mat but—
“Stop the theatrics,” someone new said, tearing the bag off his head. “I know you have been awake for some time. You have something we want.”
The reports of various war-torn areas becoming worse, getting taken over by new regimes forcing people into their militias made him sick to his stomach, because there was more and more evidence mounting that SI was double-dealing. Tony knew that money and power was at the heart of it all, but figuring out how to end those chains and cycles was the hard part. He couldn’t simply throw money at the problem, not when it went deeper than that.
Today, there were a few kids absent, which meant lab groups had to be shuffled around, and Flash ended up in his. He had hoped that MJ’s proximity alone would deter Flash from bullying him, but … apparently Flash was braver than him or Ned. He bumped into him, rolled his pens off of the table, and almost spilled a beaker of water on his notebook. Peter shrugged it all off, more concerned with getting his observations written down than whatever Flash said or did.
“Yeah. These things take time. He’s been responding well to the changes we’ve made in his classes. It’s amazing how much an impact something like a different seating chart can have. I expect his grades to be much higher by the end of the nine weeks.”
so I could stay dry. Do you know how many omegas have assumed I should put forth all the effort into a relationship? How uneven those relationships were? I never feel like that when I am with you.”
“Yeah, I’m fine,” he replied, shoving some more of his sandwich into his mouth. That morning’s coughing fit left him exhausted and starving, because it made him skip breakfast.
But he supposed that was incorrect for most of the work force. There were plenty of people who did not get to sleep in on Saturdays. Most of them were underpaid too, which sucked, but he was going to have to tackle that social issue later.
Conversation faded off into other topics: how Tony was now a successful mechanic working on machines that made life easier for the masses and pushing for reforms in the factories so those benefits would reach everyone, how his father wholeheartedly disapproved and couldn’t touch him because he was a financially independent adult, how Steve and Bucky had been with each other through thick and thin, and now, they had made it to Paris and a life that was slightly better than living in the crowded slums of London with smog and black lung.
“Steve, thank you once again for introducing Shuri and Peter,” T’Challa said. “I know my sister would have been just fine, but I am glad she already had a support system here.”
“Hey, wait,” Tony said as he fished through his pockets for a moment. He grinned when he found a piece of paper and a pen, then quickly scribbled his phone number down on it. “Here, my direct line. So you don’t have to email me so much or set up so many meetings, even though those are top priority. It’ll be quicker, unless something does need to be formal and all that.”
Steve got a wistful look in his eye, just for a moment, before it was tucked away behind more pure excitement. “Kind of. I finally have the money to own my own copies. Now the librarians won’t chase me down for renewing something for the fifth time.”
“Shh!” one parent hissed as yet another student started to do a presentation about the 9-11 Terrorist Attacks. They had to be given props, though, for continuing on despite being the seventh student to do the topic. Students weren’t the only ones who had to hold back their groans. At least some more thought seemed to be put into it, with the long-term aftermath of the horrific event being the focus instead of the immediate response.
Tony jabbed his elbow into the goon’s gut and dropped down low, surging up and disarming him with a few quick moves. It was nothing formal, nothing he learned from a class or even a YouTube video. Just a lot of unfortunate experience.
He kicked at the ground, holding onto his canvases with two arms protectively. He knew they weren’t the best works in the world and he knew that the Académie thought historical scenes and religious subjects were more important than landscapes, but … But art was supposed to reflect life. It was supposed to capture what the people of that day saw and felt. How could he hope to capture something that no longer existed? Something that was now a forgotten ruin?
When the classroom door closed, Peter pressed himself up against the hallway wall, avoiding a heavily decorated bulletin board.
Antonius felt a blush creep up his neck. He nodded. His hands were sore from the work and there were a few parts of his cloak were now burned. He would have to make a new apron, one of thick hide and special oils that would protect him better, but now he knew the forge worked. The
“Well, gosh, sir,” Steve said, pouring on the charm and sarcasm all at the same time. “I’m sorry about that. I know Sam here wouldn’t have made a poor quality flat white. It’s his favorite drink! And I know Natasha wouldn’t have roasted our beans incorrectly, that would just mess up everyone’s orders! And I know I wouldn’t train anyone improperly to work in my shop, that’s just bad business. How about we throw in a free muffin and call it even?”
Steve turned around and stared at Tony. He was turning horribly red, the blush starting to go down his neck and beyond his shirt collar. Tony swallowed, feeling short of breath.
Tony shrugged, glad Steve wasn’t going to attempt to lie. “A lot of little things. Your voice, how you moved. You’ve got perfect runner’s form, you know?”
“Mr. Stark, we are going to need to meet with some more specialized professionals, but I believe that your son has ADHD.”
“How are you not cold?” Tony hissed, feeling a righteous fury in his veins. Here he was, dressed in layers—
Men surrounded them, each trying to land a killing blow. The hallway was narrow and long, designed for moments just like this. Not that Steve wanted to be in the position of the one having to fight for his life against dozens of enemies.
been put online, which was why he hadn’t come across JARVIS’ radar before now. Apparently, his mother had died in a car accident, leaving Peter to be lost in the shuffle of foster care, because no one believed that he was the biological son of Tony Stark. There had been a number of people who claimed their children were his before, but a DNA test quickly proved their claims to be false. It happened every so often, but …
And now Tony was immensely curious about this Mr. Rogers. He looked too clean, too All-American-Apple-Pie to be a former delinquent. There was no way. He had to have been a bookworm or some shy art kid who kept their head down and out of trouble.
“He did,” he said, having a feeling he knew why Peter suddenly ditched them. “The kiddo likes to keep me on my toes. But speaking of which, how has he been doing?”
a cappuccino and that the coffee shop was the quickest way to get anything decent, because so help him god, he was going to fire whoever ordered the swill that was in the breakroom at SI. That stuff was horrible. Why that person was not dead yet, he had no idea, because his employees deserved better than that. Replacing all of the coffee was going onto his to-do list, right after revolutionizing green energy and—
In a corner of the ballroom, hidden among some of the deeper shadows candlelight and champagne could not banish, a soldier gave her the slightest hand signal.
“As I said, sir, any deeper probing would alert the people who are monitoring the servers. Considering the delicacy of this investigation, I believe that it will be a wiser decision to physically use a computer terminal known to access the server regularly. With the proper credentials and timing, accessing these files will not appear out of the ordinary.”
melted away. They chatted over their burgers. He stole a few of Steve’s fries. Steve happily took Tony’s extra lettuce and added it to his burger. They joked and mused, asked ridiculous questions, and weren’t interrupted by well-meaning friends. If anyone recognized Tony for who he was, they kept their mouths shut. He had a feeling that someone from the paparazzi would print photos tomorrow, but he didn’t care.
“Very well,” JARVIS replied, selecting something at random. Given the amount of Disney movies that was in the archives, no one was surprised to see the logo sequence come up.
Tony smiled to himself behind his mug of coffee. From time to time, Steve and Bucky got teased about how close they were, but Tony knew it wasn’t anything more than friendship. Those two were like brothers. He got little bits and pieces over the weeks, but figured out that times were hard growing up, in school, and when they did their tours in the Army.
Steve gave him an unamused look and made a note to not make enough bacon for breakfast the next time that he was able to cook.
the armor. Pepper and Rhodey worried about him constantly, he knew, but that was nothing new. He did his best to keep on top of everything going on at SI, but … but he knew that it wasn’t sustainable. The plans no one knew about, would never know about, were going to cause some hiccups later on.
It wasn’t anything like what happened in the 90s, especially with some of the policies from the Bush Administration, but Tony had lost count how many times his knuckles rapped by a ruler or he had been dragged to the principal’s office for some teacher to complain about how he was so easily distracted and restless, how he didn’t follow directions, or got into arguments.
All the guard said was “don’t move” before he rushed out of the room, not even locking the door. Tony finished up a few things on the computer before heading out the door too. No one would find anything on the computer, or in a few hours, on any computer in the network they used. Closed systems were so nice in that sense.
“Sure, like someone would want an omega with all my medical problems to carry their children,” Steve snapped back, insecurities coming out like a flood. He couldn’t stop them, even if he wanted to, and he could see where this was going to end: them yelling at each other, their friendship torn to shreds. “Like I could even carry an alpha back to my place!”
Tony hummed, trying to keep it all in. He took in a breath and mentally recited the first fifty digits of pi.
The end of the meeting felt anticlimactic. They said their goodbyes, both sides expressed gratitude for meeting with the other, and soon enough, Tony and Peter were walking back to the car where Happy was.
Tony grabbed him by his arm and practically dragged him to his penthouse, telling JARVIS to clear his schedule and inform Pepper the moment they passed into Stark Tower.
Tony inwardly cheered, because who didn’t like coffee breaks? He was pretty sure that Pepper had not gone to the coffee shop yet, so he was extra excited. Unlike Bruce, she was absolutely unspoiled. He could witness a pure first impression. It was going to be like seeing a little kid watch
“Hey, hey,” Tony said, reaching out and laying a comforting hand on his arm. “It’s okay. Rejection sucks. Those idiots don’t know what they’re doing, sticking to tradition like they are.”
“You …” Tony finished swallowing his bread. “Should talk to Édouard Manet. He and his friends regularly meet up at Café Guerbois.”
and it would only be a matter of time before something horrible came of that knowledge, unless SHIELD did their jobs and stopped it. Telling Steve could only be a good thing. He couldn’t tell Steve about him being Iron Man, though, not yet. Not when there were so many threads dangling around them and he had yet to make a single knot. Not when too many people already knew, and while he trusted them with his life, he couldn’t afford the risk.
A month later, another heat came around, but thanks to an army of doctors, it was not as bad as the time before. A few researchers hounded Steve for test results, written testimonies of experiences and symptoms, and blood samples, but he chased them off with some well-chosen words. Honestly, his life was turned upside down! Tony laughed for about an hour. Thanks to having the foresight to bring out his phone, so did everyone else when they saw the video.
Did he hit his head? Was that twinge of pain in his shin or elbow? There was a huge clatter of metal, but he hardly paid attention, he had to protect—
“Oh, shut it,” Tony muttered, resigning himself to the green tea he had to drink now. Natasha seemed to take pity on him, because a basket of croissants was placed in front of him. He could tell from the smell of them that they were Steve’s. God, he could live off of those. He would happily succumb to scurvy and blocked arteries if he could eat them forever and ever.
“And then I’ll make my famous hot chocolate,” Pepper continued without missing a beat, leading Peter to the kitchen for the ice. “And we can put your father’s love life on the back burner.”
“Still, I’m sorry,” Tony said. “I know I imposed on you all, whether or not I knew what I was doing. I should have been more aware of my cycles, or had the mind to call a doctor instead of just knocking on your door.”
He glanced back at her and saw the intense gaze she was studying him with. That stare could learn the secrets of seasoned CIA agents in under two seconds. He was not sure where she got such powers, but the state department was forever grateful that she was on their side. Unless they were being idiots. Then she continued to use all of her powers for good.
As he realized the other world-wide implications of this horrible bit of history still existing, he concluded that needed to come up with a much, much better plan than ‘find a weapon’ and ‘get to an elevator’. There was no guarantee that he wouldn’t come across some agents determined to kill him along the way, but he would cross those bridges when he got to them.
“I’m sure you’ll love it,” Natasha said pleasantly to a young mother who was getting hot chocolate for her children in front of him. From what Tony half overheard, one of them was allergic to milk and didn’t seem to like almond milk that much. Luckily, the coffee shop stocked plenty of alternatives for people to choose from, but the girl still seemed a bit sullen.
Tony slurped the foam of his cappuccino obnoxiously. Rhodey rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t hold back a smile.
“Tony, if you wanted to ask me out, couldn’t you have done it when I wasn’t covered in pollen and snot?”
“As if we don’t make bad decisions or need to choose something like mental health over physical comfort,” a redhead sitting next to the sunglasses man added.
Were Petra and Actus alright? Would they survive Ovadyah and all of his cruel plans? What of all the other people he did not know intimately? They were innocents who did not deserve to have their lives destroyed or everything they worked for stolen.
The weekend it was brought up, over dinner and cookies, May and Ben had assured him that there was nothing wrong either. May, being a nurse, was even able to discuss what ‘wrong’ meant in the medical sense. It was a world’s difference from the definition that most people would ascribe to it—none of that philosophical stuff that left a bad taste in Tony’s mouth.
She gave a shrug. “You two might not look like each other, but you behave pretty similarly. There’s also a strong chance that ADHD runs in the family. His generation is more likely to have more people undiagnosed because it wasn’t understood as well back when he was in school.”
Sure, he knew he was famous. He knew that people recognized him instantly for one reason or another, but in the weeks that he had been coming here, no one treated him like some celebrity. No one stopped him for an autograph or tried to shove their latest creation at him or beg him for a job. Heck, no one even made a joke about him not leaving a good tip. Not that he didn’t, because in this economy and with the horrible wages everyone was being paid, he had to help out somehow. A ten or a twenty here and there really wasn’t going to hurt
Old and bitter memories were instantly stirred up. He hated that he wasn’t contacted the moment Peter’s mother had died. If she had told him, if he had
“Yeah?” Steve asked. Tony realized then that his tone sounded like he thought this was a crime. “It’s good for business. You wouldn’t imagine the desperate university students that’re in this area.”
Was the education system just that bad? Did Steve think it was just easier to go along with what everyone assumed and what society dictated alphas and omegas should be like?
Tony rolled his eyes at such a response. “Come on, turn off those Bambie eyes too. There’s no need for them.”
Steve watched Tony and Peter out of the corner of his eye. They seemed to be discussing something serious; their moods changed completely from the bubbly happiness a few moments ago to something with more eye rolls and obvious annoyance. He couldn’t hear, as he was focusing on other students and their parents, but he was still curious.
Tony grinned and rocked back on his heels. He was dressed casually, as he always did when he came to the library for one event or another. It was probably something with Legos, but Steve wasn’t sure how one got stuck in Tony’s hair. He probably let the kids have too much fun and hadn’t even noticed one of them got up to such mischief.
Peter winced, remembering how his dad threatened to bring in their lawyers and probably would have sent weeks ago if Peter didn’t beg him not to.
It broke his heart when Peter asked questions like, ‘I have my own bed?’ and ‘I can sleep in today?’ He wanted to murder the people who would make him ask such things, would make
They all were trying to assure Stiofán and Buk that it would be alright, but as Shem’el explained in a more colorful way, they were stupid.
He yawned and blinked awake. The sun was lower in the sky and Tony was no longer talking to a half dozen people on the computer. Instead, he was sitting down next to him and stroking Steve’s head.
For the last few visits, he hadn’t seen Steve at all. He was beginning to wonder if this was a once-in-a-blue moon sort of deal, but since he started coming here about a month ago, the rest of the coffee shop crew was starting to grow on him.
In front of them, Fury saw that all of his soldiers returned, more or less unharmed. Clint looked like he had jumped into too many hand-to-hand fights again. Natasha had a split lip, but he was sure the person responsible for that was dead. Rhodey and Sam dropped their metal wings off the moment they could, still out of breath from hours of flight. Bruce had a blanket wrapped about his shoulders, but looked steady and calm. Good.
Tony shook his head and pushed the marriage license forward. “No. I was trying to see if you’d take a hint and just ask me out. Or sign this before someone else whacks me over the head with a club and drags me back to their cave.”
Tony typed out notes on his phone to follow up on later as Steve talked, but the conversation had to be quick as he had other parents to attend to. Quite a few took the time to speak with him about general school matters, which was good to see. Sometimes the informality of a presentation, and the lemonade that was usually served after these events, made such meetings easier than the dreaded parent-teacher conferences. Tony hoped that the ones he would continue to have went as well as that first one did. Definitely life-changing.
Regardless, it was another late night and ideas were scrambling around in his head. He had spent the last forty-eight hours in the lab, fell asleep on the floor at some point, and noticed that he did not have any coffee. JARVIS, it seemed, did not deem it necessary to buy coffee for him to make, and as much as he loved DUM-E’s shakes and smoothies, they did not keep him awake.
. Not like you and me, platypus, but still, friends. Two, he wouldn’t do this to me. He has seen how much this sucks for others. He would rather jump on a grenade than put even a stranger through this flowery hell.”
There was still the threat of Warlord Schmidt coming back with more armies, as it was reported he somehow escaped the burning throne room, but they had dealt him heavy blows that night. It would take him time to regroup and by then, they would be ready for him.
He did not know what they meant, but at the moment, he did not care. He had found a new home. He had found people he loved and who loved him in return.
Steve nodded without hesitation. “Yeah. I just—I want to be invested, but I don’t want to get too invested. Is that weird?”
But, perhaps, a part of him wondered … the suffering was a slower killer than abandonment or loneliness, for hew might never know of Thrinacia’s fate.
When he came back, Tony was looking rather drowsy, but Steve insisted that he eat half of the bowl he heated up so he’d have something in his stomach. The heat of the soup also helped to clear out his nose and Steve now knew that Tony blew his nose like a bad trumpet player.
Tony and Peter sheepishly grinned. Then they proceeded to zone out, clapping only to be polite until everyone was
God, he had to stay awake. He couldn’t afford to lose any more time, not when people’s lives depended on it. Not when he needed to make an air-tight case against Stane and make sure the man never saw the light of day again. Then there was all the weapons he had to track down and destroy, not to mention the terrorist rings he had to blow to kingdom come, and—and—
Shem’el rolled his eyes and explained that Stiofán had been hunting with Buk, but he had slipped alongside a deep part of the river, losing many of their arrowheads and some of the kill they had managed to get. It was only a few rabbits, but they felt horribly guilty for the loss of the arrows. Buk had tried to retrieve any of them, but only got wet for his efforts.
The sniper nodded and turned around, heading down the hallway once more. They followed. “I got an escape route this way. Our backup is falling back now.”
Steve coughed again, and this time, there were a few sunflower petals. It wasn’t as annoying as it could have been because Clint sneezed some up as well.
If only he had the courage to voice those feelings. He was supposed to be an alpha, wasn’t he? It wasn’t unusual for an alpha to get tongue tied around an omega, but
Tony was not sure what drugs they used on him, but if he slept through an entire plane ride to Dallas
They waited a few days before telling everyone else, wanting to enjoy each other and their change in marital status. The judge, who needed more paperwork besides the license, looked at them with a critical eye, but found no fault with their ‘unusual courtship’.
“—and I don’t care about your medical problems, because I know you’ve been getting healthier since the university started that health program, and I swear, if none of your classmates have asked you to pose for them, they’re blind and shouldn’t be in art—”
“Are my eyes deceiving me? Is our baby finally all grown up?” Sam asked, pretending to get all teary-eyed.
Everything? The watercolor of the Brooklyn Bridge? The oil painting of Central Park in the winter? The other sketches and acrylics? The one superbly awful abstract that seemed to want to be a Pollock but missed the mark by a mile?
“I am going to get some water. In the meantime, I want you to think of five countries you haven’t visited yet, okay?”
Knowing Tony was deep in research and problem solving, and even though he was frustrated, he wasn’t reaching any sort of breaking point. Steve went over to one of the windows on the other side of the room and looked out over the city so he wouldn’t break Tony’s concentration.
Because no pure, sweet golden angel tried to join the army by lying on his papers … how many times was it again? It was probably a record.
, Peter would never have wanted for anything. He would have done right by both of them, whatever that ended up being. Peter would have never been shuffled from family to family, getting uprooted every time those supposed
That made Tony smile. Peter deserved to have vindication for all the work he put into studying and doing his assignments, even when his own brain seemed to work against him. He hated that grades were so important in their society, but as long as that was the focus of their education system, he hoped they would be a positive aspect of his school years.
“This is a load of—” a man wearing sunglasses indoor began, before a sharp look from their professor cut him off. He remained silent until she continued to lecture them. “—BS.”
“Oh my god,” she muttered in disbelief. “You’re a squirrel. Tony, we’ve got to figure out how this happened and how to reverse it.”
JARVIS reminded him—again—about the hundred emails he needed to answer and send off, but he pushed those away and pulled up his designs for the armor, getting lost in the wiring and programming. He was going to avoid autopilots for the weapons as much as possible, not willing to chance something going off and hurting someone unintentionally because of last second variables. There was too much that could change in the blink of an eye in a battle.
Tony could see his eyes going from the random pillows (one had the digits of pi all over it) to the posters and artwork on the wall. The posters were vintage, spanning all sorts of subjects, but the artwork all featured scenes from around New York. He had no idea who made them; they were all unsigned. Rhodey was falling in love with this place too, he just knew it.
Of the few people Tony absolutely trusted with every fiber of his being, Bruce had to be the one he connected to with the most. He adored Rhodey; there was no doubt about that. He adored Pepper just as much. How or why those two stuck with him through bad decisions, drunken parties, his years at MIT, or the horror that was the desert, he had no idea. He would never, ever underappreciate them or be ungrateful for their loyalty and friendship.
“I’m—I’m not going to shuffle them away,” Tony exclaimed, defending himself. “I’m purchasing them to fund their conservation and restoration.”
Stiofán once told him of some mines in another land across the sea, of a soft metal needed in the famous forges further into the mainland that were valuable for trade. The clan had some examples of it, along with other beautifully carved and decorated stone items, but they traded mostly for durable supplies than objects to merely be gazed at.
“I’m just being sure—but are you sick or is this a rut?” Steve asked, coming back. He maneuvered around the couch with a long extension cord and set the heating pad in Tony’s lap. He placed a bottle of medicine on the end table as well. Tony adjusted himself, looking miserable.
His voice didn’t go as deep as Sinatra’s did; it had a higher, airier quality. Almost a tenor, if his general speaking voice wasn’t as deep and rich as it was. The coffee grinder, as loud as it was, didn’t seem to drown out his voice at all. Or maybe Tony was just really listening.
Mr. Rogers started to smile, which was a red flag in Tony’s book. “So, would you say that you have a harder time concentrating in your classes where you do a lot of rote memorization, worksheets, and where there are distractions, like a window or friends nearby?”
Steve shook his head. “No. Because they’re suffering too. They … they think that for some reason, I wouldn’t want to be with them or even give them a chance. If someone likes me that much, but don’t think I wouldn’t even listen to them … that someone like me … they’re suffering more than I ever could coughing up dandelion fluff.”
He felt like they were going to open of their own accord and a lion would come to shred him to pieces. His initial fury and anger were now spent. The angry, biting words he had died before they even made it to his throat. He was going to denounce Tony and everything he stood for: privileged, upper-class idiots who were blind to the pain and suffering most of the population experienced every day, eras of oppression and unfair rule, strict societal standards that prevented so many people from leading the lives with the freedoms they should! He was going to proclaim that he would not associate himself with such a person, not when he—
Captain America shook his head, cutting him off. “I don’t know what people are like these days, since I was asleep and all, but I can say that not a lot of people would have done all you did in that situation. If not for them being so unpredictable, your plan to use the chaos of the fire alarm would have gotten you out. Your actions are commendable.”
“You know I’m not interested in Alpha Night,” he said. “It’s a stupid tradition that doesn’t do anything for anyone. We all know that even if someone got kidnapped, nothing would come of it. Everyone would go back to business as usual.”
“One of these days,” he said with a screwdriver in a corner of his mouth. He was messing with a new phone prototype, using another screwdriver to get a component out.
Since then, his life included a lot more arguments over design and art, cheating during various video game contests, group chats filled with inside jokes, and quite a few more friends as Steve’s social circle became ‘theirs’. It took them some time to pull their heads out of their asses, but when they finally caved in and admitted they had feelings for each other …
“Oh, I’ve been here before,” Bruce said as they walked inside the coffee shop. Tony was proud twofold: he finally got the hermit to come out of his mountain cave and the hermit came out on his own occasionally. “I like their teas. They have a nice selection without being pretentious.”
It’s always been my head canon that Steve was a bit of a bookworm and especially loved science fiction. The foundations of what we know as science fiction really took off in the 20s and 30s, so I think it’s completely fitting that he would have read a lot of the titles I mentioned. When he was sick in bed, there might not have been much else for him to do besides draw of course, but art supplies cost money. Pulp fiction, on the other hand, was wide-spread and cheap.
Not ten seconds after they got there, even with a perimeter check by the sniper, there was more gunfire. Glass shattered and crashed. Antennae smoked and crackled where they were hit. Captain America got the heaviest fire, hardly able to do more than shield them. Someone jumped Tony from behind, wrapping their thick arm around his neck. He gasped, struggling, as the sniper had to leap into the worst of the fire and take out the shooters.
, and they were still boycotting the Salon de Paris. Tony was still not speaking to his father and his patents were coming along as scheduled. They were all still poor, doing what they could to make ends meet, but there was a lot more hope. A lot more happiness.
Steve’s voice was cut off when Tony dove into the electronics of the Doom bot. It was a pity that the designs were solid—he was sure these robots could be put to much better use than destruction and mayhem. But, Doom’s lack of foresight would be his loss. How much more money and bad press could Doom handle before it all sunk?
The office was brightly lit with a window, decorated with degrees and certifications, pictures of students and school events, and other such souvenirs. The principal sat behind their desk, looking a bit tense and stressed. Tony motioned for Peter to sit down in one of the chairs available, while Flash almost stomped over and flopped into the seat. He wanted to hold back any judgements, but man, it looked like the kid was just mildly inconvenienced, rather than in serious trouble.
He weighed it in his hand, curiosity taking over for a moment. It was made of solid cast steel instead of the more modern aluminum, the patina deep and paint long worn off. The adjustment part of it was heavily lubricated and moved easily. It was tempting to take the wrench too, given that he lost the pipe he found in the supply closet, but he sensed that someone would miss it.
Steve awkwardly nodded. After a few minutes of taking orders, Sam and Bucky decided to have mercy on him and help at the register, the little assholes. Tony felt jittery the whole time, like one little thing would set him off. It was not going to be good. By the time Steve made his way over to him, Tony was pretty sure he was hyperventilating.
“I respectfully disagree,” JARVIS said. “Miss Potts is an excellent source of sound advice and I feel that my knowledge of such matters is insufficient to help you myself.”
Their arguments became legendary. Somehow, no one affiliated with the news or paparazzi got wind of the semi-regular meetings, but their friends all did. There was endless teasing and sometimes even larger arguments around cups of coffee and muffins.
? How did those people know he would be there? Even if it was just a coincidence, Tony had been kidnapped enough times to know that there were no such things as coincidences. Someone planned this. Someone leaked information about the test site and security measures and exploited it all.
Pepper gave him a single nod and helped him gather up the betraying petals before anyone else came in or noticed. She even opened the windows and ordered some coffee to disguise the lingering perfume.
“Peter,” Mr. Rogers greeted, looking up from his laptop. He took off his glasses, closed his laptop, and stood up in one fluid motion. “Mr. Stark, I assume?”
If it weren’t for Tony being able to use magic to visit him and help organize his escape, he would have gone insane in that barely lit tower. Even though he still felt guilty, and he would regret having to burn down his own capitol, Tony was right: someone else’s betrayal was not his fault.
Or if he was still very much like himself and would only ask for forgiveness after time had passed and SHIELD brought it up first.
“Oh, no. You don’t realize how mad Pep can get. She runs the company like clockwork and hates it when I throw a wrench in the machine.”
He tried to remember that Tony was no longer ‘Tony’ anymore, but try as he might, he could not forget the man he had fallen in love with over the summer.
Tony scowled, feeling a little affronted. Where was he going with this? “I’m not going to do something’ll help those snakes.”
“Nah, I run hot. Bundling up is just a habit from when I was younger and a breeze could knock me over.”
forehead. “Don’t do that again. We might rely on cartoon logic sometimes, but that stunt was just stupid.”
Bucky learned that early on in their friendship, but it spoke to how stubborn Bucky could be when he kept looking for him anyways and refused to let Steve wallow for too long.
“Like he’s got a cold and the flu—fever and chills, sore muscles, sound and light bother him, and he hasn’t eaten anything since last night. He’s been absolutely miserable.”
“On the house,” Steve said, smiling. “Or more like, please try the croissants I made and let me know if they suck.”
“Tell us about it later,” the sniper added. “It’ll probably be better than the debriefing that we’re going to get.”
She rolled her eyes, but then gave Rhodey a considering look. Not like she wanted to kill him or eat him alive, but more like she was creating a detailed mental dossier on him. “You seem like a caramel macchiato kind of guy.”
Tony was so relieved to see the data center. This high up, and surrounded by weather-proof glass to protect the communications equipment, he could see the clear sky and sun shining brightly.
“Stiofán,” the man with wheat hair said, touching his own chest. Then he pointed to the person next to him: a taller man with slightly darker skin and long dark hair pulled back with a leather string. “Séamus.”
He climbed up a long pathway that was barely obstructed by any rocks or lower ceilings. He wished that he could study the rocks, explore more of the caves … but that kind of dangerous thinking was what got him into such trouble in the first place. It became steeper, but the light guided him. It was steady, never dimming or brightening.
Steve loved a lot of things about Tony—he was brilliant in so many ways. He could pull a new invention out of nothing, could become an expert in a new subject overnight, and unless he was trying to prove a point or someone was being a jerk, never flaunted his intelligence. He noticed details other people would ignore, tried his best to be a good friend, and even when he was rambling and going off a hundred tangents, was just absolutely endearing.
Sam and Bucky were giving him identical looks when he finally turned around, after the door had closed and Steve was no longer in view. He probably had a neon sign above his head.
Tony found himself shaking his head. “No, no. This is … this is great. I could use a little more ‘old fashioned’ in my life.”
“Mr. Stark, thank you for waiting. My name is Agent Coulson,” an agent said, coming into the meeting room with a thick file under his arm. He seemed to be completely normal, with a mild smile and brown hair. His suit didn’t look designer and he didn’t even have any glasses to make him stick out either. He could probably disappear in the blink of an eye, only to appear somewhere else, ready to kick some serious ass with a bag of flour or a spork.
If Steve were to guess, his relationship with his relation was not the best. Maybe they clashed over artistic ideals. Maybe they clashed over more important matters like money. This man seemed to be doing well for himself regardless. But how did a working class mechanic get the money to fund an apartment like this? Steve wished he had that kind of luck.
Bucky and Sam teased him relentlessly, but there was a reason why he had a sketchbook dedicated to just putting Tony on paper. He loved the way he smiled, the way he threw his head back when he laughed. He loved how graceful his fingers were and the power in his shoulders. Sure, he was shorter and more compact than the typical alpha, Steve hardly cared about ‘typical’ when he could see Tony’s eyes light up when he figured something out. There were way too many times where he had to force himself to pay attention to what Tony was saying instead of just listening to the sound of his voice wash over him.
Tony laughed and headed down to a nearby diner that had good burgers. He was so thankful for New York being so compact and close together. If he wanted cuisine from one end of the world or another, all he had to do was go a few blocks. If he wanted culture going back thousands of years, he and everyone else were spoiled for choice. That there were so many places that were free for people to go to and enjoy gladdened his heart even more so.
Tony gave this ‘Mr. Thompson’ a stink eye and mentally declared him an enemy right on the spot. He wasn’t sure what kind of parental figure he was, but if he produced a child such as ‘Flash’, he couldn’t have been a very good one. Sure, he might be easily lumped in the ‘bad parent’ category too, but at least he knew Peter was an exception to the ‘an apple doesn’t fall far from the tree’ rule. Peter would be so much better in spite of anything Tony did.
Tony turned out to be in front of a computer with a number of windows opened up. Some of them were research, another one was scrolling with code, and more were various people talking just as animatedly as Tony was. He was raking a hand through his hair and had a few coffee mugs in front of him. Steve realized suddenly that he was smelling frustration. Interesting. Was that an ability all dogs had? Was that why animals seemed to be more sensitive to emotions?
She raised an eyebrow. “After you finally got settled into a new routine and are showing improvement with you accommodations? No way. You don’t deserve that. Besides, having Flash change a class or two so you don’t run into one another as often will show him that his behavior will not be tolerated
pretty sure about was that no one was looking this far up for anyone. Emergency response teams were focusing on the people who managed to come down and putting out any fires there might be. Police might catch one or two suspicious people, but as far as he knew, no one was looking for him here either. He was still a high-profile missing person. The people who did know where he was, well, why would they alert local authorities?
“So …?” Tony drawled. He knew his son was smart. He knew he had many original ideas and different ways of thinking. Sometimes the two of them got carried away discussing one thing or another and it led to Peter’s name having to be put on the copyright documentation of a project.
Tony knew that instincts were nothing to sneeze at. He was perfectly capable of controlling himself during a rut, but he still found himself on Steve’s couch without really remembering how he got there. He remembered Steve panicking and—
“Irene would have manipulated Moriarty from the moment she got captured,” Steve added, using air quotes.
The man grinned sheepishly and bent down to pick up the tools that must have fallen out of the metal container that was in his hand before they collided. From the amount of wrenches and screwdrivers, Steve guessed him to be a mechanic or engineer. “I work with a lot of people from a lot of places. You pick up things if you’re paying attention enough.”
No. No, he wasn’t in some grand house in Mayfair, one of the richest well-to-do neighborhoods in all of London. He was standing in the laboratory Tony had told him about, the place he loved best (besides being next to Steve, but that was beside the point). The place he wanted to take him to, to show off his inventions and research and discoveries. He was standing before Tony who was not dressed up in fine silks and velvets, a cravat up to his chin. This was Tony in a loose shirt and pants tucked into thick work boots and covered in soot and grease.
As he spoke, he went to stand outside Steve’s bedroom door. Everyone else followed him. It was a little crowded, but he refrained from saying anything. There was a chance Steve could already sense that they were there, and if crowding around a bedroom door helped them all worry a bit less or be ready should something happen, Tony wasn’t going to stop them.
Tony sighed and there was some shuffling, but apparently, he wasn’t focusing on melting two pieces of metal or something together.
Some of the concepts explored on the internet through photo manipulation were amazing. Just a simple shift in hue could convey all sorts of different messages and meanings, just like a brushstroke or different shade of green might on a painting. He really liked that so many people were able to express themselves artistically through this medium too, more than ever before. It did not take art supplies and wasted canvasses and ruined paintbrushes. The experimentation, the exploration, the lessons learned about lighting, color, placement … that was all there.
Tony dimmed his light. A regiment of soldiers ran past them, swords and other weapons clanging, not one even glancing their way or clearing the hallways like untrained squires.
“I would like to apologize for my son’s behaviors,” Mr. Thompson said as they made to part ways. “I know he can be brash and spoiled, but I was not aware his behaviors had gotten to these levels. We will be seeing that counselor and changing how we do things at home.”
But with the way that everyone else chuckled or showed some other forms of amusement, it was meant to be harmless and was not out of character for her. It made him want to be wary of her, but … But he didn’t want to be wary or suspicious of anyone here. It was not as if they were greeting him like some sort of king or deity, but as if … he was just a person.
Tony fixed him with an unamused look. “Come on. Something is going on, so out with it. Is someone teasing you again? Is a teacher being a jerk?”
But, try as he might, Steve didn’t seem to be very interested. Or maybe he was oblivious? Tony knew that he could be downright dense himself at times, despite his genius. Maybe he was missing signs that Steve was interested? Ugh, he was thinking too much and he was
“Choose your poison,” Natasha said, looking like she knew his darkest secrets and was still going to kill him. Despite her small stature, he was sure she could.
“I am afraid that Thor is off world and not available to be reached at the moment,” JARVIS said before Tony could ask. “He informed me of this two days ago. He should be back by the end of the week.”
That year, Tony planned to get some (semi-illegal) fireworks for Steve’s birthday. Clint and some random dude in Texas may or may not have been involved.
They all could hear some shuffling, but the door only opened a crack. With a gentle nudge, Bucky made everyone take a few steps back so there was defined space between them, Tony, and the door. Steve barely poked his head out, but they could all see how miserable he looked.
He sighed as he took a second swig of it outside. It wasn’t the same, for some reason. He knew, logically, that unless she used a different kind of bean, it would taste the same. This cup tasted flatter, like the beans hadn’t been roasted right or there was some sort of artificial flavor. There wasn’t even a cute little doodle, just his name written in an elegant script. Incorrectly.
If friendship was all Steve wanted, then hell, he wasn’t going to throw that away. Steve was a good thing in his life. He was going to hold onto him however he wanted to be held.
“Oh, for god’s sake, Stevie!” Bucky yelled. “His family has been in the business since World War II! I think he knows a thing or two about arms races!”
Down the hallway was another HYDRA goon, the one who had shoved him into the computer terminal in the first place. Tony felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He had no idea who this was or what he was capable of. He didn’t want to find out.
The weather in these lands was harsher. Winds blew hard enough to almost knock him over and his feet had never been so cold before. Buk, despite his strange arm, was able to make him a good pair of leather shoes that prevented mud or water from getting in. Fur left inside added more warmth than a woven stocking. Still, getting up in the morning proved to be difficult, when he was buried under thick blankets of wool and furs.
“Yes,” Tony said, nuzzling their noses together. “I love you. I think I love you even more now, knowing that what you were doing was just because you’re a good, kind person. God, someone would go over the top and attempt to make homemade soup from scratch, but having it on hand? Ready when I actually needed it? Like you said, so much better.”
“About ten minutes. She was getting a little worried but didn’t want to disrupt class again or make you feel uncomfortable.”
He took out a handkerchief and sneezed a few times, hoping the petals would come up quickly and end soon. In the end, there was a good pile of petals all over the floor.
events if he wanted to. Maybe he could convince Rhodey to come with him and distract Pepper with the Big Chocolate Show. It was worth attempting.
Steve rolled his eyes. “I’ve seen you work, and that’s just at the coffee shop. I know you don’t invent and create all of your designs there, so you have to work somewhere else all the other hours of the day. I think you just prioritize different types of work. Not to mention, you guys have computers to streamline so many tasks that we used to have to do by hand. We didn’t even have
Pepper looked unamused. “The phone will still be there when you come back. An hour. Get some food and then go to bed at a decent time tonight. If you keep this up, it’s going to be like last winter and you’ll be down with a cold for three weeks.”
“No,” an older man with a mop of brown curls answered. “I tried to get out of it, given that I already have a doctorate, but there’s no exceptions. Too many students have been flunking out and complaining of general anxiety.”
Pepper snatched the phone out of Tony’s hand, speaking a lot more evenly and calmly than he could manage at the moment. “We will be there in about ten minutes. Is there anything we can do besides call a doctor? Do you want us to call for an ambulance?”
The wallpaper was peeling a little in some places, but the kitchen he discovered was positively cheerful and lively.
The professionals at the school (and an outside psychologist, because like hell he wasn’t going to get a second opinion) agreed that Peter had ADHD. They also suspected that he had anxiety, but given what had happened in his young life, they were not surprised.
He cursed his luck and started racing up the stairs, sticking close to the wall in hopes that even if someone looked up, they wouldn’t see him right away.
“You can’t take those paintings!” he has yelled, the words echoing down the halls. “They’ve been in the museum for generations! You can’t just buy them and shuffle them off to some penthouse where no one else can ever see them! That’s just selfish!”
Yeah, that was a headline he could get behind. Pepper Potts finally having the resources and power to do whatever she wanted.
“Nataliya,” the woman with shocking red hair said next, interrupting his thoughts. Her eyes shone with something, like she knew his secrets. Her accent was a little different than the others, but maybe that was why her eyes shone. He knew of some people who could command the tongues of more than one people. Such knowledge often affected their speech no matter what they spoke. It was a great gift to have, to be blessed with.
Steve gave him a look. “Bruce is a good friend. I already know that. He probably got the letters I’ve been sending him. How the post office finds him, I have no idea.”
Sam was already kneading dough, Bucky was chopping up different fruits, and Steve had a clipboard in his hands while he checked through a number of cabinets.
With how things were last time, Steve was really surprised that they didn’t all rush back home to toss Tony out the nearest window or something.
But, come to think of it, no. Flash had not bothered him too much in this class before. He had no idea why … Maybe it was because the opportunity finally presented itself? Some kids joked that Mrs. Elison had eyes in the back of her head, but it was probably because she had been an elementary school teacher for a few years before moving up to middle school. With thirty younger kids running around with less self-control, a teacher had to be more observant. No one could get away with
Antonius had a feeling that if given the chance, they would have started a revolution back on Thrinacia and undone every plot and scheme Ovadyah came up with.
want to ask JARVIS. He was sure that the machine would frown at the number of projects he had added onto his impossibly long to-do list and all the coffee he guzzled. Not that it was Steve’s coffee. He hadn’t left the workshop in about three days and yikes. That explained that weird smell.
Lunch turned out to be a number of things thrown together: sautéed vegetables, good crusty bread with butter, a number of cheeses, and the tea that had been offered earlier. Sure, it was simple, but watching Tony cook was entertaining, because he tended to forget that he was doing one thing, before jumping to another, and mixing up all the herbs up. Steve had to jump in, nudging him away from the stove (which was a novel thing he had only seen in catalogues or back in his mother’s house growing up) to salvage their meal.
He looked thin and wane from his imprisonment, locked away in a tower like some sort of war trophy for nearly a year. It had been difficult organizing a coup when the person they wanted on the throne was literally inaccessible, but they managed it. The castle was in disarray. The true king was finally free. They had captured multiple enemies of the state.
That meant Tony got to witness something he didn’t often get a chance to see: Steve interacting with others that weren’t his friends. When the students ordered their drinks, he was warm and professional as always. But then the two arguing got a piece of cake silently slid between them. It seemed to mollify them enough to come to some sort of compromise and lower their voices. The other, who was definitely working on a World War II essay got some water and a short list of books Steve wrote down on a napkin. They looked like they were about to cry with relief and after Steve wished them luck, attacked their assignment with renewed determination.
. Broad shoulders, blonde hair that seemed to be a little too floppy to be completely professional, and he was wearing these glasses that were downright sinful! There was no way this guy was a teacher. He was too handsome. This
Earlier that evening, Natasha stood before Clint and dozens of others to go over the plan one more time. They all knew that this plan had risks; some of them might not make it back.
Inside, Tony was starting to freak out a little bit. One, Captain America saving them from a villain was the childhood dream of
“I’m not being coy,” he replied, finally breaking away from the doorway. He busied himself with putting away his things while sweating bullets.
Clint looked thoroughly chilled, his teeth chattering and the end of his nose red. JARVIS might put on a mild-mannered, polite façade, but he was Tony’s creation. Buried under the desire to always be helpful and keep Tony (and certain others) alive if possible was a lot of second-hand sass and deviousness that most did not get to see. Tony would need to get the footage later.
He was proud to be Irish, even if it was apparently a smear against his entire being, and they could denounce him until their faces turned blue, but he—
As everyone started talking about all the flowers they had been coughing and sneezing up, Steve smiled to himself. He was sure everyone would figure it out, but more or less, everyone had been thinking about everyone. Sure, their lives were really different. Sure, their schedules didn’t always match up. And of course they weren’t perfect by any means.
He couldn’t finish his sentence because the sniper shot him in the forehead with another gun he pulled out of his belt.
“I’ll … wait … over … here …” he stammered out, pointing to a corner by the counter as he went, trying not to stumble over his feet.
Therapy and medication were recommended as well. Peter had been very hesitant about taking medication, and Tony had suggested caffeine, but the doctor argued that research regarding caffeine’s effectiveness was mixed. Even if he took some sort of pill form of it, it would be hard to figure out how much his body could handle without there being negative side effects like migraines, jitteriness, and insomnia.
“Of course!” Steve took Tony’s hands into his. “This is about your health and safety! Just let me know if there is anything I can do, if there is anything I should know. I don’t think there will be much research on arc technology, but I can guess you don’t need to plug yourself in.”
I also happen have two screwdriver kits and an extra-long Ethernet cable in my closet because I am my family’s IT person. The Ethernet cable once saved my butt when the WiFi at my college was down and I had to do an online math test. The IT person there said it shouldn’t have worked because of security protocols on their landline, but through that cable, I got internet access. I am never, ever getting rid of that cable, just like I am never getting rid of the landline that is in my room, even though we have WiFi now.
He loved Steve like little else on this planet, but loving Steve also included worrying about his many medical conditions. Tony tried not to press matters or over too much.
Rhodey rolled his eyes. “You cheat on me with your machines every day. Now, come on, I want a real meal, not motor oil and caffeine.”
“And so, I sketch with charcoal and sculpt, instead of trying to work with watercolor. But that doesn’t make me less of an artist, right?”
“I’ll come and kick you around if you want,” Rhodey said, static marring some of his words. “More than happily, like back when I made sure you actually took your exams. As a matter of fact, you still owe me for that! I’m responsible for all of your degrees!”
He was glad there wasn’t a bell on the door to signal when someone walked in. He was able to just stand in the doorway and listen. For a moment, he felt that he was intruding on something personal and private, but he reasoned that he wouldn’t tell anyone. It would be a secret he would keep all to himself, something for him to hold onto in the middle of the night.
He enjoyed sex. Sex was awesome. He completely understood the appeal of sex in all its varieties and forms, but it only meant something to him when the person he was with meant something to him. Otherwise, it was just another way to please someone, bearing some hard lines like being a homewrecker or having sex when he really wasn’t in the mood or couldn’t properly consent, like when he had a few too many drinks. In a way, sex was kind of like gifts or money: enjoyable, sometimes needed, but ultimately, there were more important things.
Carved into it was the symbol also carved into his chest: a circle with lines radiating out, as if it were the sun.
Tony had no idea what day it was. Screw time too. It was all relevant anyways, a human construct to organize and make sense of their universe.
Tony didn’t get it. He was an alpha, and while not the tall and muscular stereotype that was featured on the covers of romance novels, was still beautiful. He also had a good positon at Stark Industries—the company he owned—and was insanely rich. He had omegas lining up for days for the chance to meet him and hopefully be ‘the one’.
“You have no clue?” Pepper asked, horrified when she saw a huge mass of tiger lilies all over his office’s floor. Tony was hastily shoving them into the garbage can.
Steve shook his head, his hands trembling a bit as he used a paperclip to keep the papers that needed corrections together. JARVIS was sending him emails as needed so they could be sorted electronically, but Tony had a feeling Steve would want to keep the originals and make physical copies of the corrected versions. Pepper would be so proud of that forethought.
“You know I’m not interested in Alpha Night,” Steve said. “It’s a stupid tradition that doesn’t do anything for anyone. We all know that even if someone got kidnapped, nothing would come of it. Everyone would go back to business as usual.”
“Ah, yes, I recall that. She is still grateful for your assistance and does not understand why she needed to take an art class whilst working on a science major.”
“I don’t know. Some people say he’s a vigilante, some crazy person that needs to be stopped before his collateral damage includes human lives and situations in some of these war-torn areas get worse. Other people say he’s a hero and deserves awards.”
Their walk down the hallway was quiet, uninterrupted, and completely anticlimactic. If only he could have left the place in his suit, blowing up everything as he went. That would have been
It was later in the day and to be honest? Being a squirrel sucked and was boring. There were only so many air ducts he could explore now that Clint wasn’t going to shoot him again, keyboards were nearly impossible to handle because of his limited arm span, and he had little luck inventing anything to help him with those handicaps because his screwdrivers were nearly as tall as he was. Forget about soldering or welding anything either!
“I’ve been turned into an animal,” he muttered. Going to the left side of his bed, it didn’t take him long to land on the floor and look at what used to be human hands. He quickly figured out that unlike some of the stories out there, like in
“How’s the gallery showing going?” Tony asked to distract himself from obsessing over who might be in love with him.
help, sometimes,” he said. “If I heard another bohemian rant on about living off of art and beauty, I would’ve punched you.”
“It’ll be fine,” she reassured him when he was lost in his worried thoughts for a little too long. “Some of these scholarships you can apply for every semester. So just keep those emails I sent you and we’ll write new essays.”
He had been drawing in the mud again, so absorbed in his drawing and calculations that he had not noticed someone approach him.
Steve tried to send him a smile, but it came out more like a grimace. There was so much that was his fault; so much that could be put at his feet.
But in this almost too-crowded room, surrounded by his friends and loved ones, Steve couldn’t find it in him to complain too much about flower petals.
(Tony had JARVIS order five of those fidgeting cubes for him. They were safer than the fidget spinners and certainly better than letting him pick at his fingers.)
Once it was confirmed that May and Ben would love to have them over, Tony put his phone away and gave Peter a tight hug. Peter buried his face in Tony’s chest, trying to hold back a sob. Tony hated that this wasn’t a problem he couldn’t solve with some grease or a screwdriver. He hated that this might be a long-term issue for Peter, but at least they had someone inside the school working to help them.
“And you two are annoying for it, and so are all your inside jokes,” another guy said, coming out with a tray of muffins. He had wonderfully dark skin and cropped hair, tall and lithe like a runner. This was not
Stephen Strange suddenly came into the room with two girls following him: one seeming to be in high school, the other in elementary.
The one pie that managed to come out okay was now on a sidewalk, getting washed into the gutter. The woman who ran into him was horribly apologetic, but he forgave her. The sidewalks were crowded despite the weather and no one could help gravity.
Ruts had downsides, just as heats did. Mild fevers, cramps, and headaches were common, along with the impulsive behaviors and tendencies to be more aggressive. They could be just as unpredictable and severe as heats.
“So,” Steve drawled, his cheeks flushing. “Wanna go see a movie? Dinner? And not just because it’s Alpha’s Night?”
environment where kids would be safe and accepted and have some actual stability and support, no matter how they were different?
Pepper had arranged the meeting, sale, and whole shebang, but Tony did need to actually see the paintings, shake hands with the museum officials, and sign the needed paperwork. He was just starting to talk to the curators when this tiny, skinny tornado of righteous fury came upon them.
“I swear to god,” Tony growled. “I am finding a cure. This wasn’t even needed. I think you’re wonderful. My stupid hang-ups should not affect you.”
Tony felt disorientated, but he had to focus. Focus. Blueprints, yes. He quickly closed his eyes (he was not in a cave, he was not wet, he was not struggling to breathe) and started to figure something out. There had to be some way they could get out of this mess without getting killed.
Other library patrons gave them both glares. The way one student gripped their pencil, it looked like they were two seconds from murder. Maybe they were. The first round of finals were coming up and tension was already starting to build.
Steve laughed, shaking his head and made him a regular cappuccino. “You will thank me when you’re not having an afternoon crash.”
He found himself longing for the intense sun, the dry dirt, and the forge he once had. He felt so out of place in a land without the obsidian he was used to finding along the ocean’s edge or knowing when the seasons would end or begin. Of course he could track the moon and the sun, but the skies were different—the stars were not in the same places as before.
Worth it enough to somehow get a perfectly preserved ranunculus flower settled in resin. If it were any bigger, it would be a paperweight.
Steve frowned. “I was going to congratulate him again for his speech. He must have practiced it a lot at home.”
for these two to trust him like this. Later, they would probably make a comment like how it was his plan and he obviously knew something they didn’t and while that was technically true … They still trusted him to not lead them into a dead end or something worse. It was a heady feeling.
He knew that Bucky was just teasing him, but he still felt his cheeks flame and something in his gut twist up a little bit. Okay, he knew it was a bit ridiculous, but—
But the suit’s power was finally online and he was now working out the last remaining kinks. He was developing a more streamlined armor design and thinking of what he might need in emergencies, beyond flight capabilities and thermal imaging. He was going to need a self-contained air system, emergency release valves, and … and …
Just as he was about to fall down and not rise once more, the tunnel suddenly … changed. The walls were suddenly made of large slabs of stones, arranged so they made walls. Smaller rocks filled in gaps in between them and many were decorated with spirals, circles, and other patterns. Above him was a ceiling made of stones placed in a circular pattern, gradually getting smaller until a final stone capped it all off. The air was cool, but everything was dryer.
No one seemed to want an omega who could cook decently enough, but couldn’t make a Thanksgiving dinner all by themselves and occasionally liked takeout. No one seemed to like the idea of an omega cheering loudly and yelling at the umpire during a baseball game. Apparently leaving clothes on the bathroom floor by the hamper was a grievous sin and not just an annoying habit that his roommates grumbled at him about.
He didn’t care if HYDRA was in control of this floor too, he could work with this! Even if they were evil masterminds bent on world destruction, geeks thought alike. They did similar work. They needed the same equipment. He immediately rummaged around in a cabinet and found a drawer filled with tools. Someone seemed determined to be well-prepared, because not only was there an extra-long Ethernet cable, there were two screwdriver kits, a multimeter, and … a solid iron pipe wrench?
Tony nodded. “Yeah. We’re going to have to look into all of that, see how much of a fuss the government is going to put up.”
Rhodey rolled his eyes and laughed, muttering something about ‘idiots’, but promised he knew what to do with the petals.
“It was a boring meeting and some of their stuff was wrong, Pep,” he complained. “Like, two days outdated and playing towards people’s fears.”
The horns and trumpets swelled, taking over, and Steve looked up then. “H-Hey,” he stammered, starting to blush hard.
Since reading some of the earlier comics, I have found out this is actually canon. You can imagine my absolute delight!
Steve laughed and fished through his pocket for his wallet. He easily flipped to a picture of him and Bucky from when they were kids, grinning like idiots as they were soaking wet. It was summertime and the water balloon in Steve’s hand explained it all. In it, there was no ignoring that he was skinny and almost a little gaunt, his pale skin already flushed with sunburn.
In a moment of unattached shock, he realized that one of the folders he had also grabbed that morning included the love letters he had written to Tony.
Sue him if he dreamed of the two of them kissing and whispering sweet nothings to each other more than he should be allowed. An omega was allowed to dream.
Did this guy jump out of a fantasy magazine or something? Was he posing as a cashier for a photoshoot? Because Tony was certain that men built like a Greek statue with a smile like that did not work minimum wage part-time jobs. Seriously, that jawline alone would earn its own Times photo spread. He looked wholesome too, with a short haircut and a simple shirt under his apron that did nothing to disguise his built physique. And those shoulders.
Today, it seemed that Bucky was either off or had some time in between classes and work. When he came home, Steve saw Bucky was lying on the couch, scrolling on his phone, the lazy brat.
He pushed his chair back and let the guard see his screen, which did have the algorithms pulled up. Not that he was helping them become more efficient or anything. Why do that when he could create a back entrance for JARVIS and scramble all of their data after he was done? His phone had been on him when he was kidnapped and JARVIS was harder to turn off than most. They would need to throw his phone into a volcano to fully disable him.
“Make a hole in that wall!” he yelled, pointing to the interior wall that now had deep cracks in it.
Steve had made the mother of all pillow forts: his curtains made a tent-like roof, stolen couch cushions made the walls, and his mattress made the base. Blankets and pillows from the rest of the apartment filled in nooks and crannies, making everything plush and soft. It was certainly a feat, given how small Steve’s room was.
Tony gave him a level look, because some days, it was like he was made of glass. Ever since his art finally took off and he got some gallery showings and people commissioning, his paychecks were finally a bit steadier. He could afford things like asthma medication now.
Steve glanced away, biting his lip, trying to hold back a smile. “I don’t know who calls the shots or made that decision. I mean, they didn’t change Bucky’s name either. He’d say I’m the one who caused most of the crap we had to deal with back then, so it’s karma.”
Looking through all of the cracked drywall and fallen ceiling tiles, Tony saw that while things were messy, there was not as much damage as he thought there was. The worst of the damage seemed to be under them, as if HYDRA’s focus was to destroy something else. Maybe there was something in a room on the floor below that they didn’t want anyone to get to.
The line was longer than usual the next visit, but that also might have been because it was a Wednesday? Maybe? Either way, the line was longer and he was running off of four hours of sleep. He prayed to all sorts of deities that nothing went wrong for the next one hundred hours. There were meetings, men in suits breathing down his neck, interns scrambling around for some reason and he was really, really annoyed that some simulations were not working despite hours of troubleshooting.
Tony clapped his hands on Peter’s shoulders, cutting him off from what might have been the beginnings of a nervous spiraling.
As he brought the cup up for a sip, he noticed something on the sleeve: a little doodle of a sun and some clouds in permanent marker. The sun had a smiley face on it.
A few more coughs racked his chest, causing some pain, until the flowers finally gave themselves up and landed on his plate: deep red gladiolas flowers with a white edge around the petals.
The man sneered. “That’s on a need to know basis, but you should be smart enough to find the errors in the code. But if you’re not or you do anything to sabotage what is there … we will know and you won’t be the only one paying.”
Steve gave Tony a wave as he headed out of the library, pausing only for some of the kids that were still lingering around to give high-fives, a few one-armed hugs, and the like. Seeing the joy on the kid’s faces brought out a soft expression on Tony’s face that Steve liked to commit to memory as much as possible. Then he was out the door, off to somewhere else.
Steve laughed and returned the hug, patting him on the back. “Hey, if I can’t use my powers for good, why am I a librarian? Now go study, I’ll make sure to renew it for you.”
Captain America handed his earpiece over without a word and Tony went to work with the tiny wires and circuits. Not bad SHIELD, but still. They needed upgrades.
Then, he saw that the conversation ended with Peter looking that mixture of embarrassed and ashamed. Not quite sheepish … but something else. Huh. He only ever saw Peter look like that when he put his foot in his mouth around classmates.
While T’Challa wasn’t among them in the class that started most of their friendships, he easily found a place among them after becoming friends with Bucky and Tony over a love of machinery and technology.
Okay. Not as thoughtful of a question as he could have come up with. People sponsored terrorist organizations all the time. People joined terrorist organizations all the time. Hell, most of the people who committed acts of terror, as the dictionary defined it, weren’t even in large organizations bent on taking over the world. They were just people who wanted to cause change of some sort and thought that violence and chaos was the best method. If they didn’t have some twisted, racist ideals pushing their actions in one direction or another already. He knew about those people intimately. He was only in the hands of such—
It was located along a row of older buildings repurposed into shops and other places for the public. There were different curtains and knickknacks in the windows of the higher stories, likely apartments of the people who owned the businesses below. For being in the middle of the city, it was kind of quaint.
“She’s an equal too, but she doesn’t live here. Something about socks and always-empty milk cartons.”
Sam was a cool, mellow kind of guy that made great ‘from scratch’ recipes, until Bucky got on his nerves. Then his snark came out in full force. Natasha still gave him murder vibes, but she thrived under pressure and he was pretty sure she was secretly a geek. She made too many subtle references for her to not be. Bucky was still a jerk, pulling everyone’s pigtails whenever he could. No one knew why he was kept on, but Tony supposed it was because he did occasionally provide decent customer service and excellent coffee.
As far as days off went, the one Steve had was going very well. He woke up early, went on his run through Central Park as always, and came back to the apartment to clean up and make a to-do list for the day. He fully intended to do errands, do his agreed upon chores, and a dozen other things he had been putting off lately due to an increase of events at the library. He even went to a stationary store and had gotten some nicer paper and envelopes to put his love letter to Tony in.
He let the silence linger, just glad that he wasn’t actually sick, that this would pass in a few days. It would be uncomfortable and odd, but at least the worst of it was likely over and most importantly,
The day that happened, the world would be dimmer. It would be without an amazing, wonderful, infuriating ball of righteousness. It would be missing out on a wonderful artist, a passionate friend, an idiot who liked to sing along to musicals off-key on purpose.
He tapped the table. “So … How badly did I embarrass myself? Or are we talking about never seeing you again because I was horribly inappropriate?”
“Then get to work, or we’ll have to verify that theory.” He stepped away and motioned to someone outside of the door. Another agent came to guard him.
Bucky undid the cuff of his sleeve and rolled it up so Tony could see where skin ended and metal began, running all the way up to his shoulder. After a second or two, Bucky pushed his sleeve back down and no one was the wiser.
It must have been impossibly early, because Steve was grinding a fresh batch of beans. Music was playing already, but it wasn’t coming from the speakers subtly hidden around the ceiling.
“My mom was from Italy, she could emphasize,” Tony said, memories of his mother bemoaning subpar olive oil or the lack of certain cheeses coming up. Not that it was ever too long of a loss, just sometimes a hassle to find out that one place in that one village didn’t have a phone and begging one cousin or another to make a run and send it through the mail.
The room they were in was a study room or something of the courthouse. Multipurpose, filled with old chairs and a table meant to stand up to years of abuse. Kind of musty.
Was Steve working on just the literature of science fiction? Or was he going through movies and shows too? Loads of people said they knew about movies like
It was the afternoon and Tony was back for a second visit to the coffee shop. Steve came out from behind the counter, wearing a leather jacket, keys in hand, just as Tony stepped inside. He must have had an afternoon shift, because Tony didn’t see him that morning.
Tony stayed with him the rest of the day, informing their friends and sticking around as the doctors examined him.
Sadly, a shower only woke him up so much. He really needed food and more coffee. Something to distract him from the ideas running around in his head, or at least, a better filing system. He hated it when his mind decided to work against him.
be asleep. Natasha wordlessly gave him a cup of something. He took a sip before he realized it was green tea.
Steve backed up only a little bit, as if he were still afraid to let anyone into the room. Yeah, Tony’s mind supplied, another alpha rut behavior: being paranoid about any perceived territory.
“Sure, sure. I gotta head out to another … thing, function. Whatever you wanna call it. We still on for lunch Wednesday?”
“Yes, this time. We’d appreciate the help, but you got enough on your plate at the moment. We’ve been working on reversing those policies and are making progress, though it’s slow.”
Or it was in Steve’s opinions, but he preferred the ideas that were coming out of Norfolk than the popular ‘neoclassicism’ that was gaining more popularity. It was just a bunch of ‘enlightened’ rich boys trying to recreate the Renaissance in his opinion.
When was the last time he had a low-key date like this? One where neither of them were after some sort of deal or trade agreement? Where he didn’t feel like he had to pull out all the complicated, over the top, and expensive shots to impress his date? When was the last time someone’s company and good food was all they needed to have a good time?
Steve smiled to himself as he made sure he had everything and put on his helmet. Some of his students were little monsters, sure, but he would give them the benefit of the doubt for a few more years. They still had time to grow. Peter, on the other hand, Steve knew that he was going to go off and do wonderful, amazing things. There were few kids who had that combination of being intelligent, compassionate, and always wanting to do their best. Tony had really done a wonderful job, giving Peter a home he could thrive in—
In the end, Flash got suspended and his schedule was changed so he and Peter would have a slim chance of interacting, if at all. It was also recommended that he would see the school counselor to find the root of his bullying behaviors and develop better intrapersonal skills beyond intimidation. Mr. Thompson was also furious to learn that Flash frequently threatened others with their lawyers to keep himself out of trouble or get what he wanted.
the alpha he was hoping to court! Who even had the time to go to a meadow and select a specific variety of flowers to present to their intended? Let alone in the middle of a city? Did the book expect everyone to drop hundreds of dollars on a single gift? He should have checked the copyright date—he knew better—but he was desperate and grabbed the first thing he saw.
Seeing no point in staying where they were and increasing the chance of someone finding them, especially when their ride was so close, they headed to the parapet that made up the 73rd floor.
It had been Tony’s first seminar at the library. The rest of the library’s staff had been mortified, but it ultimately resulted in Steve getting Tony’s cell phone number to coordinate another event. Knowing who Tony was, Steve couldn’t believe it at first. He had to be horribly busy with Stark Industries, literally managing a global empire, and doing so many other philanthropic events. He had hundreds, thousands of people clamoring for his attention and pretty much all of them were more important than some omega who worked at a library.
He yelped and spun around. The guard that was left with him looked furious, but he didn’t have his weapon drawn.
Maybe that was why everyone ragged on him; they liked a clean kitchen in the middle of the afternoon and evening too.
That was not something Steve had taught him back on the estate, back when—That meant Tony studied Gaeilge on his own time. He learned enough to say that. Knowing Tony and how much he enjoyed learning, how easily all manners of subjects came to him, he knew more than that.
He supposed it couldn’t be too horrible, as long as it wasn’t something like a rhubarb latte. That was a mistake Starbucks was never going to make again.
Heading down the elevator, he looked through his emails and text messages, sending off replies when and where he could. Some of them were quick fixes, others needed to be forwarded to someone else, and too many were more that were better taken care of in front of a computer. There were plenty of places he could dive into for a sandwich and be back into the office within ten minutes. Who needed a full hour for lunch?
Howard had used Steve to degrade Tony more often than not. As much as his younger self had adored Captain America, there was a knot of resentment not even enacting out a childhood dream could overcome. He was really going to have to work at it, because those words were not Steve. Those words really weren’t even Captain America’s. They were Howard’s baggage.
“Sorry,” he murmured, grabbing a sheet corner and handing it to him like a tissue. Steve gave him a watery glare. “What?”
An annoying voice commented that it wouldn’t be ‘just a crush’ if he was calling Rhodey in the middle of the night about it.
There was also Ioanna and d’Arcy, who would continue to the northern lands in search of a man who had made promises to Ioanna. They would also look for their families, strange events having taken them far from their homelands.
“The oracle also said that you were beyond the realms of our gods,” Actus said. “That other gods had marked you.”
Bucky looked at them for a long moment. Tony and Peter were covered in various mechanical oils and surrounded by tools, cogs, and wires.
“Stark! Come on! Do you know how often squirrels get in here? It’s a legitimate security—oh my god that got cold fast!”
“Did it feel like they just dropped the whole ‘blackmailing the prince’ thing?” Tony asked when the movie had ended and they were heading to the exit of the dimmed theater. “I think the girl might have had more to say about all that and the death of her sister.”
He remembered Natasha standing up for him once, telling everyone to give him a break, he was still only in his twenties. Of course he would screw up a little more often, on account of his frontal lobe not being fully developed yet.
The living room of the apartment was standard fare: a couch, an ottoman, a low table with random coasters on it, a plant in the window, and a television. He saw some pictures in frames on the wall, but he didn’t want to disturb anyone by wandering around to look at them. Going towards the only door that probably didn’t lead to a bedroom, he found a flight of stairs. If memory served right (he hoped it did), these were the same stairs Steve helped him walk up when he was half out of it from insomnia and too much caffeine.
“I’ll get a doc on the line when I get there,” Tony said. “But you know what to do best. Just try to that. Fluids, aspirin, whatever.”
Eventually, Tony made his way to the kitchen. Natasha was at the breakfast table, reading a book with a cup of steaming tea. She probably just sat down.
It was a much better living situation than being stuck in a mortgage with an abuser who was only looking for someone with ‘good genes’ to make more alphas with. As if they could predict what designation their children would be. Thank god they never made it that far. What would have happened if a child of theirs had chronic asthma? Or never bulked up like Steve did?
—a son he had never met before, a son he had never been given a chance to know. He was a mess, had been for years, even after he cleaned up his act and shut the weapons division of SI down and worked on becoming sober. Would he have done all those things to change his life and SI around sooner if he had known? Would he have been mature enough to handle it? How else would the world have changed if he had known?
“Thanks,” Peter whispered, hugging the oversized presentation board to his chest. “I can’t believe that was only five minutes. It felt like eternity.”
He had only a few options: flee, continue to argue, or flee. He could do it. He could point at something and make a break for it. He could toss his book in Tony’s face and run. He could reference tons of research reports and interviews about alpha and omega dynamics in their society and prove Tony wrong (if that were possible). He could stick his fingers in his ears and pretend not to hear Tony for the rest of his life. He could move to Timbuktu.
Mutely he stood up and headed over to her. She led him outside of the classroom where the hallway was blissfully silent and slightly warmer. Flash wasn’t there either.
Ah, clarification. Yeah, that was something Tony was working on, but thank god Peter liked to ask questions. “If he touches you, like hits you or pushes you into a locker, or takes your stuff, anything like that. Words can hurt, but you can develop a thick enough skin. The moment he does anything else, I’ll—”
It was a nice flower, he supposed, with its small white clumps. One website said that it meant ‘inspiration’, but god knows what the context of that would be.
It was not all bad, though. What they grew and gathered was enough to sustain them and they were not wasteful of anything they came across. Their livestock were hardy and healthy, giving them good wool for their clothing and meat when there was surplus. They all worked together, sharing the work as equally as possible, and came together around the fire every night to break bread and share stories with one another. The friendship and love they had for one another, despite not being related by blood, reminded him keenly of Peperi and Actus.
“No, I didn’t!” Peter protested. “I tried to get my book back, but Flash held it over my head! I tripped and fell onto him! That’s when he punched me!”
He continued to stare at his shoes, feeling like he did when he was younger. When he was scrawny and sickly. When everyone was worried he would die any second. When everyone underestimated him and thought he wouldn’t amount to anything. No one wanted to invest in him back then either, besides a few people he still respected and loved.
The strange contraption was suddenly turned off, instantly cooling the room a few degrees and leaving silence in its wake.
When he woke once more, he could still not see. Water was still dripping from somewhere in a steady beat, the light sound echoing throughout the cave. He was still shivering and huddled somewhere. His chest ached and burned. There was now an unfamiliar weight upon it and …
Online, someone suggested writing love poems or letters to their intended as a romantic gesture. Creativity and originality was encouraged, of course, as plagiarizing love letters was a long-time gag in romantic comedies. It wasn’t a bad idea, Steve thought.
Tony’s unamused, deadpanned look turned to something a little more curious. “Are you attempting to court someone?”
He thanked every deity out there that he didn’t cough up the spines, just the flowers of a cactus. It was a little rougher than other flowers, but still, god, that was close.
Tony sighed and looked back at his monitors and keyboards before his stomach let out a faint gurgle. Tony probably couldn’t hear it like Steve could, but he likely felt it.
Tony looked up from his current project: two pieces of metal being melted together by something capable of keeping a steady flame lit. Steve had never seen anything like it. It was like a giant can with a candle sticking out of the end of a hose. More importantly, Tony was lifting the metal plate that was protecting his face. He was sweating, his face flushed from exertion and heat, but his eyes were bright and alert. He looked handsome and alive and—
“No! I am going to rip their lungs out and give you a transplant and then beat them with a large stick and rake them over coals and—”
“Yeah, that was from my USO days,” Steve said, voice heavy with emotions Tony couldn’t place. “You had to know some ballet, and keeping upright helps increase forward momentum. The girls trained me worse than any drill sergeant.”
, Rhodes. He bakes. He’s … he gets these little twinkles in his eyes when I make him laugh. Other people make my coffee and it doesn’t taste the same.”
“Darling, you are amazing,” Tony said, his whole demeanor turning into something softer. “Whoever you courted before me didn’t know how lucky they were. The take out, the coffee runs, giving me your scarf … All of that was so thoughtful and natural, so much more meaningful than grand gestures and bunches of flowers.”
“Hey, hey,” Steve said, worried at the panicked tone Tony’s voice took on towards the end. “It’s okay. I needed that information. Now I can help you through this better.”
Steve chuckled and smoothed his hair. “I’m not. Ma sent a batch over yesterday. It’s still in the fridge, so it’ll be ready in a few minutes. That’s even better.”
How long had the darkness claimed him before he awoke? Had someone ventured into the caves to bring him out to the land of the living again? Was he being punished here and now for defiling the realm of the gods?
Taking the lead, Tony took them outside and around the corner, where it was a bit quieter. Hopefully, the area wasn’t bugged and no nosy neighbors were going to listen in. There was a small bench marked as a bus stop, and Tony sat down. Steve hovered, before sitting down too. There was about a foot of space between them, and it felt like a gaping chasm.
On all the tables were small mason jars filled with sunflowers and autumn leaves. They were probably fake, but that was alright. The arrangements added pops of color and cheeriness, but because they were all the same, didn’t add to the chaos that made up the décor already. It was kind of soothing to have something consistent.
Any fondness he felt for Tony disappeared when he coughed up ranunculus petals for the rest of the day. Gathering them into an envelope, he passed it off to Rhodey when they met up for a history class they shared.
Tony rolled his eyes, scoffing, and went back to his suit designs, while secretly enjoying Steve’s reply. Eventually, someone was going to kill Bucky. He needed to have plausible deniability when the cops showed up and asked anyone if they had seen what happened.
He knew he was a vindictive, sarcastic little shit who got into too many fights. He was mouthy and hated traditions that were caused by the differences between alphas and omegas (especially things like wage gaps) and was barely fit for maybe carrying kids someday.
“More tests, certainly. While all teachers get training and education about learning disorders and other disabilities, I am by no means an expert. I cannot give a diagnosis. I’m actually shocked and disappointed no one else has spoken up for Peter before now.”
were now faded, but the rest of the cover was very telling: a large golden throne looming in the background and shadowed hands holding up swords, spears, and daggers. He was more than halfway through it and Tony bet Steve spent every spare minute devouring another sentence, too excited to put it down for very long.
Tony’s cheeks were unusually flushed. “I—uh. Sorry, this is weird. Totally weird. I happened to be nearby, but something’s come up? Could I crash on your couch for a bit? Something’s come up and—uh. Sorry if this is weird. Did I already say that? I think I did. No?”
“They had me work on some algorithms, but I just used it as a chance to hack their systems and get myself out of there,” he said. “I also had JARVIS copy their servers.”
Of all the clan Antonius spent time with, he found himself by Stiofán’s side the most. There was something about him that drew Antonius to Stiofán and kept him near.
, but other times, he mourned the loss and wondered what happened to the people who worked there and owned it. Where did they go?
There were some rough patches and there likely would be more in the future that weren’t related to being an alpha or anything else. There were going to be many more moments—celebrations, arguments with customer support on the phone, nights where they tried to kill each other over a board game, and everything else in between. But he knew that Tony would be there for him, and he would be there for Tony in return.
Apple pie was a classic; a favorite for most. He figured his Ma’s recipe would be a safe bet as well. Something like this needed a personal touch, especially when it could go a little wrong. He wasn’t a great chef or baker by any stretch of the imagination, but he could follow directions. That apparently was the whole trick to not burning down the kitchen every day.
When the guard was finally on the other side of the room again, where the door was, Tony went back to hacking the security camera feed. He didn’t need a physical door to escape.
“Not a problem. The fire alarm sent a lot of people packing, but I’m not sure how many of them were … civilian workers of HYDRA or how many agents stuck around. I was hoping to sneak out to the ground level by using the elevator or crowds as covered.”
Tony felt himself flush. “Uh. Thanks. He’s fidgeting a lot less and is keeping track of his things better. We’re still doing the phone reminders and the planner has helped too. He writes things down and checks them off as he goes. Sometimes he forgets to check it, but we’re working on making that part of his routine in the mornings.”
“Indeed, sir only has slight scorch marks on four percent of his body,” JARVIS supplied. “I predict that his fur will recover in a few weeks.”
“Think we should send a thank you card to our old professor?” Tony asked, giving him a mischievous grin. “She’s the reason any of us know each other in the first place.”
Stiofán smiled. “Yes. Lugh, the many skilled, the oath maker. The chooser of kings, the warrior who commands the spear. He is a god of many things, but above all, skill. Like you.”
Whispering some words, Lorna placed her hand on Steve’s head. In a flash of light, Steve was transformed to his human form, thankfully with clothes.
Peperi, Actus, and Petros had already added their handprints in a bright yellow color that matched well with the reds, whites, and oranges of the other handprints. Morgan had giggled when her hand was dipped into the paint. Hers was a little smudged, but it still made him smile to see it, so small among everyone else’s.
Mr. Rogers winced. “Some parents are more difficult to communicate with than others. But as long as we support Peter as much as we can, Flash will eventually quit. Bullies generally do, once they no longer get anything out of it.”
Tony inwardly scoffed. Unless he was at gunpoint the entire time, he was not going to do anything for them, whoever they were.
Some people were correct in assuming that he couldn’t ever reach the levels his father’s obsession went. Those people had no idea how right they were. When it came to Captain America, Howard not only collected and held onto everything he could find—including anything that might have belonged to Steve Rogers—but he kept tabs on everything too.
Tony laughed. “I did get punched a few times for those kind of speeches, to be honest. I deserved it, though, thinking that idealistically and simply.”
“You are correct in that magic is the source of this change, but if I were to accelerate this spell, it would cause physical harm to you. It would be better to let it run its course.”
His joints were starting to wake up, which meant that they were protesting very loudly at the abuse he had put them through, and the same went for his eyes and neck. However long he had been working had done a number on him, which meant he likely needed to apologize to Pepper (again), Bruce and Rhodey for a million different things, and catch up on work that had fallen by the wayside. That would be another work binge in and of itself, but …
But he thought that no one knew him here. He thought that he was finally a member of the nameless masses, only recognized because of shared jokes and repeat visits. Was it too much to ask that he was just ‘Tony’ instead of the largest technological corporation ever?
Thor laughed loudly and sat down, a drink already in hand. “I do not see why she complained. It was a challenge for Jane. Not everyone has the same skills.”
Tony sighed and pressed a kiss to his temple. “I still love you. I’m still only interested in you. I still don’t want to do anything you’re not interested in. Not having sex isn’t a deal breaker for me. You being an alpha doesn’t change my feelings for you, though it
Sure, he didn’t get preferential treatment, but this wasn’t some exclusive club. It was … it was the coffee shop. It was a million times better.
Steve turned and fixed his best ‘Disappointed Captain America’ face. Clint remained unaffected, only extremely put out by Bruce betraying him.
Tony sighed. “Yeah. I’m probably obvious about it. But it’s not a good idea. I’ll admit it, I got a crush on him, but I don’t know if it’s from being star-struck because of what he did for you, or if it’s because I like him beyond his capacity as a teacher.”
Steve made a move to continue on, but Tony grabbed his arm, stalling him, even though they needed to pick up the pace. It would not be long before their escape was discovered and they would recognize the main battle as the distraction it was. “It’s not your fault.”
Even though Peter was a certified genius, he was still sixteen years old and in college with a huge guilt complex. There were times they all wanted to shake him and assure him he could come to them for
“You guys good?” the pilot asked. His voice sounded familiar, but Tony couldn’t place him. He was going through an adrenaline crash now that he was safe.
“I could ask if they cater,” Tony said. “I’m a regular. I bet if I begged enough, they would, just to get me to shut up.”
Steve must have dozed off again, because he suddenly smelled lab chemicals, dust, and hot dogs—before he blinked, Peter had flopped onto the couch with a deep sigh. There was also a thick cloud of something stagnant and sour hanging over him. Steve recognized the frustration from earlier, but if the bags under Peter’s eyes were any indication …
“Maybe something is finally going to be done about him,” Ned said with hope. “I mean, I heard Mr. Rogers spoke to Flash and his parents, but nothing came of that. They threatened to bring in lawyers!”
“They’re my air vents,” Tony quipped, skittering down the air vents some more. He always wondered why Clint liked to go through them, popping out whenever it was most inconvenient for everyone else. Sure, someone might say it was for security purposes and because it was a convenient way for a stealthy spy to go around unnoticed. That was a valid response. But Tony knew deep in his heart that Clint secretly hummed the
First, he was apparently ‘too alpha-like’: too tall, too muscular. His shoulders were too broad. His hands were too large. While people apparently drooled over his hip-to-waist ratio and jawline, it was always at a distance. Anytime someone came closer, they discovered the second reason: he was nothing like any of their fantasies. He was too brash, too opinionated, and too stubborn. He wasn’t meek and he really sucked at being domestic and comforting.
“See? Now, I can only imagine that this really sucks right now for you, but I know you can rise above all that.”
Peter bobbed his head. “She’s a sixteen year old girl from a small town yelling back at a monster that can rip her throat out. Yes, it’s a good part.”
He really was cursing himself. If not for this happening, how long would they assume Steve was an omega? No wonder over the counter suppressants never seemed to help him. The moment Steve was back to being himself, he was going to insist he go to a doctor and get the works: allergy tests, heart examinations, blood tests, all of it. He couldn’t stand back and ignore the issue any further. Not when they could easily have prevented all this.
Oh, damn—what kind of dirt did Bucky have on him? What kind of annoyances could Sam and Natasha rant about? Natasha probably had all the juicy stuff.
Rhodey snorted, interrupting his thoughts. “Look, Tones. Let’s keep this short and simple: feelings of attraction are natural. People have them all the time. It’s totally normal to find yourself attracted to someone cute and funny. You don’t have to let it get to your head.”
“Tony,” she repeated, laying a hand on his shoulder. She started to rub soothing circles into his back when he flinched. “JARVIS called. He said you weren’t responding. What’s wrong?”
The courts were suspicious, the social workers gave him the stink eye, and the people Peter had been assigned to just … They gave him the creeps. He felt like he needed to kidnap Peter and never let anyone come near him again, but that would be illegal and not help
“We all good?” Bucky asked, the living room turned into a huge pillow fort, complete with fairy lights artfully arranged and a number of floor pillows and bean bags strewn about.
Buk battled furiously against another tribe that had risen up from the sea with the intention of destroying his home village, which included Stiofán and a number of younger sisters. He lost an arm, but the gods were so impressed with his bravery that they restored it to him in a way that he could never lose it again. They called the metal
Tony’s flower had always been a little unusual. Instead of the double petal variety florists often used for weddings, his were the older and more traditional flower, most commonly known as a buttercup. Everyone knew what a buttercup looked like; it was a common flower all around the world and considered a weed, especially because it was poisonous to livestock.
Resin jewelry were used for all sorts of reasons: signs of friendship, good luck, milestones reached in life. Sometimes … sometimes they were used for romantic intents too.
Everyone in the classroom jumped. Mrs. Elison was not the kind of person who raised her voice often. When she needed to get the class’s attention, she tended to do something like a clapping pattern or flicking the lights. She also had a few sounds on her phone if those did not work. Even when she
“I’m not sure if anything will happen. All of my attempts have gone wrong so far. All those pies I made? Not one made it to him. He thought the love letters I wrote were fiction. Plus, he might not even be interested. He would have caught on by now, right?”
“Tea can be pretentious?” Tony asked in disbelief. Aunt Peggy taught him that there was good tea and bad tea, mostly depending upon how someone made it, but tea was never
“It’s alright,” he said. “But next time, you’re going to double check your textbook list before classes start, and long before the first test, right?”
Steve let out a deep breath, his shoulders sagging. Tony hadn’t noticed how tense he was still holding himself until now. “And you?”
“Hey, I got an idea,” Tony declared, his mind buzzing with schematics and possibilities. He fired a few blasts, which weakened a panel on one of the robots. “I always wanted to do this!”
He quickly left the building before she could drag him back. It was a quick walk to the place, if he kept his pace brisk to go along with the rest of the crowds, and he could see himself making this trip occasionally, if the place was worth a second visit.
Over the next two days, he worked on a drier patch of dirt to sketch out what he wanted to create. Pictures seemed to convey what he was trying to express more than his broken sentences. He begged and pleaded to the whole clan, explaining over and over again the reasons why he should be allowed a forge. It would take up a huge amount of time and resources to build a forge, let alone maintain one, but his creations could provide them with additional means of trade and income, or at least some new pottery to better protect their grain.
Tony laughed, throwing his head back and revealing that neck Steve wanted to bury his face in. Preferably at home. In bed. With no one else around.
The scents of coffee and baked goods wafted over him the moment he opened the door. It had the typical architecture of the area: wooden floors, exposed brick walls, and tall, thin windows. Morning sun was already starting to stream in, but by the afternoon, the entire shop would be flooded with golden light.
Half of anything good or wonderful humanity created or accomplished was because of strife and adversity. Hell, computers were created to defeat the German code machines.
He rushed over to then, crashing into Actus with a tight embrace. There were more shouts and confusion, but all of that faded into the background. Besides Actus and Peperi, who seemed to be healthy, there was also Petros, one of the younger servants of his former home. He had grown another
His desk, dresser and bedframe were all pushed in front of the closet, which made getting a fresh towel and pajamas almost impossible.
It was tense when they first broke up some months ago. Jane and Thor clicked in so many ways, except when it came to work and family expectations. Thor’s father expected him to take the reins of the company, much like Tony, while Jane lived and breathed outer space and not much else. Time did its thing though, and soon enough, they were on friendly terms again.
He knew that Stane was responsible for his kidnapping. He’d known that Stane was responsible for weeks now. Why was it hitting him this hard
Mr. Thompson nodded, then looked to Peter. “And I am sorry about your book, Peter. I hope it gets repaired soon. I know it cannot be replaced.”
This wasn’t designing something for SI. This wasn’t something to keep his mind off his trauma and other worries. This wasn’t an excuse to blow off another board meeting or convince the military and hundreds of others that yes, SI was truly pulling out of the weapons business.
Pepper opened a video call a few moments later. “Tony, what does JARVIS mean by you’ve been turned into a squirrel?”
required so much heat and skill to work with, and sometimes, it was still brittle because of the impurities that were in it. Then there was the fact that wind and rain caused it to flake and turn. But if the cloak pin Nat had was any indication of what could be created with this new metal, then the things
Tony felt dread swell in his chest and start to close in on his throat, but he forced it down so he could call Bucky.
He had JARVIS analyze text messages and photos, look through emails, and just about anything he could reach online, even stuff he was not supposed to have access to. When JARVIS, his wonderful, beautiful, snarky creation couldn’t find anything, he went manual. He scoured his contacts and made lists, thinking through every interaction he could possibly remember.
“My friends!” he cheered back, raising both arms, which had more drinks and snacks. “What are we watching tonight?”
“Didn’t they say it would end by this afternoon?” Steve asked aloud. He knew he checked the forecast before leaving that morning, but it could have changed since then.
Tony stared, awkwardness starting to creep up his spine. Steve looked just about as mortified as well, as if he had no idea what was going on either. Silence stretched on. Thank god no one was in line at the moment, a rare lull, or he was likely to blurt out something stupid or spill his coffee or do something even more stupid that would get him banned and then he would never see Steve again or hear Sam and Bucky bicker or get half-threatened by Natasha—
Peter hesitated. Tony could see the gears twisting and turning in his mind as he processed everything. This was big for someone his age. There were going to have to be more discussions, more than one research binge with some power point presentations for Peter to be shown, and Tony could see the two of them in a lot more meetings in the future.
And he really, really wanted to be the kind of person Tony would want to date. It was too much to hope Tony would want to court him or do anything beyond courting, but he could dream.
“They are real,” Antonius said. “It is just that knowledge of how to make them has not reached these lands yet. But I can make it. I have done it before.”
“Our pilot,” Tony realized. Well. That was something he hadn’t expected. He thought Clint was just another regular, though he didn’t see him as often as some others.
Next to him, Tony gave him a flash of a smile. It was hard to see in the darkness of the tower they were in, but that was Tony: always bright.
Peter nodded. “It’s okay. I think the medication is helping a lot. It took a little while to adjust to, but when I take it, it’s like my whole body calms down. I’m not as distracted anymore by little things and I can focus on the stuff that would usually bore me.”
“In pieces,” Clint answered. “We gathered them all up, but let me tell you, I saw parts of you I never wanna see again.”
The guard did not look amused though. He drew his gun from his holster and smacked it against his empty palm like a baton. Like it was supposed to be scary. It was just poor gun etiquette if anyone asked him, but they probably wouldn’t.
He found himself in Mr. Rogers’ classroom before he knew it. Like before, the classroom was empty of students … and Mr. Rogers as well. Scowling, Tony figured he was running late or something held him up in the hallway and took the opportunity to look around the classroom some more. Various maps of the United States were put around the classroom at eye level for easy reference. There was a large bulletin board and calendar filled with reminders for upcoming events and assignments. Then he spotted a section of a wall covered in sticky notes. Written in freaking
This was uncharted territory. There wasn’t much research in the physiological effects of late blooming alphas or omegas. There was even a smaller amount of research regarding the physiological effects of an alpha in a relationship with a beta. Alphas and omegas were said to ‘balance each other out’ and that kind of relationship was the ‘preferred’ one. It was only in recent decades that society started to accept and recognize that other relationship combinations could be just as healthy and fulfilling as alpha-omega or beta-beta relationships.
One of the strange quirks of their society was Alpha’s Night: the one night a year when omegas could kick off the courting process themselves. Traditions varied a little from place to place, but typically, it came down to the ancient practice of literally kidnapping an alpha. How the said alpha was kidnapped was left up to historical records and scholarly debate, but for the most part, Steve thought it was a load of bull. People claimed that these days, it was all in good fun and cited how most couples who ‘got together’ on Alphas’ Night didn’t stay together.
“He does,” Natasha confirmed. “You’ve been through ruts yourself. You know how instincts can mess with your head. This is just hitting him harder than usual.”
Sure, some of them were of the ‘go out and burn down terrorist organizations’ variety, but no one had to know those secrets.
“I knew you were Tony Stark when I first saw you. I knew you were Howard’s son, but given that I hardly knew Howard and you had a whole life outside of that little connection, I figured treating you like a normal person was the best thing to do.”
too. In one chapter, there was an illustration of an omega presenting a covered dish to an alpha. The omega was holding the dish up, a knee bent, and the alpha was standing in their doorway, a few steps above the omega. Suggested,
They all hugged it out, though, or in Bruce’s case, shared some tea over a long discussion, catching him up on everything, since he didn’t know about the armor before now. It was agreed that as long as Tony gave them a heads up, they would be alright with him using the suit again, especially if it was because of an emergency. It was like they knew the suit made him feel safe.
A few nights later on a Darts-And-Fries night, Steve had another coughing fit that was getting quite familiar.
“Thank you for meeting with me for this,” Mr. Rogers said. “I’ll forward you an email so you can set up a meeting with our specialist and we can follow up at a later date ourselves. In the meantime, have a good weekend.”
He closed his eyes and made his face go slack. Seconds ticked by, but no one came over to take the bag off his head. Until they did something, he had to act like he was asleep. It was the only way he was going to gain any real advantage here.
to assure Steve that he was not going to insult the most important people in the country, no sir. Then, Steve started to crack up.
If someone was trying to recreate the serum, even if they were in the middle of Siberia and had no connection to the outside world, not even wi-fi, Howard knew about it.
He swallowed back a sour taste in his mouth and refocused on the facts. If someone had leaked that information, they had to be in SI. They had to have enough clearance—or hacking skills that surpassed his own—to orchestrate the attack. But there was also the motive to consider. Revenge for battles that included his weapons? Corporate sabotage? Did he manage to piss off someone who could really hold a grudge and who decided that this was a good form of revenge?
He was only mollified—just the barest bit—when he coughed up a single ranunculus petal, signaling that Tony was actually feeling some fondness.
Besides Peperi, Actus, and Petros, Antonius learned that there were a few others who would like to stay, if the village would have them. The little girl had been named Morgan. She had been found abandoned on the road once crossing the sea and arriving on the island, so giving her a name that reflected the ocean seemed suitable. There was also Brix, who was a strange, hermit sort of person. He preferred to live further away from others, but Antonius quickly learned that he had a brilliant mind similar to his own. It was more inclined to herbs and medicine, which allowed him to connect quickly with Stiofán’s mother, Sarah.
. He wasn’t going to die. He wasn’t going to slip away from them in the middle of the night or literally cough up a lung. He was going to be okay.
“Only every other week too,” Tony added, mulling over his own experiences with therapy. They had helped somewhat, but what tended to help him was a firm kick in the rear. Peter probably needed someone to talk to, given all that he had been through. “Lots of time to test out whatever they recommend. Come back with thorough results.”
He thought it was going to be filled with accusations, with someone telling him that Peter was a poor student, had lack of impulse-control, and was too energetic. A troublemaker, a disruption. Never mind that he was getting bullied, if he paid more attention in class and stopped talking, everyone would treat him normally and there wouldn’t
he was giving Captain America an unamused look. “They’re only bodies if they never wake up. Agent Coulson is going to have a lot of people to interrogate when we’re done here.”
Tony shook his head and pushed the marriage license forward. “No. I was trying to see if you’d take a hint and just ask me out. Or sign this before someone else whacks me over the head with a club and drags me back to their cave.”
Steve laughed and shook his head, staring at his hands. “Apparently not. I should have stuck with something more traditional. Maybe tried a religious scene. It was stupid, thinking I could get in.”
The sheer amount of love and support Tony had for Peter was just … It always took Steve’s breath away. It reminded him of his own mother, all that she did for him despite their limited means. She gave him everything that she could and then some.
Slowly, over time, Antonius realized that all of them had been touched by the gods. They all confessed none of them knew why. It was to be expected, though.
Another man was holding him steady, looking at him with such concern it made Steve’s heart skip a few more beats. He had gorgeous eyes. Steve would love to capture the honey tones that were reflecting in the sunlight … Nope, no. He couldn’t. He couldn’t afford to pay someone to sit for him. He couldn’t get anyone interested enough regardless and with this rejection, there was little hope that he could find work doing anything with a brush.
“So you’re the one who keeps the plants alive,” Tony said, when he saw Natasha move along the various pothos ivies that grew in pots arranged on the windowsills, watering can in her hand.
Something crumbled to Tony’s left, making him freeze. Dust cleared after a moment and Tony saw that he was maybe a few inches from plummeting god knows how many feet down. Snapped cables sparked. Iron beams were twisted and sticking out all sorts of ways. Tile and concrete fell down, so far down that he didn’t hear it land anywhere.
The man hastily set down his pot and rushed over towards Antonius. He flinched, closing his eyes, expecting there to be pain from a club or rock—
“I need to head to work now, it’s a late shift. Tell Bucky to do his dishes in the sink. And don’t do anything that crappy book says.”
. “Then we’ll just have to wait until your shift is over. Or maybe after closing, when everyone else has gone home.”
Steve—oh thank god, he finally caught up with him again—stopped wiping down a table near the front for a moment, lemon-scented cleaner mixing in with the coffee.
Hopefully, Pepper would understand the obnoxious tweets and mentions. He only said he would give her a room full of flowers and as far as he knew, he had yet to do anything that would require that amount of apologizing. SHIELD would likely see the tweets as well, because he knew they were keeping tabs on him. Huge technological giant escapes terrorists after three months without anyone knowing how or a decent press cover?
Steve hummed to himself as he returned books to their proper shelves. Today had been a good one. So far, no more petals had come out of his mouth and his allergy medicine had kicked in a few hours ago. No book, no matter how old and dusty it was, would cause him to sneeze or his nose to run. With flu season a few weeks away, everyone always gave him dirty looks when he pulled out a tissue. He rolled his eyes every time and always made a show of pulling out some hand sanitizer. As if he would forget to do something basic like wash his hands. Honestly.
“Thanks,” Steve replied, taking the opportunity to throw a handful of Dutch iris petals into his face.
Mrs. Elison frowned. “I beg to disagree. What he called you was very inappropriate and I want to assure you that I do not tolerate that behavior in my classroom. I am not sure what can be done right now, but if he continues to harass you at any time, I want you to let me know, okay? We can figure something out like changing his schedule or teachers.”
Scientists said that ‘Hanahaki Disease’ was not meant to injure or kill. It was selective with its victims after all. No one who held platonic or familial love for someone else suffered from it, for example. One theory said that it was supposed to encourage people to be open with their feelings and be more emotionally mature. Someone else claimed that it was a curse from a divine being all of humanity had to suffer due to one single person’s selfish behavior.
“Gentlemen?” the principal said politely, coming out of their office. “If you would follow me back here please? Your children are back here as well.”
Secretly, Steve always liked the flowers because they reflected light unlike anything else, especially the yellow ones. And because they were Tony’s flowers, but no one had to know that.
