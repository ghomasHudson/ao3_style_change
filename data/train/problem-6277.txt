"Jarvis, put this call up on the screen. I want a good view."
“You’re welcome. Let’s get you upstairs. We can take a bath. JARVIS has it waiting.” When Steve nodded again, he lifted him, carrying him into the elevator and through the penthouse. Tony settled Steve in the steaming tub before stripping off the remainder of his clothes and sliding in behind him.
“It’ll be easier if you’re facedown on the frame.”
Steve allowed himself to be pulled to his feet, to stumble down the hallway after Tony. Gratefully collapsing onto the pillow waiting for him at the foot of the bed when he got there. He should be on his knees for Tony, to please and obey him. He dimly heard the sounds of the older man moving around the room, but then he was back in front of Steve, fingers gently combing through his hair.
“The hell you did. You wanted you to feel good and me to suffer. That’s not how we work, sweetheart. And did I give you permission to come?”
He began a slow rhythm, pulling Steve’s mouth up and down the length of his cock, pressing into the back of his throat every few strokes and holding him there for a moment before letting him slide back and breathe. Steve looked wrecked, eyes watering, lips swollen, gasping for air whenever Tony released him, gagging obediently around his cock when he held him down. Tony began rolling his hips up to meet Steve’s mouth, small movements at first, then harder. Faster. Pushing into his throat each time, not allowing him more than a few seconds to recover in between each thrust.
“You seemed to enjoy yourself afterwards… I especially appreciated the way you screamed my name each and every time you came.”
Tony twisted a hand in Steve's hair, taking control of the kiss, devouring his mouth. Steve felt his cock try to stir in the cage, try to harden. And it couldn't. He could no longer even get hard without Tony's permission. He whimpered against his mouth, trying to get closer, suddenly desperate again.
“Alright. Whatever you want, Tony.”
"I don't know, sweetheart... You did go tattle on your Dom. Apparently to another Dom. Got me in a lot of trouble..."
Steve nodded quickly. Anything. He'd agree to just about anything right now to feel Tony's hands on him again. He slid his palm up Tony's back and grasped his shoulder, anchoring himself. "Yeah. I can be good, Tony."
“Don’t worry, sweetheart. I won’t be neglecting anything today.” Tony picked up a pair of heavy silver clamps, connected by a thin chain. After carefully positioning one of them around his nipple, he let it snap shut, digging into the tissue and putting constant pressure on the gland underneath. Steve could already feel himself start to leak as the second one was just as purposely placed and closed. A small latch on the side of each one locked it in place. No matter how much he struggled, they wouldn’t be coming free.
“Yes, alpha.” Steve whispered. Tears filled his eyes and his lower lip trembled, but he slowly stilled and arched his hips enough to place his encased cock in Tony’s waiting hand.
“Now. You wanted to take what isn’t yours. Let’s start with the punishment for that first, hmm?”
Steve couldn't hold back a smile at the other man's usual over the top exuberance. At least he could tell that he wasn't truly mad at him. That did not, however, mean that Steve wasn't going to suffer. "Okay, Tony. What do I have to do to make it up to you."
Steve had thought that being sent back to the Commission was the worst thing that could happen to him. Now he knew better. Spending the rest of his life alone in an empty apartment waiting on a man who no longer cared about him was worse. And there was nothing he could do to fix it. Nothing he could say that Tony wanted to hear. He started to reach for Tony’s pillow, wanting to pull it into his arms, hold it close. Inhale the comforting scent of his mate. Evergreen and motor oil. But he didn’t. Over time the scent would fade, leaving him more alone than he was now. He didn’t want to muddy what little of the alpha he had left with the stench of his own misery.
"Getting close, baby?"
“You don’t understand, Buck.”
“Okay, sweetheart. I think you’re ready.” Steve moaned again when he felt fingers press against his rim, sliding around in the slick dripping out of him before stroking inside. Tony twisted and scissored his fingers, stretching him, drawing soft whimpers and cries.
Tony eased Steve onto his back, leaning over his body to lightly brush over his nipples. They hardened immediately, silently begging for attention, a request that Tony was more than happy to oblige. First with calloused fingertips, then his mouth. He alternated sucking at one stiff peak, tongue flicking over the tip, while he teased the other with his hand, softly pinching and rubbing. Steve was moaning in his sleep now, the scent of slick hanging in the air. Once both nipples were flushed a bright red, Tony moved on. Steve was carefully rolled onto his stomach as Tony slid down between his thighs, arms hooking around them to hold him open and still. The first brush of his mouth over Steve’s slick entrance had him waking with a gasp.
"Better sweetheart?"
There was a moment where nothing happened, where Steve was allowed to rest, then the plug came to life, vibrating viciously against already sensitive and abused tissue. He had already struggled to the point of exhaustion to no avail, this time Steve didn’t fight the restraints. The vibrations slowly increased in speed, playing one of Tony’s favorite games, and Steve sobbed as they worked him to the edge before stopping. Starting again as soon as he calmed at a low intensity before working back up again. Ramping him up until he had no concept of time or place, anything except for the agonizing burning need to finally come.
“Yes, alpha.”
Tony smiled. "That was the deal."
“Yes alpha.” He heard Tony move around behind him, forced himself to stay still as pain lanced up his arm. Tony silently treated the injuries he hadn’t even realized he’d sustained, and Steve’s stomach knotted up further. He’d done something wrong, but what was it?
He struggled with his uniform, trying to pull it off as fast as possible, not stopping until it was a heap on the floor.
“I’m sorry. Lovely as you are, that just doesn’t seem like much of a challenge for you. Hang on a sec.” Tony disappeared again, returning quickly. Steve’s arms were folded behind his back, forearms bound tightly together, forcing his chest slightly forward. Tony began to pinch and tug at his nipples, quickly working them into hard peaks. A pair of clamps were fastened into place and tightened down, digging in to just the right spot on Steve’s nipples to make him release again with a cry. Satisfied with the adjustments he’d made, Tony returned to his seat, watching expectantly.
“Shame. Guess you get to suffer.”
However, good BDSM etiquette will not be followed for some time. There will probably be at least a conversation at some point, because *someone* has a consent kink, but this Steve understands a lot more about the scene & how to have fun safely than most would imagine.
He braced himself for a blow, but nothing came. Instead Tony squatted down in front of him, so he could look up into Steve’s face. He reached up and tenderly brushed the tears away, like Bucky used to do when he was overwhelmed and beaten down in the past. Before he was taken away. “I know it’s not the same. And I know it’s not what you wanted. But I’m your family now. We have each other. And I’m not going anywhere. I’ll never leave you, Steve.” He pulled Steve out of the chair and curled him into his lap, holding him tightly. “It’ll get better. I promise. And I can introduce you to some of the people I know, and their omegas. You can make some new friends, so you won’t be lonely. You’re not alone anymore.”
“You know how to do that?” Steve’s eyes danced with mischief.
Tony dropped to his knees in front of the bench and began running his mouth over Steve’s soft cock, letting his tongue lap at the sensitive head drawing a soft keening sound from his throat. He tried to squirm away, but was held fast by the restraints. “Tony! Tony please, it’s too much. Too sensitive. Please…”
Steve breathed out his name on a sigh. "Tony..."
Tony left the vibrations where they were, letting the pleasure slowly build to a peak. He wanted James to have a chance to enjoy it. It was obvious he’d had little experience with pleasure in his life, and Tony wanted to give him the opportunity to have it all. He was gorgeous, writhing and arching, hands gripping the chair arms tightly, biting his lower lip in an attempt to hold back his sounds of pleasure. As he drew closer to release, a shudder ran through him, and he relaxed back into the chair, surrendering to the sensations. His eyes opened into narrowed slits, gaze locked on Tony’s. A few moments later James cried out hoarsely, arching up, come dripping from the opening of the cage. Tony let him  shudder through the last of the aftershocks before turning the toy off. James slumped back into a contented heap, sluggishly turning his face up to Tony.
“Soon, sweet boy. Just a little bit longer.” He leaned down, pressing their lips together, tongue sweeping into Steve’s mouth. Chasing the soft whimpers and whines. “That’s my good boy.”
“I have no idea what that means, so I’m just gonna move on. So… Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be hiding in Wakanda with the rest of the Super Friends?”
"It's okay, sweetheart." Tony murmured against his lips. "I'm here. I'll take care of you. I'm never gonna let you go."
He couldn't stay still, moaning and writhing, rocking back into the flickering motions of Tony's tongue. It was the best thing he had ever felt, and if he hadn't been caged, he probably would have come at the first touch. Instead it was pleasurable torture. His cock was aching inside the cage, his balls pressing against the metal ring, his ass clenching uncontrollably under the onslaught. "Tony... Tony please. Need to... Need you."
“Yes Tony.”
“I know. That’s just too much for my soft sweet omega. I’ll take care of you, sweetheart.”
Deciding something had to give, he went down to the workshop to find Tony. When the doors opened, he was greeted with the sounds of 'Highway to Hell' at top volume. He paused just inside, taking a moment to enjoy watching his lover completely in his element. Loud music, bright lights, bots scurrying back and forth with tools, and several projects in progress scattered everywhere. Finally, he took a deep breath, stepped up behind Tony and let his head thump down between the brunette's shoulder blades, arms sliding around his waist.
"Not even going to greet me properly, Steve?"
"Good morning, sweetheart."
"I told you. We're going out tonight. Weren't you listening?"
Tony continued on as though he hadn't heard him. "Now, I don't want to hurt you, so we're going to try something a little different." He slid up on the bed until he was sitting up against the headboard, a firm grip on Steve's wrist drawing him with. He casually turned him, as if he weighed nothing, until his back faced Tony, then drew him back onto his lap.
"Let me finish this, and I'll help you get ready."
Despite the constant attentions, Steve’s small cocklet never hardened, staying soft and sensitive as Tony worked him through a steady stream of releases. The pleasure was intense, but ultimately unsatisfying. He needed his alpha’s cock, pounding away inside of him. His knot stretching Steve’s entrance wide and locking them together. Eventually Tony relented to the babbled pleas, jerking the toy from Steve’s body and seating himself in a single thrust. Steve screamed, his passage clenching down around him, the strong release he’d been craving rushing over him in a dizzying wave, the world turning black around him.
He smiled. "Yes, sweet boy. I had something brought in earlier. You do like to take care of me, don't you?"
Each time Steve thought it might be over, the cage would shrink, increasing the pressure building inside of him to unbearable levels. When he finally thought he might black out, the vibrations finally ceased. He lay there, panting and staring up at the ceiling with unseeing eyes.
"Good boy." He deftly unfastened the lock, sliding the metal cage off of him and setting it on the bed in his line of sight. "Alright princess, stand up for me."
As he lay there panting afterwards, he felt cool metal pressed against his skin, positioned behind the cage. When Tony’s hands slid away, it remained in place, attached to the bottom of the cage. It thrummed to life, vibrations pulsing against the sensitive area, pushing Steve into another release. Tears spilled free when it didn’t stop.
“Tony?”
“No… No more electric shocks?”
Near the end of the first week, Steve woke early to Tony murmuring his name against his ear. "Come on, sweetheart. Wake up for me."
Steve sniffled, gazing up at him with teary eyes. He would be forgiven. For once, Tony would forgive him for his mistakes. He could earn it. Finally. “Thank you, Tony.”
"That's what I'm here for. To take care of you."
Steve let Tony ease him down onto the mattress. He removed the ring as gently as possible before disappearing into the bathroom. He was back a moment later, cupping Steve’s cock and lifting it out of the way, shushing him softly when he cried out in pain.
His eyes slipped shut as he melted against Tony's body. "I do."
"Good boy. Such a good fucking boy. But we haven't even started yet. We still have your punishment to get out of the way first, now don't we?"
Steve slipped on a pair of sweatpants and made a beeline for the elevator, not wanting to wait any longer than he had to for the next part of their game. The doors swung open revealing Tony leaning against the corner of the elevator, heavy black sunglasses hiding his eyes again, as they had been more and more often lately. “Hey Tony.” He offered the other man a small smile, receiving a bright happy grin in response.
"No baby. Not this time. But don't worry. I'll take such good care of you." He sped his movements, chasing his own pleasure, each thrust still slamming against Steve's sensitive prostate, until with a loud cry he came. Steve could feel the rush of come filling him up, his ass clenching desperately around Tony's now softening cock. He couldn't be done. He couldn't stop and leave him like this.
“I’m stalling. Anyway. We make all the arrangements. I work myself constantly so we can have an entire month undisturbed. Just like she wants. But when we get there, we’re not alone. Her friend Ty is waiting for me the second I walk in the door. Chloroform. Knocks me out. I woke up chained in her BDSM murder basement a few hours later. The rest of the month honestly is kind of a blur. I was drugged most of the time. Not sure with what. There was a constant stream of people, mostly men, who all wanted a piece of me. They wore masks so I wouldn’t be able to recognize them.”
“Hello?”
“You couldn’t run the tech, Drake. You need me. So shut up and do what I tell you to.”
“Does that feel better, baby? Was that what you needed?”
“Look at you. I bet if you weren’t locked up nice and tight, you would have come already. Just from me teasing your tits and playing with your sweet hole.” Tony grinned as the flush on his skin darkened. “Look at that blush. I can do the most depraved things to you, but talking about it still gets you all flustered. I love it. Now, if you’re a good boy and can manage it, I’ll let you come. If not… Well, the lube retains it’s potency for an hour…”
Bruce's voice came hesitant over the comms. "I... Might be able to help. Give me a few minutes."
“Yeah. Were you?”
Steve ducked his head, pink dusting his cheeks. “For taking care of me.”
“I know what I said. See this is why I wasn’t going to say anything. I didn’t want to worry you.” Tony sighed, sliding out of his chair to stand next to Steve, tilting his chin up so their eyes could meet. “I’m not going to die. I found my own cure. I stabilized a compound called extremis. It heals all physical damage on the molecular level at an accelerated rate. With a few other side benefits. It’s why I needed an enhanced omega. Like you.”
“Yeah. Yes, I… Understand. Thank you.” Steve rose to his feet, a hollow ringing sound echoing through his head. Tony hated him here too, but it sounded like he deserved it. “I’m sorry… For what he did. I did. I don’t know. I’m just sorry.”
Dark eyes were locked on his, shining with a predatory light. "Does it hurt, baby?"
"Tony, I..." Steve opened the box. Inside was a ring. Titanium-gold alloy, he'd recognize it anywhere he was so familiar with Tony's suit. A simple band with a stripe of rubies through the center. His breath caught in his chest, hand tightening on the box. This was...
Hard shudders began to run through his body, mini contractions that forced more come from him until his balls were empty and hollow feeling, and it still didn’t stop. Tension was coiling tighter, somewhere inside of him that he wasn’t used to. It was frightening in its intensity, causing him to whimper and pull on the restraints. Tony’s hand stroked his stomach, trying to soothe, but Steve fought against the touch.
“I won’t. We’re going to lie here, and I’m going to hold you. I’m also going to enjoy knowing exactly how much you’re suffering. And then when you’re ready, I’m going to leave you here, chained to my bed, while I go down to the shop and make you a collar. Because you are not leaving this room until everyone out there is gonna know you’re mine. Understand?”
“Well, surgery wasn’t really an option, because I refused to let anybody cut into my brain. So pretty much chemo and radiation or death?”
Tony helped him stand and make his way to the bathroom. He got Steve settled then went to the other room to clean up, allowing the plug to shrink, so Steve could expel the enema in private. Probably another thing he’d end up thanking Tony for afterwards.
"I have. How was your day?"
Surprisingly, it was Bruce who approached him first, concerned that he was being safe and taking precautions. Which meant that he had figured out exactly what Steve was doing, if not with who. A largely stuttered reassurance that he was fine and no one was forcing him to do anything he didn’t enjoy allowed him to escape, but not before seeing the amused smirk on the scientist’s face.
“You’re alright. Almost done. Now we get to the fun part.” Tony’s eyes glowed, and the cage released. As soon as Tony slid it off, his cock began to twitch and harden. Steve moaned as Tony wrapped his hand around it, moving over the length in slow, even strokes. “That’s right. Just enjoy it. You’ve earned it, pet.”
Tony followed him as far as the bedroom, sitting down on the bed and waiting as Steve readied the bath and came back out. Wordlessly, he held out a foot and Steve immediately slid to his knees, carefully removing his shoes and socks. Tony stood allowing him to strip the wrinkled business suit from his body, then moved into the bathroom, Steve following behind on hands and knees.
"Th- thank you." He picked up the glass of water and took a drink to clear his head. This was insane. What was wrong with him? He felt overwhelmed, almost drunk off the commanding presence Tony was radiating. This was a far cry from the casual nights they had spent arguing over movies and television, joking about Steve's preferences and all of the pop culture references he had yet to understand.
“No Sir. Please Sir. I wanna be good for you.”
"Good boy." His fingers danced over Steve's skin, circling and rubbing, barely pressing in before sliding back, teasing the nerves, building him up until arousal was burning under his skin. "Onto the bed, hands and knees."
"Be good for a little longer, sweetheart. I'll make sure it's worth the wait." Tony began kissing him again, bodies pressed together, hips grinding down against Steve's caged cock before pulling back slightly. He kept up the onslaught of kisses, thoroughly exploring every inch of his mouth. Steve's cock throbbed in its confines, making it impossible to focus on anything but that and the feel of the older man's mouth on his.
"Yes, Sir."
"Thank you, Sir."
"All clear, Cap. What the hell was that?"
Tears pricked at Steve’s eyes, and he hid his face in the other man’s neck again. “Thank you, Tony. You’re all that I want. I promise…”
"Did you enjoy it?"
“Hey Brucie bear. How’re you doing?”
"We're going to play a very simple game. Every time you drop that plug, I edge you and don't let you come. Understand?"
“Tell me.” Tony’s voice was still kind, but there was a steel core behind the words. This was an order.
"And if I want to?"
“Yes, Tony. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to…”
“Wanna come. Please, Tony? Please?”
The blush intensified. “It… It was a lot. But it was good, too. Alpha’s don’t usually spend that much time on anything other than what they need…”
He bit his lower lip for a second, trying to hide his smirk at Steve’s obvious outrage. “No alpha. Please educate me.”
“Hey!” Bucky gripped his upper arm, jerked him back around to face him. “Don’t. You don’t get to call me a whore for findin’ someone who loves me, Steve.”
The pizza boxes had been set up on the coffee table, two thick cushions sitting on the ground in front of the couch. One red, one blue. Steve immediately went to the blue one, settling on his knees and waiting patiently. James stood, unsure and frozen, until Tony rested a hand on the small of his back, guiding him over. When his toes touched the thick cushion, James blinked down at it, as though unsure of how he’d gotten there.
"Then why didn't you?"
"Yes Tony."
Steve hovered near the doorway, watching Tony hesitantly. When he still didn’t move closer, Tony picked up some of the clothes and held them out to him. “Bathroom’s in there. Why don’t you take a shower and get changed. I’ll have FRIDAY order us something to eat. Alright?”
"Hawkeye! On your six! Iron Man, any response from Strange?"
“What would you like to do now, baby? Do you want to play with Steve some more? Or watch me this time?”
"Yes. I- I liked that a lot."
"Language, Steve. Now hold still, baby. The more you struggle, the worse it's going to be."
Tony grabbed a wrench from a table, threw it through one of his workshop windows with a scream. If he didn’t need anyone, if he was fine alone, then why did it hurt so goddamn much?
“Yeah? That what you want? Should I bend you over the bench, have you right here, then plug you back up again?”
"Fuck."
“Oh please… Please…”
Tears brimmed again, as Steve gazed adoringly up at his alpha. His mate. “You’re… This is just… Everything I always wanted, and was so sure I would never have… No one ever chose me. Except for you. And it’s…”
"How did that go?"
“O-okay…” The word caught on a soft hitching sob, and Tony quickly moved around the frame to soothe him. Steve’s face was red and covered in tears. He stroked the hair back from his face, placing soft kisses on his brow.
2016 – Post Civil War
“Yeah, well… I wasn’t… Sure what you liked. But I wanted you to have it. To feel… Cared for.”
“To stop fighting?”
"Somebody has to."
Tony shook his head sadly. “Now, that just doesn’t work sweetheart. How am I supposed to get you tucked away in your little cage with you like this?” He reached out and carelessly slapped Steve’s cock. The shock of it jolted through him, making him burn. “Does my sweet little slut like that?” He slapped him again, and again. Never too hard, just enough for him to feel it. For it to start to build and ache. He could feel himself drawing close to the edge when Tony stopped.
The drive seemed to take forever. Eventually he even forgot they were going anywhere in the first place. His world had narrowed down to him and Tony, their closeness in the backseat, and that calloused palm stroking his thigh. Steve didn't notice at first when the car stopped, until Tony was moving away. He slid out of the seat and held a hand out to help Steve from the car.
"It's okay. You're okay. You back with me, Steve?"
But after the last few months, Tony was feeling less than charitable. It felt like everyone had walked away from him, abandoned him. What would it be like to have someone who couldn’t do that? Who was dependent on him? Who needed him desperately? Who could stand against whatever threat came next at Tony’s side? And Tony had the power to make it happen, didn’t he?
“Great. Then let’s get started. The first one should be really easy. Never takes long to get him there.” Tony stepped behind Steve, gripped his cheeks and spread them even wider, revealing his clenching hole to his gaze. “Beautiful.” He lowered himself to his knees before leaning forward and lapping softly at the sensitive rim. Steve immediately cried out, shifting in his bond, trying to rock back into Tony.
Tony grinned down at him. “Why baby, I can do this all day.”
"Last one. You can do it. After all, you can do this all day, can't you sweetheart?"
Eventually the itching faded, until only an echo was left behind. Clamps were removed, allowing blood to flow freely back into the abused tissue, drawing more tears down Steve’s face. The vibrator slowed and stopped before being gently eased out of him, leaving him feeling open and empty.
"That's what I like to hear." Slick fingers trailed down Steve's cock and over his balls drawing a soft gasp before rubbing gentle circles over his hole, not breaching, but working the muscles until they softened under his touch. "So sensitive for me. I love that. The things I can make you feel..."
Steve buried his face against Tony’s shoulder, blinking back tears once more. His voice was a soft whisper. “Thank you, alpha.”
Tony pressed their bodies together, claiming his mouth. The thick hair on the alpha’s chest rubbed against Steve’s sensitive skin, his moans devoured by the other man. His arms wrapped around Steve, forcing them even closer as his hands slid lower, fingers stroking into his throbbing passage. Steve’s moan turned into a whine as the gnawing emptiness was finally satisfied. He clenched tight, trying to urge him deeper, and Tony obliged pressing into the core of him.
“I’ll need to examine him. I can give you a more definite answer then. In the meantime, I’d recommend keeping him restrained, so he doesn’t hurt himself. Suppressant detox tends to make them volatile.”
Steve bent over the kitchen counter, cheeks burning against the cool marble, blinking back tears. The plug pressed back into him, roughly this time, followed by a firm grip on the back of his neck, holding him in place. Hard slaps rained down on his ass, jolting the metal inside of him, rocking it against his prostate. He squirmed in the other man's grip, tears breaking free as the spanking drove him back towards release only to be denied again.
The beginning of his knot began to swell, teasing at Steve’s abused rim as it rubbed against him. He could feel his body slowly building up, almost entirely pain with very little pleasure. Tony thrust hard, burying himself as deeply into Steve’s body as he could, knot swelling to full size as he came. The pressure on his gland triggered Steve’s final release, his body spasming around his alpha uncontrollably, and the pain finally knocked him into darkness.
Tears prickled at Steve’s eyes again at the endearment. “P-p-please…?”
“Shh… It’s alright sweetheart. This is what you wanted, isn’t it? It’s what you chose, isn’t it? Maybe we should go again, would that help?”
"And?"
“None of this is fair, sweetheart. Dynamic relationships are inherently unfair. Get used to it.” As his knot slowly deflated, Tony reached into the nightstand drawer and pulled out a pair of handcuffs and a thick silicone plug. Before Steve had a chance to react, his hands were secured behind his back, and Tony slid free of his body, quickly replacing his cock with the plug.
Since I was working with the tags available, I’m not sure if the relationship between Steve and Tony was as clear as I wanted. Hopefully this chapter will remedy some of that. Oh, and we’re back to kinky porn. Because I only have so much plot allotment in my stories, damn it!
“Yes alpha.”
“I know you’ve been watching us. I’m aware that we aren’t exactly subtle.” The corner of Tony’s mouth turned up in a wry grin. “But I’m also aware that you like it.” It was hard to deny the obvious, so Bucky nodded. If he was bringing it up, then it was highly unlikely that Tony was going to get angry about it. “I discussed it with Steve, and we would like for you to join our relationship. He has always loved you. And I find myself with strongly protective feelings the longer you’re here. You don’t have to play like we do, everything is entirely up to you, but I think it might be good for you. That I might be able to help you feel better.”
“Exactly. When he was apprehended it was discovered that he is in fact an omega. He used illegal suppressants to disguise his nature. Never been claimed, bonded, or trained. Extremely volatile, difficult. Recommended only for high level alphas. He’s also a mutant with enhanced senses, strength, and healing.”
Steve slowly straightened and sat down, crying out sharply when it pressed the plug deeper inside of him. He watched helplessly as Tony teased his nipples into hardened points before attaching clamps that were almost a decoration. Metal circles that pressed into his pecs, with a tight screw clamp in the middle, pinching down hard while leaving the tips exposed. Next came a small metal oval that was fastened to the front of the cage, adding weight, tugging on it when he moved. "You are so fucking beautiful, Steve."
Steve eagerly fell back against the pillows, watching as Tony slid the chain from around his neck. He put the key into the lock and gently slid the cage free. His cock immediately throbbed to life, so sensitive that even the slight breeze of Tony's movements had him biting his lip and whimpering. "Tony..."
"Please!"
"Not today. Not after that stunt with the plug. I think you earned yourself... Three days? At least?"
Steve nodded. He felt the blindfold slip from his eyes and had to blink for a moment to adjust his eyes to the dim light. When he looked down between his legs, he wasn't quite sure what he was looking at. A thick ring circled his balls, pressing them together, and away from his body, like a neat little package. Around his cock was a thick silver tube with thin slits, wrapped tightly around him and curved back to fasten to the ring with a small padlock.
“Hey, Steve. Calm down. Deep breaths. Everything’s okay.”
“I don’t want it. Please, Tony. Please. Don’t make me. It hurts. It hurts so much.”
"Don't you remember what I said before? I don't have to hurt you to punish you."
Steve fell back against the bed, sobs tearing from his chest.The constant denial was it’s own kind of agony. It felt like every muscle in his body was twitching restlessly. He needed something, anything, to make it stop. It seemed like Tony was gone for even longer this time, finally stepping back into the bedroom with a full cup of coffee and a Starkpad. After setting the cup down, he moved around the room, sorting through several items before returning to the bed.
Tony grabbed his arm, dragging him up from the bed and steering him towards the elevator. Steve stumbled over his feet, back slamming into the elevator wall, his alpha’s arms on either side of his head. Tony’s eyes were completely blown, his scent edging towards feral, similar to an alpha going into rut. “Let me get this straight, sweetheart. You’re an omega, which means you get slick for me, want me to fuck you, plug you up afterwards, and you’ll never touch your sweet little cock no matter how badly you want to. You’d let me do whatever I wanted to you, wouldn’t you, Steve? Let me tease you, torture you, play with you for hours…”
Steve leaned forward, arms still held behind his back, began nuzzling the hard length, lapping at the leaking tip with soft kitten licks. Tony gave him a chance to explore, enjoying the feel of Steve’s lips and tongue. He was always so eager for Tony’s cock, in any way that he could get it. Eventually Tony started to get impatient. He slid a hand into Steve’s hair, gripping it firmly, using the hold to guide him down onto his aching cock. Steve moaned, immediately taking him deep into his throat, even as it made him gag, tears forming in his eyes. He struggled so hard to please, and watching it only aroused Tony further.
“Any time, Tony.”
Tony slowly removed the plug, setting it aside, taking a moment to watch Steve’s entrance clench and relax. He scooped a large amount of the pale pink cream on his fingers, carefully sliding them just inside the twitching rim. His slick glands were easy to find, so badly impacted from years of neglect that they were hard lumps just inside his passage. “Ready sweetheart?”
"Alright."
“Yes Tony. Thank you.”
When Steve woke up he was unrestrained, stretched out on a plush king sized bed in an opulent bedroom. Flashes of the earlier conversation between his new alpha and the doctor rushed back and he sat up with a jolt, feeling a plug press deeper into his passage. Heart pounding, he traced the collar around his throat, tugging at the metal, searching for give and finding none. He moved on to the cuffs around his wrists and ankles. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get them to break.
Tony still woke up drenched in sweat, a scream trapped in his throat, by nightmares curtesy of the Scarlet Witch. They were all moving on with their lives. And Iron Man? Well, he wasn’t necessary. Was supposed to be dead. If it hadn’t been for FRIDAY panicking and dispatching a suit to his last known location, he would be.
“I’m lucky too, Sir.”
Steve watched in trepidation as Tony fitted his balls through a small metal loop, tightening it around him, adjusting a second piece to come up between them, forcing them apart. His cock was contained in a continuous metal tube, that was tightened down to fit him like a glove, before curving back to fasten to the lower part of the cage. He wouldn’t be able to get hard, would be in agony if his body tried. And even if he succeeded there, the metal loops held his balls tight, preventing him from coming.
“Strip. Now.”
Tony studied him carefully for a moment. Bitten lips, red cheeks, blown pupils. "You like that don't you? You like that a lot."
“What do you need, sweet boy?”
James immediately leaned back, and Steve sobbed through the denied release, only a few drops of come escaping. Steve shuddered helplessly for longer, body desperate to gain any pleasure from the encounter. Finally he stilled, and Tony motioned James to continue. This time James pressed his fingers inside Steve’s slick heat, causing him to jerk frantically at the restraints, trying to escape from the oversensitivity. “No! No, please! Please! I can’t. I can’t anymore. Please!”
"Alright. I thought you might want to start off slow, but if that's what you want..." The machine responded immediately, fucking into him hard and fast, each thrust rubbing over his prostate. He tried to meet the movements, but was held in place, only able to take what he was given. Tony reached under him, a firm grip on his cock, stroking him, building the pleasure. Steve cried out as he reached the edge moments later, pulsing and spilling over Tony's hand.
“If you need me, I’m always here, Stevie.”
Tony’s eyes were dark and intense as they bore down into his. Merciless. “What’s the matter, sweetheart? I’m giving you what you want, aren’t I?”
Tony eyes the wildly struggling omega, mouth turned in a wry smile. “I think there might be some resistance to that idea.”
"And do you think you deserve that?"
Steve’s shoulders relaxed and he turned back around to face the other man, offering him a sheepish smile. “Sorry. I didn’t really mean it the way it sounded. I’m Steve.”
"Alright, sweetheart. You've had enough. Stop now."
He shuddered as Tony's arms slid around him, pulling him down so he could rest his head on the other man's shoulder. Sweet. He wanted to be sweet for him. He pressed as close as he could, feeling the gentle strokes over his back, soothing him. "I- I want to be... I want to be good for you."
Tony allowed him the moment of rebellion, taking the opportunity to turn the vibrations battering James’ prostate up another level. He was rewarded with a grateful moan, before he turned his attention back to the struggling omega. “You have three choices, sweetheart. You can safeword. You can put your little cock back in my hand and let me finish. Or you can keep this up and I will make sure you don’t get to release for the next week. Do you understand, Steve?”
"Yeah."
“And are you going to place my sweet boy in needless danger anymore?”
The door opened behind them, allowing Bruce to enter. He set a large bag on the counter then stepped forward to grip Tony’s hand. “Hello, Tony. I’m glad you finally decided to settle down.”
Steve gritted his teeth and glared at Tony, forcing himself to hold still by willpower alone. "You're enjoying this."
Steve hated himself for giving into his own weakness, even as he buried him face in the side of Tony’s neck. The scent of evergreen and motor oil surrounded him, soothing in a way he hadn’t expected. Tony rubbed over his back, letting him cry against the collar of his shirt until he was calm. “I don’t… I still don’t want this. Want you.”
“Yours! Please! Need… Need it…”
Tony couldn’t resist crossing the distance, tilting Steve’s head back with a gentle touch on his chin. “Did you have a good day, baby?”
Clever fingers slipped the plug free from his hole before sliding in to take their place, rubbing firm circles against his prostate. Steve arched up with a cry, rocking back against them, driving them deeper. He saw Tony’s eyes begin to glow bright blue above him, felt the strangle hold of the cage around his cock ease slightly.
Even when he was working, Tony still stopped to check in on Steve, make sure he was alright. See if he was still enjoying himself. He introduced him to a few of the guests, assorted art collectors and critics, and one young artist who gave him a card for a gallery displaying a few of his works in SoHo. As much as he enjoyed himself, he was still relieved when they were in the limo on their way back to the tower. Tony just curled him in close and held him during the ride, keeping his fingers twined through Steve's on the ride up to the penthouse.
“I… I did. Thank you, Tony.”
I'm going to try to get the companion story worked on a bit longer, and then I think I'll try something new. Possibly with these two since they're so much fun to write. Let me know if you have any prompts or suggestions, I'm always on the prowl for new ideas!
“I used to think so. Not so sure anymore. The things Bruce had to do to get my glands healed up and working? I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy. Took longer ‘cause I’d been through heat.”
"It's okay. I'm home now." Tony gently rubbed over his back until he relaxed against his body. "I think I know something that might make you feel better."
"Shh... It's okay. I've got you."
Steve groaned, felt his body clenching around nothing, slick and come sliding slowly out of his stretched hole. He could still feel the phantom sensation of the vibrations buzzing in his body making his muscles clench. His breath left him in a pitiful whine. "Tony..."
All Steve could do was curl tightly into Tony’s body and cling to him. He was sore and aching, with the burn of arousal still running beneath the surface. It was terrible and agonizing, and he loved it. All this was a far cry from the carefully orchestrated scenes he used to carry out alone in his room, or even being answerable to a faceless Sir via text. He could actually let go and trust someone else to give him what he really needed, not just what his new body wanted.
"No. Not really dependable, is he?"
Tony slid his arm around Steve's elbow and gently guided him down the hall into his bedroom. It wasn't the first time he had been in there, but this time felt different. He wasn't carrying the exhausted genius to bed this time. He was there to let Tony play with him. In whatever ways he could come up with. And Tony was a clever man.
For a moment he thought Tony would have mercy. Would allow him the pleasure after the pain. Steve’s muscles tightened, a shudder running through him. His breathing hitched as his orgasm crested. The hand stroking his cock slid away and a cruel stroke of the crop burned against his aching hole. The pleasure of his orgasm was ripped away, only an unsatisfying dribble of come leaking from the tip of his cock. All of the need and desire were still there, but he felt nothing.
A painful slap landed on his thigh, silencing him. “You don’t get to decide that anymore. I do. You’re mine to play with however I desire. This could have been nice for you. I was going to let you come on my cock like a good boy. But you broke the rules, and now you get to suffer.”
“Yeah. I know. They want too much of you, Steve. Sometimes you just have to tell people to fuck off. But you’re not really good at that, are you?” Tony gave him a shrewd look before slipping his sunglasses down to cover his eyes as he turned to signal the waiter.
Poor Steve! Every time it starts to get better, it gets worse. Feel free to let me know what you think in the comments. Hope you enjoy!
"You alright sweetheart?"
Strange nodded, as though he had already known what Steve was going to say. “Perhaps you need a fresh start?”
“Would you like to do it this time, James?”
Steve sighed. “Tony left me alone in the penthouse today…” Bucky stayed quiet, waiting him out until he continued. “He… Left me a tablet to use. So I… Looked him up. There were these people talking about him... About how he didn’t know how to commit. And him taking an omega was just a phase. How he was gonna get sick of me. Or bored. And…” He took a shaky breath, realizing there were tears on his cheeks.
"Yes, Tony?"
"Yeah... I loved it... Just, not too often, alright? I don't know if my heart could take it."
Steve nodded miserably. “Yes alpha.”
Steve’s shoulders slumped, his stomach growling softly at the mention of food. “Fine.”
He chuckled. "Not quite so easy to be good for me as you thought, is it Steve?"
Steve tried to smother a laugh. He could guess the answer. "Yes, that is absolutely how I did it."
"True. Finally decided to stop teasing Steve? I noticed he seemed a little... Distracted, of late."
"Alright." He let Tony guide him beneath the blankets, still feeling shaky and uncoordinated. As soon as he felt him slide in beside him Steve turned and pressed himself against his side.
“I’m not! I don’t! You’re… You’re making me!”
“Would you like to play a game, sweetheart?” He could only nod, but the response still seemed to please Tony. “Good boy. Strip for me. Right here. Right now. You won’t be needing clothes for the rest of the day.
I hope this makes up for the short chapter before. On with the show!
“Remy’s been in position for a day and a half. Not much movement. Bobby and I are on the roof, ready to go in on your signal.”
“Nine more to go sweetheart.” Tony turned back to James. “You want one of yours or another of his?”
Tony shook his head. “Nope. I wanted to see you. In person, not through the tower’s cameras. You’re just so cute when you’re flustered. You blush all pretty for me.”
Tony wandered out a few minutes later, hair still damp from the shower, dressed in casual but clean clothes. "Hey. I'm glad you're here." He slid a hand to the back of Steve's neck and pulled him down into a slow gentle kiss.
Steve writhed between the two machines, everything else falling away. Dimly he could hear the sound of bells and his increasingly loud cries. It was too much, he couldn't last. But he wanted to be good for Tony. Be his good boy. Receive soft praise, pleasure, and see the glowing approval in the other man's eyes.
"No."
Bucky snorted. “Let’s just say I figured out real quick why he was shoppin’ for an enhanced omega. Got my ass pounded into next week by the Other Guy. And after it was over, I spent the next week strapped to a board. I wasn’t goin’ anywhere.”
“There’s my sweet boy.” Tony pulled him into his arms, holding him close before kissing him again. “I love you so much, Steve.”
His breath caught. "Tony..."
A female voice responded over the secure channel. “Absolutely gorgeous. I can understand why everybody has their panties in a twist over this guy. I never knew a murder strut could be so sexy.”
Steve shuddered at the low, dangerous tone in the other man’s voice. He felt another spasm deep inside his passage, and suddenly the numbness was gone, replaced instead by the most overwhelming pleasure he had ever felt. Each nerve felt like it was being stroked, every muscle locked up tight as the sensation built. It was similar to what he had felt a few times, when the dildo hit the right spots inside, but far beyond.
“For the cream to wear off. You’re going to be so empty and sore by the time I’m finished with you, you’re never going to want to come again.”
Tony stroked his fingers across one petal soft cheek. “That’s the beauty of it, sweetheart. You’re all set up. I decided what you were doing and when. All you have to do is go, and do what you’re told. Can you do that for me, Steve?”
"Alright honey. Ready?"
"Mertlock the Magnificent. Pompous fucker. Steve! Look out!" Tony flipped around in the suit, plunging into a steep dive, knocking him out of the way of the largest construct yet, rising high enough to touch the tops of nearby buildings. "Are you okay?"
"I'm right here. I won't leave you, sweetheart. I love you."
Looking at Steve was a mistake. He knew it when he did it. Bucky wasn’t able to resist the pleading look Steve was giving him. Never had. “Alright, punk. I’ll have breakfast.” He pulled on a pair of thick sweatpants and a long sleeved shirt, suddenly feeling cold, before following Steve out into the living room. Stark was waiting for them next to the table, piled high with different foods. They seated themselves in silence, each man focusing on filling his plate and fixing his coffee. The distraction helped. Tony let them have a few minutes to eat, before turning to face Bucky.
“Shield. The way they order you around, drag you all over the world, and don’t seem to care. It’s a good way for you to end up hurt or dead.”
"I'm right here, baby." He held a glass of water to Steve's lips, petting his hair while he drank. "You are so sweet like this; I almost don't want to punish you." His voice went dark, sending a shiver down Steve's spine. "But I will. Come on. Up you go." He steadied him, helped him stand and walk to the bedroom. "Center of the bed, kneel for me."
Bucky fled to his room, all thoughts of food forgotten. He wasn’t sure what Stark had been trying to prove. That he was in control of everything in the tower? That this Steve belonged to him completely? Or maybe just that he knew Bucky was there. Had been watching them. Unable to stop. It was several days before Bucky emerged from the relative safety of his room. Kept his head down and tried to pretend he wasn’t living in the middle of the world’s classiest porn show. Pretend that he didn’t see the strength in Stark’s body as he played with Steve to his heart’s content. Pretend that in the deepest corners of the night Bucky wasn’t sure if it was Steve or Stark that he was thinking about.
Steve broke, the tears pouring out of him, sobbing like his heart would break. It was too much to ask of him, but he couldn’t say no. Couldn’t disagree with the man wrapping his arms around him and pressing soft kisses to his face. He would do almost anything for Tony to want him as his omega, to keep him. “Tony…”
Steve walked over, burying himself in the brunette's arms. "Missed you."
Thor shook his head vehemently, cautiously approaching his brother and wrapping his arms around him. The hug was unusually gentle, given Thor's natural exuberance. He rested his forehead against Loki's, quiet for several long moments. "I have missed you, my brother, and I am glad to see you here. None on Asgard will learn your whereabouts from me. I swear it."
Steve rubbed his face against the collar of Tony's robe, trying to stem the flow of tears. Felt soft kisses placed against his hair. "So... What does this mean? I mean, what does it do?"
Steve bit back a whimper. If this was Tony starting out easy, he couldn't even imagine what he might do to him in the future. The slaps started again, slow and hard, this time over the sensitive skin of his inner thighs. Tony moved constantly, sometimes high on his thigh, others nearer to the back. He never knew where the next strike would come. He could only tense and wait for it, moan and rock his hips against the bed, desperately praying for relief from the unrelenting arousal that Tony was torturing him with.
“I… I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, alpha…”
"It's... I'm... This isn't going to work. Forget I said anything."
“That’s right, sweetheart. Just like that. If you can release like this, you just go ahead.” The pressure built again, worse this time, as Steve struggled against the cage forcing him to stay soft and small. His whole body was on fire, pulsing in the rhythm Tony set with  his thrusting cock and punishing grip. It felt like time stood still for a moment as Steve hung there, body winding tighter and tighter. He thought for a moment that this time he would get what he needed.
“Yeah. We are. I promise. I’m sorry. I should have talked to you, not just assumed I knew what you’d want.”
“Always.” He kissed one of the rosy cheeks before pulling back. “Now, how about I draw you a nice hot bath, and let you soak while I see about some real food. Your metabolism is high enough that I’m concerned about how long it’s been since you’ve had something solid.”
Tony brushed the hair back from Steve’s face, let his fingers slide down the curve of his cheek. “Always.”
“Yes Sir.”
Tony’s hands tightened, forcing him to be still. He pulsed his hips, letting his knot tug at the inside of Steve’s hole, working his slick glands. He finally went limp in his arms, soft helpless whimpers falling from parted lips. “That’s right, my good omega. You take me so well. You’re so good for your alpha.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony smiled down at him, gently this time. “Not as often as I’d like. Usually my partners have a hard time keeping up with me. Apparently I’m too mean. You don’t seem to have any problems though.”
“I said no. That’s not for you, sweetheart. You come on my cock or not at all.”
Unfortunately, it was short lived. The burning itch deep inside his passage retuned with a vengeance, resulting in Steve humping the mattress desperately. Over and over again he tried and failed to sate the need simmering inside of him. Eventually he curled into a tight ball, knees drawn up to protect his raw cock. Pressing back into the warmth of Tony’s body, he cried himself to sleep.
“Of course, Captain.”
Tony moved Steve off his lap, guiding him onto his hands and knees, hips tilted high in welcome. The plug was removed, walls pulsing around nothing, leaving him feeling empty. Only for a moment though, and Steve whimpered in relief as his alpha pressed inside of him, stretching him wider than the plug, not pausing until he was buried deep. Tony’s hands came around to work Steve’s chest, roughly, moaning as Steve squeezed around his cock, rocking against his grip, trying to force him deeper.
“You… You think that…?”
A wicked smirk turned up the corners of Tony's mouth. "Good. I like you being nervous. I like playing with you. Do you like it, Steve?"
“Fuck it. You want to give me what I want, then that’s what we’ll do. It’s my fucking tower. If Barnes doesn’t like it, he can leave.”
“Good. Really good. I… I liked having someone else here.”
“Your floor is two down. It should still be set up.”
“Al-alpha…!” Steve was trembling, coming apart in his arms, balanced on the edge of another powerful release. He’d lost count of how many he’d already experienced. A single word stopped him in his tracks.
*           *           *
Steve whined in despair as James nodded. “Yes, I understand completely.”
"Good boy. This one's going to hurt, you know that don't you?"
He groaned. Tony was in meetings for the next several hours. He must have gotten bored. It took him longer to reply, fingers shaking.
“Good. Then I have some time to get ready.”
“Yes. If you have something with increased fortitude perhaps?”
“Does my sweet boy like being woken up like this?”
“Are you safewording, Steve?”
Steve climbed up onto the bed and into the older man's arms, curling up in his lap and burying his face into the side of his neck. This was where he was meant to be. Everything he had ever wanted was right here.
Pulling off his shirt, Steve used it to clean up the bulk of his mess. He picked up the cage with trembling fingers, sliding the tube over his tender cock and his balls through the thick ring behind it. For a moment nothing happened, then with a hiss the entire thing seemed to shrink down around him, molding to the exact size and shape of his body, and curving back to fold his cock in half before locking in place with an audible click. He ran his fingertips over the smooth metal, shuddering uncontrollably. It was too much, too intense.
Tony could almost imagine it. Steve’s body heavy with child, the cage unnecessary. Playing with his soft cocklet as he whimpered and whined beneath him, possibly rocking back against a thick toy buried inside his passage. He shook his head, clearing the fantasy. It would probably be a long time, if ever, before he could make that little dream come true. But it didn’t mean he couldn’t try. After all, he had four chances every year.
“Yes pet?”
“Good. That what you always wanted, baby doll? The way you wanted to be taken care of?”
Tony reached out and brushed his fingers against the warm metal, chuckling as Steve's hips bucked forward at the sensation. "Has it been hard?"
“Please, Tony? I can help! Just like I did during the invasion. You just have to give me a chance…” Steve could feel tears trailing down his cheeks as the Avengers presented a united front against him. It wasn’t fair. Never would be. The alpha’s arms were crossed over his chest, face hard as he stared down at Steve. As though he were worthless. As though he wasn’t worth their time.
"I know you have baby. Which is why tonight, you get a reward. Do you want it here, or in the bedroom?"
“No! No! Damn you!” He screamed as Tony picked him up again, carrying him over to the set up. He took his time securing the upper body harness to the frame, releasing his ankles only to fasten them to the floor. Once he was immobilized, he pulled Steve’s plug free, lowering the frame to force him onto the dildo, until his skin was flush with the surface of the machine. More restraints fastened over Steve’s thighs, holding him in place.
Steve shook his head. “That makes… Absolutely no sense.”
"Tell me, what exactly are you being punished for?"
"Thank you, Sir."
“Only had it black.”
“I promise.” Tony kissed him, slow and sweet, hoping to ease his fears, at least for the moment. He knew it would take some time, especially after the mistakes he’d made not long ago. He knew he’d make others in the future, but he was determined to not repeat them.
That was when Tony started moving inside of him. Slow, hard thrusts, burying himself to the hilt each time. Pausing to feel Steve spasm around his length. “That’s right, baby. You get to release now. As much as you want. As much as I want. With my cock buried in your tight little hole so I can feel it, each and every time. You might never get off any other way, sweetheart.”
“Thank you, Tony.”
Eventually the flow of tears stopped. Steve allowed Tony to lay him back against the bed, tuck a blanket around him and curl him into the heat of his body. He tried to stay awake, but found that he was exhausted. As he drifted away, he heard the soft murmur of Tony talking to JARVIS, but couldn’t understand anything that was said.
“Good. Now, I have decided to be lenient. You will not be punished for touching you little cocklet before I had a chance to lock it up. I understand that omega’s have difficulty resisting pleasure, and since I hadn’t made it completely clear that you were not supposed to touch, you will not be blamed for your actions. However, you will be disciplined for trying to remove your cage and plug, and for trying to rub one out without my permission. I think you’ve already figured out the punishment for trying to break your cage…”
“You love it.”
Steve reached into his pocket and pulled out the small phone, held it in his hand for a moment, staring blankly at its surface. He had only used it to text, as instructed. But something like this… It deserved to be discussed. Another deep breath, and Steve called the number belonging to his Sir. Only two rings before it was answered. Silence met him on the other end of the line.
“Then no. I… I’ve never felt anything like any of this before.”
“No. It isn’t. Tell me why, James.”
“Absolutely, alpha.”
Hello lovely people who are still reading my fics! Sorry it took a while, the holiday season kind of threw me off my game. New Year’s resolution is to make more time for my writing, so hopefully I’ll get more put out this year. I hope the new chapter is worth the wait. Comments and requests are always welcome, and encouragement makes the writer write more. Enjoy!
“Alright…”
Steve whined in frustration as the fingers withdrew once more. “Be a good boy Steve, and you’ll get to come after I’m done. Now, slight pinch.” He felt the unmistakeable pain of a needle pressing into his prostate, followed by a burning rush. The syringe was withdrawn and set on a tray to the side. “We’ll just give that a minute to work. I want you to be nice and sensitive for me. This one combines particularly well with the serum, so the effects should be permanent.”
"I know. I missed you too. Did you have a good day?"
"Thank you." The words came out as a whisper.
He was roused the next day by the shifting of the plug as Tony gently removed it. Steve moaned softly into the pillow, his hole clenching uncontrollably on nothing. As strange as it had been to have something inside of him for the first time, it was even stranger to be empty. He felt the trickle of liquid from his stretched entrance as the come that had been held inside of him slowly leaked free. Steve whined, feeling somehow bereft, as though he had lost something important.
It wasn’t until several hours later when he was overseeing treatment for minor wounds sustained by Clint and Natasha that Tony came to find him. The other man seemed displeased, his mouth set in a hard line. Steve felt his stomach clench. His alpha was unhappy with him, and he wasn’t sure why. Was it because he didn’t fight hard enough? Or maybe Tony was angry because the others had gotten injured. Steve should have tried harder.
Steve nodded; he should have expected something like this. "I have no intention of harming Loki or trying to force him out of the tower. I just want to talk to him. I think he might need a friend right about now."
Steve couldn’t breathe. He felt physically ill at the idea of hurting the man standing in front of him. How could any version of himself have done that? “I wouldn’t… I couldn’t…”
“None of that, now. Good boys take the punishments they earn without complaint. Now, ready to move on?”
After a while Steve’s mind drifted from his thoughts to just float hazily. His eyes closed, focused on the touch of Tony’s hand, the rumble of his voice. He was brought back to the present by a firm tug on his hair. “You back with me, pet?”
"Tony..." He buried his face in the bed and sobbed. Let his legs collapse underneath him as he shook. "You can't... Please... You can't do this to me..."
"Almost done, sweetheart. You've been so good for me."
He wanted Steve to come like this. To be a shuddering, sobbing wreck whether he wanted it or not. Tony continued spanking him, watching as Steve’s movements grew more frantic, a scream tearing from his throat as he came beneath the onslaught, the trapped come swelling his balls in their tight confines, creating a new source of pressure and pain. Tony forced him through two more orgasms before he set the paddle aside and stopped the implant’s vibrations. “You know what happens now, don’t you honey?”
Steve leaned forward pressing against Tony’s chest and sighed in relief at the feel of strong arms wrapping tightly around him. “I’ll miss you too. Come home soon?”
"You should have learned not to promise me anything, Steve. It doesn't end well for you."
“See, that’s it. That’s it exactly. We spent all that time thinkin’ we were weak if we gave in, but nobody ever gave a crap if alpha’s followed their instincts. But we’re the emotional ones, and that’s where the problem was.”
“Such a good boy for me, sweetheart. Fuck. That was amazing. You’re amazing. I don’t think I’ll ever get enough of you.”
“That’s right. Finally figure it out, baby doll? The worst thing I could possibly do to you is… Nothing. Now, I’m going to give that some time to work in. I’m sure I can come up with something to play with until then.”
A low keening noise tore from Steve's throat. He would. He would do almost anything if it meant Tony kept looking at him like that, touching him and teasing him like he had been for the last few days. "Yes Tony..."
Breakfast arrived, and was spent talking, making plans for the day, and feeding each other bites of bacon and syrup drenched waffle. Tony inhaled most of the coffee before seeming ready to face the day.
He could feel his thoughts spiraling downwards, but didn’t know what to do. Tony only wanted him because SHEILD needed him to fight. But if he couldn’t even do that right, would the alpha not want him anymore? Would he throw him away and find a better mate? Would Steve have to watch?
“And what? Tony, I can’t even think straight. Help me!”
Steve smiled at the woman waving a microphone wildly in his direction. "No. I'm here to support my boyfriend and the charity he created in honor of his mother."
Steve nodded. He tried to smile but it probably came out more of a grimace. “Fine, Tony.”
He had started with a generalized satellite DNA scan. For once Howard’s obsession with the Howling Commandos had come in handy. A few strands of hair from an ancient brush in his collection provided the sample. Tony had expected to find weather beaten remains in an icy canyon beneath old train tracks. Instead, he got a moving signal. Hits from a living breathing individual. And down the rabbit hole he went. Facial recognition scans in shady government databases provided him with a horrifying reality.
Steve let his tongue flick over the head as he slid out and stroke down the vein when he thrust in again. Hollowed his cheeks and sucked as Tony’s movements became more frantic. Greedily swallowed the come spilling down his throat as Tony groaned out his pleasure above him. When his knot was deflating and his cock soft, he pulled free from Steve’s mouth, settling against him on the bed. “You are such a good fucking boy for me, Steve. How did I get so lucky?”
"I'm going to make us lunch. You want to stay here while I get it ready?"
He didn’t have much to pack, had been traveling light for a long time. Bucky wrote a letter for Steve, saying all of the things that had been left unsaid between them for far too long. Left it in his room for him to find when he came back. Bucky said goodbye to Shuri, thanking her for everything she’d done for him. Then he left Wakanda for the last time. Made his way to New York, slowly but steadily, impossible to track. He had some amends to make.
