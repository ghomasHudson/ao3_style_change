John pulled his mobile from his pocket, thumbing through to his email. “Right. Yes, actually, my friend responded...hold on.” John took a moment to read Bill’s response and send him a quick thanks. “So we’ll need to get in touch with a guy he knows near here...should be able to come up with something, for the right price.” John rubbed his hand down his thigh. “Umm, about that…”
By the end of John’s disclosure, Dad’s eyes were wet with unshed tears. “That’s wonderful, John. Wonderful news.” Dad wiped at his eyes, sitting back in his chair. “Just, please...please be gentle with him?” Dad shook his head, rubbing at the back of his neck. “He’s a lot like me, you see. He may appear to be tough...but his heart...John, his heart is…” Dad hesitated.
"Another nightmare, John? Maybe you need to talk to someone. What was this one about?" Mary sounded exhausted, this was the fourth night this week her sleep was interrupted by her PTSD suffering bed mate. She was sympathetic, but she also had to get up in… -she picked up her phone and squinted at the bright light- less than an hour. Not worth going back to sleep, really.
"Sherlock Holmes." replied Sherlock, shaking John's hand with his elegant grasp. "And I didn't DO anything. I simply stated some irrefutable facts to a very annoying woman. It's hardly my fault if she became emotional over it."
"Hmmm. Too cold." Sherlock wrinkled his nose, his lips forming a moue of distaste. He made a few notations in his notebook before removing his safety goggles and gloves.
John unconsciously leaned into Sherlock, his body seeking comfort in this situation that his mind couldn't control. They sat this way for a few moments before Sherlock removed his hand. The Fasten Seatbelt light had blinked off, followed by an announcement that they were again free to move about the cabin.
“Our Sherlock...he’s always been headstrong. Maybe a bit quieter in some ways...and in other ways…” Dad hesitated, searching for words. “I guess what I’m getting at is that... Katy and I can see how much you mean to our son.” Dad picked up his drink and took a long swallow. “We’re so happy you’ve found each other...you seem good for each other. But…”
He pulled the door open and Sherlock swept past him, already in the middle of a sentence."...could be dangerous, should definitely be carrying a weapon..."
Sorry for the delay, Christmas shenanigans have kept me from writing! Hope you are enjoying the story.
The chaos of the other passengers getting settled had slowed, and John was bracing himself for the inevitable rumblings of taxi and take-off. He momentarily regretted not having the Xanax that Mary had suggested, but hoped that his exhaustion would allow him to remain unconscious for most of the flight. He was pulled out of his thoughts by the insistent buzz of his mobile. He slid it out of his pocket and checked the screen. John sighed, pursing his thin lips.
“I can see why you would like this room.” John set Sherlock’s bags at the end of the bed. “Have you read all of these books?” John walked over to investigate the bookshelves, interested in a few titles already.
John pulled his damp T-shirt over his head, then stripped off his pants. Wrapping himself in his warmest dressing gown, he tied the belt as he headed out to their small kitchen. The nightmare left him feeling tired and slightly confused, hopefully a cup of tea would sort him out. He put the kettle on and grabbed two mugs from the cupboard. Their day was going to be a busy one, the clinic in Central London only operated one week out of every month, with medical volunteers from the area rotating coverage. The waiting area had been consistently packed since Monday, thank goodness today was Friday.
“There is a strong scent of urine in here, John. She’ll need to become accustomed to it, it could take up to a month for Dad to train the little beast.” Sherlock stood, carrying the pillow back to the bed.
"Umm, John…" Sherlock addressed his new acquaintance uncomfortably. "I must confess that I don't know what to do in this situation. I have been called a sociopath before, I don't know how to assist when there are emotions involved…" Sherlock broke off as the plane dipped and shook rapidly.
Mummy Holmes had the same height, otherworldly eyes and high cheekbones as her son, but that’s where the similarities ended. She had round, rosy cheeks and a soft, huggable body, which was currently wrapped in a festive holiday apron.
Sherlock whipped the door open, his lower half now wrapped in a towel. “It’s fine, John. My parents know me, they know we’ll get there when we can.” Sherlock brushed his sweaty curls off his forehead, leaning on the doorframe.
John sat down on the end of his bed. "So let me get this straight. You came to Miami to catch an assassin? And what, get Mr. Hudson out of jail?" John tilted his head, his eyes narrowing as he tried to make sense of Sherlock's thoughts.
John turned, tearing himself away from the stacks of books. “I would, yeah. Thanks, Sherlock.” He followed Sherlock to the room directly across the hall.
Sherlock turned his attention back to Debbie. “Did you speak to him at all while you were away?” he asked impatiently.
The cab delivered them to meet Lestrade at an address near Chelsea Bridge, where they encountered a horrific scene. The subsequent 36 hours had been non-stop, unraveling the multiple homicide case - which turned out to be the aftermath of a fatal disagreement among members of an international counterfeiting syndicate.
A knock at the door had them both scrambling. John sat up, straightening out the bedclothes while Sherlock quickly pushed all puppy related items into his closet. He slammed the door shut just as his bedroom door opened.
John's reaction to Sherlock dissecting his break-up was interrupted by the Fasten Seatbelt sign flashing to life above his head. A crackly voice over the loudspeaker announced, "Cabin crew, please be seated."
John gave Sherlock a fond look. “Well, you’re holding up better than most, I’d reckon. You look like a model in that suit.” John smiled at the blush that his comment elicited on the detective’s angular cheeks. “I’m a lucky man, being picked up by a such a glamorous gentleman.”
A female flight attendant was standing in the aisle towards the back of Business Class, leaning over a woman that looked like she was in tears. The attendant was speaking in a low voice, but it was clear that she was trying to diffuse a situation. She was answered by a rumbling baritone voice, John strained his neck trying to see the man it belonged to. The attendant stepped back as if she had been slapped, her face struggling to retain her composure.
John set his mobile down. It really was quite hot out here, he felt a bit sweaty and overheated. Surprised to see he was still the only guest on the pool deck, he stood up. Dropping his shades on the lounge chair, he took a quick step/hop, performing a perfect cannonball, sending sprays of water flying. He swam underwater the length of the pool before lifting himself out again. He gathered his things, heading inside to take a shower and dress.
She tilted her head, regarding the two men with narrowed eyes. “The police said that you wanted to talk to me...I don’t really understand why. I’ve told them everything I know. I feel quite helpless, actually.” She picked up a napkin from the table, twisting it in her hands. “I’ve spoken to so many official people, I can’t keep track of who’s who anymore.”
“Coral Gables Country Club. We’re meeting Mrs. Deborah Ayers. She has a tennis lesson, and this is the only time she could fit us in.” Sherlock glanced over at John, scrutinizing his new friend. “I see you enjoyed some time at the pool this morning, I’m glad.” He reached over to adjust the air. “I don’t know how anyone can live in this heat, John, I can’t think!” He gripped the gear shift in frustration.
Sherlock stopped walking, turning to face John in the glow of the village Christmas tree. He took a few moments to answer, studying John’s upturned face, which was so familiar to him. Data from the experiments points to John responding positively to this declaration...so why am I so scared? Courage, Holmes.
“I did, John. I love to bake. There are a few things I make every year, as tradition, you know. But when Sherlock called me with a list of your favorite foods, I was happy to have some new recipes to try!” Mummy failed to notice the blush taking over Sherlock’s face as she spoke.
"People and their problems," Sherlock scoffed. "Boring. I solve crimes that New Scotland Yard are too inept to solve on their own. They call me in when they find themselves in over their heads, which is quite often, and I catch the criminals for them." Sherlock leaned back in his seat, trying once again to get comfortable.
"How much longer will you be working on this experiment? There's no room for anything in here, I don't even know where you expect me to make tea, now that you've moved the kettle under the bench!" John leveled a gaze at his flatmate.
She gave him a sympathetic look, but started heading his way, leading the troublesome passenger. John watched their progress up the aisle, but he couldn't get a good look at the guy from where he was sitting. He found himself feeling torn between mourning the loss of his extra leg-room, and his curiosity over this new development on what had been (let's be honest) a pretty boring and uneventful flight so far.
“I ordered most gifts online this year, however I think I’d like to do something more personal for Mrs. Hudson” Sherlock said. John nodded, “She does put up with a lot from both of us...mostly you.” he chuckled. “How well do you know her? I know she enjoys baking and watching afternoon telly, that’s about it”. John felt a little guilty, Mrs. Hudson was amazing and he should make an effort to spend more time with her. New Years’ resolution, he thought.
Sherlock was right...as usual, thought John. The tiny pup slept quietly all the way back to the cottage. If the Holmes parents thought it strange that Sherlock wore his coat upstairs, they decided to ignore it.
Sherlock suddenly wished that he had more experience with relationships. He recognized the signals of interest that John was transmitting, but had no idea how to reciprocate. Maybe it would become clear after a drink or two. He was most comfortable when discussing his cases, and John seemed genuinely interested in the case, as well as in him.
They wrapped up in warm winter attire before stepping into the chill outside of Town Hall. “Would you like to walk around for a bit, boys?” asked Mum. “The Christmas lights in the square are quite nice, and I believe some of the shops are open for a few hours yet.” Mummy tucked her arm through Dad’s, cuddling in close to his side. “How about we meet at the car in an hour?”
“Ah, the feud with...what’s her name...Kath? Finally over, then?” Sherlock asked with an impertinent grin.
Mummy glanced around the room suspiciously. “Merry Christmas, boys...is everything alright in here? Daddy and I thought we heard noises last night…?” Mummy scrunched her nose delicately, unsure what she was smelling in the room.
Sherlock followed the driver out of the airport - straight into hell. At least, this must be what hell feels like, he thought. This humidity is going to wreak havoc on my hair. As he settled into the backseat of the car,  he took a last look at the teeming arrivals terminal. He scanned his eyes over the lines waiting for a taxi, hoping to catch a glimpse of sandy blonde hair. It was too dark and crowded to make out individuals, even if they did possess the brightest blue eyes and warmest smile that Sherlock had ever encountered.
"I don't doubt it for a moment. All I'm suggesting is that you consider the delivery. Is this man's private life information that really needed to be shared out loud?" John's tone was bemused.
The staircase turned on a landing halfway up, eventually ending at a wide hallway, doors on either side. Sherlock turned to the right and walked to the end. “This door at the end is the washroom we’ll be sharing, John. I usually take the room here at the back, I like the view.” Sherlock pushed open the door to reveal a cozy room with a sloped ceiling. It had a dormer window and window seat piled high with cushions. The walls were a pleasant shade of sage green, which complemented the nature theme of artwork on the walls. The bed took up most of the space, looking crisp and inviting covered with a puffy white duvet and pillows. One whole wall was built in bookcases, filled to bursting with all kinds of titles.
"Forget it, it's fine. Will you be alright now? I can ask the attendant for some water if you'd like." Sherlock offered. He felt vaguely embarrassed as well, but wasn't sure why. He wasn't unaware of the needs of others in general, but it was rare that he reacted to them. What was it about John that made him feel so protective? They barely knew each other.
John frowned. Had his eccentric flatmate injured himself, or did he just need a pen handed to him? With Sherlock, he had learned it was better to ask before he panicked.
John shoved his mobile into his pocket, he should have known. When he turned back around, the girl had gone. John let out a deep sigh, then hurried to finish his shopping. He had quite a few bags by the time he was done, and decided to take a cab home to Baker Street.
The bell from the door downstairs rang, breaking through John’s trance-like state. He sucked in a quick breath and turned away from the sitting room door, wondering who it could be. As far as he knew, Mrs. Hudson was still out, so he dropped his kit on the floor and took the stairs down, two at a time. He threw open the front door to find a courier standing on the step.
John let out a small but infectious giggle, causing Sherlock to first smile, then laugh himself. Sherlock was suddenly grateful to the annoying idiots on the plane that he had already insulted, and the interfering flight attendant.  He had just met this unassuming, seemingly average man, and had no idea what his plans were. But he knew that he wanted to find out.
Sherlock eyed John furtively, noting his signs of stress. Pale complexion, clenched jaw, white knuckles gripping the bags...he’s nervous. But why? Turning to face him on the doorstep, Sherlock placed his hand on John’s arm.
“You’re being ridiculous, John.” Sherlock’s tone was embarrassed but pleased. “Any progress obtaining a gun?” He tried to steer the conversation to safer ground. “I don’t expect this interview to become violent, but one never knows.”
Someone was grabbing at his arm, shaking his bad shoulder. He tried to shake them off, getting annoyed. "John!" a voice cried out. He tried to twist around in his seat to see what was happening. Again, "John!" the voice called. His stomach dropped out of his body, and the feeling of falling was overwhelming. This was it, he braced himself…
John’s anxiety at meeting Sherlock’s family was forgotten for the moment, but he wasn’t exactly comfortable having this conversation on their doorstep.
Sherlock was still riding the high of success when they returned to Baker Street in the wee hours of Christmas Eve morning. He ran up the stairs, shedding articles of clothing as he went. John followed, huffing in exasperation. “At least wait until you’re in the flat, you great berk!” He was exhausted and starving, so having to pick up after a grown man was just not on.
"…O-kay…So what is it that you do then, you know, if you're not properly employed?" John asked, his voice colored with amusement.
“I know, John.” Sherlock answered eventually, squeezing John and nuzzling his hair. “I had deduced as much, you see.” He smirked down at his blogger. “Now, how do you suggest we release this puppy on the household?”
John moved to follow him, catching a healthy glimpse of a very firm, rounded backside before Sherlock disappeared into the bathroom and shut the door. Now John was tired, hungry, frustrated and...god help him...aroused. “Sherlock! You didn’t let your parents know we would be late?” John raised his fist, banging on the door that separated the men.
“John. Welcome to Honeybourne.” Sherlock felt a small sense of pride that John had slept peacefully the whole drive, that he had kept John safe. Sentiment. They had just entered the village of Honeybourne, where his parents had settled for their retirement years.
John smiled brightly at his friend. "That sounds better than slogging about on my own, and you can help me choose gifts for your Mum and Dad! I never know what to give anyone." John settled back in his chair and closed his eyes, his feet kicked out to take advantage of the heat from the fireplace.
John handed him a steaming mug, then took a sip from his own. "Well, that's okay. Do you have other plans? Which is fine, by the way."
“Thank you, sir. Cheers!” John accepted the drink and took a seat on the sofa facing the fireplace. He took a grateful sip of the honeyed liquid. “Oooh, that is good.” He relaxed back against the cushions.
"Sherlock? How did you find me? Are you alright? What's dangerous?" the many questions John had all fought to be the first out of his mouth. "Did you need somewhere to stay? " John tried to keep his voice from sounding too hopeful.
"Going to Miami on holiday, then?" questioned John. How could he find out if Sherlock was seeing someone? Probably best to just ask straight out. "Meeting your girlfriend there? His cheeks felt hot. That wasn't subtle at all, but he never was one for playing games. I’ve probably had enough whiskey, he thought. Who knows what he would say if his inhibitions slipped any lower.
“No, I didn’t.” She replied in a defensive tone. “And when I got home, it was obvious he hadn’t been there since Saturday at least, that’s when the maid comes in. Timmy has always been messy, and there were no dishes, the bed was made, no clothes on the floor.” She twisted her hands in her lap. “I tried calling him, then some of his friends. No one had seen him all weekend.” She dropped her gaze to her hands, again twisting her rings around her thin finger.
The morning was filled with thoughtful gifts being unwrapped and appreciated. Mummy laughed out loud when she lifted her new pie dish from the box. “Oh, boys...that is ridiculous! I love it!” She exclaimed.
"I'm not really up to a relationship dissection right now, Mike. Sorry, I just…I'm just tired. Her announcing the affair at the breakfast table was surprising, but as I said, we've not been as close as we should have been lately. I'm actually feeling okay about it right now, just need to get through the rest of the day at the clinic and hopefully get off to the airport." John pushed his cup to the side, tapping his fingers on the tabletop. "I'm more surprised she dropped out of the trip to Miami, to be honest. She was the one that really wanted to go." He started to stand, "Walk back with me?" he asked.
“Sorry, Sherlock...I’m so sorry. I was more tired than I thought, I guess.” John let his arms drop, taking a deep breath. “I’ll head up to bed, I think.” Sherlock smiled at him, saying softly, “You do that, John. Sleep well.”
John was relieved when they pulled into the circular drive in front of the Thompson Miami Beach Hotel. He settled the charge with Bill and hopped out into the humid evening. John held the rear door open for Sherlock, who slid out gracefully, joining him on the tiled driveway. The sulk was still evident in the pout of Sherlock’s lips. John had the sudden urge to lean forward and kiss that pout away - it took everything in him to hold back. Instead, he took the detective's hand in his and led him up the steps into the lobby, studiously ignoring Sherlock's jolt of surprise.
Sherlock’s mobile buzzed just as they were pulling into traffic. He held up a silencing finger to John as he answered. “Lestrade.” Sherlock spoke quietly yet tersely. “Address?...Yes, we’re on our way.” He pocketed the mobile, calling out the change of destination to the driver.
John tried to control his excitement. Did Sherlock just invite me up to his room?! He smiled as he signaled for the check. He turned back to the detective, looking at him with barely contained heat. "That sounds like a great idea. I don't see that I've done anything useful yet, and I really do want to help. I have a few old friends in the US Army, I can look them up and see if anyone can help me out with a gun." John paid the check, then stood, extending his hand to the detective.
John woke a few hours later to Sherlock playing his violin. He didn't recognize the tune, but it was something slow and melodic, not terrible to wake up to, he thought to himself. He was grateful to find that Sherlock had draped the blanket over him as he slept. He opened his eyes and stretched, his gaze falling upon the mantle. It took a moment for him to realize what he was seeing..."Umm, Sherlock?" He stood up and walked over to his friend at the window.
“That’s perfect, John. We make the perfect team.” The detective leaned over, kissing his doctor soundly. “Merry Christmas, John”.
"You expressed an interest in my case. I require your assistance, I left my skull at home. " Sherlock admitted.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has just turned on the Fasten Seatbelt sign. We are now crossing a zone of turbulence. Please return to your seats and keep your seatbelts fastened. Thank you."
The sun was beginning to warm the room by the time John felt ready to get up. He was looking forward to a lazy morning with coffee and the papers...and, yes...spending the day with Sherlock. He was pulling a sweater over his head when he heard a familiar “Whoo hoo! Boys!” from downstairs. John smiled, bounding down from his room to greet Mrs. Hudson. “Happy Christmas, Mrs. Hudson!” John leaned over the tray she was carrying to kiss her cheek. “All ready for the holiday? Did you and Mrs. Turner finish your shopping last night?” Mrs. Hudson set the tray of scones down on the kitchen table, which was surprisingly clear. Sherlock must have actually cleaned up last night...it’s a Christmas miracle, John thought, chuckling to himself.
His text alert interrupted his thoughts. "Oh um, excuse me a moment…" John turned away from the girl, pulling his mobile from his pocket.
"No, John. It's fine. It's all fine." Sherlock gave him a small half-smile. "It was no trouble. Were you able to rest a bit?" Not long ago, Sherlock had been counting the minutes (extremely impatiently) until he could get off this uncomfortable flight. Now he found himself regretting that his time with John was coming to an end.
Sherlock fell backwards into the armchair, steepling his fingers under his chin. His mouth quirked in a small smile. He knew John would agree to help him, but hearing John agree gave him a warm feeling. It was novel, and entirely unfamiliar. This is the beginning of something new, he thought with excitement.
"I am a consulting detective. Only one in the world." Sherlock announced proudly, with just a hint of shyness creeping in. He found himself wanting to impress this man. That's unusual, he thought. "I created the job, and I am quite good at it." His eyes narrowed as he tried to gauge John's reaction. It was incredibly hard to predict what he was thinking.
Mary again. He thumbed across to ignore the call. He checked the text icon…5 new texts. What could she possibly want from him?! She's the one that cheated. He sent her a text on his way to the airport, letting her know that he was leaving tonight, and that he would contact her when he was back to pick up his things from the flat. As far as he's concerned, that's it.
As it turned out, there wasn't much they could do after midnight except find somewhere to get a drink. Sherlock didn't have any leads to follow yet, and there was still the matter of the interview with Mrs. Ayers to discuss.
They continued on, stopping for roasted chestnuts and mulled wine. As they were passing a stall with pottery and ceramics, John chuckled at something that caught his eye. “What’s funny, what did I miss?” Sherlock scanned the display, his eyes landing on a pie dish with a message written in mathematical symbols spelling out I ATE SOME PIE ((√-1) (2^3) (Σπ).) stamped in the center of the dish. “John, that’s brilliant!” Sherlock sprinted over to the stall owner, and was soon the owner of said dish. “Did you know that Mummy is a mathematician? This is perfect for her! It’s silly, and she loves to bake.” Sherlock handed the shopping bag to John. “Okay, now just Father left...he’s a bit tricky.”
“Wow, this is really nice.” John took in the details slowly. The room was painted a robin’s egg blue, with a white cast iron bed in the center. There were windows on either side, and a beautiful carved wooden chest at the foot of the bed. Where Sherlock’s room had a wall of bookcase, John’s had a white brick fireplace. There were two low, velvet armchairs in front of the fire. The wood floor was covered with a gorgeous but worn Persian rug in patterns of blue and green. John placed his bags on the floor and sat down on the wooden chest.
The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States had invited John, along with his colleague and friend, Mike Stamford, to present a joint paper at their annual conference. This year the conference was being held in Miami, Florida, and John had known as soon as Mary saw the brochure that she would push for them to go. He couldn't blame her, the fall weather was as chilly and gray as ever. A bit of sun and sand would go a long way to restoring their moods heading into the holiday season.
“John has nightmares, Mummy. We apologize for disturbing you.” Sherlock glared at John meaningfully.
Sherlock hummed his agreement. “They have been through a lot in their time together, I believe it has forged a very strong bond.” Sherlock’s breath crystallized, visible in the frigid air. “A bit like us, I suppose.” He wanted to reach out, wanted to hold John’s hand...wanted to hold him close again. “I admit, there are not many things that I don’t understand, John. But relationships...I don’t have practical experience to draw upon.” He kept his eyes trained forward.
"How in the world...never mind. Yes, also correct." John rubbed his hand through the short, sandy strands on his head.
John awoke to Sherlock arguing with a podcast. He struggled to sit up, taking stock of himself and his whereabouts. “Hey, Sherlock…” he started. Looking at his watch, John saw that over two hours had passed. “Sorry I slept so long.” He rubbed his face with his hands and tried to smooth his rumpled hair.
As they moved to the next stall, John heard his mobile chime. “Don’t tell me that’s from you”. He looked up at Sherlock and laughed, setting down the shopping bags on a nearby bench and pulling the phone from his pocket. “Huh. How social are you feeling right now?” he asked Sherlock. The look Sherlock gave him said it all, and set John laughing again. “Alright, alright...I only ask because I’ve just got a text from Lestrade, a few of the lads are getting together for holiday drinks tonight, and he’s invited us along”. John shifted the phone to his other hand so he could type in the address of the pub. “It’s not far from here, we could probably walk over if we wanted to join them.”
Okay, be brave, Watson. John lifted his face to make eye contact with Sherlock. “Would you sit down, Sherlock? I think we need to talk.”
“And John. Welcome, son.” Daddy Holmes shook John’s hand, stepping closer for a light embrace. “Katy and I are so happy you could join us to celebrate this year.” He stepped back, wrapping his arm around his wife’s shoulders. “We’ve been begging Sherlock to bring you up for a visit, he keeps putting us off.”
John carried two mugs of freshly made tea through, setting one down next to his chair and handing the other to Sherlock. “I’ve just come down, myself,” John replied to Sherlock, “and the decorations, Mrs. Hudson...all Sherlock!” John smiled, sitting himself down in his chair and taking a sip of tea. John looked at Sherlock over the edge of his mug, remembering the feel of the man’s lips against his forehead. He hoped the steam from the tea would excuse the blush now coloring his cheeks. “You look very nice today, Sherlock.” John had wondered if Sherlock would act differently this morning...it felt like their relationship was shifting into unknown territory, and yet, they hadn’t spoken directly about it.
John whistled as he opened the passenger door. “Wow, Sherlock! I can’t believe you lucked into this rental!” John admired the spotless leather interior. “It looks brand new!” he exclaimed.
“I know, Dad. Believe me, I know.” John suddenly wanted nothing more than to wrap his arms around his detective. “I think I’ll go find him, if you don’t mind?” John stood up, putting his hand out to Dad.
John smiled as he flipped through the brochure, imagining swimming in the Caribbean with Sherlock, drinking a cold beer on the beach, napping in hammocks…”That sounds perfect, Sherlock. I can’t wait.” John lay his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, the long night beginning to catch up with him.
"Look. We're both exhausted. I know the idea of getting on a flight is making you nervous, but just think how wonderful it will be tomorrow night, drinking frozen cocktails on a warm beach? You don't have to present the paper until Tuesday, and Mike is counting on you. Can't you just take a Xanax and sleep on the flight?" Mary turned her back to him, her cheeks turning pink from the steam.
My apologies if you were hoping for a Christmas quickie, but the chapter count has gone up! I hope you don't mind too much :) Also, I took artistic license in naming Sherlock's parents. I just like those names. Thanks for reading!
"Sorry, didn't realize I was." John did know he was staring, but really, he couldn't help it. The man sat next to him was the most beautiful person he had ever seen.
John was exhausted from a number of short nights on top of the time change, but Sherlock's excitement was giving him a second wind. He pulled on his shoes, bending over to tie them. Sherlock couldn't help a quick perusal of John's fit backside. The physical reactions to arousal that he was experiencing first hand were unexpected for him, but he couldn't deny that that's exactly what was happening.
Sherlock set his glass down, leaning forward a bit. “Thank you, Debbie, you may call me Mr. Holmes, and this is my colleague, Dr. John Watson.” His long hand gestured vaguely in John’s direction. “We’re actually here on behalf of Martha Hudson. We believe you may have information that will benefit her case, as well as that of your missing husband.” He took another sip of tea, clearly savoring the overly sweet beverage. “Would you tell us about the last time you saw or spoke to your husband?” he asked.
“Oh good, you’re awake.” Sherlock was on his hands and knees, wiping up yet another accident. “I am loathe to admit this, but Mummy may have had a point. We are never getting a dog, John.”
Bloody hell, how was he supposed to relax? He was on a plane about to crash in the middle of the Atlantic ocean for god's sake!
"What's this?" Asked John. He took the envelope as he sat in his armchair. He pulled out the enclosed card and smiled as he read it. "Your parents have invited both of us to their house? That's really sweet of them to include me." John looked over at his friend. "You sure you want me to tag along? I know you don't get to see your family that often, I wouldn't want to intrude."
John hunched over the table, cradling his mug between his hands. The warmth was starting to become too much, feeling almost like his fingers were burning. He closed his eyes tightly and took a deep breath, holding it for a moment, before slowly letting it escape. He was so exhausted, not just from lack of sleep. "Why is this so hard, Mary? Why does it all feel so hard?" He clenched his hands on the table, his frustration clear.
John opened the door and ushered Mike inside. He gave him a sideways smile, but didn't verbally acknowledge the sorry attempt at a joke. "I'll text you tonight, Mike. And thanks, mate, you're a good friend." John stopped at the check-in desk to pick up files for his last few appointments. The love of his life, right. Who would want to be with an emotionless robot like him?
“Yes, unless my parents have added to the collection recently.” Sherlock stepped towards the door. “Feel free to borrow any you like, John.” Sherlock loved when John’s interest was piqued, he lit up with an internal glow. “Would you like to see your room now?” he asked.
John grunted in agreement. “Well, at least not a puppy...maybe we could rescue an older dog that’s already house trained.” John was laying on his side, head resting on his arm, appreciating the sight of Sherlock’s bum - marveling that he was allowed to appreciate said bum openly now.
John saw his shivering friend's distress, and took a blanket from the back of his armchair. "Here, wrap up. Between breathing these fumes and walking around the flat barefoot in the middle of December, you're going to make yourself sick. Don't want to be feeling poorly at Christmas!" John helped tuck the blanket around Sherlock's feet, running his hands up Sherlock's legs and stopping at his hip, making sure he was wrapped up tight. "I'll get a fire going, and try to sort out some tea for us." He turned away, just missing the faint blush that his lingering touch brought to his flatmate's cheeks.
Debbie had, by this time, recovered the use of her voice. “It’s my girlfriend, you complete and utter ass!” She screamed at him. John was unsurprised to see her pick up her glass and toss her unfinished tea in Sherlock’s face. “Get out of here, or I’m calling the actual police on grounds of harassment!” She was shaking with indignation.
Within twenty minutes, they had gathered a puppy basket, food, and toys. John, ever the practical one, grabbed a package of puppy pads that he hoped would at least get them through the night. As Sherlock was carrying the furry babe, John was elected to lug the packages back to the car.
"I know that you were in the military, RAMC, most likely. You were injured and sent home unwillingly. You must have been shot, but where and under what circumstances? I need more information to determine that. Once home, you took a job beneath your skill level. You find it unbearably boring. You also just broke up with your girlfriend, lucky for you, I'd say, because you found her unbearably boring as well. You planned on this trip saving the relationship, but ended up leaving early and alone…so she must have told you something upsetting. Right, she was seeing another man. You've decided to move out when you get back from the conference, but don't have the funds to live on your own." He smiled broadly at John, the corners of his eyes crinkling. "How did I do?" he asked.
John just shook his head, stuffing his mobile in his pocket. He really did need to go to the shop, they had nothing for dinner and of course they always needed milk. He thought out a short list, and headed into the nearby market.
Sherlock paused in the removal of his trousers, as he registered the fatigue in John’s voice. He turned and met John on the landing at the top of the stairs, noting the dark circles under the man’s eyes. “That was an unexpected Christmas treat, John.” Sherlock reached out and took his coat out of John’s arms, hanging it on the coat rack as they moved into the kitchen.
He was tall, his legs were uncomfortably cramped in the small space. He was wearing an expensive looking suit (and he smelled amazing…what was that?), and his pale skin contrasted nicely with gorgeous ebony curls. He turned towards John, piercing him with an annoyed glare, but all John saw was his unusual eyes. He couldn't name the color, maybe silvery blue? John's eyes dropped to the man's lips, he'd never seen such a pronounced Cupid's Bow…he felt his cheeks flush just looking at them.
Silver-gray and dark blue eyes met, and both men felt the frisson of attraction between them. Sherlock's body was betraying him, his cheeks flushed a bright pink. His fingers stretched as if to take the doctor's hand in his, but just as quickly he retracted them and shoved them into his pocket. Did John notice that? He thought to himself.
“Only if you promise not to drug me with it” joked John, giggling at Sherlock’s offended expression. “No thanks, but maybe later...I’m still stuffed from those sausages, it feels good to walk around”. He leaned a bit into Sherlock’s side. “Now, who do you still need to shop for? I’ve sent a voucher to Harry, but I don’t have any idea what to do for Mrs. Hudson, or your parents”.  John looked up at the sky as they walked, enjoying the way the lights glimmered. “What about Mycroft?” John asked. “Will he be gracing us with his presence?” John swerved to avoid a group of running children, and found himself grabbing Sherlock’s arm to steady himself. The wool of Sherlock’s long coat felt damp from the chilly mist in the air.
That had to have been one of the longest work days ever. Their breakup was a popular topic of discussion, every time he came out of the exam room to drop off a file at the front desk the resulting silence was deafening. He tried to escape for a few minutes in the afternoon, only to be cornered by Mike at the café around the corner.
“Sherlock. Wonderful.” Daddy Holmes smiled, stepping towards Sherlock to pull him into an easy hug. “Would it be such a bother for you to text us, let us know where you are? Your mummy was quite worried.” Daddy Holmes scolded Sherlock while holding him at arm’s-length, giving him a thorough once-over. “You look well for a change, my boy!” Daddy squeezed his shoulders, releasing him to turn to John.
John loved helping out on cases, being able to observe Sherlock’s brilliance in action. The changes he was noticing in Sherlock’s behavior...well, that conversation could wait. Sherlock typically wouldn’t eat or sleep while on a case. Somehow, John doubted an in-depth discussion about feelings would be a priority.
John had accounts on a few different social media sites, but for this request, he needed to use an encrypted email program. He opened a new message to his American friend, Bill Murray. This was a quick inquiry, he hoped Bill was around and would get back to him soon. Just as he started to think about ordering some food, his mobile chimed a text alert.
Sherlock interrupted him. “Don’t worry, John. I’ve got it covered.” The detective turned into a grand, gated entrance, stopping to give their names to the attendant. He turned to John with an animated glint in his eyes. “Ready, John? Let’s see what Mrs. Ayers can tell us.”
John shook his head in disbelief. “Wouldn’t it have made more sense to rent? What are you gonna do with this when you go back to London?” John fastened his seatbelt as Sherlock began to weave quickly in between the lines of cars.
Sherlock sat down on the bench. He was having a nice time with it being just the two of them, but maybe that wasn’t enough for John? He didn’t want to deprive John time with his friends. “John...I...I don’t know…” he stumbled. He felt uncomfortable and embarrassed at the anxiety a simple question had caused. John sat down next to Sherlock, putting a calming hand on his knee. “Hey, Sherlock....hey now, look at me.” John dipped his head down to try and catch the detective’s eye. “Hey, it’s fine. I’ll just text him back ‘thanks but we’re busy tonight’, no big deal.” John sent the text, then shoved his phone back into his pocket. “I’m having a great time just walking around with you tonight.” He could see that Sherlock felt awkward, and wanted to restore their easy, relaxed energy. “I have an idea of how to finish this evening...let’s catch a cab back to Baker Street, okay?” John stood up and held his hand out for Sherlock. Sherlock was grateful that John understood him so well. He took John’s offered hand, standing up and gathering the shopping bags. “Very well, John. Back to Baker Street.”
Dad held the puppy up for Mummy to inspect. She sighed in resignation. “That explains the strange sounds from your room last night.” She chuckled, taking the puppy in her arms for a cuddle. “This puppy will be quite a handful, Charles. I hope you know it’s up to you to care for it!” She sounded stern, but her expression was loving as she snuggled the small pup. “I suppose he needs a name, what would you like to call him?”
“Sherlock! What are you up to, standing out here?” Mummy pulled him into a hug. Releasing him, she turned her attention to John. “And you must be Sherlock’s John! Welcome, welcome...come inside! It’s too cold to be dawdling on the steps...come in, come in.” She shooed them both through the door.
John retrieved the puppy supplies from the car, and followed Sherlock up to his room. John set up puppy pads in and around the basket, which they decided would be safest on the floor inside Sherlock’s closet. Sherlock wrapped the pup in a fleece blanket, tucking him in while John filled a small dish of water. They carefully closed the closet door, agreeing to meet downstairs for a nightcap.
John smiled as he tucked his mobile in his pocket. He grabbed his wallet and his sunglasses, then pulled on his trainers and headed out.
He and Sherlock had changed into pyjama pants and old sweaters when they got home, and John made homemade hot chocolate. He opened a package of cookies while Sherlock lit the sitting room fire. They turned on the telly and sat down on the couch, deciding to watch a rerun of the 2008 Gavin & Stacey Christmas Special, which was just beginning.
Sherlock had stopped playing when he heard John stretching and moving about. He turned to face John with a small smile on his face. "Yes, John?" He replied.
John remained seated, staring blankly at the space between them. "Goodbye, John." Mary stomped out of the kitchen. He heard her grab her bag and keys, then the door opening, slamming shut behind her.
Sherlock briefly put his arm around John’s shoulders to steady him, then dropped it back, joining his hands behind himself as he strolled. “Mycroft won’t be able to make it this year. Mummy is beside herself, she’s tried bribing him with promises of cake, but has remained unsuccessful so far”. Sherlock turned his head slightly, looking down into John’s face. He couldn’t help smiling, John looked so relaxed. The holiday lights were adding golden shimmers to the deep blue of John’s eyes, and his nose and cheeks were pink from the cold.
“Oh, please. Call me Debbie. I’m nowhere near professional, but it’s good exercise.” John raised his eyebrows at the marked Southern drawl, finding it more pronounced than others he had encountered on the trip thus far.
"Did no one ever tell you it is impolite to stare?" The rich, deep voice of Mr. Holmes sent a shiver down John's spine.
Mummy was indignant. “I slaved over that cake since September, Charles. Adding brandy every week until it could have sloshed itself down to the WI meeting.” She paused, aggressively buttering a scone. “See if I ever make that kind of effort for the likes of them again!” Mummy took a deep breath. “Now, more tea for anyone?”
John groaned as he rolled over, the first rays of sunlight assaulting his eyes. The puppy had kept both him and Sherlock busy most of the night, John didn’t even remember getting himself into Sherlock’s bed.
Sherlock signed into the hotel WiFi on the complimentary iPad, beginning to research leads for the case. He needed to talk through the details and come up with a plan. What answers did he expect to get from Mrs. Ayers tomorrow? Damn, I  don't have my skull. He had a thought- his mouth forming a half-smile as he began searching the local hotels.
She knew that one would get under my skin, he thought. She's probably gone for drinks with some of the girls from the clinic.
John interrupted Dad, reaching his hand out to touch the arm of his chair. “Sir...I think I know what you’re getting at. I assure you, I would never do anything to hurt Sherlock.” John stared down at his hands, now clasped tightly around his knees. “In fact, I owe him my life. I’d do anything for your son, sir. He’s the most brilliant, surprising, resourceful...kind, caring and beautiful person I’ve ever known.” John made eye contact with Dad, deciding to share something extremely personal with him. “Sherlock and I...he told me he loves me.” John paused, still in wonder that Sherlock felt this way about him. “Tonight, he just told me tonight. Sir, I believe I...feel the same about him.” John didn’t want to say the actual words aloud until he had said them to Sherlock. “He’s been my best friend for as long as I’ve known him. Being in his life has been a great adventure so far, and I’m looking forward to a future with him in it.” John sat back, downing the rest of his whiskey in one big gulp. “As long as he’ll have me.”
I wonder what Sherlock is up to, he thought. He considered texting the man, then decided against it. Thinking about the case reminded him about the need for a gun. He looked around the room, his eyes settling on his laptop bag. He quickly retrieved it, setting himself up at the desk.
“There hasn’t been a dog in the house for years, John. I know Dad wants one, and Mummy can’t say no if he’s a gift.” Sherlock tucked the puppy into the folds of his great coat.
"I cannot allow you to keep harassing your fellow passengers, Mr. Holmes. You have already upset a number of people and been asked to move seats twice. This is the last straw, sir. There is only one other empty seat on this flight, I'm afraid I have to ask you to remove yourself from this row and follow me towards the rear of the plane." The attendant turned her head, scanning the back rows, and caught John's eye.
-John! I have been calling for Mrs. Hudson for hours with no response. I am unsure whether she is out or possibly dead. Please come home immediately and check. -SH
John felt the loss of contact, his breathing slowed a bit but he didn't quite feel in control of himself. Sherlock reached his arm behind John's shoulders, pulling him in to lean more comfortably against his side. "Alright?" Sherlock asked. Again, John nodded once. His cheek rubbed against the fine fabric of Sherlock's suit jacket. "That's it. Try to take a deep breath. Count three on the inhale, hold for three, and three on the release." Sherlock's voice in his ear was deep, his breath warm against his cheek. John closed his eyes and tried to follow his direction. It wasn't long until he had his breathing under control.
He took a moment to appreciate the sight of John spread across his bed, his sweater pulled up to reveal a tempting strip of skin. It was regrettable that their first night as a couple had been spent wrangling his father’s Christmas gift, rather than each other.
Mother requested my help with this. You know as well as I do that if I  were to let her down, I  would never hear the end of it. - SH
"Umm. John." Sherlock said, swinging his legs off the sofa and following John, the blanket wrapped around his shoulders like a cape.
"Yeah, let's get this day over with! I could go the rest of my life without seeing another runny nose. Give me a strange, unexplained rash any day!" Mike had jumped up, sauntering to the front of the café. He held the door open for a couple of giggling girls. John followed him out to the pavement, and turned to head back to the clinic. "Of course I'll help you find a new flat," continued Mike. "You can kip at mine as long as you need to, you know Karen would be happy to have you. She's an amazing cook as well." Mike patted his rounded belly ruefully. "So send me a text tonight and let me know when you get to the hotel, yeah? Karen and I are on tomorrow’s flight, so maybe we can meet for dinner or something." Mike stopped abruptly outside the clinic entrance. "Who knows, maybe you'll meet the love of your life on this trip!" he chuckled.
John felt flustered. He took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “Okay, well...we need to have something to eat and get some sleep before we leave, at least a few hours. I’ll make us a snack while you shower.” He turned and headed back to the kitchen, calling back over his shoulder “And don’t take all day styling your hair!” John giggled as he heard the detective swear at him good-naturedly.
Snow had just begun to fall. Sherlock reached up, running his thumb over John’s cheek, collecting snowflakes. “I love you, John.” As he had hoped, he saw the love and desire he felt for this wonderful man mirrored in John’s eyes, in the curve of his lips. “I must confess to you that my understanding of romance and relationships is limited at best...but what I know is how you make me feel complete when we are together. How I feel empty when we are apart. I...John, I…” Sherlock stopped speaking, because John had lifted his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders and was pulling him close.
"No, we never got to that. It's a bit of a long story, though. The short version is that I'm doing a favor for a friend." Sherlock found himself itching to tell John all the details, he was sure John would be excited about the case.
“Sure, to be continued.” John felt deflated. Working up the courage to be open about feelings takes a lot out of a man, he thought. “I’m asking to see baby photos, Sherlock. Don’t think I won’t!” John giggled at the horror-stricken look on Sherlock’s face.
John leaned in, their foreheads touching, sharing the warmth of breath in the cold night air. “You are the most brilliant, captivating, magnificent, lovely man, Sherlock.” John’s voice sounded choked with emotion. He took a deep breath in before he continued. “As you have undoubtedly observed, I struggle with relationships as well. Would you...do you want to…” John was shaking with emotion under Sherlock’s hands. “We could figure it out together, yeah?” John moved forward, gently kissing Sherlock’s lips. It was glorious.
He raised his eyes to meet hers. "You've been so distant. I need more than this, John. I hate to tell you like this." She hesitates, looks away.  Hugging her arms about herself again, she looks up almost defensively. "I've been seeing someone else, John. I didn't know how to tell you…"
“Not for the four people that were killed it wasn’t.” John removed his own jacket and Sherlock’s scarf, hanging them up before moving to fill the kettle. “You were brilliant as usual, the way you deduced that poor parking attendant in front of his boss though...he’ll be looking for a new job come New Year’s!” John chuckled wearily.
"Sherlock!" John hissed under his breath. He was beginning to see the treatment that his fellow flight passengers had been subjected to, and why they may have had an issue with the detective.
It was at this point (right...those are his nipples!) that John realized his flatmate was wearing nothing but his trousers. “Hang on, how did you get out of your clothes so fast...even your socks!” John felt his face flush with heat. He turned to grab the tea bags, hoping that Sherlock wouldn’t notice the effect that the proximity of his body was having.
Sherlock's eyes followed the path of John's tongue with interest. Fascinating, he thought. He had never experienced this connection with another person before, and he didn't quite know what to make of it.
John rubbed his hand across his face sleepily, then scrubbed it through his hair. He sat up, suddenly realizing that his position was almost in the detective's lap. "Oh my God, Sherlock! I'm so sorry. Why didn’t you push me off? I hope you weren't too uncomfortable. God. I'm really sorry" John exclaimed. Could this night get any more embarrassing?!
“I didn’t rent this, John - I bought it. Well, Mycroft bought it, he just doesn’t know it yet.” Sherlock smirked as he eased out to join the traffic on Biscayne Boulevard.
"What's going on, John? I heard you and Mary are finished? Are you still up for the conference, I don't want to be insensitive, but I was really looking forward to a week of sun. And some interesting master classes. The States really do these things up right, you know?" Mike spoke in a rush. "I've been rushed off my feet this week, it'll be a relief to be back at the hospital soon as well, won't it?" He had hurriedly added two packs of sugar and a creamer to his to-go cup of coffee, and shoved a wrapped sandwich into his jacket pocket.
"My client is Mrs. Martha Hudson. Her husband Richard is currently incarcerated at the Federal Detention Center here in Miami. She was visiting relatives in Hampshire when an attempt was made on her life. She was lucky, the would be assassin turned out to be a terrible shot. My mother and Mrs. Hudson are old school friends - she remembered that our family estate was nearby, and made her way to the relative safety of my family's parlor. After considerable prompting and frankly an appalling amount of tea, my mother was able to piece together the details of her predicament. Knowing of my brilliant professional record for solving mysteries, of course Mummy called me and asked me to take her case." Sherlock spoke quickly and expressively, his hands helping to emphasize and embellish his story.
“Mr. Holmes, thank you for the invitation.” John stuffs his hands in his pockets, feeling shy in the face of so much friendly acceptance. “Your slippers are fantastic!”
John gathered his things for the shower and bounded back down the stairs, where he saw Sherlock, now engrossed in his laptop in the sitting room. The fading light from the front windows combined with the fairy lights to cast a halo-like glow around the man. The heat from the fire had given Sherlock uncustomary rosy cheeks, and suddenly John was struck with the urge to run his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, and envisioned pulling his friends’ face close and kissing him.
Suddenly the plane went into a nose dive, the oxygen masks dropping from the ceiling. People were screaming…there was an explosion from somewhere behind him. John felt his entire body clench in preparation for impact, momentarily forgetting that he would sustain less injuries if he could stay relaxed.
“Not at all, John, don’t you worry yourself!” Mummy said briskly but sympathetically. “Now, let’s get down to the kitchen for some breakfast, why don’t we?” Mummy began to step into the room, then seemed to think better of it. “And Sherlock, bring down any laundry you might have, alright? I’ll throw a load in and have it back to you this afternoon.” She turned to leave. “See you both downstairs!”
They stood, leaning into one another, indulging in this first moment of mutual understanding, enjoying the shift from friends to more than. Sherlock was the first to step back, leaving John feeling the chill of his absence.
Dad looked at her over the edge of his mug, harrumphing in amusement. Sherlock narrowed his eyes in inquiry, studying his mother. She returned his look defensively, shooting an annoyed glance at her husband.
John leaned his head back and closed his eyes. The beginnings of a headache were just starting to take shape. "I'm going to try and get a nap in before we land. I really appreciate your kindness, Sherlock. I guess it was a lucky thing for me that you got disciplined by that flight attendant." the smirk was evident in John's tone.
"I was able to track shipments from Colombia to Miami, and from Miami into the Dominican Republic. The lack of security and technological resources in the Caribbean ports made it almost comically simple to follow the trail, it's a wonder he wasn't caught sooner." Sherlock had been staring at John's hands as he spoke, admiring the compact strength held in check. He raised his eyes to John's face, and he felt his cheeks flush when he observed the doctor smiling warmly at him.
John squeezed his detective's hand in comfort, and smiled indulgently up at him. "Of course, Sherlock. I don't want to be separated from you either." He felt ridiculously pleased as the blush colored his detective's beautiful face.
"Would you be able to reach that package of Ryvita for me? Of course the only one left is pushed all the way back, and I need a step stool on a good day." The girl smiled, apologetic and charming.
John raised his eyebrows, and turned to get a better look at Sherlock. "Consulting detective? That sounds exciting. What exactly does it mean, though? People come to you with their problems and you help them?" John noticed that Sherlock hadn't addressed the girlfriend issue at all. Hmmm. Should he risk asking again, or just leave it? Leave it, for now, at least.
Sherlock hated leaving John behind.  His older brother Mycroft, who occupied a small role in the British government, had helpfully seen to it that Sherlock's trek through Customs was quick and painless. He grabbed his luggage from the carousel and located the private driver that was waiting for him.
Sherlock took the folder, setting it aside. “That’s good, John, because we leave after lunch. Did you happen to pack your gun?” He asked, ignoring the incredulous look John gave him.
“Oh, of course. It’s all been so horrible. We weren’t terribly close, you know, but we did socialize as couples now and again.” Debbie closed her eyes, putting a hand (rather dramatically, John thought) to her forehead.
"You don't mind, do you? It's just that we have a few days here, and while I don't think we need to get a tree, I know you like things to feel festive. I thought this might do the trick." He waved his bow about to encompass the cheerful sitting room. Sherlock had wanted to surprise John, but maybe he should have waited and asked if John wanted to decorate together?
It was almost noon by the time Sherlock settled into the driver’s seat and plugged his phone in, choosing a Spotify playlist. John adjusted the heat settings from the passenger seat and sat back. He was asleep before they were even out of London.
"Are you joking? It's brilliant! I can't believe you did all this while I was napping right here!" John was shocked with his flatmates' actions, for once in a good way. "Would you be up for going out to eat tonight? Maybe we could get in a bit of gift shopping as well." John turned towards the stairs, ready to head up to his room. “I’ll just take a quick shower, yeah? Then we can head out.” He stopped and smiled over his shoulder at his friend. “This is really great, Sherlock. Really. Thanks.” He took the stairs two at a time, more energetic than he had been when he first came home.
Sherlock stood silently, holding John’s sleepy form close to him. What does this mean? Does this mean anything? Is it possible...could John have...romantic...feelings for him? Sherlock’s mind was racing behind his stoic exterior. Sherlock didn’t have answers to his many questions, but as the world’s only consulting detective, he knew the way to find them...experimentation. He slowly moved a hand from John’s back, up to cup his head. He positioned John’s head just a bit closer to his face, ruffling the hair at the nape of John’s neck with his fingers. Sherlock slowly brought his face down, gently pressing his lips to John’s forehead. John continued to snuggle contentedly, saying “I had so much fun with you tonight. Wish it was Christmas all year.” Sherlock smiled - interesting results, he thought to himself.
Sherlock smirked. "I'm not in the habit of taking a holiday - one would need "proper" employment for it to qualify as a holiday." He put a disdainful emphasis on the word holiday, as if anyone who needed a holiday should be ashamed of themselves.
As he held him up to get a good look, the sleepy pup did a huge yawn, concluding with a thick pink tongue licking Sherlock on the nose. Sherlock turned to John with a pleading look.
Sherlock was tapping his foot impatiently under the table. His pretense of charm was dropped in favor of exasperation. “Yes, yes. Of course, he had lost interest in you, the marriage, etcetera. What did he say to you  - exactly - before you left?” John subtly kicked Sherlock’s shin, earning himself an affronted squawk from the detective.
John settled back in his seat, crossing his arms over his chest. “You’re a brilliant madman, Sherlock Holmes. I’ll take your word for it.” John looked out the window, trying to keep track of the turns. “So...where are we going?” he asked.
"Honestly, John, I'm not sure. It depends on my contacts here. But don't worry, I'll find you" Sherlock promised.
"So he's a drug trafficking middle-man. What about his partner? Is Ayers in jail as well? He must have realized what was going on. And what, they got busted, right? What happened, a raid on their local warehouse?"  John sat back in his chair.
Their shoulders bumped companionably as they made their way along the crowded walkway. Sherlock had suggested the Christmas market at the Tate Modern, where they could grab a bite to eat and then browse the stalls for gifts. He didn’t enjoy holiday merrymaking as a general rule, but the thought of walking with John through the beautiful wooden chalets, looking at the lights and enjoying the music...well. That was a different matter. “Would you like mulled wine, or perhaps a cider?” Sherlock placed his hand on John’s elbow to get his attention.
The view from the floor to ceiling windows would be spectacular in daylight, but at the moment he only saw his own reflection in the glass. He picked up the remote that controlled the drapes and watched as they smoothly shut.
John couldn't believe his good luck. It was the week before Christmas, and he was actually leaving work early. The clinic had been overrun with colds and flu, and most of the staff were taking their vacation days, so he had expected a long (and boring) week. He could never have predicted the cold snap, burst pipes and collapsed roof section that followed. Thankfully no one had been injured, but the clinic couldn't operate in its current state. The staff had all been sent home until further notice, which likely meant after the holidays.
They stopped to admire the breathtakingly gorgeous chandelier, then continued through the lobby to the 1930's House. John had read about this place online, and was not disappointed. It was a restored Florida style bungalow turned cocktail/tapas bar. The living room had been cozily furnished, and sported wood beam ceilings and a limestone fireplace. The club chairs near the (thankfully unlit) fireplace looked wonderfully comfortable. John planned to use the intimate setting to his advantage and get to know Sherlock better.
Seeing as it was late on Christmas Eve, the shop selection for suitable gifts was minimal. After some spirited bickering and a few silent sulks, Sherlock and John finally agreed on a gift for Dad. Inside the final shop, there was a basket by the door with a sign stating “Free to a Good Home”. Sherlock reached into the basket, gently lifting out a tiny black puppy.
John hoped that Sherlock was getting more from this woman than he was. “So...that’s when you called the police?” he asked.
"No problem. Happy Christmas." He hesitated, considering asking her name, maybe inviting her for a coffee. The last few dates he had been on had been unsuccessful, never progressing past the first awkward drinks or dinner. This girl was cute and friendly, why not enjoy his unexpected afternoon off?
Sherlock dropped the pillow onto John, then threw himself down to cover the doctor. He was rewarded with a surprised squawk, which quickly turned into John’s signature giggle. John threw his elbow back, connecting sharply with Sherlock’s midriff, which earned him a loud “Ooofffhhh!” in return. John twisted himself around, pulling Sherlock into a more comfortable position. John lay his head down in the crook of Sherlock’s arm, resting on his shoulder. Sherlock wrapped his arms around the doctor, gently squeezing him and kissing John’s temple.
“Oh John, we had the best time. I only needed a few bits and bobs, you know, but we had fun window shopping.” Mrs. Hudson turned, looking around the kitchen. “Where has Sherlock gone? I thought I heard him talking to someone...I only noticed because it was quite early, you know.” She picked up a cloth and started wiping the kitchen counters, then filled the electric kettle and switched it on. John glanced around the sitting room, but didn’t see anything that would indicate Sherlock’s current whereabouts. He glanced down the hallway, where Sherlock’s bedroom door was completely closed. That’s unusual, he thought.
"Where are you staying? I'd like to take you to dinner, it's the least I can do to thank you for everything you put up with tonight." John didn't want to let this man go, not without knowing when he would see him next.
Mummy took it, and pulled him closer. “John, you must call me Mummy, or Mum is fine, too. Sherlock has raved about you, and we consider you part of the family now. Daddy can’t wait to meet you.” Mummy was so warm and genuine, John couldn’t help but feel at ease. Sherlock caught his eye and gave him a look that John could only describe as tender. He felt his cheeks go pink as he smiled at them both.
"Here we are, sir. Excuse me ma'am, this gentleman will be sitting in the middle seat for the remainder of the flight. Would you mind standing so that he can get by? Thank you so much." The older lady in the aisle seat grumbled a bit under her breath, but stood so that the man could be seated next to John. The attendant leaned down in an attempt to keep the conversation private. "Now, we won't be having any more trouble out of you, will we, Mr. Holmes? Good. I really don't want to have to report you to security when we land. Please just try and keep quiet for the remainder of our flight." The flight attendant stood up, pulling the bottom of her jacket to straighten it. She smiled tightly at John, then turned and headed back to Business Class.
"It's not that I don't want to have a party, although no, I don't want to have a party." Sherlock leaned against the counter, watching John prepare the tea.
