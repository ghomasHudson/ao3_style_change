It was quite embarrassing. It was all fine and well for Stark, probably, but a young healthy Barrayaran that even Vorromanof couldn't make go on a date...
"And, after another unsuccessful attempt to apply to the Academy, this weird guy contacted me. He said he was from Escobar, but his accent was not. He told me his name was Abraham, and that he was working on a revolutionary medical procedure," Steve sipped his tea, thinking to himself that this time it tasted even better. "I had nothing to lose, so I agreed. As it turned out, Abraham was in charge of... let's say, biochemical part of the experiment. There was also a technical one, and that was in the hands of your father. He looked just like you, only with short hair and no face paint. He introduced himself as Walter, suggested I call him Volt, and I quickly realized, why."
"This one doesn't even need fast-penta," whispered Vorbarton, passing Steve by with a glass of something non-alcoholic, and then whisked away a fellow with too big a mouth from the crowd surrounding the Consul and quickly but efficiently explained to him what he was doing wrong.
They ate in silence. The car was quickly cooling down with its engine turned off, and Steve shuddered.
Steve was going to share his opinion on a rather useful habit of knocking before entering, but reconsidered: it wasn't his house after all, and Tony had all right to expect his rules to be followed here.
"This is a very strange Cetagandan," muttered Vorbarton, coming alive again. "And what is it with him sneaking up on people?" Based on Steve's knowledge of his friend, Clint firmly believed he held the monopoly on sneaking up. That was not without reason, either, because even in military issued boots Vorbarton always managed to move quietly.
"I was waiting for that 'but'," Tony gave him a winning smile, switching levers on his wheelchair without looking. "Lead on, genius."
"You can take any room on the first floor, except for the last one on the left, Pepper lives there. She's in Milan now, but she has a nasty habit of coming back home unexpectedly. Then again, I'm pretty sure she's gonna like you, even if she suddenly finds you in her bed..."
Tony stopped and turned to look at him. He was standing a few steps higher than Steve, with his leg raised awkwardly in the air, and frowning at him in confusion.
Janet caught up to him in the corridor and hugged him so hard his still healing ribs screamed in protest. She told him, three times already and not missing any details, that she and Hank got engaged, right in that room, tied up and stunned.
"In the common tongue, Yu Ju means jade pole," the ghem-lord added with a somewhat peculiar smile. Steve thought that he should get a new manual, this time on Cetagandan tea, and possibly a third one about Cetagandan innuendos.
"There's a bus, and then you'll have to walk five miles." Sharon squinted. "Are you one of those? You're gonna pull gold?"
"Me neither," Steve nodded. "But there's another issue, beside your mother's project. Somebody tried to sabotage you and to possibly kidnap me. And it was clearly not her. Who would benefit from it?"
"Good. It's good you apologized, but don't call him. I don't need medicine, only hot drinks, warmth and rest," Stark went silent for a moment. "I shouldn't have lashed out and said all those things about your father. Sorry."
Bucky had been a natural at most weapons, which was no surprise to Steve. Bucky had been training ever since they were kids to be a soldier, while Steve was kept out for being too skinny and sickly. Sam was great at long distance weapons which paired nicely with his wings. Steve meanwhile didn’t really like using weapons. He had a circular shield Thor had gifted him which, like Thor’s hammer, always returned to Steve and that was good enough for him.
1. Warriors dress means the Hercules outfit. I don’t know how to describe it so just know when I say “warriors dress” I mean the basic hero garb Hercule’s wears in the movie.
“He led us to the Hydra, he’s in the Monster Bog and he’s not worried about his own safety. He’s dangerous and is probably a monster in disguise.” She stated and Bucky nodded in agreement readying his own weapon.
“But you can’t.” Tony tried to shrug but with his restrained arms it was difficult. “Again, not that powerful.” He said as if he was stating a fact.
“How about this?” Loki offered, putting his silver tongue to good use. “If I or anyone who works for me hurts or harms Tony in any way, then you all get your strengths back, instantly.”
“And here I was looking forward to the spa session.” Tony teased with a sly smirk and Steve blushed crimson again.
After what seemed like a whole afternoon of wrestling, Howard had called them in. Dinner was an awkward affair because Maria Stark joined them.
“Are you sure you should be taking Tony? He’s so young and a battlefield is so dangerous.” Maria asked worriedly as she set the table for breakfast.
The group of mortals began dancing around the only remaining head, obviously setting up for another attack. Loki seethed and was ready to jump in and just kill the mortals himself when a boom of thunder resounded across the gorge. The thunder was so loud it even caused the Hydra to pause. Then a blinding flash of light lit up the gorge and another, louder, clap of thunder resonated.
“Sweety, you said yourself he rushed out of here with two mortals correct?” Amora questioned from her lounging position against one of the main entrance’s pillars.
“He was an idiot.” Tony bit out, finally lifting his gaze properly to see Steve cross his arms over his chest, still dressed in that costume bright under-top, the darker pants and red boots.
As Tony came back out, once again in the Black Sabbath top he had been wearing on the helicarrier, Fury contacted him to sort out search and rescue initially with the police who would help organise the chaos on the streets as everyone panicked about where their loved ones had gone in the attack. The Director also told him that he might have to read a short notice for a news camera to assure people that things were calming down and what to do if they couldn’t find someone, but he was sending someone over to write something rather than having him make something up when he was still dog-tired.
“I’m not taking any photos of this.” Falsworth promised, and Steve could feel his amusement along their surface bond.
“The Scream by Edvard Munch.” She nodded, her expression still warm, even as her smile faded. “Or I think it’s called Shriek originally. Do you know anything about it?”
“The 107th?” Steve asked, jumping to his feet. He knew his sentinel wasn’t dead but he didn’t expect any more than that these days, he’d been away from Bucky for so long. But the idea that his friend was so close and he hadn’t known… Was he captured, or had Steve been sitting a few tents away from him all this time.
Apparently Fury had let the sentinel read through some files as well. “Doesn’t matter.” Tony stated, turning to look back at his sentinel. “If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost.”
Rogers nodded and Tony headed out to his own room. In his house in Malibu, he had a range of generic clothing for men and women of any size, but Rhodey, Happy and Pepper were the only ones who had ever stayed at the tower. Any hook-ups here were brief encounters in hotel rooms because he didn’t have random people up here.
Steve sighed and sent Tony a wry grin as he recalled the request that the older man had made as he’d flown towards the portal.
“You save people with it.” Steve concluded, a smile stretching over his face as a bubble of pride for his guide welled up within him.
He was hustled back to London, though he could remember none of the journey. He sat and thought of all the ways Bucky could have survived, the thought that he had landed on a ledge and was waiting for Steve to come get him.
“Captain. He received a promotion for agreeing to this experiment.” Stark replied, his casual tone at odds with the anger that was brewing inside him.
“No? You are not the man the good doctor chose? Captain Rogers, the real inspiration for Captain America?” The man asked as he stepped onto the walkway and slowly paced towards them.
Steve noticed an increase in Thor’s concern, both seeping into the air and on his face. “He’s a friend.” Thor said, which explained the strong emotions. Steve wasn’t bonded to the aliens in either a light or a true bond, that combined with what Fury had described to him as natural shielding to a guide’s
Steve couldn’t help the blush that spread over his cheeks; he wasn’t used to praise. “Thank you.” He looked up at the older man, and gave him a soft smile. “I think you’re a good man too.”
“Sixty seven years…” He forced out, his voice stiff as he tried to imagine such a length of time. “I’m just gonna…” He mumbled, but Mr Jarvis said he could head to the kitchen when ready as Steve staggered into the bathroom, the door sliding smoothly shut behind him.
“Go enjoy your two minute shower.” Tony rolled his eyes and Steve laughed as he left. Tony had mocked him several times over the week for how little time he took to get clean.
“Agent Carter.” Stark said, shifting enough to tuck Steve’s face into his neck as he spoke. “You two just in the area, or were you here for a reason?”
“JARVIS? Find out who he is and, you know, what’s going on.” The older man said softly, wondering if he should step in and do something as the kid began to gasp, his eyes staring blankly ahead. “How do I help?” He tagged on, not caring if Rogers or JARVIS answered, so long as he got an answer.
“I was wrong, Director. The world hasn’t changed a bit.” He allowed the bitter note to seep into his tone as he glowered.
“So you…” Steve wondered if she was going to say no to Stark later, if she might have said yes if Steve had asked her. “Would you… fondue?” His words didn’t come out right at all, but asking a woman what she thought of him was difficult.
“No! My son!” a woman sobbed behind him as he crouched behind some large pipelines and listened carefully. “No! Don’t hurt him! No!”
“Uh, yeah? No!” Tony objected, not wanting to see his bond mate flattened before he’d gotten a second chance with him. “Bad call. He loves his hamm-” Thor smacked him with the hammer.
“Well, the idea is that a long time ago, humans were once very similar to monkeys, but over time we… changed… Lost the fur, stopped living in trees, began to write and use language more specifically, that kind of thing?”
He knew Howard would never have been able to resist the chance to get his hands on the Tesseract. Steve wouldn’t be surprised if Howard had helped develop these after finding the cube in the ocean, before he died. He wondered how different the man’s son was. “I’m sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep-”
Curling over, he turned about and charged at him again, managing to dodge out the way of Thor’s fist, but not Steve’s shield as it thumped into both of them and ricocheted back into his sentinel’s grip.
“Not as much as I should have. Sorry. Next time.” But Erskine’s inability to keep a smile on his face let Steve know they were starting soon.
Sixty seven years… He should have been approaching twenty three, not ninety! He shivered as he held back laughter; growing up, he’d always hoped to just make it to his next birthday and in the army, he just hoped to make it to the end of his next mission. He would never have thought he could make it to eighty nine. Never.
“Iron Man suits?” Steve asked, as Tony was clearly waiting for the chance to explain, his warm brown eyes alight with his interest.
“Yes sir. Normal flight time would take more than seven hours but if I keep track of airline communications, I should be able to increase your speed so that your reach your destination about half an hour after SHIELD does.”
“There’s more to try,” Pepper ran a hand over her daughter’s head and Steve waved at her, turning back to Tony to see him share a quick look with Nat.
“It was good to see you, buddy,” Tony clapped him on his shoulder, a quick grip of warmth that carefully didn’t linger and Steve nodded with a soft quirk of his lips.
Steve nodded and inhaled slowly, feeling the air line his lungs with an ever-present memory of battle-smoke.
“What the hell will I say to the people who apparently aren’t my parents anymore?” Tony had bloodshot eyes but his voice was calmer after the water, “What will
“Okay, okay, you’ve got the space,” Steve moved away and stared between Bruce and their test subject, “You can do this, Bruce.”
Tony quirked his lips at Steve and he knew, he knew what the man was going to say even before he opened his mouth.
“You okay?” Steve asked quietly, glancing at Tony discreetly as they waited, “I don’t think throwing up will help our case.”
It was that confidence, the want to build upon it, that made Steve’s heart beat strong when Tony cheated at the Scrabble.
That was when Tony got his glasses and Steve remembered a time when they had shielded him from those who would use the faintest vulnerabilities against him.
“Guys? I’ve got the Sceptre and am on my way,” he tried when Scott began cursing after a pause, steps speeding up, “Whatever it is, meet me at the back alley.”
“I’ll have you know that I don’t consider this a date,” Tony declared, flicking a switch to pull up the tracking screen, “You still owe me something special, Captain Rogers, don’t think I’ve forgotten your promise.”
"Get your man out of here," Potts rolled his eyes at Steve but nodded when he got a concerned look, "If you two do your jobs, I'll get back to my own worrywart soon. Don't worry, he's pretty picky about me dying and I have no intention of ruining our anniversary plans."
“A sleepover for the birthday girl,” Tony looked at an excited Natasha and smiled his best smile, “Sounds like a great idea, doesn’t it?”
"How do we stop him?" Tony asked as he checked his phone for any reply from Sam, considering leaving one for Steve before closing the phone.
The view of the lake was stunning when Steve opened his eyes in a time that had been his only home once upon a time. He had landed beside the bench, a few good feet away from the spot he had left from, and Steve turned to see his old friends looking as young as he had last seen them.
Holding the frayed leather together, he worked the unnecessarily long needle, dark brown thread in, piercing sharp and out. A needle is all he had asked but apparently it meant a surgical weapon in Natasha’s book. In and out it went still, his fingers catching rhythm. One on one over another. It was oddly calming, bringing worn out edges together and making things whole again, even if they wouldn’t be the same as before. A patchwork job was still better than remaining split open.
When he finally moved from kissing the dimpled chin, Tony caught Steve's face and lightly ran his thumbs over the cheekbones, letting Steve keep his eyes closed for another moment. It was okay. He knew what he would see when they opened.
Caring was simple and brown-wrapped and habitual; the puddles stepped into on a drying road just because you knew that it was a quiet thrill. It was vulnerable and for Tony's blue heart to rest against his own flesh covered strength was a hushed revelation of a new level of that. Steve didn't know if Tony realized that, if the man with an armour for every situation knew what this meant.
"Nobody died," Tony assured quickly, shaking his head at the suspicious look on Potts' face, "Really, nobody's dead but – well, the team split up. Doesn't this happen in your past?"
They went quiet. Steve looked at the city, at Ben walking down below, and at Janet - just with the corner of his eye. For the first time since he came to this world, he wanted to draw something.
"Of course, she didn't," confirmed Howard. "If three people know something, everybody knows it. Two still have a chance to keep it secret."
"What, did you expect modifications here as well? They went out of fashion during my grandfather's time. So, no ten differences here."
"And? For the record, that's not a good reason to look at me like I'm an Aral Vorkosigan monument that came alive," he sighed, again.
During his third week working at the shop he found a dusty Beretta under the cash register. It was a small, smooth gun, heavy, but fitting well in his hand. Before that Steve ever only saw modern firearms on pictures on the internet and didn't even imagine he would see one in real life.
Steve went for the coffee machine, trying to look as calm as possible with Happy's inquiring gaze practically burning his back.
“No!” Bucky defended in a frustrated tone, and then Natasha held up a hand, halting him from saying anything further.
Steve’s face dropped as what Tony said sunk in. Abruptly he stopped walking then gently grabbed Tony’s hand in order to stop him as well. They were in the garden, right in front of a beautiful fountain. The sun had now set so only the torches lit up the otherwise dark and secluded area. Steve then grabbed Tony’s other hand so both were clasped in front of them.
“And yeah I did know him. You could say he’s the type of guy that doesn’t listen very well. He hears “No” as “Yes” and “Get lost” as “Take me, I’m yours.””
Unfortunately he was still owned by Loki. While he wasn’t chained to the palace or Loki’s side, he wasn’t free to run off and do whatever he wanted. He had duties and responsibilities he had to see to before he could do anything.
1. Can you tell I LOVE Tony and Rhodey friendship?! I see a lot of fics focus on Pepper and Tony’s friendship/relationship, which yes is awesome but, Rhodey!! So Pepper’s friendship takes a backseat and Rhodes and Tones gets the front in this fic
Steve explained what had happened and then the two talked everything over. Tony told Steve about his involvement in Loki’s plan; and Steve told Tony all about Peggy and his acceptance of her death. Afterwards they just laid with each other.
“Some wanna-be-heros were in the Monster Bog so I have to wait till their gone or dead, you know, the usual.” Tony shrugged and Loki nodded in affirmation.
Fenrir yipped and was shifting sizes at a rapid pace. Once Tony had stopped running and planted himself between the two parties, Fenrir grew to an enormous size.
The Avengers sans Phil and Betty then made their way to the Monster Bog. They scanned and thoroughly searched the road and surrounding area for any sign of Tony. However, in the end they found nothing.
“Mortal!” Loki boomed, gaining the restless's shade’s attention. “You have died. You are now in my realm of Hel. You must accept that your living life is over. However you may find peace in your afterlife, if you accept it. If you do not then you may find more horrors here than in the living world.”
“Then I’ll carry you around until we stumble upon it or you relent and tell me.” The blonde joked getting another laugh from the shorter man.
“We’re here for you.” Bruce said encouragingly and Tony spared him a quick smile but then wrung his hands together again.
Eventually Steve returned and gestured for the group to follow him. After traveling through the trees for a little bit of time they happened upon a track area. The track was one you would run a horse on. It didn’t look very used but on the other side of the track, giving the group a hesitant wave, was Tony.
“Any idea what the statue is of?” Tony asked as they all got on their horses. “Or is this just another perk to being a superstar? Getting invited to all the big events.”
“Do you get it now?” He asked harshly. “Loki knows they haven’t slept with Thor and still wants them dead.”
1. Finally! Our main couple has finally interacted. Good lord this was a lot of world building. This is what happens when you have a fic idea build up for 7+ years.
They rejoined Bucky and Thor in the clearing and sat down with them. Thor offered to deliver letters and any other items Bucky and Steve wished delivered. Both boys immediately went off to write up some letters and pack some items. When they came back Bucky had a package of envelopes and Steve had a tied up bag that he carried reverently.
Instead of responding Loki pulled the blonde into a demanding kiss. Thor was not about to turn down a tumble with his lover, so he dropped the question. He then grabbed Loki’s bare thighs and hoisted him up, so the slimmer god could wrap his legs around Thor’s waist.
“Tony, you have to believe me!” The blonde urged. “I’m not! None of us! None of us are sleeping with Thor!” He said Thor’s name as if the very idea of sex with him was rediculous.
“What if you could do something?” Howard interrupted not looking at either boys but staring hard at the floor.
. It wasn’t for this story I just asked for a Greek myth thorki pic, but it did inspire me to always have Loki shirtless so I’m putting it up here. Here’s her
Bruce just shook his head and flopped down on a chair. “I had no idea you lived in a place this massive.”
Loki rolled his eyes at Thor's whining as he unfurled more of the current scroll he was reading. “Researching about the realm under my rule. What an odd concept.” He muttered sarcastically.
The formal air quickly dropped and the god put on a confused face, one eyebrow raising and lifting one hand up in a confused manner.
“Plus we can’t bring him in.” Sam pointed out. “We’re the Avengers! It’d be odd for us to bring our -no offense” He looked at Tony who nodded “roadie into battle with us.”
“Outside of town” Tony rushed throwing an arm off into the distance “In the gorge. I was walking and saw the rockslide. A terrible rockslide!” Tony gasped appearing to have a hard time catching his breath. The crowd around them grew as more people came to investigate what was happening, but the group of hero’s attention was zeroed in on Tony. “I heard screaming and people are trapped! Alive but trapped! They need help!”
“Because he told me and he lives here.” He gestures around them. “Like you said this isn't a very welcoming place for people.”
Amora looked stricken then turned and asked everyone the same question. Each answered the same way. Finally she reached Steve.
“Betty?” Tony finished and Steve looked surprised as Tony scoffed. “Cap, Bruce isn’t harassing Betty. They’re dating.”
“Good Man! Now tonight we get drunk!” They shared a small chuckle at the decree and continued walking back to the others. .
!” He then turned his back to Tony and ranted at the sky. “And Odin hasn’t done anything because he’s happy that Thor has finally disregarded me! The last runt of the Jotunn line has been dealt with and hidden away!” Loki sprung back around and was fully blue and red eyed.
They kissed for some time, till a few loud and pointed coughs broke them up. Tony and Steve slowly backed away from each other. As they parted, time seemed to slow down. They both opened their eyes and stared at each other as they pulled apart. Steve smiled and Tony averted his gaze, everything coming down on him at once.
“I merely am eager to see friend Tony again. It has been sometime since I’ve last seen you.” Thor said throwing his smile to the brunette in his arms.
The next day the Avengers were getting a very official send off into the labyrinth: the royalty, their court, and a sizable crowd were all gathered. King Minos said no map had been made but offered them string so they could find their way out. The Avengers gratefully accepted this offer, which was handed to them by a silent and slightly shaking Queen Pasiphae.  When Steve went to take the ball, the Queen seemed to grip the ball tighter and showed reluctance in handing it off. Only when King Minos shifted closer did she release it with a watery breath. Steve had stared at the Queen for a few seconds then silently turned and made his way to the entrance of the labyrinth.
Tony gave a brighter smile and gestured to all of Steve. “Look at you! You always know how to handle your team. You take charge of every situation. You are a Captain, leading your crew.” Steve looked bashful and like he was about to deny it when the brunette pushed his shoulder good naturedly. “Just accept it. It’s not changing.”
“I don’t think anyone ever did. I mean we all knew it was Tony.” Bruce shrugged. “He’s the only one who whistles.”
The Avengers and Pepper were transported to the edges of the Field of Content Souls. Upon being dropped from the portal everyone looked ready to fight and thus were severely thrown when all that greeted them were baffled souls. Pepper waved the souls away with a quick announcement of official business.
I don’t regret any of my time here.” He finally caught Tony’s eyes and held them “You are not a burden Tones. You’re my friend and I can’t wait to travel the living world with you.” Tony smiled at that and Rhodey pulled him into a hug.
Steve startled and looked at him with a growing smile. Erskine glanced over at the small man and gave a small smile.
“It’s not about that!” Sam yelled as he swooped down and grabbed Natasha and pulled her away from the body.
Amora was gone. After Thor had freed the Avengers from her control they had pounced on her. She was able to knock away Bucky and Natasha but when Bruce barreled into her in his hulk form, she couldn’t do anything to defend against that. Bruce had grabbed her feet and flung her to and fro into the ground. Then Clint had hit her with a few arrows and Bucky got a solid kick into her back. When she tried to retaliate, mjolnir hit her squarely in her side and sent her crashing up into the harbor.
Everyone slowly and guiltily filed out of the garden and out of the house. Outside, Steve turned and opened his mouth to say something but Tony closed the door in his face.
I'm sorry! I had every intention of posting this earlier. But I had to work overtime everyday this past week and so Saturday was my catch up on errands day. So unfortunately that meant an other late upload. I didn't even do a final read through so I hope it's ok, but I've run out of free time and just want to nap.
Steve then turned to look at Betty and Phil. Phil looked ready to receive whatever orders Steve would give. However Betty kept glancing at Bruce, who gave her encouraging smiles. And she kept a firm grip on the man’s arm, as if holding him back from leaving.
“Loki” Thor whined. “Put the scrolls down. Much time has passed since we last saw each other and I do not wish to waste it.” Thor whined as he wrapped his arms around the dark haired gods waist.
The Hydra lunged at Bucky but Steve jumped in front of his friend and grabbed the monster by its teeth. He wrestled with it as the monster kept trying to twist its head free and lunge at them.
“We’re sorry. We thought this would be the best way to contact you.” He bowed his head “We did not mean to offend you.”
Tony began rocking down into Steve’s covered erection and the blonde assisted by jutting his hips up to meet him.
“Property Damage? Tony he’s been harrassing people.” Steve explained also in a serious tone. “General Ross and his daughter-”
“I would tie him to no one!” Steve interrupted, taking another step closer towards the god. “Not to you and not to me. Tony deserves to live. Actually live.” Steve bowed his head and took a steadying breath. “I hope he wants to talk to me, and we can work this all out.” Steve glared at Loki. “Because I do love him… But if he wants nothing to do with me then that’s fine.”
“Long story short, they found out I thought they were all sleeping with Thor. So we had this confrontation where I learned that none of them have or are currently sleeping with Thor.” Tony smiled but Loki seemed to be closing himself off. “This was all just a misunderstanding that got blown way out of proportion!”
However, suddenly Thor jolted as he felt a beseechment. The blonde held up a hand to stop his parents from talking. Which got a confused look from his mother and a furious one from his father (probably for daring to tell him what to do).
Tony whirled back to him and stomped over to the blonde, Steve meeting him halfway. The two glared at each other.
Janet was standing in a glass door, in a dressing gown that barely covered her knees, and Steve looked away.
The second thing Steve felt in the 21st century was the feeling of emptiness. Every morning he reached for his armor, as usual, and every morning he was met by silence - like a cut-off phone line, no dial tone, no background noise, nothing. That feeling woke Steve up in the middle of the night, sometimes, but he brushed off the embarrassing panic it caused him.
"Where's Hank?" Janet asked again. She was shaking, she got out of Steve's hands and stopped in the center of the room. Her face was twisted into a grimace that looked both frightened and furious, like she was ready to jump at a first person and tear them apart.
He suddenly seemed taller – in a black suit made of some strange material with a few bright yellow strips instead of his blanked. It didn't look good on him, but that was probably not worth commenting on.
The armor leveled in the air, and they froze again, watching each other, only this time Steve lowered the repulsors.
"As you wish," the ba responded in an even tone. "Let me ask, what are you looking for? If I know, I will be able to locate the files faster."
"Follow Master Tony, sir," Jarvis smiled. "I'll take care of everything. Do you want me to take your outer clothes?"
Tony took a box out of his pocket and put it on a table. Hank took and opened it, still frowning. The ritual looked weird, but Steve didn't know too much about scientists' habits. Maybe, that was how they were supposed to behave.
"I need to know your answer," Tony continued, without waiting for Steve to speak. "Steve, you're right, I can't entrust my armor to somebody I barely know. Just like you can't trust me with your metal heart." He turned to look at Steve. "But we can try."
“I know, he wouldn’t have told you and Ross calmed down over the years,” she said, letting a breath out slowly, “I still remember the look on Tony’s face when he heard the demand. Ross got off easy that day.”
He was dreaming again and the star was here, so close, so near. All he had to do was let it fall onto him, let himself break its fall. He would do anything to stop it from being what he had become once to the ocean.
"Yours or ours?" Stephen raised a judgemental brow and Steve met his challenging stare head-on. He knew that the man didn't approve of the stalemate but now was not the time to worry about that. Once Tony was back, they could figure out whatever they hadn't.
Tony shook his head once and Howard nodded to himself, noting the implications but clapped him in the back.
"I have so many memories of that wonderful man, Steve," she continued and neither of them cared about the hitch in her words. This was their humanity stripped open. This was life clawed out of a grave's grasp. "And so many parts of those memories are yours too."
"You okay?" Steve asked and Tony considered him for a minute. The last time they had stood in the same spot, Steve had been leaving for his Washington meeting and he had come back to Tony's mess with Reed's council idea with his own troubled mind. It had probably ended better than it could have, Kang had spoken about it, about words and timelines where one of them dies or kills the other or destroys the entire world with their unsaid words.
“Who told you you’re funny, Steve?” Tony turned the phone to show him the screen and Steve stilled for a second before burying his face in a hand, “You see, I can guess that you’re exhibiting embarrassment, which I can understand for Natasha’s hair, but why is it happening here? Was this an amorous choice gone wrong? Or right?”
The battle raged around them and Steve chopped away with his broken shield, hearing the first photon blast ranging somewhere behind him before the women were running together. Through the crowd, carving a path for Carol to get through without being stopped, they worked in tandem.
Bruce’s sigh when he walked in fifteen minutes later to see them both playing foot grapple was worth it to watch Tony laugh as he caught Steve’s sheepish expression.
“We’re going to go meet someone I trust and get us some resources,” Steve explained, shooting Tony a dry look, “After that we’re going to come up with an actual plan to survive another day.”
"Don't you always," Steve commented even as he ran faster, knowing that he'd make it, having made the jump a thousand times before.
“What’s that?” Tony sounded closer and Steve looked over his shoulder to see him leaning against the counter, left hand in his pocket.
He let Sam take his cap as a parting gift and watched them leave, briefly wondering how more people they would bond with and band with in this new journey. With a few beats spent thinking about new friends, Steve turned to move on, climbing back onto his bike to see where the road led him.
this man now, this man who guarded his thoughts, his feelings, and himself so fiercely that all you would see was an impenetrable shield. It was an earned privilege and Tony didn't have to flaunt it, didn't have to share with anyone else the way he knew the tics that told stories over Steve Rogers' face.
He had stayed there, under their lost Tower, for longer than anybody waited outside their homes. When he was finally turning to leave, his eyes had caught a flash of a seemingly familiar brunet walking into the Tower and Steve had rushed in without thought. All he had considered was that he was finally seeing someone he hadn't known he could miss so much and his feet had hurried over the marble floors of the building.
Steve knew what the stipulation would be and it was ironic how he could finally read Tony right after having read things wrong for years.
"No but I've got a good eye for this," she replied, making Steve's stomach drop a little, "One of them had a strange beard. Like one of them hippies."
“I don’t, not really,” Potts shrugged, walking over to the nearest console, “It’s a modified version, leaning more into the biological aspects. I had one shot and it seemed right to use it back in the cell.”
"I'll tell you when I get him back," Tony informed as he winced at the pressure on his bruised knee but dragged himself into the captain's chair with the stingers wrapped around his wrist, "Can you move? Wait, don't, one of us will come get you once we get –"
"Right, flying fortress," he glanced down at the orb and winced at the crack that had deepened, the light flickering now, "Libby, do we have scans out on the attack systems?"
"We were extremely decent, thank you. No paparazzi, no sex tapes," Tony replied, eyes running over the last error.
Steve felt his face ease into a softer expression when he watched Tony hug his father from a distance. They had spoken very less of it and not very well when they
There was a hologram in the middle of the room and Steve ignored the bots when they left him, focusing on the visual playing on the screen.
“Tony,” Steve cut through Tony’s spiral and took a breath before holding his gaze firmly, “What are you talking about?”
“How’s the head?” he heard from his right and winced when his neck hurt as he turned to face the source of the voice.
“And you are?” he countered, skipping the glassware and going for the metal tumblers to pour his fifth coffee of the day, “Because it sounds like you’re getting a lot of refusals for the idea.”
“We don’t have to be,” Pepper said and Steve shook his head, “Steve, you stayed in this house just because I said that I didn’t want it to be empty. You put more work into coordinating the funeral than most of us. Are you really telling me that you’re unaffected?”
Steve stared at Tony, frustration warring with some jumbled string of emotions linking head and heart, not gaining an inch as Tony met his stubbornness with a familiar surety of his own. Finally he nodded and Tony’s face relaxed, eyes moving away to seek out the entrance of the place.
"This is based on a 1680 entry," Tony observed, eyes widening when he made the connection, "Jean Picard, the notes from his observation of Polaris."
“I could make a very tacky joke about itches and scratching,” he replied and Steve laughed, pressing a palm to his face that wouldn’t get the grin under control.
An hour later, Hank found him in the same position of stunned quiet and almost called for help when he found the grin on Steve unsettling.
"That was all Thor," Steve shrugged a shoulder, crawling up till he could be closer, running a hand through Tony's tousled hair, "If I made it, it would be burnt bacon and that wouldn't prove that I loved you, would it?"
It was pretty okay when cuddling with the kittens meant cuddling with Tony though, and that made the whole thing a pretty compelling situation.
"Doctor Banner!" The voice sound deafening through a megaphone. "Release your hostage, surrender, and nobody will get hurt."
"And bring them with me. For a living demonstration, so to speak. We could study them, to borrow the technology, or, if they're really unique, we could destroy them and everybody who knows about them, to keep things the way they are," the expression of the Cetagandan's face, for a change not covered by face paint, with only a small pattern on his cheekbone, went sharp.
He went down the stairs, still swaying slightly from side to side, and soon disappeared from view. Judging by how he was leaning on walls, nothing was going to go anywhere in any way today.
"Then I'll repeat it," Vorbarton nonchalantly waved his hand. "But it should be interesting indeed. Their new Consul of cultural affairs is coming..."
Steve Rogers of this world lost his mind and became a murderer, and Bruce Banner, in a blind attempt to recreate Erskin's experiment, became a mindless beast. The Iron Man was sitting across from Steve, he had no reactor, and his arm that was torn apart, was healing in a matter of hours. Perhaps, this world didn't need another Iron Man, but it could do with Steve Rogers.
Steve didn't understand, whom he was talking about – Pepper or the glove, but all the eyes were immediately on him, and he awkwardly stepped aside, trying to hide in the shadows.
They reached the place they were looking for fairly quickly. It was hard to hold Barton and steer the armor at the same time, unfamiliar, Steve only ever carried wounded soldiers for short distances, barely leaving the ground. Now he was holding Barton a hundred feet high and was really scared of losing him – the ghostly feeling of having him slip through his fingers haunted him the whole flight. But nothing happened. He landed on the roof of an unremarkable building and looked at Central park, while Barton was getting used to being on solid ground again.
The painting was of Tony: the armor covering him slowly, flowing over his hands like liquid gold, coming around the reactor glowing in his chest. Tony didn't just look like a part of the machine – he was the machine, the Iron Man, in every sense of the word.
He let his hand down, found the bag dropped under the couch by touch and fumbled for a small cold jar.
Tony was sitting on the floor with his legs crossed and his back leaning on a chair of a sofa. The TV was working, but with the sound off, and Steve watched the TV presenter that read the news seriously and silently almost for a minute.
Tony made a couple of steps away. In the armor, Steve was slightly taller than him, but not by much. Still, looking down at Tony instead of up was unusual.
"No, thanks. Another cup of coffee, please." The waitress – Sharon, according to her badge – nodded. "How do I get there?"
"This lovely commander," Stark adjusted his words, "has been trying to convince me, for almost an hour, that just this night I've killed, or at the least hurt, a hundred of Barrayaran babies, by other people's hands. At the same time, she seems incapable of telling me, why would I do such a thing. Do you, by chance, have any idea?"
He sat up, awkwardly, leaning on his right hand, looked at the trashed ground and whistled. The pieces of armor flew closer and, in a matter of seconds, assembled into a rough image of a person.
"Jarvis cared for me from the moment I was taken from the replicator bank. Its official position in the hierarchy has nothing to do with my attitude towards it. And if those who set it up knew this beforehand, they wouldn't dare."
"Why exiled?" asked Vorromanof, surprised. "You're working. I'm going to drop a five-layered pack of encrypted dispatches for you. You're still an Imperial Courier, aren't you? Get them delivered."
The ground beneath him shook, and a loud rolling roar tore Steve away from the darkness. He started taking in fast stuttering breaths and quickly opened his eyes, getting stunned by the bright light.
There were still two days left of the vacation that Solomon gave Steve. He wanted to sit down and think – assess all pros and cons, figure out once and for all if he really wanted this. But it seemed Tony had different expectations.
"Hm... I suppose I have to concede," Stark spread his hands again. "Although, I hardly can complain, this is all very exciting. We now have even more things to discuss over tea, don't we, Captain?"
Steve punched the wall with such a force that Tony recoiled at the sight of him. Pain shot up his spine, the blood was whistling in his ears. Steve frowned.
Steve blinked and shook his head, not quite sure if he was agreeing or arguing against it. It took all his willpower to stay conscious, so he could hardly answer even if he tried. The thoughts in his head condensed to just two: the armor was protection; to lose the armor was to lose it.
Steve didn't waste time choosing a room and just entered the first one that was open. It was small and cozy, and didn't particularly fit with the rest of the grandiose house, but even then it was bigger than the living room in Reed's apartment.
"Do you hear me?" His voice seemed muffled, as if coming from behind a glass. "Blink once, if you can."
"Don’t worry about it," Stark brushed it off. "I would cut it the same way you wear it (it's comfortable and functional), but I'm afraid, my dear mother would have a fit if I've done something like that. We all have to make sacrifices," he said with a barely there hint of something in his voice while looking Steve in the eyes. Captain Rogers preferred to drop the topic, so the Consul picked up another glass from a tray being carried near them and moved to another group, leaving a few more holographic leaves in his wake and a quite distinguishable smell.
He could call Reed, but the man still hadn’t contacted him. Whatever happened on the space station, there weren't allowed out of quarantine, and Steve could only trust Johnny's letter. He couldn't physically worry about everyone at once.
"You'll get used to it," commented an almost grown-up girl, passing them by with a tray full of cups. The tray was really heavy, pulling her sideways, but she was keeping her balance with a help of... a squirrel's tail?
Steve was speaking cautiously, thinking about his every word, and he still wasn't sure he was doing things the right way. From what Bruce told me, it seemed that Hulk was irrational, mad, angry like a murder machine, but looking at him now, it was hard not to admit that he protected Steve.
Steve saw invalids at war. He saw all kinds of people, who got hurt during action, and they usually fell into two categories: there were those, who bore their wounds with pride, like you wear medals, and then there were those, who shuffled instead of walking, dragging the life they didn't feel they needed anymore behind them. Tony looked like he didn't care. Like the trauma, that put him in the wheelchair, was just an unfortunate mishap.
The first thing Steve saw after leaving the elevator were Tony's bright white shoes. They looked out of place in a dark small corridor, like even a shadow could tarnish them.
Tony turned his whole body towards him. The armor repeated the action, and now two pairs of eyes were looking at Steve: one evaluating him, and one uncaring.
"How are you?" He scratched the back of his head and looked down at Steve. "That wasn't supposed to be your first impression of this world."
He was screaming something, still squeezing his eyes, probably trying to call for Bruce or calm himself down. Hulk was hugging him so hard, that Steve was probably going to bruise. He had to curl around himself as much as he could.
"Exactly. The fate of our Empire depends on it, however pretentious it may sound. It's the foundation of our society. The best genetic constructs and samples will become meaningless, if it's going to be possible to have a child from whomever and then fix all the imperfections after they become obvious. Including someone's genetic elements into the haut genome, our highest reward, by the way, will also stop making any sense. I can't explain everything, but trust me: genetic manipulation of an already formed human can completely destroy Cetaganda. So, it's quite understandable it causes such fear in those who know about it. The last consul learned there's a person serving on Barrayar who already went through the procedure."
“Not to worry.” Coulson said, appearing in the doorway and causing Tony to jump and squawk in surprise. “You two will be going out incognito so as to not be swarmed by fans or harassed by anyone who may wish to do either of you harm.” The man further explained without missing a beat, or batting an eye at Tony’s reaction to his sudden appearance. “Follow me and I will take care of your disguises.”
As the redhead came back down she brought the sword with her and cut clean through the Hryda’s neck, beheading it. The head went limp in Steve’s hands and the crowd began to cheer.
After they both came, Thor hitched Loki up so his blue legs wrapped around his waist. Loki latched onto him but leaned his head back to glare at the blonde.
“It’s the map!” Sam cried then pointed to where their own map was tucked away and back to the one a younger looking Howard was holding.
“It’s fine Steve.” Tony tried to wave the apology off but the blonde grabbed his hand and held it along with the brunettes startled gaze.
Everyone took a moment to take a breath and rejuvenate, as they all privately celebrated just being alive. Tony glanced over to Steve and caught the blonde looking at him as well. Steve gave a small smile and Tony returned it with a small smile of his own. Both felt a flutter in their chests.
“Don’t trust me?” Loki smirked and Thor just glared at him. “Nothing nefarious, I assure you. It’s to settle an argument about my form.” Loki waved his hand in dismissal. “Bring me back the Casket and I will let you know of the status of this Tony Jarvis.”
“Oh great goddess!” Maria moaned from the floor. “I know you,” She broke off to allow a sob to work it’s way out, “You mean this as a gift. But-” She shook her head still not looking back up at Tony. “But this is almost a punishment!”
Tony looked aghast at this suggestion, but Phil only nodded in the affirmative. “Correct. So you’re all headed to Crete to-”
Around them were growls, grunts, and rumbles but nothing indicated they were being followed or even noticed. Then Steve made a sudden stop and everyone was immediately put on edge. Steve had enhanced hearing due to Erskine’s water and thus was the groups first line of detection for anything they should be wary of in the fog covered bog.
The woman released Clint and smirked in victory. A shimmer then went over her body and in place of the plain looking woman was the Grand Witch Amora. She placed one hand on her hip and looked over the expressions of shock on the Avengers faces with a pleased smile.
Tony laughed a bit under his breath then gave Steve his full attention. “I know you don’t listen very well. I mean all evidence points to me having to repeat myself to get a point across but regardless,” he waved his hand in a playful manner and Steve rolled his eyes. “I hope you did listen to what I said about Bruce. He’s not a bad guy, and I hope you don’t hurt him.”
Natasha eventually appeared next to Steve and wrapped the blonde in a hug, encompassing both the blonde and Tony.
2. Also, just to clarify, The Jarvis’s did not live in New Thebes ever. Tony just made up that tale.
“Are you ok Mr…?” He let the sentence trail off into a question as he finally got close to the brunette.
Tony’s eyes darted around the Throne room. “Where’s Rhodey?” He asked genuinely curious. He was sure the centaur would be the first one to greet him.
“Though to your credit I was trying to flirt with you in the beginning.” Tony mocked gesturing to himself.
“I won’t be like him. I won’t sacrifice someone just so I can get my happily ever after!” Tony argued.
5. I do have a background idea for these Avengers background love story drama. I may do a summary dump in separate postings later. I really like Bucky and Sam’s. Which again was nowhere in my head for the 7+ years it took to think and round this whole plot out, so it’s a happy surprise.
Clint plopped down into one chair and Natasha immediately sat on his lap. Thor and Steve leaned against the wall behind Clint and the one available chair left. Sam grabbed the last chair then pulled Bucky down so the man sat on his lap. When the brunette went to argue against this, the dark skinned man pressed a kiss against his cheek and muttered a playful “Shut up” into Bucky’s ear.
“Very well.” Loki agreed holding out his hand. “You will now work for me, and for as long as Anthony’s in the underworld you may guard and protect him.”
“Tony stop.” Steve said firmly, getting said man to look at him. “Everyone has weak moments. Everyone has their own issues. You don’t have to apologize for being human.”
“Yeah! And Odin or someone granted them this magic map so they could go get him from the underworld!”
“I don’t get it.” Steve swivelled to look at him and Tony plowed on. “I don’t know how the sea can remind you of that because you are anything but useless. You do everything to be of use to someone! You fight monsters! You teach people! Even tonight! You went to that unveiling because you knew they wanted a crowd.” Tony raved. Steve made to say something, but Tony took a page out of the blonde’s book and covered Steve’s mouth with his hand.
Tony’s breathing picked up but Sam and Bruce managed to get him to calm down to a normal level. Then suddenly Steve was there, rushing down the steps. Tony gave him an anxious and scared look to which the blonde gave a gentle smile.
Steve had grabbed her hand then, and Peggy had gripped his as hard as she could. “You have to live Steve.” She whispered and Steve only gave a cry at the unfairness of everything.
“No buts.” Steve’s tone brokered no argument. “I’m the one who should apologize. I should have known a crowded unveiling was a stupid idea.”
Steve bolted over to Tony and took up the spot Bruce had vacated once he turned into his hulk form. Bruce and the others were fighting Amora but Steve couldn’t take his eyes off Tony long enough to notice.
He would miss seeing his friends everyday. He would actually miss Hel. He had lived here for most of his life and had only been to the land of the living sparingly. He was honestly nervous about living there for 3 months, let alone the rest of his life. But he’d have Rhodey by his side for the life part. The centaur would help him deal with people.
Sam and Clint’s knees had buckled. When Bucky tried to catch Sam, he ended up falling down with the man. All three men then decided to just lay on the ground.
Finally he stepped back and looked around the ground but still saw nothing. Squinting his eyes in determination Thor walked forward and lifted the statue into the air.
Tony let out a breath of excitement as he looked himself over. Then he let out a questioning sound as he saw an ugly looking scar on his chest. It was in the same spot Amora had blasted him.
“Let’s hold that in, till we get to my private study.” Howard suggested then ushered them towards his private study.
“You said I could protect him in Hel.” Rhodey argued, gearing up to demand he be allowed inside Tony’s chambers.
Tony snarled at her and pulled on his arms which Sam and Bruce had thoroughly restrained. He couldn’t break out of their hold and they were unable to relent in the slightest.
“Then change.” Loki interrupted, waving his hand so a new chiton magicked itself onto Tony’s body. This one was still red (a color Tony was fond of) but it was only pinned on one shoulder instead of both. Tony looked at his partially exposed chest and glared at the god who smirked back at him.
“Blueberry,” Tony smiled. “You know this is not my first time sneaking out.” He folded his arms. “And can you please, finally, talk to Thor? Not fight but talk?”
“Tony listen. I love you, I do. But I am needed.” Tony started shaking his head but Howard gave him a brief shake and continued on “Too much is at stake for me to let my emotions cloud me. I am needed to end this war Tony. I have to live again.”
Another unofficial job she had undertaken was to remind Tony what he was. She would use him as often as she wished but in ways Tony could never seriously complain about since they did fall under his responsibilities that Loki had assigned him.
“HEY!” Tony interrupted putting his hand on Steve’s shoulder and moving him aside. “I didn’t mean to lead you to that Hydra, alright? I didn’t even know it was there! I was trying to get help for the people caught in the rockslide. For Odin’s sake I was trying to get the city guard to help! I didn’t even know Captain and his merry men would be there.”  He thumbed Steve and then pointed at Bucky and Sam, who scoffed and rolled their eyes respectively.
“You wouldn't even hear Steve out!” Thor boomed. “You disregarded him! As you disregard all mortals!”
“Thank you Mr. Stark.” Steve wheezed after they put the lumbar down. He then shook his thin arms out to try and get the tingling feeling out of them.
“A year! It’s been over a YEAR!” Loki raged as he paced in his throne room. Icicles growing larger with each frustrated step he took.
After their date, Steve hadn’t heard from Tony again. The brunette hadn’t come over and when Steve went to his place he received no answer. Eventually Steve left, thinking the man just needed some space. And now, the next day it was late in the afternoon and the blonde still hadn’t heard anything from the brunette.
Tony looked wide eyed at the blonde but Steve didn’t look away from Loki. Loki kept his face impassive until all the Avengers agreed. Sam agreed next, quickly followed by Bucky, Bruce, Clint, and then Natasha (who glared daggers at the god). Then Loki let a cruel smile crawl onto his face.
“They could have covered their tracks! I don’t know! I just know that I failed to protect him! I should have been there! I failed! I failed!”
Steve needed a few seconds to reboot. The gaul of that man, calling HIM a liar! Finally Steve snapped back to himself and puffed up in anger. He then bolted into the temple.
Natasha looked skeptical but Clint only shook her lightly. They then seemed to have a conversation with only their eyes for a minute. Natasha then sighed in defeat and Clint grinned even more.
“You say he’s a True Hero?” Loki didn’t wait for Tony’s confirmation, “I’ll take your word for it. I won’t even wait for Odin to sanctify it. I’ll call him a True Hero and give him exactly what he came to Hel for.”
“I’m still not convinced you actually do know him.” Natasha added under her breath but loud enough so that the trio heard her.
Luckily everyone was still whole and hail. They had some close calls but no one had been grabbed or seriously damaged by Jörmungandr. Though Tony had been right, it was impossible to pin the creature down. He kept shrinking and growing in order to dodge, evaid, and strike.
“I hear whistling.” Steve reported staring into the fog to try and see what the whistling was coming from.
It turned out the king did not approve of Riley and his daughter and thus tried to have Riley killed. So Riley, Sam, and the princess decided the best course of action would be to leave and never come back. Which had worked out. However Riley and his now bride deserved some time to just be a couple. So Sam had parted from his friend promising to write and return eventually. He then traveled around and helped out with small jobs where he could. Then he ran into Thor and was recruited into helping them.
Loki looked exactly like his depictions. He was tall, slim yet fit, had two horns growing from his head of black hair, angry red eyes, and he had blue skin that seemed to radiate cold. Next to him was Thor, god of Thunder and Fertility. He had on a warriors dress, complete with a red cape. He was every bit the grand image of a god. However, his blonde hair was in complete disarray.
“If Loki sent Fenrir then as soon as Fenrir returns he’s going to send Jörmungandr. His other favorite pet.”  Tony explained, keeping his tone and posture all business. “Unlike Fenrir, Jörmungandr doesn’t listen to me. He only listens to Loki.”
“I mean it.” Steve whispered into the decreasing space between their faces, as both of them leaned towards each other. “I would never hurt you.” He whispered again as Tony closed his eyes.
“Fine. You win this round,” Tony relented then tugged on their still joined hands. “It’s this way. Fair warning, it’s kinda far.”
“Loki? Ah, Oh!” Thor had just opened the door to Loki’s study and found the horned god in nothing but his small cloths.
Everyone’s eyes swiveled over to him. He was standing away from the group and further up the road towards Thor’s temple.
“Athens is currently being threatened by Crete. King Minos of Crete is threatening to sick the Minotaur on Athens if they do not meet his demands. He has also threatened other city states with this same thing but none of them reported it, they simply gave in.” Phil rattled off.
“However, if you were to fetch the item we were discussing then I would be able to look for this Tony Jarvis.”
“Because he knew that would rile her up more.” Steve finally spoke. Upon looking up, his friends could see his face was a storm of anger. “He made Tony think I was just …
“Steve? What has happened to you?” Thor asked, looking over his friend who looked as if he had never drank the water of Asgard.
Sam, Bucky, and Steve took in as much as they could, each pointing out various things that had caught their eyes as they all explored the city. Sam had come from a large city, but nothing compared to New Thebes. It was one of the most heavily populated places in Greece. Meanwhile, Steve and Bucky had never been to a city as large as this and couldn’t contain their awe at the sheer size and activity of the place.
Meanwhile Tony, who rarely had relationships, was starting to feel the strain of what being in one really meant. Steve would text and call Tony almost everyday and the brunette were starting to feel suffocated. He needed his space, he needed his time, time to lock himself away from everyone and decompress. In addition, Steve would often be in Tony’s lab with him. Tony loved this! Steve would quietly draw and he would tinker. Sometimes Steve would bring him food and they’d talk, and it was perfect. But, other times, Steve would mother hen him and forcible remove him from his lab –his lab. He knew Steve was trying to look out for him and did it out of love. But Tony needed his freedom, he needed to control his life –to often have people tried to control it for him that he began to resent anyone who tried. Tony didn’t tell anyone and then everything came to a head.
Tony blinked then leaned back and smacked his lips in a show of frustration. “Fine.” His tone was clipped and annoyed.
“Oh no.” Loki whispered as he looked the child over. “Ooooh no. You need to hide!” Loki commanded sternly.
“It’s a monster. Probably trying to lure us over so it can kill us.” Bucky surmised and Steve gave a nod of agreement and they made to turn around.
“Loki took everyone's strengths. Then he sent Fenrir after them. I managed to get him to leave. But now he sent Jörmungandr, and he doesn’t listen to me at all.”
Tony glanced at the blondes extended hand with his eyebrows raised. Steve also glanced at his hand then immediately dropped it and began fumbling with his words again.
“Rhodey-bear is my best friend.” Tony proclaimed proudly and patted the man’s back. Said man threw Tony a smile.
“Why do they always have these private talks when I visit?” Thor questioned, gesturing to the two retreating backs with a bottle of wine.
Loki got off Thor’s lap then magicked some clothes on himself. “I’m going to kill whoever beseeched me! I’ll be right back.”
Tony now appeared in a kneeling position in the seating area of the Arena. He was still chained and unable to speak. Tony’s eyes darted around before glaring at Loki and then giving the Avengers a sad and panicked look.
Meanwhile Steve looked from his friends to the two mercenaries, and then to the bodies around them. The two were obviously skilled and Steve couldn’t tell what weapons the woman carried but he knew she at least had to have a dagger or two on her person. The fact that he couldn’t even see those, however, made him question what other weapons she had concealed.
“Don’t make me ground you.” Rhodey said in a serious tone that was softened by the smile on his face.
Finally the centaur seemed to notice them and notified Tony of their presence. The group then slowly walked closer as the two took another lap so as to slow down.
Tony gulped as Loki looked at him. The gods eyes seemed to pinch when examining Tony before they slid over to his Father.
Tony walked away from the river and the three wanna-be heros. He didn’t wander too far though, just enough that he knew he was out of the trios sight. He then pulled out the rune stone Loki had given him and opened a portal to Hel. Once he stepped through he found himself in Loki’s throne room. As usual, Loki was sitting on his throne and had all his gold jewelry on (the chains around his horns, his multiple necklaces, earrings, etc). However, his stance was very formal, he sat up straight and had a more regal air around him.
"So, what's the plan?" Tony, looking deliberately relaxed, leaned back in his chair. "Every villain has an evil plan."
Steve let go, before he could think, but even before that, he gave the armor his order. He was free-falling for a few stores, counting second till he'd hit the ground, but then metal plates started coming around him. The faceplate covered his face, and Steve saw Tony – he was falling quicker, with his arms spread wide, flying towards the ground. Steve straightened, got his bearings and fired the repulsors.
That wasn't in Steve's plans, so he shrugged and kept looking at everything in cheerful and relaxed fashion. Judging by what he saw, Walter... that is, Howard chose a good cover, he did resemble the locals quite a lot.
A black minibus with toned windows was parked next to the house. For some reason, its smooth sides didn't reflect the sunlight, so it looked like a blemish against the background of the street, like a hole in reality. The doors were open, and there were removable rails placed to lead inside. A tall man in a dark suit stood next to the bus, his face impassive, but the gaze - tenacious, determined. Steve wondered, if he was a bodyguard.
Quite unexpectedly and untimely, Steve got curious, as to who this weird Tony Stark person was. At first, Steve thought he was a businessman, probably because of his bodyguard and his expensive suit. Now, though, he was more inclined to think that Tony was someone that inventors - like Reed and Hank - sold his designs to. He wondered if there was a special word for it.
"I always wanted to fly," she admitted. "I know there's skydiving, but that's falling, not flying, and I just wanted..." Janet looked at the sky. "I don't know. Freedom? To feel the wind? What do you think?"
"You have a funny face," Janet said. Steve got conscious of the fact he was just staring at her and looked away. He didn't know if it was alright to look straight at a girl these days, or if he just broke some rules. "Oh, is that Ben Grimm?"
At the corner of his eye, Steve noticed the ruined lab, dark red spots on the walls, as if someone was smeared all over them with unmitigated fury. For the first time since he ended up in this world, Steve felt sick.
Steve swayed awkwardly on his feet, pushed by the wind, but quickly straightened again. The tip of the arrow aimed at him followed his movement, never leaving its aim at his reactor.
"No, why, keep going," the Cetagandan, too pleased with himself, almost purred. He was intrigued by Rogers' unusual response to a basically innocent remark, and didn't want to lose a chance to listen to stories about the life of a modest Imperial Courier.
Steve looked down. A red-haired woman stood next to the staircase. Happy with a suitcase in his hands hovered behind her.
Steve tensed. People often told him he couldn't lie, although what he said was more of a half-truth, than an outright lie.
"That I wouldn't believe," Janet breathed out. She tilted her head, like an animal studying its surroundings for danger. "And I refuse to answer your questions, until you bring Hank back, alive and well."
"I warned you," said Ben in a low threatening tone, "don't tell Johnny, it won't end well. And here you are, Tony Stark's in your kitchen. And why the hell are you in a wheelchair?"
Tony touched Steve and staggered back, giving a surprised look at his hand. Steve felt it, the touch burned, like it did the first time, like it did every time before. He straightened himself, blinking a couple of times and leaning on the wall before he could focus on walking.
It also didn't say anywhere that he was disabled, but Steve attributed that to a recent trauma. Tony was apparently not all that willing to share information about his life with the press.
