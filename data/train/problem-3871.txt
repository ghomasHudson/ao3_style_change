“You’ll help us?”
First, the sky went from a darkness so complete, only the brightest of the star specs could shine through.  All at once it was aglow with a fresh dawn.  It turned lighter still, the wisps of clouds floating like strands of cotton candy turning shades of pink.  The heavens caught fire, golden light flooded the streets one by one; the fog confined to floating thinly above the water of the bay.  Windows reflected the light blindingly and every piece of metal turned into beacons.
Castiel moved closer looking down at the smear of red on Dean’s finger and palm.  “That’s just blood,” he told him.
Castiel liked the Japanese Tea Garden the best, with the beauty of the architectural accents and traditional flowers, ornamental trees and shrubs, the many koi ponds and quietly burbling creeks, he found it beautiful and peaceful as he strolled along the paths, tendrils of fog criss-crossing them in various places.
Dean pondered this change in perspective as he washed his plate, wondering what had happened that his mind had shifted from dark and dismal to peaceful and calm.  Without reaching any clear-cut conclusions, none at least that he wanted to entertain in the current circumstances, his thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a knock at the door.  His stomach flipped and his heart leapt like excited puppies who thought their master was finally home as he quickly wiped his hands dry on the towel and headed to the door.  In his excited anticipation, he pulled on the door and opened it wide, a smile already plastered on his face.  It only slightly faltered when his eyes landed on the downstairs neighbour: tight skinny jeans, tight black top, bulging cleavage and in her hand…
Dean stood beside him heaving, “This
“You look like a man who enjoys pie.”
Castiel pulled away his hand and Dean felt the loss of it like the shore misses the ebbing wave.  “You should get that,” he said, and Dean finally pulled the phone out of his jeans.
“Well, it certainly isn’t Rowena’s cooking.”
Castiel watched as Jess became agitated, he could tell she was trying to keep her professional composure, but something clearly had her concerned.  “She’s got the look.”
“If you say, “Hello, Dean,” I swear to God, I will throw you off this roof.”  His voice was rough and tight, like his throat was swollen by emotion.
Dean’s smile wavered as Castiel turned back towards him and he looked like he was going to say something, but then the door opened and Dean’s attention was completely occupied by the woman standing in the doorway.  Dean’s eyebrows had jumped up his forehead momentarily, but quickly returned to a less surprised position.  Castiel’s eyebrows remained in a frown as he took in the neighbour’s appearance.  She was in her mid to late twenties, as far as he could tell, long strawberry blonde hair, stormy eyes and full lips and very pretty.  From the way Dean had shifting his posture, he could tell he thought so too.  Castiel turned his attention back to her as Dean introduced himself.
“You should go home, Dean.  Sleep this off.  Or have a coffee and we can talk.  This is not a healthy way for you to deal with—”
“Screw you, Winchester.  I’m a little stressed out, thank you very much.”
“Uh oh.  That’s not good,” said Castiel.
“—I don’t know of a single date he’d ever been on.”
One test run of the couch and he knew that it wasn’t for him.
Dean leaned down, smiling, anticipating the lovely sounds Cas would generate next when he ran his tongue from balls to tip.  “Ah!”
“My name is Castiel,” he growled threateningly as the lights in the kitchen began to flicker and flare.
“Come on, Castiel.  Get a grip on yourself.  If you fritz out this elevator, I’m gonna make your afterlife a living hell.”
Dean’s entire being yearned for him so completely, he felt like he would shake apart just looking into those deep blue pools.  Castiel pulled him in for another kiss, their lips closing against each other, their breath mingling as Castiel sighed softly against his mouth.  The kiss was over too quickly and left Dean reaching for Cas, his eyes still closed, and his neck stretched out.
“Yeah, no.  He’s in a coma.  And his family’s pulling the plug… tomorrow!”
Hands still shaking, Dean pushed the pourer into the cut and suddenly, the man’s puffed chest deflated with a sigh.
Dean let himself fall back against the sofa cushions and closed his eyes.
“Goddamnit!” Dean cried out, startled again.  “Don’t you have something better to do than to give a guy a heart attack?”
The play park across the street from Gabriel’s was small, but it was green in a neighbourhood otherwise choked out by buildings packed tightly together at impossible angles and paved roads like rolling waves.  It had a breathtaking view of the city stretched out below it: leafy trees with a 3-D puzzle beyond their branches.  A cold breeze blew in from the distant bay as the sun played hide-and-seek amongst the cotton clouds above.  Parents called their playing children to add a layer to their backs so they wouldn’t get cold swinging their feet and sliding on their bums.  Castiel stood watching them, neither warm nor cold, and unseen by those he watched.
They drew up to the apartment door and Dean started patting down his pockets for his key.  “Oh, come on, man!  If she came onto you like that, you probably took her up on the offer, you just don’t remember.”
Pondered Castiel to himself as he stared blankly at Dean, his mind a confusion of white noise.  Then Dean snapped his fingers, his whole face lighting up in a moment of epiphany.  “I know who we can go see!”
Dean pulled up to the front doors and cut the engine.  He got out of the car, quickly joined by Castiel who was squinting up at the imposing structure.  “What is this place?”
He was looking worried again.  “Are you nervous?” Dean asked him.
“To you maybe.” He uncapped his beer and took a swallow.  “Explain this to me, please.  Why is it, that you can’t remember a damn thing about who you are, but you know where the spare key is hidden and where you keep the opener?”
“Did my wife hire you?”
“Yeah, he was pleasant enough.  Maybe a little dull.”
“What?”
“Castiel!” he exclaimed when his heart had stopped trying to escape his chest, and he felt his scalp tingle with his smile as he looked upon the man standing in front of him.  “I didn’t think you were coming back.  I thought you were gonna stay at the hospital, with your body.”
“Got it,” Dean said, pulling the thin hospital blanket off him.
“Hey, now--”
Pleasantries were exchanged between the man and Dean while Castiel waited, increasingly impatient.  It seemed to have been worth the trip though when the man looked down at the dry-cleaning ticket.
“You’ll have to excuse the mess; it’s been a rough couple of days and it’s amazing how quickly things get out of hand with two little monsters running around.”
“Listen, Dean,” she said, suddenly serious as she reached under the table to put a comforting hand on his knee, “This life might not be so much with the awesome lately, I’ll give you that, but you can’t just check out.  This is the first time I’ve seen you in months.  You can’t just wallow at home, feeling sorry for yourself.  You’ve got to move on, or else, I’m sorry, but this guy?  This “asshole in a trenchcoat”?  It’s just the beginning.  It’s been two years, Dean.  It’s time.”
“Dean!  This is seriously not cool, man.  Knock it off!” Charlie yelled, punching their shoulder and Castiel felt it like a faint tap, Dean’s skin a buffer but also a conductor for the touch.  He had to get Dean out of that bar.  With a cry that was matched by Dean as they worked against each other, Castiel pulled back to straighten him up and Dean dragged the glass along with him.  A sudden turn and jerk, and the contents of the glass spilled all over Charlie who cried out, grabbing at her wet shirt before slapping them hard.
He took her face in his hands and pried her lips off him.  “Wait,” he said again, trying to catch his breath and his disoriented thoughts.
“What is this place?” asked Castiel in a reverent whisper.
They stumbled down the two steps and Castiel tore himself back out of Dean’s meatsuit, standing straight beside him while he fell to his knees on the sidewalk.  Castiel’s whole body felt like ants were marching all over his skin and he tried to shake it away, even as he realized that he hadn’t been that aware of his body in a very long time.  He stared at his hand and then down at himself as if it would hold some answer, some reason for the sudden change.  But then, Dean was back on his feet and his hand reached towards Castiel making him flinch back reflexively as he aimed to grip his shirt in his fist.  Dean’s hand swept right through him though and he turned and punched at the air instead.
“Damnit, Maggie!  Don’t ruin this for me,”
They could not fail, and that meant Crowley couldn’t talk to Shurley.
Dean glanced at Castiel long enough to see the scowl on his face.  Dean shook his head, “That’s too vague, it’s gotta be something no one else knows.”
“We’re practically the same height, Dean,” he answered, clinging to Dean’s shoulders.
“What am I doing with the knife?!” Dean whispered quickly, sounding strained.  Castiel tried to calm him down by giving him clear instructions.
“How are you feeling Mrs. Clark?”
Castiel rolled his eyes. With a blink he was on the street, intercepting Dean on his way to his car.
Silvered light flooded the apartment that had never really belonged to Dean as he gathered his few possessions and put them into his duffel bag.  He dropped the bag by the door and looked around one last time trying to soak in the last of Castiel’s lingering presence.  He tried not to look for him in the shadows of the room’s corners knowing full well that the spirit had left him for good.
Castiel looked around at the shelves of books and followed Dean as he made a straight line for the more open part of the store which was set up with tables overflowing with precariously stacked metaphysical devices and gimmicks.  Castiel looked around semi-curiously then drew up to the desk behind which the tall man was sitting studying something in his hand.  Castiel narrowed his eyes when he recognized the deck of cards from before.
“What’s wrong?”
Dean felt as though he was being smothered in an elderly aunt’s voluminous bosom: every inch of the place was decorated with furniture, throw pillows, replicas of that statue of a naked guy, thick tapestries, area rugs upon carpets, tables, arm chairs, buffets, paintings and framed pictures – there was nowhere to look that didn’t have a thousand things crowded into a too small space.  And the smell.  It was as though every particle of fabric had been doused in lavender oil.  It clawed at his throat and made him want to open a window or rip off his nose.  He sat on the couch and thought he would disappear in the soft pillows as a puff of scented powder exploded into the air around him, setting off a coughing fit and amplifying his headache.
“Um, yeah thanks,” Dean said, glancing towards him then back to the guy.  “You think I can get those pants?”
Castiel looked down at himself fully dressed in enough layers to survive the coldest of San Francisco days.  “I don’t think I can even remove my shoes.”
Dean jerked the heavy steering wheel to the left and then back to the right, barely making it around the parked car that had suddenly thrown its door open, forcing Dean to swerve into oncoming traffic.  He could have stopped, if he hadn’t been barreling down Turk Boulevard at forty-five miles an hour.  He saw the street name he was looking for, and turned the wheel sharply, cutting off someone on his left as he cut through the intersection, narrowly avoiding the cross traffic.
“You’re the girl Gabriel tongued at his wedding?”
“We did it, Cas.”
“I’m sorry Dean, no.”
“Is everything under control there, Ms. Tran?”  Dean called out to the woman a bare second before the strident sound of the smoke alarm filled the apartment and sent the two running out the door.
“It was pretty new.  I live in his apartment… building.”
“Do you even realize?” Castiel asked him.
Castiel could feel his anger and frustration grow as he looked down at Crowley ignoring his duty.  “Do you realize there are people out there dying?  I’m in a coma.  Have you even noticed?”
“Like hell it is,” Dean answered him. “Listen, chump.  I’ve got Castiel right here, okay?  And for some dumbass reason, I’m the only one who can see and hear him, alright?  But he’s there.”
“What?  You know how hard it is to turn down a silver platter like that?  Besides, that woman is a nine.  Smokin’.”
“I’d like you to stay on as attending physician.  You’re of a great value to the hospital, and the team, and unlike some people, you spend more time actually saving lives than kissing my ass… so there is that.  A risky play!  But I like it.”
“Sorry, drawing a blank on his name.  I haven’t seen him in months.  But, he always kinda struck me as sad.  Lonely.”
Castiel drank it all in, living in the moment and feeling every passing second, and remembering the pure, raw bliss of the night before.  It had been like nothing he had ever experienced with another human being.  It went far beyond desire and gratification; they had connected on a level that he hadn’t even known was possible.  He had heard the expression “touching one’s soul,” but it had always been a figure of speech, exaggerated by romantics and part of the delusion of Hallmark moments – moments that had always failed to feel real to Castiel, who had never felt anything but detachment with his past lovers.  Sex had felt hollow, like it was just another expectation the world rested on the shoulders of a young, handsome, doctor-to-be.  Yet now that he had experienced it, he realized he had been craving that connection for a long time with no real hope that it was out there.
“Claire, Alexis, this isn’t a good time, girls.  He was just about to leave.”
“Let’s get started then,” Sam answered, completely seriously.  He hunched forward over the table and put his fingertips on the tear shaped pointer with the domed window in its centre.
“You could leave,” Castiel informed him flatly.
Gabriel paused a moment more.  “Okie dokie.  Can you just, give me a teeny tiny second here?”
“It’s really- He’s really- It’s all for real isn’t it?  He’s actually here?”  Her eyes scanned the room. Then, she turned to the body on the bed, and Dean could see the very moment that she made up her mind and was all in.  “What are you waiting for?  I can’t let them kill Gabe’s little brother!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel could feel that excitement from Dean, it was almost palpable, like when the air is heavy and charged before a thunderstorm, only he felt so light, almost euphoric.  Dean smiled at him and it was like he was filled with helium.  He suddenly turned, heading for the stairs that led back inside.  “Where are you going?”
He turned to the side and walked through the wall right where the coffee machine still sat and found himself in the supply room.  Odd sounds drew his attention and he turned the corner between two storage shelves to find Lilith lip locked with Nick.  “Oh!” was all Castiel could say as he finally realized why Lilith was always late, or nowhere to be found when he needed her.  He watched them a moment longer, unable to feel even a hint of annoyance with them.  If anything, he wished he could have felt what they were feeling, that rush of endorphins from being with the one you love.
“So?” Charlie asked him, leaning toward him where he was hunched over his coffee.
“Just a little lack of sleep,” he said, turning back to look at Charlie whose eyebrows were lost in her hairline her eyes were so wide.
Dean unbent himself from the chair more slowly and came to stand next to Castiel.
“But it’s NOT what he wants!” Dean burst out angrily.
He hadn’t expected the frown to form on his face though as he glanced around behind him.  He wondered at the reaction as he let his hand drop back to his side.
“And you!  You’re no help!” he turned his frustrations on Castiel, calling out to him from the hallway.  “You could’ve helped me out with your brother a bit at least! But no!  You choose that exact moment to roll over and—”
He tried to open his eyes again, and this time vague outlines of people’s heads swam into view, distorted and out of focus. The voices made his head throb, and he winced.  The scratch in his dry throat was like sandpaper and every attempt to swallow the complete lack of moisture in his mouth made his head want to explode. His throat closed-up on him and for a moment he couldn’t breathe, and he coughed weakly, unable to clear it, his body worn out.
“Dean!  Seriously!  Would you slow down? You’re going to get us killed, psycho!”
Suddenly, Lydia burst into a genuine laugh and Dean looked up at her questioningly.  “You’ve got some all over your chin.  It’s the most… adorably gross thing I’ve ever seen.”
He sat down, noticing for the first time the beautiful whorls of the wood grain of the table showing through the delicate varnish, and Dean suddenly looked around for something to put under his hot plate and cold glass to protect it.  He found a cloth placemat in the drawer of a small buffet in one of the corners of the room.  Settled in properly, he took a deeply satisfying first bite, and then quickly finished off his plate.
As he gave in to the pull of Morpheus, Dean was aware of two things: he was already snoring, and he didn’t think he had ever loved another being more than in that very moment.  Heaven was in the arms of his guardian angel.
Caught between shame and confusion, Castiel settled for defensive. “You don’t really think I slept with that man.”
Charlie frowned, losing her lighthearted smile for a moment, “As in… emotionally unavailable?”
“I’m sorry.”  He glanced to the side to steal a look at the man’s face to better gauge his mood, but his features had gone blank once more.
“Uh… yeah, a little to the right, but yeah.”
“I’m…” The blue eyes frowned a moment before scanning all around him, jumping from object to object like someone looking for something familiar to anchor themselves to.  Dean found himself pitying him, it was getting clear that the man had no idea he wasn’t flesh and blood. “Castiel.  I’m Castiel.”
“Fatherhood is making you soft.”
Dean’s mind jumped to Charlie right away and he could feel the strange panic in his chest, had this guy been spying on him? “How the hell did you know that?”
In a rare moment of coincidental breaks, he found Jody looking into the little mirror hanging on the wall dabbing at the dark circles under her eyes with concealer while Lisa stood in front of the coffee machine waiting for her dose and Meg leaned back against the window sill eating a vending machine sandwich.
“Figures.  Well, I ain’t into free peep shows, so just get the hell out so I can get dressed.”  Dean ground his teeth while he glared at the dark-haired man, who simply met his stare with cool indifference.  “Fine!  You freaky pervert, if this is how you like to get your rocks off, enjoy.”
“I knew I had seen her before!” suddenly exclaimed Castiel moving closer to her.  “That’s Celeste!”
“Oh, yeah, I remember him.”  A shimmer of hope ran through Castiel and he leaned in towards her expectantly.  Maybe, even with the excessive flirting, they had been friends.  “But he was kind of a loner.  Anti-social, you know?  Like a cat-lady,” she suddenly added with a chuckle, “except without the cats.”
“I get it.  Okay? I get it.  If I screw up and this goes south, I’m done.”
Castiel looked around, feeling the realization come upon him suddenly, but knowing it to be true as though it had always been there.  “I’m a doctor!” he exclaimed straightening up suddenly.
“Gabriel?” he tried to say, unsure if anything came out at all.
Gabriel followed him into the doorway out of earshot of the girls.  Castiel followed them.
Castiel poked his head back through the solid wall into the storage room where Dean and Charlie were waiting with the cart loaded with the gear they would need to transfer Castiel’s body to a gurney.  “All clear,” he said, and they opened the door and crept out into the hallway.
Castiel pulled his brother into a hug.  “I’ll be fine.  It’s time to get my life back together.”
“Are you offering?” Dean leaned in towards her, leering at her through half-lidded eyes.
“I’m Lydia.  I was just about to have some dessert.  Would you like some?”
“I’m trying to deal with it, but I can’t get him to leave!” he yelled, flailing his arm towards where Castiel was standing.
“This one’s been photographed for magazines,” she had proudly informed him as he gazed perplexedly at the sandbox in the middle of the empty room.
Dean stepped inside the house and on through to the kitchen at the end of the hardwood hallway, one side of which had stairs leading up to the second floor.
That tone.
“I’m sorry, I don’t want to scare you,” he said as he started moving towards the walkway that would take him back to the apartment.  “Goodbye, Cas,” he added almost like an afterthought.
“Dean.” Castiel waited for him to look away from the shell on the bed and focus on him.  “It doesn’t matter what my body looks like.  I’ve been in a coma for three months.  Persistent comas… people don’t just wake up from them.”
Why was this stranger making him so nervous?
“Who could have guessed that they would set those papers on fire?  How fascinating.”
Dean pulled open the door to Caffe Trieste, and spotted the redhead right away.  She was standing at the counter having a seemingly heated argument with the barista.  Knowing Charlie, they had probably managed to get on the topic of Harry Potter and were either now disagreeing fiercely on some inane detail or agreeing fanatically.  He walked up to her with a “Hey,” that made her turn and wrap her arms around his neck in a show of affection he rarely tolerated from anyone else.  “Okay, okay.”
“Hello, Dean.”
The man avoided his eyes as he approached, looking around at the garden while he pushed up the sleeves of his taupe coloured Henley.  There was something familiar about him, Castiel realized, but like the ring on his table, he couldn’t figure out what. It felt like his soul was reaching for the man as he stepped onto the deck. It terrified him, turning his stomach to knots.
“No, I’m Ed.”  Dean blinked a few times, bringing his attention back to who was talking to him, trying hard to wrap his head around just how much of an idiot he was dealing with.  “Listen, Dave,” he continued, turning Dean away from the group’s activities by putting a hand on his upper arm.  It didn’t stop the one holding the camera from coming in closer, filming them, and Dean kept a suspicious eye on him.  “Have you experienced any cold spots?”
“Did you move something?” he asked his brother when he finally stopped his theatrics.
“You are one lucky son of a gun, that’s what!  The apartment’s yours!  Whole kit-and-caboodle…  including that couch you like.”
Dean moved confidently towards the door, his mind calm like a stream running over polished pebbles.  Castiel moved behind him feeding him information that he absorbed as best he could getting ready for the most important con of his life.  The man in the white lab coat turned when he heard the door open behind him.  He had receding, chestnut coloured hair and a stylish three-day beard.  He looked at Dean with expectant, arched eyebrows.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice was more confused than the contented sigh had been, but before Castiel could react, Dean startled up, jerking himself into a sitting position, looking around wildly.  “Castiel?”
“Mr. Masterson, I don’t know if you’re aware, but when we come to work at the hospital, they ask us to sign certain release forms.  Do you know your brother’s thoughts on artificially maintaining life?”
Sam shook his head and pulled another card.  “Not your ghost, Dean.”  Dean stiffened hearing his name used so familiarly by the stranger.  He looked at the card as Sam put it down on the counter.  It showed two circles linked together, one was faded and barely there and the other was scuffed and broken.  “You have to let this one go.  It’s killing you.”
He confusedly put the bottle back in the refrigerator and instead pulled out the egg carton and red bell pepper that had mysteriously appeared in his food order.  He searched through the cupboards for a cutting board, knife, frying pan, and a spatula and before long he was full on Chef Emeril shaking spices onto his omelet and letting out an excited “Bam” as he transferred the finished product flawlessly onto a plate.  He poured himself a glass of water and brought his feast over to the dining table, humming
“What is that?” Castiel moved closer so he could see.
He turned his head and looked at the mother-son duo.  She was tiny in stature but had a commanding presence.  On the phone she had practically bullied him into giving her his address not accepting no for an answer when he had called about the purification ritual she had advertised in her listing.  The son was taller, but not much.  He didn’t look like much, an older teen, maybe getting ready for college…  definitely AP.  He had that look.  But maybe under that reedy exterior and flop of hair, he was a fierce fighting machine that could take down a moose.  Currently though, he was busy setting his place on fire.
“I’m so sorry, Charlie!” Dean said, his voice falling into the unnatural quiet the stopped conversations had created in the bar.  The sound of the band playing in the other room was the only noise left as everyone watched them warily, agog.
“Thanks for all your help, Sam.”
The black Impala navigated the busy San Francisco streets of Haight-Ashbury with more grace and dexterity than a car that size should have the right to.  The sleek black heavy metal on wheels slipped fearlessly into gaps between cars that were barely gaps before it wedged itself in, trusting the cars around it to accommodate its size.  Dean looked alert, but relaxed as he turned the wheel this way and that and somehow managed to parallel park the beast one street over from Haight.
“Yeah, I know, and I’m just wasting all of it ‘cause I’m a lazy slob.  I heard you last night.”
Castiel didn’t know how to answer.  Although he had recovered nearly all his memories, there was nothing he could think of that would constitute
The morning after the encounter with the stranger in his apartment, Dean had found himself unusually motivated.  He’d gone down to the hardware store and picked up a deadbolt for the front door to keep out any other lunatics who might wander in.  The whole thing had taken an hour of his life, and as he stood pulling on the door handle to test the bolt’s effectiveness, he barely felt a glimmer of accomplishment before whatever energy he’d had was sucked out of him and he sank back onto the couch to resume his binge of daytime TV.  Before he knew it, another day had come and gone and he had headed into the bathroom to try and shower away the achy, cruddy, exhausted feeling that seemed to have taken a firm hold of him in the past two years.  Ever since…
“No.”
Castiel let go of Chuck’s hand and turned to head back to work.  “Castiel.”  When he turned around again, Dr. Shurley continued, “It can wait until tomorrow.  I want you to go home.  Afterall, you’ve been here twenty-six hours.”  Castiel was surprised, how did he know that?  With another knowing smirk and warm crinkled eyes, he added, “I know everything…  They don’t call me “God” for nothing you know.”
“Call us if you need anything,” she told him as she pulled away.
“Come on, man… that’s just.  That’s just perfect.  Was
“Son of a bitch!”  he’d said, rubbing a hand over his face before turning to look at the mirror again.  His face and torso had been the only things reflected in the glass and after steadying his pulse, he’d called Charlie.  “Can we meet up?  I need to see you.”
Castiel looked up from his wallowing, only slightly surprised that they were no longer in the car, unsure what to answer.  Dean had agreed to help him only because he had bullied him into doing it, and for what?  “I’m sorry, Dean.  This isn’t turning out like I had hoped.”
“Excuse me a moment,” Jess said, and she turned to talk to Nick who had just come into the area carrying patient files.
“There’s plenty of evidence to suggest the existence of the afterlife.”
Dean started walking towards the nurse’s station that was off to the left in the center of an anthill chamber-like area where several hallways met.  Castiel’s eyes landed on the face that had been such a comfort and help throughout his residency and who had become one of his closest friends other than—
“Oh!” Castiel exclaimed suddenly, “He kissed his best friend Celeste five minutes before his wedding.  I only know because I walked in on them.”
“Oh, well in that case, I’ve got plenty of bad manners I can showcase.”
Dean looked up and around, “Why are you doing that with the lights?”
Dean looked up at Charlie, startled and confused.  “You think this is a good thing?”
“Are you sure?  Because I have some holy oil too if you want to…”
“I’m going to throw up,” said Castiel looking away from the display of excess hormones.
“Okay, so, sometimes people experiencing extreme stress can have psychic moments, it’s not unheard of,” Charlie was mumbling, looking between Dean and the empty space behind her.
Dean shifted from one foot to the other, keeping his eyes on the photo.  “You look great.  Happy.”  Castiel nodded remembering the night.  “Who’s the dude?” Dean asked tapping the sable-haired man with the fake black mustache who had his arm around his shoulders.
“You’re going to need a blood pressure cuff,” Castiel told him.
Dean pushed back from the mattress, letting his chest hover above Castiel’s as he kissed him long and deep, lazily licking at his lips before pushing past them, dipping quickly into his open mouth and pulling back out again.  He did it a few more times, until Castiel was lifting his head from the mattress trying keep him close.  Dean laid a trail of wet kisses down his jaw, over his chin and down his neck, pausing to give the hollow below his Adam’s apple a lick and a nibble.  Castiel sighed in Dean’s ear.  Dean’s hips thrust forward, digging into Castiel’s pelvis with his hard member.  Castiel’s sigh turned into a groan and Dean did it again, just to hear it.
“His name is Dr. MacLeod.  Tell him you’re a doctor.”
to talk about Jo, and it had set him free; like the vice on his heart and soul had loosened, and the crippling pain of the memory had slipped away.
“Oh, Dean!  This is…  breath taking!  And with a private access?” Donna had followed him.  “I mean, okay, they didn’t really do much with it, but imagine the possibilities.  It’s like having a whole other floor.”
Castiel shook his head and felt comforted by the terrifying expression in Gabriel’s normally playful face as he aimed his anger at the stranger.
Dean turned towards him slightly, but kept his voice down, “What look?  What’s wrong?  We’re about to get some answers.”
Castiel finally blinked away the pain in his eyes and everything came into focus all at once: the bed railing, the portable heart rate monitor clamped to it, Jody, Gabriel and Rowena standing beside the bed and a multitude of others standing further back as he looked around.  His vision blurred again as a spike stabbed his right temple.
Dean once again was oblivious to the minor miracle that occurred in the form of an empty space on the side of the road just large enough for him to skillfully maneuver the Impala into.  As he swung the door closed with a whine and a squeak, he forced himself to stop and breathe.  They were in dire straits, and nothing was more important than to have Castiel’s brother believe him.  And he wouldn’t if he didn’t appear cool and logical.
He shoved open the door.  “Time to roll, Charlie!”
Dean slammed his hands down on the parapet and pushed himself away, straightening up suddenly.  His face was twisted in a snarl so fierce, Castiel knew before he opened his mouth that he would be shouting.  “I don’t want to talk about it!”
“Maybe six minutes.  It’s like I found a unicorn.”
“Of course, God loves me, I haven’t been kissing that insufferable man’s ass all this time for sport.”
“In case you weren’t sure, what this looks like,” said Castiel as Dean opened his eyes again, “is that you have a naked woman in your bedroom and I’m getting in the way.”
Dean moved off towards the side of the house, walking between the brick wall and the encroaching trees.  When he reached the black wrought iron gate, he checked to see if Castiel was following.  He had a scowl on his face like maybe he did think they were out there to rob the place after all.  Dean smiled in anticipation of what would come next.
“Uh, yeah.  Of course.  I wouldn’t miss it,” Dean answered, absently scratching at a stain on the side of the coffee cup.
As though waking from his slumber and noticing the weather, he hunched in on himself, turning up the collar of his wet coat, and walked on.
“Gabriel, no!” cried out Castiel as he stood up from the table and walked over to stand by his brother, “Can’t you feel me?  I’m right here!”
“Maybe later,” answered Dean, his voice back to his more regular tone.  “I was actually curious about the previous tenant in nine.  Do you remember him at all?  About yea tall, rugged, big blue eyes?”  Dean smiled charmingly again.
“Yes, an amazing coincidence,” Crowley said like he couldn’t care less.  “Might I have a quick word?”
Dean was rubbing the back of his neck looking unsure again.  Castiel watched him a moment more with his bright, curious eyes.  Then, he took the few steps that separated them and pressed himself against him, pressing his lips to his as he wrapped his trench coat clad arms around his shoulders and the back of his neck.  Taken by surprised, Dean didn’t immediately respond, rather he fixated on the close-up of Castiel’s black eyelashes resting like soft feathers against his skin.  Which is when he felt the tentative touch of Castiel’s tongue probing at his lips.
Castiel closed his eyes for only a moment, but a moment was all it took.
Sam looked back up quickly and his mind darted back to the soulmates card and the man that had been the green flame as he had come to him for help.  This was not Dean he was seeing outside his window now, but as he lifted his head, like he could feel him watching him, Sam recognized the blue eyes as clearly as if he had seen them before.  He raised his hand in greeting, unable to stop the smile from spreading on his face as he realized that Castiel had made it back into the physical world.
“That is definitely her.”
“I have a nice hot cup of black coffee here,” he said loudly to the empty room, “It would be such a shame if it suddenly spilled all over these custom-made pillows and stained the rich upholstery.” He began to tip the cup towards the sofa, the dark liquid sloshing close to the brim.
“This is absurd,” Castiel said suddenly, drawing Dean’s attention back to him.  He was looking angry, as he glared at Sam beside him.  “Parlour tricks, Dean!  Witches, crystals, wards?  He’s just playing us.  He doesn’t know how to help me any more than the other side show acts you had traipse through here.”  He was upset, and the more upset he got, the more that pendulum swung in wild circles.  The lights started to flicker around them as Castiel’s fists closed tightly.  He swung a hand towards the cards and though Dean expected it to go right through, like his hands always did, a card flew out mid-shuffle like it had be knocked out of Sam’s hands.
Dean laughed and stepped away from the hospital bed to come stand beside him.  “Trust me, you really don’t,” he said with a playful wink.  “But you know what that means right?  If you could feel me touching your body, then you’re still connected to it.”
“Dean, hi!” the ever enthusiastic and bubbly Donna responded.  “I have some great news.  You are going to flip your lid when I tell yah.”
Dean shook off his confused disappointment.  Clearly, he didn’t feel the same way he did, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to give Castiel the best damn life he could in whatever spec of time he had left.  Dean jumped from the couch with a slap to his knees.  “Alright!  Let’s go live a little!  Where do you want to go?  You wanna see the sunrise in Bali?  Plant your toes in the sand?  You wanna go broke in Vegas?  Sky-dive in Hawaii?  Whatever it is, let’s just go!  I’ll take you anywhere you want… that also takes Mastercard.”
“Anger works too,” Castiel said, not taking his eyes off the man as he shook his head and looked back out and he seemed deflated somehow, smaller.
Castiel couldn’t take his eyes off him as he fidgeted and hesitated through his words.  Gone was the smug, hardened mask he usually wore.  He looked everywhere but at Castiel as he went on.
“Cas, no.  What am I supposed to do without you?”
Dean stopped his words as he turned the corner into the living room and spotted Castiel.  The fight, anger, frustration just drained out of him, leaving him cold and helpless in the face of Castiel’s despair.  He was sitting on the couch lining the bow window staring at an open book on the coffee table in front of him.  His arm was resting on the wood, his fingers brushing the edges of the pages, as though getting ready to turn then… only his fingers weren’t brushing the paper, they were going right through it, unable to pinch and manipulate it.
“She’s everybody’s type, that’s the point,” Dean pressed on.
“Naw, not yet.  But I hear he’s really nice.”
The sky was a slate grey as the clouds threatened to unleash the rain they contained on the concerned pedestrians who were hurrying to their destinations before they got soaked.
“I don’t know why I bothered to ask for your help.  This is not getting us anywhere.”
“I don’t know, Dean.”  Castiel looked off towards the table, walking over slowly.
“Get it together Winchester,” he mumbled as he closed the door behind him, kicked off his boots and took off his coat.  He made his way to the fridge, unable to stop his eyes from darting all around him as he moved from one room to the next, alert, aware, on edge.  He made it to the couch with no incident and by the time he was settled in front of the television, beer on its way to his stomach, he had pretty much convinced himself that his mind had made up the whole thing.
“This goes far beyond any medical studies and findings.  All my training has taught me that this… shell is as good as dead.”
“His chest.  You need to check if it’s bloated.”
“This is ridiculous.  You and I both know I can’t touch that.  I can’t touch anything.”
“Why are we here?” Castiel asked, sullen and frustrated.
He raised the glass to his lips and took a sip.  Castiel shook his head.
Gentle sunlight filtered in through the bay windows warming the dark wood accents and polished white oak floors.  It spread quickly into the room like a child greeting a friend.  Enthusiasm turned to doubt as it touched on the dirty dishes and discarded take-out cartons on the table.  It continued tentatively as it pushed further into the room lighting on forgotten socks and a cast-off boot.  It gave up entirely as it neared the couch, passing over the empty whiskey bottle, leaving Dean wrapped in gloom and the glow of the television he had unceremoniously set on the table between the armchairs.
“Can we do that again?” Castiel asked him with all the innocence of a freshly popped cherry.
Dean shifted on the bench and leaned over, his face moving into Castiel’s line of sight as he peered up at him.  Castiel could see something flicker momentarily on his face, was it concern?  Empathy?  But it disappeared as he straightened back up and leaned back on the park bench.  Castiel turned to look at him and he rolled his green eyes, darkened by the shadows around them, but still clear in the lighting of the nearby lamppost.
Dean knew exactly what Castiel was referring to and he smiled.  “With every fiber of my soul.”
“He’d been secretly in love with her for years, but she’s gay.”
Catch a walk in before he went sprawling to the floor, “Clear bed two!” he called out as he pressed gauze to a bleeding gash on the man’s head.
Dean frowned at the business card in his hand.
The door closed on their casual banter and Castiel was left alone with his thoughts. He wandered over to the bow window and sat down on the couch.  He could feel the warmth of the afternoon sunlight as it caressed his skin and he closed his eyes.  He let the tingling feel of the sun’s kiss spread throughout his body making him feel light like he was more than flesh.  It felt like he was made of air itself.  His insides quivered from a strange familiarity and he relaxed into the comfort of the touch.
“I have no clue,” Dean said, getting into the car. Castiel appeared in the passenger seat and Dean turned towards him, like he had known that he would be sitting right there when he turned.  “But you can help me.”
“Dean, this is insane.  You can’t just steal my body.”
His fist went flying before he even knew he was going to do it, but it was too late to hold back, and he turned his body into the punch as it connected with the doctor’s nose.  He distinctly felt something yield and crack.
Dean’s whole body looked energized suddenly, “Are you sticking around tonight?”
The hit seemed to surprise Dean and for a moment he stopped struggling and Castiel made to pull the arm still holding the now empty glass away from the bar.  Dean held on, and he had to shake the glass loose.
Dean glanced up at Castiel, who frowned at him.  “All right. So, my imaginary friend?  Not imaginary.  He’s actually the spirit of this guy who’s in a coma.  But I’m the only one who can see or hear him.”
“It’s a what?” Dean asking him through clenched teeth.
His head was pounding.  He spied the red sofa set beside a fireplace, a wooden steamer trunk-style coffee table that would be a great place to set down a drink.  By the time Donna’s voice drifted back over him, he was settled in the center of the couch and staring blankly at the painting on the wall between the armchairs across from him.
“Nice!  Professional… Top notch, Dean.”
“Listen, Gabriel,” he started, Castiel’s brother crossing his arms and glaring at him, “How I know your brother isn’t important.  But please, you have to believe me when I say that Castiel means a lot to me.  He… he saved me.  I was dead, and he brought me back to life.”
“That’s because, my tricky angel, I’m always right.”
He made his way up the stairs slowly, wary of what he would find when he reached the top of the stairs.  His mind went completely blank as he surveyed the previously barren rooftop that had somehow been transformed into a fairy tale garden of carefully planned architecture and serenity.  Not an inch remained visible of the old metal roof as every bit of it was now covered in wooden walkways and river pebbles.  Quietly cascading tiered fountains were nestled amongst potted shrubs and elevated flower beds.  At the very centre of the roof the wooden paths met at a perfectly octagonal deck with a spiral of white and grey pebbles at its centre.  Adirondack chairs in matching wood sat in the shade of leafy vine-wrapped pergolas like he had accidentally stumbled through a portal that had taken him to a small countryside bistro in Italy.
“According to the lore,” Sam said again, his finger dancing down another page of the book as he leafed through it quickly looking for something.  “Spirits attach themselves to people and objects they care about.  That they have a connection with.”  He looked up at Dean expectantly.
“Uh, nothing.  Welcome home!” he answered, affecting nonchalance.
Dean looked up at him again and yelled, “You’re dead!” hoping that the table would drive the point home.
“Hey!  Watch it!” Dean called out, yanking his arm back.
“Hey,” he said, as he leaned over the raised railing of the bed.
“You know,” Dean started, “I, uh… haven’t really been with anyone since, uh… Jo passed.”
Dog bite.  More sutures.
“Ok… and the matches?”
“What light?” Castiel asked, his deep grit sounding just as exasperated as Dean felt.  “There is no light!”
“I will call the police.”
“Uh… Okay… Harsh,” said the girl looking offended, “And actually, yeah you did.  You called me remember?”
“That’s my brother, Gabriel.  He always made me smile with his pranks and his jokes.”
Castiel frowned and looked around again. “It feels like something is missing.”
“No, just really rare.  Okay, I think I have just the books for you.”
When Castiel’s hand rove up into his hair, gripping him tightly, and a soft moan escaped his lips, it was all Dean could do to not strip him naked and take him on the floor.  Dean tore himself away with difficulty, trying to control his body’s urges.  Castiel pulled him close again, oblivious, pressing his body close, brushing his hip against Dean’s budding erection.
“I heard that,” came her sing-song voice from the kitchen, a grimace appearing on Gabriel’s face.
As the sun rose ever higher, light danced into the room touching windowsills and furniture, a sleeping body and wrinkled bed sheets.  It caressed a scruffy jaw of growing stubble and a splash of freckles on a cheek.  Dark eyelashes fluttered and twitched as he let out a groan and nuzzled his face into the pillow.  Arms curled under his head: shapely muscles and broad shoulders framing unruly light brown hair that stuck out every which way.
“Okay! Okay.  Just tell me what you want me to do.”
“It’s just a bottle opener, not the holy grail.”
Castiel tried to think of more leads they could follow, where else they could look, but other than the inane, automatic information about keys and the contents of his drawers, his mind was a complete blank.  He rubbed at his forehead.  He looked up when he heard the sound of things being shifted around.  Dean was bent over the drawer again.  He suddenly straightened up looking like he’d just found a winning lottery ticket.  “Yes!” he suddenly exclaimed, pulling out what looked like a couple pieces of paper.
Castiel thought.
“Did you mean it?” Castiel asked him, his eyes fixed and unwavering.
He quickly crossed the hall and slipped into the bedroom closing the door behind him.   He leaned up against it, trying to regain his composure.  His mouth was cotton dry, and his slowly pounding headache was coming back, the brief relief that the shower had afforded him, already for nought, and all he wanted was a drink.  He straightened up and turned to go pick out clothes from the dresser but found himself nearly nose-to-nose with the trench coat wearing bane of his existence.
Dean glanced at his face quickly before turning back to look at the woman in the white lab coat who had just looked up from her paperwork, spotting him.  “You want us to go?  Just say the word and we’re out of here.”
“There’s new evidence that full functionality can be restored,” Castiel spoke through Dean again, “We need to run some tests.”
Dean turned his head and pressed his lips against the side of Castiel’s neck, right on the tendon he was currently straining trying to turn to look at him.  Dean nudged his face closer, breathing him in deeply, that strange mix of antiseptic soap from the hospital and his cologne smelling distinctly of thyme and rosemary.  Dean wanted to wrap himself in that scent forever.
“Give the man a prize!” Dean called out loudly, drawing the disapproving stares of nearby patrons.  Castiel looked around, the atmosphere in the place not conducive to having a discussion with an invisible person – it was loud, hot and overly crowded.  People were already glancing at Dean like he had some form of transmittable madness they needed to be wary of.
“What, now?” Dean grumbled as he turned around.
“No!  Wait… sir!”
“Nope.  Had to cut him loose, his wants didn’t match with my needs, so goodbye and good riddance!  I’ll be checking out a few bars, maybe make a few calls, see what kind of trouble I can get into.”  Meg leaned back against the edge of the counter on which the coffee machine sat and gave Castiel a once over, “What do you say, Clarence?  Wanna join me for a drink…  or six?”
“You do realize that this is how I ended up in a coma?”
“Yeah, it’s great,” Dean mumbled, and he pushed Castiel down the hallway away from where staff was coming to help Crowley.  Castiel navigated them through the hospital’s twisting hallways and sharp corners as they tried to make it to an exit that wasn’t blocked by people trying to stop them.  Dean’s boots slipped on the floor as he turned away and down the hall when a security man pushed through the double doors Castiel had told him to go through to escape the wing.
“Bees evolved from the same ancestors as wasps.  Their eating habits differed…”
Charlie took a step back and punched him on the arm playfully, “I’m so happy you called!  Come on, grab a latte and give me the skinny.”
Castiel was standing behind Charlie and off to the side; he looked at him over her head.  Moving had pushed back the growing urgency of the situation and the buzzing anxiety of what would happen if he failed, but Charlie’s halt on the proceedings brought all of that back to the forefront. He could feel his stomach drop out like he was going downhill on a roller coaster as Castiel’s eyes connected with his.
“You can’t tell me that you weren’t at least tempted to bang her.  What are you a monk?”
Then, silence. A hush like the darkness held its breath waiting.
“Yes.  Dean,” he specified, taking her hand in his and giving it a squeeze and a shake.
“GAH!”
Sam started pulling books off the shelf, his enthusiastic patter turning to a buzz in Dean’s ears as he found himself cradling a growing tower in his arms.  He was then shepherded to the desk Sam had been sitting at when he had first come in, and somehow his credit card came into play and before he knew it, he was back on the street with his newly purchased books contemplating how crazy he would look on the MUNI with this monument to paranormal research.  He turned his feet back down the street and his eyes landed on the naked man in sneakers and white socks holding a grocery bag nearly overflowing with fresh fruits and vegetables and Dean figured, resigned, that he’d pretty much look no stranger in comparison.
Then there had been the loft.  “Oh gosh, wouldja look at all this space,” the plump blonde had said, smile too wide.
“The only other option is that you’ve gone insane and that you are, right now, sitting on a park bench talking to yourself.”
“I know, handsome right?”
“Dude, that’s… Why?”
like he belonged there.  He grabbed a nearby utility cart and started piling supplies onto the top shelf like he was going through a medical grocery list.
“Swear to God, Cas,” Dean said gruffly, “if you start talking about bees again…”
Dean reached his hand forward and petted the dashboard affectionately, “Don’t listen to him, Baby.  He didn’t mean it.”
“I don’t understand your interest.  It’s clear she sleeps with all the men she meets.”
“I don’t think your guy is dead.”  He showed Dean the card as he explained. “That means life.  Vibrant energy.  And this one,” he had pulled another card and showed Dean who looked down at the lines and drawings unable to see their meaning himself, “is bonded.  There’s something keeping him here, and it’s strong, whatever it is.”
Castiel broke away from the stare, looking off to the side towards the window.  He frowned and Dean turned to look at what he had seen.  Dean’s stomach churned a little when he remembered what it was that he had put there the night before.
Lydia’s lips pressed against his jaw and suddenly the whole sordid situation hit him like a brick, and he pushed back against her shoulders, forcing her back to arm’s length.
“Ok, alright,” Dean said, gesturing for the holy shower to stop.
“There is no light.  Have you lost your mind?”
“It was the truth.  All of it.  I was dead, Cas.  I couldn’t feel anything, I was drowning in my own uselessness.”
“Mr. Masterson,” he said addressing Gabriel, holding out his hand.  “I’m Dr. MacLeod.”
Rowena came out of the kitchen and swept the room with her eyes.  “Everything’s here, dear.  Just as you left it,” she said in her delicate lilt.
“ALRIGHT ENOUGH!” Dean burst out, hardly able to hear himself over the television’s sound and he turned it off, aiming the remote control right at Castiel’s face.  A buzzing silence filled the room and for a moment it looked to Dean as though the remote had worked on both TV and annoying ghost.  In the absence of sound, Dean’s brain filled with a fuzzy static buzzing and it took all he had in him to stop from trying to swap at the air around him as though the subject of Castiel’s dissertating was in fact swarming around him.
“I heard some of it; it was all very poetic, and I assumed you were just telling him anything to get his attention.”
Clearly, there was a mix up.  Though the man clearly thought he knew him, Castiel didn’t.  “I’m sorry,” he stammered as he tried to articulate his confusion.  “I…”
“Why?  Is everything okay with the place?”
Castiel opened his eyes and was assaulted by the over brightness of the solid white light above him. He closed his eyes; red behind his eyelids. Voices boomed in his ears and that sharp beeping sound, both familiar and alien, was growing more steadily frequent, insistent, impossible to ignore.
Dean found himself pulled towards one of the tiny chairs and foisted into it by the all-powerful will of a six-year-old child in a princess dress.  He continued to be impotent as the blonde girl took the plastic tiara out of her tangled hair and placed it on his head while the younger one placed a cup and saucer in front of him and poured him some imaginary tea.
With a nod and a genuine, child-like smile of pure delight, cupid disappeared leaving Sam to look around the bookshop feeling deeply satisfied.
“I’m not moving!” Dean yelled, aiming his yelling at Castiel.  On the couch, Sam had stopped moving and was just watching, with raised eyebrows, the part of the drama he could follow.  Dean turned his attention back to him and saw the look of surprised disbelief on the guy’s face.  “Whatever, man.  Screw you.”
Feeling the weariness starting to dig into his bones, Castiel pushed the door to the break room open, seeking out yet another cup of coffee, the bitter aftertaste of the last three still lingering in the back of his throat.  Did he have any gum?
“Sam with the Ouija board?  I don’t see how he can help me.  He couldn’t help before.”
Castiel nodded solemnly, his eyes staying locked with Dean’s.  “I trust you,” was all he said, the three words filling Dean with a warmth he hadn’t felt in years.  He brought himself back up to Cas’s face, kissing him with all the passion he had locked away inside and that was now burning slow and low in his belly.  When he felt Castiel’s body roll against him, pushing his swollen member against his pelvis, he pulled away again, kneeling between his open legs.  He hooked his fingers in the waistband of his boxers and lifted them up over his straining erection and then down his legs, discarding them beside the bed.
“This is going to sound really strange but—”
“Whatever she’s paying you, I’ll double it.”
“Castiel, you giraffe, I handled trauma two for you while you were sleeping.”
“That’s unnecessary.  I can just walk through it.”
“Well, okay, but do you really believe it?”
“Is he hot?”
Darkness. Suffocating. Can’t breathe. Weight crushing his chest.
“So, how did you know my brother?”
“Um… I was… I’ve been away.”  Dean’s voice faded along with his surroundings and Castiel was swallowed by darkness and a total absence of sound.  The nothing pressed in against him like cotton earmuffs making his head feel like it would explode.
“I’m sorry if I’m coming on too strong.  I just figured, two consenting adults… we could have a little fun.”
Coffee.
“Why don’t we try telling him the truth?” Dean asked, brainstorming with Castiel, the atmosphere in the car a whole pendulum swing away from what it had been on the way out to the estate.
“No!  I’m okay!  Just need a minute,” he panted, leaning his hand against the wall.
“I am not leaving.”
“This is the guy you were supposed to meet that night!  But you bailed.”
“Last warning,” Castiel growled.
“You saw her at the bar,” Dean mumbled out of the corner of his mouth, driving around a slower driver and slamming the heel of his hand into the horn.
“Castiel!” Dean shouted, the cry tearing through him and he didn’t even fight the two men holding him down as the world collapsed around him.
to do it? … Yes, of course.”  He hung up the phone looking pensive for a moment before going right back to his conversation on his cellphone, clearly not worried about whatever God had asked of him.
He adjusted his shirt collar and stood before Castiel, their eyes nearly level.  He raised his hand and brushed the back of his fingers against Castiel’s jaw, it was like sparks were igniting his whole being, a touch as simple as that one.  “Did you hear what I told your brother?  About you bringing me back to life?”
Was he?  Could this bond, this need for Castiel be summed up so simply?  Could such a small word possibly encompass all of what he felt inside?  Could he really say that he wasn’t in love with Castiel?  No.  He couldn’t, because it would not be true.  He looked back up at Castiel and nodded slowly.
“I’m Dean Winchester.  I just moved in, uh, upstairs.”  He gestured behind him towards where the top floor apartments were.
“Dean!” he cried out desperate and terrified.
“Apiculture has been practiced for millennia.  Evidence of the cultivation of honey can be found in both Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece.”
more your type?”
Rowena moved off towards the door where Gabriel was waiting for her.  Quietly, he said to her, “See?  I told you we shouldn’t have rented it out.  Some junky probably stole something.”
Dean stretched his neck forward and reached for him with his lips and met no soft, fleshy resistance, only that tingle like the shadow of a touch, like the sun kissing his skin on a hot day, or the sting of cold rain in January.  Soon his whole body felt like it was on fire and he yearned to be consumed by it completely.  He sighed and shook as their souls writhed and fused.  The smell of rosemary and lightning wafted over him, intoxicating him and he knew without a doubt that it was Castiel and he breathed him in as their souls became one.
Dean Winchester startled and grabbed at the thin sheet.  As he tore it away from his face his eyes caught the edge of the words written on the flyer and he startled again: Castiel.  Heart pounding, he looked at it more closely only to realize it was an advertisement for Castle Storage.  He balled the flyer up and tossed it aside catching sanctimonious glares thrown at him from passing pedestrians.  Dean leaned forward, his elbows on his knees and tore at his hair.
he wondered.  His hand found a metal railing to hold onto and he tried to sit up.  His muscles screamed in protest and he fell back to the mattress with a groan.
I think this is my favourite chapter so far.
Dean put his hands on Lydia’s shoulders, trying to control the situation and failing.  He turned to look at Castiel.  He was watching Lydia intently and the sadness Dean saw in his face had Dean enthralled in a way that even the naked woman in front of him couldn’t distract him from.  He would do anything to make that sadness go away.
“Oh come on, he’s a distinguished looking gentleman.  You’re not into the hot neighbour, maybe you're gay.  No shame in that.”  Dean leaned back on the car and smiled at Castiel expectantly.
Dean felt like he would drown in Castiel’s eyes if he kept staring at him, the gleam of child-like amazement completely captivating.  This close to him he could see the finer details of the man’s face and he committed them to memory wanting to remember this moment with Castiel in this place forever.  What he said next was so completely improbable, though, that Castiel had to say it twice before Dean could even start to comprehend.
That tone.
A few minutes later, he stepped into the elevator dressed in his navy suit with a white shirt and blue tie under his tan trench coat.  He had combed his hair, or tried to, and although he didn’t have time to shave, he decided that maybe the rugged look suited him.
“Grow up, Dean.”
“You’re mixing media here.  That’s not up to your usual standards, Charlie.”
He gripped Castiel’s arm tightly as his other hand came up to cradle his face, his touch so gentle, so warm, so
“Yeah, but it’s not like it’s a secret.  He’s actually quite proud of those films.”
“What are you suggesting?”
“Why would he believe you?  Would you?  Some person comes up to you and claims he’s been seeing your comatose brother, and you just believe them?”
“I’m Sam, by the way,” the man said holding his hand out towards him.  Dean slipped his hand in his uncertainly.
The doors opened on the third floor and more memories of his time spent there came back.  When he hadn’t been on emergency room duty, this was the ward he had spent the most time on.  It was an extension of the ER without being intensive care.  People who had come in at the emergency level, who weren’t in critical state but also weren’t well enough to be discharged were usually dispatched here while they waited for various surgeries and treatments.
“Alex?” Castiel suddenly said, from Dean’s right.  “Can you see me?”
“—facers,” the four whispered, their hands in front of their faces like some boyband move from the nineties.
He picked up a wooden box stained black with odd symbols painted on it in white.  The inside of the box was lined in dark blue satin and nestled in it was a large deck of cards.  For a second, Dean thought they were going to play poker, but when Sam started shuffling them in his hands, his long fingers having no trouble handling the oversized deck, he saw that they weren’t typical playing cards.  They were as black as their box, and though they looked unmarked by scuffs or shorn corners, they felt old to Dean as they flowed from one of Sam’s hands to the other.
The thick fog rolled into the San Francisco Bay and swept over Golden Gate bridge, wrapping the cautious cars as they made their way from Marin County into San Francisco, or from San Francisco out to Marin County.  Fog horns could be heard all over the bay and into the western neighbourhoods as the sound bounced and drowned in the thick veil of condensed water particles.  As the bank of clouds approached Divisadero St and the morning light flooded the eastern part of the busy city, the fog gave way to the warming rays of sunlight, the sky a revelation in bright blue.
Dean kneeled between Cas’s legs and kneaded his inner thighs gently with his fingers as he looked down on his swollen member – curved up towards his abdomen, the tissues engorged.  Dean felt a responding twitch in his own cock as he considered how it would feel to bury himself inside Castiel.  A quick glance at Cas’ face revealed that he was watching him with his intensely blue eyes, and if Dean had needed any more encouragement, that was it.  Dean knew he wasn’t ready for him to push inside though.  Plenty of other things they could do though.
Castiel turned his confusion back to Dean, “Why did you take it?”
Castiel turned to look at him.  “So, what are we doing here exactly?”
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose as the tall cassocked scarecrow spritzed holy water at the exact spot two feet right of the intended target.
“Okay, how ‘bout this?  Do you remember anything… strange happen to you?”
Dean’s smile lit up his face and Castiel was mesmerized by the difference between his usual sullen, brooding looks and this bright and cheerful expression he now wore.  He was downright charming.
“Sometimes,” Crowley added, “It’s better to ask for God’s forgiveness and not prolong the inevitable.”
“No… I mean, yes… but that happened after… I… This isn’t what it seems, I promise,” Dean fumbled, trying to find a way to explain to Castiel that he had been about to send her home.
“Business up front, party in the back, man!  Only way I roll,” answered Ash’s fading voice as Castiel pushed open the door to room five.
“Okay!  Alright!  Enough with the mushy stuff.  Damn my hopelessly romantic heart. Let’s go!
That self-satisfied grin flashed on Dean’s face and Castiel shook his head, “Really, Dean?”
“No,” Dean teased him, feeling his arms starting to shake from the effort of keeping him up, “You’re shorter.”
Castiel and Dean stood looking at each other.  That yearning Castiel had felt before came on suddenly and he found himself fantasizing about having him take him in his arms and just hold him.  In that moment there was nothing he wanted more in the world than to have a body just so Dean could comfort him.  The feeling was so strong he nearly moved to close the space that separated them, body or no.
“Got it.”
Dean turned away from the argument quickly.  “What?  Why not?”
“Right?  What about you, Meg?  Seeing your guy tonight?”
“I tried to tell them that, but nobody could hear me.” Castiel’s distress was almost palpable as he looked at Dean.  “And I… I wanted to talk to… to you.”
Rowena came up beside him and laid her hand on his arm gently pulling him from his reverie.  She smiled at him, though her eyes were sad, secretive as Castiel was struck with the feeling that his sister-in-law knew something that had to do with him but chose to keep her secrets.
Dean pumped him slow a few times drawing out a few more groans until he whispered: “More.”
Dean smiled apologetically and reached for a paper towel.  “Sorry, I get a little crazy with pie.”
Castiel frowned looking down at his trenchcoat-clad torso sticking out of his hospital bed body.  “It’s not working.”
St-Matthews Hospital stood tall and wide, dominating its corner of Hayes Street and stretching out to the next street over with its adjoining cluster of buildings.  There was a never-ending stream of people coming and going through the main building doors seeking the help of the medical professionals inside.  Castiel took a deep breath to steady nerves he did not have while Dean kept up a near constant manic chatter that Castiel found difficult to keep track of.
Bright lights bore down on Castiel once again as he swerved on the rain slicked road and he heard the sound of crunching metal and breaking glass.  Pain.  His whole body had felt like he was in a vice, being squeezed flat.  And then there was nothing.
Dean came to stand beside him and picked up one of the portraits.  “Little Picassos.  What’s with the nose?”
Dean climbed back onto the bed, crawling up between Cas’ legs and over his chest, forcing him to lie back as he lay down on top of him, pressing him into the mattress.  Dean kissed him slowly, deeply, taking his time to stoke the fire in him.  He rolled his hips against him, their respective boxers the only barrier left between them.  Dean rolled against him again, slowly, feeling the pleasurable pressure and friction along his shaft and knowing, from Castiel’s surprised moan, that he felt it too.
“Look alive, guys – it’s Face Time!  On three… One, two, three, ghoooooost—”
“Maybe for you, Patrick Swayze.”
Castiel stood still in the rounded nook of the roof where the waist high ledge curved, following the line of the bow windows below.  The moon glow flooded the usually dark roof, bathing the bare metal roofing in blue light that transformed even the most mundane little dead plant in a lonely terracotta pot into a piece of Faerie just waiting to be brought back to life.  He turned his hands, observing how the moonbeams seemed to bend around him without touching him.  Even the moon couldn’t see him, he thought forlornly.  He looked out over the edge of the roof at the city and the bay beyond, glistening silver.  How did that song go?  Sitting on the dock of the Bay, watching the tide roll away, sitting on the dock of the Bay, wasting time.
“This is unacceptable,” burst out that gravel grit voice from the foot of the bed.
“What is it?” He wanted nothing more than to go back to his day with Castiel.
“You’re wrong,” Dean’s voice shook slightly.  “This is a huge mistake.”
His mind was still going a mile a minute though, repeating over and over the steps to his plan:
“What will those do,” Castiel grumbled, “read my fortune?”
The blade sank into the man’s chest and Dean looked horrified.  “Okay, good!  That’s enough.  Get the pourer from the vodka bottle.”
“You have to tell her,” Castiel insisted from the back of the van.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” he said with a sigh.  He looked away for a moment, looking up to the ceiling and clasping his hands together between his knees like he was trying to decide how best to tell some poor kid his dog had been hit by a car.  “Look,” he went on, eyes boring into him once more, “It’s obvious what’s going on here.”
Gabriel’s house was one of hundreds of stand-alone houses in Noe Valley packed so closely to its neighbours that there was barely enough space for a regular sized man to walk between them.  The entire block of the street was lined on one side with identical models of narrow, two-floor, flat-roofed Victorians with protruding bay windows to add to the square footage inside.  Across the street was a small park built into an escarpment of the hill the area was known for and which made it impossible to build on.
“Anything else?” Dean prompted.
“I was trying to be nice,” Dean said through clenched teeth.
“Just do the thing, Cas.”
: just a quick walk away from his destination.  Dean could remember a time when the whole messed up transit system had him completely turned around and lost.  Coming from a college town in northeast Kansas, the crush of people, some pretty strange to say the least, the never ending traffic, the constant detours because of this festival or that random event had made him feel completely out of place.  But she had loved it.  You could never be bored in a city with so much character, she used to say.
“And a portable ventilator,” said Castiel.
“I swear, Charlie, I’m not insane.  He’s really real.  We have this connection.  I don’t know how else to explain it.”
“Oh, what?  You’re telling me that you’re ready for the big commit?”
Dean nodded as he looked around at the shop.  “Anyways,” continued the tall bookworm with the stature of a moose, “What brings you to Abandoned Planet today?”
“Um, yeah exactly,” Dean said to Jess, “Could you tell me where I can find him?”
“That’s not what this looks like,” Dean scrambled to salvage what he could of the situation.
“Dr. MacLeod, hi.  I’m Dr. Dean,” he cast about quickly for a likely alias, his mind jumping to one name: “Page.”
“It is!” Crowley answered whoever he was talking to on the phone, “High time to upgrade.  I’m thinking the 740 would do nicely.  Going to the dealer tonight actually.”
Castiel could not explain the overwhelming rush of confusing emotions that had been evoked with the man calling him
Dean stomped out of the living room, grabbing his jacket and jamming his feet into his boots before slamming the apartment door shut behind him.
Dean called out to him and Sam looked up, shaking the stray strands out of his face before smiling widely at Dean and… was he looking right at Castiel?
Dean felt like his whole body had turned to water and then ice.  He looked up at Castiel who was waiting patiently for Dean to be done his call.  This couldn’t be happening.
“Is the plan to get there by ambulance?  Because that’s definitely where this is headed. Aaah!” Charlie threw her arms up to cover her face.
Dean turned his head suddenly, like he was worried someone walking by would see him.  Slowly, he turned back to look at Castiel, his eyes moving up and down his body and scouring his face as though he was trying to decide if he was real or not.  Finally, with a resigned sigh, he said that he preferred option one.
“I have an offer in Phoenix if it doesn’t work out here,” he was saying.
“You can’t possibly understand.  All you care about is watching dumb soap operas and… and drinking yourself into liver failure.”
“Oh my,” slurred speech, unfocused gaze, “Has anyone ever told you that your eyes are as blue as the deepest ocean?”
Castiel looked down at Charlie’s hands behind her back.  “Rock,” he told Dean and Dean repeated it.
“The most common bee in the northern hemisphere is the Halictidae, or sweet bees.  But they’re so small, most people mistake them for wasps or even flies.”
“Yeah, I know he is, he’s standing right there.”  Dean gestured towards the inescapable shape of the beige trench coat.  He pursed his lips and ground his teeth, bracing himself for another failed wannabe to try to screw him over.
Dean felt despair crawling up his throat and he choked it down before it got to his face.  “We can’t give up, Cas.”
The black box beside him gave a shudder and he glanced down at it warily. He looked up quickly at the nearby table covered in pendulums and was only somewhat relieved to see them still and undisturbed.  He looked down at the box again and opened the lid.  The soulmate card with the dancing flames was face up on top of the deck.
“If you could just tell me a little more about you, I could maybe help a bit better, yeah?”  The pink flyer stuck itself to Dean’s leg and he leaned down to sweep it away.  “Maybe if you just tell me the kind of work you do, what your family situation is…”
“I didn’t ask you to come here and ruin my life!”
“Alright!  Same questions, just, you know, flip the gender.”
He turned to Lilith to give her his instructions – an EKG, a CVC, a little less morphine – and he was off again.
“Okay…  Ah huh…  Right.  Okay, then.  Bye bye now,” Donna was saying into her phone as Dean walked into the apartment.  The hallway was paneled halfway up the walls in rich dark oak, natural light was flooding the main room, reducing the shadows to mere artistic accents on the various textures of the place.  But Dean stared numbly at the fridge in the nearby kitchen, wondering if there was any beer.  “Well then,” Donna kept going, putting her phone back in her purse, “It’s obvious why this place hasn’t rented yet.”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said, looking alarmed, “I didn’t know what else to do.  They’re trying to make my brother sign papers to take me off life support.”
“Figures you were a hermit.  Let’s hope someone remembers you.”
“You’re going at this the wrong way.  You’re not asking the right questions,” Sam said, leaning forward to rest his elbows on the desk.  He stared pensively at the empty air above the green blotter for a moment before sitting back again.  “So, get this,” he said, pulling a thick, leather-bound tome from a nearby leaning tower.  “According to the lore, spirits sometimes choose to stay behind due to, quote-unquote, unfinished business—"
“Is everything okay?” she asked him, walking up to him, her body moving gracefully.
“Hush, love.  I told you, don’t worry about it.”
Dean sat back down on the couch.  “So, what do you want to do?” he asked him gently, and when Castiel looked away, Dean raised his hand and curled his fingers under Castiel’s chin, feeling that current, that energy flowing between them all up and down his arm.  Castiel turned his head back to look at him, and still Dean kept his hand on him, it was almost like he could feel him.
Before he could protest, she winked at him and sashayed out of the room.  He shook his head as he turned, coffee in hand, to look at his remaining coworkers.
“Come back around six,” the man suddenly said to Dean, “I’ll have a check ready.”
“Good,” he answered.
The man’s eyes narrowed and he tilted his head to the side as he took a slow step towards him. “Your house?” he said, his voice deep and scratchy like he had gravel in his throat.  “This is my apartment.  I live here.”
“I hear you sometimes,” Lydia went on, coming to stand in front of him, laying her hands on his chest.  “Up here.  All alone.  And I thought, maybe he’s lonely.  I know I am.”  Her hands smoothed over his skin and he trembled, the feel of her unfamiliar and unwanted.
“I don’t believe in fate.”
“Shut up,” Dean whispered dangerously with a curl of his lips.
“Yeah, stains.  Blood mostly.”
“That’s not what I was going to say.”
Dean was fixated on the scene in front of him like he was watching the most realistic 3-D movie ever made.  This was some next level weird.  Castiel huffed, his composure in hand again.  He turned to leave the room mumbling, “The guy can’t hold onto his cards and I’m labeled hostile?”
Dean blinked his eyes open, wincing in the brightness of the overcast day and Castiel turned towards him.  He rolled slightly, a groan escaping his barely parted lips as he jerked his jean-clad hips, pulling at the stiff fabric that was twisted uncomfortably around his legs.  Castiel watched as he opened his eyelids and the green irises became visible.  They quickly locked onto him and Dean’s whole body jack-knifed into a sitting position.  He let out a startled curse and then let his head fall back onto the pillow with another groan.
“I looked at all that crap the first time I came in here,” Dean’s tone was increasingly angry, then he turned towards Castiel, “What unfinished business?”
The brunette rolled her eyes in response and straightened up to throw away the plastic her now eaten sandwich had been wrapped in.  Lisa turned from the coffee machine with a steaming cup in her hand and Castiel moved up to take her place.  “This is the only coffee I’m going out for.  After my shift, I have to go home and bake twenty-four gluten-free, nut-free, dairy-free, sugar free cupcakes for Ben’s classmates tomorrow.”
He wasn’t going to make him ask twice. Dean settled himself comfortably and took him in his mouth again.  He took as much of him as he could, keeping his hand around the base and he started to move up and down, coating him in saliva, making him slick as he increased the speed of his ministrations.  Castiel was reduced to short gasps and moans as Dean worked him with his mouth, the erotic sounds swimming around in Dean’s head as he wrapped his left hand around his own erection and slowly massaged himself.  He moaned around Castiel’s cock and his reaction was instant: he arched against him, thrusting into his mouth out of instinct, making Dean gag slightly as the head hit the back of his palate.
Castiel felt the sadness inside him again and he looked down at his body.  “I don’t know where else I belong.”  He turned to look at Dean again who was just standing at the foot of the bed, one hand on the footrest as he stared at him, at his spirit, where he stood.  When would he be seen like that again, he wondered?
“What are you talking about?” Castiel asked him, his eyes wide in panic and fear.
“Why is it that I can feel him, but not you?” he asked.
“What? No.  First of all, it’s a guy.”
“No, no no no… You don’t understand, she just showed up.  We had pie.  That’s all.”
“You left me back there,” Castiel said, annoyed, suddenly sitting beside Dean on the front bench seat.
“The major behavioural difference between wasps and bees is what they feed their young…”
“Hey, thanks anyways.  You were a great help.”
“Crowley you prick!  What am I doing here, then?” Castiel growled into his face.
“Castiel,” she called after him as he moved back out towards the busy hallway, “There will always be more work.  You have to stop and smell the roses too.”
“Can I help you?” the man asked in a slightly nasal voice that reminded him of a stereotype New York mobster.  Beyond the voice being slightly annoying though, there was nothing about the man that evoked even a spark of feeling or recognition.
“Besides,” Dean went on, turning back to face Sam, leaning his hands on the edge of the desk.  “If we fix his unfinished business, won’t that just make him go poof?  What if I want him to stay?”  Dean cleared his throat and kept going more calmly. “How is it, that I can see him when no one else does?”
“What?” asked Charlie looking up.  She looked away again quickly though. “Oh!  You’re talking to-- nevermind.”  She continued under her breath, “If it wasn’t so completely weird, I’d think it was sweet.”
“Dean… I—”
Castiel was instantly intrigued.  “What were you like?”
“I can if I press down,” he muttered under his breath.
“Alicia call 9-1-1!” called out the black maitre D as she crouched down to examine the fallen waiter.  “I can’t tell if he’s breathing.
That last step was maybe a little vague, and maybe a little ambitious, but he couldn’t dwell on that. He repeated the steps again. And again.
Dean stirred again, turning his head towards the empty side of the bed and shifting and stretching himself lithely on his stomach.  Castiel found himself wishing he were back in his body just so he could-- Dean groaned and with a sigh like a sweet kiss said his name, making Castiel feel light with his happiness.
Dean cautiously walked through all the rooms in the apartment: kitchen, hallway, bathroom, bedroom… when he got back to the open space of the living room and there was still no sign of him, Dean could only conclude that the man had disappeared as suddenly as he had arrived.
“We’re seeing each other,” Dean blurted out, the only thing he could think of.
He sensed Dean as he made his way across the rooftop towards him and he sighed.
He heard his voice calling him, pulling him out of that deep darkness and back into the light.  His hands and body reappeared and slowly his surroundings came back into focus and he realized that he was no longer at the nurse’s station, but was standing in a hospital room, at the foot of a bed.  And in the bed…
Exasperated, Dean rubbed at his ever-present headache.  When he looked up, Charlie was making some serious eye contact with a girl sitting at a nearby table.  Charlie winked and gave her a seductive smile and she blushed, looking down at the table in front of her shyly.
“Maybe he didn’t tell you everything,” Dean added, digging himself deeper.
“Charlie, please.  You have to believe me.  I need to save him.”
Golden sunlight chased away all the shadows in the room as Castiel pushed open the door to his apartment. He looked around expectantly.  He had spent a few days in the hospital as he recovered from his coma, the whole time driving his friends and colleagues nuts with his restlessness, suddenly showing up at patients’ bedsides and making suggestions to their attending nurses and doctors.  They had finally sent him home, declaring him miraculously recovered but forcing him to take time off away from the bustling hospital.
“It’s too late,” Castiel said calmly as he stared down at himself, wide-eyed, scared.  “My breathing tube is gone.”
Dean turned and locked eyes with him, the green looking muddy in the relative darkness of the car.  “Win/win,” he said coolly before turning back to face out the windshield.
Dean let out a startled laugh and pointed at the redhead.  “Charlie is Celeste?”
As he pushed the door and stepped back out into the hallway, Jody’s words had him pensive and forlorn again.  He was reminded of that beautiful peaceful garden from his earlier dream and that twinge of yearning turned into a pang of loneliness.  It disappeared quickly though as the cell phone in his pocket began to ring.
“I was wondering.  What do you know about the previous tenant in my apartment?”
Dean stared at the closed doors, a steady whistling sound in his ears as his mind registered just how completely screwed he was.  He couldn’t just wait for another elevator, and he pushed against the slippery tiles to get Castiel’s body moving again; he would have to try for the next wing again.  As he moved into the open area near the nurses’ station, he realized just how trapped he was.  He stopped the momentum again, spinning the gurney as he turned to look down each of the five hallways branching out from the centre.  Guards and nurses and attendants, visitors and patients blocked their escape and Dean repeated, “No,” with each turn as the panic took hold.  As he came to a full stop, his eyes landed on Crowley, holding a bloodstained tissue to his face. Beside him stood Jody and Gabriel.
“Do you often feel paranoid?” he asked narrowing his eyes like he was analyzing him.
“Dean,” came Castiel’s gruff voice from behind him, “Just because people are visiting the hospital, doesn’t mean they want to end up as critical care patients.”
“Who are you?” the man whispered fiercely through clenched teeth, a darkness clouding his eyes.
“I wasn’t slee…”
Rowena was standing by his shoulder but unlike everyone else, she wasn’t staring at him.  She was looking across the room.  She nodded at someone on his other side and Castiel turned his head at the man wearing a white lab coat as he approached the bed.  Castiel frowned again.
“No, this is him!” Charlie told him, incapable of keeping the surprise out of her voice, though she was speaking softly.
Castiel could almost feel his airways constricting even though logically he knew that he had none to breathe through.  “She’s trying to find someone else to tell you I’m dead.  I am dead.  You were right all along.”
