3 months later
“Papa, today we worked on painting and mixing colors!! Did you know if you mix blue and yellow you get green?” Claire yelled over the ongoing Minecraft narration Aidan was giving. Cas glanced at his daughter in the rearview mirror. Finger paints…that explains the multi-color streaks in her hair.
“Yea let’s do that Papa.” Aiden didn’t wait, he turned around and ran out of the room to claim his favorite spot on the couch.
“Castiel? Did you know you have an appointment this morning?” The nurse behind him called out ready to take him to see the doctor. Castiel let his shoulders slump and followed behind her looking like a criminal being led to the gallows.
Dean sat down next to his fiancé excited about his treat for lunch. “You know, with our wedding being on two weeks away, I’d think you’d want me eating rabbit food like Sam so I don’t outgrow my suit” Dean took what could only be described as an oversized bite, stuffing his cheeks resulting in him looking like a chipmunk while he chews. “I happen to like the way you look, and with how hard you work, you’ve earned the calories.” Castiel not so subtly lets his eyes trail down Deans body. “Besides, I’m sure I can help you figure out a way to burn a few, I mean if you’re truly worried.”
The morning of the big day came just like any other in the hospital, the nurses making their rounds. Daily checking of vitals while he did his exercises. The world outside seemed to know what was to come. The previously forecasted hot and sunny day was cloudy dreary. No birds sang their songs. No butterflies fluttered in the garden. Castiels mood was just as glum when he was alone in his room. He spent his morning writing letters he intended to be left behind for each of the important people in his life.
“Stay with me tonight?” Cas wouldn’t look Dean in the eye.
************************
The wheels started turning. Castiel had 2 days before graduation so he had to work fast. “Gabriel I need your help with something. Do you think that you can make me a few pies by Saturday? I know that’s in two days..” Gabriel put up his had to silence him. “I got you, bro, any particular flavors or do I get creative freedom here? I see the wheels turning in your head you’ve got a plan.” Gabriel took a moment to think of what ingredients he had at home, luckily he was off from work until Monday and Sam was too busy with school and his internship to feel ignored.
*$*$*$*$*
“Okay, first of all, you're always on my side Sam, you’re loyal like that, and second… Dean knows.”
*$*$*$*$*
“Who Sam.” Dean stepped between Sam and the map, directly into his line of sight, forcing him to make eye contact.
Castiel went back to the house she had chosen, admittedly it was his favorite out of the available options, and it was coming available just as the lease on their current home would be ending.
approach is not what you need, what you need is someone that can give you alternative ways to vent the emotions you’ve bottled up for so long.” Castiel didn’t really understand what she meant but he did relax enough to finally take a spot on the couch opposite her.
“There are two things wrong with that statement Dean, one, you didn’t drive here and your precious baby is back at your house, two..” Jessica’s voice instantly became louder at this point.” HOW IN THE HELL CAN YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING INTO WORK RIGHT NOW?!?!?”
“Dean, I’ve loved you for years, but you’ve been so adamant about never having a mate I couldn’t push it. I would rather have you in my life as a friend than risk losing you because I couldn’t control my emotions.” Castiel cupped Deans cheek in his hands.
explain yourself later. Now Gabe and I are late for our date, so you get a reprieve for now.”
His mood was on such an upswing he decided to turn on his stereo, playing some AC/DC of course. Getting lost in the song, he turned it to a deafening level. This was a choice he would regret…..
“Hello?”
Cas walked back to his bedroom to change. Whatever Gabe was wearing was vaguely familiar, he’d smelled it elsewhere but it wasn’t worth his time to figure out where right now. His favorite soup was waiting for him in the kitchen and there was a crumble he’d finish if it killed him. He didn’t mind what he was wearing but he wanted to fully enjoy the soup and he could only enjoy comfort food like that in his comfy clothes.
There was some shuffling on the other side of the door. Gabriel chuckled to himself, he could tell by the sounds that Sam, in fact,
“Okay”
She was such a beautiful girl. The tears welled up in his eyes as he thought about how he wouldn’t be there to see her off to her first day of school, he wouldn’t be there to see her off to her first school dance, maybe talk to her about her latest crush, to see her walk across the stage for her high school graduation.
Don’t snap at Mrs. Levi when she makes him make fresh ribbons for her
“No, I’m just going to watch Babygirl.” Castiel turned her around so she was facing the screen. Aiden shifted his position, so he was pressed into his Papas’ side. Castiel sat with the kids and let the morning replay through his mind over and over. The whole time Aiden was explaining each part of the video game they were playing in vivid detail. It was irrelevant that Cas could see it all for himself, Aiden felt the need to educate his Papa. Castiel was more than willing to be able to silently nod while his mind tried to figure out what to do if his marriage truly was over.
birthday and his freedom to choose. The day of his high school graduation, Gabe was in town to celebrate. Now that Cas was free, and heading off to college on scholarship cause he wasn’t going to depend on his parents to pay for anything.
Stepping in the door with both small children barreling in behind him Castiel called out to them to put away their backpacks and get changed into their afterschool clothes so that they could go play outside since it was a sunny day.
Dean looked over at Castiel giving him a grin. Even at his age, he’d mastered the perfect smirk. The boys continued to pass time this way slowly getting to know each other until the five hours were up. Castiel was about to get up and leave but Dean told him to wait for the all clear, a few minutes later a text came from Sam that all the alphas had returned and Cas could come out safely.
After a few of the performers had gone up and sang their ballads, it was Gabe’s turn, and he did not disappoint. Castiel knew his brother had some singing ability but nothing like this. When Gabe came back to his seat he glanced over at his brother, Castiel gave him an approving nod and continued to play with the plate of nachos Gabe had ordered for the two of them.
"Seriously Dean, that the best you've got? The poor guy practically followed you around like a puppy for months before you finally put him out of his misery and gave him a chance and had your first date." Sam gave the best bitchface he could muster while studying for his quiz next week.
“Its time to get up!! Let's watch Cartoons!! Can we play a video game?!?” Aidan and Claire bombarded their parents with a litany of questions, too many to keep up with let alone answer coherently.
“Oh please Winchester. I’m a free agent. I enjoy playing the field, in fact, if you’ll excuse me, there is a beautiful lady over there that needs to learn how fiery redheads can be.” Charlie tossed back her shot and winked.
Gabriel had a glint in his eye that concerned Sam whom he was currently sitting with.
“I..Cas I wish I could be closer to help you. We both know he means well. Cas… I gotta know, are you going to do what it sounds like you’re thinking about?” Cas knew Sam was trying to talk around the word divorce. He knew it would destroy Dean. Castiel was the man of his dreams, then they had Aidan by surrogate and adopted Claire. The family dream that Dean had always wanted had been delivered on a silver platter.
The ups don’t come without the downs. As sure as Castiel had been making improvements, he’d found himself deep in some valleys. Today Castiel couldn’t seem to motivate himself to get out of bed. That stupid voice seemed to be echoing in his head no matter how he tried to ignore it.
Coming home from work Castiel would have barely beat him home the kids would be playing in the backyard, probably getting filthy.  There would be an exchange of stories. Him with crazy customers, Cas talking about how his newest creation lit up the eyes of the most dreary adult.
Sam slouched and slowly slid to the floor against the wall. He couldn’t stop the tears. He couldn’t take it if Castiel died. He wouldn’t be able to look Dean in the eyes ever again. So angry at Dean for causing this, so angry with himself for not preventing it.
“Guys you know we don’t have time for this, you both need to be at school by…” Castiel glanced down at his phone he’d shoved in his pocket. “Crap 10 minutes ago. Both of you run upstairs and get dressed, your clothes are already sitting out like they normally are, we don’t have time for arguing just go.” Claire and Aidan looked at each other and headed for their rooms.
“So who wants to explain to me exactly what part of 'kidnapping and wrongful imprisonment'
“We need to get out of here.” Castiel took Dean by the hand and let him back to the car. “Follow the GPS to our last stop.”
“Look man, I’ve already found a place and started moving some stuff. I’ll explain it to him when he wakes up. He’ll understand.” Dean deflated, there was no anger behind his statement, more like resigned acceptance.
“It doesn’t matter, the only omega I want could never want me back.” Castiel dropped his head to the bar, muffling his words.
“Play fair Dean, Cassie answered his, no answer yours. Theres a prize if you do.” Gabe winked at him, Dean was still annoyed but went on.
“Yea, its gotta get done, no one said it had to be
Every time he thought about the fact that they were actually together, he could feel those bubbly giggly feelings wash over him as if it were the first time. The only part that seemed to snag his happy omega heart was the fact that he and Cas hadn’t mated. The words of promise were there, and he could smell the adoration and desire in Castiels scent, so what was missing that made Castiel want to wait?
“Yes I’m Mr. Winchester, you called about my son Aiden?” Dean leaned into the doorway and noticed his normally well-mannered son sitting in a ball in the corner of the room.
That night Dean signed the divorce papers.
“I know Missouri, I know. But this way, I can save other people.” Cas thought he would be anxious or even in denial when this day came, but he wasn’t. He was serene. Resolute in what was going to and had to happen. “I can’t put them through this rollercoaster of heartache when I know I can end it. Make sure they get these when I go back for surgery?”
“That sounds amazing babe, burgers would be great, I only have this engine to work on and paperwork to get through so I shouldn’t be late tonight.” Dean was grunting as he spoke clearly tightening something. Then there was a sound and Dean practically dropped the phone. “Oh crap gotta go babe.”
“Jess came by earlier, she is so excited for the party and needed some menu suggestions. She’ll never get my potato salad recipe out of me, but it's amusing to watch her try.” Cas chuckled to himself as he surveyed the desserts laid out in front of him. “Are all of these for me? Surely you don’t expect me to eat it all.” Cas looked over at his husband who was relaxed in the chair with his feet propped up on the end of his bed.
“Cas, will you marry me?” Green eyes stared into blue waiting for an answer.
Aiden adjusted better out of the two. All he did was swap out his understanding of which parent had magically disappeared. He’d been so used to only having one parent in his life that the fact that Papa had disappeared, and daddy was now around didn’t seem to matter too much. At least he didn’t make it obvious that it bothered him.
To the bee documentary DVD that Missouri brought Cas earlier that day.
“Well, Castiel I do believe that in spite of recent events you are on the mend. What do you think about that?” Castiel glanced out the window, the only things he could see were the tops of trees and the distant skyline. “I would say that is a good thing.” Castiel gave the answer he knew they were looking for.
“Look, Gabe is usually pretty cool about keeping our secret if it got out that any of us did…this.” Dean gestured back to the karaoke bar. “Look, man, we’ve all got an image to uphold, ya know?”
“Sharing a room? Oh Cassie, you work fast.”
“I’m not touching that one with a ten-foot pole. She popped open the microwave and pulled out the second bag so she could fill the massive bowl in her arms and strolled out of the kitchen.
Slowly the ominous envelopes appeared in everyone’s mailboxes. The test results they all opened them in their own time, weighing what it could really mean for their lives and the life of Cas. When it's all hypothetical of course many answered they’d willingly go under the knife instantly, but when its right in front of your face, when its real. So many other factors become important.
“Is…is he…” Sam let the question hang heavy in the air.
“Jess I can’t let the business die, Cas would kill me if I didn’t take care of everything while he was sick.” Dean tried his best impression of Sams puppy-dog eyes. “All-right Winchester put on your shoes I’ll take you to your baby so you can go into the auto shop.” Jess rolled her eyes and walked off to grab her purse and sandals.
Dean sat through Castiels practice runs about four times before he sat him down on the couch. Poor alpha was about to give himself an ulcer with all of his stress and worry. The anxious scent put Dean on edge, he had to fix it. The omega within him pushing him to comfort and soothe.
Charlie: 350 and don’t be late.
“Thank you, Gabriel, really I appreciate it.” Sam locked eyes with Gabriel hoping that his few words and honest eyes could convey his gratitude in ways his words just weren’t ready to work.
It was seven months after they arrived on the west coast, Castiel let his husband know that their family would be growing by two.
They stayed up texting each other all night the day before his first run. Cas saw it as a last chance to be his own person, a last chance to say goodbye before being dragged off to be some bastards pup factory.
Sry its a short chapter.
“I don’t know what you think you’re doing here, but I’m not going to let you hurt Dean again.”
“The chef doesn’t reveal his secrets little bro.” Gabriel strolled back in the kitchen with his chest puffed out in pride.
printed on them. “These will allow you guys to skip the lines all day long. Oh and these too. ‘
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel had just gotten resettled from his second walk of the day with Missouri, he may not be able to walk for as long due to his lack in stamina but he still enjoyed his opportunity to get out of the room for more than just repetitive tests.
“You were already so stressed out with the shop, barely sleeping as it is. I didn’t want to be a burden to you. At first, I thought it was something trivial like a bug going around so I kept it to myself. Then instead of getting better, I just kept getting worse, I started having back pains, I was tired all the time, nauseous at some points. Then Sam insisted on me getting checked out even for his own peace of mind. I figured at that point I could tell you about it once I had whatever antibiotic I needed and it would be no big deal, but then Sam ran some tests and…” Cas paused for a minute realizing the whole story was coming out like word vomit and he hadn’t given Dean a second to get a word in at all.
“YAY”
“I’m going home.”
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “Pie Cas really? You really know the way to a man's heart.”
*$*$*$*$*
Seven times, Cas had managed to survive an Omega run seven times and no one could figure out how he did it. The first time had been right after he presented, his family wasn’t the most well-off so this was the best way that they could think of finding a ‘suitable’ mate for him.
Breakfast came out perfectly, apple pie waffles and a heaping side of bacon.
Dean snatched up his duffle from the rack where he slept. It was time to check into headquarters for his next assignment and have a much-needed conversation with his boss.
“Dean shut up.” Castiel stared at his friend mouth gaping.
Dean wiped his hand down his face and sighed, staring down at the numbers they might as well have been written in a foreign language.
I’ve been gone for a while already what’s a few more months right? It’s like he just refuses to see my side, a man needs to work and provide for his family. I’m just doing it the best way I know how.”
Castiels mind started to drift back to those old teenage ways, how he’d considered ending it all so many times before. No one but his sister knows and even she didn’t take him seriously. She took the knowledge and used it to make fun of him.
“You’re not useless Jess, just because you can’t be the one to donate for Cas doesn’t mean you can’t be useful. You always have been a good friend to Cas, he loves your cookies and loves it when you dote on him. He needs that smothering love just as much now if not more.” Sam wrapped his arms around his wife and walked her to their bathroom, and prepared a bubble bath for her to relax.
“Well, I finished my certification I am officially a certified restoration mechanic, a year ahead of my plan.” Castiel got out of his chair and wrapped Dean in his arms.
“Bye mom”
*$*$*$*$*
Dean walked over to the couch in a stupor, not only had he just been kissed by Lisa but here she was sitting on his couch, deciding to be back together with him. If this had been a month ago, well… Dean would be ecstatic, but now… he just needed her to go.
“How….” Cas looked down at the bandages wrapped around his torso, he felt sore on both sides. “What happened? I wasn’t supposed to…” Cain knew exactly what he was trying to say.
On the flip side, the moments of joy also made themselves readily available in his dreams. Dean could easily remember and dream about the mornings he would wake to Cas between his legs. Pulling him from his fantasies, moments where reality was easily better. Those piercing blue eyes looking up at him while sinful lips worked him to completion.
Silence
“Get over yourself, he couldn’t possibly want someone as awkward as you.” Cas mumbled at himself and settled down and spent the night dreaming of his emerald-eyed fantasy.
“This is Dr. Winchester..” Sam was slightly hopeful it was the specialist he put Cas in contact with.
“Dude, there's a camel in the backyard.” Dean was looking through the curtains in his room. Sam took a peak “That’s an alpaca dumbass.”
that they have the best pie. So you ready or should I leave you alone with the Redvines? Sam is going to meet us in there in a couple minutes” Dean nodded his head at the last remnants of what used to be a 2lb bag of licorice candy.
Gabe jogged to catch his brother and yanked him into a room to yell at him in private. “Leaving the woods was against the rules!! If Naomi finds out, hell if anybody finds out, they can make you run again or even just sell you off!!!” Gabriel was pissed at his brother for risking so much over the years. The terrible things that could’ve happened to him if he’d been caught sneaking out of the forest.
“Hey babe, I uh I know I haven’t called you as much as I should have while I've been gone. I uhh, I just want you to know that I love you and I’m sorry for everything. Tell the kids that I love them and give them hugs and kisses for me. If this goes right, then I will be with you soon. If it doesn’t, know that I will always love you and watch over you. I love you bumblebee.”
Castiel felt his heartache as he turned away from the memory. Only to be faced with another.
Castiel hadn’t looked up before now, too stuck in his own little world with his thoughts and his burger with extra bacon. What broke him out of his solitude was the realization that the once rambunctious crowd had all but disappeared and the only sound he’d actually heard was Dean walking in the door.
“That’s what I told him, but he’s in denial and like I said fresh baked cookies.” Cas shrugged, everybody knew that pb&j cookies were his weakness. If you offered those in payment Castiel could never say no.
Cas and Dean were cuddled up on the couch, settled in for their Saturday movie night. “Comfy baby?” Dean pulled his husband even tighter against him. Ever since he came so close to losing the man, he stopped denying his love of cuddling. Anytime Cas wanted to cuddle Dean was right there with a blanket ready for him.
If their initial reactions were anything to go by, then at least he’d done well with the rooms. He even made sure that Deans room and a double think memory foam topper. Sams had a perfect view of the sunrise where he would be able to see the horses out of his window.
“Last week? So then you know what it is?! Is he dying Char? Oh God that’s it, he’s dying and I was too busy with the shop to even notice, what kind of terrible husband am I Charlie? How did I not notice that he needed me??” Deans questions came out like a rapid-fire slowly losing intensity as his voice cracked and gave way to raw emotion and tears.
“Dean I am so proud of you!!!! That’s amazing! Your dream is coming true!”
The Impala pulled out began to barrel towards their destination. The land of chocolate.
Cas: I will discuss it with him
“You’re still roommates with Castiel right?”
Dean drifted back to sleep with the assumption that Cas just happened to use that paper to write on, and had
Understandably, Sam tried to convince him that the situation wasn’t as bad as he thought it was, but the tone in his voice betrayed him.
For the longest Cas had convinced himself that he didn’t have a right to complain about the current position. It was partially his fault and anyone else would be ecstatic to be in his situation. He worked a job that wasn’t too serious or rigid, had two adorable kids and a spouse that wasn’t around long enough to start fights with. Dean always bought anything he asked for. In fact, that was quickly becoming a tradition, every trip home from wherever he was, Castiel received an expensive gift. Something he’d either wanted or commented it would be nice to have.
“There is no going back Castiel, once you go, you cannot return.”
“You told me that Dean didn’t even come to breakfast, and we both know that for him to miss out on made-from-scratch waffles and maple bacon, then that means there is something terribly wrong. That something is me and since I can rectify the situation by removing myself from it, then that is what I plan to do.” Sam could see the sense of resolve in Castiels eyes and he knew that there was really nothing that he could say to change his mind.
“Heavenly? Divine? The best thing you’ve ever tasted? Come on bro don’t hold out on me, you are the pb&j king.”
Cas looked up and only then did he realize that he had curled up into the fetal position on the floor and was rocking back and forth.
Charlie took over. “That’s not playing fair Cas, Dean answered his question. If you don’t answer then you forfeit the prize for the round. Its up to you.” Charlie raised an eyebrow challenging him. She knew she was playing him, he could never keep Dean from something that made him happy.
Sam was definitely more involved in the kids' lives than Dean was at the moment. The way Castiel set up all the paperwork, he was the alternate contact point for everything, not Dean. Dean was listed as their father, but Sam was the next name on the list of primary contacts.
“Lucy I’m home!!!!!!” He knew that voice. Instantly relaxing a little Cas proceeded to put on his pajamas and walk out to greet the man he had married.
“He’d never want anybody like me Red, he’s going places, he’s going to be some corporate CEO one day. You know he needs some perfect, proper, delicate, beautiful omega.” The self-loathing came across as a scent all to itself. Somehow breaking through the strong scent blocker he used daily out of habit.
“I’m perfectly satisfied with my gelato Dean. Although with as much as you seem to be enjoying it I might have to try it later this week.” Castiels tone may have been even, but his eyes never left Deans lips. The perfect pink cupids bow lips were glistening after he slowly licked them. He fantasized about leaning over the table and just kissing Dean. Scooping Dean up in a bridal carry and taking him back to the room and making Dean moan like he is with every bite of pie.
Cas: I believe I might have plans with Gabriel
“I wont take up your time, I was just hoping that I’d get to see you for dinner tonight. I could make burgers…… maybe if I have enough time a pie.” Cas tried to keep his expectations low, no point in getting his hopes up for them just to be shot down.
“Succeeds?” Deans voice waivered unsure he was even allowed to speak.
before you put the cotton balls in your ears?” Castiel couldn’t stop himself from laughing. That song was the bane of every parent's existence but it had some weird control over children that even the most out of control were compelled to drop what they were doing and dance along to the song.
“Alright go get Cas, and I’ll meet you guys at the car once I get our tickets for the tour.” Sam got up to grab his wallet out of the jeans he’d been wearing before.
That night when Dean put both children to bed after baths. He shed a tear. Aiden was ready to let him be Dad again, he was not going to mess this up.
“probably”
“Cassie!!!”
Sam’s advice when it came to divorce and custody was a big deterrent. Seeing as how one child had been adopted the other a surrogate fathered by Dean, if Dean chose to fight him, he could lose one of his children.
Castiel knew that Sam was only arguing out of concern. He was worried and being sworn to secrecy only made this harder. “Okay so this is what we’re going to do, since you have a stack of symptoms that could mean a plethora of things, I’m going to start running tests. First I want to rule out all the big bads and work from there.”
Singing and dancing with no shame what so ever, using moves Castiel assumes are from the music video, is Dean, Benny, Balthazar, Michael, and Raphael.
“You know what Gabriel, worry about how I’m going to apologize for threatening to burn his record collection before you try to plan the rest of my life.” Castiel focused on keeping his scent neutral, no point in disturbing everyone around him with his emotions and ruining their day as well.
“Wait, you said you had an alpha to throw off the trail AND an alpha that you decide you want!! That’s not possible cause Sam was with the crowd watching the whole time how could your boyfriend protect you?!?!” Gabe was practically yelling
Cas rolled his eyes, it was karaoke night, Couldn't get anymore unromantic than spending the night listening to a bunch of drunk Co-eds sing off-key to the top 40s.
*$*$*$*$*
He knew she was right. He hadn’t slept nor had he eaten since breakfast the day before. Numbly he let Jess pull him out of the car and lead him into the house. Dean was physically present but his mind was working in overdrive with two thoughts,
“Dean before we move on to our last stop. We need to talk. Castiel started to fidget, all of a sudden the speech he’d rehearsed over and over seemed to be erased from his memory. While Castiel struggled to find the words he realized Dean was slowly freaking out. “Dean, whatever you’re thinking or worried about I can reassure you that there’s no reason to worry. I mean unless you don’t…” Castiel couldn’t bring himself to say the words out loud.
“No, not yet, I’m not ready for reality just yet.”
*$*$*$*$*
At every run Gabe noticed that Sam would be in the crowd, he hadn’t passed any more notes but he always walked away with a smug grin on his face each time the alphas returned without Castiel over their shoulder.
Using the phone to pass messages they started talking. Yea Cas was Sams friend and they had played together but other than being the little blue-eyed boy from next door.
“Understatement of the year, I just woke up maybe five minutes ago and they were already dressed and eating breakfast. Honestly, if Claire hadn’t insisted on playing with my nose I wouldn’t have woken up until you walked in the door. I don’t know what I’m doing here Sammy, maybe I should’ve just stayed gone.” The feeling of inadequacy wasn’t new to Dean, he just wasn’t used to it when it came to his children. Aiden used to worship him, Claire insisted on his bear hugs. Now there was some sort of wall between them.
“So I’m hungry, who’s ready to order?” Dean snatched up the menu from his place setting.
Sam stood up to leave but couldn’t help sharing his own opinion. “You know Cas, I don’t know where this all will end up but for what its worth, I hope you will give him one last chance. He’s actually trying.”
Every computer on the network immediately went berserk. “DEAN WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO????” Charlie yelled from the front desk running in the office. By the time she got back to the office, everything seemed to be back to normal. Dean wouldn’t have noticed if she hadn’t yelled.
The only thing on Castiels mind was that he missed Dean. AS much as Dean had hurt him and as much as he was angry with him, there was something about the way Dean would wrap him up and hold him -
“Alright, angel lets finish up todays session with a little creativity.  You’ve told me a bit about your past. Why don’t you have a seat here and design a new candy? I have to say I can't wait until your back to creating, I will definitely be a customer.” Pam waved a hand toward the art supplies that had been set up in their own corner.
“I don’t think that about you.” Dean barely spoke above a whisper.
This wasn’t the first time he’d seen Miss Missouri’s office, they had been along for the ride before to drop daddy off and then they usually went to the park so he didn’t know why all of a sudden the adults were acting weird until he was being pulled out of seat along with his sister and being brought inside.
“Yea I'm sorry about all this, let's go out and I’ll explain what I can.” The two of them walked over to Gabes Jeep. Gabe weighed his options and decided not to ask more questions until later. He started off in the direction of the restaurant he knew Sam and his rabbit food tendencies would enjoy.
“who says they have to bite on the neck Moose?” Gabriel loved when he could make his boyfriend blush. Sam was so sweet and still innocent in some ways.
“Hard doesn’t mean impossible. There's a long road ahead of you two, but I’ve got faith that you’ll make it.” The nurse turned and walked out of the room.
“Then you should do it Cas, apply to college and every scholarship you can find. If college is what you want, we can make it happen.” Dean squeezed his boyfriend tight for the rest of their secret time together.
He couldn’t help but be sad at the amount of consideration his roommate had given him, clearly, he knew not to be home. Dean only hoped that he hadn’t hurt his chances of being with the one person he felt he could fully give in to.
Castiel laid in bed and stared at the ceiling as time went by only getting up when his alarm finally went off.
The hotel lounge combo seemed to have popped up out of nowhere and was exceptionally well built and seemingly upscale for this non-major road.
“Dean, how can you eat at a time like this? We need to figure out a way out of here.”  Castiel was practically vibrating with nervous energy. Their friends were about to make a fool of him. There was no way that Dean could ever want someone like him and even if there was a sliver of hope, he’d destroyed that over spring break.
Most of these words were said in grumbles as Castiel shuffled out to the kitchen for a cup or an entire pot of coffee.
Back home Castiel camped out on the couch while Gabriel used the kitchen for his newest dessert experiment.
The kids.
*$*$*$*$*
The conversation that was a long time coming
*$*$*$*$*
“Always” Cas attempted a smile but his body was weak. Looking into his husbands' eyes he could see so much pain, desperation, and love.
Finally getting over the initial shock of the news, Dean took a second to let everything process. This is what Sammy had been trying to tell him that day at Sunday dinner, there was something wrong with his husband and he couldn’t stop to notice.
By the time Castiel had calmed down it was almost an hour after he’d been taken back to his room. Most of his rage focused on his pillows at this point. The notebook that held the heroic story of redemption that he’d been writing now littered the floor in scraps.
“Cas?” Dean walked and sat in the chair next to the bed.
Dean was surprised he hadn’t even needed to say anything to the receptionist before he was being sent into an office he’d only ever been in once to sign his initial contract years ago.
so you remember how badass people are.” Charlie didn’t leave much room for argument. She hated to see Dean filled with so much doubt and fear, it had to be fixed immediately.
After dinner while Charlie was debating with Jess and Cas about what the movie of the week should be, Sam cornered Dean in the kitchen. “Dude, what’s going on with you and Cas?” The raised eyebrows a clear sign of true concern. “What are you talking about we’re fine Sammy.” Dean shrugged and turned his back while grabbing yet another beer out of the fridge.
“Yea, I mean how happy do you expect him to be raising two kids by himself for months at a time? His oldest denies his papa exists and Claire is insisting that you’ve just moved to Disneyworld to be a princess and you can’t come home. Kids can’t mentally handle things like this and you know they shouldn’t have to. Just come home Dean” Sam was practically pleading with his brother. This kind of stress could scar those kids for life, and he knew Dean would never forgive himself for being the cause.
So used to being left alone for the majority of the day the ringing of his cell phone startled him, but he knew that ringtone.
“Let’s play a game of ‘I Spy’ while we wait, Claire birds do not count.” If she pointed out one more bird he was going to snap.
Dean just can't seem to do right.
“Sir?”
“Look Cas can handle me being gone, he’s done it before, and Claire was barely a month old. This is probably a cakewalk to him.”
“Well Ellen, that’s who we have registered for the last room, his husband a…..Dean Winchester called and arranged it even sent up some of Castiels personal things and clothes to help him be comfortable.“ Ellen stayed silent.
“There’s a chocolate fountain?!!?”
was the Dean that he wanted to raise a family with,
“I think its you that should be telling me how I am doing Sam.” Cas responded dryly, hoping a bit of humor could bring some levity to such a tense situation. Sams’ lips twitched into a slight smile for a moment. He appreciated the attempt but still had to maintain some professionalism. “I still don’t like that Dean has no clue that you’re here. What does he think has been going with you for these past couple weeks?”
“El? Did you say Castiel?”
Dean moved from the kitchen to the bedroom, hoping that the space between them would keep him from waking Cas up when he started yelling at Sam.
“I guess, no I know I wasn’t ready to face them. Dean would ask questions and demand answers. Sam would just look at me with pity, probably coddle me and constantly watch me. I don’t even know what they’ve told the kids about where I am but, I don’t want them to know how weak I am. How weak I was.”
Sam was sure that after a few dates Gabriel would get tired of someone so much younger and move on. But Gabriel is sticking around, and Sam is somewhat surprised to find that he doesn’t mind at all. Something about the way Gabriel notices and does the little things makes his alpha rumble with joy. He never saw himself as a traditional mate but just the idea of coming home from work to find Gabriel mixing new sugary confections in the kitchen just does something to him.
A few minutes later both kids came down the stairs, mostly dressed. Claire was still having issues with which shoe went on each foot.
“Look, Papa!! I’m a snowman!!!” Claire held out her hands and Castiel realized only then that Claire was not wearing her clothes, they were piled on the bed. Adding that to the plus column, he thanked his lucky stars that this house had nothing but hardwood floors. Castiel picked up Claire and headed for the bathroom. He didn’t want to take time for baths tonight, but now he had no choice.
“So I think by now we’ve all accepted that medicine alone is not going to be enough to turn around your situation.” Cain believed it was in the best interest of everyone if he was very frank and honest about what could be on the horizon for Castiel.
“Yes, you could make your room into anything you’d want it to be.” Castiel waited patiently, Aiden was working through it in his mind, and he could take as much time as he needed there would be no rush.
“Well, Dean I see not much has changed, when you do something you go big whether its good or bad. I will tell you this, what’s happened is not unfixable. Do you want to try to fix it?” Missouri started packing up her spices back in the bag she brought with her and put a lid on the pot.
He had done this. He had made his husband feel as if he was running from him? Is that how he really saw it? Dean sat and thought back on the 10 years that they’ve been married, he’s been gone for……Damn near half……Shit
Dean was in stunned silence, was that it? Okay? There had to be more to this.
Pick the kids up from school
them.” Cas winked and walked off like he’d just given Gabe the secret to life.
Castiels book of candy designs continued to grow as he continued in his unique therapy sessions. He branched out from essential and easily recognized animals to flowers. Pam believed this is where his true forté lay. The rare flowers he used to express his daily emotions spanned from the most basic to the rarest on the planet. Castiel knew the meaning behind most flowers and the meaning behind those that he didn’t know ere easily explained using the book Pam provided for him. She used his journal and his drawings as a way to access his innermost thoughts. Quite tricky on her part as most times Castiel would choose flowers that fit his mental state at the time to design his latest sugar creation around.
Cas' eyes begin to water and sparkle in the dim lights of the roadhouse. This was the surprise Dean had for him and he was loving every single moment.
“Oh okay, then I guess I’ll just hang out with Jess, help her figure out what color she’s painting the nursery, maybe convince her to give it a classic car theme. If I want to be the favorite uncle I gotta get a head start.”
“Oh, and these were supposed to be a surprise for the day.” Sam tossed the bracelets at Dean, “it’ll be a waste if we don’t use them so let's finish the trip, give him some time to really think things through, and it’ll give you time to fix it.”
Next thing he knew his alarm was going off, where those hours had gone, he couldn’t tell you. Claire was being unusually affectionate this morning. It was Friday so maybe she was happy that it wouldn’t be a school night meaning they get to stay up 2 extra hours tonight…but that was more typically Aidans thing, he hated having to stop in the middle of his Lego construction projects.
Cain looked at his patient while continuing the conversation about the options they had left before a transplant was their only option. Dean listened as intently as his emotions would let him, but even then all he could hear was transplant and death. He knew that Cain had already submitted Cas for the transplant list, they just weren’t going to tell Cas and cause him to stress.
“Guess what guys?! We’re going to camp out again!!” Castiel yelled towards the bedrooms in the house. Thank goodness this was a ranch-style home….no stairs.
Claire being as young and hopeful as she was, lead to hope. Claire tried to believe that everything was temporary. Almost every other day she would ask about her papa. Daddy couldn’t or wouldn’t give her any definitive answers. Claire luckily was too young to really understand what was going on. She was glad that daddy was home, but she missed her papa. Uncle Sa was around a lot more now too.
“Ellen called and told me that Castiels new therapist would like to schedule a time to speak with you, but they called her since you aren’t answering your phone. Dean if you love him and you want this to work, you’re going to have to fight for it. I’ve got to go but I told them I would have you call tomorrow, take the day and think about what you really want.” Sam got in his car and drove off, leaving Dean with so much to think about.
The day Castiel planned was a series of stops along the way to their final destination, a small bed and breakfast just outside of town. With every stop Deans nerves slowly began to creep up. His scent was a mix of nervous, excitement and arousal. A combination that was doing many things to Castiel.
Castiel started to growl, and red seeped into his eyes, Dean was triggering his instinct to chase.
. Sam said it as if it was just so simple. “Alright, Sammy lets try this your hippy way.” Dean closed his eyes and tried to envision his perfect day.
The song mentioned is Hold Back The River by James Bay
“Dude stop rambling, I already know what you’re about to ask me and just so you can rest, which I’m sure Cas has already insisted you do, its already in the works.
take a shower. Although you do that at work most of the time.” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose at the statement, clearly, Sam was not letting this go.
Well, that was the vote of the youngest, she was ambivalent. Then again she was the socialite, Claire had never met a stranger. His true concern was Aiden.
“Alright, so they only had two rooms left, one single and one with two doubles. So looks like you two get to be roomies.” Sam grabbed up his bag and dropped the other key in Deans hands.
“Castiel, I know you think this is what you have to do but …” She sighed and sat down next to him. Missouri grabbed on to his hands and squeezed, a rare moment that not even she had the words. At this point he didn’t waste time trying to figure out how she knew things anymore, he just accepted it.
“I forgot bro its been a while since you went back for a visit. Mom and dad are no longer uptight, stick in the mud people who raised us.” Gabriel finally looked up.
“I’m gonna stop by tonight and drop off your meds since I assume you’re getting on the plane with Cas tomorrow?” Sam had the prescription in hand and was finishing up his patient file notes for the night.
Dean was unusually gentlemen like as he ushered Castiel to the swing on their back porch with one hand in the small of his back.
Dean stared at Castiel in shock, his mouth hanging open. “Castiel what are you trying to say?” His scent hopeful but guarded.
“OH MY GOD IT’S A BOY!!!!!” Charlie had already ripped into her cupcake unable to stand the build up. Everyone shared their congratulations with Jess and Sam while they enjoyed their own gender surprise cupcakes.
“After leaving the cafeteria Castiel stopped me in the hall and told me to get my jacket and backpack and meet him out front. He’d said he was having a personal skip day and I was coming with him.” Dean answered the question but didn’t finish his thought.  It wasn’t until about halfway home that Castiel admitted to knowing Dean was presenting and had decided to escort him home without embarrassing Dean on the first day of school.
Castiel paused in the sand.
“Mind if I join you?” Dean looked up to see an older man with shoulder-length salt and pepper hair and steely blue eyes.
Cas don’t you dare think that there is anything past or present that I would put in front of you.” Dean ripped the letter to pieces letting it fall to the floor.
There was a special order he had to create today. A bouquet of flowers made of ribbon candy. The only specific details were the requested colors, so he could play with the flavoring all he wanted, as long as it wasn’t mint. People didn’t seem to enjoy mixing fruit flavors and mint
“Ok so here’s the deal, you erase the video and me and ……you’re invited to my end of the year party. Deal?” Dean was trying hard not to sound desperate, but all he could think of is how bad it would be should that video somehow make it back to his father.
The intro to Cas’ favorite song starts up which made Dean chuckle to himself and sing from his heart.
Sam never had these problems in his relationship, he and Jess fit together like two puzzle pieces. They never had the awkward glances that Castiel and Dean shared, no months of questioning if the feelings were mutual.
Castiel followed behind his husband. This was the life he'd dreamed of so many years ago.
The only thing Castiel had to look forward to these days were the walks he would take with Missouri, she was the only one who didn’t treat him like a dying man. She talked to him like he was any other person.
“I thought…. I don’t know what I thought. I was inconsiderate of your and the kids' schedules.”
to do with why Sam had been on his case lately. If there was something up, Cas would tell him. His subconscious, however, had a different stance. His dreams were filled with scenarios and situations that had him making a heroic run through a hospital while Cas lay dying in desperate need of a rare item Dean had gone across the world to find. The next dream had Dean watching Cas slowly fade like an old picture and no one else seemed to remember him but Dean. Easy to say Dean woke up less than rested, he rolled over hoping for some cuddle time as he had already told Charlie he was coming in late today.
Castiel spent days just going through the motions.
Dean and Castiel walked in holding hands with eyes only for each other.
Sam and Jess walked down the hall with some exciting news!! They were going to share the news with everyone but Sam just had to tell someone, since Cas wouldn’t be able to come to the party, they agreed that he would get to be the first to know.
“Sam, how is Dean? We both know how he can get when things get……complicated.” Cas had to choose his words wisely, even though Dean wasn’t there he knew he still wouldn’t want the conversation to seem like anything emotional or in his words ‘chick-flick’. Sam chuckled a bit, yea that was his brother alright. “I talked to Jess a little while ago, Dean actually went to the shop, she thinks he’s in denial, but I know he just needs to feel useful right now.”
“Friday, I’ll pick you up at 6” Castiel could’ve sworn he’d seen a little bit of red flash across Deans face before he suddenly turned heading back to the entrance of the karaoke bar.
“They make beef jerky in different flavors than beef?” Castiel tilted his head in confusion trying to understand what the combination might possibly taste like.
Once Castiel put the children to bed, he began the herculean task of unpacking boxes and getting their new house organized. Losing sleep didn’t much matter as he would only be lying awake in his bed anyway. Insomnia had become a close friend and didn’t seem to be going away any time soon.
“Cas you’ve got acceptance letters from all the schools, but you got a scholarship to only two, University of Cali and Purdue.” Dean was so proud of Cas, he’d been accepted everywhere he applied. “So the question is do you like warm weather year round or do you want to experience the snow?” Dean nuzzled into his boyfriend's neck enjoying his scent of pure happiness. “Hmm, I don’t like the cold that much University of California it is. Plus I heard Sam got a scholarship to Stanford. I wouldn’t want you two to be too far apart.” Cas was almost giddy. They had made it.
Claire was excited. “Are we going to be able to go to the beach? I want to live near the beach. Then I could meet a mermaid and we’ll be best friends!!”
The doctor told Dean that he would speak with Castiel about getting him on the visitation list and possibly bringing him in for a few joint sessions.  All Dean could do was sit on the sidelines and wait until his husband -
“Cas? Can we talk after we put the kids to bed?” Dean was gathering Aiden up in his arms and whispering over the end credits.
“Just cause you actually hit the circle doesn’t mean we
“They said indefinitely as long as I keep paying. I just need to figure out a way to get Cas to listen to me for two seconds. I just want him to try. He doesn’t need to do it for me, we both know I don’t deserve that and he deserves so much better than me. I just want to give him a chance to get better so that he can go out there and find whoever it is he’s really meant to be with.” Dean gulped down the last bit of whiskey in his glass and pushed away from the table.
“Cas, you know I love you bro, but you’re being stupid. You need to tell Dean how you feel. Spring break is next week, and the semester is practically over after that. You’re going to leave for whatever company snatches you up and who knows when you’ll see Dean again.” Gabriel had watched his brother pine after Dean Winchester for years. When they were children, he thought it was just a childhood crush. College happened, and they separated, they both had relationships with other people, but when Dean showed up on Cas’ doorstep needing a place to stay… he knew his brother was done for. Cas always held a flame for that omega, the only one he ever did love.
This restaurant was somewhat known for its karaoke nights and much to Castiel’ chagrin Gabriel seemed to be a crowd favorite. Every couple of minutes after signups were announced people came by the table to make sure Gabriel was going to sing some of their favorite songs.
Cas couldn’t shake the dream. After talking about it during one of his treatments Missouri told him it wasn’t unusual to dream when under anesthesia. To Cas it felt more like a memory than a dream, a memory long forgotten.
“I don’t know what to do Charlie!! Its been days he won't wake up…..no…. those files are sealed for a reason!!! Charlie don’t you dare!! They said all we can do is wait, the specialist already flew in.”  Dean took a few centering breaths; Charlie was saying everything to get him to calm him down on the other end of the line. When they finally hung up Dean flung his cell phone against the wall. “Damn it!!!”  Cas could hear his husband falling apart but wasn’t quite in control of his body enough to open his eyes just yet.
“Wow, umm ok well that’s all we need for the files. Next time I see you, I’ll be in scrubs.” Gabe stood up and walked away from his baby brother determined to save him if it was the last thing he did.
“Sorry, no can do bro, we..” Sam and Charlie pop in the frame and wave.” Are staging an intervention. You two have been pining for each other for years and frankly, we can't take the UST anymore.” Gabriel spun the chair around.
“Oh, yea they made that bet back when you guys were in high school. It was so obvious to the rest of us but you two were the champ of low self-esteem and king of obliviousness.“ The way Gabriel talked meant that none of what was happening between him and Dean was an unexpected development.
“She invited me to Mexico for spring break. However, I politely declined. I’m not sure why she asked me, she has plenty of friends going.” Castiel explained the conversation. “Oh Cas, you are so adorably oblivious. She has had a crush on you since freshman year. But you have only had eyes for one person.” What Charlie was insinuating meant that the conversation they just had was intended for a romantic getaway, starting of a relationship of sorts. Castiel knew he was always a little socially awkward, but he apparently had missed that whole situation altogether.
“Cas?”
Later that night…..
In an easily more calm voice, “ I’ve drawn a few more candy designs. Clearly, when I go back to work I’m going to have to apprentice in sugar pulling. Even I might not be able to accomplish some of the flowers that I dream of doing.” Castiel moved into the downward dog position thinking of his latest drawing of a lotus flower. It’s a flower used to represent new beginnings, a rebirth if you will, in reds and oranges, the colors of passion. Castiel couldn’t help but be optimistic about what the future possibly held for him and his family.
Pam guided Castiel into a dew yoga poses. “Good, now do you think the trust came as quickly as it did because you feared what Sam or Dean might say?” Castiel let the thought roll around his mind while they continued to stretch. Looking out the window was not as satisfying as it was winter and not as many plants were in bloom but Castiel let the view distract him from the few negative thoughts trying to take over his mind.
The two of them sat in a comfortable silence watching the rest of the documentary and finishing their treats. “All right, now don’t tell Jess you got it from me, but it’s a boy. They’re going to tell everyone over dinner tomorrow, so act surprised when they announce it.” Jess had already told Cas, she just couldn’t hold on to the secret anymore and had to tell someone. She’d even told him the name they chose, but that…that he had to let be the real surprise.
“You can’t buy your way into a baby’s heart you know that right?” Cas chuckled “Maybe, but I can try, I gotta be #1 uncle.” As the night went on Dean and Cas talked about all the things they could do to spoil the new family addition.
“What do you mean he’s moving out??!?!” Dean fell back on his bed. “Why would he need to do that?!?!” Dean knew the answer, Cas was a self-sacrificing, humble alpha. If he truly believed he was causing problems then he would fix the problem at his own inconvenience.
Drifting off, he barely heard Cas’s whispered good night.
“Where are you going? You’re leaving me?” Dean hated the note of desperation in his voice.
A grunt from Jacob signified the end of prayer, and food was passed around. Castiel built himself a thick sandwich of cheese, ham, lettuce, tomato, onion, and mustard. He spooned potato salad and coleslaw onto his plate, helped himself to the chips and the pickles, and turned bright red when he moaned around the taste of homemade bread.
“I know.” Cas’s eyes followed Sam’s to where Dean stood, wavering slightly as Lady Ellen and Captain Singer fussed over him. “He’s still rather weak, and needs a lot of rest. It was very close. Too close. He should be resting now.”
“I’ll help you.” More or less clean, Cas stepped forward and pulled Dean against his chest, resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder. “You can do anything you put your mind to, you know that? I’m so proud of you. You work so hard and you’re kicking ass in school.”
“Yeah.” Dean set his burger aside and reached across the table to grab Cas’s hand. “Thanks for staying with me,” he said, completely oblivious to the rush of butterflies he was setting off in Cas’s stomach. “You’re just--amazing, Cas. I can’t believe you just fell into my life like you did.”
Sam and Cas made more amicable small talk as they headed out of school. Claire took Dean’s left hand and he smiled down at her. In the last several months, he’d come to love that little girl as much as he loved her uncle. Just one more reason he couldn’t let his feelings become known and risk the rejection and potential loss of Claire as well as Cas.
“No, no, not even a little. But he might be in danger, and we’re trying to protect him. Is this him?” Dean unfolded the picture and showed them, aware of Charlie joining him.
“Well, if you ain’t afraid of hard work, you can stay here for a bit.”
“Uh - Steve,” Cas murmured, giving the name on the credit card Dean had given him. “Where - where am I?”
“Wait, are you eating falafel? Since when do you do vegetarian?” Aaron cocked an eyebrow at Dean.
Dean wished,
“Why on earth is there an angel in your brother? What were you thinking?”
“Yeah. I dunno. I just -” he waved at Sam and Jess as he took a sip. “I’m happy for them.” He sighed and took another sip of coffee. “Looks like everyone’s got someone,” he muttered, staring down into the mug.
“Yeah, ok. I’ll talk to her.”
Cas’s smile returned. “Can I at least bring you some lunch?”
Lydia returned a few moments later with two plates and her own mug. “I used to get those restless nights quite often.”
I didn't have as much time to spend on this as I wanted but I am still pretty happy with it.
Cas used a warm, damp washcloth to wash away the last of the shaving cream. “Maybe, but it could have been worse. Try to take the good with the bad. And I’m right next door and happy to help without teasing you, which is more than you could hope to get with Sam.”
“I think you surprised the bishop today. Surprised us, for certain. Where did you learn to speak our language?”
“And you say he’s still there? Where is this farm?” Charlie asked, notepad at the ready.
“Sam would be
Lydia and Charlie stepped out onto the porch silently.
“I’m real, I promise. And while we really don’t have the time to discuss these photos you were trying to hide from me, I assure you there is nothing off putting about them. Lucifer tormented me with much the same. Sometimes I thought…” Cas trails off for a moment and tugs Dean a little closer. “I know how you feel,” he whispers, pressing a kiss to Dean’s temple. “Oh, Dean. I feel the same way. I have for quite some time - maybe even since the first time I pulled you from Perdition.” Cas tilts Dean’s head up and smiles at him. “Ten years ago today, in fact.”
“I was uh -” Cas scratched at his sweaty hair. “Named for an angel,” he finally said. “But a good friend,” there was that little pang in his chest again, “nicknamed me Cas and it stuck.”
Back in his own house, Cas did a once over on his outfit. He looked ok, in a plain long sleeve tee, but he grabbed a black button down from his closet, layering it under a soft gray v-neck sweater. He contemplated ties for a minute but decided he was overdoing it. Cas grabbed his black tailored trench, the one he almost never wore.
Outside, Cas’s slightly improved mood slipped again as he found Cain with his arm around Dean, carefully escorting him to his ridiculous big red truck, although the quick once over Dean gave him suggested he definitely noticed the outfit. Cas smiled in victory.
“Hospital.” Dean reached out and took his hand, gently untangling the IV line. “You scared the shit out of me. Your fever shot up and I couldn’t wake you, so I went downstairs to call Donna and ask her to come look at you. While I was downstairs, I hear this crash, come back up to find you passed out in the hallway. I called an ambulance. We’ve been here three hours and you just now woke up.” He rubbed his free hand over his eyes. “Man, when you get sick, you do it right.”
Gentle hands brushed through his hair, held his hand, but his panic grew.
“You’re a fucking coward,” he told himself. Cas plopped on his couch and stared at the wall, ignoring the tears that burned his eyes as he heard Dean’s door open and close, but there was no knock on his own. He heard the throaty rumble of a pickup truck start up and fade away. “Fuck,” he mumbled, pressing the base of his hands against his eyes to stop the impending tears.
“No, don’t. I don’t want to talk about it.”
“No. I’m not taking it back. Take the compliment.”
“Nah, it’s my fault. Wasn’t paying attention.”
Dean blushed and stared down at the table. “Thanks,” he muttered.
“We can get a sub, ok? Cas, you’re sick. It’s ok that you’re sick. Buddy,” Dean chuckled softly, “you’re wearing a sneaker and a dress shoe.”
“Only by a couple of weeks. I’m sure everything will be fine. Look, I’ll ask Kat if Claire can hang out at her place and then join you at the hospital if you’d like.”
First, my incredible artist,
“So, seeing anyone?” he asked around his pastrami.
It wouldn’t have been the first time Dean lied to him.
“I wish you hadn’t have brought Dean back.”
“Born on the last day of February by three minutes. She’s lucky it wasn’t a leap year. And she’s got Jess’s nose, but those eyes are all Sammy’s. I can’t believe I’m an uncle to the cutest damn baby ever...next to Ben of course!”
“Yeah,” Dean mumbled, watching as Cas left the faculty room. He could still feel Charlie’s eyes on him. “Don’t say it, Chuckles.”
His mirror self, unsurprisingly, had no answers.
Dean screamed Cas’s name over and over, but he never came, he didn’t save him. Inky blackness began to replace the blinding white, and as Dean sunk back into unconsciousness, he sobbed Cas’s name one last time, even though he knew he’d been abandoned.
“Lydia Beiler.” She didn’t shake his hand and Cas felt a strange sense of satisfaction about that. “I’m going to go start a pot of coffee. Castiel, you can entertain your visitors in your rooms if you’d like.”
They sat in silence for a bit, both staring blankly at Dr. Sexy making his rounds.
“You have me,” Cas assured him.
“That’s awful,” Cas said. “I thought he’d be on the road to recovery by now.”
Charlie slid the pillow into the case. “I would have thought you wouldn’t want to let him out of your sight.”
Dean continued to fight them, alternating between angry growls and frightened whimpers. His eyelids fluttered, fever bright green eyes staring unseeingly at Cas before rolling back in his head.
Castiel sat straight up in bed, sweat soaking his shirt. He ran a shaking hand through his damp hair. Swinging his legs off the bed, he braced his hands on his knees. The wooden floor was cold against his bare feet, but Cas paid it no mind.
“I um - I don’t know. I don’t really have anywhere to go,” Cas admitted, staring down at his plate.
“Dean’s polyamorous?”
“And that’s just it. I was kinda hoping--I mean--,” Dean could hear Cas encouraging him in his mind. “Lisa, I’m really tired of only being a weekend dad.”
“Dean? This - these pictures - it’s alright. You haven’t done anything wrong, I promise you. But I want to,” Cas’s voice comes nearer and a hand lands on Dean’s shoulder, “I want to take you home. Sam’s waiting and Rowena isn’t sure how long she can keep Michael contained. It’s taking all the power she and Max Banes have to control him and they’re both growing weary. Once you help me shove him out, Sam and I have a container that will hold his grace indefinitely, but we have to get him out first. Please, Dean,” Cas begs, “please look at me.”
Cas ate the rest of his pie contentedly, warmed by the Bielers' kindness.
“I’m not - I’m not ready to be king,” Sam said quietly. “I know Dad thought I was - at least the non-possessed version did. That’s why he left me the knife. But I’m not. I don’t know what I’m doing and I’m scared. How am I supposed to lead a war? How do I make the decisions that guarantee victory? How am I supposed to keep you safe?”
“It’s not that,” Dean said softly. “Those are my people, but more importantly, it’s Sam. Sam, who wasn’t supposed to be king yet and is facing a war already. He needs me. That’s what matters. It doesn’t matter if I can’t fight as long as I’m there to be a comfort to Sammy. Don’t you see? Sam needs me.”
“I’m fine with that, although,” Cas stood and offered his hand to Dean. “Dance with me?”
Charlie attacked her breakfast with gusto. Dean worked on his slowly, methodically, half eavesdropping on the guys sitting behind them.
“It is.” Dean let his eye slip shut again, sighing happily as he nuzzled into his pillow. He was snoring again in seconds.
“Sure,” Sam smiled and winked at Cas before leading his brother out of the courtyard.
Dean stared down at the weird little pipe. Frowning, he lifted it to his lips and took a deep drag just like Cas had. He burst into a violent coughing fit.
He half expected Cas to take his place. Last he checked, Cas had gone back to not needing much sleep. But maybe he imagined that, as when Kevin woke him up for his shift, Castiel snorted, rolled back over and kept sleeping.
Sam went into his room and shut the door gently.
Castiel wrapped his lips around Dean's cock and swallowed the thing like it was made for his throat.
The motel was less than five minutes away, and Sam was firing up his laptop before Dean could even peel off his first layer of plaid. He felt disgusting. The humidity, the heat, the bugs that came with both. He told Sam he was going to take a shower while Sam looked up the victims. Sam waved his acknowledgment.
“What?”
There was a tense moment filled with the sound of everyone catching their breath.
“Oh,” Dean said softly as they started North. “With all the uh, excitement last night, I nearly forgot about that list.”
A customer made his way over to Dean, asking for a rental tool for his brake job. Dean headed towards the backroom to fetch it. Up on a high shelf, he spied the tool, grumbling as he got the ladder and climbed up to retrieve it.
Cas chuckled. “Tell your Mom I’ve got the stuff to make the cranberry dressing and the green bean casserole.”
He felt a little stab of guilt as Cas gave him a friendly wave from the doorway, and he returned it quickly before escaping into his own classroom. Cas wanted to see Meg again. He wasn’t interested in Dean, therefore, Dean going on a date with Victor should be a non issue.
“For what? For enjoying a hug?”
Cas tossed a happy grin over his face as he left Dean’s classroom and crossed the hall to his own. He was back a few seconds later with his cooler bag in tow. “I didn’t figure you’d remember lunch and I know how you feel about the cafeteria--” Dean pulled a face, “So I made sure to pack lunch for both of us. I made grilled chicken with pasta salad and a fruit and yogurt parfait. Does that sound good?”
He passed the barn and headed up the hill towards the apiary, zipping his coat as he went. The bees were buzzing lazily around the hives, the cold snap in the air making them lethargic and sluggish. A roll of tar paper leaned up against one of the hives he’d already wrapped.
“I’m a terrible nurse, I’m sorry.”
“There are others who can go.”
“Castiel,” Captain Singer smiled as he approached. “Good to see you.”
on everything!”
Please do not expect regular updates. I'm also knee deep in DCBB.
“Oh. Right, thanks. Maybe my blood sugar’s a little low.” Dean plucked one of his mother’s beautiful jelly doughnuts from the box, practically inhaling the pastry.
“Gushers it is.”

Huffing irritably, he rolled onto his back, staring up at the ceiling.
“Three bean soup and avocado with sliced tomato on toasted wheat.” Cas got the tray off the end of the bed and motioned for Dean to sit down. Dean sat and Cas positioned the tray over his lap.
He had a family.
“Cas,” Dean’s face was serious. “You
“It’s not?” Dean whirled on her. “Don’t I always choose Sam? Huh? Don’t I always make Sam first in my life? Damn the consequences and who cares who the fuck gets hurt as long as Sam comes first.” Dean shook his head. “Lived my whole life on that party line, why the fuck should I stop now?”
“Yes,” he muttered helplessly.
Cas found himself on the floor of his bathroom with no idea how he’d gotten there. His head hurt, and he was laying with his cheek pressed to the toilet seat. “Gross,” he muttered, but utterly lacked the strength to raise his head.
“Yeah, just didn’t sleep great last night.” Dean didn’t want to tell Cas his sleep had been disturbed for a while now--the last time he’d slept really good, Cas had been in bed with him.
“No. I’m tired. Good night,” Dean said, even as his growling stomach made a liar of him.
Now there were two idiots laughing at him. Dean slammed his tupperware back into his lunchbag. “This is why I eat in my classroom,” he muttered irritably, standing up so fast his chair shot out behind him.
“Don’t - please. He’s just - he makes these worlds and they play out like movies, at least until I figure it out -” Dean makes a grab for the photo and the other one - the wedding picture - falls from his hands.
“Baby’s first case of munchies.” Cas giggled. “Let’s go see what we got.”
“What are you -” Crowley started.
They stumbled and pawed at each other’s clothes as they slowly made their way up the stairs. Vic lost his balance at the top, landing on Dean. He didn’t seem to care where they landed, too busy leaving a mark on Dean’s chest. Vic slid his hand under Dean’s shirt, and Dean gasped into his mouth when his fingers found a nipple.
Wow. Last updated on 9-27-16. Shameful.
Dean’s blush was impressive. It started in his cheeks and dripped down his neck. “Yeah, ok,” he muttered, staring down at the floor. “I’m gonna go get dressed. Cas, go get dressed and we’ll go.”
John and Benny covered their ears, sinking to the floor as Bobby continued the chant. Alastair charged Sam, but Sam countered with his blade, sinking it deep into the evil king’s shoulder. Red light sparked from the wound and Alastair growled as he sunk to the ground.
“Oh, so funny, like you’ve never used that one before.”
“Yes, he’s
“Yeah?” Dean slid his best grin onto his face. “You’re pretty hot, too.”
He got back to the table just as the waitress delivered their food, and Dean swallowed a wave of nausea.
” he blurted out, all in one breath.
Even with all of that, and family traditions, not one person seemed the least bit put out that Sam and Dean weren’t cops. Cas wondered what his life would’ve been like without family members insisting that he join the Navy.
“Tell me ‘bout it. But we get up there, Jacob finds the guy burrowed down in the hay. I wasn’t real impressed, but old Jacob, damn trustworthy fool, invites this moron up to his house. Now he’s livin’ up there with ‘em. Don’t trust him, I’m tellin’ ya.”
Holy crap, y'all.
“You’re no trouble. You’re just so sick and miserable and you don’t know what to do with yourself. It’s gonna be ok, Cas, I promise.”
Maybe he is, with the horribly embarrassing noises that fall from Dean’s mouth without his permission.
“Yeah, shit, that’s him alright. He rode up there on my load, was sound asleep when Jacob found him.”
Tears stream down Dean’s face as Cas steps closer and the look of concern, that fucking head tilt -
“Now, I want you to rest,” Cas continued, tucking Dean back into bed. “You need to recover. Your body has been through a lot the last several days.” Cas smiled at him, reaching up to cup Dean’s cheek. He couldn’t help but lean into the warmth of Cas’s hand. “I have to go away for a while, but I’ll return -”
“It’s good,” he told Lydia.
“I’d rather die,” Dean murmured. “Rather die than be a demon.” He shuddered in Cas’s arms. “Let them try,” he whispered, before slipping back into unconsciousness.
Dean shot him a warning glare over Cas’s shoulder and Sam quickly turned away. Dean saw that laughing grin just the same.
- the song was tailor made for that moment. Cas’s eyes had been so bright and honest, it would have been nothing to have gotten swept away.
He thought about Cas’s pretty blue eyes and the way he cooked for him and helped around the house. The way Cas looked at him when he thought Dean wasn’t looking. The sweet expression on Cas’s face when he asked for a dance. The way Cas seemed to constantly concern himself with Dean’s welfare.
She sounded confused.
Thanks to the twitter commune for coming up with the name of Mary's bakery.
Cas couldn't think of any good reasons to keep his eyes open, and he drifted off again, Dean’s fingers and soft humming accompanying him into the dark.
THESE FUCKERS I SWEAR. This wasn't even supposed to happen until the next chapter but I lost control of the little bitches and they hopped right into bed ARGHHHH
“Cas,” Castiel told him softly.
Silence fell over the table, all the eyes on him wide and surprised.
“Hurts,” he cried, “Cas? Cas, help me. Please.”
Back in his office, he took a few deep breaths, aware of how hard his heart was pounding. Dean grabbed a small box and started tossing the things he cared about inside. His pictures, his diploma from KU, extra phone chargers and an extra tie, anything he really wanted fit in the box. The Macbook belonged to the company, so he took a moment to put anything he actually cared about onto an external hard drive before setting up the computer to do a full wipe and reboot. He’d be damned if anyone benefitted from all his hard work. Dean was burning his bridges. No way in hell would he ever come back to this place.
“I can do this. It’s just shaving. I got this.” Dean slathered his face in shaving cream and reached for the razor with his left hand. He eyed it suspiciously. “Be a man, Winchester,” he chided himself.
“You do that, little man.” Dean lifted his iPad off the end table and pulled up the Wegmans app to start a grocery order. “You want some fruit snacks?” he asked Ben.
Curious, Cas set the roll and sheet of paper aside. “What did you do?”
“I think I’m going to beg off,” Cas said, not even thinking as the words tumbled out of his mouth.
“And Sam and I can help with the wash and wax,” Jack offered.
“Ok. I’m gonna get my art stuff!”
“What are you laughing at?” Adler asked. “What could possibly be funny about this?”
The reception was at a bar called The Roadhouse, owned by Sam and Dean’s beloved Aunt Ellen and her daughter Jo. Cas got to meet Dean’s godparents, Bobby Singer and Jody Mills, who were apparently engaged themselves. It seemed like every last member of the extended clan was a cop, married to a cop, or worked with cops. Ellen’s husband, Bill, had been Rufus’s partner a long time ago, but had died of a heart attack at a young age. Bobby had been Rufus’s partner until retiring the year before, and Jody was also a member of the department. Jo, against her mother’s wishes, was a cop, and according to Rufus, a damn good one.
“I wasn’t, ok? Sammy was dying from the trials and Ezekiel showed up. He was hurt too, and offered to fix Sammy up from the inside. I knew Sam would never say yes, so we tricked him.” Dean paced back and forth, wringing his hands as he explained.
The flame of anger already burning inside of Cas flared. “That’s why you want me to come back then? To fix your mistakes once again?”
“They are indeed.”
“Yup, babies take their sweet time. Don’t worry, she’ll be well fed and off to school in the morning.”
Dean raised his head and glared at Gabe.
“You’re the best friend I got, Cas,” Dean said sleepily. “Thanks for being so nice to me.”
Timothy Cain was quickly becoming the bain of Cas’s existence. The man simply did not go away and Castiel hated the look that Dean got every time he was around. Fair enough that they had history, but did Dean have to look at Cain like he hung the fucking moon? And did Cain have to try and flirt his way into Cas’s pants every chance he got?!
“Yeah, probably the whole week. Does that sound like fun, buddy?”
“I never said I didn’t want to stay...I just...I don’t know.”
“Alright. I think I’m going to take a nap until then.”
“Yeah, she dropped Ben off. Her husband took a bad fall, hit his head.”
Days he’d spent on the road, watching his meager supply of money dwindle and doing everything in his power not to think of Dean, or the cruel words that had tumbled from his lips. After two weeks, he no longer had the money for bus tickets. The credit card Dean had given him had no more funds on it either. Cas walked along a highway, thumb out, but in his scruffy, disheveled state, no one stopped for him.
“Well, that’s that. Let’s head on up to the house, Steve.”
“You’re phoning it in, dude. Like - you’re here, physically, but not mentally. And where the hell is Cas? Shouldn’t he be here, since he’s all human and stuff now?”
“Hey! I’m good, I am. Just kinda don’t know what to do with myself.”
Laying on his side on the couch, Dean stared at the tv half focused, watching as Dr. Sexy charmed his patients...and Dean. “Fuckin’ love you, Doc. Come fix my arm.” He saluted the tv with his half-empty El Sol. He might’ve been a wee bit tipsy, despite Cas’s orders not to drink with his pain meds. But, it was Friday night, a four day weekend, and Lisa was keeping Ben for the weekend since they were going on a short trip. Dean was bored, maybe a bit lonely, and his arm wouldn’t stop throbbing, pain meds or not. He considered calling Cas, but Cas had spent most of the week looking after him. He deserved a night off.
“He’s the one, isn’t he? The one who broke your heart.”
“Please.”
Liewer Herz - Dear Heart
Something was shifting between them. Castiel could feel it, like the ground was opening beneath them as he settled the check and held the passenger door for Dean to get into the Continental.
“That would be nice. She’s been wanting one.” Cas handed Claire’s book bag to Kat. “I already called out for tomorrow. I have a feeling I am going to be there awhile.”
“You are not.” Cas dropped the towel on the coffee table and sat down. “You look completely freaked out.”
“It’s delicious,
“Lydia, I -”
“But I promised Sam. I promised.” Cas shook his head. “I’ll have to leave him here. There’s no other choice. Even if he survives the ritual -”
He can’t. Dean shakes his head, refuses to turn around.
“I dunno, Jacob. You Amish are too damn trusting, you know that?”
“Shit, I hurt your feelings. I’m sorry, I definitely didn’t mean to be insulting. I was just…” Vic trailed off. “Everyone knows you’ve got it bad for Cas, but it didn’t seem to be goin’ anywhere and -”
“Ok, enough, enough,” Dean protested, his face flaming. God, Gabe had a mouth on him. He turned to Cas. “Didn’t you say something about donuts?”
“But Sam -”
“Oh, right. I’m sorry, I was distracted.”
Cas looked down at his feet in surprise. “That’s strange,” he mumbled.
“I’m sorry I yelled at you,” Dean said softly. “I just - I wanna go get him, ok?”
Groaning, Dean lifted his head just in time to see Cas disappear down the hall. He flopped onto his back and carelessly kicked his shoes off. Dean lay there, like a dead fish, until Cas reappeared with a tray.
“Ooh, what’s funny? Gotta be something good, since old Dean-o here looks about to explode!” He rubbed his hands together in gleeful anticipation.
“Why didn’t you just tell me? It would have saved me two weeks on the road, watching my money dwindle down to nothing. If I hadn’t found the Beilers, I likely would have starved!”
“I might have Ben for the whole week!”
“Nah. Maybe a coffee.”
Ignoring the hard stare Charlie was giving him, Dean carefully set his coffee cup down. “Uh, why?”
Dean would like me to come sit with him at the hospital. If you really don’t want to go to Kat’s--”
He wondered if Dean felt any remorse. If he cared at all. Did he wonder where Castiel was? Or was he just moving on with life, hunting and picking up random strangers in bars for sex?
“Lucky you, I happen to have a couple extra doughnuts in my room.”
“No worries, there’s always tomorrow.” Cas shut the bedside lamp off and kissed Dean’s forehead. “Sleep well.”
“I know, I know, don’t look at me like that! But the angel that’s in him -”
His friend’s eyes were hooded and staring at Cas’s lips. “I just wanted to thank you for tonight. You didn’t--you didn’t have to sit there with me and I am so grateful. You have this weird calming effect on me and…” he trailed off as he looked up. Dean moved in closer. “Thank you,” he whispered and leaned in, leaving a soft kiss on Cas’s cheek.
man. I feel the Lord is telling me to watch over you. I might hear it from the Bishop, mind you, but I’ll make him see reason. Ain’t right to send a man with nothin’ back out into the cold world.” Jacob went back to tossing bales onto the wagon as if they weighed nothing while Cas stood beside him, lost in thought.
“Sent a parchment, a list of his demands. If you are sent to him with your dowry by sunrise tomorrow, he’ll withdraw. Otherwise…” Sam trailed off. “I’m not giving in, though. You mean too much to me. He can’t have you. Not to mention he’s probably lying about withdrawing.”
Dean just sort of collapses in on himself. He draws his knees up as tight as they’ll go and buries his face in his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That would be great. I didn’t pack anything.”
“Headache,” Dean muttered back, voice muffled by the pillow. “Go ‘way.”
“Yeah,” Dean said back, voice sounding as dazed as Cas felt.
On the wagon ride home, Castiel found himself full and content, leaning back in the buggy and smiling as the New York countryside went by.
“Really. I don’t make friends easily. I never have. Jimmy was the more outgoing of the two of us. I haven’t had--I haven’t really had to make friends. Jimmy made friends and then they became my friends. My one and only actual romantic relationship was with a woman who was one of his and Amelia’s friends. But, I moved in and met you and it--I don’t know Dean, but it felt like coming home. Like I was meant to move here and meet you, and Sam, Kat, Charlie, your mothers--it was like coming home.”
“I’ve got to get back to work. Hang in there, sweetie. And come talk to me anytime. I love you as much as I do him, Sam, and Jo. You’re one of mine now, kiddo. No matter what happens.” She ruffled his hair and he gave her a watery smile.
Lydia smiled indulgently at her husband while Cas spread some of the chunky sauce on his sandwich. The condiment was quite spicy but complimented the sweet ham perfectly. He couldn’t help but think that Dean would enjoy it. “It’s delicious,” he told Jacob, and the man beamed his approval of Cas’s words.
“Dean, you need to wake up. You need to take control.”
“Yes, thank you.”
Kissing Charlie softly on the cheek, Dorothy waved jauntily before turning to walk through the door.
“That’s it? Just family. Like a brother, right?”
“I’m sorry,” Cas said, helping Dean into his coat. “Can I take you out to lunch? My treat. Anywhere you want.”
Day later but better than never eh? At least it's nice and long.
“Oh Dean. Sweet, sweet boy. First thing you need to learn about demons,” Alastair sneered, drawing close until his lips were millimeters from Dean’s own. It took everything the prince had not to rear back in alarm. “Demons
“The beans are work intensive but worth it. Homemade cream of mushroom soup, homemade fried onions -” Dean’s stomach growled loudly and Cas cocked an eyebrow at him. “Skipped breakfast again?”
first in the presence of other faculty members. And Dean Heart-of-Gold Winchester did which means I win. Pay. Up.” Charlie thrust her hand under Gabe’s nose. He rolled his eyes but gave her a twenty.
“That’s Dean?”
Dean smiled and backed out of the room, pulling the door partially shut. In his own room, he awkwardly stripped his clothes off and tossed them into the hamper, crawling into bed in boxers and a tee shirt. Dean was just about asleep when his phone rang. He groaned and sat back up, grabbing his phone off the nightstand.
“Me too. He’s gonna be pissed if he’s not better by Thursday. Boy likes Thanksgiving dinner as much as I do.”
“Hi,” Dean said weakly.
“Well, uncomplicate it and explain it to me.”
“Sawwy,” Dean mumbled, mouth full.
Besides they still hadn’t talked about that weird moment in Dean’s bathroom earlier in the week. Dean kept waiting for it to happen again, but it hadn’t and Dean didn’t know how to initiate it without looking completely foolish or desperate, and despite that weird moment, he still didn’t believe Cas really felt the same as he did.
“I never worry when she’s with you. You’re the best.”
“What does that mean?” Dean cocked a brow at Charlie.
A rest stop glowed in the distance. Maybe he could curl up in one of the stalls and sleep for a short time, but to his great dismay, the rest stop was closed when he got there, only open for trucks to park for a night.
For a moment, Cas was sure Dean would argue, but a look of resignation settled on his handsome face. “Yeah. I’m pretty beat. Come with me? I want to know what’s going on.”
“Did I really? I sent an innocent man out into the world with zero defenses. Sam’s right, we could’ve kept him here, where it’s safe.”
Settling back into the hospital bed, Cas couldn’t help but smile to himself.
“Exhale,” Cas whispered against his lips.
“What’s wrong?” Cain and Cas asked in unison.
“Ok.”
“Ok,” Dean said warily, letting Cas take his hand and pull him from the bed. He followed Cas through the hall and downstairs to the patio, watching as Cas lit the tiki torches. Grabbing cushions for the chaise lounges, he motioned for Dean to sit, joining him on the same chair.
“I know, love. Soon. Less than a year.”
“I um - I fucked up, Cas. Big time.”
Wandering down an elegant staircase dripping with lush green vines, he walked past the ornate pool that graced the center courtyard of the palace. Anna sat on a bench, in human form, her long red hair tumbling down her back. He could tell by her scent that she was also pregnant, although clearly not as far along as Gabriel, who seemed about to burst. An embroidery hoop rested in her hands.
“Unfortunate truth of my entire life.”
“Drop it, Sam!” Dean barked.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said softly. “I know you must miss them.”
“Who died and made you Cas?”
“Y-yeah?”
C amayo calz! - O Lord Above
Charlie narrowed her eyes again. “Sam is an excuse. What’s really going on here, Dean?”
Cas reached for Dean’s zipper and zipped the coat up, standing entirely too close for a doctor’s waiting room. Looking at him and Dean, the other patients probably thought they were a couple. It was a damn shame, Cas thought, that they weren’t. “It’s going to be ok,” Cas told Dean. “You’ll have the surgery and be good as new when it’s all over.”
“Dammit!”
It takes everything Dean has to raise his head, but he does, painfully and embarrassingly aware of his wet face. He looks at this version of Cas and for the first time -
“Oh, sorry Vic.” Cas wanted to see Meg again. “Sure,” Dean rested a hand on Vic’s arm. “Lisa’s got Ben this weekend, so I’m free and uh - up for anything,” he purred, ducking his head slightly and peering up at Vic through his lashes.
“Yeah, yeah.”
“I believe it is you who are awesome,” Cas informed him. “I’m going to miss Thanksgiving,” Cas said mournfully.
Dean blinks, afraid to speak. Michael has done this before, let him believe that Cas and Sam were there to pull him out. He was disappointed -
In the morning, the shouts of several deep voices roused him and he startled awake, sitting up in the middle of the small nest he’d made. Open fields rolled in gentle hills and the smell of farming assaulted his nose.
Cas stood in the middle of the dance floor as Mary walked away, his eyes still on Dean. “I hope you’re right,” he mumbled to himself.
“Anytime,” she said, gently cupping his chin for a moment before turning and heading back to the kitchen.
Oh. An IV. He had an IV.
“Nah, just tired. I should go to bed.”
“No, you’re fine, Cas. Just a bit helicopter-y.”
“Well, gentleman, this was an absolute delight. It was nice to spend some real time with you Cas. I can see why Dean values you so highly.”
“Yup. Be careful.”
“Ah, you’ve met.”
“They’re important,” Cas told him, turning away again.
comment had rocked Cas--he’d had no idea Dean felt that way. He had so many friends and always seemed to be the life of the party--lonely wasn’t a word Cas would’ve associated with Dean.
“So basically, it’s death or become a demon?!”
Before the end of the day, the kids had completely lost interest. Such was the fickle mind of a child. One person, however, had not lost interest at all.
Cain signaled that the check was paid and left the restaurant, likely to go get his truck. Cas put his own coat on and led Dean out the front door just as Cain was pulling up.
“Mmm,” Dean agreed.
They were quiet as Cas drove them out of the city, quiet as he unlocked Dean’s door. He helped Dean out of his coat as the air between them grew inexplicably heavier. “I should go home,” Cas murmured.
Castiel pushed the door all the way open. He didn’t like the contemplative look on Dean’s face. “No, Dean. We’re all prepared to fight for you. Alastair can throw himself off the closest peak.” Cas moved to Dean’s side, reaching down to cup his face. “Sam’s right. He can’t have you. You’re mine.”
“Did something happen?”
“Ben’s upstairs getting into art supplies. He wants to make Valentine’s decorations for my house.”
“Oh Cas,” Dean murmured. He wrapped a blanket around Cas’s shoulders. “How’d you get in here without me hearing? I was only in Claire’s room.”
“Good.”
And then he full on kisses Dean on the lips.
“You love him, don’t you?” Mary’s softly asked question made tears burn in his eyes.
“Tomorrow is Friday. If we lose, and they storm this castle, they’ll take Dean by force. I wish you’d have left him behind.”
The week before the wedding was miserable and stressful. Crowley seemed to be really cracking down on Dean, no doubt motivated by Zachariah, who seem to think it was beneath him to speak to Dean at all, instead just giving him nasty looks when he happened to run into him in the corridor.
?” Lydia asked, as Dean walked towards the porch, a big smile on his face.
“Cas, you’re burning up. Charlie, get Donna please. And Bobby.”
Lisa was on the other side of the door. “Dean, I’m sorry, I have to take Steven to the hospital. He slipped on the ice and fell and says his head hurts--”
“Dean?”
“But -”
“Did you take the pain pill?”
“Um--I think I know what you need.”
“You keep beehives?” Cas asked Jacob, eyes lighting up with interest as he observed the long row of hives. So far that morning, he’d learned how to milk cows, slop pigs, feed chickens, and toss pitchforks full of hay into feed bins. The hand me down jeans Dean had given him were dirty and dusty, his shoulders burned from the increased activity, and he was sure there was at least one or two pieces of straw in his hair, but Cas hadn’t felt so content in some time.
Dean blushed right down to his toes. “Uh--why Cas and Dean,” he asked, trying to keep his voice even.
“Steve?” A soft tap at the door. “Are you alright?” Lydia asked quietly.
“Don’t, Cas. Ok. Just don’t.” They sat in silence. Dean sipped his coffee and stared at the couples dancing. Rufus spun Mary around and she threw her head back and laughed. “Everyone’s having a great time.”
He was still staring blankly at the book when the Impala drove away.
“I can’t find my Scooby boxers,” Dean told him mournfully, wearing nothing but a towel around his waist.
“We’ve added rock salt, essential oils, and herbs that will help suck the poison from him. You’ll have to hold him so that the bite is fully immersed,” Kali explained, stepping into the pool to assist Castiel.
“I see. Well anyway--”
Dean felt his cheeks flame. “Cas -”
(Is this an accurate translation? I dunno. I used one of those translater things and hoped for the best.)
“No, but you want to. I can feel you over there, just fucking vibrating your little ass off to keep from opening your big mouth.”
“Are you ok?” Dean asked. “Seem pretty quiet.”
“Nice to meet you,” Cas said.
Lisa gave him a funny look. “Ok. Well--I’ll see you in a few days?”
“Can you cut up my chicken?”
“Oh yes, he’s a shameless flirt, always has been. Dean thinks he hung the moon. Growing up without John--his father--Cain just naturally slid into that father figure role. Anyway, Cain saw so much talent in Dean and thought he could be quite big in the classical music scene. Dean formed a trio with his friends Lee and Cassie and then they became...something else. He thinks I don’t know that they were all involved, but I do. I’m a mom. It’s my job to notice.”
“Yup.”
Something breaks in Dean and he forgets how embarrassed he is that Cas has seen what those pictures of memories - the real ones and the Michael-produced - hold. He throws himself into Cas’s arms and clings to him.
“Thanks,” he whispered, barely keeping it together.
“Cas’s bite -”
“I can’t.”
A short time later, Claire was happily toting a pile of stuffed animals over to Kat’s while Trixie carried her overnight bag and blanket, both girls running their mouths a mile a minute about the giant Hello Kitty unicorn statue they planned in their Minecraft Realm.
He couldn’t help it. Cas’s eyes filled with tears. “You are so kind. I don’t know what I did -”
Sighing, Dean pulled out of the lot.
“That’s not how you treat family,” Cas informed the empty room.
“Daddy, you don’t got no hearts up!” Ben complained. “It’s almost Valentime’s day.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“My students -”
“Gabriel - I didn’t know you were with child.”
Sam busied himself making the drinks. When both mugs were full, he settled at the table across from Dean. He fussed with his own mug for a moment before opening his mouth. “Dean -”
Dean turned away from her, crossing his arms over his chest. “It’s complicated. Really fucking complicated.”
“Aunt Jess,” Claire corrected him. “And Mary said I can call her Gramma and Ellen is Nonna.” Claire looked pleased by this turn of events. “So now I have two aunts, Aunt Jess and Aunt Jo, and Uncle Sam!”
Two days later, and still no sign of Cas. Dean was beginning to lose hope.
“And you stay back from the front lines. I can’t - I won’t lose you. No matter what happens, you stay back.”
“I don’t know that I did learn. The knowledge has always just - been there. I know several languages.”
“You’re welcome,” Dean’s smile grew wider and he disappeared again.
“I just feel so horrible and I can’t keep track of time and I’m so tired, I’m so tired, Dean.” Cas was well aware that tears were streaming down his face but he had no idea how to stop them.
“Yup. I’m excited, I’ve never had either one of those completely homemade. I didn’t even know you could make them homemade.”
Things moved fast after that, the hard velvet of their cocks pressed together enough to overwhelm both of them quickly. Cas knew he’d quickly grow addicted to the noises Dean made as his hips arched off the bed as he painted his own stomach in streaks of come. It didn’t take much for Cas to follow him down, adding the mess on Dean’s belly.
Terrified that his expression was betraying just how much Dean was enjoying this sweet domestic moment, he tried to think of anything that would calm him down. He ran through half a dozen images, finally settling on Bobby in a teeny tiny Speedo.
“No. No, you should leave. Leave, Dean. I’m staying.” He turned on his heel and went into the house, shutting the door firmly behind him. Cas walked across the floor to the door to his own rooms and shut that as well. He sat on his bed and lifted the German Bible from the nightstand, laying it open on his lap.
“That’s just it - Alastair’s demands, the reason he’s brought war to our lands? He wants you. Because the possessed version of Dad promised you to him.”
Blue eyes twinkled up at him, a slow and easy smile on Cas’s handsome face. “You’ve got me. You’ve always got me.”
“Dean, we got this. I’ll run you back to your house so we can drop Cas off and then Cas can go get Claire so your mom can get to the hospital, which is where I’ll take you after we drop off Cas,” Cain said calmly.
“She’s with your mom and Mary planned to take her to dinner.”
Dean parked his ‘67 Impala in one of the spots reserved for employees. He doubled checked to make sure his name badge was on straight and that his black polo shirt didn’t have the collar flipped.
“So where are you headin’, Steve?” Jacob asked.
“Guhhh,” Dean groaned. “Bed, dude. I’m too old to do this on the floor.”
Dean left him at a bus station in Salina with a credit card and $200, so Cas bought a ticket for the first bus out. Yawning, Cas rubbed at tired eyes and leaned his seat back. He didn’t know where he was going and he didn’t care. He was just going.
The stunned look on Dean’s face threw Cas. “You are?”
“What?” Dean frowned at Cas. “Babe are you ok? It’s hot out and you shouldn’t -”
A sharp slap on his ass startled him out of his revelry. “We gotta go, gorgeous.”
“Oh sweetheart,” Cas pulled Dean in and held him tight. “It was just a nightmare. Just a bad dream,” Cas soothed. Dean let Cas hold him close and comfort him. “Go back to sleep, love.”
“Timothy Cain?”
Nodding, Lydia led Charlie inside, leaving Cas and Dean on the porch.
“He’ll be ok. Mom’ll take care of him.”
“That’s what this is all about. Benny, show him the parchment.”
The redhead ran up the stairs and hugged him tightly. “Hi! I’m Charlie, and I’ve been wanting to meet you pretty much forever!”
“I still can’t believe our new DM’s name is Dick. What the fuck,” Dean grumbled, lifting the stack of signs. As soon as he had them in his hands, the phones started ringing. Bobby took the call, but the line was still ringing. Actually, two more lines were ringing. “Gonna be one of those kind of days, huh?” Dean grumbled, dropping the signs back on the counter and reaching for the phone. “Biggerson’s Auto Parts. We’re Bigger than the rest! This is Dean speaking, what’re you working on?” God he hated their phone script, but turned his customer service voice on and did it every time.
“I don’t mind. When you’re done, I need your opinion on the shirt I bought for Sam’s wedding. I wanted to compare it to whatever you bought, so we at least look sort of similar.”
“Ok.” Cas’s face softened, and he put his hands on his hips. “I’m sorry. I’m just worried about you.”
“It’s all good, of course I can take Ben.”
“My mate - demon bit him over my bite - help -” he gasped, before collapsing to the floor and passing out cold.
villain, but he’s also a victim. I mean, they raised him alone in a lab. That would fuck anyone up. He’s still hot.”
Huge thanks are a thing that must happen.
“Rushford, New York. Coupla hours east from here.”
“Dean, wait -”
“I would never, ever call you a disappointment.” Cain told Dean seriously, his voice warm and affectionate. “I might be disappointed that maybe you didn’t choose the path I would’ve chosen for you, but I am definitely not disappointed in you.”
Looking from Crowley and his obvious confusion, to Adler’s apoplectic face, to Gordon’s smug expression, Dean threw his head back and laughed. Laughed until tears streamed down his face. When he finally calmed, he wiped his eyes and looked around at several shocked faces.
“Yes!” Dean snatched them from Cas’s hands and let his towel drop to the floor before pulling them on. Cas enjoyed the show for a moment before remembering why Dean’s boxers had been in the hamper.
This can’t be real. It can’t be. Michael is so deep in his head he’s pulling out every stop to keep Dean quiet and docile and Jesus Fuckin’ Christ, it’s working.
“Alright, well I’ve just about got lunch ready. Pull up an extra chair.” She smiled at Castiel. “Lydia Beiler.”
Dean chuckled. “You really don’t like him. How come? He’s really a decent dude when you get to know him. He doesn’t mean anything by the flirting. I know it’s gotta be awkward to have a dude flirt with you when you’re straight and all.”
“I’m fine,” Dean said, stepping back into the room. Castiel caught him as his knees gave out, making a lie of his words.
“Hey,” Cas said, settling beside him. He slid the coffee and cream over. Ellen definitely knew Dean well, because all Cas had ever seen him drink was black coffee. But, without really even looking, Dean dumped two sugars and three of the creamers into the mug. “Are you alright?” Cas asked softly.
“I need surgery,” Dean told him glumly. “My elbow needs to be rebroken and reset. This sucks ass.”
“I don’t know.”
Five minutes later, he was sitting on the closed lid of his toilet while Cas pressed toilet paper against the cut on his cheek. “Why didn’t you just ask me to help?”
“The night you kicked me out, you mean.”
“I haven’t eaten since yesterday morning,” Cas whispered, face burning with shame.
“No. This was before I got my eyes fixed and I had to wear glasses. Big dork, trust me.”
“Thank you. There’s plenty, so please, eat all you want.” She motioned to a chair on the side of the long table, and Cas’s eyes took in the spread.
. It’s the small set of rooms attached to the main house.” Jacob tossed a bale of hay into the wagon. “My
“There are some things, some people, worth dying for. You taught me that. Plus, it seems like your Men of Letters crew designed this place to be pretty impenetrable. Like a Death Star without a fatal flaw.”
“Understandable.” Cas patted his shoulder. “Text me if you need anything before then.”
“Come again?”
“Hold him, help me get his mouth open!”
Right?
“Want Cas -”
“Well then,” Daniel chuckled. “That would make life much easier for you here, since most of us do prefer our old,
“Upstairs using the little boys’ room. Have a seat,” Cain purred, patting the couch cushion next to him. Cas sat on the far end of Dean’s couch. Chuckling, Cain took a sip of amber liquid from the crystal tumbler in his hand. “You really don’t like me, do you?”
“Dean.” Cas’s voice is gentle, like he’s talking to a frightened animal.
Cas was setting jars of honey in the sale cabinet when he caught the sound of an engine. It sounded familiar, and he listened as it came up the hill towards the house. He’d just made it to the porch steps when the sound rounded the bend and his heart jumped into his throat when he saw the car.
Cas wandered the halls of his father’s beautiful palace, waiting for Kali and Gabriel to fetch him. He’d wanted to stay by Dean’s side during the ritual, but they refused him, afraid that seeing Dean go through so much pain would cause Cas’s alpha to rise and stop them. They were locked in a room in the basement of the palace, and two of his cousins, Inias and Ion, stood guard at the doors. Strong as Castiel was, he’d be no match for two alpha dragons.
“Demon bites change humans, much like dragon bites do,” Gabriel explained. “We’re trying to flush out the demon saliva so your bite can take hold - but it’s not going well, at least it hasn’t so far.”
tongue.” He slapped Cas on the back. “I rather like you, Cas.”
When they breathlessly separate, Cas pulls back and smiles at Dean again. “It’s time to go.”
Charlie was none too pleased when Dean sprayed coffee all over the table, but he was already on his feet, picture of Cas and fake badge in hand.
Lydia’s grip on his arm tightened. “
“Are you alright?”
“Sounds good to me. See you later.” Dean dragged his fingers down Victor’s arm as he moved past him. He could feel Vic’s eyes on his ass as he walked to his classroom. Dean had worn the good jeans that day.
“Uh - no. Not at the moment. You?”
“Yeah, Jess has uh--the baby’s umbilical cord is in the way or something. She’s gotta have an emergency c-section and the doc says it’s fine but Sam is a goddamn mess and I’m worried for them is all.”
Silence reigned as they tidied and packed the motel room. Dean changed out of his suit and into jeans, a tee, and a flannel shirt. He carefully hung his Fed suit back on the hangers and slipped them into his garment bag.
“Don’t. What kind of alpha am I that my omega won’t allow me to care for them?” Cas turned away, arms crossed over his chest.
The next time Cas awoke, he was somewhere that definitely wasn’t his house. He tried to sit up but lacked the strength. It was cool, dim, and smelled weird. The bed wasn’t nearly as comfortable. Lifting a hand to rub his eyes, Cas got tangled in rubber tubing.
“What do you need?”
“Shit, Cas. I couldn’t -” Dean blushed. “I couldn’t leave you to go through all of that alone.”
Also I can no longer promise straight fluff. Dean still has some serious self esteem issues to work through with his sexual history (there isn't anything wrong with enjoying sleeping around, but he's beating himself up cause that what he do), and there's a little more that's going on with Cas's situation. But it won't be my usual agony angst fest. Promise.
Charlie nodded woodenly, her only acknowledgment of his words.
Cas watched him go. How had he managed to find such kind people? He stared up at the sky for a moment.
Minecraft game and that Kat would feed Claire and send her over after.
“No, I don’t,” Dean insisted, “And even if I did, he’s straight.”
. His one instructor--”
“Yup. Anyway Cain was about to take me for sushi. Want to tag along?”
“One, it’s not really a drug, per se. Two, I’ve been out for years. Made up for lost time.” Cas lit the pipe and took a deep drag, holding the smoke in his lungs before passing the pipe to Dean.
The fingers holding his hand squeezed gently. “I’m here for you. I want you to know that, Cas. I’m always gonna be here for you.” Dean found a tissue from somewhere and wiped Cas’s tears from his face. He sat on the edge of the bed. “You’re my best friend. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you. Ok?”
“Ssh,” Dean pushed his hips into Cas’s, sliding their erections together. “Just like this baby, c’mon. Need you.”
Cas watched a happy bee buzz past him and smiled. “Bees are so important. Without them, so many of the foods we enjoy would basically disappear.”
She nodded and left. Dean couldn’t help the bubble of excitement building in his chest. It was Monday. Maybe Lisa wouldn’t pick Ben up until Sunday evening, like she normally did when he had Ben on the weekend. Potentially a whole week with his kid? Damn right Dean was excited.
“I quit,” he told them, standing up. “Effective immediately. I fucking quit.” He tossed his stack of manila folders at Gordon, watching in satisfaction as they opened and sent papers flying. “You want my job, pal? All yours. Have fun.” Still chuckling, he grabbed his suit jacket off the back of his chair and tossed it over his shoulder. “Arrivederci assholes!”
Opening the door of the small bath, the delicious aroma of food threatened to knock him off his feet. “It smells wonderful,” Cas told Lydia as he walked back into the kitchen.
“I’ll see you later.” He darted out the backdoor and down the steps, hurrying up his own steps and into his house before Dean could stop him.
