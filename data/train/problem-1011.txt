A man called out to John as he limped through the park, getting some daily exercise as recommended for both his physical and mental health. John was out of shape enough already and was getting soft around the middle. Best to nip that in the bud. He did it grudgingly, grimly, but he did it. Maybe he’d write about it on his empty blog. Talk about his aches and pains, and how annoying the sunshine was.
“Well, there’s groups you can go to. You could meet fellow Determinists, see if one of them-”
He waited for her to look up, to introduce herself first. To ask him a question, to say something random. He hated going first, because it pretty much guaranteed they wouldn’t be a match. The air in the office was stale and cold, and there were no sounds except the rapid click of her fingers on the keyboard and the soft whirr of the air-conditioning. She glanced up at him waiting there, leaning on his cane. But she didn’t say anything, she just stared at him, her fingers going still on the keyboard. He stared back.
“Alright. I’ll give it a try. Once.”
“Do you not want us here?” he finally asks, trying not to let despair fill him. He’s been happy here, and he thought Sherlock was happy with the arrangement as well. The frown on his face says otherwise though.
“Sherlock, can you look at these pictures for me? I’m not sure what’s going on.”
“I am very good at what I do.”
“Why did it need to be in there at all? I told you, Victor’s disappearance has nothing to do with my career or the scarlet files.” Sherlock’s face was hard, his hands fisted at his sides, his hair a rumpled mess. He still looked gorgeous, the fucker.
“If we don’t make it tomorrow …” John began. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to say, but he wanted to start the conversation they needed to have.
“Of course. Completely extraordinary.”
“That’s it for now. I’ll send along more information soon.”
“And you look like shit.” John slid into the seat across from Eurus at the coffee shop they’d decided on and rubbed his hands through his hair.
Sherlock started the video from just before the woman’s exclamation. The top of the tower was out of view, so John couldn’t see the start of it, but just before the camera zoomed in, he caught a dark figure falling from the tower. “That’s Glushka too?”
Sorry, I’m a little scattered. Hard to know what to write on the possible last night of your life. I guess I just want to say, thank you for following along with me. It’s been fun. I’ve learned so much, from you and from Sherlock. I’m glad I got to share a little of him with the world and even gladder he’s in my life at all.
“Should we go meet Simon and Trent?”
They were both restless. They couldn’t focus on cases, they were barely getting a couple of hours of sleep a night. They clung to each other, hiding away from everyone else. They might have stayed that way, but for the knock on their door toward the end of October.
Simon shrugged again.
“Let me catch you up,” he said.
“I think you need a fire. It’s still cold in here.” She moved to the fireplace and began laying it. “It’s not really autumn without a fire, is it? You’re not as cold this far south, but it’s still chilly.”
“What about him?”
He sat back down in the chair, trying to decide what to do next. Some small talk with Mrs. Hudson was interrupted by Sherlock’s return. He loomed from the doorway, staring at John, who kept his face placid while waiting to see what the strange man would say.
It only took about two minutes on site for Sherlock to be distracted. John looked up from listening to Sammy’s few memories to see his friend staring at the wall across the one-room building. The cabin was run down, had shuttered windows, and only contained a couple of chairs, a camp bed that looked newly purchased, and a box of tinned food. And the old wooden walls were covered—top to bottom, three hundred-sixty degrees—with charcoal drawings and symbols. They looked child-like, but the full coverage meant Sammy couldn’t have drawn them. Actually, they made John think of a combination of cave paintings and the things drawn on Simon’s and Trent’s walls at Nether Edge.
“You had a nightmare too. It took a couple of minutes to calm you as well.”
John mentally shook his head to clear it. He’d got little sleep the night before, or the night before that and the one before that … He was still having those strange dreams—demons dragging Sherlock away screaming, bloody walls covered in symbols, tall men who jeered at him as he watched everything fall apart, helpless and frustrated.
John sighed and rubbed his gritty eyes. Eight hours of sleep over the last four days total was taking its toll. He couldn’t think clearly. He didn’t know how Sherlock was managing to continue on normally. The man claimed to need less sleep than most people, but an hour or two a night was unhealthy for anyone. “I don’t know. Does it matter? What matters is stopping bad things from happening, which they will, no matter whether its supernatural in nature or not.”
“Fine.” He sighed and steepled his hands in front of his face. “Those are cases I don't have the resources or technology to disprove.
John turned to Sherlock. “So why did I receive this?”
John laughed. “You’re having me on. Next you’ll tell me they all died within a year of hearing it.”
He went for the disarming grin. “A necessity in my line of work. And please, call me John.”
“So you assumed it had something to do with your blog series.”
Holmes grinned. “Yes, they are.”
“Everything. Your research, the cases, Sherlock. I got caught up on your blog this week, did some digging of my own. I know things are getting … dicey.”
“So, if it’s not a cure, what is it?”
Okay, so I thought it’d be hilarious to drop hints of Mycroft being too busy fighting Cthulhuian horrors to help them out with their own apocalypse. Funny? Yes? No? Okay, just me. But hey, if someone else did find it funny or at least intriguing, please write the companion piece that details his adventures. I want to read it.
“... has her own problems,” John finished for his acquaintance. His sister had sent him off with a barely used mobile and a shrug. Divorce occupied most of her few sober hours. It was for the better, them not being around each other. He didn’t need her drama bringing him down further, and she certainly didn’t need his.
He had been eyeing the kitchen mess when Sherlock started his swooning Regency act, so he let his mind switch gears onto the other task he had on his to-do list.
“And since when do you, Sherlock Holmes, shy away from trouble? More than that, you’re a puzzle solver
Sherlock scowled. “I’ve tried solving those. Technology is not sufficiently advanced yet.”
John froze. It wasn’t unexpected, that Holmes knew about his past assignment. The man was very smart, and an investigator, so he’d probably done his research before he’d agreed to an interview with John. Still, it was a subject he didn’t like to talk, or even think, about. And, of course, there was the fact that Holmes had asked ‘Afghanistan
“Your wife believes these shadows are more than what they are. The burden of proof lies with whomever is claiming the existence of something outside the natural world. She's bending reality to her preconceived ideas, she's seeing these shadows around Sammy because she expects to see them.”
“Mmm.” He shook his head in an effort to wake himself up. There would be no sleep until they’d talked this through. “It was just a few lines. It’s not like I did an entire post on it.”
Sherlock frowns. “You’re a single parent. You shouldn’t be doing this on your own. I am her godfather, and as I won’t be seeing to her religious education, then I must help out in other ways.”
this expedition. I couldn’t find mention of it anywhere else prior to this event.”
John crossed his arms. “What happened in Hassocks in 2001?”
Sherlock groaned. “There is nothing to prove or disprove with this one. It’s just a silly urban legend.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “I had … other things occupying my time then.”
“Where is she now? What does she do?” John was curious journalistically. He wanted to track her down and get her side of the story. But it was more than that. He wanted to know everything about Sherlock, whether it had to do with the paranormal or not. He wanted to know what formed him, what made him tick, what influenced his actions.
“Look closer, Mr. Holmes.”
“Why should we?” Sherlock retorted. He put a hand on John’s shoulder to signal their exit and turned to slide himself out of the booth. “If you’re not going to tell us anything, this meeting is no use. I’d say it was good to see you Victor, but–”
“I think it’s good, though, that some of these things are coming to a head. He needs to face his demons.”
Sherlock sat back from the microscope but stared into his lap instead of looking up at John. “I walked into a shop, and when I came out five minutes later, he was gone.” His voice was soft but matter of fact, devoid of emotion
“You can make anything look connected if you try hard enough. Apophenia.”
John shook his head. The man was obsessed with debunking every interesting bit of the case. “We’ve heard about four distinct instances of the strange happening to this family. How is that not evidence of
“Oh, God. This is one of those lesser of two evils things, isn’t it?”
“Yes, we do, Sherlock. I’ve been reading Scriabin’s notes from Simon. It’s the only way.”
“Ms. Holmes.”
“Any sufficiently advanced technology is–”
“I saw the men too.”
“It happened more than once,” Robert argued. “She was giving him a bath a few weeks later when she felt something behind her. When she looked, it was that tall thing in black standing in the doorway. It almost gave her a heart attack.”
John had clambered out of bed during the explanation and began dressing, after which he took out several shirts he never wore that Sherlock had added to his bag, instead dropping in his favorite jumper and a few more comfortable shirts. Sherlock glared but allowed it, stepping back to let John finish packing himself.
“No,” Sherlock said flatly.
“Right again. Percival Black didn’t read music at university.”
Sherlock stiffened. “Well, I guess it’s good this came out before we’d worked together too long. As soon as we return to London, I can give you your last paycheck and–”
He squinted. It was a man. Or the shadow of a man. A dark shadow in the background, standing right next to an old shed. It looked like a tall man wearing a hat, but its proportions were all ... stretched. It was impossibly thin. He almost mistook it for the shadow of a tree except that it looked like it had arms and legs. The video’s graininess made it hard for John to tell though.
John gaped. God, Sherlock was completely oblivious sometimes. “Because she wants to help! Because she’s your
John snorted. “I can imagine. Well, let me get you my research and a few of the scarlet files to take back to your hotel. Tea?”
“Um?” Trent scratched the back of his head and looked up a Fred.
Wolfgang sighed and glared half-heartedly. “If I get in trouble, I’m blaming you.”
John’s ears perked up, remembering his talk with the professor at Bath, and Percival Black’s disappearance after having been seen in the area. “Boulder Field?” he asked, naming the location the professor had given him.
John followed him to the desk and stooped behind Sherlock’s seated figure to avoid the screen glare. The video showed an American couple on vacation. As the man was talking about their trip from in front of the camera, the woman filming said, ‘Oh my God!’ and zoomed into the tower. It happened so fast John almost missed it. “Back it up,” he demanded. He leaned in closer, using a hand to steady himself on Sherlock’s shoulder.
could be that important?”
Sherlock deigned to explain things to John. Usually over take away or tea.
“On your blog. You wrote about my personal life. We didn’t agree to this.”
“We’re going. I’ll book the flights after lunch.” That said, John stood to head into the kitchen. This far into their friendship, he knew how to deal with Sherlock’s sulks, and he was stubborn enough to win on occasion. He felt confident this would be one of those times.
“No, you are not,” Sherlock said, and John’s heart skipped a beat as the man – his soulmate – smiled at him with genuine admiration for the first time. “You are something truly special. Or you would not be my soulmate.”
The next woman to greet John was a young brunette who was so pretty that John decided to take the lead again and introduce himself first. It felt awkward, setting things up for the reply he wanted, but these people were all like him –
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” the man asked, not even making eye contact as he fiddled with John’s phone, lazily asking a strange question rather than introducing himself properly like everyone else in the world did who wasn’t a
“With my leg?”
John smiled. The man was definitely odd, just like he’d been warned. But he was the furthest thing from boring that he could imagine. He was brilliant… fascinating. Sherlock was exactly what he needed in his life right now, and that was
“No… no. I guess I’ll give it a whirl. It’s fated, after all.”
“Oh!” Molly said, with a painfully fixed smile. “That’s… lovely, Sherlock. Congratulations.”
The man went very still, and slowly looked up from John’s phone. He looked utterly flabbergasted, and said softly, “I must admit I never imagined those words would be said in a morgue laboratory, of all places. In the middle of a dangerous police investigation seemed the most likely scenario. I was very relieved it wasn’t Anderson or Donovan. Or, well… most people. Most people are idiots.”
“No! No, sorry,” he apologised. “I’m waiting for my soulmate.”
-000-
“Guess where I’ve travelled to recently?” he asked.
She underlined something in her notebook. He could guess what it was, without seeing the words again.
“It’s alright.”
Her voice was irritatingly placid as she said, “You know, not everyone who goes to Determinist meetings believes in their philosophy. The hard-core extremists don’t even go to them – they view it as cheating, as not showing enough trust in the universe to guide them to their soulmate. Many of them are more like you and Amy. People hoping for a chance.
“I hate those bastards,” John said bitterly. “I’m not one of them. I hate the lot of them, and their antiquated beliefs about fate and ‘letting it happen naturally’. All that bullshit about the mystery of it all, and none of them registering their names in the database, because it takes the ‘magic’ out of everything.”
John trailed off uncertainly with a sigh. It still wasn’t done to talk about your soul mark, and most people in Europe kept to the old tradition that said that the words around your wrist should be a hidden secret that you shared only with your soulmate. In this modern era the vast majority of people entered their soul mark first words and contact details into a highly secure national database, so they could be discreetly sent any matching results to their own mark. Apart from that process, the old tradition of hiding your words in public beneath a bracelet held on tightly, if only to prevent unscrupulous people faking a match. Celebrities and the wealthy were particularly scrupulous about keeping their soul marks secret.
Thanks so much for sticking through the bulk of this story though! It's been a lot of fun. This chapter was a labor to be sure, I wanted to do right by it, and hopefully I did <3
Sherlock scoffs so loudly, for a moment John thinks that he’s sneezed. Greg looks back to the detective with some confusion.
John scoffs. “For God’s sake--” before he can finish that thought, his phone buzzes, and instinctively he pulls it out.
“Thinking about something?” John asks, surprised at how raspy his voice sounds.
Or, at least, I think for the first two seconds. Then an ear piercing whistle shrieks through the yards.
“Hey, Mike,” he smiles at the other. “We really ought to actually plan to meet up sometime, don’t we? This running into each other is just too random and far between. What are you up to?”
John blinks and tries to follow his gaze, and it settles on a familiar sleek, black car, and a
Or, that was the plan, until John finds himself on the couch with the detective that evening, naked once more. Sherlock is over him, pumping them both in his hand. It’s far too much, and John can hardly think straight, with the sweat, Sherlock’s soft moans, the way his hips feel when they jut against his, the way his shoulders feel when John digs his nails into him --
Undressing John is perhaps the most arousing thing Sherlock has ever done. It’s the thrill, of slowly unravelling him, button by button, knowing precisely what lays under every inch of cloth, every mole and scar, before it is revealed in the dull lamp light.
It takes half the amount of time ascending as it did descending, most likely because of my eagerness to be out of the sewer. Within half a minute I am directly beneath the light, another hole in a floor.
John jumps, his eyes widening in terror as he glances up to Sherlock.
“Well, someone who seemed to know you, who wanted information on you,” John huffed. “It was rather bizarre. He offered to pay me. I refused.” He adds his last sentence hurriedly as Sherlock looks up at him with a raised eyebrow.
“Dinner is overrated,” Sherlock insists. “Let it burn the building down, I couldn’t care less.” He buries his head in John’s shoulder, nipping at his collarbone.
“What’s the point?” John moans. “He already knows! He could do anything --”
“Sherlock, what the hell are you--” with his nerves so fraught as they were, John could hardly take this as well.
What did he expect it to say?
The following morning, as Sherlock types the most recent soil samples into the search engine, he hears a distressed “Shit!” from upstairs, a clambering noise, and then John is rushing down the stairs in his dressing gown.
Mary’s face falls. “Oh, right,” she sighs. “It’s alright… I ought to get some sleep, I had the morning shift today anyway. Here, before you go--” She stands just as John does, digging around in her purse. She pulls out a felt pen, and grins as she grabs John’s hand.
“My husband’s execution,” she says casually, with a shrug, as if she just mentioned the rain.
John groans. “A man dragged me to the old Warehouse district! He forced me in some car and demanded to know about you! That doesn’t give you the least bit of alarm?”
Why bother with the hurrying? It was still 7 hours until he’d meet her.
“So, he led you to some abandoned building to tell you his life story?” Lestrade asks them, his incredulous face highlighted by the neon police lights. “A serial killer. Wanted to have a friendly chat with you.”
But how the hell would I get back?
He prefers to be alone. His mind is at peace, or the most at peace it can be. The rioting noises in his head don’t stop, the pull and push of knowledge, the loud screaming of boredom, or the need for something to
? “That’s not the only reason--”
“Sherlock I lo-”
With that, Sherlock kisses him again.
“I was in control,” he hums. “I knew you would be coming. That’s why I took the police monitor.”
John stumbles down the stairs back into the foyer, in shock. He stands there for a moment with his heart pounding, trying to understand what just occurred.
Which way to go, then? There is no visible light in either direction, and I have no idea where each passage ends. I have no way of knowing how my decision will affect the outcome.
Which is just as well, because just as the door is closed he blurts out:
“Er, John… Your elbow is pressing into my lung.” Sherlock’s voice under his shoulder hurls him into the present, and he glances down to realize that he’s completely on top of the detective, practically splayed. It’s a common maneuver, especially if civilians are caught in the line of fire, yet when it’s done in a common setting John can’t help but feel it’s slightly obscene. He scrambles off of Sherlock with a hurried apology, but the other man doesn’t seem to be thinking of that.
But, whichever way, it’s incredibly distracting for him to try to be a proper doctor at a crime scene when the most gorgeous man he knows is undressing him with his eyes.
“John? John Watson?!” he hears a voice call as he limps his way through the park.
Everyone in the crime scene, every police officer and detective, seems to stop whatever they’re doing to stare at John Watson, their mouths open in shock. Including Sherlock.
Sherlock shakes his head. “These past few years the State has really been putting an iron fist down on it,” he says. “Those accused of selling to minors get practically life in prison.”
As I listen to the rain, another sound echoes in. Laughter, from close by, a woman’s, clear and shining. It’s followed by a man’s voice. I cannot hear what he is saying, but he is cheerful, he’s laughing along with her. I listen in interest, staring across the narrow alleyway to the darkened building opposite.
He stays in the position he froze in, despite the fact it makes his neck ache. In the darkness he can only pick out the stark contrast between Sherlock’s dark, ebony hair, and alabaster skin. His red lips are slightly open as he slumbers, and despite the earlier disruption, right now the man looks like he’s in a deep sleep, only able to be awakened by true love’s kiss.
“Well…” Sherlock purses his lips, regarding his plate for a moment. “For starters, I don’t spend so much time feeling guilty when I have affairs, like you do.”
Has Sherlock truly gone mental?
I step forward towards it in interest, realising as I draw near what appears to be a body of man.
good, and John can’t keep up enough. They’re pressed up against the door, wrapped around one another, and John is harder than he’s ever been in his life. Sherlock’s body feels so good, and each small movement with his hips makes a whining sound escape John’s throat.
“I don’t have a doubt that he would,” he laughs.
Two--
“Shit,” he mutters. “A prominent one, too. Three arrests and no consequence whatsoever. Had to have had some politician in her pocket.”
Sherlock turns to him with a smile. “Good morning, John,” he chirps (a bizarre tone of voice on him). “I thought I’d make you breakfast.”
I wash the rest of my body quickly, just enough to get rid of most of the grime that was covering me, hoping with an almost childlike fear that Mrs. Hudson won’t send me back in to finish cleaning properly.
Somehow, he finds himself back into Sherlock’s arms again.
But even these frustrations seem to fit with the general theme. John thrives in chaos, and Sherlock Holmes is one of its best agents.
“Right, eventually. Took me an extra three weeks, you know,” he snaps. John glances between the two, taking a step back as he watches the confrontation.
John feels a small shiver run through his spine. That made this a high risk case, didn’t it? Sex trafficking and brothels were rare, but the ones that were around were buried deep underground--it was one of the most heinous crimes, after all, a place where deviants got their fill of corrupt acts, and preyed on children or wayward youths, girls and
Sherlock talks a mile a minute when he’s particularly excited about something, and when he’s had a breakthrough with a case after three days of no sleep, his explanation of the crime is jumbled so much it sounds like a different language, but the detective never seems to notice.
Harry had found her Soulmate at twenty-one; everyone had been so jealous of her, especially John.
Besides, it was in the shower, which perhaps made it more palatable. The evil of what they were doing washed right off.
“And how are you planning on finding all this out?” Greg calls out after them.
“Ah, you both are talking!” A new, female voice chirps, and all three men turn to see Anthea approaching them, a wide smile on her own face and two coffee cups in her hand. “How lovely! We’d been worrying over you, Sherlock, you really ought to answer your phone once in a while.” She hands one coffee cup to Mycroft.
A metal table and a gurney lie in the center of the room under a heavy light, which is turned off at the moment. The room otherwise is relatively empty: cabinets line one wall, and at the far end of the room bloody medical equipment lies in a sink, waiting to be washed.
They stumble into the bedroom, where Sherlock pushes him onto the bed, and doesn’t give him time to react before he climbs over him.
John immediately deletes the message, because it makes his heart beat too fast, and his stomach churns. He goes home, to Mary, to the woman he’s supposed to be with, and the life he’s supposed to have.
“Can this wait?” John gasps when they pull for air.
Her wrist is outstretched to her face, like John’s.
Sherlock shakes his head, his expression becoming even more confused. “I read in the paper that you had nailed someone for it. You obviously figured it out.”
“How do you feel about the violin?” he asks.
I can only tell so much of them from the back. One is heavier, walks with a strange beeline, almost shuffling. The other is shorter, but even with my distance I can see his uniform clinging to a muscular frame, and his posture is straight, even when relaxed… And, he has a remarkable bottom.
She smiles again at me. “Edward,” she repeats, nodding her head. “Isn’t it much too late to be out alone in the cold? And that cut...Where on earth did you get it?” She clucks her teeth again.
Guilt, sadness, and anger all fill him at once, and he marches to the stairs to at least have an attempt of a conversation with Sherlock about this. He can’t just shut him out without listening--
“Think he’d come all the way from India to kill you if he found out?”
I must be very important, at least to someone, I think as I gingerly wash the blood out of my hair, which stains the clear bath a bright pink. It might have struck me as poetic, if I weren’t so damn hungry.
what you called me from across London for? To smell some hideous experiment of yours?!”
I stumble out into the street, using the wall for support, towards the trash bins that are tucked neatly next to the building to which they belong. I throw one open violently, much too far gone to care about the noise, or the mess I’ll create by digging through it. I need something, anything.
Her level of concern visibly increases. “And do you have a place to go?” Her voice is soft, almost scared.
“Hi,” John replies, almost on instinct. “I… My name is John.”
Sherlock watches in uni, as all of his ‘mates’ decide the easiest way around the love issue is to just shag each other, with no attachments.
“No,” Sherlock says evenly, taking a sip of tea. John stares at him in confusion. “I already called them. When you weren’t awake at your usual time, I explained that you were feeling under the weather, and that we had decided you should stay home and rest for a bit.”
Sherlock looks with the wind in his hair, and that sparkle in his eye.
Her name is Mary, and John loves her.
“Erm… I've got to track him down anyway, and ah, if you wanted I could take you back to the flat,” he says. “You don't look up for walking much, and the main road is quite a few blocks down.”
Sherlock lets out a breathless laugh, and leans in to bite John’s ear. “In five minutes?” he suggests.
“I’ve already closed the curtains,” Sherlock assures him.
“Are you serious?”
~*~*~*~*~*~
There’s heavy breathing, and John can feel both of their hearts pounding. This is all so foreign to him, he feels as though he’s lying on a cloud, or that he’s in a dream.
He nods, slumping forward even further. “By that point her parents had found her Soulmate… But he was some pious prick who never let her shine. She didn’t want him. We were going to run away. I had a contact at that point who ran boats for people escaping, we were going to go off abroad, have a proper life as a family away from this place.
Lestrade looks like he doesn’t believe a word of that, but sighs. “Eight o’clock sharp tomorrow, Sherlock!” he calls out instead, and the dark haired man just waves his hand again.
“I suppose you’ve got more of an inkling of what it would take though, wouldn’t you?”
Sherlock’s face softened into a smile once more. “Sit, John. the coffee is almost finished, and I’ll start the eggs.”
“Oh, by the way, how’s our Sherlock doing?” he asks, as if they were just having a normal conversation.
Sherlock blinks, and he looks almost surprised. Soon he smirks, and lets out that low, deep chuckle that always makes John shiver.
It doesn’t take very long for Sherlock to finish either, with a soft whine, and final thrust of his hips, and the detective collapses on John, peppering his face with breathless kisses.
John is starting to get the feeling that he’ll hear that a lot more. He huffs to himself, readying himself to limp down the street, and find a cab. Irritability was starting to rise in him, as he considered that maybe that was all Sherlock needed of him, a medical opinion. Even though any doctor could have given him that. He could have at least said
Of course, Sherlock does not have a dozen suitors he must dissuade, nor will John appear to him disguised as a beggar. But it’s the sentiment that counts, isn’t it?
Sherlock stiffens and recoils as John’s brain becomes more muddled and confused.
“That’s not the point!” John shakes his head wildly. “He knows about us, Sherlock!”
initiating--”
John nods, standing, relieved to maybe get out of this. Moriarty reaches his hand out, and John takes it.
“Yes, I’ll have my people call your people. Goodbye!” Sherlock says with a tone of finality, grabbing John’s arm and dragging him across the street. The pair still are leaning against the car, watching them leave as Sherlock pulls John inside, and slams the door.
I almost vomit at the sight of the stagnant water, which is a shade of brown that I have never seen before, shines as if oil has been spilled on it, and contains multiple pollutants, including an old boot, a large branch of a tree, and a rotting carcass of a sewer rat. Oh, God.
John shuts his eyes. “I’m having trouble getting used to this,” he mutters softly.
John turns and gives him a strange look. “Why wouldn’t I? He was being rude to you. You shouldn’t let people be rude to you. Despite everything, you don’t deserve it. No one does.”
“So are the things you do with your supervisor at work,” Sherlock growls.
Within a few weeks, Mary and he finally find a shoe box of a flat to call their own. He finds he’s gotten used to her, and has become an expert in rolling over and slamming a pillow over his head when her 5am alarm goes off. His overall sleep is starting to take a toll, and his patients have started noticing his constant yawning, but that’s what coffee was for, right?
Afterwards, they’re silent, at least as they untangle themselves and pull the covers around each other, panting and waiting to come down from their respective highs. Sherlock slips out only a few minutes later to turn off the light, and he hears John chuckle behind him. He glances back.
“Why?” Mike asks. “I don’t understand, John? John!”
Which is part of it. But John gets over that rather quickly, understands, somewhat, why he did it. To save John, to save Greg, to save Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock Holmes, proving that he has a heart, three years late.
But the clothes smell old, a hint of mildew clings to them. It’s been a while since anyone’s worn these clothes, or visited here at all.
. “But that isn’t how it’s supposed to work! Men can’t-- love men! It’s--” Why was he pursuing this? This wasn’t what he meant, but he finds himself wanting to throw a barb back at Sherlock and hurt him.
And, without even a nod to John, the other is gone from the room. And, with Sherlock gone, John has no lightning rod to let his thoughts stick to, and they go wild.
John shrugs. “Either, I suppose,” he sighs. His headache is finally starting to fade, but the rest of him still feels beat too.
Sherlock furrows his brow, as if it’s obvious. “Of course. They both have his eyes, which he already knew.”
“No, sorry, I forgot,” John mumbles.
John doesn’t respond to that. He hasn’t any idea if it’s a trap, or if Moriarty has just decided to indulge in some secret prejudices to him, but he isn’t taking any chances.
Their coffee comes, and Moriarty grins, immediately taking the mug from the waiter. As he does, his cuff slips down his wrist, and John catches a glimpse of the other’s Watch.
It seems, for once, Sherlock has fallen asleep. Usually the other is the one awake, at least when John falls asleep, and then when he wakes up in the morning. After their first few nights together the genius confessed to having chronic insomnia, due to some childhood trauma he had yet to divulge.
He needs to snap out of it. All of this ennui is just the stress of planning the damn wedding, which John wants to call off and do quick vows at the courthouse, but Mary wants this big event. Her family will be there, after all, as will all of the friends she’s accumulated through her life. John understands, but he’s also aware of how awkward it will be when he has no family and a handful of friends.
“No… I don’t,” he agrees, rubbing at his eyes now.
The casual tone in Sherlock’s voice throws John off, and he blinks in shock. “You what?”
John liked him. He didn’t bring up Soulmates, or that he knew about Lestrade’s troubles. That would be a transgression, as he knew he wasn’t supposed to know such things.
“Trying to feed you,” John replied dryly, waving a hand to the food. “What is all this?”
“I don’t know, John!” Sherlock shoved his fingers into his hair and curled his body in on itself. His next words were muffled but audible. “I
“Seriously, Sherlock? We get told just hours ago that there are some very bad people who want you, and you’re just going to shrug it off and say it’s nothing more than a silly conspiracy?”
John nodded, looking over his shoulder at the screen. It was the standard home video fair: a boy’s birthday party. Kids were chattering excitedly as they gathered around the guest of honor, who was sat in front of a lit birthday cake.
John raised his eyebrows. “Yet being the operative word?”
“Space. There’s not enough space. Rosie and I can’t share a bedroom forever.”
like the latter, but John was probably inserting his own hopes and feelings onto the situation. Sherlock didn’t feel things that way. And that was fine. Really, it was. He shook his head and looked away.
Sherlock dropped his arm enough to peak out from behind it. Whatever showed on John’s face made him sit up to face him. He said, slowly, “We can’t leave innocent children to the machinations of madmen.”
“He’s not scaring you,” John explained. “At least, he’s not only doing that. He’s composing.”
They finished their meal in silence while John attempted to calm his temper before it exploded. He could see why so many people in the paranormal community had such a hard time getting along with Sherlock Holmes.
“Sacred geometry?”
John’s stomach clenched. “Fuck. What am I going to do now? I was barely affording
“No. We were all pretty upset at this point.”
John looked at Sherlock, whose eyes were darting about in his frozen face. After a minute of silence, he turned back to Victor. “Spy?” John didn’t blame him for skipping the emotional part and going straight for the hook.
“One of them died on the base due to a staph infection, the other four died in a mountain climbing expedition, six months after their contract ended.” He paused for a sip of tea, then continued. “But it had nothing to do with the Unsound; it was merely a combination of bad luck and unsafe climbing conditions. The urban legend itself formed
“Simon Reese,” Sherlock said, jumping right in.
“Well, let me know.”
“Your attraction to her is obvious. I’m amazed she feels something in return. Not her usual type.”
Simon raised an eyebrow, and only then did John notice the dark circles under the young man’s eyes. “Possible, then.”
“But those people write their request or argument. This email was empty save for the video, and the email address was just a string of numbers. Even the subject line was empty. Doesn’t seem like they want more than to confuse or scare me.”
“Huh. The blood isn’t Maddie’s.”
Mike gave a gallic shrug. “Can’t complain. I’m an editor at
For now, though, he was content to have some peace and quiet, as much as one could get of either around Sherlock Holmes. He knew that soon enough, he’d be woken up at 3am to go search a tip or he’d be banging around some back alley, chasing after Sherlock. He—they—deserved a rest for a while. And he’d make sure they got it. For a few days at least.
“How many events?”
John shrugged. “We’re up against possible child killers trying to end the world, and he hasn’t slept soundly in five months because of nightmares and sleepwalking. Would your music be cheerful if you were going through that?”
I say succeeded, but Holmes would disagree, and he has yet to pay out the reward to anyone. Despite that, he has a few files, you see. In a cabinet full of the usual beige files are a few that stand out. They’re a deep red. You might call them scarlet. I asked him why the different colour. With a frown and a glare through his flat’s lounge-cum-office window onto the busy streets of London below, he paused before replying.
John turns from Sherlock, his head rolling. Unfaithful. Infidelity was rare, one of the worst sins to commit against a partner... How could anyone do such a thing? It always seemed like the most dangerous, harmful, and the least rewarding thing one could do.
There’s a moment of silence, where Sherlock presses his lips together. “Haven’t the slightest.”
“Yes, you
But it’s good. It’s
haven’t given me your paperwork for the case!” Lestrade continues, turning his annoyance onto Molly, who shrinks back. “My superior’s been breathing down my neck on it for the past two days, I need it
Still, he manages to get inside the flat. Sherlock arrives moments later, but slows at the doorway. For once he’s decided to respect other’s feelings, apparently.
A light across the room goes on, and Sherlock is illuminated under the shadowy warmth. He’s sitting in his own arm chair, reclined with calculating eyes.
“A friend?” he echoes incredulously.
Something pulls at John’s heart again, and he pulls Sherlock into the tightest hug he can imagine, squeezing him until both of them are out of air. Even then, he remains on the detective’s chest, and soon drifts asleep, knowing full well that his dreams will be full of dark haired boys screaming in pain as doctors band him, and little girls bleeding to death.
He’s late for returning to the clinic, but he doesn’t care. His supervisor gives him a glare as he walks in, but doesn’t say anything, not yet. Perhaps she’ll bring it up after they close, or maybe she’ll decide it’s not worth having to interact with John.
His heartbeat rings so loud in his ears he’s convinced that Sherlock can hear it. But the detective doesn’t seem to notice, having fallen asleep before John even came back from the kitchen (apparently, sex was the only thing that cured the man’s obviously chronic insomnia, aside from finishing a case).
Drive safe!!
.” The icy tone in John’s voice sends shivers down Sherlock’s back; he makes a mental note never to get on John’s bad side. “He’s just more intelligent than you are. And, if that’s your qualification for a freak, you’d have to call about half the planet that.
She leads me to the bathroom, and allows me to step inside before shutting the door softly behind me. I glance around the room for a moment. It’s like the rest of the house, modestly decorated, a repeating floral pattern snaking up the wall, a simple, porcelain sink and bath with brass knobs. The bath has a claw-foot base. Everything is completely clean, not a speck of mould in the entire room. Mrs. Hudson takes pride in her house, and the cleanliness of it.
“I saw your fingerprint on the screen,” he hums casually. “Next time, wear gloves.”
This time around though, he doesn’t bother trying to stop.
Thanks for sticking through with this, everyone! I've been busy with some original works and the whole process of trying to become like, a real writer or whatever.
He gets married. Sherlock is his best man. Of course he is, he is his best friend.
The last message received shines as a preview, from a contact named ‘MH’:
John puts a hand on his friend’s shoulder. “It’s alright,” he murmurs. He has to wonder if this is the first time he’s ever told anyone this. “I just… I needed to know.”
“Liar.”
, perpetually boring, short, white-toast…
The cab deposits them, and Sherlock holds out a bill to the driver before John can get to it. He slips out of the car as the other finishes the payment. Suddenly the London street is too small, or too big for him.
Or how, for just a moment, after he kisses Mary, there’s a chasm of heartbreak and despair in Sherlock’s eyes.
John can’t help but wonder what sort of family Sherlock had been born into, where some moral code embedded in their DNA was to die for secrets.
There’s that hideous smile again on Dr. Moriarty’s face, and he sighs in relief. “Good. I’m glad to hear it. I hope to see some more of you in the future, hm?” With that, he nods kindly to Sherlock, and walks back down the street, his whistle echoing off the empty buildings. John shivers again.
, he decides. Maybe a coffee cake to nibble on between patients, that would calm him down, something to give him a spike of energy.
“Him? Lestrade, how old-fashioned of you,” Sherlock tuts, finally taking the manila folder from the detective-inspector.
In Which Our Soldier Gets a Purpose, and Another Lost Soul is Found
The girl giggles now, turning away, while the boy’s eyes follow her with a self-conscious smile. They must think this is only the awkwardness of the first time, it is only that they have lost their virginity that they feel so giddy and confused. As they grow older and acquire new lovers, they will become casual and suave about sex, they must be thinking, hoping.
He’s waiting for an answer, John can see it in his eyes. “I… Don’t know…” he’s forced to confess.
“I’m going to lunch,” he says to the supervisor when he can’t take it any longer.
Even stranger is when John looks up, and realises the man is looking in his face, not his wrist, as is customary. The pensive gaze of those eyes make him shiver, and he steps back awkwardly. Before he can even say something, the pale man speaks.
“I would go to the depths of hell, soothe the demons to sleep, and charm the devil himself, all just to see you one final time,” he answers, grinning a smile that is half proud, half sincere, and he continues playing.
I cringe as I reach the ground, trying to ignore the animal corpse behind me, and not think about the things I possibly stepped through in the dark before.
He watches as Mycroft, just a surly adolescent, is told by an older man that he’s lovely, that he’ll take him far away, and never let him down.
The thought of having to do the same himself made his head spin and his stomach queasy.
It’s maddening, each gentle press of Sherlock’s fingers to that part makes him desperately want more, but Sherlock still refuses. John’s mind has been completely wiped clean, except for the pleasure and the frustration at how slow this has become.
This is quite a bit of a stunning revelation, and I sit in shock for a few moments. Finally I nod and give her a smile of my own. “Ah,” I say, as if I understand, and stand to clear my place.
“I'm sure you're well aware of the attention he gets,” the man says, his brow furrowing. “Occasionally he's sought after by various people; they want his intellect, or wish to destroy him.”
He could ask. Sherlock would not lie to him. All of John’s wonderings and nagging thoughts could be silenced by a simple, straightforward question.
“There’s takeaway. Get them tomorrow.”
And Mary…
Bile fills his throat as he tries to hush the girl again. She’s so young. Too young. But she was also too young for a child, too young to be alone, much like he was at her age. Too young to take pills they said would kill the fetus but would also kill you.
He squeezes Sherlock tightly against him in a hug, and forces himself to let go.
“What’s her name?” Sherlock snaps, suddenly stopping his movements to glare at him once more. “I didn’t get to ask that.”
. It’s odd, and makes him shiver, yet he has to admit, it is still incredibly arousing.
It’s obvious that Sherlock enjoys explaining his methods, even though he pretends to be annoyed at having to describe such an easy thing to him. In the darkness of the cab, with just the hints of streetlamps pouring in, Sherlock really does look like a porcelain doll, but far too animated for one, his lips are too turned up, but his eyes certainly are wide enough, and there’s something… mystifying about watching this. If it were any other person John would probably be tempted to punch them in the face for being a twat, but this man is… far too exotic looking for that. The way his hands move with such ease, to take his phone, to tap his leg, it’s almost dreamlike. No, it’s like a ringleader, completely confident and showing off his tricks, all for the audience of John.
Sherlock blinks, almost looking stunned, if John didn’t know better. “No, that’s the short answer,” he finally sighs. “The long answer is, whatever he’s after, I am too busy to truly care about.” With that he bends back over his petri dish, with a sense of finality.
He turns off the alarm, and gets out of bed slowly and deliberately. He doesn’t even dare to look at the Watch until he has on trousers, terrified that somehow him deciding on the black slacks would delay this further.
Sherlock’s heart melts, and he almost kisses John right there.
returns.
“Doesn’t matter,” Sherlock sighs, shaking his head. He looks exhausted, like he’s just run from somewhere. “I was trying to find Rachel.”
A broken soldier, a broken man, who nevertheless is somehow able to save Sherlock’s life and absolutely captivate him in a single evening.
“Of course. What else would it be?” John asked with a small laugh, but Sherlock shrugs, and turns back. His smile slips. There was definitely more to that reaction, probably some harsh memory of the past hidden in that simple shrug.
Sherlock scoffs. “Of course you do,” he snarls, the wall coming down just enough for a glare to escape. He steps away into the open space of the living room, beginning to pace, like he always does when he’s troubled. “If you don’t feel guilty over something, how would you survive?”
The mattress is soft, softer than I am used to. Stuffed with some downy feather, most likely. The sheets are thick and warm quickly. The pillows, however, smell of mildew.
He once kicked John awake to spare him the humiliation of a nightmare. There was a night when he was several hours late home, because he found a lost dog and “needed” to find where she belonged. The night John told him about how his mother died, he held him.
“We really ought to have you two over for dinner,” Anthea coos sweetly to Sherlock, as John’s eyes grow wider, his mouth slowly dropping as he puts this all together.
She smiles, revealing a dimple. “Mary,” she says.
“Ah, Mr. Holmes. Dr. Moriarty, of the Soulmate Allocation and Distribution Bureau,” he hums, holding out a hand. Sherlock’s eyes narrow, and he doesn’t take it. This doesn’t seem to phase Moriarty though, who just puts his hand back in his pocket as if no faux pas had taken place. “Excellent work on this case.”
“Could someone else know?” John demands, his heart beginning to pound as he saw how nervous Sherlock was too.
Mike had been particularly smitten with a woman who was a few years older than them, already working rounds in the hospital while they were stuck in the classroom. She had dark hair down to her waist, was wickedly tall, and sang in the shower, which would wake John up every time she spent the night with Mike…
“It doesn’t matter,” I quickly say, walking towards the door, still wanting to keep her calm. “I’ll be out of your way soon. Just tell me: Which hospital is this? And where is the nearest exit?”
I could stay here possibly all day, watching John, picking up every clue there is about him, but I really should not. There are more important things I must do, like go back to that dreadful sewer. I tighten my grip onto the headlamp, reminding myself that at least now I’ll be able to see.
“All I’ll do is look up a few entries to see if a Rachel will come up,” Sherlock says, in a sweet voice that makes John do a double take. “We’ll even wire it to another screen so you can see everything I’m doing.”
John furrows his brow in confusion, still trying to elevate her head, when he catches sight of her light skirt.
“But how? How, and how did that not show up on the cameras?!”
“You don’t hate him for it?” John admired her patience and acceptance. God knew he raved and ranted any time Sherlock pushed him away.
The man laughs. “Never mind that, we’ve met already. Stamford, Mike Stamford, we were at Barts together!”
The first half of the meeting was all like that – awkward meetings and disappointed hopes. An embarrassing number of relieved people, too. John threw out optimistic leading comments about the army, his leg, and travel, and fielded generic greetings and entirely different and unhelpful comments and questions by others. A few people left straight after greeting John, while most others lingered for tea and biscuits, and small talk with either fellow Determinists or those who were bitter about being paired with one.
for an unusual introduction to each other.
“What?”
“Don’t you feel you would do better with some goals? They don’t have to be big ones, John. You don’t have to be planning for a new career. You could make a plan to buy a pot plant for your apartment, or to go for a walk twice a week. Get some exercise.”
“Of course it was! Extraordinary, quite extraordinary.”
There was a new receptionist at the desk when John limped into his therapist’s office. She was young and moderately pretty, with long brown hair tied back in a sleek bun. She tapped away at her computer and ignored him utterly. He didn’t want to take it personally, but he couldn’t help it. He had been a respected captain. A successful doctor. He was neither now. A non-entity.
“John! John Watson!”
He tried not to be insulted that she was
There was a bit of a division in the room, and when they were all seated in a circle of chairs to talk about their feelings for the second half of the support group meeting, it became more obvious. Some spoke in reverent whispers about hope, faith, and the inevitability of true love. Others were more bitter and talked about the pain and anger that came from years of fruitless waiting.
“Him! It’s him!” John said, pointing a shaking finger at Sherlock, who was still staring at John, his eyes flicking over him from head to toe as if cataloguing every detail of his appearance. “He’s the bloody one I’ve been looking for all these years!”
“Amy Smith, 11
“Any more nightmares, John?” Dr. Thompson asked.
“I think waiting for it to happen naturally is more romantic. Much more than being sent a slip of paper by a computer to meet your soulmate at a Coming of Age Ball when the youngest in the pair turns eighteen,” an older woman insisted. “I adore the
“Well, I’m not most people.”
“Having a mild disability doesn’t make you incapable of exercising, John. Getting out and about will do you good.”
“How do you feel about the violin? Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end, will that bother you? Future flatmates and partners should know the worst about each other.”
“Was your soulmate in Afghanistan, John? Was it the man whose life you couldn’t save?” Her voice was laden with genuine sympathy, and it made John open up to her a little, since she wasn’t judging him for the possibility that his match might have been a bloke in the army. He hated homophobes not just for his sister’s sake, but because he himself was bisexual. That was a fact he shared with very few and he hadn’t told his therapist he sometimes fancied blokes, but maybe she’d guessed on her own. Sometimes people did, even though he wasn’t sure what gave his sexuality away. Too many gender-neutral pronouns, perhaps.
“John Watson, 11
“We haven’t talked about your soulmate yet.”
“What do they usually say?”
“I haven’t met my soulmate yet,” he offered up. He doesn’t want her thinking he was traumatised by soul shock from his match’s death, that wouldn’t be right. Apart from it being rude to leave her suffering from a false assumption, she’d waste both their times trying to treat him for a psychological condition he didn’t have.
Sherlock’s gaze flicked down to his own dark leather band that peeked out from under the cuff of his shirt. “Better than going around your entire life knowing you will endanger your soulmate’s life and he’ll think you’re a bastard for doing so.”
“Molly, dear, you’ll never guess!” Mike said excitedly.
“Piss off.”
“That’s a lot of passion. Do you find it’s hard, John? Not knowing when you’ll meet them?”
Dr. Thompson’s bracelet was a wide band of silver, engraved with decorative swirls and inset with wavy rows of pink gems. The luxurious marker of the bonded, someone who’d met their soulmate. Well, the budget version for the middle-class, anyway. Those who could afford it bought solid gold matching bracelets, rather than silver or stainless steel.
what your soulmate was supposed to be. He hoped he would be the same for Sherlock.
No-one had said the right words to him yet, even when he’d – in his desperation – gone through a phase of introducing himself just with his name to potential matches his assigned case worker had sent him on. Usually it was quite an automated process, but for special cases you could request human intervention rather than just relying on automatically generated results.
The shy young man was next, and he raised his eyebrows in a questioning manner as he approached. John nodded and smiled encouragingly. He would prefer it if his match was a woman, but he’d dated men in the past, and certainly wouldn’t shy away if his soulmate turned out to be a man. Only the real hardcore religious nuts insisted that a same-sex match meant you were supposed to be like brothers or sisters. John thought the man was a bit young for him, perhaps in his early twenties, and his skinny coltishness wasn’t especially appealing, but his green eyes were gorgeous. He’d give it a shot.
Mike looked between the two of them, puzzled. “I know Sherlock’s a Determinist, but what are you up to, John, breaking with tradition like that? You’ve never done that before?”
of July 2010, London,” she said brightly, and John’s heart sank. “Sorry, I know that was unusual, and a little awkward. My match is a Determinist, you see. There’ll be no helpful introduction for me. His first words don’t have any self-identification in them at all.”
A few people came up towards him instantly – a few women and one shy young man formed a bit of a line, each waiting for their turn to greet him.
to anyone, because Mycroft made them sign nondisclosure agreements. He felt bad leaving his readership high and dry after they’d followed him for months on the journey. He’d have to find a way to sneak it in at some point …
Has Sherlock inched closer? John can feel his warmth through their layers of clothes and the small amount of air between their two bodies.
a silly conspiracy.”
to be related. You can’t deny it, Sherlock.”
John jerked his head up from where he’d been staring at the floor. “What?” He studied Sherlock’s face. He was half in shadow, the only light coming from the street below. Still, John could see the half moons under his eyes, his angles sticking out in stark relief. He really needed to eat more. John had been slacking on that front lately.
Sherlock interrupted, shaking his head. “She’s seen the videos, she knew what the thing from them looked like. It isn’t out of the realm of possibility that she translated a shadow in the dark into an image she was already familiar with.”
“Whah?”
“Whatka?”
“You just sound a lot like Sherlock sometimes. It’s uncanny.”
“Four. Father Christmas, remember?”
Why is it always kids these days? Simon, Sammy, and now Katie and Kurt. Kids should be safe at home, not being terrified and used by others. Shit.
murdered.”
After the meeting with Robert, they called Maria Torres to hear her side. Her list of events matched Robert’s pretty well. Sherlock, of course, got into an argument with her about whether she was unconsciously making things up. John managed to call a cease fire.
John frowned. “I didn’t. She offered.”
He was looking at a map of South England, and he realized the route drawn in red marker was familiar to him. “Victor?”
“And let me guess. Neither of those people will be you.”
“If I don’t get a new case soon, my mind will atrophy. Section me now, John, it’ll save you time later.”
Victor’s expression fell, then became resigned. He nodded. “If I’d been able to do it another way, I would have, but they … I needed to get away. From you. To keep you safe.”
. John burrowed back under his covers and tried to escape back to dreamland for a while longer.
Mycroft doing these days?” John asked.
“I was bored.”
“Hello again, Mrs. Hudson.”
“It always is.” John leaned so their arms touched, showing his support. Sherlock leaned back.
“John?” The word brought him out of his musings, and he stood. Usually when Sherlock was ready to leave, or annoyed, or both, he barked John’s name, ordering him to ‘come along,’ but his name this time sounded tentative, questioning. John looked at his friend, still standing a few feet away. He looked … vulnerable. Worried. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, his fingers played with the cuffs of his coat, his brow creased.
“Maths,” Sherlock murmured, looking thoughtful.
“We need you to go home,” said Sherlock.
“Okay,
Sherlock glanced at him, then took the proffered mug. “Oh, nothing. Just …”
“I’ve got a date,” he replied.
Sherlock huffed. “You’re being enigmatic on purpose.”
“I want to help! My brother is in trouble with some really weird stuff. Mycroft has apparently fucked off on the whole thing, which leaves me. You may not want a third Holmes sibling, but you damn sure are getting one. You need me.”
“You wrote about Victor?!?”
Was it odd, the way Sherlock kept inviting him along to eat? John shrugged to himself. He
“John?”
“Well I like urban legends, so I wanna do this one.”
He ran to the center stone. He had mere seconds to remember what Simon’s email had said.
“Not your normal processing pain through art, I’m guessing?”
Holmes—Sherlock—settled into his chair and crossed one leg over the other. “Sometimes. Sometimes all I need to do is hear a story or see a recording to deduce the answer. But if necessary, I do visit the site. And yes, usually it doesn’t take long to find the truth.”
Sherlock hesitated a moment. “Yes, well–”
John raised an eyebrow.
“The whole thing is asinine.”
Robert’s face tightened. “She said she saw someone standing over his bed, Sammy's bed. Someone … someone very tall and very thin, his head almost touched the ceiling. She screamed, and then turned on the light to get a better look, and it disappeared.”
Sherlock looked at his mug.
“Yeah.” John sighed. “I didn’t mean … I never meant to do that to him. This all started out as a fluff piece, but it turned out to be far more complex than I expected. Than even he expected, I think.”
Holmes nodded to the pocket where John’s phone rested. “May I see it?”
“What?”
“And what do you believe, John?” Sherlock squinted at John through the gloom.
Sherlock fidgeted next to John. “I have no memory of somnambulism.”
“The tall men.”
“It’s good to see you, Sherlock. I missed you.”
Sherlock waved a dismissive hand. “To an extent. That many coincidences
Luckily, I’ve made some new acquaintances since I started writing this blog series, and I moved into a new flat within twenty minutes of seeing the old one burn. This is where the full disclosure comes in. My new flatmate is one Sherlock Holmes. Yes, that Sherlock Holmes, the one I wrote about in my last post (as if there could be anyone else with that name). He happened to be dropping me off when we saw the burning building, and he offered the spare room at his. He’d been looking for a flatmate anyway, and I wasn’t about to turn down cheap rent in Central London, so I agreed to move in. So now you know. On with the actual case.
“On?”
“The whispering?”
Though Sherlock was finally convinced it was worth looking into, he wasn’t ready to put his own time into what could be another dead end, so he sent John out to do the legwork. He interviewed Wendy in Germany, learned that along with the shadows and symbol, she often heard weird noises, like a wailing cat, outside their flat. As none of their neighbors had cats and they were on the tenth floor, the sound was a mystery. She emailed the baby monitor recordings to John, who sent it off to a sound guy he knew. While he waited on answers, he called the Hochmans’ English housekeeper, Maddie, who turned out to not be a lot of help. She hadn’t heard any noises or seen anything strange, and the Hochmans seemed like a perfectly normal family.
If you made it to the end, congrats! I hope you enjoyed yourself. Thanks for reading, and happy Halloween month. 🎃👻🦇
John dropped his head back against his chair in frustration. “I think you use apophenia too often as a crutch.” He sat up straight. “What if you die in the next ten months? You listened to it when investigating this case two months back, didn’t you?”
“Possibly. Except Trent had only been in hospital for a month, and the two had never met. What reason did Trent have for blaming Simon?”
“I hate you,” was Sherlock’s sharp retort.
John raised an eyebrow. It had been dry reading, but somehow still intriguing. The man’s methods were rigorous and exact, with no room for error. But the part of John that loved a good horror story wondered if Holmes was too much of a skeptic.
“If you had died, we probably would’ve failed, and there’d be no one left to post or read your sugary nonsense.”
He warred with himself on which track to follow. His journalistic curiosity won out. If they really were to be friends, he could ask more about Sherlock’s romantic inclinations later.
High praise coming from the acerbic genius. John smiled back. “I held my own back in school. I was really good with biology—thought about medical school for a while—but I liked those maths word problems too.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Ancient Sumerian. Not exactly common knowledge. Where did you learn it?”
She laughed a little bitterly. “God, no. He hated that he could. He tried to deny it. It was only because I could read him so well that I knew. He might have gone along with the videos and the questions for my sake, but he never admitted in so many words that he could see them too. But I could tell, I saw it in his eyes, the way he’d plead with me to stop. The way his eyes would dart right to the men when they’d appear, then shy away.”
It took some effort, but I finally convinced him to let me take a look at one of his files. Unfortunately, much to Mike’s chagrin, this story will take far too many words to tell, and I’m limited on space. Somehow. On the internet … Fortunately, Mike’s agreed to let me expand this into next week’s post. And the one after that. We’ll see how long I can keep this up, but given the number of scarlet files and my own journalistic curiosity, I think I can stretch this out pretty far. Thank God.
John headed for the kitchen with a shrug. “I don’t know that we have much of a choice. Eurus is an adult. We can’t really stop her.”
Therapy and far too many evenings alone with only his own mind to entertain him have forced him to admit his feelings for Sherlock, so he knows the love part won’t be a problem. But what about the domestic bits, the everyday? They wouldn’t be able to have late-night chases and adrenalin-fueled cases, so it wouldn’t be like before. Could he handle that? Or is it better for him to suffer alone in the suburbs, and not let things sour between him and Sherlock when the domestic life keeps them from what they need to feel alive?
her.”
“Hmmm.” Sherlock went back to studying the symbols as he absentmindedly ate another bite. “Ancient Sumerian?” he mumbled.
Sherlock paused to look at him, then nodded. “Good night, John.”
“Want to see some more?”
The case John (briefly) refers to in his post is taken from episode
Concentrate, Holmes. Play the song.
John raised an eyebrow. “What about Eurus?”
The two men avoided looking at each other. The L word hadn’t been uttered yet, though they both knew that’s what it was. It felt safer, though, not saying it quite yet.
“Right. He was four at the time. After Mr. Holmes left, the things that used to happen to me started happening to him. First time I remember it happening was around eleven at night. Maria and I were watching TV. She went to check on Sammy, and I heard her scream. I ran in, I saw her holding onto Sammy, and he was crying.”
He almost walked out a second time when he interviewed his first subject, a woman who had written dozens of books on the paranormal (and some erotica he’d rather have been left in the dark about). She invited him along on a case to investigate a haunting. He didn’t know what the truth was concerning the supposed event, but he knew the answer wasn’t little ghosties. It was a colossal waste of time, and Mike would be getting an earful from him as soon as he made it back to the office.
