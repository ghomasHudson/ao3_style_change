“Again.” Sherlock whispers, the specks of silver in his blue eyes glimmering with seduction, begging John to go again. This time harder, faster, and as many times as John wants.
"My th'irt i'th th'tuck to me," he whinged before his head even hit the pillow.
Jawn looked up from where he’d been licking currant sauce out of the cup. “Yea, b’yus’ tee’f.”
"We ha'b choc'ate cereal?"
"Keep looking, Gregory." Mycroft said around the bobby-pin in his mouth. He'd parted Mollys' hair and twisted elegantly.
"Fros'ing?"
"Owwww'sh. Hur'ds."
"I know...and that's why Uncle Greg is getting fat," Greg said as he picked up the hair-washing cup, much to Sherlock's chagrin.
Mycroft gave the little doctor a squeeze. “Why don’t you go first, Sherlock.”
Sherlock and Jawn looked at each other; the thought had never crossed their mind before. Whomever was Big and in charge at bathtime simply left any toys played with in the tub to dry overnight.
“How would you help someone wet a nappy…wait never mind. There are some things I’d prefer not to know.”
The little doctor looked up from his spot on the floor. He’d gotten his lace ups on the correct feet and mostly tied. "G'een," he mumbled around the dummy that had been in Sherlock’s mouth moments ago.
Mycroft was in the midst of cleaning Sherlock up when Jawn flopped down onto the top half of the bed with a wad of blue and green fabric bunched up in his hands. Sherlock squealed and reached for him while trying to roll over, giggling. “Hi, Jawn!”
“Language,” Jawn said absently, his face scrunched in concentration. “Couldn’t we change each other?”
"Yeah, the yellow ones."
“That’s right, Peter was the fourth little rabbit. And they all lived with their mother in a sand bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree.” Mycroft paused, and looked down at the boys…
"Hello sweet boy," Greg cooed as he pulled Sherlock's bib off over his head, then lifted him out of his chair. Sherlock snuffled and stretched, then curled around Greg and laid his head on his shoulder.
Mycroft gave him a questioning look.
“MY!”
He leans in and claims Sherlock’s mouth as he begins to pump slowly. He feels Sherlock touch his sides tentatively, and pulls back to stare into huge inquisitive eyes.
Greg gave a small cough. "Uh, yeah. Said we'd find it on Netflix."
"I c'n do'id!!" Sherlock said as he turned away from Greg and went to open the oven.
Mycroft kept one eyebrow raised. ‘Stroppy little piss-gremlin,’ he thought to himself, but as long as Sherlock was giggling and not wailing, he let it slide. He wiped his little brother clean quickly, then powdered and nappied him up before either of the two noticed he was done.
Sherlock wrinkles his nose and kisses Daddy’s jaw.
"Bax'er n' Pea'nud are peo'ble?" Sherlock asked around a mouth full of Pad Thai.
"N'nn n'nn n'nn," Sherlock grunted as he looped his fingers in his own hair, and tugged.
“I wa’sh doin’ a goo’ y’ob, My’coff.”
“Sou’b, pas’a, Ho’d dogs!”
“Ni’ni, Shhh’lo’g,” Jawn slurred around the dummy he’d secreted in the pocket of his jams. He wiggled a bit, until he was pressed flush against Mycrofts' side from chest to toe.
"Yes, but what kind?"
“Thought you knew everything,” Sherlock pouted, then tried to brush Mycroft’s fingers away. “I can do that part!” he announced, wanting to prove that he could indeed do his own buttons after failing with his trousers.
“Noooooooooo,” they both chimed in unison, and Jawn sat up; “We’re sor’ree.”
Daddy. Was. Pissed.
"No. Try again."
Sherlock poked his head inside, curls seeming to wilt immediately. “D'is b’ery haw’d.”
"Yeah, I know, but--"
"I y'ike tha'd par'd."
"Soon. We have to add flour and milk first."
of grass down the front of your nappy?!?!" Greg sat back and stared. Every inch of damp skin was coated in grass clippings.
"Well, doctors don't actually bind broken ribs anymore, because they want you to be able to breathe deeply," Molly said, taking a small penlight from her bag. "BUT, if it gets really painful, you can use one of those, what'cha'call'em, ace bandages and wrap him in that. Just keep it to a half-hour at a time, then take it off and let him breathe."
"Pie'apple." Jawn leaned heavily on Greg's shoulder, his eyes mostly closed. "I y'ike it."
Greg held it to his eye backwards; "I don't see nothing."
Greg sighed. "Yeah...yeah, you can. C'mere, sweetheart...let's give your hands and face a quick wash."
"Just bring up a tin of biscuits and the bottle of milk in the refrigerator. The ice bucket should be down here, so just use that."
"It'll be a while before they change colors. Perhaps by breakfast time tomorrow."
"I don't think Jawn or your Uncle Gregory are that adventurous." Mycroft kissed Sherlock's clammy forehead. "...What about pizza? You both like that, don't you?" Sherlock sniffed and nodded.
"Now. I know I didn't put them there..."
kiss, understand?"
“Jawn can carry the umbrella, then. Let’s get you two home before the flood gates open.”
"I dun' wan wake him. Jawn nee's s'eep." Sherlock whispered back, hurt making his voice wobble.
Mycroft took the umbrella from the little boy who promptly twisted away from Sherlock and reached for it. "Mine!”
"Yes! They looked around to see who had spoken, when the tiniest little fairy slipped out of one of the flowers that Billy held.
Mycroft turned to glare at Jawn, but softened when he saw his hopeful little face. He knew enough about Jawn’s past to hold his temper.
"My'cobb!" He chirped, getting out of his seat to go and greet Mycroft with a hug. "G'eg say'd we c'an ma'ge fairy houses!"
"Maybe I'll suggest it." Greg taped up the plush nappy; "If you must wear jams, which ones would you prefer?"
2. Leave us comments about what mischief you want Sherlock and Jawnhog to get into.
"My'cob." Sherlock went to him willingly, and and clung to him just as tightly as he'd clung to Greg.
"Bee-bee-bee, bay-bee," Sherlock sang, keeping himself occupied while his brother got out the baby lotion, powder, and one of the lavender nappies.
Sherlock turned his face into Mycroft's collar. "F'wogs."
"G'eg'ry. We nee' choco'yate."
"I am putting you down," Greg said, and deposited Sherlock's bum into his booster seat.
"I can give you some that's not covered in frosting, darling."
"In a manner of speaking." Mycroft handed the little bottle of red drops to Sherlock. "Just two red drops, and we'll see what that gives us."
"Yea. Theys j'ooce and cu'bca'ges and s'umtimes moo'sics."
Sherlock toddled over, his cup held tightly in both hands...as soon as he was close enough, Greg pulled him into his lap. "I'm not mad at you," he said again, and kissed his cheek.
"Good, we'll go get those first." Greg kissed Sherlock's forehead. "Or do you want to wait here while I go get them?"
"Ice sc'eam?"
Sherlock crunched the third egg with a satisfied sigh. "One mo'."
"You're not???" Greg reached for a flannel. "Then, who's the baby I made a fairy house with??"
"Is it something living?"
"Ohhhhh. Does he know that Molly can always come back and play with him whenever she wants?"
Sherlock giggled and reached out to touch Jawn’s exposed teeth. Before Mycroft could intercede,the little doctor nipped gently at Sherlock’s fingers, causing the little detective to squeak in delight. “Jawn have nice tee'fs.”
"He's not the only one who needs a change."
Greg shuffled in place; "Think I found your dummy."
"Here..." Mycroft sat down in the chair on Sherlock's opposite side, and picked up his fork. "Is it okay if I help?" he asked, taking the plastic fork and twirling noodles around it.
"They decided to stop and pick a big bunch of them, as many as they could carry, to take back home to Billy's mummy."
"Smart-arse. I'll meet you both outside."
“Jawn really likes green, hmm? Is that why he wants mint ice cream?” Mycroft shook them out as best he could, but there were still horrid-looking creases in them...he sighed and held them down for the smaller man to step into, anyway.
"No."
He forced his eyes open, and waited for them to adjust to the darkness of the room.
Mycroft sighed, and wondered if he could get away with just staying where he was. He slowly washed his hands and adjusted his waist coat while listening to the intense squabbling in the sitting room. He was actually surprised it had taken this long for a fight to break out, since ‘sibling’ rivalry had been the theme of the day. Steeling himself, he opened the bathroom door and made his way into the sitting room.
"When Maw'yee come ba'g?" Sherlock asked as he toddled after Greg.
John gives Sherlock's cock a final few strokes before leaving off. The boy beneath him makes a desperate mewling sound as his now full cock slaps against the mess on his belly. John slides between Sherlock's still invitingly open thighs. He takes a moment to survey the scene below him as he strips off his pants. His little boy looks debauched; sweaty, flushed, and trembling. His pupils blown wide, leaving only a thin band of silver. Hard cock laying in the mess he'd made a few minutes ago.
"I jus' w-wanna."
"C'ause you're gonna get plenty of fluids today, little boy. You need'em."
"Why didn't I know that?!"
Greg nudged him with his knee. "Just pick a show with a lot of episodes to binge, you twat."
"I y'ike Maw'yee hair," Sherlock agreed, reaching back into the box of jewelry and putting his rings back on his fingers.
Sherlock sighed...fussing had taken a lot out of him, and his energy was already starting to drag. "Cer'al?" he asked, and opened his mouth for the next bite.
Greg peered at him through the darkness. "Myc."
Mycroft refolded the nappy that he'd pulled out and put it back in the stack below the table.
“I wan’ my whistle,” Jawn grumbled again, but walked over to the prize bucket anyway.
“Fantastic. It’s not even suppertime and we’re well on our way,” Mycroft said, false cheer hanging from every word as he headed down the hallway towards the unmistakable sound of the water running in the bathtub.
Mycroft snorted; “He’ll need to sit on a block of ice to find 'cool' once I’m done with him.”
“Hullo Mycroft, Sherlock is going to take a nap so he’ll have to chat with you later. Thanks so much again for the tickets to the zoo, we really had a lovely time.” John said giving Sherlock’s bottom a meaningful pat. “Ta’, good day then.”
“Yea. But he can’t have mines,” Jawn said with a decisive nod before putting the whistle back in his mouth and taking a deep breath--
"Sally poked her head out of his pocket. 'Don't stand there sniveling, you little homewrecker!' she said, then hollered at the squirrel. 'You there!...You, yes, you! Nutcracker!'"
“Yea.” Jawn nodded before turning back to the film.
"B'eakfas'," Sherlock peeped from the floor.
"Boo'tiful."
"Sorry Pet. Daddy is exhausted. Neither of us has been sleeping well, and I know you don't feel tired but you need the rest." John runs his fingers over Sherlock's cheek before cupping his face. Sherlock turns into the touch, nestling against John's palm.
"I don't need anyone to watch me bathe either, darling."
"Bring his medication as well."
"Mon'gey s'yippers?"
"Well,
"Oh, baby." Greg pulled him into the promised hug, squeezing him tight but quick. "We'll figure that out later. We need to take Jawn to a doctor. Can you be my best boy and help me."
"Right. 'I think we shall go to the pond and skip stones-"
“Perhaps I should teach you how to savor your treats.” John was laughing as he put the cupcakes in the icebox. “Alright messy boy, into the tub with you.”
"Apple juice, got it. Go with Gregory and get ready for your bath, and I'll bring it up."
"Why not?"
"Clever. What do you want for supper?"
"Did you have good sleep? Do you need a fresh nappy?" Greg scooped him up and carried him to the changing table.
Sherlock sat up and held his arms out in a big circle.
"G'eeeeeeeg! Faeries nee' a hooooouuuuse!"
Sherlock's shoulders slumped; "I y'ike d'is par'd."
"I'm-" A warm hand on the nape of his neck made him falter, his headspace a jumbled mess. "Med'cine."
"You say'ed it firs'."
Sherlock nodded as he chewed, his cheeks pouched out like a little chipmunk.
“Where are you going?” Sherlock asked as he pulled the bin of changing supplies from under the bed.
Though it was against his better judgement, Mycroft returned to the counter to get his lone cup of rose with toffee bits and realized that the young woman had been watching them while pretending not to be, and failing. She handed him his cup and, looking over his shoulder, grinned.
"The only person in this room throwing anything is you." Mycroft quipped, and put his hands firmly on Jawn's shoulders.
"Snuggle, G'eg?"
Mycroft gingerly picked it up and blew across the top. "We could even go grape-picking," he said, taking a small sip. "Hm...sugar, please."
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. "Tea with extra milk, of course."
"You plan to relapse?"
"No, no, I don' wan'nid!" Sherlock started to cry as he lay there...he wasn't actively fighting a change, but he wasn't helping, either.
“Yes, a very thorough talking to about cleanliness,” Mycroft cooed, tickling Sherlock’s naked belly. “Pick an outfit, Jawn, or I’ll pick one for you.”
“I’ll make him stop,” Mycroft promised…if only to avoid another blowout so soon. How on earth these two made it together this long without killing each other was a genuine mystery.
“You are both going to be very disappointed when you finally realize…”
He would have to plan a different attire, should he ever decide to attempt this ever again.
"Can'd ha'b bubbas. I was ba'," Sherlock said, his broken heart apparent in his voice.
Sherlock looked up at him and frowned. "Bu'd..."
Sherlock stayed on his hands and knees, looking over all the pretty white blooms in front of him. Mycroft said to pick the prettiest ones...but how could he do that, when they were
Greg watched Mycroft shimmy into the green dress. "This is not okay."
Now it was Mycroft’s turn to glare at him. He had no choice; it was time to use the last resort, the ultimate weapon. He looked down at Sherlock, who was holding him tightly around the waist and hiding his face against his big brother’s arm; “...You’re scaring the baby.”
"No'd ea'd me."
"Oh," Sherlock pouted. "I wan' 'em on now," he said, and tried to shove his ring-covered fingers into the opera gloves...which, of course, quickly became stuck. "Oh no!"
"I'm no'd as'ging for mu'ppins."
"Hmm?"
“What flavour?"
so pretty and sweet-smelling?
Sherlock watched with unbridled envy; “I never get to hold it!”
"A'h Mo-an'ah!"
Mycroft’s hard expression fell. Popular opinion to contrary, he really wasn’t a brute. “It’s alright. But I need you to listen to me.”
"I s'ay wif G'eg," Sherlock told the floor, his face half hidden in his bunny.
"Toge'ver," Sherlock agreed, a handful of blueberries already in his mouth.
"Bu' I'm hung'gy," Sherlock whinged.
Jawn sat up and patted the water; " 'mon’ Sher'yock!”
"The batter is. Let Greg wash your hands, and we can pour them in the muffin tins," Mycroft said, and turned the mixer off.
“No, they don’t…every crew needs a captain." Mycroft kept his eye glued to the signal across the street, silently calling it every name in the book while willing it to change. He kept his arm around Sherlock’s waist, underneath his coat, and alternated between patting and rubbing the small of his back.
"Adorable."
Sherlock's eyes brightened a touch. "Maw'yee sd'ay?" he babbled, right before Greg stuck the spoon in his mouth again.
Bollocks.
“Oh no, no, no,” John scolds, moving into position on the bed. “Your punishment isn’t over yet little man.”
"I y'ike hel'bing."
"I will! Cause I dun wan' you gross p'ingers on my f'wogs!"
Sherlock flushes the toilet eagerly. “In the southern hemisphere the water goes down the other way round.” John just nods as he helps Sherlock wash his hands before ushering him back into the bedroom.
"P'ease, p'ease, p'ease..." Jawn let Greg nudge him out of the way of the bars, but the second they were down he was right there, trying to climb Greg's front.
"Hand him to me, Gregory."
Letting Sherlock rest, he reaches down to take the silicone cup off of his boy's cock. His flaccid cock slips out, wet with lube and cum. Another moan from the boy and he tries to curl up into John’s lap.
“Apologies, Captain." Mycroft finished spreading the creme on Jawn’s bits and then wiped what was left on his fingers on the inside of the new nappy. “Lift up," he added, but before the little doctor could obey, Mycroft had scooped his arm behind his right knee and lifted his bum off the bed.
That…was a mistake. Because now that his thumb was in his mouth…he didn’t want to take it out.
"Baby-"
"Y'ook at d'is s'uff, isn' i'd neat?" Sherlock crooned to himself.
Jawn giggled and reached up with his wet, grungy hands, waiting to be picked up.
"Wait 'til we add the vanilla extract."
Mycroft smiled softly at Jawn. “It’s a lovely song. I’m glad we both know it.”
"That's right. It was naughty to go against Brothers wishes."
"I know," Mycroft tutted, still petting. "But guess what? We're going to have a visitor coming soon, and we need to get ready."
"Y'ove, y'ove, y'ove, G'eg'ry 'estraD!!" Jawn singsonged.
"Yessss," Mycroft gave Greg a smirk; "I know."
Sherlock’s pout returned. “B-but, but I…!”
"It's quite clear what you want, little boy." John's voice is cool as he moves toward the bed. Sherlock tries to lean up and pull out of the toy but John's hand between his shoulder blades holds him in place as John tsks at him. "Might as well finish up little boy. And enjoy it, because this is the last time you get to cum for quite some time."
“Bribery is the key to good behavior, isn’t it,” Mycroft said thoughtfully.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Bring it here and I'll help," Mycroft said, setting his tea aside.
"I'm not shouting, I'm stating!"
"I see. You can keep your treasures sweetheart, but next time ask before you add to your collection, hm?"
"Jawn falled." Sherlock whispered. Mycroft intercepted his hand before his thumb could get to his mouth. Mycroft held it in his lap and patted it. "My faul'."
“Lots of things…” A lightbulb went off in Mycroft’s head; "…like we need Captain Jawn Green to lead us home!”
"Myc! He's got half the yard stuck to'im already!"
John cleared his throat before he began to dump the beakers of water into the sink. "Right then, we'll do this the hard way."
"Oh."
"You do understand that they are adults most...some of the time? We don't get much say in how things are when they aren't with us."
“What are you going to draw, Jawn?” Mycroft sat on the sofa and pulled a sheet of paper from the stack.
Sherlock looked up at him tearfully. “Th’ whi’thle was gonna be my first pick…I haven’t even gotten a prize since we filled it up last time!”
“If you’d like, you can pick a different prize until the next time you play outside.”
"Quite right. It's nap time."
"He called and texted me as well." Mycroft slid his phone across the table, the screen unlocked. "Last night."
Mycroft gave a small, sad smile; "I know."
"Just pick a handful of them, and anything else you think we need for our fairy houses."
"It's Sherlocks' bunny. If he says Baxter quacks, then who am I to tell him different?"
Jawn scrubbed at his cheek with his free hand. “Will not.”
"I'm no'd forge'd jus' a'cause morning."
"Buuuuu'd, G'eeeeeeg. I neeeeee My'cobb," Sherlock whinged, reluctantly crawling back up the bed to lay next to Greg.
Mycroft stared at the wet spot on his shirt for a moment, eyebrow nearly in his hairline. He knew his reaction would make the rest of the evening; “... Jawn has terrible aim.”
"You're lucky the baby's between us, or I'd kick you."
Mycroft put his hand on Sherlock's lower belly and gently pushed him back down. "Relax," he repeated.
“No shouting,” Sherlock whimpered.
Sherlock and Jawn shared another look, then began reaching for their prospective ducks in earnest, with a chorus of “Me! Me first! No, I’M first! Nu-uh, me!”
“But I take'd one aw’ready,” Sherlock said as he placed his dishes in the sink and turned the faucet on them.
"‘Mato?” Jawn stared at his arm critically before licking some of the sauce off. “I’m a'licious!”
"And since it was just your birthday, it would make sense to cover your birthday cupcakes in candles."
"Bu'd I wan' go, too," Sherlock said, looking fretful as he watched his brother leave the room while Greg held him in his lap.
"This is, it's..." Sherlock was at a loss for words.
“We’ve been having a hard time with that last bed time rule this evening haven’t we?” There’s a small nod from the little detective. “And that’s alright, it’s a tough one to follow I know. But this is going to be your last warning, alright love? You’ve had a drink, you’ve been to the loo, and you’ve had three tuck ins. So the next time you’re out of bed there’ll be a smacked bottom in it for you. Do you understand?”
“There’s my good boy. Doing such a good job eating his dinner.”
"H-hh-halp." Sherlock nodded.
"I taked a ba'ff so I dun nee' wash han's."
Arecently smacked bottom kept Sherlock from doing more than pout around his thumb as Jawn babbled happily. “C'ute baby. My'coff. My baby a c'ute baby,” Jawn crooned, gently rubbing Sherlock’s hitching chest as if hiccuping was the greatest, most clever thing Sherlock had ever done.
"I know. "
"Yes! Sherlock, d'yah want g'yoves, too!?" Molly dove back in.
"Fine," Greg muttered. "FINE."
Mycroft rolled his eyes. "Fine, what part did you start 'listening'?"
Sherlock's eyes widen. "Wha'deber I wan'?"
"Real pirates can still learn from watching other pirates, but fine…you can pick what to watch.”
Mycroft glanced up at him; "After they scolded him for running off and got him dried, they took Sally back home and found a flower in Mummy's garden for her."
’ Mycroft thought. He strode over to the pair, fully anticipating the moment when Sherlock would burst into tears (and he couldn’t really blame him this time; that jab had looked hard from all the way across the room!), when the overgrown tyke surprised both of them by dissolving in huge, gut-busting belly laughs. “ ‘gain! ‘gain!” he chanted, moving his hands out of the way and Jawn, grinning like the Joker in a pack of cards, poked him again.
"Buy mer'mai?"
“You were here to see
“Bubba’s, Jawn.” Sherlock showed him the tiny bottle with a watery smile, eager to make friends again.
Mycroft opened his mouth to be snide, and found himself with a mouth full of biscuit.
Jawn beamed, proud as all get out. "Uh-huh!"
"Oh."
“What?”
"Did you're friends enjoy their cake?"
“Yes, you do.”
"I have soup in my tum, wish you would have some."
P.S.  Dicks
“Nooooooo hat!” Sherlock cried, covering his head with his hands.
"It makes you very sleepy," Greg admitted. He added a squirt of baby shampoo to Sherlock's hair and worked it into a lather, careful of the stitches that were hidden in his hairline.
"Yes," Mycroft went to the dresser and pulled out two pairs of bee pajamas; one a soft, grey and white striped fleece sleeper that zipped up the front, and the other a white onesie with a gold-foil bee on the chest, in front of a honeycomb-pattern background. "This one--" he shook one pair; "--or this one," he asked, shaking the other set.
"Doesn't everybody?"
“Shhhh.” Mycroft slid it between Jawn’s parted legs. “I know it hurts, but you’re not going around naked, little boy…I won’t be cleaning up any mystery puddles.”
“My’coff eat?”
"Shhh, I know better than to believe that...Billy-boy."
"Nuh-uh. G'eg'ry fibbin'!"
“Thank God. Sherlock, please pick that up for me?” Mycroft put two pots on the stove top and started the sauce. One didn’t get a reputation for being chubby without knowing how to cook.
“You’re not gonna–!”
like. C'mon, sit down and think about what else you like; what about...puppies? You like puppies lots, don't you?"
“I did come here to see you.” Mycroft closed his arm around the little detective’s frail shoulders. “And I came to see Jawn, too…that was the plan.”
"Ye'yyow."
"Good of ya," Greg reclined on the bed, hands behind his head; "Is it a piece of furniture?"
Now that Sherlock was starting to calm down, Mycroft turned and gathered a dry nappy, powder, and a simple soft, baby-blue cotton shirt to change him into.
"Yes, I know. You forgot you elbow hurts."
“I d'aw pish?” Sherlock slurred around his thumb.
“It doesn’t have to change anything. They can have this and still go to the pub.”
Jawn frowned. “I f’ing so,” he said, and closed his eyes. “Yea’, I can.”
Greg and Mycroft looked at each other, and Mycroft mimed covering his ears.
"I was in a rush, in case you've forgotten!"
"Language."
“Rabbit food," Sherlock whispered into his own ice cream that he was stirring into a soup.
He held it up, and the notifications on his lockscreen showed two text messages...from John.
“My'coff say 'no'."
"Jawn chew 'em. I ha'b to sa'be 'em."
"S'oppi'd, G'eg! Tha'd hur'ds!"
Jawn immediately dropped onto the floor next to him and snuggled him close. "Lemme see it quick," he said, and tugged gently on Sherlock’s foot. The little boy whinged but allowed Jawn to pull his toe from his mouth and examine it.
“This way men! We’re 40 leagues from shore!” Jawn turned and marched across the street, heading for Baker Street.
"No, Myc. 'M sorry."
"Yellow, of course." Mycroft slipped the top loop over Sherlock's head, then stepped behind him tied the straps into a very loose bow. "Go choose your seat," he said with a kiss to Sherlock's cheek. "Where's your bottle?"
"Great. When he's big he'll forget 'Greg' but he'll remember 'mud'," Greg scrubbed a hand over his face.
"Dir'd."
Sherlock had his thumb in his mouth and he leaned forward to link pinkies with Greg, giggling when their hand shake waggled his head. "Dea'yl. We can wa'sh mo'bie."
He doesn’t understand why he feels more alone now, than when he did while he was abroad. It’s too big a concept to deal with; his mind, usually blissfully quiet after a session, feels crowded in on all sides instead. So he crawls under the covers, still only half clothed.
“Still should’na done it.”
"Bu'd I din'nah ge'dda pu'd g'yitter on i'd," Sherlock sniffled and rubbed the drips of water from his hair away from his face.
"I know, you were going to help, but I need you to listen." Greg carried Jawn past him, then set him on his feet while he opened the car door and bundled him in. "Climb in, Sherlock."
"Back to him already?" Mycroft asked, snidely...which, part of him knew that was cruel, that that was a hit well below the belt by the way Sherlock stopped still in his tracks and stiffened, but...Mycroft felt helpless. And when he felt helpless, he lashed out. He had that much in common with his little brother, he knew.
" from his dummy as it bobbed in his mouth.
“See, you can be sweet and well-behaved.” Mycroft’s hand continued to thunk against Jawn’s nappy; “…when you want to be.”
"Hm?" Greg grunted...he'd nearly fallen asleep in the short interim.
"No Pet, you didn't do it wrong. It's perfect. The most wonderful valentine I've ever received." John murmured as he pulled Sherlock to his chest, peppering his face with kisses until the detective was squealing with giggles.
"That's not why he fell, Sherlock." Mycroft gave his hand a squeeze, then reached for the small box of tissues that every table had and plucked one out. "Jawn is going to be fine, and that's because of you," Mycroft said as he dabbed his little brother's cheeks.
"What was this rule right here again?" John asked pointedly, pen tapping the rule on the page.
"Yeah, they could cut a plea deal." Greg walked over and sat down next to Sherlock, then took one of his hands. "They could get a reduced sentence of half a cupcake each," he said, and started to wipe him clean.
“Baf'room!” Jawn chirped, leaning in to lick Sherlock’s nose instead of poke it. “Boop.”
"See, I am fun."
Greg tried not to wince at the glare Mycroft sent in his direction, aware that less than two weeks ago he'd had an ugly moment of frustration and grumbled about Mycroft not being able to control the boys. "Sit down, love. I'll make you a cuppa and we'll figure out our next step."
“Yes, Daddy. I understand.”
Jawn stared at Sherlock, wide eyed before gently picking up the crayon and cradling it to his chest. He licked his lips and began; “If I had words to make a day for you…” Jawn paused to glance nervously at Mycroft before going on. “I’d sing you a morning, golden and true.”
Sherlock did one of John’s rage sniffs, throwing the onesie onto the sofa and pulling a horribly wrinkled dressing gown from between it’s cushions. “I’m not little anymore, I’ll speak however I please.” He wrapped himself in the silk and then flopped down.
"E'ben sk'aree?"
“Lie down please.”
"Y'ah. P'ease." The little bugger looked worn out.
Sherlock nodded, keeping his eyes on Mycroft's every movement. "Pow'er."
"What did Daddy tell you would happen if you got out of bed again?"
"Owww'sh," Sherlock agreed.
Greg waited until John had gone down the stairs and out the front door to stand up, the baby clinging like a barnacle. He hadn't trusted himself not to react physically to the man.
"That's a wonderful idea. Can Gregory bring the play-doh to the table, please?"
"I know that. But they fixed it, didn't they."
"And our Sherlock can never do things the easy way, can he?"
"...My'cobb?"
"Every'fing."
Jawn scooted up onto his knees and pressed himself along Mycroft’s side, “Yea! Love, My'coff.” He pressed his blanket covered lips to Mycroft’s temple, making a loud smacking noise.
"Assi'den'."
"Jawn has broken his elbow. They are taking him for X-rays so they can set the bone."
"N'nnn!"
Sherlock gave him a shy smile. “Sounds perfect, Daddy.”
"Oh." The little doctor was quiet for a moment; "I dun' care if hur'ded. I wan' s'eep wif Sher'yock." He nodded, decision made.
“Typical.” Mycroft smirked at the affronted look on Sherlock’s face. “Come here now, Jawn, and it'lll be over quickly. Then we can have lunch.”
“It’s not a cage, Sherlock. You can get out of it. I know for a fact you’re going to climb out of it eventually…” John put a loud kiss on Sherlock’s forehead to stall his protest. “We’ll deal with that when it comes. And we’ve talked about this; this is only a trial run. If we try the crib for a while, and you absolutely hate it, we’ll get rid of it. No harm, no foul.”
“Yes, just this once.” This was a mistake, Mycroft could tell by the leer that flashed across the little doctor’s face. Sherlock daintily picked up a single noodle and ate it...in the same instant both of Jawn’s tiny fists where buried in pasta as he squawked in delight.
"Hmm?"
“Fry!”
By the time Sherlock reaches the landing John has stripped his coat and his cardigan and is rolling up the sleeves on his button up. “Trousers and pants off; kneel on the sofa.” It’s the first time John has spoken to him since the tube station. Sherlock notes something odd about his voice, but is too busy staring at the golden skin being bared inch by inch to pay it heed.
"Look, Sherlock..." Mycroft said, holding the cup up for him to see. "Watch it mix."
“Yea. But he was tricked and is sad. So it’s kinda not his fault,” Jawn said, eyes glued to the screen as he fiddled with the sippy cup Mycroft had put in his hands
Greg set a glass next to Mycroft's plate. "It's true. You and I are heathens for using our fingers," he told the little detective, who was three knuckles deep in applesauce, drowning a bite of chicken.
"No. I mean. Can't we do it like this? I feel very big."
“Now let’s see…where did you used to hide them…” He reached down to pull off the little detective’s shoes and called out to Jawn, in case he was still listening; “Try looking in the battery casings of your toys.”
“Jawn gots good manners!” Sherlock took down a plate covered in bees for himself and surreptitiously pulled down a plate covered in cupcakes for his My’coff. He put the plates on the table and moved to the drawer they kept the flatware in. “Jawn needs baby fork, but I can have a big boy fork?”
“Alright then Pet. Goodnight.” John drops a kiss on his forehead before moving out the door.
Sherlock was standing as close to Jawn as he could get without touching him. He whispered something into the little doctor's ear that made him giggle.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and shrugged. "I honestly have no idea, My'coff."
“The puppet needs to help, or else.”
"Wait'a'minute, I thought it was Mycroft's turn!"
John rolled his eyes and got up to fetch some juice.
Sherlock frowned; "I can't. I need room to think, and I can't do that here."
"No."
“Baby seasick?”
"G'eg turn!" Sherlock announced.
Sherlock took Greg's hand and waddled beside him, checking their route with his telescope. "O'gay. So ba'dd'ries a'morrow then?"
Sherlock looked between them, bug-eyed. "My'cobb in t'ouble?"
"Nothing. You shouldn't have done anything." Mycroft took Greg's shoulder and turned him so they were facing each other. "Sherlock would never forgive you. John is..." Mycroft trailed off. "--We're going to take care of Sherlock."
He must have dozed off, because the next thing he knew, someone was whispering his name and patting his knee.
“Qui'k y'ike bunny!” Jawn chirped, both hands buried in the prize bucket.
"Yes. Molly's suggestion made me hungry."
"Hello?"
before?!"
"He's such a crank about feeding us sweeties."
"And you did. Now it's time to sit still and eat."
"Don't say that, muffin...that's not a very nice thing to say."
"I foun' i'd!" Sherlock waved the glove over his head and hurried back to Greg.
"I want to see what it looks like."
"Moana is very clever."
Still blushing, Molly looked down at her soup, so at least she couldn't see all the eyes that were on her. "There's a party in my tummy..."
“I do’ i'd!” Jawn said, wrenching on the faucet at full blast.
“Do you have choc’ate spoons?”
"Damn. It'll be like a treasure map to the tub," Mycroft sighed.
Sherlock reached under the water and dug under his bum, pulling a wind-up fish from underneath him. "P'ish bi'de my bum!" He looked up at Greg, his mouth a perfect 'o'.
"Hush, you."
"Now they ea'd they dinner, they c'n ha'b a cu'bca'ges?" Sherlock tried for nonchalant, adjusting Peanut in her seat.
"A'cause, um, a'cause a whi'thle. An' a'cause you can ha'b tea and wa'sh ou'dside."
Sherlock immediately began to squirm and fuss, spitting out his bottle; "Up, up, up. G'eg? Nee' G'eg! G'eeeeeeeeg! Halp, G'eg!"
He chanced a glance up the stairs as he bent to retrieve the stool. Daddy was standing at the top, arms crossed, his mouth set in a narrow line.
"I won'd ge'd co'd, My'cobb!" Sherlock whinged.
"P'ease, G'eg? We wa'sh pan'a?" Sherlock blinked up at him with big, hopeful eyes and nuzzled into the crook of his neck.
"That'd make i'd easier!" Molly chirped as she scurried back with a handful of jewelry. "I did i'd!"
He didn’t know why it felt more vulnerable than just being nude, but it was.
Mycroft wiped Sherlock clean with only the most minimal fuss, as the baby's face wrinkled the moment a cold wet wipe touched him.
John pulls back the covers on the bed.
Mycroft now understood why there were people who put their children on leads. He would remember to check online if they made any in adult sizes before the next time he babysat…though, considering half the stuff Jawn and Sherlock had already found and purchased, he’d be willing to bet a large sum of money that finding a pair wouldn’t be that difficult. “Stay in sight,” he reminded.
“He thinks s’getti’o’s is pasta.” Jawn eased his bum in his chair, carefully settling GI Joe next to his plate.
"Looks like you get your wish, brother-mine." Sherlock cut them off as he rounded the counter in a rush, collecting his things as he went. "No more cupcakes for me at the moment."
Sherlock leans his head against the cool tile of the shower wall. It’d been more than a month since the incident with John's jumper and Sherlock has never in his memory been more at peace. Things are almost perfect, almost. As free as John has become with his physical affection, which Sherlock still finds disconcertingly luxurious, he’s still made no move to claim Sherlock as his lover. Taking up the bar of mandarin lemongrass soap, Sherlock rubs it across his chest viciously. Despite John's claims, Sherlock really is grateful for how well John takes care for him, but he finds himself still yearning for more. Sherlock’s tired of taking himself in hand in the privacy of his room after being arse up over John's lap or having spent the better part of the day with his head in John's lap being stroked like a tabby cat. And the detective isn’t a simpleton; he's felt John's excitement digging into his hip on more than one occasion he’s found himself over the doctor's lap. Has caught John staring at him when he thought Sherlock wasn't looking, eyes hooded, breathing slightly erratic. John wants to touch him beyond gentle pets and reprimanding smacks, but seems unwilling to take the next step. Which means it’s up to Sherlock to force the doctor's hand.
Mycroft put his empty hand on his hip. "And how many times have I 'guessed' incorrectly tonight?"
Sherlock looked down at the floor around his feet, then back up at his brother, and shrugged.
Mycroft returned with an armload of wipes, a nappy, and a washcloth.
Greg held Sherlock's hand as they slowly made their way downstairs. He tried counting the steps in a silly voice to help distract the baby, but he was too distraught.
“Nothing, never mind…go get your trousers, and I’ll help you into them.” Mycroft sat on the side of the bed as he watched Jawn pick up the horribly wrinkled garment, and wondered to himself if it was really a good idea to take them out while they were this…tiny. They could cause an even bigger scene, in an even more crowded place than some hole-in-the-wall chip shop…but on the other hand, it might take less effort to make them obedient.
"Dehydrated."
"Here, we'll figure it out." Greg moved behind Sherlock and lifted him up onto the bed, then climbed on after him. "You take your cup," he said, and handed Sherlock the sippy-cup of milk he'd brought up; "and let ole' Greg take a look."
it could be, dawned on him. There had been quite a considerable amount of thought into this present, and it showed.
Sherlock frowned. “No, I’m not.”
"Aww. We ha'b to si'd onna ste'b?"
"Yes. The swelling already looked better at dinner."
"Wha's tha'd???" Jawn whispered back.
“The more quickly I find another dummy, the more quickly we can have juice and a snuggle.” Mycroft patted the little detectives bum and found him wet. No doubt Jawn was wet too. Changing him while he was having a tantrum was going to be a nightmare.
"N-no...w-wan', wan'--"
He smiled. That was cute.
Sherlock gave him a couple of big blinks; "Y'ah. Is o'gay."
"Oh." Sherlock put his chin on Greg's shoulder. "Tha'd ma'ges me b'ery sad."
Greg carried him over, and Sherlock leaned down to grab his fuzzy yellow Pooh blanket and a stuffed bunny that lived at Mycroft's house, since both Bumble and Gladstone were back home at the flat.
"Good. Get back up on the bed."
“Boyfren s’duffs.” Jawn shrugged. Sherlock may have already known, but Greg had let slip the secret several weeks ago after having one too many pints during the football match, so it was news to him.
"We won't be having
“Perhaps another day. I think we should take Sherlock home.”
“Choc'ate?”
"Ohhhhhhh..." Greg took the tea bags from each cup and tossed them in the bin. "You're right; good call," he said, and slid Mycrofts' tea across the counter at him.
"He's not going to appreciate that very much."
Jawn did, pressing so hard that Mycroft was afraid he was going to crack his plate in half (what’s one more emotional meltdown on a day like today?), but the results were the same. The prongs on the ‘little’ forks weren’t long enough to stick through the thick pasta.
Sherlock nodded excitedly, giving little claps."Can, can do it! Red, My'coff, I nee' red!"
The boys shared a quick glance before peering back up at the man curiously. “…What kind of promise?” Jawn asked, craning his head back.
"Jawn smash a'morrow?"
"Sherlock?..."
"Chocolate will help? What am I talking about; a'course it will." Greg put their bowls on the counter, then walked Sherlock over to the pantry ans swung the door open; "Ta'daaaa!"
“Sher'yock said bad words?” Jawn gasped, staring at Mycroft with huge eyes.
"Yeeees, but which one do you want." Sherlock began to stir, and Mycroft began patting his back.
"I y'ub cu'b'ca'ges." Sherlock patted Greg's spangly wrist; "You y'ook b'ery nice."
Sherlock opened his mouth obediently, taking offered bite of salad.
Mycroft shook his head. “No, sorry lad…Jawn is getting one because he listened the first time, and cleaned up most of the mess on his own.”
"...Are you ready to apologize?”
After he made sure that G'eg had put ALL his rings back (and in the right order), Sherlock held up his arm and jiggled the bracelets together, grinning at the noise they made. He held his wrist up and shook them at his brother to show him. "Y'oud, My'cobb!"
Greg was reaching for a bib when the realization stopped him, and he sighed. "Nope, didn't think," he said, pulling the bib down over Jawn's head quickly before the little bugger could dodge it.
"Ddddaddy," he stutters as Daddy inserts another finger. Sherlock makes an undignified squeak as the fingers inside slide against his prostate
are p'etty, My'coff!" Sherlock could not seem to stress this enough, and yet his My'coff still didn't seem to get it!
The little detective huffed, blowing a wave of hair off his forehead, but stayed silent.
"We'll have him thoroughly checked over tomorrow to find our next steps. Of course his paperwork didn't have discharge instructions because he snuck out."
"We have candles."
Sherlock’s not certain, but he’s fairly sure he’s bleeding. Sherlock forcefully reminds himself that John is a doctor, and knows what he’s doing. He digs through his mind palace for memories of other times John has touched him with the back of his hand to distract himself.
"We'll see what we can do." Greg led him out of the nursery and back down the stairs. "Did you have fun with your brother today?"
Sherlock peeked out with one eye; "Ba'ge?"
No, he couldn’t do that, either.
“Well, that’s far more adorable than it has any right to be." Mycroft smiled as he fed Sherlock another bite of fish.
“It’s not just for people who were abused as children , Mycroft. Though if you get right down to it, our childhood was less than idyllic.”
"I reeeeaaaaally don't want to take my pants off."
Mycroft almost felt sorry for him…
Sherlock leaned forward in his booster; "We s'ill ma'ge fros'ing???" he asked with a slight wince.
"Thrilling." Mycroft put the remote on the night stand and flipped off his bedside lamp.
"Ok, swee'd h'ard."
“Also, he’s bossy and in love with a genius.” Sherlock waggled his eyebrows at Jawn’s indignant huff and grunted his displeasure when Mycroft stuffed the bottle back into his mouth.
“Experiment.” Sherlock mumbled to the back of the sofa, hunching his shoulders.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment; "O'gay. G'eg go wor'g wi'f me an' Maw'yee."
"He's going to be fine. He's very excited to get a green cast."
"Sour puss," Greg teased, helping Sherlock off the bed and onto his feet.
"Wai' f'ah G'eg."
Mycroft hummed; "We've lost your dummy already, haven't we."
"Then pick one or two, you little contrarian."
"Me too," Greg said, absentmindedly rubbing the part of Mycroft's arm closest to him with his knuckles.
Mycroft continued to glare at him and reached down to collect the small toy Sherlock had won, then put it in his coat pocket. “We’ll finish this little discussion at home,” he said, putting his hand on the small of the younger man’s back, and then turned to Jawn. “Let’s go, Jawn…bring the food with you, please.”
"Ointment."
"I'm e'ssited too." Sherlock licked his fingers and reached for the last cupcake. "I y'ub p'esents."
“What are you doing here Mycroft?” Sherlock grumbled from the landing, fighting the buttons on his coat.
"Myc."
Mycroft snorted, and Sherlock giggled. "Is goo' snow-man!" he said, cramming another handful of crisps in his mouth.
“That’s brilliant, Jawn. What cup are you going to use?” Mycroft flipped off the water and began to dry his and Sherlock’s hands.
"Th'ing i'd, Maw'yee, p'ea'the!"
"Yeah, different. You want some soy sauce? It's not made of fish."
"One mo', righ' there."
John grips his hips through his clothing and seats himself inside fully, hips pressed against Sherlock’s ass. He wonders vaguely if John wiped his hand off before touching his coat. Then he scolds himself for worrying about such a thing with his lover planted firmly inside of him.
"Do you want your shoulders to hurt all night?"
“You’ll fall asleep.”
"Def'inny no'd."
"Y'ah, lab'bender."
!” Sherlock protested. “I y’ike it when Jawn sing!”
"Come to Greg," Greg said, taking them. "Let's clean up a bit so we can have dinner."
Mycroft looked over his shoulder--Sherlock had made his way over to the sandbox that had been moved inside for the winter, and scooped up a handful.
Mycroft sighed again, before following Greg's lead and settling into bed.
And it’s the sound that draws John's attention, and if he didn’t possess excellent self-restraint, his chin would have dropped. Despite himself, John’s tongue darts out and across his lips as all the blood in his body rushes south, causing his prick to strain in his pants. Sherlock is an attractive man, but in this moment John can barely contain himself. Seeing Sherlock wet from the shower and uninhabited by any form of modesty is almost too much to bear. John watches silently, keeping his arms crossed firmly over his chest.
"That's right, Molly's coming to see you."
Mycroft chuckled; “You’re cuter this way…I should have bribed you sooner. Did Sherlock find his shoes yet?” he called out. “I’d hate to leave without him!”
Sherlock nodded absently as he sorted his markers into the appropriate order. Magenta and chartreuse always touched. A hand on his arm guided him out of the flat and down the stairs.
"G'eg c'yute." Sherlock scrunched his eyes closed as Greg finished putting on his plaster.
When Sherlock made no further objections, John moved on. "The next rule about your health,” John scribbled the word 'Eating' across the paper. "Sherlock will eat three reasonable meals a day."
“Do we really need to discuss obedience so soon after a spanking?” Mycroft gave the baby's as of yet pale thigh a meaningful pat.
“Sometime tonight, darling.”
"Thank you."
Sherlock had the good sense to look ashamed for a moment before sticking out his chin. “Am not!”
"No, no...don't risk waking him up."
"Yea'."
'bee."
"And gravy."
"I'm not making popcorn at midnight."
"What about you? Do you need to sit on the step?"
Doubly so with both of their cute little rounded bottoms sticking up in the air, each one marked with various stages of healing from several spankings throughout the day.
"Y'ittle bi'd."
They had to be there. Sherlock was certain he'd seen his brother put them up after giving him his last dose. Hell, he'd settle for some paracetamol at the moment.
"Back into bed, little love," he scolds, without even glancing up.
Too stunned to do more than yelp in shock, the little detective stomped his feet as a dozen swats lit his still smarting bottom back to a fierce heat.
"I y'ike it," Sherlock mumbled through a mouthful of frozen juice.
“After dinner, Daddy,” Sherlock said in a demanding tone.
“Spoilt,” Jawn grumbled, getting to his feet and leaning over the coffee table. Sherlock had ‘melted’ into a pile of whinge, leaning heavily against Mycroft’s leg. “Look, see--” Jawn bared his teeth at Sherlock, clicking them together for emphasis. “No pink. I would have g'een tee'f anyways.”
"My'cobb hel'b ma'ge faerie houses?"
“A SHAR’B TOOTH!”
Sherlock freezes, mid-stroke, his mind trying to reconcile the pliant image of Daddy below him, with the very clearly pissed off Daddy in the doorway.
"Spraying him in the face isn't really going to improve this, Gregory."
Sherlock sat, slowly, then put his phone face down before taking a sip of tea from the mug they'd made for him; "...This needs sugar, Geoff."
"Shouldn't he see a regular doctor...?"
“No kisses for you until you brush your teeth,” the little doctor teased, and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple.
"You're both going to the same place...Sherlock,
"Just plant me under a palm tree?"
"I know, it was very worrisome." Mycroft patted Sherlock's hip as he slowly rocked them. "But luckily for Baxter, he had a very smart, clever little boy that loved him...and do you know what his name was?"
long since she''d gotten to play, and--!
Greg got the glove off and started to take off Sherlock's rings, lining them up so they could go back on in the 'right' order.
Jawn sat up. "Where goin'?"
suggest that we use the hose," Mycroft said in that 'you-should-have-known' tone of voice that he favored so often, while setting the oven to preheat.
"We pinky-promised on it,' Molly said. Her hand made the motion to tuck her hair behind her ear, having forgotten that it had been put up.
Mycroft rolled his eyes; "Better to put the whole pack in there, then...that's how much he'll eat."
"Pou'."
Jawn was still crying and clutching his elbow, but it was becoming obvious that the whole experience was starting to take a toll on him. Greg suspected that if that elbow was broken, like he thought it was, Jawn might be starting to go into shock.
“--Jeffrey will be good as new.”
Greg frowned; "Gettin' upset made your tummy upset, too?"
"Haaaaapppy Birthdaaaay tooo youuuuu!" Greg and Mycroft harmonized.
Greg stopped.
"Lovely," Mycroft muttered.
“It was naughty and I’m not ‘llowed?” Sherlock mumbled.
"Gregory."
Using the same concentration he used to solve locked room mysteries, Sherlock tapped the plastic spoon on the side of the bowl until the peanut butter plopped off. "I di'id!" he hooted, dropping his cup onto the floor. "Ooo'bs. S'aw'ree."
what you were implying," Greg sneered.
“Jawn,” Mycroft interrupted, suddenly more tired than he’d felt in years. “What are you talking about?”
"Annnnd, which one is Matilda, again?" Mycroft asked.
"Urgently."
"I know. That's going to feel that way for a while." Mycroft helped him step out of he tub and wrapped him in a large towel.
"You need medicine," Mycroft said, and kissed his cheek.
Sherlock nodded. "Be ri'de ba'g?" he asked before suckling down on his cup as he if hadn't had a drop to drink in days.
"Music, Sherlock. Something nice."
"Yeah. Then you can take one home with you when we find the other." Greg waited until the titles stopped scrolling by completely before trying to ease the remote from Sherlock's hand...but stopped when sleepy fingers still tightened around it. "Okay, you just hang onto that, then," Greg whispered, and patted his hip instead.
"A'cause I see 'em ina mirror a'fore."
“Gentlemen,” Mycroft smiled brightly as two eager little boys turned in his direction, both practically bouncing in their seats. “Napkins before ice cream.”
Jawn patted his back reflexively. “S'okay.”
"O'b course! G'eg is goo' hel'b. I y'ike i'd."
"Wonderful choice. What color should that one be?"
Mycroft broke off a piece of cookie, then broke off a small piece from that and held it to Sherlock's lips...it would be awfully sad for the baby to fall asleep before getting his dessert
Jawn felt himself blushing and huddled his blanket back up over his head to hide it. “But you’re always right?”
Mycroft sighed for what seemed like the umpteenth time that day; it was the dummy argument all over again. “Jawn, you have a whole pile of green ones, in all different shades…let Sherlock have one.”
Jawn sat very still, tears building in his throat that he refused to let out. He was not a crybaby!  “Y..yo..you’re a jerk,” he stuttered, wrenching himself off of Mycroft’s lap. He turned in place once, unsure where to hide to lick his wounds, before stomping down the hallway and slamming the nursery door. Repeatedly.
"Um, a'cause Ary'el does i'd."
“Wha’d was Sher’yock like?”
"Bring me another flannel." Mycroft looked down at his little brother and sighed; "...make that two of them."
Sherlock shifts even closer and licks his lips, "Did I...was...was that alright?"
“Alright, Pet. Let’s get you into the nursery and down for a nap.”
Sherlock examined the scoop. "A'w c'yean. S'are?" He aimed to put the scoop into the perfectly filled cupcake cups.
Jawn flashed him a toothy grin before going back to his drawing.
"Close your eyes. It's time to settle down and rest...and that includes everyone."
“These p'ish are from the bottom of the ocean. Gotsa go ‘splorin the bottom of the sea.” Jawn took the red duck from Sherlock and pushed it beneath the water until it touched the bottom of the tub, then hooted with laughter as he released the duck and it splashed out of the water and out of the tub.
Greg squatted down on the back stoop and tugged off one of sherlock's bee boots, thumping it to get as much of the glitter out as possible. "They can't live in your boots because your feet go in your boots."
"Without your crew, you’ll have no way to overtake a merchant ship.”
Fingers that seemed longer than they should in the half-dark started grasping for him. “My?”
Sherlock pouted around the nipple in his mouth and made a small, whimpering noise at the back of his throat.
"Monkey!" Greg laughed as he reached for him, and Sherlock passed him over. "What were you doing under there, huh? You gave us a scare!"
, with actual soap and water."
"I'm going that way anyway," Mycroft said, gathering the soled nappy and wipes, and rolling them all up. "Just the plasters?"
A muffled sniffle came from the carpet.
"I hate this movie," Mycroft groused. "It's two fart jokes away from being one of those buddy cop films you make me watch."
“It’s rose flavour.” Mycroft took a dainty bite, steadfastly ignoring the fact that Jawn was talking with his mouth full.
"Can we color? If we draw you pit'chers, will you hang them on your fridge?”
"Y-you are?" Sherlock stammered, wiping his hand across his soaked face.
"Gunna....cccuu...m." Another smack of the ass and he is wailing Daddy's name, spilling into the toy. He collapses to the side, his cock going flaccid inside its bed of silicone. John allows him to breath, but does not remove his fingers. Every few seconds he twitches them, brushing Sherlock’s prostate in the process. The curly headed detective moans and writhes with each flick of John’s fingers.
Greg cuddled Sherlock high up on his chest and reached down to pat his backside. "Thought you were done with that," he said.
"Once we're home, we'll get you changed into your jams, take some medicine, and have a rest," Greg slowly navigated the steps.
Sherlock huffed a sigh and dropped his head onto the back of the sofa. “If you’re not going to listen, why did you ask.”
"There, see. Now you've gotten your special attention."
“Finish washing your hands, please,” Mycroft said, then bent down to help a reluctant Sherlock to his feet; “…then pick a prize and join us.”
No sooner than the words left Mycroft’s lips, there was a bold, window-shaking cry of “
Greg sighed, and did the only thing he could think to do--he started the tea.
"We can ha'b mo' bi'ssits?"
Sherlock gave a coy shrug and pulled the bottle back to his mouth.
"Tattletale." Greg selected the playlist that Mycroft had made just for the boys whenever they were over; a combination of classical and white noise. "There," he said, handing it back.
"That'sa load of wash," Greg scoffed.
“Big an’ strong,” Jawn replied, staring at the screen. Unlike Sherlock, he could always find some new detail going on in the background, no matter how small, and he took great pride in rubbing it in Sherlock’s face when he did so.
Pausing to rub his own stinging palm against his trousers; “Jawn. What was this spanking for?”
Jawn stared at him with doe eyes. The swat hadn’t hurt, not really...but it had been surprising, and suddenly he could feel his own eyes watering.
“Bu’ you said pirates do whatever they wan’!” Jawn’s voice far louder than it should be.
The list went on for another whole page. Christ.
"Once you're in bed, Anthea is going to pull your medical records. Again." Mycroft told the sleeping baby. "We probably should have taped your ribs. We'll need to consult YouTube since our favorite physician is currently on my shit list."
"Where you having sweet dreams? Hmm," Greg sat half on the sofa, playing with Sherlock's hand. "Did you dream about pandas eating kung-fu ice cream cones?"
"It's not a bug, is it?" Greg could just imagine Mycroft's reaction. "C'mere, muffin."
Greg doused the baby in powder and closed his new, dry nappy; "One of very many things that Mycroft is right about."
With a final determined nod, Sherlock leaves the nursery. He moves very carefully this time, skipping the squeaky board. This time John will have no idea that he’s coming. Soon he’s standing in the middle of the sitting room staring at John behind his paper.
"Baxter and Peanut are good stuffies who've never done anything wrong, ever."
"He's wet."
"Smart arse." Greg tossed the towel aside to be picked up later, and gave Sherlock a quick pat on the bottom. "Climb up."
“Are you allowed to shout at Daddy?” The calm in Daddy’s voice is a trap and Sherlock knows it. He makes a show of glaring at the floor to the right of Daddy’s legs and shuffling his own feet nervously. “Well?”
"You," Mycroft said with a flick to his little brother's nose; "-are being impatient and fussy."
"In'nie min'id?"
“It’s my turn, actually.”
"Alright, alright...I suppose we can wait until morning. Let's get you padded and dressed." Mycroft patted his bottom. "Nursery."
They were going to take the first-aid kit and tape some gauze around that poor baby's stitches, he decided. He couldn't take listening to anymore crying like that.
"Nn-nn," Sherlock murmured, running his hand along Mycroft's arm while he held his bottle.
"Wha'd?"
"Mm. Should we use a pastry bag and make the frosting fancy? Or use a butter knife and smear it on."
The little detective looked up at hearing his name and popped his thumb out of his mouth. “Told you he cries lots.”
"I don't snoop! I investigate."
"Yea. A'ways room fa mo' b'e's'icks."
"That's a nice collection. We might not need it all today, though."
' Greg reached up and rubbed the glitter away from his eyes anyway and blinked cautiously. "Who're you callin'--?!" he began, and stopped.
"That's a lot of sheep. Are there any more?"
“It’s my dummy and I want it now!” Jawn shouted, abandoning the umbrella and pummeled pillow on the floor. He reached to take the dummy from Sherlock’s mouth but found his wrist caught in a firm grip.
He groaned and had to place his hand on Mycroft's shoulder to sit up right. "Buh-bye Maw'yee. I miss you!" he said, and gladly wrapped Molly in a hug.
Sherlock perked up at the sound of his name. “Pink tee’f? I see?” he said, reaching for Jawn’s mouth.
"I know."
Sherlock sucked on the spout of his cup and nodded, already looking half-asleep.
"You and Mycroft are excellent bakers. You should open a shop."
Mycroft put his phone down and sat at his desk for a long time, holding his head in his hands.
Mycroft quickly changed the subject. "Which flowers are going in your faerie house, Sherlock."
Mycroft looked down at his baby brother, safely tucked back into the crook of Greg's arm. "Considering he's still sacked out? I would say so."
There came another chorus of 'awwwww's from both the babies. "Bu'd e'beryb'uddy wal'ged," Sherlock pouted.
"Unnecessary?"
"You're both hilarious."
"Sherlock, come to Grammy, little love." He stood still at the top of the steps for a moment before turning into the sitting room. His feet dragging as he crossed the sitting room to Mrs. Hudson. She's sitting in Daddy's chair. An irrational spike of irritation burns in his chest about this before he collapses on the floor at her feet, burying his face in her lap.
"Right, right," Mycroft said, keeping a steady hand on the small of his little brother's back. "But what are we going to be when we dig them up?"
“Because I will not be changing
"I nee' s'ay awa'ge to ma'ge cu'bca'ges. An' ea'd f'ree of 'em."
"I knoooow how'a do i'd," Jawn huffed, sending mint-smelling foam dripping from his mouth down the front of his pajamas while Mycroft sighed--no. No, he didn't sigh...he was far too tired to sigh anymore. "Just spit and rinse, Jawn."
"He needs a bath," Greg said, tossing the rag aside as he finally gave up. He was likely to hurt the kid if he kept trying to scrub, and that was the very last thing he wanted.
"…You’re still worried.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes (and winced a little there at the end…he might have actually pulled a muscle, after all the eye-rolling today), and gave Jawn’s backside one more softer pat before standing up and pulling the blankets higher up at their shoulders.
Keeping his head down, Sherlock crawled into his lap. "So'wwy."
John chuckles, shaking his head. “You’re damn lucky Daddy thinks you’re adorable when you’re a pain in the arse Sherlock Holmes.”  Sherlock hums his agreement, smiling broadly. “Get under the covers, Pet.” John says as he flips on the bedside lamp and tosses the forgotten jumper at the little detective before moving to the dresser and changing into his pajamas. He turns back to the bed a few moments later to see Sherlock lying on his stomach under the covers, jumper pressed under his cheek, and a thumb in his mouth. He’s watching John with eyes already drifting closed in sleep.
Mycroft took another deep breath. "Your Uncle Gregory is a clot. Let's go. But
“Yes, the next one is caramel. Use your other hand so there isn't slobber in it.”
"And that wasn't gentle, was it? No, that was what we call 'a big waste'."
“He’s like Jawn,” Sherlock said, turning his head away from the bottle.
"Ah...that must be the pain medication."
Greg made a huge show of sniffing the clover flower before putting it behind Sherlock's ear. "I'm sure there is? But I can go get if you want more."
"Shhhhr'yoook!" Jawn hollered from the top of the stairs. " 'Mon!"
"It's not an elephant," Greg said as he stuck the tube to the top ball.
Mycroft poured some of the liquid in the cup into the bushes again and added more water. "I think one more drop blue should do it."
“Neither of you are allowed on the steps while you’re little.”
“A'cause ba’ b'havior?”
"I dro'b it and accidentally kick it at same time."
Greg sat the bottle on top of the dresser near the door, and set the pills next to it. "I'm leaving these here," he told Mycroft. "C'mon, Molly, I'll see you out."
"Mycroft's right, muffin." Greg took the empty plate next, leaving Sherlock's cup in front of him. "We'll get your bee wellies."
"You're a messy lad today." Greg used his bib to wipe the baby's face.
"Ne'ber too many, can a'ways ha'b mo'."
"Uh-huh, up, up-up-up-up up–!”
"For once???" Greg's eyebrows nearly met his hairline.
"P'omise?"
...It worked. "P'esents!"
"Mycroft said 'no', muffin."
“What? No Daddy. I need to be able to...” John could feel the younger man in his lap about to strop, pulling away from his embrace so that he could stomp around the room.
Sherlock put one more drop of dye in the cup before plunking the flower in. "Lab'bender? Come on now," Sherlock coaxed, peering down into the cup.
"Y'o'ss?" Sherlock slurred, turning towards Mycroft and settling in the crook of his arm.
Greg moved to the closet and pulled out the shopping bag with Sherlocks' change of big clothes in it.
"My'coff help me hol' y'adybugs a y'ittle bit. One poop on him." Sherlock grinned like the cat who swallowed the canary as Mycroft made indignant noises at the stove.
"Yes, so hilarious you nearly asphyxiated the child." Mycroft sat up and took the bottle away. "That's exactly why you don't lay them
Sherlock was busy looking down at himself, and running his hands up and down the front of his sleeper. "Hey, you," Mycroft said, and poked him very gently in the belly, making him giggle.
Greg buried his nose in Sherlock's hair and kissed the side of his head. He couldn't imagine it getting worse than this.
Sherlock waggled his foot until it popped out the bottom of his jams.
"My'coff put ex'ra co'ders in a bushes."
Sherlock made a face; “Y’ug.”
"Yeah...nurses thought he was cute."
“You an’ My’coff?” Jawn spooned himself against Mycroft’s side, snuggling in with a stuffed dinosaur, puppy, and frog.
"NO!" Mycroft and Greg chorused. "Jawn is going to rest tonight."
Sherlock held the umbrella out as if he was leading an orchestra. “My turn.”
"What's the lesser of two evils?"
"Gregory." Mycroft spoke quietly; "...he's not going to be much of a playmate if he's napping."
Greg giggled and nibbled on Mycroft's ear lobe; "If you like to linger where it's shady, ukulele lady linger too. If you kiss a ukulele lady, while you promise ever to be true..."
Sherlock nodded his agreement before taking off down the hall to find his shoes.
Sherlock nodded and shrunk into himself even more.
“No more lettuces!” Jawn cheered as Sherlock scooped the last bit out of the water. “Bubbas, p'ease, My'coff!" he added, before he dropped his net beside the tub and half belly flopped into the tub, water sloshing dangerously close to the edge.
"G'eg? How I g'yoves?"
Greg glanced at Sherlock in the rear view mirror, most of his fingers were in his mouth. "You're both going to be fine." Greg pulled into the A&E. Mycroft was standing with a medical team who immediately came to collect Jawn.
"Watch me bathe?"
"Then go ahead and ask me what you were so obviously trying to hide."
“They are lovely. Rinse your brush and then it’s lie-down time.”
“So I don't have to sleep in the crib?” Sherlock asked into John’s neck.
Sherlock giggled and sped up, his knees thumping along, and Mycroft wondered if they didn’t ache after a long day of being tiny. He reached down and caught the little detective’s narrow ankle just as he skirted the edge of the nursery door.
Sherlock was sound asleep, his dummy making little bobbing motions in his mouth, but Jawn was wide awake as ever and focused on the picture of Mother rabbit dressing her little one’s up for the day.
Now that Jawn had stomped and shouted and basically put himself in a time-out, he didn’t feel like being angry anymore. He ambled around the corner into the kitchen, looking down at the floor, and mumbled a quick “Thankyou,” under his breath and held out his hand for it.
Sherlock felt his chin dimple, and he pressed his lips together again, tighter than before, tight enough to feel his pulse in them as his teeth threatened to cut into the backs.
The baby stirred, unhappy at being awoken.
"The part where Sally stepped out of the flower and started ripping them a new one."
Things quieted down instantly, and for a few precious minutes, Mycroft was actually enjoying the quiet stroll with his little brother, with Jawn trailing behind.
“Oh! So pretty!” Jawn cooed.
Sherlock cringed and squirmed on John's lap. "In the future can we refrain from using that word?"
"I make paper flowers a lot. And clothes for Toby."
“I want to play the claw machines," Sherlock grumbled, seemingly oblivious to the thunderous look on Mycroft’s face.
"I aw'ways wear c'yothes!"
"G'eg'ry y'ub bea'sh."
While Mycroft was busy scowling at Sherlock, Jawn helped himself to another spoonful of Mycroft’s ice cream, leaving behind a trail of green whipped cream.
"Mo'? I c'n ha'b mo'?"
“I found Sherlock’s pirate cup!” Jawn peeped, holding up a green cup covered in pirates.
Sherlock was sitting on the side of the bed, hunched over and looking half his actual size while he stared at the floor. He looked up when Mycroft entered, his eyes already glassy and full of worry.
"Bugger." Greg kissed Sherlock's cheek and stood up from the bed. "Can you sit here and play with your telescope while I get batteries?"
Mycroft went into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.
"You di'id!"
Mycroft sat back on his haunches; “Quickly then. Your aim will be even worse if there is soap in your eyes.”
“Excuse me?”
"Sun is awa'ge. So time a ge'd ub an' ea'd cereal."
Now that the boxers had been sent to their respective corners of the ring, Mycroft took his time in getting both Jawn’s cup and Sherlock’s bottle, then returning to the nursery to collect two blankets…the green one being Jawn’s, obviously, so that must mean the purple one was his little brother’s. He left them on opposite ends of the couch, and then put the DVD into the player. “…You may both come out now.”
But, no.
Greg saw his chance and picked up one of the snap peas in Sherlock's food, held it to his lips, and silently cheered when he opened his mouth and ate it without fuss. He alsomanaged to feed him a bit of carrot and broccoli floret before Mycroft came back to the table, seemingly breaking the spell.
“Of course you can. Pirates can do whatever they want.” Mycroft impatiently pressed the button to make the light change, the little detective leaning against him was heavy and still on the verge of weeping.
"Sure you can..." The pair reached the bottom of the stairs, and Greg waited until Sherlock's feet were firmly on the bottom landing before reaching back and tickling his belly. "...If you think your tummy's big enough to handle it."
"You're going to vomit."
"You hush, too." Greg laid on his back and scooped and pulled Sherlock on top of his chest so he could pat his back. "Everyone, go back to sleep."
Sherlock didn't look like he believed that, but he didn't argue. "He said in this message that he's sorry," he said. "And this one. And this one as well. And this one."
"Myyyyyyyyc."
"Whatever you like. Come sit at the table and keep me company."
"Go w'if G'eg," Sherlock repeated as Greg set him down on his own two feet, and took his hand.
Sherlock fell into the little doctor’s embrace, burying is face in Jawn’s shoulder; “So'wwie, Jawn.”
"I can see that."
"Pee'za." John slurred, struggling to open his eyes, “ ‘m b'ery hungry."
"Wha'ds tha'd?"
“Up, My?” Sherlock peeped, dropping his dummy onto Mycroft’s chest.
Sherlock held onto his cup without answering.
Mycroft shot him a withering look. “No. I should think not. Naughty boys don’t get treats.”
Sherlock visibly relaxed.
"A'course." Greg took the baby's hand and led him into the kitchen. "If you're gunna have ten chocolate cereals you're going to need the proper bowl."
"Is everything an inside joke with the both of you?”
"A'course! Who wouldn't love living in a glitter tsunami?"
Jawn immediately stopped his fussing and dangled from Mycroft’s arms like a little monkey, blinking up at him. “…G’een?” he asked.
"Nuuuuuu."
"We're only starting with three today, one for each of us," Mycroft replied, raising his eyebrow as Sherlock set down his curiously heavy purse. "What did you bring to decorate with?"
"Whatever
Jawn wrinkled his nose but obediently spit, most of the foam making it into the sink. “A'w done!”
!" Both Greg and Mycroft called out at once, startling Sherlock before he could even set hands on it. A look of surprise crossed his face and he pulled his hands back in an instant, his eyes huge.
“Do you think you’re finished?” John moves to lean over him, his breath hot on Sherlock’s neck. “No, get back up and do it again.”
John glared between them, but when neither of them offered an explanation, changed tactics. “What do we feed it?”
"S'ug'r, swee'dhear'd!" Sherlock put the peanut butter-slicked bag of confectionary sugar on the counter.
"Not at all, you sexy thing!"
"There is much less egg in the batter on the spoon than there is on your slimy hands." Mycroft took the mixing bowl off the stand.
Greg tilted his head back in order to see his lover's face. "But, then who will carry us upstairs, dearest?" he asked, feigning innocence.
Jawn's eyes grew wide; "...Tha's a big ca'ge," he whispered in awe.
"Why's yours goin' first?"
Sherlock sucked on his fingers and shrank down in his seat as his brother passed by.
“Hmm?”
"Harry doesn't like me."
Sherlock nodded, eyes still fixed on the mixer as Greg went to fetch the rest of the ingredients.
Sherlock tilted his head and peered down at her; "Maw'yee no'd ta'ge pi'shurs w'ifs me?"
Mycroft looked up from powdering his bottom just in time to catch Sherlock's hand before he could rub his face with it. "That's just the medicine, sweetheart. That's how we know it's working...just don't rub."
“If ice cream and sprinkles…”
He patted the empty space next to the baby. "Get back in bed, Gregory."
John looked between them, suddenly concerned. “What’s in the box, Mycroft?
“Me! Not him!”
“Good, I’m glad you do.” Mycroft herded both boys out of the nursery and down the hall, back into the kitchen. “See this mess?” he asked, gesturing to the trail of wet lettuce that Jawn had left, and the pinkish-tinged puddles of watered down tomato sauce from Sherlock’s ‘washing’ of the dishes (which were also still stacked haphazardly in the sink).”This is all going to be cleaned in the next–” Mycroft checked his watch; “–twenty minutes.”
“Words, Sherlock.” Daddy patted his thigh.
"It's alright, brother mine," Mycroft murmured, and slipped a yellow dummy into his mouth.
"There we are, muffin," Greg said softly, and kissed his forehead as he carried him over to the crib while Mycroft followed with his bunny.
"That's not terribly convincing. And anyway, I was telling Gregory."
"Awww...I was c'ose!"
"I know, I know," Greg said, grinning cheekily as he took the baby's hand and led him out of the room. "I can't believe you're not asleep."
"A telescope," Mycroft said, grinning from ear to ear. "Look, see," he said, pointing to the blue and gold plastic tube; "You look in here, and you'll see--"
“My! I wan’ it!” The little detective made grabby hands.
"Isn't Billy what they call the skull?"
"Seven?" Greg carefully scooped Sherlock up and settled on the sofa beneath him.
Sherlock leaned against the back of the bench and rested his cheek on his arm. "Tha's a y'ong time."
Countless women have given him blowjobs, but none had ever been as good as Sherlock Holmes. His mouth is made for sucking John’s cock. John’s grip in the boy’s dark hair tightens as he looks down and takes in the sight of the tip of his cock slipping in and out of Sherlock’s delectable lips.
"There's no way I'm takin' a sticky-fingered, sugar-loaded toddler to the shop."
“Nah. Go on and take off your pants and trousers. We'll put you in a pull-up for naptime." John said, tucking his chair into place at the table.
Sherlock had walked down the steps with one hand in Greg's, one hand on the banister, and Baxter wedged under his chin.
"And I'm not tired a'tall so I don't need to lay down in any bed..."
"Mm."
“You haven’t seen anything yet. Give me the remote, before I get up and turn it off myself…and that will be the end of
"We can make a smoothie out of salad?"
Greg's mouth flopped open in surprise. "Nuh'uh!"
Jawn went red in the face and pulled his wrist free before stomping away.
"I try," Sherlock promised, and sounding sincere about it.
Sherlock's mouth worked as he swallowed his soup. "I'm no'd s'eepy, My'cobb," he said, trying to look at his brother over his shoulder.
Greg snorted. "You would bathe in glitter if we let you, wouldn't you?"
Greg helped Sherlock carefully climb out of his booster seat. "I thought you had to go to work, Molly."
Jawn looked at Mycroft, watching for any sign that he'd woken. "...F'ink so," he whispered back.
"Ohhhhhh, CANDY worms." Greg instantly regretted not putting a bib on Sherlock as he used his hand to brush the milk off his chin. "I love candy worms!"
"Because I'm a 'crank' about listening to you two moan about your bellies." Mycroft picked up one of the remotes and started to search through the selection of movies. "What haven't we watched yet?"
"He's sleeping with us."
"I will lick my opponent, haha, they are doomed, haha!"
They had to nip this in the bud, else they suffer through another night of crying over the lost 'Mermaid movie'; "Candles and presents?" Mycroft asked.
Jawn had his head dipped down, and looked up at Mycroft bashfully; "...Oo'bs," he said, mouth still covered in toothpaste suds.
"That can't be true...can it?" Greg stared at Mycroft as he licked his spoon and put it back in the macaroni.
"What?!"
Upstairs, Sherlock had finished wiping himself clean and was throwing on the clothing that Greg had haphazardly tossed in his day bag when he'd picked him up at the flat. He stooped to pick up his sodden nappy from the floor with two fingers and, nose wrinkling with disgust, turned to put it in the bin when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye. He looked up.
Greg grinned from ear to ear as Mycroft began to feed Molly spoonfuls of soup and bits of sandwich. "Looks like Sherlock might have a playmate today, after all."
"No. Two eggs is enough."
"I y'ub sna'gs!"
"...No, you're not." Greg sighed.
“The rabbits on your bib.”
"And then we can carefully dig up a flower."
"G'een."
"Just a bit more," Mycroft said, and pulled the sleeve of his jumper over his hand to brush away the last of the glitter clinging to Sherlock's cheeks. "There," he cooed, though it was doubtful his baby brother could hear him over his caterwauling. "There, all done!" Mycroft sat Sherlock up in his lap and held him to his chest.
Mycroft wiped it away with his thumb, then wiped his thumb on Sherlock’s blanket. “Well…you’re not wrong. But I thought you liked Iron Man?”
"Yes. The sauce you like is called fish sauce." Mycroft had put the cupcakes in the oven and was giving the mixing bowl a wash.
“Your hedgehog supplies are here on the landing. Good day Sherlock, John.” Mycroft called over his shoulder as he made his way down the stairs, still chuckling.
Sherlock's face brightened when he saw his brother. "Hi, My'cob!"
"Baxter and Peanut aren't people, but they are big eaters. I can tell."
"But you
Greg turned to look at Mycroft; "Why's he a fusspot about it all of a sudden?"
"Yeah, tomorrow. Come to Greg."
Sherlock quickly rubbed at his eye with the heel of his hand, grumpy that he hadn’t gotten a second song, but that was overridden by Jawn having picked one of his favorites. "What My doing?” he asked, abandoning his school of mostly-orange fish and their one green friend to climb up onto the couch and bulldoze his way into Mycroft’s lap, where he settled and stuck his thumb in his mouth.
“Oh goodness. I don’t understand what all the fuss is about today, little love.” John huffed, pulling the little detective in tight. "Course punishment is over”
"I'm sure they would if they ever tried it. Molly, cheese toasties and soup sound good to you?" Greg asked as he reached around Sherlock for his Winnie the Pooh cup.
Mycroft huffed a sigh. “You are picking that up the second your bath is over, Jawn.” It wasn’t worth the argument.
