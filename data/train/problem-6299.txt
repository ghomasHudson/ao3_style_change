: if someone's smart enough to get an internship at SI, they shouldn't have to waste tome getting coffee or printing stuff or whatever. Their time should be used for more useful stuff.
Steve's heart melts as it usually does when Tony does something particularly adorable.... Which almost all times in his opinion. No matter what Nat and Bucky says.
Crush was something normal people got, he wasn't normal, he was a warrior, and warriors did not have crushes or pine or moon, they wooed their beloved in a blaze of glory.
Peter wondered how he had ended up so far down the rabbit hole. He should in no way let his teacher talk to his dad about him selling drugs,  especially in front of his entire class.
"Oh, crud, she probably gave me another worksheet to be done! Gotta go, bye!" he ran out waving behind him at the three girls.
"They're probably freelance, but they had Bob with them so we can hear more from him- " Tony looked at him worriedly before interrupting,
@BlueberryMuffin He'll probably try to kill me, but he just took a step in the right direction with his crush and he doesn’t realise that his situation is really not as bad as it seems.
"Right, then we need to have a talk about getting into suspicious looking vans with suspicious people having no regards to safety" his pops cut in.
And it scares him because Bruce is perfect. He's smart. Smart enough to even talk about the properties of the Rainbow bridge with Heimdall even though he insisted he prefers Biology.
"I went to his room and he was drawing something and immediately shut the book." Tony finally settled in the blanket fort on his couch eating a spoonful of chocolate mint.
"Well if you must know, I have a plan to ask him out, it'll take some time but I have a plan" he says and definitely does not stick his tounge out thank you very much. (For the record, hypothetically, if he did, Nat and Bucky would deserve it ok?)
"That's going to be the sales pitch for the project. I know you probably think an interns pich normaly doesn’t make it to the end pich, and a company like SI has people that do that,  but well, You're picked as an intern because you’re good at this, and SI wants to utilise that."
"Well, you know how he used to have the 'internship'? Well, I talked to him before, turns out his classmates didn't believe him when he said that. I didn't know that the teachers didn't too." Tony input looking bitter.
"Tony he doesn't care as a friend, romantically I really doubt he's interested in me. Come on, after the crap that happenned at sakaar and not to mention how Hulk was mad at lightning for hitting him once, so he took it out on Thor. Why in his right mind would Thor go for me?"
My crops are watered my skin is clear, my children are fed my hotel is trivago STONY IS FUCKING CANON BITCHES!!!!
"Sorry, guys but I guess they didn't print passes out for you, you still have your own passes right?" The boys nodded and stood behind the line to scan the passes.
It didn’t,  if anything it backfired and she intensifyed her what Peter dubbed as Oh-You-Poor-Child energy.
I'd like to thank not only god but also Satan that Wakanda has Twitter and I get to talk to my meme buddy
Asdfghjkl captain America just @ ed me!! But forreal, everyone knows Stark is bi. He's like the shining icon in the Bi community?
" BABYBOY! How are you this fine morning? Do you like pancakes? Do you want something else?I'm on kitchen duty today, whatever you want, you're going to get." Deadpool rambled.
After breakfast was over, Peter headed out towards the training room along with Steve and Wade. They decided to spar today. When they were near the door to the gym they chose, Friday's voice came from the speaker.
"Well, I haven’t gotten her all the way where I wanted her yet, but, as of now, she can take out bullets, provide stiches, stabalise stab wounds and carry up to 400 pounds for four hours running."
"We 'ave new recruits!  Two passes for beginner level interns, one for research and one for marketing. And ze number for your tall friend with nice hair wouldn’t 'urt" she winks.
Seemed like Mr. Thompson wasn’t as enamoured with his parents like the rest of the class beacuse he had only about a second of warning from his spider sense before his collar was grabbed.
"Peter's supposed to be here with snack. I'm waiting" he said as he took a seat next to Steve on the couch.
Mr. Shuu nervously herded the children, "come on kids, tour is over." he gathered them all when Sam called out,
"Ned My dad has a mechanized Suit Of Armour. My other dad is the paragon of American Hopes and Dreams." He whisper yelled.
"Mr. I'm-rich-and-I-do-what-I-want over here, decided that it would be a splendid idea to install a coffee machine at every room in the pent house, the common room, the workshop and who knows where else!"
"WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING HERE PENIS?!? YOU'RE NOT EVEN ON THE FIELD TRIP!!!" He screamed which was murder on Peter's sensitive hearing.
"Oh, great you know, Had fun in physics, got to work on some stuff in chem lab, tasted complete and utter bitter taste of  betrayal when I  was in English. " he says faux casually.
Peter had to physically restrain the guy from attacking a kid with a bisexual flag cape in the pride parade last year. Not to mention the time Peter had to take an innocent civilian to hospital because he couldn’t control his gun. Peter heard much later that, he wasn’t on duty, and he was drunk when he shot the other guy.
Peter shook his head, maybe Spidey would pay a visit to Flash's dad when he's patrolling. He focused on his task at hand,
"You’re at the reception right? Wait there we're coming now. " he heard from Uncle Bruce and yikes everyone really is coming.
Life as a superhero could be tough, even more so when you're a teenager,  especially if your name happens to be Peter Rogers-Stark.
Cindy nodded hurriedly and sat on the side, there were a few beanbags. A few people were sitting and furiously typing on their laptops, she assumed they were interns like her.
By the time they reached the tower, they were all beat, Peter was glad to hear Shuri would be paying a visit to check out the scorpions. He missed his science buddy.
"Woah, there dude, chill, Peter doesn't use the front door because there's usually  paparazzi waiting outside, there isn't much of them today, but I think there's still one or two of them out there.
"Also! I wanted to show you the specks for your new suit. Let's go to the lab" Tony grabbed his hand and pulled him along.
"And I want to know why he brushed off a four year old making a Circuit board so easily, and since i'm pretty sure everyone else agrees with me, democracy wins" Clint throws Tony a sugary sweet smile.
Flash apparently didn't catch on to the fact that most of the Avengers want to murder him, so he askes,
Peter sighed, "Yes flash, absolutely, I programmed holograms to interact with people and my first demo would be to make my fathers and aunt sassing at my teacher, great deduction skills there." he said sarcastically.
Ok, so maybe Thor is a little, just a little in love with Bruce Banner. And he has absolutely no intention to tell the man.
"Just trust me when I say that you're all going to love the place." be says with the conspirational wink that all the teachers has been doing since they announced the trip.
"And how did you know that his company's gonna be ruined in a month." Steve asks feigning an air of casualness.
oh boy, that's  my boyfriend,  and.....  He really thinks I'm good looking for some reason. I hope he won't do something stupid.
"Hawkeye drank his coffee from the kitchen coffee machine this morning, I think he's a little honey loops right now." Wade piped up from next to him. Peter sighed and was about to open his mouth but apparently Flash decided he had lost the will to live.
"Um - this gym was meant to - meant to be showed in the tour? We could come back if it bothers you all." she vocalised weakly.
hahhahaahhHAHAHH @ Ban, you think you're in pain? You have not suffred untill you have lived with them.
"Hey, Flash? Who is Flash? Who names themself Flash that's like the worst name to choose ever." Tony calls out.
"Alright then, I'll just take Brunnhilde and..... Let you two talk." Loki took the laptop and leaned close to Thor
"One that involves time travel, aliens, Rouge Hydra agents and even more aliens." the robot replied before Peggy could ask.
"And one of our interns did actually manage to get -" she stopped, swayed and then swooned promptly passing out. Wade only managed to catch her before she brained herself on the chair next to her. He laid her down on the floor carefully and looked at one of the interns who immediately left. Hopefully to get help and not just afraid of his face.
"Listen, when that boy was born......" he waved a hand towards Tony ".... I thought he had potential,  I thought he could become my greatest creation and he goes off and builds a circuit board of all things it's not even anything more complicated! " Peggy really really wanted to slap Howard in the face.
"Baby you need to eat something. I know you went to sleep at the ass crack of late, but you didn't eat after 10 yesterday, and you know you need to eat. " Wade argued.
"Remind me again brother, why I shouldn't rip this mortals spine through his mouth and feed his carcass to the crows?" Loki asked through gritted teeth. Flash whimpered.
"He didn’t tell me who he was drawing and I guessed it was his crush,  you should have seen his face, he looked so in love" Tony sighed.
"Oh my god you're Peter Parker! I've seen you in the labs before! You're kind of a legend for all the other interns and some of the staff. Oh! But of course you knew that,why wouldn't you know that? You're a wizard with technology by the way" During her rambling, Peter kept getting more and more red.
Peter wasn't really that surprised when the school announced that their annual parents day and science fair was being merged this year. It had happened before, nothing new. What he was surprised about however, was when he heard the announcement that it was being hosted by Stark industries
The lady she met, she thinks her name is Francine, told them to reach the tower at 4. The tower wasn’t too far away from the school.
Thor didn't even have a choice but adoring the man. His heart sickness went to the point he might even call his feelings for the other man love.
"W-well you see, he has been saying that he has an internship at Stark industries since his sophomore year and gave no actual proof of his claims.  And then suddenly he starts wearing better clothes after wearing old ones for a long time, and he gets new phones and accessories and gets homemade food and all that so everyone thought he was involved in some sort of drug trafficking and that's how he got the money to get all the new stuff."
"Is to always be ready to take his place, he's too spontaneous to keep and abide by a schedule." Peter was drinking in the words of wisdom coming from her mouth.
"HAH, I WAS RIGHT, YOU WERE LYING PENIS!!!!" Flash's cheering was quickly cut out by one knife, two bullets  and one arrow grazing very close to his head. and flecks of red magical tendrils floating dangerously close to his body. He stopped himself to see, the fuming Avengers.
: 'and you think either Tony and I am afraid of Deadpool enough to let someone work close to us with no credentials?'
They reached Ned and MJ. Ned was staring at Wade wide eyed. MJ had that assessing look to her face. They knew who Wade is. But this would be their first time meeting them.
"Oh right, you didn't come in yesterday. Mr. Warren said that we're getting a new student, something about the student being really special."
"Please show this man the way to the exit and revoke any access he might have gotten in the future. Take him before I punch him. " Steve grits out.
And that was the other thing, ever since MJ invited her and Betty in the friend group, ("Call me MJ" which was later explained to them was how MJ made friends) And They started to talk more often, Elanor has spread it out and about that Cindy has a crush on Peter and vice versa.
"so what have you kids been seeing till now?" he asks and the students *coughflashcough* began to list off the labs they've been to. Mr. Lang, listened and shook his head,
:and he's so cute about stuff too! He's like… a head taller than me and really muscular but he wears hello kitty pajamas regularly. He even lets me borrow them some times.
Ned and MJ was escorted to a different room for the students who arent occupying a stall to take a test. (That they and Peter helped make. So there is no point in them taking it. Peter thinks irritabily)
Francine sighs, "ah, woe is me, anyway, zhese,are the new recruits, Cindy Moon and Betty Brant. " she gestures towards the girls just as Charlie pulls two cards from somewhere and hands them to Francine.
"Oh Peter." Steve sighed and pulled Peter in a hug. "Hey, its OK, I'll get Tony to personally get you out of detention, If he can't, I'll break you out my self OK?" Steve promised, and Peter couldn't stop a giggle
He had switched it off yesterday after getting so many calls then forgot to turn it on this morning when he started to work on some of Clint's new arrows.
"And then I stole it for a while, but I didn’t even find the guys face, it might even be someone I know I can't tell if it is though"
Yes he knew his father is Iron man, but he is also undeniably human. He doesn’t have any inbuilt ability to protect himself.  Not like Peter himself, not like his father,  or uncle Bucky or Thor, or any other inhanced human.
"Uh, it’s a tour sir. From Midtown. " Betty stepped forward.  Closer to them so the group probably didn’t hear their conversation.
"What did you see in book?" Peter asks, knowing fully well that this is what Nat Sam and Bucky were hearing from Steve's perspective.
"We were. She's the one who got me all that Captain America memorabilia, also the one who told me Steve is bi. " he says.
"Leave me alone, I love my fake persona" he doesn’t.  Peter knows he doesn’t but it was a joke and he shruggs, letting it drop
The fight was brutal, he inevitably had to call in the avengers, apparently giant robot scorpions that comes in hundreds calls for an assemble, go figure.
"I'm here to pick flowers for brother and Sam's wedding " she says with a unimpressed face. he can see why she and MJ has a crush on each other.
"Are you kidding me right now? What is in there? Oh, is it? Uh you like that person?" he asked his eyes dimmed for a second and huh..... Maybe he had a chance?
Apparently (heh a parent ly) His dad managed to convince his pops to let him dress him. Because instead of the usual khaki and t-shirt (cough so tight it might rip off shirt cough) Steve was wearing a suit. That actually fit him. Which usually meant his dad dressed him.
"The magnet that looks for trouble,  It's inheritency at this point. " Clint wisely shut up when he noticed Steve's grimace.
"How did he even lose the page?" Bucky questions from where he's flicking through channels on the TV.
Betty looked up from the box of badges hearing her best friend cackling like a mad scientist.  (Which, you know, she was well on her way to becoming one so she had every right to be cautious.)
Peter for his part just sighed, Flash has always been an idiot, but his sense of survival is dwindling by the minute.
"He's Rogers-Stark Thompson, or did you forget the wedding that was on nearly every media?" It was amazing how MJ could control the flow of the conversation and change the subject without anyone noticing, Ned sometimes wished he and Peter had that power.
"Hey, penis, think we're gonna meet your old pal? maybe we'll even meet the Avengers, then I can prove to everyone what a liar you are." Flash laughed.
"Uh huh, and where are your parents? Didn't come to see you winning the science fair?" his words sounded slightly mocking.
"I'm actually a senior, since I'm, you know a year older than you but hey! We're in the same school!"
I don't know what possessed me to write this but here you go, I've never written confessions before, so please go easy on me.
After aunt May's death, which was due to cancer (screw that disease and everything it stands for) Peter was, as any normal child of 16 would be, lost, he didn't know where he'll go, what he'd eat, his thoughts were practically in a loop of "ohmygodpleasedon'tsendmetoafosterhome."
: so penis parker got his boyfriend to threaten him and his friends a position in the SI what a surprise.
A man with sandy blond hair and blue eyes was fidgeting next to a man with darker skin black hair and brown eyes who looked much calmer. However, the first man was not even close as fidgety as the young boy with brown hair and brown doe eyes.
"And what do you have for me now Friday?" He questioned, and a holo-screen came up in front of him. The video was a survalaince footage, of Peter.
Breakfast was.... Quiet, he's used to eating with everyone, but it really is late, and jet lag is a terrible terrible thing.
As soon as she heard that their group was going to the surprise  Field trip immediately made an excuse to the
"You finished all the icecream in the freezing room thrice. A freezer that is as big as a normal closet might I add, while watching all the romance movies. And Bruce has only been gone a month. You're pining." Natasha says deadpan and finishing up the top coat in his hand, he had yellow lightning bolts over a blue background in all his nails.
Peter saw his class have the freakout of Tony freaking Rogers-Stark is standing in front of them, then he saw them process the words that he said.
Ned poked him, "Is that Shuri? should we go say hi? are we allowed to talk to her in public?  cause like she's a princess, and then you know her because your other job, but we're good friends too, but would talking to her could blow your cover, but like could it really blow your cover?........"
The class, except for Ned, was too starstruck to reply. Ned smiled at her bashfully. It didn't look like she minded or saw.
"You must be the group from Midtown high, Welcome to Stark Industries, or better known as Avengers tower. My name is Maddie and I will be your tour guide today. " she finishes as brightly as she started.
"MJ was looking for you? Something about a different worksheet?" she widened her eyes hoped she looked innocent.
wanted to take a head count. As though anyone in this miserable school would miss it. And they had to leave at six cause they wanted to reach SI by eight thirty. Right. Cause that's how you beat rush hour traffic. And to top everything off, Fury sent him on a late night mission against a small terrorist cell late last night, which meant he was still fighting off with his concussion and getting shoved and hitting his head on the seat did not help.
Deadpool is in the avengers tower. Deadpool is in the avengers tower kitchen. Dead pool is in the same room as Tony Rogers-Stark, and he's not even dead! What on god's green earth is happening?
"You came to a level one access gym -one that none of you ever use- to practice, today, all of a sudden?"
" Uhhhhh, heeeey guys! How's it going?" he tries. He knows he's about to be embarrassed, but he can't help but try.
"Wha- buh- dea- Deadpool!" Betty pointed out helpfully  as though they couldn’t clearly see the tallest  person in the room.
So the cop car saw that horn for a really long time thing and he still didn’t really have his balance so the car was moving pretty whack. the police car followed the van and blew the sirens the dude tried to hit the gas but I found the spray thing and sprayed him in the face.
"Nah, it’s cool. " he says and shuts his mouth firmly so that he wouldn’t blurt out something more embarrassing yet more true to his thoughts like,
"Absolutely not. He and I got off on such a rocky start it's a miracle we're even friends, I'm not ruining that for something like feelings"
And since they finished with classes by three, the two decided they had some time to kill so they found an empty class room to do their homework. ........  Well, pretend they did their homework while just scrolling through their phone.
Wait so.... That's five of the avengers out and four of them are bi, anyone else want to come out and get it over with?
"I was thinking that he should be able to do CPR. An& add some oxygen valves to do mouth to mouth And her general mode is search and rescue, so she can't detect threats against herself yet, so, I'll have to work in that. And some basic first aids" Peter shrugs.
Thankfully no one notices his lack of card too busy wracking their  brains about the projects, and barely being awake.
"The doctors try literally everything for him. It just doesn't work." Tony sounded frustrated. He wraps an arm around Tony in support.
Before Peter could say anything, the bell rang and students poured out of the classes. Peter went to his locker grab his bag. His dads and aunt decided to wait near the car.
So where was he? Oh right! Anyway he refers to Tyler by his name and the others by dickbag no. Cause Tyler is the lead dick. The
So when she came down for breakfast this morning and didn't utter a single word about being bored and was looking like she was trying very hard not to smirk at him, it put Peter on edge.
"It's going to be a bit crazy  today, Mrs. Romanova-Potts' intern is coming down here today, so everyone's on their toes. " he shrugged,
"Ah, speak of ze devil! Betty, that is Fishlegs, one of ze senior interns in your department,  Fishlegs! I'm leaving her in your care. She's starting today. "
"And why is this the first time I've heard of this anyway Pete? " Tony asks, raising an eyebrow at his son.
They didn't talk about it later. If Ned and MJ thought that they shouldn't tell Peter about Flash's crush, he wouldn't press.
"So anyway dad and pops said they're gonna talk to the Principal about this whole incident. " If Peter hoped for sympathy he wasn't getting any from his friends.
"I'm saying that Peter suddenly began using a lot of new and expensive things, and there must be a reason for that." the reply was prim.
He walked along the corridor, giving small greetings to people passing him. When he finally reached the door, he heard people talking on the other side. Quite a few of them actually. he got a shock when he opened the door,
"Sure thing Doc, I'll get right on it as soon as you take a nap." Bruce looks at him like Nap is a foreign concept.
Peter looked up to see he had one Princess of Wakanda on his back hugging him. his eyes grew large as saucers.
"But, no matter human, since you gave me such a wonderful treasure, I'll help you. Maybe you'll even be alive to see the damage you did. " was the last he heard the voice before he was consumed by darkness.
"How do you know about that?" Peter raised an eyebrow. He didn't think the news would reach Ned so quickly but Ned has always had a way with information, whether it be computer codes or gossip.
The spider sense flaired up again and Peter ducked just in time to avoid being hit by a chair. The chair hit the ground and clatteres loud enough to make him flinch.
"Uh huh, come on, what is it?" he narrows his eyes, "is it something dirty? Cone on let me see, I won't tell anyone"
"WHAT!?!" It wasn't just Flash this time everyone except Ned and MJ, heck even Mr. Leroy exclaimed out.
"More or less, I'm not in the big scales like these guys but I just.... hang around in Queens I guess" he looked surprisingly bashful.
When they let go, Tony yelped and clutched his bicep Steve turned to see Natasha punching the genius.
"Peter, oh my god are you ok? Are you hurt? Do we need to get medical to check you out?  You  know what, Bruce ? Maybe you should check him for bruses when we get home?"
"You see this building? do you know who made it? do you know who owns the company? would you look at that it's me, guess I can do what I want huh?"
Lab 53 is an R&D lab not that important, though, Wade can't enter that lab either, (lifetime ban on lab equipment) Peter walks in behind everyone, slightly uninterested, only to be staring at the Princess of Wakanda and Bruce banner talking.
Now see here's the thing, Peter learned how to lie better to try to hide his identity to anyone but hos family, but this is Natasha, you can't  just go and lie to the Black Widow. it's not even about morals, you literally can't lie to her.
Flash sputtered but became quiet, he was happy to get the tour of Avengers tower.  if only for the reason to prove that Peter Parker was not an intern here. he was even more glad to hear that the intern that was giving the tour didn't know anyone working there with the last name Parker.
Peter literally saw both of his father's faces darken, all he could do was watch an both IronMan and Captain America turned to Flash and glare at him. The boy in question gulped, Peter looked towards Wade for help but the other boy seemed to be enjoying the whole thing like one of his favourite dramas.
"Steve is like the sun" the sentence was said wistfully between the repeated and for some odd reason soothing clangs of the lab. Peter sighed and prayed for strength.
Steve doesn't think much when he crashes the Valkyrie in the Arctic. He could have just ejected, but he was bored with the Humans. The Howling commandoes can only entertain him for so long without Bucky there.
"A warehouse, an hour via quinjet. " Nat's voice had a cold no nonsense tone to it that Steve appreciated at that moment.
"Hey there kid, heard you made a field medic?" the man asked Peter had the vaguest sense that he was nursing a hangover even though he showed no outward signs. It set Peter on edge.
"Well, what happened was that, Mr. Rogers-Stark, -the brunet one- signed his permission slip, and well, Mr. Collins thought he forged them." Ned, who just stopped laughing explained.
She would tell everyone she knows that she got an internship in the Stark motherfucking Industries,  she would, She's excited enough.
"mini boss you have to go take the stage, boss is running late." Friday informed him and the boy groaned,
"I wonder if son of Leeds would visit today." he says and grabs Steve in a wreslers hold forcing the other man to tap out.
Peter thought about that for a minute, realized what the fallout to that would be and immediately shook his head
"You'll probably be assigned a project soon, so keep an eye on the notice-" he says pointing to a big monitor attached to a wall. " you’ll  need to make pitches and write out how you want to sell whatever they give you. "
Peter's dads didn't get an email, which is a surprise to no one, after the first time he crashed due to overwork, his fathers were adamant about him missing classes whenever he could without dropping his grades. He got tutored by his family anyway.
Peter had to get up at such an ungodly  time he didn't even look at the clock because he'd probably start crying. He had to leave the warmth of his extremely comfy memory foam bed, and Wade to go to school. Only to be corralled in a school bus filled even more half asleep teenagers to go back to the building he came from by Eight. O'. Clock.
"You're reminding me of Frithiof's banishment, and while I loved watching him suffer, you're getting on my nerves." Loki checks his nails and then smiles at Peter
"we have a meeting with Peter's principal tomorrow babe, keep your schedule clear." Steve merely nodded.
Cindy shakes her head, It's not her problem, and the most she could do is point MJ to the right direction and hope she can help. God knows if Peter of Ned weren't disasters, they'd realise that Betty has a crush on Ned. Which is why she and MJ had to take initiative.
Peter has been slowly learning the business for the last four days, Pepper has been a great teacher but he was honest to god finished with businessmen who thought they could use him for personal gain.
"Yes, but- " Ned could feel her giving an explanation. This is probably the worst part of being the official computer expert of Bruce Odinson-banner.
The Class was abuzz after the sparring they never thought they'd ever get to see Captain America and the Winter solder sparring.
: yeah i know. And apparently genius didn't even tell Ned and MJ since he didn't want to worry them.
"Hey, Pete, could you help me out while you're going down anyway? I need doritos, not your pops kind. Garb me some if you're gonna get down all the floors anyway." his dad said. Peter nodded.
She sighs and rubs her forehead,  why could the man not move on? what on earth could posses him to keep searching for a man who's supposes to be dead but neglect his very alive family?
The cashier  gives him the wide eyed stare they always do when he gives them an unreasonably large amount of money to keep the change. He throws them a smirk from behind his phone as he grabs the pack of donut and walks out.
"Woah there pops, let's calm down there, no need to get aggravated, all under control. " he tried to calm the man down.
"Don't be a downer Capsicle, let the children have their fun." Tony says putting down his phone, and while Steve knew that there was no way he would say no now, he still couldn't help feel slightly cautious.
"Oh right, um... that's aunt Natasha, she's a shield agent, and a specialist in all things murder." the woman mentioned half smiled and waved. Peggy liked her.
(He asked Ned once, MJ answered for the other boy, "It's because you have the same energy as a puppy golden Labrador  and everyone loves puppies." he never brought it up close to MJ again)
"Nothing you need to worry your pretty little head about baby boy" Wade says and wraps his hand around Peter's shoulder.
"Please tell me no one kissed me." Steve smirked inwards. 'Oh, star, there would be so much more later' He thought.
"What he means is he and Bruce basically Tonyed their way to becoming Ned's second set of parents. Of course He knows him." Bucky says from next to Tony and gets his popcorn bowl taken from him for his troubles. Tony moves to Steve so that Bucky can't steal the Popcorn back.
They stand like that with Howard silently watching. Well, obviously considering his eyes and ears are the only part of him that works any more.
"Not at all! I even made Baby boy breakfast without burning anything! Wade replied brightly as they reached Tony and Steve.
Ned grimaced in sympathy for his friend and walked out of the school messaging about Legos and Star wars and everything else they didn't have time to nerd out about, He'll probably go to the tower later but hey, school time is prime talking with best friend time.
"Long story short, now I can't go to the field trip, and may also have detention for something I didn't even do!".
"We usually hold press conferences in the third floor, but there's nothing to be announced today, so it has been cleared for you guys. You will find that those who put their names forward for the fair already has a designated stall with their name on it. You have to set up shop however you need to in your stall."
Cindy was not pouting. She wasn’t.  It was absolutely normal for her friends to miss school, Peter and MJ can go to hang out to Wakanda with Peter's fathers to meet MJ's Princess  girlfriend any time! It's absolutely normal for Ned to go to Geneva because he's the intern of Bruce flipping Odinson-Banner. Their trips had been planned for a month, and it was by some terms work related.
"That must have been quite a shock too. Why don't you wait here and Call your guardian, and they could pick you up. " she smiles kindly.
But he would have to be introduced as the heir of the Stark fortune as well as the prodigy to Tony Rogers-Stark. That meant people in high places would have to know him, Pepper promised that the overwhelming number of calls would die down after the initial few days, after they realise they'd gain as much of a favour in SI from Peter as they get from Tony. (which is to say absolutely none)
"I think you're all going to love where we're going to go." She said with a barely there sneer directed at Peter.
Flash was by no means a rival in any meaning of the word but Peter was willing to take what he would get.
"nope! You're home early though, are you sick again?! Does it hurt? Don't lie to me babyboy." The mercenary rambled.
Peter sighed as he got another call in his Bluetooth his aunt Pepper insisted he got for the first few days. While Tony had no intention of making Peter a CEO and Peter had even less of an intention of being one, he would however, take over for Tony's job which is inventing and just being the owner.
He may or may not put his bag down a little noisily  on the  table to make sure he has his father's  attention.
Natasha was sitting in some complicated yoga pose that only she and Peter could do a few feet away from them.
"No offence Eleanor,  but we haven’t really talked before, heck I barely know you." the boy was almost pushed against the wall.
"Well, you know that Field trip I wasn't allowed to go to yesterday? Turns out, it was here, and these are my classmates and stop looking at me like that! I didn't realise the trip was here OK?!?!!!!!!" Peter rambled.
spidey told him that he loves him. That he doesn't care what he looks like. That he would never be able to trust anyone the way he trusts Wade. But sometimes, sometimes Yellow makes a point.
"Listen here you little,-" before he got to know what exactly it is that he's supposed to be listening to,  Mr. Thompson is cut off by a multitude of gasps. He looks towards where he sees Abe point to see his fathers arrive.
They think he doesn't know what's going on. They placed him in a mockery of a Hospital and expected him to play along? After staying away from his star for so long?
MJ, is also a Paid Intern™. which is to say, he's pretty sure Pepper is conditioning MJ to take over her job as CEO. (Or she's preparing her to become the next president or head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ned isn't really sure.)
she looked up to see the group and got a confused look on her face, the scientist with her explained that tour groups could go to this lab and she nodded in understanding.
He does however chance a look at Flash. The utterly gobsmacked expression he has is......  Gratifying. If only his fathers weren't so overprotective.
"Nothing too major? Friday, could you tell us about the records Mr. Thompson has regarding Peter?" Tony speaks with a cold anger seping into his voice.
I can't take this anymore.  @ fe-male @ ActuallyIrish 🅱lease, just check the  # brokenstony and comment
Can someone tell me why Steve is staring at his phone for the last two hours like the hundred year old he is?
"GET ON YOUR KNEES ON YOUR KNEES NOW. HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE EM. GET THEIR PHONES!" The guy who came inside behind everyone says.
A year later under normal circumstances they would have all panicked. It wouldn't be as much a problem if they were just the interns of Tony Rogers-Stark, Bruce Odinson-Banner (is Odinson really a last name?) and Pepper Romanova-Potts.
"Oh, I think we have a tour group coming in today, want to freak them out?" Clint grinned impishly. He took out his phone and began messeging someone
"Aunt 'tasha it's alright we all know I'm not involved with drugs now so I'll just cut the call and we'll start with our classes....."
"Hello Peter, I am glad that you took my suggestion of using the front door this time " Friday called. Peter hummed.
: he's sweet. Like  really sweet. And he's been in an incident so he's scarred and he's insecure about them.
Life has thrown /a lot/ of problems Peter's way. And it's a great thing that his willpower is as big as it is because sometimes he feels like that is the only thing that pulls him through to the end of the day.
OK listen, Peter was pretty sure the guy he was caught talking to in front of the school wasn't a drug dealer. He's just one of Wade's friends and granted all of his boyfriend's friends are shady looking but that does not mean they're all criminals. And Wade usually makes friends with the less evil people.
"Oh right, so this dude had a map and everything and he sounded foreign.  He said he was a tourist. And he wanted to go somewhere and got lost and I showed him the way. I even pointed it out in the map but he still didn't get it so he told me to just show him from the car-"
That is the question which has been going through the head of one Peter Rogers-Stark when he was sitting bored in his Chemistry class, very much regretting his patrol the previous night.
: so, Ryner, who I think is gonna get sacked sooner rather than later didn't believe Peter's internship.
"There's a student in our school, he's a computer expert here? I think? And he probably wanted the fact that he works here to be a secret, and told in the school that his best friend has an internship here. Maybe you should have someone sort it out?"
He printed out a couple of her specs which he's not really looking forward to show a room full of people, but It's criptic enough for no one to actually be able to build a replica.
The two scientists were settling in as the plane just took off Tony left to freshen up, and Bruce took a calming sip of the chamomile the hostess was kind enough to hand out.
"No, no they're settling in just fine the People here are friendly, actually they just had a communal ABBA dance just yesterday." Thor nods as Bruce and loki grimaces.
"The labs are on the other side of the building. " MJ looked the most put together but she too looked worried.
"Of course boss." the holograms disappear and Peter refuses to look at any of his peers and goes to his seat after taking his phone.
: yanno everytime you guys are gonna go quiet from now on I'm just gonna assume there's something happening.
"Dear god shut up! Tony, Steve, get up, go to the penthouse, talk it out. Or I'm going to lock.you two in a suply closet. " Bruce sounded as close to anger he got without Hulking out
We call It Wade's Peter senses. It's fairly accurate, if anyone is being mean to Peter within a mile radius of Wade, he tackle.
Peter didn't say anything.  He felt the entire class quiet down trying to listen. How he wished he had Ned or MJ in this class. Maybe MJ could have helped him get out of this situation, Ned would have been the best moral support at the very least.
One of the scientists,  Dr. Hooper, went over to Peter to drag him to her table while MJ continued to walk in their direction.
@ shizuki you dont have to be so rude about it, and It's not like she's bothering them with what she thinks.
my mother the great and kind woman, and My Brother,  he didn’t do much, but he's a furry, so he gets a shoutout.
"But Fish legs?" Cindy can't help but ask. Betty elbows her in the gut. This is why She's good at marketing.  She knows how to talk to people.
"You do realize acting like your emotionless public image in the tower fools absolutely no one right? "
"We will be seeing the second employee gym today to show you all what goes on there, though, fair warning, not many who works in SI.... Likes to exercise." She chuckled.
"And you, are going to have a nice long talk with me and then with everyone else just as soon as school ends, Ned says we have the same classes now. let's go."
Tony and Peter disappeared from where they were running checks on the Ironman suit. Tony with the suit and all.
He knew the future held more promises. Besides, he might not do anything but he always has his Star to watch.
They were getting ready to leave the Lab when a very frazzled looking Dr. Banner came in. He looked like he was running on coffee and energy drinks. Ned recognizes the look from seeing it many times on Peter and Tony. (seriously what is up with the sleep deprived scientist superheroes?)
As Sara tried to heard the group towards the elevator they saw a man staring up at a vent opening and yelling at it. The group looked at the man incredulously. Peter knew who he was and exactly what was happening , well... Not exactly, but he thinks he knows the gist of it. The man sees the group and catches Peter's eye,
Hey Shuri good to hear that do you think we'll get to work on R2d2 while you're here? Ned would probably help too.
"He's going to be ok. He's a tough guy you know." his voice was even and steady. Peter wasn’t really sure if he was trying to convince Peter or himself that Tony is going to be ok, but his words rang true.
"Peter please tell me you did not get in the car. " aunt Natasha's voice waved in. Oh man are they all hanging out together?
"Guys, come on, not now, they have a tour and Shuri just got here, I wanna hang out with her, maybe talk about this later?" If he could get them to wait for a while maybe they could cool off and talk about this with a level head, as it is, even the star spangled man with a plan looked ready to throttle someone. Namely Mr. Tritter.
Thor cheered both his brother and his friends from the sidelines, but didn't join. Probably because Bruce was meditating next to Natasha and does he not want to annoy his husband.
But at the latest Maria Stark Foundation gala, the truth comes out of the bag when Steve Rogers stops a woman from flirting with Tony Stark by telling her to stop flirting with his boyfriend.
"How dare you boy!? I am a busy man and I do the best anyone could possibly do with my schedule! " he exclaimed.
"I'll have you know Ned most definitely is not a nobody. He's one of the smartest people in this building. Besides, do you think you can hack Tony? No? Well he did. So kindly refrain from talking to him like that." he was glaring Flash down and the boy practically shrunk under the gaze.
Yeah,...... He isn’t exactly fond of Harrison Thompson. Oh, jeez is The crush Ned and MJ mentioned a guy? Or in the LGBTQ+ community?  That would be so bad for him.
"How did you know I'm Eleanor?" she yelps, she distinctly remember him not knowing and Cindy and Betty not telling him.
But the avengers were all in Washington in for a meeting about the Accords.  His dad was complaining about it all day the day before they left.
He was however, surprised to see one Princess of Wakanda talking to one of the scientists.  There was a lot of hand gestures and she looked really excited,  Peter guessed that she was working on something they came up with that is more about being nerdy than function. Or she's updating her brother's suit to go nya every time he transforms, it could be ether.
"We're taking her to one of the resting spaces. She was probably up for days. Uh… don't worry about the tour though, I asked F.R.I.D.A.Y and she said something about sending someone down soon, so if you could just wait here- " the intern looked at Mr. JJ. Who nodded.
"Looks like he didn't take you guys anywhere fun at all. Why come to the Avengers tower if you don't even meet the Avengers?" he said a bit mournfully.
You're right he would never, have to be that desperate. And watch how you talk to my broken white boy
Peter should ask, he should. He's a hero, and he cares about everyone even Flash- to some degree, but the thing is, there was no fatality. He is having a bad day so maybe, he deserves one cheat day where he turns a blind eye. He'll worry about Flash later.
"Ok, so I was walking to Ned's like normal right? we totally were gonna finish the Death Star today and I wasn’t in a hurry since we only had a little bit of it left- "
Cindy felt sorry for Peter,  whether or not he would like her back, he's about to be inconvenienced.  Eleanor is tricky, she gets extremely mean if she doesn’t get what she want.
"Son, I Better not hear that you've been bullying my son again, I don't like bullies" Steve growled. Peter was pretty sure Flash peed himself a little.
"Peter, I am, -and I can't stress this enough,- a billionaire. You don't need free food! I could have gotten  you whatever you wanted! "
He doesn’t have a card and neither does Ned or MJ. He huffs, figures they wouldn’t. He idly wonders if it was his Aunt Pepper or his Dad behind this perticular incident.
Which was true considering most of their attaire consisted of sweatpants, jeans, t-shirts and other assorted comfy clothes.
Erskine died, Steve ran after the killer. Howard shook his head, the demon must have purposefully messed with him, of course he knew what the one candidate that Erskine would choose look like.
Her smirk turned more malicious. Wade resisted the urge to smirk right back at her though not that she'd see anything since he did have a mask on.
Flash stared at him dumbstruck Peter smiled, maybe the boy just needed to be away from his father's cluches to be a better guy.
Then he caught it, she called him Petra. Tony's blood began to boil. Who the fuck does she think she is? it took the kid months to build up the courage to come out to the team. they had to continually remind him not to look down on himself just because he was born the wrong gender.
He ignores the pummeling feeling in his stomach and focuses on Mary. If anyone asks, she is named after Mary Putnam the frist American Woman to study medicine at the University of Paris.  But anyone who knows him would know that it’s  absolute bullshit and he's naming it after his late mother. (Sorry pops)
"Uh huh, sure we aren’t, and obviously You're going to talk to dad like an adult and not procrastinate. " in moments like these Steve can tell Peter got influenced by Tony's sass.
Flash turned slightly red at the comment and relented for a while since the teacher came in but the whispered comments and spitballs still continued.
"Hey, Penis, why hasn't  your pal Tony Rogers-Stark shown up yet? I bet you made friends with all the Avengers  huh?" Flash tauted, apparently he doesn't care how bad of a day Peter is already having.
"You know loser , I may hate Thompson, but thanks for reminding me that I'm capable of pity." MJ says and before Peter could ask what MJ meant, Flash walked in right before the teacher.
(he may or may not have heard his dad mutter something about being naturally cute and likable and how it's unfair)
"Excuse me? did you just call my son puny penis parker? because I'll have you know he is none of those things." another voice wafted in the room this time followed by a very irate Captain America and his Eyebrows Of Disappointment™.
"Yes, I've been to a few with Pepper, amazing networking platform." Peter blinked at her and then decided he's not stupid enough to risk his life by arguing with MJ of all people. (even if he thought the networking wasn't worth being so stuffy for hours)
Bruce cuts in, "It's fine, Brunnhilde. What happened though? I didn't think I would be included in Asgardian stuff"
"I'm fine Wade, I'm on a field trip... Here." He reassured. Wade gave looked towards their audience, and then gave Peter a critical once over to determine that he was in fact not dying. He seemed to be having a conversation with the boxes.
" That's so sad, FRIDAY play despacito." The song started playing over the speakers inside the lab. "He's my friend, I'm a princess, I can do whatever I want." Peter couldn't withhold a snort at that.
He got closer to the door and locked it and put his ear on the door, It would be hard to tell anything in the panic, but Super hearing definitely helps. Also the people doing the shooting were dressed for combat that made them heavier
Which, Cool!! but it also means he has to suffer through classes without his best friend, and he is not at all about that life choice.
"w-well Ma'am I was- just, just saying, that Peter is a whimp, why is h-he allowed to train with you" Flash says, and Peter wished that he had some way of shutting him up.
"NO SIR! Uh- absolutely not" if nothing else, Flash looked hilarious stumbling over his words like a headless chicken.
"Dude, you, Ned and Shuri sang 'Kiss the Wade' every time I entered a room with you in it for a month, do not expect any sympathy from me" Peter crossed his arms with an air of finality, MJ had her face behind a book, Peter thought she was trying to stop from laughing out loud.
After breakfast, he went to the entrance to get Shuri, and maybe get some nerd out done before she gets to the scorpions.
When the bell rang, Peter practically sprinted out of the room. The only reason he was visible was because he had to keep his identity a secret and he didn't want to leave MJ alone.
The end to her very normal day comes at around ten am. When she's informed 8 people, one red person (whatever that meant)  and one humanoid robot just appeared in front the headquarters.
"Petypie, why can't I shove one of my katanas up his ass and-" Wade was cut off by Steve, "Did you just call my son worthless?" There was a reason why people get scared of Steve Rogers, and Peter was sure Flash was about to find out. The glare Flash was getting could possibly melt steel.
"He didn’t realise that you’ll probably get everyone for that lecture did he?" MJ asks looking at the boy as he walks out of even his hearing range.
She just finished her second sales pitch for DJ roomba and figured that she could spare a glance to who is basically her boss.
"Something You'll find out soon enough!" Cindy smirked at the other boy. Ah she wanted to see the look on his face when he realises who he was bullying.
"Yes ma'am. " Peter sighed. he may face supervillains on a regular basis, but MJ is definitely up there as the scariest peoples he has met. (and he saw a lot of scary people)
"I did not know that. Huh, well look at that, Howard really didn’t know what he was talking about to slutty teenage Tony huh? " he laughed bitterly.
"Oh, uh- yeah they're- our class,  Oh! that's Betty and that's Cindy. " he pointed out the both of them.
"Are you nuts??? My boyfriend walks around with a katana dad!! And you know when it comes to me, his moral compass is a roulette wheel."
"No way bro" gasps dickbag no. 7 as he stares wide eyed at Tyler who looked at them all emperiosly like he actually did anything to warrant it.
"Really son? and why is he a whimp?" Steve questioned and no one noticed Tony and Bucky grab Mr. Shuu to have a talk with him a bit further away.
Thor breaks free, " I suppose it would not do for them to not attend." he says and tries to pindown Steve instead,
"I give you my child so long as my company prospers. " he felt he had lowered himself as a human as he spoke those words.
Ned quirked a brow, "If I paid her to know me, then why did I stop her from talking on about me Flash? I swear sometimes you make no sense. " Ned says and slips closer to Mr. Leroy so Flash would bother him less.
"Also you have been seen to go from school in a black expensive car that has tinted windows for a while"
His excuse of already having enough clothes ran out when he came in with a hole in his "what do you call an acid with an attitude?  A-mean-oh acid" shirt. And well and truly ran out of shirts to wear. He knew he was screwed the moment aunt Natasha and aunt Pepper saw his shirt and shared a grin.
"You know when you said his boyfriend is gonna kill Eleanor, I did not think it was literally " Cindy says faintly.
Tony would like to state that the fact that he's out of the tower right now is absolutely and irrevocably necessary.
"I'm on a field trip  milady FRIDAY ." Ned said. MJ scanned her pass and got a quiet greet from FRIDAY as well. Then, Peter scanned his own pass,
"Drop the Mr. kid and cut the call, he's sleazy and I'm pretty sure he was thinking about getting in your pants." Tony says. Peter sends a disgusted look towards his phone before cutting the call and then throwing it a bit on the couch.
Peter's class mates watched the exchange with wide eyes. It was a bit hard to believe the power couple of all power couples fought so vehemently.... Unless you lived with them, then you'd know that they fought for every tiny single little thing, most of the time just for the sake of fighting.
Steve and Tony aren’t already dating in this, just thought I'd let you know. It’s pretty obvious though.
Bucky was sharing his popcorn with Tony while they watched the god Vs. Veteran and spy unfold and Steve, one of the Occasionally Responsible Adults™ in the Avengers had apparently given up on stopping the fight, and decided to just let them get it out of their systems.
He sees Bucky fall from the train and feels as close to remorse he could get, the other man would have done well in hell. He shrugged later, Bucky could still end up there. Besides, he had something to look forward to.
"Well, well, well, penis, looks like the cat's gonna be out of the bag soon huh, everyone's gonna see how much of a liar you are." Flash tried to taunt,  but honestly Peter was too worried about potential embarrassment by his family to actually  care.
"Yeah, I know I just.... never mind can I go now? I'm tired. " He asked and was met by Steve's nod. Tony, looked up from whatever he was doing on his phone and gave Peter a reassuring smile,
"Well, you know how old eye patches said I'd have to find something to do that isn't my other job and shield was working on a clean slate identity, so turns out your patriotic dad recommended this school. And I didn't want to go here at first, since this is a school for, you know, smart people like you but then Barnes said that you go here and agent Hill did an IQ test turns out I actually have average IQ needed for this school so I told her to sign me the fuck up and I was supposed to come before lunch and everything but I got held up at shield for initiation process and I know this is gonna be last class but I really wanted to find you!" Wade explained a mile a minute.
"Trust me, you don't want to say anything bad about Peter in front of him. You really don't " Cindy warned before letting his mouth go.
"O-of course Mr. Rogers-Stark, there will be no more misunderstandings about the adoption at all." the man answered careful to get the name right after not so gently being reminded that it is Rogers-Stark and not Rogers in the beginning of the meeting.
"My fathers aren’t here yet. They're running late. " he steeled himself waiting for the other man's response.
Steve huffs. " 'Course we will.  Failure isn’t an option." he says and really take his time to remind himself that what he says is true. "How are Pete and Nat doing? "
"It may seem like the safety is a bit extreme, but well, the things coming here explode all the time. So we need to be ready, you can see the experiments happenning from the glass view above unless they darken the glass. You can stick around with me, and I'll introduce you to the other interns working here.” he barely finished when a boom came from one of the adjacent doors in the labs.
All they had to do was go through whoever was in the warehouse and that was it. Steve frowned even as he was running at the warehouse from about a block away.
Today I was told that "its not natural for two guys to be together "  let me tell you just because I'm from the forties,  does not mean I've never seen two men together or that it makes it wrong -see more
Person against giving the latest helping bot to Red cross : IT'S NOT NOTHING STARK! JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A MILLIONAIRE WHO DOESN’T CARE -
"Well, OK I wouldn't do that to all the students, but if your homophobic ass of a teacher so much as looks at you funny he's gonna need a new identity on the other side of the world." Tony says.
So Peter had to hold them off for at least that long without giving up his identity.  Ok, he can do this.
"Besides It's rude to out someone without asking them" Bucky added nodding along because as Steve mentioned before, his best friend is an ass. Steve ignored him.
"but I have a tour to lead here."  The other intern looked even more frazzled. And then she noticed Peter.
"Babyboy, come on It's 11 time to get up. " Peter grumbled but made no effort to get out of the Cozy cocoon of blanket around him.
Steve closes his eyes, purses his lips and sighs through his nose.  Barnes smirks, leans closer to him and whispers something to him, he sighs out loud this time but he has a slight smile on his face, she doesn't know what that's about, but can't be that bad.
After the shopping spree they took him on to buy him an entire wardrobe he can positively say that his aunts have a thing for buying him things. Which is not surprising given that everyone apparently  wanted to buy him things.
"You should, ha ha,  you should tell them now since They're gonna figure it out anyway. " MJ choked out before laughing again.
Their badges didn’t say much it was white and had the number one on it. Which was probably why Betty had no idea that it was them coming to the tour.
Seeing Wade's face light up like Christmas tree, even when his face is covered in a mask, he decides that MJ's analogy of them being the puppy type boyfriends is absolutely correct
"Yeah, FRY, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell anyone I'm here?" Peter added the last part in a hushed tone to keep his classmates from listening.
"Oh my god, why can't they just kiss and put us out of our misery?" Abe whispered to her. She snickered.
" inherited what?" Steve questions as he came out of the cockpit, probably relinquishing the copilot duties to Bucky.
"Tony? Stark? oh my god! you've grown so much!" she went up to him and tried to hug him, her arms didn't go completely around him.
Peter sighed, "Guys, come on, can we not do this right now? I kinda have to lead the tour now that Sara had to be pulled away, and it's getting kinda overwhelming." Never let it be said that Peter Parker had ineffective puppy eyes.
"What are you doing here?" Peter asks letting go of his boyfriend pulling him along to meet his friends.
"I think your streak is waaay more important, don't you think guys?" Peter's eyes were wide and signalling them to agree.
° Thor and Bucky wrestling as Steve referees. Sam and Rhodey share popcorn and natasha runs on a treadmill.  °
"Alright, so the idea is that Peter and Sam will be sparring and Clint will shoot randomly to take account of Peter's spider sense, ether or would be too easy." Peter nodded and went to the mat with his uncles, Clint taking out non lethal arrows. and Sam grumbling about how unfair training with superhumans is.
"I'm afraid I can't do that, Boss has already been informed, and I imagine it wouldn't take long for the rest to know either." FRIDAY replied in a low volume in a speaker closest to Peter so that only he could hear. Peter groaned,
................. That was a good prank, MJ still has the footage from Natasha throwing knives at Wade)
As they were going to their destination, Peter took in the familiar roads of New York. Ned excitedly chattering next to him. Wait.... That building? And that one? And...... Actually, the roads are becoming a bit too familiar for his liking.
"Lookie here our freaks becoming a hero!" Tyler announced jovially with his friends laughing with him. Wade rolled his eyes.
Eleanor blinked, they could tell it wasn’t a reaction she expected from Peter. She gaped at him for a while before Peter answered Himself,
Actually....... he squinted his eyes, that was his hoodie, the one he thought was stolen. He has not seen that hoodie in a week. Who would-
Cindy pouted, because she is an employee dam it! Did she mention there is no need for her to take this tour? Because there is no need for her to take this tour.
Alfred asked if he was Ok when he got back. He waved the other boy off too. Though he was sure Ned told him about what Ms. Terry said if the dark looks he keeps giving her is any indication.
"No! Why would you- NO! Of coures we aren’t " and Jesus christ he did not know that Peter could look so judgemental.
"I am not mooning over Bruce brother. And I most definitely am not pining!" he refuses as he does everytime Loki brings it up.
"SON OF LEEDS! Great to have you here again! " Thor places a hand on his shoulder in a position Ned vividly remembers his dad uses when he's about to try to say Memes.
Peter sighed, there was no use to hide it now, the avengers and Wade caught the scent, they'll do whatever it takes to find out what happened to Peter.
Peter froze for as long as it took his family to process what Flash said and immediately grabbed Wade's hands as they were reaching for a gun.
There is a group of about 10? 12 people, they're together so they're probably looking for something.  Armed if the gunshot was any indication.
The bus arrived at the tower. Ned counted down the last moments his classmates still thought that the Avengers were cool.
@ america's ass please come get your man he's been staring at the holograms for the last 15 minuts unblinking and I'm worried
Case in point, right now his mind is refusing to think of anything other than the worst case scenario,  and really, thinking about all the time he had seen his husband injured really doesn’t help.
"I don't see him talking his way out of that situation without a.... What did Peter call it? Boyfriend at the very least."
Ned craned his neck to see that they were running from Bucky covered in pink slime coming after them so maybe they were running for their lives.
So Peter took the card and placed it on his table and things kept piling on it and after a day, he had no idea where the card was. He saw it when he was moving his things from the apartment, and he knows he has it somewhere in his room, but.... Yeah,  He has no idea where his access card is.
Flash probably saw his life flash before his eyes. But before the Avengers could chew his head out, Tony and Bucky came back with a Mr. Shuu who looked ready to cry.
"Yeah, don't worry about it it was just a picture of me. I kinda still want to see your crush, but if it makes you too uncomfortable I wont pry." he shrugs.
He didn’t even realize that he was nodding. Then it occurred to him, Tony would do anything in his power to get the book now. He could see it in the determination in his face. Why oh why did he find it so cute?
The class was transfixed. They saw the boy everyday, they knew him as a whimp, when the hell did he get agile enough to fight two people at the same time? the fight ended with the Falcon tapping out and Peter dodging yet another arrow.
"You know, some of Dr. Strange's magic is actually hand wavy physics. Like what happen here is a tear in space and time or something, that's what he said right? We'll probably be able to go back when time rights itself" the boy says looking thoughtful.
"yeah I'm fine, just got a detention. " Happy made a noncommittal noise of acknowledgement and began driving. the rest of the drive was in silence.
Oh and how he would love to have a talk with the traffic police on the streets how do they not notice the car that has no freaking licence plate.
Peter could not believe his ears, Wade in the same school as him? He would have to thank his pops and Agent Hill so much after this!
But he knew that he had. He knew that he had no other choice, That more than anything is what encouraged him to prick his thumb to spill the drop of blood in the fire.
As she opened the door though, she, along with the rest of the group was gaping at the sight presented to them,
Tony scoffed, then scoffed again, and scrunched up his face like he sucked on a particularly thick lemon.
Then he proceeded to board the bus. Why oh why did his school have to hold a field trip to the Avengers tower?
"Well, Peter was not allowed to come to the trip so as the person with authority here, I say that he can't go in." Mr. Tritter says with a air of finality. Peter rolled his eyes.
"Betty?" he mouthed back subly inclining his head towards the girl in question . Cindy grinned and nodded.
"Hey dad!!!!!! I- uh left my phone home when I went out." he says sounding too peppy for even his own ears
"LATE training, and also, only the morning training session. I'll even let you all out of the evening session if you want."  Steve bargained. That seemed to work, the present avengers cheered and got up to let the rest of them know.
Peter resisted the urge to roll his eyes. He was pretty sure he handled technology and criminals better than her thank you very much.
Peter shrugged as he washed his hands. There was probably a prank involved in all the gyms, it wouldn't be the first time. He perched on the back of Wade's chair, waiting for him to finish so he could climb on his back.
"Hey, Peter man, don't listen to her, you're Peter, you're a guy no matter what she says." Ned tried to console him. He didn't  see MJ or Shuri approach, but both of them gave him a side hug. MJ gave the back of their teacher's head a murderous glare.
HE IS NOT SELLING DRUGS!!!!! Jesus Christ,  he's  spiderman for heavens sake why would.....  Oh, the clothes!
"Not to mention his aunt might also be coming and she is gonna be pissed about mistreatment of her spiderson." MJ pointed out Peter groaned and took his seat. Ned patted his back. Although unsympathetically.
Peter sends him a glare, "that's NOT what I said. That's the opposite of what I said. Dad please don't get my boyfriend to murder my classmate"
Steve frowned, brought his hands on Tony's shoulders and squeezed lightly.  Howard had always been a sore subject. It seemed to be a mistake at his point though.
Today this fckn Dudebro had the actual Gall to tell me that the Avengers should be against same sex marriage. He said that to my face. Like some of us fight crime in spandex you think we're what? Straight?
However Peter thought it was a little bit of a overreaction to give him an entire month of detention for forgery that he didn't commit.
"Remember how none of you believed him when he said Peter had a internship? why would he think you would've believed him about the adoption?" she looked towards Ms. Terry,
"Enough about that boy though Steve! You have to tell me what happens in the future! Does flying cars exist yet? What happen to my company?  I bet Obi kept it the top weapons company in the world!"  Peggy questioned her friendship with the man not for the first time.
"Who the fuck was that penis? Where did you get two avenger look a likes? How did you even manage to bring them inside the building?" So on and forth, Peter was thanking uncle Bruce in his head for those self control yoga classes. But even then his patience was nearing it's limits.
"Are they coming?" Officer pennington asks in a tone that implies that if they weren’t she'd drive him herself and give his parents a piece of her mind while She's at it. She was great to work with on the domestic abuse cases. But fortunately he doesn’t need her help in this particular case.
"As a concerned parent, and as the person who pays a lot for the school fund, you'll find that I will in fact do that." Tony bit out.
Fishlegs just smiles like he gets that a lot, judging from his name, he probably does, Betty steps off the elevator with him and Cindy stays back with Francine
Bruce is, for lack of a better term extremely guarded. It took him months to even open up enough to talk freely to everyone.
His class stared back at him, with Ned and MJ clutching their stomachs from laughing too hard. Flash had his mouth open, and so did Mr. Collins. He looked towards Alice to see her giving him questioning glances.
"Alright, kids, remember to behave, and don't give any of the staff any trouble." Ms Terry was going through the usual talk about keeping a good image of Midtown high that all of them are going to ignore anyway. Ms. Terry was, as usual ignoring everything Flash was saying to Peter.
Steve couldn’t breath. He could hear the rush of his blood  There was nothing but ruble before him. Even if there was someone in there, they wouldve- they wouldn’t-
He slowly began walking towards tony and who are likely his captors.  He'd run but he was pretty sure his knees are buckling too hard for him to not faceplant and injure himself in the rubble.
"As, Friday just said before I'm here to talk on behalf of d-er To-um Mr. Rogers-Stark. " Peter stumbled. "
teacher. Because of "confidential internship " reasons. She just wanted to go back to SI. (Also their last surprise trip had been to the freaking Zoo and they both were bored out of their minds.)
Peter looked towards Ned, "Hey Ned, doesn't the route look familiar?" He asked his best friend as he took a breath from talking.
"My boyfriend. " Peter answers deadpan. Wade wanted Peter to save his name under "💀💩L" but Peter said it was embarrassing....... ( As opposed to all the heart Emoji.  His mind supplies helpfully )
"And you're an ass. Come on Nat who else can I ask? " Steve practically whined and punched the "indestructible " punching bag.
"I literally had nothing to do with the holograms. I wasn't even touching the phone!" Peter exclaimed.
She nodded. Right. She could do this. She got the job because She's capable of it and She's going to prove it.
he was wondering if he could hang out with anyone of the team to take a break when Friday called out,
He has regular teenager problems, then there are superhero problems, and of course problems like Flash Thompson and the fact the his dad drop kicked his boyfriend from a 90 story building the first time he introduced them.
In fact one could even say It's essencial. All the while he was also painfully aware that literally none of his family members would agree with him.
"Oui, now, let's get the two of you set up in your departments!  You're in marketing and you’re in reasearch right now right?" she points to Betty and Cindy respectively.
"And why would the king of Wakanda give you any power?" Flash sneered. Peter's face darkened somewhat but the girl just shrugged.
And it really doesn't hurt that Bruce is one of the cutest people he met. The way he pretends not to pay attention to not get in conflict. The way his lips frown downwards when he sees anyone of the Avengers and friends persue their particular bad habit.
"What the heck is he even doing here?" Eleanor  said out loud. It came out louder than she probably expected it to because everyone was looking at her.
They kissed and it set off fireworks inside Steve's  heart. He felt like he was getting lighter and floating away. Tony's lips the only thing keeping him grounded.  He'd happily never leave that moment if it were up to him.
He supposes he wouldn't know, all the physical exercise he got in the building is walking in the gyms with Peter when the other boy had training.
Steve was pretty sure he looked calm. Not relaxed, god no, that eould require his husband unhurt, not kidnapped and preferably within arm's reach. But disregarding that he probably had what his family called a resting bitchface, he looked calm, in control even.
They reached the gym and Peter could hear people inside. He frowned, this gym is strictly for avengers or higher level S.H.I.E.L.D personel. But no one actually practices here because they prefer sparring. And this one is not meant for that. He owns the doors, and...... Wow, Peter has never been more unimpressed while seeing the avengers workout before.
"Anyway-" MJ interrupts.  "This cannot get out of SI. And by that I mean no one in our school can know any of us work here."
Sure he had MJ, bur the girl could care less about Lego or star wars... it's just not the same without Peter. Besides what's a guy in the chair to do without his spiderman? (the "wait for you to come back" meme comes to his head, he quickly dismisses it.)
They were both a bit behind on the mordern references thing, they both were inhumanely strong, they both liked to pretend being clueless and innocent to mess with people, and they were both hopelessly in love with geniuses .
"Friday? maybe you should gave warned me that my class is coming to the tower?" he says waving hello to Ned and MJ.
"I still do not see why you need a Ravengers meeting, Bruce just got home from the month long voyage, you could have at least let him rest." Thor scowls at the laptop that was set up for them for the "Emergency Revangers Meeting "
The intern that was waiting for them however looked like someone from marketing so she's not directly under his wing.
"And..... The intern is a.... Strict person?" she asks cautiously.  She probably would be on her toes too if she knew what was going on.
Peter looked towards Ned, who looked like he was barely holding on his tirade about going on an adventure. His best friend looked too excited about the trip for him to tell him he had a bad feeling about this.
"And where is your menace of a boyfriend?" Shuri asked deciding she didn't like Flash an doesn't really care about what he has to say.
"So at Stark industries, we also put an emphasis on the employees health. As it is, there are three different gyms in the levels one through 80. There are, of course more advanced gyms in the higher levels, but those are equipped for superhumans and S.H.I.E.L.D agents.-"
The older man of the three's eyes twinkle, "I think- " he says smiling gently at Peter,  "that a demonstration is in order to make him believe you beter" he waves his hand at the general direction of the sceptical judge.
"Pfffffffffft" the sound of two people laughing confused Mr. Stewart,  he expected confusion, screaming maybe telling him to keep it under the wraps what he didn't expect was the sound of two people laughing and another one joining soon after.
Ned took a seat at the front and away from Flash. Without Flash pestering him, he remembered that he was panicking for a reason.
"They got ripped cause of a fight you had with druggies Parker? " Flash mocked. Peter wondered if he had something to do with this.
"Yeah, that's tougher, especially since he's a trouble magnet." Peter's mouth quirked a little and Clint shook his head a little,  " don't give me that look, you inherited that..... From the entirety of the avengers but whatever."  that earned him a huff.
Two more charged him and he ducked. They weren’t  trained very well considering they were all pretty raged and went with the predictable right hook first.
"Uh, Deadpool!  What are you doing here?!" Eleanor asks nervously and looks around where she is there are a few employees miling about, but her class is standing a little too far, and nobody seemed to realised the mercenary was there.
"Groveling won't get you out of punishment Mr. Parker, unless you could get Tony Stark to come and say that he signed your slip, you're gonna have to do the detentions. " Mr. Shuu says with a sneer on his face.
Peter internally groaned,  ever since he fixed one of her formulas on the board, the woman started hating him with a burning passion. he dreaded to think what she had planned now.
The guys have kevlar and about half of them have guns. Their ski masks didn’t have any particular different between them, other than the colours. Some were dark brown, some navy blue and one black. There were twelve of them unless they have backup waiting and Peter really wishes he had any kind of weapon.
Steve, Bucky and Sam disappeared from the Gym leaving a two swinging punching bags and a running treadmill.
"Wait, stop please, Sara, I'm not really that special, and besides, there's a tour?" Peter cut her off pointing at his gobsmacked peers bar Ned and MJ , and she seemed to come to her senses and began distributing passes to everyone mumbling something that sounded suspiciously like 'Peter Parker knows my name'
His spider sense went off and he ducked, noticed a fist out of the corner of his eye, grabbed it, yanked it and judo flipped the guy, turnes out it was one of the guy he threw the other guy at.
"Mr. Parker, that was incredibly dangerous. While I do realise that they were about to kidnap you,  you shouldn’t have dismissed the dangers so easily. " Ms. Lanister says glancing and away from Bob.
Ever since Nat and Pep came out people has been asking me about them being a part of LGBTQ+ and my thoughts as an ally.
"Why is it your first conclusion that I -the brilliant mind that I am- did something wrong?" Peter looked at Steve,
"Shut up and give me the goddamn watch!" the goon growls and the sound of a slap echoing the room had Peter grit his teeth.
Peter took a breath after he finished rambling, he looked at his family,  most of their faces were hardened, even Bruce had a frown.
"So You're the one making him support the fags huh. Makes sense-" he looks towards his pops, oh boy "you gonna just stand this? It's not natural for two guys to be together! "
"Nothing rash? Dad you threatened to sue the school, and that was after threatening to pull all your donations."
"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY TO HIM YOU PIECE OF ASS SHIT? HAVE YOU BEEN BULLYING HIM?" Deadpool yelled out, Flash getting paler every step he took closer to him.
"What the Fuck did you just say to him you piece of shit?" Clint Barton stepped towards Flash, Peter had just enough time to stand between the two of them.
Captain America opposes Homophobic group and tells them, "If gay people are going to hell, then I guess I'll see you there" coming out as Bisexual.
"Peter, I need you to know that I have been in trouble plenty of times in my life, Steve can and will attest to that, repeatedly, so I can say with authority that that 'Hey dad' is way to enthusiastic for you to not be in trouble. "
Peter was glad for his super hearing, because without that he wouldn't hear Steve growl softly. His pops gets /really/ possessive over his dad. Tony frowned slightly like he didn't want to answer, but nodded to Flash anyway.
"And what exactly...." Natasha looked from Howard to Tony and back to Howard, " do you mean by there is no way for him to be Anthony ?  Besides he just said that his name is Tony" she raises an eyebrow to emphasise her point.
Peter was tense. He had a feeling all day that something was about to happen, not that the day has even started yet, but you get the point.
"Hello there kiddies, hope you're all having a good time here." he sounded so fake that Peter wondered if the rest of the class could see through the facade, by the cheering that occurred right after his words, they didn't catch on.
"You did a great job kid, there was already five cases of missing kids that these guys kidnapped, they're gonna be behind bars for a long time. You should be proud." she patted Peter's back.
Her words hit Peter like a punch to the gut. he hadn't been called Petra for years, he was Peter. He's a boy damn it why would she say that?  She left and probably took all the self confidence that took him months to build with her.
Cindy got a good look at the front page, then opened the magazine and flipped through, blinked a couple of times then rubbed her eyes to make sure she was seeing right.
"Kids remember to behave. You're going to the technological capital of America and misbehaviour won't be excused." Mr. Leroy called out.
Maybe he was getting too used to deal with shady people who are actually nice while hanging out with Wade. But really how was he supposed to know that those guys weren’t the nice kind of shady people?
"So he passed out on the horn and the horn went kept going off and it was really annoying.  But the first guy pushed him off and tried to grab the stearing wheel but he didn’t realise a police car was patrolling close.
"You sure did, come on tour guide, let's get on with the tour. " Cindy patted her best friend and the group left the lab.
Just before they reached the Floor 15 a frazzled looking  young man got in the elevator. He took up...  A bit more space than normal, he looked friendly enough though.
Mr. Stewart stared at the phone as though it was about to come to life and bite him. Peter wouldn't put it past Karen if he did something to really piss her off
"Tell the Avengers to meet in somewhere, .....room no..... 43? Yeah, there tell everyone to meet there."
"I paid her nothing Flash, besides, it's..... Kinda embarrassing being being recognized" not that he believed that he won't be recognized when they got inside the tower, but that was the problem of Peter Stark-Rogers ten minutes into the future. Flash just scoffed and pushed pass him to grab his pass.
So while his classmates cheered and talked excitedly,  Peter folded his hand on his desk, puts his  face on his hands, and groaned.
He tries not to think about the moving  too much,...... Tries not to think about the reason for him moving too much.  He shakes his head and stops his thoughts from taking a dark turn just in time as Megan finishes calling the names from the passes in the box.
"I'm going to give you all visitor badges. These babies are going to give you access for twenty four hours. So if you leave something after the fair you must retreave it within twenty-four hours starting from the moment you swipe the cards." she says pulling out a card from a box next to her.
Cindy looked towards the room to see an old man coming out of the room he was laughing and whooping for some reason.
Peter pressed the panic button in his watch. And there was a little red blink to tell him that the message was sent.
"Is it the clothes? I told him his old science pun shirts looks like nobody loves him. And he should try his new wardrobe. " Tony jokes, as he normally does to defuse the situation before doing something drastic.
"Not that he wouldn't be able to buy them with his own allowance,  but they insisted to buy them for him" Steve  added.
The bell rang and all the students scattered. If Peter saw Shuri smiling like a fool or MJ doodling something suspiciously like M+S, well..... he lives among scary women enough to know pointing it out would end badly for him.
"I'm not telling you." Natasha says as she keeps on running on the treadmill, not even out of breath.
Steve shook his head no and stood up raising the sketch book away from Tony when the shorter man reached for it. He wasn’t lying,  it wasn’t something dirty, It's just....  This is his Tony Sketchbook.  Sure there are other drawings of Tony  in other books, but this one es dedicated specifically focused on Tony and well, it'd look stalkerish if Tony saw it.
"So, you think he has a mystery crush?" Peter asks watching his father scoop up more icecream into his bowl.
"Hey sure I get it, but you think Thor's gonna ruin a friendship over that? Besides, why are you so sure that you're gonna get rejected? "
Wade thinks it over then shrugs, popping a piece of pancake in his mouth, "Sure, eye patches doesn't have anything for me to see, so why not?"
He thought for a while and decided on gym, his pops is probably putting the team through their paces again.
"Great, bye, other people need to pay attention to Their own projects and stuff too" Tony says aloud to the room. Everyone jolts and turns back to what they were doing pretending that they were never listening in the first place.
So anyway it's Friday, he's sitting in the back of the bus heading to Stark tower and had to wake up at five o' fucking clock because the bus left at six and the teacher Mr.
Granted that he actually did do that, mostly because Peter is his son. Still since nobody actually knew this piece of information,  no one could actually blame him for not believing Peter.
"Peter, start from the top now. What happened and who do I need to kill." ah, and uncle Bucky was with them too..... Great.
"Hey Flash, maybe you should have the decency to talk about someone to their face. Oh wait sorry I forgot who I was talking to." Ned grit out.
"I don't see what we have to talk about"  Tony says,  throwing his hands up as they got off the elevator.
The door breaks off it's hinges and the barrels of guns comes in the room before the men do. Peter could have probably beaten them but he doesn’t want to risk one of the students or Ms. Lanister to get shot at.
And what if the teachers are sometimes blinder than fucking Daredevil and only notice things when Wade starts to retaliate, he
"Talking to yourself Rogers?" Peggy says as she enters the room. He knows she didn't hear what he said, he didn't say it loud enough.
Ned blinked, he never realised that there was any gyms in the lower levels, though knowing Tony, it makes sense.
"Wait? Wait? Wade no, what are you gonna wait for? There’s nothing to wait for! Wade?" Betty calls but the mercenary ignores her and walks away,
Mr. Yelli got up and tried throwing a punch at Peter who caught it and yanked him throwing him back at his goons using his own weight.
"Huh, didn’t peg itty bitty kids to be the noble type. " he says then grabs hold of Abe By the hair and yanks him forward, holding the gun to his head.
"It's fine, let's go Dr. Odinson-Banner you need to see the code!  Come on!" Ned practically dragged the man out.
"Wow, you actually took a break, is there an apocalypse we should know about?" Clint grinned. Tony rolled his eyes.
"Excuse me, Dr. Odinson-Banner,  how do you know Leeds" Flash asks elbowing himself towards the front of the group.
"I know we're surprised too!" Wanda exclaimed with false cheer. Peter raised an eyebrow and Wade was cackling in the background.
Tony turned towards the teacher, "uh, yo, teacher person over there, I'm just gonna take my son and go since your tour is over in a while, FRIDAY'll get you another tour guide if you need it." That being said, Tony walked to Peter grabbed him, turned to Wade, "you get one point for the katana in the ass thing" and walked out the door with Steve and an extremely gleefull Wade in tow.
Peter groaned and Clint smirked threw him a salute and left. Ned patted his shoulder while MJ smirked at Flash. The other boy seemed to realise that yes, it might be a bad idea to go after Peter.
"I swear it wasn’t my fault! There isn’t even anything wrong!  I just had to give a statements and they wanted someone to pick me up cause they think I'm traumatised or something " he desides as soon as the words come out of his mouth that he should never be allowed to deffuse situations ever.
Asdfghjkl Hawkeye and Flacon just got into a debate on who's the best uncle. @ perky how do you know them?
"Well, by the power vested in me by the king of Wakanda, I overrule you." a girl their age says from the side petting the mechanical spider that Mr. Tritter threw a while ago.
Peter discarded that idea as soon at it popped in his head. His fathers were the two most headstrong people in the planet. It sometimes felt like a wonder that they even are together. They don't know when to quit, so obviously that's not what happened.
5. Not asking where the field trip was going when it was first announced and he wasn't paying attention.
Peter nodded. "I know, I just- i don't want him to get more injured I guess." and Clint grimaced at that.
"Oh no that's really not necessary!  I could just walk home from here!" he yelped. Walk,  swing, you know, semantics.
"And is a student's accessories what the teachers talk about in school nowadays?  I don't think you should have mentioned the drugs thing in front of other students even if he was actually buying or selling drugs" Aunt Natasha piped up.
From the texts Ned got in the past four days, Peter has been attending galas charity events and board meetings under the guise of the heir of SI who will be made public in a few months.
"I was hoping to avoid any kind of confrontation between my fathers and the School." Peter sighed. He reached the class they had together. Which was - thankfully - their second last class of the day
Tony stops as he took a look at the class and the assorted knocked out goons. He deigned that he wasn’t in immediate danger of getting shot so he practically jumped out of the suit.
Steve changes the page he was drawing as casually as he can without Tony noticing It's content. It wasn’t like Tony thought Steve never drew him, he drew everyone,  especially his teammates, heck there was one of his spider-man and Ironman skeches on Tony's lab wall. It's just this one was .....  A bit risque from what Tony knew Steve drew.
Ned  snickered and Peter frowned at Flash. Ned scanned his pass with a quiet greeting and told Friday why they were there.  Peter scanned his next,
"Coffee is life sustenance and I'm doing everyone a favour by making it easy to attain." Peter raised an eyebrow at that.
: and I worry for him. He just… gives so much of himself and then people hates him for the mistakes he made before and it sucks. Because that just makes Wade hate himself even more and I hate it when that happens.
"That's because Peter's right and you're both dense as concrete. " Natasha input and Peter nodded along.
"Wow, Eleanor, if you project anymore, you might be able to become a full time projector and help making presentations. And do you know what lesbian means? Come on spell it with me, L - E -S -"
By the time the bell rang to signal the end of the day, Peter almost put the whole incident in the back of his mind, it really won't do him much good just thinking about it.
"Give Mr. Stewart temporary access. " he hoped she understood that he meant without  anything spiderman related.
(Picture of Peter in with the avengers all in civilian clothes having dinner Peter sitting between Tony and Wade while flicking peas at a unaware clint. Natasha looks on amused)
"Shuri you don't mind waiting for a minute right?" Steve asked with his all American sweet and charming facade on.
"Mr. Tritter, if he doesn't have an internship, how did he get in the building? you just saw him talking to the AI." MJ pointed out looking like..... well she was surrounded by idiots.
The problem is that he drew attention to himself so he can't juat slip out of a corner and change into his suit. Given that he'd have to take his bag with him too, he had no chance to get out.
"What about the windows?" she frowns, looking out, then suddenly her eyes widen as she sees something out the window.
To add to that, in case he does like men Steve has a plan, he'd probably get Tony to like him back by....... Three years or so, but that's ok, he can be patient. (A/N Why are you like this)
"This is the secondery room for the interns in marketing, this is where I work right now, but I actually started working in the floor right below. So in case any one was thinking about joining the marketing - " before she could finish, she was approached by another intern.
The bell rang and Peter hurried out of the door. He did not want to be the target of insistent questions from his classmates, It appears that he wasn't fast enough however,
He knows he's going to kill some of them with his own bare hands. He could kill them in a glance, but no. He's going to break every single bone in their hands. Peel the skin off where they touched Tony.
There is a thump on a chair right behind him. And he berates himself on not being aware enough of his surroundings to realize that someone came that close.
Nevermind that Peter has a boyfriend and Cindy is an out and proud lesbian, Half the school thought it was true, which is....... Just sad really considering they were supposed to be some of the brightest minds in their area.
"Nah, you're really caring, and everyone comes to you with problems to get them solved, ergo team mom."
"Welcome to Stark tower. Or more commonly known as The Avengers Tower. Home of science, Avengers, and sleep deprived scientists " their tour guide chuckled.  She seemed like a nice lady, Peter has seen her around. He thinks her name is Megan. But he did not think he could handle how sunny she looked for 8. In. The freaking. Morning.
MJ walked in with a phone to her ear Starbucks in a hand and the crowd parting for her like the sea did for Moses.
Steve frowned and looked towards Natasha, she nodded at him to do it and his worries increased, Clint is a prankster, and Sam helps occasionally, sure, but what got Natasha in their plans?
"If you're asking what Tony's sexuality is, you should ask Tony." she says still not winded. It sometimes makes Steve wonder if the Red Room really didn’t enhance her in any way.
"Midtown- er - Midtown high, Mr. Rogers-Stark, It's an honour to see you all in person." Mr. Leroy practically falls over himself.
Peter narrowed his eyes, "your schedule?  Don't crack jokes, you're not a superhero,  you don't invent stuff half as much as dad does- you don't, I read your old files - and that's besides the point that SI is so much smaller now than in the future.  And you can't make time for your son who's four. I'm fifteen and dad still makes time for me and the rest of the family. "
"Hey freako, saw you weren't paying attention to the tour." Jessie's best friend sidles up beside him, idly forking over her salad in the plastic box.
Peter nodded and turned towards where he had lain a dummy for Mary to operate on. His father....... Had fun with the dummy,
"And not my business?  That's hysterical.  You were about to assault my son. The heck do you mean not my business? "
She sometimes wonders how Peter doesn’t let it bother him. Flash and his group has been doing this since middle school, and Peter never not even once retaliated. Heck, if it were her, she would have killed Flash twice by now.
"DUDE! You don't think we're going...... There are we!" Ned whispered seeming to be much more excited at the note than Peter would have liked him to be.
"Hey! Wade, man it is so good to see you! listen, could you do me a favour? actually its more like a favour to Peter, can you do that?"
"Uh, yeah, sure, let's go" he waved at Alice just as she got through the door, and left with his family.
"Since you're all guests you will be given a temporary Omega access. Your access will be invalid when the tour ends. And you can't use them to come in the tower later. I'd advise you to stay in the designated area and keep your passes visible at all time. Our head of security gets a little..... Unhappy otherwise. " Ned snorted at the joke.
: which is to say they don't have a single ounce of self esteem between the two of them. But they chug the loving boyfriend juice on the daily.
Even if just a little bit. Even if it was just a fraction of what Thor felt for him, he would fight for the man's heart.
Bruce is like a clam. closed off but with a hidden gem, Thor will not be the reason for him to be closed off like a clam again.
Peter really didn't want to spend an hour each month listening to Steve's PSA's (especially since he's the guy Peter calls pops and he knows for a fact that Steve barely followed a rule in his goddamn life) but he apparently didn't have much of a choice.
"So Mr. Morita I really hope that that will clear any questions anyone would have about the adoption? " Steve smiled an all American boy sweet smile as though he and his husbands weren't grilling the principal and the teacher for the last half hour.
'wonder how he convinced him' and nope nope nope nada he does not need to think about how his Dad convinced his Pops to do ANYTHING thank you very much. Damn his super hearing.
He was working on some of his codes when he saw Deadpool running for his life. Peter perched on his shoulder leaning down as to not get knocked on the head by door frames.
See, before the adoption, Tony gave him a security card with custom access (which just means everywhere unless the occupants of the room specifically asks for people to be kept out.) but he also coded Peter to be allowed in with a quick check to his DNA through scans.
"You know my pointy sticks are probably getting ichy, I should do something about that. " he says thoughtfully.
When Mr. Warren was finally done with the headcount he lead the group towards the reception area a young neat blonde woman was sitting at the desk, typing away at her computer, Peter recognizes her as Emily .
"Oh, yeah sure old man, remember that we're going to Italy right after this. Ok, be quick" Tony kisses his cheek.
Ned sighed as the bell rung another day in the hell scape called highschool, he's usually a little (emphasis on little) bit more upbeat, but it's been four days without Peter being there and Ned. Is. Bored.
"Alright first things first, you all need to stand in a line in front of the ID detector " she pointed at the Machine.
"Jesus Christ Flash, keep your voice down do you want to get killed?" Betty hissed out. Keeping an eye out towards the direction Wade went to make sure the other boy did not come back for Flash's head while Cindy clamped a hand on his mouth and glared Eleanor down to say something.
"Does everyone have their security passes?" Peters words broke the silence that befell them and a screaching voice yelled, "What the fuck Parker? How much did you pay her to let you do this?"
Peter can feel the entire hallway freeze and look at the spectacle that is his friendlife. (meh, his family is a bigger mess so he's not that bothered.)
By the time he reached home, his pops was already making breakfast. He and his Dad, (who is a hypocrite because he has terrible sleep schedule too) wanted him to stay home and rest for the day. Peter begged off saying that he had a test. (which went better than he expected). a compromise was made that he would rest tomorrow and patrol early today.
"Who is this?" Mr. Stewart asks pointing at the contact name that was basically a string of all the heart Emojies in his phone.
He knew it was because they won the National decathlon tournament, and they were given a chance to explore. But it was Peter who gave the winning answer this year and MJ was the one who made sure everyone kept their head in the game and they're not even going to the trip.
"He won’t, he doesn’t care what you look like, and I know he told you this before, don't think I don't, and the most important part is that he loves you. Also he sure as shit doesn’t like you getting hurt so don't hurt yourself if you don’t want him to be pissed." Betty patted and soothed.
"Mr. Shuu, please, I  swear I didn't forge this, you can call my....." he didn't get a chance to finish.
: hey Ned, Michelle is Peter ok? He got red all of a sudden and now hes just… face down on the table?
The avengers that were in the room made eye contact and simultaneously made their way towards the elevator.
"You don't think that right?" Betty asks bewildered.  Peter and Wade were possibly the most enamored couple she had ever seen. They were the perfect mix of the honeymoon phase and the old married couple. Why would Wade ever think Peter would ever leave him was beyond her
"Uh, she is my robot. Her name is Mary. And She's made to help redcross medics in combat situations. "
"Nope! The people in the upper PR said Ms. Jones was working on this for a while, and they cleared it a week ago. These were taken in Wakanda!" she pointed at the photos.
Peter took a deep breath. But before he could say anything someone beat him to it, and boy it is not pretty,
"You can't so that!" Flash protested, Tony raised an eyebrow, "I'm Tony Rogers-Stark. I do what I want."
But none of that trumped the last two men. Two men that she thought to be dead. Sgt. Barnes and Steve Rogers looked at her wide eyed mirroring her shock.
(Picture of Flash with a battle in the background there are robots and he got Captain America's back in frame.)
"You had shacles and a lock. Who the fuck in this day and age uses shacles and a lock, you took me in a lab. Do you even know who I am buddy? I can probably sue you for incompetence right now and I'd win."
:and he's really funny. Sometimes his jokes get a little depressing and sometimes a little… ah, R rated i suppose but he really is funny. I've never laughed as hard as I had since I met him.
I'll be hear for a month, so definitely working on R2d2 at some point also *eyes emoji* "Pining idiots are hard to handle" as though you weren't one.
The figure wearing the hoodie turned for a brief moment and Peter's eyes bugged out. He ignored Ned's questioning looks to stare mouth agape at the person standing a few meters ahead,
"Come along now. I zhink i just saw ze lab director. " Francine calls Cindy. She follows her all the while gawking at the equipment.
"Aww ребенок паук you're ruining my fun. I wanted him to sweat for a while." She's still not winded seriously what is up with this woman.
OK, so maybe he's a bit more salty than he lets on, but come on, he could program these in his sleep!
Peter ignored them. He didn't think even his teachers would notice but apparently they did and didn't choose to comment....... Until......
"And why exactly, do you think that no one cares about Peter?" he looks at Flash's badge, "Eugene? "
"That's uncle Clint he's really good with arrows.... like really good. he's  a S.H.I.E.L.D agent to we call him aunt tasha's murder twin. And uncle Rhody flies the war machine "
Tony was running behind him yelling something about breaking yet another project. Ned didn't know how Peter manages to bring him back each time. But then again Peter is a puppy labrador.
"Like hell it is, you're already spreading yourself thin enough you don't need a bully added to the mix." Tony ground out.
"What? Oh, god,I need to have a talk about those." Peter's mood was brightened considerably by the time he got up and left to work on the lab. He didn't notice Tony and Natasha walk in the room just as he left but Steve did.
"Ok then uh you can walk right through Mr..... Ned." she says stumbling at his name. Ned understands why Tony was so insistent on Peter calling him Tony before the adoption.
Peter didn't do much talking during his time in 'leading' the tour, but he figured everything said in these touts are public knowledge anyway so why bother? Besides, his peers seem to be much more entranced to see Wade talking about the new avengers recruits training he has been giving. Even -Peter glanced at Mr. Warren his chaperone seemed sucked in the story.
When she entered most were facing their back to her. The robot, who was facing her, looked up to see her and let out a soft,
"Pick up the goggles and aprons, I meant it when I said safety first.  " he brought out a box containing a lot of safety goggles and aprons. Cindy took a pair and put them on quickly.
(He knows exactly how though. The moment the family heard about Flash, they decided they needed to have a Talk.
"Oh, Pete, you know you don't have to take it." Steve threw an arm around him in comfort. Flash took the time to scurry to the back of the group.
Peter wanted to say that he was surprised when Mr. Shuu didn't accept his permission slip, but really, who in their right mind would believe that Tony Rogers-Stark signed a permission slip for a field trip.
"Awww that's cute you think we're not going to the principal's office to talk about this,  we'll see you when your classes are over underoos."
"Oh, and Miss-? we'll  be having a talk with the principal about you misgendering Peter. We wouldn't want to harass a child now would we?" Steve smirked at her.
He'd… hed probably find a lot of things about Wade that he appreciates. He'd hold him until yellow shut up. He'd joke with him until he forgets what was being said.
"HOW THE FUCK DID PENIS PARKER BECOME TONY ROGERS-STARK'S HEIR!!!" Oh would you look at that Flash has lost the will to live.
"The Avengers in the building seem to be gathered in gym room No. 462. Mini boss, would you like any particular workout requested? " she asks. Peter shakes his head.
Still he couldn't help feel a bit melancholy when he got home at Thursday , the day before the trip. The trip where his friends -all two of them- would be. The only major tour of the year. A tour that was supposed to be at some big name in scientific companies.
The buzz however, quieted to a pin drop silence when the next person stepped onto the mat. Ned was frantically texting Peter up until then, but....
"Calm down, he called to talk about........  Some..... rumours at Pete's school. " Peter could hear the grin in his voice.
"Thats...... Uh.... I'm flattered and all, but, I'm not gonna go out with you, it’s nothing wrong with you! Really! You’re  great! I'm sure you’ll find someone right for you! But I have a boyfriend,  and I'm happy with him. Sorry!" Peter rubbed the back of his neck.
Unfortunately,  Ms. Lanister noticed,  "Peter pay attention,  you may get the perfect A 's but you need to work to maintain it"
"I don't have my phone on me. I left it at home so...... I could just go home and then tell them what happened. " he didn’t really think the winning smile he gave her would actually help him in matters.
Peter looked around to see all of them in various state of in pain or unconscious. Huh, maybe he didn’t need to press the panic button after all.
Betty nodded looking interested and staring at Ned a little wide eyed. Peter cuddled closer to Wade.
"What are you still doing in my building? " Tony says getting a look at Flash. Flash, took it as a sign of dismissal, and booked it the heck out of there.
"A positive or negative reaction would kinda help me not get a heart attack Tony. " he says feeling his heart in his throat.
"Uh, yeah- yeah Mr. Stewart ,  I'm not sure what you mean though?" which is a lie. He knows exactly  what the other man  means he just refuses to acknowledge the fact that his teacher would insinuate
"So! This van was standing on the road and this dude was leaning on the van. He was soooo tall dad. And jeez he was probably on some kind of steroid now that I think about it. I was really jealous since he was like a foot taller than me-"
"who is this?" the voice went hard. It was what Peter called his I'm Here To Eradicate H.Y.D.R.A voice
The exhibit was of course exciting. everyone was mumbling about how cool some of the exhibits are. Peter took the time to meet up with his friends.
Peter was turning back to Ned and MJ when he heard the faint whisper, "alright but is  Stony Cannon?" Peter smiled.
"You do seem to be starting to have one of your sensory overload migraines,perhaps it would be benefactory to wear your glasses and earplugs?" Vision suggested.
"And I was just telling him that obviously I am the superior one." Sam pointedly told him. Peter sighed,
"Zhere are four different elevators in each wing, I'm sure You'll find zhem later, Betty,  you get off at floor 15 the place for marketing, you can ask for help if you Don't understand somezing, and Cindy gets off at at Floor 30, its a testing Lab, I'm sure ze lab director would be happy to help if you need it. " she informed them brightly.
"I'm pretty sure Peter thinks you're a hypocrite for making him rest and not resting yourself. " Natasha pointed out and Tony shrugged
"You know what, we should have a nice long chat this week, I'll even invite my laweers, and you can invite the Principal OK?" Tony told Mr. Collins who, at this point, was sweating bullets.
"You really are pathetic. " Bucky adds helpfully as he reloads his gun taking a break from shooting the many moving and timed targets in a simulation.
"Might as well congratulate Cin while you're at it She's working here too." Did Cindy mention that her best friend is a traitor? Because Betty Brant is up there with historical figures when it comes to being a traitor.
Peter decided to go the half truth route, " I.... got a detention" the Avengers that are present at the room froze,
"Talk to the lawyers about changing that name when you talk about that emancipation case." Tony says, " Fri, honey, send one of our lawyers number in his phone, I'll talk to Pepper later. "
"Peter, it appeares that one of our interns has become injured and Alice in desperate need of one, could you please help out?"
"HOW DARE YOU COMPARE ME TO THAT WORTHLESS -" Howard never got to finish what he was about to say because he was punched in the jaw by a -frankly terrifying looking- Steve Rogers.
He pulled off when he was smiling too much for it to be called a kiss. They both had the biggest giddy smile on their faces.
"You. I've been in love with you for so long. " Steve was standing right in front of Tony right now.
"Cause he thinks you hung the stars? Dude, you can't tell me you don't see how he stares at you? Besides, I doubt he'd let anyone else talk science to him for hours on end."
"The paper kind. He looks so gorgeous, he always looks gorgeous,  he's just a beautiful person in general. *gasp* he's gonna have so many people after his attention now, and he's gonna realise how better he is and leave me!" Wade wailed, and it did nothing to quieten the class's mumbling.
Bruce rolled gis eyes, " We are friends, I may or may not like him, it does not mean he likes me back, I'm not gonna ruin our friendship for that."
Tony squinted at him and it took all his self control not to lean back and hide his sketchbook or to kiss that stupid genius mouth of his.
Elanor just came in and took Peter to a diff room cause she wanted to talk and his worksheets were done.
Her smirk widened, "alright, I'll even sweeten the deal, if you flirt with him and can get him to flirt back, I'll give you fifty bucks"
"Hey, hey, Parker  are you gonna join the fair?  I'm donna dessimate whatever your project is. " Flash gleefully informed him before shoving him against a locker.
"Why does this give off so much.... I don't give a fuck vibes?" she whispered at Betty. "He's like sunshine personafied in real life."
"......Ohhhhhh, in my defence, whatever you found out, it was probably Peter's idea." she says after a minute, right as the boy joins them.
His classmates notice that people are smiling at peter though, and their whispers and mumbling does absolutely nothing to soothe  his upcoming headache.
"Oh! Are we talking about his ridiculous crush on dad?" it was kinda impossible for Steve not to choke.
"Hey, Michele, did Penis get you an internship too, since he's all buddy buddy with Tony Stark?" Flash mocked, Ned will forever be amazed at how stupid m the boy could be.
But he supposed it would really not help his case to say that he literally swings around New york looking for criminals so It's not that big of a shock.
"Alright, I'll be leaving. Zhose paperworks don't finish zhemselves" she winked at Danny and left. The man nodded and extended a hand towards Cindy,
The guy hit his head on the floor and was out cold. Peter looked at the goons who were skattered accross the class floor mostly groaning and cluching their injuries.
"Hey, uncle Clint, remember that talk we had about not killing minors with Aunt Nat the other day, it kinda works for everyone." Clint clenched his jaw, "And why- is this little shit talking to you in the first place?" He asked.
: so he called the school this morning and heard peter had no paperwork filed and investigated that.
" when was the last time you made a web formula in your chem class? Or made a contraption to contain and shoot them by yourself? That's what I  thought, never insult Peter ever again.  "
So that's three people with guns, two of them were flanking the leader and the other was right to next them. After that he could take the unarmed people easy enough.
she usually didn't just go and investigate every single little thing, but something about the whole fiasco strikes her as odd, (other than the whole appearing in a giant glow of light thing.) That and there's only so many papers she could read about how Howard is just this closer to finding Steve.
He also conveniently forgot that , Steve -I don't like bullies- Stark-Rogers was there, and what Flash said was most likely bullying.
Ned agreed, SI is more driven by brain than brawn. However, as they reach the gym, there seemed to be a commotion in the room, almost as though a lot of people decided to get some workout done. Ned and Maddie frowned. That can't be normal.
If that two bit spy thought she could just close the portal on his star like it was no big deal, then he was going to rip her throat out slowly and painfully so much so that even she would fear it.
But It's not even a normal circumstance. Given that MJ is currently in Vienna probably at a fancy hotel or a board meeting with Pepper and Peter is with his fathers in Wakanda probably hanging out with Shuri. And Ned was left to panic from his anxiety all in his lonesome.
"And why did this kid jump at the idea that Peter was lying?" Tony asked, bringing his fingertips together like he was a supervillain as opposed to a hero.
"I really did not wish to make you uncomfortable Bruce, I value our friendship, and I never intended on you finding out" Thor tried to salvage the situation
But still, even though she had actually been here before, the building always left her in...... A sort of awe. Betty to her right had the same reaction.
Vanko also made his list. He doesn't know what he'll do to Hammer, but he would be amusing him in hell for a long time.
Ok, here's the thing, the school that he goes to, that is, this stupid, stupid school in Northern Westchester isn't…. Well Firstly he's very very far away from his baby boy so they can't meet regularly. Which, you know, booooooo. But also his school is and he can't stress this enough, shady as all fuck.
"Alright everyone gather around, we're going to room No. 43. It's a..." Peter pulled out a map in his phone. "It's a R&D lab. So everyone, please be careful and avoid touching things. The things in those labs tends to explode, regardless of whether its supposed to."
Peter had a surprisingly low amount of homework today so he finished quickly. he hung out with his dad in his lab for a while, then went out to patrol before it was even dinner time.... that turned out to be a bad idea when he was faced with giant robot scorpions in his petrol.
"Of course we will get our tour guide in a minute, please wait here." Her tone was polite, fake and customer pleasing, as anyone would expect from a receptionist. A few minutes of Flash trying to get on his nerves later, a bubbly young woman made her way to the group, Peter doesn't really remember her name, but he saw her when he was passing the lower floors.
"It was one of Wade's friends." Peter says  before Mr. Stewart could reply and make things even worse.
"Uh..... Lesbian superiority?  Also Peter would be so disappointed you know how that's even worse than being mad"
"Probably not. But hey, they're coming back today so that's good isn't it?" Steve wriggles out of Thor's hold. And swipes his feet making the other man fall.
He saw one of the people who touched his star while battling Loki. He angled his shield to hit the Chitauri a second to slow.
"Guys, it's fine, he probably thinks my guardian's still......." he trailed off thinking of aunt may always brought a pang in his heart. even though he was glad that her death was peaceful and he got to say goodbye.
"No wonder they didnt show up. Probably didn’t have the courage to show face in a crowd huh. Tell you what son, leave their house, come live in mine, I'll probably throw my son out since he's like them too you could live with real a real man and my family-"
"We may be petty enough to use Mary, but not enough to tell about his crush" Ned says looking apologetic.
She doesn’t really have anything against Peter,  the boy nice. He's sorta like a golden labrador. Cindy doesn’t even particularly care if he has an internship or not, actually the only one who still cares is Flash.
His class stared back at him disbelief clear on their faces. His eyes found Ned and MJ who gave a small wave and a smirk respectively.
"I'm Peter's Teacher. I have a few concerns regarding Peter so I hope you could clear them up." Mr. Stewart tried for a formal approach.
Steve frowned at the line he just drew. It spoke volumes about his patience when he didn’t immediately just throw his skechbook from the window. Somewhat because it would probably kill someone from this height, also because of the content of said book.
"Did I tell you our school has this one major field trip to some place that is famous for some kind of scientific endeavour or another, and everyone gets Super pumped to go there? You know the last one was cancelled and the one before that was where I got bit by the spider?" Peter paused and Steve nodded.
"He took my phone to call my dads to talk to them. He called Pops and when he went to the lab with Aunt 'tasha they all laughed. "
I'm not talking about you surprisingly. it wasn’t you that messed up this time.  But @ C. JR and @ ActuallyIrish be prepared for retaliation.
"What kind of unsightly person are you talking about? " he decides to ask slowly.  Peter could hear him telling FRIDAY to take him to the lab in the background as though he covered the speaker up.
Peter sighed remembering the great Stony debacle raised after a photo of his parent's honeymoon got leaked.  Half of his school went through a celebrations of gay, some wanted concrete proof, the rest didn’t particularly care.
"My name is Natasha Romanoff, I'm one of Peter's aunts." she says the trace of laughter still in her voice.
"Cool name. Now as you can tell from the name, this lab is usually saved for testing purposes.  So always safety first. You'll probably be moved grom here in a week or so, because this is mostly the training grownds. When you have your own projects you can trst them here. "
It all started in breakfast. Shuri has been complaining all week that she gets bored when she visits and Peter has to go to school so he can't hang out with her.
"And I wanted to get off but they already started the car so I wanted to tell them to stop but the guy next to me had this spray out. I think it was to put me to sleep? "
"Just praying for the doctor, I guess, he was a good man." Steve says. Trying not to laugh, hah! Pray? To who?
"I thought you were dead, both of you " Peggy  says looking at Steve and Barnes.  She chose to ignore the metal arm and whatever That  constitutes.
Peter didn't really prefer biology class, he was never really good at it. At least not in the way he tends to be in physics or better yet chemistry. He just sort of.... knows some of the stuffs, mostly what he needs to know and the rest is spider facts.
Peter was done with those parties in the first five minutes, even if he was trying to remember all the people his dad introduced him to, (which is frankly a lot)
"Peter! help me with this!" He called out and walked himself and Tony towards the table Peter was in.
The scene was made even weird since none of them were in uniform, in fact one would say they were in such a hurry they couldn’t change any clothes from what they were wearing at home.
He looked up to see Peter not even looking at him but pointing to a place away from the rubble. He looked where he was pointed to see a few figures. One of them was sitting on the ground while the rest are in various states of reclining.
Tony took a five minute coffee break from making updates to Falcon's wings. He wondered if Peter was still in the building.  it took a lot of begging on Peter's part but the Avengers agreed not to interfere with his tour group..... unless there is an emergency.
"Peter how about this? You call your 'father' and put him on loud speaker and if he can confirm that my concerns are unfounded then he can say it himself can't he?"
Clint was shooting what looked like rubber arrows at Loki while Sam somehow acquired a paint gun and decided to shoot at Loki too. Both of them looked suspiciously glittery. Loki was muttering spells and Clint and Sam kept slipping and falling.
"What do you mean by pretending to know Peter? he's practically a second brother to me! who the hell even are you any way?"
"Cindy! Dont scare me like that! And.... Oh boy..... Please tell me Flash didn’t say anything stupid " he says as he takes in the class then both his fathers faces, then looks at his class again.
"Well, I mean, according to MJ you don't talk subtly anyway, but yeah you can." Tony teases then smiles.
“Laugh all you want now, but you have to replace anything you break so hope you got the money for it.” Mr Jean-Jaques ( For fucks sake own up to it. {Fine!}) Mr. JJ warns which shuts them right up.
Mr. Leroy walks in the class and starts teaching about basic coding, which might have been a little bit interesting if he wasn't good enough to hack Tony Rogers-Stark's tech (some might call him petty, bit he's really really proud of accomplishing that.)
Ned scoffed, misbehaviour won't be excused? Did they not ever hear about the Avengers? Ned still gets flashbacks from their Avengers paintball war, and he wasn't even a part of the game.
"You know what's not gonna help your situation with Steve? Talking to me about it. Has it ever crossed your mind, genius that it is, to actually talk to him about it?"
"Rumours? " came a third female voice and Peter groaned again,  great! just what he needed, Black widow riding on his school's case.
Anyway It seemed however, his keeping an eye on Shana came handy pretty quickly since, right in the middle of saying,
Mr. Conel. Rhodes looking at his hacked Twitter handle: about 5'5".  Taller if he's wearing  the suit.
Ned pats him on the back, "maybe You'll find someone else." he says gently and Flash nods, maybe he will, someday.
It's not everyday one gets accepted in the technological wonderland of the country. And that with their best friend to work with them? Just..... Wow.  Granted, Betty was going to be working in the marketing department,  but they'll be working in the same building!
Betty winced. Cindy rubbed her face then looked at the angry couple. Dam, no wonder supervillains are scared of them. If looks could kill Flash would be dead, then zombified then re killed and then re zombified to be killed again.
"Well, sort of. I'm giving it to the red cross after I'm done with her. She could be a doctor's assistant too" Peter patted Mary's head absentmindedly.
Luckily, unluckily? No one noticed him not having a badge. And they headed in. The first place they went to was a lower intern lab that Wade had yet to be banned from. Though he didn't go in there very often so…. Eh. He only goes to the labs when Peter is around. Labs freak him out unless babyboy is there to otherwise distract him.
"I remember that the day the two of you figured out your feelings for each other, and told me, it was the same day, and literally no one but the two of you seemed to think that it was a ground shattering revelation.
"I don't have the time for your mushy gushy feels trip. Are we planing a day for Peter or not?" Natasha interrupted.
Peter Parker has never had the best luck in his life, hence the phrase Parker luck kept following him around. But, after all his been through, what with his parents death, uncle Ben's death, becoming Spiderman (which is a whole can of worm all on it's own) and recently the death of May Parker, he thought he'd get a little bit of a break. If Parker luck was a physical entity, Peter imagined it laughing out loud at his thought and planning his demise with a well placed thought of NOPE!
Peter wakes gradually, he hasn't woken up so calmly in a while, mostly because school starts early and he barely gets rest, when he does wake up, he's glad his fathers made him take a rest day. He hadn't felt that refreshed in days, heck weeks, and he sits up, rubbing his eyes asking Friday about the time.
This chapter includes Trans Pete.  I am not a trans perso,  so I'm pretty sure I botched it up, Iam extremely sorry for that
The goons seems to be distracted which is good for his plan to try to wait till the Avengers get there, and not get shot at.
: speak for yourself, watching the two dance to Take me to Church on a double date was one of the gayest things I've ever seen.
He carefully took his phone to check Twitter, someone asked Rhodey a question that caught Peter's attention ,
That one multibillion dollar company that he was being trained to be the CEO of. His eye twitched when he thought how he didn't know this crap was happening.
dropped her box. Tyler and dick no. 5 are looking at themselves and Peter and Wade in turns. Whispers break out from their table
When they got close to the room Peter heard people inside, which is weird. No one really uses this training room, the number of people who actually work out in the building is scarce, limited to the Avengers and some shield people when they come in, but even then they use the rooms closer to the living quarters.  why would anyone be at a training room far from where it's convenient?
"Alright teach that's what you look like then, what did you mean by the lie about internship? " Peter's father asked.
