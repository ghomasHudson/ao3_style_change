Pepper crooked an eyebrow and stated, “Tony, when you are involved, I make a list of things that could definitely go wrong, a backup list of things that maybe
“Don’t you want to see the veins?” Steve asked, tracing his finger around the rim of Tony’s reactor. “What if they’re something bad?”
“The truth will come out, Steve,” Natasha promised and Steve smiled at her. Tony could have kissed her. A promise from Natasha was as good as gold.
Steve’s entire body froze so quickly that he skidded to a stop. A chill went up his spine that was eerily similar to the same freeze of the cold waters of the Atlantic that had frozen him.
“Ohhh, what do you smell?” Wade playfully inquired, rolling on the bed to wound bedsheets around him.
He did not remember making love to anyone but his body and instincts seemed to know what to do and how to give his soulmate the most pleasure. Natasha writhed under him, making noises that went straight to his aching cock.
Steve put his hand over Tony’s, pressing Tony’s hand into his cheek. Steve whispered, “It is different. This is more than friendship. I’m in love with you, Tony. I’ve been in love with you for years but did not act on it because - because I’m dead. I didn’t want you to feel as if you had to commit to me or trap you. But...” Steve caressed the back of Tony’s knuckles with his thumb. “Almost losing you...it doesn’t matter anymore. I didn’t want us to separate without you knowing...I love you so much. You are my everything, you-.”
I plan on writing one more part to this series, originally it was going to be short like Part 1 of the series but then I read an old Spiderman comic and now I'm inspired to add some angst...
When Steve also woke up first the next morning, Tony was thrown back into the darkness and he was alone again. Terror from losing Steve spurned him to wakefulness and he sat up sharply, reaching out with a sharp exclamation.
Mary wordlessly stepped over to her lab station and pushed the microscope aside. It slipped off the counter and shattered on the ground. She pushed aside some papers and revealed a monitor. It turned on and the notorious face of the Goblin appeared with a laughing grin.
He sighed heavily and murmured, “You’re sounding like my wife now…” He went back to his desk and sat down heavily. He rubbed his eyes and asked, “Is it really that obvious?”
“Maria told me about your living situation,” Bruce suddenly said. Steve twitched in surprise and he slowly swallowed his lick of ice cream.
“T-The sound,” Bruce garbled in stunned explanation. He had frozen in place with a single hand raised and did not move as if he feared doing so would disrupt what had just happened.
“A-And now?” Steve gasped. What would this machine, blessed by emotions, but ruled by logic say? Would she ridicule his beliefs…his hopes?
“I had smothered it, pretended it was not there,” Steve whispered. “Recently, I finally let it die…”
Stark’s words had burned into his mind but, it was his target’s sad eyes were what he visualized. Both made him agitated.
“Oh no you don’t,” Tony grumbled and scooted along with Steve. Tony settled himself down at Steve’s side and then wrapped Steve arms around him with calculated precision. He did not grunt as he did this but Steve could see his jaw clenched tightly. Eventually, they were situated and, as soon as Tony’s head hit the pillow, he was out in seconds but Steve was not so lucky. He stared at his boyfriend’s bandages for a long time before finally slipping into a restless sleep.
“You're fidgeting,” Natasha stated to Tony and she plucked a chip out of the bowl in front of her and ate it with a crunch. Steve had put out some snacks for their company and, so far, Natasha was the only one to partake. Steve and Bucky were together in the kitchen trading 40s slang and rhetoric that went over Tony’s head as they whipped up some sandwiches for lunch. Natasha and Tony watched it all from the other side of the counter.
Tony ignored his atrocious hangover and jumped to his feet. He gasped, “I can expla—!” He stopped and clutched his mouth as his stomach revolted upon the quick movement. He pushed past Steve and ran straight to the box that still held the half full whisky bottle and vomited all the contents of his stomach into it.
“No, Tony,” Steve gasped wetly. He pressed his face into Tony’s shoulder and whispered, “I know everything I need to know. I love you as much as the day I married you. If you don’t come back, I will follow you. I’ll bend space and time to bring you back to me. You’re my home and I am yours. No matter the era or paradox. I will follow.”
The man moved so fast Steve had no time to react. One moment, the man was inert and, the next, he was twisting beneath Steve’s hand and kicking his shield and sending him flying into the opposite wall.
“Oh, my God. You – You didn’t see me,” the man garbled, backing away from him. “I wasn’t here. I – I just thought you were in trouble – I heard this explosion, saw the smoke – so I came to help but you’re fine, so I’ll go…”
She wanted to see him. She wanted to see the love in his eyes again but she knew she would never see it again and it hurt all the more. Her entire existence revolved around Peter but she barely knew him personally and she wished things could have been different.
He didn’t think it was possible but Steve paled even more and Tony got angrier. Nevertheless, deep beneath that anger, his heart squeezed in despair as his mate slipped further and further from him. It was rare for soulmates not to become romantically involved and it was even rarer if they did not get along at all. Was this what they were going to be? That rare statistic that hated each other?
world to consider, a world where Hydra is still active. Does that mean World War II never ended? How many people die that didn’t have to?…How many do
Tony exited first, followed by Steve who closed the door after them. Tony flinched slightly when he heard the near automatic click as Peter must have raced to lock the door after them.
He was talking about the bomber jacket Steve was always wearing when Bucky finally pointed to the picture of himself and clarified, “That is me?”
Steve shivered and he and Tony stared at each other as they awaited Ben’s response. His heart began to hammer so loudly in his chest that he feared Tony might hear it.
Bucky chuckled some more and Steve paused to help Peter clean up the pieces of the mug, smiling as he did.  Peter was blushing furiously and mumbling apologies about the broken mug. As soon as the mess was cleared, Peter shot a glare at Natasha.
Bucky might be watching him right now or was tracking him down. Steve paused before the brownstone and peered up at the building. His eyes were drawn to the single window that had been in their apartment. It was on the second story, second from the right. Back then they could not afford curtains but the current owner could and those white curtains blocked his view of the inside. Steve briefly wondered who took up residence there now and if those occupants knew of its infamous past residents.
–!” Steve’s terrified voice echoed down the hall. Tony stepped toward it drawn to his soulmate despite the danger he posed in ignoring the Red Skull.
The entire reason I held back until now to post this was so I could accurately describe Cable's time traveling device! So guess who finally saw Deadpool 2! XD
The older couple nodded and with a heavy sigh Steve sat across from the couple. He explained, “Hydra had taken… pieces of me when I was still unconscious from being frozen. With it they tried to recreate a super solider…They were successful on only one account….They had taken my,
He found Bucky sitting on a balcony overlooking the water and he was staring out at the ocean with an empty expression.
"I love you too, punk," Bucky whispered, leaning into him. He pulled Steve into a half hug and repeated, "Love ya too."
“Steve, I hadn’t…I hadn’t known you were in such – such pain…Why didn’t you tell me, beloved?” Tony kissed the top of his head and Steve felt his eyes heat.
“You’ve got to be kidding me! I can’t believe you don’t have an elaborate proposal planned out already!” Peter countered.
After the shower, a handful of aspirin, and two cups of coffee, Tony and Steve sat down together in their bedroom. Steve grasped Tony’s hand encouragingly and Tony held onto it as if it was his final lifeline.
“Whatever he came for, whether he got it or not, he will mess up,” Bucky stated. “They always mess up.”
His head snapped back to the radio as he heard a familiar play and, as he listened, he realized it was so familiar because he’d seen that same game in the 40s.
Steve’s mind instantly focused on the groan and provided scenarios in which Tony could make those noises. Steve’s flush deepened and he looked at the mossy ground to avoid Tony’s eyes.
“I got you first,” Tony retorted briskly to Pepper and Steve sighed in relief. “Like I said we can’t stay here,” Tony added and Steve rolled his eyes.
Bucky did not respond at first, as if he were weighing his words. He grasped Steve’s hand and, when he did speak, his voice was certain as he stated, “Stark won’t forgive you if I stick around.”
Peter landed on the alpha balcony with an excited laugh. His entire body was thrumming with energy and he felt so
“Thank me by taking me to bed,” Tony hissed and used those after-shave slick hands to cup his jaw and pull his mouth back to Tony’s. Tony pressed his body back to Steve’s and wound his legs around Steve’s waist.
SHIELD and the Avengers became his and Steve’s pet project. They sat up night making their plans, envisioning facilities and ways they could help people beyond punching an alien in the face.
“I near about had a heart attack when I saw them jab you with that baton,” Tony gasped as he pulled out of Steve’s hold. He wildly searched his body for any other injury.
“This is amazing!” Bruce gasped. He pulled up his holo-files, the glowing holographs portrayed Bruce’s personal files on Peter, the older Hydra files from when he was first born, and his research on spiders. He went into the spider files and started looking through the collections. He pulled up images of spider legs and microscopic views of the limbs. Bruce looked at the images, starting to shake in his excitement, then raced back to the microscope to look at Peter’s hand again.
The side-yard was an outside walkway that was squeezed between the house and the wall that separated them from the outside world. It was where they kept the trash stored as the side door to the kitchen led out there. Tony barged through that side door and slammed the door behind him.
The memory of that happy moment, of all the happy moments with his husband and son, gave him the will to do the impossible.
The detective forcibly turned Steve around and snapped cuffs onto his wrists behind his back. The cuffs would do nothing to stop him but Steve allowed himself to be manhandled. He looked over his shoulder and stared at Tony as they were being put on. The detective read him his Maranda Rights while Steve pretended he and Tony were the only ones there and gathered courage from his gaze.
Tony didn’t move and, a few minutes later, Jarvis informed him, “Sir, Master Barnes has left the property.”
Death tilted her head to the side and her skull grinned at him in its forever smile as she said, “Hello again, Wade.”
Clint was the first to venture into the room, most likely to play a game on the TV’s entertainment system. The archer jolted to a stop when he saw him and grimaced as he murmured, “Oh God, I can see evidence. You have
The elder Howard flickered back to life. He was staring up at Iron Man with a serious gaze and he scratchily stated, “Tony, when you go out there, you need to remember one important thing about Hydra: when you cut off one head, two will always take its place. The first Cap ignored this…and we both very well know, because of this, he suffered a fate worse than death.”
Tony flew them back to his lab and as soon as they were in the building, Tony jumped from his suit and threw himself back into the arms his newly dubbed fiancé.
Tony laughed, “Pepper doesn’t believe me. She said and I quote ‘Return that baby back to its parents.’”
That excitement quickly deflated when he saw no sign of the time traveler around camp. He started to walk back to the command tent but was always cognizant of the fact Tony could “woo” him at any moment.
He was a machine. A vehicle for his master to use at his pleasure. He was not allowed a soulmate and he wanted nothing to do with this woman who claimed to be his…The only contact he wanted with her, was to wrap his hands around her throat and snap her neck. He should have done that in the first place…
His spare reactor was in his chest now. Pepper must have brought it at Jarvis's suggestion. It was probably helping but the poison was still in his system.
Norman sat at a café on the beach, sipping his cappuccino and watched the people walking by on the shore with an amused grin. The naïve fools had no idea the knowledge he possessed. They still lived in a black and white world where the headlines were mostly about celebrity gossip and not the latest alien invasion or super-powered mishap. Iron Man hadn’t even officially taken the stage yet…not that he was going to…
“Pepper, I can’t reach any further and neither can you. You’ve got to let go. Let go, I will catch you. I promise.”
The Soldier’s eyes focused on his target as soon as she entered the small room. His left arm had been disabled by Stark and was useless, but it and his right arm had been cuffed to the floor. He pulled at his bonds as soon as she entered.
Peter slid out of Wade’s arms and walked to the center of the room. Video cameras were in all four corners and he knew he was being watched from every direction.
Tony snorted, making Bucky’s small smile twitch into a slightly bigger one. It was heartwarming to see…Tony murmured, “I knew the two of you would get along, jerk.”
Peter looked to Uncle Tony and whatever expression was on his face made his uncle react the way he did.
Steve jogged into the room, his hair still damp from the shower, and he said, “Jarvis said you needed to see me?”
Steve played with Tony’s hair as his boyfriend slumbered. They were laying on the floor of his lab, propped up on some pillows they had pulled off the nearby couch. They were still naked since they had made love and Steve was thrumming with a loving afterglow from the sex.
Steve slid down Tony’s body and sat on Tony’s lap, pressing their hardening cocks together with a moan. Tony dragged his fingers into Steve’s scalp and swallowed Steve’s moans by pressing his mouth into his lips.
Until one noise stood out clearly to him: the blast of a single bullet. It was quickly followed by the heavy weight of Iron Man falling on top of him.
Steve’s eyes flickered open and his eyelashes tickled Tony’s skin. His arms slid behind Tony’s back and he returned the embrace with a happy grin. He peered up at Tony and leaned against his chest, settling into him.
Tony winced a little and stated, “I think the first thing you can do for me is to start using my name. Call me Tony, Wade.”
Tony murmured, “I’m still going to have surgery to have the cylinder removed and the hole closed up…”
He threw back his head and laughed as he injected himself with something. His body expanded, ripping his clothes until only shreds remained and the very same Goblin Steve had seen on the field weeks ago was now standing there. The monster activated the time glove and, in a swirl of golden light, he was gone.
“Great…” Steve sarcastically replied. Now he had to worry about the vultures swooping in on top of everything else.
His mind inadvertently went back to the last funeral he attended over seventy years ago. His mother had died long before World War II and Steve becoming Captain America, Steve had grieved similarly afterwards, swallowing his tears and his body trembling with the contained grief instead. Bucky had been there and, despite Steve’s protests he stayed with him the entire night. It was because of Bucky, Steve was able to manage his mother's grief. His only explanation for staying with him being, “It’s you and me till the end of the line.”
In all of his relationships, he’d never had been affected as much as he was now. Not even when he lost his virginity from a man who pretended not to know him the next day…
“Should I bring one of my robots to the club?? Do you think they'll let me bring it in!? I bet I can sneak it in…Or maybe create one small enough to hide in my backpack. Chicks dig tiny robots, right?”
Until Bucky died, and then – and then Steve dying a week later. Until his father recovered the tesseract and the government gave up on looking for their lost super soldier.
Steve leaned down and kissed his soulmate, dragging his crotch up Tony’s leg until he came into contact with Tony’s hips. Both of them moaned and Tony began to lightly buck his hips, making Steve’s arousal spike with each thrust.
“What Tony is saying is true,” Bucky stated gruffly. “I had been given a version of the super solider serum that healed me, including my mind…if my mind wasn’t erased regularly, I’d remember and fight back…”
Happy was still in a coma. Tony looked wistfully out the window up to the portion of the building which was SHEILD Medical, he told Steve Happy had been transferred there that morning from the hospital in California.
Steve blinked at him owlishly and then looked to his lawyer, standing right in front of him. His lawyer asked, “Captain Rogers, would you like to take a break?”
Steve pulled away from the person who tried to comfort him, not even seeing who it was…because Tony was moving and Steve needed to be by his side.
Tony closed his eyes and pressed his face against the shield and suppressed the urge to cry. Fury was still in the area and he’d be damned if he’d let him see him cry again.
Tony grinned, his smile lighting up his face, and said, “Yes! I wish there was a way to make it blacker than black but I just make do with more cups of coffee!”
Tony stumbled off the stage with his hand raised to his mouth to stifle any sobs that might escape. Pepper rushed up to meet him and grabbed him, taking on the majority of his weight.
Steve happily pulled Tony into an embrace. Tony mumbled something unintelligible into his chest and Steve pulled back to better hear him. He noted his hands were covered in the crud from Tony’s skin and he looked down to see the sheets were also in need of changing.
Pepper left right at rush hour, so he knew it was going to take her a few hours until she got to the offices, and it may take her even longer to get the information without Obadiah noticing. So, Tony didn’t fret over the time. He had Jarvis keep an eye out for Steven and took his time with his suit. Putting the Mark III together was cathartic. It’d been years since he felt so accomplished when building or creating something new.
“Everything Mac did will be thrown out by the end of the week,” Eddie stated, picking up the flask. Turning to Peter, he rebutted, “What do we have to lose? Our solution is going to die no matter what we do! With this, at least we can try something! There’s a chance the symbiote will latch onto it and infuse itself with our molecules!”
Pepper, meanwhile, ran at the suit as it charged her a second time and collided with it midair. She brought it down with a single punch. She forced one of her glowing hands through the suit and slid her arm into the armored arm. She faced Kilian with a taunting smirk and Kilian changed directions and charged her with a growl.
“Great! Toast it is! In the meantime...” Tony opened up new holograms for Bucky and said, “Let’s check out some old photos and spark some memories, shall we?”
Once the hum of their voices reached acceptable levels, Marston yelled, “Steve!” The audience’s tone quickly lowered several decimals and Marston continued, “Steve, you honor me by making such an announcement! Give me all the details! Who is the lovely lady? Please say I know her!”
Upon their first meeting, Peter and Ben connected in a way Steve would have never expected. His son fell in love with his elder uncle. Surprisingly, to Steve he became a sort of a father figure. He never really knew his own father but Ben was like he had always imagined him to be. He was one of the friendliest and caring men he had ever met.
Steve dropped the pillows and joined Tony in the bathroom. The shower was huge with shower heads on either side like it had been designed for two people to shower together. The water was hot and steam was already clouding the air. Tony was already applying soap suds with a mesh ball but he smirked at Steve as he joined him. Steve stepped behind Tony and lightly kissed his cheek in greeting.
Why was Cap being so nice? He was always a nice guy on the field unless you were facing off against him but…? Wade thought he’d be more against him dating Peter because, well, even Captain America had to see Wade was no good for Peter. So why was he encouraging it?
been with a man and he couldn’t help but wonder what position he’d like when they’d finally do the deed…
Tony closed his eyes as Steve began to run the blade across his neck. It was relaxing and reminded him of he few times he had a professional barber work on him. Steve's hands were always on him either tilting his chin or resting on Tony's shoulder. Steve commented, “You look nothing like your father.”
Bucky’s frown was erased and he grinned. They naïvely believed winning the war equated to their own victory and survival.
Steve had left out a jar of Vaseline on the floor by the bed. He reached down for it and Tony took his moment’s pause to rut against Steve, causing his entire body to spasm. With the Vaseline in hand, Steve glared at his lover but the man just grinned back unabashed. Steve slicked up his hands and then outright grabbed Tony’s cock with it, shutting the man up quickly.
Dad lightly touched the side of his head and whispered, “You…I…I know you’re upset, buddy. We’re going to get Pops and then Uncle Bruce is going to find a cure any day now…”
Tony cuddled into his fiancé’s side watching Pepper as she wildly worked her magic. She had one phone up to her ear, another in her hand, and her other hand was hurriedly writing down something.
Hello! I'm back! Sorry for the hiatus! A lot of things have happened in my life since I last posted that have kept me busy but now (hopefully) it's all done! Fingers crossed! I've been making changes to all the chapters I haven't posted yet but have also been adding more content to them (The second date with Wade wasn't originally in this chapter)  and I also went to change a SINGLE line in
They passed about a dozen haggard looking SHIELD agents working at monitors and Hill informed them they all could be trusted. Steve nodded but still cast a wary eye over the busily working group.
Steve was sitting on the ground, hyperventilating deeply. His head was bowed to his knees and clutched between his hands but it shot up upon Tony’s arrival. Steve was wearing his jogging outfit and the right arm of his shirt was torn and his hair was disheveled. It was not hard for Tony to guess what had happened.
“Replusor blast times infinity!!” Peter yelled and the tiny Iron Man’s fist glowed then punched the tiny Thor. The tiny Thor spun and hit the other toy with its hammer. The Iron Man hit the ground with a resounding crash.
“Can you bring him back to the Tower so Dr. Cho can look over him?” Steve asked and slipped Peter in Tony’s hold.
Peter sleepily rubbed at his eyes and murmured, “Okay, this is okay.” He looked to Wade and confirmed, “Is it okay?”
Tony landed with a jolt and his heart began racing for an entirely new reason. There was only one Captain he knew of who worked with the Commandos. He gasped, “Do you mean Captain America…
If the Goblin destroyed the reactor and Tony never had the chance to use it…what did that mean for the Tony in his arms now?
Steve stared up at the wisecrack marvel with a slackened jaw. He was beginning to question his sanity. It was cold in the twilight of the day and the roof was warm and rough beneath his feet,
Hill brought them into a private room and Steve halted at the door as soon as he saw the figure in the bed.
James came in and draped the lab coat over Steve. He kneeled in front of Steve and stated, “Hey, it’s me…it’s-it’s Bucky.”
The rest of the week went like this. Both of them were persistent but it was also tearing both of them apart.
Steve nodded and they began to walk, with Tony leading the way and Steve was more or less walking beside him. People were watching them and more than one had their phones out. They were going to be the top story tonight, that was a definite.
His uncle nodded then pointed his hammer toward the Tower and was shot in the direction of the battle. Peter watched him go then looked to the fighting at the skyscraper’s base. He was too far away to differentiate between the quarreling figures.
Peter shook his head and said, “I don’t think that thing would have ever cohabited. Don’t live with what ifs, Eddie…The symbiote is gone. There’s no going back.” He grasped his friend’s arm and stated, “We’ll restart our experiment and make a bio-shield that will help its wearer, not harm…”
DUM-E squealed in agreement and Steve let him pull him deeper into the lab. Tony was glad Steve was busily paying attention to DUM-E because Tony had the biggest, goofiest, most embarrassing smile split his face as he watched his soulmate walked hand-in-hand with his creation, admiring all that Tony had made.
“I have Peter’s file and can check in with you two later but…I think you two will pass the background check,” the Social Worker said with a smirk.
As Tony privately flushed to himself for his mistake, he silently berated himself for the move. He went over to where Steve had left the champagne bottle and made himself busy as he slowly refilled the flutes.
Tony grinned widely and the elevator closed with a light ding behind him as his son stepped into his home and took his first steps into Tony's life.
None of them could be good. They knew he purposely infected Peter with Venom, they had the video evidence from the birthday party. It was one of the things they overviewed with him. SHIELD may not be owned by Stark but he had a lot of sway in the organization and he was probably none too happy what Eddie had done to his son.
“Is it alright? We don’t have to have anything playing…It sounds dateish. Jarvis, stop playing the music. Sorry, Steve, I just want to help make you feel more relaxed…I know this is really – really –…”
Steve's heart knotted within itself as he braced himself for the worst. Tony was going to tell him about his new bedmate and Steve needed a brace face.
His eyes had trailed back to the clock and he was reminded of how much time had passed. His wait had been fruitless and the notion was beginning to settle in. Tony had been defeated by a force none of them understood and would continue to hold Steve in its thrall.
“Ben, I am going to pack some clothes for Peter and me. I-I can't stay in the Tower. Everything reminds me of him. It is making me insane. I need to clear my head.” Like this he was more destructive than helpful for Peter.
Steve sat up and Tony grinned goofily at his best friend as she glowered at them. He announced, “I’ll marry this man even if I look debouched.”
[…Because I still feel something,] Bucky murmured in reply. He kept his gaze downcast and speared into the ground by Natasha’s feet.
Tony wasn’t going to be the cause of Steve’s death. He knew that but that still didn’t stop the guilt. He knew
He hated to leave him, especially with the clock ticking away what little time he had left. But he needed to make sure these events to come still occurred. Yes, Steve was going to bring about the end of Hydra in his martyrdom…but the most important thing was that he was going to be saving Tony’s life too and it was that factor that kept him going. He was going to make sure Tony got the tesseract and got home.
Steve covered the distance between them and slowly lay himself over Tony. The older man wrapped his hands around Steve’s biceps and groaned as his settled his weight on him.
Peter listened to the exchange feeling the control of his own life slipping out of his hands. How did it come to this? Was there anything he could have done different to have prevented this?...
“Remember before the war, when we were talking about being neighbors and our kids being best friends?” Bucky asked.
“Friday told me of Wilson’s arrival so I came to greet your guest,” he murmured darkly, glaring at Wade all the while. Stark’s gaze shifted to Peter to watch him pull down his shirt and then the glare returned to Wade with ten times the burning ferocity.
“You keep saying that, but you don’t seem to be following our conversation,” Bucky stated, looking at Tony as if he was a crazy person. He continued, “This is a serious matter. Steve is not gay right now! Neither am I! Who are you??”
“I wish to partake as well!” Thor announced. He downed the last of his coffee and rushed over to the pot for a fresh cup.
Tony worked late into the night again and was able to finish the arm by early afternoon the next day.
He needed to unleash the emotional response all at once and had felt semi-cleansed from it but…but now he felt it building up again especially as his mind wandered back to Tony.
To placate the man, Fury stated, “Captain Rogers will not have his rights violated. The results of his psyche eval will determine what will be done with him…You’ve done some damn stupid things before Stark but, in regards to Captain Rogers you’ve been especially stupid. Did you plan to keep him locked away in your tower forever? And how did you think attacking me would have been constructive??”
When Jarvis suggested he tell Steve, the guilt doubled. With this shame, he was going to have two reasons to drink soon.
Jarvis was fully operational again by the time Pepper got there. Tony had worked himself into a frothy rage as he anticipated what he was going to do SHIELD once he was free.
“I promise,” Steve whispered. Then because he couldn’t help himself, he asked, “…Why is it a secret?”
Natasha’s hand shot out and touched the pulse point in Tony’s neck. Her mouth thinned and she hissed, “His pulse is weak.” Natasha looked at Steve and demanded, “Did you see what she did to him? Where he was stabbed?”
Natasha crossed her legs and said, “So you were going to tell us everything that happened while we were gone?”
Her feet were aching from ballet practice and the cold was making it worse but she ignored it. The part of the park she was in was secluded. No one would notice her eliminate her target.
Steve left his phone on the roof and took nothing with him for SHIELD to track. Wearing only the clothes he put on that morning, and making no attempt at disguising himself, Steve hopped on his motorcycle and went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge.
“Steve chuckled and murmured, “Obviously, but what else? Would you want to marry? Start a family? Stay at the Tower? Stay in the Avengers?”
Tony’s mouth went dry and all he could think was: Zola, train, Swiss alps, Bucky, and, inevitably, the worst of all...
“I was glad to,” Steve truthfully replied. “How was the Colonel? Is he going to comply with your request?”
Alarmed, Peter returned the hug and stated, “You are! Is this still about Venom? Your help got it off me! I barely have any marks left from the electrocution.”
“Cap woke up sooner than we thought he would,” Coulson stated. “He thought he was captured and escaped.”
“Jarvis subject at twelve o’clock is not a target. Do not engage,” Tony commanded, his voice laced with fear. His hand hovered over his ear where his earpiece was supposed to be but it was gone, probably lost in his struggle with Kilian.
Peter agreed wholeheartedly and begged for Natasha to play with him. Natasha relented and let the three-year-old direct her away.
With Steve finally able to settle down and map out a tentative future for himself, all the pain he had locked away was starting to break free. Steve never had a moment to grieve for his best friend –
As Steve laughed, both Sam and Tony came flying up over the edge. Sam was the one who ended up catching Sitwell and tossed him back onto the roof. He too landed and his wings folded back into his pack.
The day Tony had been born, Steve swore to himself that he’d be strong for Tony but…he couldn’t be strong anymore. He’d shouldered so much over the years, but he couldn’t do it anymore. He couldn’t be strong for Tony after nearly losing him again and again and not being able to even attempt to help him. He was there for Tony in the dreamworld, but… he wanted to be there for him in the real world too…
Bruce immediately took skin samples, simple scrapings that did not draw blood. Peter only murmured in discomfort.
“Bucky!” Steve yelped in warning, reaching out to his friend, but was stopped as he forgot about the cord railing of the boxing ring.
“It’s the truth and he predictably hates me and refuses to speak to me…He and Steve are meeting for coffee right now,” Tony mumbled the last bit. He fell back into the couch and looked at the ceiling. He whispered, “Ever since I saw him all I can wonder is: Did I do the right thing? He was happy with his aunt but now he’s not. I just fucked up his entire life by showing up, didn’t I?”
The Goblin jumped from his ledge and landed in front of Steve. The ground beneath him crumbled underneath his weight in a circular crater. The Goblin stood and hissed, “The boy is mine and I want him back.”
Bucky pulled up in the Jeep and had come to such an abrupt stop that made Steve jump. He hadn’t seen him coming because he was all eyes for Tony.
Within a few days, Tony had “gamma-baby” proofed Steve’s floor and all the other living areas available for the toddler to access.
Howard's eyes lit up and refocused on Tony. He swallowed his food loudly and rested his chin on his fist and drawled, “Well, well, well you just became mildly interesting…”
“Now, I hate you,” Tony stated, pulling away from his husband. Steve laughed and he pulled Tony back into his embrace. Tony let him without a fight, smiling to himself in spite of Steve being such a puppy dog and treating Tony like he was one too.
“Yes – no, Steve…I’m sorry,” Tony gasped, with his face still buried in the juncture of Steve’s neck. “
He took a taxi to her place and the driver kept a wary eye on him the entire time. He was barefoot and still wearing the undershirt and shorts he fell asleep in that were now covered in the dried blood of Peter’s stepfather. Clint had been with him and it was probably the archer’s universally recognizable face from being a part of the original Avengers that assisted in getting Wade his ride.
Bucky whistled loudly and said with an impressed tone, “Wow, Tony. You went all out for this place…Is that a kitchen?”
Natasha’s eyes widened and she paused in whatever she was doing. Staring at him intently, she slowly repeated, “Stepan.”
“Because it’s fun,” Wade retorted, swaying lightly. Peter moved with him and lay his head right under Wade’s neck. Wade tucked his chin right over it and inhaled the faint scent of shampoo from Peter’s hair. For a few passing moments, they simply swayed like a pendulum of a clock, and Wade imagined that time slowed down just for them.
There was a loud crash overhead and everyone’s heads snapped up to see what it was. Tony slid across the glass ceiling. He was in his armor but was missing his helmet and one of his gauntlets. Tony was so focused on his opponent that he did not seem to notice them and quickly turned back to the man he was fighting.
He rubbed at the area just below his arc reactor to try and dispel the feeling but it lingered. He’d been hunched over too long and the tight bandages around his chest seemed to be straining the muscles around his reactor. Ever since he started wearing it, his chest has slowly beginning to feel…tighter. Not the good tight, like he was fit…but the kind that was beginning to hurt...It was a manageable pain but he couldn't wait until he was free of the wrappings.
“Peggy knows I like men but she does not know how far my relations with men have gone,” Steve stated with a flush. “She is a lady after all.”
“Byeeee,” Peter called. After Ben climbed in to the car and drove away, Peter asked, “Where is Unca Ben going?”
Bucky remained dead to the world on the couch in a deep sleep. Steve bit down on his bottom lip. He doubted Bucky slept so well anywhere else. Bucky truly felt safer around Steve. He hoped he did not destroy that trust with what he had to say…
ignore Peter’s commands before and thought nothing of it! I could have used my head for once and saved him before this happened! It’s my fault! Peter is in there because of me!”
Steve looked nervously from his son to Bruce. Tony asked for him, “So Bruce, what does this mean for Peter? Is he going to be alright?”
When Steve entered the community room, Bucky was laying lengthwise on the couch. He had a newspaper (still refusing to use the tablet Tony gave him) and was reading it with a blank expression.
The elevator opened and Steve followed Bruce out. They stepped into a large entertainment room with an attached kitchen, and dining room. Clint lounged on one of the couches in the living room portion and was watching the largest television Steve had ever seen. Clint was wearing his usual black shirt and pants, all form fitting and a gun holstered at his side.
“Phil…” Steve sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose before stating, “I don’t think I will be able to keep my privacy for long being mated to Tony. Eventually, someone is going to find out. Wouldn’t it be better to do it on our own terms? I’m prepared to tell everyone right now.”
“Are you kidding me? I want to see Steve’s reaction to the chest buster scene,” Peter retorted, making Wade chuckle. Wade’s nails were lightly scraping his scalp and it felt amazing. Peter hoped he wouldn’t stop for a long time because it was relaxing.
It was the first time he’d verbally said it, the first time he’d actually ever meant it. In his own mind, when the thought occurred, he ignored it or denied it out of fear. However, now there was a happy, bubbly feeling growing in his chest.
He went back to his lab and gazed around it. His mind was abuzz with possibilities and he was already drawing up schematics for possible machinery Bruce might need. At the moment he was thinking of possible cure drug deliveries: liquid (some kind of injecting system), gaseous (a ventilation system), etc. If they came up with a solution to destroy Venom, Tony wanted to be prepared.
Tony strolled up to Steve’s side and then leaned into him. He looked at the holograms and perceived from the text, “Bucky?”
Bucky took the chair at the opposite end of the table, placing himself between Tony and Clint. A plate had been laid out for him and he mutely reached out for the platter of pancakes and took a large stack for his plate. He eyed the syrup choices then grabbed the closet one, the peach.
“We shall throw a great feast, one greater than those held in the halls of Valhalla!” Thor exclaimed, clasping the sides of Steve’s face.
Natasha continued to glare at him, but, after a minute, she stepped back with a satisfied smirk and nodded to him.
Suddenly remembering his final moments at Steve’s memorial, Tony broke their embrace to meet Steve’s gaze again. He cupped his jaw and whispered sincerely, “Steve, I hadn’t been able to say it in the past…and it haunted me ever since I returned to the future, but you need to know…I love you.” Steve inhaled sharply and he grasped both of Tony’s sides tightly. He look surprised by Tony’s sudden declaration and Tony continued, “I really didn’t understand it until you were gone. I felt like my insides had been torn to shreds and I could no longer function. You were my everything…You are my everything. And I love you so much that I feel like my heart is going to burst from it if I don’t keep telling you. I love you. I love you, Steve. I lo –.”
He walked into the living room to see Bruce lounging on one of the couches with his feet propped up on the coffee table and a book on his lap.
Steve gasped sharply as Bucky bit the sensitive flesh on his neck. Steve cupped Bucky’s face and Bucky growled in approval.
He pushed up, ironically recalling watching a similar scene from a movie he had watched with Tony. The blonde woman had been buried alive to suffer an agonizing death yet, in Steve’s case, it seemed he had been buried dead only to come back to life. Like the woman from the movie, Steve pushed through the crumbling earth and then exploded from the surface.
“Other employees from the Avengers’ Tower have come forward and said the same thing: Mr. Stark and Captain Rogers are friends and nothing more. This whole thing is probably a sham to protect the Captain from a rape charge. We have seen the rich and powerful lie about even greater things in order to escape a guilty plea. This is just anoth—.”
She opened the door and James fluidly stepped in as soon as the space was available. One shot and the one guard fell. They ran in, weapons drawn, expecting more but no one else came out.
Steve’s mouth thinned at his use of his last name. It was impersonal and felt strange on Tony's tongue. Steve cleared his throat and gruffly replied, “Yeah, sorry.” Steve’s eyes spanned around the elevator, taking in the fallen bodies and he sighed heavily.
"Yeah and he's gotten it into his head that he's five years older and should be allowed to fight with the Avengers on a full time basis," Steve said, rolling his eyes.
He didn’t care if these people worked for the U.S. government. If they wanted Steve, they were going to have to step over his dead body before he let them any closer to him.
Bucky traced his lips and smeared away a bit of blood left over from his lacerated tongue. He grinned at his red fingertips then looked to Steve and chuckled.
Wade hmmed something indiscernible and leaned into Peter, nuzzling his face against Peter’s the best he could. They stood like that until the rest of the Avengers arrived.
The suit’s filaments lightly hissed behind him as they powered off and he turned to his invention as he undone his last button.
Steve almost groaned with annoyance. Bucky was still as stubborn as he used to be, that was for sure. He was glad for the distraction. He rather focus on Bucky and his ‘mission’ than Tony or what Steve was doing there.
Coulson’s usually stoic face was marred by a slight frown and he murmured, “I will be just outside. Call me if you need me.”
He heard Tony’s jeans slide off and he snapped open his eyes to catch his first glance of Tony stripped bare. Tony was not wearing anything beneath his jeans. Once loosened, the jeans fell easily off his hips and he stepped out of them. His cock jutted up, long and hard with a pebble of precome leaking out of the tip. The course hair that led down to his cock was dark black whereas Steve’s was light blonde. Steve could not help but wonder if it was courser and wanted to run his fingers through it. Steve blushed at the thought and dug his fingers deeper into the sheets.
Tony flushed when his chested swell with excitement at the idea. He tried to play it cool and shrugged. He stated, “You don’t have to.”
Also I have not decided on how I am going to end Part 3 yet... Is Steve going to end up with Tony or Bucky? Let me know what you think in the comments! :D
Peter’s mind screeched to a halt and his heart did a double backflip in his chest because Peter was no longer considering “if” they’d have sex. Now, it was only a matter of when…
Steve leaned into Tony and they held their hands between them in the fissure created by their parallel legs. Tony had sweated while out in the field so, as Steve lay his head on top of Tony’s, all he could smell was Tony. He closed his eyes and remembered the few nights they had alone together when all they could smell was their own sweat and the Vaseline they used as lubricant.
So Tony got to his feet, gave Steve’s hand a reassuring squeeze before pulling away, and then walked over to Wade.
She stopped and Peter could not look at her. His eyes focused on Richard’s picture and he did not look away. With a breaking heart, he finished what she was going to say, something Peter had been weakly denying since Tony Stark stepped into his life, “—But he is not my biological father. Is he?”
Overnight, Steve had curled onto his side and around Tony with his face buried into Tony’s hair. He hardly moved as he sleepily came back to his senses and he enjoyed those few sparse minutes simply laying with Tony. He tightened the arm he had across Tony’s chest and then deeply inhaled his scalp, trying to commit the scent and moment to memory. Tony didn't wake and continued to slumber as Steve stared adoringly at him.
“It was…” Tony whispered, tossing out the once priceless pottery. He asked her, “Can you get the pizza?  I don’t want to leave him alone…He might break the vase from the Qin Dynasty next if the bell rings again…”
Venom moved uneasily against his skin and Peter snapped open his eyes to see his parents approaching him. Peter scooted back, dragging Wade with him, and gasped, “No! Don’t come any closer!”
Tony broke the kiss and gasped, “Please tell me this isn’t temporary. That you’ll be gone by midnight because how else did you get here and without aging!”
“I figure I'll trust the genius, time traveler with protecting the fate of the future. If you really think this will work then, I want it.” Steve lightly rubbed Tony's ankle with his foot, just like he had and, as his heart did somersaults in his chest, he confidently whispered, “I trust you.”
“You will soon,” Tony promised Peter while the hand resting on Steve’s back, dug its fingers into his flesh.
When Tony returned to the tower, safe but annoyed with his investors, he was more than happy enough to reassure Steve by accepting Steve’s imploring touches and worried kisses.
“Trust me,” she murmured. “You don’t want to speak to the Colonel after Howard. No one will. But you do need to speak to Tony right now.”
“Should…Should I kiss you?” Bucky asked with a befuddled tone. Steve mirrored Bucky by going ridged in his hold.
Steve kept his one hand on the compress but he used his other hand to angle Tony’s head back to have more access to his mouth. Neither of them could breathe so they broke away sharply when their lungs could no longer take it.
He sat Peter on his right hip just to free up his left arm and grasp Tony’s hand. He ran his thumb over Tony’s wedding band and marveled over the weight of his own. It was strange to think he may one day get used to feeling it.
“Don’t talk like that, Peter,” his father commanded from the other side of the room. His face was ashen white and his voice trembled as he replied, hearing the deeper meaning to Peter’s prior words, “
Peter snorted at the absurd definition but Wade sat up in his cocoon of blankets and gasped in wonder, “What does
The Soldier was once again ripped from his target but this time the grip that held him was unyielding and crushing his bones. He struggled against the massive green hands that held him, nonetheless, his eyes were not on the Hulk but his target.
The Red Skull whispered to Natasha, “So kill me. Kill your defenseless prisoner. Show your teammates how merciless I made you. Show them everything I taught you and then live the rest of your life with them keeping a figurative distance from you, the acolyte of the Red Skull.”
Tony lay his head on Steve’s shoulder as he nestled into his side and murmured, “Love you too, beloved.”
Peter put a hand over the spot where the kiss was pressed and felt torn. The lab was calling to him. He could feel an almost physical pull on his body. But, with the simple kiss his stepfather had placed on his forehead, Peter was reminded of the men on the patio and how important they were to him.
Tony guided Steve to the couch and he sat down heavily. Steve adjusted Peter so he would be sitting in his lap and kept his arms wrapped around his son. Peter was silent and watching him with a keen eye. Steve could feel the worry coming of his son in waves.
He shouldn’t be attracted to Tony. Tony was not just his friend…he was a man. Men being with men was…wrong.
Steve scooted closer, laying his head on Tony’s shoulder, and traced out the lines as he murmured, “No, these veiny things. They weren’t there last time.”
Steve left the room, opening the door enough for him to slip out. Tony watched him go with a bemused smile and then turned to the Iron Man suit and asked Jarvis, “Well? How do you think it went?”
He knew what Bucky was saying was true but…Steve couldn’t stop the way his heart was already tentatively reaching out to the other man.
He felt totally out of place in his navy blue uniform adorned with the white star in the middle of his chest, surrounded by neutral colored suits. He stood out like a sore thumb.
,” Ben reiterated. “Steve, who had as much choice in this matter as you did. Steve who loves Peter with all of his heart. Steve who is the reason Peter is the way he is. And he did not even know of Peter’s existence until he was two-years-old. He had no idea Hydra did this to you.”
Tony sighed heavily and said, “You were out a little over a week and I was shot three times but got it all fixed.”
“You're more likely to meet the governor than Tony Stark,” Solo stated sarcastically. Steve dropped his head. Solo was right. Stark was famous and Steve was just a nobody. Solo sighed heavily and murmured, “We're gonna look like fools but…we can try to make an appointment. He probably has a front desk in that lobby of his.”
“No, wait,” Bruce stopped them. “You’ll crowd up my lab. Stay here. Jarvis will make sure you’re updated. I don’t want any distractions.”
Steve waited until land was maybe a mile off the port side before he jumped overboard. He left a note for the crew to let them know he was fine but had slipped away to figure things out on his own.
He felt spent but still managed to crawl next to his soulmate and let Steve put him into his chest and spoon him. Tony rested his head on Steve’s bicep and closed his eyes for just a second.
The Hydra agents were quick to react however and they pulled out various weapons and fired in retaliation.
“That was a short shower,” Steve commented. He made himself think unpleasant thoughts and prayed that no more blood would flow to his half-hard cock. It was not noticeable right now but if Tony teased him again it might grow.
Peter’s face happy expression fell off almost as soon as he saw them. He read them almost as well as they read him. Peter sadly whispered, “So I guess I’m not seeing her…”
. And he knew his boyfriend wouldn't like an elaborate surprise. He'd want something simple and private but something they could look back on and smile about later in their lives…
“It would be safer for you if I am in the same vicinity as you to better watch over you,” Bucky stated.
Tony ran into a clearing and pointed his gun in the direction the shots were coming from. He pulled the trigger and nothing happened. Tony cursed to himself and fiddled with his gun, ignoring the blue rays that were shot in his direction.
He’d been standing in the alleyway Peter told him to wait for him. It was deserted save for the trashcans and cigarette butts. At this late hour, there were hardly any pedestrians on the street to notice him lurking. Wade whipped his head around to find Peter hanging upside down behind him in his new black Spidey uniform.
. Steve, there were going to be fireworks, neon lights, some smooth jazz, and Peter was going to bring it to you in this adorable suit…”
“Steve R…Carter. Steve Carter,” he repeated and the doctor’s eyes narrowed as he heard his hesitancy.
Tony cupped his hands behind Steve’s shoulders and slowly dragged himself over Steve’s body until he was hovering over him. He’d never before seen a sleepy Steve and it was hot.
Pops carried him out of the elevator and they walked back into the living room. Uncle Tony followed and smiled at Peter when he caught his eye. Uncle Bucky rose from the couch when they appeared. Pops replied, “Well we actually talked mostly about you but from what little she said I could tell she’s a smart, a little shy, but nice as well. She could have yelled at me but she never did.”
Peter flushed shyly and murmured, “I wish that I can be with my Papa…And dis will be my home, always.”
"Tony...What are you doing?" Pepper finally asked him with a slight edge to her voice. They were mostly alone and outside on the balcony. Pepper looked stunning in her new dress and all eyes in the area were on her, except for Tony.
“Jarvis, have Bruce and Mary found a solution?” Tony asked, keeping all emotion from his voice. Behind him, he heard Steve pause in his dressing as he waited for the answer.
Tony’s eyes widened as he recognized the river and the familiar cityscape in the backdrop. Peter was in New York. He could have walked past him on the street and would have never known. Weren’t Richard and Mary talking about moving to Virginia?! What were they doing in New York??
Steve’s eyes flicker to Bruce and he smiled sadly at him. He whispered, “In the forties, the doctors originally projected I would die around this age…maybe the fates are intervening.”
Steve motioned to remove the robe himself but Tony stopped him and teased, “Patience. This is my present to unwrap.”
“Tony!” Steve gasped, ripping his shirt in two and digging his fingers into Tony’s scalp. He automatically thrust his hips up and pressed his erection into Tony’s chest. He was tempted to rub himself against Tony but embarrassment outweighed his arousal. He could not believe he just did that.
“Got it, Cap,” Tony said with a nod and ran over to the roof access. As soon as he disappeared behind the door, Steve began his ten minute countdown.
It took a lot of cajoling on Steve’s part to get him to move from the spot he was standing but eventually he convinced Tony to take Peter to his bedroom. They walked with a steady, slow tread.
“Outside” was a balcony that overlooked a fantastic view of the city. There was a jacuzzi tucked in one corner, a full outdoor dining set up, some lounge chairs, and a large outdoor kitchen that consisted of a barbeque, mini fridge, and counter space.
Tony stole Steve away from Bruce and they slow danced to the dawdling melody. Tony rested his head on his chest and Steve rested his head on top of his. He whispered into Tony’s hair, “I am the happiest man on the planet.”
Bruce pinched his brow. He had already check Tony’s scalp but he put his hands back on Tony’s skull and ran his fingers through his hair, searching for the hidden injury. Bruce whispered, “You have a big bump back here but I don’t feel any bleeding wound, Tony. Where did the blood come from?”
. I’ll be in and out. I’ll be in my Spidey uniform longer to get there than being in civilian clothes.”
Mary watched Dr. Banner leave the hospital room with hunched shoulders and a resigned expression. She was hidden from his view, being several feet away but had still been able to adjust her frequencies and listen in on the conversation between Dr. Banner and Peter.
His super soldier smirked at him and murmured dryly, “You have a stash of lube on this ship, don’t you?”
“Alright, I give,” Sam said and the thrusters on his wings lessened their output. He landed on the ground and his thrusters totally turned off. He asked, “What the hell is Fuddy-Duddy?”
Tony lightly rested his forehead against Steve’s and murmured, “I love you too. Please be alright, Steve. Don't close your eyes, baby. Stay with me. Don't go now. I can hear sirens? Can you hear the sirens? Open your eyes, please, Steve.”
Jarvis wordlessly grasped his shoulder and nodded to him. The suit turned and, just like that, his AI was gone.
A woman stepped into the room wearing an army uniform. He would have fallen for the disguise if he weren’t already suspicious and looking for discrepancies in her demeanor. She clearly was tense and had something hidden in her hand, a weapon maybe?
“Good morning, Dmitri,” she murmured as she passed him in the hall. The Soldier must have made an interesting expression because Natasha giggled and said, “I think we can rule out Dmitri…Right, Aleksey?”
“Yeah, I know,” Tony sighed. Steve held out the remains of the Iron Man toy and Tony tossed it on top of the other toy.
“No reporters in here,” Tony murmured. He tapped Steve’s ribbons and said, “But there are a bunch of veterans here so don’t be surprised if you’re swarmed soon and start asking about these. Do you wanna bet how long it’ll take for people to figure out you’re Cap?”
With her mission complete, she spared once last glance at Peter’s face before leaving the room. Her SHIELD shadow followed her closely and did not mask his curious expression. She let him think whatever he wanted because she was not going to provide him with any explanations.
“I still can’t tell if you are joking,” Steve said and looked at his best friend with a narrow gaze, trying to determine if he was pulling his leg or not. Bucky’s eyes were sparkling with mirth and Steve couldn’t tell why! Ever since they found out they were having a girl they’ve been calling her Natasha Jr. but did so with a laugh and were not revealing if it was actually going to be her name or not.
AND it's finally done! Thank you all for reading! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did writing it! :)
He was sore from being pounded by the Hulk but had survived the usually fatal ordeal only because of the symbiote. His newfound strength made the agents uneasy.
Peter went back to the other page. The first link was of Tony Stark’s Wikipedia page and the second was his father’s Wikipedia page. He never knew his father had a Wikipedia page, he never thought he was famous enough to have one!
“Three years,” she repeated, affirming. His stomach churned again. He could not remember much about their relationship but…this, knowing she was in Schmidt’s hands, knowing she went through what he had, was the last thing he had wanted to hear.
Steve was not wearing anything in conceal his identity, in fact, he wore a dark navy shirt with a white star, similar to his Captain America uniform. He wanted to draw attention to himself. He wanted there to be no doubt who he was.
Steve exchanges warm smiles with his fiancé and then with best friend. Never in his wildest dreams did he ever imagine his heart feeling so full and happy in a hospital cafeteria of all places. But here they were his family complete, together at last...
Steve gingerly sat down across from him and murmured, “I read both your files. I know what you did for him. SHIELD was…
One by one, the Commandos slipped away from the fire and bunkered down for the night until only Steve and Tony remained. They smiled knowingly at each other from across the dying fire when they were completely alone.
With slicked up fingers, Tony reached behind Steve and Steve arched back into his touch as he breached him. Tony pressed his forehead to Steve’s and gasped into his mouth, “I love you so fucking much.”
Steve continued to wear his disguise and Bruce had usually accompanied them. He too wore his disguise but his face was not as well-known as Steve’s so he was more lax about wearing it.
Wade’s near-instant reply was: ‘Holy-frickity-frack you can have insider knowledge and can help me write the best fanfiction EVER!’
The man had hurt Steve. He broke Steve’s heart and then ripped it from his chest, crushing it further in his grasp…but that heart still belonged to Tony.
She’d already complained multiple times to him about this ever since his true connection to his father was revealed. She probably wasn’t going to let him live it down
Peter tipped his head back and Wade greedily accepted the wordless invitation to love on Peter’s neck some more. Peter melted into his arms as he trailed tiny bites down his neck. Peter wound his arms around the back of Wade’s neck and whispered, “Why was that picture up? Are you already conspiring for the next Valentine’s Day?”
“End hologram,” Tony groaned. They all leaned back into their seats with heavy sighs except for Steve who stood up.
When he growled at Natasha, Bucky was operating on instinct, a trait he had developed as the Winter Soldier. It had been the second time she kneed him in the gut and it was one time too many. He rolled them over again so she was the one pinned to the ground. Natasha retaliated by digging her hands into his throat. He felt the squeeze to his larynx and knew her guard was down. Before she could put up her defenses, he drew back his right fist and punched her across the face. Had he used his metal left arm, he might have punched her head clear off. He still had enough semblance not to kill her.
He loved that woman, she kept him in his place. She was one of the few people he could truly trust. It was why he made her CEO of his company after all.
In the time it took Steve to bring him his favorite moccasin slippers, Tony was able to drink most of the coffee.
The words sent a chill down his spine but what scared him more was the way Steve went still as a statue behind him. Tony’s fingers dug deeper into Steve’s flesh as if he could keep him tethered to Tony and safe from whatever this new future had in store for him.
Tony paused when he had fully circled Steve and slotted a leg between Steve’s thighs and pressed his leg into his crotch. He was happy to feel Steve was already half hard. He pushed one of Steve’s thighs between his legs and rubbed his own growing erection into the hard muscle. They wrapped their arms around each other and Steve stared at him as if memorized.
Above him, Steve and the Soldier continued fight and his boyfriend was begging the other man to stop. He kept calling the Soldier “Bucky” and was enraging the Soldier, making him fight more fiercely.
“Mr. Stark is clearly upset and with good reason,” one of Tony’s lawyers cut in before anymore words could be said. She stepped between Tony and the detectives and continued with a frown, “He is not threatening this department but reacting to distress after he and his
The trial was always there, festering in the back of their minds and it made them more urgent and when they had sex they acted like they might never be able to make love with each other ever again.
The car ride was even quieter than breakfast and Steve never once let go of Tony nor adjust his grip.
Tony looked at the bed with a stare akin to longing and then looked back to Steve to slowly reply, “Yeah, sure, we can do that.”
“Good,” Steve whispered truthfully and relaxed into the humble caress. It was so relaxing that he did not notice leaning into Tony’s side so he could have easier access to Steve’s hand.
Coulson sighed heavily and said, "Captain, the President, the head of the Secret Service, and the head of Whit House Public relations all requested your presence on the President's detail. Everyone is spooked. Scared people do not make wise decision makers. If you go on the detail you will make a lot of people feel safer and make my job a hell of a lot easier."
The cut was bleeding sluggishly and Steve put pressure on it. Tony hissed and Steve admonished, “You should have told me you were hurt!”
“I only know he’s been taken to SHIELD HQ,” Pepper replied and Tony hurried past Pepper to his suit.
“Nothing. His mind was long broken before I attained him. I’m just the next in the long line of owners who have possessed him. He’s been used as an experiment, a puppet, an assassin, and a slave for years…all because his friend did not go looking for him after he fell.”
They just kissed at first. There was no mad dash to remove their clothes. Just like they had been doing in the forest, their hands explored: touching, caressing, and teasing. Only this time Steve didn't want to stop kissing him, he didn't even want to breathe if meant ending the moment.
Steve exchanged looks with Tony again and Steve replied, “Even though what happened was horrible-.” One of the worst parts in his life. “We couldn’t risk it changing…” Steve carded his fingers with Tony’s and Steve continued, “Tony could’ve died if we changed anything for the wrong…”
Peter picked up his head and met Tony’s sympathetic eyes. A single tear escaped and Peter whispered, “You don’t understand…Gwen fell and I jumped after her. I waited until I was close enough and shot my web at her. I caught her but I was too late.” He wrapped his arms around himself. He repeated, “I should not have waited. I should have shot out my web as soon as she started to fall. I killed her. I kil-.”
Steve turned the phone so more of Peter’s face was visible. The baby blinked at the phone and then reached for it with greedy, grasping fingers. Steve pulled the phone back with a chuckle but he didn’t miss the way Tony’s eyes got larger and his face ashen.
Bucky leaned into Steve’s side and gently whispered, “None of the others looked at you like he does.” With his hopes suddenly rising, Steve turned and saw Bucky smiling at him with a soft smirk. Bucky continued, “He’s also befriended you.
One day when Steve came down, carrying Peter on one arm and his sketchbook in the other, he was pleasantly surprised to find the old couch that was probably as old as he was, was gone. In its place was a brand new couch with deep seats, plush cushions, and an attached chaise lounge for him to stretch out his legs. Tony was playing with a hologram, pretending not to watch as Steve came in. Steve sat Peter on the ground and his son toddled over to the couch. He inspected it with a curious eye and ran his hand over the soft leather.
The building held them up so they arrived at the island a little after their anniversary but that just seemed to perfectly picture their relationship: good things happening a little later.
Harry bit down on his lip and mumbled, “She wears a white lab coat…so science stuff. She meets with my dad a lot…”
Natasha did not let her emotions show but she was shocked by his proclamation. She quickly reviewed the possibilities and chose the most likely. She asked softly, “Have you assumed so many names that you’ve forgotten your real one?”
For Peter’s fourth birthday, Steve expected there to be not as much drama as Peter’s third birthday.
Peter rubbed his belly and surmised, “It’s probably because I haven’t been getting as much of Aunt May’s home cooking!”
He was expecting something Hydra related but instead Jarvis relayed, “It appears Thor just arrived on the planet through the Asgardians’ method of interstellar travel.”
It was all Steve had been able to tell him on the subject as Tony had cut him off because they were in the middle of their fight. But it was enough and Tony couldn’t believe he hadn’t thought of it earlier. He’d been researching so many ways of helping Steve and Steve may have already told him of the very thing that could help him. A tentative hope began to grow within Tony and he separated the distance between him and the blond.
The cut stung slightly from the touch but he didn't really feel it. Tony only really noticed that Steve's thumb was now touching the corner of his mouth. It'd be so easy to playfully bite it. Steve's fingers lingered and Tony's eyes were drawn back to his blue gaze.
Wade sighed again but, this time it was more contently. He adjusted his arms around Peter and pulled him into a proper embrace. Peter began to lightly run his fingers across Wade’s spine and Wade closed his eyes as he relaxed.
Tony was the last to testify and he smiled at Steve the entire time as he talked about their relationship. He talked about finally feeling at home with Steve and never feeling so in love or happy with anyone else before. Steve could not help but return the smile.
He snapped the photo. Steve was laying down, propped up slightly on the pillows. He had one arm over his head and wrapped around a pillow. The sheet totally covered him from the waist down but the flush to Steve’s flesh was a telltale sign of what had just occurred.
He willed Venom to wave at Eddie and a few tendrils rose from his shoulder and waved at the other intern.
Tony began to inanely talk about the Hydra gun, explaining the misalignment with some coils inside was the reason it hadn’t worked in the fight. He was indepth with the details and was probably over explaining it but Steve listened with a small smile and made agreeing noises to show he was listening.
Steve and Tony held each other tighter with Osborn’s words, but Tony’s grip tightened to an unbearable extent when the Goblin raised his hand, holding a glowing object.
Harry was quiet on the ride to Oscorp Tower. His gaze was turned inward and was completive. Steve tried to engage him in conversation but the boy only replied in clipped answers and clearly did not want to talk.
In the stillness, he heard the Red Skull again and this time he sounded venomous as he hissed, “Come
Tony laughed and kicked off his shoes. Steve copied the move and Tony replied, “That’s the whole point.” Steve’s eyes widened and his mouth popped open. Tony stared at him with heated eyes as he commanded,” Jarvis, lights at thirty percent and play that music I selected earlier.”
playing in front of them. Tony was going to be going on soon, giving his first interview since the whole mess began. Both Peter and Steve elected to not be included in the program.
“She broke my heart,” Peter whispered as he reflected on the memory of her death. He could still feel her weight on his webbing and the slight slack it gave as her body rebound off the ground. Yes, she broke his heart, “…When I killed her.”
“Wait, let me look at you…” Tony’s eyes took in the robot’s form and he gasped, “You changed back. You – You’re back to normal. Mark 15 and all.”
His stomach ached for sustenance but Steve had no food with him. He jogged to Central Park, planning to sleep there for the night, just as the homeless had done in his era.
. But Steve didn’t have to watch Tony die, in fact, he was there to save him…so what was the pivotal decision he had to make that might change he future?
This time...this time he felt all of that but...he also felt ill. Because he had nowhere to go to escape the danger. The pressure was coming in from all angles and he was seconds away from vomiting or passing out.
Steve’s eyes snapped back to Tony. If this was orchestrated by the Red Skull then he was here for Steve. This had nothing to do with Clint or his family. It was revenge. Against him or Dr. Erskine or both of them. And it was glaringly obvious how he was going to hurt Steve.
Tony’s broken heart was reforming and beating once more. The pain of Steve’s loss was receding and, in its place, was joy and fulfillment. He felt complete again.
“I will take it, sir,” the agent replied. Steve wordlessly handed him his duffel and the man said, “You’ll find this in your quarters on Air Force One.”
is doing to him,” Tony whispered, his voice strained from his suffocating grief, and his face was still pressed to Steve’s hand like he couldn’t meet his eyes.
Iron Man did not react when they entered the room. It stood against the opposite wall and was almost completely hidden behind the time machine when they first entered. Its eyes were not glowing and a fine layer of dust had settled on its shoulders.
“What’s it look like?” Bucky snapped back. He untucked himself from beneath Tony’s arm and pushed him toward Steve. Steve took on all his weight as Bucky said, “I’m gonna get us a Jeep.”
Tony clenched his fists, wanting to kill whoever did that to Bucky. They did it enough times to make him remember and dread it.
Steve’s smile widened and he pulled on the same arm he just pinched in order to pull Tony into his embrace.
Tony’s stomach rolled at the thought but he whispered, “Okay, you take control of my arm though, I won’t be able to do it myself.”
Tony’s mouth twitched into a smile and he murmured, “It was good. The director had a real artistic vision.”
Peter’s heart leapt into his throat and lodged itself there. He gargled, “Y-You mean I c-c-can go home??”
Tony stood and put his laptop down. He could finish the work later. Right now, there was a certain super soldier who needed attention. He crawled onto the bed and Steve grinned excitedly.
Natasha nodded to herself and said, “When we were together, he regained his memories fairly quickly, especially when we found things to trigger them… Maybe it will happen again.”
“I can’t remember anything else other than fighting the mind wipe,” Bucky hissed, clutching his head again as if squeezing his skull could pump out his veiled memories. He ground his teeth in frustration.
Steve smiled in return and hunched over to collect his son in another hug. He whispered, “Thank you, I feel all better…I love you, Peter.”
Tony closed all of the holograms with an angry swing and then knocked over the tools on the table beside him and then stomped over to the closest suit and knocked it over too. He fell down with a sharp curse and then collapsed against his worktable as tears began to flow from his eyes. He looked up and wetly gasped, “
The General’s eyes narrowed and, for a second, Steve saw unease filter across his features. Then the General’s eyes flickered back to Tony’s retreating form and he smirked.
Coulson couldn’t go in there during such a personal moment. Nor could he tell Stark of the doctor’s reasoning for the unexplainable coma…nor could he reveal the other notion starting to form in Coulson’s mind.
When the car came to a stop, Peter quickly scrambled off him and Wade heartily groaned. With sparkling eyes and a smirk, Peter teased, “Patience!”
Shame settled on his shoulders like a heavy weight and left a bitter taste in his mouth. Why did he let it go so far? How could he let it happen?
Ugh, he looked younger. Tony ran his fingers along his chin with a frown. How long would it take to regrow his goatee?
“Yes, please,” Tony groaned. The idea of falling asleep to darkness was still unsettling to him. It felt like a lifetime ago but it was only that morning he was scared awake by experiencing the darkness for the first time. He had thought Steve was dead and the old fear lingered.
long before me. And you are in a relationship with Tony and everyone could see you two are crazy about each other but you still went to James! God, why shouldn’t I be pissed? At you for existing and being so stupid and at him for loving you more than me!? He probably never even loved me.” She spun around and faced the elevator and hissed, “Let me go.”
“Thanks for coming, Captain. Since the Mandarin directly threatened me in his last message, your presence with me makes a lot of people much more at ease,” the President said as he shook his hand.
“And I’ve got Bruce! Plus, give me a functioning computer and I will hack the shit out of this,” Tony said, holding up the flash drive.
“If he was, do you think I’d tell you?” Peter replied dryly and his phone buzzed with a new message. Peter quickly glanced down and saw Wade sent him a bunch of kissey face emojis in reply to his text and Peter smiled sweetly at his screen. He replied with a single kissey face emoji, imaging actually placing the kiss onto Wade’s cheek.
Steve looked down and said, “I asked him to stay. I know you might not like it but he was there for me when I thought you were dead…” Steve bit down on his lip, not knowing how Tony was going to take it, and said, “He kissed me again, Tony.”
Peter was hovering over him a second later and then Steve was next to Peter and grasping Tony’s face, demanding, “Are you alright??”
The past Tony fell but Tony was able to remain standing for now…his hands and feet lost all feeling. He lifted one hand and saw the edges disappearing.
He did hear the burst of concentrated air fill the room with a sharp hiss. The gas took effect almost instantaneously. Peter grew lethargic and he was able to make out Bruce’s voice saying, “We’ll free you, Peter.”
“No, you’re a meatball,” Bucky said. “Any everyone with half a brain knows Steve’s first name. What’s Peter’s middle name?”
“Have you figured out what we are doing for the reveal, by the way?” Steve questioned, innocent to the thoughts going through Tony’s mind.
He got up with a groan and rubbed his hungry belly and, with one glance at the clock on the wall, he saw he missed dinner and Tony’s bedtime. He walked down the hall and poked his head in Tony’s room. From the glow of his Captain America nightlight, he saw his son was fast asleep. Howard silently closed the door and made his way to the kitchen.
“Now why in the hell did I have to find out Steve coming back from the dead from the Gooddamn evening news?!” Dum Dum demanded, his voice rougher with age but still as loud as it was when they last saw him in the 40s.
She staggered back from the remains and stumbled back until she caught herself on a lamppost. For a moment, she struggled to breathe but it all finally came out in a great relieving rush.
Steve winced from the harshness of his voice and felt guilty for having put it there. He wanted to argue that he did it for Peter…that Tony would have done so too but then Tony sat beside him on the bed and cradled Steve’s hand on his lap. Tony looked so fragile. The tough exterior he always wore was gone and Steve realized he’d done that to him. As he thought about it, he realized he had never had gotten so hurt like this and he would probably be in the same state if it had been Tony in his place…Tony not only lost Peter…he nearly lost Steve too.
He was still alive. Wade choked back a laugh and forwent hugging Peter to apply pressure on his wounds instead. Steve gasped and helped him apply pressure to Peter’s wounds.
Suddenly, though, the scene changed and Howard was leaning against his desk, holding the very notebook Tony had sitting on the coffee table in front of him. Tony’s version was obviously older and was complete again with the old pages reinserted, but Howard’s looked fresh and Tony wondered if there were pages still to be filled in there.
Steve looked up at him. They weren't this close to each other physically since yesterday. Their eyes met and they both searched each other’s gazes. Steve had no idea what Tony was looking for but Steve was looking for the reason behind his words. Why did he risk himself for Steve? Was it more than friendship or comradery?
Tony had read the files so he knew what to expect but it still made his heart hurt to hear the confusion in the other man’s voice. He didn’t even remember his name. They completely erased him.
Marcel questioned him all day. He asked him questions firstly about himself, about his job, about his relationship with Tony, and about his nonexistent relationship with Tyler. When he started questioning Steve about Tyler, he automatically tensed, expecting the same outburst from Tyler when he denied knowing her again. She was silent but glared at Steve throughout his testimony.
Tony rolled his eyes and said, “Tell that old-bat I am not going anywhere so she’s just going to have to get used to it.”
“I’m the one who overthinks things, remember?” Tony retorted jokingly when he saw Steve’s expression. Steve rolled his eyes and lifted his boxing gloves. Tony’s eyes focused on something over his shoulder and Steve would have punched him for not paying attention until Tony stated, “Wait, here he comes.”
Venom warned that he would not be able to do it for long but Norman had sacrificed several employees in order to give the symbiote enough strength to fight.
“It’s probably my skin overreacting to being smothered by the bandages all the time,” Tony brushed it off with a light sigh. Steve never had seen skin react like that to an irritant but, then again, he’d never seen someone with a machine imbedded in their chest either...
Steve and Thor ran to them as Hulk tossed Tony to the ground. His heart felt like it was lodged in his throat, watching the way his soulmate’s body flopped.
“Do you want this just because you think you might not…” Steve couldn't finish the sentence, not wanting to even voice the horrid yet very plausible notion.
, Tony.” Steve dropped his head forward until it lightly bumped into his boyfriend’s shoulder. The relationship between them may no longer be fake but its history was…He murmured, “Maybe we should just tell the truth…”
Harry grinned shyly then crossed the room and pulled him out of bed. His nose wrinkled and he whined, “You stink, Parker.”
Peter took Wade’s silence as enough of an answer and laughed humorlessly. He looked up at Wade with a sad smile and interlocked his fingers behind Wade’s neck. Peter stated, “See? It’s not possible so…let’s just go back to kissing.”
The bright light associated with Cable’s time travel device burned brightly where his parents had fallen. From the sparks, two figures emerged: Cable and…Pops?
Peter snorted and elbowed him in his side. He said, “Seriously, Wade! I’m am not going to come out with the only word being a tag to tacos!”
what he did, Pepper. Every word I read and every image I saw will be etched into my mind forever and you want to know why?” He let go of the handles and finally met her eyes as he stated, “In 1945, I let him fall. I let him fall right into those bastards’ hands and he is like this
“We’re going to drown the media in so much lovey-dovey moments that it’ll be impossible for them to assume we are anything but in love,” Tony confidently stated and Steve did not doubt him.
“Oooh, you’re slick,” Tony chuckled. Tony pulled them to a stop in front of the arcade and gasped, “Oh, we’ve got to go in there!” He pulled Steve forward and exclaimed, “C’mon!”
“I’m here, beloved…I made it…” Tony reminded him and pulled him into his embrace. Steve pressed his face into Tony’s chest and wound his arms around his waist tightly.
From there his father’s internet history ended. A history Peter never knew existed because he never thought to search. He believed his aunt when she said his parents were plain scientists who had yet to get a foot up in the world. What else had she not told him?
Tony lightly grasped his forearm and said, “I went through this too…It’s okay – It’s good even. It’s healthy. It’s a part of the healing process.”
“You’re late,” Natasha informed Steve and Peter as they stepped into the gym. She sat on the training mats and was stretching to touch her toes with ease. She stood in one fluid motion and said, “You know what being late means, Peter.”
“Jarvis will come. He’s always there when I need him,” Tony replied, his eyes began to fall and he repeated drowsily, “Always…”
“You don’t look too busy,” Tony retorted. Steve saw the back of Norman’s head raise a tad then, after a short pause, he turned his chair to face them.
His footsteps echoed through the body of the plane and made his heartbeat faster. Where would Cap be? At the helm with the plane’s radio, where Carter last heard him? Or by the parachutes, trying to make one last escape?
Pepper texted Steve and Tony in a group message and told them to be downstairs in five minutes and to be ready to face the press.
They went down the hall to rejoin the rest of the team. Clint had his bow drawn and was eyeing a group of the surviving captive Hydra agents. Hulk held the Red Skull, just like he had when they had captured Barnes. Schmidt hung limply in his arms but venomously glared at them as they entered. His glare narrowed when he saw Steve and Natasha were alive.
Steve had been hurt many times throughout the years and should have had scars riddling his body but his skin was flawless. Steve’s back encumbered his vision and was huge and rippled with muscles strong enough to lift thousands of pounds. But even with all his strength, Steve had the gentlest touch with which he had lovingly rocked Peter to sleep and could make sweet, tender love to Tony. This back, which glowed under the luminosity of Tony’s arc reactor, was strong but the man it held was even stronger in spirit and heart…
“Little robots, use my reactor to heat up my thrusters to max setting and we’re going to turn this Sandcastle into glass!” Tony frantically yelled.
It broke Steve’s heart to see Tony so sick. He adjusted the blankets around him and then gently lay a cold compress onto his forehead. He released a relieved breath when he didn’t wake and then whispered to the slumbering man, “Hold on a little longer…”
“Now you know how I feel after walking in on you and Pops!” Peter retorted, playfully pushing his shoulder.
The Avenger’s made an effort to eat together for breakfast and dinner at least so that morning was just like any other breakfast. Steve had made a huge platter of pancakes, a good portion had already been removed for consumption. They had six different syrups sitting at various points on the table. Steve was particularly fond of the blueberry one and Peter loved the strawberry flavor.
