He indulges – pulls Dean closer by hooking his legs round him. This throws the delicious rhythm off balance; Dean withdraws his hand, but allows him to steal another kiss, desperate and sweet.
Crushing down the blinding panic, he seized the handle of the desk drawer and frantically yanked it open. There inside, the only thing inside, was a small, blue inhaler.
He aches and clenches around the base of Dean’s cock, feeling stretched, impaled around him. The way his skin pulls over his hips as he reclines back, leaves him feeling beautiful, powerful. The sounds Dean is making, shy at first, but growing louder, indulging, beginning to babble.
Castiel, to his credit, does not gloat, or even smile triumphantly. His eyes look serious, as if he’s been handed a trial from God instead of the task of getting Dean off, he thinks. Then feels a brief flicker of shame at the blasphemy at the thought. It’s so wrong but his body even likes that in this messed up state he’s in. His cock pulses in Cas’ grip, and that’s all it takes to make the angel react.
Castiel tangled his legs with Dean’s, pulling him closer. Dean threw an arm over his waist, casually drawing him in as he snaked a sheet over them.  They lay like that, within the sleepy-warmth of an embrace, room smelling of sex, raw and real. Castiel thoughtlessly touched Dean’s cheek, lightly grazing before tracing his lower lip. He kissed him slowly before settling that hand on his hip, needing the smoothness. He tingled all over, pleasantly numb.
“Yes!” Castiel shouts, cutting him off, sliding up to meet him. Dean is lifting his hips now, trying to reach even deeper inside and Castiel could cry with how good it feels as he presses down. He can’t stay still, whole body jolting, cock being rubbed between them, too sensitively. He feels spilt around Dean, and when he shoves in again, they both cry out deeply. He hits that wonderful spot just right and Castiel clenches, writhes, moans against Dean’s lips (Cas has a moment to think that they got it wrong. If God didn’t want homosexual acts to be committed, why make this feel so wonderful, so right and pleasurable? Because He is indifferent to sexual orientation, that’s why. Who could be hated for having loved?).
Cas took in his flushed features, the helpless moans he was making, that feverish look in his eyes. Even his hips contradicted his words, shoving greedily into Castiel’s hand, growing sticky. “Why?”
Dean didn’t meet his eyes, but Sam knew what he was thinking. He’d seen the way Dean had fretted at the hospital whilst the doctor’s worked on Cas. The agony when he’d seen the extent of what the angels had done to him. How he’d furiously paced, mind closed off and face a blackened storm. Fists clenched like he wanted to tear the perpetrators apart.
He doesn’t realise he’s saying the words out loud until he sees the look of twisted sympathy of Metatron’s face. It’s practically sincere and that scares him most of all.
He slyly snakes a hand between their bodies so he can wrap it around Dean‘s cock, so hard and practically aching. He thumbs at the tip and Dean shudders, eyes slipping shut. His fingers slip harder into Cas. Their moans intertwine, a delicious chorus. “You
He felt Dean wrap his hands around his wrists, very carefully (the nerves were still damaged from being restrained for so long, they still kept throbbing, an unpleasant reminder). Dean pulled them away, hovered closer to meet his eyes.
Metatron’s grin is plain nasty. “And isn’t that what you’ve both always wanted? One big happy family, you got your brother from another mother back?” He laughs in a way that implies he knows exactly what their relationship is, and that it most certainly cannot be described as ‘brotherly’. Dean stiffens his spine, reminds himself he has nothing to be ashamed of as far as Cas is concerned.
Castiel grins at that because it is strangely comforting and he’s touched by his anger. He can’t help but notice Dean’s hair, stuck up all over. His lips look red and swollen, eyes soft and heavy. He sighs and says reluctantly: “It shouldn’t be like this anyway. Not with you feeling so angry with your brother.”
“That sucks Cas. Real awful.” He says softly. Cas doesn’t want his sympathy and Dean knows it. “I guess we owe him a neck stabbing, the son of a bitch.”
They settle back into an uneasy truce, an imitation of life before. It doesn’t work. Dean knows how much Castiel wants now, and everyone’s mad at each other. Sometimes, Cas can hear the brothers yelling at each other no matter what room he’s in.
“Wait!” He does. Heaven help him, but he does. “Castiel…” Metatron considers causing Dean to shudder. “You know I did feel bad for what I did to that guy, it was a mean trick, I’ll grant you. But really, If you think about it,  I gave him a
“Go with what feels good.” Castiel nods frantically, echoing words from before. He decides right there and then that he won’t ask Dean to stop even if it does hurt. He wants to feel it all. Every last snag of humanity. It’s what he wants. What he needs and deserves.
Finally, he turns. Sees Dean two steps away from him on the open roof top. His jaw is clenched, arms folded against the cold or as if he’s had enough of Castiel’s issues. The thought nearly makes him laugh. They are so far beyond just ‘having issues.’ The taste of bitterness and sick humour leaves him reeling. He wonders if this is what madness feels like.
Dean simply rolled his eyes when Cas had pointed this out at midnight as they searched the dead man’s office for whatever was keeping Marty rooted there. He’d been cremated over a week ago so there was no body left to burn.
He doesn’t say any of this. Doesn’t want to be strong and push Dean away. He needs him to feel alive. He runs his hands down Dean’s ribs, pressing in, pulling him closer.
He babbles more swearwords. Apologises for needing this so damn badly, for always wanting this, for never being enough. A messy confession of love tumbles out earnestly, between begging him to continue and more moaning.
“It’s what I have to think,” He corrects, mind spinning. “Do you have any idea how much I want you right now? Any idea at all?” He shakes his head, a bitter smile on his lips. He’s being deliberately confrontational, hoping to shock the angel into leaving. But there’s no reaction at all. Not the one he was hoping for anyway. Castiel’s jaw twitches. His lips pressed together tightly. But his expression is on lockdown.
“Argh! Gross Sam! First of all, we weren’t ‘going at it’. He adds venomous air-quotes, going red. “Just kissing - stop pulling faces! - and second of all, don’t go calling him our brother like I’m some kind of incest-happy pervert!”
Castiel had at first pretended not to notice. Had not broken the comfortable silence. Instead, he had snuck glances at the man in the doorway, trying not smile and failing once he‘d accidentally caught Dean‘s eye. It was a goofy moment, one that would be preserved in his memory like a snapshot in time. Even if he was sure not to scrutinise Dean’s expression too closely - which had been a look of fondness with swirling thoughts circling underneath. He wished he could read them again, and not for the first time.
No answer except for the dip of his bed as Dean prowls closer. And then, dear God, he’s crawling up his body, straddling him, weight causing the sheets to pin him to the bed. Castiel has to fight the urge to throw him off. This is Dean. Not some dangerous enemy. Not a danger to him anyway.
. No comforting whispers from the garrison. No flicker of the alien humanity that was Jimmy Novak. No Dean to offer comfort with his body and presence alone. They haven’t progressed to that yet. It’s their secret. He wants to cling to him right now. To open up and let Dean push inside. To be filled again, to take comfort and
“I always want you.” Castiel answers automatically and Dean has time to think thank God. It’s all he’s ever wanted to hear.
“The I suppose you’d better do it.” He growls, calling them cowards with one look. They had to tie up one human to get the best of him. They hate him, but still they fear him. His name lives on.
“You see Castiel, you’re responsible for getting us kicked out of heaven.” His voice is low and so dangerous. He never breaks eye contact all the while. “Now my friend Lia here, would be happy to just carve you up and walk away. But I think you know more than you’re telling. So let’s compromise, yeah? Let’s see what secrets I can carve out of you.”
Of course it bloody hurts, he feels like shouting. But Castiel knows how this works. He gets the gist now. He’s slick inside, but the hardness of Dean is still stretching him. It feels uncomfortable, but full. He responds by placing a hand on the small of Dean’s lower back, locking eyes, and pressing down. Hard.
When Castiel damns the scribe out loud and explains his reasoning behind it, Dean roars with laughter. And that’s good. Castiel likes that. He can feel the vibrations against his body. Can share his happiness.
“Cas!” Dean groans again, like a prayer, like Castiel is his salvation. Cas smiles at that thought. Sex is such a small part of being human, right now it feels like everything.
Castiel has to roll his eyes at that. He goes through the motions for a little while, trading soft hits to humour Dean. Until his patience runs out and he just has to knock Dean’s feet from under him with a low, swift kick. He pins him to the soft floor, hands either side of Dean’s head so his eyes go wide.
“Do you forget that I’m nearly old as time itself?” He presses the full length of his body to Dean’s, suppressing a smile at Dean’s shocked expression and  resulting light shiver. “I do know how to fight, Dean. Not that I don’t appreciate your efforts to educate me.”
Dean’s eyes are earnest and Castiel nods slightly before closing his eyes, lost in the sensation. When Dean’s finger circles inside, it’s electric. He jolts and moans appreciatively, rubbing his thigh against Dean‘s member. He can’t tear his eyes away from Dean‘s face, flushed red and so beautiful in its pleasure, his mouth a delicate cupid’s bow every time he gasps in bliss. They trade kisses with swollen lips, taking their time, Cas' leg quirked up slightly.
Castiel is using both hands now to trail idle patterns over Dean’s body. “What?” He asks a little shyly, feeling hopeful. He’d quite like to do more stuff to and with Dean as he feels almost recovered. It’s a struggle to remain so calm when the sight before him makes his blood want to pool south.
“If he became an angel again, even a pretty-boy angel, there’s no guarantee he’d be the same.” He sighs, corners of his mouth twitching. “He’d probably go back to being the original soldier boy you first met, remember? That cold default killer that Naomi turned him into millennia ago?”
They were gasping, swallowing, speeding up. Their combined cries of pleasure creating a sinfully beautiful chorus. There was no rush, just the natural build up the that final great rush of pleasure, inevitable and welcome.
His hands find their way to Cas’ hair. But it doesn’t matter when your other half is ten times stronger. He can push down, or tug at the locks and it doesn’t affect him at all. Luckily. Dean knows at some point he will be horrified at the way he tried to use Castiel, attempting to forcefully buck into his generous, wonderful mouth. It’s not him. But Cas can stop him. Cas is going to save him.
“Maybe I just wanted to get on top of you again.” Dean clarifies waggling his eyebrows like a fiend. It makes Cas laugh until Dean presses his body down in a way that has him shuddering with pleasure. Unmistakably, he’s not the only one affected by their closeness. He experimentally rubs the firmness of his thigh against Dean’s growing hardness, swallowing the gasp the action elicits. Castiel feels hot, light-headed. Hours of nothing around Sam, secret smiles, brushing past each other as they remain separate. Trying hard not to stare, to remember. Are they going to be reunited, right here on this cold floor? A desperate act of lust and recklessness? He doesn’t think he minds at all.
He sounds anxious now, maybe trying to convince himself. Castiel wishes he could read his mind again. He stares at him intently, as if he could. Dean squirms under such sharp focus but doesn’t break contact.
After, they just held each other – something so small that means so much. Dean wiped them down with a pair of boxers, limbs heavy, and after discarding them, rolled back into the heat of Castiel’s arms.
That is hope rewarded when Castiel kisses him. And it’s hungry this time, something eager in the movements, though still careful, measured. It’s real. His mouth is clumsy but determined. There’s something so authoritative in the way Cas kisses, the way he holds him, like he’s on a mission. Dean grips his arms with shaking hands, his own kisses nothing short of desperate, ridiculously grateful. As he licks his way into Cas’ mouth, sucks gently, nips at his lip, wanting everything at once.
“I’ve always wanted you.” Dean answers bitterly, automatically. He knows he’ll regret this honesty when his blood has cooled, when his body is no longer screaming for Cas, but right now he can’t care. He’ll admit anything to get Cas to stop looking at him like that. Like he’s devastated this isn’t real (he hopes that’s what that look means anyway. They’re not fools. They both know how the other feels. They’ve just never been brave enough to admit it).
Castiel wishes now more than ever that he could still fly. He could get what they need in less than a minute.
“She was my wife.” Cas replies simply. “Though not lawfully of course, having no identity. It’s all a bit of a blur. Like it happened to someone else…”
The image does have a certain appeal to it but Castiel understands. “Having the same problem,” He blurts out, causing Dean to laugh a little. That laugh is good, it’s his Dean, not the slightly intimidating dirty-talker of before.
He fingers the edge of his collar subconsciously.  The bruise – a hickey as is the technical term – left him with mixed emotions. Slightly dismayed that he was human enough to bruise so easily and undeniably aroused to an extent.  It was a possessive mark. On his body. Made by Dean. A sign to the world that he had been somebody’s for a while. Someone cared enough, got lost enough in his body to want to leave a mark behind. A brand almost…
“You’re s-so good,” he pulls back, let’s go of Cas briefly to cup his face. Castiel clings to him, pushes up. Dean traces his lip with his thumb and Castiel places a kiss to the tip, flicks his tongue against it. “You’re beautiful.” Dean murmurs, before groaning as he grips him once more, slides in just right, hips bumping forcefully.
“It was incredible.” He answers ardently without thinking, referring to their time together, because it was. His legs go wobbly at the mere thought and-
Dean’s jaw clenches but his eyes are steely, accustomed to patching up himself and his brother. “Must be weird for you, first battle wound and all.”
WARNING: Chapter contains violence and scenes of torture. Though it's not all doom and gloom, consider yourself warned.
The question seems to catch Dean up short. He opens and closes his mouth in a way that reminds Castiel of baby birds waiting to be fed by their mother. He may not have a grip on emotions yet, but he doubts that Dean is expressing similar sentiments as an infant bird. No. This is confusion. This is irritation. He files the labels away neatly. He experiences them every day now too.
Dean moved back, smiling sadly. He held his hands up as if in surrender. “ Hey I got time. All the time in the world for you. Just call me a monk. Brother Dean.”
Dean ran his hands down his spine, Swirled patterns into his skin. Castiel shifted, sighing into Dean’s throat. He was frustrated, yes. But also warm, comfortable and loved. They remained lying like that for a few minutes, warm and familiar, uncertain of how to proceed.
“Well I dunno Cas, lube perhaps? Condoms? What do you think?” He swears again, sounding increasingly desperate. “We’ll just have to go with what feels good.” He repeats. “So unprepared…”
“We passed a motel on the way here,” Castiel points out helpfully, sounding casual though he feels anything but.
"Get out." He commands, voice husky, staring at his feet. His face is on fire. Not just his face. His whole body feels as if aflame. He feels tight. His clothes are constricting against his skin, causing him to practically moan as he paces the room looking at anything but the angel.
“Can we not tell Sam?” Dean pauses, looking away for a moment, almost guilty. “Not just yet anyway. He’s got a lot to deal with and…”
His fingers grip Cas’ soft hair and he just about bucks into the sturdy warmth of him. Any other man would have been taken aback by such a sudden, forceful kiss, but not Cas. He’s still in the same place. He’s not just a man. He’s so strong, it makes Dean want him more. He's never wanted anyone so badly his entire life.
“Given the circumstances, I’m glad to hear it.” Sam says nonchalantly, eyebrow quirked with wry amusement.
“I mean, I want you to fuck me,” Dean whispered hotly into his ear, almost panting. He ran his tongue around the edge of Cas’ ear, teasingly, with a light scrape of teeth that had Cas shuddering. But it was okay. He was in Dean’s arms. He got him. He was safe.
“Dean!” He had frantically run to him, heart in his mouth, terrified of the lifeless figure, imagining a thousand different scenarios in which his world was gone. Because that was how it had felt.  A life without Dean… It was more frightening than no life at all. He couldn’t heal anymore. What if he was too late? He was supposed to bring Dean home to his ailing brother, to protect him. What if he –
Food. Angel Castiel never really gave a damn about food. It tasted of molecules. It was fuel for humans, practical and nothing to do with him. Sometimes food was part of human social interactions, or just shovelled in so a person could keep going. And he thought the whole process of digestion, quite frankly, was disgusting.
“Hang on, wait a minute Cas!” His eyes were bright with fever but still sharp. “Where’s Dean? He hasn’t filled me in on how the hunt went. Not like him.”
He hears Dean swear under his breath again before he tears his gaze away to pull out his wallet and throw a few bills on the table.
But Dean never got to finish that sentence. Or to catch his breath back just then. Because Castiel had gracelessly pulled him up by the shoulders, forgetting all about his smarting hands, cupped the back of his head with one hand and kissed him.
He scrubs at his eyes, wiping cooling tear tracts away, trying to breathe steady. He won’t go to Dean. Not like this. Even if he is the one thing that could begin to make him feel whole again. Their first time together should not be about despair. It’s hard to remember this when his skin is itching. When the craving for Dean’s touch runs so deep, he has to dig his fingers into his palms to distract himself. Force his body not to seek shelter in Dean’s room.
He thinks he’s kind of addicted to touching Dean, but he sadly complies, letting go so he can pull his own underwear off without a trace of embarrassment. Dean’s order was kind of arousing.
Dean pauses as he pulls on his jacket. “Oh right,” his face falls as he remembers his little brother’s presence. Castiel represses the feelings of hurt that Dean wants to keep him a secret. There’s no sense in pushing him after all. He’s already pushed enough.
He does clean the bite on his shoulder, even if the skin is unbroken. It looks angry - puffy, and there’s a little circle of bruises forming the shape of Dean’s mouth, some purpling. He shakes his head with faint amusement. It was hot at the time but now he looks like a damn chew toy.
There’s a few seconds of mind-bending bliss that expand into an eternity of white lights behind closed eyes, pleasure so sharp it blurs into pain, an unbearable, blissful release.
When the words make Dean smile, Castiel has to kiss him because it’s open and honest. Dean with-out the bravado. He runs his tongue along the seam of his lips then whispers: “More.”
He huffs at that. “Maybe I wanted to make you flustered.” Castiel suggests, though he was doing nothing of the sort. “And you still haven’t answered my question.” He insists, voice low.
“Sorry!” He immediately adjusts his grip, but doesn’t let go. He can’t. Doesn’t want to stop. Doesn’t know how to stop touching. He studies Dean’s face very closely, inches from his own. He shifts his hand slowly, relishing the soft warmth, a layer over that hard need. All for him. This makes him a little light-headed. He knows he’s doing something right when Dean’s eyes fall shut and he rocks into his grip, just a little.
“Yeah but I don’t think daddy is really paying much attention now lately, do you? No new body for our little Castiel. You’d never see him again.” His smile is malicious, enjoying the obvious pain on Dean’s face. He can’t hide it.
He sucks at Dean’s lower lip, remembering how much he likes it and is rewarded with something akin to a growl and a longer, slower grind that has his mouth watering and every drop of blood running south. He’s shamelessly returning the gesture before he knows it, feeling like a wild animal because it’s crazy, dirty and good to just rut against him like this. He doesn’t feel an ounce of embarrassment at the desperate sounds he’s making. He wants this - has wanted this for so long. Rationality at bay.
He feels like rolling Dean off the bed then. He was being entirely serious. It’s a good thing he no longer has his powers. He would smite a pharmacy to get what they need. Dean is keeping him waiting and he’s so painfully turned on, frustrated and in love, he could cry and laugh at the same time. It’s a little hysterical. Hormones are a serious business, he realises. He wonders if it feels this way for everybody. If it leaves everyone feeling held to ransom like this.
“Come on now, it’s alright. You’re strong, you’re just…in recovery mode,” Dean murmured carefully.  Castiel couldn’t help but smile at Dean’s sensitive words.
“What is what?” Dean’s eyes widen too innocently as he takes a sip of his soda, lips pursing around the straw in a way Castiel has to admit is rather enticing. He has had to wear his shirt collar up at an awkward angle to the hide the mark Dean left against his skin. They haven’t mentioned telling Sam about the changes in their relationship, but he knows it’s best to be discreet until absolutely certain.
“Jesus. I really went to town on you didn’t I?” He sucks in a breath that makes Cas shiver when it skims down his chest. He sounds like an unusual combination of bitter and turned on. Castiel tilts his head, examines his expression as Dean tracks the movement, eyes fixed the bruise.
Dean rolls onto his back and Cas has to fight to keep eye contact. “Seriously, Cas. A slice of apple pie after sex… You got no idea.”
When Castiel folds his arms faux-huffily, Dean sighs, grinning like a cat that’s got the cream, eyes glinting. “Fine.”
“Never mind that now,” The angel stuffs his hands into his pockets, making himself seem even smaller somehow, less threatening. Dean doesn’t trust it for one second. This man is a snake. “What is it that you wanted anyway? Make it quick. Being King of Heaven is a pretty time consuming job.”
“What are you blabbering on about?” Dean practically growls. “You know, for someone who’s so short of time, you don’t half love to hear yourself talk…”
“What?” His lips are numb now, and there’s this pain spreading from his chest to the pit of his stomach. He’s flushed with rage and something akin horror. This can’t be true. It’s
“I can’t take advantage of you like this.” His voice sounds firm but he doesn’t pull away, Not even when Dean presses a gentle kiss against his cheek. His eyes fall shut. Lashes brushing Dean’s cheek. “You need to stop.”
“Like this, Cas?” He whispers, huskily once they’ve pulled apart. His eyes are beyond predatory. Like he wants to devour Castiel. “Exactly like this? Face to face while I fuck you?”
He wishes bitterly that he could have killed them. Really killed them, slowly, painfully, not just banished to Neverland. that was too easy. They could have survive.
Castiel instinctively knows his answer will affect any sexual relations they have in the future so he chooses his words carefully. “I feel fine.”
They lock eyes and Dean has to burrow his face into Castiel’s neck upon the sight. “Oh God, keep touching yourself…” Dean begs in his ear, unable to help as that would mean releasing his grip on Castiel’s body, losing his angle which is too perfect.
He grins and dips back into Cas’ body without so much as a warning so he can repeat the action, causing Castiel to yelp. This time, when Castiel moans, he doesn’t withdraw. He does it again, more confidently. Harder, a little faster, twisting inside so pleasure zips up Cas’ spine. Castiel’s fingers shift to Dean’s body, scrabbling to find purchase and they slip up his back, haul him closer, pushing Dean deeper inside as an accidental consequence.
Dean pauses. He fidgets. Doesn’t meet Castiel’s eyes. This only increases Cas’ curiosity. He sits still and waits for it to come, still so patient.
But then the hands are on his belt, unbuckling, unbuttoning, pulling his jeans down so he is no longer confined. His eyes shoot open when Cas’ hand gingerly wraps around him, over-stimulating against the cotton of his boxers. He leaks into the material, so eager.
“What do you want me to do?” Cas asks once he’s pulled away and Dean’s cheeks flame at that. How can he say what he needs, now, right now…
“He came back before-“ Dean murmurs through numb lips, barely aware of what he is saying, suddenly feeling a chill go through his entire body.
He loves him. He knows it. It may have slipped out, between the babble and the begging. The groans and snarls. The cries of “Yes!” “Cas!” “Mine!” “Fuck!” and “Please!” “S-so Good.” It’s all he can say, a constant cycle.
“Please say you’re not considering contacting him?” Sam asked, on the verge of exasperation. He ran his hands through his crazy hair, standing up so he could walk up to Dean, shake him if necessary.
They barely make it inside when Dean’s hands are holding his face so that he can press insistent kisses against his mouth, slipping from rough and easy into desperate and bruising. They’re turned around somehow. That’s definitely the door against his back, closing with a final thump as Dean presses him against it. His hands are a gentle contrast in his thick hair. One of his own hands finds the firmness of Dean’s waist and settles there, gripping hard, pulling him closer. The other rests against the warmth at the back of his neck.
“No. It’s fine. Sam’s fine…” Dean sighs, hating every moment of this. Having to bargain and reason with this creature, knowing he dumped a load of murderous angels on to his planet. That he tricked and manipulated Cas, before slicing his throat open, stealing his grace, his identity.
“You’re adorable.” Dean proclaims, washing the last bite down with coffee. Cas follows suit, meeting Dean’s eyes. He
“Trust me, I know.” He grinned smugly and Cas just had to collect that smile with another kiss, drawn to his light. “We gotta do
It’s a sweet and tender moment but not terribly honest. His words imply they are friends who now have sex. Castiel isn’t ignorant. He knows they are much more than that to each other – always have been - and feels a flicker of annoyance that this is what Dean is reducing them to.
“Dean…how do you know he’d even survive the process? Anna’s body blew up.” Sam said, delicately voicing one of his concerns.
“Ahh.” Dean bites his lip and Cas thumbs it from that grip with his free hand, kisses any mark away.
It’s gritty and real and the noises Dean’s making are incredible, he’s almost sobbing. Castiel wants to keep every one of them. How will he ever stop wanting to hear them? He sounds like he’s had an epiphany, groaning so deeply, Cas can feel it reverberate against his chest where they’re pressed together so tightly. He strokes Dean’s hair shakily, murmurs messy encouragement. Orders him to move.
“I didn’t ask for an opinion, though I thank you for your concern.” He adds as an afterthought. “I’m just letting you know of my intentions and that I do not need a minder.”
“I am not. But it is hard to control sometimes.” Castiel admits, wiping his eyes hurriedly with the sleeves of his coat.
Sam tried not to smile. “Look, just promise me you’re not going to running off to find that Metadouche.” He said, coining one of Dean’s nicknames. “Or at least, make sure you talk to Cas about this first. He may not even want to be an angel again.”
He glances nervously at the profile of the hunter. His eyes are firmly fixed on the road, jaw set, hands clenching tight on the steering wheel. Cas almost wishes Dean would play one of his noisy tapes, just to break the silence. He swallows hard and looks away from his friend, hands fidgeting in his lap. He’s wearing a plain, dark suit, nothing fancy. Similar enough to the one he spent many years wearing, for comfort. He plucks at the smooth material of the pants, before glancing back at Dean and sighing.
Sweat eases their way, he ruts against Dean’s hip, harder than he’s ever given, getting so close. Dean’s hand keeps slipping against Castiel’s thigh and he has to keep hitching it up to adjust his grip. His other hand is restless. It bites into his hip, scratches down his chest, cups his jaw so he can press merciless kisses at the right angle. They leave sticky marks against each other’s skin as they fall together. It is nothing short of explosive.
only a punch bag, Dean thinks sombrely each time he strikes. He’s starting to think it’s not enough. There’s no challenge. The bag takes his punches but doesn’t fight back. There’s no rush, no adrenaline, just this. Endless frustration, anger and an underlying current of fear. He grunts with every hit, sweating from exertion as the bag swings wildly on its strained, clanking chains.
He can feel the curve of Dean’s smile against his cheek. “I think you did too. Pretty sure actually.”
Those words send a shiver of lust and impatience down his spine as he remembers the last time he heard them a day ago. Cas’ body pressed against his, mouth open and wanting. He’s suddenly aware of the way his clothes constrict and cling to his body, drenched in sweat. He’s tired underneath it all, so tired, hands throbbing. He forgot to wrap tape around his fists and when he looks at them, realises his knuckles are split open. The bright gashes of red bring him back to himself. His nerves are thrumming from the strain of today’s vigorous training session, and the intensity of the situation.
Cas knows how to do this. And well. He doesn’t care how, or when. His wet, warm mouth offers sweet relief when it was too much. Has anyone ever done more for him? And it’s Castiel. Another layer of unreality that doesn’t feel true. It’s surreal – everything he ever wanted, though not like this. One possessive thought buzzes through his mind: he’s fucking Cas. His Castiel.
“No more.” Cas mumbles, pulling himself upright, massaging his neck as he tries to catch his breath.
“Whoa Cas. Do you really think that’s a good idea?” Sam had enquired, quite reasonably. A dusty volume of demon lore spread out across the old oak table in front of him. Still on a ‘cure a demon’ kick it seemed.
“It’s ok. This is fine… Dean?” Castiel’s rumble of a voice goes right through him and he has to bite his lip to stop himself moaning, burying his face against him, until they are a mess on the padded floor of the bunker’s gym. Castiel sounded so breathless, so vulnerable as if he was trying to be sure. “You’re allowed to want, Dean. You’re allowed to feel this.”
He also feels pain now. He’s found he has a very low threshold for dealing with it too since it is all new to his human body.
Their hips are moving of their own accord now, fluidly and hard. Castiel has his hands on Dean’s waist, slipping in sweat, hard enough to bruise. They’re making noises like animals, trying to stifle them though hard kisses and bites. They breathe against each other’s mouth, explosions of air, sweating under too many layers. It shudders over the line of discomfort and Dean seeks to rectify this. He slips out of Castiel’s grasp, bobbing back to kiss away the noise of protest he makes. Cas’ arms feel empty during the time it takes Dean to slip his pants off but the sight is worth it in the end.
It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Dean, quite the opposite. It was the fact that his body no longer reacted to the unexpected with eagerness and excitement so much anymore. Just shock. And occasionally some fear. He could never completely relax. Couldn’t allow himself to lose control.
He bites down the joking response of ‘nothing…yet,’ and blushes at his own impatience. He’s pulling Dean’s jeans down anyway, slowing his actions, wriggling out of his own. The hunter can only stare up in awe, eyes wide as saucers.
There’s an edge to Dean’s voice that Sam cannot argue with. Castiel buries his face into the warmth of Dean’s jacket, closes his eyes, inhales slowly. He hears Sam’s footsteps as he hurries to comply.
“…Just make sure you both know where you stand.” Sam concludes gently. “I don’t want you guys getting hurt.”
Cas didn’t think. He just knew. He knew they must have overlooked something. It must still be here. So small, so crucial to life…
Castiel folds his arms and waits for him to continue, to explain. And it better be good. “I only meant… that I’m not that experienced when it comes to sex with guys. That’s all. Try no experience actually. None. Nada. Zero.”
“Cas! Cas! Oh God. What have they done to you?” Yes, he decides. That’s definitely his face. He’s kneeling in front of him, eyes furious, jaw set tight with worry. He’s cutting his hands free so recklessly, he nicks Cas’ flesh. He barely feels it but suddenly Dean is swearing, apologising, gathering Castiel to him. He’s sturdy, he’s real and he’s the most beautiful thing Cas has ever seen in his life.
“I can still help you both. This won‘t happen again.” He doesn’t even sound sure to his own ears. He’s horrified to realise he sounds a bit desperate.
Castiel didn’t apologise. And he won’t. Because he isn’t sorry at all. And deep down, he thinks Dean isn’t either. Because it was there. It’s always been there. And now he’s human enough, and selfish enough to reach out and take it.
Castiel couldn’t help but smile fondly at the indignant look on Dean’s face. The way he stood with his hands on hips, slightly flushed from his efforts. Cas still thought he was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. Even when pissed off and on the verge of a ‘hissy fit’ as they say.  He tried not to stare as Dean bent down to search the lower drawers, graceful and strong in his movements.
“You know,” He clears his throat awkwardly, not meeting Castiel’s eyes. This causes him to immediately fear a rejection. Unnecessarily though, as it turns out. “This afternoon… that was only the tip of the iceberg Cas.”
Dean pulled out the seat opposite, slid in thoughtfully. “You see, I’ve been thinking about that. We don’t know it got destroyed now do we?”
He hears a snort of amusement from Sam who towers over him like the concerned giant he is. Castiel does not understand what is so amusing, perhaps it is an inside joke. He allows himself a small groan as his head gives another throb of pain.
Castiel nods, letting the words flow over him. This is what he needs. This is what he deserves. He wants to be told. He wants to be punished.
“Humanity is a gift in itself, my father’s gift,” Metatron continues. “And through Castiel’s sacrifice I can now build a better heaven. Without the riffraff.” He tacks on hurriedly.
“Right. I mean it must be weird not being Mr Invincible anymore. I sure know it is for me.” Dean says and Cas takes a moment to realise he never considered how strange it must be for his friends to see him this way. He was just caught up in his own feelings. Dean interrupts his musings before he can respond. “I don’t think it needs stitches anyway - lucky for you, I’m terrible at ‘em.”
“Ew. I’m flattered, but I’m really not feeling it with you douchebag.” Dean snarks back, trying to make the angel feel uncomfortable, though his heart is hammering and his mind’s racing with what he needs to do next. “I just want information.”
Cas doesn’t have the energy to answer that. Or to worry that they’re still alive. The brothers must have banished them. Doesn’t care. He’s falling. Always falling, so cold, even in Dean’s arms. So tired.
“It’s true! You think I care about a couple of scars?” Dean sat upright then, actually sounding a little angry. “I’m here aren’t I? I chose you. The weird, dorky ex-angel with a stick up his ass - that’s you by the way.” Cas rolled his eyes at the sarcasm. “You. The former twinkly beam of starlight or whatever the hell you were, man. I had sex with a friggin’ dude!”
He closes his eyes. Feels like he may combust or do something very embarrassing if Cas doesn’t act soon. He gets lost in the sensation. Cas kisses down his chest, quickly, not teasing. He caresses his body with rough fingers against sensitive skin, making him moan.
Deep down, there’s a part of him that thinks Castiel wouldn‘t be here with him if he still had his wings.
It’s too much pressure, too much pleasure for Castiel. His neck goes taut as he practically sobs in response to Dean’s relentless pace. He’s too hard, too sensitive. He wraps a hands around himself, begins to pull desperately, moving in time to Dean’s thrusts on instinct.
“But…this isn’t you. I can’t – ” Cas’ hands are clenching-unclenching by his sides, and he shuffles uncomfortably. Dean could laugh, it’s so adorably familiar.
“We only just got to him in time. What about the next time, Sammy?” Dean sounded so scared, so broken. Its was a side that Sam was unused to seeing.
Castiel could roll his eyes over the little labels humans are desperate to place on everything and everyone. So determined to simplify the chaos of life. Until he notices the way Dean’s pupils dilate. Then he realises it must be a possession thing and just goes with it. “Yes Dean. In a manner. You will be the first to have me in the biblical sense.”
A calloused hand timidly brushes his brow and Dean nearly knocks the table over, backing away from Cas.
He lowers his mouth to Cas’ stomach, kisses carefully, reining himself in. He leaves a trail of kisses leading up to the hot skin of Cas’ sternum, tastes his heart beat with his tongue. He’s still amazed he has one. Cas squirms, gasps. Grips at Dean’s hair. This conjures a powerful image in Dean’s mind of reversed positions, as he takes a hardened peak of a nipple into his mouth before sucking hard, less gentle and polite than he would usually be.
“You like this?” There’s something almost triumphant in Dean’s voice that tells him he doesn’t need to answer. Especially when his body answers for him, practically jolting when Dean’s thumb rubs just right along his slit. The Winchester’s other hand rubs circles against his hip, kneading the smooth surface whilst expertly pinning him down.
“Please Cas. Just help. Please.” Now he’s pleading, begging, and that would be humiliating if he wasn’t’ past the point of caring.
Dean remembered the smile on the scribe’s face once the original deal had been struck. He hadn’t liked it one bit. It was a smile that said: ‘I’ve got you now’.
“I’m not! Just drop it okay? Me and Cas? Off-limits. It’s new. It’s private. I don’t even know what it is, so stop pushing.” He emphasises those last words, pushing up to his feet before pacing the hall.
Humans were not made to withstand this pain. This is not their world, his world, anymore. Yet Sam and Dean survive  it every day. Each time, they survive, so much stronger. He holds onto that thought.
“This is so weird,” Dean murmurs against his lips, arm supporting him on the pillow, before kissing Castiel hotly. “You have to say. You gotta say if I’m doing this wrong.”
“Dirty talk, really?” But Dean sounds delighted, he pushes into Castiel’s hand so Cas makes his movements more sure. Dean cries out before recovering slightly. “But you’re not ready yet. Don‘t want it to hurt.” He repeats breathing heavily, kissing him once more, sucking the sweat off Castiel’s lower lip.
He was smiling a little as he left the store. Perhaps because he was so absorbed in his musings, he didn’t notice he was being watched. He didn’t suspect danger.
Then Cas is kissing him again, he can’t not. His former angelic touch cures all ills. No disease for Dean. Dean is pure. Dean is
“Come on, I’m not exactly saying that. You should know that he’s pretty new to this human thing. He reacts differently to stuff…”
Cas comes closer, eyes filled with pity. He places a cautious hand on Dean’s arm. “We’ll find a way to remove it. Nothing’s worth losing the real you, letting it change who you are. Not even killing a Knight of Hell.” There’s defiance and that steely determination Dean has come to love in that sweet face of his. Dean pushes down the insane lust his touch incites, focuses on what needs to be said.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Castiel chides primly, suppressing a smile. “You came into my bedroom remember and accosted me?”
Cas’ eyes are blue. Ridiculously blue, deep, sweet, honest, hopeful and ancient. Dean feels like he’s barely scratched the surface of the (not) man before him, who is still holding his hands by the way. Cas is kind of goofy, he realises. He’s starting to feel hopeful. Stupidly hopeful…
Then there was a slamming sound, flesh on stone, followed by a bright flash a light, almost blinding. The angels screamed. It went on and on. Their screams were still echoing after, when they were replaced by a stunned sort of silence. Broken by Dean, really Dean, he thinks - he hopes.
Dean cracks his knuckles, pulls in a deep sigh and attentively reaches over to Castiel. For a strong, occasionally fierce man, Dean’s touch is surprisingly gentle. He pries the soaking towel from Castiel’s grip, only to press it back down again with a grimace. “Can you hold it a little longer?”
Like now, for example. Dean is kissing a line down his neck, agonisingly slow, wet kisses, trailing down to the hot firmness of his sternum. Castiel gasps and squirms a little under the assault against his damp skin. The only sounds are the noises Dean’s mouth makes against his body, and his own ragged breathing.
“What was that?” He’s still holding Dean’s head away from his own. They would look ridiculous if Sam walked in, but Dean doesn’t blame Cas. He’s the only thing stopping him from launching again. His hands are free to wander though. He slides his hands under Cas’ shirt, pressing his fingertips into the warmth of his skin, the softness of his stomach. Castiel gasps, tries to shuffle away but Dean has already seen the way his eyes fluttered. He wants this too.
“And since this is gonna be my first time, I want it done right.” Dean continued, words melting together, enticing all kinds of imagery. Cas’ body temperature rocketed. “I want you, healthy, ready, not rushing or doing it just to please me.” He could feel Dean’s hardness pressing against the curve of his ass, rocking a little into him, as though he couldn’t help himself. “It’s going to be so good. You know, just in case you needed a little motivation.”
The aftershocks of the blade don’t fade. He feels shaky, drained as though suffering from withdrawals. He craves the weapon. He craves much more…
He once left a mark of his own on Dean’s skin. His own brand. He wants to see if it’s still there – to trace it with hands and lips. To make new ones the only way he can now. He realises that he could have remade Dean without the handprint marring his flesh. But he didn’t. He never cared to closely examine why that had been at the time. It had been a reminder of who Dean should be grateful to for rescuing from the pit. A warning to others that he was marked, protected. A burn from a desperate moment, when he had saved Dean Winchester and in that moment, he had been his, Castiel’s entirely.
“What?” He wriggles tortuously on top of Cas, working up a subtle rhythm now, that makes them both gasp when they rub against the right places. “Oh, supplies? I’ve got…” his face flushes beautifully as Cas slips his hand back inside his jeans. The angle’s too awkward, but he manages to find that hardness, rub against that hot, yielding flesh. He places a couple of damp kisses beneath his ear, resists the temptation to bite (that’s apparently Dean’s forte).
He cannot recognise the man in front of him. Now he is human, he can no longer see the true forms of his siblings. It hurts to realise that. He tilts his head, focuses harder, ignores the stab of pain that triggers, no answers are forthcoming.
“I could hear you from the study,” Castiel states, something accusatory in his tone. Dean has been avoiding him as much as possible. But how can he when Cas seeks him out like this? It isn’t fair. He could weep with the frustration. He’s trying to be good, he really is. A dark greed pushes at the edges of his awareness, but that’s only the surface. It disguises a much deeper need, a craving for reassurance, a desperation to have someone hold him, to feel something real and find a release that won’t end in pain.
“You and everyone else.” He chokes out between coughs, trying to salvage his tattered reputation as the cool Winchester.
“Should be.” He pauses before running a hand through his tresses. “I don’t know what he wants me to say.” He admits with a sigh.
That sounds dangerously close to ‘feelings’ talk so Dean has to try a new tactic then, mouths at the vulnerable skin of his neck in mute desperation. He needs to get closer, even though their bodies are so tightly pressed together. Cas’ legs open wider to accommodate Dean. He scrapes teeth along a tendon until Cas is gasping, writhing, hands clenching at the damp fabric of his back, twisting the material. He kisses his pulse point, where the blood beats hot and fast. Cas has never felt so human and something primal within Dean responds to that as the angel tilts his head back in acquiescence.
“Thanks Cas. Thanks for being so ridiculously cool.” He grins, leaning over to briefly place his hand on top of Castiel’s. He smiles brightly back at him.
He feels the slight sting of teeth against his lobe, and nearly whimpers at how good it feels, soothed with more kisses. His head falls back against the door with a dull thump. His fingers clench and unclench against Dean’s skin and he forces them to relax. He wants more. Wants to let Dean in. He shudders as Dean slowly lays his lips against his neck once more.
He realises this sadly, as he runs his hands over the smooth planes of Castiel’s chest experimentally, thoughtfully. Cas’ breath quickens, skin pebbling, eyes fixed on Dean through lowered lashes.
“I’m supposed to be helping you.” Cas reminds him, his voice is like gravel and it only makes things worse.
Cas had felt sorry for him. Had even sympathised with his lonely existence. But he had no right, no right at all, to take those people with him. Especially one of the few people Castiel loves in this world. The person he loves most of all in this world, he’d realised. And with that, the answer came automatically in his mind. Obvious and certain.
Dean shakes his head, not going there. “Doesn’t matter. But trust me, you got nothing to worry about here. We’re still us. Cas and Dean. Same as we’ve ever been but with awesome sex.”
Castiel is taken aback by the heat even through his boxers, the way Dean tilts his head back and moans when his hand shifts, like he can ever forget the image. He has to reach out and lick a line up his throat then, can’t not.
“Ah.” Castiel has to lean closer because Dean has gone so quiet. “Well Cas, I hope you know I never… I mean, my area isn’t… It’s not really of the no-breasted variety.”
Sorry for the wait. I had no intention of continuing this. But Cas and Dean wouldn't leave me alone.
He’d screamed into the night until his lungs and throw burned, until he’d nearly given up. Then the sound of wings had came. So he made a deal with the devil, figuratively of course, though he trusted Metatron no more.
like Daphne? You’re not in a good place right now. You’re newly human, all guilty and possibly hormonal-”
“Oh I am so terribly sorry,” Dean said, voice posh and teasing, he grinned mischievously, circled the length obligingly, then began to slide his fingers up and down more firmly. ”So I take it you like my idea then?”
He watches over Dean, sat beside him on the bed as he channel-hops on a beat up, old television set. Dean lies on his stomach, head pillowed against an arm, both warm and naked. Sunlight filters through garish yellow curtains, casting a golden glow over Dean’s skin. It’s enticing.
To abandon his ailing brother was out of character enough, but the look of fierce determination had scared Castiel deeply. It was the look someone gets before doing something exceedingly reckless, a desperate last resort.
Cas fell first. It was sudden and sharp in its intensity. It goes on for rather along time, coating them both. It had been a while. Castiel was relieved to know that he could feel that way again. He nearly sobs in pleasure and relief.
– Dean wants to respond. Instead he makes the mistake of meeting those eyes, really seeing that face. The affection and concern in those deep eyes. The stubble and thick bed-head. The buttons left undone beneath that coat. He’s smaller than Dean, but more powerful. Or is he?
“I’ll get there eventually. It’s just…It’s hard to let myself lose control anymore.” He admitted stiffly.
“What is this?” He sees Cas' eyes flicker down to where Dean is hard, before obviously snapping away again, jaw set and cheeks reddening. He likes it.
Then, after making Castiel swear to watch over his little brother, he had left without another word of explanation.
Dean pulls back a little, smile back in place. “Okay, so maybe I knew you were never going to the Karate Kid to my Mr Miyagi.”
Has he tried it before, with another man? Castiel freezes up. No. Of course not. Dean said he’s never done this before. He wouldn’t lie about that. Castiel will be his first. His only. A flare of possession simmers through his veins at that. But that means… Dean must have tried it on himself then? How else could he know?  Perhaps he made his hand slick? Then wrapped it around himself. Gripped his own cock, shifted into that tight, wet heat. Yes. Starting slow, then gradually becoming quicker, more frantic. Hips bucking, pistoning, head thrown back so his neck goes taut, sweat beading as his hand moves faster and faster. The sounds he’d make, that he’d try to stifle by biting that full, lower lip…
He is careful, pulls Dean close to his neck, just holds him, strokes his hair soothingly as Dean breathes shakily against him. He’s held him like this before, after making love, but this is different. They are a little more broken, more desperate than they’ve ever been. He wonders how they will move past this, if they can. He thinks he feels wetness against his neck, though knows better than to mention it.
They stay locked like that for a moment, Dean drinking in the pleasure Castiel was willingly giving him. Until his eyes shot open with realisation.
Dean complies, cautiously. It hurts. He grits his jaw, digs his fingers into that wonderful ass. He focuses on Dean’s face, the look of wonderment, of undeniable pleasure. He feels it through the way Dean is shuddering against him, holding back, all that reigned in strength and power. It’s beautiful, so he clenches again to pull him back in, slowly uses his arms to push up to meet him halfway.
Treacherously, he feels the bliss of Dean’s hand slide away. His eyes snap open and he’s about to ask what the hell Dean thinks he’s doing when he cups his balls lightly, squeezes gently. His lower stomach muscles spasm, tense up.
Cas smiles down at the goose bumps his touch raises, tracing the pink lines his nails had made earlier. “Do we need pornography?” He asks pointedly.
“Then what? As much as I like having you owe me a favour, your store credit’s run out. What else could you possibly offer me, hmm?”
Dean was right. When he pushes in, it hurts. It knocks the breath from him. It’s fiery, a good ache, stretched full, so full. But it’s fine. It’s okay. He gasps, bites his lip, grips Dean tighter, snatches him closer. He pushes in slowly, gradually, a tight fit that has Castiel trembling.
Dean leans in closer, practically trapping him against the door. “If you wanted that, you should have just slipped out quietly. I think you want someone to stop you.”
There is suddenly miles of skin to explore - toned, golden, firm yet yielding. Castiel runs his hands over his chest, savouring the heat, the way Dean tenses, bucks up a little beneath him. He presses indents into skin, makes Dean laugh when he traces the muscles of his abdomen, nails lightly grazing. He finds the anti-possession tattoo, traces its stark lines before placing a messy kiss over it. Dean’s breath hitches as he scrapes his teeth over the mark, presses his cheek against the heat so he can feel his racing heart.
He places his hands on Dean’s shoulders so that he may push him back a little. Just so he can look up at those eyes. Dean sees him through a screen of lashes and is so breathtakingly beautiful, Castiel nearly forgets his words.
Dean waited for him to answer. He must have been disappointed. “I can wait. I can wait forever. It doesn’t matter to me.” He babbled, unnerved by Cas’ silence.
In the peace of that hospital, surrounded by family, Cas smiles slightly, closes his eyes, and sleeps.
love coffee. He’s lost for words at that declaration. At the way Dean smiles so fondly at him, eyes crinkling.
Castiel had been sat on the sofa in the makeshift living room of the bunker. He was considering which movie to watch on their improvised date night (though Sam may have shown up at any moment given that he had not been informed of said unofficial date night). Then Dean had appeared in the doorway. Leaning casually, but watching Cas as he scrolled through Sam’s movie downloads stored tidily on his laptop.
At times like those, he likes to slip outside and watch the world go by, watches the bees once more.
He closes his eyes and groans heavily when Dean’s fingers find that spot inside him once more. It’s like a current running though him. Their hips move together, a glorious rhythm. He slings an arm over Dean’s shoulders to pull him closer, buries his face in his neck and slurs: “Want you to take me. Want to feel you within me, every inch, every sensation. Love bringing you pleasure. Want to watch you fall apart, and when that happens, I want it to be because you are buried inside me.”
“But…” Castiel feels his face fall. But. Here it comes. The excuses. He doesn’t want him after all – why would he? This isn’t going to happen.
“I know, I’m sorry” Sam winced, placing his hand on Dean’s shoulder. The words are so inadequate. He’s no stranger to such horrors; torture, nightmares, seeing someone you love suffer. “But you can’t trust Metatron.” He states firmly. “Last time Cas did, he kinda broke the world, and stole Cas’ grace.”
“Yeah, yeah, sinister threat, IOU, blablabla. I get it. You’re all smart and sneaky. Can we skip that bit please?” Dean growled out, trying to remain calm.
Cas begins to look confused. He opens his mouth, then closes it again, licking those full, shapely lips nervously. So close. Dean catches the movement and his fevered mind snaps.
Dean’s voice rumbled below him, familiar, comforting. He could feel Dean’s erection against his inner thigh, shifted a little so as not to excite or frustrate further. He’d felt so
After a few minutes of doing a remarkably good impression of a goldfish, Dean managed to splutter: “No! Course not. No I am not jealous of you and your fake wife. Whatever you two did together while you lived your fake life is clearly none of my business.”
Castiel stiffened, heart rate picking up in an odd combination of pleasant/unpleasant. A weight on top. Trapped. Looking down at him, his scars, his aches and pains. But it was Dean. His Dean. He
“Don’t matter. You can buy me a new one.” Dean is beaming down at him, though the smile is strained. His hand is pressing down on the worst of the knife wounds, to stop the bleeding. It hurts but he feels strangely at peace. Dean cards his fingers softly though Cas’ hair, the only part of him that’s safe to touch.
They end up nowhere special, but Dean had accomplished his goal. He’d successfully managed to assign himself to the unspoken role of Protector of Human-Cas once more. Through flirting. Castiel is very much aware of this and it puts him in a bad mood. That and the fact they end up in a rubbish diner when what he was pining for was fresh air and freedom.
“You don’t know that!” He shouts, pulling the blade out, waving it in the scribe’s general direction.
Instead of his words relaxing Dean, he seems to become more intense, shoulders squared. “What else is wrong?”
“Yes, yes of course.” Castiel growls out, sliding his hands under layers so he can trail them over the smooth warmth of his back.
“-And sad. Like, missing your family sad. And maybe even lonely... I don’t know, I’m saying this all wrong. I guess. I just don’t want to take advantage like that.”
On the fourth morning, the nightmare was over. Dean had returned, all confidence, swagger and arrogant smiles. And Sam had woken, restored to full health - just like that - and welcomed his brother with a well-placed fist to the face.
Dean must have felt his back stiffen, his breath shorten with unease. “We don't have to of course. Or I could only do what you tell me to do.
Cas merely shrugged. He was just happy to have both brothers alive, well and in one piece. Whatever hideous nightmare may follow, they would have to deal with. If this was the calm before the storm, he’d rather hide in the illusion. He just had to trust Dean, to accept that he knows what he’s doing. He’s always found it hard to trust others. Dean is no exception. And when it comes to Sam, he knows Dean never been the most rational thinker. And that’s the way it should be. Sam will always come first with him.
“Cas, I’m warning you, leave.” His voice shakes, his body too. He clutches his bedside table, practically gouging marks in the wood with his fingernails. It roots him to the spot. Stops him from launching at his best friend. He feels sick with lust, seeing red. He closes his eyes and takes cool air in. Doesn’t help.
He bites his lip at the sting of the bacterial wipe, noticing how Dean catches the movement. The hunter licks his bottom lip, almost a nervous gesture, and Castiel cannot look away. “Looks like you’re going to keep that smooth complexion for a while yet.” Dean declares quietly.
The idea of pushing into Dean, that tight, slick heat. Being surrounded by him in every sense of the word… It made his whole body tremble, break out in a filthy sweat. He never realised how badly he wanted it before now.
“You’re not ready…” Dean insists, though he doesn’t sound certain. He’s clearly torn between his desire to be inside of Castiel, and the need to make this as pain-free as possible. Castiel knows this, he just wants to make him happy.
The blade is removed from his neck, only so the woman can rush around to hit him across the face with it. His head snaps to the left violently as pain explodes in his head once more. Blood flies as his teeth sink into his lip. It is stark, sickeningly painful, a wake up call. He cries out before he can help himself. The act is savage, pain as staggering as it is unexpected. She was so fast, he is honestly confused as to what had happened, didn’t see her move.
This is turning into a slow burn evolution of a (sexual) relationship. I hope you enjoy and would like to hear your thoughts.
There is such fury in that unexpected interruption, Castiel is unsure whether he’s imagining it. It had sounded like Dean. His Dean. He’s been fantasising about an intervention from the brothers so many times. But the angels stop advancing on him. Their attentions focus sharply on something over his shoulder, expressions a matching mix of surprise and hatred.
“Cas, Castiel, this is – I can’t…tight, it’s just…” Castiel takes his face in his hands and kisses him deeply, messily.
“I wasn’t completely serious anyway. I have no right to take such liberties when you’ve been so good to me.” It came out too stiffly.
Sam glared. “Don’t you dare. Last time, I had a bruise shaped like a bowling ball. You say away from first aid!” He ordered, then cursed inwardly. Humour was Dean’s way of deflecting. It wasn’t going to work this time. “What did you say?”
Castiel made soothing sounds and pressed a cool cloth over his head. That’s what they always did in the movies he’d seen.
They sit facing each other, across the grand, oak meeting table. Sam keeps putting his head in his hands, rubbing his eyes as if to wipe out a certain memory. Dean sits as still as he can, fingers tapping anxiously across the polished surface, betraying his cool exterior.
His mouth went completely dry at that. Or more likely in response to what was not being said, but rather implied. Dean squeezes his arm, eyes locked on his own. He’s so close that Castiel could count every freckle across his face if he wished.
“I have decided to take a walk outside. Alone.” Castiel had announced one day, emphasising the ‘alone’ part. He’s feeling stifled by the constant presence of a babysitter. Army of angels or not, he wants his own space. Sam came back the next morning, still sulking. Between the two of them, there is a very gloomy atmosphere. He cannot stand this tin bunker any longer. He wants to feel the wind on his skin again. The silence in his head must be filled with the clatter of the outside world, a hazy replacement for ‘angel radio’ as the Winchesters call it. This life is not enough. He’ll go mad…
Dean replies by shimmying out of his underwear. He is intoxicated by the sight beneath, the length and thickness of him. The way his cock is straining, bead of pearly moisture at the tip. He reaches down, slowly, a question in his eyes that Dean doesn’t say no to.
“I don’t understand why you’d want me.” It comes out quietly, a low admittance of vulnerability that has Dean looking up, wondering if he’d really heard it. Did Cas read his thoughts? Cas looks so conflicted. Lost. Dean is gone. Gone, gone, gone…
Dean does not say anything. Doesn’t prompt him in any way. But Castiel can feel his eyes on him. Knows he has his attention. Knows the soft skin around his eyes will be crinkling as they focus, possibly filled with trepidation but trying not to show it. It’s more than he could have hoped for. More than he’s allowed have.
Castiel has to hold back a whimper to ask: “Have you had sex since I last healed you?” He hates to bring it up. Hates talking about Dean and other lovers. Possessive. But what he hates more is remembering the reason why he had to heal Dean in the first place. Because of the damage his own fists had caused at Naomi’s orders.
He was physically damaged now, torso a litany of crisscrossing knife wounds. They were nearly healed up, but some scars remained raised, angry, pale slashes against tanned skin. He couldn’t stand to see that anger reflected back in Dean’s expression.
More kisses that blur the lines between lazy and hungry, soft and insistent. Dean’s tongue plunders his mouth while his hands pop open Castiel’s jeans with a casualness that takes him by surprise. He was too distracted by Dean’s kisses, by the wonderful rhythm of their bodies rocking together.
And the thing was, Dean hadn’t pushed him away. Not at first. Castiel’s arms still hurt from the firm grip he’d had on them. His lips tingle and are swollen from the way Dean’s mouth moved hungrily against his. His jaw hurts from how hard Dean had pressed back. He remembers the breathless way Dean had gasped against him. The rough way he’d pulled Cas in closer.
“Well, if you’d stop being a little bitch and listen actually listen to me you would know: I. Did. Not. Do. It!”
Castiel isn’t sure why he needs a second but holds still, clenches around where they are connected to intimately, experimenting. This causes Dean to groan almost comically loud.
Then there’s Dean’s enveloping musky, masculine scent and the warmth is back, running up his chest before pulling him into his arms. Castiel wraps himself around Dean, breathing slowly, evenly. He tries to stay awake. Wants to watch Dean some more. He rubs his face against his chest, nestles closer.
Castiel digs his hands into Dean’s hair, settles for another kiss. Dean’s eyelashes are soft against his face. It doesn’t take long for him to respond, mouth open, hot, wet and so ridiculously prefect he could laugh. He’s pushing Dean back onto the bed this time, taking charge. Crawling on top, he nudges his legs apart so he can settle between them. He gives him one long kiss before wordlessly pulling back with a wet smack. He leans back so he can savour the sight of a heavy-lidded Dean Winchester - mouth open and face flushed - looking up at him.
It came out too fast, almost rehearsed, clumsy in a typical Dean-fashion. Castiel gave him a very sarcastic look. “Okay. I
“Really? Some gift.” Dean’s lip curls as he turns around to face the angel. “Which ‘gift’ would that be? The gift of ageing? Of tricking him into betraying his family? Of cutting his throat?” It’s a struggle not to shout. A haze of red washes over Dean’s vision and his pulse pounds in his head. Metatron should tread so so carefully.
“A cupid’s bow, the heart of a Nephilim…my grace.” That received very pointed looks. “I didn’t know what the spell would do,” he concludes, voice quiet but steely underneath. “I swear. He tricked me.”
He swore violently in Enochain, slammed his fists into the headboard before collapsing on top of Dean.
“Nothing’s ever simple,” He agreed, since Dean seemed to want some kind of vocal acknowledgment by the way he was glaring.
When Dean bucks into that warm, wet cave, he effortlessly holds Dean’s hips down with the other hand, tempered angel-strength being put to good use. Dean would not be able to control himself in this state. He treats Dean’s movements as an annoying distraction from the task at hand, rather than viewing it as appalling bad manners, as anyone else would. Dean laughs hysterically at that, deep affection for the angel running through him beneath the insane fog of lust. It’s like he’s determined to learn, to please, to help Dean. He could cry from how good it feels as he takes him deeper, sucks gently. Then harder, bobbing up and down steadily at a slick, blinding pace.
He bums money off of the Winchesters - can no longer just take what he needs. He has to deal with the constant onslaught of emotions, most of which he has no name for. Everything is bright and confusing- a bombardment of sensory information. Even if his senses are stunted, his perception limited now he‘s human. It’s still baffling. People are baffling. He can no longer see true faces, but has to work hard to glean meanings. It makes him confused, uneasy, whereas before he could push it all down and try not to care.
