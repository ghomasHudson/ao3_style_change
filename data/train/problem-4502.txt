“I… I wanted to, Cas, so much… but my dad… he wouldn’t have understood, and I was so busy with the business and taking care of Sammy…” he paused, choking on emotion as the tears forming in his eyes began to fall, rolling silently down his cheeks. “And then… then Dad died, and by then I had lost track of you. I called Sonny and he said you aged out and split, and he had no idea where you had gone.”
When they break for air, Cas pulls back, a bit of a sheepish look on his face.
It’s everything Castiel has ever wanted and knew he would never have, and he desperately wants to relish the sudden reality of his desires coming to life before him, but the relevance of the witch’s last words rings in his ears. Castiel takes a deep breath and pulls back to catch Dean’s eyes. “Dean, tell me… what’s the last thing you remember?”
Dean eyed the cake suspiciously, then looked up to meet Castiel’s eyes once more as he consumed it.
He stood to leave Dean to his rest, but was called back by Dean’s small, sleepy voice.
Dean, laughing, cuts him off with a quick press of lips to his own. “I’m fine, Cas. I only had a couple glasses, you practically had the whole bottle and then some.” Dean’s eyes, verdant in the late afternoon sun, crinkle in the corners with merriment, and Castiel is utterly entranced by them; until he’s distracted instead by his full, plush, extremely kissable lips, now twisting up in barely contained amusement. “And, it’s ‘Uber’, babe.” No longer able to hold it in, he laughs again. “Although there might be a market for ‘Luber’ — getting your freak on in the back seat while someone drives you home!”
Castiel nods somberly. “Yes. I heard a shout but by the time I found you, you were already unconscious. I was able to pin the witch briefly but they escaped.” He sighs and looks down, unable to meet Dean’s eyes in light of his failure. “Unfortunately, I do not know what spell or curse was laid upon you. I attempted to heal you, but somehow I am being blocked from doing so.”
“Fine.” Castiel glances back up as Dean pivots on a heel and heads for the door. “Do what you gotta do. I need coffee.” He storms out of the room, his footsteps echoing down the hall as he heads for the kitchen.
“Dude, the suit and tie again?” Dean asks, prompting another puzzled squint from Cas. “I mean, c’mon. We’re still another ten or so hours from Vegas — wouldn’t you rather be comfortable?”
“Like hell I do.” Dean makes another grab at the note and manages to snatch it away. He reads it and breathes a sigh of relief, throwing a glare at Cas. The sonofabitch is still chuckling at his little joke.
Instead, he was shocked when Dean reached over to take his hand, green eyes wide and searching his, nervously biting his bottom lip. Finally, he spoke.
========================================
“D-Dean? Dean Winchester?” she says, stammering in surprise.
Dean doesn’t care. He has Roman now. He knows his tell. Quickly, he tamps down on the feeling of victory bubbling in his chest.
“Of course… however, since we are trying to maintain appearances due to my very strict religious upbringing, it will be a two-bedroom, two-bath suite.”
He spreads the sweet smelling oil over his hand, and reaches in between their bodies to grab both of their cocks, coating them in the oil, and begins to stroke.
Castiel reaches out to brush light fingertips over Dean’s cheek, and Dean leans into it, skin tingling from the contact. “You… “fixed me up” very well, Dean.” His wings flare slightly, blue-white light briefly flickering across them. “My power is contained in my wings, and while one was broken I was unable to effectively use it - you in fact witnessed my one attempt to do so.”
“Dean!”
Instead, he keeps an eye on the road but takes a hand off the wheel, reaching across to brush fingertips through Cas' hair. Cas leans into the touch and Dean feels his heart leap in his chest. Dean's fingers move down to the nape of Cas' neck, to his shoulder and down his arm to the hand laying relaxed on the seat between them, and laces their fingers together, giving a gentle squeeze.
Castiel fumes at this seemingly arbitrary rule, but prepares for the blow, tensing and closing his eyes.
Dean blinks. “About you?” Okay, fine. He’ll bite. “Well, for one,” Dean pulls up to a red light and turns towards Castiel, flagrantly giving him the once-over. “You’re hotter than hell. It’s a problem.” He grins at the flush blooming on Castiel’s cheeks just below the sunglasses. The light turns green and he directs his attention back to the road. “That, and your decidedly
Dean grins and raises his own, tapping it against Sam’s but holding it there as he turns to Cas.
Lady Bevell is going to have his ass for this. He can only hope the paperwork granting his license is done and filed before she catches wind of the commotion he’s caused.
“You have nothing to apologize for, Cas.”
“Angels don’t exist,” he murmurs to himself, then louder, looking into Cas’ eyes. “Angels don’t exist…” He gulps. “Cas, are you… are you an angel?”
Sam nodded. “Okay, let’s get started. Where’s Dean?”
“Chief… oh, and hi, Dean!” Kevin starts, his voice a little shrill with excitement. “Congrats on your… uh…” He pauses suddenly, realizing there are others nearby that might not be cleared to know of Dean’s new role in the organization. “Promotion?” he continues, eyebrows raised in uncertainty, then shakes his head and turns back to the laptop in front of him. “So, that file you sent from the hacked phone contains a list of locations around Europe.” He glances up from the laptop, throwing a thumbs-up at Dean. “Nice work on that hacking, bee tee dub.”
“Yeah, but you picked the last one we listened to.”
attractive male around her.” A pause, and that prickly feeling of being under an intense stare again. “As I’m sure you can attest to.”
harder to kill due to their leathery skin. Electrocution was the only thing that permanently works on them, and in this dream, Dean has nothing to fight them with.
Sam paused in the library long enough to shift the ingredients he was carrying to one arm and picking up the book with his free hand, then continued on to the kitchen, Castiel following. Setting the ingredients on the stainless steel island, he ambled over to the refrigerator, pulled out a package of mushrooms, and with a crooked smile, a small tray of fugu wrapped in cellophane.
Crap. Well, he should have expected Toni would bitch to Ellen about what went down in London. Maybe she didn’t tell Ellen about—
His contrition doesn’t last long, Dean notices, as Sam’s lips twitch up into a smirk. “I could always get you a straw…”
Dean reached for him then, slid a hand under Castiel’s chin and raised his head to meet Dean’s gaze.
Dean’s eyes blinked open and the first thing he noticed was the lack of a warm angel at his back, for the first time in weeks. He also noticed that he was once again dressed in a t-shirt and sweatpants… and thank whoever happened to be listening, he wasn’t… uh... sticky.
He began to feel like he was starting to doze off, then felt dampness on his shoulder, heard  Cas’ breathing still coming in quaking gasps. Alarmed, he pulled away and raised Cas’ head from his shoulder, looked into Cas’ tear-streaked face.
With a whispered spell, Dean steps back as the last dreamcatcher fades. He heads back up to the cabin and stands in the doorway, glancing over to the kitchen where Cas, having raided Rufus’ 'pantry' for the ingredients he’ll need to remove the curse, is currently measuring them into a brass bowl. “Are you sure getting rid of the dreamcatchers is a good idea? What if the spell doesn’t work?”
Cas looks at him, squinting in confusion. "Why would someone bury cars in the dirt?"
Yeah, Dean’s used to it; the contempt’s been thick around him ever since Ellen Harvelle-Singer, the new head of the American branch of the Men of Letters, sent him to the BMoL to be trained. His high marksmanship scores gained him a small amount of respect, but his brashness and devil-may-care attitude got him far less of it. However, Lady Antonia Bevell, the head of the British branch (and “Toni” to her friends, of which he was most decidedly
Dean snickers. The first thing drilled into his head by his instructor and mentor, Dr. Elenor Hess, was that eyes and ears
Dean pulls Cas’ hands off his shirt and shoves him back. “You fucking idiot.”
At any other time, Dean would start to press for more; to move his lips away from Cas’, down his neck to see what he tastes like, what sweet noises he could pull from Cas as he flicks a tongue over his nipples, how the weight of Cas’ cock would feel on his tongue… but while the urge is
The full lips brushing his cheek and whispering his name in his ear the first time after he had fully formed.
Some had their trunks open, the inside of the lids decorated with devil traps and wards. Others had green coolers nearby, identical to the one in his backseat.
Dean sets the carry-on down in the chair and does a quick surveillance of the room. All appears to be in order, but he still has his suspicions. Lord knows he’s pulled his fair share of tricks on Sammy over the years and always expects retaliation.
on a leash.” He kneels down in front of Dean. “There’s one more thing you need to do, Dean.” From inside his jacket, he pulls out the bone, painted with the blood of the Fallen, and places it in Dean’s hands.
And they’re sounds he NEVER, EVER wanted to hear his brother make.
At Dean’s puzzled look, Sam continued. “The spell’s called ‘Blue Faery’ - like in
Sam snorts. “That is one hundred percent
“Dean…?”
“I want the rest of our lives to start right here… right now.”
In the garage, in the back of the freakin' Impala when he needed to go on a supply run.
The morning dawns bright, and Dean is surprised to wake up wrapped in Cas and wings.
“I’m afraid we very much are,” the thunderous voice very much quieter but no less deeper came from behind him, startling Dean onto his feet, almost dropping the phone in the process. He spins to face the voice.
The subsequent nights when those lips had found his.
Lips, hot and wet, press against Dean’s and he falls into them; falls until he’s soaring, swept up like a kite in a storm, burning like a lightning-struck key. His fingers buried in Cas’ hair ground him like a kite string.
. It’s just not worth the effort.
It had been two days since Rufus left. Each night the nightmares had gotten worse, and he would wake up to the alarms jangling louder and louder as more of the dreamcatchers were filled.
It’s definitely much hotter in this room now and his jeans are definitely getting uncomfortably tight in a very interesting area.
Castiel felt his face grow hot at the label, but couldn’t deny it, nor his urgency to restore Dean to his full size and vigor. He quickly followed Sam to Dean’s room.
Cas, as he’d started calling him in between languorous kisses because “Castiel” is just too much of a mouthful, was still recovering from his transformation, and while neither wanted to stop, the last thing Dean needs is his guardian angel out of commission when the nightmares come.
Eileen gets herself back under control enough to rise but not enough to talk.
“One more clue, Sammy — we’re waiting for an appointment… with the county clerk.”
“What? We made up.”
Part of the routine was reviewing his dreams over his first cup of coffee so he would know what weapons to arm himself with before heading out to clear the nets. Last night’s feature had starred changelings - and even worse,
Dean washed down the fries with the last of the beer, the belch following echoing in the library.
“Dean, we get it — we all want Roman to pay for what he’s done to not only our family, but the world in general,” Sam says, reaching a hand across the desk to grasp Dean’s arm. “But there’s more to this than just taking out Roman.  You have to actually
.” He casts a meaningful glance at Dean. “And Dick Roman himself will be playing.”
... and ...
“I love you guys, so much,” he says, squeezing them all together into a very tight group hug that leaves Dean gasping for air once again.
“Cas, I’ve got twenty minutes to get back to that room.”
? His track record with relationships so far doesn’t give him much in the way of confidence. And even worse, just blurting out the question like that…
Working together, they quickly gathered the ingredients listed in the spell, suffering a brief moment of panic when they couldn’t find the brass bowl to mix them in. With several bottles of powders and liquids set into the bowl, Sam led the way to the infirmary and set everything on the table for mixing. When the proper portions had been measured into the bowl, Sam reached across the table and bowl to firmly grasp Cas by the shoulder.
Dean leans against the doorway of the bedroom and stares in awe at the man lying in the bed. Or whatever he was, Dean still isn’t quite sure and… Castiel, he said his name was Castiel… had not regained consciousness for him to get clarification on that point.
Dean gives a wan laugh and picks up his and Cas’ refilled wine glasses. Jody grabs hers and Donna’s, and they head back to the table.
Dean feels Cas' hand go slack in his grip and turns to see that Cas' eyes have drifted closed, a sweet smile on his lips. Dean wonders what Cas is dreaming about to put that oh so tempting smile on his face, resists the urge to release Cas' hand to touch that smile, presses down the desire to taste it with his lips.
Charlie stares at the flop. She huffs an annoyed breath. Knocks the table. No bet.
Dean gulps, once again wonders if he’d gone too far, and braces for impact.
Dean nods, sipping his damned fine whiskey (Single malt Macallan Rare — yeah, near-death experience or no, no one was keeping him from having a glass of whiskey after
Not your usual honeymoon destination.
“Where… what…”
He lets the word sink in, warming him to his core.
As the clock inexorably ticked closer to midnight, the bar became busier and noisier, more faces filling the mirror in front of him. This suited Castiel just fine, an excellent distraction from his thoughts.
He sighed and nodded to himself. “I deserve that.” His eyes turned back to Castiel’s, intense and pleading.
Tracy nodded with a shrug. “Yeah, gotta get back at it. Sam told me the witch that fucked us all over is gone, so that’s good - but you know how it is. Always another monster to put down.”
“Anyway, spill. How did you guys get angel blood when angels don’t exist?” His eyes focus on Cas’, suspicious, waiting to see if that blank stare returns.
Seconds later, he yelps in surprise as a pinprick of liquid heat pools in the center of his chest and dribbles in a line down to his stomach, the honey hot but not burning, the warmth expanding as it spreads out against his skin. The weight on his thighs shifts again as Castiel leans forward; then the warm, wet pressure of Castiel’s tongue, pressed flat against Dean’s stomach, slowly slides up his body. As his tongue follows the trail of honey, Castiel’s body shifts against his and Dean breathes out a shaky moan when the hard line of Castiel’s cock slots next to his, just as his tongue laps up the last of the honey from his chest. Castiel doesn’t stop there, his tongue continuing up Dean’s neck and into his mouth, the sweet taste of the honey bursting on his taste buds as he sucks it from Castiel’s tongue, swallowing his groan as Dean ruts up against him.
“Great,” Dean says, shoving away from the chair and stalking toward the door. “He’s in New York, be back in a couple days.”
Castiel considered Sam’s request and had an idea.
“Oh! Right… Rowena’s code…” Sam manically shoved books and papers aside, finding what he was looking for and brandishing it in triumph before passing it to Castiel - a page written in a poor example of Sam’s usual meticulous script, and scrawled across the top - “Blue Faery”. A list of ingredients followed, and a paragraph of ancient Latin formulating the actual spell.
But the idea of trying to get anything done with their silent eyes staring in judgment would have been counter-productive at best.
An overwhelming feeling of hunger distracts him, followed by a rumble in his stomach.
The writing on this tape, while still recognizable as Dean’s, was much neater than the surrounding tapes.  The care taken warms Castiel’s heart as much as it did when Dean had given it to him. Of course, along with the warmth comes the painful memory of when he tried to give it back in order to steal the Colt. Dean had handed it back (
He opens his eyes and stands up, then kneels in front of his duffle to pull out his toiletries, sweats, and a t-shirt.
“Dean? Are you alright?”
“Just you, babe. Just you.”
“Victory is mine,” he says as Dean turns the key in the lock and opens the door to their room, “and to the victor go the spoils.”  He enters after Dean, closing the door behind them, then grabs Dean’s arm, pulling him back around and pushing him against the door, pressing him against it with his body.
As an angel in incorporeal form, he could sense the vibrations of the earth ebbing and flowing with the changing of the seasons, but they held no real significance for him then — only observing them as they affected the humans in his charge. That first Spring after taking Jimmy Novak as his vessel was the first time he had actually
Dean takes the plate and forces a grin. “No problem. Thanks, kid.” Kevin backs away then dashes back up the hall, and Dean can’t help but chuckle as he kicks the door shut.
After Sam had mixed the wet ingredients thoroughly, he poured it into Castiel’s bowl of dry ingredients, and while Sam turned to fire up the oven, Castiel stirred the contents until they were thoroughly combined and poured the batter into the waiting cupcake molds as the oven heated, and placed the tin inside to bake when the oven was ready.
Sam guffawed. “You know, I never thought about that!” He looked down at Dean, trying not to laugh at his brother’s tiny chipmunk cheeks as he stuffed the “fries” in his mouth hungrily. “So, where are you going to sleep?”
And yeah, his hand-to-eye coordination may not be all that great right now, either.
Castiel’s heart broke again at the sight of Dean’s tear-streaked face reflected there. He turned back to Dean and spun him around to face him. Reaching for a bar napkin, he wiped the tears from Dean’s freckled cheeks.
Turning to face the mirror, he focuses on the candle flame’s reflection in the mirror, and thinks of Dean.
“But not
“So from the pictures you sent, he looks a lot like an Asian Black Eagle or a Verreaux’s Eagle, but bigger than a Stellan’s Sea Eagle.” Sam’s voice coming through the speakerphone pauses. “None of which are native to the area, or even close.”
He swallowed harshly, shoving the feeling back down. “How long was I out?”
Dream of every horror he’s ever faced.
“I’ll explain it to you later, Cas,” Dean says, then sobering, turns his attention back to Sam. “So you’re saying this… curse… is
“I love you, Dean. I will wait for eternity for you to be ready, if that’s what it takes.”
“Hey guys, you look great! And wow, your Baby is GORGEOUS! What’s her name?” She claps a hand over her mouth in dismay. “Oh, of course, I shouldn’t assume gender. What’s your Baby’s name?”
“What do you mean, I was a hunk of plastic?” he sputtered to Sam. “I thought the witch just shrank me?” He looked first at Sam, then turned to Cas, and felt a wave of apprehension wash over him.
After a measure of time that Castiel cannot name, Dean pulls back and presses his forehead against his own. “Feeling
Well, for values of "it" - that's all I managed to get written AND art'd before the end of Suptober. I still have 3 more chapters - two written and awaiting art, and one partially written and needing art.
Castiel shakes his head. “I’m too impaired to drive, Dean,” he starts, then pauses, studying Dean’s face with slightly bleary eyes. “Are you sober enough to drive? Perhaps we should find somewhere close by to stay the night instead…” Glancing around, he sees nothing but grapevines and the occasional farmhouse or adjacent winery. “Although ‘close by’ might end up being further than you could manage. Should we instead call an… what is it — Tuber or Luber or something — and come back for the Impala in the morni…”
Sam laughed, releasing him and holding him by the shoulders at arm’s length, a smile as bright as the sun lighting his face. “So, did you want to go get Dean and bring him here?”
in this equation.
Dean doesn’t answer, instead pulling Cas close and using him as a shield to surreptitiously glance around the room. As he suspected, several more pairs of eyes are on Roman and Valente — other players, some of whom are already out of the game. He also notices one face not among them — the little redhead, Charlie Bradbury.

The room suddenly plunges into darkness as Castiel loses control, his wings unexpectedly  manifesting with a thunderous crack that shatters the air and blocks the meager light from the lamp on the bedside table - quickly followed by true darkness as the lamp bulb shatters in a shower of sparks as Castiel reaches his orgasm; his shout like the cry of an eagle, back arching in ecstasy before collapsing upon Dean’s heaving chest, Dean’s heartbeat thudding in Castiel’s ear matching his own, their breaths short and quick in the aftermath. Dean’s arms wrap around him, pulling him closer and twining fingers into his hair.
Stealing across the kitchen floor and heading to the main part of the house, the first thing he noticed were several small figurines, no bigger than a child’s fashion doll, placed around the room in various locations and positions - some posed in rather embarrassing and inappropriate manners. Upon closer examination, he believed one bore the resemblance of one of the missing hunters.
It’s like a breath of fresh air and Castiel revels in it.
“Just drive, Dean. I’ll open your jerky.” Cas deftly rips the bag open and holds it out to Dean.
They rejoin Cas and Donna at the table. Jody hands Donna her glass and takes a sip from the other.
When Dean finally broke the kiss, Cas' expression must have reflected the question in his mind.
Kevin, or ‘the Prophet’ as he’s come to be known, is waiting for them, eagerness and impatience at war on his face. Even though he’s only a first-year, Sam’s best research intern earned the nickname for his uncanny ability to find the most elusive facts on any number of arcane topics. It’s like the kid has a direct line to God. Or the Universe.
“Right… when we first did wing exercises and you did your thunderbird thing…”
With that, Dean takes Cas’ hand and rests it in the crook of his arm. “I think it’s time to celebrate.”
All Dean can do is nod.
After stopping for the night in a quaint little seaside town in Oregon (“It’s called WINCHESTER BAY, Cas, we gotta stop!”) and breakfast at a nearby diner, Dean had tossed the keys to Cas. It took some convincing that yes, Dean was serious about Cas driving his baby — but it had been worth it just to see Cas’ (increasingly less) rare, bright, gummy smile.
Dean’s face splits into a big grin and he clinks glasses with his friend. They down the rest. Dean catches their waiter’s attention, points to the glasses, and raises two fingers.
For a while, all is quiet as they enjoy the pie, the beer, and each other’s company; the only sounds being the crackling of the magical never-ending fire and the occasional hoot of an owl in the trees. But then they begin to talk about the men in their lives who have influenced them; of course, Bobby, but also Rufus. Jack regales them with stories of Bobby and Rufus’ adventures in Heaven. He also talks about Ash and the Roadhouse, which leads to Ellen and Jo, and then Mary and Jess — the women who’d influenced the men they’ve become. Dean grinned as Sam began to talk about Eileen with a soft smile on his face and a flush on his cheeks that he’s pretty sure wasn’t coming from the beer or the fire, and makes a note to goad Sammy into giving that woman a call later. She was good for him, and Sammy deserved good things.

are we driving to Las Vegas when we have a perfectly good airplane at our disposal?”
it — if asked, it’s just alcohol. But it’s actually pretty tasty). “Who’s up for another round? I”m buyin’.” Donna and Cas are in deep conversation over the effectiveness of knives over guns, but both absently raise a quick hand.
Dean shrugs, feigning nonchalance while his heart beats a mambo in his chest. Lays down his cards — five and seven of Spades.
With a sigh he turns back around, taking a seat this time. “Yes ma’am.”
As the next hand is being dealt, Dean glances briefly over his shoulder at Cas and Lee at the bar, then suppresses a shudder. His former lover, and possible future lover — Dean’s surprised to find he really wants that to be more than just ‘possible’ — are perched on barstools next to each other. Lee shoots him a thumbs-up. Cas does nothing, but the fire in those blue eyes speaks volumes.
“Oh… oh no….” Sam gasps, as the image in the mirror snaps into focus — Dean laid out on a bed, on his back, naked as a jaybird; white-knuckled hands grasping the headboard above his head.
“He’s not answering his phone.”
where his brother and ex-angel boyfriend are playing the same game.”
“Yes, I know. I’ve heard all about it — multiple times, I might add.” She snorts. “Of course, being a
Dean can’t help but grin; he gets it. “I know how you feel.” He starts toward the car, his interest piqued now.
"You don't taste so bad... for a rotten egg," Dean says when they break, and the sounds of Cas' bright laughter fills his heart near to bursting.
“Dean… where did you get this?”
Dean settles back in his chair, arms crossed. “Oh, you mean Chet? Yeah, who do you think led me to
Lee almost laughs, the bastard. “Yeah, can you believe it? Tiny little thing.” He takes a swig of beer. “Her track record is legit, though.”
He blinks, and when he opens his eyes, his cards are completely different.
Dean smirks. “Oh, there’s more. Since we’ve been dating for several months, we have a shared suite.”
, Dean decides, setting the burgers and buns down and loading up a plate for himself.
Dean blinks as he gets his bearings, shaking his head to clear it. “Yeah, I suppose I did.” He meets the flight attendant’s eyes — yeah, definitely flirting with him. He briefly considers playing along, seeing where it might lead — but not today. He’s got work to do. Time enough for fun after Dick Roman is rotting in Hell.
Cas’ shoulder began to tremble under Sam’s hand. He squeezed Cas’ shoulder, HARD, and Cas finally turned to look at him, his eyes haunted and bright with brimming tears.
"Good thing I'm not as picky," Dean says softly, raising a hand to cup the back of Cas's neck and pulling him in for a long, deep kiss.
They make their way to the order counter with no further distractions and order their food, both choosing the “Dick’s Deluxe” with fries and milkshakes, then wander over to the group of Impala owners.
“Sam… Sam Winchester? What’s going on…” Tracy exclaimed, pushing against Sam’s hands as he helped her to a sitting position. Castiel returned to the bedside and handed Tracy more of the cupcake.
"And yet, you are not." Meg said gently, leaving aside her usual sarcasm this time.
"Hey."
Castiel stretched out on the couch before falling back heavily into it.
"Mix the cards, I’ll come back." He said to Castiel.
"Good." Meg sighed. "You’ll owe me one, angel."
Meg was definitely his favorite nurse and it seemed to be mutual. She had told him one day that she always arranged to be assigned to his room, for she liked their conversations, and Castiel could only agree with her. Despite her bad girl tease, Meg was now a good friend, always listening and present to support him in addition to being a good caregiver. Her honesty had helped Castiel to carry on in his fight against the disease and during his remission. They sometimes spent long minutes discussing their respective lives before Meg’s pager rang and she was called away. In addition, she sometimes smuggled him chocolate bars to make up for the hospital food and Castiel calling it "a survival aid".
"Just tonight." He replied, as if that explains everything.
Their first encounter had definitely been strange and completely atypical. They had arranged to meet in a café halfway between their two cities, and despite a tense start, Dean and Castiel had talking much of the afternoon. Dean had been biting his tongue all along so he wouldn’t ask the fateful question of "
, Castiel was smiling.
Castiel turned his head towards her with a small awkward smile as usual. He stood up gently in bed.
feeling spreading through his chest when he understood what it was. The first time he had read it on the tape player of his old Lincoln Continental, he had spent most of the time searching for meaning in the lyrics.
"I mean, no… Of course not, I was joking. What-"
At this, Castiel straightened up in the sofa, his heart going up his throat.
"Well, listen, if it’s to sell me something then I’m not interested, thank you."
For medical reasons, Castiel and his family weren’t allowed to know who the donor was. It was obviously not the priority in the eyes of all, but Castiel had insisted on knowing more and he had simply been informed that a heart had become available following a fatal road accident in the nearby city. There was something macabre about celebrating someone’s death, but that person had been generous enough to help other souls struggling to live and he could only salute that gesture.
Castiel let out a groan of frustration.
"No, wait!" Realizing that Castiel had still not hung up, Dean quieted down, a shiver in his voice. "I don’t even know how you found this number, but… Well, it doesn’t matter. You’re from Waterloo? Iowa?
Dean sighed.
" and Dean, who thought it sounded too much like "
Surprisingly, it snatched a small laugh from Dean who barely recognized the sound of his voice. He hadn’t laughed that easily in weeks now.
"It’s more of a set of brandy-cut wines, actually, but you did you know that-"
"Yes, I... of course." Castiel stuttered, rising to rush towards his computer.
"I’m not- Damn it, seriously!" Dean suddenly exclaimed in a raging gesture as Castiel won that round again." Dude, I don’t have any more clothes to take anything off!"
It was during a cold November evening, while he was bundled up in a plaid on his couch in front of a TV show, that Castiel’s cellphone rang. It was not something particularly unusual, but the late hour of the evening immediately gave this call something special. When he reached out to his phone, he could see Meg’s name on the screen.
"At least twice a day." Castiel joked while leaning in his pillows. "Did anyone leave a message for me today?"
At his words, Dean felt Castiel’s heart miss a beat under his palm and maybe, just maybe, was this the way his brother told him how happy he was for him.
Meg could not help sighing and Castiel pinched his lips with sympathy.
"Living a difficult situation and I would only remind them of their loss, yes, I know." Castiel mumbled without being able to help it. "But… Maybe that they also would like to know that the death of their loved one helped other people cope. It’s possible Meg. And maybe they just don’t know how to contact me or-"
Dean let out a contemplative "
"I’m here." Castiel immediately replied.
"Oh, uh, yes! Hello, sir, uh, Dean?" An uncertain voice immediately answered with a short breath and tangled words.
"What the hell wouldn’t I do for those beautiful blue eyes." She said under her breath. "Okay, I’ll see what I can do about the address." She says while rolling her eyes before standing up.
He did not know how long he kept this tape in his car, but now he had had time to learn each song by heart. As the words passed, so did the years, and soon Castiel and the Winchesters put whole apocalypses behind them, one after the other. Everything changed and yet everything remained deliciously similar in the small details.
Dean nodded.
"Dean-"
"I hate you.“
"But mom..." Zoe whined.
There was nothing Sam or Bucky could do. Only watch as Dean screamed in agony, as the hellhound kept tearing his body apart.
Dean nodded. He really was surprised, that just after a few days, he would already feel save and more at home.
"I do." Dean said, taking a step forward.
"Because that's what happens when you got Hellhounds on your butt. And because I'm smart."
"Well... this is a lot to take in and I'll probably ask more questions tomorrow, but for now I have to keep working, even though I believe I won't be able to concentrate on it..." Jody said and got up. "Don't cause any trouble." She said to Dean and then turned to John and Sam. "That goes for all Winchesters." She narrowed her eyes and the men nodded nervously.
"You died, saving others from a burning house. A girl was trapped upstairs. You sent her out the window and saved her, but then the floor gave in and half the house fell on top of you... There was nothing anyone could do." Bobby explained, knowing that the others still had problems to talk about it.
"I need no help. Especially not from a brat like you."
"These peopl- creatures attacked us. Dean saved us."
"Will he stay here forever?"
"You should look after your children. They'll need you now more than ever." Dean said in a raspy voice and the man nodded and mouthed a 'thank you' to Dean and helped the medics to check his kids for any injuries.
"How do I know that you are not him? How do I know, that this is not just another trick, another asshole-move to make my life more miserable?" Dean took a step foreward.
Bobby nodded. "They- We were all... not coping well. It will be hard to convince them it's really you."
"Yeah. You alright?" Sam asked Dean again.
"Boring."
The officer looked at Bucky who nodded and showed his Avengers ID. Then he turned back to Dean. "You're a little young for marschals, aren't you?"
The man looked at him with teary eyes. "No... She..."
"Yeah... sorry. About everything. I just-"
Mary looked at the others and smiled at Dean. "You must be hungry, I'll prepare breakfast."
"We were fighting and... where‘s Dean?“
"Great. How about you two step into the ring?“ Natasha suggested at Dean and Thor and both did so.
"Don’t worry. Some of them are really old anyway and Tony can buy all books again if he wanted to." Steve said and Sam smiled again and continued reading.
Dean hesitated. "Maybe... Could be a skinwalker."
"... right. Come on Dean, let's grab a beer." Bucky said and Dean followed him.
"Because God commanded it. We have work for him.“ Castiel said and they Avengers all stared at Dean.
„Come on, man, she is the Miss Universe of lying skanks, okay? She told you that she could save me, huh? Lie. She seems to know everything about Lilith but forgot to mention, oh right! Lilith owns my soul!“ Dean was pissed, but Sam didn‘t give up.
Dean nodded. "Sam? Cas?"
"Mostly?"
"And how much time had passed for you?" Dean asked curiously.
____________________
He turned around and saw Eileen and his daughters playing happily in the garden. He went up to her and kissed her. His life couldn't be any better.
Sam nodded and tried to relax a bit, though he glanced over to the direction where they are currently helping Dean.
„Just because I gotta die, doesn‘t mean you have to. Either we go in smart or we don‘t go in at all.“
"Earlier, Dean mentioned monsters... What was that all about?" Ellen asked.
"I don't know. They never saw his body." John replied.
"It’s been eight years."
"Not my fault it's so catchy." Tony grumbled and Bucky rolled his eyes.
"D-Dean...? I-Is it really you?"
"His soul is... it‘s not gone. It‘s just... somewhere else.“ Castiel said and looked around. He saw Black Panther holding the glove with the infinity stones in it.
"Ye- Yeah I... everything's fine..." He bend down and took his little brother into his arms.
"What do you mean?"
Bucky nodded and they leaned back and watched more Scooby-Doo.
"You can be proud of yourself Dean."
"Yeah, I guess that's a good way to explain it. A purgatory for those who can not follow orders."
"Killjoy."
"I want to know where."
"Yes, we should do it." Sam said and Eileen nodded.
Dean just shrugged.
"...so we help him...?"
"I earned it for you, so you could go to college." Dean mumbled. "And I won't really need it anyway. You know how it is on the road."
Cas, always being the more hands-on type, pulled Dean to him and held him tight.
tired - but is surprised to feel a small surge of energy coming through their clasped hands, through their Bond. This causes him momentary concern but is swept away as Dean guides him out of the kitchen, into the hallway leading to the library and down into the map room, past the stairs leading to the entrance he had barely managed to stagger through mere hours earlier, and down another hallway to stand before a door.
Castiel tilted his head in confusion, brow furrowed. “Yes? I’m the only other person here, Sam.”
As one, they tear open the doors and leap from the Impala, Castiel pulling Ruby’s knife from the inside pocket of his hoodie. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Dean on the other side, weapon in hand and aimed at Rowena.
But what he sees when he steps out of the door makes him wonder if he’s still drunk and hallucinating.
After a moment Dean pulls back slightly to huff a small laugh against his lips. “So, that’s a no, then.” He grasps the lapels of Castiel’s coat and deftly switches their positions, pressing him against the door and placing warm hands on either side of his face; soft, sweet kisses against his lips, his cheeks, his forehead.
"Dammit!" Dean looks unhappily at the blob of ice cream that had dripped from his cone and is currently defacing the front of his new shorts.
...Cas smiling, the flash of teeth as he laughed.
curse?”
In a flurry of movement, Ketch reaches into a hidden panel of his desk and draws a pistol, levels it at Dean, and pulls the trigger.
And his eyes - they’re
“Huh.” Dean sits back in his chair, his expression thoughtful, then turning resolute. “Then I say we leave it be.” He turns to Castiel, taking his hands again. “I don’t want to go back to being afraid…” He swallows, and continues, “Or being
Cas huffed, his breath warm against Dean’s face and making him warm… elsewhere. “Dean, you have not been in any condition to even have a “mood”, much less do anything about it.”
It’s actually in great shape, better than the places Dean usually ends up staying while on hunts. Cas still doesn’t seem very impressed, but after a tour of the room doesn’t turn up anything unsavory, he appears to accept his fate, accompanying Dean back out to the car to help bring in the luggage.
He’s no sooner zipped the bag behind him when Cas is there, curling into his side. Dean wraps his arms around his ex-angel and presses a kiss to the top of his head as Cas nuzzles sleepily into Dean’s neck.
Sam cut Dean loose and looked at the many knife wounds. "You are bleeding heavily."
"I'm not looking for a friend."
"Yeah, these are Katie and Ben." He gestured and they both said 'hello' to Dean.
"Oh come on. Angels... Really?"
"Alright Ruby, where is she?" Sam asked.
"It’s not that easy." Bucky muttered.
"..."
"Oh Baby..." Dean whispered.
They sat down at one end of the table and when the others started to eat, they both instantly started to dig in as well. Both Sam and Dean never had a meal like this and after eating they were both so full, that they thought they never had to eat anything in their life ever again.
"Dammit." Tony shot lasers at them, but they also didn’t do anything, as they just got up again after they fell down.
Everyone stared at Dean and he started to shift from one foot to another.
Now Dean had only hours left and Bucky observed as Sam talked to Dean. He told his brother that‘s it‘s going to be fine, that he would do anything to prevent Dean from getting dragged to hell. Bucky looked at Dean, as he looked at Sam and for a split second he saw that Dean‘s eyes looked confused and scared. But then Dean nodded and pretended to be alright again.
"Shut up."
"No, Tony. Don't. We will only think about that when there is evidence."
"Well, Sam told us about the Winchester-Luck. That's basically their only hope." Bucky grinned.
Bucky wanted to, but he just looked unsure and shook  his head.
"You-... he-..." Jody stammered.
"Well, for us, you died four months ago." Castiel said and stared at Dean.
"Mary?" John asked and Mary looked concered.
Dean groaned. "Look. You guys have nothing to do with the supernatural, so I won't bother you-"
"What?"
"She is the best." Dean agreed and looked proud. He opened the trunk and the others were shocked by what they found.
"Just try not to use your arm." Bruce said to Dean.
"That sounds like a dick move." Tony said and shook his head.
"Keep trying." Tony said.
______________________________
"You don't know that." Dean said in a bitter tone and just sat down at the table. Sam sighed and made himself comfortable on the bed, trying to sleep while Dean stared out the window. They never really were in the city with their father. Always on the road, in old hotel rooms in the middle of nowhere. Now he could see almost all of New York and he realized how many people there lived and how almost no one had an idea of what's out there. All the monsters and creatures. Dean thought about his mother and the yellow eyed demon that killed her. He thought about his father and how he always saw him as a hero. Not the Avengers. They had no idea what John had done to keep his sons safe, what he had done to keep his brother safe.
"We killed all of them. You are welcome." Tony said.
"Good morning sleepy head." Sam smiled as Dean came into the kitchen.
"What if you would stay here?" Tony asked and Sam and Dean raised their eyebrows.
"Nah, don't mention it. Just don't get into trouble. If ya need help with yer old man, just tell me. He ain't looking all that nice." Travis said and left.
Sam smiled at them. "I mean it. Just because Jack is up there, doesn't mean you two get a free pass for everything."
"What?! Of course he can!"
"Are you sure it was around here?" Tony asked, as they walked around in the dark forest. "You didn’t just made that up to get some free time with me, did you?"
"We were in foster homes. But they were all shit. So we left."
"The stones take a lot of power. You will need your strength.“ Tony said and Castiel nodded.
Meanwhile Dean let out a deep breath, sat down in the Impala and looked at the house again. This was what they could have had... He and Cas... But it wasn't meant to be.
Now only the stones had to be brought back to the right place and time and everything would be perfect.
"God, someone do something!"
Castiel looked at him. "There is a problem in Tenessee. According to a dog, there is a man who eats other animals to absorb their powers."
"Good night, uncle Dee."
"Well I told you not to touch it.“
"Thanks, Tony. You don't have to-"
Cas closed his eyes for two seconds and when he opened them again, he looked shocked.
Dean sat on the bed in the otherwise empty room. Only a small table stood next to the bed and on top of it was a dusted old picture and his necklace. He put the necklace on and then looked at the picture. It was John with a young Sam and Dean. Dean had it in his pocket when he died and Sam probably wanted to keep it somewhere safe.
Then Ellen spoke up. "Well, I am Ellen Singer. I have a daughter named Jo and after a... not so good working relationship, she and I moved here, where I met Bobby. We married a few years ago. We own the roadhouse, which is not far from here and Bobby owns a junkyard, where he and John fix the cars."
Dean knelt down and patted the dog. "Miracle?" As if the dog understood him, Miracle barked happily and started to lick Dean's face.
It was Castiel who answered.
"You could help me to fix the Impala and my old Mustang." He suggested.
Bucky stepped forward. "You will leave? Now?"
"Exactly."
"Yeah... I just need some time to think."
"H-Hello, sir."
"Unbelievable..." John started the Impala and drove towards the tower. "Have you told them about the Supernatural...?"
"Yeah, yeah. You know me. I'm always careful."
"I don‘t know. I only know that they will never change.“
"What year did you went into that quantum-thingie?"
Then, as Bucky turned around a corner, he bumped into something.
"Sounds good.“
"Come on Dean. Your brother is smart and he will help a lot of others when he becomes a lawyer. Just because you had no interest in school, doesn't mean that he can not reach for high dreams." Bucky defended Sam.
"Do you want to keep working with dad? Fixing cars?"
Castiel and Jack went upstairs and Dean laid down on the couch.
"About 600 miles."
"So God exists?" Castiel let out a deep breath.
"Who the fuck are you?" She asked.
Suddenly the engine of the Impala went on.
"What could be so important that dad would skip out in the middle of a job? Dean, what the hell is going on?" Sam looked ahead and saw the woman standing on the street. He stopped the car and Dean instantly worried.
"Dean?" He panted from the fight and Dean laughed at him. "You scared the crap out of me."
"Dean... You remember hell, don't you?"
"... a dog told you that...?" Dean asked Cas.
"What?!" Bucky asked.
"Are you a firefighter as well?!"
"Yes." Sam nodded with confidence and Bucky smiled. Then he turned to Dean and grinned. "And you, idiot, take care of your brother and don't cause too much trouble."
"She lives here?" Dean asked surprised.
Some time later, Dean got a call from Natasha that Tony came back from space. Apparently he fought against Thanos as well, but they also lost.
"I get it, alright. Just... Just take care of yourself." Dean packed all his things and grabbed the bag.
Tony left the room and the two brothers were left alone.
"You arlight?"
While Tony and Dean talked about good music, Bucky looked at Sam.
"...Thanks Travis. For everything."
"Then to my tower. Bruce can patch you up."
Crash
"Wait, wait wait. If angels exist, shouldn't they... protect people...?" Clint asked and everyone looked at Castiel.
"Don't worry, I will call SHIELD on the way back. They can handle it. We should worry about your wound."
"Sam is a decent young man. Don't ruin him," Natasha said from the other side of the room and Clint nodded.
"Bucky!"
______________________________
"... okay, maybe I was a little bit annoyed that they spend so much time together. Doesn't mean I was jealous."
"Yeah, we feared he would do something stupid." Tony said.
"Yeah... The yellow eyed demon... He- he hurt Dean, but I shot dad's leg and so the demon left him, but we were on our way to the hospital and- and the demon caused a truck driver to drive into us."
"There's gotta be something, some way. Whatever it is, I'll do it."
"Yeah and how did you get in here without us knowing?" Tony looked confused.
"I'm sorry, Dean. I wouldn't whish this upon my worst enemy." Ruby said and then they heard hellhound howling and growling. Dean looked to his right and Sam and Bucky looked at him confused.
"I don't really-"
Sam realized Dean's interest. "Do you think it's a case?" The others looked at the brothers.
"Should we just let him go?" Bruce asked worried.
They started to run and have a look, but when they reached the outside, it was quiet again.
"And they are already better then all the other homes we had." Sam pointed out.
Dean and Bucky looked at a broken vase on the floor.
Dean only glared at Sam. "Don't talk about her like that."
"Noo! Papa stop!" Jack laughed. "Daddy, help me!"
The two brothers went to the main area where they arrived yesterday and were again surprised by what they saw. The large table next to the kitchen was filled food. There was bacon, eggs, pancakes, bread, cheese, fruits, cereal, and many many more delicious things to eat.
"Well we don't always get what we want, do we..." Dean said and it became quiet between them.
"God doesn't know that this universe still excists and he won't look for it, because he doesn't even know that a part of him is missing. He is too arrogant to notice."
"There is no way Sammy. Just accept it like I have. Makes it easier." Dean said.
"Yeah okay, I programmed FRIDAY to let you in, in case you returned." Tony said.
The problem was, that Thanos stood close to Castiel and Sam right now.
"Daddy!"
Dean nodded. "You- the other Cas actually dragged me out of hell, but that is a different story. In the beginning, Cas helped us and we helped him, but after time he became close to us. He became family. He- Cas was my best friend... We were a team. Cas, Sam, Jack and I. Jack was... well again, complicated. But he was family too. We- we fought against monsters, demons and in the end even against God. But that son of a bitch just... I don't know... Everything just went wrong. We lost everyone. So many friends died..." Dean had tears in his eyes and the others looked like they wanted to hug him.
"...Dean... you are the most honorable man that I have ever known.“ Tony whispered and hugged Dean tightly.
Chuck raised his hand again and looked Dean deep in the eyes. "You have courage. You are probably my greatest creation ever, but now it's time to move on."
Sam looked at Eileen and she nodded. "Let's go inside, Kids."
"God damn it." Tony sighed.
Sam's eyes widened.
"So, you didn't know about her either?" Bucky asked Dean, as they opened their beers.
"Okay girls, let the man breath." Sam shot Dean an apologetic look and pulled his daughters away from him.
Castiels wings appeared behind him, but this time they didn‘t look dark and broken. They were colorful, like the rainbow colors of the infinity stones. They were larger and the feathers looked as soft as the clouds above.
"You sure you don't need my help?" Bucky asked him.
"Dean. You need medical help. You-You can not just walk away when you inhaled so much smoke."
"It's alright, Dean. Please, wake up." Mary soothed him, as she knelt down next to John in front of the bed.
"And? I love cartoons. Besides it seems like no one here has watched it before. Not even Clint."
"Come on, Cas." Dean said and turned to the twins. "You two raise some hell, alright."
"What are you?" John asked, as he stood up and stood in front of Mary.
"Yeah... he is-" "Son of a bitch!" "...here." They heard Dean yell in the background.
Now the machine was finished, and they needed a test run. Dean volunteered.
____________________
"My eh- brother is a medic. He'll take care of him. Don't worry. Focus on the kids." Castiel told them. The medics still looked sceptical, but then left.
They got into the Impala and Castiel told Dean where to drive.
Now, two months after Dean's death, all the Avengers came back from a mission. When they entered the Avengers tower, FRIDAY had told them that Sam had left.
„What?“
"Of course... FRIDAY? You recorded everything, right?“
Travis nodded. "Well, that's sad. You are good with cars and it won't be easy to find someone else to do your job. But I get it. So here." Travis handed Dean same money. "You earned it."
"Still, it must be hard for you." Dean said in a low voice and Castiel nodded.
"Mary awake yet?"
"This isn't just about saving you, Dean." Bucky said and looked at him sadly. "This is about saving everybody."
"What the hell? I'm a hunter. Just like you guys. I mean yeah, I wanted to be a firefighter when I was a kid, but that was never an option. Though we once dressed up as firefighters and we dealt a lot of times with fire... especially with burning ceilings." Dean muttered the last part.
He heard some voices in the back and then Steve talked to him.
"I-I don‘t know...“
"He's right, Sammy. We did it. Ruby, Lilith, Lucifer. They are all gone now. And... I know it doesn't mean much, but- but mum and dad would've been proud of you." Dean said.
"I see... You know, I kind of liked it."
"Cap what's going on?"
"M-Monsters? Like...?" Mary asked confused.
"What is it?" Steve asked.
Rob sighed. "God liked to change the characters. In this world, all angels and demon are normal humans who can die by normal causes."
"A few days."
"Out. I need to find answers and you guys are not helping."
Dean nodded and turned to Tony to thank him. Meanwhile Sam walked up to Bucky.
"Ha ha, funny Sam." Dean said and smiled slightly.
"You really want to just leave?" Sam asked.
"And stressful. I mean you guys basically lived on the streets for some time." Sam said but Dean just shrugged.
"FRIDAY, I want to know what that was, right now." Tony said.
"No 'buts'. You can draw something nice for uncle Dean."
Dean nodded. "Arlight. Just, let me finish this up." He pointed at his coffee and Sam nodded.
They said at the same time and Happy chuckled. He brought them back to the tower, where the Avengers had already prepared dinner.
"Y-Yes, sir."
When they heard him, they all turned to look at him. They looked scared and confused.
"I just- you don't have to watch it. It's a kids show..."
Sam looked at Dean. "Totally jealous." He whispered and Dean laughed slightly.
Sam glared at him. "Last time you were on a hunt, you got impaled by a screw."
"You will teach me?"
"It's a law school interview and it's my whole future on a plate." Sam explained.
"He- We had to get the stones in order to bring everyone back... Dean sacrificed himself.“ Tony looked at them. "I am so sorry.“ He whispered.
"... I'll build a better hospital in here. You gave me the feeling that they will show up here quite often, probably close to dying." Tony muttered. "Oh! And better weapons. Maybe I should build them suits. Yes! That will help them!" Tony was in overprotective-mode and instantly wanted to help the boys, even though they just left. Bucky only laughed and looked outside the window. They would be fine. They had to be. Otherwise he would loose two boys who were like sons to him and he wasn't sure if he or Tony, or any of the Avengers could deal with that.
"I told you not to call me that.“
"Hey!" Bucky pulled Dean back and pushed him away from Sam.
"Hey, saved your ass." Dean said. "I'll tell you another thing. If you screwed up my car... I'll kill you."
"It’s fine."
John nodded. "There was a car accident. A drunk driver hit Dean head on on a railroad crossing. Castiel was behind him in his '78 Lincoln... We always called the car 'Pimpmobile'." John said with a chuckle. "Anyway Dean was unconscious and Castiel ran over to grab him and get him out of there. Shockingly enough, soon after a train came and rammed the front part of the Impala."
Finally he opened one door and found Bucky bound to a table in the middle of a room.
Scott did and at the end Tony looked sceptical. "I don't know... It's- it won't work."
"Ah, Sam by the way. Dean talked to me and we brought your stuff over to the tower. So if you want to continue your little... date then I am happy to tell you that the tower is open." Tony grinned and Sam looked lost.
"No... no no no. He is not- he can not be-“ Sam started to shake and Bucky, who also looked shocked and close to tears took Sam into his arms.
"It's my father's car." Dean said and nodded at the Impala.
"Come on. I'll drive us home." Castiel said to Dean and they made their way back to Castiel's house.
"Okay okay, you did it together guys. Stop fighting. Both of you." Steve stepped between them.
"Oh come on! There are enough of us out there. A few people missing won't make much of a difference."
"Well they are the strongest." Sam grinned and Tony snorted.
Dean coughed more. "Are- Are the kids- alright?"
"Daddy?" Jack asked in a tiny voice and Castiel's heart broke.
"So you are partly God?" Charlie asked again.
"We should go, young warrior! See how strong you are!" Thor said excitedly, but Dean shook his head.
"Just- just don't tell Sammy. He doesn't need to know this."
"Nothing we can do now. Let's just hope that the next time we see or hear from them that it'll be happier." Bruce said and all of them hoped so.
Bobby shook his head and put on his vest.
"Honestly? We don't know. Serial murder? Kidnapping ring?"
"So, some demon pulled you out?" Bucky asked.
"Yeah, couldn't be better." Bucky said annoyed.
"Yeah, well-" Bruce stopped talking and the others looked at him.
"I'm sorry boss. He just surprised me, when he said he saw me changing into a dog. I panicked, killed him and just got out of there, before someone saw." A skinny man replied.
"I had a job in the city. Some killings happened. I thought it was the yellow eyed demon but it was a false lead."
"Hello." Castiel said in a monotone voice.
"Oh yeah, he even cleaned it. I'm telling you, that man knows something about cars."
"Oh... err... I don't- I mean I-... women. I only... women."
"Why should we believe you?" Benny asked. He had trouble to look Dean in the eyes.
"Then I watched you guys. God liked you. The way you and your brother changed the world, the decisions you made. I don't have to tell you that everything went to shit after a few years. God became more and more... mad. He lost it and wanted to destroy all worlds. All universes. I knew that I couldn't do much. I am only a small fraction of his existence. But I still tried to help. So when he destoryed all other living things, I used all my power to shield one Universe. This universe."
"Yeah.. I mean, that’s the closest thing I could think of. Maybe werewolves... Just- people with sharp teeth tried to kill me."
Sam explained everything that had happened and after that the Avengers told them more about their recent adventures. Then everyone went to bed, Sam to his old room and Dean to a guest room.
"I- I don't know if-" Jessica started but Tony interrupted her.
"Well, That is a surprise. I thought you were too scared and left after you realized I found out about this place." God said.
Dean just nodded and Sam handed him a cup of coffee.
Dean just looked at his little brother. "Dad's here."
"M-My w-world?" Dean asked confused.
Dean pointed at it. "Weird."
"Yes and well… Dean made the same deal."
"Wha- oh... No I... What happened here?"
Dean took a deep breath and went inside. There, in the living area were Sam and Castiel, talking about what was going on. Miracle laid on the ground next to Sam.
After another 10 minutes of driving, the tower finally came into view and the brothers looked impressed by the size of it.
"There are more than one...?"
"Alright, you already have your room, so make yourself at home. I will order some stuff for you since you both don’t have much. As for your weapons, I want you to hand them over."
"What? I was just helping." Tony defended himself.
"I'm home"
"I am so sorry, but your husband is in a better place now... Good luck." Bucky said and followed Dean. The woman looked at them, but then shrugged it off.
The others looked just as shocked. Castiel and Sam stood closer together and exchanged a worried look.
Dean just shook his head and Bucky eyed him intensively.
"By the way, how did you know about the ghost, that she wanted to find peace?" Tony asked.
"So God exists?" Jo asked.
Dean got up on shaking legs. "Sir... I- I'm sorry. She didn't make it..."
"Jerk."
He followed Sam to the back of the room. There, behind a curtain, was a metal door. Sam opened it and there were more stairs that led down to more rooms.
They all sat at the table, with Dean sitting between Castiel and Sam and Miracle laid under the table, on Dean's feet.
"What do you want?" A young boy asked from inside. Bucky recognized the voice.
“Yeah, will be back in a sec.“ Dean said and Castiel zapped them away.
Later John got a call and had to drive to the next town to fix a car of a friend there. In his hurry, he forgot his phone there, without even realizing. Meanwhile Bobby had to go over to Ellen's place to help her out, so Dean was left alone on the junkyard.
"I will leave as well, talk to Jack about everything, but I'll see you around." Castiel said to Dean, while Mary talked to Jack and the boy laughed slightly.
Then suddenly the light in the room became brighter and the shadow behind Castiel got bigger. Then suddenly the shadow formed wings behind his back and they spread across the whole wall in the back.
"And what Sammy, then give a Colombian necktie to a girl?"
"Eh thanks." Dean said and looked up at the ceiling. Then he put on a fresh shirt, but didn't bother to change the rest.
"Okay, that is creepy." Clint said.
"Had some trouble with the government, you know about them controlling us and keeping us in check. The old thing." Tony explained.
"I couldn’t protect him."
"For me time is different. I have access to old times, though the future is more difficult to look at. The more I try to get involved with time, the higher the chance that God will find me."
"Whoa, easy, tiger." He said and Sam finally saw and recognized the man.
"We try not to overdo it. But you know Dean. He wouldn't accept the money."
"Don't tell me you didn't mention it. Oh Sammy, always trying to be humble." Tony said and Sam rolled his eyes he looked over and saw the other Avengers as well as Dean and Cas sitting there. He groaned.
"I can take care of myself, you just make sure that Sam stays safe."
"Be careful.“ Bucky whispered as he, Sam and Castiel prepared to help fight off the aliens.
"...no, sir. He wants to stay."
"If it's too painful for you to see us, because we remind you of your family, then we will leave you alone. But if you need us, if you don't want to be alone... then please stay." Castiel said and looked Dean in the eyes.
"Yeah, well if they are real, then I have to learn about their weakness." Clint shot back at her.
When he stepped in, there was only one other guy in there. Dean carefully picked up some peanut butter and when he was sure, that the cashier and the other man weren’t looking, he put it into his pocket. He went over, to grab some sandwiches, when suddenly a hand grabbed his arm, preventing him from grabbing it.
"What about those... werewolves? Are they still out there?"
______________________________
"I have to try. Dean is- he... I owe him everything. He doesn't deserve to rot in hell."
"I'll help you." Ellen got up and went with Mary into the kitchen.
John parked in front of the tower and Dean walked inside, while his father waited in the car.
John knew that his son had loved the car, but this Dean... For him it was home.
"I can not bring everyone back. Otherwise too much would be different, but those who died for you and Sam, those who fought for the world, I saved them."
"Just take it Sammy."
"Yes. But you still have a chance."
"For now, we will just fix her up a bit and then we will see who will drive her." John smiled at Castiel and he nodded in appreciation.
"What about that noise? Any idea?" Tony asked.
They mourned his death, thought of way to bring him back, but they knew it was not possible. Dean was gone.
"This is getting weirder and weirder.“ Tony muttered and walked away to grab a beer.
Both boys nodded.
"He is not.“ Castiel said nervously and turned to Tony. "Where is he?!“
"It looks abandoned."
"You alright pal?" Dean asked as he walked up to him.
God only laughed. "Oh Dean, oh Dean. Still not giving up." He snapped his fingers and multiple cuts appeared on Deans body. Dean screamed out, as blood ran down his face, arms and torso.
"Pepper?! Shit, sorry. How are you? Who else is there?" Sam asked.
"No. But I have a lead." Dean said.
"Well, enough of this family drama. Let's hunt some ghosts." Tony said.
"That poor thing! Tell Dean if he ever needs my help with the car, then I will fly over and be there in a few minutes!"
"Maybe..." Tony thought out loud and activated a hologram with his watch.
"That's because you're out of practice."
"... Oh. Good to know." Clint still started the movie and Bucky groaned.
"Can't sleep?" Tony asked, grabbed a beer himself and stood next to Dean.
After a few minutes, Tony's car arrived and Dean and Sam put their bags into the trunk. Afterwards they sat down in the backseats, while Bucky sat shotgun and Tony drove them towards the city.
"... What even...?"
"What? We saw the news. You guys fought against some weird alien thingies... again."
"CAS!“ Dean still screamed. He landed on his knees and the others ran up to him.
"No no no, Cas!" Dean ran towards him and held onto him.
"No, nothing... We had some troubles recently with another demon, but... damn it."
"It is done." Castiel couldn't believe it.
"I only have 3 months left. Have to make the best out of it."
"Be careful."
"Sam! It's us!" That was John and Sam opened the door.
Rob continued. "I grabbed that version of Jack, that God had created in his mind and gave him my powers as well. I am just an empty shell and I will soon vanish completely and become one with Jack. He immediatly knew what was going on and so we got here to bring an end to this."
He put on his jeans, as well as an old plaid shirt from John and then went towards the kitchen. He managed to make himslef some coffee and stood by the window, looking outside. It looked peaceful out there and it was probably spring or summer, by the look of the trees and flowers in Mary's garden.
"Natasha, Bruce, Clint, Scott and I will get space, mind and time stone in New York, Thor and Rocket will get the reality stone. Tony and Dean will go to Vormir to get the soul stone and Nebula and Rhodey to Morag for the Power Stone.“ Steve explained.
Dean just shrugged. " 'm not cut out for school."
"How can you be so relaxed?" Bruce asked.
"Sounds disgusting." Clint commented.
"Can he come when we go camping next time?"
Chuck turned to Dean. "I am not. I only took this form because I knew that you would listen." Chuck's body suddenly changed and now he looked older, with grey hair and a beard. "Maybe this is more comfortable for you."
"Dean, this is earth. There is no heaven or hell. No God." Sam said and looked at his brother confused.
When they did open, everyone raised their weapons and pointed them at the door. Even Sam grabbed his knife and couldn't wait to get answers from the imposter. How dare him pretending to be his dead brother.
Sam smiled and even Dean laughed slightly.
"Go! Go!" The three men ran away from the car and when the Impala got closer, they jumped over the railing of the bridge.
"Do you know where our friends are? If you show us, then we will help you."
"How did you do it anyway? Why not just say 'hello'? You got some superpowers?" Clint asked.
"No, thanks. We're good." Sam laughed. Tony always tried to give them as much as possible.
Dean stared at him and Chuck released a big beam of light. It went towards Dean and covered him. After that he was gone and Chuck stood all alone in an otherwise empty universe...
Lucifer laughed. "You know Sam, I wanted to meet you. You should just say yes and all of this will be over. You will have a great life, believe me. We just have to work together and we can make this world a better place."
"Yeah, though he still is better with them than Sam. Sam would have tried to modernize her and I don't know... bring the technology up to date or something."
______________________________
"Dean-“
-- 7 years later --
"No." Bucky said and Tony looked at him with a dramatic, disappointing look.
"Where is she?"
"Bobby is coming and he has... someone with him." Tony said.
"In most universes that God created, there were angels, demons and mosters. Only a few worlds are like this, were there are no supernatural beings. For example, there was one where the whole world was taken over by zombies. Another one only has vampires and werewolves and some of them have angels and demons. Heaven and Hell. In Dean's world, there were all these creatures and more. The world was full of them and Dean was a hunter, just like the rest of his family."
"Who are you?!"
"Hey, bud. How are you doing?" Tony asked softly.
"Dean, I can not ask you to-“
Sam wanted to say something, but then someone knocked on the door.
"I apologize for that. I did not mean to do it. I only tried to talk to Dean."
"What everyone wants." The man shrugged.
"Any idea who screamed?" Bucky asked.
"He looks like him." Jack whispered to Castiel.
"We should have met his father and made sure that he was fit to actually take care of Dean."
Dean glared at him, but his arm really hurt and if he can not fight, then he can not protect Sammy. He sighed and nodded. "Alright. But if you try anything funny I’ll-"
"I don’t know Sammy. First I need money. Before that we can not go anywhere. We need more ammo, salt… We should be happy we have a roof over our heads."
"What? I kinda liked it."
"Oh screw  you guys." Dean huffed and the others just laughed.
"Hey Sammy."
John closed the door and put more salt in front of it, while the others tried to calm down the kids.
"I would have turned into a skinwalker as well, but a scratch won't turn me... I think..."
"That was brilliant Tony." Sam beamed at him.
"To protect us!"
"Hello Castiel. I am not the Jack from your world, but it's still good to see you." Jack smiled at him.
"Come on idjits. I'm not gettin younger." Bobby mumbled and Sam and Dean laughed at him.
"Jerk." They smiled and hugged again.
"Oh yes. They are all great. Not the perfect parents, but they took care of Dean and me when we were younger."
"He won't be trapped long. Whatever follows next has to happen quick." Castiel still wasn't sure and it was clear to the others that he was scared of Lucifer.
"No, not yet. I think it would be better if we tell them all at the same time. We have to think of a way to explain it to them." Sam said  and Castiel nodded.
"So... What's with him?" Dean asked as he nodded at Tony who looked really concentrated at something.
Bobby looked at Bucky. "He and I'll follow."
The Dean that just returned from the dead turned around and saw an older Jack and... another 'him' standing there. "What the-?! I-Is that... me?!" Dean just grinned at him.
"I could never miss Stark's breakfast." Dean grinned and they went inside.
"It's not getting easier you know."
Suddenly, on top of the staircase, two children stood there and caught the womans attention. "You've come home to us, mommy." they said. They appeared in front of her and hugged her and the woman began to scream. Meanwhile Bucky managed to push the dresser away with his metal arm and the guys were free again. The woman and her kids disappeared into the ground. It was over.
Multiple heroes and soldiers from Wakanda came over and looked at him and his wings like he was some kind of god. Of course, most did not know about angels and demons.
"Don't! Don't stand there and look so calm, while people are dying all around us!" Dean was pissed.
"Don't. None of this is your fault and we are glad we can help you." Castiel said and then he and Sam said goodbye to John and Mary and left as well.
"Please stop!"
"NO! That can not-!"
"Wow!"
"Yeah, like..  puff." Dean made some gestures with his hands.
Jack laughed, but then furrowed his brows.
"Dean, if you want to talk, talk. I'll listen. The others too. We can even get you a therapist."
"Mmmmmm! This tastes awesome!" Dean said, as he shoved another piece of bacon into his mouth.
"No fighting. Why do you always want to fight...?" Bruce asked tiredly.
"Cas...? What happened?“ Sam asked, as he and Cas stood in the middle of nowhere.
"It can not be him..." Tony muttered.
Sam, Dean and Castiel drew a sigil on the ground in an old building. They chose one that was further away from civilization, in case that something goes wrong. Cas brought holy oil and they prepared the trap for Lucifer, as well as the summoning ritual.
"I don't pay attention to that."
"Dean!" Castiel went up to him.
The clock hit midnight. Dean's time was up.
"NO!" Sam screamed.
"WHAT?!“ Dean and Sam asked at the same time.
Sam nodded and smiled slightly at Bucky. He turned and saw Dean keeping an eye on him from the distance. He and Bucky then went to him and together they met the others by the car.
Sam groaned and wanted to follow as well, but John grabbed his arm.
"This is the great living room and right behind it is one of the many kitchens. We have three fridges in here, because you know, Hulk and Thor... and Sam's brother Dean. They all eat a lot..." Tony wanted to continue, but Bucky and Dean stepped in to help Sam.
"Here are dates that lead back to Steve's original time. This must be ancient.
"We want to bring you back home." Bucky said and looked at him.
______________________________
"What if Dean is really-?"
"What you dont't know about me could fill a book." She looked at Bucky. "You know, your stupid talking computer is really annyoing." Bucky glared at her and hoped that she did not destroy any of Tonys stuff in the tower.
"This is all Hydra. It's about some... mutations and experiments." Sam said.
"Sooo... what now?" Dean asked.
Everyone was happy, but Tony only stood there, his shaking legs gave out on him and he crashed to the ground.
The ghost nodded and almost looked hopeful.
Tony shook his head. "No parents, but Cap is right. You two will stay here and tomorrow we talk about... well everything I guess."
"More? You mean there are more of those monsters out there?" Tony asked and Dean nodded.
Dean walked carefully in front of his brother and they made their way towards the center of the room.
"You are supposed to say 'Jerk'." Dean said, but Sam only looked more confused. "Forget it."
"AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!"
"Yes. Come on. Get in." John opened the car door and Dean sat inside.
"Sam, don't" Dean interrupted Sam. "Come on man, what are you, blind? Can't you see this is a trick?"
"Where are you two going?" Natasha asked. She, Steve and Bruce were in the kitchen, cleaning up dinner, while Clint and Thor played some video games.
"It's... Dean is frustrated. He fixes the Impala like a madman, but it's the only way he can cope."
"That's so cool!"
______________________________
"No." Dean just said.
At the hotel he found a picture of Dean, himself and John when they were younger and Mr. Welch confirmed that their father was there four days ago. He found out that his wife was buried in a plot at their old place. Apparently the husband was unfaithful, which meant that they were dealing with a woman in white. She was suffering from temporary insanity and murdered her children. After that she took her own life. Now her spirit was cursed, walking backroads and when she found an unfaithful man, she would kill them.
"Fucking disgusting." Dean muttured as he looked around a bit more.
"...mornin..."
Dean slowly got up on shaking legs and walked towards God again.
After a minute of just awkward staring, Dean sat up. "I- I should leave. You guys should just pretend this never happened and continue with your lives."
"Don't apologize Sam. We‘re sorry for what happened, but we are also glad you boys are both alright." Steve said.
Dean blinked and realized he was back. He gave Tony the cassette tape. "It worked. It fucking worked Tony.“ Everyone smiled.
"Oh come on Sammy. You know us."
"They are creepy man." Sam said, as a shiver ran down his back.
"I am not leaving you."
They walked around a bit, but the house seemed empty.
"Tony took care of her mostly."
______________________________
Bruce and Steve showed them the way and soon they stood in the gym.
Tony sighed. "Okay FRI, can you track him?"
"So the scream was just to get someone's attention..."
Sam opened his hotel room and was surprised to find Tony and Bucky standing there.
She looked at them and then disappeared again.
"For once, just shut up." Dean had a murderous look on his face.
"Well, we are all glad that you feel more at home now."
"Bullshit." Dean rolled his eyes. "Come on, Chuck. I know it's you."
"It's alright Tony. We will figure this out... I don't know how, but I will make every damn demon deal if I have to. We will find a way and-"
"God damn it!" Tony looked pissed and Bucky immediately placed his hand on Tonys shoulder.
"Look! There!" He pointed towards some light, coming from a cabin and they slowly made their way towards it.
That was enough for Bucky and he came to help the boys. Ruby kicked Sam away and then was attacked from behind by Bucky.
"Where are you going?" Sam asked.
"Dude, I live with Tony Stark."
The next day Dean went over to Travis' garage again and when he arrived, he stopped breathing. There stood a lot of cars around to fix, but one of them was an Impala. He walked up to it and looked inside. There he saw one of the soldier toys that he and Sam always played with when they were younger. He tilted his head and even saw his and Sam's initials that they carved into the rear package tray.
"I think the others would have called, had they found something." Tony replied, but they headed back anyway.
"What...?"
"Just shut up for a second, Ruby-"
"And? What does the upper class say?“ Dean asked, as he cleaned his dirty hands with a towel.
"You alright?"
"There was a wendigo and we ran out of ammo, but dad and I still had some explosives. I lost my phone and it was too close to the wendigo. The explosion went off and booom."
"Wait! Sam, that's not Ruby. It's not Ruby!"
"Good luck?" Dean asked and grinned.
Tony knew that something was wrong when he saw Bucky walking into their room.
______________________________
"Oh... Not bad. I guess it's alright." Dean shrugged. What he did not know was that Bucky was a good observer and saw the dirt on Dean's hands, but he kept it to himself for know.
"Avengers...assemble.“
"Yeah, whatever she did to her, it seems all right now. That Constance chick, what a bitch!"  Dean yelled.
Later Bucky went looking for the boys. To his surprise, he found Sam near the garage and... he was not alone.
"We'll stay together in one room." Dean interrupted him and Tony shrugged.
"I am Lucifer! You mortals will not stop me." Lucifer said frantic.
"What the hell's taking Bobby?" Dean asked and right then the sprinkler system with holy water went on and the demons screamed. Sam managed to open the door and Sam, Dean, Bucky and Ruby went inside.
"He is pretending. And sooner or later he has to face up to who he really is."
"Yeah... Cas too. What about Tony, Bucky and the others?"
Turned out that truly half of all living beings were missing. The Avengers that were still there tried to help as many people as they could. Natasha and Steve did most of it, working together with the last people of the government and the police to keep some kind of order around.
"Hey."
"So, God exists?" Steve asked.
"Oh Bucky, you hurt my feelings."
"How far?" Dean asked.
Dean was deep in his thoughts.
"I want to do this and you know it. You know my life, the things I‘ve done... It- It has to be like this. I said we will do it, no matter the cost. You and Bucky will spend time in that damn house that you build. It would be too big for Bucky alone.“
"My throat's a bit raw, but otherwise I'm fine. Really."
"That was in your world, where there were demons and monsters." Sam told him.
"So that's you, huh? Our slutty little Yoda." Dean said. And Sam and the demon turned to him.
"I'll be back in a few minutes." Castiel said and left the house. John also got up and clapped Dean on the shoulder. He went over to Mary and the others in the kitchen and so only Dean and Miracle were left at the dinner table.
"Oh Steven... So much to learn. He is bi and now shut up."
He woke up with a scream.
"Wow."
"10 in the morning." Sam answered and Dean was surprised. He doesn't remember a time when he could sleep this long.
„For all we know she works for Lilith.“
"Alright, come on." Dean said and motioned for Bucky to follow him.
"Well, it's just- I mean, with all these guys going missing, people talk." Amy's friend said.
"Oh please no." Dean groaned.
"Please please please!!"
"Dean-"
„Okay, she‘s a liar. She‘s still got that knife.“
"I was on the phone with Troy. He was driving home. He said he would call me right back. And... he never did."
Jack grinned as soon as he heard the word 'ice cream'.
"It was four months up here, but down there... I don't know, time is different. It was more like 40 years."
"Then we should have a good fight and see who is the better warrior!" Thor yelled and Steve looked a bit nervous.
"Spy on my sons."
"... Can I crash here? I'm too tired to move. I'll just sleep here on the couch, if it's alright."
"Yes, Sam. You know that I'm not happy with this fancy life. I'm not smart, I‘m not a hero. I just want to help dad."
"Perfect!" Dean said and grabbed some.
„Dean-“ Bobby tried, but he was ignored. The Avengers also looked at each other, not knowing what to do.
"So you say that there were millions of universes and now there is only this one left?" Sam asked.
"Dean?! You alright?“ Tony asked, as he carefully touched Dean‘s shoulder.
"Bruce, buddy? You alright?" Tony asked him and Bruce pointed ahead. The other Avengers looked in the same direction and their eyes widened. There, in the corner of the restaurant was non other than Sam fucking Winchester... with a girl!
"Guys, this is Pepper. The greatest woman on this planet... Don't tell our russian spy I said that." He winked. "Pepper is the reason that Stark Industries is still running and kind of keeps us all in check."
"So this is where she drowned her kids." Bucky said.
"Exactly. You were a kid. WE should have tried to help you more. We should have convinced you to stay."
Bucky groaned but kept following Tony. A day earlier they found some clues about some illegal experimentation where Hydra was most likely involved in. Now Steve, Natasha, Bucky, Tony and Wanda investigated. They split up to cover more ground and Tony insisted that he and Bucky go together in one direction while the others went to the other direction.
"I feel like we should lock you two up so that you won't hurt yourselves anymore... I never get hurt, even though I am always fighting up front." Tony said.
Dean just took the keys out of his pocket and the Impala drove towards them.
"No, we don't..."
"Ah shit, you're right. That's today." John smiled and he and Dean went into the kitchen to help.
"No... I never heard of anything like this."
"I don't know. I think it'll help him, but..."
Dean sighed. "Like vampires, werewolves, wendigos, demons, witches,... you name it."
"Maybe..." John and Mary said at the same time.
"So we need the stones.“ Bucky said.
The father of the little girl came from behind, but Bucky quickly covered his mouth. "Shhh. We're here to help, okay?" The guy nodded and Bucky let go of him.
"Give me the stones!“ Thanos yelled and Tony tried to dodge him.
"Well, let's check it out." Dean said and they drove off.
"Nonsense! This way my lady." Tony led her out of the restaurant and told FRIDAY to bring over the quinjet. Sam followed and then glared at his brother.
"Yeah, though all your lives are completely different. In my world all of you were dead and all of you were hunters."
Sam went up to the door and opened it. Dean hesitated for a second, but then stepped outside.
After a minute Bucky came out of the station and saw Dean standing further away from their car, staring straight ahead.
"Sam wants to check out the library first."
"... the what?" Castiel looked at Dean confused.
"Yes, of course you are. Mom, dad, Bobby, Ellen. All of them died some time ago. Then you were taken by the Empty and only Sam and I were left. But Chuck- that son of a bitch was too strong. We tried Cas... we tried, but he was too powerful. Sammy died and then he killed me." Dean said and he sounded so extremely tired.
"If it would've been, then Dean wouldn't have left." Tony muttered.
"God damn it, Dean!"
"Dean, I can take hi-" "No!" Dean snapped at Bucky. "No one will touch him." He whispered and carried Sam out of the livingroom and into their bedroom.
They laughed, but then Sam turned serious again.
"Shouldn't we think about this more? I mean maybe Dean really just-"
"Excuse me, what?" Tony asked confused and they imagined that the kid must be rolling his eyes.
"No. I will never help you."
He knocked again, but there was again no answer.
"Well you behave like a 16 year old."
"I could never do that. Family sticks together." He smiled at Dean and he grinned.
"Fact is, she saved Dean. So that's good." Bucky said.
"I know this wasn't easy, but it's better that they know." Mary said and Dean nodded.
"Then why not get out. You said you and Sam hunted for years. Couldn't you have just... stopped?" Castiel asked.
John realized that Dean wanted to change the topic and together they started to fix the car.
Dean nodded, but just as he was about to take out his lighter, something attacked them from behind.
"We should let them in and see who he is and what they want." Steve suggested and Tony told FRIDAY to let them in.
"Not that far." Dean said.
"Yeah, wish I could say the same for you. What were you thinking, shooting Casper in the face, you freak?"
Dean didn't say anything and it was quiet between them. They heard the twins yelling and laughing.
"I can't."
"...Dean..." Bucky wasn't sure what to say, as he tried to hold his own tears back. "Dean, look, you held out for 30 years, that's longer then anyone would have." Dean cried slightly and tried to take deep breaths.
"Your world." Jack said to Dean. "But there he is just a human. No powers, no abilities. Just a guy who may seem a bit crazy to others."
______________________________
"You son of a bitch! Stop playing games!"
"Sorry, buddy. I can't go out with you." Miracle laid back down again next to Dean and he sighed. It would be good if they told all the others, because then he could go out again, though what would he do...? There are no monsters to hunt. Dean thought back at his relationship with Lisa. After Sam's 'death' he tried to live a normal life, but he jumped at every sound he heard and instinctively tried to grab a knife or a gun. It would take some time to get used to the peace and quiet again.
