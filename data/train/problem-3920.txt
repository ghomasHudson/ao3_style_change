“I understand. I’m very strange for my species too,” Cas says, aiming for comforting but sounding more resigned. “But it’s not a bad thing for you,” he adds, “especially since you have Jack and me looking out for you now.”
Cas knows from experience he shouldn’t press Dean for so much personal information. Dean has never been a man who talks about what is most important to him, and there’s no surer way to send him reaching for the nearest bottle of alcohol, but Cas’s curiosity has reached its apex.
Novak reaches beneath the desk and holds out a key marked 15, a sardonic expression on his face. “You’re welcome to kick them out. I’ve already tried unsuccessfully.”
“It was implied,” Dean says blithely, waving off his protests. “So I figured, if this dude who doesn’t know me from Adam-”
Dean straightens, eyeing the cup in his hand warily. “You didn’t make it?” Does he sound almost disappointed?
“Come on,” Dean pokes Cas in the thigh. “You were the one who wanted this job in the first place. All the ‘human dignity’ you could choke down and all that crap.”
“Yeah?” Aaron asks as Castiel nods in confirmation. “That’s great! I’d go check it out, but the Debate club meets at the same time.”
“So, theoretically,” Cas starts, his voice deceptively light, “all I have to do is tap my heels three times and think
“Yeah, all the girls who wanna be like Jo sign up, and all the boys who want to see Jo all sweaty show up with semis,” Dean says with a shudder of revulsion.
“You’ll also want to avoid Tuesdays afterschool,” Daphne tells Castiel. “Jo’s self-defense club meets then, and it’s also got a large following.”
He needs to find Dean. What he has with Dean is tangible, real - unlike this scent, which could just as easily disappear once the wind blows the other way.
“I’d give my first born to ensure that isn’t the case,” Cas says gravely. “But you know how unpredictable they can be.”
Castiel chuckles. “Yes, I do know a professor at Cornell who is studying just that. But my focus is much closer to home. I study,” he inhales a small breath, “tribute bands.”
Dean flags down the bartender and gets two drinks to bring back to Sam, who’s probably doing something illegal on his phone.
Dean bends down to pick it up. He scans the page, his scent flaring with exasperation. He crumples it up into a ball and lets it fall back to the counter.
That was Kelly’s last night out for a solid month. Every other weekend, her usual babysitter called in sick or said she was busy. And usually Kelly would be happy to spend more time with her son, but come
Cas doesn’t even bother to deign Dean’s question with an answer. Instead, he pulls the pie stand closer and carefully sections off a slice.
“I needed a better baseline now I’m human because you and Sam are not ‘normal’ by any definition of the word,” Cas sniffs.
She had turned her back for one minute to grab a set of towels from the highest shelf, and by the time she turned around, Jack was gone. She scans the surrounding racks of linens, her eyes peeled for any sign of Jack’s Spider-Man shirt. Heart beating erratically, she pushes her shopping cart back towards the bedding aisle - Jack had been enamored with a set of hideous, bright orange sheets, and Kelly had only gotten him away by bribing him with a piece of nougat.
With Dean’s heat, he’s ready for round two within the hour, and Castiel’s rut means his refractory time isn’t much longer. Dean offers to present again, which Castiel takes him up on. The image of Dean on his hands and knees, back arched and ass up, thighs already glistening with a sheen of slick dripping from his hole and practically quivering with anticipation, isn’t something Castiel will forget.
Dean gapes for a second, the corners of his mouth twitching, as he tries to figure out what to address first. He opens his mouth, but his words catch in his throat as Professor Tran enters the room, glaring the assembled students into silence. Unsurprisingly, she did not dress up for Halloween.
Dean ducks his head. “I don’t know any graduate students, and I,” he breaks off, his cheeks going pink, “I never went to college, so I have no idea what it means.” He sucks on the dregs of his latte, gaze dropping to the vicinity of Castiel’s knees.
But Jack is already distracted, his bright blue eyes fixed on a spot over Cas’s right shoulder. He babbles excitedly, pointing. Cas nudges the spoon closer, but Jack ignores it.
“That’s what I’ve been saying!” Jo says, exasperated. More hair than not has escaped her braid, and her forehead has a sweaty sheen to it. “First a bunch of guys jump me, and then the fucking book isn’t here! I cracked open four Glenn-Rieders for nothing!”
“It all comes from a place of love,” Dean says with a confidence Cas could have never predicted just a year ago.
with these people every day,” Cas hisses, wringing his hands. “The last time an executive got… busy with a coworker in the pool, the mocking didn’t end for
“I think Benny was easier for Chuck to find since he’s ex-special forces - Delta something or other? Anyway
Dean spins around in a circle, panic racing through his veins. He was so stupid, thinking that, what, Cas’s love for him would show him the way?
Breath hot and heavy against Dean’s lips, Cas grips the edges of Dean’s flannel, anchoring him to Cas’s front. His mouth is hungry as he kisses Dean, and Dean can’t help the way his hands reach up to tangle in Cas’s hair, dark and soft, and everything Dean’s ever dreamed of.
Castiel exhales a slow breath. Pizza would be nice. He skipped his last meal to wrap up the last of his weekly quizzes. “Sure,” he tells Dean.
He carefully lowers himself on her bed. If he angles himself right, he can almost imagine she’s there with him, sitting propped up against the headboard, just out of his field of vision.
“Not sure,” he admits. “Sam’s got his Hunter Hogwarts thing going on - I could help Sam out, but the thought of reading and assignments makes me want to throw myself out a window.”
“You were a very admirable companion,” Cas says, “of course I wouldn’t. Not to mention, Jack would have been extremely upset.”
Cas tucks Jack’s blanket more firmly around his little body. “Of course,” he adds to Dean, “I still consider raising you from perdition to be the most defining moment that set me on the path I am on today.”
This past weekend, Castiel went down a spiral of Dean Winchester content. He read up on all of Dean’s recent projects, scanned headlines about rumors of his next film - some action thriller that Castiel presumes is the reason for Dean’s diet - and watched interview after interview. Dean on Stephen Colbert. Dean on Good Morning America. Dean on some very confusing show where they forced him to eat spicy chicken wings, which seemed like an exercise in pepper-based sadism.
On a series of shelves next to his closet, Dean arranged a few dozen action figures in various combat or damsel in distress poses.
Jo laughs. “What else would I do? And what company would ever trust me to walk the straight and narrow with my history?”
Benny’s expression lightens a fraction. “I once… escorted out a man saying inappropriate things to Jo.”
“Indeed,” Dean pulls his laptop out of his briefcase and opens to the first slide of his presentation. “At Sandover, we took the liberty of a preemptive check of your systems and found quite a few holes, as you can see here.” He points to the colorful pie graph.
He sighs. “Maybe I made the wrong decision in telling them. Maybe I just sacrificed Jack for a would-be werewolf victim in Tillamook, Oregon. I just don’t know.”
“Not since I was a teenager,” Dean murmurs as he halfheartedly reaches for a box of tissues on the nightstand. “Been on suppressants since I got my first major role.”
She rounds the final corner before the Teachers Lounge and stops dead. Because Aaron and Kelly are hovering outside the door and
Cas’s eyes are wide with surprise, and his cape is askew. A vibrant assortment of mardi gras beads hang around his neck, and someone’s covered his dark hair with about ten different shades of dye. He looks like a rainbow attacked him and then threw up on him for good measure.
Dean will make up his mind once he actually talks to the guy. Determined, he yanks open his back door, strides across his back porch, and heads over to the naked guy in the far corner of his yard.
His cock demands attention, but Castiel tries to ignore it in favor of Dean. He doesn’t dare touch himself - he has a feeling his knot will pop in a minute flat, and he has plans other than accidentally knotting Dean's bedsheets.
because apparently there are zero boundaries when it comes to Team Free Will. And Sam, like a total Samantha, said most people talked about their feelings and life goals.
Dean sighs, scrubbing the heel of one hand down his face while he props up the other behind him to support his torso. “Jesus Christ. I’m fucking all this up. Sorry - I just didn’t expect to run into you here.”
“Fine,” Cas says, his face set. He gets up. “I can coordinate with Rowena at a later date. She should focus on the cursed box, anyway. It’s clearly a more pressing concern and the reason we called her in the first place.”
Cas steps back, his heart rate already jumping with a jolt of adrenaline at what he’s about to say. “I don’t intend on leaving you because I love you,” he says in a rush, the words almost tripping over themselves to tumble out of his mouth.
For Christ’s sake. It’s the second day of school - Jody is very confident her teachers have better things to do than cross boundaries with new colleagues.
Next to Dean in the Impala, with her engine rumbling comfortably in the background, the familiar smell of leather seats, and faintest whiff of mostly-cleaned monster viscera that would be undetectable by human noses, Cas relaxes like he hasn’t since Jack was born.
Might as well get a drink while he scopes out the crowd. He’s just joined the amorphous blob surrounding the drinks table, when he hears his name called.
“I’m pretty sure that’s not the case,” Cas says carefully, “Except with Amara, and she was - what did Sam call her? - batshit crazy.”
Castiel stares straight ahead, his lips thinning. “He wants his old job back. I saw him meeting with Michael late last quarter.”
“It was recently brought to my attention I needed a bathmat,” Dean grumbles, “and a shower curtain that doesn’t have the Scooby Gang on it.”
Behind Daphne, Benny surreptitiously slides Charlie a few bills, muttering, “I told them this was stupid.”
Dean leans against the door frame, crossing his arms over his chest. “So you randomly decided to hit up a tattooist with our grocery list,” he says, eyebrows rising as he reads
To add insult to back-stabbing injury, his manager gave him barely 48 hours notice, so his usual work hotel was booked up by couples looking to escape piles of dirty laundry, children, and sticky countertops. At least, Blue Skies doesn’t charge by the hour, so he’ll avoid the more skeezy Valentine’s day guests.
A brilliant sky blue. He ducks his head and trails a finger over the nameplate. “How d’you pronounce your first name, anyway?”
“Because I threatened to chop her hands off with a cleaver the first time she did it,” Benny drawls.
“Gotta say,” Dean drawls as his heart pounds with nerves. Doubt niggles at the back of his mind like an itch he can’t scratch, but he’s already made his memory foam bed. Might as well lie in it. “Cas is the weirdest nickname for James that I’ve ever heard.”
Cas swipes at it with a cupped hand to nudge it right back outside, but the frog evades him with one impressive overhead bound. To Cas’s complete consternation, it settles on top of the nearest kitchen cabinet. He scowls up at it, the complete opposite of Jack’s burbles of glee.
A small, petty part of Daphne is tempted to deny it as punishment for keeping this from her. But mostly she’s relieved. “Yeah, mostly,” she mutters.
Dean’s barely wrestled the top off with shaking fingers of leftover anger when a knock sounds against his door.
Dean turns to him, unintentionally jostling Jack, who wakes up with a small whine. “Hey buddy,” Dean soothes, reaching for him. “Time to wake up already?”
shake for dinner, Castiel keeps looking. He tracks down a neglected jar of peanut butter in the back of Dean’s pantry and a half-empty bag of whole grain bread.
“Another Roadhouse,” Cas says like it’s obvious. “Those hunters Sam is teaching, they will need another meeting point once they’ve completed their training.”
At the first touch of the pads of his fingers to Dean’s dripping hole, Dean’s whole body spasms. He circles the rim experimentally a few times, Dean muttering curses under his breath.
“No safer place than Fort Bunker, then,” Dean says with a confidence that doesn’t match the apprehensive look in his eye.
But Dean found his ability to convince older girls (and boys) to sleep with him and sweet talk bartenders into giving him a beer from age sixteen onwards translated to other… pursuits. They moved to New York City after Dad left, and Dean quickly fell in with the right crowd. They assumed he was the heir of a French banker with a fifty million trust fund, and he just never corrected them. Before he and Sam skipped town, Dean got a bank to loan him another fifty million. Dean used most of the money to fund his next scam, but it was fun while it lasted.
Castiel grimaces, the comparison killing the mood - just enough. He doesn’t smell like a goddamn candy apple factory. He glances around: their meeting has attracted a few curious eyes. A few heads down the line, a lady takes her phone out of her purse.
When Dean first approached him in a bar after a long day of lecturing 250 half-asleep freshmen, Castiel would have taken him up on his offer even if Dean didn’t look like a movie star fresh out of a blockbuster Western, slightly affected drawl and all.
“That you were proposing a threesome, either with my past self or yours?” Cas asks, eyebrows raised.
“Out... back?” Castiel repeats dubiously, craning his neck to catch sight of their on-site baker, Benny, who is busy kneading focaccia dough for tomorrow’s sandwiches. Benny, full of southern politeness, doesn’t give any indication he’s eavesdropping.
“I’m sure not all films are like that,” Castiel says. God knows, Anna’s made him sit through enough films with an omega protagonist that did not fit the typical romantic comedy restrictions.
Dean blinks, his anger falling away to a raw hurt only Cas can dredge up. “I wouldn’t do that to you.”
“Not in a bad way!” Dean says quickly. “Shit,” he swears under his breath, “please don’t stop bringing me coffee.”
“I see,” Castiel says, sounding taken aback. He fiddles with the strap of his bag before slinging it over his shoulder.
Castiel inhales a surreptitious breath. It’s not every day one gets to catch the scent of Hollywood’s omega darling.
“’Cause I’m trying to see what his limit is, and so far I’m not even close,” Jo says, shrugging. “Hop to it. He gets real grouchy if you make him wait too long.”
While Castiel might not know as much about Dean as some movie-goers, he hasn’t been living under a rock for the past five years. It was all over the papers when Dean was cast in his first alpha role. Dean wasn’t the first omega actor to do so, but he was certainly the most prominent.
A two-inch-long frog rests on the open sill, right in the path of the frame. In the overhead kitchen light, its back shines bright green with a black stripe running from each eye down both sides of its body.
“I mean, like, genuinely nice,” Jo says, rolling her eyes. “Not many guys would let me pick their pockets over and over.”
“Does it really matter?” Dean’s eyebrows rise in challenge. “I said I’m not gonna hurt him, and I won’t. You don’t believe me?”
Aaron slides between the thinning crowd to duck out into the hallway leading to the bathrooms. As he gets closer to the men’s room, he slows. There are
“Are you experimenting with pet play?” Cas asks, and Dean would bang his head against his kitchen table if Cas wouldn’t hear it and get concerned. “If so,” Cas continues matter-of-factly, “several of the collars you’ve already ordered in the past should work just fine. But if you’re looking for a certain aesthetic-”
God knows, Dean could never have forgiven Cas for any of the shit he pulled if he hadn’t been 100% positive Cas had the best of intentions. Cas did all those things to save the world, and, sometimes, to save Dean personally. Which gives him the girliest, fuzzy feelings and also makes him want to punch a wall.
“Trust me,” Jo says, flipping her hair behind her shoulder as she sets Castiel up for a third cup. “Your scent’s getting in the way, but it tastes exactly like an apple pie.”
Dean, sporting a massive scowl, crosses his arms over his chest. He announces, “I’ll let you neuralyze me on one condition.”
“Oh, apart from that?” Dean echoes mockingly, but his words lack any heat. He crams a few fries into his mouth. “I asked my agent to send me a few more scripts with omega roles,” he mutters.
With a broad grin, Dean dials Crossroads, Crowley’s go-to place for impressing his business contacts. He talks with the hostess, Casey, pretty frequently, but he still has to fake a panic attack to get her to find a table for Crowley within the next two minutes.
“Yeah, a lot of it.” Sam sets aside the laptop and reaches for a nearby letter in a robin’s egg blue envelope.
Cas slots his leg between Dean’s, his thigh lightly brushing against Dean’s hard cock, and Dean has to actively concentrate not to rut against Cas and shoot his load in thirty seconds flat. He groans as Cas applies a bit of pressure.
After exhausting all the Myrtle bush perches, Wart climbs higher than ever before, halfway up one of the Douglas Firs.
“Seriously?” Dean demands, chuckling a little, because, honestly, the thought had never occurred to him. “You’re the
“I couldn’t tell her it was all bullshit and wreck whatever placebo effect was working its magic,” Dean says in a low voice.
Cas raises the blade, and it hovers an inch away from his throat. “How are we getting back, specifically?”
Dean always thought scaling Mount Everest with a plastic beach shovel would be easier than convincing an angel to feel that way about anyone. Cas is a wave of celestial intent; waves of celestial intent don’t do anything as human, as stupid, as fall in love.
“No,” Daphne says, nose wrinkling. “And I don’t want to. I’ll stay here, out of the splash zone, thanks.”
“What the hell are you doing here?” Cas demands, hackles raising as he zeros in on Jack cradled to Dean’s chest.
Rowena looks up, blinking guilelessly at them. “Of course! It’s one of the most basic spells a witch can learn. I had it whipped up in a jiffy.”
“The guy who used to live there was smarmy and British and ate a lot of baked beans, judging from the smell.”
“You can afford a weekly latte, Dean,” Castiel chides, reaching for him in the dark. “I might even start charging a handling fee.”
“No - I mean, maybe - never mind,” Dean fumbles, more out of sorts than Castiel has ever seen him. “It’s that nobody out and says that, even to me.”
“Hey, what you need - hell, what we both need - is a win,” Dean says reassuringly. “Everything’s been such shit, you need a reminder to keep going.” He gets up from his seat, his legs itching to move. “Why don’t you tell me more about that man of yours?” he asks quickly, his words nearly tripping over themselves to get out before the regret sets in. “Maybe that’s the key to getting your head back in the game.”
God knows Castiel railed enough about the unfairness of Dean Winchester to Gabriel enough over the past few weeks.
Castiel dutifully picks up the mozzarella sticks and fries as Aaron double-checks his tray of glasses won’t topple over.
Mouth busy, Castiel hums, sealing his lips to Dean’s hole so Dean can feel every vibration. He dives back in, trying and failing to slurp up the slick pooling by his chin. Dean keens, chest heaving, hips jerking every which way, trying to anticipate where Castiel’s tongue will move next.
Castiel freezes, inklings of dread trickling down his spine. Does Dean want to stop? He can’t see a damn thing except the barest outline of Dean’s body. “Can you turn on a light?” he asks, frowning at the sound of rustling linens and bedclothes.
Castiel snorts as he raises a hand to gently rake his fingers through Dean’s hair. Dean shivers against him, letting out a pleased hum, and relaxes.
Behind Dean, expansive windows make up practically the entire far wall, showing a rapidly darkening Hudson river view. In front of the window, a large flat screen rests on top of a wooden stand. To his right, a six-foot-tall case contains hundreds of LPs, grouped in square cubby holes. A state of the art record player sits by its side.
Dean’s mouth twists. “It’s not like I could threaten you with a cleaver - you’d probably tase me from an air vent before I got close.”
“No, the food’s fine. It’s the room,” Dean says quickly, craning around his chest-height cubicle wall to watch Crowley and Naomi leave the office.
Castiel nods. He inhales a deep breath. “It doesn’t smell as strongly of you here as the car.” He can think much clearer up here.
“It’s for the kids!” Dean protests over Castiel’s chuckles. “Benny’s got a lot of skills, but he has a lot to learn when it comes to pie. The kids need to know how to make a good pie.”
“Just logical,” Castiel says evenly. “It shrinks my dating pool considerably, but I’d rather do what I love than compromise who I am for any potential partner.”
At noon on the dot, Dean strides through the halls of Mountaintop Insurance. Clad in a perfectly tailored suit and holding a smart briefcase, Dean strides up to the welcome desk. “Hello, I’m Richard Cole from Sandover Securities here to demo our data security software for Amara Tenebris.”
Jack babbles with a wide grin, his little fist jabbing at something underneath one of the Myrtle shrubs.
“Dean Winchester,” Dean says shortly as the man finally puts his book down, “I called yesterday about a room.”
Biting his lip, Cas weighs the last option before he opens the VPN Sam showed how to install a few years ago. He carefully selects a random IP address from Iowa and opens his email.
Cas throws him an exasperated look. “Perhaps a few years ago. But now? I’ve made too many mistakes, and people have suffered - you and Sam have suffered - as a result. You don’t need to spare my feelings, Dean. It’s hardly what I deserve.”
“What- oh,” Cas says, his eyes flicking down to Dean’s lips before back up again. “Yes?” He points. “They’re all the way down there, though, so they can’t -”
And Dean’s not an idiot - Cas obviously experiences emotions now. Dude’s been through too much not to feel something. But Dean’s never deluded himself that they could ever include all the romantic lovey-dovey, chick-flick moments crap.
Cas throws him a bemused look. “Sometimes I don’t understand you at all. You were right there when Rowena said it wouldn’t affect me in the same way if I already harbored feelings for you. For a moment I was worried you would -”
Cas takes a seat and reaches for his laptop. As he wakes the machine up, Wart hops in between his two hands, blinking curiously at the computer. His dark, horizontally slitted pupils reflect the bright screen.
He licks his lips. “You’ve always come back. All I’m asking for is one more time, man. One more miracle for a believer.”
At the bar, Dean signals the bartender for a refill. He glares down at his phone. The little rectangle contains his entire history with Cas, call logs, text receipts, everything.
Sam slides his phone back into his pocket. “Do you have that sort of intel on Mountaintop? A client list? Detailed assets?”
Dean makes a noise of frustration, but, oddly, Cas gets the feeling he isn’t really angry. “It’s just - I like him, alright?” He glares down at Jack, like this is all his fault. “He’s cute as shit, and he’s obviously not about to start another apocalypse ’cause it’s Thursday. Hell, he’s the one who let me in here in the first place - no thanks to you, Greenpeace. I’m not gonna do anything to him except get him ice cream, stat, since those lima beans were nasty.”
“Oh,” Castiel says, meeting his eyes briefly before he continues his perusal of Dean’s body, memorizing every divot and hard plane of muscle.
That’s just great. Dean hops off the stool, meaning to ask the hostess if anyone’s asked for Winchester, when
Castiel didn’t really understand the Saturday Night Live skit where Dean played one half of a demon-hunting brother duo, but the live studio audience laughed uproariously at multiple points.
In the 7th floor hallway, Dean stands outside 7J, his finger poised at the doorbell. He pauses, but he doesn’t have to strain his ears to catch the sound of Bob Seger coming from behind the door.
Dean’s mouth lifts into a small smile, and it’s like the sun rising through the early morning fog. “You too, man.”
“We would put you in danger,” Cas says, watching Dean carefully for his reaction. “Many powerful entities want Jack for themselves.”
He clears his throat. “Cas? You got your ears on?” He half expects the words to echo, but it’s more like the Empty swallows up most of the sounds.
By the time the party hour rolls around, Dean’s got most of a costume scraped together. It won’t win any awards, but it’s better than goddamn
Castiel raises his eyebrows as he leans over Dean to finish grabbing the tissues himself. “You’re on suppressants?”
“Thank you,” Dean mouths to Cas as he raises the cup to his lips. He says into his phone, “Well then, the guests’ll just have to use the bed sheets, won’t they? ’S not like this is even a real problem yet, Kev.”
“That would be bad? Doesn’t Batman live in a metropolis?” Cas asks, brow furrowing. “I assume it would be difficult to maintain any secret identity in a small town.”
Jack cried the whole ride home. His behavior over the past eight hours has tried Cas’s patience like no one else - except maybe Dean, when he’s woken up and forced on the road with no coffee.
“Exactly,” Jo says. “Benny is busy,” she says, tipping her head towards where Benny is adding more flour to a huge bowl.
Dean laughs. “Look,” he starts, his expression turning a fraction more serious. “I might be fucking up a good thing here, but do you want to go to a Lez Zeppelin show next week?”
The woman perched on the edge of the bed lets out an ear-splitting shriek as the man swears, spinning around and grabbing a blanket to cover himself.
“Look,” Dean says, abandoning all joking pretenses with one word. “D’you want to come back with us?”
As Cas sweeps around the desk, he tells Wart, “I’ve been reading children’s stories to Jack, and we just finished the Sword in the Stone. King Arthur was called Wart before he became king, and I think it’s the perfect name for you - it’s quite hilarious actually.”
“’Cause she’s a menace who knows how to pick locks?” Dean heaves a weighty sigh. “I’ve known Jo since we were kids. She and her mom - who started Hunter’s Cafe - were my neighbors.”
It did not escape my notice that you stole one of my sweaters - one that you frequently mocked, I might add. Please return it at your earliest convenience, either by post or in-person. I don’t think I need to say which option I would prefer.
Dean ducks behind his computer screen as Crowley grabs his jacket. Right in front of Dean’s stunned face, Crowley pushes open the door for Naomi to walk through first.
He bundles Jack up against the early-morning chill, tucking him into a thicker onesie than he wears around the house. He wrestles small shoes onto Jack’s feet and straps Jack into their all-terrain stroller. Jack whines and fusses the whole time, so Cas capitulates on the hat, which stays behind.
“What?” Dean strides forward on shaky legs. “No - I mean, I don’t know. They could be fucking in a supply closet for all I care.”
Dean cracks one eye open, and, to his surprise, Novak looks pretty genuine. “You are not even the worst guest I’ve seen today.”
“I thought, while we had a little time, I might as well show Samuel some protection charms.” Rowena casts a sly look up at Sam. “He didn’t know any, the poor lamb. Totally unprepared. After all, you never know when the, ahem, mood will strike.”
“-And that’s what you do for family,” Dean continues, a little confused and insulted. They are family; Cas said so, back when he thought he was dying in Ramiel’s barn.
Castiel could stay here forever with Dean’s ragged breathing echoing in his ears, his slick coating his tongue, his powerful thighs bracketing his face.
Wart wiggles free from Cas’s grasp and makes a series of leaps for his salad bowl. He splashes down and sinks to the bottom, sulking once more.
But Dean’s genial expression doesn’t waver. “‘M feeling pretty much human again, so it’s up for grabs.”
“’Cause the whole point of doing these stupid macho alpha flicks was so I could get the clout and money to do the stuff I actually like,” Dean continues. “But I kept thinking,
Dean carefully sets down his colt and pads over to the bed. He takes a seat near Cas’s shins, the mattress slowly but surely dipping as it remembers Dean’s distinctive ass print. “What happened?”
“’S fine,” Dean says in a tone that clearly says it isn’t. “Whenever Dad took off for a few days, I’d get to watch as many movies as I wanted, and - well, the rest is history.”
Dean passes frat row without an ounce of regret but with a whole ton of nerves. He’s practically vibrating out of his skin by the time he reaches the hall where the Association is having their party. He slips through the door and follows the noise of the people and music, down the stairs and into a wide room filled with people he doesn’t know. He scans the crowd, looking for Cas’s distinctive cape or Charlie’s hair, but everyone’s colorful costumes keep catching his eye instead.
But the already feeble desire snuffs itself out as Novak’s eyes, full of intense suspicion, meet his.
Cas takes it as a question - even though it isn’t because Wart is a frog. “Because they would take Jack away from me. And the worst would be having no hand in his upbringing at all instead of all of it.”
By the time he gets back to Dean, pocketing the dollar fifty tip Marv left for his western omelette, fruit salad, danish, and coffee, Ambriel is just bringing out Dean’s lunch.
Cas hovers awkwardly by Dean’s desk, his hands shoved into his coat pockets. “You’re so capable of love.”
“Look,” Jo says, lowering her voice, “Dean’s famous, sure, but he’s actually a very private person. He runs his mouth to anyone who’ll listen, but he never really says anything important. So he doesn’t really connect with a lot of people. If he says he likes you, I’m gonna say that’s a good thing and make you his designated errand boy. And if you tell him I said any of this, I’ll kick your ass.”
Dean thumps him on the back. “Good move,” he says, “these three are the worst gossips in the school.”
Dean’s only cave to the holiday is a pair of fake vampire teeth he’s currently keeping in a ziploc bag. They give him a giant lisp, so he’s saving them for after his seminar.
Dean chuckles. He sets aside the beautiful painting of his baby (that one’s going in the Dean Cave for sure) and picks up the next package of similar size and weight. He eagerly tears off the top and pulls out the contents. It takes him a second, but the trenchcoat slipping off the figure’s shoulders is a dead giveaway.
Cas purses his lips. He could climb on top of the counter to reach it, but the frog would probably only jump further out of his grasp. After the day he’s had, Cas has no patience left to chase a frog all over his kitchen.
email address. (That particular joy was only overshadowed by the ten little digits right above Dean’s signature.) Second, to make sure he’s going to the right place.
“No,” Cas says with finality. “It was while I was an undergraduate student. Beltane - I had not adequately been warned.”
“That’s fantastic,” Castiel says, a delightful warmth filling his chest - still a pale reflection of Dean’s excitement.
“Oh,” Castiel says, his cock straining almost painfully at the zipper of his pants. He wracks his mind for something to talk about that isn’t X-rated. “I’m sorry about missing the concert.”
The Titanic was wonderful while it lasted. My friend, Balthazar, financed the bulk of the trip. However, things devolved into pure chaos as the boat started to sink. They prioritized the women and children for spots on the lifeboats - rightly so. Balthazar and I spent so long bobbing in the water before the Carpathia came to the rescue, we thought we were going to prove that vampires could die from exposure after all.
“One who’s gonna get fired if I don’t get all my work done,” Dean hisses as he keeps one ear on Crowley and Naomi, one ear on Cas, and one ear on the hotel clerk currently yammering to him about their spa amenities through his work phone.
Sam will laugh himself silly once Dean tells him his perfect match wound up being some corporate suit. Dean once told him he’d rather microwave his own head than set foot in an office cubicle.
“Look,” Dean says as he scoots further up the bed so he’s more aligned with Cas’s chest than his knees. “You were the one who was all gung-ho about getting a job to interact with normal people.”
Dean shrugs. He won’t write it off completely, but he can’t start this… thing with Cas with any secrets.
Castiel scans his room, trying to see it through Dean’s eyes. Castiel doesn’t possess any sort of desire for interior design, so his walls are devoid of art. It’s part of why he works so well with his roommate - they both aren’t prone to “nesting”, as Sam calls it. They decorated their apartment based on necessity, not aesthetics.
“At least he didn’t give you love interests,” Sam says darkly, throwing his Kindle into the back seat, “and kill them all off for
Dean calls from inside the house, followed by his clomping footsteps down the stairs, “Who’re you calling weird, bitch?”
“Because that’s not what you want,” Cas says, his eyes narrowing. “You said civilian life isn’t for you.”
Castiel passes the blocked-off entrance to the venue and follows the line of people waiting for the concert.
Dean throws up his hands. “Great, just great,” he says as he spins on his heel and stalks towards the other end of the office, unsuccessfully trying to cool down. He turns around, meeting Novak’s gaze over the edge of his novel. “What am I supposed to do now?”
"Of course not," naked guy says quickly, his eyes wide. "It's, ah, a spell for good luck in love until the next moon. There's nothing sinister about it at all."
“Makes him into an even bigger nerd?” Dean interrupts. “Then that’s just a chance we’ll have to take.”
is etched into the leather, and dyed navy blue. At one end, after the holes for the buckle, Cas embossed two tiny cross bones.
Castiel hikes Dean closer, careful not to dislodge the pillow too much, and finally tastes Dean. He swirls his tongue, memorizing each fold of Dean’s hole. Dean’s scent is nearly overwhelming so close, and his slick is intoxicating. With each new breath through his nose, he smells Dean’s heat building.
The rest of the drive to Soho takes a little more than fifteen minutes, but by the time they pull up in front of a garage, Castiel can confidently say he knows what an eon feels like.
Cas stares him down, daring him to continue his sentence. Finally, one corner of his mouth twitches.
Dean flushes. “I’m Dr. Bi-Sexy, MD. Get it?” He pulls apart the lapels of his white coat to show off his pink shirt, purple belt, blue jeans, and, of course, cowboy boots. “You have heard of Dr. Sexy, right?”
Dean brings up the threesome again as he pays for their meal, and Cas shoots him down just as swiftly.
Her eyebrows rise, but she doesn’t comment. She just zips up her hoodie and gives him an expectant look.
Wart lets himself be pet with all the graciousness of a Winchester digging up their third grave of the night - a burden to be borne for the greater good. Wart shuffles a little in place, not entirely at ease, but without any good reason to move.
Cas stops typing and beams up at him. “I honestly don’t think she’s returning tonight. I sent her a text ten minutes ago asking about the Percival article, and she hasn’t texted back.”
He got through the whole song, and by the end, it might’ve been Dean’s magical water pressure or the power of good music, he actually felt marginally more human.
Cas sucks in a breath. “No,” he says as Dean’s heart sinks, “I suppose not.” He jerks his head towards the elevator bay. “Room service?”
Dean blinks languidly at him as Castiel adjusts the pillows, making sure Dean is comfortable. They’ll be staying like this for the next fifteen minutes, after all.
“Are you the ‘it’s complicated’?” she asks curiously, only looking away as Jack pats her knee determinedly, his face hopeful.
Amused, Cas walks over with a spoon and pries the lid off of the container. That bit of grace dexterity is beyond Jack for the moment. He dips the spoon in the mush and holds the applesauce aloft for Jack to eat.
On shaky legs, Dean makes his way back to his old seat. “I don’t know why I said that,” he says to his hands. “It’s a lot, man.”
“We were kids,” Dean admits with a sigh. “My dad was out of town, and Sam fell in with a bad crowd. He wound up literally stabbed in the back - plus a concussion. If he didn’t pull through, I had all the stuff ready for the nearest crossroads. Thank god the nurses and the docs worked their magic.”
“Oh,” Cas says quietly, staring down at the tape in his hands. “That’s… good. Hopefully somewhere nicer.”
Sure, he had some vague fantasy in his head when he was just starting out at the club that he’d find the perfect dom, and they’d pick out a collar together, but this is better. Because, at the end of the day, the only person who owns Dean is himself.
Dean calls exasperatedly from behind him, “This isn’t a porno, you don’t have to chat up the pizza guy-” He stops dead in his tracks, staring at Sam. “What the hell are you doing here?”
Benny shoots her a half-fond, half-exasperated look. “To be fair, I didn’t know you were following me.”
Castiel can’t hold back his grimace. The latte still smells awful, like a vat of candied apples boiled in coffee grounds.
“How is that more pungent than last time?” Castiel demands, nose wrinkling as he sets a now-clean muffin tin back on the shelf. It’s been a week since he met Dean Winchester, and there hasn’t been so much as a whiff of apple pie in the cafe until now. He is alone with Jo in the kitchen, since Benny’s early morning shift ends at eleven.
Castiel glances pointedly down at their conjoined groins. “It’s not like either of us is going anywhere in the next ten minutes.”
“Plus, there’s a rumor they’re gunning to get Abbadon for the main villain role, and she’s the fucking
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Dean says faintly as they don’t stop on their way down the hallway to the elevators.
But Dean doesn’t leave. He walks to the window, staring out at the lake behind the house. “The curse.”
At least she yanks Sam’s wallet just as many times. He goes apeshit when she takes his phone, so she sticks strictly to money after that.
Dean lets out a bark of laughter. He can already feel the insecurities looming on the horizon. There’s always a catch: Cas never stays; Cas might want Dean now, but he’ll fly away the moment Dean fucks up because he has no idea what he’s doing.
Like there’s anyone else around who wants to get real up close and personal with the most dumbass angel in the garrison.
Kelly had been adamant: Jack needed unfettered access to his grace. Cas tried to argue for a compromise, but she refused to budge. Jack needed his powers to save the world, so he should have them from the start. How else could he learn control?
Horror seizes Aaron. “You’re not married, are you?” he blurts. He glances down at their hands - no rings - and he would never forgive himself for missing something
Jo shrugs and pops a grape from her fruit salad in her mouth. “No idea. Just, one day, he contacts me out of the blue and says he knows all about my heists.”
Cas’s nose wrinkles, but he doesn’t comment on Dean’s hamfisted attempt at proving his acceptance of ‘alternative lifestyles’ as Dad might’ve put it charitably
Not that anyone would know Dean’s secondary gender by looking at him. Dean stands a few inches taller than the average male omega - he has nearly an inch of height on Castiel, and Castiel is the dictionary definition of standard alpha physique.
Dean runs a hand through his hair, completely at a loss. Before she can leave, he blurts, “I’m looking for a guy.”
Despite Dean’s efforts, his bedroom still is permeated with the smell of him. Castiel crosses the threshold, and like a magic switch, his cock, flagging since his disaster of a chase, stiffens. He barely spares a glance at Dean’s decor before he crowds into Dean’s personal space, capturing his mouth in another dirty kiss.
“Dammit,” Dean swears, grabbing Cas’s hand and squeezing. “I kissed you because I believe in you. I believe in us.” He meets Cas’s shocked gaze head-on. “I just didn’t know there was an us to believe in before.”
Dean leans forward, bracing his elbows on his knees. He can still see Layla’s face, shining with hope and faith. He’d been posing as some new age preacher, worming his way into her life through her mother, who checked her daily astrology horoscope, had a psychic on retainer, and once spent twelve thousand dollars on a month’s worth of sessions with a medium to contact her late husband. Layla didn’t buy into it entirely before she met Dean, but, by the end, she was a believer.
It’s like Jody wants them to surreptitiously play games on their phones and text each other when she’s looking the other way or yelling at Rowena for blowing up the Chemistry Lab again.
“What?” Jo asks, her hands on her hips. “You seem to get along with Dean. I actually didn’t know you could talk that much before I sent you back there.”
Castiel breathes through his mouth as he steps out. The overflowing dumpsters carry the odor of moldering cheese and more rancid fish, and the fryers next door are still going strong. He doesn’t find Dean lurking behind the trash, and he’s about to head back in and dump Dean’s latte down the sink when a shout makes him turn around.
Halo, though, Halo was inexcusable. Dean, in the middle of his own shower, hadn’t even realized the guy was
After a beat, Dean mutters, “Parenting blogs.” He crosses his arms over his chest, as if daring Cas to mock him although Cas would do nothing of the sort. He continues, “At first, I was only looking for a good mac and cheese recipe. But there’s such
But the real problem is that I have no idea what to say to you. I mean, what do you say when your best friend tells you out of the blue he drinks blood to survive? And that he’s over four hundred years old? This is even too wild for the pulps I read as a kid.
“You have enough connections in the community to round up a decent clientele base,” Cas continues. “Not to mention your reputation, which would go a long way towards drawing hunters you personally haven’t met before.”
Despite the dirty look Dean throws at him for the breakfast offense, Cas feels lighter than he has in months -
“I actually do,” Cas protests, the faintest stirrings of anger creeping into his words. “This isn’t the spell, Dean.”
Jo rolls her eyes from where she’s perched cross-legged on the coffee table. “He - unlike some people - can catch me in the act.” She crosses her arms over her chest. “It’s no fun if I get caught.”
Dean gets to his feet on shaky legs, very conscious of Cas’s apprehensive gaze watching him the whole time it takes him to cross his bedroom. He gets right up in Cas’s personal space, and clearly Cas has learned something because his eyes widen at Dean’s proximity.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean says, wiping at his eyes, “I thought I was going to give it all away, but turns out you’re just as obvious as you were in high school.”
Dean shrugs, sitting up on his bench so he can see Cas better. “Made you look after my moping ass when I should have told you to stay home, no pie necessary.”
“Uh yeah,” Aaron says, confused. “Castiel clearly has a huge thing for you. Not to spill the beans or anything.”
Unfortunately, the fast food restaurant next door must have taken out the trash last night, since the alley reeks of stale bread and rotting fish patties.
“The last movie I saw,” Castiel says, hesitant because Dean must know more about this than him, “my sister recommended it. It had an omega lead who led a team of paranormal investigators - a sort of horror-comedy.”
At least they’re not one species short, with Wart listening patiently from his water-filled salad bowl.
“Hey,” Dean starts, shoving his hands in his pockets. The fingers of his left hand brush against the mixtape. “I’m Dean. I live in 5J.”
Cas pulls up the driveway as the sun starts to set over the trees behind their house in North Cove, Washington. He puts the car in park, ignoring Jack’s wailing in the seat next to him
“I get it. The spotlight isn’t for everyone,” Dean smiles sardonically, disappointment and irritation wafting off him in acrid waves.
Dean taps his fingers against the windowsill. “Sammy was supposed to explain it,” he says sullenly to the window panes. “He was
Oblivious to Cas’s confusion, Dean continues, “With any other friend, any one of those things would’ve been a deal breaker. I was fucking furious, don’t get me wrong,” Dean adds. “But I was always gonna forgive you.”
He parks Jack’s stroller between two Douglas Firs and unbuckles Jack. The surface of the lake reflects the sparse sunlight filtering through the clouds and slowly dissipating fog. Behind them, a row of wild California Wax Myrtle shrubs block off most of the exits, save for the narrow footpath back to the more established trail. The nearest humans sleep three quarters of a mile away. Otherwise, there’s only birdsong from a pair of sparrows above them and the scuttling of a deer mouse in the underbrush.
He’d forgotten how Dean used to address him, back in the early days. Before they became friends, before they saved the world, before they loved each other.
Like last time, Dean is waiting, wearing a different flannel but the same jeans with the hole above the left knee. He must have left the sunglasses at home since the overcast weather would render them redundant. The clouds overhead cast the whole alley in shade.
Cas, by now accustomed to being with someone who can’t carry a conversation, keeps talking. He used to be content with the quiet. He once sat for millennia without saying a word - not much was going on during the Permian Age, anyway.
“I’ve only heard you say it to your mother and your brother on one occasion each.” He purses his lips in disapproval. “For the record, I think Lisa was being an idiot for letting you go over that. Just because you don’t feel comfortable saying the word doesn’t mean you don’t feel it.”
Castiel swirls one finger around Dean’s rim, gauging how much he can take. He smells good enough to devour whole. He dips the pad of his index finger in.
Mom practically had a heart attack when she heard about the Church thing through the grapevine, which stunned Aaron to no end because, of all his siblings, he was the only one who actually followed up on his threat to get
“If we really wanted to launch an offensive against Growing Pains, here,” Dean says loudly over Cas’s warning, “we would’ve done it.”
The man stopped, irritated. His gaze refused to linger on Dean, instead fixating on a building at the end of the block.
Cas makes do by combining the applesauce with carrots. Wart doesn’t care for it, if his look of disdain is any indication, but the mixture is sweet enough for Jack and nutrient-filled enough for Cas, so that’s what Jack is going to have for breakfast.
Cas's legs tingle with the urge to move, so he paces the length of his cell, forcing himself not to make eye-contact with Dean whenever his path means facing him.
Naked guy limits himself to a sedate swaying, as if slow dancing to a song Dean can't hear. “My apologies,” naked guy says, glancing around. “There aren’t fences, and I hadn’t realized I crossed property lines. I just moved in down the street.”
Wart comes out of his foul mood in time for dinner. In the kitchen, Cas ignores the wet plops as Wart jumps from the floor to the chair up to the table. Wart accepts a morsel of mashed carrot and watches, amused, as Cas tries to get Jack to do the same.
Cas hands Dean his coke and holds up his own sparkling water. “To us,” he says solemnly. “And your stupid plan, which actually worked.”
“Cas,” he says, his voice, strangled, as Castiel’s hands skirt over the waist of his pants to paw at his belt buckle. “Cas, man, not here.”
“Rude. Anyway, I told you to take things slow. So your first stab back at slumming it with regular folks isn’t going so great. Sometimes these things take a while to settle down,” Dean says, uncomfortably reminded of the time he had to comfort Sammy after three piano lessons didn’t turn him into the next Geoff Nicholls - or Elton John, as Dean had to amend after Sammy shot him a look of complete incomprehension.
A few framed family photos sit on top of his wardrobe and a packed bookshelf sits between the two windows that face out onto the street. Overall, it’s not much. Rather bland, actually, compared to Dean’s.
As Cas fumbles for the keys in his pocket, a prickling sensation raises the hairs at the back of his neck. He freezes, listening to the crickets chirp in the incoming twilight. Nothing about the disturbance has triggered any of his wards, so it’s more worrisome that it’s still enough to register with him at all.
Cas smiles as he bends over to retrieve the spoon, still hovering in the air above Wart. To Jack, he says, “I’m not sure Wart likes that much sweet potato.” He sets the spoon back in the bowl and gets up for a napkin to wipe Wart off. But by the time he returns, Wart has mostly cleaned himself off, his long pink tongue darting out to pick up bits of orange mush.
Cas breaks the kiss first, but Dean doesn’t go far, letting their breaths mingle and foreheads touch before settling back on his side of the counter. Cas’s mouth opens-
“Plus,” Jody says loftily, “I’ve been dating Donna for six months, and you don’t see me dragging her into supply closets, do you?” And into the stunned silence, Jody stands up to leave.
“Didn’t drink as much,” Dean says with a whimsical half-shrug. He tips back his cup and takes a long pull. “Fries can only get you halfway there, though. Christ, that’s the stuff.”
“Fuck no.” Aaron automatically recoils. There’s no way he’s touching any surface in that bathroom until it’s been scrubbed and bleached. He has some goddamn standards. He’d rather pee in the alley out back.
All the nurses at the pediatrician’s office have remarked on Jack’s maturity. According to Cas’s books, six months is not entirely unheard of for a baby to start crawling, although it is rare. The nurse who took Jack’s vitals told Cas with a wide smile that Jack was clearly gifted.
When Sam gets an email from Carver Edlund about a job, Dean dismisses it as another scam. How the hell would this Chuck guy know who they are? They’ve never been caught - not even a parking ticket.
Unspoken message received, Dean falls heavily onto the edge of his bed, half-facing away from Cas. A riot of feelings he’d rather drink away are duking it out underneath his ribcage, but, in a burst of trademark Winchester forethought, he already finished off his bedroom emergency stash. “We don’t gotta talk about it, man,” he says to his hands.
“So, uh, who’s the lucky chick?” Dean asks as he makes a beeline for the liquor cart in the library off the war room. He grabs an additional glass for Cas and the bottle of Jack, tips the bottle down his own throat to get them started, and pours them out a few fingers.
“Yes, we will see Wart soon,” Cas says. “But look at the trees!” He points. “That’s a Sitka Spruce. They’re the largest species of spruce in the world. And that’s a Western Red Cedar - it’s so sturdy, native people cut it down to make canoes and homes.”
To Cas’s chagrin, Jack takes his cues from the frog and also shuns the lima beans. Cas only convinces him to eat a couple spoonfuls before Jack’s face screws up, and he refuses another bite.
Castiel can’t smell any resentment or relief coming off Dean, only confusion. “We didn’t really talk about it,” he says, meeting Dean’s gaze squarely. “Whenever I pictured myself mating someone, it was after a significant period of courtship.”
They don’t know each other, not really. Dean probably attended the same university Castiel teaches at, judging from the charm hanging from Dean’s keychain and a pair of socks bearing the university crest. Dean mentioned he works in construction and that he has a younger brother, but those are the only concrete facts Castiel knows for sure.
“Who the hell are you supposed to be, Captain Rainbow Pants?” Dean calls, still laughing as Cas gets within earshot.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the sliver of air vent visible above the edge of his shower curtain. Showerus Interruptus had to be communicating through it. “You seriously don’t know House of the Rising Sun? It’s a classic!”
When he proposed the objectionably insane (and suicidal, if you asked Cas) plan to set up their jackass bosses to get them off Dean and Cas’s respective backs, Cas had laughed him out of their shared elevator.
He could head to his car, just go and find the closest bar to bide his time, but maybe he can snag another free room instead. In the main office, he slams the key down on the desk, making Novak jump. “I need a different room,” Dean growls.
“Wait, what?” Dean lifts his head to get a better look at Novak. “Was it from Colorado or Michigan or something?”
“What, like Tibetan throat-singing?” Dean interrupts. At Castiel’s stare, he explains quickly, “Sammy had a phase.”
Once everyone with an appetite has eaten, Cas picks up Jack in one arm and Wart in his water bowl in the other, and brings them all to the living room. He puts on an innocuous children’s show about an intrepid Hispanic explorer.
Castiel groans as his cock drags against the hard planes of Dean’s abdomen. His knot feels full to bursting, and Dean isn’t helping - making so many delicious sounds beneath him.
“Please tell me this isn’t a Memento situation happening,” Dean groans, stopping dead in his tracks. He stares at all the black text scrawled across Cas’s naked torso, vibrant against his pale skin under the bright lights of the bathroom. Cas still has his pants on, but his fly is unzipped.
Cas’s hair is a bird’s nest of bedhead that would probably drop Daphne’s panties in a heartbeat. Dean’s cheeks are flushed, and Aaron definitely recognizes his immediate post-orgasm face.
Cas has never understood the “butterflies in the stomach” idiom before, but it’s the only way he can describe the fluttery, jittery feeling growing stronger with every new touch and shared breath. It’s exhilarating and terrifying all at once.
Rowena reaches behind the bowl and pinches a stoppered vial between her thumb and forefinger. She shakes it enticingly in Cas’s direction. “Bottoms up, dove.”
Dean snorts. “I figured.” He hitches a smile on his face, but Cas can see the nerves clear as day behind his eyes. “So, how about it?”
Charlie see-saws her hand back and forth as they take their seats. “About half,” she says, glancing behind them to where Dean and Castiel are attempting to make themselves presentable. “Turns out, they’re really bad at keeping the whole ‘Destiel’ thing under wraps. It’s adorable they thought they could try.”
“I thought,” Showerus said, for the first time sounding a little sheepish, “these past few days, you seemed off. Stressed, maybe? I wasn’t sure. You sounded different.”
I know you said you preferred phone calls, but call me old fashioned - you would not be the first to say so - I’ve always felt I could best express myself through writing. So please forgive me for taking up your time in a less than ideal manner.
The week after, Bobby’s garage received a gift certificate in the mail. It was for a weeklong stay at the Chicago location of the five-star hotel chain Cas works for, in Dean’s name.
“I was just gonna say,” Aaron supplies quickly, “do I still think he’s hot? Yes, I have eyes. Do I want to marry him and push my mother over the edge by marrying a guy
Sarcasm may fly over Cas’s head, but he understands irony. Wart doesn’t actually have any warts, so it’s a very funny choice.
Dean huffs an irritated breath, his heart beating erratically in his chest at the look in Cas’s eye. “Go on,” he says through gritted teeth. “Take it.”
Dean’s face falls carefully blank. “If you’re good here, fine. We won’t bug you - except maybe to text every once in a while to make sure you’re not dead.” He laughs humorlessly. “Like you told Jack, I can’t force you to come with us. No better way to send you running for the hills.”
these letters wax poetic about Cas? That’s a lot of people that have thought about his angel naked. And that doesn’t sit right with Dean. “Why?” he demands.
Dean ducks his head. “Yeah, you did,” he mutters. He glances around, clearly trying to change the subject. “So this is your place.”
Castiel can’t help his noise of disgust. At Dean’s sharp look, he says aloud, “She’s probably worried nobody will come back if they try it.”
“Dean,” Cas growls. “I am not like any of your exes. You can’t push me away and then blame yourself for the inevitable fallout.”
“If anything comes up, just text me,” Dean says quickly. “I’m hanging - no, we’re not gonna run out of towels. The linens got delivered this morning like they always do. Was that a hypothetical question or a real question?” He shoots a pleading look at Cas.
Before he can make up his mind, James is walking towards him. “Hello,” he says. “I wasn’t expecting to run into you here.”
Dean rubs the back of his neck. He coughs. “Anyway,” he says, “Yes, we’re dating. No, it’s not really that complicated. Cas just doesn’t like to talk about it at work.”
Cas looks up from another letter and tilts his head, squinting at his rendering. “My wings aren’t rainbow colored. They’re actually from a palette not perceptible by human eyes - possibly by some genetically mutant shrimp -”
He almost told Showerus about his upcoming move. Would Showerus miss him? It almost sounded like it. Or maybe, if Dean opened his big fat mouth, Showerus would just laugh and tell him thank god he was getting his shower time back. His uninterrupted shower time when he didn’t have to think about anyone else or anyone else’s problems - because he clearly did.
Why Cas couldn’t just look up a local place still baffles Dean to this day, but he has never been more grateful for Cas’s weird-ass logic.
They reach the seminar room, and Dean and Cas take their pair of seats by the window. Cas immediately takes out his laptop and plugs in his charger.
They leave, heads already bent together to hear each other over the dull roar of the party. “They seem close,” Aaron says, jerking his head.
Cas can’t pinpoint exactly when, but silence has come to mean strained, awkward relationships and pregnant pauses before being asked to leave. No, he much prefers idle chatter and background noise to oppressive, foreboding silence - even if he has to provide it.
Castiel freezes and sends up a silent prayer of thanks for the apron covering his lower half over his pants. “It’s good?” he tries, but it's futile. Dean is clearly beyond speech.
Cas meets all of their gazes in turn. “I was thinking more along the lines of stealing from their more soulless clients and forcing Mountaintop to pay out millions in insurance claims.”
Stiffly, Dean shakes his head again. “I haven’t met him. Not really. We - we communicate in the shower -
“What’s happening?” Cas asks, his impatient voice coming from the earbud jammed in Dean’s right ear. “Naomi got into the elevator five minutes ago. Is she there yet?”
Dean nudges him with his elbow, saying in an undertone, “C’mon, like it wouldn’t be the first time.”
Cas shrugs as he gently takes it from Dean’s hands. “It’s entertaining enough, but I am frustrated with the protagonist. I believe the author is setting her up for a one-that-got-away situation. Of course, with a romance, they will meet up again years down the line, once Emmanuelle does some more personal growth, and have their happy ending.”
“Tribute bands offer a fascinating definition of the nature of performance, the difference between authenticity and identity,” Castiel says, already on the defensive. He can already hear his voice trying to fall into his usual academic patterns, and tries to rein himself in, “and historical consciousness in popular music. Here -” He pulls out his phone.
Castiel turns bright red. He can’t bring himself to respond to that offer, so he changes the subject.
Cas keeps talking, thank God. “You don’t acknowledge that side of you very often, but I feel it every time we see each other, every time you’re with your brother. You care, you love, so wholly and completely.” Cas chuckles ruefully. “I didn’t realize it for a few years. I didn’t see how unique it was, how special you are, but you are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know.”
Dean lets out a silent exhale of relief. He musters up a weak smile. “No problem, man. I’ll leave you to it.” As he turns back around, James steps up to the hostess stand.
Sam sighs. “The last time Charlie was here, we hacked Flying Wiccan Press - Chuck’s old publisher - and we redirected his mail and royalty checks to a local PO box. I figured if anyone deserves money off those books after what he did, it’s us.”
Aaron rolls his eyes at the nickname. “I’m good,” he says, holding up his three-quarters full glass.
Pleased, Jody strides out of the Teachers Lounge, nearly running into Donna. “Here,” she says, pressing the coffee into her hands. “I put too much sugar in it anyway.”
But before Dean replies, the room buzzes. The bars slide back with a loud clang, and a crackly voice sounds over the speakers,
“So?” Cas doesn’t point out that his last relationship ended three years ago. After reading an idiotic article in Cosmo at his dentist’s office, he made up romantic interests in a futile effort to make Dean jealous. But Dean was happy for him; he even helped him plan a date or two. To pay Cas back for everything he’d done for him, Dean said.
“Hopefully not, if Sam did his job right.” Dean crosses his arms over his chest, gaze darting all over the room. Except at Cas.
As Aaron launches into the latest installment of their favorite will-they won’t-they senior couple, Kelly can finally appreciate the lazy smile Castiel wears as he settles in to listen. Maybe Aaron was right, and she and Daphne came on a little strong.
“My favorite all-omega tribute band, though, is Omega You Eight One Two,” Castiel muses, “a Van Halen cover band.”
“It only dug deeper into you.” Dean exhales, a complicated mixture of embarrassment, rage, and dread settling heavily in the pit of his stomach.
Dean maintains that it’s genuine from growing up in Kansas, but Castiel is a linguist specializing in the decline of regional dialects in the United States, so he knows better.
The door opens before he’s ready, revealing a tall, dark-haired man with serious eyes. “Can I help you?” he asks, and Dean recognizes his voice even without all the weird echoes and vent-distortions.
Wart barely tastes the green mush before he makes a noise of absolute disgust, flicking his tongue in and out, and even trying to wipe it on the table.
“Look, you don’t have to,” Dean says awkwardly. “You could use my soul, I guess, but if you give up your grace, you’ll never come back here again.”
Talk about a recipe for disaster: Cas plus normal person equals uncomfortable questions and fucked up babysitting gigs.
Cas surfaces, looking almost smite-y around the eyes. He crowds Dean up against the bed until the backs of his knees hit the mattress. “Lay down,” he orders quietly.
“It’s not a bad thing,” Dean adds, “definitely has its uses. Just something for the newbie to know, right, Cas?”
Over the deafening silence, Castiel says, “I assume Chuck eliminated whatever communication you had been using as soon as I accused him of betrayal.”
It’s no trouble at all for Dean to lean the rest of the way across the counter and press their lips together. Cas’s breath hitches, but Dean can feel him smiling against his mouth. He reaches up to cup Cas’s jaw, pressing the pads of his fingers against the soft skin behind his ear, relishing in the rub of day-old stubble against his palm.
“That milestone?” Sam says, his face an odd mix of smug and constipated. “There are a hundred thousand
Cas wears an unfathomable expression on his face. Part wistful, part stoic, part something Dean has no chance of ever describing.
Wart will require frequent mistings not to dry out. Cas is sure he has at least one spray bottle around, albeit full of Windex. He turns to Wart, eyeing the frog critically, and reaches out to tentatively stroke a finger down Wart’s back.
Dean can practically feel the power thrumming underneath the trench coat sleeve in his grip, but Cas wordlessly lets Dean guide him back to the library table.
“Yeah, I put that one together for myself, thanks,” Dean grumbles as Jo slides into the booth next to him.
The corners of Cas’s mouth turn down into a slight grimace. “Last night, a client treated us to tapas. I woke up starving.”
“You’re right - I guess we didn’t really talk.” He swallows, shifting an inch away from Castiel - all that their coupling allows. His rim tugs at Castiel’s swollen knot. It’s definitely more painful than pleasurable.
But, before you exit my life permanently, I want you to know these past four years have been the best part of my life. The things we’ve shared together, they have changed me. I will always remember you.
Dean picks up a large flat envelope and rips it open. “What the…?” he murmurs. He slides out a matte illustration of the Impala driving down a nameless highway, golden wheat fields bracketing both sides of the road, a fading sunset illuminating the horizon. His mouth falls open.
With one final look at his home for the past seven months, at the resting place for Kelly’s ashes, Cas gets in the Impala. Before Dean can start the engine, Cas lays a hand on top of his. As Dean turns his head, a questioning look on his face, Cas kisses him.
“My boss needs a room in the top five floors of your hotel. It can’t face the parking lot. You got that?”
You’re such a girl. Didn’t I write in my last letter, I just needed a little time? You’re so dramatic sometimes. My return address is on the envelope, so don’t be a stranger. Write me. I want to hear all about the Titanic. Don’t think I missed that little detail.
Dean exhales a slow, belabored sigh as he strokes a broad hand down Jack’s back. “He obviously doesn’t have you brainwashed like we thought you might be.”
“Look,” Sam says, the first inklings of impatience in his voice, “Have you considered just… going to bed and ignoring him?”
“My roommate and I order from them frequently,” Castiel says, smiling. “Go ahead. Would you want pepperoni?”
“Right,” Dean says, eyeing the secret measurer, which has gone haywire. The top bit is spinning like the secret lovechild of a fork and a windmill. He jumps to his feet. “Looks like the spell’s broken, so I’m going to-”
“Yeah, and telling Sam to book it to Washington without a voice or opposable thumbs was no picnic,” Dean says darkly. “The idiot spent three days insisting he could break it himself even though I
Dean shrugs. “We weren’t a hundred percent sure if he was evil, and killing babies generally isn’t in the good guy code.”
Dean shrugs, but his eyes glimmer with anticipation. “It’s a World War II biopic about an omega who sneaks into the army, disguises himself as an alpha, and rescues a unit trapped behind enemy lines.” He taps his fingers against the side of his half-empty cup. “A little on the nose, but the script is good.”
“Something’s up,” Sam announces as Dean returns carrying takeout. “The place is owned by Gabriel L. Laufeyson.”
“Oh.” Dean picks up his empty whiskey glass. He runs a hand down his face, trying to scrub away whatever he’s feeling. It doesn't work. “I don’t know about you, but I could use a drink. Fucking witches.”
Castiel glances back at his mostly-closed door before turning back around. “Yes?” He glowers at Sam. “You said you would be occupied all day!”
“Hey,” Dean asks as he slides in between the freshly-made bed, “does this mean I finally get free coffee?”
Cas’s responding grin falls as the doors close behind them and the elevator starts moving. He shakes his head. “It’s a shame there are cameras in here.”
Cas sighs. “I told you my feelings ran deeper than a simple love spell. I told you, I’ve admired you, cared about you, loved you since before we ever ran into that witch.”
Conflicted, Dean glances at Rowena, whose hands are raised to blast the Empty with purple fire. “We can hold it off, dearie,” she calls. “Do the spell!” She lets out a hair-raising shriek in some ancient language, and the heat makes Dean flinch back even from across the cavernous room. “The blood first,” Rowena instructs in a carrying voice. She circles the Empty with Sam, keeping it occupied. “Jack’s, then mine.
“Alright, well, I’ll let you deal with Joanna Beth on your own,” Dean says as he pulls out his wallet and hands Castiel a folded bill. He gives a mocking salute as he takes a step back. “Good luck, dude.”
Dean twitches aside the curtain, doing a quick spot check to see if the coast is clear. Bingo. The naked dude was back to prancing around, his bare ass flashing Dean under the impossibly bright full moon overhead.
Sam shrugs. “They’re very compelling, apparently. I’ve been checking it every very few months, but two days ago I got a call saying they were running out of space.”
Chuck has no idea what his old Hacker and Thief are doing, probably back on the con. Raphael and Lucifer never worked well with others.
Ten minutes later, Dean hangs up, his order completed, but the odd, squirmy feeling in his gut isn’t going away. With zero ideas what to do about that, Dean gets up and makes himself a sandwich.
“Probably,” Dean agrees. He taps his fingers against the sides of the cup as he asks, “So you’re in school? For what?”
Dean slurps at his fruity latte before he answers. “Got a meeting at nine. This,” he says, brandishing his mostly empty cup, “and a large fries are the cure.” With both his hands occupied, Dean ducks his head to fish a single fry out using his mouth, holding it like a cigarette between his lips.
Cas flies them to the home of a time-travelling witch intent on taking over where Tracy Davis left off. They search the premises thoroughly but don’t find any sign of her. They must have missed her by minutes; Dean pops open her microwave and sniffs at her still-steaming Chinese leftovers. At one quelling look from Cas, Dean reluctantly leaves the carton on the carton on the counter and resumes their search, this time for clues as to her new whereabouts. Cas collects her grimoire and notes while Dean goes for her laptop, and they return the way they came.
Eyes widening with understanding, his soulmate quickly tugged up the cuff of his sleeve, only sparing a second to verify his own timer stopped. “I’m sorry, I didn’t even notice.” he said, distracted. “My name is James. Here,” he fished out a pen and something to write on from various pockets of his trench coat, “my number. We… should talk. Later.” He scowled, raising his other wrist to check at his watch. “I need to go.”
Cas takes his drink, jaw clenching. He doesn’t look like a dude head over heels. He looks like his normal sleep-deprived, tax accountant self. He stays silent.
“It’ll be too strong,” Castiel protests even as he shakes more powder in and gives it a stir. He hands it back to Jo for evaluation.
Dean’s a professional so he doesn’t tell Castiel to shove his additional questions up his ass. Instead he pastes on a charming smile and sits back down. Castiel had been giving him eyes throughout the presentation, and Dean's been around this rodeo a time or two. “Of course.”
“You need vitamin D for healthy growth,” Cas reminds him, “and research has shown that greenery improves productivity and mood more than man-made, unadorned walls.” He smiles slightly to himself. “Not that you need to be worried about productivity yet. That can come in your own time. Right now, the most important thing is that you are happy and adequately stimulated.”
Dean keeps thumbing through the book, more for an excuse to stay close to Cas rather than any interest in the romance. “Is this any good?”
Kelly grins. “But if I can’t spread it around, Daphne’s still going to go after him like he’s a prize heifer at a state fair.”
Before they can start a scene, Castiel reaches for Dean’s hand. “Is it imperative that you see this concert? Right now?”
“I think so too.” Cas frowns at his reflection. “Do you mind if I keep getting undressed? I’d like to shower before going to bed.”
Cas stands stock still before he tentatively kisses back, so tenderly, Dean almost doesn’t notice. But Cas breaks away first, his expression carefully blank. “You didn’t have to do that.”
My new place is alright. Smaller than my apartment in Chicago, but I don’t spend much time in it anyway.
Head swimming with too many thoughts to name, Dean couldn’t get the right words out. He gestured mutely to his wrist, pulling up the flannel to show him.
Castiel tilts his head, studying both brothers thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t mind watching the Lord of the Rings and eating pizza with Sam.”
Moreover, it’s not like Aaron's never leaned on the girls for help. Daphne called her second-cousin, the cardiologist, to give a third-opinion on Dad's diagnosis. Kelly let Aaron sleep on her couch for a month because she lived across the street from the hospital. They listened to him whine about his unrequited
Dean snorts. “I see why Naomi hired a Harvard grad as her assistant. You have such a knack for spotting things other people don’t, Sherlock. Has anyone told you that before?”
“Can’t you take it?” Castiel asks, his tone verging on pleading, as Jo follows him back into the kitchen. It’s too early in the morning for another meeting, closer to the first time Castiel met Dean at seven am, compared to their last meeting at a little before eleven.
“This is such a mistake,” Dean mutters as he waits for the call to go through. Silently, he curses Cas for being such a technophobe. If Cas had a goddamn Etsy store, Dean wouldn’t be in this situation. But no, Dean has to call every time to place an order because Cas’s Geocities-era website is shit.
“You don’t?” Dean looks away, his frown deepening. “Forget it - you don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Castiel throws him a look. “I’m in academia, Dean. Tenure is hardly a guarantee. Even so, there isn’t a wealth of money out there for ethnomusicology grants.”
coffee Dean is currently drinking like his life depends on it. Dean might smell like old gym socks for all Castiel can tell.
Five years and three months, but Cas absolutely cannot say that to Dean. He will undoubtedly see it as weird and creepy that Cas keeps track, but Cas can’t help his mental tally from the day that changed his life.
“Why?” Daphne asks, stepping closer. She frowns as Kelly and Aaron automatically stand shoulder-to-shoulder, blocking her view of the narrow window.
“I didn’t expect anything when I told you about my feelings for you,” Cas says, a tremor of emotion in his words. “If you kissed me out of pity or because of obligation-”
“How do you know?” Cas asks, twisting around to catch a glimpse of his son, sleeping peacefully in his car seat.
Wart, though, he gives a little hopeful croak from where he’s perched on one of the posts of Jack’s crib. He leaps down and settles beside Jack, within reach. Watching over him.
Dean groans. “Look, I didn’t think angels could have feelings like that.” He runs a hand through his hair. “Or I would’ve… done something about it sooner,” he says, and that’s mostly true. Probably would’ve tried to seduce Cas, failed, and then jumped off a cliff, but Cas doesn’t need to know that.
Dean first contacted Cas after getting his third rash from the generic collars they keep on hand at the club. Apparently he is allergic to whatever they use to treat the leather. Lucky him. He bought the most basic model Cas listed.
Cas had just come back from a witch hunt - his first solo job. Dean was stuck manning the phones for the weekend, and Sam was off on a vacation (Christ, Dean still can’t wrap his head around the fact that they
Cas’s eyebrows shoot towards his hairline. For the first time today, he looks almost afraid. “Then why are you here?” he asks, his gaze darting towards the stairs to the exit. “I’m only going to stay in the Bunker until Rowena can finish. Then I will go.”
Dean’s stomach fills with lead. A secret pops to mind, one that would probably blow Cas’s stupid secret measurer out of the water. He clears his throat as Cas’s head whips around to stare at him. But under his scrutiny, Dean chickens out. “You first,” he mutters.
James’s handwriting is neat, so Dean doesn’t even have the excuse of not being able to read a digit or two.
Dean paces to the other end of the bookshelf, unbelievably annoyed at Cas for making him spell it out for him. “Forget it,” Dean says instead. “I still owe you for ganking Billie-”
and doesn’t seek to murder his son. Cas helped him, he saved Dean from life as an amphibian, in a way he hasn’t been able to do in so long. It’s a win for sure - for both of them. So why is Dean acting like the next threat is just around the corner?
Castiel has never been one to lean into his alpha instincts. Possessiveness, aggression, arrogance - Castiel has had his (mostly regrettable) moments, but they hardly define his character. Yet, over these past few weeks, he’s had to repeatedly tell himself that he can’t solve Dean’s problems. Dean is a wildly successful adult with millions of fans, while Castiel can’t even handle Hunter Cafe’s front counter during the morning rush.
“No offense taken,” Castiel says easily. “With my lifestyle, posturing is a waste of time. I long ago resigned myself to not being the primary breadwinner in any future household.”
He can’t look at it any longer. He shoves it in his pocket, and the receipt with his soulmate’s phone number crinkles in protest. With a sigh, Dean takes out the flimsy piece of paper.
“It was before I knew you were my soulmate,” Cas says quickly. “I’ve never felt like I fit in in California, and my parents live in Pontiac. The Chicago office is decently large, and, well, I knew you were here,” he says, his voice going quiet near the end. He straightens. “So there were many reasons.”
“If I was going to put my psych degree to good use,” Daphne adds, “I would read into his lack of father figure. Their mom’s great, but Max doesn’t have a lot of male role models in his life.”
The dude was attractive, at least, and the first thing he did after bumping into Dean was apologize. But he was wearing a tailored suit and glued to his phone, so it definitely could have been better.
“Fantastic,” Cas says, and Dean can hear the loud whirr of Cas’s heavy-duty sewing machine in the background. “So what can I do for you this time, Dean?”
“He’ll be fine,” Dean says from behind him. “He’s half-archangel. Practically indestructible. Ain’t that right, bud?”
“You don’t have to throw yourself into anything,” Dean adds gently to Cas. “We’ve got no big bad waiting out in the wings. It’s okay to take things one step at a time.”
Dean flips the receipt over, and his stomach gives a sickening lurch. In pretentious curlicue lettering, the first words Dean reads are,
“Do you know what I really saw when Jack showed me the future he could bring?” he asks rhetorically. “I saw visions of everyone I loved at peace. Kelly, Sam, Dean.” He runs a hand down his face, his breathing coming unevenly. “Dean was so
“How can you possibly know that?” Cas says, pained and impressed. So young, and already so jaded. “We’ve met on four occasions by this point.”
Castiel steels himself. “And, in my opinion, for what it’s worth, not looking like a typical omega isn’t a bad thing.”
“No, no,” Dean waves his suggestion away, “We’ve done the research. You scoped her out with your mojo. We know where the other bitch is hiding. Plus, now I can buy some stocks in Facebook or something.”
“What?” he demands. “What do you want now? ’Cause I can’t think of a single thing you need from me, Cas.”
“Naked time, apparently,” Dean says, scowling, as he peers around his living room curtains at his nondescript yard facing the woods at the edge of town.
Cas looks away from Dean for the first time, and Dean dies a little inside. Stiffy, Cas says, “If this is some misguided attempt to show your sympathy for my situation. I don’t appreciate the gesture.”
So he talks to a frog. He tells him about Jack’s birth; about Kelly’s strong personality and stabilizing presence; about the repairs he still has to do on this house he rented at a discount because it’s mostly falling apart.
And, yeah, Sam's burrito farts are a goddamn biohazard, but if Dean's learned anything from sharing a bedroom with his witchy little brother, it's not to trust stereotypes.
Christ, Dean has no idea what he’s doing. He should be with Sam and Rowena, on the frontlines, not cowering behind a table with a spellbook that looks like it was made from
“Chuck never printed or emailed anything with your names or likenesses on the company premises,” Cas explains.
Dean sips his whiskey and glowers across the bar at his own reflection. His wrist is burning like a brand, but it’s probably all in his head. The stupid timers don’t cause physical pain when they reach T-minus zero, Houston we have a problem. The numbers freeze, and that’s that.
This close, Dean doesn’t miss the purple and crimson dye smudged around the hairline of Cas’s forehead or the flush to his cheeks that doesn’t seem entirely due to the booze.
“What you want?” Dean says, glaring daggers at the tabletop between them, “That whole, mind, body, soul crap? You got it.”
“Jesus,” Dean mutters, “This isn’t - it’s never been - about you being goddamn useful.” He huffs an exasperated breath, frowning harder as Cas doesn’t immediately get it and launch himself at Dean.
Dean slams the whiskey bottle down on his desk, cursing as it nearly topples over in his haste. He sets it right, swearing more as precious seconds pass by. He hurtles down the hall, half-convinced Cas lied to him to get a head start and is really halfway to Timbuktu.
“Love spell,” Rowena proclaims as she glides down the stairs to the Bunker floor like it’s her personal ballroom. Her midnight blue floor-length gown and elaborately curled hair look especially out of place - Dean’s pretty sure his shirt has pizza stains from at least three different pizzas. But the shirt is red, so at least two of them don’t count.
“With what money or identity?” Cas says wryly as Dean leads them onto a side street where nobody will notice them disappear.
Dean takes a long pull from his cup. “I don’t want to hammer the omega thing home too hard, alright?”
It’s 7:00 am, and if Jody has to hear one more word about Castiel Novak and his brooding stare and baby blue eyes, she’s going to dump her coffee all over Daphne Allen’s head. It’s not like the Teachers Lounge hasn’t seen more than its fair share of spilled coffee. The brown-ish grey-ish carpet is more for utility than aesthetics, and is probably older than Jody herself.
Dean complies, blushing furiously. He stares up at Cas, shirtless, belt buckle undone, pants unzipped. He can make out the slight bulge of Cas’s hard cock underneath the dark fabric.
“I - yeah,” Dean says, awed. He inhales a deep breath, a wide grin spreading across his face. “You smell like my latte.”
“No, wait, I ordered,” Dean protests as he stumbles out of bed and glances around for his clothes. “I should get it.”
“I could have warned you,” Novak says, sounding farther away, and Dean figures he must have resumed his spot behind the desk.
“We usually flew back to Heaven,” Cas assures him. “I, as you know, also spent some time at a local playground across from the church.”
He refuses to look at the far corner of the room, the booth he had reserved like an idiot. Four PM, party of two, under the name Winchester.
“Goddammit,” Sam swears, nose wrinkling and mouth turning down in a frown. “I was waiting for the right time, but I guess it’s too late to introduce you to my brother…” he drifts off, his eyes going wide as his gaze catches over Castiel’s shoulder, “… who’s already here.”
Castiel just watches him, revelling in the sight and sound of Dean in his bed - in a wholly different manner than he was doing twenty minutes ago.
“First, she made some poor lady mute,” Dean continues, “and Lonely Hearts disappeared three days later. We asked her best friend, and he said she turned into seafoam. And we thought, he’s just a wacko, right? Clearly, the guy spent too much time huffing paint cans on the beach. But the next thing we know, the sheriff’s office calls us with a weird murder of a guy the shooter swore was some sort of monster - horns, fangs, paws, the whole nine yards.”
Dean’s eyebrows shoot upwards. “Right…” he says, clearly not believing a word. “So what are you doing here, then?”
Castiel sighs, and tries to concentrate on breathing in as much of Dean’s scent as his lung capacity allows.
“Hey, whaddya call five weeks of lattes?” Dean retorts, but there’s no anger in his voice, and his scent remains resentment-free.
Dean steps out of his pants, frowning as he takes in Cas, still bundled up to the neck in suit and coat. “Looks like you’re overdressed, angel.”
“Can we make it fifteen?” Aaron asks desperately, shuffling to the side so he better blocks the way in.
“Go!” Sam waves Dean off with one hand as he brandishes an angel blade in the other, not that it’ll do much good against a primordial entity.
“You’re welcome,” Dean says automatically. He licks his lips. “Look, I couldn’t just take off without ever meeting you, so…” he drifts off, not really sure where he is going with that sentence. “Yeah.”
Dean eyes Cas’s face warily, and whatever he sees prompts him to say, “I was cursed. I thought - I’d hoped - you could break it.” And he
Cas watches him curiously. None of what Dean’s said so far warrants the agitation he’d been showing since the curse he supposedly broke. Eventually, he asks plainly, “Dean, how did I break the spell on you?”
Dean waggles the near-empty cup in front of Castiel’s face in what might be an enticing manner to someone with no sense of smell. Or taste. “Wanna try?”
Dean tilts back on his heels, trying to ignore the disappointment and embarrassment flooding his veins. This is fine. Setbacks are all part of the game. Onto the next apartment.
“Or else I would have forgotten my way back here. And who you are. And a hundred million other things.”
“Thank god,” Dean says, slinging an arm over Castiel’s chest as he buries his face in the crook of his neck. “I can finally tell my brother to fuck off.”
Cas raises head, his eyes unbearably bleak. “Why not me? I was the one who set the Leviathans and angels loose on humanity to wage their wars, among a dozen other transgressions.” He adds morosely, “Sometimes I wonder if it would have been better if a different angel rescued you from Hell after all.”
Weirdly enough, the man smiles at his reaction. “Castiel.” He gestures to Bones. “I was just admiring my work on its true recipient.” His smile turns distinctly wry. “It’s not often I get to see my collars out in public.”
Ego the size of a monster truck and walks around like she’s God’s gift to omegas everywhere,” Dean scoffs. “Typical.”
“You can always ask Jody about forming a new one in January,” Aaron says. “Honestly, the hardest part’ll be finding a time to meet. Don’t go for afterschool Thursdays, or Benny will kick your ass.”
“At five this morning, the wife of a guest drove down to demand that we give up the room where her husband was holed up with his mistress before she burned the building to the ground.”
up to something. Why tattle on him? Don’t you want me and my brother in the slammer? Get some retribution for Mountaintop?”
Novak huffs a small laugh. “Napa Valley, actually. The important part was that it was from America at all - Mother has strong opinions about wine that doesn’t originate in France or Italy.”
“It’s only a scent bond for now,” Dean says apologetically, “a strong one, obviously - but not unbreakable.”
Beautiful because of all the wear and tear and not despite of it. Because the damage tells the story of Dean’s strength, his ability to take the hits and keep going, when lesser men have fallen. His Father’s greatest creation in all of time and space. The only soul in the universe to make an angel fall from grace and rise again, higher than before.
“Kelly Kline - Lucifer, again - the British Men of Letters - take your pick,” Castiel retorts heatedly.
To Cas’s relief, he doesn’t read about any dead bodies with their eyes burned out or demonic omens. As he scans the obituaries and funeral notices, his gaze catches on an entry from Tillamook, Oregon. There will be a memorial for Amanda Fitzmartin tomorrow, three weeks after her death.
As the rainy weather persists into the late afternoon, Cas occupies Jack by reading him a story. They finished
Castiel watches Dean polish off his fries at a truly impressive and horrifying speed. He has to ask, “Why was Jo at your game night?”
Dean nearly busted his hip on the tile from a little too forceful shaking, and he wound up not being able to finish the last chorus, almost doubled up with laughter.
Cas frowns at him but pours out another cup anyway. He places a finger on the edge of Dean’s untouched plate. “Do you not want it?” Castiel asks, eyebrows rising. “Because I haven’t taken
Castiel shakes his head. “They’re completely sincere, I assure you.” He smiles wryly. “I interviewed Misstallica for a paper I’m writing on, for lack of a better word,
Wart gives a little shiver, but doesn’t leap away. His skin doesn’t feel especially moist, so Cas quickly gathers him up into his cupped hands and carries him back down to the kitchen. He fills their largest bowl with water and drops Wart in.
“I followed the money. It’s my area of expertise,” Castiel says succinctly. “Look, do you want to be double-crossed or not? Because if you were sent here to distract Amara, the rest of your crew is probably committing some sort of crime as we speak.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, valiantly resisting the urge to look behind him to check that his Dean is still out of sight.
"Awesome, now that we've got that out of the way," Dean says with a light grin, "d'you want to grab a drink back at my place once you're done here?"
“You misunderstand me,” Cas says, pressing a swift kiss to Dean’s mouth. “I wouldn’t leave your erections up to chance.”
Giggling, Jack cocks his head this way and that, trying to see Wart, but Wart is stuck firm. As Jack’s laughter subsides, Wart takes off, and the game starts again.
Dean shrugs. “How do witches do anything? They’re all so skeezy. I try not to think about it.” He gives an exaggerated shudder. “She went for me first ’cause I’m the good-looking one. I don’t know what happened right after since I was little busy
“I thought you weren’t pursuing projects like that anymore,” Castiel says carefully, trying to keep the judgement out of his voice.
Cas is their third wheel, the stabilizer that keeps Team Free Will upright and moving forward. Without him, they’re a tandem bicycle, and nobody wants a repeat of that opening scene from Gabriel’s sitcom from Hell.
“Yeah, I’m just a jackass who can’t get a lady to stick around for more than a few hours. I get it.” He glances up to see Cas’s stricken expression. Frowning, Dean looks away.
Dean laughs, and Cas flinches. “Look,” he says before Cas can run away or hit him for reacting like a dick, “Do you want to head back to my place and talk? I live a few blocks from here.”
Dean nods twice, his movement jerky. He averts his gaze for the first time since he turned back into a biped, and all of Cas’s warning bells go off at once.
“You love me?” Cas asks cautiously. He can’t leave this up to tacit interpretation, not with so much on the line.
Dean wastes no time in downing half his new drink. Throat burning in warning, he forces out, “Why - why can’t you? You’re a freaking angel - thought you could have anyone.” Dean frowns. “He’s not a civilian, is he?”
Cas meets his gaze squarely. “I love you, Dean. No spell is making me say it; it’s just me.” He inhales a swift breath. “But if you’ve changed your mind, if I’m not -” he pauses infinitesimally before soldiering on, “not what you want, you should tell me now. Before any more mistakes are made.”
Castiel has thought about asking Dean for more. Maybe a meal before they fall into bed together. If he was feeling especially daring, dinner and a movie.
“You can move,” Dean says, eyebrows rising as Castiel hovers above him, panting through the nearly-overwhelming sensation of finally being inside him. “I’m not some breakable omega, you know.” Dean shifts irritatedly, his inner walls squeezing Castiel anew.
Dean actually dreamed about that burger, a few months after his Cas-sponsored stay. When he told Cas about it, Cas let out a bark of laughter.
Castiel can smell the exact moment that Dean puts it together. Dean’s scent rushes, hot and strong, between them, and Castiel’s teeth itch with the urge to sink into Dean’s mating gland on his neck.
Castiel slowly shakes his head as Dean leans on him for support, gasping for air. “Oh my god, Cas, that’s fucking embarrassing. D’you have a
Dean snorts. “Of course you don’t because I’m a jackass who can’t just come out and say it, which is stupid. Telling you won’t change anything.”
Standing stock-still, Dean’s fingers clench around Castiel’s in a death grip. “Cas,” he growls, “move.”
What a cutie. Kelly grins as she leans in over the table. “You want to know which students are the worst?”
They linger awkwardly until Aaron speaks. He eyes the pair of them, his gaze ping-ponging back and forth. “So… you two are finally together?”
“Yup, that’s the one,” Daphne says, nodding to Krissy Chambers and her friend Josephine as they pass by. “It underwent a little bit of a makeover when Garth and Bess took over.”
To his surprise, instead of demanding Jo bring him his coffee from now on, Dean laughs. “Not a fan of apple pie?”
“It translates to washer bears,” Cas says, “because they always try to wash their food before they eat it.”
Dean frowns. “When you touched that kid’s soul in that hotel room, it didn’t go all Fukushima on us.”
Castiel draws a rudimentary apple on top of Dean’s latte, and if it looks more like a misshapen mango, nobody will see it but Dean.
“That’s a nice way of putting it,” Aaron says, since Daphne could’ve been a lot more damning in her assessment. “We slept together a couple of times. I was feeling it - he wasn’t - and that was the end of that.”
Dean shifts his weight to his other foot. “Right… you and Cas?” Dean ventures as Cas sighs loudly next to him.
Dean shrugs. “Donated 90% to Sloan Kettering, the rest to the development of a new pain drug in Israel. It has weed in it, so they can’t do the research state-side.”
“He has his cooking club,” Dean says with a grin. “And, like, half the student body goes. I sometimes go and help out too, if he needs extra hands.”
Dean just gives him a thumbs up as he lowers the cup. He licks his lips, chasing the taste, and Castiel has seen pornography less graphic.
And Dean’s stomach rumbles obnoxiously loudly. “Sorry,” Dean says apologetically. “My eating schedule’s all wacked from being on the road.”
Cas perches on the other side of the couch, half-facing Dean, half-facing the television. “It can be broken.”
As soon as Professor Tran lets them go, Cas is out of his seat like a shot, his rainbow cape sweeping after him. Dean calls his name, but either Cas doesn’t hear or chooses to ignore him.
Dean lets out a strained laugh. “Here,” he bats Castiel’s hands away, “let me.” But he doesn’t stop at his belt; he unzips his pants and pushes them down. “Your turn, sunshine.”
Cas doesn't move. “Aren’t you afraid I might be a crazy person?” he asks frankly. “We hardly know each other, and you’re giving me your home address.”
Hours later, Cas lets Wart ride back to the house in Jack’s stroller. The frog entertained Jack until nearly noon, and he more than deserves a rest. Jack falls asleep before the clearing is out of sight, head lolling and breathing even.
“Yeah,” Sam says as he throws an inscrutable look at Dean. “I’ve been meaning to bring him around since I moved in, but you know how it is in the beginning of the semester.” He walks around Castiel and ducks into his room.
“Alright, alright,” Dean grumbles as he starts the engine with one hand and cranks down the window with the other. As they pull past Sam, Dean sticks his arm out the window, middle finger up.
