After about ten minutes of excited gossip, she took control of the little group. “Alright!” A sharp snap of of the crop stilled the chatter. “Get the practice poles out and go warm up! We have work to do!” Her voice was pleasant and kind, but commanding. The others nodded and quickly filed out of the dressing room, leaving John alone with Irene.
He should have been elated...but the open door only drove another spike of fear through his chest. He was exposed in a place where creatures the devil himself would fear were contained...and now, presumably, running loose. SCP-9340 remained still, unable to understand what was going on and why. Had Moriarty caused the breach? He seemed to know about it.
When the restraining hands were finally removed, SCP-9340 was helplessly trapped on his back. Thick leather straps crossed his body to hold him against the heavy gurney, they were pulled tight over his chest, hips, and legs. His arms remained trapped at his back, now painfully pinned under his body. His shoulders were on fire and he could feel the uncomfortable dig of metal into his lower back. Another strap pressed against his forehead, making lifting or turning his head impossible. His bare toes curled tightly as he struggled to find any leeway in his restraints. His breath rasped in his throat as he struggled to breathe through the tightened straps. The guards filed out of the cell, leaving SCP-9340 at the mercy of the researchers. The pair of which appeared in his limited field of view with the ever hovering masked worker, the one who was now eager to get back at the helpless SCP.
Holding down the button was the man who he'd first thought was just there to observe his revival rate. He was a rather immaculate looking fellow, a lab coat kind of casually slung over his shoulders. A t-shirt and some nice jeans. He had the appearance of an intern more than a researcher. His dark hair was combed perfectly into place and his eyes reflected like orbs of pure ebony. He smiled unpleasantly sweet, cracking his gum thoughtfully.
The deer man toppled, the clatter of antlers rattling around the room too loudly for the blonde SCP's likes, as SCP-9340 rolled away! He scrambled to get away, to put distance between himself and whatever this creature was, as his pained fingers resumed their task of fiddling with the, thankfully not lost, paperclip in the lock.
“I'm feeling a lot better, you know.” John mumbled, “You could...should...probably get some rest.”
A shiver of fear raced down the blonde SCP's spine as those words echoed in his mind. It seemed like an age had passed since he'd heard similar words spoken earlier and he took another step away, “N-no...M-Moriarty...”
had paid for a few years ago. Make-up overflowed the small desk space before him. However...nestled in the mess, close to his mirror, was a very pricey bottle of red wine with a black ribbon tied in a decorative bow around the bottle's neck. A plain, white, card propped against it. A name,
“He did mention something like that.” Sherlock nodded as they passed the stage, the woman dancing had the same uncaring look in her eyes as his greeter. “However, pleasure will have to wait. I'm here on business...”
“C-coat?” John managed to murmur, confused until the woman handed Sherlock a rather nice looking jacket. It was short and black, but it looked fit for action more than anything. It was a coat that John would have loved to have...and one that he probably couldn't have afforded. A blush touched his cheeks as Sherlock motioned him to turn so he could help the blonde man, gently, slip into the warm, luxurious, jacket.
Sherlock didn't let go, instead pulling John's thrashing, cold, form against his chest and between the wall. John all but went mad, driving several hard blows into Sherlock's chest before trying to twist away from his trapped hold. The detective nearly let go, surprised John could still hit so hard, he shouldn't have been so foolish. Instead of letting go, Sherlock decided to reach up with a free hand to turn on the water again, this time opting for a warm spray as he clung to John while he struggled free from his flashback. The man gasped for air, but his struggles slowly ceased...eventually they stopped all together. John's hands were balled into Sherlock's shirt and his head hung between their bodies. His rasping breath sounded close to sobs, yet no tears fell this time. The blonde man said nothing, letting the water wash over them in silence for several long moments.
Sherlock stared into those tortured, pained, eyes and wondered how many times the man, John, had been forced to say and do that, and more, that night. By the state of his makeup and how close he was to breaking down into tears, it had been too many to count.
John frowned, “We can’t just—“ John’s words died in his throat as he watched Greg lay hands on the wall.
John's face filled with anguish and his fists twisted desperately in Sherlock's shirt, “Please, please! I'm begging you...please...just...just stop...”
And John Watson, of all people, had managed to escape his holding cell before they could arrive. So, they’d chased him down and now…now they had to face off against whatever the hell was outside the damn door!
“Stop it!” He hissed to himself, “Get a hold of yourself!”
The curled SCP made no attempt to move, aware his defiance would cost him...but compliance didn't hurt any less most days. He heard the subtle sigh an instant before the intercom clicked off, the researcher would call for the guards. They would arrive shortly, so he savoured what little time he had left before his daily tortures began. The researchers that examined him every single day were there to try and kill him. SCP-9340 didn't know how many times he'd died in the past two years...but they'd all been painful and they'd all been accompanied by his subsequent revival and return to his hellish existence.
The door slipped shut after mere moments, leaving the SCP to trun and inspect his new surroundings. It was another containment cell, but by the look of things...whatever had been in it was long gone. Tables were turned over and computers were strewn across the floor like trash. The cell, which he had to get close to, hesitantly, was empty and bare...minus a bloody trail leading nowhere. The blonde SCP sincerely hoped whatever had been in the chamber was gone, even so he wasn't about to linger. Carefully, he started to look through the mess for anything of use. His eyes passed over a pile of scattered papers, thinking to disregard them as nothing useful...until he spotted a few paperclips.
With much fear and trepidation, he turned back down the long hall and stared blindly into the gloom. What he wouldn't give for some sort of emergency light, all he could make out were shapes and shadows...barely a few feet away at that. He took a deep, terrified, breath...crouching low against the wall as he started to creep back the way he'd come. Every noise made him jump and every flickering shadow made him freeze. The going back was much slower than his hurried exit, wary of the creatures he might have drawn in with his frenzied running.
?” He winked and watched the blonde SCP shift to face him more directly.
SCP-9340 trembled violently, unable to quell the involuntary shaking as he stared into the luminous eyes. The creature the eyes belonged to stepped closer and SCP-9340 felt his lips part to scream, but the sound couldn't move past his frozen throat. He wanted to move, to run, to do anything but sit there! But the shining eyes compelled him to stay put. For a horrible second, SCP-9340 thought it was Moriarty...he, whatever he was, had promised to return for the blonde SCP, after all.
OKAY, I'm a terrible person. I'm sorry. I know I kept promising this sooner, but I got rather sick. I'm getting better and thus, I've been able to post this. I'm sorry, again, for being a failure on the updating sooner thing. I'm really trying my hardest to get this done! I promise (and I do mean this one) that I won't leave it unfinished. I never have and never will live a fic undone. I may take a long time to get there, but I will get there. So stay lovely and I'm super sorry for the long wait.
Sherlock smiled slowly as he carefully climbed onto the bed. “You’re gorgeous.” He breathed, leaning over John’s body to press a soft kiss to his lips.
“Perfect fit...as I thought.” Sherlock smiled subtly, like he enjoyed the rugged appearance John now held.
John knew she didn't mean it, it was all part of her personality. The teasing and the commanding. He smiled faintly as she exited the dressing room, leaving John alone for a few precious moments. He turned the parcel over in his hands and nodded to himself before he tucked it up in the underside of his desk, in a small secret nook he'd made some years ago. It wasn't like it mattered if it was found by the Boss, but John didn't want to share the contents with the others...as selfish as that was. Once he was certain it was out of sight, he slowly shrugged out of his robe and stooped to pick up a rumpled black t-shirt from the floor as well as a pair of loose shorts. He winced at the angry looking bruise on his ribcage and stiffly worked the shirt over his head. Slowly, he pulled on the shorts and then padded, barefoot, out to the main room.
“I didn't realize you'd be awake.” Sherlock offered, sounding just ever so slightly worried...or perhaps ashamed. Like he was upset for letting John endure sounds that obviously upset him. “I meant to be back before you...” The man sighed as he trailed off and headed for his violin.
“Right! Let's get you up then...” Sherlock nodded, hesitating a fraction of a second before he moved to help John get up.
Sherlock took John by the hand, gently leading him down the hall towards his bedroom. Every few steps, he stopped to kiss John with passion so raw it almost brought John to his knees. He also slowly divested the man of his clothes. First to go was the hideous pullover.
The stoic voice commanded, echoing in the glass chamber quite loudly.
Something about the darkness seemed...familiar. It embraced him and called to him voicelessly. It beckoned him somewhere. Usually SCP-9340 was revived before he could go to it, but on occasion, when they killed him quite horribly, he could follow the call to the source of the beckoning. Always it was an indistinct shadow on the edge of his sights. It was a tall shadow with strange, glow, bright blue eyes...it called to him. Sometimes he could make out other features...like a flicker of along tail or the glint of an antler, but nothing that made sense.
Irene pursed her lips and sighed, retracting her hand with an odd look before she smiled again. “I brought you something.” Bringing her other hand from around her back to present John with a smallish parcel wrapped in brown paper.
John blushed, a bit flustered, before he adjusted the collar of the jumper slowly. “I could have done it.”
“It might surprise you to know that you'll be seeing a lot more of me in the coming weeks. It seems I passed some sort of test, which proved me trustworthy enough to watch this club while the Boss is out of town on various business trips.” Sherlock said as they walked along, passing the vanities where the other were watching from as they finished cleaning up for the night. “At first I thought it was a bit odd, allowing a near stranger to take over, but it occurred to me that your boss will have been watching me long before I ever arrived at this point. I suppose I showed promise.”
"Well, I'll let you be on then. I have a patient to check up on before I can start the rest of my day." John inclined his head down the hall, ready to get away from the subtle awkwardness as soon as possible.
As if to prove my unspoken point, he paints his pre-come across my lips, then dips the head of his cock into my mouth once more. Not forceful, just a hint past my lips. And I moan again at the taste of him, wanting more, wishing I could make him come like this, let him mark me as his alone by spending across my cheeks.
Right now, Sherlock’s got him. He caught him in the way John couldn’t.
The entire place was creaking and John wondered how far behind the pair of them he was. Five minutes? Ten? He hadn't been rushing because he assumed Sherlock had control over the situation, but how much control had been real and how much of an upper hand could the mysterious man have gained? Surely Sherlock's collapse had been a ruse to gain the attention of--
There was no answer outside of a silent murmur of lips against his throat.
“Well...?” Sherlock prompted as he stared over at John expectantly.
John inhaled deeply, winced at the pain, and stepped outside onto the doorstep and into the sunlight. It was dim, cloudy, and cold. A dampness lingered in the air with the promise of fog. Cars rolled by lazily and people passed by without sparing John so much as a glance. They had no idea who he was...or what he was. He was just another person heading out for his destination. Sherlock brushed against his back, prompting him to move a few more steps away from the door. He swallowed hard against the painful lump forming in his throat, blinking rapidly to dispel the moisture starting to gather in his eyes.
The back portion of the vast club was mostly bare, except for furniture, so they practised there. They cleared the chairs and sofas out of the area and brought in a few large standing mirrors to prop against the wall before they retrieved portable poles that could essentially be put up anywhere. Sometimes they were used for club events where there was a large crowd, but mostly they were used for practice.
, John...”
Greg’s arm was…mangled. Which was a gentle way of putting things. The skin, in places, seemed scalded. It was blistered. Bleeding. And…the bones…John had never seen breaks like these. The arm was practically flexing and wobbling, almost as if the bone was liquefied. Three of five digits were stripped of flesh or ever close to it.
A whimper worked in the back of his throat and a tremor raced through his body. SCP-9340 felt the urge to back away and try to hide, but the thought of being caught in the cell with no place to run pushed him forward. This time he pressed on shoulder to the glass wall as he walked along, seeking the door. Each step was slow and filled with dread. He was still cuffed...he was vulnerable...he couldn't die, granted, but he didn't want to be killed around every corner. And he didn't want to find out what Moriarty
“Pl-please.” John gasped through a soft hitching breath. “I'm dying...to shower.”
The Boss glared down at him, “What did you say? Did I
“Stop what?”
“What're we doing here?” John asked gently, still embarrassed from the cab ride.
The accent was British and gruff, but not unpleasant. It was accompanied by the body of a man---who was a head taller than the SCP, but not as tall as the beast---wedging himself between the deer man and the SCP! “Christ! You'll give him a heart attack!” The deer man, Sherlock, growled under his mask, a hiss seemed to issue from the depths of his chest and his tail lashed audibly on the floor. “Don't you even growl at me! You're
John shifted under Sherlock’s stare, blushing. “W-what?”
“That obvious?” Sherlock asked, dropping back into his carefully constructed character as he started to roll the sleeves of his shirt up.
“Of course not! You've arrived just in time, actually.” Irene purred as she gestured to her chair, “We could always use a captive audience to practice on.”
you could speak?” Removing his foot only to savagely drive it into John's exposed ribs. The blonde man yelped, “Two at a time, boys...” The shadow figures laughing and moving in as the Boss motioned for Sherlock to follow him out of the room. Sherlock's last sight of John was of the man's panties being pulled down his shaking legs, a single tear rolling down his face and the hopeless resignation of someone who'd given up a long time ago shining in the depths of his eyes.
you show it. So...go on then, seduce me.” Irene purred with a feline smile, her eyes lighting up with the greatest pleasure as she observed them trying their best to do what she wanted.
“But...the traffic...”
By the time they reached Sherlock’s room, Sherlock was stepping backwards out of his pants with his lips locked firmly with John’s. Their breaths ragged and loud as they panted through the passionate kiss.
“Let’s go home, John Watson.” Sherlock purred, ignoring the scratching on the door and how incessantly nagging it was becoming. In fact it seemed to be reaching a fever pitch now…
In the middle of the room was a man, hands trapped behind him with tight cuffs, on his knees. A blonde man dressed in sheer, lacy, red panties and matching stockings that were, at one point, held up with and equally lacy red garter belt. The left one was still being held up, but the right had slipped down around his knee. A tight, sheer, cherry red corset, trimmed in black, was askew on his torso and there was a ruby ribbon around his neck, which had been tied and retied several times based on the wrinkles in the fabric. It was like an invitation to unwrap a present...or a statement of ownership. His lips were painted with glistening red lipstick, most of which was now smudged.  A daring crimson eye eyeshadow didn't hide the beginnings of a bruise around one eye and along the side of his face. He was shaking and appeared to be on the verge of crying, his breath hitching and chest heaving. Red marks from rough hands marred the man's pale skin, dark bruises were starting to appear from under the makeup...and Sherlock could just see the scar on his shoulder through a heavily applied makeup there.
John didn't jump into the action right away. He did take some time to stretch, loosening some of the stiffness from his body as well as aggravating some of the sore spots. He bit his lip as he stretched over his bruised ribs, savouring the tingling ache that raced through his chest and along his spine. He loathed that he was intentionally doing it...but it helped keep his inner demons at bay. It was worth it...in John's mind.
John did revel in his seductive powers.
“You were just leaving.” He said evenly, waiting patiently for her to slowly get up and nervously edge her way around him and back to the grouped others. He turned his head just slightly to observe the group.
His body was covered in a coat of thick fur that was almost entirely obsidian. No wonder the blonde man hadn't been able to see him in the darkness before! Yet, as the panic eased in his chest, he was able to make out the snow white patches on the creature's flexing belly...his strong chest...the inside of his slender arms...the palms of his clawed hands...and his powerful inner thighs. SCP-9340 felt as though he'd seen the pattern before, it caused his mind to race as he struggled to identify the creature staring at him like a meal. The colours of the creature's coat mottled where they intertwined and SCP-9340's eyes widened when he caught sight of a tail twisting in the gloom behind the creature! It was almost comically long, but the more it twisted on the floor...the more the blonde man thought it suited the beast before him. Towards the end, the tail feathered and fluffed with more curly fur...the tail almost seemed to be a morbid fixation for the blonde SCP.
I am deeply and truly sorry for not updating in such a long time. My life went a bit crazy and I got very sick, hurt, and busy. I know it's been forever since I touched this, I didn't mean to leave it so long. I'm sorry. I'm sorry and I feel terrible for leaving it so long! I really hope that you still want to read this and I understand if you don't. I promise, as I always have and will, that I won't leave it unfinished. I may take forever and a day to update, but I'll never leave it undone. I know what that's like and I know it can suck, but I swear I'm getting better and I will update more regularly from now on. I hope you're all still doing well and I'm sorry you had to wait this long for an update. You're all wonderful and I'm sorry for being such a scumbag and not updating this sooner.
“Yes...the Boss is waiting for you...” The woman smiled over her shoulder at him as she showed Sherlock to a door in the far corner. Knocking once before opening the door to allow Sherlock in. The lanky detective stepped into the dimly lit room, utterly unprepared for the sight that greeted him.
Irene watched, snapping her fingers for one of the young men to fetch her a chair and a drink from the bar. A fine crystal wine glass filled just right with a very expensive wine. “Now...I'm not paid to watch you go through the motions. I'm paid to make you
“Right, let’s get the hell out of here…” Greg muttered as he hands started to disappear into the dark pool of matter.
SCP-9340 could hear his heart thudding in his chest as he tried to remain calm. The power had to come back soon...right? The blonde SCP almost screamed when he heard the nearly silently hiss of the glass door sliding back and to the side.
John shook his head to try and shake the voice out, lunging over to the whimpering man starting to sag with his arms still trapped in the swirling portal. He didn’t know what help he’d be, but there had to be something they could do.
The blonde man eased his way off the pole, confidently strutting right up to Sherlock and straddling his lap on an impulse. It wasn't something uncommon in the club, but John didn't usually practice interactions with clients, unless they paid for it. John caught his lower lip in his teeth as he ground against the man's lap, pressing himself closer to Sherlock's face. John's lips just barely caressed Sherlock's before he pulled away with a wink and slipped off the man's lap. Leaving Sherlock looking dazed and frazzled as he strolled back to the pole. Once he reached it...the world slowly came back to him. He could hear the smattering of applause from his companions and Irene praising him...
Reluctantly, he drew his terrified eyes towards the face of the creature. He felt his breath catch in his throat as his gaze was met with those bright, glowing, eyes that stared at him from under a morbid skull mask, the likes of which he'd never seen before. The skull itself was as black night and some sort of scene of horrible beasts intertwined had been carved into every groove. It could have been from some sort of deer, were it not for the terrifying fangs and jagged teeth that lined it. He feared what the lower jaw would look like on such a terrifying creature. Just the teeth would have been sufficiently horrific, but the skull bore antlers of shining ebony. They were flared and wide, almost moose-like, but they too had been carved with intricate scenes of horrible monsters. It fit the face of the creature flawlessly. The eye sockets glowed with the bright eyes and its own obscenely large set of antlers, more than three feet tall and branching, interlocked with the carved holes. Like they had grown around each other. His ears were long and flicking, tipped with white, through the long, curling, mane of untamed black hair that reminded the SCP more of a lion than anything.
The dark haired man faltered minutely, his bright eyes cutting towards John with a curious look as he straightened slowly and resumed his helping. Putting a strong arm around John's torso to maintain his support of the blonde's shaking form. John was surprised that the contact didn't add to his disgust...it didn't make his skin absolutely crawl and it certainly didn't make him try to pull away. It was...oddly comforting.
A red light over the main door began to flash, giving SCP-9340 his only indication that his fears of a breach were right. In a few seconds the black steel shields, installed for just such an unlikely scenario, would descend over his glass walls and his chamber would be pumped full of various nerve gases, previously tested to ensure he would stay 'dead' for at least twelve hours. He took a few deep breaths to calm himself, fully aware of the pain he would feel before he would die. However, the shields did not descend...instead the lights flickered out with a horrible sort of finality, leaving SCP-9340 stranded in the darkness of his silent containment cell.
“Please…” John looked up at the man pleadingly, “I…trust you…”
Commanding as she was, Irene did have a softer side which was reserved for the most wounded souls in the club. She was the one hopeful ray of light most of the others idolized, John might have at one point...but he couldn't remember what it was like to hope. He sighed deeply and gently pulled away from her, murmuring a soft thanks and reaching to rub at his moist eyes. She stroked his cheek before she straightened and turned to head out of the dressing room, “Do hurry out, John. I won't tolerate tardiness, even from you!”
“B-but I was j-just—”
With slow, pained, movements John managed to dress himself. It seemed to take an age to pull the comfortable jeans on over shaking legs. It took a considerably longer time for John to ease on a button up shirt and shrug on a thick jumper. His ribs screamed angrily at him for even trying to lift his arms higher than his waist, but John savoured the heady rush of pain. It helped to clear his mind of all the uncertain thoughts he'd been having about actually joining Sherlock in the outside world.
. He was tall and imposing. His eyes were dark and glinted wickedly in the dim lights. His hair was cropped short...definitely military in nature. He curled his fingers in the man's blonde hair as he stared over at Sherlock.
Irene's eyes rolled, at about the twenty minute mark, and she gained her feet to walk among them to give them pointers here and there. She was very particular and occasionally she tapped her crop against someone's flesh to reiterate a point that they had been told and subsequently failed to execute. But her hits were never harsh and her instructions were never belittling, though she threw in the occasional jab in good fun. It helped to ease the mood and make them forget, for a short time, that they were basically bought and paid for property with no rights or lives.
(See the end of the chapter for
Instead of vocalizing my desire, I sink to my knees in front of him, hoping this will provide an ample distraction from the fact that he clearly feels ridiculous about being fully clothed when I’m completely bare.
Sherlock has some thoughts about the services he would provide. John goes with it.
John pulled Sherlock’s bottoms the rest of the way off and tossed them to the floor.
John looked at Sherlock. He wasn't sure of that answer himself. He didn't think Sherlock had tried anything tricky.
Written on an iPad. All errors are my own.
“I imagine there’s a story there?”
that arise between him and his partner, either.
She clicked her tongue at him, giving him a sympathetic glace. “Maybe a bit before that would’ve been more appropriate than when he showed up at your door.”
“Your husband’s growth is equivalent to about twelve to thirteen weeks,” the woman said, not looking at the anxious couple, but instead watching the screen. “However--” She broke off, stilling the image and staring as if she’d found exactly what she was looking for.
Greg curled in on his arms, making it even harder to see what the hell had even happened to them in the already dim room. John struggled loose from limbs, and tails, and crouched at Lestrade’s side.
There are some random fictitious figures who appear in the majority of this chapter. They aren't really OC's (because they're pretty much lacking every single detail)...just kind of randoms to move plot. But enjoy anyway!
His cell door slipped open without so much as a whisper, the guards, however, practically marched in. They approached without hesitation, because while SCP-9340 couldn't die...he wasn't actually anymore dangerous than a normal person.
Without warning...a warm, spicy, and somewhat pleasant, scent filled his nostrils as something impossibly soft brushed behind his neck! For a brief moment, he felt undeniable pleasure and relief swell in the back of his mind. As quickly as the feelings came, they were replaced by unbidden fear! A squeak of purr terror escaped his careful control he lurched ahead and whipped around! The luminous eyes filled his vision and sent him staggering even further, backwards, and over a fallen chair! The blonde SCP hit the floor with a cry of pain, his cuffed hands taking the brunt of the fall as something crunched audibly! Tears of pain jumped to his eyes, but he barely noticed as he tried to disentangle himself from the chair and scoot away from the looming luminous eyes!
The blonde man shuddered, “N-no! Why does that matter?” Tired tears of frustration finally started to fall from his eyes as he stared up into the looming face of the masked creature. “
Sherlock held his gaze and his ground, shaking his head subtly, “I can't do that...because you do matter, John.”
“Yes!” SCP-9340 couldn't help but exclaim as he worked the bends out of the clip and ran desperately shaking fingers over the cuffs to find the keyhole.
As soon as his skin contacted the metal...the world seemed to fall away. He couldn't hear the shuffling of the others and he didn't feel their staring eyes. He didn't even acknowledge Irene's eager grinning face...his whole focus became the dark haired man in the chair. John's body changed, the stiffness suddenly replaced with fluid seduction. His hips rolled and his back arched as he lifted his chin to give the man a searing once over before he strutted smoothly around the pole.
“No one does, Johnny...not here. But I'll be damned if I'll let the Boss ruin everything. And...it's more of a thank you...you've been so much help.” A small woman with long dark hair said as her voice trembled. “I...I don't know what we'd do without you.” The others nodded and some sniffed back a tear or two of their own.
His eyes darted to the spot on the floor between Sherlock's feet. The detective, himself, was blissfully unaware of his companions' plight, too busy tapping away a sassy response to Mycroft.
“John will be taking the coat after all, Mrs. Hudson.” The man said as the elderly landlady smiled towards a very uncertain John.
” Forcing the man to stare up into Sherlock's eyes.
Consider this my Christmas gift for you, I'm going away for the holidays and I won't be touching this story until the new year. Sad as that may seem to many of you, I just can't juggle holidays and hobbies and work as well as I used to. So enjoy this and have a merry one! Thank you for reading all my lovelies and I'll see you in the new year!
The tall man leaned over him, stroking the tears on his cheeks, “I know…” He breathed as he gently sealed his lips over John’s once more…at the same time…he guided himself into John.
the hell are
However, as much as John didn't want to be touched, he found Sherlock's contact to be somewhat...different. It wasn't exactly tender like his companions might offer...but it certainly wasn't rough like a client...or the Boss. It wasn't entirely indifferent either, like the thugs that usually had to pick him up off the floor after nights like his anniversary. John swallowed back a fearful noise, readjusting his grip so he held the man around the waist...pressing against the lithe form experimentally.
SCP-9340 gasped in a shuddering breath that sounded too much like a sob, he was still utterly terrified. He wasn't sure he could trust a man that commanded such a terrifying beast! When the grey haired man moved to lay a steadying hand on him, SCP-9340 jerked away with clear terror.;
John pulled, Lestrade screamed! But his arms didn’t budge. John felt his muscles straining, something popped in his back. Beside him, Sherlock’s tail lashed loudly against the floor as he hauled on the trapped man with all his might. It seemed like a futile effort, but just as abruptly as it all seemed to start, it ended. The portal snapped back to black and all three tumbled away from the wall! They crashed into a heap on the floor as the portal faded back to a normal wall.
Both names were mingled with strangled gasps and both were nearly shouted a few precious strokes before John and Sherlock orgasmed. Sherlock wouldn’t say it was the exact same time, but it was damn close. Sherlock trembled, holding himself over John as John slumped back into the sheets, both flushed from the sex…and the exertions. John swallowed as he panted, wetting his lips with his tongue. His eyes closed.
Again, sorry about the delay. I've been busy, busy, busy! But I won't leave this unfinished and I will get to all those little plot details in time. So, here's a little chapter to keep you interested and to slow the pace just a little. ;D Enjoy, or don't, my lovelies.
As always, SCP-9340 could feel the pull of his shadowy caller as he drifted in the darkness. He sought it out, seeking the solace of the unknown creature. He could see it lingering on the cusp of being fully in view and just out of sight, but unlike before...he could smell it. A wave of spices and ash rolled over him, swirling around him like a heavy fog. The scent was overpowering and the blonde SCP felt himself struggling to recall it...it was familiar, frustratingly familiar.
John sniffed quietly and nodded, slowly removing the long coat and handing it over. Watching the man's body turn without glancing back to John, giving the blonde what little privacy he could...allowing him some sort of modesty. It was a gesture John was unaccustomed to...so used to being stared during his years with the Boss. It was a gesture that could have made him cry, but instead he watched Sherlock exit the shower before he turned on the water.
Which seemed to be something both John and Sherlock were familiar with. Lestrade was not.
His reaction was entirely involuntary, but welcome. Before he knew what he was doing, SCP-9340 worked a stout leg down and planted his foot in the creature's chest! The glowing eyes blinked and the ears perked an instant before SCP-9340 heaved the thing's torso away with an explosive grunt!
The woman giggled and smiled, but Sherlock noticed the deadness to her eyes. Clearly she wasn't working there by her own free will. She gently hung his coat up on a rack with a few others. “All the first timers look like that when they come in.” She winked as she brought him into the room, “The Boss said to expect you, too. He said the first time is on the house.”
OKAY, so...I'm back. Sorry about the long delay. I needed to take a breather and break and focus on me for a while. But I'm back now and I'm going to get this wrapped up for you guys, I promise. I hope you all still enjoy reading this, even if I update super slowly. I won't leave it unfinished. That's a promise. It may just take forever to be done. BUT I WILL GET IT DONE. So, thank you for being patient and waiting. You're wonderful and I love you. Okay? Okay. <3
Sherlock diligently made life bearable. The lanky man would play his violin, loudly, for hours on end to drown out the more tedious sounds of life beyond the flat's walls. Sherlock never ventured far after that first day, sending Mrs. Hudson for anything that wasn't within walking distance. He also engaged John in various conversations which stemmed from the different types of tobacco ash to various body parts which seemed to appear in the oddest places. (Admittedly, John had been rather terrified when he first discovered a foot in the fridge. Sherlock assured him it was not from an unfortunate victim...that time.)
The initial blast of ice cold water made him gasp, but it was quickly replaced by ever hotter water when John twisted the tap several times. It was nearly searing hot and almost painful to the touch when he stopped. But John didn't reach to cool it or to step back. He needed to feel the burn...he needed to feel like it would help. He leaned heavily against the wall under the burning spray, gasping back sobs. His skin still crawled and he could still feel the rough hands on him, the scraping of calluses along his soft sides. He could still feel the desperately painful thrusts that had jarred his whole body against the floor repeatedly. He could still feel the shame of his own unwelcome arousal...one that had been exploited.
The street faded out of focus as his own name echoed in his head, changing from Sherlock's comfortable baritone to Moriarty's much more sinister drawl...
John started to strip off his shirt to try and bandage the wounds. Try to do something for the man that was so clearly in distress. But Greg shook his head, gasping ragged, shallow, breaths as he turned his eyes up to Sherlock.
“You've...you've done enough.”
It had taken him the better part of two years to get to this point, the point where he had been invited to the club. In those years, he'd worked relentlessly at becoming a ruthless, and cunning, criminal mastermind. Or at least having a very convincing cover as one. He was no criminal...he was a detective and this was his ongoing case, a case suggested by his brother. At first, Sherlock had declined, but the enticement of a good hard case finally wore him down and he relented. Agreeing to help Mycroft shed light on the mastermind behind a massive criminal web. And all signs pointed to this person where
John usually could suppress them...usually could manage to avoid breaking down like that. But...the Boss always strove to make it impossible on his anniversary. He wanted John to break and crumble...he wanted John to remember that he owned him and whatever he said John did. Tears mixed with the burning hot water as John choked on another set of painful sobs, his body screaming for him to get out of the water...but he stayed put. Refusing to move one inch.
Moriarty.
John's mind when blank, his body was rigid as the group parted to expose him. Did she have any idea what she was doing to him? Knowing Irene...she knew exactly what she was doing. Sherlock seemed a bit uncertain, watching John with a passive expression that bordered on discomfort. He knew John was still healing...and he knew John was still fighting emotional pain. He had seen John at his very worst. And yet there was no pity in the depths of Sherlock's blue eyes, only a strange intensity that John couldn't quite name.
"You aren't betraying him, John, you're helping him.” The Headmaster had similar abilities to his brother, then. “If Moriarty has made a threat that has so shaken my brother, you'll be bringing it to light and ensuring that the Aurors can stop him before this goes to far." Mycroft Holmes paused and looked at Lestrade, who nodded.
Sherlock's wand didn't waver.
“I need you to come,” he says, slipping the hand that’s been gripping my hip around to grasp at my cock. “God, I need to feel you come.”
John’s ankle touched his under the table, and he remembered that he’d been indulging himself.
Which is why Sherlock works so hard to make him come undone when they are child-free for any short period of time, like this afternoon, when Mrs. Hudson has decided to do her seasonal baking. Which she borrows Hamish for--cheeky wink or no. Sherlock can’t complain--it’s an introduction to applied chemistry--and, well. He can’t complain about the, erm,
7. Family portrait
His fingers slid from base to tip, then back down again with a little twist of his wrist on the down stroke. The resultant squeeze around his own member was a welcome afterthought, and John let his other hand stall on Sherlock's hip, helping to keep him steady.
"It's utterly mad. Completely dangerous." John stared up at that pale face, seemingly even whiter in the faint light from the Aurors' and spectators' wands. It was dimming now that people had gotten their fair share of the action and were returning to their night on the town.
John tried to count to ten.
’” Sherlock paused, eyes still closed, fingers clasped together over his upper abdomen. “And now--now there are
He did the math in his head. If the number was to be believed, he’d find her again at the age of 36. And she was--what had they said? 23? She was three years younger--she’d be 33 when they met if she allowed him to find her.
"What do you mean?"
His hand shoots to my shoulder, gripping my bare skin as his shirtsleeve grazes my collarbone.
1. Electric kettle
I press myself against him from chest to groin, marveling at the feel of his shirt buttons leaving an imprint on my belly where his tie has shifted away in invitation. The obsidian silk of the tie rubs against my left nipple as I move (somehow both warm and cool at the same time, an erotic experiment for another time) and I groan into his ear, barely restraining myself from biting down on the collar of his shirt where it peaks out of his suit jacket.
John's eyes scanned over the article. Third apparent suicide, potion taken in the dead wizard's bedroom, no suicide note. It was strange that they were all similar, but he didn't see how someone could kill three people without any struggle. The article explicitly stated that there were no signs of an Unforgivable; no cause for concern.
Oh, how the tables had turned.
--John really could take him all the way down.
John Apparated instantly, knowing the Aurors would be there almost instantly on the tail of the Curse. He didn't have time to check over Sherlock, he didn't have time for anything but self-preservation.
"I brought you a bit of a getting to know you present," a deep voice called from across the room.
to take care of it.”
could be right around the corner, inching closer. It was a heady knowledge--that of all the people in the world, the person on the other side of those mysterious numbers was meant solely for him.
of the papers spilling out mid-air. Somewhere outside the safe walls of Baker Street was a man he’d never met, a man who, by all accounts, had more rights to Annabelle than Sherlock did. Everyone knew that the courts sided with Alphas who pursued custody of their children. It had barely been two generations since Omegas had been considered property of their Alphas--how was Sherlock, a single parent who barely had a stable and safe job, supposed to compete against a war hero?
And then the heat was gone and John stayed planted against the wall, wondering what was wrong on the other side. Once they started, the other man had never pulled away until John had come unless it was to tease him with long licks of his tongue.
He groaned at the simple thought and rested his forehead on the pillow in front of him, waiting.
Sherlock's hand slipped around to the back of John's neck, an almost teasing promise, an obvious desire to be closer, for their lips to be joined, for Sherlock's skilled fingers to tangle in John's short hair and lead the kiss. But the position wasn't forgiving; their mouths couldn't take each other's pleasure when the rest of their bodies so demanded their attention.
“Of course, I’d tease you relentlessly, because I know what you want better than you do.” Lips moved to the piping of John’s grey pants and began to move along the edge where elastic met skin. “It’s why I can justify charging you such a fee for a single night.” Down he went, following the curve until John was spreading his legs at the almost ticklish sensation, lifting his knees to give better access to his lover.
Knowing he was in no immediate danger this time, Sherlock closed his eyes, ready and waiting for whatever John's subconscious mind wanted of him.
Thank goodness it’s leather. Easier cleanup than upholstery.
His dreamer climbed completely onto the bed and straddled his hips. Sherlock was surprised to find that the other man--and now he was completely sure it was a man, and a very impressive one at that--was completely dressed, clad in jeans that were rough against his over-sensitive cock and a wool jumper that was just a bit itchy against his lower belly.
“What do you suppose it’s like to be the elder child?” Sherlock asks, settling up onto his elbow.
He stepped back, out of John Watson’s grasp, and the man cleared his throat, straightening out to bring himself to full height. He was already posturing for Sherlock’s attention, even just standing next to a Beta as boring as Mike Stamford.
Except perhaps right now.
So he'd been sleeping for four days in the care of house elves?
And then John was swallowed down once more, all the way to the root, and it couldn't possibly have been comfortable for the other man to press his face against the wall, but John was sure he'd be able to look down and see the lips pressing through the hole, stretched around him, and then he did and fuck,
“You are more right than you may think, Doctor.” Mycroft adjusted his feet so he was standing with them spread equally below him, shoulder-width, looking at John with a sort of formality that had lost any of the ease it may have had only a moment prior. “My brother blames me for a great deal of trauma he experienced as a child. Trauma that, I believe, would have been avoidable had I been able to--how does he say it?--
It was amazing how quickly things progressed when nature took over.
"But what if the child isn't brilliant, Sherlock? What if he or she is..." John gestured into the air between them aimlessly. "What if the baby turns out to be perfectly normal, perfectly boring. What if the baby has
When John comes to bed six minutes later and sets down two fresh cups of tea on the nightstand, I roll my eyes. He’s still wearing the socks.
"I saw him kissing the--"
A shiver ran through John's spine as the man stepped closer, and John was introduced to the body of SH, which felt lean and long pressed against him from behind. He was significantly taller than John, and he sported something long, hot, and impressive against the small of John's back.
"God, John, do something to make it stop."
John turned a few more pages. He didn’t know why he was sticking with the E’s.
“And where is your father now?” John didn’t realize his jaw was tight until the end of his question.
Perhaps he wasn’t the only one giving in.
He could have offered Sherlock his coat, but they’d be up in their room in a moment and the jacket would just be one more thing to strip away. Just now it was hard for John to keep from undressing his husband with his eyes, imagining those buttons popping, so he turned back to the receptionist.
The new angle pressed their hips together just so, and John moaned, now leaning down to take Sherlock's mouth with his. He wanted to claim him, to tell the world that he was lucky enough to have Sherlock Holmes. That was all that mattered right now. Not James Moriarty, not Hogwarts, not the Houses, not the Ministry.
"As soon as the Aurors were sure they'd get no further words out of him, he informed us that you had been given a potion that would leave you incapacitated for several days--something just short of the drought of living death." The Headmaster paused and tapped the feathery end of his quill against a bit of parchment on his desk. "You would need looking after. With his determination to leave the castle, he hand-picked six house elves to administer your care."
"Go on," an almost gruff voice that wasn't Sherlock's was saying. "Drink it. Fifty-fifty shot you're right."
They were through the door to what John had to assume were Sherlock's private quarters. He was pulled through the clutter and somehow appropriate mayhem, not released until they approached the hearth.
"You do know that I didn't say anything out loud, yes?" John was a mite uncomfortable. He hadn't ever been around anyone with
A hand touched the back of John’s left calf, but he stepped forward, ignoring Sherlock’s warning. Sherlock ignored his often enough. John was allowed this solitary outburst to defend the father of his children.
"Oh, God," John practically wheezed. "You are...." He let the sentence trail off, stretching a bit to press his nose against the side of Sherlock's throat while the other man's fingers slid down his back, gently passing over scratches that John hadn't even felt in the making.
He wrote it off differently each time. The first time, he’d been 18, and even he’d thought he was too young to see the clock running down. It wasn’t surprising that his soul mate had been skittish; perhaps she was nervous about meeting him without really experiencing all that the world had to offer. Probably just cold feet about making that connection too soon, not wanting to settle just yet. If she was younger than him, maybe a year or two, she could’ve been called off by her parents. It wasn’t uncommon for parents to want their children to wait before letting fate take them on that course.
“I suppose I could multitask,” Sherlock said casually.
"Give me your wand." She held out her left hand to him. He wondered if he was actually meant to comply, or if she was basing his willingness on his lack of knowledge about her person.
“You feel brilliant around me, love,” John said, arching his hips to thrust up weakly. He tried again a few more times, barely gaining ground, until he gave up and just let Sherlock set the pace. “Take what you need, Sherlock. I’m yours. Whatever you need.”
"That's my lot, I suppose," John answered.
"And if you're wrong, well. It's just like going to sleep."
Nuisance Coupons are simple in theory: A plain three-by-five inch card with the word “Nuisance” written on the front. A Nuisance Coupon has lines on the back that are meant to be filled in with whatever nuisance Sherlock is being asked to deal with. For example, to celebrate their anniversary last year, John wanted to go away for a weekend and leave Hamish with Mrs. Hudson. This would have been moderately agreeable, except that their anniversary fell in the middle of a rather interesting triple-homicide. John produced one Nuisance Coupon for each day of the three-day weekend he wished to spend in the country, and that was the end of that.
, maybe... those kinds of deductions are... acceptable.”
"People have died," Sherlock said.
“Hamish!” John reaches for his son’s shoulders, trying to calm the excitement. “He brought what?”
"I'm fine," John said, grabbing at the shoulders of the other man's robes to keep himself on his feet. His knees were weak, though whether that was from the situation or Sherlock's sudden proximity remained to be seen. "Fine. I'm fine. Sherlock."
He nipped at his lover's collarbone, simultaneously teasing a hardening nipple with his dominant hand.
“It took us
The thoughts must've been writing themselves across his features as he contemplated his lover's questions.
“I’m here, John.” Arms tighten almost imperceptibly, but John relaxes. “I’m not going anywhere. I’ve got you.”
Sherlock cut him off with a kiss, unable to think about Chinese or Thai or Indian or
When he entered the living room, he saw his friend laying flat on his back, stretched out on the couch. With the dim light from the street lamps outside, John couldn’t tell if his eyes were open or closed. It probably didn’t matter; Sherlock rarely slept if John wasn’t in the flat.
“Yeah, he’s always like that,” Mike replied to John’s questioning gaze. “Sherlock Holmes, John Watson. John Watson, Sherlock Holmes.”
Split-second decisions. Crossed streets. Tube stops. Time was variable.
But it wasn't the time to think about that.
And then the world devolved into wet heat. A warm tongue slid into Sherlock’s mouth as they began to thrust together in an uneven rhythm. He opened his mouth wider as he pulled John closer by the hip, getting just a bit deeper on their next thrusts. The head of John’s cock nudged his own on the upstroke, kissing goodbye with the crown on its way down. A fascinating mix between the gel and silicone and hot flesh. Pure
“Sherlock, I want to take you into the bedroom and get you warm. Can you help me? Sherlock?” John stared directly into Sherlock’s blank eyes. The vibrant blue that usually answered him with a childlike curiosity was gone; gray slate stared back and made John feel like he was talking to a wall. A shaking, catatonic wall.
There wasn't anything about John Watson that could surprise Sherlock.
The problem, then, with being homosexual was that the alpha hormones that addled the brain and took even Sherlock Holmes down a few pegs with the need to couple--when you put an abundance of that hormone into the same room and told the two people contained therein that they were meant to mate with
Fingers wrapped around his cock to bring him out of his nervous state and stroked him up and down, sliding slick and warm. John realized belatedly that the fingers were coated with lube and before he could question it, he was being guided between two arse cheeks and a hot, tight ring of muscle was opening for the head of his cock.
Somehow, he hadn't expected a personal welcome.
John wondered how he was meant to make himself known to the Potions master. Should he send an elf? Or would he be better off wandering around until he found Sherlock doing the same?
John’s eyes opened slowly as his mind dragged his unwilling body back into consciousness. His fingers trailed over the cool, empty space next to him in the bed. Sherlock was already awake, then.
She was much younger here, walking down Baker Street with a small child balanced on her hip. Her hair was a bit lighter than he imagined it had been when she was this age, and her glasses had horned rims. This, this was too deep for him to have known about from observing and deducing the woman--her want for children, the lack thereof and, later, the knowledge that she wasn't able. But in this world, it was attainable. Children were possible in dreams. Anything was.
Then again, John knew firsthand that the
It had been hours since the alleyway and they were finally finished for the night, John pleased to have the invitation to stay until morning, and to return after his shift the following day. Sherlock had, in fact, asked if he wanted to move in, and while John was realizing that the consulting detective was a bit eccentric, he wasn't sure that was quite the step to be taking just yet.
He drops his towel and holds the box in both arms. “Mine!”
Lips wrapped around him and John's entire body shivered.
And he had been, though the entire hospital wing had been submerged under three inches of water by the time the boy's pores stopped seeping. It could've been worse--there could've been an odor rather than fresh water.
John Watson had never evaded fate of his own volition.
“I’m never going to be able to wear this suit again without thinking of this,” he says, shrugging off the suit jacket and flipping it to see the lube stains at the hem. “I don’t even know where I could get this cleaned without dying of mortification.”
"No," the detective answered.
“She was my summer tutor. Twenty-eight. Live-in. Latin, German, French.” He may as well have been reciting a grocery list, but even through the lack of emotion, John fixated on what he imagined was the key word in the bunch.
He moaned and dug his nails into his palms
He reached to one side, pulling open a drawer to fish about and pull out a condom packet. Well, if anything, he was prepared. John could also see something else in the drawer.
His eyes popped open, blinking rapidly against the harsh lights, and he inhaled a deep lungful of hated breath. Pain shivered through him as his body shed the remainder of the damages caused by his latest encounter with the research staff of
Sherlock hesitated, as if debating whether he should sit or he should play his violin. His intense gaze turned from John's face to the hand still wrapped, gingerly, around his forearm. Slowly...Sherlock joined John on the sofa. Both sat, in a slightly awkward silence, and ate. John watching Sherlock from the corner of his eye, meanwhile Sherlock methodically chewed and swallowed each bite...like it was a great chore to have to nourish his body.
It was from the Boss...a congratulations. It was his fifth year anniversary of being there of course. Tears welled in the depths of his grey eyes as he struggled to keep his composure. He knew the bastard just sent him things like that to rattle him...to remind him that he owned John. He curled his hand into his short and untidy blonde hair as he looked, once more, to the box in his lap. A simple piece of paper had been taped to the top with a few words written in the same beautiful cursive,
back in the dressing room. Every inch of his skin crawled and he wanted to desperately escape the closeness of the man. Much to his discomfort, the handsome stranger moved closer and knelt down next to his mattress. He didn't say anything...just watching John squirm under his gaze. Then, slowly, he held up a damp looking cloth. He didn't attempt to move it closer to John, just offering it to him at a somewhat respectful distance.
in your bedside table…why Sherlock, you are wicked.” John teased gently.
The man smiled sinisterly and shrugged, “Know your name? Oh yes, I know all about you in fact...”
Darkness soothed him.
Sherlock nodded. Greg’s eyes closed. The scratching grated hard on John’s ears. Sending horrible shivers down his spine as the mood changed in the room rather abruptly.
John dabbed his tongue at this lips as he rolled over and pressed his back to the pole, slowly working his way back to his feet, his hands travelling over his body before they arched over his head to wrap around the pole. His hips twisting in the most suggestive manner. He closed his eyes and leaned his head back with a breathy moan. Turning and looping one leg around the pole before shooting Sherlock yet another saucy glance over his shoulder. Appreciating the way his Adam’s apple bobbed as the dark haired man swallowed.
A way out.
John jumped to help, but was stilled by a sickeningly familiar voice trilling in his head. A sing-songy voice with a soft lilt.
Currently, Sherlock knows that John only holds one more Nuisance Coupon of the twenty he’d been issued last Christmas. He even knows that John keeps it tucked away in his wallet. But he isn’t sure if he’s ready to make more of them, especially now that he's seen first-hand the way John hoards them away for “special occasions.”
In the span of what seemed like a blink, John was completely undressed except for his socks, which he shucked with a small hop, and Sherlock had only succeeded in getting his trousers and pants around his thighs before he’d succumbed to the urge to press two fingers inside himself. And this, of course, was the picture he presented back to John Watson in payback for the accidental striptease.
“That’s my child,” John said, jabbing a finger in the air toward Sherlock’s flat. “Upstairs in your flat, with your landlady.
"It'll be alright, love," John said as he sat down. "It might take some time to get there, but it'll be worth it, yeah?"
“Have you thought about looking into the system from the surgery?”
"I have to get ready for work," he said, gently dropping a hand atop Sherlock's silk-clad shoulder and squeezing. "I'm not saying this conversation is over, but I really am going to need to think about this on my own a bit."
I could very well spend myself right here, right now, thrusting aimlessly against his tie with my hand around his wet prick. But he seems to understand the risk, and once my hand has taken a full tour of his anatomy, he slowly pulls my arm away, lowering me back down with intention.
John rubbed his face with one hand and adjusted his clothes, ready to duck out of the shop with his head down and his hands in his pockets. No one would know what he'd just done, outside the obvious wank.
Inch by glorious inch, John stretched him from the inside out. Sherlock could hear him breathing, could feel the familiar fingers gripping at his hip, pulling him back as the older man moved forward. The stinging from his spanks amplified his sensitivity, and once John was completely seated inside Sherlock's body, the hands on his hips trailed down to his cheeks to knead them further apart.
John took a few tentative steps closer, eventually crouching down in the space between the coffee table and the couch. He was holding the bumblebee teddy in one hand, and reached for Annabelle with the other.
He began to plant small kisses against Sherlock's jawline, smiling against him when those long fingers began to twist into his hair to draw him closer.
His efforts to sleep alone had been aborted after an hour of reading, followed by tossing and turning.
It wasn't as easy in real life. He couldn't take the whole thing, but he made up for it by swallowing around what he could manage, by hollowing out his cheeks the way John so loved in his dreams. His tongue worked at the underside, and he let his lover lead him with his hands, occasionally pulling away and leaving Sherlock empty just long enough to endearingly stroke his cheek or to run the tip of his penis over Sherlock's lips, glossing them with his precome.
John scrubbed his hands over his face. He wanted to reply back that the cycle would still be continuing when he got home, but there was something about the fact that he was getting a text in the middle of the day that was urging him home for sex that was especially tempting.
, John thought as Sherlock shrugged off his shirt and tossed it aside.
Sherlock's tongue was exploring the roof of his mouth, slipping behind the flats of his front teeth when the man stiffened suddenly and nearly dropped John to he floor in his haste to get away.
Wants it to last. Needs to see him,
The blistering was sore in the way that a dead man’s wound wouldn’t have been, a dull ache that served as a constant reminder that there was someone out there feeling for him. Someone who had, perhaps, awakened in the middle of the night to a burning pain and watched as the numbers practically boiled out of her skin--and then stopped.
“I want you to flip me over,” I whisper in his ear, letting myself give in to the urge to nibble at his ear. “I want you to turn me over and take what you need.”
“Your sample had been used.”
I know what a suit feels like, of course. I wear them almost exclusively—they’re my personal brand of armor. But here is a soldier in front of me, unarmed, his breath slowly going heavy with the implication of my hand on his hip, sliding below the suit jacket to curl around his flank, just barely separated from his skin by the soft cotton of his dress shirt.
The stranger had barely taken a breath while John stared, but when he was finished, a small smile formed on his lips. He held out his left hand from too-long coat sleeves. “The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is two-two-one B Baker Street.”
Sherlock is a git, John has a rather relaxing bath, and Molly's new boyfriend pays a visit to Hogwarts's.
He didn’t ask, he just fetched.
“Leave it out this time,” he said.
Jim was the unsuspected bird of prey.
Instead, he just wanted to calm Sherlock down and talk it out logically. It was normal to feel some level of panic, he was sure. They hadn’t planned for two children. They’d probably not even planned enough for
Still, he looked at Stamford, praying for some sort of elaborate prank, but the man in the colorful tie just smiled as if he was expecting John to understand it all someday.
“Don’t you think I should get to judge that?” John asked.
“Can I keep the magunifying lens until we get home? In case there are more flowers I wan’to see?”
Still can’t look at him. Looks older, even just out of the corner of his eye. John knows that if he looks straight on, if he tries to engage the detective directly, the man will be gone. Vanish. Thin air.
while he had you under?"
Sherlock’s list, expectedly, is less structured and slightly more demanding. He’s simply made a list of six experiments he’d like to conduct in the next few months and the bits he’ll need for each one. Last year, John managed to get him a set of ten fingers--each one from a different person! He’s curious to see if John can get him a similar arrangement of toes, so of course he’s put them on his list in addition to multiple corrosive-yet-surprisingly-child-safe chemicals.
His left hand reached around and fought with the silk gown for a moment before he was able to stroke Sherlock's thickening cock, waiting to potentially be batted away at any moment, but Sherlock didn't fight him. He simply spread his legs further so John's cock nudged at his entrance of its own accord and then set his hands on the counter.
"One day it won't be enough." Her voice was very nearly echoing now. "One day, we'll be standing around a body, and Sherlock Holmes will be the one who put it there."
“Still, the moment you saw me in person you knew you’d made the right choice.” Sherlock crawled onto the bed and over John on hands and knees. He leaned close for a moment, just letting his lips linger over his husband’s. “It was my lips that sealed the deal,” Sherlock breathed. “You couldn’t wait to get me to this hotel so you could put me on my knees.”
"Oh fucking-- oh
The man had been castrated and left to bleed out, but the room only had one window and had been locked from the inside. Your typical "How is this possible?" case that Sherlock would solve just as soon as his brain stopped swimming with opportunity.
"Ah." Sherlock stood. "Then I suppose you're in no fit state to accompany me to the Ministry?"
John stared, his lips parted. It was a long moment before he managed anything, and when he did, all he could say was: "That was bloody fantastic."
It had been three days since they'd last had sex, since Sherlock had read online that it was best to wait a few days in between "normal trying" and "ovulation trying." Apparently he thought of them as two different sorts of sex, but John was having none of it.
“Come for me, love,” John gasped. “Show me how good I make you feel.”
Now that Sherlock could look back at it without the haze of his heat impeding his deductions, he could see the signs: John had been reminded of his unexpected spawn while thinking of Sherlock gone gravid. He clearly wanted children. And even without having to go through pregnancy again, Sherlock had the ability to give him that. He could answer an unanswered question--he could solve John's greatest mystery.
Sherlock knows that Hamish likes to open large gifts, so he’d made sure to find a decently sized garment box for the tiny pair of footed jim-jams when he’d been doing the wrapping. It’s no surprise when the little boy gravitates toward the large box and immediately turns the card over. There, in the elegant scrawl of the man in red (Well, Lestrade--they’d needed handwriting Hamish wouldn’t recognize), is Hamish’s name.
Long fingers wrapped around the base to keep steady as Sherlock’s head bobbed slowly, taking more with each downward stroke until he let his hand slip down and away. It was only a few moments before Sherlock was bravely taking John to the root, pressing nose to navel.
Sherlock stepped closer, reaching up a hand as though he was going to touch the shorter man, but then he drew his hand away, clasping his fingers behind his back.
But then those fingers appeared again, holding a small, folded note.
John thought at the spark of hope that flickered across his mind. Morning sickness wouldn't kick in until at least four weeks in most cases, and Sherlock had taken tests every two weeks. He wouldn't have gotten four bad tests.
” is an understatement.
She hadn't disappointed.
John's arms were above his head, sliding around the black wall, feeling every nub and odd texture in the wood, wishing he could grip hot skin and settling for the impersonal booth. He wondered what the other man looked like, if he was tall enough to bend over in the booth and brace himself against the opposite wall, if he was too short and had to stand on tiptoe to get fucked at the wall's opening.
Still, he was intrigued. None of this information was public, nor had he told anyone he was being considered for the positions. He was sure that the dark-haired man would inform him of how he knew in just a moment, as soon as the Holmes brothers were through with their glaring. Those high cheekbones looked positively sharp in the dim lighting, as if he could cut through his brother with a single twist of his neck.
John snapped it away and gave a terse nod to the two men behind the counter. He lifted the overnight bag from the floor where he’d set it and slung it over one shoulder. What did you say in a situation like this? He wasn’t sure. There was still a special kind of rage boiling in his stomach, causing tension in his shoulders that would probably make him sleep poorly. He had a few choice words still on reserve, but in the end he settled for:
His hands cup my face and he pulls me upward, so I follow, pressing our cocks together as he claims my mouth. His tongue dips between my lips, hungry, and our groans are in unison as he tastes himself on me. I can’t remember the last time I felt this filthy, like my sole purpose in the world was to please John Watson.
Hamish doesn’t need another word of encouragement. Stark naked, he drops to the rug and tears at the paper, tossing the lid off the box just as quickly as he discards the wrapping. The shoulders of the pyjamas are folded neatly under a layer of tissue paper and Hamish plucks them from the box.
wanted.
His eyes shoot up to mine when I give a tentative thrust of my hips, enjoying the way his trousers drag against the skin on my inner thighs, under my balls. His hands on my naked hips begin to guide me as I move into a slow bounce, totally in control of the amount of his cock that moves inside me, not letting him get enough traction to take control.
The man never shut up. He had once legitimately floundered for air while delivering a deduction because he had neglected to take a breath. How could he
John ushers the excited tot off to clean his teeth and Sherlock looks back at the Christmas tree.
John looked down at where Sherlock's hands were almost shaking within his own, wrists held tightly, willingly, and the white plastic was barely visible in the non-existent lighting, but why else would Sherlock wake him up with such enthusiasm?
"You're a right git, you know that?" John asked as he spread a slimy glob of blue concoction over the gash at Sherlock's temple.
"We need you to find out what happened that night, John," Lestrade said, stepping forward farther and putting a hand on the side of the elder Holmes's desk. "We don't know how dangerous Moriarty is, just that he's been behind all these murders and schemes, and Sherlock isn't willing to cooperate. If we can't figure out how to stop him, more people will die."
, Sherlock thought.
Lips again, now on his left shoulder, sucking a spot into the flesh just above his collarbone. Sherlock tugged at his restraints and tried not to whimper. It was pathetic of him to
That was all Sherlock required.
“Don’t.” I catch his hand where it rests against the imperfect knot (he should’ve asked me to tie it before he left), holding his eyes with an intensity I know he’ll be able to read. His blue eyes are questioning, but there’s certainly a hint of heated interest behind them. A question of exactly where this might be going. And a bit of “
"What's that, then?"
“Of course,” Sherlock replies, as if he has any choice. He enjoys telling the boy stories, but it’s hard to keep Hamish believing in fairy tales when he’s seen the harsh realities of the world. Occupational hazard.
I quickly take in the careful lines of his new suit, purchased for this occasion, the creases from where he’s been sitting at the service, the way the charcoal grey brings out the ocean blue in his eyes, the faded watermark where a relative cried on his shoulder. From top to bottom, he’s remarkably handsome in a bespoke sort of way.
John was still laying between his legs, fully clothed. The conflicting textures were driving him mad when his greatest desire was for skin on skin. He wondered if he'd get that in this dream.
“Check your records, Mycroft. There was an error. I’m sure of it. Annabelle’s Alpha is walking around London right now, and I fully expect you and your
“Can I?” John asked with a gentle tug to Sherlock’s hips. When he nodded his approval, his curls fell forward into his eyes, making him look positively debauched with his swollen lips and flushed cheeks. Not needing further permission, John began to slowly thrust his hips up, meeting in the middle on his lover’s down.
“Sherlock.” John swallows the last of his doubt. Buckles forward, clutches, sobs. Arms envelop him like a human shock blanket. He has so many questions. Hows and whys and an unending stream of curses that he wants to release on his friend. Wants to punch him so hard, his hand is actually tingling in anticipation of connection. The bastard. Brilliant, insufferable bastard.
“Did the two of you have a little domestic?” she asked. She walked over to the kettle, opening it to check for fingers or charred hair. When she deemed it acceptably clean (honestly, why would he defile his own kettle?) she filled it at the sink before flipping it on. “Is he nervous about meeting her?”
“You feel so good,” he pants, wheezing, and I answer him with a needy backwards push.
The doctor was moving toward the bed, obviously taking in the details one by one, looking for every instance of consent before he would venture to touch his living dream.
I wonder what I must look like—on my knees, completely naked in front of this gorgeously pressed man in a charcoal suit, my head bobbing at his groin. I keep my eyes open and directed upwards as I work his cock between my lips, opening wider and taking him deeper as he hardens, meeting his full potential on my eager tongue.
The game was on.
“Sherlock--”
Without meaning to, John let his eyes move from Sherlock's face to the empty goblet across the room. Sherlock's gaze followed and he released John a second later, practically tearing through the air to get to the empty cup. John watched, mostly disinterested--he hadn't died, so it couldn't have been that bad--as Sherlock picked up the goblet with shaking hands.
Fortunately, Sherlock took a deep breath, paused, and started over. “I’ve never... told anyone.”
Sherlock nodded. “He would’ve figured it out as soon as he was in the flat--she smells of him. I needed to tell him before.”
That was when it clicked for Sherlock; when his eyes widened almost imperceptibly and he took another step forward, turning in a small circle and looking around the room as he did so. John's action switched, and suddenly he was slapping himself in the side of the face.
"You stay behind," Sherlock said. His eyes searched the room for a moment, and John couldn't help thinking that the other man looked like a giraffe, towering above everyone else in the room, neck craning. "Angelo!" he called when he spotted the keeper.
For the briefest moment, John thought those clear eyes flickered over to him.
“What about a flatshare?” Sherlock recognized the second voice as Mike Stamford. Mike was a Beta Sherlock had interacted with semi-regularly over the years. He was reasonably certain that Mike harbored no ill will toward him, even though Sherlock was never exactly friendly with the man. But then, who
The stranger moaned around him, a low, deep, unmistakable sound that went straight to John's balls, heat pooling there and going straight up his spine.
It had been less than 48 hours since their last meeting--and barely a fortnight since their chance encounter at Bart’s. Perhaps a dinner invitation was all Sherlock needed to extricate himself from the budding relationship--best to nip it now, in person, so he could gauge the man’s reaction. If he took it well, if he was understanding, then Sherlock could move on with his life without having to look over his shoulder.
“Please,” Sherlock gasped, baring his neck and upping the tempo. The closer they got to the peak, the less John would be of mind to refuse. He'd be exactly where Sherlock wanted him.
John didn't imagine it would take long like this, and when the man on the other slide of the wall slipped his tongue beneath the folds of his foreskin to touch at the hidden head, John's hips jerked and he could feel the pooling of arousal in the pit of his stomach.
The friction of his shirtfront against my back sends sympathetic curls of electricity through my body, shooting directly to my cock like pleasure-inducing static. I want to get a hand on myself, but I resist, instead choosing to set my arms out in front of me to give myself the leverage to help him fuck me.
John stared at the darkness in front of him, wondering why he wasn't allowed to see the man when he had so perfectly been able to
John looked back at Sherlock, who had straightened and was considering the people around him with one of his silent, observant gazes that made John wish he could share some kind of telepathic uplink with the man just to understand what went on in his head, even for a minute.
John chuckled and rolled onto his back, eyes half-lidded. “Of course I don’t want to sleep through it, you ridiculous madman. But I do like the sound of you climbing on board.” His cock was already thickening and filling out, despite its overuse in the last day and a half, and Sherlock got up on his knees. He watched John reach for the small plastic case that held his mouthguard, and stopped him.
“Mr. Watson--”
"We're going to the Three Broomsticks," Sherlock announced suddenly. His chair nearly flipped back with the speed at which he stood.
Annabelle smiled up at her before turning her attention back to the puzzle she held in her small hands. Sherlock watched her rapt concentration as she twisted and turned the cube to get a silver ball from one hole to another. The dress she was wearing--a purple floral pattern with pink and blue flowers covered by a yellow cardigan, all over hot pink tights she’d picked out herself, would’ve been perfect for John’s arrival with the bee teddy. Sherlock could already picture John kneeling down to hand her the toy, the way she’d stare up at him with those big, blue eyes, fascinated by the familiar smell of him even though he was new to her. He wondered if she’d know right away, or if it would take her time to acclimate to him, to trust him.
“That’s brilliant.”
He shoved his trousers and pants down, kicking them away so they were on the floor, wrapped around one ankle. After all, remembering last time, all he'd wanted to do was spread his legs for more leverage. This time, he'd have it.
John's mouth fell open and he rushed to come up with some sort of excuse, but he found that he had none. He didn't remember anything past Tuesday evening, when he'd gone on patrol. Hadn't he just come back to his chambers? Or had he been dragged off somewhere with Sherlock? There was nothing.
Suddenly, John pulled out of Sherlock's mouth, something he'd never done in their shared dreams, and Sherlock opened his mouth wantonly to let him know it was okay to come inside. In fact, Sherlock wanted it.
He pressed a button on the monitor and watched it come to life, giving him different options. Amateur, Big Tits, Asian, Blonde, anything to suit his fancy. But he was still having trouble coming to terms that he'd set foot into the adult entertainment store, and it was even harder to wrap his head around the fact that he'd willingly set foot into one of their video booths.
He hadn’t needed his little right toe, anyway. What a tedious thing it had been.
A small smile crept over his lips. The elf disappeared and John turned to his quarters, surveying his room in this castle he'd come to call home all those years ago. He didn't know what Sherlock Holmes wanted from him, but this was what he'd missed during all of his training and time at St. Mungo's: the thrill of being in the castle, no matter what it had to offer him.
