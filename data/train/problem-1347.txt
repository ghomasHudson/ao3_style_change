Holmes had been working on a case while I was thus occupied, though he refused to share with me any details. So it came about that he suggested, being himself too busy to travel to Lausanne and track down the missing lady and given my own state of exhaustion, that a short holiday might be exactly what I needed.
“I fell deeply in love with Annie but I had yet to gather up the courage to ask her if she would consent to pledge her life to me. One night, Joseph came to meet me, as he often did, and we went to my club, where we ate dinner and shared a bottle of wine. Anticipating his joyful congratulations, I told him of my intentions towards his sister. To my surprise, he turned quite pale. He seemed deeply shocked and left soon afterwards without offering me any words of advice or congratulation. That weekend, he had arranged to come down to Woking. Annie was to join us on Sunday for the day. I had determined to speak with her then. On Friday, to my relief, Joseph met me at my office as usual and we took the 9 o’clock train. We did not speak of our last meeting. At home, we opened a bottle of brandy and sat in front of the fire and began to speak idly of this and that. I was reassured to find that his humour had returned and he seemed quite himself again. Several times he topped up our glasses and eventually, after several pleasant hours, I took myself off to bed, somewhat unsteady on my feet. I awoke to find him kissing me.”
We were in the grounds of a wealthy client whom Holmes had not twelve hours earlier saved from a gruesome and decidedly painful death. I had expected us to depart for London after breakfast. Only now was I beginning to see why Holmes had insisted on exploring the gardens before our departure. In the six months since I had declared myself his, in every way I knew how to be, he had ceased to intimidate or discomfort me, but he had never stopped surprising me.
Wainwright leaned forward and began to tug at the pile of fabric that lay atop my friend, still partially concealing his form. What I had taken to be a pile of rags revealed itself to be a heap of men’s clothing, stained and dirty and torn but originally of fine quality.
“What business of mine? I’m sorry. I forgot I’m just a convenient stooge to make you tea and pay half the rent and occasionally point a gun at someone for you. Never mind the fact that I love you. I should just let you embark on suicidal experiments that serve no possible purpose other than satisfying your fucking insatiable curiosity.”
It’s a brilliant case. Sherlock gets to do a night-time stake out and there’s a mad plastic surgeon with a poker and a paralytic designed to mimic the effects of snake venom. The bit with the snake doesn’t go quite as planned, admittedly. But in the end, Sherlock’s lying on the floor clutching the twin puncture marks on his ankle and groaning with pain that’s only partly feigned and John is crouching over him, fingers pressed to his throat so hard it hurts as he tries to take Sherlock’s pulse while speaking so frantically that Sherlock’s certain he can’t possibly be counting at the same time.
I had never heard him defend anyone so vociferously, particularly someone he had set himself against.
The exercise was intended to shed some light upon the mystery of Holmes’ profession, yet over the course of a week it had strayed further and further from this goal and I began to fear that it revealed more about myself than about Holmes. Having recorded his knowledge of various topics and executed a careful study of his daily habits, I found myself beginning to stray into more subjective territory. A second list, detailing his physical attributes, ran in this way:
I felt Holmes’ warm hand clasp my shoulder in silent approval as we left the inspector to process his catch and turned our steps towards Baker Street.
Dawn was breaking when the delirium lifted, and I knew at last that I was in Baker Street. I was lying atop the bed, naked in the cold winter air, my shoulder aching and burning as it had in the weeks after my injury. When I turned my head in search of my watch, hoping that I had remembered to wind it the night before, I saw Holmes lying beside me. His eyes, as pale and brilliant as sunshine on snow, were fixed on me. I stared at him for several long seconds, believing – hoping – that I was still in the throes of the fever.
“Joseph was the thief!” Phelps cried, when Holmes finished his story, and I saw that he had turned quite white. “All that time, it was he who had taken the treaty. He knew that the papers were in the very room with me as I lay raving and insensible with fever.”
After eliciting a promise that Whitney, as well as myself and Holmes, should present ourselves at the station in the morning to issue formal statements, the inspector led Wainwright, who was ranting and cursing, incoherent with anger, down the narrow staircase, bound for the cells where he had so recently taken Holmes. Only when the sound of their footsteps had faded did Holmes relax. As soon as he did so, he staggered and half fell against the open door. I was there in a moment, my arms around his thin frame, all skin and bone, as he slumped in exhaustion. For a moment, I forgot the presence of Whitney and the very grave dangers that faced us both if I ever I lost sight of the amiable, passionless façade we must adopt in public.
I had stopped walking. We stood facing each other in the first feeble spitting of the rain, tension reverberating between us.
Holmes did not speak. I had not expected him to. But he pulled me roughly to him so that my head came to rest in the angle of his shoulder and tightened one arm around me where I lay against his side.
Suddenly, after what can only have been hours but felt like weeks, I heard a clatter and the sudden strike and flare of a match. Holmes was on his feet, his face twisted with horror and disgust, striking wildly with his cane at the bell-pull beside the bed. I rushed forward, confused and terrified for his safety, but as I drew close he thrust me away from him so forcefully that I stumbled and almost fell.
Since the night that matters between Holmes and I had first escalated to a physical level, I had not seen him inject either morphine or cocaine, and I had begun to hope that his drug use was a more infrequent occurrence than the plethora of marks on his arms seemed to suggest. It helped that he had had a steady stream of clients and that, as a consequence, we had been occupied almost every day with one case or another – sometimes more than one at a time. My stories of Holmes’ remarkable methods, and his success in solving problems that had proved too complex or bizarre even for the inspectors of Scotland Yard to crack, had, to my secret chagrin, not been met with praise by Holmes. He claimed to find my style florid, my language melodramatic, my attention to important detail lacking and my depictions of both of us unrealistic and unflattering. But they had succeeded in attracting several new clients, most of whom came to him as a port of first call when they felt that something was amiss that was unlikely to be treated with much seriousness by the police.
“What scratches? My watch has no scratches.” Taking it from my pocket and unfastening the chain, I flourished it at him across the table.
“Then we must return to Baker Street today,” he said. “I could not very well include the reason for my question in a wire but you shall have it now, as it is the detail on which the whole affair hinges. It proves that, as I feared, Lady Carfax has become entangled with an exceptionally dangerous couple, a fake missionary and his wife who prey on lonely ladies. If they got wind of the fact that Lady Carfax is in possession of jewellery worth a small fortune, there is little doubt that they made her their next target. They will stop at nothing to make the decision worth their while.”
John drifts off to sleep, twenty five minutes later, tucked into Sherlock’s side with one warm hand lying heavy on Sherlock’s bare, bruised chest. Sherlock lies awake, breathing in the scent of sweat and sex and thinking about the three words that had briefly derailed his brain.
I was very glad, then, that he could not see my face. I had my answer, and Holmes would never know how much it pained me to learn that he considered all that we had shared the previous night to be nothing more than a passing interlude.
Inspector Jones was so crestfallen when we emerged from the cellar with the two men, my revolver trained on them as Holmes gripped each by the upper arm in his pincer-like fingers, that when I told him – quite untruthfully – that we had missed his presence below and suggested that, in my dramatic retelling of the tale, I write him into the scene, so as to lend the affair a more official flavour, he agreed at once.
So why the egg? Metaphorically, it was easy enough to spot, but surely, he could’ve picked better for the actual object than a random oval shaped piece of rock. He was at a loss.
John wanted to say that, but he knew there was no real point. Sherlock didn’t take note of such things…even if he had actually remembered details about the episode…
Out of the corner of his eye – for more than one reason, he hadn’t much wish to turn his head while he was moving to look at it – he saw it and recognised it for what it was; greed.
If only it was. Of course, if it had been easy, then there would likely as not have been an issue in the first place. Then Sherlock would’ve bee more than able to keep his inner dragon, as it were, in check and he could’ve just got on with…
He smiled at the other, trying to show his gratitude without saying anything. He got a brief but answering smile.
Of course, it didn’t exactly help his mental faculties that he was being given a hug by John. It derailed him just a little.
John got the point. “Ah. Right. Should’ve figured.” He took a deep breath, possibly in deliberation.
The Omega sank down into a crouch, managing it relatively smoothly despite his added…girth on his front, not to mention that one hand was still being cradled by her.
He felt a hand on his cheek and instinctively jerked back from it, afraid of touching, just in case it brought something forth that he’d just pushed down.
“It’ll keep at gossip, John. You’re not the important part in that story, you’re just a means to an end to get to a colleague that isn’t liked.”
He watched carefully then and breathed an internal sigh of relief when it seemed that John believed him, beyond merely not arguing the point with him.
As he thought this, there was an almighty screech, as the dying screams of metal being pulled apart at the seams with force. He looked down to his tenuous grip on the statue and gun and saw that, rather than melting as the jade was still in the process of, the metal of the gun was in fact coming apart at the seams, splintering like a brittle piece of wood from the muzzle inward.
Another followed right on its heels, of John wearing the ring, as casual and natural as anything. Sherlock’s heart squeezed something terrible at that. Still, it couldn’t hold a candle to the image of their hands, entwined, rings shining against each other.
“Point,” the blond said, smiling softly. He looked over the length of the body on the floor. “You figured it out yet, then?”
One might almost say that while Sherlock’s reaction to the other Alpha had grown more pronounced since last time, John’s had grown more subdued. That it was a deliberate move, without a doubt, had nothing to do with it.
“Hardly, I’m just being an arse, and when you’ve been…well, without you, I’m not sure we’d have something like a relationship. I definitely wouldn’t have been alive, which I suppose is a dampener on the relationship…”
What if that wasn’t enough? What if Moriarty’s blasted meddling, whatever his reasoning for it, wasn’t the end of it? Mycroft had suggested as much earlier, even if he had claimed not to know enough about it to be definitive. But regardless, it seemed a growing likelihood that there is, that even if they fix this, Sherlock won’t wake.
It wasn’t a mistake. If it were anything, it was the best possible decision he could’ve made in his life, even if he hadn’t consciously made it, and he wouldn’t take it back for anything. He did believe that. Believed it with all of his poorly constructed, messed-up heart.
Sherlock let himself be guided up into standing and then led out of the kitchen, through the living room and into their shared bedroom. It wasn’t overly late and certainly, it would be exceedingly early for bed for the two of them, but nevertheless, he agreed to John’s quiet suggestion that they made an early night of it and just…stayed close.
All through it, neither Moriarty nor Moran said anything or moved, apart from the latter’s physical warning to the woman.
That attempt seemed to be successful, though, as after a moment, the whole body relaxed. Not entirely but enough so that to the causal eye it would appear as though nothing was the matter.
John sighed. At least they didn’t go with ‘he started it’. Not that what they went with was a whole lot better, but still…
“Don’t do that on my account. It’s not as if I don’t know you smoke,” the blond commented with a raised eyebrow and a nod towards the ground.
,” Mycroft continued, glaring at both of them in turn, the fire evident in his eyes and the steel in his voice. “I will
In three long steps he was beside him, dropping down on his knees in front of the piece of furniture, still somehow careful to avoid the wing, nudging it aside with his hand even as he sank down.
“I’ll protect you from those.” As he spoke, he looked back down at what he was doing, his fingers worked frantically at the rope bindings and the fastenings of the vest, haste and panic making them clumsy. They were coming off, though, but not for the first time, he dearly wished that his wings and tail had digits or at least were more prehensile.
now, relative speaking, at least. Even the curve of his belly had yet to take on the tell-tale firm roundness of a pregnancy, at least not so much that, with a jacket over it, it couldn’t pass for a bit of a potbelly.
Looking at him out of the corner of his eye confirmed that; though he was still holding Sherlock’s hand, the rest of his body language screamed arms crossed, leaned back a little, eyebrows raised; take your shot, mate, go ahead, I’m not going to stumble or even flinch.
No! No, that was nothing but momentary panic, creating a link between two almost entirely separate things that in reality was non-existent, spun out of the fears and grief that entwined the thought of his daughter so thoroughly they were no longer entirely separable.
Put it back where he’d found it or where he knew it likely that John would’ve placed it himself in a moment of cognitive failure, and then make it out to be just that but not to worry, that happened to everyone, except him, of course?
On the way there, he’d grabbed his clothes, though, as well as both their phones, which had been left in the room earlier, just to make sure that he would have enough battery to call Mycroft and get a proper explanation.
As they share in the joy of two babies rather than one, John is hit with a dose of reality as he considers the cost of ensuring they make it into the world - plus the cost of everything else he needs and they will need. Sherlock tries to help and reassure, in his own way, but John's stubborn when he wants to be. Meanwhile, Mycroft carries on his promised investigation into several things.
“No, not…well, yes. I mean, it’s not as though I’m good at…but this is still too much by bleeding half.”
All of that said, something twisted inside of him at the thought of leaving her out like that, however much it made sense.
“You slept soundly enough that you didn’t even stir when I left the bed, whatever your subconscious might have registered about my movements.”
He was allowed to sit down on the bed without help and looked up at his bond mate with a smile. “I know it’s a bit early, but it seems like I’m somewhat all over the place, really, and might do well to listen to my body for a change, eh?” He squeezed the hand in his in lieu of a kiss. “Thank you, love, and goodnight.”
She didn’t get more than a few steps, however, hesitant and small, out of the embrace the Omega’s crouch offered before she stopped. Another unhappy noise of confusion escaped her as she turned and looked back at John, her eyes going to his scent gland, then his face.
It slipped out before he’d had time to think about it and as soon as it did, he could’ve kicked himself for it.
“Of course, I want you to!” Sherlock snapped. “Don’t start being obtuse out of some misplaced notion of chivalry or whatever it is you think you’re doing. What exactly about all of this gives you the impression that I wouldn’t want you to? That I wouldn’t want to spend all the time I could possibly snatch to have your fingers all over me? Inside of me? My tongue all over you, learning all about the texture of your skin, the smell and taste of it? Whether there’s a difference between my human tongue and my dragon one? Whether I could wrap the dragon version all the way around your penis?”
“I fail to see how this differs significantly from what else we’ve discussed, none of which you seemed to have particular problem with discussing.”
Sherlock’s thumb started caressing the outside of the hand he was holding. It was a small gesture but one that he found unexpectedly helpful, and not just for him, either.
“Okay, fair enough. If it’s a back-and-forth, though, doesn’t that make us more susceptible to mood swings and…other such instances?” Sherlock didn’t need to hear it to know what was being alluded to. “Especially with the pregnancy, it’s almost inevitable that there’ll be some. That’s not saying that I don’t think you can control yourself or your instincts will rule you, or me. Not at all, because I fully believe you can, and they won’t. But – “
“Because I…” John sighed as he thought it through. Beside him, Sherlock shifted and tightened the grip he had on the blond slightly but otherwise it didn’t seem like he was waking up. Thankfully. “I suppose it’s easier to ascribe it to something dragon rather than something human, somehow, even though it probably ought to be the other way around. Does that even make sense?”
He didn’t know but he tried to push his cheek into the hand that had only just begun to drop, trying to make up for his mistake.
The voice didn’t rise or change, nor did the head turn towards him, as the former soldier cut him off. “Shut up, Sherlock. Just, for once in your life, shut up. People have
“Love or hate. You don’t breed middle ground, Sherlock. Well, okay, there’s like and dislike but it’s still strong either one or the other. That’s not the kind of personality you entice people with, and yet, I still love you, and I’d say I know you well enough to know that you would be in control of it.”
His feelings must’ve showed on his face despite his efforts because John’s own face fell a little and he walked quickly over to him, wrapping his arms around him, despite the fact that there were bags in the way, and holding on tight.
He was still bound and therefore, he couldn’t grab hold of Moriarty. That didn’t stop him, as he instead chose to barrel into the man, hoping to knock him over. He managed to do so, Sherlock letting go of the hand he held in the process, but by momentum, he went over as well.
Slowly, the rest of what had happened started to clarify in his brain like so much soup and though he’d been at that point where he was just awake enough to have his brain running, albeit on energy-saving state, and yet asleep enough that he could still slip easily back into temporary oblivion, he was now wide awake.
Probably to be able to fulfil the purpose of courting within a relatively short time period that doesn’t risk something not being fully developed. It would make sense to have it that way, anyway. It was probably for the best not to mention that out loud, seeing how he’d reacted before.
Even if it wouldn’t be like that, though, he wouldn’t have expected it to be this kind of a mess. Not kidnappings by Irish Alpha criminal madmen and their thuggish Alpha lackeys.
This wasn’t – there was still so much he hadn’t said. Why did the stupid lid have to pop open before he was ready for it to?
Which really was an apt metaphor for how an Alpha really ought to be. Well, for part of how one ought to be, that was. There were always more nuances to bear in mind and more aspects that applied in different situations, but it was a good aspect to keep in mind.
“Sherlock?” he asked, hoping that this sudden reaction did at least mean that his friend was conscious again. He wasn’t certain because he couldn’t see the face, which was turned down towards the pillow and his chest.
Though they were speaking on the phone rather than in person, the mutual, growing understanding and the respect on another level that had been fostered between them in their race to save Sherlock from the poisoning, was still something that hung between them, unsaid but felt.
The vehemence in the statement surprised the brunet and he blinked at the other teen, a little thrown.
For such a purpose, the watch was quite simply perfect; not only did it hold significance to John and was therefore very firmly tied to him, it was, due to the amount of wear it had seen, embedded with his scent, in the leater strap, like few other of his belongings were.
He paused, as though he was waiting for Sherlock to stop him, or possibly correct him. The younger Holmes said nothing, however, so he continued.
As it turned out, he could do more by just holding it, which was – well, for one thing, it was time-consuming. Wasteful, even, but he had little option and so had to put up with it. So long as it destroyed the object, and the way in through it, then he could live with having to stand and contemplate –
I awoke late the following morning to find that Holmes had already breakfasted and was making ready to go out. I saw his eyes take in my unruly hair, which I had not yet taken the time to tame, and flicker briefly to the mottled skin of my wrists. The smile that touched his lips echoed the happiness in my own heart and I had crossed the room and kissed him on his shapely lips before I could think twice about such an intimate gesture and what it might convey. Although it broke the unspoken pact we seemed to have adopted to save our illicit activities for the hours of darkness, he did not pull away and we shared a warm, lingering kiss by the door, Holmes holding his hat in one hand, about to depart. When it was over, he met my rapidly darkening eyes with a knowing look.
Well, no, that was true, but Moriarty wasn’t his best friend. Sherlock was. It was someone you ought to know, wasn’t it? If you called someone your best friend, you’d know…perhaps not everything about them, but certainly the important things, and whether you were a ruddy dragon or not ought to bloody well be among the important things!
Another part, a far more practical part, knew that at least getting out of this whole commitment wasn’t going to happen, if for no other reason than he believed Mr. Duffy would make good on his threat. To have broken his promise to stop smoking wouldn’t make his parents amenable to pay for university, never mind sending him there a year early, and Mycroft, the cake-addict bastard, would make sure they didn’t renege on it, no matter what Sherlock did.
But then, he’d been focused on getting to the clinic and what that appointment might bring, for good or ill. In any case, they hadn’t been out much between Baker Street and the clinic, Sherlock managing to hail a cab almost instantly.
It would also be wrong to say that it was now that he’d stepped into character, because that would relegate him back to being a help to his brother, what he could do for him rather than something in himself, and while that wasn’t the most pertinent or immediately important in the current circumstances, it was important in understanding Mycroft Holmes a little bit better. Not much, probably, but even so.
It was Sherlock’s turn to nod. “And nothing will happen, to the Alpha woman or to Tessa, before we get there.” He stopped, then amended, “So long as we do not reach a point where Moriarty gets bored, of course.”
Her focus immediately shifted over to the other hand. John still didn’t move, though his eyes followed her keenly as she went over, picked up his hand, turned it, studied it for a moment, then traced her finger along his palm until she came to the wrist.
“But you can do it?” It was intended to be merely a question, but it came out with an edge of captain.
Even so, he found himself unwilling to disengage, if he could’ve done so. That said, he wasn’t exactly actively kissing back and when the tongue tried to push his lips open to gain access to his mouth, he did his best to prevent it.
Even so, though, the fact that he avoided it as studiously as that even when it would be a boon to a current situation – the ability of an Omega to soothe was known throughout the world and possibly as much carefully enhanced legend as anything, but even so – was something that Sherlock felt he needed to make a mental note of.
Something pinched at his ear. Automatically, he reached up to grab at whatever it had been. His hand came into contact with Sherlock’s, which grabbed his and refused to let go.
Closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration, he didn’t notice the small flutter of Sherlock’s closed eyelids.
He looked at John, waiting for a reaction, an answer. Any kind of answer would do, even if it was angry shouting.
“Very clever,” I said coldly, looking away from him as I closed my watch and placed it back in my pocket. More than my remorse at damaging a watch that had been passed down to me from my father, I was filled with shame that Holmes had known all along of my deplorable dependency.
“Not if you didn’t want to. I know how you feel about me. I also know that you’re smart. I knew you’d get there without my help.”
“Jesus,” John exhales. “Jesus. That fucking thing bit you. How poisonous is it, Sherlock? I know you know what species it was.”
“Well Watson, if you do not have any pressing matters to attend to, would you care to accompany me to Briony Lodge?” he asked. “I believe it is time to see what our opponent is made of and whether we shall be able to aid our client. I could use your help in carrying out a small scheme that should yield some conclusive results.”
I had never heard such a tone of admiration in his voice. Unworthy though it was, I began to hope most fervently that the case would be over quickly and that the beautiful Miss Adler would turn out to be far less interesting – and intelligent – than she seemed.
“I know that I risked everything for nothing,” I said, more softly. “I know that I should have consulted you before I tried to play the hero. I am sorry that I compromised your investigation. I'm sorry I wasn't able to save Lady Carfax. But it doesn't have to mean the end of our association. I beg you Holmes, do not end everything between us over one mistake.”
I had taken men before, but, just as Holmes was utterly unlike other men in almost every other conceivable sense, being inside him was as different an experience as swimming in a wild sea after a lifetime spent paddling in a peaceful lake. It was not just that I loved him, for I had loved one or two others in my time, or even that he did not love me – for that, too, I had experienced. Holmes was as strange and miraculous as I was ordinary. On his knees before me, he somehow seemed to be driving our encounter more surely than I, finding control even in surrender. I closed my eyes and laid my cheek against the broad plane of his back. Even inside him, I wanted to be closer, to draw our two bodies together until we became a single entity and I could lose myself within him, body and soul, and never return to myself.
Both of us moaned when Holmes finally pushed inside me and then his lips were at my ear and he was whispering to me as he thrust in slow, maddening circles, gripping me tightly by the hip.
“I fear that the conspiracy against me is more complicated than I was able express when I saw you and Mr Holmes yesterday. Last night, I slept without a nurse in the room for the first time. Since the fever, I sleep lightly – indeed, I cannot help it, for I fear falling back into those same endless cyclical nightmares that dogged me every hour of the night during my long weeks of illness. About two in the morning, I was aroused by a slight noise. It took me some few moments to realise that there was a man at the window. When my eyes adjusted, I realised that the face was a familiar one – it was Joseph.”
“Then I believe we shall have no problem in declaring the matter settled,” she said. She was still standing by the desk but now she walked towards Holmes, drawing from her garments a square envelope. "You will find the photograph inside,” she said. “I will wait while you examine it, if you wish.”
His face grew clouded for a moment and I felt a pang as I realised that – quite naturally, given the accusations I had hurled at him only a few minutes earlier – he had interpreted my words as a criticism. But then he smiled slyly.
“Whatever this supposed detective has accused me of, I have done nothing,” snarled Wainwright, turning to Bradstreet. “Inspector, Mr Holmes’ reputation aside, what evidence do you have that I have committed any wrongdoing? Allow me to assure you that these men have a vendetta against me, for what reason I know not, save perhaps that I prefer to work alone than with the interference of amateurs. Whatever they have told you, I am confident that it shall be easily disproven.”
I laughed, then, my anger forgotten for the moment. I was light-headed, almost dizzy at the turn the night had taken, and half wondered for a moment if I was dreaming.
“You don’t have to make me angry for me to say that. You – Sherlock, you idiot. Only you. You’re insane. Are you saying you…? Of course you did. You engineered all this. Why?”
“There is one talent of my own that I did not get a chance to display last night,” I murmured, beginning to slide slowly down the bed. Holmes’ pupils were dark, dilated with desire, and I pushed away the memory of their vacant morphine glaze as I worked my way down his torso, running my lips over lean muscle, enjoying the way he arched beneath me, seeking a firmer touch. It was my turn to tease, and I took my time, refusing to accede to the silent urging of his body as I nuzzled into the angular indentations around his pelvis. By the time I took him into my mouth, he was swollen and leaking with need and I relished the involuntary gasp he gave as I swirled my tongue around his not inconsiderable girth. Holmes may have deduced more than I had ever guessed about me, but I possessed certain skills that he could never have divined, given the nature of our friendship.
I realised I was staring at Holmes in a most undignified way, my mouth agape, but Phelps had risen to his feet with some effort, and crossed the room to clasp my friend’s hands.
“If it is emotion that has led him to wait nine weeks before seeking to recover the treaty I can hardly bring myself to join you in applauding it. Had he displayed more presence of mind following the theft, the treaty might have been recovered immediately. As it is, two months have passed and he is still so forlorn that he cannot pen his own correspondence and must call on the combined forces of his fiancée and his former lover to aid him in solving a problem of his own making.”
Holmes swallowed. He was lying on his back in my narrow bed, staring at the ceiling, and I could not see his eyes. Silently, I reached out and took hold of his hand. He entwined his long fingers with mine.
Back at Baker Street, Holmes had retired immediately to his bedroom. When he came out, he was dressed more smartly than was habitual. He left the flat immediately and did not come back until very late that night. I had already given up and retired when I heard his tread on the stairs below. Sometime later, I heard the mournful strains of his violin. I knew from the sound that attempting conversation would be futile. He was still playing when I fell into a fitful sleep and when I awoke, some hours later, drenched in sweat and shaking, my throat hoarse from shouting. If the nightmare had been as loud as I feared, he must have heard me. I lay stiffly for some minutes, listening for his tread on the stairs, but it never came. In the days since, he had spent much of his time from home, returning only sporadically to eat or sleep. I did not know if he had a case, for he had barely spoken two words to me, and I found myself loathe to begin a conversation that he so evidently wished to avoid. Prior to our bitter argument he had rarely spent time away from his books and experiments during daylight hours. Even at night, he often forewent sleep altogether or dozed fitfully on the sofa or in his chair, ready to spring into action should a case beckon. Now he spent what few hours he passed at Baker Street shut away.
“Your hands are shaking,” he said gently. “They do that only when you have not had a drink in more than a day. Having seen your watch before we took up residence together, it did not take long to notice the symptom or to deduce its cause.”
“I do,” I said, letting him hear the pain and longing in my voice. “I pretended for a long time that I didn’t. First to myself and then to you. But I have loved you for months. I never thought I had succeeded in keeping it from you.”
“Thank you, Mr Holmes. You are every bit the man that Watson assured me you were,” he said, and I coughed suddenly as the breath I had started to take caught in my lungs. Phelps continued quickly, “But I do not quite understand what drove Joseph to steal the treaty. I believed him to be my friend and I confess I was looking forward to counting him my brother-in-law.”
Even as protests rose to my lips and I glanced around reflexively, filled with a sudden fear that I'd be confronted with an unwelcome audience among the trees, I felt a flush of heat course though me. I made a valiant effort to disregard it.
The desire to help my old friend warred with my instinct to protect Holmes. It was clear that Phelps suspected an attachment between us. To confirm it would be to reveal nothing new about myself but to uncover something deeply private about Holmes. I thought quickly, aware of Phelps’ scrutiny.
Sherlock felt a faint stirring of his own at that. But he had to admit that between the same exhaustion that John was experiencing, the continued wooziness from when he’d resurfaced, and the force to keep everything in check and down, as it were, he wasn’t having the best reaction possible. Or the most faithful to what he’d otherwise experience.
Alright, so perhaps there was some ferventness in that last bit, too, he wasn’t going to try to deny that, and not just because it would be hopeless.
“Beating yourself over the head with their imagined fate will not help. Not them nor yourself,” Sherlock said, and while his words were dry and seemingly cold, there was warmth and compassion to the baritone voice. Something which was reflected when John looked up into the Alpha’s face.
“I’m not holding it like that,” John protested. However, the protest was undermined by the involuntary smile spreading across his lips and the fact that he didn’t so much as shift how he held it.
He’d snorted and said that no, the atrocities didn’t feel any better for knowing he hadn’t been paid for it. Sherlock had been about to argue with him, but he’d held up a hand and said that he knew they’d been over it and it didn’t work like that, but that didn’t make much of a difference, at least not yet. Later, perhaps, but not now.
Sherlock was looking down at him from where he’d positioned himself between the doctor’s legs, bent slightly so he could more easily reach the stomach.
So many, in fact, that John had more than once worried that he was trying to overcompensate to make sure he got it right. That they needed to talk about, but that time wasn’t now.
Think ‘mental representation’ is a descriptor I’d prefer but if you want ‘figment’, then alright – and of course I have. Or haven’t, as the case happen to be, because this is still you, all the way through. John’s not really here. He’s still waiting for you out on the other side of your brain to sort this mess out so we can move on with life, together. You do have the idea, though, and therefore, so have I.
“Would you…would you keep me in check? I mean, if I do try to shift, then I need to…to make sure that…that I don’t – “
“It’s not just the babies, though,” he said, equally quietly. “Well, it’s mainly that – and yeah, okay, you were right, there were two, not one – but it’s not exclusively their health, I mean. It’s also – “
Which was never something he wanted to dwell on. It wasn’t productive, it wasn’t helpful and it left him feeling adrift and dizzy.
At least, there was no need or call for it yet. Better to save that for when this was truly over, though honestly, there were a lot of things he’d rather do when they were out of the woods than focus on feeling self-assured.
The blond thankfully did, watching him carefully, perhaps warily. So, Sherlock tried to shift back into fully human, or human-shaped, concentrating hard to speed up the process, but to no avail, which puzzled him. Another go might do it, he didn’t know, but they were running out of time for him to attempt it.
John, on the other hand, moved straight towards the bed, keeping his gait at a pace that bridged the distance quickly but wouldn’t scare her.
But neither version of anger was present in the doctor’s face then, no matter how closely the younger Holmes looked. It wasn’t quite an elated or happy expression he might’ve been secretly hoping for either, that much was true.
John, who could feel the droplets of blood trickle down his throat but could do very little except try to assess how deep the cuts were from the sting and the amount of blood that escaped, took a step backwards.
“Neither, as a matter of fact, and at least if you’re going to be insulting, brother dear, at least you can try to be a little more creative. It’s beneath you not to be.”
John was safe now in a way that he hadn’t ever been in the harem, that was true, but the danger wasn’t over. In fact, in a sense, he was in more danger now than he’d been in the harem, and since he was a soldier, too, that knowledge would’ve lodged somewhere in the back of his mind, ready to spring into full awareness should it be needed.
“Who are you, horribly understanding and forgiving creature, and what have you done with the contrary, childish person I call my best friend?”
Not so much in case they were to come after them – if they did, he knew it would be Mycroft’s pleasure to deal with them as…creatively as possible, and that was without being told just what exactly they had done to her – but to explain and help John and his guilt after this was all over.
This was it, after all. It was something he had been longing and hoping for, for four years and never thought he would get. Now it was within his grasp and he wasn’t going to allow anything to mess that up for him.
“Positive. Notwithstanding recent behaviour, obviously.” He meant it to come out light and joking but instead, it came out somewhat pleading.
What was he holding? Who had been here? What had the Alpha done to cause this reaction in Sherlock’s bond mate.
“The crucial part,” John began again once he’d sat himself back up, the watch somehow still in one hand and his other holding Sherlock’s own, “is that you started courting me by taking the watch. That wasn’t your intention, I’m well aware of that, but that was nevertheless what you did. It wasn’t merely a delayed hoard acquisition. Why? Because there are other things of mine that would be more significant to you, that you would go for if it were merely another thing to add to your collection.”
Sherlock waited what seemed like forever after the door had been slammed, just to make sure that he wasn’t coming back. Then he quickly opened his phone again, noting with dismay that not only had John sent a few texts while he’d been forced to deal with the nasal rat-face, they had been interested in what he’d talked about rather than put off or disgusted.
Though his back was turned, Sherlock could feel Moriarty’s departure in a way he hadn’t before, which was…oh!
He couldn’t remember feeling this out of control of his dragon state since…well, he would’ve assumed his relative teen years but as he had deleted large parts of those a long time ago, he couldn’t actually remember.
He’d somehow – the weight of the man, for lack of a better descriptor, had increased significantly with the addition of the dragon appendages, thank god he was light to begin with – managed to manoeuvre him from the coffee table over to lie on his side on the sofa, much like he normally did when he was sulking. It was the only way to get him horizontal, with the wings as an obstacle, without having to worry about his breathing.
Sherlock sat with his computer in front of him, the file papers strewn across half the keyboard. It was the early hours of the morning, but he’d only been working for an hour.
At the very least, he ought to have remembered John’s gun because he had specifically avoided taking that.
“What’s wrong, Mycroft? Why can’t he shift back?” the doctor asked once he was done. “Is it the wounds?”
The fact that he saw him first didn’t entail that he could call out to him or otherwise warn him, however.
So, perhaps it was more John who thought clothing stores were boring. He’d never bothered much beyond what was practical, fitted and didn’t hurt his eyes.
Another image flashed in his mind at that, as unbidden as the first but somehow even more potent; a mop of dark, thick curls and a soft cheek resting wearily against ginger strands while bony but broad hands held onto already skinny legs as they walked, making sure that his burden didn’t fall anywhere, as the little hands gripped nothing.
Once the man was out of sight, Sherlock took a quick but small step backwards, just enough that he could reach out and remove the gag.
Or perhaps, that made a bit more sense, actually; though Sherlock had no issue with seeing John undressed or being so himself, John was rarely looking. Oh, he had once or twice but not…he’d only lingered when he had thought Sherlock couldn’t see him.
He took a moment to give the prone body, whose shivers had gotten quite pronounced by now, an assessing look. Then he shook his head.
Despite that, John somehow managed not to react other than a twitch of the eyes and a long, sharp inhalation. He kept eye contact, almost demonstratively, while his body did its best to process the pain quietly.
“What?” John asked, for a moment completely thrown, uncomprehending of what was meant. Then it clicked. “The scent bond? But surely, the scent bond couldn’t manage something like – “
And again, the way that he was holding onto him felt warm and comforting, just like one would hope it to be. It didn’t feel possessive in the slightest, which was admittedly not great as evidence, to say the least, but John would take it.
When it went on just a fraction or two, or five, longer than a peck could reasonably encompass, there was a small but nevertheless somehow pointed clearing of throat.
“You never need to ask,” Sherlock interrupted. “If you need something, just take it. This is your home as much as mine, now.”
They discuss where to go from there and try to introduce a bit of normalcy, as far as that goes, into their life together.
However, he did ask about the minutes Sherlock spent with his head buried in his phone, typing furiously and occasionally looking up from the screen to look at something closely. His eyes were narrowed in thought, then, and his mouth was a little pinched.
However much apparent animosity there was between the two, it was the petty sort that only siblings know how to ignite and keep aflame. One that could be snuffed out, or at least brought down to the merest embers, when the situation called for it. The fact that they were dragons didn’t alter anything.
He didn’t know whether that ought to make him feel special, because what it did was make him feel empathy and sympathy for Sherlock for what had led him to be that outwardly distant and closed-off to others, since it seemed evident, even to him, that it was a learned attribute rather than an inherent one.
“You hold onto her,” John said, with a small smile. “There’s no need to move her from somewhere she feels safe.”
Mycroft couldn’t have missed it but surprisingly, he made no comment. The corners of his mouth did pull further downwards, though.
He hadn’t managed to get that far away down what was a relatively empty street, however, before his name was called by a familiar baritone. Not commanding, not demanding, but nevertheless insistent. Appealing, perhaps?
John drew in a breath, then pinched the bridge of his nose, letting the breath back out slowly. “Just tell me what you’ve done with my watch.”
When it was a deliberate, conscious effort instead, the effort was much greater, even comparatively speaking. It was only made worse by the fact that he’d pushed it so far down earlier, to keep it from ever resurfacing.
So the next question was why it was an egg representing not so much fear in general, that was boringly easy to work out, but this fear related to John. He wasn’t about to argue that he had the fear this time, as it evidently was, but why this shape for it? John was nothing to do with his apprehension about his nature and he hadn’t intended to mix the two parts of his life anymore than couldn’t be avoid – ah.
It was true that his earlier assertion that evening, and the fact that it was less than 24 hours ago that he’d called Sherlock a machine and had left the flat only to be kidnapped was still mindboggling, was evidently wrong. Nobody who truly didn’t care, whatever the reasons behind not caring was, would go to such trouble, put themselves in danger for someone else.
Leaving aside all the gender issues, it was being able to trust and rely and your partner that mattered, wasn’t it?
Because this was Moriarty. This was a bona fide psychopath, who had never taken a positive, and healthy, interest in anyone, let alone a child. Even if it was genuine, this happy state of affairs between them was maintained as much through the relatively short time they must spend together when they did meet as anything else, if not more so.
If he wanted to do a proposal of his own, then he could try it on that secretary he relied so heavily on and see how that worked out for him, without bothering Sherlock or buggering up his chances of doing a proposal that even he recognised as utterly crucial for his brother’s wellbeing if not his life in its entirety.
“Bit rich, coming from you, innit?” John said. His eyes ought to have fried the Irishman to a crisp. “And you were quite happy to have me stuck in the harem, if it comes to that.”
Or maybe he was just stalling for time. Though he knew he ought to, he hadn’t yet given up hope that he would see Sherlock without the dragon again, for more than a second or two, not entirely. He’d tried, hard and several times, but had found that he couldn’t.
No, because he didn’t expect anything to come of it. He didn’t want anything from John because he knew that what he’d wish for would never happen, he couldn’t expect it nor should he, and he was more than happy with what they did have.
Think. Where had it been? In Sherlock’s pocket? Somewhere around the…no, he knew that he had seen it after it had gone missing. After the…after they’d got back home, in fact, after the pool-incident. He remembered staring at it. Sherlock had produced it from his pocket, he believed, and had held it out to John, for him to take.
That about summed up everything about all of this, didn’t it? It’d all been a fluke, from the very beginning that Sherlock had broken in and had been overwhelmed, whether that was by the amalgamation of scents in the communal room or by John’s, and had gone into Rut to…more or less the point they were in right now, really. The point he was at right now, having an Alpha lackey thug, who worked for a criminal mastermind who seemed to be worryingly connected to his missing daughter, presumably following after him.
John spoke quietly, softly then, with a bit of an edge, audible and visible even through the small smile he was sporting, that made his expression, his entire face seem a little distant.
Mycroft looked, strange though it was to see and even more difficult to genuinely comprehend, pained and agitated. More than that, though, he looked somewhat angry and…hungry? No, that couldn’t be right. Why would he look hungry, of all things?
It wasn’t that they’d had an argument, or he was starting to resent his Alpha or didn’t want him there at all. Of course not. He enjoyed spending time with Sherlock, both when his mind was rapidly firing on all cylinders and when they could have some quiet moments just talking or even being quiet.
That didn’t mean it was completely dormant. Being mentally right beside it as he was at that point, he could feel the energy, the power coming off it, in resemblance of the embers of a fire rather than the afterheat of a stove. The afterheat is eventually going to cool off, leaving an entirely cold and safe stove behind, and while embers may do the same, they not only smoulder for longer, they are easily brought back up into the same full roar they had been when they had been flames, within moments.
He breathed through his nose, his eyes closed as he sought to grab onto whatever could help calm his beating heart. Apart from the obvious point of his partner being physically right in front of him, there was the scent coming from him, too, that warm, strong, musky smell of Alpha overlaid with the notes that marked it out as Sherlock’s, unique and entirely enticing, but also, more importantly in the circumstances, comforting on a bone level.
Lips pressed against his forehead, at the small knot that was the frown he hadn’t realised he wore, and arms drew him back into their hold.
The Alpha opened his mouth, presumably to argue the point further, then stopped. His eyebrows drew together for a moment, then smoothed out again into what John would describe as a grateful expression.
Take their first case together, for instance. If he hadn’t had the gun then, Sherlock would have done something very stupid, just because, the idiot.
“Not because I’m a dragon.” It was John’s turn to stiffen. “I’m not stupid, John. I know you’ve been thinking about it ever since you saw, and especially since we took off.”
Of course, the reason they’d stopped in the middle of it all was because of consent issues and then it had devolved from there, but John still had the distinct impression that there was more to it than that. That maybe Sherlock wasn’t as ready for it as he was making himself out to be.
He almost forgot that he was supposed to join in. As it was, he just about managed to make it in time, only stumbling a little on the first note or two. Then his fingers took over from his momentarily unreliable brain and steered him safely through.
Halfway between their pillows, in fact. Was there any significance in that? At an earlier time, he would’ve said categorically no, of course not but then, Sherlock had surprised him plenty of times, even on something like this, so he shouldn’t rule it out.
If nothing else, this was a long chapter and I think, think, they are getting better at all this. I hope so - and it wasn't to be a 'ooh, mystery' sod that we didn't see Sherlock's visitor, btw. Or, let me put it another way, it wasn't intentional.
This wasn’t that. This was the very bowels of his mind. He would need to traverse the same route back up as he had down.
“I’m alright,” he said after a moment’s tense silence. However, his voice was strained, and his teeth were gritted.
Could be just a nosy inhabitant, of course. They came in every shape and size, after all, and every nationality, too. Some might be more blatant than other but on the whole…
His surprised confusion must have shown on his face because Sherlock sighed heavily. But then he quirked a small smile that was more a purse of the lips than anything and his expression became soft and a bit more…not uncertain but vulnerable. Just a slight bit but still.
But though he knew perfectly well he’d have difficulty, to say the least, practising a completely normal, routine life, whatever that said about him as a person, he also knew that for the sake of their unborn children, he would have to find some way to do so, to the maximum extent that he could.
It had persisted into the harem, too. Not among the Omegas and Betas, apart from what rubbed off through conditioning, societal and otherwise. But among the owners and punters, the harem didn’t feel real nor did the ‘merchandise’ within.
And though he wanted to find something specifically for her, there would be time for that later. Yes, there would. When she was back with him, with them, and they could take their time to find something good, together, all three.
But that wasn’t the same as saying he was against having more, was it? Which in turn wasn’t equal to saying he was
“To say the least,” John agreed. “But let me say this clearly, love; you do not have to do it all correctly. There’s no list of facts to this, no single correct formula. No exam or other bar you need to pass in order to be allowed to continue on.”
That wasn’t to say the fog was unpleasant. Quite the opposite, which contributed to lack of care he was able to muster about his current situation. A lack of care that extended to the teeth, pointed and predatory, moving towards his throat, the eye contact not breaking until it was impossible for it to be retained.
“He’s stuck, Mycroft,” John had interrupted with a snap. “He cannot shift completely to one or the other no matter what he’s tried, he’s in pain, and now he’s slipped into unconsciousness.”
He steered towards the nearest park, mildly surprised at himself for how well he seemed to remember his way around the city. Granted, he hadn’t travelled that far, relatively speaking, and it wasn’t as though somebody moved the streets around like some bloody architectural Rubik’s Cube. But though the harem had been in London for some time, he hadn’t exactly been allowed out to refamiliarize himself with it.
“How did – why do I even bother asking? I don’t think of it as a crime, it was just…” he trailed off.
At least, he knew for certain that John made him better. The other way around…there was a bigger question mark on that.
Shielding was only something dragons did to things they cared…no, not even that. It had nothing to do with whether they cared about the object they were shielding or not. It had to do with claiming of the object in question, nothing more.
He didn’t hesitate in mentioning it outright. Mycroft knew he had it, John knew he knew, and the ginger knew that the doctor knew, which was probably as he preferred it. It was something to dangle over him, if he wanted to, or just keep on file for later possible use. Though at this point, John would think he’d proved that he was dedicated to helping Sherlock, not just in this situation but in general, a dedication that sometimes meant he had a need for the gun.
“Oh, I’m real, Johnny-boy,” Moriarty’s voice, sounding slightly deeper and reverberating, said. It was one voice that seemed to come from two mouths. “Very much so. Every. Last. Inch.”
But that was most likely just because he had a fixed idea of what and who Mycroft was and being a dragon didn’t really fit within that image, not even remotely. Sherlock, yes, that almost made his actions make more sense, but Mycroft? Not so much, and that was hardly fair, because it relegated him to being nothing more than an obstacle or sometimes a help, not an entity on his own.
It wasn’t because he didn’t know how to celebrate it. Technically speaking, since it was on Christmas, he could probably get away with doing nothing more spectacular than finding a proper gift and spend some extra time spoiling John. Christmas did sort of take precedent, didn’t it? Not particularly for him, of course, but…
He could do a lot of things, even John knew that at that point, but a frozen nose was a cold, frozen nose.
“Mycroft was making a statement to anyone who might be watching. He will have stopped as he stepped out of his car, letting the cameras see him before he walked into the building, and done the same when he walked out, both letting his own people know where he is and sending a message.”
His eyes darted around the room as he moved, as though he could glean something from the combined hodgepodge mountain of items that comprise the room of a four-year-old only child with doting parents. Something more than the obvious, and perhaps even something more than what Sherlock was able to glean and deduce from it.
“You seem to have become fast friends in this time.” Oh, for the love of – why did his mouth seem insistent on spewing such irrelevant nonsense now? It would be stupid at the best of times but now? “I’m sorry, that was uncalled for.”
No, actually, what made it the most egregious one was because, whether deliberate or not, he failed to understand the problem or have the appropriate response, even when called out.
To have her taken away once had been hard enough, to put it incredibly mildly. So much so that he’d had to bury her, or rather, lock the memory of her away to be able to cope with the loss and even then, he had continued to feel the love and the loss like a burning coal in the bottom of his heart.
Besides, what it truly boiled down to was whether or not they would attract attention or, more precisely, suspicion. Not so much going in as coming back out.
“Didn’t say that, did I? Wasn’t finished yet. I just…I appreciate the thought, I really do. It’s only that...” He paused to gather his thoughts again. “Well, to know that there might be a solution, a solution to a problem that is…but you’re going to have to wait for it for another eight to ten hours for something as seemingly insignificant as sleep…do you think you would be able to get a wink?”
...I think I ought to give up making this monster behave. Monster, aha. -_-' But it refuses to go in the direction I try...I'll stop blabbering for once.
It felt as though an age passed before Mycroft returned to the flat, made worse by Sherlock’s stillness, interspersed with moments of possible-but-not-at-all-sure movements and other frustratingly close not-quite-indicators that fizzled out into nothingness if they were ever really there at all. When he looked at the light filtering through the gap where the curtains didn’t quite shut, he’d estimate that he’d been gone an hour, two on the outside.
There wasn’t only one way that he could screw this up, it seemed. Either it would be by way of his body through his instincts and biology, or it would be his mind, pulling apart and poisoning everything it touched.
The fact that the doctor might not be able to see him at first glance was a good extra, especially now, in his momentary mental absence, where it afforded him just that second longer to get his mind back into working order.
John didn’t even need to look behind him at his partner to know he was smiling to the point where calling it a smirk would be far more appropriate. It did after all mean that he’d been right in his prediction, and John had been wrong.
Then there was the issue of Moriarty. Sherlock had been right, they wouldn’t have seen the last of him, not when he’d showed such an interest in John, before his pregnancy and Sherlock, and Mycroft had promised his little brother that he’d deal with it.
Still standing rather close, it was easy for him to bend down and plant a kiss on John’s forehead, soft and warm.
The words got stuck in his throat, hard to get out past the sudden rock wedged in his throat despite their importance. What if he had miscalculated or misheard? There would be consequences, one way or the other. Was he ready for that?
I just...I don't...fucking hell, guys, your feedback on the last chapter, both in amount and in quality, was just...I don't even have words for it, except a humongous THANK YOU to all of you! ❤️❤️❤️
The elder Holmes had clearly tried to, not exactly warn John but prepare him, perhaps, for what would be in store for him, which was…
Sherlock stiffened at that, hard to spot but enough that John could see it, helped by his familiarity with the lanky body and the rare occurrences of someone hitting home.
“It’s John, not Sherlock, and whatever you think you’re going to reprimand him for, save it. I need your help and I need it urgently, without any Holmesian horse-hockey bullshit taking up time.”
If it was a Hammer Horror, though, this…what seemed like it was going to be the end would probably feel awfully anticlimactic, all things considered.
The fact that he didn’t panic with the fear of what that meant, what it could possibly was…well, it was a fairly good indicator of whatever else was going on, around him and in his mind. That and character, but John didn’t seem to register that fact.
John. What about the…no, not the figment, he was more than that. He was a manifestation of the real John. But that said, he was
“No,” Sherlock said, shaking his head minutely. “I admit, I would have, once upon a not very long ago at all, and I have in fact a slight urge to do exactly that now. But I will not, because of the reasons you said. The threat of it did the job, though.”
They weren’t snapping at each other or otherwise miscommunicating, not really, which was a great relief and gave hope that they could get through this, too, even if it did still seem a tall order, to put it incredibly mildly.
“That’s it, love, let me hear you,” he murmured, wishing for a moment he had more hand so he could still slide his hands over that soft, warm flesh. He sped up his movements a little, adding a slight twist on the upward stroke. “Come on, I want to see you.”
No, man. Whatever else he was, he was still a person. A man, even if he were a dragon, and – and pronouns and classifications really weren’t something to think about right then. So of course he’d been unable to get it out of his mind even as he jotted the details of Mycroft’s suggestion, his plan down.
Thankfully, Nantes had an airport, and it had been confirmed that the girl they had found and believed to be Tessa still lived within the Pays de la Loire region with her family, so they wouldn’t have to drive across half the country or similar in order to get there, on top of everything else.
“Of course not, don’t be stupid,” the brunet said, without opening his eyes. He could feel John standing beside him where he lay on the floor as the victim. When had he got up from his chair? “You know perfectly well that I need time to think.”
Her ‘mother’ hastened to assure her that she had done really well, and that she was proud of her. The female Alpha even smiled, though she couldn’t quite hide her pain.
“Ruby, has anybody touched you? While you’ve been awake, has anyone touched without permission, or where they shouldn’t?”
And how would he do that, exactly? He was still effectively chained to the other by way of the hand around his wrist. Even if he could carry Sherlock, it wouldn’t solve the core issue of his continued presence.
At his minimal response, as it were, something flickered in the blond teen’s eyes and his expression turned momentarily odd again.
Pushing his hindering frustration out of the way as best he could, he tried to think back over the conversation they’d had earlier. It wasn’t easy, and not just because he was tired, nor was it pleasant, but it had to be done.
Humming slightly in contentment, he let the papers be for the time being – he could read those back at the flat, once he’d gotten the Omega into bed – to just enjoy this moment and fix it in his memory.
Sherlock didn’t even consider brushing him off. Not only would it be abundantly evident that that was a lie, it’d be making consideration that John hadn’t asked for. What he was asking for was the truth, and Sherlock would give it.
No trace of annoyance, frustration or even apprehension. Nothing at all negative, in fact, even with the watch between them, quite literally. Only a continued warmth and kindness, not to mention patience.
Sherlock thought and was surprised to realise that he meant it. It meant getting to see John – and why hadn’t he thought to find out his name before now? – on more than the weekends when he’d run out of cigarettes, something which he was quite keen to, he discovered.
“Sherlock?” John asked, worried. Not just of whether his friend was in pain or otherwise hurt but whether this meant that he was, after everything, still having a problem getting the dragon to remain…contained, as it were.
Poking his head in to look, however, revealed no consulting detective, on top of or under the covers. Part of John was simultaneously disappointed and relieved that Sherlock hadn’t got it into his head that he ought to use the opportunity of Christmas to ‘spice up’ their sex life with something like Christmas-themed naughty lingerie or something equally…
He listened to make sure and indeed, the cacophony outside created a sort of calm inside of him, which in turn aided his focus.
“None needed, it’s a good point. I’m not saying he was right, either. Merely that that’s what his worry is. Part of his worry, anyway.”
That made the blond look up and focus back on the other, though only for a moment. However, he moved himself closer and evidently tried to speed up the retrieval, even though that almost never worked out well, which was appreciated for its consideration.
“Do you want to have another go?” he asked, running his fingers over the guitar string to presumably illustrate what he meant. “We are meant to be practising, after all, aren’t we?”
Sherlock went on to explain that his badge should’ve been in his trouser pocket for ease of use, he knew, but he had left it in his inside coat pocket instead, he was a bit paranoid about losing it, see, as it was their first case going solo on something like that. Then, at seeing the state of him, he had quite honestly forgotten but if he would just wait a sec –
If he put the brakes on it now, the doctor would still be well aware of what Sherlock had tried to do, which would have the same effect, if not worse, than just braving it and following through to the end.
As he started to pull it out of the pocket, with some difficulty, it seemed like, he let go of Sherlock’s hand and even evaded the attempt to grab it again. The brunet let out a noise and made another attempt.
Well, what do you know? Less than a month of waiting this time? What new spore of madness is this? Well...probably shouldn't get used to it :S
The silence stretched between them as they stood just staring at each other, slightly awkward but mostly charged in a pleasant way, like the warmth of a coming thunderstorm promising rain after a drought.
But that was something special to him, something with history and significance otherwise there wouldn’t be any point in taking it, would there?
Of course. Cases. Sherlock had mentioned that his cases sometimes took him outside the country, too, when a lead needed chasing, or a criminal needed likewise. Crime wasn’t purely an English thing, after all.
Once or twice, he’d picked up his phone in order to check whether he’d been left any messages for him. Unfortunately, there’d only been one and that had been from Mycroft, wishing him good luck, of all things.
Even as he said it, he knew that he was going to do it. Nothing big. Nothing that would require much effort and let the leash off too much, as it were, but that was…wasn’t that the point, really? The point John was trying to make; that he could control it enough that the partial shift would only be a small part of him shifting, not large parts or even him in his entirety.
Looking over, Sherlock saw the shorter dragon stroll back towards them, no trace that he’d ever been remotely dragon-like there. Well, almost; the fingers he kept snapping was rather sharp and claw-like.
Sherlock felt his throat constrict, his eyes widen and something harsh and acidic bubble in the pit of his stomach, preparing to be spit out in a defensive attack. He forced it down, though, knowing that it was fuelled by hurt and how painfully accurate John had managed to be.
“Don’t be because you’re not. Or rather, you may be but that’s exhaustion, not anything to do with your emotional responses. I know I wouldn’t have handled him that well.”
Whatever it would take to get them back home safe. But that was precisely why he didn’t, why he stayed where he was. If he ran, he was sure not to be safe, let alone the other two. It might buy them a few minutes from sheer surprise at his actions, that he would do something like that.
It would be nice but also exceptionally unlikely that the Alpha Irishman was going to just…let them go, not after all of this, and certainly not alive and well. The reason he had let them in in the first place, not to mention without any issues, was the same reason they wouldn’t be allowed to leave.
The man behind the chair didn’t quite look right, either, for the setting. In fact, incongruous though the expensive suit the man on the rug wore was for the setting, he looked positively suitable in comparison with the other man, Alphas though they both were.
The former idea seemed terrifyingly close to becoming reality when the hand turned again and made a quick movement downwards.
He fervently wished that Mycroft would hurry the buggering hell up and get back there, with whatever cure he had managed to scrounge up somewhere.
How when it seemed as though there was nothing more to him to discover or be surprised by, he shifted and did something unexpected, which in turn shifted the perspective on what had come before.
“They’re not going to shoot,” John repeated. “They’ve had plenty of opportunity already, both to shoot independently or to have been given the orders, yet neither has happened. It makes it highly improbable that it’s going to happen, especially given who we’re dealing with.”
If Sarah rang to scream at him for not coming into work, if Lestrade and his team burst into the flat for another drugs bust, staged or not, he wouldn’t have noticed. Even if Moriarty had come to kidnap him from under Sherlock’s nose and the younger Holmes had made an uproar that made his clash with Mycroft look like a toddler flapping its hands, John was afterwards not at all sure he would’ve woken. Perhaps not even if Sherlock had made him into a part of his hoard while he had been asleep or…done other things. It had been that deep a sleep and it had been long overdue.
“You do know that…well, something comes after all this, yeah?” John asked as Sherlock poured for them both.
That, of course, he knew to be unrealistic, but in whatever capacity it could be true, he hoped that it was.
John didn’t immediately answer. Instead he cocked his head a little, even as it was already tilted backwards to look up at the other, just regarding his mate. Sherlock stood there, letting him.
He scrambled upright, expecting at any moment the claws or the teeth to sink into him, ripping him apart rather than merely claiming him, as a retaliation for his escape attempt. For one horrifying, heart-stopping moment, he thought he did indeed feel points against where his shoulders met neck, but it left almost as soon as he’d felt it, with an abruptness that was odd as it was incredibly welcome.
He honestly didn’t think Sherlock would move but, perhaps just to prove him wrong, the taller man went to put the kettle on and more than that, got out two mugs and corresponding teabags.
“I would’ve thought my erection if nothing else would’ve been an abundantly clear indicator that that notion is utterly incorrect.”
“Why? Because you never show interest in girls, much less guys. I thought you might be, I don’t know, not interested in anything related to that sort of thing.”
“Sherlock, what’s wrong?” he repeated, stronger than before but still as gentle as he could make it. “What’s happened?”
Still, he had to be careful if the other was awake and pretending. He wasn’t going to pretend for long, or he would’ve worked it all out even if he never so much as left the bed, which could potentially…not ruin things but bring him back to the previously considered point.
The more proper news rarely reported on such news, unless it concerned the royal family. They did, however, sometimes run stories on studies on the subject, which were almost guaranteed to be slanted towards the benefits of being pregnant, especially with more than one child.
“It seems that I have overstayed my welcome. In case you should need it, I will stay close until it is safe.”
“Because you’ve been skiving off for more than half my English lessons, going down to buy cigs in the village, and if you don’t want to stay the entirety of Easter break to make up for it, or let your parents know you haven’t quit as you promised at the start of the year, I think you’d do better to take part.”
But he was comforted a little by his previous behaviour feeling almost unthinkable, impossible in the current situation, even though it would be so much more efficient to not care. To just think about the cold, hard facts.
“When it’s imperative we get it right, seeing as it might be what separates either of us from succumbing to the dragon in some way or other, and I have deleted everything? How stupid do you think I am?”
“What are they, then? Secretly the nine rings melted down?” It was meant as a sort of joke but to be honest, he wouldn’t be all that surprised if that did turn out to be the case.
They must’ve said something else as well, John thought but didn’t voice it. He’d be told sooner or later, he knew. “Well, it gives us a direction, at least.”
Mycroft waved his hand slightly to indicate that this wasn’t important right now. With his other hand, he pulled at the pocket square of his suit jacket and, with a deft movement, wiped the blood off John’s fingers. Only then was his hand released.
“Sherlock.” He looked up, questioningly, though his lips didn’t leave the skin. “No, I wasn’t…you can do it, it’s not that. Of course you can. It’s…I just thought that you might be doing it for the reassurance or something along those lines.”
“Now, now,” he chided, almost slightly sing-song as he continued to stare at the blond, “that’s no way to say hello, is it? And here I made all this effort.”
His bank had yet to issue him with a new credit card – the one he’d held on to, for God knew only what reason, had a chip which the cash point machines no longer registered – and it was still a bit of a sore issue being handed money from Sherlock.
“You have Inspector Bradstreet here to thank for your arrest,” said Holmes, as the smaller man stepped forward and produced a pair of cuffs, still with a look of sorrow on his face, as though the crimes of a fellow inspector were his personal failing. “He agreed to help me once I had removed my disguise and explained the situation, despite his charming insistence that you were in every way an exemplary adherent to and enforcer of the law. His trust in you was such that I sincerely wish I had not had to shatter it in so bald a fashion.”
“I thought I saw a friend I have not seen since the war,” I said, wishing, not for the first time, that I had Holmes’ talent for fabrication. “I heard him cry out and, having thought he had been killed in Afghanistan, I was much surprised to see him. I’m afraid I quite lost my head and charged in here determined to speak with him.”
“When I was ten years old,” Holmes said at last, “my mother went to visit her sister. She was gone for several weeks. My father was a banker and spent most of his day at the office and my brother Mycroft had just left for university. I was left alone at home.”
“Inspector Bradstreet is tied up, but he says we are to give you fifteen minutes with the old beggar,” he said. “Tell Mr Holmes that we hope to see him down at the station soon.”
The next day, I found him in the same position, still sunk into a vacant abstraction that seemed utterly out of character for the energetic and driven man I had come to know. So strongly did his torpor impress itself upon me that I felt an urge to take his pulse and examine his pupils in search of evidence of some factor, internal or external, that could have contributed to such a profound change. Instead, I tore myself away. Not wishing to step out into the drab rain and cold winds of London in January, I determined to withdraw to my quarters and pass my time in reading. My reluctance to witness Holmes in this unexplained state of extreme lethargy and my pangs at his disinterest in engaging with me – or the world at large – may seem extreme, but I had not quite realised until then how central a role he had come to play in my life. My surreptitious study of him had become a strange sort of hobby in a life empty of other diversions and I had even begun to compile a small list of his eccentricities and habits in an attempt to unravel the many mysteries that surrounded him. Some of that list I shared in the public account of our early acquaintance detailed in A Study in Scarlet, but I confess there were many aspects of the details I had noticed about him that I deemed unfit for public perusal.
I did not miss the undertone of mischief in the way Holmes responded to their overtures. When Gregson remarked on the complexity of the case, Holmes, examining his fingernails, remarked guilelessly, “Really? You find it so?”
“Well diagnosed, doctor,” he said, his voice so low that I had to bring my ear close to his lips to catch his words. “It was morphine. I fear I may have miscalculated the dose. It has been a long time since I took it. I am usually content with a seven percent solution of cocaine.”
“You possess many talents that he does not,” he said, laying one large hand across the small of my back so that I was pinned against him. I rested my weight on the right arm so that I could look down at his smiling face. “At least, I have not seen any mention of them thus far in The Strand. I am rather glad, to tell you the truth. I should not much relish half of London becoming on intimate terms with the Doctor John Watson I know.”
“What happened?” I croaked as Lestrade guided me to a chair, before turning aside to call for water. It was only then that I noticed the room was full of people. I glimpsed two constables, a familiar looking couple, who stood side by side in handcuffs, fury on their faces, and a small crowd who had gathered at the open door. Suddenly I wondered exactly what they had heard and seen.
Holmes glanced at me with a familiar smile as I took my seat opposite him, then returned to the newspaper as I turned my attention to my eggs, fervently grateful that Mrs Hudson was accustomed to the strange demands of his profession and the odd hours at which we often chose to dine. As Holmes read and I breakfasted, I wondered how and when to broach some of the dozens of questions running through my mind. I desperately wanted to know how long he had been an addict and how often he filled his empty hours with a shot of morphine or cocaine. Even more desperately, I wanted to know what had driven him to the anger he had displayed the previous night, whether he had truly intended me to kiss him and why, if kissing me was something he wanted, he had not done it earlier.
“Even if Phelps had wanted me I would have had none of it and I believe you know it,” I admonished him.
I heard his voice, husky with sleep, at the same moment I felt a cool fingertip trace a firm, slow line down my spine. My body gave an involuntary shiver.
“You do not have the authority to decide what is best for me,” I heard myself say, almost as though it were someone else speaking. “I don’t stay because I need you, I stay because I am so in love with you that I cannot imagine living without you… but you already knew that.”
Here I stopped, realising too late that what had begun as an attempt at scientific research had taken an altogether more dangerous turn. I knew that, ravaged as I was by war, I could not possibly be considered attractive by a man like Holmes. I was anyway certain that he was not an invert, although I had never heard him express any particular admiration for women, even after I had quite unselfconsciously remarked on the beauty of a well-dressed young lady who had arrived one afternoon to avail herself of Holmes’ help. I confess I had wondered if he shared my own unusual preferences, my curiosity sparked by Stamford’s unexplained reservations about living with the man, but as our acquaintance grew I was certain that his inclinations did not tend towards my own – which, after all, were deemed by respectable society to be both unnatural and unlawful. In fact, Holmes rarely expressed admiration for anyone, seeming far more preoccupied with his books and his experiments than he was with human beings.
“How that is something you’ve kept hold of in your brain but not the most basic of knowledge is still beyond me.”
He didn’t get to finish the sentence before Sherlock was once again kissing him, this time for much longer, though he didn’t quite feel certain enough to push it further.
I - I would say I don't know what happened but I think I do. I probably shouldn't have written this at this time when I haven't been in the but I didn't want to make you all wait longer than you had already. So I'm sorry for this rollercoaster and mess of a chapter. I probably should've waited.
“But we need to find a way, and no, not because of the dragon. Because…” He took a breath, still needing a bit of mental push to admit such things, before he then continued, “because I want to watch you fall asleep and want to wake up with you. Feel the warmth of your body next to mine and be able to touch you when you’re calm and relaxed in a way which I’ve never seen you while awake.”
Mycroft looked at him, glanced briefly at his brother and John’s hand still gripped hard by Sherlock’s. Something passed across his features though John couldn’t say for certain what it was, only that it wasn’t entirely comfortable.
At least they wouldn’t have to bother with check-in. They weren’t going as tourists, after all, had no need for baggage they couldn’t wear, and didn’t plan to stay longer than was absolutely necessary.
Thinking through the times they’d spent together, the situations they’d faced of one sort or another – and there really was a surprising amount of them, given how new their relationship still were, bond status and children on the way notwithstanding – he would have to agree with that realisation.
“We’ll work it out, I know,” he said, trying for a smile of reassuring confidence. He wasn’t entirely sure he was successful. “I just…sometimes it gets a bit much.”
He congratulated her, in French, on winning fair and square and wasn’t she a clever girl for managing that? There was no trace of insincerity or mockery in his voice then, either, and Sherlock had to blink and mentally shake himself to be sure that this was indeed Moriarty.
He knew them by name almost purely because as the keeper, he was privy to some of the records, mainly the guarded ones related to which clients had specific preferences, whether that be particular traits or even one specific Omega or Beta, so as to customize further. They hadn’t been named fully but even so, initials were not that hard to remember, especially not when it was more than two letters, and therefore not that hard to link them to the actual names, either.
“That’s not worry on your part, that’s Mummy being worried and sending you out to locate me and haul me back and you not daring to contradict her.”
Although he was already grasping her hand, a new touch might be better felt without being uncomfortable if she was more aware of it, and so he released her hand to touch the side of her face, giving her ample time to see it and say no if she didn’t want it.
It should be an easy question to answer. Or at least, it shouldn’t be difficult. After all, he’d been alive long enough that he should know better than to define himself by one thing, whether that was a character trait or an occupation. He was more than that, far more of a tapestry that one descriptor could contain, as most people were, really.
The two hands, one lifting quickly with a metallic glint that Sherlock could see and Tessa couldn’t, while the other, small and blemish free, slid surprisingly smoothly, almost nonchalantly, out of the inside of the jacket.
To try and somehow make up for it, and to move while Moriarty was absent, he immediately went to work untying the ropes and opening the vest to remove it as swiftly and as safely as he possibly could.
John hadn’t realised he’d sunken into deep thought and had begun to rub at the small curve that was his belly over his shirt while he thought. Not until his hand was stopped by a larger hand suddenly being in the way.
Sherlock confirmed that such considerations were part of it, too. They had to be when you dealt with such things. Mycroft couldn’t afford to tip his hand early and ruin everything because of one minor thing. But he also said that regardless of such considerations, what mattered to him most was keeping John safe.
He then gave the Omega a kiss on the cheek, possibly just to be annoying to his brother. Which was…not unexpected and really, was fair enough, not to mention rather mild for the two of them.
That said...I've had a bit of a...not a burn-out, but burn, trying to get on top of everything, including fic, and...yeah, just a heads up.
No…he hadn’t. That had been to the…the personification of John in his mind, not the man standing beside him in the real world. Not to the real John. To the one who mattered.
“My mind might struggle but that would be from simple overload of delicious information,” he said and dammit if there wasn’t the slightest of purrs to it, “and wouldn’t that be worth it?”
He hadn’t moved completely onto his side, but his upper body had sort of twisted more than a little towards the body of the doctor, who was on his side facing Sherlock. John’s arm had gravitated to lie across the bare stretch of skin of the side of the torso, relatively lightly but still with a curve that spoke of inherent protectiveness. What was evident was that although John had been the one to lie down, he hadn’t moved Sherlock to fit with his own position. If he had, he would’ve chosen a position far more comfortable than the one it was currently in.
He looked down at the odd shape on the sofa, the top wing curled around the body beneath it as the oddest makeshift blanket in the world, while the other, hampered by its owner position, was forced to trail along the floor, looking limp and broken.
something from John, but that was different. That was just a thing, a little trinket that John would soon forget he missed. His flatmate wasn’t that hung up on material things, not really.
This hadn’t been a good idea to begin with. Yes, so he’d been angry at Sherlock for his comment, for his whole demeanour regarding the case and other people in particular. He still was, in the back of his mind as other emotions had taken the driver’s seat, but the anger hadn’t been born purely there, had it? Nor was it the first time he’d reacted with anger at it or had stormed out.
Was he really that…that deep into the dragon mindset? Had he not really resurfaced, after all? It seemed ludicrous and hyperbolic but at the same time, he had to ask himself what his actual motives were for wanting John there.
“Right,” John said as he buttoned up the last few buttons of his shirt. “All done. When do they arrive?”
Rather than feeling justified in being the one to have told him, however, John felt a growing sense of bad conscience; who was he to tell him? Not because of any inferiority complex or feeling right in letting the boy find out for himself, but he had no business lecturing anybody.
No. Just…no. He wouldn’t give it back. Even though he didn’t want John to be mad at him, he wouldn’t.
When Sherlock entered the building, John saw him long before he saw John. Which was odd; normally it was the younger Holmes who spotted things and people before the doctor did, at least when it wasn’t people who presented a threat to them.
So instead, he turned his head without moving the rest of his body, hoping that it would be enough to…to see whether…
