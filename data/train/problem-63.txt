I can’t just leave everything because you want me to –“
“You used cocaine when we were living together.”
“Darling?” Mrs. Hudson says, following him downstairs.
“May I ask you what you are doing?”
“You don’t even know how you became a vampire?”
John touches his hair, not so gently anymore.
Actually, we didn’t hear from you for almost one and a half years, until you wrote a poetry anthology that left everyone very confused. Did you take time away from acting to write poetry?”
“You said you wouldn’t use him for that,” Mycroft is saying. “That’s the only reason why I allowed you to –“
“This way,” John is saying. “This way. Daddy’s living in a trailer now. Just for a short while. It’s a bit messy. I would’ve cleaned it up, but I didn’t know –“
“You did,” Sherlock says. It’s probably the wrong thing to say, but then again, he’s always said the wrong things in the worst possible situations. That’s his
“Yeah,” John says, giving the interviewer a smile that’s going to look genuine enough on the television or internet or where the hell this interview is going, “yeah, of course we are. We’re very excited.”
What? “What?”
“Some of them were. But the sex was good sometimes.”
“You weren’t supposed to find out like this,” Sherlock says from the living room. His voice is higher than usually and he’s doing something odd with his hands. It looks like he’s trying to pull his fingers out.
“Really?” John says in a tight voice. “That’s what you want to start with? Not, I don’t know,
“It’s alright,” John said and then wanted to hit himself in the face. It wasn’t
“Do you want tea?”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says and grabs the doorframe when standing on his own becomes too much. “I’m sorry I died. It was the only way. I didn’t realise –“
should have been offended. Sherlock had tried to
“I’m not leaving you,” John says. But he’s going to have to, isn’t he? If this isn’t real, if
He's spent hours reading everything he can about Mycroft until he realises there’s nothing about Sherlock.
Now, he stood up from the armchair, walked to Sherlock and almost fell into the coffin.
“You loved her but knew she wanted to get married and settle down and that made you feel claustrophobic,” the robot said. “More claustrophobic than spending three years in a metallic vessel in outer space. Goodbye, John Watson.”
John turns away from Sherlock and starts unbuttoning his shirt. So, he got stabbed. He got
“Maybe,” Sherlock says and bites his lip. “I don’t know if I want to act anymore.”
“Alright,” John says, his voice sharp now. He stands up and puts the cup of tea in the sink. Porcelain clatters. Mrs. Hudson seems confused and worried, but that’s not important.
“Yeah,” Sherlock says, fully aware that he’s wearing nothing except pants. “Yeah, I just… I thought maybe you had left.”
“Define sex.”
” John says in a thin voice. “
“But anyway, he likes my blood,” John said, “and I think he would like it if I… if I cut my hand when we have sex, or something. He’d like to taste it. And I’m just wondering, is that weird?”
“Sort of,” Sherlock said. “I’m going to deduce why you wanted to try my coat on."
Sherlock frowned. “I could give you a blowjob. You like those.”
“Don’t say that when you’re going to leave me.”
“Has everyone lost their sense of style?” he asked and glanced at John Watson, who looked confused. Then he glanced at the street again. The cars had changed, too. The traffic signs had changed. The building at the other side of the road had changed.
“I could eat more pigeons,” Sherlock said, but he didn’t sound convinced.
“What do I have to do to make you forgive me?”
“Do you know anything about Mycroft?” John asks Mrs. Hudson the next time they have tea. Mrs. Hudson has almost emptied her cup already, John hasn’t touched his yet. He’s nervous, no matter how much he tells himself not to be. It’s probably nothing. The bad feeling in his guts is nothing.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. In retrospect, maybe he shouldn’t have come to John this time. The subject might be sensitive for John. “I didn’t do it on purpose,” he tells John, just to make sure. “I was chasing a criminal.”
“Technically,” Sherlock said, “but I doubt it’s going to happen. It hasn’t this far.”
He was going to have sex with Sherlock. In the bathroom. He wasn’t sure how exactly that would work. Maybe they would do it in the bathtub. Or in the shower. And he didn’t know
John laughed quickly. “Not a
“Good,” John says after a short silence. “Good to hear.”
“A human.”
Maybe Sherlock should go home.
when it’s in me.”
Mike opened his mouth and closed it again. “Sure. It’s alright. Just… So, you met him?”
“Yes,” Mycroft said. “Sparrows, too. Anyway, I’m glad to see you’re alive.”
, for god’s sake. Tom has a
“On what?”
“You’re a vampire,” John said.
Soon after noticing all this, Sherlock noticed one more thing. Well, two things, but they were interconnected.
“I’m not going to move back in,” John says. “Not right now.”
“I didn’t realise it’d be this scary. I thought people were being unnecessarily dramatic about their break-ups, because really, everyone is an idiot anyway, why should anyone be so stressed about losing one idiot when they can later be replaced by another? But I get it now.”
“Okay,” Sherlock says.
“John,” Sherlock says. He sounds hurt. John wants to pull out and turn Sherlock onto his back and look him in the eyes and kiss him and tell him that everything’s alright, that John loves him, that John doesn’t care who he is,
“I left you a note.”
“Where did you get that?” he asked, realising vaguely that he didn’t sound like a man who knew what was going on in his life.
“You were very drunk,” Sherlock says. He should do something. Probably he should go back to his bedroom and put some clothes on. Or alternatively he could make tea. But it seems he’s unable to do anything except stare at John, who’s sitting on his sofa in 221B Baker Street, exactly where John
He did the only thing he could do. He saved John.
in your ribs. You actually… How did you even get here? By taxi?”
“…is that what you want, then? For me not to…”
“I don’t
“…Sherlock?” Greg says.
“So I thought,” Sherlock says, pushes his elbows against the table and stands up. John rushes to the living room, takes a blanket and comes back, wraps Sherlock in it and kisses him. “I’m alright, John.”
He realises he doesn’t remember his mother’s name. He waits for a few days for it to come back but instead, he starts wondering if he ever remembered it. Actually, there’re a lot of things he doesn’t remember even though maybe he should: all the places where he’s lived, who his friends were before Afghanistan, did he ever smoke, has he tried drugs, what kind of clothes he wore as a kid, who his grandparents are, all kind of stuff. He’s too young for dementia but sometimes improbable things happen, he knows that, he’s a doctor. Maybe he should get himself checked. He mentions this to Sherlock in the living room one evening, when he’s watching TV and Sherlock is reading. Sherlock says it’s nothing and that he would know if John had dementia. But he’s looking at John like one might look at a dying man.
“Anything,” John says, “I’m terribly afraid you can get anything. But, okay, how about a blow job?”
“You won’t see any,” Sherlock said, “because I’ll be drinking it. John, this is a bad idea.”
“No,” Sherlock said and then sighed, “I don’t know. You smell
“Yeah,” John says.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, blinking, “yes, I suppose you did.”
“But I’m trying not to attack you.”
They don’t talk about the sex scene. Actually, they barely talk at all. John dozes off, leaning against Sherlock’s shoulder, and Sherlock tries to stay absolutely still so that John doesn’t wake up. Eventually, John does. He apologises and looks adorably flustered and Sherlock wonders what would happen if he said it now. Right now. He could just do it. He would say something like
“Of course you are,” Mycroft said. “I noticed that you didn’t kill him.”
“Really?” Sherlock asked, sounding sceptical.
“And maybe you could tell me your name,” John Watson said. “I’m kind of beginning to think that you aren’t a burglar, so you could introduce yourself.”
if you almost… Sherlock, I fucking care about you.”
“Does your head hurt?”
Sherlock holds the phone against his ear. John breathes in and out.
“Yes, I am.”
“I don’t have anything today,” John says slowly. “If you like, I can stay.”
“I watched
“If you’re worried about Sherlock, maybe you should do this yourself.”
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson says. “Well, that’s exciting.”
think this movie,
“Well,” John says finally, frowning. “That was… kind of weird, actually.”
John says.
John looks at him. “So what?”
“I could be in love with you.”
John tried to swallow the sudden spike of jealousy. “…eats pigeons?”
Sherlock’s knees buckle.
“You don’t have to go to your room,” Sherlock said. “I’ll go out. I have to hunt anyway. I’ve been eating pigeons and the cattle blood from Tesco. That’s not good.”
They do other things, too. John is surprisingly innovative, but he only laughs, when Sherlock asks him if he’s read about gay sex. He still goes to his own room to sleep, until suddenly he doesn’t anymore. They have sex, they fall asleep, they wake up and John is in Sherlock’s bed, drooling on Sherlock’s pillow.
John took a deep breath.
“Yes, I am,” Sherlock said.
“You appear considerably distressed,” Sherlock said. “That’s highly atypical behaviour for you, since you are very confident about your skills as a doctor.”
“I don’t care if you’re inexperienced,” John said, pushing his fingers into Sherlock’s hair. “And you’re allowed to be nervous. I’m nervous, too. I haven’t done this before. I told you that.”
“Do you realise,” John says, “that anything is
you never let
“You would’ve tried what?”
“Sherlock,” John said slowly, “you look hungry. You look hungry all the time, and especially when you look at me. You even look hungry after we’ve just had sex.”
” John says slowly, stroking the damp strands of hair at Sherlock’s neck. “You aren’t a drug addict.”
John’s not worried. He’s happy. He’s in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes and he’s happier than he’s ever been, which he supposes technically isn’t much, but it
Sherlock closes his eyes.
John knew what was going on in his life. He wasn’t
Sherlock stared at him. “That’s different. You were at war.”
but I’m angry, and I don’t… I don’t think these emotions mix well. Like, I don’t know, alcohol and drugs. I feel like I don’t have a fucking clue what to do.”
“John?”
“I know,” Sherlock says, and something in his eyes falters. “That was… that was a little bit surprising, even though I think I should have seen it coming. But the kissing part… I didn’t see
“In my mouth.”
“You were a drug addict,” John says. “That’s why I couldn’t find anything.”
So, everything was fine. Everything was more than fine, really. John had a new boyfriend, or… John had Sherlock, which was absolutely fucking perfect and terrifying and everything John had never realised he hoped for. John was happy.
killed people. I’m not proud of it.”
you wouldn’t, we are… I know you, Sherlock. I just meant –“
“John,” Sherlock says in a small voice.
Apparently he is.
“Listen,” John says, looking at the screen. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to say to you but I’ve never said.”
John swallows.
“I’m sorry,” John says and stands up. “I’m sorry, I have to… Food. For Sherlock. He hasn’t eaten. I need to… See you later, Mrs. Hudson.”
“Yes, you do.”
“Yeah, but I…” John takes a deep breath. “I suppose it’s been a while since I’ve been giving interviews. And it’s different with you. Because we aren’t just…”
“Of course I
“You’re cold,” John said, pushing strands of hair from Sherlock’s forehead. “Why aren’t you wearing a shirt?”
“Stop what?”
“Get out of our home,” John said to Mycroft. “Now. Or else I’m going to…”
John looks at him. “I mean, you and me,” John says and takes a deep breath. He looks ridiculous. The movie is set in the 80’s and John has huge glasses that look like they’re about to fall off from his nose. “I mean, you and me. We are what we are, Phil.”
“Really?”
was the one who wasn’t making any sense.
“No,” Sherlock says, steps down from the sofa, walks to the kitchen and opens all the cupboard doors one by one. This conversation is too heavy. He needs a script. He shouldn’t have texted John.
,” Sherlock cut in, “you want to know more. Very well. A thirty-eight year old male, manual labour, kept his fingers trimmed neatly, had cats, probably had an affair with the receptionist –“
“It’s alright,” Sherlock says. “John –“
John swallows.
“From
John. He certainly saw John this morning, stepping out of the car and smiling at strangers. He made certain John didn’t see him. A few days ago, he saw John in London, through the window of John’s new flat. Judging by the focused look on John’s face, he was making a sandwich. And a week ago, Sherlock saw John crossing the road near to Baker Street. For a moment he thought John was going to come to 221B to see
“John? John? I’d really rather that you do
“You wanted to be able to talk with me.”
“Sherlock,” John says again, walking closer with a baby in his arms and an ex-wife at his side. “This is… Rosie came to see me. And Mary, of course.”
The flat became suddenly very quiet. John could hear his own breathing. He didn’t hear
,” John says in his character’s voice, “
“Good,” Greg says. “Now, Sherlock, if you could kiss him? And John, I want you to put your hands on Sherlock’s back and then go down from there.”
Sherlock finds John near to the bar, emptying a glass of what looks like white wine. Something has happened to John’s hair since Sherlock last saw John, like, twenty minutes ago. It looks like someone has run their fingers through it. At the moment, John is talking to two women Sherlock doesn’t recognise, but when Sherlock walks closer, he turns to Sherlock and smiles.
, not exactly, but that was just one of his odd habits: he often stared at John’s throat instead.
John sipped his tea and glanced at Sherlock, who was sitting at the desk, reading something. Sherlock wasn’t a terrible flatmate. He didn’t make much noise, unless he was playing the violin, and he played so well that twice already John had had to retreat into his bedroom before he would start crying. Sherlock didn’t have parties in the flat, never stole John’s food from the fridge, and hadn’t said anything about the fact that John was a thirty-eight-year-old ex-soldier who spent all his days drinking tea and wondering what the hell to do with the rest of his life.
John wanted to tell Sherlock to piss off but he definitely couldn’t, not now when he was still wearing Sherlock’s coat.
“You can read an report about what your skin is made of,” Sherlock says, “later. I made you clever because I didn’t want to have to talk to an imbecile.”
, he was tired. He hadn’t got much sleep last night, and then he had spent the whole day trying to desperately figure out what to do. He couldn’t be in love with a
“I wanted to call you, too,” John says and clears his throat. “But I started to wonder if… if perhaps there was a reason why you left so suddenly.”
“I mean,” John said quickly, “if the relationship is otherwise great, you shouldn’t care about a thing like that, right? Because I really love him. I love him more than I thought I could ever love anyone, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to break up with him, because living without him would be just unbearable, and also expensive because of, you know, the rents in London. So, we should just talk about it, right?”
“I think we should go to the bedroom.”
Sherlock was right. It was different. “You were trying to eat,” John said and cleared his throat. “So, can you… can you survive on animal blood, or…”
“Hello,” John says, standing at Sherlock’s door, looking like he doesn’t know why he came. He blinks and clears his throat. “I mean, evening. It’s evening already. Maybe I shouldn’t have –“
“…where
Sherlock stays in bed. John flushes the toilet, washes his hands, unlocks the door, walks to the kitchen, opens the cupboard door, and then pours water into what must be a glass. Or maybe a mug. Some of John’s old mugs are still here. John didn’t take them with him when he left. Maybe he didn’t like them. Sherlock closes his eyes and listens to the sounds but for a while there’s nothing, so maybe John is still standing in the kitchen, drinking water. That’s good. John should drink water. He’s going to feel awful in the morning already. Maybe he already feels awful. Or maybe he’s still drunk. Maybe he’s -
“I stink,” he says.
John nods again, rubs his nose. “Good. So, maybe I should –“
“I’m not distressed.”
appointment. I’m not… this isn’t…” He glanced at Sherlock, but Sherlock was looking at him as if this was entertaining, which was totally unfair. It was a robot. It wasn’t supposed to laugh at John. “Just go,” John told the nurse. “Please. And… this is really… just a check-up.”
“You don’t remember what it was like to be a human, or what happened to you?”
“Nothing,” John says, but it’s obvious from the silence that follows that it’s not
Sherlock was sitting in an armchair that looked absolutely ungraceful but was surprisingly cosy. John was sitting in another armchair. John still smelled incredibly good. Sherlock wasn’t even thirsty at the moment, but he would have gladly ripped John’s neck open, if he hadn’t thought that would be bad for the carpet. Besides, he kind of liked the way John was looking at him. John didn’t seem to realise what Sherlock was, which made sense, because John was an idiot. But still, John seemed to realise Sherlock was
“I didn’t notice at first. Or maybe you weren’t… in the beginning. And then I didn’t do anything about it. I should have. But I didn’t and soon it was too late. It’s still too late.”
You used to… you used to do that all the time. Roll your eyes at me, I mean.”
John looks at him. He holds John’s gaze even though it feels like John has a hand inside him, twisting. The words are hanging heavy in the air. He shouldn’t have said anything.
“I’m not sure, really. He doesn’t seem to want to talk about it. I supposed it was a secret of some kind.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. Apparently, fanfiction is people writing Spock and Captain Kirk having sex. It’s absurd what people do in their free time. But then again, he’s used much of his being high on cocaine, staring at various ceilings and wondering why his toes look so weird.
“It’s very complicated.”
John closed the door and left.
“But we don’t have to…” John takes a deep breath. “We don’t have to hurry, Sherlock. There’s no rush. I don’t want to hurt you.”
John bites his lip. “Great.”
“I don’t like the publicity anymore,” he says finally. “You do.”
John blinked and glanced at Sherlock. “Sorry.”
you. But it’s a bad idea.”
“No,” Sherlock says. “Come on. I have tea, too. Or you can bring the cup with you if you want to.”
“I can’t.”
“Of course I do,” John says and then looks at Sherlock again. “Are you actually worried about that? That I might leave?”
“You’d do anything I want except leave me alone.”
“I’ll help,” Sherlock said, grabbed the left sleeve and helped John to get his arm free. “Here you go. Let me take that –“
“Yes,” Sherlock said, walked to the operating table and lay down on his back. “An army doctor on a three-year-mission in outer space, used to working under pressure and in varying and highly unpredictable situations, and now you’re still considering just telling me to go and forget about this whole thing, because you’re uncomfortable not knowing how to address me.”
“John, you’re repeating yourself even more than usually,” Sherlock said and stood up suddenly. The hand was still on the kitchen table and John was staring at it. He didn’t seem to be able to stop. “I have things to do in my bedroom,” Sherlock said. “You can bring my tea there when it’s ready.”
“Yeah,” John says. “Of course not. Because you wouldn’t be so fucking stupid that you’d pick a fight with someone just to…”
“Just come,” John says, looking straight at him. The baby looks at him, too. “I mean it.”
“What happened?” John asks, stepping aside from the doorway. It looks more like a reflex than an invitation. Sherlock accepts it anyway.
“And you have conveniently cleared out the whole sickbay from anyone who might witness me coming here.”
“No,” John says, “no, you weren’t. You don’t have to worry about that.”
“No,” Sherlock says. “Of course not. I was just surprised. I wasn’t expecting to…”
“When you drink from me.”
“Imagine I can’t die,” John said and took a deep breath. “Imagine you can do anything to me and I won’t die. What would you do?”
“It’s alright,” John says, clearly lying, but that doesn’t matter. Sherlock goes to the living room, sits on the sofa, in Mary’s spot.
“Sherlock,” John said, trying to make his voice as commanding as he could. Apparently it worked, because Sherlock straightened his back right away.
“Okay,” he says and takes Sherlock’s hand in his. “So, what you’re saying here, do you… Are you saying that you don’t want this? Any of this? Because if it’s just about what we… I don’t need that. I can go on without that. We don’t need to… fuck. But don’t you want to kiss me? Don’t you want… anything?”
“What?” John Watson asked him.
“What?” Sherlock asked. All the rooms where his. He had won the piece of land the building was built on late in the 1780’s, when he had had a bit of a gambling problem. But he wasn’t going to tell that to John. John might be judgemental about gambling. “Yes,” he said. “Yes, the other bedroom is mine. Which one is it?”
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson says and pours herself more tea. “Would you – oh, but you haven’t even started yours, John. Would you like something else? Water?”
,” John said, even though he was, indeed, already worrying about the age difference. “I think I’m going to be pretty busy worrying about the fact that you’re a
“Sherlock,” John says in a sharp voice. “What did you say?”
“Of course he’s still alive,” Sherlock said and glanced at John. “I wouldn’t kill you.” Then he frowned. “At least I’m going to try to avoid killing you.”
Well, it’s more than nice. Now that John knows he’s not a living thing, not exactly, he thinks about life a lot. The concept is so weird but oddly fascinating. And it seems that one of the best things to do with human life is to love. Gently, bravely, relentlessly – to use your heart to love others until the heart gets broken, and then start all over and love again.
“For a hundred reasons,” John says, but he looks happy. “Oh, god, my heart is beating like crazy. This conversation has taken at least a decade out of my life.”
Sherlock swallows.
“Yes, you are,” Sherlock said. “Just… can you…”
He opens his mouth and says nothing.
“Sherlock,” he said, grabbing Sherlock’s shoulder for support, “we

“…there’s going to be blood.”
Sherlock, I’m just… We aren’t going to really do this, are we?”
“How’s your hand?” Sherlock asked.

him. “But I was lonely,” Sherlock says, “and, well, maybe I wanted to show Mycroft that I could. That I could make a human.”
“I don’t,” Sherlock says.
“– you didn’t spit – wait,
“It’s just that I never know what to say. Lines from movies don’t really work in real-life sex.”
This is the last chapter, there's an epilogue too and I'm going to post it right away!
“I can see that,” Sherlock says. “That wasn’t supposed to happen. That’s a complication.”
“…yes?”
“Yes.”
his throat, and he wasn’t sure when that had happened, because Sherlock had certainly started with his wrist. But now his hand was abandoned on the sheets and Sherlock was holding him by the chin and by the dick and sucking his throat. He liked it, but he supposed he would, because he was gay.
“Are you really asking me if I’m sure that I… that I…”
“Yeah, you should be,” John says and clears his throat. “I could’ve been a
“Because,” he says slowly, not thinking about John’s thigh pressing against his, “generally speaking, people don’t like me, and I don’t like them.”
This was a bad idea. The whole movie was a bad idea. Sherlock should have just accepted that John was in his life once and isn’t anymore. That happens. That’s life. You find someone and then you lose them, that’s how life goes, and Russian literature. There’s no point in trying to get your old flatmate back by agreeing to make a movie with him.
that his goddamn face was bright pink now.
. Sherlock closes his eyes for a second and thinks about black holes. Somebody’s going to get hurt in the end and it’s definitely going to be him. But that’s not a surprise anymore. He’s been getting hurt ever since he realised years ago that he’s in love with John and that whatever happens, he can’t lose John. He just can’t. So, he can’t let anything change, and he has to hide his feelings, and he can’t let himself think that maybe John loves him too, because what if he’s wrong, or what if he’s right, and what if John wants him for a moment and then realises how incompetent he’s in love and leaves him.
“I mean it,” John says. “Don’t be afraid. We can do anything you want. We can… I’ll be careful. With you. With your…” He swallows. “With your heart.”
Another thing that had taken him a while to realise was that he was actually a little bit gay. Not that they had done much about it yet, Sherlock and him, but there had been a few conversations that had seemed a bit gay, and some kissing that had definitely been gay, and also John was thinking about all the gay things he wanted to do with Sherlock, to Sherlock, on Sherlock and in Sherlock. He had made a list, but Sherlock had found the list and then had nicked John’s laptop for ‘research’ as he called it. It had been quite loud and clearly explicit, and John had tried to keep drinking his tea but had in fact freaked out a little, because he didn’t know anything about being gay, only that he wanted to do it with Sherlock.
John patted Sherlock on the shoulder.
This is the epilogue, don't forget to read chapter 4!
“Alright,” John said, his eyes moving back and forth on Sherlock’s face. “So, you… you really wanted to kiss my neck?”
John laughs in a hoarse sound. “I’m a fucking
“I’m not…”
Then one day he came home from the clinic and found Sherlock in the kitchen, holding a penis.
, I was just –“
“But you want to kiss me, right?”
“But I have to tell you something,” Sherlock said in a rushed voice.
“Oh, god,” Sherlock says and closes his eyes.
“I was away for two years, and you… all of that.”
“There was,” Sherlock says. “Cocaine addiction.”
“Me and Molly,” John said. “And you.”
“John?”
“With scissors.”
“This is Rosie,” John says. The baby glances at Sherlock. She’s tiny. It should be illegal for something so tiny to exist. And somehow she looks a little bit like John. “Rosie, this is Sherlock,” John says, his voice going softer when he’s talking to her. “Sherlock is my friend. My best friend.”
Then one day he came home from the clinic and found Sherlock in the kitchen, holding a hand.
“I really do love you,” Sherlock says. “I’m not going to get tired of you.”
He glances at Greg.
“Thank you.”
and it’s in
“I’ve had sex before,” Sherlock said, stroking John’s arms, until his fingers stopped on John’s wrist. He pressed his thumb against the spot where John could feel his own pulse. “I

Phil only knows how to make drugs at home. In theory. Oh, god, how convenient.
“…did you like…”
“That’s not reassuring,” John said, even though it was. His therapist had told him once that he had a tendency to get into situations that were dangerous and then ignore the danger of the situation. Maybe she had been onto something.
“Yes,” Sherlock said.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. He’s squeezing John’s wrists. His hands are warm and shaking slightly. “Yes, I made you. Took me four years. It was a treat from Mycroft, after I sobered up, to be able to use his… workshop. He thought I’d make a dog. I always liked dogs.”
“I don’t actually want to hurt you.”
“It had nothing to do with you. You have no right to tell me what to do or not to do.”
“And I had to jump through the floor because somebody had built the floor over my coffin.”
“Yeah,” John said and pushed his thumbs under the waistband of his boxers. Then he realised Sherlock was still sitting on him. “…Sherlock?”
“What’re you doing?” Sherlock asked, looking at John from where he was standing at his bedroom door. He was wearing pyjama pants and a white t-shirt, and his hair was a mess.
, he was just…
“It doesn’t sound silly,” Sherlock says. His chest feels so tight it’s almost painful.
he wants to kiss Sherlock and then maybe have a shower and then come back to bed and hold Sherlock’s thighs pressed against the mattress while he takes Sherlock’s dick in his mouth. “You really wanted that,” Sherlock says slowly.
“Yeah,” John said, stroking Sherlock’s leg. “Yeah, of course.”
“Fucking hell,” John says, his voice hoarse. He rolls Sherlock onto his back, sits in between Sherlock’s knees, wraps his fingers around Sherlock’s dick. His face is pink and it goes down to his chest. He says Sherlock’s name and starts moving his hand, and then he keeps it up until Sherlock comes. In his hand. There’s Sherlock’s semen in John’s hand. John wipes it in the sheets and leans back.
watch.
Sherlock asks in a quiet, breathless voice. He’s sitting in the armchair in his hiking gear. There’s still mud in his boots. It’s disgusting.
Sherlock keeps his eyes closed. He’s sure he’s not going to fall asleep again.
“Of course not,” Sherlock says. “John –“
He looks down on himself again. His shirt has teared from where the blade went through. The blade went through his skin as well. He touches the edges of the wound, only it doesn’t look like a wound, because there’s no blood. He pulls the shreds of skin slightly aside. There’s the blade, stuck between metallic pieces. He couldn’t name them if he tried. And there’s a coppery wire hanging loose from him. Apparently the blade cut through it.
“I didn’t –“
“I don’t remember,” Sherlock said.
“You have a kid,” Sherlock says into John’s hair. “And Mary.”
John is lying on his back on the sofa, watching the ceiling. “Morning,” he says and glances at Sherlock. Then he frowns. “Are you alright?”
John swallowed. “Did they hurt you?”
“…what do you mean,
John gets out of Sherlock’s coat, walks to the kitchen and puts the kettle on. Then he just stands there, staring at it. He doesn’t drink tea. He can’t remember ever drinking tea.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. They are still good together, just like they were the first time when they met, a little more than four years ago. Back then, Sherlock had just finished filming a historical drama in which he had a love triangle with Keira Knightley and Tom Hardy. In eight months, he would become kind of famous for that movie, but he didn’t know it yet. And John had appeared in a few decent television movies aside from making side roles in everything from Emmerdale to Heartbeat for over fifteen years. Then they both got casted in
him. John opened his zipper and touched his penis and was trying to make him come. He would have, if John hadn’t thought about Mary and stopped.
, Sherlock thinks.
“No,” Sherlock says, “but I can. I probably should leave now, actually.”
“It’s alright,” Sherlock says. He feels oddly calm. Almost like in a dream.
“I don’t need a
He didn’t want to kill them, anyway. Killing humans meant he had to clean up after himself. If possible, he kept humans alive, because when he left them on their own after feeding from them, they fucked off as soon as they could and saved him the trouble of cleaning the mess. A dead human, however, was always a problem. They didn’t weight much, but they stared at him with their dead eyes. Somehow, they always managed to look disappointed, which reminded him of his brother. It was not pleasant.
He took a deep breath, but that only brought the smell of John Watson’s blood into his nostrils. Considering that he had just slept for sixty-five years, it was hardly surprising that he was thirsty. He needed to drink. If he didn’t, he would probably lose his self-control in about half an hour and end up sinking his teeth into John Watson’s throat and drinking every single drop of blood that John Watson possessed in his tiny human body.
John squeezed the armrests with both hands. He fucking needed tea. “I’m going to make tea,” he said and stood up. “Would you like a cup?”
“Sherlock,” John says and stops his hands.
Sherlock gets them a taxi, pushes John inside, gives the driver John’s address and fastens John’s seatbelt. Then he tries to keep John from falling against him, but that turns out impossible, so he just shifts onto the middle seat and lets John lean against his shoulder. John is talking about the movie now, saying incoherent things like
“I don’t think I have a heart,” Sherlock says, but he doesn’t sound sure. He lets John kiss him, and he lets John push him gently down against the mattress. John kisses him on the crook of his neck, then down on his throat, then the hollow under his neck. He feels impossibly fragile. Just a human. Just a human, blood and bones, could break so easily. But John isn’t going to break him.
sex.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock sighs and looks up at him. He looks back at Sherlock. This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy, but it’s also everything that he has.
He tells Sherlock they can do anything. He could use his hand on Sherlock, or his mouth. But Sherlock is lying on his back on the bed now and the glistening on his skin isn’t from the shower anymore, it’s sweat. He’s shaking. He wraps his feet around the small of John’s back and John wriggles closer. John says he doesn’t have a condom. Sherlock laughs at him and says it’s alright. He says they need lubricant and Sherlock pulls a tube from the drawer. He tells Sherlock he wants to go slowly and at least Sherlock lets him have that.
John woke up in the middle of the night. Everything seemed to be alright, except Sherlock was sitting on him.
John sighs and sips his tea. His hands are shaking.
“Tell me,” John said, putting some effort into sounding like a doctor. “Does it feel good?”
“If you’re so keen on hurting yourself,” John says slowly, “I could do it. Would be safer that way. I could put something in your ass, a finger, or… a toy. And then I’d slap you.”
But there’s something else, too. A lot of something else.
He knocked first. Then he tried to push. Then he got slightly frustrated. Apparently he had overslept. The last time that had happened had been in the last century, and when he had woken up, it had turned out he had missed Thomas Alva Edison inventing the light bulb. He just wished nothing significant had happened this time.
“About five litres,” Sherlock said and rubbed his temple with his thumb. “We aren’t going to do this today, John. I’m too distracted.”
“But she knows you’re interested, and she lets you be alone with me.”
John pulled his hand away. “Yeah. I’m just going to… Try to relax, okay?” He was pretty sure that Sherlock laughed at him, but the laughter broke off when he brushed his finger against Sherlock’s perineum.
“No,” John cuts in, “we haven’t talked about it enough, because I’m still fucking angry. I’m fucking
“I have a life. I have a…” John takes a deep breath, sits down in the closest chair, looks at Sherlock. Turns away. Rubs his face with his palm. He looks tired, too little sleep, only five or six hours, John needs seven. Might need even more these days. He looks older.
“You’re
John pokes him in the thigh with his knee. “Love is repetitive, you arse.”
“Die,” Sherlock said, “so to speak. No, I don’t.” He took a deep breath. He was shivering a little, which made perfect sense, because he was sitting there without clothes. John fought the urge to cover him up with something. “But my other choice is to let people do what they want with me.”
“And you agreed,” John says slowly, “because I’d be in.”
“Yeah. Of course.”
Sherlock’s appointment was late in the evening – well, what they called ‘evening’ in a starship, anyway. Mike had left already and only one of the nurses was still working. John waited until Sherlock was supposed to come in five minutes, and then he told her she could take a coffee break. She was just about to leave when the door opened.
“So, are you… are you
Sherlock looks at him and almost forgets to read his lines. John made his life better, too. Before. Before he messed up.
“I’m sure she won’t mind,” says a woman’s voice.
“I found a place to live, but I need a flatmate,” John said, still holding his hand. “So, I think we’re going home.”
“What?” Sherlock asks, glancing at John. They are in the kitchen, making dinner. John is cutting onions. He looks tired, probably because he spent the last two weeks in the goddamn Los Angeles.
someone, it’s… it’s… I can’t even tell you, that’s how bad it is. I felt like it ripped me open and took everything good in me and threw it away. I don’t think I would’ve pulled through if it wasn’t for Mary –“
“Should I take my clothes off?”
Sherlock blinks at him. He’s more beautiful than any man John’s ever seen.
He glanced at Sherlock again. Sherlock was frowning at the hand.
angry, but mostly I’m… I don’t know what I am. But I’m going to forgive you. Of course I am. But you have to realise how
, you have to –“
“Why?” he asks. The skin doesn’t come easily. Maybe it’s glued to… whatever it is that he’s made of. Metal. He’s made of metal. Just like the robots in those pictures.
, everyone is old,” Sherlock said. He sounded a bit offended. That was just unfair.
like that. Exactly like that. And I thought,
“Don’t lie to me.”
“I made you think you’re normal.” Sherlock glances up at him, then frowns and sticks the needle through his skin again. It stings. He clings to the sensation. “And you had no reason to think otherwise, not at first. So, you believed it. You saw the facts that supported your beliefs and ignored the rest.”
But the things were good now. Still slightly weird perhaps, but John was dealing with it. At least now he understood what was going on.
That’s not true. That’s absolutely not true. He tells John things. A lot of things. More things than he’s ever told anyone else. John should know that. He should tell John tell that, but he can’t speak, because John is holding his penis in his hand.
John cleans his wounds, stops his nose from bleeding, pokes at his ribs, murmurs half-hearted apologies when he lets out involuntary gasps of pain. The light of the kitchen lamp is hanging over him, too bright. At some point he realises he’s getting hard, or maybe he’s hard already, he doesn’t know, and he doesn’t know for how long he’s been, and he doesn’t know if John notices, but John must, because he’s hands are very low on Sherlock’s stomach right now. Maybe there’s a print of a boot there.
“Fifteen days,” Sherlock says. They went for a pint, as people say. It was weird. John had beer and Sherlock had orange juice. The three nicotine patches under his sleeve made him jumpy. When they were about to leave, John touched Sherlock’s back and kept his hand there for almost two seconds, then pulled his hand away and said
And love, John thinks, is made of little things. For example, when he makes Sherlock a cup of tea even though he doesn’t drink tea himself. Or when he decides he’s going to forgive Sherlock – not yet, but soon. Or when he realises Sherlock’s feet are cold and gets Sherlock’s socks from the bedroom because the bastard is too lazy to get off the sofa. Or when he blackmails Sherlock into promising to try to sleep at least four hours every night. Or when he tells Sherlock he loves him the first time after he got stabbed and realised he’s a goddamn robot, and Sherlock looks at him as if it’s a miracle.
“Yeah, we’re definitely taking a five now,” the producer says.
John swallowed. Honey. They needed to buy honey. He needed to buy honey. Sherlock had eaten the whole jar. Of honey. A hand on the table. A dead hand on the table, and Sherlock’s hand holding it… “Sherlock?”
But I wondered. Sometimes. I thought that maybe it just wasn’t your thing. Like, at all. Maybe you don’t even jerk off. Or you do but only when you absolutely need to, and it’s clinical, you think of… the periodic table or something.”
John wants to dance, so they dance. The music is too loud and also very bad. John’s not a good dancer. Sherlock watches him for a while and then pulls him close. He comes easily. Someone’s taking pictures. It doesn’t matter. John pushes his nose against Sherlock’s neck and then pulls away and laughs. It sounds like John is acting, but his hands on Sherlock’s back feel real. They always did.
, and that’s just…” He slides forward on the table until he almost falls over. Sherlock opens his eyes and looks at him but doesn’t move away. He wants to get onto the floor and bury his head in Sherlock’s lap and ask Sherlock to pet his hair. He wants to kiss Sherlock on the mouth. He wants to hit Sherlock in the face, because nobody should do that, nobody should be allowed just to
John smiled at Sherlock, holding Sherlock’s hand. He was gay.
“Who? Mary?” John glances at him. “Sometimes. I loved her. I still do. In a way. But it just… it started to feel like putting a plaster on a wound that only got bigger and bigger.” John is quiet for a moment. “You don’t have anyone, do you?”
. Right. He should say something. “Here’s your tea,” he said and gave a cup to Sherlock.
Okay, he was panicking now.
what do you…”
“…this feels good.”
“Right,” Sherlock said and stood up. “I’m glad we had this conversation. It was only averagely dull. But now, if you’ll excuse me, I don’t know what’s happened to my London in the past sixty-five years and I intend to find out. I’m going for a walk. Don’t get worried if I stay away for a few weeks. That happens. Unless…”
“And you smelled good,” Sherlock said. At least that was true. “I couldn’t control myself.” That was true as well.
Sherlock can hear John breathing. “I just… You promised you’d tell me if you started using again. I thought, maybe you had…”
“I’m not proud of it,” he said quickly, “but I was lonely and I just wanted to sit in a room full of people, and
“I don’t think so. I think it’s going to be very exciting.”
“So,” John says and clears his throat, clears it again, “
John Watson’s eyes went suddenly bigger and rounder. “Like… sex?”
“It’s alright,” John said, staring at Sherlock. “I just… It was so sudden.”
“They want to see it on my face,” Sherlock said, “or… feel that I’m tense, that it stings. Part of the fantasy.”
“And you wouldn’t stop me.”
Sherlock shakes his head. There are some things he’s wanted to say for so long that maybe they have become impossible to say. On the screen, he looks like he’s in love with John Watson. He also feels it inside him. Sometimes it feels good and sometimes not so much. These days, it often feels as if he’s been having a very long conversation with himself about why it’s alright that he will never get what he wants.
. It’s just that one time, I was having sex with someone and I got a little distracted and they tried to stab me. But I was thirsty. I’m not thirsty now. I took a walk in the park.”
“And I want obligations,” Sherlock says. “I want obligations, John.”
“Yes, I know its nutritional value is minimal,” Sherlock said and sighed loudly. “But really, I’ll be fine. You’re making tea.”
“John,” he said and then paused. His voice was the same, but still different.
“Mary told me to be gentle with you.”
“I could do it again,” Sherlock says. He feels like he’s holding his breath. Then he realises he actually is.
“I didn’t know how to do it,” Sherlock says quickly. He needs to say something to fix this, only he doesn’t know what, or what exactly he’s trying to fix. “I still don’t. You said you want to be friends again, do you remember, you said that in my trailer. When we were filming. In Cornwall. You said so. But I don’t know how. You aren’t
, that was… He fucking wished he would’ve known what it felt like, because judging by Sherlock’s face… He wished he’d have been so sensitive down there, too, and then he wanted to hit himself on the face for thinking that, because he wasn’t jealous, of course not, that was a terrible thought,
“…what?”
“I don’t fucking know,” John says and then takes a deep breath. “I had to read about it on Twitter, Sherlock. My publicist sent me a fucking screenshot. A
“He’s going to have to stay here tonight,” John says to Mary.
“You –
“Don’t say
“…yeah? Like what?”
quit, actually. He tried to write poems. They turned out terrible. And then he ran out of money so many times that Mycroft started to get irritated, and at that point he realised acting is pretty much the only thing he can do. “But I also wanted to see you,” he adds, because John is still standing there, still looking at him as if there’s something that Sherlock could say that would fix things. It’s too bad that he can only say the right words when they are written in a script.  “I missed you, John.”
There are busy days with cases and slow days with the two of them staying home in Baker Street. Sometimes Sherlock still disappears and doesn’t tell John where he’s going, but that rarely happens anymore. John doesn’t wonder why he never asks Sherlock. It’s not that he doesn’t want to know, because he trusts Sherlock, doesn’t he? Of course he does. And at least he’s pretty sure Sherlock isn’t sneaking out of the flat to have a fair with someone else. He laughs out loud when the thought pops into his mind, and Sherlock glances at him from the sofa and asks what is so funny. He doesn’t say.
“And I see it, all the time,” Sherlock cuts in, “I see other people having family that they actually get on with, and friends, and lovers, spouses, girlfriends and boyfriends, all that. And I never do. I can pretend up to certain point but it’s not real. I thought that maybe, maybe if I made you, it’d feel real, because you would be…”
“Apparently,” Sherlock said. He would have to talk to Mycroft about it. Maybe in the next century.
“It might.”
“…so, are you excited?”
But John is different. He needs to get John back. He needs to
John stares at him.
“Sherlock,” John said, and then he added something that was more like ‘
,” John says. He wants to get away from Sherlock, and he wants to hit Sherlock in the face and kiss Sherlock and wrap himself around Sherlock and never let go. The place where Sherlock is touching him feels real. It’s the only thing that feels real right now.
“I live here,” Sherlock said. The human was trying to wriggle free, so Sherlock pressed him tighter against the floor. He tried not to crush the human’s fragile human bones, though. He didn’t want that mess in his living room, not when he had just woken up.
“Or I could,” John begins and touches his knee. He flinches. “I could slap you.”
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
“Of course,” John says and then opens the door. He’s still not looking Sherlock in the eyes. He looks like he’s in a rush but doesn’t know where to. “Good night, Sherlock.”
“So, that’s what you’ve been thinking about?” Sherlock asks. “What I did until four years ago?”
He leaves as quickly as he can.
“We could find out,” John says, then frowns at himself. Takes the condom off, winces while doing it. “We could find out what you like.”
“…I’m not going to
Pre-Reichenbach, pre-slash.
John turns the volume down. The interview ends, and the next clip, it turns out, is John and Sherlock three years ago, in a BBC interview right before
you, I was only trying to drink your blood.”
“But maybe I shouldn’t have touched your…”
“Just come here,” he said.
John should leave. He should take his things and go and never think about Sherlock again. He should take this bloody excuse of a life that Sherlock has thrown at him and go do something with it, something that wouldn’t involve Sherlock. He’s so angry it’s hard to look Sherlock in the eyes, and also he can’t stop looking.
John pokes him at the ribs, but nicely. And after that, he slides down onto the floor as Sherlock starts rubbing the mould from the back wall of the fridge. He opens Sherlock’s zipper, then has to get onto his knees, because he can’t reach otherwise. It’s terribly awkward and unpractical. He should stop and say that he’s going to do this later in bed. Or in the living room, at least. He’s pretty sure Sherlock’s going to end up dropping mould onto him. But he doesn’t say any of this, and instead he pushes Sherlock’s pants down just enough that he gets Sherlock’s dick free, and then he licks around the shaft.
, Sherlock. We
“I mean it.”
He was an idiot. “Really? You’d do that now?”
John feels very cold. He takes a better grip on Sherlock’s hips, pulls almost all the way out of Sherlock and then pushes right back in. The whimper Sherlock lets out sounds so
“…really?”
“God, yes,” he said and tried not to poke Sherlock at the face from excitement when Sherlock leaned closer and finally closed his mouth around John’s dick.
And then he had a feeling. It was the feeling of having had the same feeling before, and he also knew
“Bloody hell,” John said, sat up on the sofa and reached to grab today’s newspaper from the sofa table. He covered his lap with the paper and adjusted his trousers under it.
Sherlock stands up. “What do you mean, it is what it is?”
“…nothing, I –“
“On your cheeks. Until they’d go red.”
“Her name is Amanda,” John says. “You really should try to learn the names of my girlfriends, Sherlock.”
“You should’ve closed your eyes.”
“…how long ago was that?”
Later:
“Yeah,” John says. “This place hasn’t changed.”
things.”
“And I don’t know why I thought it’d be a good idea to have this conversation
“We can’t what?”
Sherlock listens as John walks into his bedroom and closes the door. Maybe John would lock the door, if only there was a lock in it.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “I need to find John.” He turns away, then remembers he’s supposed to be polite and smiles at Tom Hardy. There’s nothing wrong with Tom Hardy, not exactly, only that Tom Hardy is not John. None of the people Sherlock can see at the moment are John, and that’s bad. Is it possible that John already left? Without saying anything? Sherlock is quite sure John wouldn’t do that, and besides, this is the after-party of the movie they’re starring in and it’s not even midnight yet. John has to be here somewhere, talking to people and smiling and saying good things about the movie.
“See you later,” the robot said, and then someone knocked on the door and the door opened. It was a woman whose sprained ankle John had fixed half a year ago.
“No, I –“
“Good,” Sherlock said, “that’s good. I’ve been told I have a weakness for bloody soldiers. Goodbye, John.”
“I will have a private room,” the robot said. “And no other people around. Just you. I’m sure that once you think about it, you will agree it is a good idea. You won’t want any of your colleagues or…
“Why did you do that? Why did you ask me to –“
“John,” Sherlock says. His voice is hoarse and low. “This isn’t a good idea.”
“I’m not an idiot,” Sherlock says and then frowns, because that’s what idiots say. And he’s not an idiot. He just doesn’t understand. “What did you –“
“But human blood tastes better?”
The interviewer looks confused, then laughs. John laughs, too, and then pats Sherlock on the knee.
“Sherlock,” John says, his voice too quiet now. Like an end of a conversation. “I don’t think you can fix this.”
in a confused tone.
“No,” Sherlock shouts back. His voice comes out too sharp, but he can’t help it. “Absolutely not. You don’t need to go.”
“No,” John says, sharply, then breathes out. “Maybe. I don’t know. I don’t think we should do this. But I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s like… I’ve decided that I’m not angry at you anymore, but I just… it just won’t go away.”
“Don’t worry,” John said. So, he was going to jerk Sherlock off. That was what he was going to do. “You’re doing well.”
“But eventually I’m going to kiss Sherlock,” John says and frowns. “Sorry, was that a spoiler? I guess everyone’s seen the trailer already. They know we’re going to have sex.”
“How do you know what mud tastes like?”
“He’s a military doctor,” Mycroft said, “so he knows how to kill people efficiently or stop them from dying, whatever is more practical at the time. The only family member he has left is his sister with whom he barely talks, so if you kill him, you have plenty of time to hide the corpse before anyone misses him. And he has a habit of making very questionable life choices. A perfect companion for you, then. I believe you will like him.” Mycroft frowned. “Unless you eat him. And then I believe he will be tasty.”
Sherlock swallows. “Oh?”
“Yeah,” John says, his voice more serious now. “Sherlock?”
He gets sperm on his shirt and mould in his hair, but later, he also gets a very slow fuck in bed, so he’s winning. But he can’t stop thinking about what Mycroft said.
“Because it was a lot of work,” Sherlock says and sighs so dramatically John’s heart aches, only apparently he doesn’t have a heart.
“I meant the hand,” John said and glanced over his shoulder. The hand was still on the table, but at least Sherlock wasn’t touching it.
John clears his throat. “Well, I’m an actor. I’ve done sex scenes before.”
“It’s something you start doing when you’re a teenager,” Sherlock says. “Or in your early twenties. Or in your late twenties, and even then some people think you’re a bit weird.”
Sherlock opens his eyes, looks at John and doesn’t answer.
“Yes.”
“The new place would be just as empty.”
it’s a movie. We should get back in.”
John touches Sherlock’s hand briefly under the duvet. No one can see that. No one knows, except Sherlock.
“Not bad weird, though,” John says. He sounds nervous, and as if something’s creeping into his voice that he tries to keep out. He didn’t use to sound like that, before. Or maybe Sherlock just doesn’t remember. You can’t trust your memory, so he’s heard, and you definitely can’t trust it if you were high at the time. “Right?” John says in a quiet voice.
“Shut up,” John says, glances at his face, then looks at his side again. “Just shut the fuck up. You should’ve gone to the hospital.”
, some of your fans were quite excited about the idea that maybe your characters in that movie were actually in love and not just friends. Actually, there’s still a huge number of fans who do quite a lot of creative work around the subject. We’ve got a few works of art here that we’d like to show you –“
He goes to the village with John, Mary and the baby. They drink tea in the local café, except for the baby, who falls asleep for a moment and then starts crying. John holds Rosie and talks to her in a quiet voice, and Mary talks to Sherlock about all the things that don’t mean anything. Sherlock has a feeling that she’s doing it on purpose. He just doesn’t know why. And then she takes Rosie and leaves, and John looks sad for a moment but comes to Sherlock’s trailer, sits down on Sherlock’s sofa and accepts a cup of tea, even though he just had one.
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said, “it only stings in the beginning.”
John frowned at him.
“No,” he said, pressed his heels against Sherlock’s buttocks and drew him closer.
“Bad,” Sherlock says. John’s fingers close around his chin. John turns his head left, then right.
Sherlock opens his mouth.
“Not in a negative way,” Sherlock added. “I like it that you are here. You have some remarkable features and some that are… surprisingly not annoying. So, I’m not lonely. It would be absurd to be lonely when I regularly spend considerable amounts of time in your company.”
John doesn’t say anything about that, only drags a chair closer, sits down, tells Sherlock to take off his shoe and his sock and then picks Sherlock’s foot up and lifts it and places it in his lap. His hands are warm. They are always warm. He’s warm, John Watson, that’s what he is, warm inside out.
Also, I changed the rating.
“…what?” John asked, looking at Sherlock’s mouth.
“I wanted to call you,” Sherlock says and imagines the smile disappearing from John’s face. “After we… after I left. The moment I got back to London after the rehab, I wanted to call you. But I knew you were disappointed in me. And I just couldn’t face it. And I kept putting it off and then it only got harder.”
“I asked Mycroft to call you. I thought it’d be better if I didn’t –“
“…right,” the therapist said.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, “exactly.”
“I should take the train to the country-side,” Sherlock said, “and find a place where I can kill a deer. But that’ll take at least a day. Are you…”
“Everyone is,” Sherlock says. “It works for as long as you believe it. An illusion.”
“Yeah,” John says and sips his tea.
“I mean, about our characters,” John says quickly, “in
“Don’t you remember what happened to the last dozen soldiers you had fun with?” Mycroft asked.
“Quite a few things, I suppose,” John Watson said. He had got onto his feet as soon as Sherlock had let him go. Now he grabbed the back of the armchair. His right leg was shaking. “Are you a burglar? Is that what’s going on in here? Because I can tell you right away that you’re wasting your time. I don’t have anything valuable.”
There was one more thing about drinking from humans, though, and it was this: they tasted good. Like, really good. Unbelievably good. So good, in fact, that there had been times in Sherlock’s not-exactly-life when he had lost years or decades in the haze of being high from drinking humans. The last occasion that had happened had been during the thirty years’ war. He had woken up in his coffin, his memory of the last thirty years heavily compromised, and his brother looking at him judgingly. The hangover had been terrible.
“Give him a little time,” she says when she’s at the door, ready to leave. “And keep apologising.”
“And you fell to the mud with your face first,” the interviewer says. “It looks very real. How did you film it?”
“Tell Mike Stamford that you found something,” Sherlock said, staring at him, “something about me. Something that’s wrong. I don’t care what. Something… insignificant, that could affect my willingness to participate in…”
“I realise now that it might have been an odd thing to do,” Sherlock said, “since the custom is generally thought to involve two people who are both alive. However, I didn’t have that option, and instead I had a hand that Molly had given me, so –“
“Sorry again,” John said, trying to pull himself together.
“They aren’t going to –“
“Alright,” John says. “Fix me.”
Sherlock blinked. “Maybe.”
“How subtle you are, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft said, barely glancing at John. When John had first met the man, he had known immediately that they weren’t going to like each other. Mycroft seemed like someone who was very powerful and lacked all sense of humour. But then again, Mycroft had offered to rent John a flat that would cost him nothing but was kind of perfect, and back then John hadn’t even known that the flat came with Sherlock.
“You’re my friend,” John says in a tight voice. “My best friend, probably, even though you
“I thought about making a dog,” Sherlock says, his breaths warm on John’s face. He pulls John closer and John goes easily. Of
“…2010?”
, he just said that the script is fine and he’s in. Now, he tries to ignore his character’s stupid name and get through the scene. “
“…orgasm.”
“Sherlock liked the robots,” Mrs. Hudson says. “He had an elephant in the living room for a while, but it didn’t really fit, so I asked him kindly to keep it elsewhere. I don’t know where he put it, the poor thing. I wish he didn’t have to kill it. It was actually kind of nice. It had gentle eyes and it sometimes helped me when I was making tea for Sherlock.”
“…I don’t know.”
“I love you,” John says. “Am I lying now?”
“Because –,” John says and then breathes out. “Never mind. I’m going to take that shower. I feel like I smell of yesterdays’ booze.”
John swallowed. “What? Why?”
“Shut up,” John says, then looks at him. “What the fuck, Sherlock? I’m not turning grey.”
“No, I…” John bit his lip. “I didn’t examine him… it yet. But I’m going to.”
She wasn’t. “You weren’t.”
“…I want you.”
“You said we would talk. You said so. After we –“
angry at you. And I shouldn’t have… But you offered and I… I feel like lately, you’ve had a new injury every fucking
“What kind of dreams?” And John lets go of his chin, then touches his hair with both hands. Sinks his fingers in there. Rubs, pulls a little. “Sherlock?”
“Oh,” Mycroft said slowly, “he’s
“Thanks,” John said.
“I like you,” John says.
At the third time, he’s not even surprised anymore. He forces himself to breathe steadily and waits until the shaking passes. Then he sits on his bed in a tiny motel room in Minsk, staring at the stains on the wall. His throat is hoarse.
“You have?” Sherlock asks.
Sherlock sighed. “I might kill you.”
“Why?
“You’re an adult,” John says, closes the fridge door and turns around. Sherlock is right there at his personal space. Just the way he likes. He tilts up his chin. “It’s none of his business if you have sex. He should know that.”
“… you don’t want to –“
“It’s obvious,” the robot said, tilting its head to the side and watching him as if it could see straight through him. He tried to remember what he knew of its design. Certainly it wasn’t possible that it had a X-ray machine installed.
“Why did you want to hear about how I’d –“
“Hmm,” John says and keeps inspecting Sherlock’s ankle. Sherlock closes his eyes. He didn’t
“Anything.”
never does anything like this. Wouldn’t know how to. Wouldn’t want to try with John, because John is precious, John is irreplaceable. Losing John would be…
Sherlock opens his mouth. “I wasn’t –“
“Why, do you want to meet her?” Sherlock paused and frowned. “Actually, you should meet her. She sometimes worries that I might be lonely. It’d be nice for her to hear that I’ve found myself a boyfriend.”
And then he had met John and moved in with John. John had had relationships. With women. John had wanted a girlfriend. And Sherlock had never been in a relationship in which he hadn’t been playing a part. Maybe Sherlock didn’t even want a relationship. Maybe what they had was enough. It would have to be enough, anyway, because he was almost sure John didn’t want him, and he was completely sure he wouldn’t risk what he had to find out if there was more to gain.
After Sherlock has solved the murder, they get back to 221B, drop their stinking coats at the doorway and take turns showering. John makes tea while Sherlock is in the bathroom, and when it is his turn and he gets into the shower cubicle, Sherlock comes there with him and pushes him against the wall. Sherlock’s knees hit him on the thighs, he accidentally elbows Sherlock on the stomach, and when Sherlock kisses him, he knocks the back of his head against the wall.
“I’m aware,” Sherlock said. “So, what you’re going to do is that you’re going to see if you can make me ejaculate.”
“I know,” John says, “and you will, and it doesn’t matter. We’ll work through it.”
“And it’s just blood anyway,” John said. “And it’s not like I don’t want it. Because I kind of do. And he says he doesn’t want to kill me. But I was thinking, do you think it’s possible that my tendency to not avoid dangerous situations might make me more eager to accept some aspects of our relationship that are a bit questionable?”
John took a very deep breath.
“Well,” John says and takes a deep breath, “it’s nice when people appreciate your work.”
“I still want to kiss you,” John says.
Maybe he should get on his knees.
“…what?”
“Sorry.”
“Just a coincidence.”
“Okay,” John says, turns and walks away from the kitchen so quickly that he collides with the chair. The chair tips over. John grabs the table, steadies himself. Pulls his shoulders back. “I’m sorry about… What I did. The last time.” John is at the door now. “It won’t happen again. I’m going to go now.”
“Something that’ll fit,” John says. “Some of us don’t look like professional models.”
Once, John had come home and found Sherlock wearing the coat and nothing else. Sherlock had thrown one look at John and then frowned so furiously John had been afraid of the damage that might do to Sherlock’s face. Sherlock had said that he hadn’t expected John home so early, and John had said it had been a quiet day in the clinic. Then he had retreated into his bedroom upstairs, and when he had come back to the living room, Sherlock had been wearing clothes again. John didn’t think about that day much, but when he did, he wondered what would have happened if he hadn’t gone upstairs and instead, he would have sat down on the sofa next to Sherlock.
Sherlock closes his eyes. “You could, too. If it helped.”
Sherlock had managed to kill twenty-three foxes before Mycroft found him.
” Gavin or Gilbert says. “Great. That was great, now I want you to do it again.”
Sherlock frowned at him. “Yes, John, it’s a hand.”
“I’ve done
“We’d be terrible,” John says, looking him in the eyes. John’s voice is quiet and hoarse, as if John almost doesn’t dare to say these things. “We’d be terrible together, Sherlock. A disaster.”
“I brought you jeans and a pullover.”
“Yes.”
“There’s no place like that,” John says slowly, “not in England.”
“I’m not going to fucking
He leaned his good hand against the floor and stood up. His legs didn’t feel exactly steady. “I need a minute,” he said and then thought it over. “Or five minutes. Or an hour. Or I might need a few days, I don’t know. I really don’t know how long it’s going to take until this starts making sense. But I just… I’m going to go into my room.”
“Talking to you and walking around the flat.”
“Living room,” John says, tired but determined. The soldier, once again. “Right ankle?”
“We’ll do it slowly,” John said, raised on his toes and kissed Sherlock.
Sherlock holds his breath. If John is going to say that he can
Well, maybe that was the point. But it didn’t make it any better.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, standing up and walking across the room. He steps onto the sofa and stares at the wall. It’s so nice to hear John’s voice. The real thing is so much better than the audiobook John made almost ten years ago, and besides, Sherlock has listened the whole thing approximately thirty-one times, so the twists in the plot aren’t exactly surprising anymore. “I’m fine,” he says and takes a deep breath. Also, it sounds strange when John says it like that.
“I always wondered…” John says, then clears his throat. “Well, not
“…I don’t want to kill you.”
“…what?”
John added another finger and pushed them both in as deep as they would go, then crooked them. Sherlock pushed against his fingers. He was shaking now.
“It’s Sherlock,” John says, unnecessarily, but John doesn’t know it, “he’s hurt, I don’t know what... I need to… the kitchen table…”
“Sorry,” said a young man whose adenoids John had removed not so long ago. The man blinked at him and then glanced behind his back. He was flushed but not in a happy way. “Complete waste of time,” he said and then walked away.
“You should be nicer to them,” John says.
When Mycroft was about to close the door, John realised he had forgotten to say something. “I’m not gay,” he said right before the door closed after Mycroft.
“I need to find a few foxes,” Sherlock said and took his coat. Then he glanced at John. “Don’t die until I get back.” And then he left.
“I tried to quit,” Sherlock says. “I did quit, but then my old agent… She called me about this movie.”
John started stroking it slowly.
John swallowed. So, Sherlock was more experienced than John had originally thought.
“It’s alright,” John says. He shifts closer to Sherlock. Sherlock doesn’t back away. “It’s okay. I understand. This is new to me, too.”
“He’s not,” Sherlock says from so close that John thinks he can feel his warmth. “He thinks it’s a bad idea.”
“You could start dating again,” Sherlock says, even though he doesn’t want to. But that’s his line. A line of someone who wants his old friend to not be lonely and who isn’t in love with the said old friend. “You used to like that. In the beginning. When we met.”
“…yes.”
“I just wanted to warn you about something,” Mycroft said, lowering his voice. “Don’t let him bite you.”
“…too clever?”
JUST A COAT
“…really?”
“Of course I do,” he says, grabs his dick and pulls it carefully out. Sherlock stays on his stomach on the kitchen table. His head is tilted to the left so that he can breathe and, apparently, look at John judgingly.
“I could leave,” Sherlock says. He probably wouldn’t. And he’s quite certain John wouldn’t make him to. But quite certain isn’t enough, and he can feel the way he tenses up while John looks at him and finally sighs.
“What?”
Sherlock walks over to him.
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock says and wishes he wouldn’t have long sleeves.
“You fucking idiot,” John says and hits Sherlock at the chest. Sherlock stumbles against the fridge but doesn’t let go of him, thank god. “You can’t let me do that. You just can’t. You can’t fucking let people hurt you.”
“What do I have to…” Sherlock breathes in, breathes out. Waits. It doesn’t become easier, any of it. “To do,” he finishes. “What do I have to do to –“
Sometimes Sherlock disappears for half a day or longer, and then John thinks that maybe he should get a job. Other people have jobs. But before he has time to find one, Sherlock comes back, and there’s another case, another kidnapping or murder or something, and he ends up running around in London with Sherlock, scared to death, feeling alive.
“How did you know?”
John finds the interview easily enough and presses ‘play’. On the screen, they’re sitting surprisingly close to each other. The camera zooms even closer and Sherlock keeps glancing at John as John answers the questions. At some point, John touches Sherlock’s leg. They’re leaning towards each other, too, and it looks like maybe they don’t even realise that.
Sherlock nods.
Sherlock looked down at the clothes he was holding. “Can I… Can I take a shower? Here?”
“I can’t…” Sherlock frowned. “I won’t be able to ejaculate unless you tell me so.”
“No, I mean, I
John sighed. This wasn’t the first time that he had tried to talk to Sherlock about the coffin. Sherlock seemed completely unable to understand why John didn’t think they’d need a coffin in the living room.
Sherlock froze. “John –“
“I’m not gay,” John tells him and then frowns. He’s not, is he? He’s an ordinary man. Slightly more interesting than the rest of them, because of the military service and the psychosomatic limp. But still an ordinary man.
“Anyway, I think I should go,” John says, stands up and gives Sherlock his empty cup of tea. “It’s late. But… thank you. For the tea. And…”
dating,” John says, “I liked meeting someone nice who wanted to sleep with me, and dating was pretty much the only way I could make that happen. You were always weird about that, though.”
Sherlock gives John a cup of tea. “I don’t think you really want to talk about that. But, yes.”
“Maybe at first,” John says slowly. “But you’re going to get to know me, all of me. I hope you do. That’s the goal. But it’s not going to be exciting forever. It’s not going to be
“I’m not…” John paused and blinked. “It stings?”
“…yeah.”
ridiculous. But also he couldn’t stop. “It’s fine,” he said. “You’re fine. Just… breathe, and… Sherlock?”
“Yeah,” John says slowly, “yeah, we should.” He looks like he’s going to say something else as well, but in the end, he doesn’t. They go back in and spend the next two hours reading the rest of the script. There’s more kissing. And a sex scene. Sherlock’s hands are shaking under the table. He wonders if John can tell. He wonders if it changed anything if John did.
John is staring at him now. “But you don’t look happy.”
“But you liked her.”
“I fell,” he says, walks to the kitchen and pours himself a glass of water. From behind his back, he can hear John closing the front door and following him.
“Of course he’s listening to us,” Mycroft says, not sounding surprised at all. John, however, is slightly surprised to find out he’s able to like Mycroft even less than he did before. “It doesn’t matter. You’ve had your fun, Sherlock. Now let go of your toy before someone gets hurt.”
John laughs. He doesn’t sound happy. Then he sips his tea, doesn’t seem to notice that it’s exactly the way he used to want it, before everything.
“I was not.”
I just… Aren’t you shocked?”
Having sex with John is weird. It’s different than in porn and in movies. Sometimes it’s irritating. Sometimes it’s funny. Sometimes it’s almost boring. Sometimes it’s messy. When he’s sure John isn’t going to leave immediately, he brings towels to the bed and lies on one when John fucks him. It’s convenient. They don’t have to wash the sheets.
“I’ll clear it,” Mary says, and so John drags Sherlock to the kitchen and helps him onto the table, takes off Sherlock’s coat, takes off Sherlock’s shirt as well with brisk movements, no chance to argue about that. Not that Sherlock would. It’s difficult to think, maybe he’s got a concussion.
Mike grimaced.
He watches as Sherlock runs to them, kicks the murderer, throws the man onto the ground, sits on him. The murderer only seems to realise what’s happening when Sherlock has already got him pinched against the asphalt. John realises vaguely he’s not breathing. He tries to but can’t remember how. He can’t feel the air going anywhere, and when he keeps trying, for a moment he feels like he’s suffocating. But it doesn’t feel like anything, either.
“He met Tom,” Sherlock says, “and it takes him a while to realise that he’s in love. And then it’s scary as hell. He doesn’t know what to do, so he starts doing cocaine –“
, John would probably end up saying something he’d regret later. He wasn’t fucking
“Hello, John,” Mycroft says, not looking at him.
, Sherlock, and you had no right to, because I’m not
“Sherlock,” John says and lets go of Sherlock’s nose. It’s barely bleeding anymore anyway. “I want to kiss you again.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “Please.”
isn’t real, he just can’t… he just can’t keep pretending that they’re in love, can he?
The thing was, John thought vaguely, the thing was that he was in love. He was in
“I’ll make us tea,” John says and stands up, then grimaces again. But he walks to the kitchen and not to the front door. Actually, he doesn’t even glance at the front door. He looks like he really isn’t planning to leave any time soon, so Sherlock goes to the bathroom and showers as quickly as he can. Then he spends five minutes trying to get his hair behave and goes to his bedroom to find something to wear, something casual, so John doesn’t think Sherlock is trying to impress him.
“Good night,” Sherlock says. It feels like a wrong line.
“Sherlock,” John says, grabs Sherlock’s arm and pulls him close. “You’re still here. I thought that maybe you had left.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “I’d prefer if you didn’t, though.”
,” John says, not exactly articulately. His fingers tighten in Sherlock’s hair, then loosen their grip again. His eyes are wide and fixed on Sherlock.
“…what the fuck are you playing at?”
“Alright?”
“That’s understandable.”
When he wakes up, his head is in Sherlock’s lap and Sherlock is petting his hair. The television is off. Everything is quiet. He closes his eyes again and pretends to sleep.
“Good work, Sherlock,” Tom Hardy says and claps Sherlock on the shoulder. “And nice to see you. It’s been a while.”
“Didn’t seem happy about it.”
“Yes, we are, Sherlock.”
“…are you sure? Tom Hardy is
me to. I don’t need your
“Sure,” Mike said, watching him. “Just go. You already did, like… six hours of overwork.”
“You can stop talking now,” John said and touched Sherlock’s chest. “No, wait,
For a second, he thought he had made a mistake. Maybe Sherlock didn’t want to kiss him after all. That would have certainly explained why Sherlock answered his kiss eagerly as a stone.
, Sherlock, it’s over. I told you. And she’s found someone else. And I don’t love her anymore. Or I do, but not like this. I…” He takes a deep breath. “And Rosie’s not home. And it’s different. You know it’s different. You
He sends John texts. He leaves a message in John’s voicemail. He says he’s sorry in every way he can think of. He buys John flowers because that’s what people do in the movies. Then, he buys John an expensive watch. Then, socks. John likes socks.
John takes a deep breath. “Well, of course I’m
“Yes, I’m aware.”
“It was four years ago,” Sherlock says and glances at John. “But you look older.”
“I thought it was just an error. When you did that the last time, I mean. The first time. I thought, maybe too much adrenaline. You had just killed a man. It was a shock to you.”
stupid.”
“Sherlock?" he asks. He sounds like he’s about to start crying. Or come. Or both, probably.
John couldn’t believe Sherlock was still there, talking to him about this. Almost like this was important. “You saw that on the television, then? People holding hands?”
“Well, anyway, it’s probably nothing.”
“And we’re all looking forward to it,” the interviewer says, smiling broadly. “Thank you for coming here today, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, and tonight, we’re going to see you two being in love in the new movie
“Was it awful?”
that. We’re going to be friends again. You don’t have to…”
“Maybe,” Sherlock says and places his hands on John’s shoulders, “maybe you could forget you heard that and let me make it up for you.”
“We had sex in your dream,” John says. His fingers in Sherlock’s hair are gentle. But he wants to hurt. It’s in his eyes. It’s in the slow, careful movements. It’s been there since the day Sherlock jumped. It was in the dreams, too. Sherlock should have known. And he did. He
“But what?” John asks.
“Morning,” he says to Mary.
Sherlock sighed. Well, he supposed the truth would have come out eventually anyway. Even if he didn’t end up eating John. “A vampire. Yes.”
John turns to him slowly, pulls his shoulders back, looks at him as if preparing for a fight.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sighed loudly, maybe even a bit too loudly. John had been suspecting for a while now that maybe Sherlock was quite talented at acting. That was the only possible explanation for quite a few things that went on in 221B. “Oh, sod off. It’s not so weird.”
“Good,” Sherlock said, watching him carefully. “That’s… good. Thank you. I’ll just go, then.” And Sherlock walked to the door, opened it, stepped out of the flat, and came back two seconds later. “I’m only wearing pants.”
“Good,” John says, “because I’m here.”
John looks at him sharply as if wondering if it was a joke. It wasn’t. But he loves the way the corner of John’s mouth twitches anyway. Then, sadly, the smile is gone again. “Cocaine?”
Better to suck it up and start using cocaine.
“Nothing,” John said and cleared his throat. “Absolutely nothing. I was just… handkerchiefs!”
“I’m aware of that,” John said and put on latex gloves. “I’m going to listen to your heartbeat first.”
“Yes.”
John jumped and almost dropped the basket. He looked around but only saw two teenagers eyeing chocolate bars and an old woman pushing a cat in her trolley.
“You’re letting me do this.”
“Hey,” John said, reaching to touch Sherlock’s face. Sherlock’s skin was very smooth and cool, almost cold. They should turn up the heating. “A walk in the park?”
“I think it’s been a long time since either of us was alright,” John says and touches Sherlock’s shoulder. “But since you’re obviously alive, maybe I should let you get back to sleep.”
“You started using drugs when you were living with me,” John says. He sounds angry and unbelieving and most of all, hurt. “How can it not be my fault?”
Three days later, John comes to Baker Street, walks circles in the living room, says something inconsequential about the weather. Looks like a soldier expecting the worst. Doesn’t sit down before Sherlock puts a cup of tea in his hands and tells him to drink it.
someone out of nothing and only because they’re
“You’re alright,” John says, petting his hair, then presses his face against the back of Sherlock’s neck. “Can I move?”
“I don’t like the Tube.”
“Bye,” John says and then leaves.
“I wasn’t trying to keep you away,” Sherlock says, lets go of his arm and grabs his knee instead. “I just didn’t know how to… I have never had a… a…”
“Yeah,” Sherlock says. His mouth is red in where John might have just bit him a little. “I should…”
John moves forward. Probably doesn’t mean to. But he does, yes, he walks to Sherlock, cornering Sherlock between the counter and the fridge. He smells of Mary’s perfume, or perhaps Sherlock is imagining it. “I just came here to apologise,” John says, his voice perfectly steady now. He’s angry. It’s in his eyes. He’s angry at himself, but he’s more angry at Sherlock. “Because you were vulnerable and I let it go too far. I’m sorry. It won’t happen again.”
