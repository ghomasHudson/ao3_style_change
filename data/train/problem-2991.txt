A huff of laughter against his lips. “Because this isn’t just about me now take your god-dammed pants off!”
“Cas.” Dean’s voice is as soft as he’s ever heard it. He feels the lightest graze of fingertips across his cheek but they’re gone when he looks up, as if they were never there.
“I’m ready,” Castiel urges, running his hands through Dean’s hair. It’s been so long, so long. “Come on.”
Castiel wanted to jump him right there and then but he knew he couldn’t. Dean was right. His body was not ready. The ass, he thought ungraciously. He was painfully turned on and could do nothing with it. Every position was too painful, or made him panic, feel too constricted. Even the deadlock Dean had on him now was begging to get a little uncomfortable.
Dean is pressing so gently, barely placing any weight upon him. He’s holding on to Cas as if he were fragile, which he is now, to an extent. The angels were fond of choking him. He blocks those thoughts out, concentrates on holding Dean, keeping Dean.
His suspicions were confirmed when the ghost of Marty suddenly screamed in agony, releasing Dean from his deadly grasp. Dean slumped to the floor with a painful rattle of breath and had lain still. Whilst Marty, dead but not forgotten Marty, had burned up, like the film in an old camera, before blinking out of existence entirely.
Castiel doesn’t know how he’s ever going to stop wanting this. The desire for Dean is worse if anything. Now he knows the way he moves, the sharp line of pleasure and pain, the sounds he makes against his skin. He’s never wanted anything on the level Dean inspires. He doesn’t know if this is natural or some leftover ‘angel mojo thing’ as Dean would say. How can he stop touching? If he were still an angel, he would be scared of marking him again with the intensity of his emotions.
He heard Dean hum uncertainly beneath him, pressed his face into his neck. “Were we moving too fast? We were weren’t we?” He felt Dean swallow nervously. “Was it me?”
Dean lets out a low chuckle, “Well there were better ways for him to find out… but he says he’s not ‘
Cas shakes his head to derail that particular train of thought. It’s unhelpful and frustrating. He sits up and considers going to check on Sam, see if he wants to talk it out. Humans are just so domestic. And so is he, it would seem.
Castiel licks his lips and pulls himself to his feet, unsure of whether or not to follow. He thinks he should give the brothers some space. As long as Sam can make his peace with his brother’s new relationship, he doesn’t see why this should be a bad thing. No more sneaking around. More time together and no excuses needed.
When he was an angel, he would never have believed anything physical could feel this good. To be touched and taken apart until you can’t stay still, cannot possibly keep quiet. He writhes and Dean looks pleased. He would never have even hoped to one day experience this with Dean. The most he would desperately hope for, in the back of his mind, was a kiss.
“I want you to be my responsibly don’t you get that?” He runs his hands restlessly through his hair - a motion so adorably familiar it almost makes Cas crack a smile (he doesn’t. It would hurt too much). “When I saw you there, God I was so scared, Cas. I thought you were…”
And with that, Dean bucks up far harder than expected. Using the moment to his advantage, the eldest Winchester uses his weight to flip their positions, face inches from Castiel’s and looking pretty smug about it. His smile is blinding. “Getting a bit shabby there old man.”
“- Me and Cas. I don’t think I’m ever gonna get used to that you know.” Dean sighs, smiling in spite of himself.
Dean kisses him again and it leaves him shaking as he remembers the meaning behind those words. His other hand slides down Cas' bare chest, digging nails in slightly which Castiel strangely likes. Especially when Dean’s thumb catches the peak of a nipple. It leaves him breathless; pushing his hips up against Dean’s, unbidden and restless. Pleasure zips up his spine, pools in his stomach making him fist the sheets from the hot sensation.
“I feel like crap,” He croaks, and realises why Dean won’t really touch him. The action of speaking meant he had to move his face and that was a bad and really painful idea. He reaches carefully to lightly inspect the damage, and Dean’s eyes flicker away briefly, filled with pain.
“Shut up,” Dean murmurs, cheeks flushing, a goofy smile trying it’s very best to break free. He slides his hands down Cas’ back teasingly, until he finds that wonderful ass. He palms the enticing shape through his trousers and pushes him down so they can lie flush together. Cas grunts with surprise. He is still shamelessly easy to distract. And very hard too.
“I like to feel the wind on my skin.” He confesses instead, feeling stupid saying it out loud because it doesn’t compare. It doesn’t even come
It happens unconsciously, without consent. Easy as breathing: spontaneous and natural. Just as vital.
“Cas…” He doesn’t know what to say. Thank you? I’m sorry? That wasn’t how I wanted it to be be? None of them seem remotely adequate.
“You’re hilarious,” Dean grits out though he can feel the curve of his smile against his cheek. “I have this gun oil for easing the way. Works well enough.”
“Hunt went fine. The ghost has been moved on to his final destination. No more causalities.” He chose to ignore the first question, close to babbling. “I think I should get you some fresh water...”
So many times, so many motels have the Winchesters asked to share a room. They have been on the receiving end of many raised eyebrows, all from nosy receptionists who have drawn the wrong conclusions.
That was all he knew at first, soon followed by a large dose of nausea. His head was splitting. His hands were bound. Everything was spinning slightly. Concussion. He was becoming familiar with the sensation, sadly. His head lulled painfully, too much effort to remain looking up, but he eventually managed.
“Believe me, it’s nowhere good.” His tone is grave but a bright smile follows that Cas basks within. He can almost imagine seeing the beautiful light of his soul again. “Like I’m one to lecture but still.”
With that, he opens the door and makes his way towards their home. And if his legs are a little shaky on the way there, that’s a sight for only Castiel to see and treasure.
“What? Damn it Cas, no! No…” He sounds so unsure that Castiel is tempted to throw the rest of that drink in his face. Though he did see a girl on television do just that, so it would probably be an unwise action.
“No. I have participated in sexual activity if that’s what you mean. And not only with you.” He adds to clear up any confusion.
He leans over the edge, taking in the rush of the world below. Pinpricks of light in the darkness. A thousand tiny homes glowing boldly against the night.
“I’m fine, Dean. You can’t hurt me.” He says patiently. Though not so sure about that, it’s a relief to hear all the same.
Sam looked at his big brother with worry, with concern. He poured him a cup of coffee, listens as Dean changes subjects, rambles on about some classic rock band reforming.
When the dark outline of Dean’s face looms into view, obscuring everything else, Castiel realises what he wants.
Dean takes in his brother’s earnest expression and sighs. “That’s a laugh. As if I’d ever hurt Cas. As if I
“Thank you,” Cas responds with a smile, sensing nothing amiss. Dean merely gives her his best and biggest grin, with no hint of embarrassment at all. At least until Cas adds:
“Oh great. So you’re saying we should just burn it all down?”  Dean asked, voice heavy with sarcasm. “That’ll go down well. Not at all suspicious.”
Dean plants a messy kiss on his lips then. “Don’t be. Are you okay? God…you’re so tight. Sure you’re not hurting?”
“Did I hurt you?” Dean whispers, cupping Cas’ face, inches from his mouth. He feels it curve against his own in a smile and fights the urge not to smack him for being mocked.
“You mean you want to skip to the part where you beg me for yet another favour because I’m so important and you’re so useless?” He grins.
For example, it's a bad thing to be caught staring at said Winchester's mouth/ass/general-hip-region by the younger Winchester. He's made himself stare at Sam more to cover this error but he doesn't think that leaves anyone feeling too good about the experience.
Castiel was left feeling as confused as when he had been an angel. Humans were always saying one thing and meaning another. It was so frustrating! It was a wonder they even developed the ability to communicate in the first place.
Dean laughs as their lips make contact, smiling into the gentle kiss. Castiel swallows every breath, his joy and relief. “You sure know how to get me feeling like a teenage girl, Cas.” He says as they pull apart.
He can literally see Dean shrug away the fog of lust again. “I'm not flustered! And my point is,” he shakes his head, gathers his thoughts. “Am
. He always knew it but never admitted it. He wants to make him come undone at the edges. He’s seen the way Cas looks at him, like he could be everything to him. He wants to make the angel lose that careful tight control, mess him up a little. Make him messy, open, vulnerable and human…
And it hadn’t just been a light peck. No. It was not an ‘easy to dismiss, glad you’re okay, let’s shrug it off’ press of lips on lips. It was hard. And it had gone on and on. Cas had buried all his relief, the tension, the frustration and confusion within that kiss. He’d gripped Dean’s hair, nipped his lower lip, stroked his jawline, pressed his body against him in a rush of adrenaline and anger – anger that Dean had nearly left him, anger that he wanted this so much. He had left smears of his own blood on Dean’s cheekbones and didn’t care.
He trails off at Dean’s expression. His face looks grim, jaw set before taking a huge bite of burger to cover up whatever expression his face was betraying. He looked mad. But why would he be mad? Castiel shrugs it off.
“Because I wanted to,” Castiel shouts back though he doesn’t know why. He also doesn’t understand why Dean’s getting so upset. All he had to do was ask. Castiel is fed up of lying, of hiding. If anything, he owes Marty the disgruntled ghost one for opening his eyes a little. Life is too short.
He thinks Dean’s struggling too. He’s caught him staring on occasion, gaze flitting away with a guilty expression. And Dean was down-right unpleasant to the waitress who flirted with himself that one time (“Jog on Mary-Sue. Trying to have a conversation here?”).
“We ask the questions here, brother.” The woman’s voice is sharp, smugly triumphant and comes from behind him. He cannot see her but he can feel the blade she has pressed against his throat.
“And I will always be here to help you,” He answers, voice low and mischievous, though he means every word.
He lays over him, traces the contours of Castiel’s face, inches apart, almost looking shy. Definitely looking worried. “Did I…Did I hurt you?” He swallows hard, eyes wide.
Castiel was just as bad at lying as when he was an angel. Only Sam’s weakness from the sickness stopped him from dragging himself across the country in search of his brother. He was furious.
That, at least, is what Castiel is forcibly reminded of, with every shy smile that passes between him and Dean. Every time they resist a public display of affection to not further traumatise Sam. Sometimes he thinks they started running before they could truly walk. And now it feels like they are struggling to get to know one another again, in a more intimate manner.
He runs the flat of his palm down Dean’s spine and practically makes a keening sound when the hunter responds by mouthing at his nipple. A scrape of teeth and the warm, wet heat of a mouth makes his head spin. Dean sucks down on one and pinches the other with deft, merciless fingers.
He skims his hands over the planes of Dean’s back, feeling him rock helplessly as if he was unaware of even doing so.
Dean grins and rolls his eyes. “I know that Einstein.” He looks less smug when Castiel peels his underwear away. Remembering his own fantasy, he licks his own hand first before wrapping it around Dean’s member loosely.  Dean swallows hard. He circles the stiffness obligingly and begins to pump, imitating Dean’s actions before. Dean watches this whole process silently, mouth agape.
“Butterfly enclosures. Presses edges of a cut together.” Dean answers gruffly, tongue tip poking out a little in concentration. Castiel’s stomach flutters.
“You’re a big boy,” Dean replies, hint of a smile lurking at the corners of his sculpted mouth though his face is flushed, voice less stoic than usual. He considers whether Dean would recognise Cas’ own flustered feelings, but knows they can’t go there. He knows how these things end. With arguments or sex or something else that leaves them both a little more broken. Dean is his anchor. And Sam. He needs them to stay alive.
“Ah hmm.” Dean nods, biting his lip when Castiel rubs against him shamelessly, matching sets of desire meeting as he tries to taste that blush.
“Now finish your pie, my little, not-so innocent fallen angel.” The smile he gives him is quite predatory and Castiel nearly chokes on his mouthful as he laughs nervously.
Castiel glares as the last of Dean’s flesh is hidden out of sight. Stupid clothes.  He scoops his own up and stomps off into the bathroom to have a quick wash. He isn’t very thorough, in no rush to lose the scent of Dean on his body.  He examines himself in the mirror and lets out a low whistle. The new hickey lies on the other side of his throat from the last. This one is glaringly red, a perfect, pouting shape.
“Cas…” Dean sighs against his lips. The best sound he has ever heard. Soppy but true. He meets those eyes, strokes the line of a cheekbone and speaks.
“Easy now Dean-boy!” Metatron has his hands in the air, steps back suddenly, holding in a laugh. “I’m only telling you the truth. And what does it matter? He’d be an angel. He’d be safe! Decisions decisions Dean! Welcome to the real world.”
Castiel doubts that. Dean always puts himself down. He frowns a little, stopping when the wound stings too much and schooling his face into a more neutral expression.
“Yes Dean?” It slips out, teasingly innocent in tone. Castiel bites his lip to stop himself adding anything more. What is wrong with him today? Acting like a teenager…
“Hey,” He smiled down at Cas softly. “You know I don’t care about the scars. Or the sex stuff, right?”
Dean switches off the TV and cradles his head in his folded arms. He can see it. The faintest imprint now on his bicep. Red marks, slightly raised, forming the shape of a huge hand print. Still there – still a part of him, always.
He begins carefully. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for you two. Mental scarring aside, I knew there was always something there between you guys. I just… I guess I never knew you liked men.”
And now…This acceptance. This solace. A vow to try to stop the world burning together. It was all he wanted. Nothing he deserved.
“This isn’t right. I shouldn’t be treating you like this.” Dean interrupts. He whines low in his throat when he finds Castiel’s matching hardness, and presses down into it. That’s incredible. That’s for him. Cas groans and that’s even better. He’s practically sobbing at how good it feels and thinks this may be over embarrassingly quick.
They remain like this, pressed close, trading lazy, sloppy kisses as if they have all the time in the world. As if their heartbeats were unlimited. This is how Castiel always wants to be. Lost in the comfort of each other as if they were completely alone.
Cas sighs against Dean’s kiss swollen lips, pulls his body closer, savouring his heat, his taste. He hums contentedly, brushing his lips over Dean’s teasingly. They’re so good at this.
“Yeah. Thought you weren’t asking me down here for gossip and tea. You already owe me for using that spell to heal your brother.” He grins unpleasantly, making Dean’s skin crawl. “That was an expensive favour - one I’ll be cashing in at the Bank Of Winchester soon enough.” Metatron grins as Dean flushes.
“Oh come on Dean, you are so full of it.” Sam had groaned, looking completely unimpressed with Dean’s puppy-dog eyes. “What was it? Demon deal? You found an angel to secretly heal me up overnight? Bribed Death with some pickle chips? What was it?!”
Dean’s making a joke he thinks, though he detects no hint of amusement in his tone. Dean sounds tired. Resigned. But he’s here. Here on this crappy grey rooftop amidst rusted deck chairs, bird droppings and the iced chill of the wind. That means something. He doesn’t know what anymore. So many feelings rush towards him. It’s horrible. It’s overwhelming. He grips the safety railing tight once more. The city beneath starts to spin.
He shimmies lower, so he can crouch atop Dean’s lap. This motion accidentally causes Dean to grunt with arousal, hands clenching on Cas’ denim-clad thighs. This makes him pause for thought before experimentally bucking down onto Dean’s crotch again, ever so slowly. Just the once. He grins with triumph when Dean cannot contain a groan.
Dean’s fingers, inside, stretching, scissoring. Getting a little less careful as his own arousal tears at his patience.
He’s lying in bed, in his sparse room, wearing only a comfy pair of sleep pants. It doesn’t quite feel like home yet but he’s trying. He doesn’t own much in the way of possessions. Just a few books, amongst them a battered, but beautifully engraved bible Dean had found for him in a thrift shop, and a few items of clothing.
“It’s fine to have what you want sometimes.” Cas whispers against his lips. “You’re a good man Dean Winchester.”
But poor Jimmy Novak had died to give him this body. Dean should be more respectful. It's a part of him now, who he is whether they like it or not.
He can hear Cas padding closer, closes his eyes and leans against the punch bag, locking his arms around it loosely. He can’t bear to look at Cas.
His gaze slips to Dean’s hands. Strong, graceful, calloused and sure. He flips open the first aid kit on his lap and rummages through, eyes intent, frowning a little. He selects a few packages, lining them up neatly across the inside lid of the medical kit, contents crackling.
Castiel finds himself smiling gently at that. The levels of Dean Winchester are staggering. Just when he thinks he’s seen it all. “You don’t need to be nervous. I’ve never been with a man either.” He swallows hard, debating whether or not to say it at all. “It didn’t seem to be a problem the other night.”
Dean finds a new plan of attack. He doesn't want gentle and grabs Cas’ wrists, pinning them to the pillow, either side of his head. Castiel can only stare up at him in something close to awe - wide eyed, open-mouthed, and painfully turned on - hot breath against wet lips making him shiver. Dean proceeds to soften the gesture of dominance by kissing along his jaw line, down to his neck where he kisses his pulse-point gently.
It was the sound of Dean’s choked off, desperate, gasp for air that snapped him out of his pained daze.
Then there’s the threat of the angels still looming over them. Castiel cannot go far and never without one Winchester. The fallen angels have been suspiciously quiet after that first hysteria-filled night of devastation and panic. The world knows what’s out there now. His fallen brothers may not be able to fly, but word is (according to Kevin and Garth), they are massing, gathering. Still strong, still righteous and still absolutely furious with Castiel, if flightless.
He slides his own down so that he may cup the backs of Cas’ hands gently. They leave a trail of fire in their wake. Castiel’s hands have stopped bleeding from the glass incident, but they smart terribly, feeling rough and sore.
Metatron’s head tilts slightly in a way that had Dean thinking of angelic Cas’ old habits. It infuriates him. It’s as if Metatron is reading, borrowing from what he has stolen.
“True.” Sam admitted. “But why do you want Cas to level up now anyway? Has he said anything about it?”
Castiel didn’t call out again. He didn’t want to attract the ghost’s attention as a plan began to form. He pressed down the mind-bending panic, the swell of hopelessness, of desperate fury. He won’t watch Dean die. The salt gun was out of reach, too close to the furious spirit. He needed to get rid of Marty and fast. Dean was going pale and limp and the spirit is just standing there, smiling grimly – more like a grimace.
He feels Cas’ fingers prodding at his torn hands. It’s like a current is running through him and he snaps. “Are you kidding me?” He steps back, shoving the bag at Cas as moves far away from the angel, anger building like a storm.
Dean unsuccessfully lunged for the gun Cas had dropped. Clearly Dean was too angry to negotiate after being been thrown into the wall. Only then did the vengeful spirit retaliate by moving like a blur towards Dean and plunging his hand deep into his chest, causing him to gag and gasp in pain. His spine wrenched back as though struck by an electric current.
He pushes that thought aside, expression falling. He knows that someday he may have to make a choice. He might be able to get his grace back, like his sister Anna before him. It’s what he’s longed for. But then what? Could he stand to forget all this? To lose the intense way he can now feel? To fall back into that marble-like perfection? He’s not so sure anymore. Unsure if he would even be capable of loving Dean. No. of course he would. He thinks he loved Dean before, as best as he could. Dean changed him to the core. He has died to love him.
They pull into the motel car park, gravel crunching under worn tires. Such a rush yet for one long moment, all they can do is stare at each other in the sudden silence, eyes meeting over the gear box.
“I’m worried about Cas too Dean, really I am. I’m just saying there has to be another way.” Sam sighed, smiled a little sadly. “Cas will heal in time. We did.”
He nods enthusiastically, closing his eyes. Hears Dean laugh lightly against his skin. When Dean peels back his shirt collar for better access, undoing the first few buttons, he bares his throat without listening to doubt or irrational fear.
“That’s it, think positive.” Castiel had responded, not really listening. Tucking a feverish Sam back into bed like a demented nurse maid, in a subtle attempt to restrain him. Sam had already made several failed attempts to escape the bunker in search of Dean. Castiel was not going to break his promise.
“What was wrong with her anyway?” Dean bursts out a couple of minutes later, just as Cas was beginning to enjoy his burger. “Who finds a naked dude with no memories, says ‘oh this here is one to take home to the folks!’ gets married, and bangs ‘em?”
“Sure…” Metatron soothes patronisingly, stepping round a puddle of something nasty to cautiously step closer. “But even if he did, you gotta face the possibility that he won’t be the same adorable love-bunny you know now.”
Castiel closes his eyes again, hoping the nausea will fade. There’s another sensation he has never felt before. It frightens him. The fact that he can even register fear makes a cold sweat break out across his body. He may have even let out a moan. He feels less in control of this body now it
He then proceeds to slowly make his way up Castiel’s body, undoing the shirt, button by button, kissing a trail along the tanned skin as it is unveiled. Licking, nipping and teasing his way up, achingly slow.
“It doesn’t matter.” Cas gasps out, lips swollen. It’s not the only part of him that is, a thrilling prospect. “You push down everything for so long…”
The conclusions they had drawn from local news reports proved to be entirely correct. There had been an unusually high occurrence of heart attacks all within the same office block in Kansas City. Four heart attacks within two weeks pointed to something supernatural (“Either that or a killer lunch menu , right Cas?”).
“Need to know we can do this,” He murmurs. “Can we walk away and be okay?” His hands are getting restless as they run up and down Castiel’s arms.
“Oh.” Castiel fights back a blush, swallowing hard when Dean reaches his throat, clamps down and sucks another bruise on his right side this time, without any warning. A groan is ripped out of Castiel and his eyes flutter as he pushes his hips up into Dean’s. The hard line of him finds friction against Dean’s solid thigh and it leaves him aching.
driving me crazy.” Dean mutters childishly, refusing to meet Cas’ eyes. He knows Cas wants him, he said as much, so why torment him like this?
He goes to take another swig of whiskey thinking maybe it will help him find more words. More magic words to make Dean touch him again. He doesn’t know why he craves this so wantonly but he does. His head is fuzzy and his face still tingles where Dean traced it. The whiskey chases down a low burn that was there already though Cas hadn’t noticed before and cannot explain it. He remembers the pizza man and feels his cheeks heat up as he tries to dismiss the thought. That’s the last thing they need right now. Though he wants-
“Don’t want to move…” Dean groaned, causing Cas to grip him tighter, in case he decided to do so. He could feel his heart beating against his own. Why would he ever want to leave the circle of Dean’s arms?
There is complete silence between them as the sun slowly ascends over the sandy landscape, setting the sky awash with deep  shades of pink and orange.
This embrace is slow, leisurely. They never usually get to have this. It’s always a rush to the finish line. A mess of limbs, teeth, desperate grabbing hands and sweaty bodies pressed tightly together. Not this. Closed eyes, just enjoying the sensation of being close, being kissed so deeply. Sharing breath and trading touches.
He ended up as the little spoon once more, held tight in the safety of Dean’s arms. Dean nuzzled the back of his neck, breath tickling, making him shiver. His muscular arms wrapped around Cas’ chest, carefully not pressing against any scars, just holding, caring. Cas had a goofy grin on his face, just knew Dean was wearing a matching expression. Could feel it curve against his skin.
“Because you're being annoying!” Sam throws his hands up in exasperation. “I just need to process this for a minute okay?”
“He came back to me before.” Dean argues quietly to himself more than anything. “He always comes back to me.” He hates the uncertainty in his voice, the little flicker of pain, of doubt.
“Is this okay?” He whispers again, against spit-slicked lips. Castiel can only nod enthusiastically. He’s biting his lip too hard to form words – bucking up into that torturously light grip. He tries not to, but he’s too weak to stay still. Dean makes him weak. Makes him strong too. It’s all such a blur. He doesn’t know what he means anymore. How can he focus when Dean’s hand is pulling him to pieces? He’s watching Cas’ reactions now, drinking him in. Eyes dark and Castiel cannot look away. Doesn’t feel an ounce of embarrassment.
When Cas pulls away to look at him with startled eyes, blown pupils, he practically sobs from the loss of contact. Buries his face in the warm crook of the angel’s neck and just breathes, tries to slow this train down. He feels those hands stroke the back of his neck.
He licked his hand, saw Dean’s eyes darken even more. He slipped his hand back down, teased with the tip of Dean’s cock, made him moan. His confidence flared. Cas had to kiss the O of those perfectly swollen, cupid’s bow lips then. It was slow and messy, deep and grateful. He pulled back to look into Dean’s eyes. The only time they looked away was to see their cocks slip under their combined grip, hypnotically. Cas marvelled at how well they fit together, they always had.
There’s a chink of light from outside that floods his room as the door opens. Dean steps in. He knows it’s him. He can feel it. That tingle in the back of his mind. The source of light is promptly cut off as the door is pulled shut. Cas waits for the rush of light, expecting Dean to locate the switch. Instead, the dark, bulky, shape softly and silently moves closer. Those finely-honed hunting skills on display, sleek and deadly.
He had lied to Sam, to Cas, and now he burned with shame. He’d known how to get in contact with the scribe all along. Metatron had approached him initially, months ago. He’d watched Sam fade away for too long, couldn’t stand it. His little brother was dying. So he’d stormed off, prayed to the one angel he thought might be able to help, the one angel who knew all of God’s little secrets, who knew all about the trials. Metatron.
“The other night…” His Adams apple bobs, betraying his nervousness. “I shouldn’t have just jumped you like that.”
He frowns to cover a grin and sits back on his haunches, keeping his hands to himself. He is actually good at this. Though admittedly, he desperately wants to follow the V-shaped line of his hips all the way down where they disappear beneath denim. His mouth practically waters at the thought. “Take your shirt off.” He orders flatly.
“Lia! He needs to be able to tell us what we need to know!” The biker chided, as if dealing with a bad tempered child. He pulls her back by the shoulder so that he may lean close to Castiel. Although he may be the calmer of the two, Castiel sincerely doubts he’ll like his interrogation methods any more than he liked Lia’s. Lia. He knows the name. They fought together, thousands of years ago. She is a warrior. And a proud one at that.
Castiel hazily throws his hands out across the bed, spreads himself out like an offering. Dean jerks into him, smooth rhythm falling to pieces. He’s watching Castiel, from his eyes, tracking the flush down his body, looking at where they are joined, where he pumps in and out of him. It’s blurring back into pain again but Castiel doesn’t mind. He lets Dean take what he needs, use him, break him. Dean’s choking out obscenities again, mixed with praise, thankfulness and desperation. He’s moving so fast, hips juddering harshly, everything becoming wetter. It’s obscene and so incredibly hot that Castiel cannot look away. He’s too sensitive, the pleasure/pain divide is so sharp, he bites his lip until he tastes blood. It’s animalistic. Dean looks so strong and dominant, so filled with pleasure, breathing heavy and steadily working to a peak.
“Look, we’ll talk about this later, ok Cas?” Dean sighs heavily, shakily. “Jeez that’s got to be the weirdest offer I’ve ever had.” Cas feels his face fall as he retraces his words. Were they weird? Is he too weird? Did he say too much and ruin everything? Certainly, he was forward, but given that they’ve known each other for five years…  He bites his lower lip worriedly.
“Sex with you,” Castiel is clear to emphasise, realising he must have mislead Dean to believe he was still a virgin.
“I’m so sorry.” They can read his thoughts, can hear his sincerity. He’s starting to feel so cold now, shock setting in. “I let you down. I let you all down.”
He was still trying to be playful but Castiel could detect a real hint of insecurity beneath the bravado. He pushed into Dean’s grip lightly. Pleasure fizzing through his veins, mind whiting out slightly. It had been so long.
“I need to be able to help you. I need - ” He feels a painful lump in his throat which is inexplicable. His thoughts are whirring thanks to alcohol, blood loss and Dean‘s proximity. The words come thick and fast through no filter. He’s always said what he means with a truthfulness some find uncomfortable or 'freaky'. It’s only gotten worse since he fell. He finds himself desperately gripping Dean’s bicep, nails meeting muscle through soft plaid. “I understand that I’m useless now. That you don’t need me but I have to help.”
Castiel drops the remains of his burger and sighs deeply. Pre-vessel Castiel would never become so wrapped up in something this trivial. But now, nothing seemed to matter more to him than this ridiculous human’s happiness. So entwined was their co-existence. It was baffling. He finds the right words to placate and pinches the bridge of his nose. A headache was coming on.
Castiel lowers his arms slowly, but does not turn to face him. He doesn’t know what Dean is asking for. Doesn’t think Dean knows either.
He rolled over on to his side, folded his arms sullenly across his chest. They were in Dean’s room tonight. He often spent the night in Dean’s arms now. It was just safer that way. Made sense to share.
That’s nothing to say of the finger marks on his hips or the deep ache of his thigh where Dean had hoisted his leg up. He relishes that good ache, smiles to himself. He wonders how he’d be walking if they’d had the right supplies on them. His heart hammers at the thought as he realises he wouldn’t mind finding out.
They are sparring. In a freezing cold, empty room in the ‘Batcave.’ It has rubber floors and walls reminiscent of an insane asylum, but this doesn’t seem to bother Dean much, who proclaimed it would make an ‘awesome’ training room.
Dean swears under his breath and pulls him in again, laying one long, breath-stealing kiss on him before breaking away firmly, though he still grips Castiel’s shoulders. “Sam’ll be wondering where we are.” He mumbles apologetically. “And we still need to sort out those hands.”
Betrayal. He wasn’t betraying Castiel. Was it betrayal, if you were trying to protect the person you loved? Sure he hadn’t discussed this with Castiel, like he swore to Sam he would. Sam. There were too many lies between them already without adding this one to the fold.
Everything’s becoming wet and obscene. He’ll never forget the sounds of wet flesh on flesh, the sight before him. When he risks a peek he can see Cas has leaned back a bit. He can see those damp lips, wrapped around him, the soft curve of lashes against his cheek. He thinks the angel may be humming with concentration a little. It’s too much. He’s too slick as Cas moves up and down, taking him deeper, sucking, pulling, fucking
Lia pulls his shirt open, stands there watching, laughing as Biker sinks his knife in. He smiles when Cas cries out in pain. They like that.
“I don’t think my legs are working properly yet anyway.” He answered, surprising a huff of laughter from Dean.
Dean ignores that. He won’t even look directly at Cas. “If I can’t protect the ones I love, what good am I?”
A devilish grin spreads across Dean’s features. “Is that how it is? Trying to seduce the truth out of me now?”
He sighs, breath hitching. “Don’t know what’s with you…” He repeats, gripping Castiel’s biceps tight. “And I-I meant the whole – nhhg! – STD issue.”
“I’m glad you’re okay,” Sam states sincerely. He reaches out, holds the hand that’s not hooked up to any machine, squeezes tightly for a moment.
Dean mimed swatting him. This quickly lead to some very gentle play-fighting that had delighted Castiel.
He’s sobbing when Cas pulls harder, takes him deeper. He wishes this was something more. It occurs to him it could be. They have all the time in the world. This is just taking the edge of. If Castiel wants this from him, wants more from him, he can have it, take it. He is Castiel’s as much as Cas is able to be his. Cas is saving him in another way and he loves him more than ever for it.
Castiel nearly swallows his tongue until he realises Dean is probably making fun of him. He rolls his eyes and tries to control that annoying blushing sensation that keeps happening lately. He feels dizzy, out of his depth. He knows all about flirting, but was never any good at doing it back. He feels it’s better to just be straight forward when making your intentions known but acknowledges that not everyone feels the same. Some people find it plain creepy.
Castiel slid his arm over Dean, pulled him closer. He glided lower so he could palm the flesh of that wonderful ass, tease the curve of it, dig his nails in faintly. Dean seemed to really like that if the hitch in his breath were any indication, or the way his eyes fluttered shut. Dean’s free hand smoothed over Cas’ chest, swiped a rough thumb over the peak of a nipple which had Castiel almost whimpering, forcing Dean’s other hand to move faster, squeeze tighter, twist on the upturn until they’re both shaking apart. Dean was squeezing their lengths, easing the way with precome until things became deliciously easy.
you did it...sort of. I just don’t know what to do with that.” He sighs, hand making his hair spiky. “You’re my best friend. And a dude. And
Also, instead of demanding an explanation for Sam’s recovery that night, he chose to allow Dean to vent his frustrations through sexual contact. They parted that night feeling extremely sexually frustrated, both in agreement that the memory of Metatron had spoiled the moment (Castiel kind of wants to stab him in the neck even more now). But the tension is still there, simmering, waiting for another opportunity.
“Why aren’t you asleep anyway? You must be wiped.” He said faintly, propping himself up against the headboard before Castiel could creep away to avoid inevitable, awkward questions.
When Dean pauses his search to give him a disgusted look, Castiel realises how that must have sounded and blushes. “Don’t be disgusting Dean.” He chided. “I merely meant he spent so many hours here. Perhaps that level of dedication just leaves a mark after death.”
Castiel decides to take matters into his own hands. So to speak. “I’m going to kiss you again.” He announces, thinking it would be best to give some warning as he leans closer, tugging Dean’s hands a little to close the gap.
“Leave so you can hurl yourself off the edge? No chance. You’ve got work to do.” The words come out fast and harsh, unforgiving. They take Castiel by surprise, shock a response from him.
“You said it yourself; it was a fake life.” He says calmly and clearly. “Emmanuel may have thought he loved her, but that wasn’t me.”
He misses their voices most of all. Singing in melodious worship or wrathful vengeance. The silence is unbearable. It presses down on him like a weight, confining him to the Earth.
“No you didn’t.” Castiel murmurs, hint of a smile. “I wasn’t touchable then. You said I had a stick up my ass.”
“Fights never are fair in my experience,” The smile slides off Dean’s face. “Not for us anyway.” He amends.
Why are people always pressing knives against his throat? He thinks this one may have an angel blade. He swallows uncomfortably against the familiar pressure as the cool surface presses menacingly against his Adam’s apple. It is hauntingly familiar.
Castiel doesn’t know if now is the time to push the matter. He knows Dean’s not good with emotions. And Castiel is maybe a little too good with them - always blurting out intense confessions that make people turn red and awkwardly back away. He’s knows he’s not exactly the best person to be steering them through emotional waters. He just wishes Dean trusted him enough to be open with him. He wants to know what happened between the brothers. Something occurred to make Dean look so thoughtful and pensive. He doesn’t like lies. They create distance. If he doesn’t have the Winchesters, what does he have? The thought makes him feel indescribably empty.
But apart from those associations, food was baffling. From the concept of cravings, the effort of preparation, the knowledge that you are often consuming something that was once a living thing. Very unsettling.
Dean had calmly walked over to him then, footfalls echoing against the marble floor. He took his time, almost prowling, before sitting beside Cas, winding one arm around his waist, palming his cheek, and leaning in for the slow burn kiss.
He hears the hitch in Dean’s breathing. Those fingers are back in his hair again, stroking softly, avoiding the sore spots. His face and body must really look awful if this is the only place Dean is willing to touch him. “They wanna keep you in overnight, check your noggin’s in working order. Then the police wanna see you.”
He’s picking up a faster, more natural rhythm, hips moving powerfully, jolting Castiel’s body. He’s invading everything Castiel is, taking over until all he can feel is the place where they are joined. His body is beginning to accommodate him, stretching, pain slowly, but never completely, giving over to solace. He’s digging his nails into Dean’s back.
. “I miss my wings. I miss their voices. I miss the clarity even amongst the chaos…” He struggles to find the right words to go with the emotions. How could Dean ever comprehend what it was like before?
He wonders if Dean is referring to his own unhealthy drinking habits or something else. Castiel fleetingly remembers Dean describing a 2014 version of himself thanks to a little trip courtesy of Zachariah. A broken, decadent, human version of himself. Cas had scoffed - it was a false vision or one possible future that had already been derailed. Now he begins to wonder if he’s becoming a little more like that nightmare version everyday. If Dean sees him that way. He shudders and decides that it may be better not to ask.
Castiel feels his eyes widen at that. At the vehemence in his voice.  He’d never thought of it that way before. He supposes it was strange, to marry a complete stranger, someone who didn’t even know their own identity. He clamps down on the urge to defend her, knowing Dean wouldn’t want to hear it. But she was a good woman. Kind-hearted, devout, a little lonely. All soft spirit and gentle nature. He pushes past the memory and focuses on what Dean is saying now.
Castiel cannot contain the shiver of dread that elicits. But he says nothing. What is there to say? He is the reason they fell, Metatron left him high and dry. He doesn’t know how to reverse the spell. Doesn’t have the magic words to satisfy their questions, to make the pain stop. So he says nothing.
He avoided the issue even now. “It’s just…Maybe those bastards who tortured Cas were right. Maybe it would be the key to unlocking heaven again. Then the angels would be gone and…” He trailed off.
He doesn‘t want Dean to feel bad. Not at all. He wants to make him feel very, very good. “I liked it. Very much so.” He says boldly, voice barely above a whisper.
Dean’s words eventually filter through his concentration and Castiel realises a simple truth. He could kick himself for not recalling it sooner. “I’m a brand new human, Dean. I’m clean.”
"Sam and I are concerned for you. Is it the mark? Are you unwell?" He can practically imagine the head tilt, how his hands would nervously clench at his sides. The steady, worried, deep blue, x-ray vision aimed his way.
So he smiled softly, cupped Dean’s cheek with his other hand, traced that full bottom lip with his thumb. “You already have.” He stated, looking up at Dean with adoration.
The warmth is back. In his chest, his bones, even making his eyes sting. Dean had raged at him before. He had called Castiel a ‘child‘, ‘naïve’ and many other hurtful things that were all true. His words were laced with hurt and betrayal. Castiel had pleaded with him to understand. Had eventually explained what had really happened in heaven. It wasn’t enough. Dean still blazed. Furious at Cas but more so with the other treacherous angel.
“What? Do I know what I’m doing?” Dean sounds a little hurt at that, words sharp and desperate. “No. But I’m going to find out. Gonna make it so good for you, I swear.”
“You okay, Cas?” He allows his fingers to overlap Cas’ atop the handprint. A spark goes through Castiel at the touch.
Cas looks contrite, head tilted in unmistakeable confusion. He didn’t even stagger. “I get it Cas, you don’t want me like this, I know. So stop making it so damn hard.”
Dean looks surprised for a moment. The puff of air against his lips is the first warning of Dean’s impending laughing fit: “Oh Cas.” His whole body shakes on top of Castiel, making them both wobble ridiculously.
Driven to an early grave by a stressful job and no one even noticed he was gone. Or demanded that final report he had been slaving over that had led to a fatal heart attack in the early hours of the morning.
Dean isn’t sharing anything with Castiel right now either. The atmosphere is intense, so awkward, that even Cas can take a hint and realise how uncomfortable he has made his friend. He’s surprised Dean didn’t just drive off without him after the case was solved.
Castiel breathes in his clean masculine scent. He smells of gun oil, hair gel, faintly of that diner, and of something that is purely Dean - rustic and human.  He rubs soothing circles against his back, giving comfort.
“What was in the spell?” The blade shimmers in front, red with his own blood. He gladly answers what he can, just for a brief respite.
They are both a little stunned at the finish. They lock eyes, swallow hard, breathe heavy. Castiel’s legs loosen, releasing Dean from their deadlock. They’ll both have bruises tomorrow. There’s just the sound of their ragged breathing, the sweat cools on their body and Castiel has no idea what to say again. What could they possibly say that would top that? There’s an awkward, stunned silence.
Dean folds his arms under his head, content to just watch Castiel it would seem. He continues his exploration, tugging Dean’s t-shirt up the slightest bit so he can press light kisses against the exposed skin - his warm and surprisingly soft stomach. He can feel firm muscle underneath and curiously dabs his tongue against the area, tasting salt and a fine sheen of sweat, tracing the light dusting of hair with his fingertips. Dean flinches, squirms a little underneath him, breathes more heavily. He presses hands against the taut skin of his hips to keep him still and Dean opens his legs obligingly. For one long moment, he’s entranced by those hipbones. Palms the smooth heat of them before swooping down to kiss one. He runs his tongue along the slip of skin, curiously. Then experimentally sucks down hard.
“God -dammit Cas!” Dean shouts suddenly. Castiel doesn’t even flinch. “I don’t know what you want from me. It’s driving me crazy. The way you look at me sometimes… I don’t know what you want!”
“Off topic.” Dean hisses, hand slapping the table to get Castiel’s attention once more. “You had sex with that Daphne chick?”
“It’s odd for you?” Cas manages to gasp out, suppressing laughter. He’s the one with fingers inside of him. Dean winces a little at that so Castiel quickly adds: “But yes. It is good. It’s very, very good.” The words are heavy in his mouth. It almost sounds like he’s purring.
Dean presses his forehead against Cas’ and closes his eyes, breathing deeply. Castiel is suddenly very aware that he is avoiding eye contact. His hips are angled strangely away so that Castiel’s hands lose their grip on his back. He settles for wrapping his arms around Dean’s upper body and is surprised to find he is shaking slightly, thrumming with energy.
Cas blinks a few times before responding in a rush. He doesn’t want Dean to regret it. That’s the last thing he wants. “I have no complaints. I liked it in fact.”
The ferocity of Dean’s  words makes him take a step backwards, until the rail bar digs into his back.
“I mean, I get that you were relieved. And life-threatening situations are always sexy, I guess. Then there’s the adrenaline.” He sighs, “I guess I know
To Cas’ surprise, Dean doesn’t tear out of the Impala as if the former angel had something that was catching. He just sits there, in the sudden darkness, smouldering and still gripping the wheel. Castiel knows he’s going to say something. He can feel it brewing.  Dean has never been the most vocal person when it comes to discussing feelings so Cas just sits in silence, waiting. He doesn’t expect it to be anything good, but is patient anyway, head tilted towards Dean in a show of nonchalance though his heart is racing like the traitor it now is.
“What?” He feels nervous apprehension flood through him. Was he not good? How could it not have been good for Dean?
And with that, he made his way to the heavy bulk headed door. But not before Dean could swoop by out of nowhere to lean close so he could whisper: “If you want to do something reckless, how about you come with me?”
Dean begins to cant his hips downwards, pushing deep, so deep inside. Castiel is soon making strangled noises of his own. There’s something hot happening inside, something very good that Dean manages to find, to rub against only every now and then. It makes his whole body jolt, blending in with the lessening pain. The lines are blurring so well now. Dean is shaking with the effort of going so slow, but so deep. It feels right. Dean is the only human to get under his skin. The irony isn’t lost on him.
His hips begin to stutter wildly and is occurs to him that Cas is letting him. Is allowing him this movement, to take what he needs. He thrusts into that soaking, tight heat and Cas just takes it. Looks up at him for a moment with wicked, burning blue eyes. Dean is sweating, sticking to the floor, His hands grip Cas’ hair so hard it must hurt. He’s thrusting up into Cas’ mouth and it’s as close to heaven as he’s going to get. Better. It’s too much. His stomach muscles tighten excitedly, whole body burning, tightened up. His pleasure is cresting, building so rapidly he’s being pulled over the edge and his hips jolt frantically, Cas practically intent on sucking him down his throat apparently, gripping his ass, lifting with all that strength, pulling him closer so Dean can grind into his mouth. His throat, wrapping round, squeezing. It’s indescribable. Blinding. Ecstasy.
“You mean I fuck up and you clean up after me?” He answers timidly, the curse word feeling heavy and distasteful on his tongue.
Okay. Maybe he understands the appeal of dirty talk now. Dean rarely swears. Castiel has never seen him like this. He has to use every ounce of willpower not to climax as his words sink in, eyes tight shut. Dean’s no fool, there was dark humour glinting in his eyes, as if he knows exactly what Castiel’s intentions were. Castiel can only nod a little frantically. He can feel Dean’s member slip against the curve of his ass, rubbing against him, teasing.
“Interesting,” Metatron muses, smiling at his feet as he paces the room. “I might be able to give him that…Maybe not
Castiel is thrilled. Castiel has found a way to fly again. He pushes back with enthusiasm, groaning happily. Feels Dean’s tongue tracing his lips and cradles the back of his head, short hairs soft under his fingertips.
What Castiel feels he deserves is to plummet off this steel tower, to fall and burn just as his family did.
Pointedly, he reaches out, traces the sheen of Cas’ lower lip with his thumb, before slipping it inside. Obediently, Cas sucks a little, making Dean grunt, has him panting, heart racing. He sees the moment Cas works out the significance. His eyes sharpen, focus, then deftly, he pulls back so he can lower Dean to the floor. He’s surprisingly gentle, dangerously strong and it’s all Dean can do not to fight the instinct to resist being submissive. Not that Cas is dominating him exactly. He falls back willingly, Cas pillowing his head with his hand for a moment before withdrawing.
Half of them wants to kill him to see if that will break the spell of banishment. The other half just wants to plain kill him. Either way, he is confined to the bunker or having a minder for the foreseeable future.  Another level of frustration that leaves him wondering who will break first. He doesn’t want to be a burden. Doesn’t want to be coddled. It is humiliating. And of course, there’s that part of him that believes he deserves whatever the angels want to do to him. A part that grows every day.
“Come on now. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it grumpy.” Dean smiles, eyes crinkling in the corners. “The burgers here are better than sex. Well, almost.” He adds, grin turning a little crooked and Castiel shakes his head, trying to remain stern.
Castiel sits on the plush leather sofa, hearing Dean’s footsteps thud around the bunker. He sways a little, feeling woozy from blood loss, trying not to bleed on the upholstery.
His eyes shoot open. He swears. He curses. He may even have chanted the full, in depth Latin of an exorcism, the way his brain was short-circuiting. Dean thinks he will be lucky to have any motor responses after this. Because this. The way Cas has him. His jeans are pushed down his thighs so he’s just a curve on the floor, exposed with Cas’ head moving between his legs. All that hair, his tanned hand wrapped around his base. Chin scratching delicate skin. Dean’s legs spasm helplessly, it’s all he can do not to scream as he digs his feet into the floor, spine curving in ecstasy.
his brain supplies unhelpfully, though reassuringly like something the old Dean would say out loud. He’s ready to storm out, nothing like a good exit, when Cas is gripping his arm, fingers crushingly tight.
“Here Cas, hold this for now.” Sam presses a fresh tea towel against the cut across Castiel’s forehead. It’s a vertical streak of pain that splits through his left eyebrow. The ugly gash stings and keeps dripping scarlet into his vision. He holds the towel as tightly as he can manage, grateful for it. Tea towels. He can’t believe the Winchesters have tea towels. They are not tea towel people but they have a
It was surprising Dean was sharing his thoughts so willingly with him at all. He didn’t usually. Act first, regret later. That was the way he usually did things. Sam selected the most relevant pitfall to Dean’s plan. “But Metatron used it in his spell.”
Castiel reaches out to him then draws him closer though every muscle screams in protest. He just has to. He can’t bear to see Dean’s pain anymore. He has enough of his own to deal with. Maybe they can help each other. He needs to be close to Dean, to prove he’s still there, he’s fine, they both are.
Dean held his hands up to ward off his little brother’s irate questions. “Whoa! I haven’t done anything yet, it’s all just thinking out loud.” He crossed his arms defensively, trying to look contrite and falling short by a few miles. Sam glowered.
“Are you actually falling asleep on me?” Dean laughs and Castiel practically purrs in response. “Hang on.”
He’s trying to sleep but he can hear the brothers arguing. Angry murmurs that buzz through the bunker, filled with pent-up frustration. They often bicker but this time they really mean it. He can tell. Dean’s secret keeps them apart. Sam’s new determination to cure demons is another matter of dispute since Dean cannot understand it. Perhaps he should try to intervene, the mediate, but maybe he agrees with Sam too much. They need to have it out. Dean has to tell them if he struck a bargain for Sam’s life. And to cure is better than to kill. He can see that now.
His voice is hard and cold, leaving no room to argue. He wishes he could fly away now more than ever. Feels like a scolded child instead of the ancient being he really is. Was. Whichever.
“Your face was a picture.” Cas whispered to break the tension, smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
Dean moans. “Stop pawing at me!” He laughs, cutting off into a groan when Castiel presses him down, writhing up against him. “Y-you sure you were an angel?”
“God-dammit Sammy!” Dean bursts out, turning red. “Would you leave it? Or I swear to God I’m driving off the edge of the Grand Canyon, right now.”
He slides his hands down his arms until he finds Dean’s, and links them gently together. He leads him over to the bed so they are able to sit down on the edge, hands still linked.
It slips out without permission, a lonely sigh as he leans back into the couch.  He knows the healing process will be long, arduous. The wound will itch as it knits back together. No short cuts.
Dean leans closer over the table, pinning him with those eyes, oblivious to other customers. His pupils are blown and Castiel feels trapped.  “And what’s that then?” He hears the dare in his voice.
He suddenly wished his little brother was there with him. But that would be impossible. For obvious reasons…
So when he left the shop, laden with purchases, he didn’t get a chance to put up much of a fight when he was struck in the head with a blunt object, dragged off, and bundled up into the boot of a car.
They end up back in the diner, collar neatly adjusted to hide from the world. It’s as if they’ve fallen into a parallel universe where the last three hours never happened. Even the waitress who brings them pie is the same as before. She serves them with a wary smile.
Dean exhales slowly. “You’re too smart for your own good,” He answers in a daze, eyes on Castiel’s lips. He swears under his breath. “God you have no idea what you do to me do you? I’m trying to be all chivalrous…”
“What is your point?” Castiel asked, an edge to his voice despite the good intentions behind Dean’s clumsy words. He certainly hoped there was a point.
“No Dean.” He orders voice low and commanding. “I won’t let you keep hurting yourself in this way. The mark is driving you crazy.”
Dean sighed, eyes slipping shut, leaving Castiel fighting a flood of arousal and hope caused by his words. He looked so peaceful, lines smoothed out, breath hot against Cas’ neck. He held him and felt something swell within.
“So fucking hot….Who new?” Dean half-laughs. His other hand is running up and down the soft skin of Castiel’s thigh soothingly.
“It hurts.” He realises and he can’t make it go away. Can’t find a way to heal. He cannot even find the right words to convey the compressing guilt and horror. “It’s my fault. All my fault. I feel…bad. All of them. We lost. We all lost so
“You deserve this.” Cas continues, gasping a little. Dean surges up, kisses him while his hands slide to the front so they can get to work on his belt buckle. “You deserve good things.”
All he does is care now. He can no longer push his doubts back, focus on the task at hand like the soldier he once was - so sure even when he was in the wrong. He has to feel it all. The guilt, the horror, the shame.
He may not know what Dean is referring to, or what that worrying light in his eyes means, but he sure is determined to get better for him.
At first he thought he was in some kind of dank cave. But no. He appeared to be in the world’s grimiest disused factory, cold and grey, though his vision was still clouded. He could hear water dripping nearby and was so very cold. The man stood in front of him and Castiel could only assume this was his attacker. He wore a leather coat, was broad shouldered, had long black shaggy hair, and an expression of complete loathing aimed Castiel’s way. Never good.
Dean waited until Sam had taken an unfortunately large bite of melon at breakfast before revealing that dramatic statement out of the blue. Cas was in bed, breathing softly, still curled up in the warmth of their combined body heat.
He calmly continues to undress them, running his hands down the smooth skin of Dean’s chest, bringing up goose bumps. He tries to suppress the madness of before as he processes Dean’s words.
At Dean’s sheepish expression, he knew Cas hadn’t. “For God’s sake Dean! He hasn’t said anything has he? You’re going behind his back aren’t you?”
When Dean spoke, it travelled right down his spine, rough, low and completely unexpected in it’s sensuality. “How’s this for a deal? When you get better - when, not if ‘cause I know you will - you can have me any way you want me.”
Castiel is panting, toes curling against the bed spread. He’s sweating now. Never liked that body function before. It was always kind of repulsive to him. You did it when you lose control, when uncomfortable: too hot, in pain... But this, breathing in Dean’s scent, being pulled apart beneath him… he could get used to it. It’s a good loss of control.
Dean is fiddling with Cas’ jeans then, hands shaking. He is far less graceful wriggling out of them than Dean was. Dean sighs as Cas lets go of his cock, hand sliding over the thick weight so they can break apart and shed more layers. He kicks his jeans away as if they have insulted him and ends up laughing with Dean, smothering their amusement with more deep kisses.
“I can’t watch you drive yourself crazy like this. Can’t see you suffer.” He feels Castiel’s breath ghost across his face, that’s how close the angel is. It makes him tremble with want. His hands slip away from Dean’s face, trail down his arms so he can lightly take Dean’s hands in own. When Dean opens his eyes, he sees Cas glaring at the cuts across his knuckles as if they’d personally offended him. A warm glow, unconnected to lust for once, flows through Dean’s hands at the contact. The skin starts to knit back together.
“You never told me what happened with Sam.” He states, voice slightly shaky and rougher than usual. He clears his throat and waits for Dean’s answer.
He complies, but makes a show of it. Sitting upright so Castiel is suddenly very close, nestled firmly in his lap. Cas has to swallow hard at the predatory look in his eyes.  He slowly peels the hem of his shirt up, bit by bit, muscles rippling. He tugs it over his head and chucks the offending garment away so it ceases to exist for them.
For a moment he thinks the woman, this Lia, will protest, land a killing blow anyway. She looks like she wants to. Instead she nods reluctantly, almost solemn in her agreement. “Yes. He needs to suffer first.”
“Hey,” Dean’s voice is as soft as the gentle way he traces Castiel’s lower lip with his thumb. This stops Cas from biting it, and he smooths over the mark. “Weird is you and I like it, I really do. I just mean I think we’ve shattered enough rules of our friendship for one night, don’t you?”
“You mean, when I kissed you.” Castiel translates, voice low for some reason. He hears Dean swallow hard.
“Dean…” He trails off, bucking up a little against his thigh, vision blurring at the edges. They are supposed to be talking. They are supposed to be discussing something important, something potentially game changing…
It’s as much of a warning as he is capable of. Cas must know. He isn’t naïve enough not to know. Dean buries himself to the hilt, hips right off the floor, held by Cas’ hands, legs either side of his face, helplessly exposed. Dean comes down his throat with a guttural cry, violently claiming.
The bone-deep sensation hits him like a fist. He craves him in a deep, carnal and shockingly primal way. It’s in his guts. His blood plunges south. He feels dizzy, short of breath, heart pounding. He can’t take his eyes from the man. He has never felt this way about anyone. Never. A wave of lust washes over him so fiercely; it’s all he can do to stop his knees from buckling. Or from taking action, pushing the angel back into the wall and taking him right there, showing him what a real man feels like. A true introduction to fucking. Something real, unlike that little reaper of his.
“You don’t hear him screaming in the night.” It’s not a shout, not remotely angry. That’s what’s worst of all. It’s quiet, filled with deep pain. Sam knows what it’s like to have those nightmares, and to see someone you love suffering from them too. He’s shared enough motel rooms with Dean after all. The image is striking, deeply upsetting. He can’t stand the thought of Castiel going through the same thing, of Dean having to hear it every night.
“Run. No. Get out.” He means to shout it, to warn them, but his voice is barely above a whisper. If the brothers are here they need to run. He’d rather die than let these two get their hands on them.
Since the brothers were working on their own research projects, he slipped out unnoticed. He left a brief note explaining where he was heading, knowing Dean wouldn’t like him going alone but finding he pretty much didn’t care about that. He was thousands of years old, he could make a quick trip to the store without anything catastrophic happening.
“Hey now, come on! I wasn’t laughing at you. Not really, sit down.” He says, noticing Cas was about to storm off.
yours.” He admits simply into the top of Dean’s head. A truth so obvious that it’s surprising he’s never said it before now.
Dean gasps a profanity against his ear which shouldn’t be as hot as he finds it. He pulls back a little and Castiel has to fight the urge to bury himself against his neck again, so direct is his gaze. His pupils are blown, lips swollen.
He is overwhelmed by the terrible, visceral sensation. His hands clenching, bound to the chair. Such a contrast to his life lately, Dean’s gentle, and not so gentle, touches. The soul melting pleasure. He thinks of Dean, his eyes, hands and smile, tries to stay with him, stay strong but he cannot escape the fact they are slowly torturing him to death.
Castiel watches in amusement as Dean proceeds to ‘dance’. This seems to involve bouncing around lightly on the balls of his feet like a toddler that needs to wee. Castiel keeps this piece of information to himself though, enjoying the sight before him.
The lightly calloused hands are in his hair then, running down his spine, tingling. He wriggles on top of Dean as the arousal spreads lazily though his body, heavy and welcome for once. He listens to the steady beat of Dean’s heart, sighs into slick skin.
Perhaps he is being a little naïve, but as far as Castiel is concerned, very little has changed concerning their relationship anyway. He has always loved Dean. Now he can show it. Act on such urges.  Now he can love Dean and is capable of feeling it all as a human.
Until the fire alarm went off and Dean pushed him away, gasping. A look of horror gradually replaced the soft-stunned expression in his eyes.
The angels charged at the voice, gone in a blur of speed. Castiel couldn’t even call out a warning. He was so tired.
He kisses Dean’s temple before finding the whorl of his ear so he can make a suggestion: “You can be inside me if you like. I don’t mind.”
He is calm and controlled. He uses the angel blade in a contained manner that is very effective. Castiel knows a lot about torture, but these two are experts. They laugh, taunt, try to break him down. He is isolated, shivering with shock and very much alone by the time he realises they are going to push him to far. They are enjoying this far to much and will probably kill him accidentally. They don’t understand what it is to be human. They ask the same questions over and over, as if they can trick him into changing his answers.
“I suppose there’s one way to find out if it will work…” Lia concurs. She is so beautiful. Cas violently hates her, hates them both. He has to hope that they are the exception, that the other angels aren’t like these two deep down. They are sadists. They enjoy his pain. “He’s clearly no use to us alive anyway.”
He opens and closes his mouth, feeling an unsettling mix of slightly winded and ridiculously aroused. The ground is cold down his back, a contrast to the startling heat of Dean’s body. He tries to press closer, wriggling slightly. “That’s unfair.”
“Now I’m not one for pep talks mostly because they suck.” Dean cuts over him. “But you were tricked Cas. Tricked. You had something forcibly ripped from you by the ultimate douche with a stupid Transformer name. And you
He breaks away from Castiel’s iron grip, new strength kicking in, and kisses him again. Hard. He pulls him in by the waist, fingers sliding on skin, allows Cas to feel the whole length of him. The angel shivers against him. Cas mouth is heavy like a storm. He’s not kissing back. It only takes him a moment to push Dean firmly away again so he’s staggering once more. The rejection is brutal and clear enough.
He misses the sight of it. It is uniquely Dean, so full of contradictions. Light and darkness, strong and fragile, beautiful and fierce. Filled with love and passion with the shadows of self-loathing.  That is what he saw at a first glance in Perdition. No wonder he fell.
“That bad?” Dean withdraws his finger in a panic when Castiel gasps, much to his frustration. He could shout in irritation.
“Please don’t cry! No chick flick moments.” Dean suddenly says, eyes wide and filled with panic. He flaps his arms in an alarmed manner that almost makes Castiel want to laugh.
“And I want to do it again.” He adds recklessly, trying to sound confident but feeling his cheeks heat up.
Dean was a warm line pressed tight against his back. He felt Dean’s lips bounce gently over his shoulder, lingering kisses that made him shiver in a good way. Dean’s tongue lightly traced the unmarred flesh as his hand smoothed round to stroke the soft, lightly scarred skin of his stomach.
“Doesn’t look that deep.” Dean remarks and Castiel watches the shapes his lips make to form the words.
“You. Me.” He flaps his arms around. “With the whole ‘diving for my tonsils like it was going out of fashion’ thing.” Dean blurts out, voice much higher than usual.
“Stuff?” He echoes, uncomprehending. He sees a light flush rising behind Dean’s ears and is fascinated.
“I’m sorry Cas, I’m so sorry. You’ll be okay, you’re gonna be fine,” He tries to pull Cas to his feet, but Castiel’s legs won’t cooperate. He falls into Dean’s arms helplessly. The younger Winchester scoops him up, draws him close so he’s half sat on him. Sam hovers nearby.
only a few human months old.” Dean suddenly grins like it greatly pleases him to be more mature than an ancient being. Cas shakes his head, feeling his lips pull into a small smile, marvelling over how Dean can often make him feel better. He doesn’t deserve such kindness.
“Forget it,” Cas muttered straight away, rolling off Dean to lie by his side, his usual defensive position. Dean held on to his arm before he could roll to turn away.
Castiel freezes entirely, torn between wantonly baring his throat and fighting against the gesture of submission. Dean experimentally nips at his throat, biting at a tendon before messily licking a stripe against the damp flesh. Castiel grunts as Dean suddenly sucks hard, causing his vision to blur at he teases the sensitive skin with his tongue. His breath comes faster. He feels a surge of panic and he doesn’t know why. This is Dean. He loves Dean. Loves the things he does to him…
Dean goes very still at that before scrubbing a hand over his eyes. He crosses his legs for some reason. “Okay. Right, but just don’t go getting offended by this. I can literally feel myself growing a vagina just by mentioning it – but I don’t want to take advantage of you. I’m not going to be that guy.”
He doesn’t know what to do now. Can they just carry on where they left off? The wild wave of arousal has died down a little but just looking at Dean makes him want to try out a whole host of new ideas. He wants to be the one doing the pressing down. He wants to find that friction again, to be the one who-
He feels the stickiness of his release being wiped away from his stomach and has to admit it’s a definite improvement. His eyes slip shut while Dean tidies himself up (Cas assumes). He stretches out, lean body aching pleasantly. The good side to being human. His arms miss Dean’s warmth. And he clenches, realising there’s other parts of him that miss certain parts of Dean too. He feels slightly empty.
Afterwards, Dean loomed over Cas, kisses him quickly. It is desperate and hard. He gathered Castiel up in his arms possessively.
“What if he sells his soul for me again? I can’t let him go to hell again, I won’t.” Sam had sworn for the hundredth time, fever making him ramble repeatedly.
old fashioned. Seriously, he holds open doors for strange women and blushes when sex gets mentioned on cases.”
Castiel hums non-committedly and sits up once more, hands regretfully leaving the globes of that wonderful ass.  They continue to slide up and down his back, restlessly, meaning to soothe, not excite.
Blood beats faster in his head as he leans forward, breathes in deeply. His heart pumps adrenaline through his once stolen body. He spreads his arms out wide. It almost feels like flying again. He can almost imagine his wings unfurling in holy splendour, air rippling through them. All gone. One small step and he’d fall into the abyss. Wouldn’t be able to soar. He can almost feel the false sense of exhilaration.
His slid his own hand to join in, to grip Dean’s length, press their cocks so they could gently rock together. He slid his hand over Dean’s so they could slip over both their lengths, find their pleasure together. It was a slow, gentle, controlled, simmering heat. This position did not require any exertion, he was relaxed, at ease, desperate for more.
“Do you really want me to stop?” Dean’s question cuts through his spinning thoughts. His voice is low, stare direct and earnest as if he can read every dirty little thought that just went through Castiel’s mind.
His response makes a flicker of a devilish smile appear across Dean’s features. Castiel feels his stolen heart beat faster, now feeling connected to it. Effected by it.
Because he knows how he tastes now. He can remember how Dean’s body had surged against his. He can still hear the greedy moan that had sounded nothing at all like revulsion. And he doesn’t understand any of it. Doesn’t understand why Dean is acting cold, like they didn’t burn together little under an hour ago. Like that kiss didn’t leave them both hot and shaking.
He has to do all the stupid little things that never even required much thought before. Tasks such as showering. Personal hygiene is important. Dean had practically manhandled him into the bunker bathroom one day after weeks of sulking. Now he was a real boy, Castiel could smell like a real boy. This was not a good thing apparently. Even Sam had started to maintain a wary distance and Dean had made the occasional teasing remark.
Their eyes lock. Dean’s jaw clenches as he moves a little closer and Cas is trapped in his intensity. His mind is racing now and Dean cuts him off effectively with a simple gesture. A sweep of an index finger across his unharmed eyebrow, gently tracing the arch. “Don’t be an idiot Cas. We’ll always need you.”
“I am a man now Dean,” He says slowly, as though talking to a simpleton. “There’s no way to work around that, I’m afraid.” He adds sarcastically, just as the waitress comes by to clear their empty plates.
Dean can only gape as Castiel leaves the room. He strongly suspects Cas would loved to have zapped out of the room, a snappy exit, it he still had his wings.
He’s becoming more reckless too, craving the adrenaline. He chases the monster alone, drives Baby a little faster, starts bar fights just because he can. Is it thrill-seeking or has the blade just made him plain stupid? Sometimes it’s hard to tell.
“Pie?” He repeats uncertainly, just in case it’s slang for something filthy. Deep down, he knows it isn’t. Dean’s love of pie knows no bounds. He feels a flurry of disappointment.
He hated being a burden on the brothers. True, he was using their money, the small cadge they’d leant him not so long ago. He thought he’d do them a favour and knew what they liked. Things were too tense in the bunker these days. Sam kept making ‘third wheel’ jokes though Cas had no idea what that meant. He’d always thought a third wheel was a good thing. Either way, Dean didn’t touch him whilst Sam was around. Too self conscious, Cas supposed.
Castiel feels his eyes widen at that but Dean doesn’t notice, keeps his eyes firmly on the task at hand. Cas feels like an infant, helpless and trusting in this human’s hands. He feels the warmth where Dean’s finger and thumb hold him steady. He relishes the gentle touch. They haven’t been close like this for so long. He can count the dusky freckles across Dean’s face if he wished. Name the shades of colour in Dean’s eyes.
“That’s the stuff.” Dean nods approvingly, eyes crinkling with affection. It’s getting better. Dean may not ever fully trust him again but it is getting better. He found him on the rooftop. Tracked him using the GPS in his phone and brought him home. Castiel smiles back warmly, before taking another sip. It burns all the way down, igniting the existing warmth he feels for his friend. That’s better. Hurts less already.
Dean sighs into his skin. “Can you be an angel again? I liked it better when you were immortal. And safe.” Dean mumbles into the warmth of Cas’ throat, the only part not bandaged. He just stays there and breathes unsteadily.
ironic? There’s no way Sam didn’t hear that if he’s home yet Dean can’t seem to care. He lies back on the floor, revelling in the few seconds where the desperate all-consuming need has faded. He stretches, sighs, sated. He stays spread out, a mess on the floor, shivering with the aftershocks, feeling hazy. When he finally summons up the courage to peek at Cas, he sees the angel is still straddling him, eyes wide, innocent (how? How can he still think that?) with a hint of satisfaction, as if he had just had
Her certainty verges on devout and Castiel realises his chances of escape have just lowered significantly. She thinks that what they are doing is right, is just. How can he argue with such determined logic?
Sam is like a brother to him. He doesn’t want to upset the youngest Winchester. He needs to know they are okay. But right now, it’s so hard to care. If Sam has any qualms with this, Castiel would quite gladly tell him to go to hell. And he knows that’s ridiculous - and insensitive considering the circumstances - but there is something about Dean that makes him selfish. He wants to be greedy. He wants
“You can’t trust Metatron.” He repeated, placing his hands on Dean’s shoulders for emphasis and comfort. “You don’t know what he’d do to Cas. And I don’t wanna find out. Do you?”
“I want him safe.” Dean answers, unfazed. He has never felt more sure about anything in his life. He won’t lose Cas again. Last time was too damn close.
He’s still grinding against Dean’s hip, chasing both sensations accidentally with the rhythm his body automatically sets. When Dean quirks his finger just so, Castiel is left gasping. One hand twists in the sheets, the other is squeezing Dean’s bicep, marking him, pressing the faded mark made so many years ago in another place. Righteous man and Heaven’s little soldier, now they are this. Two men, writhing against each other, clinging to life, to the reassuring heat of their own bodies.
And it’s one hell of a reaction. Not one he’s remotely ready for. The angel peels Dean’s underwear away slowly, spreads his legs open with cool, firm hands. Even the shock of cold air on his dick feels good right now. But before he can revel in it, before he can barely register the way he’s free, upright, ridiculously hard, the enveloping heat of Cas’ mouth takes him all the way in.
He was satisfied and surprised to have taken such pleasure in enjoying a mundane, human task. He was fitting in, something he had never done his whole existence, not really. Even as an angel, he cared too much to have ever fitted in. He was getting better at being human. And then there was Dean. He had always fit so well with Dean - abrasively at times, but a perfect mess nonetheless. They made sense. Always through it all, Dean had made sense to him.
The eldest Winchester responds by rolling his eyes and leaning back on his haunches. He pulls his arms from Cas’ grasp so he can cross them, looking unimpressed. “Well, that’s a moment killer.”
“Almost…Ah…There! All done.” Dean gives his shoulder a quick squeeze after mercifully letting go of the wound. It feels weird - tightly compressed, encouraging the edges to knit back together again. He will have to remember not to move his eyebrows much, no matter how exasperated (or surprised, or shocked, or
“No you don’t.” Cas counters, breathing heavy. His eyes are sad but his tone is firm. “It’s that isn’t it?” He nods at Dean’s arm, eyes focused on the Mark of Cain with sad resolve. “Sam says it’s changing you, making you do things you would never do.”
Dean’s moving fast now, hips hypnotically smooth but thrusting in harder, until they are both moaning at how much it feels. He curves into Castiel’s body, kissing his chest, mouthing at a nipple. Castiel is nearly sobbing now, the pleasure is so bright, yet he’s still achingly, wonderfully full. He slips a hand between them, skims his fingertips over the place where they are joined, skin stretched, senstitive and damp. Dean nearly loses it when he notices this.
Castiel rakes his nails down Dean’s back as they jolt together, pulling him closer. Heat pools in his stomach, his balls feel tight, cock unbearably hard as he finds friction against Dean’s body, free foot flat against the bed, pushing up. The pleasure builds and builds as he gets more desperate, pushing up against Dean, using his body. They break apart every now and then to find the perfect angle, to readjust and avoid oversensitivity.
Dean swoops down, kisses him hard, rubs against him. It’s a dirty kiss, one shared between lovers only, carnal and intent with want. His hands shift so that he can grip Castiel’s thighs, wrap them around his warm waist.
They don’t talk about that night. They don’t mention it to Sam. Even if Sam wasn’t too pissed at what Dean might have done to save him.
He considers Dean’s words. He wants to be their family but has a habit of killing family. He wants to warn them. Tell the Winchesters to run away. But he’s not strong enough. He’s selfish. He needs them. Sometimes he needs Dean so much it’s a physical ache since he fell.
Dean knew it would one day come back to bite him in the ass. But Metatron had asked nothing of him so far.
like this. Nothing compared to this. There’s lights behind his eyelids. He’s struggling to breathe and thinks he may possibly be having a heart attack. Or at least, Dean must be able to hear his heart thumping.  He moans wantonly, not caring who might hear.
Castiel loved having sex with Dean. He was willing to keep trying. It would just take time to get back to how things had been. They both needed the closeness, to connect and cling to each other. Dean was definitely enjoying himself more than Cas was these days. But Castiel thought, if he could heal with anyone, it would be with Dean.
“Ew. Gross.” Dean sits back on his haunches, looking scandalised. “You don’t bring up a guy’s brother. Not after what we just did. Or almost did.” He grins slyly.
“Yes, I like the idea, very much so. As long as you are sincere.” He gasped out. Dean shifted slightly, pulled his hand away so he could lick it, move more smoothly against the heat of Castiel. “Oh God!”
It’s too much. Too much for both men as the bed frame rocks and creaks beneath them, flesh slapping together, panting filling the air as they exchange breaths. The double pressure inside and his hand sliding against his slick cock is too much, he cries out against Dean’s neck, let’s go to escape the feeling of too much. Castiel goes hurtling over the edge, mind blanking out. He’s seeing stars as waves of pleasure flood through him, hot and wild. It’s intense and goes on forever, coating their stomachs, shaking in ecstasy. As he comes, this time Castiel does the biting. He sinks his teeth into the long juncture of neck and shoulder, sucks hard to stifle the sounds of his release to stop himself screaming.
They ask impossible questions, one’s he can’t answer. He suspects they know he can’t answer, they must be able to see inside his mind. Maybe they just want to hurt him. Biker - no Matthias, Lia had called him as she cheered him on - carved his chest up with shallow cuts, sliding, stinging stripes of pain. Just shallow enough to keep him conscious, to maim not kill. He’ll have scars if he can survive this, they are marring Jimmy’s, no his, perfect skin. He’s so woozy. He's forgetting who he is as his blood drips against concrete. He voice is so raw, he can no longer cry out. There is no point anyway. For what seems like a very long time, he is alone with nothing but his pain for company. These creatures don’t count. They thrive on his suffering.
And he does. A little achy and tired perhaps. But he’s glowing inside once more. As they trade lazy kisses, he feels like he’s floating. He’s warm, sated, sleepy and for the first time in a long while, content. Used in the best way possible. He knows he doesn’t deserve this. He knows this calm cannot last forever. But he’s going to hold on to this, hold on to Dean for as long as he can. It is bliss. And he thinks he made Dean happy too. Dean deserves all the happiness he can get.
“Only the past week.” He admits reluctantly. “And are we really talking about this? Shall I set the aromatherapy up or do you want to skip straight to the gossip and pillow fight?”
“You are most wise,” he murmurs as Dean moves in closer, laughing a little at Cas‘ words. He gingerly removes the cloth from the wound.
Sam will understand – he hopes. He is however, unsure of how Dean will react. A part of him feels like Dean hasn’t really processed the changes in their relationship. Now he has to.
“What Cas?” He asks softly, cupping his cheek, leaning closer. Cas slides nearer in response. “What?”
“I know that.” Dean says on the verge of exasperation. “But she found you – confused, alone, memory-less. A blank slate. And she fashioned her own little house-husband out of you. That was… that was just wrong Cas. It wasn't you.”
He tilts his head in confusion (the man gave him the bloody thing) as Dean avoids eye contact. “What do you mean?”
He has to eat and drink. He sleeps when the dreams don’t get him. He has to use the bathroom for more than just keeping clean. He shaves. He has to wash his clothes, buy new ones since one suit was no longer good enough. He keeps the trench coat - a piece of his past he cannot bear to part with. Not after Dean had kept it so long for him, like it meant something. Like it was a symbol of the old Cas, the good Cas who was powerful and always tried to do the right thing. And often failed.
Then Cas is kissing him, softly lips moving, pouring a sweetness into every caress. He gently tastes Dean, cupping his jaw with sure fingers. Dean melts against him until he feels Cas’ hand over the mark. Cain’s mark. Cas steps back neatly.
“I thought it was hard to keep tabs on you when you still had your wings.” Dean sighs sadly, pacing the narrow balcony in exasperation. The words are thrown so casually but every one hits Castiel like a punch. He actually gasps in pain, making Dean look up anxiously.
“I’m quiet because I’m in shock.” Sam states, looking up calmly. “I did just basically see my brother going at it on the training room floor with my ‘honorary’ brother.”
Dean kisses him roughly to cut him off. But Cas breaks away and continues: “I’ll be here to help you through this. I’ll stay with you.”
“No, not just trying. You are going to make this right. You fucked up big time Cas. But we will fix this together because that is what we do. It’s what you have to do.”
A pained sigh comes from Sam. “All right. But the same goes for you Cas. You’re not invulnerable anymore. Just take it easy okay?” From anyone else, that would sting. Sam just genuinely sounds concerned.
Very briefly, Dean palmed his cheek - overly careful, as if that touch would set Castiel off. It hurt Cas’ heart to see Dean being so scared to touch him.
“Dean!” It only makes him smile more, the way Cas is gasping, squirming, almost as impatient as he has been. Almost as frustrated. But he’s enjoying exploring Cas’ body, very much so. The salt taste of him, the rhythm their bodies make, rubbing hips together ceaselessly. He moves to the other nipple, scrapes his teeth along it, makes Cas writhe, buck up, pant. The friction against his aching cock is too much. He presses his cheek against Cas’ slightly damp chest, moans.
This is spiralling out of control and he is glad. Dean makes him feel like he can fly again. Cas had only meant to clear the air, not to seduce him into this state. Dean just seems to really have a thing for dominance.
“Of what we can do together.” Dean’s voice goes very low and eager. It does things to Castiel’s internal temperature. Suddenly the whole diner burns away until it’s just them.
It was so cold in the warehouse. Perhaps the place just seemed to radiate misery, associated with painful memories after all. The scribe was certainly taking his time - could angels even do that? Choose when to show up, which summons to obey?  Castiel certainly had on occasion. When he’d been betraying them - not thinking about that, Dean firmly pushed the thought away. Crowley had always been selective about turning up on time, every now and then too.
“Cas!” Shocked again. Green eyes so wide, unable to look away. He licks his lips and Castiel leans in a fraction closer, eyeing the movement.
Castiel remembers reading that head wounds bleed a lot even if they are small. That should be comforting. The shock of pain in his head is startling, surreal. He feels the searing intensity of it and begins to panic a little but not for his own welfare.
“What Cas?” Dean moves to the edge of the bed now. So they are no longer touching. He shakes his head sadly. “I thought you wanted… never mind. My mistake. I guess I should…”
“Nothing. It’s just…” He hesitates, laughter eventually drying up, “That was just so damn good. It was so ridiculously good Cas. I can’t even describe…” He trails off, before placing a kiss on Castiel’s neck causing him to relax instantly. Dean enjoyed it. Dean really enjoyed it. He feels a smile spread across his face. This is
Sam thinks the blade may have pushed primal responses to the surface. He may be right. For one thing, he’s always hungry. Not just a Dean Level of Hungry either. He ate everything in the bunker. Sam said he was worried Dean would eat the bunker. And he’s growing. His muscle mass is increasing steadily though he does very little exercise. It’s as though his body is preparing for something. When Sam looks at him, it is with a mixture of fear and concern. He doesn’t know which disturbs him more, but he can’t bear it.
“What are you doing Dean?” Sam’s voice, calling over from the table, makes them both realise they are not alone. He sounds concerned and Castiel thinks they must look like they’re arguing, both so tense.
“Okay…” Dean sighs shakily, bravado fading a little as they both anticipate the task at hand. “No more dirty talk right? Unless you want to finish me off right this second.”
So Dean enjoys dirty talk? Castiel is no expert on the matter. He’s seen snippets of porn. And yes, he‘s seen things in the minds of men, in Dean’s head so long ago when he had no real use for them. No context to slot them into and interpret neatly. Now he knows. Now he understands. It’s about stating your desires. About seduction. He wants to seduce Dean with honesty, with this new passion.
“Well…okay.” Dean says, a little uncomfortably though his eyes were brightening up, like sunshine on a cloudy day.
Then there were the bruises, and the scars, that he suspected were never going to completely heal.  At least the worst bruises across his face had faded. It had been hard to recognise himself in the mirror for a while. The brothers had had to help him move around, to walk him to the bathroom for those first painful days out of hospital. He privately thought it had been like a preview of old age. The idea had not been comforting.
Because the truth is, deep down, he always thinks people never need him as much as he needs them. That is why he feels he would be incapable of hurting Castiel. Everyone leaves him in the end.
Dean made him feel all the way though his body, then and now. It was real, visceral and everything he’s ever accidentally wanted. Dean feels like home. Makes him crazy, makes him feel like he’d do anything - absolutely anything - to get to kiss him again. And that scares him.
The kitchen was bare. That was unacceptable. The brothers had never really had a home or a kitchen to stock before. They’d often run out of the necessities. But Castiel no longer wanted them to go without. He wanted to help and chip in, especially since he was partly responsible for the rapid depletion of food every week. And so with an uncomfortably empty fridge, clutching a wide ranging list, he went out to do the grocery shopping. How hard could it be? The brothers supposedly did it every week. When there wasn’t an apocalypse.
“I will.” Cas murmurs as Sam limps away, presumably towards his bedroom. The slow, measured steps he takes have Castiel worrying all over again. He cannot imagine what it must do to Dean.
“What’s wrong?” He mumbles, once he’s managed to extract himself from Dean’s embrace a little, resting forehead to forehead.
Castiel has to kiss him then, he looks so concerned, so sincere. His words have left him harder than he’s ever been in his short, mortal life. When he pulls back for air, he smiles. “Wasn’t what I was going to ask. I meant do you have the ‘supplies’ this time?” He pulls his hands away from the firm curves of Dean’s enticing body to make the little air quotes. He thinks he deserves a medal of valour for showing such restraint.
The room is sterile, bright, white. He hears his heart race thanks to a strange machine he’s been hooked up to. For a moment he’d thought it was Naomi’s office. But no. He’s attached to a drip for dehydration and he suspects it also contains that wonderful invention, the killers of pain. Like the last time.
“That’s why I come here.” He clears his throat. The lump is still there and he’s having trouble keeping his voice steady.
Castiel internally repeats those words as Dean apologetically presses the edges of his cut back together and slowly sticks the bandage over the top. Cas winces in spite of himself.
Ones I love. He’ll process that later. The stupid heart monitor speeds up a little which he finds vaguely embarrassing. Stop that. Dean is hurting.
It’s the way Cas looks at him, wide-eyed, caring and innocent, despite being anything but. Cas is danger. Cas is
Sam was left with no choice after Dean had flatly refused to take him on the latest hunt.  He was even reluctant to take Castiel after the last disastrous salt and burn mission. The fallen angel frowns at the memory, causing a twinge of pain in his nearly healed laceration. Cas had threatened to cut the stuffing out of Dean’s beloved memory foam mattress if he was left behind too.
“You stay with me now Cas, don’t you dare go to sleep, you hear me?” He shakes Cas hard enough to make his teeth rattle. He has to fight a violent wave of nausea. “I am so mad at you right now, you dumbass. But that doesn’t matter. You’re here now. And you’re gonna be just fine alright?”
“What?” He asks softly, head tilted, trying to calm his friend down. They’re both breathing heavy. Cas can feel the heat coming from his friend. Can practically see his thoughts whirring, even if he can’t read them anymore.
“Well you can go down the whole naturist route if you like - I sure know I’d appreciate it – but I prefer the prison-free lifestyle myself.”
This isn’t him. It’s so wrong. Sam is here too. They both look at him with matching expressions of confusion. He has to leave the room, mumbles his excuses as he staggers away. Get to his bedroom - anywhere - away from his best friend.
He sweeps a thumb over his lower lip and sighs. Thinks back to his first kiss with Meg. He’d felt it back then. Or at least, he’d told himself he did. But just because his vessel had reacted didn’t mean he’d felt it all the way down, right to his very essence. He was going through the motions. An imitation of life.
“Don’t worry Cas.” He says, once sufficiently recovered, though still bright red. “There’s other things we can do.”
After returning from the Marty-Hunt, all thoughts of romance (or lust as Castiel can graciously admit) were immediately set aside after seeing Sam. He had not fared well during their absence. Light shakes had progressed to full body tremors. He was dizzy, weak, clutching his head as if trying to keep it together through the crippling pain, slumped over the dining table. Dean had rushed over, taken one hard look at him  - face grim, and ordered him back to bed.
“You really are a child aren’t you?” Dean asks sadly, winding his arm around Cas’ shoulders as he attempts to steer him away from the edge.
Dean was taking angry bites of his burger, not meeting his eyes. But he said he wasn’t jealous. Why should it matter if he’d slept with someone else? Dean wasn’t exactly as pure as driven snow! He contemplates saying this but realises that would probably make things worse. Punch-to-the-nose levels of worse.
“I’m sorry Dean. He probably won’t even be able to love you. He won’t be able to feel it, to even remember how-”
He’s trying to protect the man he loves by consorting with the creature that hurt him the most. The idea is laughable.
He rolled over to face Dean. “You are a health hazard, Dean Winchester.” He took one of those calloused hands, placed it on his own hardness.”You see what you’ve done?” It was the longest time he had been able to feel this way. His cock pulsed at Dean’s touch and he welcomed the sensation.
This causes Dean to moan loudly, choked off as he grinds his hips back down twice as hard, an automatic response. And he is hard. Castiel can feel every inch and it has him sweating with want and alarm at how fast this is going. He shudders a gasp and Dean only pushes harder.
“At least let me drive you somewhere! We’re practically in the middle of nowhere.” Dean insists, ignoring his brother’s question.
“You don’t just dump something like that on a guy,”  He laughs a little hysterically, voice rough, eyes on Castiel’s mouth.
Cas glanced up at that, to see Dean waggling his eyebrows like a fiend, trying to act normal. Cas’ mouth went dry at the sudden flurry of images that conjured.
care about the sex stuff a bit. But only because you’re so fucking hot and I want you so damn much.” Dean blurted out. “You’re
“What happened…Back there. Umm...” He clears his throat noisily and Castiel nearly smiles at the way he is acting. It’s almost adorable in its awkwardness. Reminding him irresistibly of how he must have looked in that disastrous trip to the brothel all those years ago. Even the millennia old former angel is handling this better. He thinks Dean may even be blushing. He finally takes a hand off the wheel and rubs the back of his neck uncomfortably, firmly avoiding eye contact.
Sam empathises. Made all the right sounds of condolence, the reassurances of time being a great healer. He emphasises that at least Cas has Dean, they have each other. They’ll be fine. All the while he wonders.
“I know.” Cas says softly, voice no different than it ever was. Before Dean can protest or sigh with relief that he seems to understand all that - did Cas read his mind? – he swoops down, carefully angled to not press down where Dean’s still sensitive - and kisses him deeply, tenderly. He can taste himself on Cas’ tongue and isn’t that a turn on? Apparently so if the excited twist in his stomach is anything to go by. He tries to push it down, enjoy the moment of pure relief, but he can already feel the shame setting in. The way he took Castiel…
Tonight the stars are falling, falling all around him. He tries to catch them but they slip through his fingers, fading into something insubstantial, disintegrating into stardust. He weeps for their loss, screams out into the cold, dark abyss of the sky to no avail. He wakes up in a sweat, tears streaming down his cheeks.
“Are you still…?” His voice trails off going all high pitched at the end as if Cas should know what he means.
Dean looks so hopeful, his smile so bright, that Castiel cannot possibly protest. What he really thought they needed was more sex after sex but never mind. He is an ancient being.  He can and will control himself.
“Throw that down and you’ll never see me again.” Metatron sneers, hands in pockets, trying to look apologetic as he steps out of the circle of holy oil.
He bites down harder than he means to, but softens it by sucking on the skin, soothing with his tongue. Castiel grunts, gasps out his name reproachfully. He couldn’t help it. Wanted to stop him, mark him which is ridiculous. Castiel cannot be bruised. He pulls back, suddenly horrified, to no longer be in control…
He hadn’t wanted to trade for money or any of the rare and weird items in the Impala. Had only wanted one thing. A favour in return.
“I need you.” He growls out, angrier than he intended. Why is he always the one who has to say it? Why can’t Cas ever just
A blow to the right this time that nearly knocks him unconscious from her impossible strength. The chair would have tipped over if the male angel hadn’t started forward to catch him. His face throbs and there’s blood on his lips. He can feel his face swelling by each passing second. The pain is so strong, but he is unused to it, every time, it takes him by surprise. He does not know how Sam and Dean can stand it, in every fight against every supernatural threat they have faced.
What he doesn’t expect is for Dean to close his eyes, exhale raggedly as he rests forehead to forehead and say: “God, yes.”
Cas is crouched atop his legs, something curious, almost mischievous in his expression. Dean doesn’t know whether to kiss or punch him. “Cas!” He barks, nearly yelps when the hand shifts minutely.
“I’m fine,” Castiel protests even though he sounds wretched to his own ears. “But I do happen to agree with Dean. You need time to recuperate. I’ll be fine.”
Weeks go by. Weeks of not touching, of carefully sitting a respectable distance apart. Of tactfully not looking when getting changed in motel rooms. Of sensibly keeping Sam between them. Of trying not to stare too hard (at least on Dean’s part. Castiel had always been a starer and nothing will change that).
“Heaven, I think.” Castiel barely recognises his own voice, his face is so swollen, voice breathless, lip split.
“I feel so much. So much all the time. I don’t know how you stand it.” He clenches his fists, glances up at the sky. Pin points of stars glare down at him through the clouds as dusk approaches.
“Huh. Guess not.” He can hear the teasing smile in Dean’s voice and tries to contain a grin, unsuccessfully. He feels too happy, content, weightless. He’s never felt this relaxed before. Such a contrast to his first weeks as a human. The loneliness, hunger, guilt and horror… He sighs and skims his hand down Dean’s back, relishing the sigh the action elicits, getting lost in the motion.
“You don’t want to do this,” Castiel says clearly, trying not to shiver from how cold it had become. There was an electric charge in the air, like the calm before a lightning storm. A sense of something building. Something unpleasant, bitter and violent waiting to be unleashed.
There’s a long pause as Castiel processes his words. He understands where he’s coming from. But Dean doesn’t know the whole truth does he? And he can’t exactly tell him. He can’t tell him he’s always felt this way about him, even before the fall. He can’t let him know that this is what he’s always wanted, because he loves him, deeply. Because he’s the only thing that keeps him together sometimes, keeps him sane.
The ache in Cas’ leg and shoulder reassure him he hasn’t lost his mind. As does the way Dean looks at him now. The way he doesn’t shift his leg away when they meet under the table.
Gradually, Castiel was able to relax, to gently fall into that comforting space just before you fall into a deep sleep. Dean’s slightly rough hands gently smoothed the scarred skin of his stomach once more, slow and tentatively a first. Eventually, Cas was able to relax, to not flinch. It was soothing. And he was so sleepy, he couldn’t find it in himself to care too much about Dean feeling his scars.
He feels like he’s on the edge of something good, pressed tightly under the heat of Dean’s body, pushing down encouragingly. Dean knows how this works. Castiel doesn’t know how, or when he found out, and he doesn’t mind. There’s one finger inside him, breaching him, stretching him bit by bit. It glides slickly, if not uncertainly. In and out, so careful and smooth. The slow build of friction is driving him mad.
” It slips out so easily, same as before, though weary and defeated this time. Loving Cas will always be his curse, something he knows he cannot change. Even when it hurts. Which it does most of the time if he’s honest. He knows he will never admit this out loud. Loving someone makes you vulnerable, exposed. Want is far simpler.
And that is how the last of Dean Winchester’s resolve shatters. He withdraws his fingers, and Castiel clenches and deeply feels the loss. Dean quickly cleans his hands using wipes on his bedside table (Castiel doesn’t ask), pulls back so they are face-to-face and Castiel is pleased to see he looks as if he’s been smacked in the face by his confessions.
Dean can’t let him leave. Won’t. “Well, maybe it is the mark talking. Maybe it is making me braver, stupider, a little more honest. Thank God it’s good for something.” His voice catches then, causing Cas to meet his eyes. “I’m scared Cas,” he admits. “I’m so God-dammed scared of how it’s changing me.”
“Just Castiel.” He corrects teasingly, swooping down to claim another light kiss before pulling back. He is gratified when Dean tries to follow.
Dean pulls away at that, looking sheepish. “I’m sorry. Inappropriate.” He waves his hands vaguely, looking nervous. “I’m just not good with… feelings. Not exactly new news to you though is it?”
“How couldn’t I Sammy? They early killed him!” He exploded. Dean took a few deep breaths, continued, “As far as I see it, he’ll always have a this huge target on his back, long as he’s human and vulnerable. And his douchebag ‘family’ are still walking around down here.” He grimaced.
And simply because Castiel wants the sunshine back, he lifts his head and closes the gap between their mouths, tries to kiss the sadness away. Their lips move almost gracefully, sliding against each other. Dean’s mouth opens instinctively. His hand moves to cradle the back of Castiel’s head as they press closer. It’s gentle, yet searing. The room no longer feels so cold anymore.
“For God’s sake keep your voice down!” Dean mutters through the smile that becomes more and more strained as the waitress scampers off looking scandalised.  “You wanna get carted off to the loony bin?”
Dean takes a deep breath, determinedly moving away from the subject of his brother. “I need your help.”
He forces himself to stop there because that’s too close to the truth; to another truth that Dean isn’t ready to hear yet.
As short, unkempt and weasel-grinned as the first time they’d met, when he’d been in hiding, the scribe steps out of the shadows, dramatically enough to make Dean roll his eyes. “How long you been there?”
Dean is muttering gibberish now. Mostly repeating Castiel’s name and swearing, whispering filth into his ear which makes Castiel even harder. But there are words that are perfect, words filled with sweetness and awe.
“Ssshh…” Dean soothes against the damp skin, making him shiver. Cas grinds up against him as he pulls his face closer kissing him desperately, messily.
Sam had never quite grasped just how much Dean loved Castiel until that moment. He’d always known about Dean’s feelings for the former angel, even before Dean could admit them to himself. But Dean had looked like he had almost lost a part of himself on that day. That had shaken Sam, had made him understand fully, just what they meant to each other.
. Dean could practically cry at the promise of such sweet relief. He doesn’t know what he did to deserve this. It feels so good even though it shouldn’t be. He’s dragged Cas down to his level, never meant to. Caught in lust and the mark and his messed up world. He
Something darkens in Dean’s gaze and it has Castiel’s stomach fluttering in anticipation. Dean withdraws his hand, sits up between Castiel’s thighs, grabs the tin of gun oil and adds a liberal amount to his hand, eyes never leaving Castiel’s as he does so. He rubs his fingers slowly, warming the oil before resettling between Castiel’s legs.
“I did all that, because it was you. I love you.” Dean could no longer meet his eyes now, though he was practically shouting. “You think I only care about the physical stuff? Looks and the sex and all that junk?”
This was how he’d made so many others suffer the same fate as him. How painful and utterly terrifying for his bewildered victims, Cas had thought in horror.
They’re closer now. Castiel can feel his warmth. Can see the thick hairs on his head move in the steady wind stream. Can pick up the green and golden flecks in his eyes. But he can no longer see what’s
“Cas?” His eyes meet Sam’s who is now leaning against the wall, looking pale himself. “I don’t know, maybe we should take him to the hospital…”
As if reading his mind, Dean loosened his grip, ceased rocking into him. Castiel regretted their loss already but could not deny there was also some relief in there too.
His name sounds like a filthy prayer and something in him snaps. He wantonly grinds against Dean then, aiming to make every thrust flawless. They writhe against each other, eye contact only breaking when they close in pleasure. They roll together, fitting perfectly. Castiel’s hand is in Dean’s sweaty hair, the other grips his arm fiercely, digging into muscle. His leg aches where Dean holds it tight at the perfect angle. They’re practically snarling now, pace quickening to a brutal speed, hurling towards the finish line. Nearly violent in its passionate, desperate race for completion. The only sounds are of them panting and the slap of slick flesh. It’s obscene.
Right now, he can hear sounds that he’s only heard in porn. And it’s coming from him. One hand anchors itself to Cas’ thick hair, the other he uses to muffle his moans.
“I don’t have any condoms,” Dean confesses in a rush, eyes screwed up tight as if anticipating a lecture.
Castiel was straddling Dean. That way, he could feel in control. And it was working. It was really working. Dean was spread out beneath him like an offering, all golden skin, lightly panting and slick with sweat. But then Castiel’s ribs had started aching, that deep familiar burn. Then his legs had turned to jelly once more - nerves flaring and trembling painfully. And all those nerves in his wrists had stated jumping around like hot coals yet again, twisting and throbbing. He just wasn’t as physically strong as he once was, even with the physical therapy in the gym (hospital cost too much and Sam had researched the subject). It was helping him get stronger, but not fast enough.
“Smooth,” Dean answered, eyebrows raised as he handed Sam a napkin. “Do I need to go all Heimlich on you?”
Castiel chuffs laughter at that, can feel Dean’s smile curve against his skin. “Don’t make me laugh. Hurts too much.”
He grabs that face, smashes his lips against Castiel’s. It’s violent and Cas practically yelps under his kiss, but Dean captures that too, slides his tongue inside, plunders. It’s warm, wet messy and so perfect Dean could cry. He knows where he wants that mouth next and the state he’s in won’t make him shy about asking – no,
They trade slow, lazy kisses in the softly illuminated confines of the bunker. Dean’s hand gently cups Castiel’s jawline, fingertips scratching along stubble, drawing out each kiss for as long as possible. It is unhurried, peaceful and to Cas, completely perfect. Damp, heated, slow…
“Sssshh…” Cas soothes him, hands in his hair, resting their foreheads together. Castiel is panting too. “Put it all on me. I’m here for you. I’m yours.”
Dean drums his fingers against the table top almost nervously as they wait for their bacon cheeseburgers with extra fries. A few minutes of this tense silence has Castiel snapping at his friend in no time.
But Sam had fallen into another uneasy sleep, exhausted and broken through fits of agitation for his brother’s wellbeing. Castiel felt much the same way. He wished he could have stopped the eldest Winchester from leaving, but he knows nothing would have changed his mind. Sam is his baby brother. He would gladly, and has, died for him. Nothing would ever change that, even Castiel’s pleas. And that frightens him.
In fact it had been the work of forty-six year old, asthmatic Marty Groucher. The very lonely, much ignored, barely remembered and extremely pissed off ghost of an employee who had died of a heart attack himself late one Friday night after slaving to meet a deadline.  After some digging, on Dean’s part since Cas’ people skills were still kind of rusty (“DID YOU KILL MARTY GROUCHER?!”), they had uncovered that Marty’s body hadn’t been discovered in his office until later the following week. No one had missed him, no one had particularly liked him, and not even the cleaners had deigned to clear up his office for him. Until he’d started to smell that is.
“Like a child?” He nearly laughs and feels no bitterness. Did he not just compare himself to an infant earlier?
They stay sat like that for a moment, eyes locked, breathing deeply. Castiel feels so alive, so wild as he tries to calm down. He wants more. He wants everything all at once. He blames his newly found humanity for this. But probably Dean more.
When Dean eventually lets go, shuddering to a finish, Castiel’s shoulder is throbbing. Dean licks lazily at the indents as Cas tries to catch his breath. He runs his hands up and down Dean’s naked back. His hip aches and his mind is a puddle of pleasure. When Dean pulls back, they look at each other carefully, waiting for someone to break the silence, breathing heavy as the moment hangs suspended. Dean is still on top, arms either side of Castiel’s head on the pillow.
Before he can get those words out, Dean has flipped their positions and pinned Castiel back to the bed. He presses down so they lie flush against each other. He can feel every inch of Dean. Dean can feel every inch of him.
There’s a rush of saliva in his mouth at the images that conjures. He can feel the hard line of Dean where he wants just as badly. He wriggles slightly, savours the hot intake of breath against the side of his face.
“I want you.” Dean answers. He tries to sound seductive but knows his voice is filled with hurt. Desperation.
“This okay?” He says softly, going slow as he kisses the sensitive skin, making Castiel shiver. Dean is helping him get past the bad memories, he realises. He wants to let go, likes having Dean’s mouth there.
He feels a rush of excitement, of nervous anticipation, a hot surge of lust and longing that takes him by surprise. He swallows hard, breathing growing more wrecked. He needs to keep talking. To keep moving. He presses indents into Dean’s hips. This can’t end like last time, as wonderful as that was.
And it hurt. It’s always a surprise, how much it always hurts now. He hit the finely carpeted ground hard, landing awkwardly on his back. He heard Dean call out his name in alarm before it was cut off with a grunt of pain. This caused Cas to struggle to sit up, afraid for his friend. Only when he’d stopped seeing stars could he glance up and see the middle aged, furious Marty in all his glory, still finely suited wearing a twisted look of hatred. And there he had stood over Dean who had hit the solid wall, flickering in an unearthly manner.
Dean’s eyes blazed as he met Sam’s, expression sardonic. “Why would he want to be human?” Dean said ‘human’ as though it were a dirty word. Sam had to sigh. Dean’s opinion of himself, his ideas of self-worth, were still far too low for his liking.
All the fight drains out of him. Dean lowers the blade, looks away from Metatron. Staring at nothing yet trying to deny the plain truth of the matter. Keep Cas away, but possibly never be able to see him again. No. He can’t. He won’t.
“It’s fine,” Castiel brushes the request aside, pretending not to care. He feels like he’s close, so close to something. To having Dean again in the future, to claiming him, making him his even if he doesn’t know it.
Dean hesitates for a moment, mischievous smile slipping into something more thoughtful. A shadow passes over his face but his words are oddly composed. “He’s fine. He’s cool. Bit of a know-it-all actually, you know Sammy.”
The scribe shrugs, grins. “How is your brother doing Mr Winchester? Still suffering the effects of the trials?” Metatron aims for contrite and misses by a few miles. There’s an air of smugness to his words too. Dean’s fingers itch around the angel blade in one hand, and his lighter in the other.
He pauses his actions. He never wants to make Dean look like that again, never wants to hurt him. Dean’s eyes snap open and he snakes a hand up over Cas’ shoulders, winds fingers through his hair so he can pull him closer. He kisses him hotly on the lips before drawing away slightly.
“Do you…?” he hesitates and Dean pulls back a little so they are face-to-face, bodies pressed together.
“It’s never that simple is it?” Groused Dean, crowbarring open a filing cabinet that turned out to be empty. Cas shrugged in reply, keeping watch with a salt-rock loaded gun in case Marty decided to show up.  And a bag of the stuff in his pack. Just in case.
He opens and closes his mouth, lost for words. That is entirely unfair. For one thing, he had been talking to Sam. True, he had announced his intentions rather loudly, but not to address Dean in particular.
“Is your brother not well?” Metatron repeats, confusion passing over his features. “Because that spell was full-proof! If it didn’t work it’s because you morons did someth-
“Want you inside me,” He murmurs, it slips out, unbidden. It’s a like a line from the pizza man’s adventures, but it’s honest. Honesty is what they need.
“You really think he’s not getting any better?” Sam enquired, changing the subject a little. The idea of Castiel becoming an angel again had lead to another disturbing thought.
“You’ve really been thinking about this haven’t you?” Sam asked, feeling his stomach drop. How could they get Cas’ grace back? More deals with the devil, with Metatron? No. Never again. They couldn’t trust him.
“He’s with you now isn’t he?” He asks lightly, suggesting that’s worth all the trouble, so Dean can interpret it any way. He carefully keeps his face blank.
“It’s fine,” He says, yanking his arm free of Castiel‘s grip. “No it’s ok, don’t say anything. I’ll just go and find some unsuspecting woman for an unpleasant night of ridiculously frustrating sex yeah?” He’s only half serious, but now Cas looks angry, as angry as Dean feels. He grabs Dean’s arm again before he can get away. He thinks he’ll have a bruise from that grip.
He knows any further denial may cost him his life, but what else can he say? He senses they will kill him anyway. He focuses on the woman in front of him. The angel. She’s impossibly tall, with long rippling blond hair. She looks so fierce and powerful. He wishes he knew her name. He wishes his head would clear long enough so he would no longer see two of her. He needs to appeal to her better judgment, the one he has always hoped all angels have, on some level.
The scrape of the chair as Dean positions himself opposite makes him start a little. That was something he never did before. He now sympathises with Dean all those times he chose to materialise behind him unannounced. He understands why Dean always jumped and cursed at him.
“I really don’t see the point in this Dean.” Though admittedly, he’s enjoying the closeness this exercise provides an excuse for. Dean. Standing an arm’s length away. Looking all serious - or at least trying to. The corners of his mouth keep twitching though his eyes remain intent. The itch is back and he has to fight not to step right into Dean’s personal space. He is in control. He is not some over-sexed teenager, no matter how Dean may make him feel.
Everything is so much smoother for Dean then. Dean’s hand fits over Cas’, guided him with precision until he can find his own release. He grunted, almost animalistic. Cas doesn’t have to tell him not to bite.
“I want Cas’ grace back.” Dean blurts out, no hesitation, batting all other words of Metatron aisde. He’ll worry about that later. “Might as well put my cards on the table, I got nothing to offer you.”
He waits for Dean to look up before continuing. “My short time with Daphne has become a blur to me. We were…domestic. Intimate. But it wasn’t real. I didn’t feel it. It was as if something were missing. Some part of me. I wasn’t capable of love or sensation back then. Not really. Not like now.”
But what can you possibly say? Castiel wonders. They have changed each other forever. Changed their friendship into something else and there’s no going back. That was very animalistic and Cas enjoyed it immensely… but is that something people tell each other?
“Yes. It is.” He agrees quietly, broken smile spreading across his face like a dash of winter sunlight.
This whole situation is highly amusing to him. Dean goes through the concept of blocking, intending to help Castiel learn the key tactics self-defence. His warm hands position Cas’ arms into the best blocking positions, lingering a shade too long on bare skin. It’s quite sweet really, that he’s feeling so protective. Not at all annoying that he’s being underestimated again.
Castiel knew that to be true as well, though he found it hard to believe Dean could be so trusting, was willing to let Castiel do that to him. His heart swelled. Dean’s hand twisted, slipped his thumb over Cas’ slit so that a spike of pleasure shot through him. He moaned. A real, uncontrolled moan, the first in months.
Dean stood up, stared at his feet whilst he paced around the dining table. “No one could hurt him that easily ever again. And he’d heal. He’d heal properly Sammy.”
“You just have to be more careful Cas.” Dean’s voice cracks a little. It tugs powerfully at his memory. Castiel recalls a broken man, lying in a hospital bed, insisting destiny had chosen the wrong person. He wanted to protect that man. He wants to protect him now but all he ever brings him is more pain.
Dean is just as strong and sure with this as he is in everything he does. Castiel thinks that this is what they are meant to be. This is just. This is right.
“Stop. Just stop.” He gasps. He bucks Dean off so he’s left sprawled over Cas’ legs looking befuddled.
He shrugs, giving up the fight. He can feel Dean drawing away already. Does he already regret the closeness of before?
“I break the people that love me.” It’s so quiet that Castiel could choose to ignore it if he wished.
“Cas!” His eyes flash open, alight with pleasure, awe and amusement. “Stay still a minute or this will be over pretty damn f-fast!”
So…this is basically PWP. Well, you waited long enough! And yes, this relationship is becoming deliberately co-dependent. Let me know if you liked this chapter. My first full love scene. Anywaaaay...
“Come on then.” Dean orders, obviously still flustered as he runs a hand through his hair. “Don’t want to worry Sam.”
Deep down, he knows they’re better than this. They are more than this so he tries to slow it down. Breaks away to pull in air. Traces the solid curves of Dean’s shoulders, squeezing the muscles beneath soft cotton. He wishes he could see those beautiful eyes pooled in shadows, whether they are wide with awe or soft with desire. He can feel their intense focus.
“Come on then.” He urges once they’ve pulled apart and Dean sighs in relief, begins to push in faster. They both groan when he’s fully sheathed again. That hit something wonderful.
“Leave me.” Castiel tries to make it an order but it sounds like begging. He swallows a lump in his throat that he can’t explain the presence of. Everything in his body tightens when Dean is near, goes haywire. He can’t stand it and yet it makes him feel painfully alive. That’s the problem. Dean makes things even more complicated. He cannot carry Dean’s disappointment and feelings too.
He senses him, thinks he can actually smell Cas. That’s all manner of disturbing but it just might be true. He enters the small training room so quietly, yet Dean is aware of his presence immediately. Not that Cas smells, but it’s unmistakable. A tang of warm sunlight on skin, fresh electric air and salt. Unless the mark has fucked up his imagination too. The hairs on the back of his neck stand on end, his skin prickles.
It’s fun watching Dean try to be responsible and focused while he touches him like this. He watches him carefully. Adjusts his grip and rhythm every time Dean’s expression subtly shifts, or his hands clench, or whenever his hips buck forward encouragingly. He watches for when his eyes go wide. He wants to become reacquainted with his body, know it better than Dean does himself. He wants to play him like an instrument, coax those beautiful sounds out of him once more, and then create some new ones together.
Case in point: the changes in their relationship had been completely ignored and set aside. They sunk back into version of desperate normality in a way that is grating and frustrating to Castiel. The tension is worse now because it has been acknowledged. To try and pretend otherwise is just like wearing a mask over your real face all the time. Pointless and unnecessary.
“Yes you do. You know you do. He’ll explode. Bye-bye pretty-boy body, hello celestial wavelength of burn-your-eyes-out badness.” His words come more rapidly now through a twisted smile, clearly enjoying the effect he’s having on Dean. He tries not to lash out, to strike him or shake him, force him to admit it’s not true. “You okay with that?”
Embarking on a sexual relationship with Dean Winchester does not only feel good, it’s also proven to be very, very distracting.
He had a real sweet tooth for cookies and chocolate, despite Dean’s various warnings he would ‘get pudgy.’ Fruits were a favourite, juicy and fresh, sweet and ripe. He liked to eat with Dean. To savour his pleasure. He’d imagined introducing food into new situations with Dean… Scenarios that had made him weak at the knees. Eating was a sensual experience, sometimes a little messy, often enjoyable.
He’s seen the fall of ancient civilisations. Soared amongst the heavens, been worshipped throughout history. He has risen from the dead like Christ and Lazarus before him.  Has lived a thousand lifetimes, but never has he felt more complete, more at peace, than when he held Dean Winchester.
Dean frowns at that, briefly places one hand on his knee. Castiel has to struggle to stay still. “You’re just having growing pains.”
Dean’s smile is almost feral as he runs his hands down Castiel’s back, slipping in sweat so that he can cup his ass and squeeze.
“Nah.” Dean and Castiel agree on something at least. “He’s made of tougher stuff aint that right Cas?”
