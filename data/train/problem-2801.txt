Maybe that one was too easy. Or maybe you took too long to answer. Either way, situations like these tend to stick around like a bad penny. The bad news is the stakes are raised, now, and you’ve put everything on the line. Better think faster and smarter for this next one.
Dean gets pulled to start grilling burgers, since more people will start coming around soon, so Sam follows Cas to the food tables and is happily put to work when Theresa starts bossing them around and asking for help.
Dean confesses, but Cas does. It was his own hands that reconstructed Dean, but even without that advantage, Cas knows every facet of him more than he can comprehend. Dean gets angry because it’s easier than getting hurt. He gets so angry because if he didn’t, he’d only be left with the undeniable truth that everything he does is out of love. It’s not an easy thing to face; Cas understands that now more than ever.
What he does know is that death has one hell of a time keeping him down.
Cas has seen a fair amount of it; more so in the last decade than ever in the remainder of his long existence. Most of it from the Winchesters, though plenty from himself. Deal after deal made and fulfilled all in the name of saving one another. Cas thought he knew the feeling once he started to call them his family, but it had only been a taste of it. The enormity of it only truly strikes him when he’s given the opportunity to save Jack’s life.
“You know I never turn down your honey, Ronnie,” Cas tells him with a smile. Ronnie grins and taps his cane against the ground in delight. “How are your bees?’
She touches the edge of the photograph thoughtfully. Her eyes flicker back and forth between Sam and Dean in the picture, and she bites her lip. “I mean, it’s hard to say. Lotta people come and go, you know? We’re just a stop on a map. But. We have hot coffee, and Lorinda’s got a soft spot for people down on their luck, so she usually gives it out for free. If anyone is gonna recognize him, it’d be her.”
Dean works his jaw. There ain’t enough time left for this family to be able to talk the way they need to. It’s a shit truth and Dean’s known it since he was a kid. Always on the tail end of some Armageddon or even just some damn fight he thought he wasn’t walking away from. There’s nothing he can say to them right now that could even encompass half the shit he wants to say. It’s barely even a sliver, but still Dean says, “It’s not your fault, kid, okay? It’s okay.”
It happens so quickly that both of them spill a bit of root beer on themselves, and it’s a terrible first kiss because they’re both laughing into it. Cas takes both of the bottles and tosses them over the edge of the roof, and Dean laughs again. “Sammy’s gonna kill us for that.”
“You knew about it?” asks Dean, as though Sam hadn’t spoken at all.
Dean admits. At the base of his prayer there is growing reproach; Cas is grateful for it, if it means Dean is sincere.
somehow when i started this fic i didn't think it would be more than 20k. and now here we are, with the longest chaptered fic i've ever posted on this account, and with plans for the story to continue on even more.
Lisa just sighs.
today.
Someone restores him, down to every molecule, in a body that isn’t his but feels more like him than his true form does these days. Someone gives him a second chance at life—and later, though he doesn’t know it yet, he’ll get a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, and so on. He will become known as the hardest angel to kill and he will wear that title with both pride and shame.
“You said,” Jack interrupts. His voice is sharp in the way that only children’s voices get when they’re frightened. He swallows thickly. “You said that Castiel summoned the Empty. The only way he could do that is when… Did he—was he happy?”
“Dad?”
Castiel’s existence fills with fire and brimstone at the thought. Rage against these corrupt creatures for corrupting the Sword of Heaven. He tears through the remnants of Hell with a vicious fury, showing these demons even less mercy than they allow the souls they trap down here. Castiel’s certain that he’s going to find the Righteous Man mangled and scarred and ugly, as he’s been told all broken things are.
“Don’t step on that fish,” Dean warns, voice carried softly through the open space. Cas glances down. Next to his foot is a clay sculpture of a distorted-looking creature. Even with limited light, Cas can see that it’s painted colorfully and childishly. Jack’s name is on the gill, signing his art.
“You’d know better than me,” Dean points out.
Dean drives. He always drives, if it’s him and Cas in the Impala. Habit, probably. Or comfort. Either way, Cas doesn’t seem to mind. Dean’s only been to the high school once, so he relies on Cas directing them as they go.
Cas pinches him.
“This was a compromise,” Cas tells her. He rolls his eyes. “Apparently he was dissatisfied by the way I was gaining… I believe he called it a farmer’s tan.”
then he keeps driving through the town until he finds an auto repair shop with a hand-painted sign and a collection of old cars parked outside. The faded sign names the place Woody’s Auto Repair. The tires of the Impala kick up loose gravel as they drive up to the side of the building.
They don’t speak about it, on September 18th.
Dean won’t cry. He
“It’s not your fault,” Cas murmurs. He watches her, even when she looks away again and focuses instead on drinking her tea. He used to be able to heal people with a touch. But here’s no way to heal this, and it eats at him. “I’m sorry for yours.”
be my room?” Claire asks.
“That’s not true,” Cas argues, and Dean narrows his eyes. “This
Dean lifts his head to the sky instead of answering. He asked Cas, once, what it was like to see the creation of stars. If Cas knew then what he knew now, he might have told Dean that it felt the same as falling. It felt like rebirth.
Finally, it seems, Cas realizes what Dean’s implying. Cas’s eyes widen again, and he sits forward in his seat. “You have a house,” he repeats slowly, and this is fucking
“Guess neither of us were so lucky,” Dean mutters. In another lifetime, he might try harder to figure it out. To figure out what brought back Bobby, what healed Dean. But Dean’s lived a thousand lifetimes since then, and for now he’s just. Exhausted, deep in his bones. Grieving. If he even knows the definition of the word.
Cas doesn’t say anything to either of them as he comes into the kitchen, so Dean doesn’t say anything, either. It’s not like he
“Now what?” Bobby asks.
He does, however, like it when Dean warms him up.
“Fuck, Winchester, you’re lame as shit,” Dean tells himself. Is this really all he does? Work and come home to hang out with Cas and Claire?
“Then that’s all that really matters,” she murmurs. With another smile and a comforting press of her hand to the top of Cas’s, she and her daughter are gone. The doors close with a loud echo, more noticeable than they should be with no one else in the church to hear them.
“Sixteen-year-old named Kevin,” Dean answers.
Sam looks between them. “Colorado? Your house is in Colorado?”
There’s only a couple of motels in Lawrence, and Dean can tell just by looking at two of them that there’s no way Sam would ever hole up there. He makes a list, then, from most likely to least likely, and heads in the direction of the first one while stuffing the last few bites of cold burrito into his mouth as he goes.
Dean taps his knuckles on the cross. He thinks about ten months ago when he knelt in this dirt and mourned his brother and his nearly-adoptive father and his best friend. He’d heard wings that day, he’s sure of it. Some angel asshat who took mercy on the suckers who stopped the apocalypse and brought Bobby back to life. Probably the same one that brought Cas back but clipped his wings. Probably the same one that pulled Sam out of the pit nearly a year too late.
“For a while, the only explanation I could come up with is that it had to be Cas,” Bobby answers, slow and steady. He picks at the label of his beer bottle, eyes darting between Sam and Dean on either side of him, as he thinks it through. “Clearly that theory didn’t pan out. So I summoned Crowley next, to ask him ‘bout my soul, and the asshole told me that whoever brought me back made sure to go all out, because the deal Crowley’d had over me went up in flames and my soul was gone before he could even blink.”
“What the fuck,” Dean says, to the empty room. It doesn’t give him an answer back.
“Ronnie called you my husband,” he confesses to Dean, voice quiet.
Defiant and impulsive, he does anyway.
He startles when he feels Dean’s hand on his wrist. He’d almost forgotten Dean was there at all. “You okay?” Dean asks.
“It’s good that you’re making friends, Claire,” Cas tells her, finally. Claire’s gaze snaps to him in surprise. “That’s an important part of adolescence and maturity. The parenting books say that I should encourage this, but ensure that you don’t end up with the ‘wrong crowd’.”
“Buddy, this is the part where you elaborate.”
Flushing a dark red, Dean mutters, “Don’t look at me like that.”
Cas smiles. “You told me to get a hobby.”
Dean locks the Impala and jogs to catch up with Cas. In the room, there’s a suitcase on one of the double beds that sits half-opened. Cas goes to it and drops the folder on top.
And—oh, Cas has learned quite a lot there, too.
“Listen,” the officer says, “we got a homicide down here, and my file says that our suspect might be one of yours.”
Cas texts back immediately, and Dean’s cheeks hurt from how hard he tries not to smile.
But they don’t talk about it.
“Dean,” Cas calls, when Dean stomps moodily to their bedroom door. Dean pauses to look at him. “I love you.”
But where love made angels absolute, it makes humans reckless. And Cas knows now that one is far more powerful than the other.
Of course, it doesn’t last long.
“You never told me that,” Sam says quietly. Dean’s eyes snap up to him. “It’s okay. I’m not saying you had to. Just. I didn’t know.”
Dean has two bottles in his hands, and he passes one to Cas. The condensation feels miraculous against his fingers; most everything does, right now. Cas can’t help but smile. “Y’know, Jack will probably forgive just about anything you do for a while, actually,” Dean points out. “Kid missed you while you were gone. Kinda gives you a get-out-of-jail-free card.”
Dean was positive his nose was broken and his cheekbone fractured, but when he reaches up to touch it he feels no pain at all. There’s no fresh blood, either. Just the dried shit on his fingers. Bobby stares at him with wide eyes.
Still on the other side of the room, Sam says, “You’re quiet.”
Cas looks at Dean, who’s frowning at a lightswitch on the wall that won’t turn anything on no matter how many times he flips it. Cas clears his throat. “What?” Dean startles. He looks between them and squints suspiciously. “You seriously like it up here?”
EDIT: my AMAZING friend clary drew a scene of cas and claire to celebrate the last chapter of this being written, please go give it some love
“He better,” Dean mutters.
“How’s Kansas?” she asks, and there’s a tense pause where he can almost hear her weighing whether or not to ask her next question. “Did you figure out what you’re, um. Hunting?”
“You’ll have to forgive me if I don’t turn to look at you,” Dean says easily. “I’m a little hesitant to get my eyes burned out this early in my life.”
It’s small, there’s no denying that, and the ceilings are arched to fit the roof of the house, but there’s the same gothic arched windows up here that there is in the kitchen, and despite how dirty the hallway had been, the attic doesn’t seem nearly as bad.
you were going to fix up that’s still taking up space in my garage.”
Claire. She can’t see him like this, it will frighten her.
“About time you stepped up to help with some of the hard work around here though,” Dean grumbles, from the other side of Cas, and he laughs when Sam throws his beer cap halfheartedly towards Dean’s head. “But, uh. What Cas said. This place is yours just as much as it’s any of ours.”
he feels that apparently there was some way to pull his brother out of the Cage but instead Dean had left Sam down there for a year while he played house and pretended the nightmares didn’t keep him up most nights out of the week.
Claire turns to Dean, equal parts glaring and hopeful and one hundred percent fourteen-year-old, and what’s Dean supposed to say to that? No? He’s not a monster. He sighs and picks up his own damn sandwich, muttering, “Fine, chips are on the list, you bloodsuckers.”
“Alright,” Cas promises, and he curls his fingers tighter around the jars.
Dean nods, still quiet. Cas feels the deep breath he takes, rather than hearing it. Dean mumbles, “I’m sensing a but here.”
lame,” she complains, shrugging his hand off her shoulder. “Everyone has friends, Dean. Everyone except you two.”
Cas doesn’t even hesitate. “Of course they are.”
He pulls the Righteous Man from Hell, cradling the soul even as it thrashes against him. He restores the soul to his former glory, returns him to the human body that was clearly loved if the way it was buried is any indication, and in one final act of blazing defiance and impulsivity, Castiel leaves a remnant of his grace with the Righteous Man. A branding, a mark, a bite out of a forbidden fruit. A hand on his shoulder no matter where he goes.
Dean joins him sometimes, when the weather isn’t too unbearable, or he greets Cas whenever he comes back inside with a cold drink and an eager kiss, and Cas doesn’t mind either way. It’s a small enough project that he never feels like he needs the help, but he appreciates it any time it comes along.
A wave ripples underneath Castiel’s shoe, and the fish darts by. A blur of color. It’s fleeing, Castiel realizes, as a dark tar starts crawling through the water. Black oil that drips from the edges of Castiel’s wings.
Dean knows what Bobby thought. It’s what Dean thought, too. But that hadn’t been what he’d wanted. Not really. “Lisa deserves better than the life I brought to her,” Dean says finally, and it’s at least part of the truth. “So I left. And I drove. And I wound up in Colorado.”
For a while, all he can do is sit there, breathing in one shaky breath after another, pressing his fingertips to his throat. He’s human. He’s
The last deal struck in this same spot brought the birth of the first fratricide. But that story had belonged to Cain and Abel, and neither God nor Cain did it because they had something to prove. Dean does. This is his and Sam’s story now.
He’s just.
Though, it doesn’t end with a whimper either. It just sort of… ends.
“No, yeah,” Sam interrupts. “I get it. You have to keep her safe. For what it’s worth, I don’t think we have to worry about that.”
“Damn wraith in Platte City nearly put my ass into an early retirement,” Bobby snaps. “Gettin’ too old for this shit, boy, that’s why I plant my sorry ass at home much as I can. Friggin’ Rufus and his damned need for supervision every other case.”
“And instead you got us,” Dean summarizes. “Not exactly what you wished for.”
“Kids Claire’s age,” Dean says lamely. He shuffles his weight back and forth, for lack of anything else to do with his body.  “She could make friends.”
Sam’s hand is a heavy but familiar reminder where it still rests on Dean’s shoulder. His heart is in his throat, he’s terrified that if he opens his mouth he’ll regret what comes out, but Dean somehow
Dean can’t keep track of how much time passes, but it doesn’t matter anyway, because one moment they’re standing side by side in silence then the next Bobby’s pulling a flask out of his jacket pocket and pouring some onto the ground. He takes a swig before passing it off to Dean, who follows suit.
“Shut up,” Cas grumbles. “Coffee?”
It’s a strange thought. Cas not being here. Dean’s not sure why it makes him feel so weird.
“Sam might be thinking that’s where you’d find him,” Cas hums. “It is significant to the both of you.”
“I always win,” Chuck says. He takes a mock bow—it’s always a performance with Chuck, Dean realizes, even when there ain’t a single other soul around to watch. “See, that’s what happens when you’re me. You know. The Almighty. Is that all you guys wanted, or…?”
“You’ll be the first person I tell,” Cas promises. Dean’s face feels like it’s on fire.
“It’s good for her,” Cas argues.
“Holy shit?” Dean breathes, and there are tears in his eyes all over again. There’s fumbling as Cas raises the phone to his own ear. “Did she really just say that?”
” Dean splutters.
“Cas,” Dean breathes.
“I just got out of Hell,” Sam says, and the corner of his mouth quirks up like he thinks he’s a damn comedian or some shit. God, Dean had missed his bitch of a little brother so
“That’s just to get you out of the house,” Dean lies.
“Thanks for having us over on such short notice,” Sam tells her. “This place is impressive.”
“A house,” Dean repeats. His face is on fire. “I own one. It, uh. It has three bedrooms. It ain’t all that big so the rooms are small as shit, and I’m in the middle of remodeling it because it’s kind of a shithole, but. It’s nice. Colorado is nice. I see teenagers sometimes. And there’s this diner, they have great breakfast food. I… I have a house.”
“I love you,” Cas murmurs, as good a place as any, against the hollow of Dean’s throat. It’s an intoxicating sight, the expanse of it; drawn out by the way Dean throws his head back against the pillows on their bed. Cas kisses the spot where he can feel Dean’s heart beating the strongest. “In more ways than I even thought possible. In every breath of air that passes through my very human lungs. In every painful skip of my heart. In every aching bone, in every passing thought, I love you. I love you.”
Hell, it’s probably a bit silly to want to buy your best friend a car, too, but Dean knows better than to try and unpack that.
Their chicken coop is about six times the size of the one in Cas’s backyard, and it’s got more birds than he can even begin to count. They all chatter excitedly when the group approaches. Paige leads them to the back of the coop, to the beds where the young hens are hiding.
If his garden reminds him of creation, the small grins he gets out of Claire remind him of watching the earth turn without feeling it beneath his feet. Surreal moments, where time feels suspended, where all he can think of is how large and how miraculous something so small could seem. Claire’s a lot more free with them now, too, and yet it doesn’t change a thing. Cas wonders if he’ll ever get used to them, or if he’ll ever stop feeling lucky any time she shares on with him. He hopes he doesn’t. He hopes that there’s never a moment where he takes it for granted.
It’s strange. He spent so long drowning, that now he doesn’t know what to do with all the space in his lungs. Angels don’t need to breathe.
“That, or they aren’t listening.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Oh, you think you know me so well.”
“Dean,” he says. His voice isn’t his own. Or it is, rather, but it’s an echo of himself in the past. The same voice he’d used to tell Dean once that he and his brother were soldiers in a war they didn’t even belong in.
Cas turns his gaze up to the sky. The truth is, he knows he did, but he’ll never be able to remember which ones were crafted by his hands and which ones were the result of brothers he can’t even name anymore. There’s much about heaven that Cas is beginning to lose, but it isn’t something he wants to frighten Claire with. So he tells stories instead.
Castiel’s voice is a warm vibration against Dean’s rib cage. So close to his fucking heart that Dean’s breath catches involuntarily.
“More’n that, Dean. He’s
“Dean,” he murmurs. “It’s going to be alright.”
They hang up not long after that, Sam murmuring something about Kelly waking up and wanting to focus on the road, and Cas sits for a long while just staring at his cell phone and wondering what’s coming next for his family. Claire finds him there, when she finally finishes whatever project she’d started, and she pulls her headphones out when she sees the look on his face.
Cas hums, drinking his coffee. “That’s what it said.”
“I’m sorry,” she whispers.
“Claire,” Cas says gently.
Pay close attention, because you know whether you think you do or not. It doesn’t matter if the gods answer yes or no to or sam or dean. There isn’t one god on the mountaintop. There aren’t even three. Ask yourself your three questions and remember your answers. You’ll need them to decide whether or not it’s worth it.
Still. It’s nice. They get shit done.Cas finishes the laundry, and pulls meat out of the freezer for dinner, and does the dishes, and Dean watches the tv show he’s definitely
“Those boys outside catch a whiff of you, you’ll be subject to their questionin’ for the better part of an hour,” she tells him, nudging the door with her hip and sliding it open. “Trust me, they got more curiosity than the damn cat, I’m doin’ you a favor.”
“Do you?” Lisa interrupts. She sits forward, eyes shining. “Then why did you come here?”
“He’ll just be a baby,” Cas murmurs. “A powerful one, sure, but. Sam was just a baby, too, when his path was decided for him. Can’t we give this child the benefit of the doubt? A chance, at least, to make his own choices?”
cold up here despite the fact that it’s the hottest day of July that Colorado has seen for several years outside. This could be a liveable room for Claire, if they fixed it up a bit. It’s nothing they haven’t done before.
“Thank you.”
“Nightmare,” Cas murmurs back. He looks away.
Dean loves with his entire being—Cas has known that from the moment he pulled Dean free from the maws of Hell. Since the moment the broken soul under Cas’s care began to mourn for those he had hurt while under the Devil’s thumb, even as he was being saved from that same, wretched place.
“Drive safe,” Cas says, distracted again, and Dean spends a moment too long staring at him before he shakes himself and slips out the door.
He fixes himself lunch, and eats it sullenly at the table. Wonders what the hell there is to do around Bennett, Colorado, that won’t make him look like a loser or a drunk. After way too long of debating with himself and feeling embarrassed at his lack of friggin’ hobbies, Dean cleans up after himself then heads to his front lawn to do something there.
Have you figured it out yet?
“Got that stupid smug ass smile on your face,” Ronnie mutters, but he’s grinning just as bad. “Gimme your damn money. Just the one jar, kid, don’t try to con an old con man. Glad I gotta see you this week. Bring that family a’ yours round again next time, alright?”
Dean stares at him harder. Out of all the things he’d expected in a reunion, this was the last of it. “Hey, Cas, good to see you too, man. Last time we saw each other you got turned into a flesh smoothie. Wanna talk about what the hell happened there?”
Cas opens his eyes.
“You left your backpack downstairs,” he tells her, and he sets it down at the foot of her bed.
It’s the second-to-last time he’ll die, though he doesn’t know it yet.
Before his life in Bennett, Colorado—before being known as Dean’s partner and Claire’s father and the teacher at the rec center, before a few off-putting weeks in and out of shelters, before Michael and Lucifer and before the last seal and before a siege to hell and the rescue of the brightest soul he’d ever seen, Castiel had lived a millennium. He had witnessed the creation of everything and the turn of the earth and he had felt it in his core. He knew everything, because he
But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. This isn’t about the past or the present or the future or even anything in between. How can it be? Nothing has happened yet.
Cas grimances. He pauses, shovelling a few fries into his mouth, and chews thoughtfully. “Jimmy is gone,” Cas says finally. “I’ve known that ever since I woke up here. It’s just me in here now. And I thought… I didn’t do much right, as an angel. Towards the end, at least. Perhaps I could do something better now.”
“That isn’t true,” Castiel says. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath that he doesn’t even truly need. “I owe Dean Winchester more than I can even put into words. And even here, even in the afterlife, I will continue to owe him anything I have to offer.”
“Yeah, knucklehead, I remember that,” Dean sighs. “I just meant. What’s with the sour look on your face?”
That was it. The earth opened up and swallowed you whole, and. What? Just spat you back out again? I mean, how the hell?”
Cas shrugs. “You weren’t a dick to me. You weren’t a dick to Claire. You took out your frustrations on the house, making it safer for Claire. As far as your behavior goes, I have seen worse.”
There’s a lump in Dean’s throat and a hole in his chest. With fingers that still shake, he texts back,
“Dean,” Castiel cries out. Petrified. This is going to kill him, that much he is certain of. He’ll die time and time again, and it will always feel like this. It will always be in Dean Winchester’s name.
“You should have told them,” Jack murmurs. He didn’t say it the first time but Cas knows how the rest of this story will go. Memories either happen as they were, or they don’t. The road ends at the same point regardless.
“I can’t answer that,” Cas tells him, voice careful. “But. I do know he’ll be glad to hear you’re coming home.”
“Jesus, Sam,” Dean groans.
because the only thing he can think of that could make this whole thing seem less friggin’ useless is over five hundred miles away and trying not to burn down their kitchen.
The worst nightmare he’s ever had comes the night before Claire’s meant to start back up at school.
Dean reaches him. Dean
For a brief, fleeting moment, Castiel bitterly wonders what about humans could have compelled him so much. It’s a short-lived thought, replaced quickly by small things his days as a human award him.
Sam frowns. “Where are you gonna sleep?”
“Sorry our first night in bed together is like this,” Dean adds, mostly joking.
He hears it when the phone gets dropped onto the seat of the truck, and he hears it when Claire shouts a goodbye to Cas before slamming the door behind her. He hears it, too, when Cas calls after her, but. It’s all background noise, if he’s being honest. He feels like he’s been stunned.
Dean knocks on the door of Lorinda’s house, carefully avoiding the Christmas wreath that is still hung up even though they’re well into March. Inside the house, he can hear thundering steps down the stairs, then a young girl shouting for her mother to come answer the door. It reminds Dean so much of Claire that he can’t help but grin.
Wait.
out of the ordinary. Just a normal thing you ask your family on a Saturday at lunch when everyone is home and you have shit to get done. And that’s got to be what’s throwing Dean off so bad, because it
None of them are entirely sure how the assignment was given to them, but no angel is foolish enough to question it. They anoint Castiel to lead—he has long since given up curiosity in favor of strategy. With the element of surprise behind them, Castiel opens the gates, and the domain of their fallen brother parts for them as the Red Sea did once before.
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean says gruffly.
Dean Winchester wakes before he is meant to, and when he wakes he reaches out and clings to Castiel. He shouldn’t be able to, but he does it anyway. Dean holds on to him and Castiel becomes helpless under his hands. “Come back to me,” Dean pleads. The voice of a desperate man.
Still, he’s found, no matter how hard the Winchesters or Claire or anyone tries to teach him, Cas finds himself entirely uninterested in learning the art of subtlety. Which gives him no qualms with telling Dean, one morning before the sun has even properly risen or poked through their curtains, “Your brother would like to get chickens.”
And Dean. He
“And to be quite honest, I’m not sure I will even be able to answer all of them.”
a normal thing for them, now.
“I thought you might yell at me,” he confesses. Claire slides to the left and makes room for him on the porch step next to her, and he sits down carefully.
“They’re five months,” she explains. One of them stretches and bumps its head against her hand. “So they just reached maturity. We’ve got five at this age, but I’m guessing you won’t be starting with that many.”
“I found you, you stupid son of a bitch,” Dean insists, voice breaking. Inexplicably, his soul begins to shine even brighter. There’s longing at the core of it, one that can only be grown from years of devotion, and it doesn’t make sense. It
Dean thinks, as it sinks in just how much shit they’ve all gone through the past few days. He stares, unseeing, at his brother’s profile as Sam talks to their kid with a gentle voice and suddenly feels overwhelmingly guilty that he hasn’t said more to Sam to apologize for all of this. He lost Eileen. Then he lost Cas. And if Chuck accepts their surrender, he’s gonna lose Dean, too.
“Alright, maybe,” Sam says, raising his hands in surrender. “But. Shit, Dean. A new prophet? So, what, Chuck’s dead?”
With a glance to the backseat in the rearview mirror, Dean catches Jack staring at the bloody handprint on his jacket. The one Dean hadn’t even tried to change out of when he had finally been able to pull himself off the ground. He tried not to examine it too closely, then. But Jack is looking at the handprint now like he’s sure he’ll figure out what transpired at the bunker, what took his father away from him for good, if he studies it long enough.
“At the end of this, we win,” Sam reminds him. “And we’ll get people back along the way. We might even get the chance to save a couple of them. And we get Cas back. This way, at least, we get him back.”
The alternate’s body falls to the ground with a dull thud as he dies. It’s rather anticlimactic. Less than a year ago, Cas himself had been the one with his wings burned into the ground. He was given another chance. It’s a bittersweet truth to know that this Castiel never will.
On the third day, he takes a sledgehammer to the wall that separates the living room and the kitchen, hoping to open up the floor plan by taking it down. He only gets in about three good swings before he’s stopped by the echoing sounds of his phone ringing.
?” Sam blurts out, so loud and sudden that Dean nearly jerks the wheel in response, and, yeah, okay, he probably could have led into that in a better way, but Sam’s still going, “I was gone
“Like what?”
Dean sets himself to work cleaning up, though there really isn’t much to do since he wasn’t here all that long before taking off again. He throws his food wrappers away. Pulls Sam’s clothes out of his bag and lays it on the other bed. Toes his shoes off and places them neatly by the door. He feels restless, and he feels like unpacking would make his skin stop itching, but he doesn’t want to settle into this place. He just wants to feel like he’s at home.
He agrees, because it’s not like he has anything else to do, and if he’s being honest, he’d probably still go, anyway, and Cas rolls his eyes when Dean dramatically pulls himself off the couch. “You could go into theatrics, with a performance like that.”
Cas and Claire share a traitorous, smug look that Dean pretends he can’t see. They need a moment like that, he thinks. He hopes Cas recognizes it for what it is.
It shouldn’t have been possible. But Castiel had rebuilt every
“And then one day, something changed, something amazing, I…” Cas smiles softly to himself. Something greater than himself, indeed. He catches Jack’s gaze. “I guess I found a family. And I became a father. And in that, I rediscovered my faith. I rediscovered who I am.”
Dean’s expression shutters. He turns again, walking to the edge of the roof, and he leans against the railing. Cas follows him with ease. Dean’s face is tilted towards the stars again, but his eyes are closed. His soul is flickering as Dean asks for forgiveness—Cas is going to miss being able to see that.
“Oh, Claire, is your homework done?” Cas asks.
Claire wanders back out, after they’ve finished taking care of everything and have just settled into the chairs outside with cups of warm tea in their hands. Cas takes the jacket she hands him with a soft
They put up extra heating precautions for the chickens, though the weather claims it won’t be snowing again for a while, and Dean goes out almost religiously each morning to check on the hens and make sure they’re doing alright.
“Sorry,” Claire mutters.
“Hunting, from the looks of it,” Bobby answers. “He didn’t give me many answers over the phone, but he asked for some documents. I told him I’d make ‘em, that he could pop by and get them whenever he was ready and that’s when he told me he didn’t have his wings anymore.”
Bobby comes knocking with a sack of greasy food in one hand and a six pack of beer in the other, and when he catches sight of Sam on the other side of the room behind Dean he nearly drops them both. Dean doesn’t begrudge him for it, just takes the food and the drink and steps out of the way so Bobby can barrel forward and tug Sam down into a bone-crushing hug.
There’s an edge of desperation in Dean’s voice. Castiel wonders if any of this is real, if this is his life as it plays out, or if he’s just going through memories of a life he doesn’t remember living. And how can he even believe
“No,” Dean answers on autopilot, but after a moment his brain catches up to him, and worry settles deep into his bones. It’s easy, he thinks, to say no when he’s holding Cas like this. It’s easy to say no when he’s imagining waking up tomorrow and surprising Claire by being home. So he admits, “I don’t know. I don’t want to.”
“Are you accompanying us to the grocery store tomorrow?” Cas asks Claire, and it’s really nothing out of the ordinary since it’s something Cas has asked nearly every time they go shopping, except this time it sends a jolt through Dean that he can feel all the way down to his toes. He pauses, sandwich halfway to his mouth, taken aback by it.
And Dean knows it, somewhere deep in his gut—a heart-wrenching kind of certainty that’s hard-earned from far too much exposure to things that look like Sam and aren’t. More than anything, Dean is certain that it wouldn’t feel like this if it wasn’t really Sam. So it is, and he knows that. Hell, he trusts that. But. Something’s changed.
Dean glares between the two of them for an unimpressive moment before his expression finally slides into resignation with a sigh. “Claire,” he starts.
Dean glares at her. “I don’t think you should be allowed to watch horror movies anymore.”
“I was six months old, Cas,” Sam interrupts. The fight is gone out of his voice now, and all that’s left is undeniably Sam, at his basic core. Kind. “I was
“It’s
and Sam and Dean wait quietly while she looks at the coop with a critical eye.
“G’night, Sammy,” Dean says finally, and he waits until Sam shuts the door and flips the light off.
“So,” Dean drawls.
“Yeah, you better,” Dean sniffs haughtily, but he still winks before he leaves and blushes when Cas blows a kiss back. Cas can hear him even as he goes downstairs, grumbling to himself, “Fucking
Dean hums in response. Cas lets go of his hold on Dean’s coveralls, and they smile at each other for a moment as they pull away. Dean brushes a few strands of hair off of Cas’s forehead. “I can’t believe my kid wants to be a runner. She’s spending too much time with Sam.”
“You guys are
There’s rickety old stairs that lead to the attic, tucked behind the door that typically lead to their linen closet, and the floorboards creak under their feet as they make their way up. It’s almost horrifyingly dusty; Cas, for the first time, is frightened to know what the house looked like on the night that Dean first moved in on his own.
content warnings for allusions to ptsd symptoms, internal victim-blaming, discussions of trauma, grief, and guilt. (stuff that probably have been discussed in canon of the sea double u's supernatural wasn't a coward) please take care of yourselves as needed while reading!
Dean looks at her, gobsmacked, and this time Cas can’t pretend he isn’t laughing. He takes another drink of his coffee innocently when Dean turns to give him a withering glare. “Traitor,” he says to Claire, pointing at her with the spatula. “Everyone under this roof is a traitor.”
Later, on the night that Sam returns home another hunt he won’t talk about, they sit around the dinner table together with their plates and their beers and smiles. Dean teases Sam about the chicken coop, as though he hasn’t already started sketching out a design for a chicken coop in a notebook that’s currently sitting on their counter.
once the dust settles? When all is said and done, the shot that would kill Jack takes Dean too, and then all that’s left is Sam Winchester with his puppet strings cut and no more roles to play, stuck with two more bodies to burn and a guilt he’ll carry on his shoulders. Then all that’s left is Castiel, a ghost of the angel he used to be, who will live a miserable eternity waiting for a moment of true happiness that will never come. What good is a full-circle ending when there’s still people that survive through the end of it?
for that kind of life. He was made for motel rooms checked into after hours and for long winding backroads and a gun in his hand and monsters whispering his name in fear. He’d never wanted this, or so he’d thought, until Sammy got out from underneath John Winchester’s boot, until he’d lost one too many people, until he’d known how it felt to have Claire Novak smile at him and call him Dad.
his brother says, but even he sounds distant and uncertain.
“Pontiac,” Bobby says. Dean hesitates as he pulls the door shut behind him. He shakes himself before locking the door and hurrying down the creaky porch steps to where his car is parked in the driveway. “Yeah, that pause you just did, I did the same thing too. Guess whoever brought him back dropped him in front of that same barn. He’s been there ever since.”
“Aw, hell, baby, you don’t gotta apologize,” Dean whispers, voice sweet as honey. He pulls Cas down for a gentle, easy kiss. It doesn’t last very long, but it doesn’t matter. It warms Cas up, anyway. “Honestly? A year ago it probably would have. Tomorrow it might. But I’ve been called worse things, and I’ve done some godawful shit, and if I get to make up for that now by being a family man and a good partner to you, then I don’t wanna waste my time being bothered by it.”
“Cas, look at me,” Dean says softly.
“Good to see you, boy,” he murmurs. “Buyin’ honey today?”
“You have mustard on your chin,” Cas points out, and Dean realizes he’s been staring again, so he drops his gaze and turns red and wipes halfheartedly at his chin.
“There are worse things,” Cas tells him. He doubts there is anything that could pull him away from his sick child right now.
The question startles Sam, and he pauses in the middle of reaching for the basket Cas had been handing to him. “I hope so,” Sam answers. His voice is smooth. If anyone else had noticed his hesitation, no one brings it up.
“Yeah, fair enough,” Dean agrees, and he pulls open the driver’s side door. To Bobby, he says, “Just follow me. Roads shouldn’t be too bad, especially as it gets later. If you gotta stop, call me. We’ll do the same if we need to.”
This guy stabbed an angel blade up through a superior’s jaw. This guy got drunk after draining an entire liquor store. And now he’s responsible for the kid of the vessel who’s body he took over before booting the poor fucker out for good.
It happens quickly. One moment they’re still standing in the barn, and the next there’s a bright flash of incandescent light that rings so loud it makes Dean’s ears bleed, taking all of them back to the very moment all of this began.
How much of his worship counts as faith? How many times can he claim the times he’s fallen to his knees in a fight has been his way of praying? No, he’s long-since stopped believing in the being who created him, but there’s something else in its place.
“Maybe,” Dean agrees. “Then again, I’ve never been a parent myself. They might have better wisdom than I do.”
“I didn’t
Deadpan, Cas says, “Hungry.”
to let go of. Certain lines of thought that were too dangerous for me to go down, especially now that I have Claire in my protection. That helps, I think. Wanting to do better by the people you love.”
But it
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, just as warm. He looks between Sam and Bobby next. “Bobby. Sam.”
She finally glances up. Her eyes are rimmed red, and Cas knows in that moment that she’s awake for the same reason. “Sorry,” she tells him.
Dean’s feet are moving before he even truly processes it. He crosses the floor in just a few short strides, footfall heavy in ways he usually doesn’t allow them to be. But he doesn’t care. He’s not trying to sneak into this. He’s trying to—
“God, that’s so cool,” Claire shouts. She bumps Dean’s shoulder as she passes and bounds over to the windows. “Dad, do you think you could make me a window like you did for the kitchen? Just one, though, ‘cause I think I’d need a regular window for some real light, you know?”
Dinner is a quiet affair, tense as they wait for Sam and Kelly without truly acknowledging it. Cas tries to hold on to Dean as much as he can. As though it might steady him. As though it might reassure him.
The tide catches up to him. It barrels against his legs and knocks Castiel right off his feet. In the haste of it, his grip loosens, and Dean disappears. Castiel barely has a second to gasp for air before the wave comes crashing down. His lungs fill rapidly with water. He’s drowning. He’s
Cas feels a strange sense of pride when the people of Bennett know Sam by name, and that same warmth radiates through him now. There’s a relief that comes with the realization that his neighbors want to make Sam feel just as at home as they do.
Claire’ll love him, Dean thinks absentmindedly, as he strides back towards his car. She’s always looking for new people to antagonize, and Dean’s pretty sure the kid can’t go wrong with having more people to call family. And Sam would like the house. God, Dean hopes he likes the house.
There’s a smile in Cas’s voice that’s so prominent there’s no way Dean couldn’t catch it, and Cas says, “It’s good to hear that. I miss you, too. Mornings are not as enjoyable when it’s my responsibility to work the toaster. But I haven’t burned our kitchen down. Yet.”
Lisa stays calm as Dean lurches to his feet and stumbles towards the kitchen for a towel. She’s still quiet when he comes back and mops up the spill with shaky hands. She just...
Dean blinks, taken aback. It shouldn’t surprise him, honestly, all things considered, but it does anyway. Cas continues to eat, either unaware or uncaring of Dean’s meltdown as he processes. Finally, Dean says, “Take her with you. So, you…”
“You ever loved something so much you’d sacrifice damn near everything for it?” Dean says finally. He already knows the answer—Cas would. He has. He likely will in this timeline, too. But Castiel can’t answer for a man he hasn’t had a chance to be yet.
The end of the road is near. The last song of the mixtape ended a while ago. Think, for a moment, about what to do next after you reach the end of the mixtape.
Lorinda looks down like she’d forgotten what she was holding, and she lets out a bright and airy laugh that makes Dean feel at home. She steps to the side, ushering him in and saying, “Course not, I wouldn’t ‘a told you to come on over if it was a bad time. My son, he’s just got all his lil’ buddies out back, I was just gettin’ ready to take ‘em out some drinks. Can I pour you some to drink?”
“Why the hell are you in Colorado?” Bobby asks, before Dean can hang up. “Thought you weren’t—”
“He’s not even born yet, Cas,” Sam whispers harshly, before Cas even truly finishes his sentence. “He’s just. Christ, it’s a kid that barely even has fingers and toes yet. He doesn’t even have a name. Can’t we give him the benefit of the doubt?”
and lie to me about it when I get home. I’ll be back before you know it.”
“For Sam.”
It’s nine hours to South Dakota, then another eight from there to Pontiac. It would take Dean a straight thirteen hours or so without the detour in Sioux Falls, but this is Cas they’re talking about, and Dean’s gonna be there with everything he needs if that’s what it takes. He makes one last phone call before tossing the thing aimlessly into the passenger seat, asking Theresa for another few days off while he heads out of town.
It’s a start. Or, if it isn’t, it sure as hell feels like one anyway. Dean reaches forward and puts a hand on her shoulder, squeezing reassuringly. He says, “Growing up ain’t easy even when your life is completely normal. Wish I could tell you different. But Cas, he’s trying, okay? You wanna know who buys parenting books? People who give a fuck. And Cas cares, a lot. You’ll see that more when you get to know him better.”
They wake Claire up, a little while later, and send her up to bed with a few hugs and a kiss to the top of her head from Cas. She has school tomorrow, though he’s sure she’ll try to get out of it by saying she wants to stay home to watch the chickens. Sam heads in not long after, yawning so big he can hardly say goodnight. He squeezes both Cas and Dean’s shoulders before heading in. Dean sighs contently when Cas pulls himself out of his own chair and settles into Dean’s. They hold on to each other easily, quietly.
Bobby grunts over the line, but it’s another moment before he really responds. “Yeah. Just about to leave’n head back home.”
if u see me cranking out chapters like this is all i have to live for mind ur business i have become absolutely unhinged and i cannot be stopped
It does him no good to dwell on it in some skeevy motel staring at a reflection that’s distorted from the age of the mirror. He’s got work to do. So he works.
“Two months?” Dean demands. He yanks open the door to the Impala and drops into the seat heavily, jamming the key into the ignition. “He’s been in Pontiac for two months, human? What the hell has he been doing?”
He exhales through his nose. “What, uh. What about a Jim? Rockford?”
“You say that like it’s a
“Sweetheart,” Dean pleads. “Cas, hey, listen to me!”
aged. A decade at minimum, perhaps more. The thought stings Castiel in a way it has no reason to. He reaches out to touch the crow’s feet at the corners of Dean’s eyes without thinking.
“Kinda,” Dean answers, and he holds his hand out for her to dump the change into. “More worried about what’s at the end of it, though.”
There’s a fat orange cat sitting on a lawn chair on the porch, and she lazily raises her head when the floorboards creak under Dean’s feet. They blink at one another, before the thing starts to purr so loudly Dean can hear it even on the other end of the porch. Faintly, Dean wonders if Cas fed the stray cat this morning.
“Some whisperings,” Cas admits. “Most about the demon attack against Sam and Kelly last night. It doesn’t seem like they know exactly what happened, so it’s likely that they don’t know Sam is bringing Kelly here.”
He’s meant to be dead.
Instead of doing any of that, Dean wipes away the tears from underneath his eyes. It’s all he can do at the moment.
He lives.
“Dean,” Bobby snaps, warningly, then he sucks in a sharp breath that Dean
“C’mere,” Dean whispers, and he lets go of Cas’s wrist so he can pull Cas closer and kiss him for real.
A stone’s throw away, Dean thinks he can see the very tree that Eve plucked her damned apple from. He wonders if she regrets it. Fucking over Adam and all their descendants for something she wanted but knew she shouldn’t have.
He closes his eyes. He doesn’t have to, to hear prayers, but he always has with Dean, anyway. To feel them better, perhaps. To understand them purely.
Dean freezes in place. “He’s alive?”
“He’s gone,” Dean says quietly. They both look at the spot that swallowed up the only family either of them ever knew. “And we can’t bring him back this time.”
“Cas, that’s…” Dean starts. He exhales sharply. “I mean, I know we see some messed up crap, but. That’s fucking insane, man.”
Sam’s blood drips from the teeth of the First Blade clutched in Dean’s fist. If Dean’s being honest, it ain’t Eve he’s wondering about. He gets it now. Understands why she did it. He’s no damn better.
A righteous man wants to cross a river and take with him an angel, a demon, and his brother. He has a boat, but it can only fit himself plus either the angel, the demon, or his brother. If his brother and the angel are alone on one shore, the angel will possess his brother. If his brother and the demon are alone on one shore, his brother will drink the demon’s blood. How will the righteous man bring the angel, the demon, and his brother across the river without damning his brother either way?
“Guess it’s been a while since we hit the store,” Dean grumbles, embarrassed. He scraps together enough makings for a sandwich and loads her plate up with fruits, and Claire deems it a worthy meal for now, taking her plate with a smile and a small muttered
Cas is looking at him like he can’t understand what Dean’s trying to get at here. He scowls. “Now I am alive. You’re also alive. And you are going to take me to a church.”
“Dean,” Bobby says, before Dean can hang up. They both pause.
“Part of the job description, Lise,” Dean finally answers. He raises the glass to his lips, and isn’t surprised that the water is room temperature now. “I always look sad.”
Dean tucks their heads together, so Cas can feel Dean’s grin against his cheek. “Was it me? The answer better be me.”
“I guess,” Claire mumbles, shy now, and she’s such a kid sometimes that Dean can’t help but laugh about it. “It’s just a class. Whatever. I’ll have to talk to my counselor to make the schedule change, though, so.”
It should bother him more, but Dean doesn’t care. Not if he’s being honest. Right now he’s struggling as it is to even see the world right ahead of him, still tangled up in a moment back in the bunker’s dungeon where everything went to shit before he could even catch his breath. Still replaying it like a rolling tape, over and over and over again, a twisted sort of death echo made only to torture him. So, yeah, maybe there is a way for them to save the world again and still make it out to see the other side, but it ain’t worth the effort to try and figure it out. Especially if it means he comes out of it with everyone he’s ever loved dead.
It’s not awkward. It’s
wasn’t on purpose, and hell if that doesn’t make the pressure in his lungs feel even heavier. “Boy, don’t… That ain’t a funny joke and you know it. Now tell me you ain’t three drinks away from turning up in some ditch somewhere, dead as a doornail.”
“Thought you would be, too,” Bobby tells him.
no i did not write 9k in like one day that would be absolutely crazy why would u suggest that
The barn doors slam open, an echo of the way they did ten years ago, and the light above Jack’s head shatters as he makes his way inside. He raises one hand, eyes glowing gold, and shouts, “Sam, Dean!”
claire gets in a fight with a student at school who spoke negatively about dean and cas and the implication that they are claire's dads. it is referenced that his statements were homophobic, though they are not written out in words, and claire comes to their defense. cas and claire have a relatively healthy conversation about the incident and about the fight at school that leads to her suspension. no one is hurt by the comments, except for the kid that claire punches.
Castiel peers at him curiously. “Something tells me that, in your time, I haven’t come back yet.”
a good moment. So after Claire sprints up the stairs to grab her backpack and Dean glances back at Cas, he’s taken aback by the frown on Cas’s face. It takes a long moment for Cas to look away from the spot where Claire just was and to catch Dean’s raised eyes.
“I know,” she murmurs. She presses up on her toes and kisses the side of his mouth. “But you’re doing the best you can, I think.”
“Hey, man,” Dean says, and all the fight goes out of him. He sits down on the bed across from Cas.
it. “But there are times in searches like this where we forget that the people who have already found us are waiting for us to return.”
Sam gives him a smile, one that’s mostly an upturn of the corner of his mouth, and his eyes shine like he’s
“Don’t repeat those words,” he says mildly to Claire. She just snorts in reply.
The Righteous Man is a beacon of light that shines freely, cracking through the armor of Hell that was placed on his back, and he is beautiful.
thank you to sabi who was a literal godsend the entire time i wrote this, holding my hand through every roadblock i put in front of myself. her and cait saved my life with all their edits and suggestions and constant suffering through my voice messages and rambling texts.
is real? The tender way that Dean has touched him, the softness in his voice, all things Castiel has never earned before.
Defiant and impulsive, Cas does anyway.
Dean’s soft touch against his cheek brings Cas back to reality. Back to these people who love him. He isn’t an angel now, even if he can hear them in his head, and their battles are not his family’s to fight anymore. It shouldn’t be their fight. He wonders if there’s anything he can do to keep them out of it.
“Do you think he needs help?” Claire asks, curling in on herself again.
“You’ve become a good role model for Jack,” Cas says slowly, instead of any of the other things poised at the tip of his tongue. There are still many things that happened between Dean and Jack that Cas is unsure he’ll ever truly forgive, but Dean is
also, you can see the inspiration for the stained glass window
Bobby huffs. “And the rest of us ain’t? Monsters didn’t quit just because you stopped hunting them, Dean.”
Sam doesn’t answer right away. Dean doesn’t expect him to at all. But when Dean glances over at him, Sam’s gently running a finger along the edge of the army man he’d shoved into the ashtray when they were dumb kids, and it makes Dean’s throat tighten. After another mile, Sam finally answers, “A hundred years.”
Cas rolls his eyes. “And you wonder why Claire calls everything lame. I wouldn’t suppose it has anything to do with her spending too much time around her.”
They both stop in their tracks. Dean’s not sure he’s breathing. He can feel his heartbeat in his throat, and the demon knife clatters out of his sweaty palm and onto the ground with a dull thud. Dean blinks, and he’s still there.
When Cas opens the fridge, Dean reminds him, “There’s leftover fried rice, if you want to heat that up.”
Grace ebbs cautiously from Cas’s hands, and Jack begins to glow. There isn’t enough time. And isn’t that just the story of Cas’s life.
“Anyway,” Dean mutters, and he pushes away from the table and stands up hastily, cleaning up the garbage. “It’s been fine.”
There’s no masking the sound of the Impala’s engine turning over as it starts. Dean glances at Lisa’s bedroom window, thinking he sees a twitch in the curtains, but he drives away before he can be sure.
“I have spent twenty-eight thousand, six hundred and ninety three minutes with her,” Cas says.
It’s the wrong thing to say. Or, hell, maybe it’s the right thing, because for a second Chuck looks thrown. For a second it seems like Dean just played the only card in his hand that Chuck hadn’t seen. And it gives Dean hope, however brief, because if Chuck didn’t know Cas was gone then he didn’t write it happening, and maybe there was a chance for free will on this damn planet after all.
“So, what are you gonna do now?” Dean asks.
Even still, Cas can’t believe that someone as young as Jack could believe in something so much. Earnestly, Cas says,“I’m very glad you did, too.”
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. Jesus, there’s so much he has to explain. “Yeah. It’s not a big deal. But—”
“I know you see it that way,” Cas says. He’s not even looking at Dean, focusing instead on the plates he’s rinsing off in the sink. Dean’s head is spinning. “And that’s fine. You don’t have to recognize it yourself for me to see that in you.”
“Okay,” Dean says firmly. He squeezes Cas’s wrist—they’re both petrified to let go. “Cas. Cas, man, you gotta know… You know I…”
Dean’s prayer expands slowly, filling Cas’s lungs. Time after time he’s been caught in Dean’s tide, filling himself to the brink even though it threatens to kill him every time. It’s no different, not even in Purgatory. The last time they were here, Cas could no longer ignore the way he could taste Dean’s longing on the borders of his prayers. And it’s
Dean whistles lowly when Cas pulls the truck onto the gravel road that leads them to the farm, impressed by its size and it’s tidiness. The owner meets them halfway between the gate and her front door, with a pitcher of tea as promised in her hands and some baby goats trailing happily behind her. “This is pretty cool,” Dean murmurs to Cas, a quiet admission, and Cas doesn’t try to hide his smile.
He exhales slowly, and flexes his fingers when he lets go of the steering wheel. “Yeah. I’ve got some pictures before inside, so you can see everything we changed. Uh, if you want.”
“There are worse things in the world than people caring about you, kid,” Dean tells her. He glances up at her as an idea starts to form. “Hey, if you get all your homework done before the weekend, you can help me tear the cabinets down. If you want.”
It leads to his death, of course. Most acts of rebellion in Heaven end in either death or falling from grace, and his superiors are not stupid enough to allow Castiel the chance to choose the same path his sister Anna did.
He takes the deal. Of course he takes the deal.
Cutting through the buzzing of noise that hasn’t quite stopped ringing in his ears, he hears Claire say to the phone, “Please hurry, Sam.”
also, what the hell! only one chapter left?! i can't believe that. thank you all for sticking with me this long, i've loved all your comments and your excitement, and i'm so grateful that this little story i started for me and a few friends became something more people were excited about. i'll see you all at the last chapter with another sappy message, but for now, thank you and i love you all!
“I will,” he says instead, and Dean knows he means it as much as he possibly can.
he mouths. Dean just grins and grins and grins.
And in a small vial tied tightly with a string, Cas will place the grace and the flame around Dean’s neck and ask him to carry it for as long as they live.
Castiel tells him.
Dean takes the cup she offers him. It’s cool to the touch, condensation already on the outside of the glass. And she’s right. It is the best damned ice tea he’s ever had. She grins when she tells him as such.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says, for perhaps the hundredth time. But Sam just shakes his head.
Dean’s arms are warm and inviting. His embrace feels protective most days, and usually Cas seeks out that comfort as though it’s absolution. He’s afraid to, tonight. Afraid that somehow, if he lets himself be held by Dean, that Dean will be able to know the nightmares that have been plaguing him and that he will shoulder that burden to carry himself.

there, in the chair she always sits in, with her fingers steepled and her expression smooth. Like she didn’t just ask the question that’s gonna force Dean to change everything.
Cas reaches up, and his long fingers wrap around Dean’s wrist with a tight grip that tells Dean he doesn’t want to let go. Dean gets it. Part of him wishes he could stay.
“Oh, do they, now?” Dean scoffs.
to worship, and he is still taken aback at how someone so young could have so much faith.
A woman in a church is bathed by sunlight streaming through the stained glass window. Her voice is exceptionally kind, though Cas has done nothing to deserve it. “Do you believe in God?” she asks him, and. Well. If that isn’t a loaded question.
He wants to tell Cas it’s fine, this is the life, that Claire will understand it when she starts hunting on her own because that’s what he did, that’s how he learned, but he
“He was, Jack.”
“I vastly,” Cas says, and it carries the weight of a promise, “prefer them to angels.”
” Dean whines. He sighs, and Cas curls closer into him. “Nah, I just. I was thinking about.”
“So?” Cas says easily.
like this might put Claire in danger—”
Something sours in the pits of Dean’s gut. But it’s Sam who finds the words and manages to ask, “Why not?”
Castiel asks. He is still young, his brother much older. Soon he will be assigned rank, will join his brethren and fight in a war that none of them seem willing or able to explain. Soon he will forget that he is even able to ask questions like this.
“I know that,” Dean starts, voice rising.
Cas frowns.
“Out of the family business,” Dean says, and he pretends his entire body doesn’t hurt as he says it.
“I’ve been practicing my humor,” Cas tells him, very seriously.
Cas rubs once more at his eye before dropping his hand, replacing the sour look on his face with a small upturn of his mouth. Some of the tightness around Dean’s eyes lessens at that. Cas admits, “It’s just a headache.”
It works. Cas laughs, too. A small thing. It feels like a million bucks, anyway. “Emotionally, I suppose,” he allows. “I’ll get the hang of it eventually. Though I’m certain I’ll continue to surprise myself by just how much I can feel in one sitting.”
“You don’t know that,” Dean insists, even though Cas could argue that he very well does. Still, he doesn’t protest when Dean leans towards him again, pressing a bottle of excedrin into his one of Cas’s hand and a glass of cold water into the other. He covers the spot on Cas’s forehead where his hand had been moments before with a quick kiss. Cas smiles into it. “Doesn’t feel like you have a fever.”
Dean could argue that surprises very well may kill you, but the point seems kind of redundant. “Wait, actually, I’ve been meaning to ask you. How are you doing?”
As Cas coughs and gasps for air, choking on all of the fire and water and tar that has tried to kill him in the past, someone turns him to his side. The hands are warm and steadying, and they hold Cas as he tries to claw his deathbed out of his throat.
