“Sam is just worried about you,” she says when she pulls back from her hug. “He’s not really angry.”
And then Sam wakes up, choking on air and trembling. His old bedroom in the bunker is pitch black. He didn’t realize how much he’d grown to miss windows until he moved back into a place that had them.
Sam takes a deep breath. “I think I should move back into the bunker.”
“I know,” Cas says with a faint smile.
“What do you want to watch?” Cas asks when they come through the door.
“Did Dad know?” Sam finally asks. His voice is hollow. He’s staring at the blue and black speckled office carpet. Dean doesn’t know where Mick went, but he’s not behind his desk, anymore, and he closed the door firmly behind him.
“And he’s someone you might feel comfortable talking to?”
“Hi, Dean,” she says. “Did you sleep well?”
“It’s okay,” Sam says again. He puts a hand on Dean’s chest. Sam can feel heat radiating off his brother, so he puts the back of his hand against Dean’s forehead. He’s definitely running a low fever.
Pam lets the silence sit there for a minute before she prods him, “So, you obviously moved out of your brother’s place in a hurry. But I’m asking you to be honest with me here – do you feel like it’s safe for you to live by yourself now?”
He keeps one hand on her back, even though she’s sitting steady under her own power. She’s a strong little peanut. But he kind of wants to keep physical contact. She’s soft and warm under his palm. So tiny and delicate.
“Your oxygen levels are dropping, Dean,” a voice tells him, and hands reach to remove the oxygen cannula. “We gotta switch this out for a mask, okay?”
“Ellen,” Sam says urgently – he can hear the hint of hysteria that’s entered his voice. All he can think about is Luca, Luca jabbing his gun under Sam’s chin, Luca out there trying to find Dean. He thinks about how it must be coming up on an hour now, and Sam promised Dean he’d fetch him if he wasn’t back by then. “We ain’t got time for this. We need to get to Dean!”
in Kansas anymore.”
Ava’s large eyes ghost across Dean for a second before she launches back into the narrative she’d begun before Dean came in. “There’s just something about the pattern of it that makes me feel trapped. I wake up. I shower. I go to work. I come home. I make dinner. Brady and I watch TV. Yadda, yadda, yadda. And it just keeps going around. And I feel like that’s all life is, you know? It’s just day after day of the same shit before you retire. But, by then, you’re too old to do anything, so you die after 15 years of moping around your one-story condo.”
“That’s okay,” Sam says urgently. Dean can hear the sounds of traffic in the background now: squealing tires and honking horns. “Just stay on with me until it dies, okay? I’m almost there.”
“And you – you really wanna go to the wedding still?”
“Screw you, Sammy,” Dean says. “I didn’t ask for your help.”
“Benny’s Poppa,” Lizzy says.
“But I’m not ready to tell you about it, okay?” Dean says, working hard to keep his voice steady. Sam lost his shit about Cas. Imagine how he’d respond about Alastair. Dean can’t handle that, yet. He doesn’t know if he’ll ever be ready to handle that. “I’m working on it. I’m figuring things out. And I’ll tell you when I can. Just…just not yet.”
“It might help, Dean. It can be good to have a moderator.”
, the guy rasped. His chin dug into the base of Dean’s neck. His entire body enveloped Dean, and if Dean struggled too hard, he’d get a face full of toilet water.
She has a spindly loft-bed against one wall that probably came flat-packed in an Ikea warehouse. Under the bed is a humongous desk with three bright, flashing monitors. In front of the desk is a weird, futuristic-looking gaming chair. On the opposite wall from the bed, she has a bookshelf stuffed end to end with Funko Pop boxes. And then there’s the stacks of books, comics, DVDs, and wrinkled clothes that cover every remaining surface: floor, raised mattress, miniscule loveseat under the window, and counter – except for a tiny rectangle that’s been cleaned to make room for the pan of steaming brownies.
Dean stops him with a curt, “I got this one, man. Go back to sleep.”
There are three new messages on Sam’s phone. Jody acknowledging Sam’s message and her worry, Jack’s defeated
“You guys are close, huh?” Dean asks.
Dean nearly laughs at the word
that made me weep: “Do you know how long it took to figure out I wasn’t responsible? That you were the one creating those moments? Do you know how long I hated myself because I thought that I hurt you?”
Cas sighs. “Very well. Don’t get milk on the sheets.”
. The word is relationships. “Stuff like this.”
. So, Sam, at least, is on track for fulfilling Dad’s wishes.
“Whatever,” Dean mutters. He opens and closes his left fist, almost like he’s thinking about sinking it into the wall, like he did with his right, or perhaps his brother’s face.
, Cas said when he called Sam last night, told Sam he was worried because he hadn’t heard from Dean all day and he’d left the bunker in a bad mood.
With a wet, stuttering gasp like he’s just emerged from cold water, Dean breaks away. He sits up so abruptly he almost slips off the bed. His eyes are wide, panicked.
“What the hell?” Sam gasps. And he can tell by the blank expression on Chuck’s face, that he’s thinking the exact same thing.
Cas turns without another word, and it takes Dean’s brain a second to catch up with his legs and make himself follow him into the building. The gallery is a building smushed between an Italian bistro and a women’s boutique. It’s definitely in a part of town that Dean does not often frequent. And Sam guessed right: the name above the building is Heaven’s Gate.
“Sure,” Dean says. Lydia pauses on her way out to brush a hand against the back of Emma’s head. She makes sure not to glance at Dean. Then she’s gone. And Dean’s alone – well, alone save for Donna – with his daughter for the first time.
“We’re really not rushing into anything,” Dean says, a little desperately. “I swear.”
Then she turns and ducks back inside her window. Dean watches her leave.
“Go paint yourself!” Dean protests. He gives it up as a lost cause and decides defense is his only option. He buries his face in both his hands.
“It’s just – shouldn’t you be thinking about what’s best for Emma?” Sam continues.
It’s not as if they’re even doing anything especially clandestine. Simply being Hunters and Angels is enough.
Dean doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say or do. Should they – hug? Or kiss?
Then Cas surges upward. Dean lets the momentum carry him backward onto the bed. His pulse beats madly in his throat, but he ignores it. If he ignores it hard enough, maybe he can slip into a place where none of this matter. Where it’s just blank silence. Just movement. He’s done that a couple times before. Before with sex with Lee or sex with some girl he picked up at a bar, when everything was too loud and he was too keyed up from a hunt and his brain just went quiet. Just move. Just do what they like. Dean knows what they like.
“Tomato tomahto,” Charlie says. “Anyway, distract me, I think I’ve reached the fourth stage of grief. Life is awful and I’m never going to find love again.”
Christian looks bad-tempered, but he’s not arguing anymore. No one else protests, and Benny slaps his palms to his knees and hauls himself back to his feet.
“Dean, I’m sorry,” Cas blurts out. “I –”
he wants to say. Stop. Don’t. Don’t manipulate him. Don’t act like he’s a kid. Don’t force him to do stuff by holding the hospital over his head. Don’t. It makes his chest hurt. It makes him think about Michael, about how Dean said
“I treated you like shit back then,” Dean says. “I’m sorry, Sammy.”
He barely hears as Benny picks up; Shay has him on speaker so her hands are free to put on mascara.
Gabe has almost the entirety of the first floor to himself, and he’s knocked out all the walls to make one massive, open-floor plan between living room and kitchen. There are platters of food and bowls of candy on nearly every horizontal surface. He’s playing “Thriller” by Michael Jackson at top volume.
“Oh yeah?” Dean prompts. He understands all about shit families. He runs through everything he knows about Cas’s family: the jerkface older brothers and sister and little brother who only communicate with him over the internet, if that.
Dean’s eyes sting. There’s a lump in his throat. He shakes his head against Cas’s shoulder.
“Just,” Dean doesn’t know what he was going to say. “Just…fuck.” And he holds his hand out for the bag of clothes. The movement unsteadies him. He makes the decision to sit back on the hospital bed instead of falling on his face. He thinks he makes it look partially natural.
“You know that’s – I didn’t mean –” Sam sputters. “Of course you’re a regular person, Dean.”
“Then, if you didn’t allow your feelings to hurt anyone else, I don’t think you need to be worried about being selfish,” Pam finishes.
“He – he was my celly,” Dean begins. It’s easier if he shuts his eyes. “Two – two person cells, so it was just me and him the first night and he woke me up by – by touching my shoulder.” Dean can feel the ghost of Alastair’s spindly, spider-like fingers rubbing his shoulder back and forth, like he was petting him. Dean knew immediately what was happening.
“So you think I should apologize?”
. They just got over one argument only to start a new one.
Shit. It’s no good. Dean withdraws his arm from around Cas’s shoulder; he tries to make the movement look natural, so he brings his hand up to scratch his head. But Cas’s eyes track his movement, and maybe he sees something on Dean’s face that isn’t hidden by the darkness.
“Dude, gross,” Sam replies. And his voice isn’t immediately screaming
“I’ve got you,” Dean reassures him.
Missouri is back sometime in the next hour. She comes bearing more Jello for breakfast. Apparently, Dean’s banned from anything more substantial until he can keep from puking up his intestines. But she is able to twitch out the mask for the nasal cannula, again, which makes Dean get a little choked up with relief.
“Have you considered getting to know him outside of the bedroom?” Pam says. “You said he lives below you, correct? I’m sure you probably see each other around the building.”
Sam’s staring at them from the couch, where he’s cradling Maura against his chest with one arm and petting Moose with the other hand. He catches Dean’s eye and offers him a wobbly smile.
“The – the blood –” Dean says, remembering what it felt like to see his first dead monster when he was eight years old. “Don’t let them see –”
“Dean –”
“Hiya,
Cas slowly relaxes his hold around Jack, and when Jack manages to pull away, his eyes are red. Jack is wearing the same clothes he died in, and Cas desperately tries not to think of the abomination Belphegor inhabiting Jack’s body.
They get started early Saturday morning, just like Dean told Donna they would. As soon as Dean wakes up, he can tell it’s going to be a bad pain day. He doesn’t even bother with his KAFO or the crutches, and just tells Cas to pack them in the back of the car.
If Cas is disconcerted by Dean’s change of topic, he doesn’t show it. He answers thoughtfully, “I don’t know that it
Dad takes him by the shoulders on the curb outside of that New York City club.
“Miracle,” Dean tells her. “Mir.”
Dean’s stomach plummets. The turkey sandwich and handful of potato chips he ate a half hour ago turn over.
“No shit,” Dean says. “Sorry – I mean – no way. Uh, yeah, my brother’s tryna get me to quit, too.”
Dean walks with Emma slowly behind the ducks, who slip back into the pond together. Cas follows them.
“So,” Charlie says with a pause. “Just the mascara?”
“Sam,” Cas interrupts. “He should be here.”
But more than it bothers Dean that Cas isn’t still in bed, it bothers him that Dean slept through Cas getting out of bed. There’s no excuse for Dean to be that out of it. He knows it’s the drugs that drag him into such a deep stupor, and, fuck, sure it’s nice to actually sleep a whole night through every once in a while, but not at the expense of losing this much of an edge.
Dean smiles faintly; it’s a flash of something that’s maybe gratitude, or maybe pride, but it makes Sam’s heart swell.
Cas supposes he’ll have whichever one’s left over.
“Dean?”
were wrong.”
“Can you swallow an antipyretic?”
“Oh, wow,” Charlie answers. “I mean, I was a single child, so what do I know? But living with you brother as an adult can’t have been ideal.”
Everyone is looking at him again. Dean’s head hurts.
?” Anna whispers. She looks horrified but, worse than that, she looks hurt. “This is blasphemy, Castiel. Can’t you hear yourself? Don’t you realize that you will go to Hell–”
“I just,” Sam says uncomfortably, fidgeting a little in his chair under Dean’s scrutiny. “I mean, I get that the idea of a coparent probably sounds pretty nice right about now, but aren’t you worried that maybe you’re moving things a little fast?”
“I gotta –” Dean hesitates. “Sammy’s waiting for me. I gotta leave.”
And, shit. He crosses his arms and closes both hands around his forearms, feeling the bite of the cuts underneath. He didn’t cut deep enough for the blood to come through his sleeves, and the pain is already starting to fade. He shouldn’t have done that. It’s been months since he last cut himself. Sure, the cigarette burn was a fluke. But he shouldn’t have –
“Hey, baby,” she says, turning to Dean with an indulgent smile. “You just take your time, now.” She adjusts the canula under Dean’s nose, grabs a couple tissues from the swivel bedside tray and dabs under Dean’s eyes. “Ignore your brother,” she tells him conspiratorially. “He just doesn’t know the difference between worried and mad.”
“Marysville,” he gives in. “Community Memorial.”
“I can’t do this without you, Dean,” Sam says tremulously, looking into the corner of the room. There are tear on his face. His skin is all splotchy and swollen, which means he’s probably been crying on and off at Dean’s bedside for a while, like some kind of hysterical wife. Sammy always was a crier. Every time he does it, it makes Dean remember him as a little kid, crying over spilling his bowl of cereal or ripping his stuffed rabbit or losing one half of his favorite pair of shoes.
Not control, the reminder sounds like Pam:
Then Sammy leaves. The door clicks shut behind him, and Dean wilts. He shuts his eyes and breathes through his nose until he’s reasonable sure he’s not going to be sick again. His hands are shaking – just a steady, fine tremor that won’t let up, even when he concentrates on stilling them. It’s like something inside his blood is vibrating.
“Eileen thinks – she, ah, suggested it might be nice for me to have something to, you know, look after,” Sam says awkwardly. “Like it might be nice to have something to keep my mind off work.”
“Yeah?” Dean says. He scoots over a fraction of an inch, so his arm whispers against Cas’s. “It’s nice out here with you, too.” And then Cas looks at him, and Dean chickens out. Abruptly, Dean remembers how nervous Cas was at the gallery, and Dean feels a little guilty for dragging Cas to another crowded place. “Your sight-sound things ever freak you out?”
“I can’t just leave you –”
“You need to keep your strength up,” Cas says gently.
Either Dean’s gonna get shared custody and have an even more active part in ruining his daughter’s life, or he’s not gonna get custody, and he’ll probably slink back off toward the deep end. He can’t deny that the mirage of
Cas rubs small, slow circles onto Dean’s arm with his thumb. He doesn’t have Grace enough to send Dean back to easy sleep, but he can wait for Dean to quiet before shutting his eyes again, before slipping into calm, heavy darkness.
Hopefully it won’t be cramped for long. Dean’s already looking for somewhere new to move. He signed a 12-month lease with Gabe, but he’ll break it early if he has to – that’s if he can find somewhere else willing to rent to a felon.
“Please do,” Cas implores him, all wide-eyed and pouting lips. Goddamn, those lips. “Promise me, please, Dean.”
Four down, three to go.
But Dean’s questions clearly don’t help, because it just makes Cas whimper faintly, “No, no, no.” And then he starts hitting himself on the chest with his fists. Hard thumps that echo through his sternum.
Then Cas’s hands go to Dean’s pants again. He tugs them down to Dean’s thighs. His boxers come next, and Dean nearly sobs in relief to finally be free of the confining fabric, and his dick flips heavily onto his stomach.
Bobby wheels over to him during his lunch break to ask him if he’s okay.
“No!” Dean spits. He pulls one arm loose. A forearm lands against his neck, choking him. Dean sputters. “Let me go – fucking –”
“I think we should start looking for him now,” Cas cuts him off again.
“What’s the address?” Dean demands.
“Fucking finally,” Dean quips. He sits up gingerly in bed. Most of the tubes and monitors are off already. He unclips the oxygen monitor from his finger. He slowly swings his legs off the hospital bed. Cas can see him trying to keep his head steady; Dean likely has what he would describe as a bitch of a headache.
“Woof! Woof!” Emma cries, and all faces turn to her, including the dog – which lolls out its tongue and heads toward the tiny voice, evidently deciding a toddler is the tastiest opportunity for lunch. Dean’s dashing over to rescue his daughter immediately, grabbing her out of Bobby’s lap and holding her well out of the reach of slobber, teeth, or claws. He gets a wet nose to the crotch for his trouble, as well as friendly, shining black eyes and a wagging blond body.

They takes a swig from the bottle and over the metallic taste of the can, it tastes—

feels.
She chatters along the way: mostly about the difficulty of managing weather patterns and trying to figure out the right soil types for certain plants. How the zebras in the Eastern zone were proving to be impractical. How the apple orchard in the northern was refusing to yield any fruit, and it was two seasons past their time.  There’s no path, but her stride is long and confident. She shrugs. “Well, you do what you can do, I suppose. And then wait.”
It's a reflex action, Castiel tells themselves, it's just

Cas leans back against the fence and watches the calf trot away, back to the anxiously waiting herd.

They reach out with their Grace.
Even now, Dean falls to his knees, and stares up, transfixed, at Castiel's four animal heads that face each direction, and their wings covered with eyes, and their feet of blue flame.
Castiel shakes their head.
It has been an aeon, since they held Dean like this, and memory and longing melt into each other, in this burning embrace.
Turning back, he says, his brow a familiar crease of doubt and wariness, shoulders tensing, "It can't be

"Cas!" Sam exclaims, and then Castiel is being enveloped in the kind of hug that only a man as large as Sam Winchester could give them.
Castiel is nothing but light and freedom and Dean's warm palm against his human cheek, and there's a keening sound that's unlike anything Castiel has every heard or experienced before juddering through them, and they reach out with all of themselves and enfold Dean in their embrace.
But it isn't bees now, there are no bees here, instead it's a rumble that becomes a roar—
"You raised a good person. He's going give and receive a lot of joy."
The world's ending around them in slow motion and they are fucking.

The handprint buzzed and ached and tingled and Castiel's blue, blue eyes had looked right through him, and said things like
"No", says Castiel, "it's not Yellowstone."
"You’re a dick" he says, equally soft, "you know that?"
"There's a door" Castiel says, nodding toward where one was opening up behind Dean.
As Castiel watches, the shorter one reaches up to cuff the taller one against his temple, resulting in a shoving match, and an exasperated
"Love sets us free", Castiel murmurs dazedly, lips pressed to the shell of Dean's ear.
short while after that, Castiel hears their name being called by a Winchester.
But Dean doesn't call.

Castiel nods. “The Tree of Knowledge”

As they get closer, the tree seems to be calling to them, its power winding through the waves of their Grace, whispering their name. It feels like when they first stepped into this place- that same surge in their Grace. It’s— seductive, exhilarating.
Castiel has learnt a lot about human behaviour, but all that knowledge seems to be escaping him at the moment, pinned to the wooden floor as they are , by Dean's gaze which hasn't left their face.

Jack blinks at him in confusion.
"No more goodbyes," Dean is saying, still not looking at Castiel.
Dean reaches out first, cradling Castiel's face between his calloused hands, and Castiel can still feel every whorl and line, like before, and oh, that was an odd effect, they had not thought—but thoughts seem futile, extraneous, when there's so much to
"Which time?"
Dean keeps it.
He shouldn't.
Cas and him, they're not so different after all. They're both the disappointing sons of deadbeat dads, and Cas is losing his wings and his faith at approximately the same speed that Dean's losing everything and everyone, and the world is going to hell in a handbasket, and there's no way to fix it, no way to undo it, and he's going to have to kill the love of his life, and if this is his consolation prize, he's going to take it.
Castiel looks at her, helpless.
He rubs at his eyes with the heels of his hands, and then takes a deep breath.
"Alright," says Castiel, and oh,

He's about half way up the mountain, he estimates.
If they are going to see them again, Castiel would rather see Dean at his happiest, they think.
"Somewhere safe", Castiel replies, because they are, they can feel it, all through their Grace. "The safest place—" in the universe, they're going to say, but suddenly knows that's wrong.
"Dean," they say, and they don't hold back anything as they do.
It certainly seems to be.
and Dean laughs, joyful and free.
The warmth glows stronger.
“Well, never mind”, she says, cheerfully. “Now that you’re here, I’m sure you’ll want the tour.”
"I suppose you were too busy to let us know you were ok",  he says.
"So," says Jack, "This love thing is really vile, yeah?"
And then, after a pause. "If you can, do you think, um, that is, why don't you drop by? I'm at the, well, at my mother's place."
It startles a flock of starlings out of a bush nearby and they chitter as they fly away.
y'know."
"Dean", says Castiel, helpless now to do anything but reach out—but they hesitate, and their hand ends up on Dean's shoulder, where they'd once left a mark.
"Is this it, then?" he asks, voice crackling like wheels on gravel, "You cured of me?"
She glances at them, where they stand stiff and silent.
"Your habits have not improved", Castiel feels oddly compelled to point out, another remnant of the life—before.
Jack's pleased smile is another, sweeter reward.
"Hello, Dean", he says, and Dean falls off the Impala in shock, manages to convert it into a slip-slide until his feet hit solid ground.
Castiel hovers, out of mortal sight, and subtly makes the slices of pie taste exactly as Dean likes them.

Dean shudders under the touch, and screws his eyes tightly shut.
Liar, Castiel wants to say, but Sam's not lying.

But two could play that game, alright?
Cocooned in the softest of embraces, safe, untouchable.

After all, that was what they had given themselves over for: the chance for Dean to be happy.

Everything goes still.

Instead, he starts to investigate the ongoing baking project, which quickly devolves into the kind of good natured squabble between the brothers that Castiel has seen many times.

"What the fuck," he splutters, incredulous.

"Hardly", mutters Mary, and a look passes between her and Sam that Castiel has no way of interpreting, but seems to amuse Sam.
"Dean", says Cas, and there's something in his voice that reminds Dean of that first meeting in the barn, that same iron certainty.  "You've always been enough."
“That would be our dear Cassie.” Balthazar grins and takes a sip of his wine.
Some things happen in this chapter, decisions were made (whether or not they were good decisions or not are still up in the air).
Anger boils in Dean’s chest. That’s the tone someone would use if they’re trying to break some bad news to someone. “Don’t you dare fucking say it, Sam.”
“Mock trial? This early?” Dean pushes out air in an exasperated motion. “That’s rough.”
Gabriel's eyes widen and he looks at Sam, and Sam nods. "It was back in middle school. We were best friends, but we lost touch because her parents moved and I didn't have a phone back then to get her number."
Dean and Sam both sit there for a minute. Dean’s face scrunches, mind reeling as he says, “Who is Dimitri? And what is Adrianne’s role in all this?” He keeps his eyes on the screen of the tv for a moment waiting on Sam to respond, but the longer the silence drags on Dean realizes Sam isn’t going to answer. Dean arches a brow and glances over to Sam. “Sammy, you good?”
Dean flattens his ears and flicks his tail back and forth slowly. Ion’s eyes jump to his ears and swishing tail before he seemingly gets the hint and thins his lips, looking away. Dean is thankful for being able to show his emotions through his body like this, but he’s going to have to be mindful of it more than normal. Showing weakness to anyone here, even Castiel, could be dangerous. It will give them a stepping stone, knowing they are making Dean uncomfortable.
“Dean?!” Sam’s panicked voice comes from the living room.
Cas sighs looking rather irritated, which is a first for Dean. He's never seen him ever look anything other than passive, happy, worried, or any other emotion similar to those, but never outright irritated. The look is actually rather intimidating.
Dean feels bile rise and his stomach feels full of rocks. This was not how he thought this conversation was going to go. He didn’t think it would go well, but Sam is digging up some things that Dean never wants to talk about.
Meg hums again but says nothing.
· 4 hours ago
Then it fully hits him. That was Sam.
"Stop." Dean interrupts making Sam look at him confused. "You can't be looking at the floor while talking to her. Look her in the eyes and show her how confident you are." Dean points at his eyes then at Sam's, telling him to keep eye contact. "Again."
Well, that certainly wasn’t as sexy as he was hoping it would be.
As soon as the words leave Dean’s mouth, Sam freezes on the spot. He hadn’t connected to pieces together. Sam is going to get to meet Jess again, in person, face to face, he has dreamt of this, but he never imagined it would ever come true.
"Oh good you're showering, you were really starting to get ripe."
“Yes, they are working for Alistiar.”
Inside the room, it feels lifeless, void of the warmth that the rest of the penthouse seems to exude. Something tells Dean that Cas never comes into these rooms. He throws his duffle on the bed and walks to a window. The curtains are closed so Dean opens them, flooding the room with natural light. It helps add some life to the place, that’s for sure. Looking out the window, he watches the tiny cars and people going about their daily lives. Look at them, going around like they don’t have a care in the world.
"I'm gonna get the bacon cheeseburger too, but the question is, what do I get for Sam and his rabbit food?" He sees Cas' lips twitch into a smile at the mention of rabbit food, and Dean feels his confidence get a little boost. See, it's funny. Sam just doesn't appreciate his humor, but Cas does, and that is honestly one of the best feelings he's had in a while.
Instead of allowing himself to dwell on what could be, he stops thinking and just focuses on cooking. It's what his therapist told him to do when he started to feel overwhelmed. He may not be feeling overwhelmed right now, but he wants to avoid any attacks today.
Sam arches a brow growing ever curious at what they are talking about. "What'd he say?"
Castiel remembers the day he saw the trucker out in public. He doesn’t remember attacking him, but he remembers Michael and Balthazar pulling him off a bloodied man lying unconscious in the street. He remembers his brothers fighting when they thought Castiel wasn’t able to hear them, fighting about him and what they were going to do. He remembers the psychiatric institution.
"Oh yeah, they're actually going to dinner tonight to catch up."
He wants to rage. He wants to break something, to get in a fight. He wants to scream. But he doesn’t. Instead, he paces in the cramped space of the elevator, growling under his breath as he waits for it to reach the top floor where his mate is. After an eternity, the doors open and he sees Dean in the kitchen, the aroma of chicken and spices in the air, mixed with his omega’s scent. Dean’s scent is interwoven with his own already, and he’s only been here a short time, but it does wonders for calming him.
Sam scrunches his brows together, opens his mouth as if to speak, then closing it again only to give Gabriel a thoroughly perplexed look. "You did tell him he didn't have to join, right?"
"What?"
Dean is always worrying about Sam or how he is going to pay the bill, and the smile on Dean’s face during those times is so strained, there is nothing happy about them. Dean only forces the smile because he doesn’t want Sam to know they are having a hard time right now. All the teachers at Dean’s school are. So yes, seeing a genuine smile on his brother’s face is enough to make Sam feel giddy and like a kid in a candy shop. His brother is everything to him, and he wishes that Dean would stop worrying so much about him and worry more about himself. But there is no stopping Dean when it comes to putting Sam first, Sam knows this and he's given up trying to stop him.
“We’ll see you around.” Dean smiles and Cas nods. They say their final goodbyes and the brothers go out to the car and get in.
“My lips are sealed.” Gabriel pretends to zip his mouth and lock it with a key.
After about a half an hour passes of them just going around the booths and perusing the items, they go in the room where the panel is going to be held and find their seats. They are kind of far from the stage, but even from here they will be able to see them fine with that large screen on the stage. Sam could have sat up in the silver section, but he insisted that he wasn't going to leave Dean back here, and it would be more fun together. Sam even went as far as to find someone that has general admission ticket that came alone and told her that she could have his seat in the silver section. Needless to say, she was beyond thrilled and hugged Sam like her life depended on it, she even took a picture with him claiming she never wanted to forget him.
Dean's world spins for a second realizing Castiel Novak just asked him to join him to a restaurant. As friends of course. Although are they close enough to be called friends, or are they more of growing acquaintances? Either way, Dean is all for spending more time with Cas.
"I know it is, that's why I'm doing it the way I am!" Dean says, smacking his palm on the steering wheel like it'll help get his point across.
“Cas, I’m home.” Michael calls from the foyer.
"Sure did," Gabriel nods crossing his arms over his chest.
Dean relaxes a bit. “Awesome, okay, uhm,” He starts packing his things and slings his bag over his shoulder looking back up to them. “Thanks for the coffee as usual Gabriel, and uh,” His eyes meet intense blue ones and he has to take a moment because
They stop and they both get out. Dean grabs his duffle and slings it over his shoulder as Benny comes around to his side.
Cas narrows his eyes at her, not really offended, just annoyed. “Of course I do. And there is nothing wrong with not having sex, Meg.” She stares into his eyes, slowly chewing her gum, blowing a bubble and letting it pop. He rolls his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Chapter Title: The House of Wolves by Bring Me The Horizon
When he gets close, Dean exits the muscle car and jog up to him. Worry is creasing his eyes. “Cas, geez, you look like you’re freezing. Why didn’t you dress warmer?” He scolds lightly and wraps his leather jacket around Castiel’s shoulders, guiding him to the passenger side and ushering him in. Dean gets in the driver's side a second later and is pulling Castiel into his side, trying to warm him up.
“Good morning,” Castiel greets without looking up from a paper he’s reading. There’s a box right next to him, and Dean wonders what’s in it.
"In that case, it's too late. You might as well help us, or else you're going to be a bystander to a tragic life of emotional constipation and misery."
"Sure is," Gabriel chimes, going to take another drink of Castiel's coffee, but Castiel swipes it before him and slowly sips on it. He sees Gabriel pout and Dean gives the tiniest of smirks. "Family is important to us." Gabriel finishes, eyeing the drink before looking back at Dean.
Cas opens his eyes soon, coming down from his laughing fit and meets Dean’s gaze. Dean’s eyes flick up form Cas’ lips and he starts to blush as if getting caught doing something bad. Cas tries to even out his breathing from running around and he brings up a hand to Dean’s cheek to wipes off some mud, then slowly snakes it around to the back of Dean’s neck and starts to lean in. He pauses when he feels a light brush of Dean’s lips, pulls back a little and then goes back in, fully connecting their lips. Dean pushes into the kiss, running his hand up to Cas’ hair and pulls him closer.
*****
“Alrighty, you guys, I’m all done here. I’ll make the collar first and get it to you by the end of the day.”
Dean bites his earlobe and then whispers, “Go ahead, baby. Lemme see you.”
So, Castiel, there have been rumors going around about you.
Castiel grabs his backpack and slings it over his shoulder. “I’ll be back, at the very least, around 11 tonight. I’ll be sure to text you if anything comes up.”
“Thanks Gabe.” Dean shoots back over his shoulder as he pushes through the doors.
“Running out on your family and making them worry when they realize you’re missing,” Dean smirks, lightening the mood a little. “I know how you reacted last time, and if I can prevent that from happening again I’m gonna try.”
Does Dean want to move his stuff in here? Instantly, in the back of his mind, he screams 'YES,' but he knows that's only because he just mated with the man. He was already planning on staying here for a week at least.
“Hey, Cas, want to go see if they’ll let us join their game?”
While finishing his shower up, he pushes his thoughts aside and starts to hum along to a song playing in his head. When he gets out and gets dressed, he leaves the steamy bathroom toweling off his hair; cool air hitting him as he step out of the door. He's ready for the day, but when he looks at his brother he has barely gotten up. The only indication that he is, in fact, awake is that his eyes are open.
Sam gives him a bitch face, not buying into his little act. "You're practically beaming, Dean. Either something great happened, or you're scheming something awful." Sam pauses for a moment. "And if that's the case then I want to know what it is so I can get the hell out of dodge."
Dean pulls into the driveway and puts his car in park, making his way to the door. He isn’t sure if Sam is home already or not because Dean doesn’t know how mock trials work or how long they take, so when he opens the door and sees Sam’s sneakers laying there he is a bit surprised. Dean hangs his things up and kicks off his shoes peeking his head around the corner of the kitchen to see if Sam is there before walking in and over to the fridge. Sam must be in his room.
Castiel is placed on the passenger side seat and his head falls back to lay atop the bench seat. Dean shuts his door and gets in the other side, Castiel lazily following his movement around the car. When the car is started and they start moving, he finds himself grinning again.
Dean makes his way into the kitchen where Cas is leaning against the counter with a mug of coffee. He looks up and smiles at him. “Would you like some coffee, eggs, and bacon?”
"What are you doing?" Castiel protests, trying to get out of his brothers' hold.
He wants her here. He needs her to take control again.
“Dean, where the hell are all the umbrellas?” Sam asks from the hallway closet.
"Yeah," Dean takes a bite of food. "Sam and Jess went to school together back in middle school and he's always had this major crush on her ever since."
Cas ends up earning his head three points and Dean earns four, but Cas seen evens it out in an unexpected way, he uses his head. That has Dean laughing out loud and clapping Cas on the shoulder. Cas smiles over at Dean and then all of a sudden a raindrop plops itself on his cheek. Dean looks over at him when Cas holds out his hands, palms up and staring up at the sky. Dean looks up and immediately gets pelted in the middle of the forehead with a raindrop.
Dean leans back in his chair, arm thrown back over the backrest. These questions are easy so far. If they remain like this then he has this in the bag.
Dean pushes through the glass doors to the cafe and the smell of coffee instantly fills his nose. He smiles walking up to the counter where Gabriel is standing.
Castiel smiles to himself. He thinks he'll let Balthazar stew in his impatience.
“Something happened to me last night.” This sentence successfully catches her attention and her playful attitude dissipates. “I still can’t wrap my head around the whole thing, it was really…” Dean blows air out his mouth and motions with his hands that his brain is exploding.
The rest of the day goes by quickly. Dean and Sam are near the back again during the panel, but today is Jess' panel, so Sam was up and running around with his fancy camera trying to get pictures of her, all while trying not to be in anyone's way. But he's 6'4 and running around like an energetic overgrown puppy, so he's bound to get in some people's way, though not for long. Before long it's the end of the second day.
Pursing his lips, he takes his fork and spears a cube, popping it in his mouth and putting one of his chicken pieces on Cas’ plate. His eyebrows raise as he takes in the flavor. It’s actually … really good. Damn it.
Castiel arches a brow, but decides to let it go. “Fine, but I feel I have to re-inform you I am perfectly happy with my life how it is now.”
“We have plans, Sammy.” Dean walks out the door and smiles back to Sam in the doorway when he reaches the Impala, throwing his things inside. “You, me, and Baby here. Birthday boy’s weekend.”
“Smells more than okay,” Gabriel whistles as he walks into the room, popping a lollipop in his mouth. “Did we interrupt something?”
Alistair leers, leaning toward the computer, elbows on the desk.
"Next question. Misha was adopted, does he know any of his blood relatives, if he does, who does he know?"
Dean licks his lips looks away, he doesn't know why he feels so nervous right now, but he does. Maybe it has to do with the fact that he got every answer right and Cas is probably thinking Dean is just some overgrown fanboy. "Well, now I look obsessed."
The guards tough exterior loosens up a bit and he nods. "Yes, he told us about you both. I'll inform them, wait one minute." The guard pulls up the walkie-talkie hanging from his pocket and presses the button to talk into it. "The Winchester brothers are here."
"That episode was one of my favorites," Cas says behind Dean.
I'll try and keep this weekly update on schedule! Enjoy the chapter!
Castiel's head turns back to his brother and he holds out a hand for the bottle, when he gets it he uncaps it and hands it to the women. "Here, drink this."
. And he didn't stop until I answered.” Gabriel groans over the phone. “Next time you want to get laid, tell Sam you two aren't coming back.”
“Is he actually sleeping now?” Sam asks coming into the kitchen.
Sam throws his hands in the air, blissfully falling silent. Dean mimics his brother's motion in mockery before he starts up the Impala and pulls out onto the road. He makes his way to the university. Not because he wants to see Cas (well, he does, but that isn't the point), but because the murderer they're chasing seems to be operating on this campus.
Dean straightens in his seat, elbows on the table and he stares Gabriel down. “Cas showed me a picture of his family at the club. I thought you looked familiar from somewhere. Didn’t even connect the pieces that you worked here. You look different in pictures.”
“It’s a lot, sure, but I’m doing a lot better than I thought I would be.”
his brother's back with a nervous laugh. Sure Cas may already know what a huge fan he is, but Sam could easily exploit so many other secrets about him that Cas doesn't know. And he would do it just to embarrass him.
“I don’t think he’ll ever stop. He may just be a lost cause.”
Sam snarls. “I don’t think so.”
“And by research, he means fieldwork,” Gabriel cuts him off, making Sam glare at him. Gabriel shrugs. “Better bite the bullet from the get-go than later.” Dean’s eyes widen and Cas straightens up beside him. Gabriel raises his hands before Cas and say anything though, and says, “I was with him, obviously. I figured it would be better to be doing something productive than sitting on our asses all day.”
to do that."
Dean smacks his forehead with his palm and irritably groans, a little too loudly for public because when he drops his hand from his face he sees people staring at him in bewilderment. And just like that, Dean feels like an idiot. Just as Dean turns to get back in his car and hide from the world, he hears a little jingle and a door opening, followed by a voice he never thought he would be so overjoyed to hear.
"It is. I told you to come today because I was told my schedule for shooting ended after this last scene."
Charlie’s eyes snap to him with a smile that quickly drops and she gasps covering her mouth. “Oh my God, Dean, what happened?”
The tailors isn't anything like Dean was expecting. It's smaller than he expected, for one, and it feels more inviting than he imagined a shop like this would feel like.
Cas feels relief wash over him at this information, but also guilt because Gabriel had told him about it, but Cas didn't believe a word he said. Cas thought his brother was only trying to meddle in his life again. He will have to apologize to him later.
“Charlotte's Web?” Dean smiles wide, “I used to read it to Sam as a bedtime story all the time. I could recite the book without it in front of me.” He holds out a hand for the book. “Can I see it?”
"Don't make it anything heavy."
Cas and Dean talk in this one! Woo! I’ve been spending a lot of time planning further chapters for this story, and I’ve gotten up to chapter 19 planned. But since I’ve been doing that I haven’t been writing the current chapters. That means this is the last chapter I have written right now, but I’m gonna be writing a lot more now that I have quite a few chapters outlined.
“Do you mind if I steal your mate for some book bong time?” Meg asks, plopping herself on the couch beside Dean.
"So, where's Gabriel?" Dean asks as he walks into Sam's kitchen.
Dean’s eyes widen, he actually hadn’t heard about any convention. But now he is feeling oddly nervous because now Castiel knows he is a fan of his show. He doesn’t know why that makes him nervous, but for some reason he feels Cas is going to look at him differently now. Although the convention would be a great present for Sam for his birthday. He would be able to meet Jess again. At that thought he freezes, that’s perfect.
Cas stops himself from reminding Dean that the shaking hands can’t convincingly be blamed on the medication, because it’s something he’s been dealing with for some weeks now. But Cas doesn’t think Dean would appreciate it, so he says instead, “I’m sorry, Dean,” because he knows it isn’t like Dean to be so candid about his pain.
Eileen responds after a second.
Dean pulls away, breathing hard, chest heaving against Cas’s. His eyes are red; there are droplets of water on Dean’s eyelashes. Cas can feel chilly tear tracks down his own cheeks.
Dean rolls his eyes, because it’s not like he did. He’s never been able to get super into the Halloween thing. Dressing up in costumes always seemed like it would be fun, but Sam grew out of that shit when he was about ten and never got back into it. So, Charlie’s not too off on her predictions for his night; except he’d be demolishing a bag of Snicker’s in front of
“That cold still bugging you?” Donna asks when he unsuccessfully muffles a coughing fit into the crook of his elbow. It leaves his chest aching.
“Fuck that, Benny –” Christian begins, but Benny cuts him off with a raised hand.
“I know when my birthday is, Sam.”
Miracle clearly still senses Dean’s volatile emotions, so he hops onto the couch after Dean and puts his head in Dean’s lap.
“Gonna…” Dean breathes, shuts his eyes, works his tongue around the word. “Shower.”
He sticks his books and records on his shelves, puts Mom’s picture on the night table, nails his
He knows it isn’t Charlie, because she would have come through the window. His heart jumps, and he tries not to hope it’ll be Sammy.
“Oh,” Dean says. “Nah, man.” He takes a puff. His throat is starting to burn; he’s not used to the feel of pot, even if he’s been smoking cigarettes on and off for the past 15 years. God, 15 years. Maybe Sam’s got a point; Dean should quit. “I’ll probably go sometime this weekend. I been too busy at work.”
he adds.
Cas doesn’t say.
Dean heads into the kitchen, deftly maneuvering with his crutches to the fridge for a block of cheese and jug of milk and to the cabinet for a box of macaroni and flour for the roux. An unexpected lunch party of five adults and three little kids who eat solid food calls for Dean’s famous mac and cheese. He’s graduated from Kraft over the years.
“Okay,” Billie says. “So, what happened after that?”
“Sam!” Dean barks. “The fuck aren’t you waiting at Turner’s?”
Cas doesn’t want to bring Dean back to his room, not with the guns and sabers on the walls, so he brings him to his own room, instead. Cas immediately wonders if that was a mistake, when he flicks on the light inside the door and sees that every surface of his room is covered in a thin film of dust, that the air is still and cold with an unlived-in quality. Cas remembers that he hasn’t slept in his own bed for some nights now.
“No, I –” Cas says uncertainly.
“Sorry,” Dean whispers again. He’s probably ruined her night. She probably had shit to get done. And now she’s stuck babysitting Dean, and she shouldn’t even
“Alright. On average, we’re looking at a six month to a year process. I’m going to look into whether we can petition for visitation rights in the interim.” Mick looks up from Dean’s paperwork and fixes Dean with a stare that makes Dean feel even more nauseous. This is the part where Mick tells him that he doesn’t need to bother; the battle was lost before Dean even got a chance to fight.
They take Cas’s truck. Because Dean refuses to let Cas touch the Impala; if Dean can’t drive it, then no one else can. But Dean hates Cas’s stupid truck, mostly because Cas loves it so much, and it’s just a hunk of plastic and metal – not a classic like Baby. And mostly because Dean hates being carted around like he’s a fucking middle schooler.
“Didn’t mean….” Dean stops because he’s not really sure what he means. “Okay, Sammy,” he finishes faintly.
Dean’s always liked Charlie – she’s snappy and fun and always good for a laugh. The other guys complain about how she doesn’t put out, but Dean doesn’t need her to put out; there are plenty of other girls around for that.
“Yeah,” Dean retorts, pleased that the word
“When is he not hungry?” Sam remarks. He and Benny exchange knowing looks, and Dean would have flipped them off, but Andrea comes back through the house, and this time she’s holding a bundle of little girl and flowery sundress.
poster he’s got framed on his wall.
“Well, good,” Dean replies.
“The first step is filing your motion, which is a great deal of paperwork on your end,” Mick explains. “We’ll serve Ms. Lydia Penn with a summons – I’ll reach out to her lawyer, Ms. Bevell. You’ll have to complete a litigant awareness and a parent education program. If Ms. Penn opposes your motion, we’ll request a meeting. Usually, a judge will request you both meet with a mediator before scheduling a hearing.”
“Right,” Victor says. He steps forward. “Center and shake hands.”
“What did you do to Cas?”
“You done?” Sam asks finally, when Dean’s finally just gasping and trembling. His stomach cramps painfully around empty air. He’s familiar with the sensation; it’s the same thing that happened after he OD’d in that clinic four years ago. When Sammy was dead. Wasn’t dead. Whatever.
For a second Dean thinks Sam’s going to lash out at him in turn. They’ll have a repeat of Dean’s last night at Sam’s apartment and not talk to each other for another three weeks.
Sam’s already waiting in the car by the time Dean comes back into the kitchen. Eileen steps forward and hugs him, which is – fine. It feels nice to at least be on someone’s good list.
Mick must spot the slightly crazed bafflement on Dean’s face, because he jumps back in, “A request for admission means they can ask for you to admit or deny a specific statement and then explain your answer. A request for documents means you need to provide any documents they ask for: text messages, proof of employment, etcetera. A subpoena
Charlie elbows him in the arm. “Hey, you can’t be the mom friend.
, Dean thinks, what a stupid-sounding name. Like something in a song, maybe. Or like one of those Latin prayers the priests would mumble when Sam and Dean got dragged to church once in a blue moon if Dad was sober enough to care.
“Too many cooks, Sam,” Dean says, grinning relentlessly. Even though he was in his apartment for only a month, he’d gotten used to having his own space. It’s weird to have to dodge his brother whenever he moves, now.
Time moves slowly and then too fast. Dean isn’t one-hundred percent sure what he’s doing or where he’s going. He’s in the war room, wearing a jacket he doesn’t remember putting on and wearing boots that are laced too-loose, and he has a vague recollection of Sam on his knees at the foot of the bed, tying the knots, but he’s not sure that’s right.
“I’m good,” Dean says. He knows Sam can see his red eyes, but he’s glad when Sam doesn’t mention them. “You should get Eileen over here – introducing her to the family. Big step.”
Meg looks over at him calculatingly, and Dean gets the impression that she’s zeroing in on everything he really doesn’t want people to see, right now, including the very faint stirring below the waist as he can’t help but imagine what Cas had looked like as he stripped when Dean was in the bathroom.
Dean only fleetingly thinks about Cas, but even he knows that that’s not the kind of boundary you plow down when you’re – whatever Cas and he are. It really isn’t fair of Dean to keep piling things on Cas’s shoulders if Dean’s not prepared to open himself up to more from the guy.
Benny launches forward with a roar. Christian snarls like a tiger and meets Luca head-on. Victor ducks as Raphael takes a swing for his head with the bat. Chuck pelts the basketball at one of the Angel’s feet, tripping him up. Ash whoops, “Yee-haw, motherfuckers,” and leaps into the fray.
in pain. They’re strapping him down, and Dean’s fairly certain he’s yelling, then whimpering like some pathetic child to not chain him up because he hates being chained up and
Dean turns wildly, top box in his arms sliding off and crashing to the floor – onto the stranger’s toes if the resulting curse is any indication – and freezes face to face with Sam.
– Christ, it’s his daughter.
“Oh yes,” Cas says, voice muffled in Dean’s mattress. “This is very nice.”
But then there’s a thrum of strange pain deep inside Dean’s chest. Dean tightens his grip on the blanket, trying to steady his breathing.
“Dean, wait.”
“Alright, Sammy, get out of here,” Dean says finally, after Sam has to dry his hands on his jeans because dishtowels are apparently another aspect of domestic life Dean lacks. “House is yours now. Go bone your new girlfriend, what’s her face.”
“Whoa,” Dean stops his daughter from breaking into a full-tilt run, catching her around the middle. “We don’t need to chase ‘em, sweetheart. They don’t like that.”
“No,” Lydia says, putting up a hand as though she wants to push his chest. She swallows. Shuts her eyes. When she blinks, there’s water on her mascara-caked eyelashes, but her eyes are clear. “I’m just being selfish,” she says. “I’m happy Emma can spend more time with her father – with – with you. I’m happy for you, Dean. And the – the future –” she swallows, clearly incapable of thinking farther ahead, of considering a future with even less time with her daughter.
“Damn,” Charlie says. “Does this mean I’m supposed to change my profile picture?”
Sam honest to God scuffs the toe of his shoe in Dean’s floor like he’s a toddler caught with his hand in the cookie jar. The sight makes something lodge itself in Dean’s throat, but he forces it back down.
It was difficult to fall asleep that night. They hadn’t shared such close quarters in a while. Sound doesn’t carry well in the bunker, muffled by stretches of cavernous corridors and thick walls. And the sounds Sam made while he slept, sounds that used to be soothing in their familiarity, made Dean’s teeth itch: ruffling sheets, scuffing shoes, clearing his throat, click of the light switch that plunged the room into darkness.
“Then I won’t ask you for it,” Cas says calmly. “I’ve told you that before. I’m prepared to accept whatever you feel able to give me.”
“Someone’s overcompensating,” Mark scoffs, breaking the silence. His brothers laugh with him.
“Did you, ah, wanna hang out at my place for a little while?” Dean says hesitantly when they’re back in the car. “We could watch some of that media your mom’s so against if you want to.”
“You should let me do your hair,” Anna replies. “Puff it all up in front like the singer everyone loves. Pompadour? Yes, an Elvis pompadour.”
“Holy shit, it’s just hair. It has nothing to do with liking dick,” Dean snaps, and the table goes silent. Sam’s eyes are wide. He’s staring at Dean, and his mouth is slightly slack. It’s probably the first time ever Dean’s defended his brother’s hair – and it still looks stupid as fuck but – shit. The back of Dean’s neck is hot. It feels like flames are licking up his spine toward his brain.
Dean only realizes he’s crying when a sob gets caught half-way up his throat, and then he’s sucking in a rattling breath of air as he struggles to regain control.
“I’m Dean,” Dean adds, because he’s supposed to be normal, and being normal means introducing yourself. And this is not an emergency, he reminds himself sternly. This is not an emergency, so his body can just chill the fuck out. Bastardized fight or flight reflex be damned.
“Feel free to bring her into the living room,” Donna breaks into Dean’s thoughts. “She’s got loads of toys in there.”
“Hey,” Gabe calls before heading back downstairs, “if you’re gonna die of the plague, do me a favor and don’t do it on my property, okay?”
“What about you?” Charlie says gently. “You okay for real?”
“Sorry,” Dean says tonelessly.
And no. No. Dean doesn’t want to remember. Dean doesn’t want to remember the stink of his cell. The slippery crud the mops left on the floor. The thin polyester sheets, pilling with use. And him – him – Dean doesn’t want to remember him.
“I, um – it’s not finished yet. In fact, I began it last night. I was unexpectedly inspired, and I worked on it all day. But I wanted to – to ask you something before I continued.”
“How are you feeling?” Lydia asks, clearly noticing how gingerly he’s moving.
Now, though, Dean will balloon if he’s not super careful about keeping to a balanced diet and regular exercise. He doesn’t need to have, like, a six-pack; he’s totally okay with the inch-thick softness on his belly. He just doesn’t want to
And then something sticks him in the neck and the shadows at the corners of his vision billow and grow until all there is is darkness.
“In the sitting room with Caleb,” Christian replies.
Or maybe he’s been systematically torn limb from limb. Splayed open on the cot. Someone’s fingers playing with his intestines. And Alastair’s voice in his ear you will always belong to me.
“What are you doing here?” Cas furrows his eyebrows, tilts his head a little to the side like a bird, and Dean could really get used to that faux-grumpy tone he pulls out when he’s seemingly puzzled but intrigued at the same time and frustrated about the warring emotions.
and he’s fucking scared, okay? He thinks he’s really sick. He thinks he might be dying.
Dean slams the hood of the car so hard he shakes the entire frame. He remembers being twenty-seven, taking a tire iron to the trunk of the Impala, over and over and over.
Cas doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do. Cas is fairly sure Dean knows what’s happening right now, but – Cas doesn’t know what to do. He – he stopped denying long ago that this is what he wants.
“I’m turning into another freaking Martin.”
“Do you think,” Cas begins tentatively. Sam looks up. Cas takes a deep breath, “that perhaps the bunker isn’t the best place for him?”
He’s pushing his chair back and standing before Cas can think about making a move to stop him. “I’m gonna shower,” he says.
He’s not sure how much longer he can last when the check-in officer finally calls for boarding of their flight. It’s not crowded, and Dean and Cas get a spot near the front of the line.
“And you still let Sam drive you around in that dump?” Dean asks incredulously, jabbing his thumb toward Sam’s Prius from 2010.
“What?” Dean snaps, reacting too quickly, so he hasn’t fully registered what Sam –
It’s like something breaks overheard, the first thundercloud moving across the sky and letting a knife of sunlight through. The relief is so palpable, Dean’s shoulders drop. Sam looks infinitely more relaxed, except the poor kid still looks exhausted.
“Alright, Lizzy,” he tells the little girl, readjusting her so he’s holding her away from his chest so she has space to stretch out her arms and pretend she’s flying. “Let’s dive bomb these suckers.”
“Oh, shit,” Dean says, eyes widening. “Charles, I totally forgot –”
Dean’s struck by the sudden, wild urge to confess everything to this douche: ghosts, monsters, demons, and, oh yeah, that
Dean’s already heading out the bedroom door. He propels himself across the living room, passed the front door, and to the bedroom on the opposite side of the house, inwardly cursing the thirty or so feet of space. He’s aware enough that this is technically not an emergency – at least not the type of emergency that requires the blade strapped in a secured holster under the armrest of his chair – but it’s still his kids, dammit, and any time spent getting to them is wasted time.
Sam huffs out a laugh, then picks up a slice, stuffs it into his mouth, and doesn’t actually look like he’s going to throw up again, so that’s a plus.
“You did?” Bevell says, feigning surprise. “But I thought you didn’t drink?”
“It’s – shit. I’m not some girl who got roofied at a party. I’m – Jesus Christ. It’s not like that.”
Dean shrugs, but he can’t quite help the upturn of his own lips. Something about Charlie’s smile is contagious. “Yeah, we’re okay.”
Cas looks a little alarmed, but Charlie’s already up and pulling on his hand. Meg laughs and shoves Cas out of his chair, so he’s forced to totter after Charlie. Charlie pulls him into the middle of the crowd, shows him how to sway his hips to the music, and promptly dissolves into hysterical laughter, clutching at Cas’s shoulders to stay on her feet, as he attempts to mimic her.
“Being pals with the bartender has it’s perks,” Charlie informs Dean as they make their way back to the table. “I have met many a lass through Jesse’s good word.”
Cas nods once and falls silent, evidently satisfied. Evidently putting his trust in Dean. And Dean doesn’t know what to do with that: someone trusting him so unequivocally. He doesn’t think even Sammy trusts him like that anymore, not since he was a little kid. Sure, Sammy trusts Dean to look after him, to bring home food, and to keep a roof over their heads, but this trust is something deeper. Something almost like faith.
“Cas,” he says urgently, and he reaches a hand toward Cas’s shoulder, but he realizes it’s the one that’s covered in Cas’s jizz, so he pauses for long enough to wipe it off as best as he can on the edge of Cas’s quilt; ain’t like it’s clean anymore, anyway. Then he puts his hand on Cas’s shoulder. “You – you okay? Did I…” Dean doesn’t know what to ask. Did he do something wrong? Did he hurt Cas somehow?
this. Cas has witnessed many of these dark places, himself – but Dean always manages to pull himself out of it. But what Cas doesn’t understand is why
“I – wanted him to be gone,” Dean says haltingly. “Sam wasn’t helping anything by yelling at Dad. It was just making Dad worse. And I didn’t want to have to deal with Dad worse if Sam was still there.”
“I think Sarah is a curator at a gallery over there.” Sam ignores Dean.
The resurrection of Alicia came as a surprise, but Dean’s not going to tell Max that his reheated burrito of a sister is an abomination. Hell, nuance is something Dean understands. For fuck’s sake, his dentist is a werewolf and his therapist is a shapeshifter. Dean gets it.
And Dean tries to tear his brain away from
Dean’s fucking sick of it.
Four things he can feel: shivers running up and down his spine, so strong they’re like spasms. Dull, bone-deep ache in his left hip, knee, and shin. Cold. Cold linoleum on his legs, arms, and through his shirt on his back. Pain. Sharp, burning, exhilarating pain on his forearm as he claws stripes into his skin with his fingernails. Over and over again, digging in hard, until he breaks skin, and he picks up blood and skin under his nails. And then he stops, breathing hard, feeling steadier. His arm stings persistently. It’s something to hold onto.
“Michael’s in charge now?” Dean says, and he can’t say he’s displeased. Turned out he wasn’t such a douche, after all.
“So, we’ll have to kill him?” Jack guesses, and Cas is eerily reminded of the time when Jack asked why they bothered protecting Dean when he was possessed by Michael, because what was one human life against millions?
“No,” Cas protests immediately. “We bound God. He can’t touch us any longer.”
The vibrating doesn’t stop. Keeps up in his head even as Dean shoves the Impala into park on the frontage road in front of the bunker.
“What time’zit?” comes a bleary voice from Dean’s bed.
Dean has good timing; Sam’s already in the middle of a yawn.
And Sammy – Sammy’s not gonna want to come back. Not when he’s just patched things up with Eileen. Not when he’s got his own family to worry about now. And what a pair they are: the Winchester brothers, tag-teaming crises.
Dean’s not there. He’s not there. He can’t be there. This can’t be happening. This – Sammy wasn’t supposed to know. He was never supposed to find out. Dean remembers it. He remembers it every fucking time, getting on his knees for those filthy fucking douchebags. He remembers the bruises and the sick, boiling shame in his belly, the terrible fear that Dad would somehow discover his disgraceful secret –
“Calm down, Dean,” Cas says.
“Dean,” Sam hisses, leaning over the table. “Take it down a notch. Jesus.”
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas says. He pauses with a hand on the door jamb. “Come get me if you need anything.”
Sam’s already shaking his head. He feels like he’s going to throw up. He doesn’t know when he started trembling. Because he doesn’t know. He doesn’t fucking know.
God knows, Dean would have lost his mind twice over if it hadn’t been for Cas. Cas always seems to know the right thing to say. He has infinite stores of patience and tenderness. The only time Dean’s seen him falter was when Ella pointed to a picture of Sam, Dean, Cas, and Jack in the bunker – taken by Mom, maybe, or another of the apocalypse hunters. Dean watched Cas’s eyes film with tears, his mouth drop in rare speechlessness, and Dean answered for him:
But before she can make good on her promise, a blade slashes through her neck. Her lifeless body lands on its knees before hitting the floor.
Anna shakes her head. Her eyes are red and wet with tears.
“You didn’t know, either.”
Something catches in Dean’s throat – it might be a smile or it might be a sob. Whatever it is, he swallows it down again. Together, he and Cas hobble into the hallway. Dean marvels at the silence throughout the bunker, and he thinks about the fact that Sam and Eileen really should be back from their vamp hunt and banging in his queen-sized bed by now.
“Yeah,” Dean says. “Listen – if you need anything – you can call me, okay?” He wants to make the same offer he did to Charlie: ask him to be there, and he’ll be there, but Boston is a lot farther than Iowa. Dean definitely can’t make it in a three-hour drive.
“You stood me up,” says a quiet voice beside him.
better, said he was Batman and Sam was Boy Wonder, but Sam likes
Miracle senses Dean’s distress, derives that Cas – the – thing that looks like Cas – is to blame, and starts growling, hair on the back of his neck standing on end.
“I’ll be okay here, Sam, honest,” Dean insists. “I’ve got Charlie next door and Cas downstairs.”
“That, ah –” Dean’s Adam’s apple bobs. “That what you came for?”
And Jo laying it all out like that feels like she’s sliced through Dean’s sternum and revealed his inner organs to the hot, dry summer air. Everything’s fucking open. Everything he’s tried so hard to push aside is right up in front of his face. Jo and Lisa and Ann Marie and Lydia. And Cas.
It’s Friday. He survived a week on his own. And he made a new friend who doesn’t care that he’s crazy.
“Dragged your sorry ass into bed last night and this is the thanks I get?” Dean says. He perches on the edge of his chair, waits for Sammy to say something, and when he doesn’t, continues, “Up and at ‘em, Sammy. I’m gonna eat your breakfast.”
“I’m sorry,” Sam interrupts him. “I’m sorry, Dean. I didn’t want to freak you out, but I couldn’t tell you over the phone. I – Cas and Eileen are coming back from work. They’re picking Ella up from kindergarten –”
“None of your fucking business, give me the keys!”
“Sure, there was Sammy, before. I always lived for Sammy when I could. But this is different – God, it’s so fucking different. I can’t – she’s so little, Mom,” Dean says desperately. So tiny and helpless and trusting. Dean meant what he said to Lydia: he’d rather die than hurt his daughter. “She deserves to have someone who loves her and it – fucking terrifies me when I think that I could have left her.
Charlie’s eyes glisten. “I’m sorry,” she says in a small voice. “I don’t know what I’m talking about. I don’t – I shouldn’t – I’m sorry you had to go through that.”
“Bread and other processed carbohydrates hold very little nutritional value to ducks. But it makes them feel full, so it replaces their naturally balanced diet,” Cas rattles off.
“My sister has attempted,” the guy says stiffly.
“I didn’t say that,” Sam says. “If you wanna keep him, we can keep him.”
“Come on, man,” Dean protests. “How can you be into nerdy shit like this but not know
“Hey, Pipsqueak,” Dean says, and he reaches across so Andrea can deposit Lizzy into his arms.
“What you do in bed is your own business, Cassie, but I just don’t understand why you had to bring him
Eileen.
.” Dean rolls his eyes. He switches his phone from his right hand to his left hand so he can sort through the crap in his closet. He cannot remember the last time he picked out an outfit the night before an event. “He just asked me ‘cause none of his other friends could make it.”
Goddamn, Dean needs to get out of this dump. Needs to get Sammy out of this dump.
But it’s – it’s not that simple.
When he comes out of the bathroom, Cas is awkwardly perched on the arm of the couch, obviously not sure what he’s supposed to do now.
See him again and nothing, Dean insists. Can’t he just get to know the guy? Isn’t Dean allowed to make friends? Isn’t that what he’s supposed to be doing?
“Let him go! Let him go! Let him go!” Sam screams at the top of his lungs and punches, scratches, bites, every bit of Luca he can reach, because Luca is going to kill Dean. Dean is on the ground and Luca is pummeling him: kicking his head and ribs, and the pool of blood around Dean is getting bigger and bigger because Dean isn’t doing anything to defend himself, and maybe he’s already dead –
,” he hisses in pain and hopes to God that it’s not broken. He raises his sleeve to his nostrils in an effort to stem the bleeding.
“Dad walked in on us once,” Dean says. His chest hurts. He remembers the flush of his cheeks. The shame building in his throat as he fumbled to put his boxers back on, as Lee grabbed for the comforter and cursed, face cherry red, but grinning stupidly because they were both drunk, and –
“I could get her to call you grandpa,” Dean teases.
. And they talked about retiring, someday, setting up a bar together. The dream. But Lee is dead now, and Dean killed him. The dream turned out to be a fucking joke, just like always.
!” Sammy screams from behind Dean.
“It’s okay,” Dean says, a little unevenly. His eyes are fever-bright with pain and exhaustion. “It’s okay, Sammy. They won’t find you. Won’t let ‘em.”
, man. I ain’t dying,” Dean grunts. And Cas knows this is how Dean gets when he’s hurting and doesn’t want people to know. He gets aggressive when he’s trying to protect himself. Cas has finally realized, that when Dean tells him to leave, he doesn’t really want him to go.
Sam pauses by the side of Dean’s bed. He’s all twisted hands and earnest expression, and Dean can’t stand it.
“I don’t want to leave him alone,” Sam says through his constricted throat. “But I don’t – I don’t want to leave you –”
But the idea of dragging this ordeal out
“Dean!” Charlie squeals excitedly when Dean enters the room upstairs. He didn’t notice it the first time he visited the bar, but the entire second floor is set up like a cozy study area or coffee shop. There are plush, ragged couches, stacks of boardgames on the floor, and tiny reading nooks. Charlie’s group is seated at a round table in the corner of the room.
Cas picks up his speed down the hallway and reaches the kitchen at a run.
Dean holds the smoke in his mouth until it makes his gums sting, then he breathes it out through his nose. The bar door opens, and a rush of noise washes out onto the street. Dean doesn’t even bother looking up.
“You can, ah, just leave ‘em here,” he says. He digs into his pocket for his wallet, totally at a loss for how much to tip the kid. The poor guy looks like he’s in high school. He dressed up like a toy soldier, cap not quite able to contain his afro of tight, black curls, and he has a nametag on his chest:
There’s a certain kind of pain, right on the edge of too much, a constant sting, almost a burn: that’s the sweet spot of distraction. And Dean needs it. Needs it to all go away. Needs a fucking drink, because he wants the constant rush inside his head to disappear, and he knows it will disappear if he can just have a drink.
That's it then?
Dean groans and rubs his face. “Well, he was one of the regular Johns that would ask for me. I didn’t care since he paid well and was nice to me. I obviously didn’t know who he was, but then he started getting kinda possessive. It was unsettling, so I’ve been avoiding him for months now. Ever since he told me he wanted to more or less buy me. He was talking about how he hasn’t liked any omega like me since his mate died.”
It was nice of him to do that though...
*eternally cries over Castiel because we don’t deserve this man* I love him so much T-T
“So, was that the boyfriend you told me about today?” Inias asks, grabbing a glass and pretending to clean it.
Shit, what if he fucked his kit up by smoking? He didn’t know, but it would be his fault if- oh God. He needs to stop thinking about it for now. He’s getting worked up, and he doesn’t need that when he’s going to see Castiel.
Dean pulls him into a bruising kiss before whispering, “I’m gonna take you apart the next time we’re alone.” The promise searing into his skin, sealed by a kiss Dean plants a moment later where the words are spoken.
"Gabriel and Luke were convinced you were into men. And here I was, the one you live with, simply thinking you were shy." Michael busts out in laughter again and Castiel can't fight the smile that's forcing its way onto his face.
“Dead? Most likely.” Cas stands and starts to pace. “I should have known this would happen,” Cas almost whispers to himself. “I should have been prepared.”
“This way,” Balthazar says when he’s halfway across the lobby. Dean hurries to catch up, not wanting to be left alone with the alpha doorman. Balthazar stops beside a beta at the elevator, whose name is Inias. “
Sam chuckles at her and shakes his head. He's missed, Charlie. "No, nothing like that."
“Well, the offer still stands for you if you want to get out of the house.”
Dean’s heart jumps and he can’t tear his eyes from the screen. This is real, that’s his kit. He flattens his ears to his head, trying not to get emotional. He never thought he’d make it this far. He clears his throat. Dean puts his hand on the side of his stomach, happy he's doing good. Meg prints a sonogram and hands it to Dean. A smile forces its way on his face and Meg gets a towel, wiping him off. Dean stares at the photo of his son and his breath catches in his throat. He sits up, fixing his shirt. This is more than Dean ever imagined he’d have.
Sam laughs but remains quiet for a little while, but his curiosity gets the better of him. "So, what did you do backstage?"
Dean’s heart lurches, those words are never good. “We are talking,” Dean says, trying to lighten the tension he’s feeling now. So much for peaceful. Cas continues to watch him and it makes Dean uncomfortable. His eyes are intense, like a bird of prey. Maybe it’s just the air that Cas gives off.
Chapter Title: Come Together by Godsmack
"Sam, of all the things you could worry about, her being
“You are unhappy,” He doesn’t say it as a question.
“Oh, you know,” Dean pats his bag with the papers in it. “Work.”
Yes, that is true, but this rumor isn’t something we have heard about you before in such a serious tone. Is it true that you are actually in a relationship now?
The other man doesn’t speak and Dean feels like he’s about to throw up. Why are they after him? Why do they want him so badly? This obviously isn’t about Alistair wanting Dean anymore. Dean thought Alistair wanted him because he used to piss him off by beating up his men. But this... this is something bigger, much more complicated.
“You will also be needing this,” Cas says, making Dean look at him again. He’s pulling a card out of his pocket and holds it out to Dean. Dean takes it before inspecting it carefully and looking back up at Cas for an explanation. “That card is linked to my account, so you will be able to buy what you want.”
“No.”
Gabriel arches a brow looking between Charlie and Sam. "What's with the secret eye conversation?" Gabriel's eyes widen realizing what is going on. "No way…"
Cas smiles wide and pulls Dean back in for another quick kiss, needing to feel his lips on his again. “I didn’t know you were a fan of
Chapter title: Waves by David Lewis
"What?" Castiel asks incredulously.
When he’s walking up the stairs, he can hear Balthazar say, “Did you two have to break his heart like that? Dean is his first real boyfriend, and he seems like he genuinely cares about him. You should be happy for him.”
"Thanks," Dean says and looks at the objects, not really able to meet his eyes. "For, y'know, all of this."
They hold eye contact for a second before Dean looks away and starts walking to the kitchen. “Want something to eat? I’m starving.” Which is a lie. His stomach is in knots right now. He doesn’t hear Cas respond so Dean gets busy rifling through the cabinets for supplies to make a pie.
“So, Dean,” Castiel asks after Dean’s sat down. “What is it that you wanted to ‘clue me in on?’” Castiel says it with the air quotes and all, and dammit, a crime lord has no right being that adorable.
“Why’re you up? I don’t think it was because of the movie.”
львенок - baby lion
Dean’s smile is knowing, but he simply nods. “When’s your class?”
True to his word, five minutes later, Dean comes sauntering into the club. He has his usual swagger in his posture, but the look in his eyes is steely. He meets Castiel’s gaze and his eyes soften a little, a smirk working at his lips as he makes his way over. Castiel’s vision is a little wobbly, but it’s nothing too bad. He can hear Inias still trying to talk to him, but he doesn’t have it in him to pay attention.
Now Dean just feels stupid.
Castiel's eyes widen as if he had completely forgotten what they had been talking about. "Oh, yes. It's about a five minute walk from here, is that okay?"
Dean sets the last of his papers aside and he and Sam divvy out the food. “You get your paper finished?” Dean asks leaning back into the couch with his container of delicious chinese food, ready for Mishapocalypse to start anytime now.
The doorman sees them approaching and opens the large glass door. His name tag says his name is Ion. Weird name, but so is Balthazar and Castiel. Ion is staring at Dean longer than Dean would like and it's making the hairs on the back of his neck stand. What is with these people and staring? Is there something on him?
"Alright, I'm coming around and I'll check your answers. If you're out, please make your way off the stage and to your respective seats. I will go over the answers out loud after I finish this." Gabriel makes his way around the contestants and checks their answers. These questions were so easy, Dean was sure that not many people were going to be told to leave the stage. Dean wasn't expecting half of the contestants to be out in stage one that's for sure. When Gabriel gets to Dean, the last contestant, there are only about 11 people left, including him.
"Shall we go?" Cas offers a smile and Dean only nods, not trusting his voice to not sound wrecked. They leave the trailer, the blonde winking at Dean as they leave.
Sam furrows his brows confused. Gabriel rolls his eyes at her. "And you never stopped to question that maybe Dean was anything other than straight?"
But Cas hasn't given him a reason to think that he would be angry about it.
Charlie arches a brow and looks at him. "He never told you about it?"
“And now I’m saying you can have it after you take the medicine.”
Surely Cas will want him to make appearances with him in public for the sake of selling their mating. Dean might have to attend parties or some gatherings. Dean doesn’t know, what do mafia bosses do?
"He was very … considerate." Castiel mutters as he shoves some broccoli into his mouth, eyes trained on his plate.
What is he thinking? This isn’t going to be safer for him and his kit. He’s officially lost it. He should grab his duffle and run now. He could sneak out his back window and book it.
?” Sam says, sounding incredulous. “Dean, nothing about that is
"Cassie," Gabriel whines petulantly while ringing up the order, but it doesn’t take long for him to bounce back. "Okay, you know what? This is on the house since you won Luke and I fifty buck-a-roos each.
“What happened?”
Nearing the middle of the panel, Cas stood up and started to walk around. Dean guessed he was starting to get stiff, which is understandable. But then Cas started to walk down the aisle because, Dean didn’t know why, maybe the stage wasn’t cutting it for him, but the whole time he’s walking around the aisle he continues to answer the questions. When Cas gets near the back of the room his eyes scan past Dean, but he pauses for a moment and looks back, making eye contact before smiling a little and continuing. He then looks at Sam with a little nod and turns.
A look of realization crosses Gabriel's face. "Wait, you weren't the one who wanted to meet Jessica? It was for Sam?"
Sam gives a quick sturgeon face before shrugging lightly. "Nothing really, just my friend. She just texted me she's a lesbian."
Sam smiles. "I never said I wasn't a nerd. I'm simply saying you're one too."
“Meg took blood samples when you were in the hospital.” They both remain silent for what feels like hours, Dean still can’t bring himself to meet his eyes. He’s known all this time. Neither of them move either. Cas remains crouched in front of Dean which is a good sign, right? That means he’s not too angry with him, right?
Dean mulls it over, tilting his head to the side and humming. “No,” He puts his hand on Castiel’s knee again. “I think I’ll have some whiskey.” Inias nods, grabbing the glass and bottle of whiskey. He places it on the counter and starts pouring it. “You know,” Dean hums looking at the bartender with, what even Castiel can tell in his drunken state is, false politeness. “You look awfully familiar.”
Sam chuckles and rubs the back of his neck. "Yeah, same goes for you. I had no idea you were going to be an actress. I thought you wanted to study law."
“I’ll call Cas.”
“So,” Dean starts, handing his phone back over. “Your brother is here I take it?”
“Dude,” Dean scoffs, “When I’m 80 I’m gonna be just fine with my ass in a rocking chair on my front porch.”
Dean’s brows raise just slightly and he leans back. Dean’s never had a lot of money before, so he doesn’t know what to do with this new information that he gets access to basically an infinite amount of it. He wouldn’t even know where to begin if he wanted to spend it all, not that he does. Cas probably knows this too, and that’s why he’s not worried about it. Then again, if Dean ever did something to fuck Cas over like that, he has the manpower to track him down and kill him, so there’s that too.
“That’s part of it,” Gabriel hums, sitting on a chair, his golden wings spreading over the back. “How you feelin, Dean-o? Kit okay?”
Matt, Misha’s boss, also Castiel’s real life older brother, Michael, steps out of his office and stares in Misha’s direction. “Misha.”
Surprise chapter! Since I took awhile last time to update, I decided to give you guys an early update to make up for it.I was able to write a large chunk of this chapter while I was getting my hair done. I was genuinely surprised by how productive I had been xD Hope you enjoy!
Dean looks at his brother exasperatedly. “Sammy, I’ve got nothing good to wear.” Dean holds up a sweater. “I can’t believe you ever let me leave the house with this monstrosity on.” Dean throws it on the ground picking up another shirt. “And this looks like it’s been through a war.” Throws it on the ground as well and picks up a bunch of other shirts. “They’re all plaid and band-tees! I can’t wear that on a date!”
Sam thins his lips and looks to Charlie who is giving him another slightly concerned look. Dean might not open up to Cas because Sam is pretty damn sure Dean has and has had for a while now, a crush on the actor. But that also might work in their favor. Because Dean has a crush on him, maybe he'll feel a little more connected and open up? But knowing Dean, probably not. Dean will probably close off about his emotions and not want Castiel to dislike him or think he's too broken and weird.
Dean glances back at Cas who is sitting on a plush bench against the wall. He doesn’t seem perturbed at all about Garth addressing Dean with the questions, which is even more interesting.
Dean and Sam pull up to the set of Mishapocalypse that Saturday, both the brothers very giddy about getting to see the set of their favorite show. Cas had told Dean where to go and where he would be able to park, and thankfully Dean had no trouble finding it with Cas' directions. When Dean puts Baby in park, he grins over at his brother before looking out the rearview mirror to see the giant building that houses the stages.
“You’re gonna need the special, aren’t you.” He says this as a statement more than a question because he already knows the answer. “I don’t know how you do it.” Gabriel shakes his head and takes Dean’s money.
“Yeah, I guess.” Sam shakes his head running a hand through his hair. “Sorry.”
Dean, on the other hand, is thinking the same thing. He wants Cas to want him, but at the same time, he knows it isn't right. He can't be giving Cas sexy eyes because that will make Cas uncomfortable and the fact that Cas probably gets that on a daily occurrence with all his fans makes Dean abruptly stop his eyes from trailing to Cas' lips and stops Dean from licking his lips. It would be nothing new to Cas, to have a fan desire him, but Dean doesn't want to be one of those fans. Cas is here to be his friend. He doesn't need Dean projecting his closeted emotional baggage on him. Cas deserves better than that.
“Cas,” Dean grunts, face scrunching and fingers tightening their hold in his hair, his breathing turning shallow and heavier. Knowing Dean is about to come, he redoubles his efforts. Warm come spurts into his mouth making him choke. He pulls off before Dean’s finished and swallows the come in his mouth before coughing, more come landing on his cheek.
“You're on dish duty,” Cas says, effectively making Gabriel deflate.
“I’m still sorry.” He looks around, and glances out a window and sees tall buildings and he’s reminded that he doesn’t know exactly where he’s at. “Where, uh, are we?” He asks a little unsure and looks back at Dean.
Dean hikes up the bag more, following Benny to the elevator. He pushes the L button and they go up to the lobby. Dean doesn’t like the thought of Benny coming up to Cas’ penthouse and being alone with him. He may be his bodyguard, but Dean doesn’t trust him yet.
Cas gives a sheepish smile holding out the pot for Sam to take, which he does. “I made chicken noodle soup for you both. I feel like it's partially my fault Dean got sick from being in the rain yesterday.”
“Ohhhh, and the plot thickens.” Charlie leans back in. “How was it used?”
Dean grins. “If you read this essay you would be laughing too.” He takes another sip and looks up to Gabriel, but when he sees the other man standing there smiling over at him, Dean chokes on his coffee. He lurches forward coughing sporadically in attempt to be able to breath correctly again. He hears some voices but he can’t focus on them, his mind being bogged with other thoughts. Once his coughing slows he hears a familiar voice, one that he usually only hears on the television.
“Breathe for me, Dean.” Cas keeps his voice low and Dean does as he instructs. “I didn’t want to scare you, I’m sorry,” He sounds genuinely apologetic. Frustration is evident on his face, but Dean doesn’t think it’s being aimed at him. “I am not…” He sighs, his wings shifting behind him, before saying something in Russian, then trying again. “I am not good at being … kind. It was not my intention to upset you.”
Gabriel, taking that as in invite, sits himself in Castiel’s side of the booth, throwing an arm over the back of the booth behind Castiel. This action forces Castiel to scoot further into the booth towards the wall and he loses contact with Dean’s ankle. For a brief moment, something dark flickers across Dean’s eyes. It’s gone before Castiel can really wonder if it was really something, or if it was just the lighting.
After a moment of silence, Dean gently asks, “Where’d you go, Cas?”
Bartholomew scoffs, shaking his head. “Yeah, because that bitch has been a thorn in his side for-” He doesn’t get to finish that sentence because Castiel cuts him off with a solid punch to his gut. The man wheezes, doubling over as much as his restraints allow him.
Cas watches him, a curious glint in his eyes. “I should come.”
, Sam. Now
*****
"Hello, Dean," Castiel greets and steps aside in a motion for him to come in, his wings shifting when he does.
Looks like he was worrying over nothing.
to see you."
She furrows her brows running the conversation over in her head once more before realizing what Sam's saying. "Dean?"
Sam rolls his eyes. "Yes, because I was just dying to see you embarrass yourself in public because you don't do that enough on your own."
"It won't be safe for you to be alone now that we are going to be mates, so you will have two guards. I will introduce you to Benny when we get to the lobby."
"Yes," Cas says a little irritated.
His thoughts freeze for a moment to absorb that information fully. That means he's gonna have to awkwardly avoid him the whole night because there's no way Balthazar is letting Castiel get away from taking him to the club.
“I think I saw my brother today,” Dean finds himself mumbling without thinking about it.
He slowly nods and does his best to follow Dean’s instructions. His hands are warm and help soothe his nerves when they run up and down his sides. When he’s sitting contentedly on his lap, one of Dean’s hands trails up his arm. It cups the back of his neck and pulls him down slowly, keeping their eyes locked. Castiel licks his lips in anticipation and lets his eyes flick to Dean’s plush lips. It makes him squirm in Dean’s lap.
Sam looks between him and his brother and slowly nods. "Okay," It's quiet at first, but then he repeats it louder, a smile tugging at his lips. "Okay, thank you." And he turns, leaving them alone.
Dean drops his eyes to the book in Cas’ hands and arches a brow. “What’re you reading?”
“Gabriel, where are you?”
Sam doesn't say anything immediately and Castiel is momentarily worried he said something wrong. Sam's eyes flick to Dean for a fraction of a second before turning back to Castiel with a smile. "It wasn't a problem. Are you feeling better now, nothing out of the ordinary?"
"You ready to head over?" Dean asks and turns his green eyes back to his brother.
Cas nods. "Yes, back when the show started, but I-" Dean arches a brow at the abrupt stop in his sentence. "I was seeing someone back then so it felt wrong. I asked her to politely stop and she apologized immediately." Cas sees Dean open is mouth then quickly close it looking away. It's obvious Dean is curious, but would feel uncomfortable asking, so Cas makes it easier on him. "The relationship itself didn't last long, if you could even call it a relationship, he … it wasn't a life he wanted and I respected that, so he left."
Dean frowns and looks at the pool of blood. Something feels off, like something went down and he just doesn’t know about it.
I finally finished it! Thank you all for the comments and the kudos! Finals week is coming up so I'm not sure when I'll get the next chapter written, but I'll try to get it done before too long.
He hears the sound of the doors sliding open behind him. A second later, Cas comes up beside him. “May I join you?”
As for Sam and Jess, I wasn't planning on going more in depth with their relationship. I was just planning on talking about it every now and again, but if any of you really want me to add them into the story more and actually have moments from their POV I can do that
“Mud.” Cas reminds him and Sam’s mouth forms into an o shape remembering Dean came home looking like he crawled out of a swamp, and that’s how they find themselves out by Dean’s car cleaning her out for him.
"Dmitri?" Sam finishes his brother's thought and they look at each other wide eyed.
When he walked inside, he must have had a dazed look in his eyes because Michael was relentless in his teasing.
Neither Castiel or Dean know what to say about that. Dean tries to think of something, but he only succeeds in making himself resemble a fish, but luckily neither of them have to say anything before Gabriel speaks up again.
Dean scoffs at him. “I just wanted to give you your birthday present. I know it’s early, but I don’t care.” Dean holds the envelope out to Sam and flaps it a couple times before Sam skeptically takes it.
. Dad fucking left you to die?!” Sam growls and runs a hand through his hair. “I should have come back. I had my suspicions he was-” Sam cuts himself off and looks at Dean with concerned eyes. Sam swallows thickly and runs a hand over his face. “I had suspicions, but you always said it was okay. I trusted you whenever you said it was nothing. Dean, John took you to a cabin in the forest too often to count. What were all of those trips for? Because I know it wasn’t for fishing.”
“It’s fate at first choking.” Castiel and Dean’s eyes both widen at the man and Gabriel shrugs as if it’s no big deal. “For Dean-o and I it was fate at first coffee, I get that feeling, you know?”
Their drinks slide in front of them a moment later, accompanied by a more masculine voice. “Here you two go.”
"Oh," Gabriel smiles. "So you won't mind if I tag along, right?"
*****
I’m pretty excited about posting the next chapter. It’s gonna be a little different than the previous chapters since it’s gonna be in Cas’ POV. I don't usually do multiple POVs in stories, but part of me really wants to write from Cas' perspective so that's what I’m doing. I hope you’ll all like it, and I'll be here bright and early next week!
He must have heard Dean in the background. “Oh, yeah, I’m fine.” Sam walks back into the kitchen to see Dean nursing a glass of water at the table. “Dean is just sick and being stubborn saying he’s fine. Did you need something?”
Dean casts a glance to his brother before looking back to the stage where one of the actresses is talking. "Gabriel just gave me the prize money and then told me where to meet up with Cas after his panel."
Cas narrows his eyes at his brother but stops when Dean looks at the movie and his face lights up. “Whoa, Cas, you’ve got
Closing the door, he unlatches it and opens it again. The man is still standing there, looking as annoyed as before. Well, this guy is a real peach. Dean wants to say as much too, but he bites his tongue. If he wants to accept Castiel on his offer, he has to be the ‘perfect omega.’ That means even in front of the Bratva.
“So get this,” Sam says as the laptop starts up. “I was doing some research,”
Sam gives Dean an are-you-kidding-me look and sets the shirt on the bed. “Dean, I am trying to help.” Dean turns away, eyes scanning the floor, running his hands through his hair and muttering something to himself. Sam thins his lips and nods. “Okay, Dean, you stay here, I’ll be right back.” He quickly turns and leaves, pulling out his phone and calling Charlie’s number. This calls for drastic measures.
"You don't think you would be any good at it?"
He wants to suck him off, but he’s never done it before. Sure Dean knows he’s never done this, but Castiel still wants it to be good for him. What if he’s terrible?
Cas hums, but says nothing again, just letting Dean speak. They stay quiet for a while again before Cas says, “Why haven’t you seen him in a long time?”
"I've gotten their caesar salad before and thought it was pretty good, perhaps he would like that."
He sighs, a small groan escaping his lips. It’s both a mercy and a punishment.
Not putting this here for any reason ... no reason at all ... I just want to leave this here to remind you all that this is still a darker story with a lot of hurt, don't let me fool you because it looks fluffy.
A flash of the man’s face that ruined his life rushes across his mind’s vision and he clenches his jaw. The phantom ache in his leg returns with the memory. The fire, the pain, the screaming, the man that got away with killing his parents, the aftermath, what it all caused Anna to do.
Cas meets Dean's eyes and points to the building in front of them. "This is it."
“Dean-o, it’s been a while, what brings you?” The brunette greets him with a cheerful smile, and putting his hand on his hips.
Castiel licks his lips and dives in, taking it slow. He kisses the base of his cock and licks along the underside all the way to the tip. Above him, Dean hums in approval, his hand gripping his hair more tightly now but not pushing, simply there. A reassurance. Perhaps even saying ‘you’re mine now’ and not letting him go. His own cock pulses at the thought. He closes his eyes and wraps his mouth around the tip, slowly taking in as much as he can.
As the episode continues, it goes between Misha and Adrianne, but mainly focuses on Misha. There was even a moment that had Dean and Sam on edge because Misha and Adrianne accidentally bumped into one another in the street, but that was as far as that encounter went which was frustrating. It had Dean yelling at the tv for her to turn back around because Misha would be able to help her. Nearing the end of the episode is cuts to Adrianne again. She's on the computer typing away and trying to dig up information to find her brother. The screen slowly pans around from her back so they can see her face and it slowly closes in. Her brows knit together and all of a sudden her eyes widen and she mouths 'Oh my god' before she quickly stands, grabs her coat and keys and leaves her motel room. The screen turns back to her computer screen and it shows a picture of Misha, and that's when the screen goes black and the credits roll.
When they pull into the parking garage, Dean is anxious. He’s bouncing his leg and looking around the garage.
Castiel bites his lip, feeling extremely vulnerable. He pulls on a hoodie to fight winter’s chill and opens his window. He slides out and onto the roof of the porch below. Turning, he shuts his window. A bitter wind blows past him and rushes under his shirt. He shivers and tries drying his tears from his face, his fingers are already freezing. He carefully slides down the roof and lands, unceremoniously, in the snow. His fingers scream at him when they get covered in the cold powder.
Dean runs a hand down his face, holding his breath. It’s gonna be alright. He grabs his duffle, not wanting to make Benny wait longer than he needs to and slings it over his shoulder. He gives the apartment one more look over before leaving. Right outside, one of his annoying neighbors, a beta, is smoking on the walkway. He’s leaning on the wrought-iron railing with his elbows. Dean tries walking past him and hopes he’ll just ignore him this time, but he has no such luck.
“Castiel, you don’t have to be here with me if you don’t want to. You know that, right?” Balthazar says it so earnestly that the itch under his skin goes away and he sighs.
Or perhaps ‘came out’ isn’t the right term in Castiel’s words, he said he was never ‘in any closet’ and Gabriel simply assumed what he was.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean moans and bites Castiel’s lip. “That was so fucking hot.” He moves to the side and licks the come from his cheek, making Cas gasp and grab fistfuls of Dean’s shirt.
Cas whirls around, eyes blazing. “No, I want you out of danger.”
? We’ve got to watch it.” Dean turns to Cas with a wide smile. “You good with that?”
A knock sounds from Dean's door followed by his brother's voice. “Dean? You okay?” The door opens and Sam's head peaks into the room, his eyes widening when he sees the mess Dean made. He pushes the door open the rest of the way and steps in, looking at Dean. “What’re you doing?”
Dean arches a brow at Sam's weird behavior, but ignores it and holds up his beer for a second. "Hey, maybe you can introduce her to Charlie." Dean winks at Sam and Sam just rolls his eyes. Dean raises his brows looking innocent. "What, too soon?"
Dean opens his mouth to say something, but Castiel arches a brow. Dean closes his mouth and then chuckles, rubbing the back of his neck. “What can I say? I wanted him to know you were taken.”
What the fuck just happened?
Sam turns back to the laptop and presses play.
Dean throws his hands in the air. "That's my Sammy! I always believed in you."
Castiel nods. “I’m okay.”
"Oh, no way, Dean-o's playing?"
“Okay, class, I finally got your papers graded. I’m going to hand them back so you can see your grade, but I’m going to need them back to put them in the grade book.” Dean grabs the pile of graded papers and starts handing them back. When he starts getting closer to the end of the pile he realizes that there aren’t enough papers for the number of students remaining. His eyes widen realizing he lost some papers. He thins his lips and hands out the remaining papers before speaking up. “I apparently left some of your papers at home, but I promise I’ll get them to you soon.”
A.R.T.s
"Again."
“Shit,” Dean curses under his breath.
“I care!”
Gabriel leans on the table with his elbows looking rather interested. “He gave him a look?”
Dean huffs a shaky laugh. “Of course you already know about that.” What’s the point in having to tell him everything if he already knows everything before he gets the chance.
Dean smirks and crosses his arms over his chest watching Cas look over all the other fans in the crowd, waving here and there. Sam, on the other hand, is, simply put, shook. Not because Cas made eye contact with him and acknowledged his existence, though that was pretty sweet, but because the look that he shared with his brother. It was only there for what seemed like a nanosecond, and if he wasn't looking at Cas with all his attention he never would have seen it, but it was there. What
Dean groans, slowly waking up. He doesn’t want to wake up, it’s warm and comfortable. He shifts a little, trying to bury himself deeper into the bed and go back to sleep, but he frowns. The bed is a little hard. His eyes flutter open and he blinks, trying to get the sleep out of his eyes.
And with that, they keep quiet and clean the rest of the car. The two of them have a few good laughs about what happened yesterday and when it comes time for Cas to leave, he makes his way to tell Dean he’s heading out, but Dean is asleep on his bed. Cas smiles and walks over quietly, leaning down and placing a gentle kiss on his forehead whispering, “Goodbye, Dean.” before leaving.
Before Sam has the chance to say something back, Dean comes striding back over to them with a plate piled high with food, a smile spread across his face as he chews some food.
“I know.”
Michael frowns and rubs the back of his neck. “Cassie,” The nickname stings. He only used that nickname when he was younger and now only uses it when he wants to lessen the blow. “I know you wanted us to get along, but there’s something about Dean that …” he sighs and rubs his face. “It just doesn’t sit right with me.”
Dean groans and decides it's a good idea to clean himself up, so he grabs the pajama bottoms and his underwear and slides them on. He makes sure to be as quiet as he can as he walks down the stairs and into the bathroom. He cleans himself off then glares at himself in the mirror before leaving the room. As he makes his way to the stairs he stops when he sees Cas sitting on the couch reading a book.
"Uh-huh," Dean smirks taking the envelope Gabriel is offering him and looks to. "I'll see you later, Cas."
They all continue to play their game of soccer, the ground slowly becoming a muddy mess. Mud sloshes up onto the hem of their pants and up their legs, the rain plastering their hair to their heads. Dean keeps running a hand through his hair to push it out of his eyes. He runs up beside Cas since he has the ball and he goes to try and take it, but he fails and instead, he starts to fall. Cas notices and tries to catch him, but it only results in both of them falling into a puddle of mud, along with most of the other men around them. Dean’s shoulders start to shake and Cas looks him over worriedly.
“This is delicious,” Dean moans, mouth full.
“A minute ago. Gabriel informed me you got sick so I made you some soup.”
They talk about little things while they finish up their food, laughing when the other one says something funny, both of them trying to commit the other’s laugh to memory. The way Dean throws his head back and belts out a heartwarming laugh when he finds something to be particularly hilarious. The way his eyes crinkle at the sides and his body shakes with laughter. The way Cas will drop his head forward and try to hide his laugh, but he always fails and will shake his head and turn his head towards Dean, eyes crinkled, a wide crooked smile plastered across his face, a playfulness in his eyes that makes Dean’s heart sputter with affection.
Castiel gives a gentle smile and someone calls for Inias to get them a drink. He frowns and looks back at Cas. “I’ll be back.” Then leaves.
He walks inside and reaches out, touching a plant that is reaching out towards the light streaming through one of the many large windows. He wanders around the spacious area to get acquainted while Cas isn’t around. Dean loves the plants. They’re obviously well taken care of. He wonders if Cas is the one who takes care of them or if he has someone else do it for him. Does he have that kind of spare time?
Dean leans forward, resting his head in his hands, eyes closed. This is unbelievable. He can’t stop himself when he starts chuckling, slowly devolving into hysterical laughter.
“Oh, like you’re the definition of maturity.” Dean rolls his eyes and slides into the driver’s seat of his Impala.
Cas's expression lightens up and he cracks a smile. "I'm glad." As they continue to eat, Dean chuckles a little at the whole situation. Cas looks up confused.
Dean expected Cas to start asking questions the second he stepped foot off the elevator. But he didn't. Instead, he's been sitting in the living room with Dean looking like he's about to speak, but keeps backing out. His feathers puff up and smooth out repeatedly, and it’s starting to bother Dean.
"Night, Cas." Dean waves and begins to walk through the dark parking lot. Dean wasn’t sure how this night was going to pan out before, but he sure as hell wasn’t expecting to have such a deep conversation with Cas. Although he can’t really say he’s angry about it, not that he would be angry anyway. Cas seems like such a caring person, no wonder why everyone loves him on and off screen. Also, not to mention, Dean now has Cas' number programmed into his phone, and he couldn't feel more like a schoolgirl that just met her favorite idol.
Cas frowns at the fact that Dean was going to purposely throw the win just so people wouldn't think he's pathetic. Why Dean would think anyone at a Mishapocalypse convention would think someone who loves the show is pathetic is beyond Cas. "Is that why you looked so confused when you got onstage?"
After a second someone else's voice comes through the little machine. "On my way."
Dean bares his fangs, ready to fight. “You think I fucking forgot that? This kit is the only thing I fucking care about.”
Cas casts a glance over his shoulder as if assessing where to go. "They're filming over there, so we can head to set two." He looks back to the brothers. "It's Misha's living room."
Dean startles both men when he claps his hands loudly together. Castiel looks back to see Dean standing behind him. "Alright, how about some dinner? That smells amazing."
Wow, and isn’t that an uncomfortable thought. Moving in with the leader of the Russian Mafia.
Dean stretches out his legs and scribbles his answer.
From his interactions with Castiel this far, he would bet the alpha didn’t react all that much. He seems like a rather stoic guy. Balthazar, on the other hand, apparently isn’t. Dean straightens up and holds Balthazar’s stare, it’s the only thing he can do in defiance. “Are we leaving?” Dean asks.
"Don't 'what?' me, Sammy. I need to know how it went! I've been waiting out here, agonizing over it. Let me hear it."
It made his inner alpha perk up, and he had to bite back the instinct to let out a happy purr. Alphas don’t purr around anyone other than their mates, after all. But that’s not the only reason he held back. He was enraptured by seeing the man under Dean’s mask. The man that took down four alphas and survived. It was only a glimpse of defiance, but it caught Castiel’s eye, and he couldn’t look away.
Dean chuckles. “If you get rewarded so much, doesn’t it lose its luster? It starts to become expected at a certain point. Then when a case comes around that you can’t crack, it would get under your skin and work you up. You wouldn’t be able to focus, right?” Castiel glances at Dean, finding him cutting a piece of chicken and popping it into his mouth with a hum. “This is really good, who cooked it?” He asks with a quick glance around the table.
Castiel nods.
Chapter Title: Under Pressure by Queen
"Normal admissions. Like I said, as much as I would kill to have a better ticket, this day is for Sam. I'm fine with sticking back so he can have more fun."
"God, Cas, we were so worried about you." Michael mumbles into his hair and Castiel hugs him back, feeling guilty.
“You like it?”
"You can't break a habit in a day,
ваше Высочество - your highness
The doors burst open and the women stopping him mid-sentence and causing everyone in the room to spin their attention to the intruder. The blonde women confidently and loudly states, “He is innocent.”
Dean meets his angry eyes and realization hits him. “You still like her.”
Dean goes to grab the soup bowl but Cas swats his hand away. Dean looks up at him surprised and slightly confused. “You said I could have it if I went to my room.”
"No, love, he paid us 20 each," Balthazar smirks.
Jess?”
· 35 minutes ago
Cas stands, his wings fluffing before smoothing over, and he straightens his suit. “Thank you, Garth.” Cas hands him his card.
“I hope so,” Cas says turning to Sam. “Did Dean happen to clean out his car last night?”
Castiel’s cheeks burn, but Dean pays him no attention. Instead, he murmurs praises into Castiel’s skin, sucking marks on his neck as if to stake a claim. Typically Castiel wouldn’t allow this with someone else in the house, let alone in such close proximity that Sam is currently, but Dean’s talented mouth is making his thoughts flutter out of his head. He even tilts his head further to the side and allows him more access, encouraging him to continue.
"Please leave Dean alone. The farthest I would like our relationship to go is friendship."
Dean remains silent. He’s done enough sharing and caring for one day. Besides, talking about it isn’t going to change it now.
"Yes, yes, complain about it later. So, when are you going to talk to him?"
Dean glares at him. "Oh shut up, Gabriel. I was forced into this."
*****
“Oh my Zeus, you totally did!” She slaps her desk.
Castiel holds out his hand for the folder Balthazar is holding, and the beta hands it over. Once he has it, he turns from Balthazar and goes into the room, closing the door behind him and leaving the beta in the hall alone to call Inias. Inias may mainly be monitoring the elevator, but he’s one of Castiel’s best men and an old friend. He’s very good at stealth, and Castiel thinks the alpha will appreciate getting out on a job again.
Cas continues to stare at him for a moment before the corner of his lips quirk up slightly in a small smile. “I think I like that name.”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dean.” Garth looks between them before saying, “What can I do for you fellows?”
“Follow me, I can lend you some clothes if you'd like.”
"Sam…" She gasps and her eyes widen. "Oh my god, Sam?"
There's a buzzing sound that starts coming from Castiel. Both men frown and Castiel looks down, pulling his phone from his pocket. His brows furrow when he opens the message, and he only looks more displeased as he reads it. Something must have happened. That would be his que to leave, right? He needs to get his things from his place to move in here.
Sam turns his eyes to his brother's green ones and sees the honesty in his words. He really believes Sam can do this. That makes one of them at least. It may seem silly to some people that he's getting so nervous, but this is absolutely terrifying to him. What if she doesn't like who he's become?
It isn’t long after Dean pulls him closer and into his lap that the front door opens. Castiel gasps and breaks away from kissing Dean, and he would have thrown himself off him as well if it weren’t for his firm grip on his hips.
After they get their food they make their way over to a bench in the park right next to the truck and sit down. Dean bites into it and hums in appreciation then looks expectantly over at Cas as he bites into his own. Cas closes his eyes and savors the flavor, and when he opens them again he sees Dean staring at him.
Sam is giving a deadly glare right back. "You are not going to go traumatize that kid because you're jealous. Cas is handling it. Let it go." Sam points to the scene and Dean happily looks back. Cas is shaking his head, looking incredibly awkward. The man frowns but smiles soon after and says something. He winks at Cas before leaving with a wave.
Dean can't help himself. That smiley face Cas sent….
Sam shrugs settling back. “It was your idea, I stopped questioning your thinking a long time ago. You mentioned wanting to help the kids.”
Dean glares at him. “I’m not gonna jip you of your food and not give you some in return. It’s only fair.” Cas looks genuinely pleased about Dean giving him food. Dean doesn’t really understand, but hey, if it makes him smile like that, he’ll do it more often.
“Yes, thank you for letting me use your shower,” Castiel says and makes his way over to him, but he doesn’t sit beside him. Instead, he places a knee beside Dean’s thigh and straddles him. His hands cup the sides of Dean’s neck, his fingers threading through the hair at the base of his head.
“Thank you, Dean.”
The scene fades back to Adrianne and her friend again.
This story was almost put on an indefinite hiatus... Little story time!
“How do you think, kiddo? Sam texted me asking if I knew where you two got off to when Dean didn't come back that night. Castiel, he texted me at three in the morning.
Castiel reaches under the table and puts his hand over Dean’s on his knee while he watches Michael. His brother is observing Dean with an impassive stare. When Dean turns his eyes to Michael, his brother doesn’t look away immediately. Only after a few seconds, does he look away. Things begin taking on a more light-hearted nature after that. Castiel will have to remember to thank Gabriel later.
The green duffle bag sits on his bed, full of his possessions, and Dean stares at it. A single duffle bag. Does he really only have this much stuff? It’s pathetic. There are only a very minor selection of clothes, a pair of boots, his leather jacket, his bike helmet, his scent neutralizer, the scratchy collar he uses in panic situations, a few smaller things, and a couple of books he likes to read.
Dean shrugs looking away. "It's not that I don't think I would be good, I'm great at acting when it comes to lying about things." He almost sheepishly meets focused blue eyes. "I probably shouldn't say that like it's something to be proud of, but it's true. The reason why I don't want to try acting though, I don't want to expose Sam." Cas' features soften in complete understanding. "If I tried it, and I got famous, people would try and learn everything about me, and there are some things I'd rather not have dug up about me. Although I couldn't care less about me and my privacy; my main concern is them finding Sam and taking away his privacy."
Sam presses his lips into a thin line and sighs. "Because it's about Dean."
"Will you at least tell me his name?" Gabriel's petulance is seeping into his tone as he cashes Castiel out and althea Batista begins his order. "It isn't fair that Mikey is the only one who knows it."
While walking to the little restaurant — if you can call it that; it's more of a healthier fast food restaurant — Dean and Cas talked casually with one another about mundane things, work, laundry, cooking, everyday life things. In this conversation, Dean learns something that he doesn't know why he never thought of as plausible before. Actors are just like everyone else, and if Dean were being honest it makes him like Cas even more because of it. It makes him think that maybe, just maybe Cas isn't outside Dean's reach.
Chapter Title: Taking care of business by Bachman Turner Overdrive
(See the end of the chapter for
Meg puts the cool gel on his stomach then moves the wand around. “There’s your kit,” She says.
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen."
Dean thins his lips giving Cas a once over. "You sure? You had me worried for a second."
Castiel nods. "I am, but I'm going to stop somewhere to get something to eat first. I haven't been able to eat for a while."
Cas is quiet for a moment before speaking up again. “And?”
As if on queue, Dean’s stomach growls. “I could eat.” Cas smiles and takes the tray of food and walks over to the bed, gently placing it on Dean’s lap. “Is Meg okay?” Dean asks, moving his IV so it wouldn’t catch.
Gabriel looks at her for a second. "I didn't mean it disrespectfully, I'm just trying to get the picture here."
“Wait! Okay!” Castiel drops the man’s head and Bartholomew spits blood on the floor. “She will get out of the country safely if I help you?”
Cas has tried multiple times to bring up his past relationships, but each time it catches in his throat, and if Dean has noticed him trying to say something, then never saying it, he doesn't say anything, which Cas is again thankful for. He isn't used to this and he doesn't know how to go about it. It doesn't feel natural and he feels as if it isn't something that he can casually bring up out of the blue, so instead, he keeps quiet and waits for the opportunity to present itself.
Soon after they hang up, Sam finally kicks Dean up the steps to his room. When Dean is in bed he tells him, “Stay, sleep.” and it makes him feel like he’s talking to an unruly dog. Dean stays up in his room for at least an hour before making his way back down the stairs, earning an annoyed, “Dean,” from his brother in the living room. In which Dean responded with a petulant, “I can't sleep, Sammy, let me do something, I'm going mad here.”
Cas is quiet and the wind shifts, making his cigarette smoke blow towards Dean. Cas backs up and moves to the other side of Dean, taking another pull from his cigarette. “You think?”
"Dude, how did you remember that? I could only remember half of it." Is the first thing Sam says to his brother.
Acting on instinct, Dean snaps a glare at him, immediately on the offensive, pulling away from Cas’ hand on his cheek. The only time he was asked that before was when John made him get rid of his kit. He won’t do that again. It can’t be good for a mob boss to have their omega pregnant with someone else’s kid. Is he planning on how to fix the problem? Cas will have to kill him before he lets him do anything to his kit.
There’s a problem with that.
Only when Dean takes a couple sips of his coffee does he realize Sam doesn’t usually wake up before him. He arches a brow, eyes falling on the microwave clock reading 7:20, then he looks to his brother. “Why are you up this early? Your classes don’t start until nine.”
Cas looks over to where Dean had been staring and sees some men playing an aggressive game of soccer. Part of him starts to get excited, but the other half of him knows how bad he is at sports. He bites at bottom lip hesitantly saying, “I’m not very good at soccer,”
“That kid, did he spread rumors about you?”
Sam nods. "This is everything I know," Sam explains everything he's picked up from Dean and how he thinks his brother might be into Cas. He tells her that he tried to drop hints that it's okay to come out, but Dean didn't seem to pick up what Sam was putting down. That's when he texted Charlie, not wanting to keep failing and drag this out longer than needed.
Before he can decide, Balthazar messages him again.
Dean lights up like a lighthouse and looks over to Cas. “Really?”
Michael's fork stops halfway to his mouth before he lowers it again. There's a look akin to shock on his face as he stares at Castiel. "You met someone … that you're interested in romantically?" Michael's words are slow and measured, as if trying not to spook him.
Okay, now Dean is completely lost. Who the heck is Jess? “I was starting to think you froze like that and I was going to have a statue as a brother.” Dean sighs leaning back on the couch. “Who’s Jess, some girl in your class or something?”
“Dinner is in the microwave.” Castiel calls back before dropping his gaze back to his work. He bites the inside of his bottom lip and looks at his watch. He’s supposed to leave to take Balthazar to Angeles’ in a half an hour. He needs to get ready.
Dean looks to his brother still contentedly chewing. “Free food, Sammy. My stomach knows no bounds.”
The smirk Dean sends his way, accompanied by a wink, sends Castiel’s stomach tumbling. “Oh, I know I could keep up with you, sweetheart.”
Images flash in his mind. Dark, flashes of lightning, pain. So much pain. The metal collar that was pushed into the back of his neck at the pressure point. The memory is so vivid that Dean feels like he can still taste the blood that was in his mouth.
No. No, he doesn’t want to do this anymore. He doesn’t want to go back.
Dean thinks.
After a second Dean hears Sam shuffling around upstairs, soon followed by the opening and closing of his door and the patting of socked feet on the stairs. Sam appears from behind the wall looking a little nervous and confused. “What is it?”
Cas didn’t wait too long after their little escapade before inviting Sam and Dean over for dinner. He told them Gabriel is holding a small dinner party at Cas’ house.
“Sammy, if you’re not going to help then you need to leave.”
"Of course. Goodbye, Dean."
She thins her lips and looks around at her options. “If you simply can't decide, I'm going to pick an outfit and if Sam thinks it's good then you don't get to change.” Dean looks like he's about to argue, but Charlie narrows her eyes at him and he shuts his mouth. She smiles and nods. “Good, now let's see what you've got.”
"Sorry," Dean mutters embarrassed.
Meg’s words echo in his mind.
Every chapter will have the song title and artist for those who are interested. Lyrics of the songs don’t necessarily have anything to do with content!
“How do we not have any umbrellas, Dean?” Sam asks accusingly.
This is a pretty short chapter, but if I kept everything I wrote in this chapter it would have been too long, sorry! But we get some Meg and Dean interaction in this chapter. I wanna know what you all think of Meg. Thanks for reading and continuing your support, it means a lot!!
“What was that about, Sam?” Dean eyes him warily.
Sam nods and Dean grabs his things for the day and leaves the room, ready for some food in his stomach. When Dean gets out of the elevator and to the buffet, he grabs a plate and fills it with enough food to last him until lunch. He sets his plate on a table, along with his bag with their stuff in it, and goes back to get a cup of coffee. Just as he sits down and is about to start eating, he hears a voice that he wasn't expecting to hear.
"You found me", he mumbles, "I've been looking for you."
says The Shadow, and Meg had called them that once, they think, and they had agreed, deep inside, though they would rather have died than admit—
Cas is still
Jack looks up, his hands muddy with clay.
Jack brightens a little.
He leans back, withdrawing his hand.
Dean's smile against his cheek feels playful, teasing, and Castiel slides a hand under Dean's shirt, against the small of his back and another up his thigh, grips his hip and pulls him closer and is rewarded by Dean's hitched breath, and darkening eyes.
Castiel says, turning toward the presence by their side,
would not be the thing he let himself believe,
him with the knowledge that Jack can
When it was all over, he had waited.
"Cas", says Dean Winchester, after a moment,  "This is a surprise."
"Busy", he repeats, in a flat tone. "You had the time to hang out with every fucking joe smith from here to fuck, I don't even know where this place ends, but everyone I run into is like, oh Castiel said this, Castiel said that, Castiel likes roses, Castiel's great with dogs yada yada the sun shines from your angelic ass—and you couldn't bother to drop in until last week, and you only did
Castiel folds themselves into a shape that Dean knows, that Dean can hold on to.
Jack jumps to his feet and even stamps the ground under him a little, raising a small swirl of amethyst coloured mineral dust.
“Yes”, she says, “Yes it did— and it does”.
"Nobody's
"Aren't you going to answer Sam?" he asks in an accusatory tone.
"He's got the personality of a very precocious teenager, yes," Castiel replies, and Dean's laughing, and Castiel pulls him in to swallow the laughter in a kiss they've waited several lifetimes for.
says a different voice, a familiar—
Dean finally meets thier-human-eyes, gives a small shrug.
"Not quite," Castiel says, suddenly, inexpressibly amused, because it's Dean, dear, lovely, profane.  "It's just me."
be—you should live out the rest of eternity in happiness and freedom. How we started—we neither of us had a choice, I know, but now—
And Castiel finds themselves nodding, and Dean says, "Yeah Sammy, show us how to burn mac and cheese" and they're off again, and it's alright, Castiel finds, it's familiar and warm, and almost,
. You're—" Castiel stumbles, because words aren't
Castiel had been born with their name woven into the fibre of their Grace, and then Dean Winchester had rechristened them, and Castiel had been born again, in a baptism of love and fire and helpless, burning desire.
Do you, wonders Castiel,
"I know", Cas says. "But I would do it again, Dean, if it meant I saved you. I would do it
"You’re sweet", says Cas, suddenly. "Sweeter than all the honey in the world".
There is-a woman??-bending over a row of saplings. From where Castiel is standing, they see that she is wearing a simple long garment, with loose, short sleeves, belted at the waist with some rope. Her hair falls in thick dark braids down her back. She’s the one humming.
," Jack says, "Better than, actually, both of them. Still saving people, hunting things. The family business. You know."
Dean's entire being is a riot of emotions, too tangled and messy for Castiel to understand what Dean
They watch Dean tuck enthusiastically into a slice of pie, and then the scramble where Sam slaps pie onto Dean's face, laughing. Dean pretends to be angry, but Castiel can tell, Castiel who has known Dean's soul, held it in their hands, carefully, reverently— Dean's happy.
Then they get topside, and he wishes it had only been a dream, and not one more thing he'd have to forget.
Mary laughs.
, and didn't seem to mind when Dean called him
Castiel obliges.
says, looking embarrassed,
"Yeah?" he asks, sounding shaky.
But that's fine, that's a-ok, because
"Peanut butter?"
"I'm here", Cas whispers, "Dean. Rest now."
They're in sector two of The Enterprise, as Jack has happily started referring to Heaven 3.0, having speed-watched or perhaps speed-absorbed, Castiel isn't clear which, all the versions of the Star Trek franchise that exist across multiple universes.
And yet, Castiel does not feel weary. Instead, they feel their Grace surge,
, I don't even know how long it's been—"
Sam nods, once, lips quirking a little.
“There was..the door just appeared..I..”, Castiel stumbles.
Castiel startles, feeling
Acceptance begins to feel like cowardice when life is long.
Something rustles in the grass near him: a tiny grass snake, slim and green.
, he prays,
Unlike Sam, Dean doesn't move toward him, only nods, and says, "Good to see you, Cas", gruffly, and not meeting Castiel's eyes.
"Cas", Dean, sighing, as he turns to nuzzle the skin beneath Cas' ear, placing a small kiss there, as he presses closer. "Let's never talk about this again, ok?"
Castiel follows, two steps behind.
But it gives him a beady eyed look and slithers over his outstretched palm and then away, unbothered, leaving behind a fleeting sense of dry leather.
, but his mother had not been innocent in all of this, had she, she had sold Sammy to the Devil, and Castiel had laid a hand on his shoulder (but had not touched his mark, why hadn't—) and had looked at Dean with something like
And fuck, like this, Dean can see that Cas is just skin and bone, pale skin stretched over prominent ribs, hip bones jutting out—
Jack groans and falls dramatically to the ground, causing an entire new crater to be formed on the pristine planet.
This might actually be a great time to talk to Dean about what Gabriel had asked of him. Thinking about bringing that topic up, though, starts a storm of the butterflies in Cas' stomach. He absolutely hates lying, and he hates it even more because it's to Dean. If Dean finds out about him lying and going behind his back, will he not want to be his friend any longer? Cas relationship with Dean could be put on the line seeing it isn't as sturdy as Gabriel, Charlie, and Sam's are with him. They only just met, and where the others are used to pulling stunts like this on Dean, Cas might not be able to get away with it.
“I don’t think we can be brothers anymore. I have never been more disappointed in you in my life.” He opens the doors to the Impala and slides in, placing his bag on the passenger’s side before closing the door, then under his breath says, “Practically the same thing.”
He orders a Mojito this time.
Dean’s eyes snap wide staring into his green eyes. “Heart throb Jess? The girl you were head over heels for?
Dean glances around, trying to get a feel for the place. That’s when the worker comes out from the back. He, as well, is nothing like Dean expected. He's shorter than Dean and he looks rather gangly and awkward. He's wearing a suit, but it looks like it looks like it needs to shrink a little to be a good fit. If he was the one who made that suit, Dean fears for what his collar is going to turn out to look like.
I want to thank everyone who has been reading, leaving kudos, and bookmarking this story, and a huge thanks for those who have taken the time to comment! It means a lot!
Shit, so all those omegas at the club Cas owns were under his protection? He doesn’t know why he’s surprised. Cas cares about the people in his protection. Sure, they probably pay Cas for his protection, but Cas goes an extra mile to extend that to make sure others know not to mess with them.
His eyes still locked on Dean, he asks, "Did you talk to Cas?" Sam says this a little quieter than probably necessary, but it's better safe than sorry.
“I'm fine,” Dean argues.
He’s right, there’s nothing he needs to be embarrassed about with just them here. He should love the attention his alpha is willing to give him. And he does, really does. But he’s just admitted to falling for Cas today. He’s going to need time to get used to allowing himself to be pampered like this. This is the kind of attention omegas only dream of. But, it’s Cas’ culture, so he should do it, right?
Sam finishes his first cup and pours another before answering Dean’s question, deeming it too tasking to even try and hold a conversation until he has had at least one full cup of coffee. “I have to go in early today for a mock trial. I’m one of the lead lawyers in the case, so I want to make sure I have everything ready before I go.”
Castiel frowns a little, not liking this at all. If Dean finds out that he is doing this behind his back, it could hurt their friendship pretty bad, and they just met. All he can do now is explain to Dean when he finds out because yes, Dean will most likely find out sooner or later. Castiel would tell Dean what they are doing, but from what Sam said, Dean is delicate about things like this and it could push him back.
“Yeah, I, uh…” Holy shit his voice is so … no, he’s not going to finish that thought. He slowly sits up rubbing his throat trying to get all the inappropriate thoughts from his head because he isn’t supposed to think of a man like that. His father has made that clear to him at a young age. He looks up and meets a pair of captivatingly blue eyes, all thoughts wiped from his mind. “Whoa…” Castiel furrows his brows a bit and tilts his head to the side waiting to see if he’s alright. Dean’s voice is almost a whisper as he says, “Your eyes are beautiful.”
Charlie has hearts in her eyes when he looks back up. “Aww! You two are OTP material.”
"That him?" Meg asks, trying to sneak a peek at his phone.
Cas sighs, his wings stiffening against his back. “Nobody goes to the great lengths you did to avoid somebody finding out they have a cold.” Cas’ eyes are narrowed now and Dean starts to feel unsettled. “I haven’t lied to you once, Dean, I would appreciate the same courtesy. I do not believe you are telling me the truth about the clinic. In fact, I know for certain you aren’t.”
“So, Dean, you going to the convention next week?”
Dean sighs and rubs his face. “I’m just … confused.” Dean licks his lips, shifting on his feet. The city is bustling with people down below them. Sam is out there. “He was in California the last time I knew. He was in school. Stanford.” Dean stares down at his hands. “Wanted to be some hotshot lawyer.”
Dean is smiling at him broadly, then narrows his eyes, still smiling. “You’re not secretly a serial killer, are you?”
“Are you alright?”
Realizing his thoughts, Dean quickly corrects himself and gives a smile, that hopefully doesn't look as stupid as it feels, and a small nod of his head.
“Oh, ew,” Sam’s face scrunches and he groans, closing the door. “You guys, on our couch, really, Dean?”
“Do you have to do that while I’m in the car?” Sam groans.
Her hands grabbing her mug tightly getting upset thinking about what Dean had probably been through. "Has he ever thought about therapy? Having someone unbiased to talk to?"
He worries his bottom lip between his teeth trying to see if, by some miracle, the papers are just laying around anywhere, but of course they wouldn’t just be laying around on the floor. What is he going to do if he can’t get them back? He is supposed to be the responsible adult here! But no, of course he isn’t. The moment Castiel shows up Dean was head over heels… no, wrong choice of words. That would indicate he has feeling for the man, which he doesn’t. Instead, Dean was … distracted and he foolishly lost the damn papers. Stupid, stupid, stupid!
Dean gives him an incredulous look. "Well, it looked as if your skin was getting pale and the look in your eyes made it seem like you just got war flashbacks." Dean pauses for a moment to gauge Cas' reaction, but when Cas only looks confused, Dean continues. "You sure you're good? If it has to do with Sam leaving and possibly getting you into trouble I'll go hunt him down."
' Sam looks back up and Dean winks at him. Sam scoffs. "Okay, you play a girl too well."
Other than him being a mob boss, that is.
Dean took to resting his hand on Castiel’s knee on the ride over and it’s nice having a point of contact between them since Castiel didn’t want to stop touching him either. It’s nice to know Dean didn’t want to, either. But now they’re at their destination, which means Castiel needs to get out and go to class. Sighing, Castiel opens his door, unable to think of any reason to stay longer.
Castiel's eyes narrow at his brother in slight agitation. "You have already made me invade his privacy by telling me he's sexually confused."
A huge thank you to everyone who has been reading and leaving feedback!
"Hopefully you all know your missions because if not then this next question is gonna be rough." Gabriel reads over the question once more. "What episode was Misha's first
Dean glances back at the thick book before setting it down. "I was actually thinking that I should probably learn Russian."
Sam looks as if he was just handed a rather difficult calculus equation and told to solve it without a calculator, his brows knit together, eyes narrowed, lips pressed close together. Dean wants to say something but he doesn’t want to interrupt his thought process. Is he thinking about Mishapocalypse?
“Of course.” Cas kisses him again before backing up. “The offer is always open.”
“Okay,” Dean says when he meets Garth’s eyes.
“You think?”
That’s amazing. He smiles and puts some more on the bar. He turns when he hears noise behind him, and Cas’ scent gets stronger. The alpha is standing at the entrance of the kitchen, staring at Dean with furrowed brows, eyeing the ketchup-covered kit kat. Dean pops it in his mouth and Cas scrunches up his face.
“Professionally? Ever since I was seventeen.”
Castiel rolls his eyes looking away from his brother. “Sometimes you aggravate me, Gabriel.”
Alas, all good things come to an end. That's a motto Dean has come to live by.
“Look, I’m sorry. I’m just frustrated right now. I can’t find a damn thing on the ring leader, Alistair is a slippery fucker, and now I’m learning I let you get tortured for years.”
Dean’s hand cards up through Castiel’s hair and cups the back of his head, pulling him in. Their lips brush together softly before Dean is pulling back, offering a gentle smile. “You’re always welcome to my place.” His thumb runs along the stubble on Castiel’s jaw, green eyes flickering to his lips and back up. “I just don’t want you making any decisions you’ll regret in the morning.”
“Don’t you dare, Winchester!” He lunges at her and she runs to the door. “Good luck, Sam. Bye, Dean!” She quickly runs out the door before Dean can catch her in his muddy grasp. Dean starts to laugh and he turns to Sam who’s shaking his head with a smile. That’s when Dean sneezes.
“In that case,” Dean smiles at him gently, “come here and let me take care of you.”
“Do we get to meet the actors if we buy the tickets?”
Castiel's eyes widen for a spilt second before he goes back to normal. "I know of a good place that sell salads and burgers. I was heading there myself, it is on the way to my hotel, if you would like to join me."
