The plan was sounding more convincing the longer Sherlock spoke, even though he knew, in some strange back-to-front way, that it had already happened.
Then a fifth figure; striding forward at the last second and slipping through the closing doors. He fits himself amid them all, a long, skinny frame and a dark dramatic coat.
As he finishes speaking the door bursts open behind him, releasing half a dozen men into the room, guns raised, movements direct and efficient, executed with military precision.
“Oh but I haven’t asked!” She continues and John wonders if she can read minds. “You’re not married?”
“Were you worried I wasn’t going to agree with you?” John asks, scanning Sherlock’s face, “About retiring?”
The memories. The words and the dissections and the explanations and the connections. Text careful, structured; lines following ordered steps of logic, before wild ideas, scribbled haphazardly in margins and pushed up against other text. Perhaps he fell asleep and dreamt of that voice. Saying his name.
“Excuse me?” He asked on finally finding what he hoped was the right desk. The woman behind it gave him a full up and down, her eyes falling unerringly to his cane. She handed him a form:
John has produced a pen light from the top pocket of his scrubs; he flashes it quickly in the patient’s eyes.
Turning into the room ahead of them Sherlock could see the body of a woman on the ground. A thousand deductions immediately reared up; connections and details, things he was sure most of the room wouldn’t have noticed. As he studied her he could see all the pertinent details of her entire life story, written as clearly as if she had dictated him her autobiography. But no card.
The man nods his thanks, whirling his long coat around him as he turns briskly and follows the path John has indicated.
“Me too,” He offered in reply, watching as she unwound the many layers necessary for venturing outside in a London February. “It’s good to see you,”
“Oh, I’ll be fine dear. I’m on the ground floor…” She starts and John is pretty sure would continue if the door didn’t suddenly open before her, revealing a tall energetic figure in a long coat and blue scarf.
“Yeah, I know,” The man claiming to be Stamford gestures to himself with a sheepish grin, “I got fat.”
“Ah,” Moriarty was the one to break it, still not looking up, “Here we are at last. You and me, Sherlock, and our problem,”
“Nothing much, these things are always the same…” She said distracted, spotting someone she knew across the room and waving to them.
He was standing in the middle of the pavement on Baker Street, almost exactly a week after he’d stood there reading previously. As before, his stomach was nicely full of the tea and cake provided by Mrs Hudson and as before, he’d found a note in the pigeonhole.
“I-I’m sorry?” Mike stammered out finally, “How well do you know him?” He asked, perfectly reasonably.
“Thank you.” John repeats. “I’m not really sure what you’re talking about, or who you are, or what I’m doing here. But, thank you.”
yours, being that it sits directly above the seat you have chosen: your haircut, the way your hold yourself, even when seated, says military.”
an assistant” John hears him say, though Sherlock has turned his back. He’s gone very still. “Not in a police car.” He says finally. “Don’t send one. I’ll be right there.”
Sherlock steps forward slowly, eyes no longer resting on John’s face but instead on the extended hand. Two paces means he’s close enough to take it, tentatively lacing their fingers together. Then Sherlock sits down in front of him. On the coffee table.
“Harry Watson: clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man’s gadget. Could be a cousin, but you’re a war hero subsisting purely on an army pension in London. Unlikely you’ve got an extended family, certainly not one you’re close to, so brother it is. Now, Clara. Who’s Clara? Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him recently – the model’s only six month’s old. Marriage in trouble then – six months on he’s just given it away. If she’d left him, he would have kept it. People do – sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you: that says he wants you to stay in touch. But you’re not going to your brother for help: that says you’ve got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife: maybe you don’t like his drinking.”
“Come on then,” Lestrade said with resignation, “I get your point. I’ll come with you; I can fill you in on the details in the car.” He rose.
No doubt she’ll leave her bags and head straight upstairs to tell him she’s back. He glances around the room, suddenly aware of the state if it. Perhaps he should tidy before she sees. The books and the papers and the notes. His laptop left haphazardly half open amongst it all, as if he will ever really begin to start committing these words to keyboard. He sets his mug down in the only available three inch square of space on the table top, finding his way to his feet. He can hear her steps on the stairs. Climbing slowly. Perhaps she’s carrying something. It sounds heavy. He casts around again, but feels unsure where to start. He can’t tidy untold weeks of hermit-living in seconds. Perhaps he can clear some of these plates. Jesus, he really has let the place go. Memories don’t mind mess.
John lets out a laugh. Partly out of surprise, partly out of fear, but mainly because of his sheer good luck. “Really?” He asks,
He had told her about the hospital and his new flat and his tentative new friend and she had remarked with delight and told him of the goings on in the street: the new tenants three doors down and the married ones next door, and the way the price of a cup of coffee in Speedy’s just kept going up.
“Dear Jim.” Moriarty’s voice had gone high and sing-song: “Please will you fix it for me to get rid of my nasty landlady…”
“We need to speak with Lucy Shields, she wrote the headline piece in the paper today?” Lestrade asked the receptionist.
“Oh Sherlock, are all these yours?” She asked, stepping back and running her eyes over the boxes currently blocking the Baker Street pavement,
Sherlock hummed a response, holding his gaze for as long as he could before John became uncomfortable and looked away.
“Not my blood.” Sherlock’s voice is impassive; tired with standing still he has begun to pace, slowly backward and forward. Not coming any closer, not retreating. Three steps toward the window, three steps away.
“…the main considerations really must be maintaining the highest standards of hygiene.” The consultant was telling John in a manner that resembled more a lecture than a conversation, John was nodding along. “If there are not…” The consultant continued.
“I…” He started to say but halted as she stepped out into the hallway beside him and pulled her door closed behind her. “You’re off out?” He asked instead, deflecting.
The moment Sherlock had read the message his face raised to Lestrade. For a beat everything was still, their eyes locked.
“The things he gets up to,” She continues before John gets chance to ask who Sherlock is, “And the hours he keeps. He knows I’m not his housekeeper, but sometimes I just can’t help myself. He needs a bit of looking after.”
It’s early in the morning. John finds himself adrift amid the tide of passengers pouring along the platform at Kings Cross. A cross-section of the London population: every shape and age and size, they insert themselves messily into the neat chair-sized spaces on the awaiting carriages.
“Anything from the trolley for you Sir?” She asks brightly above them and for a second John is unsure who to answer first.
“I wondered…” It was Mary from earlier, here to save him, “Would you be able to…?” She started to ask, motioning over her shoulder back the way she had come. John didn’t allow her to finish,
“Yes, and the previous two occasions have been interesting,” Sherlock, bored with the preamble, carried on past him toward the building,
“Before you, I thought that being alone would protect me.” He said, dropping his voice to something more intimate, “I thought other people were unnecessary, that I was stronger without them. I was wrong.”
John comes back to the present. Sherlock staring at him. He realises that his anger has ebbed with the memory.
Was this a date? John asked himself. Of course it was. He was on a date. With a man. A man from the future.
“Afghanistan,” John confirms. Looking away again, this time toward the window and the evening sunlight.
“Okay Sherlock,” He said out loud, feeling more than a little foolish. But he pushed it aside and stood, dutifully going back to the words on the page and setting off in the direction it dictated, the spectre of his tour-guide walking along with him.
The weight of them lift all at once from John’s shoulders, no longer crowding the cell with them; an elephant in a tiny room. The barrier of cold tile feels like no space at all, easy to cross, the work of a second for John to raise a hand and lay it along the side of Sherlock’s cheek.
And Sherlock comes alive again – pressing forward. Ducking down. Capturing John’s lips with renewed vigour and twisting until they are laying full length on the sofa. Limbs tangled. Mouths joined. Hands and fingers and tongues. Bodies pressed close, hips beginning to grind. The upsurge of desire and stuttered breaths and catching teeth making John’s head spin.
“What’s happening?” John asks again, panic threatening, he looks to Sherlock: “You tell me I should know you, but I don’t.”
Lestrade was out of the car the moment it had pulled to a stop, already fumbling in his pocket for his badge.
“He killed himself.” Sherlock answers the question John hadn’t been able to answer. Hadn’t known he was going to ask. “He made it necessary.”
“When was the last time?” She asked, carefully looking both ways before crossing the street in front of the hospital.
In retrospect it’s really quite obvious that when the door swings open the figure it reveals isn’t Mrs Hudson.
John sighs and looks away again. He expects the pacing to resume but instead the click of Sherlock’s shoes approaches him across the room, followed by the creak of the bench as Sherlock settles beside him.
It had been that day that had spurred him to go back to Baker Street, seeking the comfort of someone he knew and finding instead the comfort of someone he didn’t: in the form of a letter.
John had immediately rushed to her aide. Helping her scoop things back into the bags hastily provided in replacement and then, because seemingly this is the sort of man he is, he’d asked if she needed any help carrying them.
“No.” John took another swig, “Here… I guess it feels a little like everything is gradually passing me by. Everyone seems so happy with their lots: little jobs, little lives, little families, little friends. I can’t understand it. I mean imagine! A pretty house in the ‘burbs with 2.4 kids and a wife who works in finance!” John barked a laugh, “I couldn’t do it. Honestly. I don’t know what I’d do if they decided they didn’t want me out there anymore.” A pause, “Go quietly insane probably.”
“I don’t know…” Moriarty put a finger to his lips, then wagged it between them: “Consulting detective, consulting criminal… Two sides of the same coin.” He stalked forward. “We’re both so much
And now pressed against an unfamiliar doorway John can’t help but recognize that Sherlock kisses as he
He dropped a flimsy folder unceremoniously onto the table beside Sherlock’s untouched breakfast. Sherlock locked his gaze onto it.
“I’m sorry, what?” John asks as he turns back, finding the man is looking at the computer rather than at him.
“Mycroft?” John has to pause, that can’t have been an easy thing for Sherlock to admit. “What did he say to them?”
The sitting room was startlingly empty as he pushed open the door. John had to stand for a long time to get used to the feeling of absence in the room.
John has opened his mouth to inform her that he isn’t actually that way inclined, but he quickly realises that this bit of information probably wouldn’t change anything.
Back to the story: for any of you that know the film you’ll know that most of the events in this chapter are lifted almost directly from the film, with a Sherlock spin to them obviously. For the time being I’m sticking very close to the film, so anyone who knows it will know that exciting things are coming in the next chapter!
“What?! What the hell were you…?!” The level of John’s anger renders it almost impossible for him to form coherent accusations. “
A pale face looks out at him from the back window: angular cheekbones and ghostly eyes narrowed at his view of the world.
“Eighteen twenty.” She says again, nodding to the full glasses now waiting for him on the bar. “Eighteen pounds twenty,”
There’s a pause as John contemplates the relative implications of the statement. However he doesn’t get very far before his chair is jostled a little from one side: a young couple trying to get to the bar. A pretty brunette and her boyfriend, holding hands. He finds himself fractionally pressed against Sherlock for a moment. Their eyes meet and catch.
“I didn’t mean about the ‘not being dead’ bit Sherlock. Though it might have been nice to know that before now.”
John’s eyes were closed, his skin pale, made paler by the bandages across his temple and torso. One shoulder was completely covered by the rough hospital sheet, the other arm lay bare.
“I should probably get back to work,” She said breezily with a smile. John barely had enough time to nod an acknowledgement before she’d turned and was gone.
“Hampstead.” John offers, realising the rest of the journey will be a boring one if he decides to take offense,
“I don’t know!” In the face of interrogation John’s voice has grown louder, more to cover his fear than to convey his anger.
“You have post,” Mrs Hudson called from the hallway downstairs. Sherlock, absorbed in sorting through his final box, took the excuse to immediately drop the task, moving instead onto the landing.
“It must have been if you managed to get into a fight over ash,” John continues, then laughs for real: “And for pity’s sake,” John is possessed with it now, conjuring up images from earlier in the evening, “Madonna?!”
John opens his eyes, finds Sherlock lent against the far wall, hands behind him, an uncertain look on his face.
John is lost. The throb of the music, the press of the bodies, the heat and the light and the sound and this mouth; the lips and the teeth and the cool surge of a hot tongue. Heady with desire they continue to dance together. The slick press of limbs and torso and faces. They move and stroke and kiss and hold. Hands searching. Lips taking all they can from the other. All the while watching. Eyes locked together.
Thank you all for your kind support for this little story, I'm going to try and start updating it a little more often now that I have more to post.
“Sherlock is leaving,” His date tells him pleasantly. The scene seems to have continued on while John was no longer a player in it.
They looked at each other for a long time. John hummed a little in acknowledgement but didn’t say anything, he moved his gaze away again.
“Of course, yes,” Sherlock smiled back, realising she was the key to him gaining entry, “Very well deduced,” He added.
“And because if you didn’t blame yourself for this then we wouldn’t both be here.” Sherlock continues, “You think you could have stopped me. But you didn’t. You don’t remember coming up here because you never did.”
A pause, an uncomfortable one. John begins to question the wisdom of striking up conversations with strangers in coffee shops.
“Don’t ask too many questions, John,” Sherlock whispered, moving in close. “I find the whole thing makes much more sense if you don’t think about it too hard.”
The man doesn’t move. Doesn’t turn. Doesn’t even crick his neck again in the direction that John is standing.
John woke with a start, his heart racing as the hard line of his nightmare pulled taught across his chest.
The man in front him opens and closes his very un-Mike-like mouth as if unable to articulate a response.
The way Sherlock says the last word makes John turn to look at him properly. He’s finished scouring the room now and instead stands calmly in the middle of it, hands buried deep in the pockets of his dramatic coat: overkill for July.
John’s standing with a group of mates. Pint glass in hand. Watching as they laugh over an anecdote John hasn’t quite been able to catch the end of. Perhaps he’s getting too old for this.
His head was pounding, his stride shortening. He’d thought this change of scenery would be good for him, back to medicine; the routine of patients and paperwork and not quite knowing what the next chart would have in store for him.
“Sherlock cleared my name!” Angelo repeats to her, jumping back in when the conversation appears to be failing.
“Well, if you really wanted to do it you would, whether I was here or not.” John says, almost thoughtlessly.
“Really?” Eyes wide John looks around also, at a room full of perfectly ordinary looking people, “You can see all that?”
“I like it,” She announced, bringing John back to the moment, “A lot warmer than the usual place I eat my lunch,”
“Raise your hands!” An authoritative voice came down to them from the loudspeaker, Sherlock didn’t have to raise his eyes to know that the instruction wasn’t being levelled at him.
The party continued and Sherlock stayed quietly on its peripheries. A drink had been offered to him as he arrived and though he’d accepted it more as a disguise than anything else, he’d found that he’d enjoyed it more than he’d expected. He sought out a second.
Sherlock stands, finally. Unfolding himself from the sofa, stepping forward. Three feet. Two feet. One. John looks up at him as Sherlock offers him his hand. John takes it slowly, aware it is the first time they’ve touched since… well since tonight. This night.
“Your phone,” The stranger nods in the direction of John’s jacket pocket where he had replaced it earlier, “It’s expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you’re on an army pension – you wouldn’t waste money on that. It’s a gift then.
“Do you have any idea what that did to me? I watched my best friend fall off a roof. A roof for Pete’s sake. No. No, not fall. Jump. Jump Sherlock. You. Jumped. Off a roof. In front of me. Your best friend…”
Lewisham Police Station was the largest in Europe. A seemingly endless warren of mint green corridors stood between them and the interview room where Ms Stephens was being held.
“I’ve been writing to you, John,” Sherlock said very quietly, eyes on John’s closed eyelids. “You’ve not been replying.”
“Oh, this isn’t the kind of thing that will be included.” Sherlock replies straightforwardly. “I’m sure I will have dismissed this soon as unimportant. Deleted it.”
“You’re not leaving anyone behind in London then?” John asks and then wonders where the question came from.
Hanging up Sherlock found himself standing on the landing outside his sitting room again. He paused, looked back over his shoulder, and then turned, heading back down the stairs.
“By doing…” John gestures wildly, taking in the two of them, his bag, his cane, his phone. “By doing, all that?”
But then a particularly well aimed kick from a skinny leg catches John square in the gut and he’s pushed backwards. All sympathy for the man fades with the pain.
“Oh!” A bright smile replaced her bland expression, “Hi! Great to have you here finally! I’m Molly,” She rushed, then remembered herself, “Dr Hooper,” She stuck out a hand.
With that she’d gone and Sherlock moved to peer with more interest at the pigeonhole in the top right of the writing desk, marked simply “B”. A single sheet of paper was tucked there, no envelope.
This man who is sitting at his bedside, cool fingers encased around his in a manner too comfortable to be unfamiliar. John’s first drug-addled reaction on waking had been to kiss him, after his subconscious had dreamt up more than one vision of how their meeting could have resulted in their practically tearing each other’s clothes off.
Lestrade’s mouth fell open to argue but seemingly got stuck, instead he dropped his gaze to look at the article again, as if something were falling into place.
“I didn’t know, I saw.” The stranger says, his stare level until he lets his eyes flick up momentarily to the luggage rack above their heads. John understands:
“Well,” She sighed, when the moment passed. “I must let you go,” It was her way of telling him that she had other things she should be doing, “I’m sure you’ll be wanting to make the most of this lovely weather,”
“You often have a beer when you’re editing.” Sherlock’s words are calm; he’s still peering through the microscope.
John was silent in response, not wanting to offer the usual platitudes or expressions of surprise, but not really sure what else to say.
In the most part it was working, but occasionally he found himself missing that strange old flat on the other side of town; the smiling face of his landlady, the homely smell of baking as he’d let himself in of an evening.
“Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we could afford it. We’ll meet there tomorrow: seven o’clock.” He turns toward the door. “Sorry, I’ve got to dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
“It’s cold outside, wear a coat!” Sherlock called after him in a mocking, motherly tone. “And you forgot…” Sherlock started, seeing the stack of papers on the countertop.
“Fuck it.” He said finally, articulately. And surged forward, hand coming up to the back of Sherlock’s neck and drawing him down to capture his mouth with a fierce passion he didn’t think himself capable of.
In the silence that follows the kettle labours to it’s finish in the background and switches itself off with a click, efforts forgotten. The room waits.
“Both. It served double duty. We knew he would likely make a threat on their lives, and prepared them.”
“Most people knock,” Sherlock said calmly as he entered the room, the words spoken before he’d laid eyes on the occupant, “But then again, you’re not most people.”
Fit they did however, and once they were stacked neatly outside, John’s final task was simply to slot the note he’d penned in haste into the correct pigeonhole in the writing desk, turning then, to close the heavy front door behind him.
John needs evidence. Evidence that Sherlock had stood there. What had he touched? John casts around wildly, before realising the answers won’t be scrawled on the physical.
John was sitting in the dim hallway of 221, perched on the second step of the staircase that led up to his (Sherlock’s) old flat. In his lap was the most recent note.
“Who?” Sherlock asks innocently and John is lost. Head falling back into his hands, this time in laughter, back heaving with mirth, gasping for air.  Sherlock is right there along with him, his throaty laugh a warm rumble of joy in John’s chest. And as Sherlock laughs his hand falls against the back of John’s neck, long fingers brushing across the short hairs there and sending shivers down John’s spine. An acknowledgement. An understanding.
When he comes back moments later it’s with the promised blanket and a battered plastic chair. He spreads the former over the huddled figure on the bed, setting the chair beside him, close to his face.
John is too far away to see what the stranger is watching but he assumes it may be the distant black shells of uniforms moving around on the ground.
And the great John Watson, reduced to one word answers. But if he had to say, if he had to describe, that one word of Sherlock’s, normally spat out in disgust, somehow didn’t seem that way.
John is left wondering how the stranger could have known that John would know the answer to the question.
John remains unmoving, not wishing to alert them to the fact he’s awake. They are speaking without care to the volume of their voices, unconcerned about disturbing him. John wonders idly what that means.
“I…” John’s about to answer in the affirmative when a voice rings out over the loudspeaker above them.
Attention completely shifted he pulls from John’s grasp and untangles himself from the sofa, moving instead to stand in the middle of the room. John watches him go.
“Yes,” Sherlock said distractedly, “Yes I realise… I was just…” He tailed off, looking back over at the empty pigeonhole. “…on the phone.”
The barmaid with the pink hair is distracted when he finally makes it, the Friday night crowd meaning she probably has a lot of orders to fill before it’s his turn. He stands to wait, tramping down a vague feeling of recognition.
Stepping forward the true force of his memories took over and John found himself superimposing the past against the sharp empty angles of the space around him: the bison skull on the wall, Billy the skull on the mantlepiece, Sherlock’s eclectic book collection.
“Before…. Before you…?” It’s as if they each only have a certain quota of words on this night. John is running out of his.
John was finding leaving this place harder than he had imagined he would. He’d felt more at home in this strange little flat than he’d felt in a long time. These ramshackle possessions beginning to feel so much like his own that he was surprised when he discovered that everything he owned still fit neatly into the two holdalls he’d brought with him all those months ago.
Suddenly compelled he scrambled to the inside pocket of his coat, drawing out the small notebook and pen he’d brought along with him.
“Oh don’t worry,” She starts again brightly, “There’s all sorts round here.” She drops her voice somewhat conspiratorially, “Mrs Turner next door’s got married ones. But there I go getting ahead of myself. Setting you up before I even know your name!”
A dark figure up ahead, tall and dark, a long coat billowing as he walks quickly through a throng. Just out of reach.
He looked up to find Lestrade was standing some way ahead of him, motioning him forwards. Sherlock pocketed the note.
His insane flatmate comes back from the dead. Appears on the doorstep and lets himself casually back into the flat and back into John’s life. They talk. They talk for hours. They dissect and disassemble and explain and articulate and confuse and connect. They kiss. They touch. They moan.
“Who can tell I have a sibling with a drinking problem from my mobile but knows nothing about Hitchcock or finding his way to Scotland?”
“No, no, a human… Someone from the past.” John chuckled, looking down at his own lunch. “I’m not explaining myself very well,”
“I can vouch for him,” She said matter-of-factly, “He’s a friend.” Then without waiting for a reply she turned back to Sherlock and beckoned him forward down the hall. Sherlock couldn’t resist shooting the nurse a quick grin as he followed.
“Short, shouty,” She replied quickly, casting around for another descriptor, “He was wearing pink trousers, if that tells you anything about him…”
“Look, sorry,” John decides after a few moments, turning back with a tight smile, “Let’s just ignore that whole bit shall we?”
As if remembering the beverage in front of him the stranger takes a drink. John flicks his eyes back up to his face just in time to watch him grimace theatrically.
They contemplate each other. Sherlock’s face seems less pale now against the faded grey blue of the hospital blanket rather than the deep purple of his shirt.
A car swerved with a squeal of breaks and John’s attention was drawn to something going on in front of the hospital building. With a jolt of fear, he realised that the raised voices he could hear were being directed upwards, toward a dark figure, standing on the roof.
“So after,” John says instead, straying back, pulling his mind from those memories to others, impossible others. “After I blacked out. I saw you in a crowd.” John pauses, studying Sherlock’s face, a face seen so many places. “Then in a shop…” A pause, John fights against the feeling of the ridiculous: “And a cab… and a train…”
“John?” Her voice again, sounding lost. He’d been expecting a curt response, an insult, a shout. Anything but this broken emotion.
And John can see it now, that name, written in Sherlock’s hand. Part of a web, tacked up on the wall of 221b. A web with one person at the centre. A person they had found dead on a rooftop in the city, five floors above the lifeless form of John’s best friend.
“Where it all started?” She said with a sigh, the lightness in her voice showing she was doing her best to lift his mood.
“Sherlock.” When John speaks it is a whisper, his voice doesn’t feel like it’s been used in a lifetime. The word itself in longer.
The crime scene was boring. Again. Sherlock had grown tired of it within minutes, the details so horrendously obvious that he was regretting even approaching the body. It showed weakness, he could have solved it from the doorway.
Then on some unspoken agreement both sprang into action, turning and striding as one back to the embankment. As they rushed back to land Lestrade raised the radio he was holding to his mouth:
All of a sudden the stranger’s gaze seems to get caught on something he sees outside the window beside them. John doesn’t have chance to respond before the stranger has leapt to his feet.
“Another slice of cake?” Mrs Hudson asked, her tone trying for expectant, but John got the impression he was being hurried along.
“Which tells me it’s either illness, scandal or money.” Sherlock continues, “Although that is conjecture at best.”
Another stop, this time a long one. They contemplate each other across the blank concrete space, the two paces between them yawning as large and dangerous as the void at Sherlock’s back.
“I think you and she have differing definitions of important,” John replies, dropping the papers and looking up at Sherlock across the room. He still stands on the threshold, leaning his long frame against the doorway; dark suit and John’s favourite shirt.
John laughs, another question answered. Sherlock looks at him expectantly but John ignores it, pushing himself to his feet with effort:
“You never used to go in there,” Sherlock says slowly, speaking quietly upward at the ceiling in the darkness “Not at first. After you’d moved back. The curtains were never drawn nor the light ever on, not any time of the day or night. Oh at some point you must have been in there: to move the chair, it’s not been in its place in the sitting room for some time, it’s obvious by the way you move around the room, you’re used to its absence. But then you closed the door. You worked. Not quite to the same desperate level you did when you were in Islington, but still long hours. Until something made you go back in there. Obvious. Removal men. Either they were moving something in or they were moving something out. They opened the door and you found my papers. You’ve barely left the flat a day since.”
“Inside, Mrs Hudson,” He called to her as he did so, his voice clipped. She offered only a few noises in confused protest, before spotting the officers in hi-viz behind him and finally acquiescing.
Climbing the stairs behind Sherlock felt like walking through a dream. John found himself staring at the other man’s back in amazement, and no small amount of admiration, as he was led up and along the landing to the open sitting room door.
“Because I was hurting Sherlock.” A sigh. John is feeling too much, “Because you were gone and I was hurting. It hurt. I didn’t think you could hear me.”
He opens his eyes, looking back at the figure sitting silently before him. Sherlock is staring straight ahead, focusing on something over John’s shoulder, pale eyes open but unseeing.
Perhaps John hasn’t got the talent for consciousness he previously thought. Could he have fallen asleep? Dreamt? Dreamt of words?
“I play the violin when I’m thinking.” He continues to type as he talks, “Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”
John looked up from the page at the beautiful old church, the sign outside indeed advertising “Afternoon Tea for Two” in the old crypt. He could hear the scorn his correspondent would have heaped on the advertisement as if he were standing beside him. The urge to turn and offer him a smile in return was almost overwhelming.
“A threat has been made on your life.” He said clearly and plainly, looking her directly in the eye.
“So knowing what you know about the likely implications on a human body of hitting a pavement from a distance of let’s say, thirty feet, you would, as a doctor, be able to give me a pretty accurate description of injuries likely to be sustained in such a circumstance.”
“You will get better, John,” Sherlock said, looking back at him. He watched for any sense that he might have heard him, or that he was disturbed. John didn’t move.
They’re looking at each other now, eyes locked across a room. The intensity of Sherlock’s gaze disarming.
“He wasn’t a good liar,” Sherlock replied. Lestrade nodded. “Another one?” Sherlock asked, changing the subject and moving his attention back to the house in front of him.
“Whoever it is doesn’t realise you’ve moved out,” Mrs Hudson was saying calmly, somewhere above his awareness. She was holding them out to him as if they were nothing more than paper. They were nothing more than paper.
He took a long time to drink it all in. His head a muddle of the things Sherlock had said to him in his letters, and days that he’d spent here, before he’d known him. John was so lost in his thoughts that he didn’t hear when someone entered the room behind him.
“We’ve seen each other a few times.” Molly seemed to know what he was getting at without him having to complete his sentence,
He comes up short in the doorway to the bedroom. His shoulders falling as he surveys the mess: bed unmade, the duvet and pillows in such disarray it’s impossible to tell how many figures had slept there. John remembers doing the damage himself: Covers. Floor.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s voice again from somewhere at the back of the room, he seems to be making a habit of answering questions not directed at him “Six since June 13th. All female, middle class, aged between mid-thirties and early fifties,”
“John!” Molly called from the corridor ahead of him, John looked up from the chart he was studying and smiled. “It feels like it’s been ages.” She said as she caught up with him.
“You’re…” John starts again. Unable to form the words he wants to say. The external physical representations of an internally incapacitating emotion: “You’re not dead.”
“You’re here about Vanessa?” She asked, no-nonsense, going back to sit behind her desk and waving them to the two seats arranged in front of it.
A bill, he noted as he flicked through them, an advertisement, a letter from his lawyer. Then a handwritten note, his name written clearly and carefully across the front.
“There was a threat to your life,” Sherlock again. He hasn’t moved. Feet pressed firmly to the ground, standing in the doorway. Alive.
“I’m a suspect aren’t I?” He asks, “This is why you’re asking me these questions, asking me them again and again? You’re trying to catch me out, you think I had something to do with this…” He’s got to his feet now, anger rising; panic and worry and desperation.
Mycroft turned his eyes to the ceiling momentarily. “On my way out,” He replied, moving forward, “I wanted to bring you this.”
If I was sticking strictly to the film that would be where we ended. But I can't help thinking we need a bit of an Epilogue...
“And what else do you notice about her?” He asks, so close John can almost feel his breath on his face. John has to force himself to look back down at the photograph.
“Yes,” John pauses, wondering if there will ever be a time when he isn’t surprised by the weight of the things Sherlock knows “How did you…?”
Sherlock’s gaze shot upward to where Mycroft was watching him, their eyes catching tightly in another moment of understanding.
“That, or you’re always taking cakes out of the oven,” John joked back, accepting a cup of tea and taking his usual seat at the kitchen table.
“Is that…?” John starts, feeling somehow as if he’s heard it before; he has to shake his head to clear it, “I mean, I’ve never heard of it. Is that common?”
“He’s introducing himself.” Sherlock stopped, the vague hint of delight touching the corners of his mouth making him look manic, “He’s playing a game.”
“Transport said about four hours,” She replied, more concerned with the task she was moving toward than this interruption.
“The police will be in to speak to you.” He says slowly, looking between John and Sherlock, “When you’re feeling up to it?”
“Patient.” John smiles “You made quite an impression on her. I think she described you as my ‘’andsome fella’” John mimics her accent,
“I look forward to it,” Angelo was unaware of John’s anxiety, “What can I get you to drink?” He asked then jumped back in before John could reply. “Let me get a candle for the table; more romantic,”
“You saw two possible outcomes of your coming up here: either it was all a lie and there was really no one here at all, or you’d talk me out of it with little bother.”
At first they are tentative, slow, an air of disbelief in their actions. John is still ensuring that this figure is in fact in the room with him: solid and real and not likely to suddenly disappear in a flamboyant puff of smoke. But it doesn’t take long for the tentative to give way to the desperate. Sherlock’s big hands on the back of John’s neck, John’s fingers clutching into dark curls, mouths pressed so close and so hard he can taste the rust of blood on his lips. John has the sense that this is the taste of the words they have said. That he will find them all here on these soft lips, crashing against his with such force they seem to draw the breath from his lungs, the words from his mind.
“Are you sulking?” John asks, aware that the grunt can hear him. He busies himself automatically as he moves across the room: paperwork on the coffee table, keys on the shelf by the door, union jack pillow rehomed from floor to chair, haphazard pile of books retrieved from the carpet, three empty tea mugs rescued from mysteriously common hiding places. As he carries them through to the kitchen he finds Sherlock sitting at the table, peering into his microscope.
The door swings open before him, revealing a tall man with a thick dark curls and sharp cheekbones. The figure strolls into the room casually, his long coat swinging around skinny legs.
“We sit here and talk and make jokes and plan but it’s not real. It keeps happening, over and over and I see it. Please. Please explain this to me, for the love of God, explain it to me, Sherlock.” John is pleading now, “This isn’t happening and I want it to. I love you. Why aren’t you there?!”
John is taking a break from a busy shift in the hospital, stepping out into the sunshine to seek a restful place to eat the sandwiches his wife had packed for them both that morning. Still wearing his scrubs he feels a bit conspicuous as he treads the concrete paths amid the grass, seeking sanctuary on the first bench he finds: half empty, the other half seating a man in an unseasonably large coat.
Eyes fixed on John his fingers move to the buttons on the shirt John had spent much time worshiping. He undoes each slowly. John can only lean his head back and stare, gaze flicking desperately between burning eyes half shadowed by curls and the motion of long fingers over expensive material.
“You’ve told me again and again you only want to be involved with the interesting cases,” Lestrade said, frustrated. “Believe me, nothing interesting about this one: bloke murdered over money, dodgy investment deals. We’ve got plenty of leads and we’re pursuing them.” He looked down at the paper again. “But…” He picked the paper up, “Who are they kidding with that headline…?”
John looks up at the previous owner of that coffee, his dark suit and dramatic coat seem to have avoided the cascade of liquid completely.
Before he can say a word however a memory appears in John’s mind, brought about by the sight of Sherlock’s face sitting so close to his right elbow.  Suddenly he can feel the smooth skin of Sherlock’s cheek beneath his fingertips, smell the scent of his skin, taste the swell of his lips. Had that really…?
He realised that until that moment he’d still been working on the assumption that all this was probably some kind of a hoax. He knew he was writing letters to someone, a person that existed and seemingly cared enough to do something so thoughtful for him as to plan that trip through London. But this person couldn’t possibly be living in a different time.
John draws away. This is suddenly something, someone, that he intensely does not what to be involved with.
“The Royal Free?” Sherlock asks, referring to the hospital. For an instant John is faintly surprised that Sherlock has remembered this detail, provided as quickly as it was, before he remembers who he seems to be talking to.
From the doorway Sherlock turned back, Lestrade was standing over the body scribbling furiously in his notebook.
“I’ll get a candle for the table.” He says, with a grin, Sherlock already forgotten. “It’s more romantic.”
to me!” Moran’s anger is sudden and dramatic. John is suddenly overwhelmed with the sickening smell of chlorine, “If you want to play games with me Dr Watson,” Moran continues, words like ice, “I’m happy to oblige. I learnt from the best.”
Sherlock squared his shoulders, schooling any trace of expression from his face. Then stepped forward toward the half-open sitting room door, pushing it wide.
“No.” John pauses, pondering the relative propriety of pressing the matter, then deciding to anyway:  “Was I right?”
“…and that it hurts. It hurt. It was hard.” A pause, John levels his gaze at him “I told you that. And you didn’t even blink.”
John stands behind a familiar man in a dark suit. He’s facing away from him, arm raised at right angles to his skinny frame to aim the gun he’s holding at a figure some distance away.
Sherlock nods and casting around for a second puts out a hand to pull the battered plastic chair across from wall to bed. He sits down and takes a breath to begin.
“You couldn’t be further from wrong if you tried,” Sherlock says with rising impatience. “Open your eyes,”
Everyone had paused in what they were doing as he’d first called her name, turning to look straight at him. As he clarified his request a number stepped backward, revealing a figure standing at the head of one of the examination tables, fingers deep in the open skull of a cadaver laid out before her. She was so absorbed in her work that she was the only one who’d not registered his presence.
Sherlock is still there. Still patient. Still watching. What they call a fixed gaze. Pupils fixed and dilated. A dead man’s stare.
“I thought,” John starts, realising he has no idea of how to end the sentence, “I thought I might be able to help.”
“I’m not going to ask about the cuffs…” Lestrade said, pointing them out to him some way away, half submerged in the grey. Sherlock studied them from a distance.
“Look after yourself,” She beseeched as they reached the hallway. Sherlock couldn’t resist a glance to the pigeonhole. Empty. Obviously.
“Yes,” The word is slow, John’s mind seems to be churning through too many memories: close and inane and big and important and far away and impossible.
Moriarty sighed dramatically, rising and pulling the front of his jacket straight. If he’d noticed the hesitation he didn’t comment on it.
He shook his head at the thought and took the letter with him up the stairs. Reading it for a second time.
“But why outside?” He asked, jumping a little on his heels as he walked, anything to generate more heat. “In February?!”
“Only comes once a day,” She offered brightly as an answer. Sherlock took this to mean he’d already asked that day.
The kind of club that John wouldn’t admit to occasionally frequenting if any of the guys in his unit were to ask.  Not that they would, John thinks, what happens on leave, stays on leave. Seventy two hours of heady freedom. Freedom from drills and uniforms and the hot, faceless monotony of his Hippocratic burden. John has intended to take advantage of every moment of it. Which explains why he’s here; shirtless amid a throng of throbbing bodies; moving in strobe against a soundtrack of drum and pop.
“You should go,” Sherlock cuts him off. He hasn’t turned. Instead he aims the words slightly backward over one shoulder.
“Dr Watson?” There was a voice over John’s shoulder, and he could have cried in gratitude for the interruption.
“I don’t remember you saying that the first time,” There’s a smile haunting at the edges of Sherlock’s mouth.
The response appeared in exactly the time it took John to pace the length of the hallway and back, as if his correspondent were doing the same.
“And you haven’t seen them since you’ve been back in the country.” Sherlock’s apparent knowledge catches John by surprise again.
Sherlock nods once and then crouches, a practised flick of one arm causing his coat to fan out on the floor behind him as he does so. John is so caught up in watching it that he fails to realise how close Sherlock’s face has become until he speaks.
“That’s what people DO!” He screeched the word, coming closer. He was almost a full head shorter than Sherlock but that served to make him no less intimidating.
“He may,” Sherlock finishes what he’s typing and replaces his phone in his coat, fixing John in a cool stare, “But it’s unlikely.”
In one swift motion John is on his feet. Crossing the room and grabbing at that figure in the doorway. The way he should have last night. The way he couldn’t. The way he wished he had.
The blank home screen stares back at him mutely and John realises how long it’s been seen he’s seen Sherlock’s name there. Since it was commonplace to do so. Text after text: explaining a case, informing him they were out of milk, asking John to follow him.
They’ve been sitting in silence for some time. John’s energy is ebbing. The buzz of adrenaline created on the sudden appearance of a corpse long subsided in his veins.
“You asked me.” Sherlock has become very still, the nervous tension that fuelled his pacing suddenly lost. “That day. You asked me. Not to be.”
“Doesn’t look like this particular incident is going to make it into that book of yours then?” He asks,
The kiss is fleeting, soft. A summation of everything that has gone before, John pulls back almost immediately to search out Sherlock’s eyes again, seeking affirmation.
“A consulting criminal?” Lestrade blustered. He really did have an irritating habit of repeating the words Sherlock said back to him as if they were somehow surprising.
Something in this seems to get through to him. Sherlock turns his whole body slowly on the ledge; John can’t help but be fixated on slim dark shoes shifting so close to the void.
Everything about the latest case pointed at suicide, and there was nothing that Sherlock could do to convince anyone otherwise. Similarly the connection to Venessa Stephens: it was obvious, important, but not strong enough to provide any kind of lead on the whereabouts of her body. And without a body, Lestrade told him firmly, it wasn’t a murder investigation.
“We still can’t find any record of him anywhere,” Lestrade said as they skirted together around to the boating ramp that would lead down to the shore. “I mean it, Sherlock, it’s more than weird: it’s impossible. Since you gave us the name we’ve searched everything, everywhere. We’ve turned the internet upside down. He doesn’t exist.”
“John! Let me get you a drink,” Molly greeted him the moment he stepped through the door. She had made an effort, he noticed, in the thirty minutes since he’d last seen her she’d managed a full change of outfit, hairstyle and makeup.
“She’s not my housekeeper,” Sherlock parroted huffily and did his best to ignore the smile that Lestrade failed to hide, “What is it now?” he asked impatiently,
“And you believed in me, despite what I told you, despite the fall.” Sherlock keeps looping back around to that thought.
“Alcohol will do that to you.” Sherlock repeats John’s words. “I assume you imbibed the same concoction you also fed to me.”
“You don’t need to make excuses,” Lestrade said, leaning beside him. Sherlock shot him a look. “It’s not your thing, you don’t need to apologise.” Lestrade continued.
With the unsatisfactory conclusion of the conversation he’d had with Lestrade about the whole affair, Sherlock had realised that the only way to engage this John (aka M) would be to go along with the nonsense contained in the letter.
“Oh,” There’s a rush of relief in the man’s voice, he sits forward, half rising from his chair. “I…” He starts.
It’s a nice little place, John decides, threading his way between the tables behind his date. The décor is simple, the atmosphere warm and friendly. It had been her recommendation that they get a reservation here; she’d told him it was one of her favourites. John thinks he must have walked past the front a hundred times without looking inside.
“I really did, thank you,” John huffed out a laugh, “Honestly, Molly told me what to expect but I never really…” He tailed off, unsure how to explain.
“I’m an idiot.” John states simply, then pauses, expecting a response but not getting one. “I shouldn’t have… I…” John starts with his usual eloquence, “I’m sorry.” He finishes.
Sherlock opens a door at the top to a room filled with clutter and pattern and deep warm hues that seem to somehow match the timber of his voice. However John doesn’t pause to contemplate the decoration for long, rounding instead on the figure beside him and this time it’s John that pushes Sherlock against the wall; fingers tangled in loose curls, bodies pressed as close as lips.
The conversation had abruptly taken a turn he couldn’t handle: from the calm of the hospital corridor to the battleground in the blink of an eye. His mind was immediately back on the field; the sand, the shouts, the blood, as vivid as any of the flashbacks he’d had when he’d first started working there. He had to shake his head to clear it.
Mycroft’s entire stance had changed, his shoulders notching back and his back lengthening. It was the posture of a man preparing for battle.
Putting it all in order had seemed like a good idea all those weeks ago, when he’d started to sift through the objects in the flat, the books and the papers and the notes, sheet after sheet of sloped handwriting that seems to sing with personality: here it is careful, structured; lines following ordered steps of logic, turn it over and find wild ideas, scribbled haphazardly in margins and pushed up against other text – as if it has no real idea of personal boundaries.
“He enjoyed playing with your mind.” Sherlock says heavily, tensing his jaw with suppressed emotion, “He tortured you.” Tenser still. “He knew my appearance had created confusion, he played on that. He played with you.”
“But it’s unacceptable that you cannot do that on your own terms.” Sherlock says. He’s still standing in the doorway, too far away.
“Of course,” His companion replies with the ghost of a smirk, John’s statement seems to have pleased him for some reason. “But you are mistaken; you’re unlikely to have heard my name in the gossip columns.”
“That this is a young man’s game John,” Sherlock’s eyes are full of an unidentifiable emotion, “I’m getting tired of playing it.”
A noise downstairs. He pauses, mug in hand. Key in the lock, front door swinging open. Feet on the hallway floor.
The look Sherlock gives him in response to that laugh is one of pure confusion; it makes John’s grin wider and his grip on Sherlock’s cheek firmer. John holds it there for a moment, just watching, until he uses those anchored fingertips to draw Sherlock closer to him, capturing those ridiculous lips in a kiss.
“I realise you may have been over this before Sir,” She placates, her tone calm “It’s important we have all the details.”
John stopped where he was and looked at her, the smile on his face fading slowly. A sudden memory reared up.
His eyes were full of the tears he hadn’t cried, his throat choked with the lump he hadn’t cleared. He knew every one of his words he’d written by heart, and now Sherlock had them.
“Cuba.” Her eyes were still locked on Sherlock, and his on her. Lestrade looked quickly between the two.
“This way is easier?” Sherlock provides, parroting words that have been spoken in similar conversations previously.
The room is in chaos: littered possessions, half unpacked boxes, books and papers and notes. John has to struggle to remember how it looked when he left it: a room half full of remembered objects and the tense expectation of a space waiting to be filled. Well now it is; even the bison has headphones again.
“Excellent deduction.” Sherlock said gently and John finally twisted his neck to look back at him, his face screwing up against the lights of the house.
She smiles sweetly and has time to offer a bashful “Thank you,” before a large man with an animated face abruptly bustles over to their table.
“The fact that you are using your old army kit bag on a simple visit to your parents tells me you’ve not had the time, inclination or income to buy replacement luggage.”
In front of them the body of a young woman lay face up in the grey mud of the Thames, eyes staring blankly to the sky. She was dressed in a pale jumper, floral apron and white lab coat, the strange ensemble completed with a dark blue scarf almost the exact replica of the one currently wound around Sherlock’s neck.
“It was lovely to see you,” He said pleasantly, “All those months ago now. At your brother’s place.”
At odds with the stillness within the café the road outside is a busy one, full of the bustle of the evening as people pass by:  home from work, out to the theatre, returning from the shops laden with bags, the odd jogger. He watches as a young couple stroll past laughing outside; a pretty brunette and her boyfriend, holding hands.
Sherlock drew close to John again, resting his fingers lightly along John’s jaw and holding his gaze. Before pulling him close for another kiss.
In the room behind a woman sat alone at an interview table. She had darker hair and a darker tan, but she was, unmistakeably, Vanessa Stephens.
There’s a noise at the other side of the room and John turns from Sherlock in time to watch a woman push in through the door. She’s wearing a nurse’s uniform. She has pink hair.
“Look at you, all happy. It’s not decent,” Mrs Hudson replies, her tone sounding more as if she’s in receipt of a compliment rather than an explanation of what sounds like a violent crime. Four violent crimes.
“Harry and me don’t get on.” Johns starts, “Never have. Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they’re getting a divorce; and Harry is a drinker.”
The patient he is addressing is an older man, sitting perched on the side of the bed as if about to topple off it. A weathered looking golden retriever is sitting obediently at his side.
“No, you didn’t. You didn’t underestimate anything. You never do. You knew exactly what you were doing.”
He tried not to think of that John too often, despite knowing now what he looked like. The way his uniform fit him, the brightness of his smile, the precise military shaping of his hair around his skull.
“Seven,” Sherlock answers calmly, John has to flick his eyes up to him again in surprise. He hadn’t expected a response. “And a half,”
“It means you have reached your destination.” Sherlock says as the last words of the announcement die away.
“The blouse she’s wearing is Armani,” Sherlock started, slowly, “It’s part of their spring/summer ’08 range, pricey, exclusive. If she’s wearing it any earlier than April this year she will have had to have purchased it through their advance mail order service, only available through a personal shopper or similar.  Her hair is coloured, to within an inch of its life, and styled. She didn’t wake up that morning looking like that. She could have done it herself but more likely, judging by the exclusivity of that blouse, it was professionally done, recent to death. So if the hair is done, chances are so is the makeup, no point in perfect hair and an imperfect face. What are the only events that a woman is most likely to make that kind of effort for? Their wedding day, and that is clearly not a wedding dress, or a media appearance.” Sherlock stopped suddenly, the pace at which he was speaking having increased as he continued. “Had any tv stars go missing recently…?”
The previous tenant had always been “him” when Mrs Hudson had been talking about him, she’d only ever used his name once, but it wasn’t one that you would forget in a hurry.
“Raise. Your. Hands.” Came the order again. Sherlock and Moriarty had locked eyes: Sherlock’s calm and considered, Moriarty’s wild.
John can’t help but smile at this man who seems to know so much about people, without knowing anything at all. “So how did you know?”
“Yes. I read your military career in your face and your posture and your reason for leaving in your leg. I can’t read your mind.”
As with a lot of furniture left in the same place for a long period of time, John barely noticed it as he passed by on his way up to his first floor flat. After all, it was only the top right pigeonhole that he need acknowledge; marked simply “B”. And it was almost always empty, he’d told no one the address.
“And this one is interesting how?” Sherlock asked, heading to the lifts and jabbing at the call button.
“You changed time,” Sherlock said, John looked at him in confusion. “By sending that letter, you changed everything. I moved in here for a start.”
They watch each other from two paces apart. Still moving to the music. John is aware of a hand on his own shoulder but he doesn’t turn to assess the owner, instead he moves with it and finds a stranger’s body pressed up against his back: a strong chest and muscular legs and obvious arousal grinding against his behind. It’s on the edge of the explicit but somehow the intimacy with which that distant stranger is watching is more sexual, more honest than any dry humping with a faceless dance partner. As John stares back the man’s full lips draw together, his tongue darting out to wet them and John’s breath hitches. He’s disentangled himself from the grinder’s grip in an instant, stepping forward.
“Er, no,” He aims at the uniformed woman in the aisle, automatically fishing in his pocket for his phone and thereby wordlessly answering his companion to the opposite effect, “Nothing for me thanks.” He continues to her, casually handing over one of the most expensive and personal items he owns to a man he hasn’t known for more than ten minutes.
“Very well,” Sherlock agrees finally with the same affirmation as before, tilting his head forward slightly.
His route back however had taken him down this painfully familiar corridor, one he usually avoided at all costs. He’d spent too much time here, not long enough ago now, but the door had been open as he passed and for some reason in the mood he was in he’d been unable to stop himself from venturing inside.
Finished, the stranger reaches out to take a drink from the coffee on the table in front of him. John stares.
“Not technically or physically.” Sherlock corrects as he shuffles himself under John’s duvet, lying on his back and reaching for John as he slides in beside him.
Lestrade said nothing, instead he fished his police ID from his jacket pocket to show to him. The receptionist offered it only a cursory glance.
John can’t help but smile, perhaps this was this strange man’s way of attempting to spare John’s feelings by changing the subject – back to himself.
“Good luck, Watson,” One of his companions said and Sherlock realised that until that moment he hadn’t known John’s last name.
’ Details. Details. Details.” John’s breath is fast again. “I don’t want the details Sherlock. I want you to hear what I’m saying to you: I. Thought. I. Had. Lost. You.”
“Control is a loose term,” John said, handing off the chart in his hands to a waiting blonde nurse with a smile, before picking up the next. Three.
“No,” John laughed. He wasn’t wearing a frock. Just the normal jeans and jumper he’d worn into work that morning.
“I know who M is.” Sherlock’s expression widened slowly with glee. He leapt to his feet. “Of course, it makes perfect sense!”
“You don’t need to apologise.” Sherlock’s voice is softer now, but John still can’t bring himself to look at him.
“I’m thinking that that man has all the charisma of a wet tea-towel, no wonder her people didn’t want her associated with him.”
“There’s no evidence at all that this is linked with your murders, Sherlock.” Lestrade said calmly. “No card, nothing complicated.” He leant forward again and it was his turn to poke at the headline, “And we’re not ‘mystified’. The case is on-going.”
“So you do agree?” Sherlock asks as he pulls away, uncharacteristic uncertainty flashing across his pale eyes.
“Yes well,” Sherlock suppressed the urge to squirm, instead, he smoothed the ends of his scarf against his coat. “I’m turning over a new leaf.”
John’s face was calm in the drug-induced sleep, but there were creases across his forehead that Sherlock didn’t think he’d seen before. From pain? He wondered. Worry?
“I’ll be in touch with the details, my landlady will so enjoy having someone around while I’m gone. And she can look out for him, in his recovery.”
His lips are immaculate. Soft and slick and firm and searching. It’s all John can do to keep up with them and keep upright. His hands cautiously finding their way beneath that coat, searching out the join between shirt and trouser. Beginning to tug.
“Excellent deduction,” She smiled, moving into the room and over to the curtains, tugging them open.
“It’s just a feeling,” John says, then a pause: “It feels a bit like you’re, I don’t know, waiting for something…”
“Look,” John starts. Sherlock’s hand is cool under his, “I could be completely off the mark with this and please tell me if I am, but…”
Sherlock looked from the letter to the door in surprise, suddenly reminded of his location in the house.
A long sigh. John sits back on his chair, resting his head back against familiar cushions. Blinking his eyes against the heaviness in his lids.
“I wanted you.” John tells him slowly, finally, a tone of confession. The expression on Sherlock’s face doesn’t change. “In my dream,” John continues, not quite sure if he’s making any sense, “More than once.”
Lestrade turned to go and Sherlock stood slowly, eyes on Vanessa until the moment he had to turn to follow him.
“Don’t.” John says, the same caution from earlier. “Don’t” He scrubs his hands back over his eyes, feeling faintly like a wild animal that Sherlock is slowly creeping up on, pausing at each stage to build the trust necessary for another step. Is he still being trained?
The only welcome his new building afforded him at the end of the day was the impersonal reception desk and the short walk down the corridor to his deep red front door.
John’s eyes cut to her, mouth dropping open a little to ask how she knew, before he stopped. Of course she would have seen him, she worked in the morgue.
Without access to the pigeonhole it was fruitless. John was further away from him now than he had been when he’d been touring Afghanistan. And he was staying in Sherlock’s old rooms.
“I’m going to need someone to look after my place while I’m away. You should suggest it to him. When he’s ready.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to say something, eyes darting across John’s face as if trying to read text written there.
Sherlock’s voice in the room, the words from a dream. John has to close his mouth around his reply, knocked of kilter for a moment. At some point this might stop happening: reality reflecting dreams reflecting reality.
The surge of cool air his withdrawing figure leaves against John is enough to spark him into action, following close on his heels as Sherlock clatters dramatically up the staircase.
“15 degrees on Valentines Day, can’t be London,” Molly said as John tipped his head to catch the February sun on his face.
Left alone the two of them contemplate each other. Sherlock lingering uncertainly on his feet instead of taking the seat Mrs Hudson has vacated.
Sherlock doesn’t reply for a long time. They sit looking at each other. John begins to understand what people mean when they say their heart is in their throat. He can feel it pumping there, huge and sickening.
Pleasantries were exchanged, well wishes given and minutes later John was safely standing outside on the pavement. He barely made it three paces from the front door before he had the letter out and was reading it.
“I suppose not.” John finds himself smiling again at his turn of phrase, before a thought strikes him. “Hang on a minute; shouldn’t I be the one forgiving you?”
He watched, disconnected, as the two threw their heads back in shared laughter, before Mary raised her eyes and met his across the crowded room. She detached herself and came over to him.
“My wife.” John says to them both, as if explaining the circumstance to an errant child, “Is missing.”
“There’s always something,” The stranger continues, thoughtfully, tipping his head gently to one side.
“Not really my area,” Sherlock replied, mainly to the kitchen door, which he was attempting to close.
“It doesn’t have to be.” John offers what he thinks is the right thing to say, stepping forward a little. The man doesn’t turn but senses his movement, angling his face over his shoulder toward him without meeting his eye.
When John finally realised that he should be reaching out to take them from her it was as if his arm were moving through water. The air around them thick and viscous.
“So when someone wants to commit a crime, but doesn’t know how to go about it…?” Lestrade asked slowly as if hoping to be corrected, “They’ll just call...”
“Can you make it across the room without doing any more damage?” John asks with a smile, he’s rewarded with the narrowing of steel blue eyes:
And John is abruptly completely overcome with the feeling that this has happened before. Those words in that order. A jaguar voice and a pale stare. Suddenly woozy John has to close his eyes against it.
Seemingly, Sherlock thought to himself as he finished reading the note, the mysterious M was going to keep up his charade.
“I’m in.” John says, breaking apart only far enough to form the words, his lips brushing Sherlock’s as he says them. “I always have been. I always will be. Call me and I will follow.”
. John flicks his eyes back to the stranger, confirming his attention is still elsewhere, before answering.
John swallows. Nerves suddenly suffocating. For a time they simply regard each other, fingers linked, John’s eyes roaming Sherlock’s face: the familiar eyes, the ridiculous cheekbones.
Sherlock doesn’t seem to know what to say in response. His mouth hanging open beneath the edge of John’s hand, pale eyes huge, pupils darting left and right across John’s face.
Sherlock regards him levelly for a few moments, eyes narrowed, before he slowly steps forward and, ignoring the hand John has offered him, sits down in front of him on the coffee table. On top of the papers. John can’t help but notice how close his left elbow comes from brushing against the beer bottle beside him.
“George?” She asked, he simply looked back at her, realisation dawned. “Oh yes, Greg will be there,”
Thank you for all those that have offered encouragement, kudos and comments so far, they really do make all of my days. Thank you also for your very great patience with the delay to updates, hopefully these will go back to normal (i.e. around twice a week) from here on out.
“You’re not at work?” Sherlock asked, knowing his brother’s shared dislike of anyone stating the obvious.
“He’s high,” John announces, pressing back as the man surges forward again beneath his restraining touch.
