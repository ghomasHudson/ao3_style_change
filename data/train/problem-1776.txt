“Oh! Er. Sorry.” he said, squeezing Sherlock’s fingers and letting go. Sherlock’s mouth twitched into a small smile, and he turned back to the parcel on the bed.
his fault.” Sherlock said, darkly.
As the last notes of the tune died away, the crowd seemed to deflate slightly. After the exertion of the dance, many people ducked outside to cool down and catch their breath, or headed for the bar to quench their dry throats. Sherlock appeared after a second or two, his face glowing and his dark curls sticking to his temples. He was only slightly out of breath, but he stripped off his jacket and discarded it lazily on a nearby before leaning against the wall next to John, his elbows propped back on the windowsill. The angle of his legs made the fabric of his kilt slip and drape over his thighs, revealing a sliver of white thigh. John coughed slightly, and attempted to tear his eyes away.
Evidently not the case. Not now, anyway. God, what had he gone through after he had left London?
him? He’s gorgeous.” She paused and bit her lower lip. “He’s bloody gorgeous. I did some amazing nude sketches of him. And I mean, I’m an open-minded sort. But I came to realise that there are some areas in which we weren’t terribly compatible.”
“Don’t worry. That bolt will withstand a lot, and I jammed a chair under the doorknob, just to be on the safe side. I also took a gun and a couple of knives off her before I dragged her in.”
Mary held his gaze for a long moment, then sighed; as if he were being particularly difficult. “Look. Whatever you might think, John… this isn’t personal. I don’t give a damn about Sherlock.”
“And what I told you earlier, all that stuff- I’ve never told anyone that. Ever. I couldn’t. And then you asked me and then it all came out, just like that. And that means something, doesn’t it? Because you want to see inside my head and I’d let you, I’d let you see it all. And…” John swallows hard, painfully. “That’s it, isn’t it? I’ve realized that’s what love is.”
against Sherlock’s bloodied ear. He had held him until his breathing steadied, evening out into blessed sleep.
Violet stepped forward smartly, reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck. She felt his huge hands come to rest on her waist after a second or two.
“So Violet had a bottle, as did Mrs. Duncan, PC Dalziell and Miss Argyle, and you, Mr. Antonelli.”
“Oh, shut up!” he sighed, and after a moment heaved himself to his knees. It took a moment longer to balance himself on his feet, clutching at a nearby boulder as his legs shook convulsively.
“Oh! Oh, no. Certainly not. No.” John agreed solemnly.
John had to laugh. He hadn’t meant to say that, not at all. And he hadn’t the faintest idea what kind of response he had been expecting. He wasn’t crushed at the response, and wasn’t
that she didn’t; but I don’t think that she wanted to take the time to find another box.” Mr. Mackie grimaced. “She also told me off for tracking the tiniest wee bit of mud into the bowling club hall. Glared at me and told me that cleanliness was next to Godliness, the old besom.”
John mouthed behind her back, pointing at Murdy. Sherlock rolled his eyes and waved his hand dismissively at John, turning to look at the bins himself.
John mouthed
“Hedda died suddenly of a stroke when I was fifteen. I couldn’t say that I loved her, but I missed her more than I thought was possible. She was the first person who had seen potential in me; the first person who had bothered to teach me anything properly. The house felt all wrong without her. It seemed much darker there without her. And it quickly became clear that she had been the main force that had restrained Karl. Within a week he had become more aggressive. He left bruises when he grabbed me and pushed me up against the pantry door in the kitchen. He pulled some of my hair out at the roots.
Your mouth. I need it on me now…” Sherlock whispered brokenly, gasping at the rhythmic, gentle pressure of his fingers.
John shrugged helplessly. “You and me both. And. Um. Oh, hell...” he trailed off and swallowed. “It looked as if we were getting somewhere, it really did. But. Um. I think I may have buggered it up before we even got anywhere.”
Mycroft continued to stare at him, an eyebrow slightly raised. At least, John thought grimly, he had the man’s full attention.
Violet leaned back in her usual armchair next to the fireplace and surveyed Sherrinford thoughtfully, pursing her small red mouth. She propped her feet in their emerald suede pumps up on his knee in a companionable sort of way. She said nothing for perhaps a minute, letting her gaze drift to the stuffed and mounted stags head over the fireplace.
“His brother was killed a few years ago.” Mary said, after a long pause. “I mean Davit Harman. I spoke to him yesterday, he was alive then. He sent his nephew Narek along, as well as another man of his. Schneider. I swear, my involvement was over once I’d drugged the sugar and got John out of the way. I was going to get away separately by boat; I’ve got one tied up along the river.”
“Well Violet told me yesterday evening that she’d heard Alice Duncan is improving rapidly, and she was able to give a statement to the Aberdeen constabulary that-“
Violet scrunched her nose and shrugged. “I can remember needing that kind of refuge when I was her age. There’s a peace that comes with curling up among a large number of books. Even the smell helps, I think – one of the most calming ones I know of, anyway.”
“I could have been in a rush. I could have slept too long this afternoon,” she challenged, one eyebrow raised.
“But I
to Violet!” Sherlock hissed. “She has had a murder in her house, and she is relying on me to sort it out. The last thing she needs is for you to-“
to have to do this, you know.” Duncan murmured, slipping a hand into his jacket pocket. “We’ve been friends, haven’t we? I’m the only one who understands how much you want to get out of this godforsaken village, aren’t I? It’s such a waste for minds like ours to be cooped up here. Didn’t I try and persuade your dad to let you go away to school? And this is how you repay me?”
“No, nothing at all. Not a thing. I, er.... I think I’ll let you two get on with things. You must be

laddie. I’ve never seen the like.”
, to feel like this. This should be effortless, easy, familiar. His hands shouldn’t be trembling. He shouldn’t feel on the verge of scared to meet Sherlock’s gaze. Not after all these years.
“No, I tried to stop them because… because I know you don’t allow yourself to love many people. And I know what it would do to you to lose him. So please…
John realised suddenly that he had been in the cloakroom for far too long, and hadn’t been making anywhere near enough noise to suggest he had been searching for anything.
Sherlock rubbed his cheekbone a little crossly and glared. “For heavens sake, you might as well attempt to kiss me properly!”
“Oh?” John said, swallowing hard and moving forward to slip the buttons carefully through the holes of Sherlock’s shirt cuffs. His heart was beating wildly; the slight dread and excitement about Sherlock trying to penetrate him again giving way to an odd mixture of disappointment, relief and curiosity. “What do you have in mind? It better not be anything on page 48, mind. We spoke about that, remember?”
Sherlock regarded him unblinkingly for several seconds, before digging in his pocket for a handkerchief which he handed to John.
“Um. I suppose you’d better come along to the station with me, then.” Dalziell said, when it became clear that Reverend Duncan wasn’t about to elaborate. “I expect I’d better call in the chaps from Aberdeen for this. Could you, er… would you mind letting me put some cuffs on him, Doctor Watson?”
Sherlock stayed utterly still for a long beat, horribly aware of his trapped foot which must only be inches away from Narek Harman. Certainly within easy reach of his tongue. Briefly, Sherlock felt an acute need to vomit, picturing the young man silently biding his time as he listened to Sherlock’s attempts to free himself. Watching his bare toes flex and the blood flow from his grazed skin.
“Should we put it back where it was?” Murdy asked, studying the needle and the cigarette packet with great interest.
Sherlock cast one last sorrowful look at his plate, and pushed it aside. John noticed that he now had everyone’s full attention after this last exchange, and stifled a grin. Sherlock might well bemoan the fact that his dinner was getting cold; but he would undoubtedly relish his bloody
“And that is perhaps one of the main issues.” Patrick sighed. “The Work.”
Violet nodded wordlessly, deftly perfecting the top layer of curls. Sherlock still didn’t look up from the page. A long pause.
“Tell me the dull story about the topiary, then.” Sherlock asked quietly.
John sighed and leaned back, digging his hands into his pockets. “Fine, be that way. I must admit I’m more worried about your brother at the moment.”
Almost shyly. And it had made John resolve to give him more gifts, all the gifts in the world, if it meant that Sherlock would look at him like that – edges softened, genuinely pleased and fond.
Violet looked expectant, lighting another cigarette. “Golly. How intriguing!”
“Assault?!” George spluttered. “She was asking for it! You know what she’s like, old man!”
“There now…” John murmured softly. “Was that so hard?”
“There’s quite a few likely ones here, really.” John sighed. “There’s obviously been quite a few women wearing wellies that’ve walked through here in the last few hours. Hang on, though…” he paused. “These ones look reasonably fresh, though – they haven’t frozen sharp around the edges yet. Look, these ones. See?”
Sherlock’s frown softened a little and he stirred; evidently John’s quiet words had been enough to disturb him. He sighed heavily and stretched his legs out, kicking another cushion to the ground as he did so.
Sherlock shrugged one shoulder, unwinding his scarf and dropping it messily on an ornate carved wooden chair next to the fireplace. “She doesn’t spend all that much time here. Beyond the library, I don’t think she’s ever really thought of it as hers at all.”
Mrs Holmes had not expected Sherlock to say a cheerful hello to his grandparents and uncle. She had certainly not expected the large bunch of chrysanthemums he carried, or the loud and smacking kiss on the cheek she received. He had positively lit up at the sight of Violet, who could not stop beaming at her husband’s nephew.
it with you. Do you understand?”
. It’s an
The library was dark, as was the kitchen and Violet’s study. There was a dim light coming from under the door of the student’s common room; but John was not inclined to check in there. He had had quite enough of their company for one evening. He made his way quietly through the hall, narrowly avoiding tripping over the feet of the stuffed bear, which seemed to loom menacingly out of the shadows. John gave the creature a hard look and crept on.
Despite the minor thaw of the morning, snow had begun to fall lightly again by the time Sherlock, John and Murdy began their walk back towards Hilderbogie Village. Murdy walked a little way ahead, kicking at snowdrifts with her large black boots. She was evidently deep in thought.
“Oh my god! I know what it is!” John breathed. “You couldn’t be the best so you decided that you’d never do it again!”
John gaped, blushing a little. Was this some gay cruising thing? He glanced at Sherlock, who was watching Patrick intently and with a hint of confusion. John clasped Sherlock’s shoulder, bringing his ear level with his mouth.
Sherlock didn’t reply, but didn’t let go of John’s hand until they reached the kitchen.
“You do that.” Sherlock said drily, his hands on his hips.
you can’t. They said as soon as possible but who the hell knows what that actually means, out here?)
“And you’ve been to the Duncans’ house to check if there was a written note or phone message there.” Sherlock supplied. “There wasn’t of course. Obviously.”
He had only been clean for six months at this point. He itched and the days were so bloody long and he was yet to sufficiently ingratiate himself with NSY to get involved with the really juicy cases. When he had received her email three days previously, Sherlock had been a matter of hours away from texting one of his old contacts down at the Vauxhall arches. Instead he had gritted his teeth and booked a one way ticket to Miami, with little more than an idea of removing himself from immediate temptation.
“And how much did she ask you for?”
“She does.” Sherlock raised his eyes from third slice of honey cake and nodded thoughtfully at the girl. “Very well done, Miss Antonelli.”
Sherlock frowned a little, then jumped when Violet noisily snapped on a pair of bright yellow washing-up gloves next to his ear.
a grim voice in the back of his mind told him.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Well maybe not immediately, John.”
[John?]
“You’re a punctuation-face.” John murmured very quietly, and turned a page.
John closed his eyes and found himself leaning his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder. “Argh...argh...argh!”
“Back in Edinburgh. That morning in the bath. Do you remember?”
“Classified.” Anthea said swiftly, as Sherlock opened his mouth to respond. “Really,
“Right. And he doesn’t want
have been a life with you. Every time.”
“You certainly are in sparkling form today, John.” said Sherlock seriously.
Sherlock’s gaze still rested on the album in Violet’s hand and it took him a moment to reply, somewhat distractedly: “The doll. We need to find out how it got into the poisoners hands; and that will involve talking to the younger Antonelli girls, unfortunately.”
John attempted to reorder his thoughts, taking a deep breath as he tried his best to focus on her words and the endlessly detailed maps on the floor. Murdy was wound tight, positively vibrating with energy and impatience as she explained the various trails through the mountains. Her newly shorn dark hair was messy, bearing the unmistakeable signs of restless fingers dragged through it repeatedly.
John tentatively deepened the kiss, parting his lips a little and encouraging Sherlock to do the same. Sherlock complied, hesitantly, after a moment or two. He allowed John to slowly sweep his tongue against his own, fingers moving in his hair. The blood roared in John’s veins, and he slipped his other arm around Sherlock’s waist, under his coat and jacket, drawing their bodies tightly together. His fingers tightened in Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock moaned into his mouth. He broke away, panting.
“Huh.” John said, thoughtfully. “Oh! The vampire thing! It all makes sense!”
Violet laughed at him in a fond, unfamiliar sort of way that thrilled him slightly. She told him about walking the banks of the Seine in winter at five in the morning; about finding a lost Vivaldi manuscript among some tax records at the Archives Nationale there. At one point she drew a clever little sketch of his face on a sheet of foolscap, and told him that he looked like something Egon Schiele and Mervyn Peake dreamt up together after a night drinking too much absinthe (he didn’t know whether to be excited or offended by this, and settled for a little of each).
John attempted to think even more quickly. “Well, the local police wouldn’t be puzzled over that, can they? It must be more complicated.”
He cast the briefest of looks at Patrick, who did not meet his gaze. Abruptly, he turned on his heel and walked away, ducking slightly to avoid tangling his umbrella in the branches of a nearby ash tree. Within seconds he had disappeared, joining the straggling party-goers who were making their way down the path. Patrick covered his mouth briefly with his hand. He suddenly looked utterly exhausted.
Sherlock cocked his head and stared at her, letting his overlong dark curls fall over one eye. His face was fiercely angular, and his hands and feet seemed far too big for his skinny body. He was dressed in a smart dark suit and white shirt, but his tie had gotten lost somewhere during the course of the day. Violet noticed absently that his left shoelace was untied. Her fingers itched to do it up again.
He still couldn’t bring himself to look up, but froze when he heard a sudden “Ah!” coming from Sherlock. (Oh, great. Marvellous.)
He moved faster than John had ever seen him, his feet flying up the wide staircase. It seemed odd, wrong somehow – despite Mycroft’s thin hawkish frame, his movements were always slow and ponderous. The way he pounded up the stairs towards them spoke more of his panic than words ever could. He stopped dead in front of John and Violet, his eyes flickering over their bloodstained hands and clothes; their no doubt shell-shocked expressions.
you’re usually squirming against me. Mm, yes… like that. Just like that…”
Sherlock suddenly squirmed out from their hiding spot and darted out into the garden again, heading straight for the tiny pond. He grabbed a large ceramic gnome that had been aimlessly dangling a fishing line into the water and swung it with an almost balletic grace over his head. It flew through the air in a high arc, revolving and spinning until it landed with a ear-splitting crash in a greenhouse several doors down.
“It’s lovely to meet you. I forgot to ask Sherlock your surname, so I don’t quite know what to call you!” he laughed, a little nervously. He felt like an idiot.
Phyllis looked like she was thinking hard. “Wednesday morning. I think. I saw him from my bedroom window, and he was out in the garden. I mean the front garden, with all the funny tree things. He was walking about and smoking. I’ve got ever such a nice room here, full of strange old things.  And such a lovely view,” she added brightly.
“Sorry. Do you think you’ll survive?”
John certainly hadn’t noticed Patrick Singh’s shoes, but the man was certainly putting away the stew more quickly than the rest of the diners who seemed reluctant to do much more than look at their plates. Despite the warmth from the large dining room fire place, Singh was wearing a dark red cashmere sweater over one of his elegant linen shirts, and his hair was tied back loosely at the nape of his neck. As soon as Margaret Gothford had cleared the (still rather full) plates from in front of all the diners, he made his excuses and left quietly.
Sherlock gingerly sank his raw knuckles into the tureen as Violet busied herself with cleaning his grazed cheekbone. The tense discomfort in his face was gradually replaced with relief as his fingers went numb in the depths of the snow. He closed his eyes wearily, listening to her bustle around the kitchen. He was on the verge of sleep when she slapped a handful of something cool, damp and fragrant on the abrasion.
“The Taliban destroyed them, of course. Stored weapons in the caves where the monks used to live, terrorised the locals, turned the place into a fucking ruin.” John sighed, willing the familiar anger away. “We weren’t helping much. But anyway. We were on patrol one evening, at the base of the cliffs. I used to like going along that route, although it was bloody risky. Because we’d go through the remains of the old monastery garden. I mean, it was sad in a way – the old statues had been broken and kicked over, and they were slowly getting completely overgrown. But most of the trees were still there, cypresses I think? You know, the tall pointed ones. Loads of them, and olive and cedar trees. All laid out in complicated patterns.
Damn. He expected that he looked as debauched as he felt. Maybe he really should just stay in the bedroom until it was safe to come out, and Mycroft had left the building.
The expression in Sherlock’s eyes changed from resigned irritation to a mixture of outright horror and revulsion. “Dear god, John. The sheer
This last statement was shouted angrily and was greeted with loud applause and yells of encouragement.
John couldn’t help staring at Sherlock when he got like this. It wasn’t just his unabashed delight at the food in front of him (although that was certainly rare enough), but the sheer sensuous pleasure he was taking at the flavours and scents. He licked the dripping honey from his thumb after drizzling it liberally over his plate, the movement of his full lips around his fingers nearly causing John to drop his fork.
Basil stared at John, clearly surprised. “Taken- oh! Oh, blast. Has he? How can you tell?”
“Quite good, yes.” Sherlock said, after a moment during which he kissed John soundly. “But, er… I think you need a bit more practice. Much more, in fact.”
“John, I appreciate your concern but please be assured that I will not be sampling the evidence. For a start, smoking opium requires a special pipe, which I do not have. I suppose I could render it suitable for injection, but I do not have any syringes or needles in my luggage. You may check my case if you like. At a last resort, I could certainly
“Oh, er…” Mr Antonelli seemed to struggle internally for a moment, and then sighed. “Look, I try to get along with everyone, right? You have to, in my line of work. But I don’t have much time for the PC.”
Sherlock shrugged slightly and looked around rapidly. He was obviously waiting for inspiration to strike. John could hear a regular kicking at the garden door now; the ancient wood surely wouldn’t last long.
Sherlock bit his lip and took a couple of deep breaths through his nose, leaning his head on the back of the sofa. John felt his muscles clench and relax around his index finger, which was still buried to the hilt inside Sherlock. He slid it out a little, and pressed the tip of his middle finger against Sherlock’s entrance, before pushing slowly back into his hot slick passage, feeling the resistance of strong muscle and watching his rim stretch around him. Sherlock moaned, and bore down on John’s fingers as he slowly opened further.
Sherlock shook the hand that the minister offered, with a faint frown. John was just about to do the same when the mobile in his pocket suddenly rang.
John reddened slightly and scratched the back of his neck.
She swiftly poured some coffee from the pot on the stove into a bowl, hastily added some milk, and swept from the kitchen without looking at either of them. John frowned and sat down opposite Menzies, who seemed oblivious to Violet’s reaction.
Murdy looked back at him, her arms folded tightly across her chest. Her gaze was challenging; but she didn’t say a word. And John hated himself for the fact that the words died in his throat. He couldn’t bring himself to say them; couldn’t make himself do the right thing and insist that she go home to the safety of her family.
“He laughed at me initially. He thought that I was an idiot romantic with aspirations to be some kind of freedom-fighter, and I did not dissuade him of this. He still wasn’t willing to assist me, though. Not without… not without some form of recompense.”
“Mine!” Violet said brightly. “Mr Brodie was telling me off yesterday. Said that I was going through far too much gin these days. He’s probably right too, the blighter.”
Murdy shrugged one sharp shoulder and wriggled a little uncomfortably. “I dunno. He’s busy, I suppose. He spends a lot of time in Aberdeen on his chaplaincy work. Apart from the services in the kirk here, he doesn’t do an awful lot in the village.”
perfectly fine.” John pointed out quietly. “And you can’t know that about Sherry. He was already an alcoholic. You had
“You’re a lot like your uncle Sherry, aren’t you?” he remarked, leading them over to a table and swinging down a couple of stools for them to sit on. Sherlock's expression flickered slightly at this, but he didn’t respond. It struck John that he had never even seen a photograph of Violet’s husband and he immediately began to wonder if there were any old photo albums back at Hilderbogie House.
“Gentlemen. I shall be in touch later.” he bowed slightly, and with a final chilly little smile he was gone.
“Intriguing. I always told you that the countryside was a sinister place, my dear John.” Sherlock said, with considerable satisfaction. His long fingers began to absently inch slowly up the doctors spine, delicately tracing each vertebrae. “Tight-knit communities filled with malicious gossip. Blood feuds and grudges that fester and build over generations. Suspicious hunting accidents. ”
“Hmm. Looks like Mr. Marmaduke has finished his nap.” Sherlock said suddenly, frowning and leaning forwards so that he could get an uninterrupted view through some palm fronds. John turned and followed his line of vision. Sure enough, George could be seen pacing the wide smooth lawn outside. Despite the chilly late afternoon and the brisk wind, he was still clad only in jeans and his light painting smock. His hair was dishevelled and he seemed to be muttering to himself as he made his way along the gravel path that led to the back garden and the painting studio. John stared at him speculatively.
He scanned the humid leafy room, and spotted Patrick Singh sitting alone on a bench under a large potted palm tree. Singh was reading his kindle in an absorbed fashion and didn’t seem to notice John approaching until he was only a few feet away. He glanced up abruptly at John, and turned the device off hurriedly.
John couldn’t quite decide if this conversation was more like a tennis match or the beginnings of a brawl. Sherlock was idly running his fingers through the remains of the sauce on his plate, licking the last of the lemon and juniper reduction from his index and middle fingers. (Patrick was looking mildly appalled at this further lapse in decorum.) Violet was leaning towards him from across the table, her elbows firmly planted along the edge. She was wearing a dangerous kind of smile, incidentally looking more frightening and devastatingly attractive than John had ever seen her.
John stared at him, could almost hear the tangle of thoughts seething in Sherlock’s mind. “Back in Edinburgh… back then, you told me that you wanted to eclipse all the bad things. That you wanted me to be your only frame of reference when it comes to sex. Is this about that?”
“Don’t be fucking ridiculous,” Violet said sharply. “I just mean that we’ve got to have a system. If you just wander out into the dark you’ll end up going in circles or getting lost yourself.”
“I’m…all…right!” he gasped, his chest heaving shallowly. “Just get me out!”
[He didn’t even stop to think. The idiot threw himself at them. I couldn’t have stopped them, I swear it. I just wanted them to take me quietly, Mycroft. But I heard the shot and I saw him on the floor, he was a tangled heap and he wasn’t moving and oh god I’m
“So, um. May we ask how it came into your possession?” PC Erskine asked timidly, gripping his uniform cap with both hands and nodding towards the tonic box which sat carelessly on the long wooden table.
Patrick took another ragged breath, his hand blindly reaching for John’s blood-smeared knee. “Three of them. Blonde. French and eastern… European? Knife and a tattoo… dog? Sherlock, he was being carried by the man… bald.. he shot-“
this weekend.”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open again. “Oh! John. Yes, there are some things I have to tell you about Cousin Violet.”
And that was alright. There was much to think about and far too much to deal with. He knew that he could only keep the anger and sorrow tamped down for so long. He had to face unpacking those boxes, and all the evidence of the life he had shared with Mary.
“It’ll make it so much easier for us to break your fingers when the times comes.” Violet pointed out, cheerfully pressing the barrel of the Sig to Mary’s temple while Anthea got to work with the tape. “And in case you’re wondering, breaking fingers is something I’ve got experience in. It’s been a while since I used a gun, too. But it’s all coming back to me now. Isn’t sense memory a marvellous thing?”
“On what?” Murdy shot back.
Griz, who suddenly seemed uncharacteristically talkative, didn’t seem to notice. “Like where? You and that other man are from London, aren’t you? Why’d you need to learn how to drive in the snow?”
Sherlock nodded, and swallowed convulsively. “Yes, of course. He- he didn’t do much. He didn’t have the chance. Trenet told him he’d let him, later on.” he inhaled deeply, not meeting John’s eyes.
Sherlock maintained his determinedly innocent expression, seeming perplexed at both John’s outrage and Violet’s salacious grin.
[Foolish, brother mine.]
He froze, seeing the shape of a dark-haired man sitting hunched over a table with his back to them. At first it seemed that there must have been some terrible mistake, and for a split second John wondered giddily if perhaps his theory about forgotten meat might have been correct. But when Sherlock flicked the light switch next to the door and stepped purposefully towards the man, the facts of the matter became horribly clear.
“Mmm?” she frowned, perplexed.
(Mycroft
“Oh, er-“ he hedged, trying to think of a deflection. The Reverend, after all, had expressly asked them not to mention Mrs. Duncan’s alcoholism to anyone.
“Oh my god, you really just asked that.” John murmured, and pushed himself away from the trunk of the tree. He made a great show of pitching the almost empty cup into a nearby rubbish bin and dusted off the back of his damp black jacket. He began to walk away down the rain darkened path, tugging his collar up against the heavy drops from the branches overhead. Sherlock studied him curiously, taking in the line of his shoulders and the pace of his steps. This wasn’t one of the walks that John took when he ‘needed some air’, or more accurately ‘to be somewhere that Sherlock is not’.
“He felt guilty.” Sherlock said woodenly, staring into the empty fireplace. “He and Mummy. About how I was driving the car. As if it were, in some stupid way, anybody’s fault but
Sherlock opened his eyes and blinked several times. John was relieved that he wasn’t pushed away immediately, but he felt deeply uneasy as he saw Sherlock open his mouth to speak but remaining silent. He couldn’t read his expression at all.
“He can’t have gotten that far.” John said, turning to look for Mycroft and Anthea. “And I’m going alone if I have to.”
“Well, I haven’t seen him but someone’s been up before us.” Violet informed him, nodding towards the kitchen door. “I reckon he’s gone out for a walk – that door’s been opened in the last couple of hours. The snow’s been disturbed on the window.”
“There’s still no call to be giving our stuff away to jumble sales without asking first.” Rab insisted darkly. “So you damn well better stay away from Big Ted, Petty.”
“Because of his relationship with Sandra?” John asked.
Petty bristled slightly. “Look, this isn’t London. People just don’t help themselves to stuff; it’s not only dishonest, but it would be incredibly
“So you solve lots of mysteries, right?” she asked suddenly, aiming the question at Sherlock.
“But aren’t they the-“
“’BARN-‘“ he read. “’LOND-‘ ‘G-’. London? You think that this might give us a clue to Garcia’s whereabouts?”
Violet took hold of Patrick’s wrist and pulled his arm around her own shoulders before nestling into his side. “Shut up and huddle.”
But then, Basil had never come across as the brightest chap in the world; and John supposed it was possible that he had had a rather sheltered upbringing.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose and reached for the perforated metal scoop that lay nearby on the worn wooden countertop. Violet, dressed for dinner in sapphire blue crepe de chine, watched keenly from her seat on the draining-board. She was hawk-like in her surveillance as he carefully slipped it into the depths of the roiling water, twirling a stop-watch between her fingers.
“John, please. Just come on. Come to me. Don’t look anywhere but at me, alright?”
He could see Violet shaking her head in the wing mirror almost as soon as she heard his low, halting words. “No. No, that’s not true. There were three of them; they were armed and they had that bloody woman on their side too. They’d have taken him anyway. If you’d been with him they might well have shot you, as well as poor Patrick.”
“Do continue, Mr. Montague.” Sherlock said sternly.
“Think that’s a Holmes genetic trait, to be honest.” Violet pointed out, fairly.
Sherlock sighed theatrically, slipping off John’s lap and grabbing a couple of pillows from the head of the bed. “As you are a medical professional, I would be most disappointed if you couldn’t find my prostate, John.”
Sherlock leant down and murmured: “It’s the Orcadian version of a dance called Strip the Willow. I hope you’re feeling energetic.”
“Rab! Pruny! Come on, I’m supposed to be having a serious chat with Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson here. Less of your nonsense.”
“You’ve become rather attached to this bath.” Sherlock commented, taking a seat on the gleaming rolled edge and taking a sip from his own cup. He let his eyes drift over John’s flushed wet body with considerable interest. John felt a blush rising, and fought the urge to duck his head.
“Not a bit of it. I’ll be off now, I’ve got to do something about the shop anyhow. Let me know if you need anything, Toni and Pheemy said they’d help me sort out the ordering.”
the little scunners!” Murdy growled, burying her face in her knees.
He had suddenly come back to himself when there was a sudden scurry of movement below. A muffled creak and clang of a metal bolt on a scratched shipping container that still sat on the decks of a small cargo ship anchored some fifty yards away. The vessel was dark, not a single light at any of the windows or portholes. Sherlock leaned forwards, pressing his cheek to the grimy window to keep the container in his line of vision. Normally the deliveries were taken from containers that had been lifted onto the quay, concealed within sacks of grain or fertiliser. Not the case this evening.
The sweat was pouring down John’s face and his mouth seemed to be full of ashes. It was all somehow worse that he knew what was happening, he was a bloody doctor and a good one at that. He knew he wasn’t having a heart attack, that it was all in his head. But he couldn’t stop it, was now having even more trouble controlling his breathing.
on me-“ Violet’s voice was high and broke slightly, with either fury or fear John couldn’t tell. He began hammering at the door along with Sherlock, who was silent and white faced, his shoulders rigid. The ancient wood was heavy and thick, and barely budged under the onslaught.
“Yes.” John said, rather at a loss over how to respond to this. “Thanks so much for the help with the tea, Patrick. I’m sorry but I must be off; I’ve still got to pack and I’m fairly sure we don’t have any, um… balaclavas.”
“So. Approximately how long after Sandra’s death did you take these, Violet?” Sherlock asked after a moment.
“Oh god, John! John, John… John, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Sherlock whispered, his hands convulsively clenching and unclenching at his sides. John could see the long elegant fingers trembling as they reached out to touch his hips then withdrawing again, as if Sherlock couldn’t quite bring himself to touch him.
Murdy pushed her heavy fringe out of her eyes and regarded him beadily. Patrick stared out of the window, watching Mr. Brodie’s broad shouldered figure make its way across the white lawns towards the stable block.
“Jaguar, mark nine. 1959. Nice, eh?” Mr. Brodie nodded approvingly.
“Of course, by this point I had realised that there had to be a point to all this endless instruction and sketching. I never explicitly asked him the reason; I still had something of a horror of asking questions. In the back of my mind, that was always a sure path towards being beaten. It was nearly a year before he showed me his study, where he did his own work. I wasn’t surprised. I wasn’t shocked. I was… fascinated. He let me watch him, working from dozens of photographs of every square inch of an old oil painting of peasants in a snow-covered field. He was half-way through his copy, and it was remarkable. And I realised that I had seen this painting before, in a book in the library. It had disappeared during the war in Germany; the Nazis had looted it from a prominent Dresden family. Philip told me calmly that he had a prospective buyer in Leningrad for the painting. It went without saying that the buyer was expecting the original, that he believed that Philip had somehow procured the original. His reputation as a historian helped tremendously – who on earth would question Vilhjalmsson’s judgement on whether a painting was real or not?
Sherlock closed his eyes and swallowed again. “You’re so much better at this sort of thing. And I generally don’t think that we need to say things. Important things, I mean. To each other. I usually find it safe to assume that you know the important things.”
since a really juicy one.
“Because you took advantage of our family!” Mycroft retorted. “You lived under my grandparents roof, and when they died you made free with their house and possessions. You continue to make money from their land.”
John looked up at him, faintly startled. “What?”
The sick thumping of his heart continued for what seemed like hours as John attempted to focus only on what was in front of him. His own hands, clamped tightly on his knees.
of a person with charm.”
want him in the same house as Sherlock again?)
Staring up at the shadows in the pleated silk canopy overhead, John began to think hard. He probably wasn’t going to get many other opportunities to share a bed with Sherlock. Circumstances had conspired for them to share this closeness; he could hardly imagine Sherlock clambering into bed with him back at Baker Street at the end of a long day.
“Goodnight, Mr. Holmes.” He heard Patrick say, as he pushed the door open once more. Mycroft raised a hand dismissively in farewell, but didn’t meet his eye or respond.
“I’m fine!” John half-shouted, wide-eyed. “Fine! Oh fuck, Sherlock, please don’t stop now…”
“Have you had any trouble from people in the village?” John asked curiously, as Sherlock dodged around to view the shelves from a variety of angles.
“It’s still not all that common, though.” John pointed out. “I mean, only a very small number of British personnel would have access to it.”
“I’m glad you married him, Vi.”
“Of course I am,” he said simply, and shut his eyes when John kissed him.
Hilary looked down into Phyllis’s face coldly, but didn’t say a word. When Phyllis made a move closer, John wondered for a mad instant whether she was about to slap Hilary in the face.
“Sorry, ‘fraid not.” John replied, making his way over to her. He hadn’t noticed Violet slipping out of the church hall, but he concluded that she must have done as Mycroft came to greet them at the bar. “And to be honest, even though it might make you feel a bit warmer, brandy would actually lower your core temperature.”
“You shut your mouth!” Murdy snapped, without looking up from unlacing her boots. Through the dishevelled curtain of her dark hair, John thought he saw her blushing scarlet and winced a little in sympathy.
“The swearing I could manage.” Violet grinned, taking a sip of her wine. “Cooking to please anyone but myself, though – absolutely not. Anyone who told me to change a thing, I’d throw a colander at their head. I suppose I picked it up here and there. I studied cooking a bit, in Paris. Long time ago, now though.”
John continued to suck him through it, stroking his prostate as he tasted the bitter, mineral tang of Sherlock’s come filling his mouth. He’d never thought that he’d enjoy this, before he and Sherlock had become involved, but he found himself relishing the flavour of his lover on his tongue, the peculiar metallic, lemon and salt taste of him. He slowly let Sherlock’s softening cock slip from his mouth after a long minute, his fingers still buried inside him. Sherlock was lying back bonelessly on the sofa, his breath hitching and his face flushed, seemingly incapable of movement. After a moment or two, he managed to open his eyes, looking down at John with a kind of hazy adoration.
to realise?!] become clear what had happened. He had heard the footsteps as they advanced along the corridor outside; felt the minute vibrations of the wood beneath his cheek. [Mmm. Two… no, three. Men. She’s… she’s still with John. John. John! What’s happening to John?]
“No, then.” Murdy said firmly. “Definitely not.”
The whole business had been so dull, Sherlock had been vaguely tempted just to move on without bothering with Jacob Trenet. The world was hardly going to be greatly improved by the removal of just one more heroin supplier; another three inevitably just popped up in their place to fill the gap in the market. Moriarty was dead, it wasn’t as if the money was benefiting him any more.
“Did you mind Patrick taking a shine to Mycroft?” John wondered. Violet grinned, lighting another cigarette.
“And you, John.” Mycroft said, calmly. But his eyes were remote and cold as he turned and walked away.
“We have every confidence in Mr. Holmes’ abilities, don’t we?” Patrick Singh said smoothly, looking around the group.
Mechanically, he pushed the door shut, willing it to stay on its remaining single hinge before going to crouch at the empty fireplace. A pile of dusty, mostly dry logs lay stacked against the wall nearby. As he reached for them he sent scores of woodlice scuttling across the packed earth floor, but he ignored them in favour of scouring the place for matches, a lighter, even a pair of sodding
“And, of course... well, we should utterly
He quickly made his way to the door, stepping over the sleepy collie and unlocking the bottom half of the door; swinging it wide open to admit them. He rested his hands on his hips, gazing up into Sherlock’s face with unabashed curiosity before seeming to remember his manners and shaking hands with both of them.
“Well how were we to know that Petunia was going to be used for luring ministers wives into freezing rivers?!” Pruny complained. “That’s hardly
Murdy and Griz began to reluctantly wrap themselves up once more in coats and scarves, preparing to go and ask Mr. Brodie for a lift home. Sherlock cleared his throat. “Murdy? I’d like to talk to you about something tomorrow, if I may.”
“Good. That’s... good.” John made an effort to calm down. “Right. Who’s next?”
Mycroft seemed to struggle momentarily, glancing back across the table at Patrick. Singh watched this exchange with mild curiosity and a hint of humour in his dark eyes, before murmuring: “I don’t think I am in the mood for sweets just now, either. Perhaps you would like to take a stroll with me in the conservatory, Mr. Holmes? It is quite…
“But not today. You’ve unsurprisingly been a little preoccupied. But to return to my main point. You spent most of the afternoon cooking, but took the time to return to your room and put on one of your most expensive dresses and jewellery. Your appearance is not calculated to attract anyone; rather to intimidate or inspire envy. Those shoes, as well. They are entirely impractical, look hideously uncomfortable, and I personally find them revolting; but they cost at least a thousand pounds. My guess is that you want to make an impression on one or more of the female students.”
“Oh, please, John. Please go back-“ Sherlock said in a low, strangled voice.
John returned his gun hesitantly to the waistband of his jeans, and accepted the boost that Sherlock gave him up onto the wall to their right. He tried to keep as low as possible, to keep out of sight. He grasped Sherlock’s wrists and helped him up before slipping down into the next garden.
“Ah, yes. There is that.” Sherlock smiled, a little more confidently. “One of the great joys of life, you know. There’s
Patrick Singh still seemed to have eyes only for Sherlock and was yet to say a word to anyone.
“Good morning, John.” Mycroft said smoothly, a slight smile on his foxy features. “Good to see you. I’ll just come in, shall I?”
“You don’t want to be the receiving partner. I know. I figured that out already.” John kissed him again. “Honestly, Sherlock. It’s fine. It’s all fine. I trust you. I’ll give it a go, when the time comes. I can’t guarantee that I’ll like it, but I want to try it with you.”
want Sherlock to spend a minute in her company if I truly thought she was bad for him. I would damn well help you keep them apart, if I believed that. I swear.”
Miss Argyle opened and closed her mouth several times. Her hand stole to the back of her head, smoothing down her disarranged pale hair. She swallowed hard and looked around at the people around her, taking in the shocked and disapproving faces of her neighbours. John realised that several of the people present were undoubtedly the parents of children she taught. Peeping between the legs and around the sides of several adults were various children; all of whom looked positively gleeful
Hilderbogie only seemed to be waking up as they made their way down the narrow winding streets. Few cars inched their way along the slushy streets, and there were only a handful of people out and about. They passed a deserted drapers shop, and a shuttered pub before cutting down a side street after the small Victorian schoolhouse. It didn’t escape John’s notice that a few sidelong glances were cast towards Murdy, and more than one pair of curtains twitched as they walked past the grey stone houses.
“Gosh. Well, um. That’s good to know. We’ll make sure to turn down any cases that involve submarine travel.” John said, unsuccessfully trying to keep the grin from his face. “Or aquariums, obviously.”
“Er-“ John began.
He wordlessly accepted a bowl of coffee, sitting down near the fireplace once more. Even his
Sherlock was gazing at her, suddenly enthralled. “My god, I didn't realise how angry you are...”
“Just wait until dinner. You’ll see.”
“Really?” Sherlock murmured, and bit sharply on John’s collarbone before swiping his tongue gently over the reddened flesh, grinning wolfishly as John’s breath stuttered at the sensation. “I hadn’t noticed.”
“So why is she called Cousin Violet?”
smile at him. The bloody police do nothing but frown, and my blasted sisters seem to do nothing but wail over him. I’ll be seeing you. Sorry to intrude, lads.” This last remark was directed to John and Sherlock, who nodded and waved respectively.
Sherlock ignored Patrick and craned his neck to face John. “A small cognac, I think, John.”
“He’s gone.” John confirmed, sitting back down. “Vi, what would Katy be planning on doing with a shotgun in your garden? You don’t happen to have pheasants somewhere among the shrubs, do you?”
“How about this, then.” John said in a low voice. “I know that you love me. It took me long enough to realise it; but I know that, in my bones.”
He stepped closer, the handle of the knife clenched in his fist. Mary’s eyes were calculating as he moved towards her, giving way to real alarm as Mycroft made no attempt to stop him. The elder Holmes merely folded his arms, watching John advance with a faintly curious expression. John couldn’t bear it, couldn’t stand seeing her sitting there and calmly admitting to
“Do you know if any of them were in the army?” John asked Murdy curiously.
Sherlock frowns. “Well obviously I’d like to, but medical science is unlikely to reach that point any time soon.”
Reaching the end of the room, he turned only to find Sherlock wading towards him through some rose bushes. Sherlock had obviously regained his composure after the uncomfortable scene in the studio; he was practically vibrating with purpose and his green eyes gleamed when he caught sight of John.
“Hmm.” Violet stared at him with narrowed eyes. “And yet, as I recall, I was the one who taught you how to figure out tan-lines. The way to tell the difference between six types of bank employees. Grades of fabric; types of paper; ceramics; quite a lot of sleight of hand; identifying provincial dialects in at least five languages and let’s not forget about how to play the bassoon. Need I continue?”
“I’ll do whatever I please, thank you.” came the snappish reply. [Marseilles. Bleach Blonde. Bruno? Yes, that was it.]
John forced himself to keep his eyes trained on her, watching her every move. Her false, flirtatious expression had dropped instantly at Violet’s harsh words and with a poor grace she shrugged off her coat; letting it collapse in a heap on the stone floor. She toed off her winter boots, and straightened up to face them once more. She turned in an exaggeratedly slow circle, her hands on either side of her head. John could see more blood now, soaked into the shoulder of her wool sweater.
Hilary turned around, her fists balled tightly. Her face had flushed a dull red and she looked positively murderous. “Anything else?” she asked, after a long pause in which she was obviously struggling for control.
There was no trace of Violet in the kitchen, for which he was grateful. She must have stolen away, not wanting to intrude on the conversation. Her cup was gone from the table, and the two that John had set out for himself and Sherlock sat full on the kitchen table, steaming gently in the cool air. He grasped the back of one of the chairs, feeling suddenly nauseous and weak. Christ,
“Which tells us what, Miss Antonelli?” Sherlock persisted, coming to a halt. His eyes didn’t leave her face for a moment. John watched interestedly as Murdy tucked her chin into the collar of her coat, frowning up at the detective.
Since it was a truth universally acknowledged that Sherlock on aeroplanes was A Very Bad Thing, he and John found themselves on the 7am train from Kings Cross to Edinburgh the next morning.
“I’m sorry. It must be a horrible time for you.” he said quietly, and turned awkwardly for the door.
A flash of irritation crossed Sherlock’s face. “The rabbits, Miss Boorman. Why don’t you tell everyone about the
Absurd.”
“Nope.” Sherlock said brightly. “Don’t let us keep you.”
“Don’t think so.” Murdy observed. “It looks like it was on this shelf here, see where the pots have been pushed back? About the right size for a box that size. There’s no other gaps like that on the shelves, they’re all evenly spaced.”
John raised an eyebrow at that.
After a few minutes, another figure appeared from some gloomy corner of the space; obviously more than one alley opened into it. A tall man appeared, his face shadowed by a wide-brimmed hat and the upturned collar of a long black coat. He walked swiftly towards Patrick, his hands deep in his pockets. John and Sherlock were too far away from the two men to hear what they said in greeting; both bowed slightly, which struck John as slightly odd. Patrick was certainly formal in manner, but he had never noticed him actually
“It was a painting of Hilary she defaced?” John asked, trying to remember if Violet had told them this before. A glance at Sherlock’s pensive face confirmed his suspicion that she had not.
He stared at her, perplexed. (Why he thinks… oh. Oh, no. No!
“Lube?” John panted, squirming and ducking so that he could catch Sherlock’s flushed nipple between his teeth.
“Oh, I expect we’d better give it to Menzies when he comes round later.” Sherlock said in a disinterested tone, re-wrapping the parcel and encasing the whole thing in his pocket handkerchief. “I suppose we could fingerprint the plastic, but it will be something of a formality.”
. It tasted like grandmother’s hairdos and talcum powder.)
“Did you get on well with him?” John asked, wandering a little further down the hall so that he could take in the next canvas. This one was of a patch of snowy woodland, the peeling trunks of tall silver birches gleaming through evening light. Again, it gave John a rather uneasy feeling. The trees were towering, outlined with sharp black lines as they disappeared overhead. There was no sign of life in the scene, but oddly it made him feel like there was someone waiting among the woods, just out of his line of sight.
He turned and stumbled back inside, pushing the door shut behind him. He collapsed back down on the floor, hating the tightness in his chest and the dry ache in his throat.
As it was new years eve, John had been expecting Violet to be wearing something even more dazzling and flamboyant than usual, but when she appeared at the top of the staircase she was wearing a very simple black silk dress. Her hair was caught up in a firm knot at the back of her head, and the only jewellery she wore was a pair of large diamond studs. Even her footwear was more restrained than usual, low leather pumps which looked supple with repeated wear. She caught his eye on the way down the stairs and grinned.
Phyllis edged past them, carrying a couple of glasses. “Goodness, what a gorgeous dress, Miss Vernet!” she sighed, looking at Violet’s green silk with good-natured envy. “It’s almost the exact colour of a scarab shell.”
Violet let out a long breath, and sighed before turning towards the pantry door. She picked up the handgun John had placed on one of the high shelves of the dresser, and released the safety with an unexpected ease. Anthea watched her with interest, sliding her phone back into the pocket of her jeans. Violet caught his eye.
looking man, John thought – medium height, medium build, with a blandly good-natured face that one would struggle to describe after any time apart. His accent was similarly vague; rather nondescript with only faint traces of London and Lancashire, as Violet had described. When he pulled off his knitted hat, his hair was neatly trimmed and a completely unexceptional shade of light brown. His round blue eyes opened a little wider at the sight of John and Sherlock and he smiled a little uneasily at them.
“Well we can’t do much for her here.” John murmured. “There’s a possibility that she might need peritoneal lavage and I’m assuming you’re not set up for that at the local surgery.”
“Welcome to Hilderbogie, Patrick!” Mr. Brodie smiled. “I take it you’re one of Violet’s painting pals, then?”
He walked silently beside Mycroft as they made their way to the hall. The house seemed so different now, all the colours of the paintings seeming to glow in the new bright light.
He was more than half hard by the time his hand reached his cock and he inhaled deeply as he trailed his fingers gently over the length of his growing erection. He remembered the way Sherlock had kissed him in the hallway, the way the man had felt in his arms that morning, moaning his name... grinding his hard cock against John's. The way his beautiful mouth had latched onto John's erect nipple as he came...
Sherlock was hammering on the kitchen door, which appeared to have been bolted on the other side. “Vi! Are you alright?”
“Eighteen customers were in the shop on the twenty second.” Sherlock said, after scanning the relevant page for less than a second. “Ogilvie; Swires; McIndoe; Brodie; Murchan; Mackie; Smith; Angus; Duncan; Jameson…”
them to anyone.” Sherlock continued, batting his hand away. “I was merely attempting to lighten the mood earlier.”
“Explains what?” John chuckled, rescuing the ice-bucket before she knocked it off the wrought iron platform and into the pond below.
“Oh, good.” said Mr Antonelli, relaxing a fraction.
Murdy’s spine straightened, and she stared around the group, taking in their tense faces and the way Anthea had hastily begun to consult a new alert on her blackberry. “Where. Is. He?”
He hadn’t thought to bring anything more formal than his usual button-down shirts and warm jumpers – when they had been leaving Baker Street, he had assumed that they would only need clothing for tramping round the wintry countryside. After settling for an only slightly crumpled white twill shirt, he paused with his fingers halfway to his buttons.
John stared down at his notebook, feeling uneasy.
“I wanted to call her Caroline, after my grandmother. God knows who her father is.” He stared hard at the fire, attempting to quell the blind fury and grief. There was panic there too, threatening to overwhelm him. The life he had mapped out had somehow dissolved so quickly. He didn’t feel capable of saying anything else, possibly ever again.
“It’s nice of you to let her use it.” John said absently.
Sherlock shook his head, rinsing his cut-throat razor in the basin. “Still some business to take care of first.”
“Just. Just to be clear. I know we haven’t said anything about this. But. Um. I don’t want to be with anyone else. I only want to be with you.”
He couldn’t hear George’s reply, if there was one. But after a moment he heard a heavy clattering noise and a harsh scraping sound; possibly the kitchen table being dragged or pushed across the tiled floor.
The battered and bloody members of the blue team howled with delight and jeered the losing team with huge glee. The red team stood around, looking dismal and sulky. Patrick leaned against one of the broken walls of the church, looking thoroughly put-out as the woman who beat him grinned at him from her place at the side of her leader. She had gone on to best two more members of the red team, and she was positively drenched in gore.
“Don’t worry, I asked Ms. Gothford to stay out of our room for the rest of our stay,” came Sherlock’s voice, accompanied by the slam of the heavy carved bedroom door.
“Jesus Christ!” Lestrade seemed to sag slightly at the sight of them, dropping what looked like half a pound of stilton and a box of biscuits on the table. “Where the hell have you been?!”
charming to her for the remainder of your acquaintance, I will not only tell Basil everything about your less than salubrious origins
“And it had nothing to do with the fact that he once overcharged you for a ninety-nine last May.” Petty pointed out drily, coming over to join them. She smiled tightly at Sherlock and John. “I really hope you two can back up those claims, by the way.”
He waited for a minute, watching as they disappeared between the trees before reaching for the key in the ignition once again. Sherlock had remained still and silent throughout the encounter, but at this small movement his gloved hand shot out and grasped John’s wrist tightly.
She propped her chin on her hand and grinned a slightly dreamy, malicious grin. “Oh, what I wouldn’t give to be there when she finds out….”
“Oh, so you have been watching the house then?” John asked, still reeling a little.
Menzies gaped at him, his face scarlet. John placed his bare foot over Sherlock’s, and gave him a warning look. Sherlock rolled his eyes and sighed.
“What’s the matter?” John asked. It was the usual mess: a minor spill of milk; a few lumps of cold scrambled egg scattered across the formica. Three perfect, untouched florets of steamed broccoli on the edge of a yellow plastic Hey Duggie plate.
Some of them had obviously come from tombs and holy places! They had no right to take them away!”
“Oh, dear.” John tried to imagine this, but failed miserably.
there. His deep inhalation; chest moving against my back. Warm, so warm. Tipping his head back sleepily; can feel the point of his chin sliding against C2 vertebra.
“This! This case, in this place. You just can’t help yourself, can you?”
Forcing himself upright to straddle the branch, he began to pull off his heavy jacket; cursing the tightly laced boots he wore. Dimly, back on the bank he could hear Sherlock swearing and tearing off his coat as he made for the icy water. He only looked around, however, when he heard Sherlock’s hoarse shout of warning – turning just in time to see Murdy throwing herself straight into the depths of the dark river.
Never mind that they had spent hours glaring at Ordnance Survey maps of Brighton, trying to find the location of a disused furriery where a wealthy financier’s husband was being held captive. There had been no Christmas dinner or exchange of gifts, just a brief and exhilarating hostage situation that culminated in Sherlock disarming and rather too enthusiastically punching a large man who had had the nerve to point a gun at John.
John swallowed hard. “Soon. I promise they’ll be here soon, Patrick. Don’t try to talk; just focus on staying awake.”
when you last wore it. You must have filled out a bit since then. I certainly have.”
Phyllis smiled and blinked rapidly, looking down at her dark blue chiffon frock and the long rope of pearls she wore over it. “Oh! Um, thank you Doctor Watson. I thought I’d make a bit of an effort this evening. Violet always wears such lovely things, and Hilary too…” she trailed off, watching as Hilary laughed politely at some feeble joke Menzies was evidently making.
Sherlock looked down at him with a familiar expression of fondness and impatience. “Don’t be ridiculous, John. Men and women have been dancing together all evening; it happens all the time when there are unequal number of partners.”
“So Sherlock used to go and stay with you in Aberdeenshire quite a lot, then?” John asked.
“But I liked it too.” Sherlock protested, looking a little confused. “I got to measure the difference of the range of motion in your scapulae; I’ve wanted to do that for ages!”
And with this declaration, he jogged away from the ruins, past the straggling trees and into the darkness. The crowd followed him rapidly, with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Some of them were limping from real injuries sustained in the fight. The last to leave were the mournful looking musicians. The cellist heaved her case onto her back and trudged away downhill, thoroughly downcast. The violinist and drummer picked up the lanterns and followed her, leaving the clearing in darkness once more.
Mycroft got to his feet and began to examine the burnt out shell with his torch, stooping to peer inside. There was a horribly charred shape in the remains of the drivers seat, but he only spared it a passing, incurious glance. “He can’t have gotten too far on foot in the time since the crash.”
“By this time, Philip had come to realise that I wasn’t stupid. I still clammed up whenever he was around; he scared me still. And he disappeared frequently for several days or weeks at a time. But eventually, he took over where Hedda left off. He started taking me to galleries, to auctions. He showed me the art collections owned by the family, a lot of which was kept in a special climate controlled room in the cellars of the house. Other items were kept in a storage facility in Bergen. He taught me about pigments, about technique, about canvases and style. I didn’t really understand at first why he put so much emphasis on the physical nature of the paintings; he didn’t seem to care very much about what the artist was trying to say. He didn’t seem to have any kind of sense of beauty; he didn’t seem to feel much about the paintings. He simply didn’t understand when I would linger for as long as possible in front of one work and not another, particularly if it was deemed to be less valuable. He was impatient and scathing if I forgot something he taught me, so I had to be quick. When I proved myself capable of absorbing everything he told me, he set about teaching me to draw. No, not draw per se… to copy. He would make me sketch a painting ten times in a day, over and over again. I hadn’t known that I could draw before, because I’d never had the chance. But I was good at it, even he could see that. But he didn’t care about the things I drew for myself. It made him angry, even. He didn’t want me to develop a style, because of course he was only interested in the styles of others.
Sherlock peered through the small window at knee height and grimaced. “It’s a rather small establishment, and the bar is right next to the door. He’ll see us if we follow him in.”
Sherlock huddled a little deeper into his jacket, trying to marshal his unruly thoughts. There were just so many to choose from, now that his brain had begun to approach normal levels of function.
John’s bewilderment was broken by a quiet giggle from Violet, who had turned around to face him. Her eyes were a little red and her hair was slightly disarranged, but she was smiling. “Oh, dear, laddie. The
“And these are?” he asked, curiously.
of your mind...”
It didn’t mean that things were plain sailing, but John had managed to stop worrying quite so much about Sherlock. For obvious and slightly heart breaking reasons, there were still limits in place and compromises that had to be made. But now that John knew more clearly where the lines were drawn, it was much easier to relax. He had stopped agonising over whether he was holding Sherlock too tightly; if his weight on Sherlock’s body was too much or if the gentle drag of his teeth over the pale skin would spook him.
Sherlock didn’t seem inclined to say any more, and John certainly wasn’t going to ask him for more detail. He was glad that Sherlock was facing away from him. It meant that he couldn’t see the tears that were slowly inching their way down his face. Sherlock didn’t need to see that.
Murdy cast a scathing look at her mutinous younger sisters, and sighed. “Flossie is Mrs. Dalhousie’s rotten little Pomeranian, and a Flossie special is a snowball which is fashioned with a surprise in the middle. I think what with being detectives, the pair of you can figure out the rest.”
“He’s right, beastie. Go home, this instant.” Violet agreed. “This is no place for you.”
He had come this far. There was no point in turning back now.
The minister was already a silhouette heading down the lane that led towards the schoolhouse and Miss Argyle’s cottage.
Sherlock laughed quietly, and ran his tongue torturously slowly along the crease behind John’s left ear. “What sort of things would you like me to do to you, my dear John?” he whispered, his voice low and intimate. “I could stroke your penis right here in the hallway. You couldn’t make too much noise; I think Mrs. Hudson is at home. You’d have to stay so, so quiet for me. Or you could lie down on the stairs while I kneel between your thighs and fellate you, rolling your testicles between my fingers. You could come all over my face, but you’d have to stay quiet while I take you apart, bit by bit…”
“No, they’re not.” Sherlock said, with more than a hint of laughter in his voice.
“Oh, fuck.” Violet took his hand and squeezed it. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I really will arrange his death, if you like.”
John peered through some trailing vines, trying to catch a glimpse of the garden where the unlikely trio were still practicing their shooting. “What is the situation with those two, do you think? Katy’s not in love with Phyllis, is she?”
“Yes, Inspector Menzies!” John said, exasperated. “It’s really him. Look, can you come round here or get the local police to come? It’s bloody cold, it smells disgusting and some local wankers tried to beat us up earlier. I really would like to get back to Edinburgh before midnight, if it’s all the same to you.”
“Of course not.” John agreed. “She was quite young, wasn’t she?”
[Christ!]
Katy smiled a little grimly. “You mean so many suspects, I expect.” she sighed a little. “I don’t doubt that you and Mr. Holmes are trying your best. In truth, I’m mainly concerned about getting the students out of here – Inspector Menzies still won’t clear them all to leave. What that man is doing, I have no idea. He’s about as much use as a chocolate kettle.”
The front door banged loudly.
“Hey! That was ours!” Pruny said indignantly.
once you’ve had a nice, conciliatory conversation and you realise what you could have. What you’ve been missing this past year and a half. Go, and sort it out before you miss your chance.”
“Right.” John turned another page. “Blimey, look at Sherlock’s gran. I don’t think I’d have liked to have faced her over the breakfast table every morning.”
“Oh thank goodness, you’ve come!” she answered shakily, catching sight of them. “Thank god. You’ve got to help.”
“If only we lived in Victorian times, eh?”
John thought about this as they unpacked; or rather he unpacked while Sherlock typed on his phone furiously. “But if he was so traditional-“
Barnsmore Carpets was the nearest in relation to the train station, and the taxi pulled up outside after about fifteen minutes. During the short trip, John had watched the stately old buildings of the city centre give way to modern industrial buildings and grim tower blocks of flats. There were very few trees and there was a mean, oppressive feel to the bleak stretch of road they stopped on. John felt his hackles rise slightly as he spotted a group of teenage boys kicking over a collection of dustbins further down the street. An elderly couple walked past swiftly, arm in arm and with their eyes carefully downcast. It was obvious that they were eager not to attract attention.
Sherlock huffed and stretched out his own legs. “John is extremely boring about me not smoking, Violet.”
Violet stopped dead on the threshold of the kitchen, her hand clutching at the doorframe. John frowned, speeding up so that he could come and peer over her shoulder.
There was a brief shower of snow from one of the larger oaks, followed by a lanky figure dropping from a wide branch overhead and landing catlike below. Murdy Antonelli grinned at her younger sisters, tucking her ungloved hands deep into the pockets of her slightly shabby long green coat.
Oh, god.
“Oh, come on. Look at the bloke!” John snorted. “He must have people coming on to him all the time.”
“But Mrs. Duncan said that they were friends!” John exclaimed. “Would Miss Argyle be willing to endanger her friend’s life like that?”
“SHAN'T! WON'T!” Violet’s voice rang out, but she thankfully chose not to come in. “Look, I’m quite sure that John is a complete champion at oral sex; he’s got that look about him. But you’ll want to see this, I promise! You can resume the rumpy-pumpy later. Get your arses down to the kitchen, we’ve got something to show you!”
“And what’s that, then?” Hector asked curiously.
“And you still cannot understand my concern?!” Mycroft hissed.
“What’s the magic word?” Mary asked, with a faint smile. He knew she could tell how he was trying to keep the depths of his anger suppressed. Her tone was sweet, and entirely calculated to goad him.
[Pull yourself together. There are over three million Armenians in the world. Harman’s dead. You saw pictures of his corpse. He was very, very dead, if you care to recall? Mind working terrifyingly slowly.
I wanted to know
John studied Sherlock’s face intently, which was easier now that the mans eyes were still closed. His face was tense and a little anxious. “But you see, I realised last night that sometimes one does have to say things out loud. That the act of saying them is... significant.”
“So the murder investigation is being prolonged for the sake of amusement. How novel.” Mycroft said, raising his eyebrows. “However Violet, as I was just saying to Sherlock, I think it best for everyone concerned that he returns to London with me this afternoon. I’m
“Poor you, how
Phyllis shook her head. “No. And I can’t tell them. I know that people always say that their families ‘knew all along’, that it was no great surprise. But I know very well that if my family suspected, they’d disown me. It’s an awful thing, Doctor Watson. To know, deep down and for sure, that the people who you love that much would push you away. It’s not the money; it’s knowing that I’d have nowhere to go at Christmas. Not getting a birthday card from my gran anymore.”
Sherlock nodded, shutting his eyes and burrowing into his makeshift bed of straw-filled sacking and John’s jacket.
Sherlock inhaled deeply. “I want to tell you that I’m glad that you’re my friend, John,” he said after a long pause. “That I value your company more than I can say.”
John had no choice but to bury his face in Sherlock’s chest to muffle his laughter, his shoulders shaking. He grasped the lapels of Sherlock’s coat, hanging on for dear life and hoping against hope that no-one could hear him.
He spotted Petty Antonelli after a moment, her hands grasping those of her sister Griz and another pretty dark-haired girl he could only assume was their elder sibling, Toni. They weaved in an undulating line, in and out of arches formed by the raised arms of their partners and the sound of stamping feet was positively thunderous as they returned to their places. John couldn’t help but grin when he spied Rab and Pruny at the end of one line, dragging the unfortunate Pheemy at breakneck speed (and distinctly ahead of the tempo) up and down the hall. Mr. Antonelli himself was sitting to one side and looked reassuringly healthy, and he was laughing aloud as the twins whooped and drummed their feet. Pheemy looked flustered and protested breathlessly as the twins ran, her long mauve flowered skirt billowing behind her.
This time, the silence stretched on for considerably longer. John became aware that they were garnering some attention from passers-by, standing as close as they were. Some small part of him was faintly surprised by just how little he cared; pressed up against a man in public.
“I don’t really see the point in making accusations, Mr. Holmes.” Patrick said quietly, returning his gaze to Sherlock. “I’m quite sure that you will
“It’s only a little noise, when a blade enters deeply into a living human body. But usually quite audible. Before the blood begins to spill.”
Violet smirked slightly. “I suppose you could say that old habits die hard. I sign my work these days, but I never used to. Not back then. I never intended to sell these, anyhow – so I never much saw the point. This is the only bit of the house that ever really felt
He stripped off his awful, bloodsoaked pajamas and sweater and kicked away the wretched, scratching pine boughs he had stuffed beneath them. He stood naked in front of the fire, turning slowly as the heat touched his sore, clammy skin. Whichever side was furthest from the flames immediately erupted into gooseflesh so intense it was almost painful; but it was worth it for the sensation of dryness and fleeting warmth. He hung his wet things up to dry over a broken chair and pulled the jacket back on; the inside at least had stayed dry and the fleece lining felt almost transcendently soft against his torso. His arse and legs were unfortunately still freezing, but once he sat on one of the sacks of straw he was at least marginally more comfortable.
Sherlock fixed him with a scathing glance, his ears turning slightly pink. John grinned at him.
“I swear I didn’t invite him.” Violet said vehemently. “You do believe me, don’t you? I know I said I reckoned you should talk to him again, but I’d never muck about like that behind your back, old thing.”
“Well, there was barely any room left in the church hall, and he hadn’t been able to find a partner until then.” Mr. Antonelli said mildly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes in a put-upon fashion and held out his hand to Violet. “Come along, ghastly wench. We haven’t danced together in some time. I assume you can keep up?”
Murdy beamed.
John didn’t move. “What do you want?”
“When was the last time you saw Garcia?” Sherlock asked, casually lifting John’s forearm from the edge of his chair and checking the watch on his wrist. This seemed to rankle with Marmaduke, who cleared his throat viciously.
“The mind reading thing? Not particularly sexy, you know.” John muttered, gasping a little as Sherlock bit down on his earlobe. He pulled the tails of Sherlock’s shirt out of the back of his trousers and ran his fingers up the hard ridge of his spine, chuckling a little as Sherlock hissed at the coldness of his fingertips. “Come on, let’s get under the covers before we lose any extremities to frostbite.”
“I know! I know! Not allowed to fall in love with Violet, no matter how well she cooks. Honestly, Sherlock, I promise I’m not going to suddenly decide to leave London and shack up with her, even if she decided she fancied me. Which, incidentally, she doesn’t.”
“Of course she wasn’t.” Murdy said, suddenly appearing at his shoulder. She was wrapped tightly in a voluminous velvet dressing gown that clearly belonged to Violet and a heavy blanket around her shoulders.  She had clearly made an attempt to dry her shaggy dark hair and it stood out around her head like a haystack. “Why would you think she was?”
“And slowly, she started pointing out the differences between the editions; the types of paper and ink. The different styles of hand in the earlier handwritten manuscripts. How you could identify the components of ink by smell and texture on the paper. It was the first time someone taught me something ungrudgingly. And I thrived on it; I spent hours and hours studying the variations between materials, learning the differences between vellum, parchment and all the hundreds of different kinds of paper. It didn’t take her as long as she thought to teach me all about the library collections; within six months I think my knowledge rivalled hers. She was clever enough not to resent this, and she decided to start me on the art collections.
“Correction. Mrs. Duncan said that Miss Argyle was
“Mm. Well, I’ve never been offered it.” Sherlock said absently, as he studied the envelope closely.
man, really.” Sherlock said quietly. “And I was rude to him. I ignored him. I laughed at him, thinking him such an idiot for choosing to stay here rather than focussing on his own interests. Marrying to keep my grandmother happy.”
Sherlock sighed hugely. Both men ended up lying rather closer than planned, side by side in the middle. “This bed was owned by my great-grandfather Albert. He was very morbidly obese and I expect the shape of the blasted mattress is entirely his fault. Mycroft obviously inherited those particular genes.”
He remembered compulsively visiting that stretch of pavement outside Barts for weeks after Sherlock had fallen. He looked at the broken paving stone, imagined that there were still traces of blood in the cracks. He had felt nauseous and beyond wretched, plagued with recriminations, with wild ideas of what he could have done to change what had happened that day. He had had to stop himself going back there eventually; it had been the only way he could continue to function in any way. Even now, safe in the knowledge that it had all been false, he still felt sick at the thought.
“That’s right, you odious tick.” Violet muttered darkly as he rounded the tree. “Spoil my illusions.”
(Well, that and the fact that he had had designs on John’s boyf… partn… on his detective.)
“Ten thousand pounds. In cash, no less.” Basil laughed a little humourlessly. “I don’t know where she got the idea that I could simply walk into the bank and take out ten thousand pounds in cash. That I could just take out that kind of money and not have the manager telephone my father within minutes. All my money is in a trust, you see – any major withdrawals need to be approved by my Pa. She was... rather put out. I gave her a grand, it was all I could manage. She wasn’t terribly pleased, but it was the best I could do.”
Of course, it was common enough in Scotland to see men in kilts; he had seen several on the streets of Edinburgh back in October and after the first double take it somehow became normal. They were just an alternative to a smart pair of trousers, after all. He knew better than to think of kilts as skirts; whenever he saw men wearing them they seemed to be worn with a defiantly masculine swagger. But Sherlock in a kilt… the thought was just plain bizarre. Or at least it had been, until he saw him in the crowded hall full of dancers. It was a hasty shot, some of the figures blurred in motion. Sherlock was standing to one side, raising a glass to his mouth as he surveyed the room. He was wearing a well-cut dark jacket and waistcoat over a sharply pleated tartan kilt that hung in a frankly
“Will you do it again?” John asked, probably a little too eagerly. He wriggled up the bed a few more inches, so that his head was level with Sherlock’s.
Sherlock slowly raised his left eyebrow in marked disapproval. John fought the urge to giggle. It took all of five seconds before Basil cracked.
“I say, Doctor Watson… you still don’t think you’ll need to say anything to Hilary about… um. Anything? To do with poor Sandra, I mean?” he asked, in a quietly pleading manner.
.” Sherlock laughed a little and seemed to relax slightly. They lapsed into silence again.
Violet stood in the snow, bundled up in an extravagantly flared cobalt blue coat, a white fur hat on her beautifully arranged curls. A bulging paper bag from Antonelli’s grocery hung from the crook of her elbow. Her suede gloved hands rested on her hips, and her face fell when she caught sight of Murdy’s distraught expression.
, cloth-ears.”
I know you intended arriving on the 30th, but for the love of god won’t you come early and help out a bit?
“Nobody could tell me anything! I’ve been damn well holed up here since last night. I arrived just in time to see your ex-wife being bundled into the back of an army truck in bloody shackles. The special ops buggers who took her away said they weren’t at liberty to say where she was going!”
Murdy cast John an imploring look as she hastily lifted the book off the stone floor.
He knocked quietly at one of the doors. “Vi?” he called softly.
going to be another murder.” His expression grew meaningful. “And coffee, of course.”
“How nice for you both!”
“But you did!  You hardly ever use those blasted abbreviated words in your texts any more.” Sherlock said this proudly, as if John was a slow but promising pupil. “Not to mention those stupid little punctuation-faces. There is simply no excuse for punctuation-faces, John.”
John gasped, and tried to pull himself together. “Oh god, your face. When she called you
“They’re looking after him, in there.” Violet said quietly, after a pause. She gestured towards the door of Patrick’s room, which still stood a little ajar. “We’ll be in the kitchen.”
“How dreadful.” Sherlock murmured sadly, letting the heel of his shoe land heavily on John’s instep. Without moving his gaze from Miss Argyle’s face he seemed to have sensed that John was seconds away from giggling. John tried not to wince and nodded as sympathetically as he could.
“Nicely done, Doctor Watson.” Sherlock said approvingly. John smothered a smile. “Quite right. The first time it was sealed, it was done precisely and neatly. It wasn’t done hurriedly. The first time it was re-sealed, it was done a little more clumsily but equally precisely; presumably by Freddie Garcia, and while he was under the influence of the drug. The second time it was re-sealed, it was even messier. Possibly while the person was high, possibly they were in a hurry. I would lean towards being in a hurry, as the ends of the tape aren’t pressed down fully, which they were previously.”
At this point, Sherlock had stopped walking. They were around half way across the Millennium bridge, heading towards the market. It was a chilly, damp afternoon and the light was already fading from the sky. London seemed noisy, jarringly modern and a little frenetic compared to the refined outskirts of Edinburgh. They had been walking for twenty minutes, close but silent, both lost in their own thoughts.
“Everything all right?” John inquired, peering at the tracks that he and Sherlock had been following with a certain amount of dismay. The piebald had smudged and scattered the snow, and it was unlikely that they would find the prints again so easily.
This was not the modern, well laid out kind of graveyards that John had visited in the past. Sherlock’s grave had been in a quiet corner of Caldwell cemetery, which wasn’t exactly modern but was positively brand-new compared to this place. Huge tombs and ruined mausoleums lined the high ivy-covered walls, many of them decorated with weathered carved stone skulls, crossbones, chains and hourglasses. The whole place had an air of abandonment and prolonged neglect. John stubbed his toe badly on the edge of a collapsed headstone and bit his lip to stop himself from crying out. He knew better than to be unsettled by the place; after all the inhabitants of a graveyard were unlikely to pose a threat. And yet there was something in the atmosphere, a dour unfriendly feel that made him feel increasingly on edge.
“You see…” Sherlock sighed, pushing the tangled sheets down a little and resting his head on his outstretched arm as he faced John fully, “You see… I’ve come to the conclusion that if you want it so much, we can try it again.”
“Hello.” John put down his copy of Private Eye on the table between them. “You missed breakfast.”
“I do. And I like having you undo them.” Sherlock smiled, stepping closer and wrapping his arms around John.
“We’ll all be dead, so why should it matter?” Sherlock shrugged, and grabbed John’s wrist. “Come along, you’ve warmed up. We have approximately seventy minutes before dinner, and I’m planning on making the most of them.” He began to tow John swiftly towards the wide staircase. “I have to make good on my promise to Miss Argyle, after all…”
“No. I’m not going to.” she said bluntly, her expression fierce. “I’ve got something to show you.”
“What, then?”
“Patrick.” Sherlock nodded coolly. He shook the man’s hand when it was offered, although perhaps there was the slightest moment of hesitation in the movement. John did his absolute best not to watch Patrick carefully as he greeted Sherlock. He absolutely did
Another picture, this time of Violet and Sherlock together on a sunny afternoon. Violet was wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat and reclined in a striped deck-chair with a sketchbook in her lap. Sherlock was hunched on the grass, wearing shorts and a washed out t-shirt; his long legs startlingly bare and his knees alarmingly knobbly. In the picture he was looking up at Violet as he rolled a cigarette. He was unsmiling but his expression was unmistakeably unguarded, his attention utterly committed to whatever Violet was in the middle of telling him. Neither figure seemed aware of the photographer. They seemed to be in their own private world.
The door swung shut behind him, but not before he caught sight of the comically outraged look on the detectives face.
Basil stared at the napkin he held clenched between his shaking hands, and didn’t say anything.
“And so he bloody well ought!” Violet said, reaching out to take a hearty swig from the bottle herself. “If this doesn’t bring him to his stupid senses, I don’t know what will.”
While many people had blood on their faces and clothes, they didn’t seem to be suffering unduly. The fighting was enthusiastic but he was yet to see anyone who seemed seriously injured.
“No, ‘fraid not.” one of the men said briskly, but not unsympathetically. “Not if we need to keep her on the stretcher.”
John shivered, becoming aware that he was still holding Sherlock’s scarf like some kind of talisman. There was a faint chilly breeze, and it brought occasional wafts of the foul odour from the caravan’s open doors and windows. John buried his face in the scarf again, breathing in the comforting scent once more. He wasn’t quite sure what all the various elements were; certainly the medicinal scent of Sherlock’s ridiculously expensive shampoo from Penhaglion’s, and a whiff of the decadent Indian sandalwood soap they had both used in the bathroom at Violet’s house. There was something else there, though. He supposed it was just the smell of the man’s skin, as he remembered it from that morning; waking up with his nose pressed into the skin below Sherlock’s right ear.
[Don’t. Not dead, Sherlock. I’m not dead, you’d know if I were dead.]
“Who the fuck smokes opium these days?!” Violet asked incredulously. “I mean, it can’t be easy to source; can it?”
“And?” Violet asked, her eyes narrowed and the challenge clear in her voice.
“No, John. He was not. I suspect Mr. Garcia was heading for another, much closer spot. Given his speeding on the M8, and the first letter of the postcode, Garcia is in Glasgow.” Sherlock whipped out his phone and began googling rapidly. “More specifically, the London Road in Glasgow. Just a moment...” he began studying a map of the road in question. “Damn, it’s a very long road. But it shouldn’t take too long to narrow down the number of premises beginning with the letters ‘Barn’”.
“Only from Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock said firmly. “A maximum of twice per week.”
“So. Um. Working on anything in particular?” he asked, in a brave attempt at nonchalance. He glanced curiously over at the sketchpad she had dropped on the end of the table.

“No we’re not!” Pruny insisted, looking outraged. “Well not

Benjy, who had hissed crossly when he landed on the floor, began to move slowly across the edge of the fireplace towards Mycroft. Violet watched her cat with something approaching outrage as he casually leapt onto the arm of Mycroft’s armchair, and allowed him to gently tickle him behind his ears.
Four months, really. If he was being honest. Four months since the blood had sung in his veins and his heart thrummed and he had felt sick and heady and on a knife edge of panic and so, so

“I’m about to make some more. This is for Mr. Brodie; he’ll be along in a moment.” Violet screwed the lid onto the flask tightly and placed it down on the table next to the door.
Basil tightened his fists, his face flushing a dull red as he narrowed the gap between them.
that would give them some evidence of Sherlock’s journey this way.
And part of John wondered if he was just imagining it, if he was just projecting something that still hung around stubbornly in the back of his mind and refused to go away entirely. But he doubted that Violet would have been so intrigued by the work if it were merely a straightforward rendering of nature.
"Not for a while. Not since she told Hilary off in no uncertain terms before offering to help her out if she could." John smiled reminiscently. He was still tremendously impressed by the earlier scene
“Who cares about normal? You just might not have realised what floats your boat. Kissing one handsy schoolboy isn’t a defining moment. You might find out that you’re only attracted to strapping Bavarian wenches called Helga. Or accountants. Or lamp-posts. Or goldfish.”
Hector grimaced. “Miss Vernet is certainly very kind, Mr. Holmes. But-“
“Where were you going?”
“That’s Sherlock’s older brother.” he muttered darkly. “Not my favourite person in the world.”
“Or music, or research, or anything that isn’t Moriarty!” John insisted, his jaw tightening. “Jesus, Sherlock. What would you do if he died? What if he just never comes back? Just stare at the walls for the rest of your life?”
“Oh, Petty, you don’t need to rush off! Stay for some breakfast at least-“ Violet protested, making her way over to the woman, who actually was more of a girl now that John looked more closely. She shook her head decisively, pulling a knitted hat down over her ears.
is Patrick’s big secret? He likes doing a bit of role playing?!”
He studied Violet surreptitiously as she drew, watching her small neat hand move swiftly across the page. She was back to her usual polished self this morning, and her red curls were carefully arranged in a heavy knot at the nape of her neck. She wore a tightly fitted wool dress in a vivid shade of acid green, the full skirt pulled loosely over her propped-up knees. A pair of shocking pink suede pumps lay discarded on the tiles next to the battered sofa, surrounded by pencil shavings and discarded sheets of paper. She was frowning slightly as she worked, a sharp crease between her beautifully arched eyebrows. He craned his neck slightly, trying to catch a glimpse of her drawing.
. I propose at that point we head in opposite directions for a spell, and reconvene at the same point. It would make sense to cover the banks of the river in both directions, just in case he reached it and was unable to continue.”
“Yes indeed, brother mine. Is there an end to all this in sight?” Mycroft sighed, reaching wearily for the wine. “Mr. Singh, may I offer you some more?”
“But with a few conditions.” Sherlock murmured, knotting his fingers in the sheets. “I’ve come up with a few ideas about how to approach the issue.”
“Just a moment.” Anthea answered, sweeping to the large old fridge and wrenching the door to the freezer compartment open. She reached inside and rummaged around briefly, before emerging with a large ice-covered clear bottle. With an admirable efficiency, she uncorked it with a loud pop; raised it to her lips and took a large gulp.
John nodded woodenly. Sherlock pushed past him and sank into one of the worn chairs near the fireplace, closing his eyes for a long moment. He sighed and waved a hand at Lestrade in exasperation. “Well? That hardly explains why on earth you are
“Gosh, Greg will be chuffed to hear you consider him a colleague rather than a general dogsbody.”
The students were sitting at a long dark wooden table in an impressive high-ceilinged and frescoed room. They all turned to face the late arrivals inquisitively, and as he took his seat John quickly tried to match up the names he knew with the unfamiliar faces in front of him. Unsurprisingly most of their eyes were on Sherlock, who sat down silently on his right.
gesture, Sherlock. I’m not going to apologise for it; but if it makes you feel any better I promise it won’t happen again.”
“Well, it seems clear that the poisoner was behind this hoax as well…” Patrick mused, sitting down and fishing his glasses from his dressing gown pocket. He leaned towards the box to get a better view.
“Hnngh.” With an effort, Sherlock swallowed and attempted to push himself up on hands and knees. This failed abysmally, and the man looked at him with concern as he crashed painfully back to the floor.
“Well, I was going to take it back with me, but Miss Argyle didn’t have anything else to put my stuff into. Well, she
“I really don’t think you’re in any position to judge anyone about the contents of their fridge.” John pointed out. “What’s Mycroft doing in Geneva, anyway?”
The press of their lips is tentative. God knows this is new to him, but it also feels like a slide into the inevitable. Sherlock’s still on his knees in front of John and his breathing is hitching, hands gripping John’s upper arms like he’s scared to let go. It’s strange to wrap his arms round the large angles of Sherlock, to feel the softness of his lips and the rasp of his cheek. His mouth is lush and warm as he lets John in, an odd helpless sound slipping from his throat.
Sherlock hummed and shrugged; non-committal. “The Reverend certainly seems anxious enough to suggest it. She’s taken her coat and she’s in familiar surroundings. Even if she were to collapse she would be surrounded by familiar people and neighbours. People who would undoubtedly notice almost at once and take care of her. It’s possible he’s more concerned that people will see her in an intoxicated state rather than merely weakened by the atropine poisoning.”
“It would still require a certain amount of distraction.” Sherlock said, in between large mouthfuls of his second helping of pasta. “Accessing the tonic would be simple enough; but the act of injecting the bottles would take considerably longer. It had to be done with precision and care, next to the rim of the bottle where the puncture mark would be destroyed when the seal was broken. To do that to four bottles? At least forty-five seconds, but probably longer.”
John blinked, and looked down at Sherlock’s feet which were encased in thick hiking socks and unlaced heavy boots. They were better protected from the elements than the rest of him, but he supposed that he must still be freezing due to poor circulation.
(What is going on inside his head right now? He might as well be light years away.)
She gave him a scathing look. “And who out of the three of us know this path better?”
"Excellent. Now, have you seen Phyllis anywhere?"
“Blimey.” John murmured, catching his eye. “Will you be buying me flowers next?”
The man shrugged. “I do not believe that Freddie was a particularly good man. I did not like him much. He was tediously oversexed and I don’t think he treated Sandra particularly well. But just because a man is not agreeable does not make him a murderer.”
As soon as she was clear, Katy swung her reloaded shotgun back up to her shoulder and aimed carefully. She double checked that Phyllis was safely back at her side, before shouting “Clear!” loudly. Her aim was exquisite, the line of her shoulders and arms firm and true as she pulled the trigger. The gun kicked back strongly, but she held strong; the first two targets shattered and ricocheted in quick succession. Lowering the gun, Katy nodded approvingly.
He froze, on the very edge of jumping into the water; but Sherlock’s harsh shout caused him to pause. He couldn’t bring himself to look away from Murdy, who was striking out into the river in the roiling wake of Mrs. Duncan. Her hair was flattened and sleek against her skull as she moved through the water and he could hear her breath coming in loud sharp gasps, no doubt from the chill of the water.
John couldn’t stop thinking of Mycroft, waiting for him miles away; back on the riverbank. He knew that this detour was foolhardy in the extreme, that he was only endangering himself as well as the others by not sticking to the original plan. Christ, he might even be distracting them from the true direction Sherlock had taken. He might end up being responsible for losing Sherlock altogether.
Marmaduke was wearing another pair of alarmingly skinny jeans and a blue painting smock that was unbuttoned low enough to display the wispy gingerish hair on his bony sternum. John did not greet the man, but nodded curtly and attempted to give him a wide berth. Unfortunately George had other plans, and his hand shot out to grab John’s arm as he attempted to pass.
“You can’t let him be the most important thing in your life, Sherlock.” John said quietly, leaning back against the tree and wrapping his hands more securely round his cup. He seemed unwilling to look up into Sherlock’s impatient, expectant face. “Just… please. Don’t.”
Singh bestowed a last lingering smile on him, getting slowly to his feet. Ignoring John utterly, he strolled to the door and disappeared down the hall.
“I’ll tell you the rest some other time,” John muttered. Even if he had the inclination to explain the whole sorry Mary situation, he didn’t want to do it now. And certainly not under Anthea’s nose. “Back in London, I will buy you several pints and tell you the whole stupid story.”
“Oh, er- thanks.” he said, pulling them on. They weren’t his; they were new and fit his hands perfectly. Unlike Sherlock’s, which he knew from experience were far too large for him.
“Mister Holmes. Nice to meet you.” [definitely Marseilles.]
” Pruny sighed. “Come on, let’s go and get a closer look!”
Sherlock took a deep breath and covered John’s hand with his, holding his fingers tightly. John looked up into Sherlock’s face and smiled gently, taking this as a signal. “Come on. Let’s go to bed. You can’t stay down here all night.”
“Tell your dad we’ll come and explain everything tomorrow. I’m sorry if you’re in a heap of trouble,” said Violet. “You’ve been beyond brilliant, the pair of you.”
Little, inconsequential moments like this. They really shouldn’t still make such an impact, not really. He and Sherlock had been… whatever they were… for months now. He had initially worried that it would be difficult, being part of a couple. Being
“Yes. I’ve shut the caravan up again and I’ve called us a cab. No, hang on to that,” he added as John held out the dark blue cashmere scarf. “You forgot yours.”
Sherlock nodded, regretfully chasing the last crumbs around the bottom of the cake-tin with his index finger. The cake-fugue appeared to be receding and he seemed capable of speech once more. “Right. Where is it?”
“Oh, come on, Sherlock! What the hell was it, this incident? And who is Eulalie?”
Sherlock, who could be in Nicaragua or Skegness for all John knew. He hadn’t spoken to the man for almost a week, and that was a long time in Sherlock’s world.
Sherlock, who would undoubtedly say entirely all the wrong things.
“So does Vi really have pictures of you in the altogether?” John murmured thoughtfully, as Sherlock tugged at his sleeve and began to hustle him towards the wide stone staircase. “I’d be interested in having a look. Just out of idle curiosity, mind.”
Sherlock leaned his forehead against Johns and made a disgruntled sound. “Damn him.” he straightened up with a martyred expression, readjusting the lapels of his jacket back to their pristine lines. John wanted to rumple him badly. “I suppose I’d better try and get rid of him before Violet finds out he’s here.”
Murdy shook her head. “Not anymore; she just teaches primary school. There’s a bus that goes to Aberlochry, us older ones go to the high school there. Me and Griz and Pheemy. Miss Argyle kicked Rab and Pruny out of Sunday school; but they’ve still got the rest of the year at the school here.” Murdy gave a slightly lopsided smile. “They’ve tried their best to get kicked out of that too, but the Reverend Duncan keeps intervening on their behalf. They don’t thank him for it, not one bit.”
“Me too, you insufferable twat.”
The wave of shame that accompanied these thoughts made him feel almost ill, and he sank into one of the hard carved wooden chairs next to the huge unlit fireplace. Almost without conscious thought he delved into his pocket, pulling out his wallet and opening the battered leather with numb fingers. Behind his credit and debit cards, his driving license and a couple of old train tickets he found it; the charred and blackened piece of paper he had found in the fireplace of 221B, months ago.
John sat very still, hardly daring to breathe.
“Too bloody right. Poor Mrs. Antonelli, she was pregnant for a good chunk of her adult life before she kicked the bucket.” Violet grimaced, and placed a stack of scones on Sherlocks’ plate. He cleared this throat and glared at her meaningfully until she sighed and added another two to the pile. “John, hurry up and get some of these before this greedy swine eats them all.”
Sherlock’s hips bucked wildly and he let out a sharp moan, come striping his stomach and oozing over John’s fingers. John continued to lick at him until he heard the sharp intake of breath that suggested Sherlock was becoming too sensitive. Easing his way back up, he impulsively ran his tongue through the creamy, slightly bitter mess on Sherlock’s abdomen before wrapping his arms around his torso. Sherlock’s eyes were tightly shut, and his chest was heaving as he attempted to catch his breath. His hair was plastered to his face, and he made a weak sound of protest when John briefly took his arm away to drag the sheets up from the foot of the bed.
Sherlock read another. “’hey Sherlock can you help me figure out who stole my Auntie Bridget’s pacemaker?’ Well this individual uses the letter ‘u’ instead of bothering to spell the pronoun. I utterly refuse to help such an insufferable dolt. It’s the only way they’ll learn, John.” Given the faint thumping sounds coming from the desk it sounded as if this last message was being deleted with extreme prejudice.
Without waiting for a reply, he turned on his heel and walked away; not looking back. He didn’t respond to Violet calling after him, or Mr. Brodie’s cheery offer of a drink as he passed. His back was rigid as he disappeared through the archway, and John found himself glowering at the elder Holmes as he turned to greet them.
A brief, hellish surge towards lucidity. [Impatient. Marseille. Bleach blonde]
“Well as a matter of fact I have, lass. I saw her going into the drapers earlier, no doubt getting her finery for the ceilidh tonight. Why, what do you want her for?” he asked curiously.
“Oh, er. Good. As long as you’re happy.” John muttered, blushing furiously and ignoring the knowing grin that was slowly spreading across Lestrade’s face. “Why didn’t you wake me up, though? I’d have come with you.”
She broke off, and glared at the nurse nervously holding a tray at the end of her bed. The woman swallowed hard and made a brave attempt at a cheerful smile. “Excuse me, Miss Argyle? I’ve got some more tablets for you to take now.”
“Shouldn’t they, you know, be wearing fangs and cloaks or something?”
(Right. You’re not twelve. Pull yourself together, Watson. He’s just a bloody bureaucrat in a stupid waistcoat. Who could have you shipped off to Tasmania within a minute if he wanted to. Fuckety fuck fuck fuck!)
“Oh, er-“ he cast around a little wildly to try and get the conversation back on track just in case Sherlock decided to begin expounding on the innate irrationality of religion. “So, what sort of time did this happen then?”
“Yes. And I have a suspicion that it is attempting to eat me.” John replied gravely. The mattress was hugely thick and obviously several decades old; with the added weight of Sherlock it sagged even more in the middle.
“Probably picking up some stuff for Mrs. Duncan’s mince pies. She always makes them for after the church service on Christmas eve.” Murdy supplied, returning her attention to the list. “They’re
In the morning, John had wanted to leave them alone together, to say their goodbyes. But in the end, Violet had stood in the hall and grinned up into Sherlock’s face; merely saying: “So long, revolting article.”
“I was being an idiot. Nothing new there.” John said, after a brief internal struggle. “He seemed to think that you and I had some kind of sophisticated arrangement where you were alright with me having an affair with Violet.”
. Get me out. No sound. Going quietly, see…?]
“Had a look at it earlier. It’s stuffed with horsehair and concrete and is approximately three centimetres wide. By all means go and sleep on it if you like.”
“It’s not quite the same when you say it like
“His PA.” he murmured, and felt her relax a fraction at his side.
Without another word she hung up and John raced onwards, uncaring whether he tripped or fell as long as he managed to keep going. As he rounded the next bend he could make out the faint lights of Hilderbogie house in the distance. A second later he spied the low boundary wall of the estate, then the path and open gate that he and Sherlock had walked through earlier that day on their way to the village. The wild undergrowth and messy path gave way to a clean snowy expanse of gardens and lawn. He managed to pick up his pace, scanning the bank for the old wooden jetty that he had noticed the day before from the window of Sherlock’s room. The boathouse was screened by trees; but it was the sound of an old rowing boat rhythmically hitting the posts of the jetty that alerted him to its whereabouts; a dull heavy beat clearly audible above the smooth rush of the dark river.
“Well all I can say is that she must be having an off day.” Violet replied tartly. “I saw the land rover taking off down the driveway from my bedroom window upstairs. Just as it turned the corner out of the drive, I saw her sneaking round the corner of the house, ducking under the window sills and carrying a frankly ostentatious handgun. She seemed to be heading in the direction of the river. So I grabbed the first thing that came to hand, which turned out to be a half-size marble bust of Sir Walter Scott and dropped it on her head as she passed under my window. Out like a light. It was obvious there was something fishy afoot, so I thought it was the best course of action. I was fairly sure you wouldn’t mind.”
John shuffled a bit, trying to inch closer to the edge of the bed but after a few seconds he found himself sliding inexorably back towards the centre.
“Alright. Get off me then and lie down. I want to do this properly.” he murmured, raising his gaze to Sherlock’s face which was flushed and a little shy when he returned John’s smile. John’s heart clenched at the expression and he reached up to cup Sherlock’s face.
Stuck to the mirror above the dressing table was a photograph of Sandra with a young man whom John assumed was Freddie Garcia. In the picture, Sandra was laughing and looking a little to the left of whoever took the picture. Garcia had his arm loosely slung around her shoulders, and was staring into the lens unsmilingly. He was strong-featured, with dark eyes and hair and a full sensual mouth. John thought he looked arrogant, and slightly mean; but that could have just been the angle, or his conclusions based on the comments he had been hearing from everyone about the man.
“He’s a dreadful lightweight.” John mused. “He’ll be cross when he remembers lisping in front of us tomorrow.”
“I liked that cook, actually.” Violet mused. “Greta. She was rubbish at mayonnaise and her hollandaise was frankly laughable; but we had a power cut once and we couldn’t find any matches, so she taught me how to build a fire with sticks and twigs and pine needles. That was certainly useful, when I was out in the woods in winter. She’d grown up deep in the country, not many creature comforts. Taught me quite a lot that came in useful when I was avoiding him. A few times I had to stay out of the house overnight, so I needed to be able to face the cold.”
“Um. Er, Sherlock?” John murmured. “I mean, keep going. No problems here. But. I just want to give you fair warning...”
Four figures had split off from the main group, and had stationed themselves by the crumbling walls of the ruined church. An eerie, wailing noise cut through the silence and it took John a moment to realise that a young woman in a red sweater was playing a musical saw. To her right, a younger man was playing a violin, and to her left an older man was gently hitting a small round drum. A teenage girl sat nearby on a wooden box, playing a cello. The music was deeply strange, and rather mournful. It took him more than a few seconds to recognise the piece they were playing, although he had heard Sherlock perform it more than once. The Danse Macabre.
“You bloody better.” Violet warned, and turned to go. “I’ve got to have a look at the accounts, but I’ll see you two for lunch. Maybe after that you want to go to the hospital and have a chat with the victims?”
She smiled grimly, but with more than a trace of pride. “I think Basil was quite taken with the... idea of my tragic past. Quite the shining knight. He proposed after only a month. He set me up in a flat; paid my bills; made me an allowance. I
“Dull.” Sherlock said sniffily, standing up and proceeding to strip off his dressing gown and pajama bottoms.
“In here!”
“Clever.” John commented, sitting on the arm of Sherlock’s chair. “Will you open it?”
The promised break in the weather arrived, lightening the snowfall a little and allowing brief glimpses of murky sunlight to filter through the heavy grey clouds. As Violet and Anthea efficiently packed the jeeps with supplies, Patrick was carried downstairs and onto one of the military helicopters. John caught a brief glimpse of the young man strapped to a stretcher in the hall, his face pallid and eyes closed. He wore an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose and thankfully seemed to be breathing slightly more evenly.
Dinner that evening was an informal, slightly haphazard affair of what Violet termed ‘leftover tapas’ around the kitchen table. Sherlock sat at John’s left, hair damp from the bath and wrapped in his dressing gown. He was largely silent, although his narrowed eyes followed Lestrade suspiciously as he bustled around the kitchen, following Violet’s instructions and fetching silverware.
“Hector Antonelli has always done his best with those girls. It’s appalling, how he’s been treated. Who did they say had been arrested?”
“You do have me, you know.” he murmured, leaning his chin on his hand. “She’s right about that.”
He carelessly slapped the bags of peas to Georges face and head, and turned to look at Violet and Sherlock.
It had been the look in her tired, damp eyes that persuaded Sherlock to investigate the other, newer cargo before he left Montpellier. Her son had been sitting at a corner table with a couple of older men, playing cards and trying to look like he was enjoying the cheap cognac his friends were tossing back. Sherlock had been planning on anonymously tipping off the local police about the shipments before catching a night train to Paris. He had been looking forward to finding a slightly more comfortable place to stay, to shaking off his current disguise as a fisheries sales rep. It was with a poor grace he had hidden in the cab of one of the harbour cranes, waiting to see what unfolded below.
“I know. People used to call me that too. The nuns told me I was unnatural, that there was something wrong with me. They put it down to an excess of original sin.”
John reached up and ran his hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck, inside the collar of his coat. His skin was cool under John’s fingers, and he pulled him down until their foreheads were pressed together. Sherlock didn’t resist, but his expression didn’t lighten.
Mycroft was behind the wheel of Patrick’s considerably newer, plush model, with Murdy at his side. It occurred to John that he had never seen Mycroft driving any vehicle, let alone a large jeep; but the assured way he swept out of the drive made it clear that he was more than up to the task. Before Violet had climbed up into the back seat she had gripped the lapel of John’s jacket and kissed him hard, leaving a smear of blood red lipstick on his pale cheek. Briefly, she rested her forehead against his. Her mismatched eyes flickered shut, and she inhaled deeply.
Sherlock knew he’d had a reason for being there, and he recalled it after an embarrassingly sluggish 0.4 seconds mental struggle. “Mycroft. Take Mummy and Father to
He glanced up from the surface of the water and into Sherlock’s face. The detective seemed to have frozen, and he was blinking rapidly. John didn’t have a clue what was going through his mind and he decided just to plunge onwards. “And I didn’t because I didn’t know how you’d feel about that. I’ve gathered that you’ve had some experience in that area in the past that was… not good. I wanted to, but I was worried that you’d start remembering some of the bad stuff.”
(Just… I mean how? Why? What the hell is she doing here? It’s fucking New Years morning in the middle of fucking Scotland and my fucking assassin ex-wife just decides to knock on the kitchen door? Oh Christ, what’s
“But I think you’d look quite fetching-“
John sagged in his own chair, letting out a gust of breath. “Oh, god. Thank god.”
Murdy’s eyes had followed the movement of his hand; the handle of the knife sliding upwards from the folds of woollen fabric. Without conscious thought John launched himself forward, but Sherlock beat him to it – quick as an adder he darted into the room and seized the man’s wrist. Reverend Duncan let out a hoarse shout, pitching forward onto the rug as he struggled with Sherlock who did not let go of his wrist. He thrashed desperately, his other hand coming to rest on Sherlock’s throat as Sherlock hammered the hand holding the knife repeatedly against the floor. John caught sight of Sherlock’s reddened face and bulging eyes as he silently gasped for air, the way he refused to let go of Duncan’s arm. He stamped heavily on the ministers arm, smoothly sliding the gun from underneath his jacket.
“So… you came all the way from God knows where to rural Aberdeenshire to say sorry to me?” John queried, not even bothering to hide the scepticism in his expression.
John leaned over and kissed Sherlock briefly, feeling his mouth beginning to curve into a faint smile after a moment or two. He pressed his lips once more to Sherlock’s cool cheek and moved back behind the wheel, deeply relieved at the small but genuine smile that met his own hesitant one.
The man with the case nodded briskly, dropping his coat on the floor and bending over Mrs. Duncan. He was a slight man, with a kind and rather prematurely lined face. “Indeed. How long was she in the water?”
“Do not speak to me of such things, please.” Sherlock muttered, looking more than slightly appalled. “Where’s the tonic water?”
Marmaduke didn’t seem to have an answer to this, although he continued to regard Violet with some great private amusement. Violet, for her part, seemed reluctant to look at him any longer and she signalled to Margaret to continue serving.
“Well, no; of course not.” Murdy said, with a hint of impatience. “That’s only the time frame between delivery and when people were actually poisoned. It’ll be a much shorter window than that.”
“Not as such.” Sherlock said. He was
“Archivist.” Violet said quietly. John had had his back to her and Sherlock where they sat on the tiles, and he had been trying to block the line of sight between them. He hadn’t heard her getting to her feet or approaching the twitching Marmaduke.

Hilary gave Basil a thunderous look. “Don’t be…
Phyllis blew her nose and sniffed loudly.
She had been in the conservatory for several hours, and nobody seemed all that keen on disturbing her. It was now well after dark, and the only noise coming from behind the glass panelled doors was of very loud orchestral music.
“You’re right. It really shouldn’t matter. And I know how easy it is to despise them, Sherlock. It sometimes seems like their brains move at the speed of chilled fucking molasses, and all you want to do is shout  at them, to tell them to
The words that Sherlock threw at him, viciously, like a fist.
John bent down to peer more closely at the photograph. Sandra was lying on the bench, loosely framed by folds of vivid blue cloth. Her skin was pale, and stood out starkly against the drape. The blood from the wound in her back had smeared somehow up under her left arm, and there were more traces around her small mouth. Her hair was long, dark blonde and wavy, but her eyebrows were dark and dramatically arched. It splayed around her head and slightly across her pretty oval face. It was an unusually disturbing picture, for some reason. Her body was twisted at the waist, with her long slim legs angled to one side and the expression on her face was troubled. John tried to determine what it was about the photographs that made him so uneasy; he had, after all, seen far worse violent scenes. This was positively tame in comparison to some of the deaths he had seen in Afghanistan or on cases in London.
“It’s you. You’re here.” Sherlock’s hands were clumsy, but tightened on John; drinking in every aspect of his face. He seemed almost scared to look away. John nodded again, suddenly unable to speak. The relief was almost crushing him now, breath escaping him with a sound that was close to a ragged sob.
“Well, Garcia wasn’t from around here, was he? It was the people who knew him who were most likely to have reason to kill him. He knew the people in this house best. QED: One of the students or staff here killed him.”
Sherlock glanced down at him, taking in John’s calm upturned face. His eyes were closed, face and hair dappled with raindrops. He hadn’t bothered shaving that morning and the stubble made him look slightly rumpled and rough. Sherlock had a strange, momentary desire to press the ball of his thumb against the corner of his jaw, just to feel the rasp of it.
“Ah. I see. Come along; I’ll help you.” He said unexpectedly, taking hold of George’s scrawny arm. “George, please come along with us. You’ll feel much better after a rest, I’m quite sure.”
He took a deep breath, and exhaled shakily, focussing on slipping the first button through the tight slit in the fabric and feeling Sherlock’s hands smoothing down his sides, coming to rest on his hips. Desire was flooding though him already, blossoming through his nervous system like ink through water.
Nobody answered him, although John noticed how Basil and Hilary both avoided his gaze.
“Productive morning, vile worms?” Violet queried, brushing a loose curl from her face with a slightly floury forearm.
“He won’t return here tonight.” Anthea said, somehow managing to swallow a very large mouthful of risotto with utmost finesse and delicacy. She shot Sherlock a sidelong look.
Sitting across from him, Violet was clutching the strap above the door next to her and chatting animatedly to Sherlock. Sherlock was paying no attention to his surroundings, focussing only on Violet; or perhaps more specifically on her face. John was positive that Sherlock had not known of her scarring, although it was quite obvious that the injury to her face must have occurred several years previously. He was also surprised that Sherlock had made no comment so far about them, and was entirely prepared to kick him vigorously if he was tactless.
He flushed hotly when he noticed the way Violet was grinning at him from across the table. He lamely attempted to cover his embarrassment by pouring cups of dark richly scented coffee for them all.
“Yes.” She said levelly. “Twice.”
John felt something akin to ice trickling down his back. He suddenly remembered Mycroft’s snide words:
He texted Sherlock quickly:
“The trip took hours and hours. It was late October, and I didn’t have a coat. I was so cold and I felt sick from the way the ship lurched through the waves. Philip didn’t seem to feel the cold; but then he was used to it. He took out a book after a while, and read. When we reached Bergen we got back in the car and he drove north for another two or three hours.
“So the poisoner must have contaminated the bottles at some point between opening time on the day before, and mid-morning on the twenty third.” Violet mused, turning back a page. “Right, well this should narrow things down considerably. Let’s make a list.”
In short, it was life just as they liked it. There were chases through dark streets, and tedious stake outs followed by midnight take outs, and squabbling over who used the last of the tea bags.
Back at Hilderbogie House, Violet was busily sawing at a loaf of tomato and olive-studded focaccia. She looked up and grinned as Sherlock and John entered through the kitchen door, then glared at Sherlock until he scraped the snow off his shoes. Patrick stood at the other end of the table, carefully mixing what looked like fruitcake batter. He nodded at them briefly, before returning his attention to the large bowl in front of him. Benjy, Violet’s Russian Blue cat glared at them from beside the stove.
Sherlock turned in his seat at this, seeming a little surprised to see Murdy in the chair next to him. He frowned slightly at her, before twisting to face John. “There you are!”
John managed a weak smile at this. “Pillock. I suppose you do, don’t you.”
Murdy said nothing, leading the way up the narrow staircase and into Reverend Duncan’s cluttered study which was at the front of the house. The landing was dark, lit only by a dim beam of light from a lamp left on in the bedroom near the top of the stairs. John caught sight of a silver framed photograph on a low table next to a jug of dead flowers; on closer inspection it was from Reverend and Mrs. Duncans’ wedding portrait. He paused, letting Sherlock and Murdy go on ahead into the study as he picked it up.
Sherlock shook his head gloomily. “No, it’s not just the smell of rot. I think I can smell something else, too. Something chemical.”
too much about me. And you know that I will always have your brother’s best interests at heart. You know that, yes?”
“And a belated happy Christmas to you, too.” John grinned.
Patrick’s jaw slowly unclenched after a minute or two, and he reached out to squeeze Violet’s small hand in its buttoned leather gauntlet. “-and that’s the reason I’m no longer welcome in Corfu. Well, not just Corfu actually; the entirety of Greece. Possibly parts of Albania and Macedonia too, following the unfortunate incident with the lobster-“
“I suppose you’ve come to tell me that you and Sherlock are leaving?” she asked quietly.
She glanced up at them as she rifled through the messy pile. “Look, he clearly won’t notice that things aren’t put back exactly as they were. He doesn’t let Mrs. Duncan clean in here, look at the state of the place. Who knows when he’ll be home? We might not have another chance to search in here.”
“He still isn’t willing to take the time to do it, though.” John pointed out.
“Of course not.” John murmured, intrigued.
Sherlock snorted. “Why the hell should I care about that?”
Sherlock made a sharp noise of frustration and held onto John as he made to move away. “
Why did he have to have his hands right there, just over John’s heart? John shut his eyes and swallowed hard. Sherlock was too heavy, and his hips and knees were bony as they pinned him down. His elbows were digging into John’s arms. What worried John most of all at this point however was the possibility that parts of his own anatomy might end up digging into Sherlock.
“Good morning, brother mine. John.”
John blinked a couple of times, willing his face to remain impassive. (Right. Ok. Bastard.)
Sherlock waved a weary arm at him and sighed in a manner that was sharply reminiscent of Murdy a few minutes previously. “I’m
, with all the clothes pins. This thing with the peeled ginger root, though-“
(No coverage,
Sherlock did not respond to this, partially due to the fact that his mouth was now full of cake; but mainly because he didn’t seem to feel the need to dignify such toadying with an answer.
“Breathe, John. Take one good breath for me now please…” It was Mycroft’s voice that eventually broke through, to his distant surprise. John struggled, and took a shallow gasping breath. Tried to focus and failed dismally.
. Sherlock then began to take mis-matched plates off the wooden shelves and placed them on the table. He seemed to think for a second or two, and grabbed one of the smaller jugs of flowers from a nearby shelf and added it to the haphazard table arrangement.
“And an excellent customer here, I imagine.” Sherlock said, with a trace of acid in his voice.
He watched as Sherlock nodded, his face flushed and almost pained with desire. Taking a deep breath, John lowered his mouth to Sherlock’s twitching cock, gently circling the base with his fingers. He smoothed the long expanse of Sherlock’s pale thigh with his free hand, exploring the muscles, the fine hair and heated skin. He smelt warm and musky, of sandalwood and of fresh sweat; incredibly, unavoidably
He opened his mouth to speak, then unexpectedly, he felt Sherlock’s hand cover his. He looked up into the knowing green eyes, recognising the slight note of pleading in their depths. He felt the angry words die on his lips. Sherlock shook his head minutely, and after a moment John sighed and nodded. He squeezed Sherlock’s hand discreetly.
Reverend Duncan paused at the top of the staircase, slipping one hand into his pocket as he grasped the newel post. He seemed deep in thought; and for one wild hopeful moment John thought that he might be about to walk into the dark bathroom directly opposite. Almost immediately, though his hopes were dashed and Duncan turned towards the half-open door of his study.
They resumed their winding path towards the church, the spire rising above the steep slate and snow covered rooves. Murdy walked with her shoulders pulled up towards her ears, kicking drifts of snow with her big black boots. She looked awkward and gawky when she stood still, John noticed; but when she moved it was careful and tense. She ducked her head and peered out from under her heavy mane of shaggy black hair, seeming unwilling to make eye contact with either of them for longer than a second or two.
“I want to look at your scar again. I am also planning on touching you quite a lot while I kiss you in a minute.” Sherlock said calmly, sitting up and shrugging off his own shirt. “Acceptable?”
you!” Hilary hissed.
“John, it’s your mouth. You don’t know how many times I’ve fantasized about having your mouth on me.” Sherlock whispered softly, watching with wide eyes as John awkwardly slipped between his thighs.
“Of course he’s damn well downstairs.” Sherlock muttered, slouching further down on his side of the chaise and sulkily resting his chin on his chest. “The overbearing arse just can’t help poking his nose in. I can always tell when you’ve been talking to my brother, John. You develop this interesting little twitch in your right temple, and you look like you’ve been grinding your teeth. A
Sherlock laughed harshly. “Oh yes. Certainly! It was all Violet’s fault that I eventually became a cocaine addict. Absolutely. And as for her supervision, you utter imbecile, may I remind you that she is all of TWO years older than I am? Shouldn’t you be blaming Sherry or Grandmother?”
Violet glared over at George, her anger seeming to seethe anew. She seemed to be thinking hard, and as she did so she slowly removed one of her shoes. She threw it at him, hard. It bounced off his chest and skittered across the floor.
Violet drawled, in a not quite steady voice. John thought he saw her stealthily pass the tips of her left fingers under her eye before she reached out casually for her silver cigarette case from the arm of the sofa.
Not wanting to step back, John slipped his hands between their torsos, unhooking and unbuttoning the top of Sherlock’s black wool trousers. He swallowed hard, and let his fingers slip inside after he slid the zip down. Sherlock’s cock was hot and hard under a layer of grey cotton, and as John cautiously trailed the tips of his fingers from base to tip he heard the detective give an almost inaudible moan. Sherlock’s hand slipped down onto John’s arse and squeezed hard.
“Um. Well, a bit. Maybe.” he said, feeling greatly relieved at her reaction. “I am so terribly sorry, though.”
Patrick’s smile widened a little. “Cricket?”
Discovering the squashed, battered packet which contained a few bent cigarettes almost made him gasp with gratitude; especially when he found the book of matches tucked in next to it. The small book was more than half-empty, with only four flimsy matches left inside. The urge to light a cigarette first was nearly overwhelming, but he forced himself to carefully begin stacking logs in the grate; tucking scraps of paper for kindling amidst the dusty wood. The motions were automatic; this was one of the few household chores he actually enjoyed doing at home.
Hilary gave her a thoroughly unimpressed look. “I should... save your imagination. For your work, Phyllis. It is certainly… required there.”
“Did we really just follow a bloke halfway across town to see him have a spot of fisticuffs and a grope down an alley? Because we could be sitting in front of a fire drinking brandy right now, not freezing our arses off in a godforsaken corner like this.” He whispered.
Sherlock had listened to John’s stumbling, hesitant words with a strange dull ache. John didn’t know what he was suggesting or promising, he didn’t know what he was getting himself into with each sentence. He didn’t
“Who cares?” John murmured. “Oh god, that was brilliant. You’re brilliant.”
He slowly opened the door, lifting it slightly by the handle as he swung it open to minimise creaking. Heartened by the sound of George’s heavy breathing, he crept inside. John watched him silently approach the bed where Marmaduke lay face down in the messy bedclothes, snoring loudly. Sherlock dropped to all fours with a catlike movement, and slid under the ruffled valance noiselessly. He moved with a weirdly fluid grace, and in the doorway John found himself gaping slightly at the view. He swallowed hard, and forced himself to look away.
Sherlock looked up sharply at that, regarding John hawkishly over his glass. “John, please. It’s perfectly obvious why you’re here. You couldn’t remain there any longer, not after finding out about the child.”
“Amazing. Mind-blowing. Fantastic. I’ll write you a list of adjectives later on, when the rest of my brain cells have reassembled themselves.” John laughed, turning and pressing his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Aye!” roared the crowd, some of them waving what looked like long knives and bats in the air. They seemed intoxicated by the woman’s stirring words and she looked around at them approvingly, her hands on her hips.
Standing in front of the fireplace in the drawing room he swayed slightly in the flickering light. John slouched back in his armchair and half closed his eyes, dreamily letting the notes roll over him. Sherlock was obviously showing off for Violet, and she plainly knew it. She sat and listened, rapt, curled up next to Patrick on the blue silk sofa. Her eyes were narrowed, gleaming as she leant forward towards Sherlock; a sly little grin on her small full lips.
John opened and closed his mouth a few times, not quite knowing what to say at this point. He turned to Sherlock and shrugged apologetically.  “Um. Well. So you see how it might have looked a bit. Um.”
“Everyone else seems very inclined to blame the errant Freddie Garcia, Patrick.” Sherlock pointed out.
Basil glared over John’s shoulder at Marmaduke, who was studying the huge stuffed bear with great interest. “The bloody swine. I came into the common room and he was attempting to grope her on the sofa. He had her backed right into the corner. It was damn lucky that I came in when I did. Poor Hilary, she was very upset and rushed out. She’s so beautiful and she’s had to put up with that sort of thing so often, you see.”
“John, please,” he tried another smile, but she remained straight faced and perhaps a little disapproving. At least she lowered the instrument in her hand and he realised that she must have been spraying some nearby plants in large terracotta pots.
“Right.” she interrupted briskly, once she had quickly grasped the situation. ”Where did they go in? Okay. Don’t panic, John. They’ll be moving into the grounds by now, and the easiest place for them to get out will be the old jetty next to the boathouse. Get there as soon as you can; there’s rope and an old lifebelt if you need them. Move!”
“It’s almost eight.”
Sherlock directed a baleful glance at them. “I can be helpful. See? I don’t know why you look so damned surprised about it. I help people all the time.”
“Oh, honestly John! Wasn’t it glaringly obvious, even to you?” Sherlock frowned curiously. Violet threw an oatcake at him before John could do more than bristle.
“And the Reverend doesn’t?” John asked curiously.
Murdy appeared reluctantly at the top of the stairs and made her way down them with a poor grace. At first, however, John wasn’t entirely sure that it
“Has he remembered the vinegar, ma’am?”
And with that, she shepherded the students away towards their common room, loudly talking over their objections. Patrick went last, and threw a questioning glance at John.
John’s rage surged suddenly, futile hatred and utter shame at the part he had played in the whole sorry mess. As much as he wanted to beg forgiveness, he knew Sherlock didn’t have the energy to deal with his guilt. “He’s dead. I saw him. They’re all dead.” he repeated firmly.
“-of telling you but I am inestimably glad that-“
Sherlock sat down at the table and was promptly ordered to start chopping some tomatoes and garlic, which he did with remarkable skill and only a minimum amount of complaint. John watched him curiously as the knife blurred on the chopping board, pulling up a chair and taking a sip of the heady wine. Sherlock’s face was furrowed in concentration; it seemed as if each piece was so meticulously sliced that one would need callipers to spot any variation in size. Similarly the garlic was finely and swiftly chopped that it soon resembled a paste on one corner of the scarred wooden board.
Sherlock found out unexpectedly that his feet were a hitherto unknown erogenous zone. John had curiously dragged his fingernails gently along the soles of Sherlock’s bare feet while sucking him off in his armchair, and the resultant buck of Sherlock’s hips had given him a sore throat for two days. He couldn’t help grinning though.
“Oh, believe me I am all too aware,” Sherlock glowered at him. “And if you are not back at work in London within three days I am going to be most displeased.”
Hilary opened and shut her mouth a few times, visibly making an effort to calm down. Externally she was as sweet looking as ever, in her pretty lavender dress. But the strain was evident in her face as she turned to Basil. “But… Basil. She- she hasn’t? Has she? I swear that the… the thing with Freddie. It was. It was over a long time ago. I forgive you for-”
“I’m fairly sure he’s started wars over less.” Sherlock said flatly. “Has Inspector Menzies appeared yet?”
“Um. I can see that you’re a little… overcome…” Sherlock murmured, breaking away after a minute or two. “It’s alright, you know, if you want to wait until-“
Unlike Marmaduke, Phyllis was only too eager to volunteer information. She sat on the edge of the chaise, with her dainty hands clasped on her knees.
Violet moved a little more slowly, but managed to keep up; occasionally grasping Anthea’s hand as she toiled over particularly rough spots. The snow was churned up in places; their torchlight caught streaks of mud and damaged trees on either side of the rough track. Scored and scratched boulders made John stop and stare. Clearly the vehicle ahead of them had not had an easy descent into the valley either.
Violet frowned, seeming slightly surprised at John not knowing this. “Well yes, certainly. Almost right after Sherry and I were married, when he was eighteen. He came up and stayed with us most of the holidays, and turned up the odd time when he was probably meant to be studying. I was always glad to have him, though – it’s a very quiet place up there. I was surprised at first that he was happy to be way out in the country with us, but he liked it. The library had really quite a good collection of metallurgical works, and we had a great time going through some sixteenth century alchemical treatises.”
“One of your mother’s dresses?” John asked carefully.
As she talked, the pad of her right thumb travelled the length of Mary’s neck in a precise, impersonal way. It was rather like the touch of a physician right up until the moment her hand travelled in a smooth curve around to the dip of her shoulder blade and suddenly pressed hard.  Mary drew breath loudly, her posture rigid. She bowed her head abruptly until her chin was pressed to her chest; her knees trembling convulsively. John shut his eyes and gripped the edge of the table, forcing himself to ignore the harsh rasp of Mary’s pained breaths.
[Why the hell can’t I just delete it? It never really goes away. Not ever. None of it. I’ve deleted so many things. Dull things. Irrelevant things. So many momentous, unpleasant things. I spent a mere three hours in that house in Yerevan. A single evening. And it never goes away. Stupid. Stupid.
“Shut it, you dreadful philistine. It’s my bloody boudoir and I like it.” Violet said blithely, opening a nearby drawer and scrabbling around for an eyebrow pencil in the messy contents.
” Mycroft’s voice was tense, and oddly breathless. John managed to open his eyes, blankly taking in his sharp profile in the torchlight. “These are the men who took my brother. They are dead. But Sherlock is not here, John. I swear to you that he isn’t here!”

A letter arrived by special delivery on Boxing day, which John took from the postman in a sleep-deprived haze.
There’s no sign of the Reverend, and there’s rumours flying around that PC Dalziell was spotted marching him into the police station earlier. That cannae be right, can it?”
