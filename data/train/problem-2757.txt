Dean didn’t see the looks his brother and husband were currently exchanging; Sam’s fueled with anger, Cas’s more sorrowful than anything.
“I suppose that Barry's a pretty cool guy. He does make some bad decisions sometimes though,” she said offhandedly as she took the empty carafe from him and filled it up.
Blissfully ignoring the mirror, he retrieved all his discarded clothes from the cool floor and made his way into the bedroom. He tossed them as well as the towel into the hamper and padded past the still made bed (that hadn’t been slept in in almost a week) over to their dresser. He pulled out a pair of boxers and slipped them on, brow lowering when they slipped right back down, gravity pulling them to the floor. He checked the tag and saw that they were an old pair, a pair from…
“What?” Dean found his voice going to octaves higher than it normally did. He closed his eyes and shook his head. “I do
“Different, huh? Different how?” Dean inquired curiously, eyes narrowing as he titled his head to the side.
Cas was sure that in the last five weeks, Dean had lost almost fifteen to twenty pounds. He couldn’t help but wonder what he’d look like if he’d lost fifteen to twenty more.
Dean nodded though there was still an air of curiousness about him. “Why didn’t you tell me before? I would’ve come out there, you know. If not to beat his ass, at least to be there.”
Dean swallowed thickly and nodded. “Just stood up a little too fast is all,” he stated with a forced, polite smile, and set the books down on the counter. He pointedly ignored the shared look between Claire and Jack behind Garth.
The door to Dr. Anderson’s office opened and Dean’s eyes widened at the realization that the near-skeletal person leaving was none other than Anna, Gadreel’s wife. She was dressed in a form-fitting charcoal grey skirt and a long-sleeved black sweater, even though the temperature outside was in the nineties. Her legs and arms looked like toothpicks, and her face was pale and gaunt. Her hair was thin and dull, and Dean had just managed to force the look of surprise off his face when their eyes met.
“Have you, uh, have you spoken with Castiel recently?” he tried again, attempting to covertly search Dean’s face for any sort of unspoken emotion but his brother’s mask was almost as solid as steel and he found nothing but a small, almost unnoticeable smile at the mention of the man’s name.
Cas bit his bottom lip as Dean came up for air and finally shed the boxer briefs that had been containing the hard on that was now finally free.
Why did everyone keep saying that to him? Just because he wanted to be healthy and lost a little weight? He was fine
Those had been the only words Sam had left on his voice mail not less than two days before, and they’d haunted his thoughts all the way up until he’d actually laid eyes upon the reason for the six-word message in the first place.
“I guess I never thought of it that way,” Hannah stated pensively, taking a sip from her glass of water. “You do make a good point though. Now I think I’ll have to go back and reread it, see it from a different perspective, I suppose. Your husband’s quite the scholar,” she said, turning towards Cas and winking.
It was a barely noticeable grunt, but the pain that managed to escape Dean’s lips was clear and present in Castiel’s ears.
Cas let a small smile tug up the corners of his lips as he thoroughly coated his dick with the silky substance, then squeezed more out and ducked down, crashing his lips against Dean’s. Dean moaned into the kiss, and grabbed Cas’s shoulders as Cas ran his fingers down Dean’s own throbbing cock, over his balls, and then finally circling the tight ring of muscle to his entrance. He painstakingly teased him with one finger, pushing it in and out, in and out before adding a second, then a third. When he felt as though he’d efficiently tormented Dean long enough, he removed his fingers and grabbed an unused pillow; raising Dean’s hips up and sliding it underneath of him. Without a word, he settled on his knees and pulled Dean forward. He didn’t think it was possible to get any more turned on than he already was, but the delicious moan Dean let out as he pushed inside him sent him into a tailspin. He roughly gripped Dean by his hips, blood rushing to both his ears and dick as he slammed into him over and over, tilting Dean’s hips up just enough so that he was continuously hitting his prostate. It didn’t take long for either man to go over the edge, Cas trailing just a few seconds behind Dean.
It felt like the more weight he lost, the better things were between Cas and him. Cas couldn’t keep his hands off of him, and Dean couldn’t help but wonder why.
He suddenly felt uncomfortable standing there naked and hurriedly rushed out, dressing as quietly as he could in their bedroom. He kissed Cas on the forehead before he exited the room and went downstairs.
A resounding and frustrated, “Yes, fuck!” came pouring from his brother’s lips, and Sam stood there, momentarily dumbfounded by the sudden admission.
“Are you fucking kidding me? I’m just fucking fine!” he all but screamed right in Castiel’s face, showering him with bits of spittle that had managed to escape past his lips.
“You’ll be the best prosecuting attorney the state of California’s ever seen,” Dean said, a large grin lighting up his face. After a few moments of silence, he added, “I’m proud of you, Sammy.”
Eventually, he’d managed to calm down enough to make them both something to eat, though he barely touched his food. His mind was too consumed with exactly how many calories was in the sauce of the fettuccine alfredo, and how he really didn’t need that much of it, even if it would be the only thing he’d eat that day.
“Dean,” and this time it was Castiel’s voice, low and sure. It silenced both brothers, Dean’s chest heaving a bit more than Sam’s.
One minute, his shaking hand was holding the fork just above the pie, the next, he was shoving the ridiculously delicious substance down his throat faster than he could swallow. He almost moaned at the taste, but figured he’d already made enough of a spectacle of himself by stuffing his face.
“I don’t want to be the one to assume or jump to conclusions, but I don’t know what else could explain it. I’d say it could be depression, but I really don’t think that’s it,” she said as she led the way into the kitchen, inhaling the glorious smell of Donna’s lasagna that was wafting from the oven.
Dean sighed, hating the fact that he knew he was acting like a jerk but also pissed because no one was listening to him.
“Dean! Dammit, Dean, we have to talk!” Sam shouted, going up after him. He heard the bedroom door slam before he reached the top of the steps and rolled his eyes at the gesture. Hoping he had moved quickly enough, he hurriedly made his way down the hallway and turned the knob. Surprisingly, it wasn’t locked. Sam took a deep breath and let himself into the room.
“So how are you two doing? Is Donna’s mom doing any better?” he inquired, heading back towards the register and finishing getting it online.
Donna came to stand by her side, taking Jody’s hand in hers for a moment. “Ditto to what she just said,” flashing her toothy grin, though Dean could see that her brown eyes were glistening. “And I just want to thank you three again for letting me take the time to help my mom out. It really does mean the world to me — to us…” She paused for a moment in an attempt to compose herself as Jody wiped a stray tear from her cheek. “Oh, what I am doing? Thank you guys, now let’s eat!”
Now that his face was only inches from Dean’s, he finally took a minute to study his husband, really, truly look at him.
“Oh, right, sorry,” he immediately apologized with an embarrassed smile and hurriedly headed up towards the front of the store.
“Ok-ay,” Dean mumbled, and picked the sandwich back up. He glanced at Jack who once again had that expectant look on his face, and took another bite, hoping that eating at least half of it would appease the kid. “Maybe Jody should have left her in charge,” he joked, and Jack’s eyes grew big.
“Um, kind of,” Dean finally answered, sitting down across from him and taking a long drink from his mug.
He opened his mouth to speak, but his voice cracked immediately, forcing him to clear his throat. “I’m sorry?” he responded, brow lowered in confusion.
“Fairly well,” Cas replied. “I’m currently up for another promotion, and I’ll find out in a few weeks whether or not I get it.”
Their relationship had reached a turning point when Cas had been reassigned to Goose Creek, South Carolina two years later. They’d both known that leaving Kansas was inevitable, and though his relationship with his parents was sour, Dean had still done his best to see his little brother when he could. One fight after another had almost taken them to their breaking point until one night, hours after yet another shouting match, Cas had cornered Dean in the kitchen.
They’d only been separated for a few weeks at a time since then, mostly when he’d had training classes here and there, but for the most part, Dean had been with him every step of the way.
“We probably only have a year or two at the most left before I’m reassigned somewhere else, and I guess I just feel bad. With us having to move every couple of years or so, I just feel bad for Dean.” That was most definitely not why he was drunk, although, the thought had crossed his mind before.
Dean shook his head and started to chuckle at himself. “I’m fine, but that was definitely a close one. You’re my hero,” he mocked, his voice a few octaves higher than normal and the concerned expression eased off of Cas’s visage as he slid his arm around Dean’s waist and led them across the street and into the bar.
It was bitter, just as he expected it to be, but warm, nonetheless and a welcoming presence slowly occupying the small expanse of his stomach. He couldn’t chance drinking it the way he used to, not wanting old habits to form and come back and bite him in the ass.
Sam watched as she looked up from tying her apron and her eyes widened in recognition and a warm but concerned smile etched up the corners of her lips.
Dean shivered as he unlocked the Impala and climbed in, reaching behind him to set the beer in the backseat. Even through his jeans, he could feel the chill of the leather seats, and quickly started the gorgeous metallic beast up, turning on the heat and giving it a few minutes before he pulled out of the driveway and down the street.
“You’re halfway there, Chief, don’t stop now,” Dean murmured with a wink, and Cas couldn’t help but smile at the quip. He started undoing the belt, and once that task was completed, hooked his thumbs through the belt loops and slid the baggy denim down, revealing fitting boxer briefs that had to be new since they clung snugly to Dean’s small frame. “You’re taking too long,” Dean complained, and somehow managed to switch their positions. Cas chuckled at him as Dean forwent undoing the buttons on his uniform top and just slid it over Cas’s head, revealing a tight, white t-shirt in its wake. His green eyes widened at this, the tan that Cas somehow managed to hold during the winter showing clear and present along with his more muscular chest and arms.
Of course, that had set Sam off on another course of action – trying to get Dean to eat more than just the few hundred meager calories he’d been surviving off of – and that, in turn, had set Dean off, telling Sam to more or less fuck off, slamming the bedroom door in his face and locking it behind him.
“Like to keep it toasty in here, huh?” he joked, and he watched as a look of fear washed over Dean’s thin face before dissolving quickly into a more guilty one.
“I thought you weren’t due back for another two weeks,” he said as he pulled away, not missing the concerned expression on her face, but doing his best to ignore it.
The words hung in the air for a moment, and Gad’s expression turned from one of concern to understanding.
Dean glanced over his shoulder at him, and upon seeing that his uniform was still on, lowered his brow. Cas usually changed before he came home, so the fact that he hadn’t was a red flag. “You okay?” Dean inquired, pulling the towel that he had draped across his shoulder off and hanging it on the oven handle.
“Chief Novak, please, have a seat,” Shurley offered, gesturing towards one of the chairs that was in front of his desk.
Cas coated his fingers in the slick substance and didn’t even bother teasing this time around. He was too far gone already for that. He slid one finger in with ease, working and loosening it up so he could add a second. Dean whined low in his throat in response, and Cas made quick work of adding a third. When Dean’s knees began to buckle below him, he set the jar down on the table and snaked an arm around Dean’s waist to hold him in place. He removed his fingers when he was satisfied of the moaning mess he’d turned Dean into and hurriedly coated his dick in the white substance.
Dean knocked on the door, and they were both greeted by a grinning Donna who was clad in a gray sweater with a turkey on it that had an air bubble above it with the words
He still caught worried looks from Jody and Donna every now then, hell, even Jack and Claire, but for the most part, things had gotten so busy at the shop with the upcoming holidays, that they didn’t really have time to pay attention.
Cas rolled his eyes and shook his head, but wrapped an arm around Dean’s chest anyway, hand coming to rest once again on his ribs. He settled back into the couch, content to be Dean’s body pillow for the time being.
I am so sorry for taking so long to get this out, but at least this version of the chapter feels right to me. Without further delay...
Gadreel was the first to spot them, and waved them over to the table that he was currently sharing with Gabriel and Michael. Dean hadn’t seen them since Gad’s wedding, and he watched as the expression on their faces changed when he took off his coat and hung it on the back of his chair. He immediately pulled his flannel tighter around his thin frame, desperately hoping to hide as much of himself as he could.
“Things have been good,” he shrugged, continuously keeping himself busy and avoiding her questioning gaze.
“I…I never meant…” There were words circulating around his brain, but his throat wasn’t allowing them to make it out. Instead, he just knelt there, watching as the man he loved fell apart before his eyes and he did nothing to stop it.
“Maybe,” Cas laughed lowly. The lack of light and the shadows from the television screen highlighted Dean’s cheekbones, and Cas could feel himself beginning to get hard. “And hot too,” he added as an afterthought, removing the black t-shirt he had on and tossed it to the hardwood floor.
Flurries were scattering around them, the wind catching them and twirling them about. The sky was a lighter shade of gray, appearing as though the sun wanted to shine through before it was due to set, but couldn’t quite break through.
Dean took in a breath and closed his eyes, inwardly contemplating whether or not Cas could tell that all three pounds had more than likely went straight to his gut. He glanced down at the tan hands that were resting on his stomach and tried to suck it in as much as possible.
Once they’d both discarded their coats and shoes, Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist, drawing him close. “Are you tired?” he asked, raising one hand up to gently cup Dean’s cheek.
“Fuck you, Cas!” Dean shouted, the cords in his neck more pronounced than ever. His glare was almost as sharp as his cheekbones.
“Almost a hundred percent, thank God. The doctors are amazed at how fast and far she’s come. She’s back living on her own, which Donna hates, but if she gets the go ahead tomorrow, she’ll be able to drive again. Anyhow, if you need anything, don’t hesitate to call, okay?” she asked, wrapping her scarf around her neck.
Sam felt more words bubbling to the surface, desperately wanting to escape his lips, but in that moment, all the anger that was flooding through him fizzled and he suddenly felt like that tiny, two-year-old again and tears sprang to his eyes. His breath hitched as he took a step back and met Dean’s furious stare.
Dean led the way away from the counter and over to a table in the corner. Sam followed and sat down, unable to stop fidgeting with a loose thread on his t-shirt.
Castiel ran a hand through his dark hair, a sigh escaping his lips as the hand came to rest back under his chin as he leaned forward in the hard, plastic hospital chair.
He forced open the car door, it groaning as he did so. He made a mental note to pick up some WD-40 the next time he went to the store, whenever that would be. He grabbed the two bags out of the passenger seat and stood up, a bout of dizziness assaulting him as soon as he was on his feet. He made quick work of using the car to lean on, closing his eyes for a moment until it went away.
The three words hit him like a brick, and he found himself wondering if he’d just been imagining them when Dean pulled himself away from Castiel and leaned his back against the bed. He pulled his knees up to his chest and bowed his head between them.
“You – you look different,” Cas stated flatly, brow lowered in what Dean could only presume to be disgust.
“Hell, you can turn it up a little more if you want. The hot flashes haven’t quite kicked in just yet,” and those words earned her a groan and retreating footsteps. She couldn’t help but laugh at that and turned on the pot. She checked her watch and seeing that they still had a good forty-five minutes before the store opened, sat down and dug into the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich.
“Yeah, I know,” Cas said with a nod, “But it hurts like hell though. I’m never going to smell whatever it is you cooked tonight on a ship. I don’t even want to think about what I’ll be forced to eat,” and those words got a laugh out of Dean, even if the sound was closer to a sob than a chuckle. “What am I going to do without you?” Cas asked, staring into Dean’s eyes.
It was probably better that Sam waited outside for the time being. He didn’t want them to get thrown completely out of the hospital.
“Answer me, dammit!” Sam shouted and that time Dean jumped at the command, eyes owlish and wide behind his glasses. “Was this Castiel’s idea? Was it?”
He cast a slight nod towards her, anger welling up inside of him at the thought of a perfect stranger seeing him so weak and being so willing to help and forced his tingling legs and feet to move forward and cross the threshold of Dr. Anderson’s office, barely able to close the door behind him.
She’d never had any children of her own, but her motherly instincts never failed when it came to Dean, or Claire and Jack, for that matter. And her radar was endlessly going off when it came to Dean nowadays.
and time to get up. When he opened his eyes, he realized that his glasses had somehow managed to ease themselves away from his face while he was sleeping, leaving nothing but fuzziness to surround him while he blindly searched for not only them, but his phone as well.
His reflection in the dream nagged at him as he continued his trek along quiet and empty streets. There was no way in hell he could allow himself to get like that, let alone look how he used to. If he hadn’t started losing weight, he was sure that he would’ve ended up like that.
“It won’t be okay until your back,” Dean returned, taking in a breath as Cas pulled off his t-shirt, the cool air more than evident as it hit his skin, forcing goosebumps to arise on his pale flesh.
Dean sighed and took off his glasses, setting them on the nightstand in their usual spot. He removed the rag from Cas’s hand and tossed it on top of the pile of clothes that was lying on the floor, then got under the blanket and covers. He rolled onto his side, facing away from Cas. The action made Cas feel dejected until Dean reached up and gently grabbed his wrist, pulling Cas’s arm down until it was around his waist. Cas happily complied and slid under the covers behind him, thankful that Dean didn’t outwardly hate him at the moment.
He was growing more and more uncomfortable as the seconds ticked by. This had definitely been a huge mistake.
“I’m not killing myself, Sam! There’s nothing wrong me!” Dean reiterated, cords pulling noticeably in his throat as he matched his brother’s volume.
His eyes widened at the sight, and he reset the device twice more before accepting the fact that the numbers were real.
Donna giggled afterward; slight blush still evident on her cheeks. After a moment, her expression transformed into a more serious one. “Let’s just do our best to be there for him, yeah?”
“Hey! I watch Game of Thrones and plenty of other shows that aren’t comic book themed,” Dean defended himself, tossing a throw pillow at Cas in the process.
The only problem was that while he had enjoyed the time off, he also hadn’t been walking nearly as much and hated the fact that he’d been eating a little more than he knew he should have. He’d wanted to be as small as possible for Cas, but that definitely wasn’t going to happen now.
“Fuck,” Dean muttered and made sure the call had ended before he set the phone down on the counter. He raised his glasses up and rested them on his top of his head, then dug the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Fucking Claire and that goddamned Facebook bullshit,” he grumbled, letting his glasses fall back into place as he repocketed his phone.
Dean turned off the water and carefully stood up, his head still reeling in the dizzy sensation that was now casting bright spots all over his vision.
Ellen chuckled lightly at that as she scribbled something down on his chart and nodded. “I’ll give it another ten minutes or so. In the meantime, Dr. B will be in shortly. Not gonna lie, Dean, she’s not gonna take it easy on you.”
Cas could hear the other voice on the digital line saying, “Dean, I know it’s your day off, but Claire and Jack both called off and I could really, really use your help…” He knew there was no way Dean could say no to the woman, so he eased off of his husband, giving him his best “it’s alright” face as Dean looked apologetically back at him.
Cas scrubbed at his eyes as he pulled into the driveway, though it didn’t help the weariness disappear from them. He’d been through drill after drill after drill in the last three days, and finally got the okay to go home. Twice a year, he was forced to go through them to keep all the men stationed there on their toes, in case of a real emergency. He’d managed to get roughly eight hours of sleep in the time he’d been gone, and he was looking forward to passing out as soon as he made it through the door.
“I’m good,” he lied, forcing himself to look at her and the worry that was present in her eyes. “Really, Jody, I’m okay,” he tried to reassure her, but judging from the look on her face, he was failing miserably.
“Cas? That you?” Dean called out. “Because if it’s not, there’s gonna be a problem,” Dean warned and Cas felt the tiniest of smiles creep upon his face.
“You know I didn’t mean that last one, right?” Cas inquired, eyebrow quirked again as Dean placed the dishes into the sink, then wiped down the table.
“Is he now? Well, I do enjoy little Joan Didion every now and then,” Mrs. Baker said, smile growing just a touch wider.
Gad’s expression eased in understanding. “That’s a part of the job, and I think with you two having made it this long, he understands.”
It felt like once the snow had started, it had never ended, the ground endlessly covered in never ending white.
Music began to play, and two by two, the bridesmaids and groomsman made their way down the isle. Cas reached out as he and one of Anna’s sisters passed Dean, gently touching his arm and sending a wink his way. The reaction from Dean was almost instantaneous — a barely noticeable smile crept across his face as his shoulders relaxed ever so slightly and he rested his hands on his knees, the nervousness slowly seeping away. They soon reached the end of the isle, Anna’s sister, Hael and he breaking apart and going to their respective sides of the isle. He stood next to Gabriel, Michael, and Gadreel’s brother, Ezekiel.
“So, uh, you look different,” Gabriel blurted out, his comment followed by an immediate yelp of pain as he was so obviously and politely
After what felt like and eternity, Dean finally removed his fingers and opened his eyes, the green almost completely overtaken by his pupils. He pushed Cas’s hand off of his dick, slicking it up with a generous amount of lube and positioned himself over the leaking head, then sat down slowly, taking it in inch by glorious inch until he could no more. Cas moaned at the tightness, at the feeling of having his cock completely and utterly enveloped by Dean’s heat. His hands found their way to Dean’s hips where bruises were already starting to form and bucked up as Dean came down.
“Now, young man,” she ordered, and he finally relented and went back into the living room. Instead of crowding onto the couch, he sat down in the over-sized and comfortable recliner chair that he’d heard Donna complain about Jody falling asleep in more than once. He could definitely understand why as he settled into it, wondering if he and Cas should get one.
“Oh, thank God,” Dean mumbled as two other customers came through the door. If they stayed busy enough, he wouldn’t have to hear their teenage mouths ask too many questions or make oblivious comments about things they knew nothing about. Although, he honestly couldn’t remember when the last time he ate was…
Dean rolled his eyes and sat up, immediately regretting the decision as dizziness yet again overwhelmed him. “Where am I?” he groaned, voice coming out hoarse.
“I’ll be there in twenty, Ms. Mills,” he replied, and Cas laughed lowly when he heard the woman remind him that her name was “Jody,
A weak breeze blew past him as he trudged across the front lawn and he shivered in response, the cool, spring night air still holding a slight chill to it. That’s what he told himself anyway, completely ignoring the fact that the last time he’d glanced at his phone less than an hour before, it had said that it was still seventy-five degrees outside.
He stared at himself in the mirror, biting his bottom lip. Even though the scale had told him that he’d lost weight, he couldn’t see it. He lifted up his t-shirt and stared at his stomach, his lip curling in disgust. He hadn’t had any pie in almost five months (or hardly anything with sugar in it for that matter), but he could still see fat hanging over the waistband of his jeans that appeared at least two sizes too big now. They were baggy on him just like every other piece of clothing that he owned.
“Alright, I know just the place then,” Dean stated and led the way back out the front door, making sure to lock it behind them.
“I wouldn’t have made it this far without him,” Cas stated truthfully, flashing Dean a sincere smile and Dean couldn’t help but blush.
“Dammit, Dean, does everything always have to be a joke with you? Is it really that hard to just tell me the truth once in awhile?” Cas gripped the steering wheel tight, sucking in a breath as he could feel the tension electrifying the air between them.
t-shirt, along with a black and white flannel. Cas claimed it was one of his favorites, so he’d stuck with it, even though it was one of the smaller ones he’d had.
Cas made him happier than he’d ever been, and Dean wanted to make sure that Cas was just as happy as he was, if not more.
“Okay,” he replied, glancing at her with a neutral expression before placing a forced smile on his lips.
Sam sat his bag down on the bed, figuring he could finish his inspection of the place later. Dean promised food, and he’d skipped breakfast that morning, in too much of a rush so he could make it to the airport on time. His stomach grumbled loudly enough at that moment for Dean to hear, leading to another series of chuckles from the smaller man.
And that wasn’t even counting what her customers were going to drink. Or Dean, for that matter. The kid seemed to live off the stuff as well, only he took it black, which she thought was a travesty.
He was the only one currently in the small waiting room that consisted of four gray colored chairs, with two lined up directly facing the redhead’s desk, while the other two chairs faced Dr. Anderson’s office door. The cream-colored walls were decorated with mostly informational signs except for two black and white photographs; one of a waterfall, and the other of a forest.
, but now that it had, some tiny, intricate piece of his soul actually enjoyed it; and he hated himself all the more for it. Dean was literally killing himself for him now.
Dean hated lying to him, hated it so much that it physically hurt sometimes, but he didn’t have the heart to tell him that his mind was mostly focused on what he could or couldn’t eat, or drink for that matter.
Curiosity got the better of him and he removed it from its hiding spot, absentmindedly placing the cushion back into its place.
“We’re still in the honeymoon phase and not the old and gray like you,” she replied, smiling sweetly and sarcastically.
“It’s going to be alright, Cas,” he stated and offered up a smile, the sight only torturing Cas’s heart even more. With the weight loss accompanied with the glasses, Dean somehow managed to look younger than his twenty-six years.
“Are you hungry?” Cas asked, gaze drifting to the buffet style tables that were set up, filled with chicken, salads, and various sides.
He quietly rummaged through the dresser, and pulled out a pair of boxers, slipping them on before he went downstairs and into the kitchen to salvage whatever Dean had been cooking. He couldn’t help but take a few bites of the spaghetti Bolognese that had cooled considerably but still tasted amazing, and before he knew it, there was hardly any left in the Tupperware container he’d placed it in. He couldn’t help but feel guilty as he stared down at the meager contents that were left, but he figured maybe he could make it up to Dean by cooking breakfast in the morning.
“As much as I’d love to believe that bullshit, we both know it’s not true,” Dean stated, shoving his glasses back up to where they’d slid down to. Sam peered over at him in that instance, and his eyes widened when he noticed Dean’s wedding ring was missing.
Of course, Sam would follow their stupid Facebook page. Everyone at the bookstore enjoyed it but him. He understood that it helped with the business side of things, but still…
“I’m not going anywhere, Sammy,” Dean murmured, and Sam wanted it to be true, he really did, but the state of Dean’s body told another story. All he felt were bones when he hugged his brother back, and it only made him sob even harder. Dean was never going to listen to him, he just knew it.
“Talk about what?” Dean murmured, voice now small. His head was leaned against the window, arms hanging loosely at his sides.
Dean offered a small smile at that and nodded. “I’m fine. Just thinking about tomorrow,” he lied, and pulled on his own coat. Though the bookstore was a smaller one, they still held their own black Friday sale, but it was more a customer appreciation day than anything. Dean actually enjoyed the busyness and hectic day, and knew that it would serve as a decent distraction more than anything this year.
“That’s…that’s great. Good for you,” he responded, heart starting to pound once more in his chest as he felt her scrutinizing him. “So…what’s the damage?” he asked, nodding towards the cash register.
Moving more smoothly but with hesitance, he pulled it away from the corner and towards the center of the room, biting his bottom lip as he carefully stepped onto it.
He pulled back, teasing the tip of Dean’s dick with his tongue before hallowing his cheeks out and taking him all in again. He pulled Dean forward each time he swallowed him whole, Dean’s balls now smacking into his chin with each forced thrust.
The rational part of his mind told him that he should eat, that it was okay to have some carrots or even some of the salad mix; but the darker part of his mind – the part that seemed to be winning far more than it was losing nowadays – told him not to have anything at all, that he didn’t need it and would be better off without it.
Dean shrugged, a drunken grin that didn’t quite meet his eyes pulling up the corners of his lips. “I’m right as rain, sweetheart,” he said, and took a rather large drink from his glass.
Dean appeared uncomfortable for just a moment before Sam watched the mask slide right back into place, and he shrugged nonchalantly in response. “Been putting in a lot of hours at the store,” he stated.
“No, or the time you woke up naked on base and thought the lieutenant’s office was the head,” Gad said, barely able to contain his laughter.
The other part was there was some quiet but logical voice in the back of his head telling him that if he continued down this path, he really was going to die. He’d managed to push it back for so long that it had taken him a full week of seeing spots in his eyes every time he’d attempted to stand up to know that it was right.
Dean took in a sharp breath, looking like a snake prepared to strike when Castiel leaned forward and kissed him, soft lips pressing against Dean’s chapped ones. He felt hesitation on Dean’s part at first, even going so far as to press a thin hand against his chest as if to push him away, but his resolve quickly fell through, and he melted into Castiel, skin cool to the touch as his fingers grazed the stubble on his cheek.
“You just made me see stars, Cas. Actual fucking stars,” Dean murmured, eyes still closed in wonderment. “They were blurry, but they were definitely there.” And Cas laughed at that as he came to stand, gently switching their positions so that he could finally wash himself off.
He sighed and stepped out from behind the counter, placing his hands on both of her shoulders. “I promise, everything is fine. Take all the time you’ve need, okay? We’ve got this. Right, Jack?” he called out, and Jack gave them a thumbs up, the sign falling out of his other hand and to the floor. Jody’s eyebrow arched again, forcing Dean to repeat himself. “We’ve got this. Mostly,” he added, quirking his lips up into a half smile.
today, buddy,” Dean stated, slapping Cas’s arm playfully with a clean dishtowel.  “What precisely is it that you want from me?” he asked, and folded his arms across his chest.
“More than you,” Dean lied as he attempted to stand, his legs feeling more like jelly than flesh and bone. He sat back down, jaw clenched at his weakness.
He was pretty sure that somehow that the tags had gotten mixed up or something, because there was no way in hell size thirty-two’s were too large for him now. Even if he had dropped down to 154.
After a few moments of comfortable silence, Dean finally murmured, “I don’t want you to go.” The statement was followed by sniffle, and Cas held him all the more tightly.
Cas sighed as he entered their home, thankful that after his three week training course in San Diego, he was finally back. He was ten years into his naval career, and had just made chief. The promotion gave him a decent pay raise, but he hated being away from Dean for so long. They’d managed to call and text each other when they could, but his training took up most of his time and it didn’t help that Dean was working overtime at the bookstore either.
He blinked dumbly for a moment, then looked between them. “What’s this?” he asked, brow lowered in confusion.
Something deep, down inside of him screamed at him that it was wrong to feel such pleasure at Dean’s thinness, but Cas being Cas ignored the voice and kept going, raking his nails against clothed ribs and bare hipbones and before long, the feeling was too much and he was coming harder than he ever had before, Dean following not to far behind.
Once, Cas had drunkenly told him that Gabriel had had a crush on him, but he’d found that hard to believe and had just laughed it off. Gabriel was just a flirt, plain and simple.
“Yes,” his husband agreed. “Like now. I just — I noticed that you had, you know, and you just look so good, and I really am sorry, Dean. I just got caught up…”
“I can’t wait to find out what happens to Fitz and Hannah! I bet it’s gonna be a treat!” Garth continued on cheerfully, and Dean just nodded distractedly, not having heard a word the other man had said. “Well, thank you again, I’ve got to get off to work, but I’ll dig into these as soon as I get home. Thanks again, Dean, and please tell Jody I said to feel better soon!”
“Dean, you and I both know that you’ve never cared what you put in your body up until May of last year, according to your notebook. Don’t lie to me. What happened?”
“Dean, I know this is a lot to take in, but you have to understand, you need help.” Her voice broke him from his train of thoughts, and the hand she laid gently on his shoulder pulled him back to reality. He blanched at her touch, and instantly felt embarrassed afterwards, heat flooding his cheeks.
“What did you just say?” he countered, eyes darkening like the sky that was streaked with lightning just outside the window.
Sammy sniffled again but his breathing had started to even out. He peered up at Dean with wide, watery eyes, listening as Dean continued.
“I don’t know. If I hear her complain one more time about the dress needed to be taken in again, or the flowers are the wrong color, I’m going to request to go to sea,” he joked, and finished off the beer. “How are things on your end?” he asked, glancing at Cas who was busy peeling the label off his bottle.
“So how serious is it?” Dean continued, trying his hardest not to smile at the irritation that forced a scowl onto Claire’s youthful visage. “Gonna take her home to meet your mom? Or just keeping it casual?”
That’s when Dean realized that his husband wasn’t hugging him back. Dean blinked in surprise and lifted his head from Cas’s shoulder, fear wrapping itself around his insides and twisting it into knots.
The question caught Cas off guard, and he shrugged. “Um, not really, sir. Just going to spend it with my husband and a few friends, I suppose,” Cas answered carefully.
He plugged the headphones into his phone, then set off towards the bookstore. It usually took him about half an hour to get there on foot, so he made sure to leave with plenty of spare time, just in case.
“You’re gonna be my age one day, you know!” he shouted back as he turned the closed sign over to open on the front door.
Castiel felt the immediate urge to reach out and put a stop to Dean’s hair pulling, but guilt made his body feel like lead, leaving his hands to hang limply at his sides.
“We’re gonna head out,” Cas whispered to Michael and Hannah. “It was nice to see you again,” he said to Hannah who smiled in response.
was situated near a busy shopping plaza, which helped bring in business, but it being 7:30 on a Saturday morning, everything was quiet, only a few cars in the nearby parking lot.
“I’d like to start off with three appointments a week. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Will that work for you?”
“Maybe I should start stopping in more. Bring some treats or something,” Mrs. Baker offered as she took a sip of the tea Jody had handed her.
Dean’s stomach growled at the smell of the food that was wafting in from the kitchen, and he clenched his jaw, hating the weak feeling that was consuming him. He tried to force it away, and instead plastered a smile on his face when he saw Jack and his mother sitting on the couch, the sound of an old
Dean found himself biting his thumb nail, though there wasn’t much left to bite since he’d managed to tear most if it off already.
He couldn’t halt the sob this time, and he knew that Dean would take it as an admission of just how bad he truly felt, but God, if he only knew that it was for the wrong reasons.
He felt an odd sense of giddiness as he sat back down and began the task of finishing his plate. He’d actually be able to eat pie again, at least for the night. It would suck coming back up, just as everything else would, but at least he’d be able to relish the
Sure, he wore Dean’s glasses. And had even mastered the relaxed yet impatient lean against the car, as Dean alone could somehow pull off.
“Once the IV is empty, yes,” she replied, voice tinted with resignation. After a few moments of silence, she added, “I’ll be expecting your call.” Her words were followed by her footfalls as she quietly exited the room.
“Yeah, the paperwork took less time than I thought it would,” Cas stated, letting his hand finally slide off of Dean’s cheek, coming to rest on his side.
“Oh, like none of you have ever wanted to piss all over his desk,” Gabriel griped, and took a swig of his beer.
“For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the Captain turns off the Fasten Seat Belt sign…”
She was jarred from her thoughts when Dean came back into the small room to fetch the carafe and cups for their customers. He pulled the same forced smile when they made eye contact but remained silent as he went back into the main room.
The ride home was a mostly silent one. Dean sat in the passenger seat, tired green eyes taking in everything they passed and ignoring everything inside of the vehicle. His body was lax in the seat, the exhaustion of the morning’s events showcasing itself in the way his head was positioned against the edge of the car seat and the window. Sam sat in the backseat, arms folded across his chest, and expression just as angry as the dark clouds that were forming in the sky, signaling the threat of an impending storm.
“What was I supposed to do, Dean? After what you told me? Of course, I called him! This is his fault, after all!” Sam sounded indignant and all Dean wanted to do was punch him square in the face. He could feel a fist forming at his side, but the weariness that was taking its toll on his body prevented him from such an action. “Besides, he needed to see exactly what he’s done,” Sam added, folding his arms across his chest.
“I wonder if I’ve got a chance with one of her sisters,” the shorter man whispered, and Cas rolled his eyes in return. “That cute brunette you walked with might do the trick.”
He swallowed thickly, mouth starting to water as he thought about how easy it would be to demolish the thing and then just stick his fingers down his throat before he could digest any of it. The thought of being free and clear and fucking empty afterwards won out, and he grabbed the carton and fished a spoon out of the cutlery drawer.
you. Not all of us can look like you without even trying,” he muttered, and it was Sam’s turn to roll his eyes. He knew what Dean was doing, and he wasn’t falling for it.
“No, I’m not going to shut up, Dean! This needs to be dealt with. Now!” Sam shouted, standing tall with his hands placed on his hips.
The bells above the door chimed, Dean ever thankful that Claire had finally decided to show up and used her tartiness to ignore Jack and scold her instead.
Cas sighed and walked over to him, turning Dean towards him by his shoulders. “You’re coming with me, and we’ll make this work,” Cas stated, reaching down to button Dean’s open trousers. “Deep breath in,” he ordered, but Dean wasn’t having it.
The text was from Claire, one of his fellow employees at the bookstore. He’d stepped in and had been managing the place while his actual bosses were away. Jody had been on medical leave for the past two months due to a broken leg suffered at the hands of her and Donna’s very own basement steps. Donna, on the other hand, had taken on the task of caring for her mother after she’d suffered a stroke two weeks after Jody’s accident.
“Dean, we both know that you didn’t forget anything, so let’s just cut the BS now, shall we?” Her words caused the heart monitor that was still conveniently attached to his fingertip to speed up once again. Dean scowled and quickly pulled it off, tossing it down onto the bed below. “That took a little longer than I thought it would,” she added, an eyebrow raised at his most recent action. “But I don’t need a piece of equipment to warn me when you’re lying.”
Dean chuckled and sat down his sandwich. “Are you really going to psychoanalyze me like that?” he asked incredulously.
He was two pounds from his goal weight, but a nagging voice in the back of his head told him that he could do better than that.
Dean couldn’t help but chuckle at that. “I love it when you get all protective on me, but seriously, you have nothing to be concerned about when it comes to Gabe.”
“Monday at eleven hundred hours it is then. See you guys,” Cas said with a wave and grabbed their coats.
“Hope you’re ready for round two,” Dean murmured huskily into his ear as he leaned over him and removed the lube from the drawer of the nightstand. The action made his thinness stand out even more and Cas couldn’t stop his hands from skating over the smooth skin of his ribs and all the way down to the bare hipbones that were just begging to be touched. Dean popped the cap on the bottle and positioned himself on his knees, one on each side of Cas. Cas watched with lust-filled eyes as Dean started to open himself for Cas, starting with one finger, then two. He started to moan as two turned into three, and Cas could feel his dick growing rock hard once more. He couldn’t help but stroke himself as he watched Dean fuck himself on his fingers, Dean’s eyes scrunched shut in pleasure as he added a fourth.
For that, Cas was actually kind of thankful. He could see just how flat Dean’s stomach was with the way he was laying now, and he couldn’t help but run a hand down his side, fingertips sliding down clothed ribs that were much easier to feel than before.
into a mirror lately? I thought you were dying when I first saw you, Dean! I hardly even recognized you at first!”
“Hello, Dean,” the older woman greeted as they approached. Dean looked up from the books he was placing in alphabetical order and smiled that small, tight smile in return.
“Does he work tomorrow? If so, I’ll make sure to stop by with my double fudge brownies,” she said with a grin.
“Yes, you two make yourselves comfortable while I go put this up for safe keeping until everything’s ready,” Donna stated, and disappeared into the kitchen.
“Well, they shouldn’t be,” he replied, anger present in his voice as he bit off part of the bar. It was chocolate chip, something he had enjoyed at one point in his life.
“Yeah, the new place finally had their grand opening, but he’s sticking around for a while to make sure everything continues to go smoothly,” she explained. “So, how’ve you been? Haven’t seen you around here in a while.”
Both Jody and Dean chuckled at his innocence, leading him to look between them and ask, “Have you two ever played them before?” eyes large and questioning.
“You’re definitely sick,” Cas stated, now seeing the dark circles and chapped skin underneath Dean’s nose indicating he’d been blowing it a lot lately.
“For one year. Afterwards, depending upon the situation, you may be called to remain there for the following year, or you’ll be reassigned to another location,” Shurley answered.
Dean nodded, and Cas squeezed him just a bit tighter. “So what would you like to do?” Cas asked after a moment, and Dean shrugged in response, though his arms were still wrapped around him. Cas laughed lightly and gently pulled away from him, one hand sliding up from his waist to cup his cheek. He stared at Dean for a moment, at the cheekbones that were most definitely sharper; at the eyes so green that nothing could compare to how beautiful they truly were — not even the ocean at sunset or the view from the peak of the tallest mountain; at the lips that could make him go weak at a second’s notice, and he could only think of how fortunate he really was.
His attempt at speaking was curtailed by what felt like a piece of the granola bar stuck in the back of his throat, so he took another sip of water and tried again. “No, I’m not,” he admitted with a shake of his head.
The sounds of the flight attendant’s announcement roused Sam from his dozing state. He sat up straighter in his seat, his knees still digging into the seat in front of him. The cheap seats were definitely not made for people over six feet tall, that was for sure.
Letting the music consume him, he did lap after lap, blissfully ignoring the rumblings of his distraught and empty stomach. He was almost finished when one of his shoelaces came untied, not realizing it until he’d managed to step on it with his other shoe. He momentarily lost his balance but righted himself before he completely toppled over. Embarrassment reddened his cheeks as a few joggers passed him, though they didn’t appear to pay him any attention. Feeling like a clumsy idiot, he bent down and retied the lace.
“It was just a dream,” he murmured to himself. “Just a stupid, fucking dream,” he reiterated, though his voice was still a bit shaky.
He’d been off for the last two days, but didn’t look any better than he did beforehand, she noticed. There were still dark circles under his eyes, shadowed beneath his glasses. And somehow, and she wasn’t exactly sure how, but he looked even thinner, if that were at all possible. The hollows of his cheeks were deeper, and she couldn’t help but feel worry at the young man that sat beside her.
“You’ve been watching too much TV, kid,” he commented, trying not to sound as nervous and afraid as he truly felt.
“What the hell?” he murmured as he slid the cushion back. The end of a spiral notebook was wedged in between the inner wall of the couch and the cushion.
Dean’s stomach chose that moment to growl, and Cas fully encased him in the towel that smelled of the little bear Dean claimed he wanted to murder in a feverish ramble once upon a time. “You sure you don’t want to eat something first before you go to sleep?” Cas inquired, gently pushing Dean’s hair out of his still closed eyes.
“Hello, Dean!” The tall, rail thin man greeted him with a toothy grin and a wave. “And I most certainly am. You guys are the only bookstore in town that actually does special orders. Did you know that?”
Deciding it was now or never, he let out a breath and exited the room. He headed downstairs, and the scent of the peach cobbler Cas had been so kind to make immediately assaulted his senses. He bit the inside of his cheek as his mouth began to water, steeling himself as he walked into the kitchen.
“Dean, I don’t think I’m prepared for this,” Jack stated, and appeared suddenly stricken. “What if my mouth freezes or my jaw gets locked up? Or —“
Cas cupped the back of his head and gently rocked him back and forth. “You have nothing to be sorry for, Dean. You haven’t done anything wrong.”
“I’ll show you adorable alright,” Dean threatened and smacked Cas’s ass again as he leaned over and turned on the hot water.
“Stop looking at me like that and let’s go,” Dean chided, shoving his glasses up the bridge of his nose and successfully breaking Cas from his thoughts.
He could feel Dean take in a deep breath, then slowly lift his head up, placing his forehead against Cas’s. “We’d better make it count then,” he murmured against Cas’s lips, then kissed him. Cas returned the gentle gesture, one hand coming up to rest on Dean’s cheek. After a few moments, Dean pulled away, but not by far, the tips of their noses still touching. “Let’s start with a shower then because you’re kind of gross,” he stated and scrunched his nose.
“Did you eat breakfast this morning? If not, I think I may have a granola bar on me,” Garth murmured, checking the pockets of his jacket.
“We just want to thank everyone for coming out,” Gadreel said, raising a glass towards the crowd. “Please stick around, eat, drink, and be prepared to watch me make a fool out of myself on the dance floor.”
He stood quickly, choosing to remain silent as he followed her back down the hallway that led to Dean’s room.
He sighed and stared blankly at the computer screen. There was no way in hell he was going to be able to finish the rest of his reviews. They’d have to wait. He scrubbed a hand across his face and shut the machine down. He checked the time and saw that it was already half past six anyway.
“Don’t I know it,” she said under her breath, and turned back to Dean who was just standing there staring expectantly at her. “What? Go, make yourself comfortable.”
“Let me finish,” she cut him off, a slight edge to her tone. God, the man could be so stubborn sometimes. Even more so than herself. “I can’t even begin to imagine what you’re going through, and I know it has to be hard, but give yourself a break sometime, kiddo. Castiel isn’t the only one who cares about you. Everyone here,” she said, gesturing towards the bookstore, “cares too. And if you need to talk, you can come to me any time. I’m just as good at listening as I am running my mouth.” She paused, sending a concerned look his way.
“I didn’t –” Dean cut himself short, not wanting to admit to the truth. He bit down on his bottom lip, feeling another sob wanting to escape. He wasn’t supposed to be doing this in front of Cas, but his body was betraying him and he hated it.
Dean was acting normal, of course, and that alone made Sam fear the worst. Was it cancer or some other terminal illness? What could have made Dean lose so much weight?
“Young man, what do you think you’re doing?” she called out the window, brow lowering as Dean stopped and stared at her blankly for a moment before reluctantly removing the headphones from his ears, green eyes coming to life as he finally realized he was being spoken to.
Cas had always been an affectionate person, but he was even more so nowadays, and though Dean would never admit to being needy or clingy, he enjoyed it more than he let on. He still didn’t care much for the way Cas loved to touch his stomach, but the man seemed to be damn near obsessed with it, and Dean couldn’t help but try to keep it as empty as possible.
Winter was in full force, the sky already dark at five o’clock in the evening. It had snowed a couple of inches a few days previous, and the remnants of that storm still littered the ground.
Dean paced the expanse of the bedroom, back and forth, back and forth. He felt stupid really. Stupid because he was nervous.
“Alrighty, Kaia, it’s nice to meet you and welcome! I guess we’re gonna get this party started, huh?” she announced, and led her mother towards the dining room. “If you’re hungry, follow us!”
“Now let’s talk about the reality of the situation. Your reality, as a matter of fact. What do you think about it?” She paused her writing and gazed up at him.
Cas quirked an eyebrow at that, the action forcing Dean to roll his eyes. “Okay, I’m almost fine. The worst of it has already passed.”
Dean’s brow lowered for a moment as if in thought, then shook his head. “I’m still full from breakfast earlier,” he replied, taking another sip of whiskey from the second glass.
“Do you have a reason why we shouldn’t be?” Jack asked innocently, and Dean scoffed in response, though his heart was still beating a mile a minute to the darkness that was still covering his vision.
“You got this when you fell earlier, didn’t you?” Castiel’s voice was low, and really, he was angrier at himself than anything for not noticing sooner, but he just didn’t understand why Dean had to lie when he was anything but alright. Why couldn’t he just tell him the truth for once? Was it really that hard?
“And I can say the same,” Dean said, forced smiled held firmly in place as he slowly backed away from her as her hand slid all the way down to the small of his back.
“I’ll never understand how that man hasn’t been dishonorably discharged yet,” Cas stated and emptied the contents of his bottle in one swift gulp.
With reluctance, they soon found themselves loading up the Impala with Cas’s luggage, barely managing to fit everything in.
Dean smiled tiredly at him with half-lidded eyes as they continued down the highway, eyes slowly sliding shut the further they drove. “Gonna get smaller for you, Cas,” the drunken thoughts tumbled from his lips. “Gonna make you even happier…”
She couldn’t help how she rolled her eyes at that, hating the fact that she couldn’t bring herself to believe him.
He laughed, a bit uncomfortably, and took another small step back. “I’m sure it is,” he agreed, and Jody figured it would be a good time to guide Mrs. Baker away from him. He was starting to look like an animal backed into a corner, and that didn’t sit well with her.
“Hey!” Dean cried out in surprise, holding onto his glasses with one hand and slapping Cas’s perfect ass with the other.
“Understood,” he said with a nod, feeling even guiltier than he had before. And with the way she looked at him, it felt like somehow, she knew it was his fault too.
He closed the refrigerator door and removed the non-perishable items from the second bag – a small bag of white rice, a small canister of plain oatmeal and a bottle of multi-vitamins.
“No, a hundred and fifty-five,” Jack replied, and Dean almost spit the water back out, wiping away a few droplets that had escaped his lips with his sleeve.
“True,” Jody said with a nod, “But, he tries to do too much on his own and doesn’t realize that he has other people there for him that can help him out if he needs them. He's just too stubborn for his own good to ask. Kind of like someone I know…”
Dean was his everything, and to not be able to see him every day or touch him — that was going to hurt.
Once they were both clean and smelling of Dean’s body wash, Cas turned off the water and exited the tub, leaving Dean in there while he extracted an overly large bath towel from the nearby closet. He padded back over, wet feet sinking into the plush rug Dean had insisted they get so they wouldn’t fall when they got out of the shower. He took Dean’s hand in his and helped him out, then wrapped the towel around the both of them. He carefully dried Dean off and placed his glasses gently back on, though Dean looked dead on his feet. His eyes were still closed and he leaned into Cas, laying his head on his shoulder.
“I could never get sick of you,” he choked out, bottom lip quivering in earnest, eyes glimmering with truth.
Dean took them and opened the door for Cas, letting him go out first, then closing and locking it behind them.
“It was an accident, Dean! Okay? I wasn’t going through your things!” Sam defended himself, but Dean wasn’t having it.
“I don’t look that fucking different from the last time you saw me, and you know it!” Dean shot back, the veins in his forehead and neck more noticeable than ever through his pale skin.
She narrowed her eyes at him as she clipped the badge to her shirt, witty retort on the tip of her tongue.
Dean swallowed thickly and glanced around the room, double checking to see if she was telling the truth – she was.
Dean had always looked good, but now he looked even better and Cas couldn’t help but wonder what he’d look like if he lost a little more.
“No, not yet,” Dean replied as he slipped his boxers and pants back on and poured them both cups of coffee, adding sugar and cream to Cas’s but leaving his black.
“Dr. Anderson will be with you shortly,” she stated, and he felt his mouth open slightly in shock. How the hell had she known what he was going to do?
His gaze fell on Dean and seeing the man that he loved but had ruined made his heart shatter into teeny-tiny, miniscule pieces. Never had he ever saw Dean so vulnerable, so
He’d been trying to be strong and not let how badly Cas’s impending departure was wearing on him, but the more he thought about it, the more it hurt. Tears cascaded down his thin cheeks, dampening Cas’s t-shirt. Before long, a sob escaped his lips and he felt Cas hold him tighter.
“Just think it’s important to be healthy, you know? Better to get a little exercise than none at all,” he stated and folded his arms across his chest.
Dean was thin, almost to the point of being bony, his ribs peaking through his pale flesh and Cas couldn’t help but reach out and run his fingertips down the hollows in between the bones. His waist was thin, the size thirty-twos he’d bought him being held up with a belt that was clearly too big for him for now, several holes having been made since he’d reached the smallest one.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” he asked, finally meeting Ellen’s eyes. They were warm and chocolate colored but knowing as well.
He’d finally admitted to himself then that okay, maybe he had lost a little weight, but it wasn’t anything to freak out about.
“Well, that depends. What kind of pie do you recommend?” He tried to go for the most flirtatious tone he could, but his voice sounded small and anxious instead.
“French silk pie,” Dean said without even needing to be questioned from Cas. “They’d just gotten a fresh batch in when I was there so I thought I’d give it a shot.”
He swallowed thickly and placed them back in the drawer, taking another, smaller pair, out and slipped them on. They were size medium and just a little big, but they would do. He went over to the closet and took a pair of jeans off their hanger and put them on, the dark denim hanging low on his hips as he buttoned them. He decided on a Wolverine t-shirt, one that he’d bought long ago that had become too tight in recent years.
“Hey, hun,” Donna greeted her as she entered their home, flashing Jody a toothy grin until she saw the look on her face. She immediately went over to her, decked out in her Kiss the Cook apron, and placed a hand on her cheek. “What’s wrong?”
All too soon, the alarm was waking them up Monday morning, but neither Dean nor Cas had wanted to move from the cocoon they’d transformed their mess of blankets and comforters into.
“You have no idea,” Cas said, squeezing Dean the slightest bit tighter before releasing him and taking the cup of coffee from his hands. “But when you’re as stunningly handsome as you are, it’s kind of hard not to,” he said and leaned against the counter, smug look planted firmly on his face.
His stomach grumbled loudly, reminding him that he had yet to eat anything since the night before. He narrowed his eyes at the traitorous part of himself that told him he actually needed to eat – that logic was horse shit and he knew it.
Claire rolled her eyes at him in turn, and took off her coat. “Kaia, this is Dean, the senior citizen I work with,” she announced, smug grin lifting up the corners of her lips.
by Eric Clapton began to play on the speakers as Anna and Gadreel slow danced across the floor. The sight took Cas back to his and Dean’s wedding night. They didn’t have a large reception, just a small get together with a few close friends and siblings at their small apartment at the time. They’d danced to
“Ok-ay, well, I’m going to finish getting the coffee ready, and then I’ve got a few phone calls to make so I’ll probably be stuck in the office for a bit.”
Dean stared at him for a moment, a hint of something akin to anger edging his brow lower until his face softened and he nodded.
“Well…I have a week off between classes next month, and I was wondering if it would be okay to come out and see you…”
“I’m doing very well now that I get to see you,” she replied, reluctant to let go of him and winking at Jody who couldn’t help but grin wider in return.
Cas sighed, trying not to get frustrated. It was easy though sometimes, with how stubborn Dean could be. “I fully expect Gabriel to make a fool out of himself at events, but not you. What was that between you and Anna?”
His birthday had been a few weeks before, and from what she had gathered from their mostly one-sided conversations as of late, his husband had gifted him with an old-fashioned typewriter in hopes of giving him the inspiration to write again. He’d had tears in his eyes when he’d told her about it, so she’d tried not to bring it up too much, but still wanted to encourage him at the same time. He had let her read some of the short stories he’d written in the past, and she couldn’t understand why’d he stopped writing. He was quite talented, that was for sure.
“Yes, yes, thank you, Dean!” Jack said nodding, an excited grin spreading across his face. “And I’m sorry for not calling or texting. I forgot my phone here last night,” he said, retrieving it from the charger underneath the front register.
“I’m too fat for these pants!” Dean exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air. “I’ve lost five pounds and I still can’t fit into these things!”
Thank you guys for the reviews and kudos! I'm sorry for taking so long to update. Between work and going out of town, it didn't leave me much time to write.
“We invited you over, pal, although if you’d like to take over, by all means,” Jody said, gesturing to the stove. “The only condition is, you’ve gotta put this on,” she stated, gesturing to the apron.
“No, no, Dean, you don’t have anything on your face. I just…I’m just a lucky man,” Cas affirmed and planted a gentle kiss on his soft lips. “So,” he said as he pulled away, “What’s it gonna be? Dr. Sexy reruns? Batman marathon? Housecleaning?” And finally Dean’s serious face broke into a small smile at that.
“I’ll try to get out as early as I can,” Dean promised with a wink, and headed down the stairs. Cas followed, biting his bottom lip as his gaze landed on his husband’s ass. It took every ounce of self-control he had not to pick Dean back up and take him straight into their bedroom. He let out a breath as they reached the bottom of the stairs, trying to snap out of it as Dean removed his hoodie from the coat hanger by the front door and slipped it on. “See you later,” he said as he opened the door.
Jody shrugged. “I guess I hadn’t thought of that. I don’t want to scare him. But I don’t know how to help.”
Dean couldn’t help but snicker at Cas’s reaction. “Nice to see you too, Gabe,” Dean replied, then swallowed down one of the glasses he was holding.
“I have a belt that works just fine,” Dean replied offhandedly and pressed play, then leaned back into Cas’s solid chest as the show started.
Before Cas had a chance to respond, Gadreel and Anna appeared at their table. “Thank you guys again for coming,” Gadreel greeted, elated grin still plastered on his face.
Dean was seated on the bed with his head in his hands, the notebook perched precariously on his lap. Sam could see the small tremors that ran through his hands to his fingertips and could almost feel the anger that was seeping out and surrounding his brother like a shield.
“Not healthy? This is the healthiest I’ve ever been!” he returned, tapping himself on the chest. “I wasn’t healthy before!”
“Oh, well that’s good. You’re not going to get into any trouble though, are you?” she asked, arching an eyebrow.
Dean was sitting at the table, the small bowl he had put in the fridge earlier in front of him, still more than half full of…salad?
She studied him for a moment, seeing that he indeed had on at least three layers of clothing. Aside from the black hoodie he was sporting, she could also make out the collar of a flannel shirt peaking above the hoodie’s neckline and a t-shirt under that. His jeans were baggy as usual, and she knew that they had definitely fit him at some point in time.
The house itself had creme colored siding, and a decent sized porch, with steps leading up to it. At the top of the stairs, there were two small, inflated cartoon turkeys adorning each side. Dean smiled at what he presumed were Donna’s decorations. While Jody preferred the plainer side of things, Donna loved to decorate and therefore the bookstore was always plastered with turkeys or pumpkins or Christmas trees when the time came.
“How do you not see…that you’re killing yourself?” he finally managed to get out, voice wavering as the tears finally escaped the confines of his eyes and slid down his cheeks. “You’re going to die if you keep going down this road, and I’ll be all alone.”
Dean shrugged exaggeratedly and forced down the last bit of the granola bar. “What, like a buck thirty soaking wet?” He sipped more of the water, surprise and relief flooding through him when the edges of his vision started to return.
“Dean!” he called out, leaving the living room and walking into the kitchen. “I’m home!” He glanced around, but there was still no Dean in sight. He opened the fridge and his eyes narrowed slightly when he saw that it was almost empty. There were a few half full bottles of condiments and a couple of lonely beers. He snagged one and closed the door, twisting off the top as he checked outside, an empty deck looking back at him.
Cas nodded and finally opened his eyes, a stray tear escaping past his lashes and trickling down his cheek. Dean swiped it away with the pad of his thumb, and leaned in and kissed him again.
Hearing his name roused him back to the present, the nurse that had firmly stated he and Sam needed to “Be quiet or leave the premises,” appearing before him.
“You’re getting a reprieve solely for the fact that you brought that,” she stated flatly before she winked at him and gave him a half hug.
His phone vibrating in his pocket broke him from his thoughts, and he hurriedly pulled the maroon colored
The toddler sniffled and two more large tears rolled down his reddened cheeks. He was on the verge of another crying spell, and surely, that alone would set their parents off on another torrent of fighting.
Castiel sighed and ran a hand through his dark hair. He bit his bottom lip before he continued, gaze drifting back and forth between the two Winchesters.
“Always,” Cas nodded and felt more tears spring to his eyes. This time, he was the one to initiate the kiss, and he could feel Dean melt into it. He cupped one of his slender cheeks, gently rubbing his thumb across the sharp cheekbone. He deepened the kiss, hand now sliding to the back of Dean’s head, and Dean returned it eagerly, hands roaming over Cas’s chest and shoulders.
A knock at the door forced him to his feet in an attempt to distract himself from how hungry he truly was. He set the beer down on the large wooden coffee table and headed to the front door. “I got it!” he called out, not wanting Jody or Donna to have to rush to let Claire in. He opened the door, and just as predicted, Claire was standing there hand in hand with who he presumed was Kaia, the girl he’d overheard her telling Jack about.
Ellen chuckled again at that and shook her head. “That’s exactly what I’m talking about,” she stated, nodding towards the monitor. “I can see the gears are already turning in your head, so best stay on the right track and you won’t have any trouble. If you need anything, just push that button right there, but Dr. B should be in here soon.”
He’d agreed to meet Dean outside of the airport, as his brother wasn’t too fond of airports or flying for that matter. He’d always wondered how he’d managed to make it on the international flights whenever he’d traveled with Castiel, alcohol more than likely involved in the equation.
“Bet you’re not going to miss this weather,” Dean commented as his teeth chattered in his mouth. He clenched his jaw shut in an attempt to curtail the involuntary movement, though it did little to help.
“Please don’t remind me,” she muttered, turning around and heading for the exit. Dean followed her, almost bumping into her when she hesitated at the door. “If things do get too hectic —“
He’d escaped both days by using work as an excuse, but Sam was ready and willing to present his argument as soon as Dean was back inside the house.
“No, I don’t think that would’ve been a good decision,” Jack said, tone nothing but serious. “She’s—“
They wouldn’t worry about him anymore if he ate normally in front of them, or ate something in front of them at all. And all he had to do in turn was stick two fingers down his throat and force it all back up.
Dean couldn’t help but be slightly relieved, but at the same time, filled with dread. He didn’t want the night to end because that meant having only one more day with Cas, and driving the other man home would have extended it just a little longer.
“You guys are killing me,” Dean muttered with a playful roll of the eyes and took another bite of stuffing. “This is really good,” he said, pointing to the food. “You two really outdid yourselves.”
“And I'm the one that’s starting stuff,” Dean commented coyly, accepting Cas’s hand as he hopped out of the vehicle. He slipped a bit on some of the snow, almost falling face first to the ground, but Cas’s strong grasp caught him before the face plant could take place.
Cas parked across the street from the bar, all the spaces in front of it having already been taken. Being ever the gentlemen, Cas hurriedly exited the jeep first and opened the car door for him. Dean couldn’t help but smile at the gesture.
don’t look healthy! Don’t you get that?” Sam yelled back, hands gesturing toward Dean’s gaunt appearance.
Sam sniffled and shook his head, taking a step back out of his brother’s embrace. Fresh tears threatened to cascade down his already reddened cheeks. “Everything’s not going to be alright if you don’t get help. There’s nothing wrong with asking for it,” Sam stated, voice wavering in and out. “You’re not weak for getting help, you know that, right?”
“I turned it up to 75, is that okay?” he asked as he took of his jacket and hung it up next to hers.
He carefully pulled out and slid off the bed, disappearing out of the room and returning a few minutes later with a warm, wet rag. “So…” he began as he gingerly cleaned them both off, gaze traveling between Dean’s eyes and stomach, careful to get every last bit of the white substance as Dean was not a fan of finding remnants of it on himself come morning.
“We’ll get him home,” Gad stated, taking Cas’s place at Shurley’s side. “You two go home. Enjoy your time together.”
“Hey buddy, I heard you were due back today. A few of us were going to go out and grab a couple of beers down at Charlie’s. Care to come?,” the other man inquired.
“So it is an eating disorder then,” Jack clarified, as though there was absolutely no other alternative.
He yawned and forced himself to stand up, scrubbing his hands across his still hoodie-covered arms, chilly despite the thermostat being set at seventy-eight degrees. He made his way upstairs and into the bathroom, the shower knobs squeaking ever so slightly in protest as he turned them on, more hot than cold.
“You have lost weight. Are you sick again?” he inquired, tilting his head to the side and staring at Dean as the taller man grabbed a few boxes and set them on a portable cart.
The difference between the dream and reality was this time Cas was hugging him back. His touch seemed a bit reluctant at first, but Dean held onto him for dear life, burying his head into his shoulder as tears poured from tightly shut eyes.
“There’s no room to argue here,” Claire stated, and pulled him by the arm into the small kitchenette area, shoving him in the direction of the round, wooded table with three chairs placed around it. She retrieved three sodas from the mini fridge and set them down on said table, then sat down herself. Jack sat down as well, smiling up at Dean as he popped the tab on his soda and took a sip. They each had sandwiches of their own, and began to eat.
“Dammit, Sam, I’m fine, okay? Really, I am. I just decided to…get healthy, that’s all,” Dean rationalized with finality in his tone.
“Sure, why not,” he replied, but there wasn’t an ounce of happiness in his tone. He cleared his throat and went back to making sure the registers were starting up correctly.
“At this rate, you’re – ohhh – probably right,” Cas managed to get out as Dean nipped at a hip bone as he finally rid Cas of his last piece of clothing. He carelessly tossed the plain, white boxers to the floor, mouth heading straight for the large cock that was currently leaking pre-come. With one swift move, he engulfed Cas into his mouth and Cas couldn’t help but thrust up in response, the heat of Dean’s mouth sending sparks through his vision. He gently placed his right hand at the nape of Dean’s neck, running his fingers through the fine hair there as Dean brought him closer and closer to the edge. Dean hummed and hollowed his cheeks, taking Cas fully in and out, in and out over and over again until the edges of Cas’s vision darkened and he felt himself coming with a jolt, Dean swallowing down every bit of it and then some even after he had finished.
Dean sighed and ran a hand through his hair, Sam not missing the way he tugged at the ends of it tightly before releasing it. “It’s not…that easy.”
Dean’s voice traveled straight to Cas’s cock, and before he knew it, he was on his feet, pulling Dean up with him. With bruising strength, he placed his hands on Dean’s hips and lifted him up, the action easier than it had ever been. Dean wrapped his legs around his waist and his arms around Cas’s shoulders, mouth crashing into Cas’s once again.
There were tears there, threatening to spill onto the other man’s cheeks, but Dean could tell Castiel was doing his best to not let that happen. He also wore a frown on his handsome and tanned face, and Dean’s brow lifted in curiosity.
Dean was silent for a moment, gaze drifting somewhere behind Cas. He bit down on his bottom lip before finally asking, “Where to?”
He laid back onto the mattress, remnants of the nightmare flashing past closed eyelids. He bit his bottom lip and carefully laid his hand upon his chest. He could feel the bones there, just underneath his skin, their presence a minute comfort in the wake of his dream.
The thought of just outright resigning and quitting flitted at the back of his mind, but he shot the idea down just as fast as it had come. He’d put in over ten years into his career, and Dean would kill him if he gave up now.
“Will do,” Dean replied with a stiff wave, and quickly made his escape down an isle. He breathed out a sigh of relief as his feet carried him to the front of the store and towards a checkout line. His heart was still beating a little fast, but it began to calm as he stood in line, moving the basket from one hand to another until it had moved far enough that he could place his items on the conveyor belt.
Dean was silent and a bit unsteady as they left the hall, Cas immediately slipping his arm around his waist to keep him upright. No words were spoken between them until they were both settled back into the jeep and getting onto the highway.
“Don’t you know the way to a guy’s heart, chief,” Dean scoffed, backing away and beginning to clean up the remnants of breakfast.
“I’m – I’m…Thanks,” he finally muttered, defeat present in his tone. He set the granola bar on his lap, choosing to try to drink the water first. There were a rehearsed set of excuses on his tongue, but when he heard the sad sigh from beside him, he forewent telling them.
“I was overweight and got sick of looking the way that I did,” he finally admitted, though Sam could see that it was bullshit clear as day.
kept whispering in the back of her mind, and she couldn’t help but wonder just how true they might be.
“She does look beautiful,” Cas agreed, gaze straying to Dean. He couldn’t help but smile, admiration for the other man clearly present on his face, even if Dean was doing what he couldn’t —paying attention to the damned wedding.
“Since your girlfriend is too rude to care, Kaia, that is my husband, Cas; that’s Jack, which you may have already met, and his mom,” Dean introduced them all.
“It’s uh, it’s going,” Gabriel replied, and Dean didn’t miss the way the other man looked him and down, eyes widening before he schooled his expression back into one of only slightly shocked neutrality. “How-How’ve you been?” he asked, moving the cart he was pushing to the side and out of the way of passersby.
“Please listen to me. Please,” Sam begged, voice broken and worn. “Please stop, Dean. I don’t want you to die,” and a sob escaped his lips. It wasn’t long before he felt thin arms wrap around him, a cool hand cupping the back of his head gently as ever.
A round of agreement came from everyone at the table, and he was thankful that he’d managed to take the attention away from himself. He hadn’t even finished half of his plate yet and his stomach was beginning to cramp. He forced himself to take a drink of water, fighting back the bile that was beginning to rise in the back of his throat. It was starting to become too much, and he could feel how heavy his stomach was getting. He didn’t even want to look down because he knew with as much food as he’d just consumed, it was sure to be bulging out. He clenched his jaw and forced another bite of turkey into his mouth, instantly regretting the action as he felt his shirt grow tighter around his mid-section.
“But you have to.” Dean’s voice was barely above a whisper, but due to the quiet of the room, Cas had no trouble hearing it.
He began to dig in between the couch cushions, fingertips grasping smooth plastic when he finally found it. As he was pulling it out, something sharp scraped the side of his hand.
She stepped away from the bed, giving Castiel one last look before disappearing back out into the hallway.
“You’re a pretty popular guy here, Senior Chief Novak,” Gabriel commented, raising his beer at Cas though Dean didn’t miss the look the smaller man gave him. It was as though Dean were someone he’d seen before but couldn’t place where.
“So, as you can see,” Gad said, gesturing towards their surroundings, “Pretty much the entire base came tonight. Hell, even Master Chief Shurley showed up.”
Wordlessly, Castiel let his hand roam, from the small of Dean’s back where he’d caught him, up and along his ribcage to his chest and then finally coming to rest on his gaunt cheek.
Page after page, the spiral into anorexia was clear and present, and Sam wondered what the hell could’ve caused it. What could’ve made his macho, champion cheeseburger eating and ‘would die before he ever touched a salad’ brother descend into self-starvation?
He’d somehow managed to gain three pounds in the last few days, and he immediately berated himself for his lack of self-control.
Dean’s hands shook the entire drive to the airport. He’d done everything he could to steel himself for the goodbye, but nothing could compare to the emptiness that was consuming him as he found himself watching Cas board the plane. His chest ached as tears streamed down his cheeks, and he stayed until the plane departed, a piece of his soul flying away as well.
“Yes, sir, Master Chief, Shurley, sir,” Cas replied and hung up. His heart started to thump in his chest. He had been up for another promotion — Senior Chief Petty Officer. Aside from bumping him up another pay grade, it also gave him another week’s vacation. It did, however, come with more responsibilities and a larger work load, but he knew it would be worth it.
“Very,” Cas said, raising a hand up from his waist to cup his cheek and kiss him, Dean returning the gesture fervently. His other hand slid up Dean’s side, fingertips once again scraping against his ribs and he let his hand rest there for a moment, feeling the bones just underneath the skin once more before he moved his hand up further, this time grazing Dean’s more prominent collarbone. His dick was starting to get hard, and he could see himself bending Dean over the kitchen table and taking him right then and there.
“You do kind of look like a hobbit,” Michael observed, giving him a once over. “I bet your tiny little feet are probably hairy too, aren’t they?”
In the end, they both decided it would be best to proceed with caution and keep an extra close eye on him. It wasn’t the best solution, but it was the only route they felt they could take without overstepping.
Dean’s glasses had appeared too large on his thin face. That had been the first thing he’d noticed. Ever since they’d been together, they’d always framed his face perfectly, but now…
“Okay,” he replied and continued to straighten things up. She went back over to the comic section and grabbed a copy of
“I’ll be as frank as I can with you, Dean, you have a problem. We both know this, whether you want to admit it or not. You will have to eventually, because that’s the only way that you’re going to be able to overcome it. But you won’t be alone. I can promise you that much.” There was sincerity in her tone though her face remained stoic. “I have a private practice outside of here, and I’d like for you to schedule an appointment with me. There aren’t any treatment programs for males with eating disorders – ” His stomach dropped at those words and it felt like all of the air immediately proceeded to leave his lungs.
Castiel had a white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel, body tense and rigid. The amount of self-loathing that was running through his veins was enough for him to want to crawl into bed and never get out of it.
“Well, feel free to eat and drink,” she said, eyeing Dean quickly before continuing, “as much as you want.”
“Don’t even think about it,” he warned, pointing a finger at her as the bells chimed again. “Welcome to —,” he cut himself off when he saw that it was one of their regular customers. “Hey, Garth, here for your special order?”
“Could I interest you in some tea? I still have your favorite, the blackberry mint, right?” Jody inquired, heading back towards the front of the store.
Knowing he would still be chilly with just the tee (even though the high was supposed to get up to nearly ninety that day), he pulled on a blue and white plaid flannel, forgoing rolling up the sleeves like he used to.
The thought spiraled around his brain as he glanced at the receptionist who was busy typing away, a mile a minute on her keyboard, fiery red hair shifting every so often as she reached for another file whilst still typing with her other hand.
It was hard as hell for Cas to resist him because Dean looked ridiculously handsome in his outfit. It was a rarity for Cas to see him like that because the man usually dressed as casually as possible, always clad in a t-shirt and jeans with either a hoodie, henley or plaid shirt to boot.
Jody sighed exasperatedly at his response. “You know damn well who I'm talking about!” she called out but received no response. “Typical,” she muttered and added more sugar to her coffee. After drinking the majority of the cup, she went back out to the main room.
His question was met with Dean’s usual and quick response of, “Good. Everything’s good,” but Sam could tell he was anything but. Good was not a word Sam would use to describe the state Dean appeared to be in, and the more he thought about it, the more he needed to know what exactly was wrong with his brother.
“That may be the case, but he still knows how irritating he can be and does it anyway,” Cas responded, a scowl edging across his face.
His whole body was still thrumming with adrenaline as he began to walk again, his hands shaking as he forced them into fists at his sides.
“Yes, chief,” he responded in a flirty tone, and before he knew it, Cas was pulling him up and damn near yanking the soft, gray
“’Fraid I can’t let you do that, son,” the nurse, seeming to appear out of nowhere, stated firmly but with kindness in her tone. “That has to stay in, or you won’t be able to leave.”
“Jody!” Jack exclaimed as he came out of the backroom, a genuine grin lighting up his face. He set the large box that he was carrying down on the counter near Dean and gave her a hug.
