, Sherlock thought to himself. He hadn’t forgotten at ALL that it was Date Night – it was to be their first together as a couple – and Sherlock had been researching for three days in secret to make it the best and most romantic Date Night for John ever. This included calling up all his old, dusty files in his Mind Palace on John’s past dating endeavours, as well as obtaining a new identity as a teenage girl on a dating site's message board dedicated to dating tips and what they thought was romantic first date ideas.

But let’s ignore that for the moment, since the most popular of the theories subscribe to EMP occurring either immediately after the gunshot
In the
We all have different interpretations as to what is to be considered “canon johnlock confirmation”. For myself, it will be not necessarily the first kiss, but it will be some form of intimate interaction be it forehead touches or eskimo kisses, which, I’m going to be honest, I think will be more likely than an all-out passionate heat-of-the-moment kiss
See, one of the things that bothers me as a whole is that a lot of proponents for EMP are also the same people who accuse Mofftiss for being shitty writers, yet they believe that Mofftiss would be clever enough to come up with

The afternoon was one of the best of Sherlock’s life, though he would probably deny it to anyone who asked unless they were John. He was pleasantly surprised that his mind had calmed the entire time, though he knew deep down it was because of John's presence. They had rode several rides, the Ferris wheel being Sherlock’s favourite. The view was beautiful as it overlooked the sea, and he imagined he and John were
Now, proponents can argue we do the same with TJLC. But TJLC works with SURFACE READINGS FIRST, and THEN the subtext, whereas EMP tries to find the subtext without the surface reading because some little detail seemed off. There are very few believable TJLC meta that is solely based on subtext: We know John is in love with Sherlock and vice versa because of how he acts around him. That is surface. Granted we do have all our own silly little things, like the phone=heart metaphor, the drinks code, and food = sex, but it’s all STILL based on glaring details that were on the surface level first, and someone said,
“Yes, Doctor,” Sherlock muttered under his breath. He heaved himself up to a sitting position, and, to John’s surprise, scooted his bum into John’s hip and pressed his back against John’s shoulder. “Tea, John,” Sherlock demanded as he held his hands out to his side, awaiting John to pass his tea to him.
He smiles at his reflection giddily, noticing the flush high on his cheekbones; he pinches them a bit to keep the flush there long enough for John’s arrival home, and then rubs some vanilla-scented body lotion into his face and neck, rubbing the remainder into his hands. He decides against shaving, thinking the light dusting of stubble he managed to grow makes him look rather dashing; he has a hard enough time trying to grow it at all, so he thinks perhaps tonight John wouldn’t mind seeing a bit of it.
is important.
And if it is proven to be the “correct” theory, then I will honestly be surprised and happy for each and every one of you meta writers, because you have seen something that I still struggle to see no matter how I look at it.
Sherlock is just not THAT aloof, and I do not think for ONE SECOND that Sherlock would put
“The blog. Your romanticism. It’s how I know you loved me,” Sherlock whispers to the pillow. “In some capacity,” he adds after a second. Sherlock kisses John’s shoulder scar.
with telling John lies that end up hurting him in the end. Which is why he did not hesitate at all to reveal Mary at Leinster Gardens, but because Sherlock still feels he needs to protect John, he’s now trying the “half-truth” method and tells a blatant lie later at Baker Street to convince John of Mary’s "not-so-crazy” streak and to get Mary on his side to assuage her suspicions about Sherlock and so he can also see what she’s up to.
How long?
In John’s current mindset, he may have interpreted this as Sherlock saying
I don’t even think John himself realized how much he actually loved Sherlock until the Fall, until he was forced to face his feelings in his therapy session with Ella in
Sherlock knows it’s his fault for that. He leaned his head onto John’s shoulder, a silent apology, and John returned the gesture by pressing his face into Sherlock’s hair, whispering “it’s okay” and then turning his head to face forward but still against Sherlock’s skull.
Let me explain my points; this got WAY longer than intended.
and having John realize this in Sherlock’s mind palace makes it a completely useless plot arc, in the end.
Now, let me reiterate my stance on this: I don’t think Sherlock knew John was
. His head injury causes his

That said, Sherlock makes the decision to reveal Mary because I believe that by
the MP is in Victoriana. As I sat and replied to their post, I was struck with another idea, that perhaps the special is “drug induced”. I’ve excerpted my bit from their post to add it here, as a secondary theory, from
“Sherlock…” John says softly, putting down his own tea.
Only Sherlock came along, let John into his life and sneakily made John infatuated with him. By the end of
“And you were so looking forward to today, Luv! You wouldn’t stop talking about it! So, how about we get started?”
Guaranteed this has been talked about before, but I’ve never come across it: The scene after this is the one with the

, I hear you cry
“Shh,” John hushes. “I couldn’t breathe, you git.” John realigns his head so that their lips can capture each other more softly. John gently tastes Sherlock’s bottom lip – like peppermint and honey – suckling and tonguing at it, letting Sherlock know that this is what John wants. Sherlock’s breathing slows slightly as his mouth opens, welcoming John unto its depths.
. Mary
other than he’s sad and depressed and to reinforce to us that he can easily go back on them. TPTB reintroduced the idea that Sherlock is once again taking drugs. After the gunshot and him almost dying again after the confrontation at Baker Street, what’s to say that he wasn’t prescribed some pretty strong morphine to keep him from doing a runner again?
Now it’s John who turns his torso towards Sherlock which must have caught Sherlock off guard since he tumbles back into John’s chest and is now looking up at John’s face. “Why would you say that, Sherlock?” John is genuinely curious, but he thinks he knows the answer.
occurred in his mind palace? Sure, the parts we know are happening in there. The bolt holes convo doesn’t work for Sherlock’s eventual reveal to John if it’s in his head, and same with the meeting with C.A.M. being set up. It all links up, especially if you believe Mary is a villain.

And then goes to pat the gravestone fondly, barely containing his tears.
In fact, let me direct you to
John had suspected awhile ago that Sherlock had at least some affection for John, at least where touching was concerned. Sherlock seemed to, since John’s return to 221B, go out of his way to create situations wherein John either touched him or make John notice him. John thinks it’s an underlying fear that John isn’t actually living there, that Sherlock is dreaming it all, and needs to prove to himself that John does, in fact, reside with him once again, and the only way Sherlock can do that, in his mind, is to experiment.
, because it is my thoughts completely. Read those, and then come back here and read my thoughts on it after, because I will be writing on the assumption that you understand some of the core theories about EMP.
… Or something like that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The fidget cube sat forgotten in his pocket, only touched once when Sherlock pulled it out an hour later, plopping it back onto a table as he walked by it to go get his coat to head to the shops.
The thought breaks John’s heart, if he’s honest with himself. He’s loved Sherlock for so long in every imaginable definition of the word, and the thought that he himself had instilled that insecurity into Sherlock tears him up inside.
he’s probably feeling the weight of everything in his life, and the only thing keeping him going is Lestrade’s encouragement and “The Work”.
But you know what I found odd about
and clearly there is
But I digress.
“Sherlock, you do it everyday just by being here and by being yourself around me,” John assures softly, wrapping his other arm around Sherlock’s shoulder. “This… you doing this is incredibly romantic and thoughtful, Love. You know that, don’t you?”
Sherlock’s cock was so very happy, and spurted its joy again.
At least that’s how John interprets it, anyhow.
I think Sherlock’s time away made him realize the value and importance of friendship and love, which is why he lets John have his space upon returning.
As for the frozen trio within Baker St… Without seeing the scene before this happens, we can’t say if they were looking at a client or not. I checked the trailer and it cuts right to Sherlock saying “A moment”, and then it panning back across the frozen scene. You are correct. Until we have more info, I can’t say whether or not they are also interacting with the scene along with Sherlock.
Now, don’t misunderstand me. I truly think that Sherlock has always had a stronger emotional attachment to John than vice versa.
as a real timeline ending to
The entire diner scene, in fact, seems to me to be Sherlock trying to appeal to John’s love for the secrets and danger of their past lives. This is still early in the episode and Sherlock still doesn’t understand that what he did was wrong. Because John always forgives Sherlock, right? No problems, let’s just move on. However, John’s just fresh off of a
, John becomes “friend” after John called Sherlock ‘friend’, then subsequently lets it slip that John is more than that
Isn’t it just? This is why I love this series so much. It’s the LITTLE TINY THINGS that get put in and we all find later on. I have to seriously wonder if they do it to keep us entertained during the hiatuses.
“Yeah?” John chuckles, his own hands smoothing along Sherlock’s chest, up his neck, and back down. “Mm, my patients will be pleased to know.”
, or “retroactive continuity”, which basically means to create a new narrative from a current one and make that one the current one. I have actually talked quite a bit about the ret-conning issue before, when EMP was in its infancy.
God, he loved John
“We could do it together?” Sherlock suggests. “I found the preciseness of the recipes helped with my anxiety a bit.”
. Why do I think this? Because of this line right here:
To drive the stake in even deeper, John is actually really hurt by the fact that he believed Sherlock, of all people, trusted John explicitly. Remember, from John’s point-of-view, this scene at the diner comes across as Sherlock feels he can’t even trust the singular man who killed for him – his “I’ve just got one” friend!
John returned, still smiling that stupid John-smile that made John’s face look ten years younger and was only for Sherlock. He reached out a hand to help Sherlock off the bench. “Coming?”
Flushing slightly, Sherlock exclaimed, “Yes! Yes, sorry, John, I just saw something I really liked and I just was surprised, is all.” It wasn’t a complete lie, after all. Sherlock liked John. A lot. Much more than humanly necessary, if he was honest with himself.
. Perhaps at first it was genuine elation at finally having someone around who could tolerate him, and in turn he became very attached to John, which was, judging by other characters’ reactions to John being around,
. Kudos and thank you for that!
Sherlock pinches his own cheeks again to regain the flush, smacks his lips to ensure the taste of the gloss is still there, and then thinks about where he should stand for John’s arrival. He has about 3 seconds to decide, for he could hear John tread his way up the stairs to their flat. He decides upon leaning his hand on the table, just slightly off to the side so John could see the sunflowers when he got in. He puts his other hand into the pocket with his cube, and fiddles with the five-buttoned side of it, which he pushes in time with John’s steps on the stairs. In the last second, he settles on putting a smouldering expression on his face.
know that?”
John’s eyes widened, and then he blushed prettily. “Oh…”

. In fact, if I had to place my bets now solely based on what I have seen during setlock, I’m gonna have to go with S4′s falling action to occur near the end and into S5x01, and S5x02 will lead into the denouement. So yes, I believe there is 5 seasons based solely on the structure of the narrative, setlock, and the quotes.

“…And so are you,” Mrs Hudson tutted, straightening herself up and patting Sherlock’s shoulder. She walked back to the counter and continued to empty the bag’s contents onto the counter. “Cooking is just chemistry, Sherlock. You’ll enjoy it! All its preciseness will help you with your anxiety over tonight.” She glanced up and raised up her index finger. “But, you have to have

happen in the mind palace either. It’s Sherlock’s brain, he can imagine it however he wants. But it also needs to be OUT of the “imagination” too, because, like I said in the main meta, it cannot be a fantasy kiss.
For a tl;dr: my conclusion is that considering the shitloads of evidences, this is not a stand-alone episode at all. And the fact it will be set in Sherlock’s mind palace is more than probable.

John’s character arc has to occur from John’s perspective, whether through an exposition dump, subplot arc,
Sherlock frowned and watched John meander around the common room, lifting and replacing papers on the various tables and griping under his breath about someone being a “git” and where his keys were this time. If John wanted to do some doctoring so bad, he could stay at home, be one of those online consultants or something. Or better yet, Sherlock could lay out naked on his bed and let John examine

The butterflies dance in Sherlock’s stomach. “Both?” he manages, though he couldn’t help making it a question. It didn’t matter, it still earns him John’s Smile #1: ridiculous fondness, incredulity and affection – Sherlock’s favourite. He finds himself releasing the cube in his pocket, and taking his hands out, pulled toward John’s approaching form. “Shepherd's pie. Vegetarian, of course.”
When they snuggle up, sated and sleepy, under the blankets, Sherlock in his customary “Little Spoon” position, he reflects upon just how lucky he is to be held by the man nuzzling his nose into Sherlock’s neck.
Surprisingly okay. He took a larger bite and chewed, savouring the sweetness of the cornbread mixed with the flavour of the hot dog, trying to not think about ‘sweet meat sticks’ and failing miserably.
I said,” replied Sherlock, swallowing another bite as if trying to prove a point. He showed John his chewed corn dog. John nodded, and proceeded licking at his own, which Sherlock just now realized was coated in mustard. Up, and down, John tongue went along the shaft – DOG. Along the dog – stopping to suckle at the tip again, then biting into it.

And boy, did he see. Sherlock's mind blanked briefly, his eyes blinking rapidly as he tried to regain focus of this monumental moment. How was the world still turning with John Watson –
John was very good at commanding attention, Sherlock had mused to himself. Seeing John glowing with happiness and his beautiful eyes sparkling in mirth did many things to Sherlock’s stomach and his libido, constantly reminding him just how much he loved this man.
Mrs Hudson offering to help Sherlock make it was a moot point.

All while Sherlock is dealing with his own emotional turmoil. This episode is
Sherlock can only nod as a burst of warmth floods all over his body at the praise. He pulls off the oven mitts and sets them aside. He proceeds to cut John a large helping and puts it on his plate, then cuts one for himself. John reaches over and pours them each a glass of wine while he waits until Sherlock sits down. John then enthusiastically takes a bite of the pie – a loud, pleasurable moan follows that sends a shiver up Sherlock’s spine.
Before I begin, I should probably state how

When we study the characters and their arcs, we need to look at this series as a whole.
” Sherlock complains, attempting to not make it sound like a whinge but failing spectacularly. As if to prove his point, Sherlock flops one of his arms over his eyes and hangs the other down off the sofa. His good leg flops off the sofa onto the floor, straight out. His toes curl in and out, which John takes as a sign that his frustration levels with the situation have reached that precipice dividing ‘stroppy Sherlock’ from ‘unbearable tyrant’, which usually ended in a huge verbal fight, John leaving the flat for a few hours and the two of them feeling awkward with each other for days. John does not like those moments; time to diffuse before it ends in tears. John knew that it was mostly being brought on by Sherlock wanting John to pay attention to him, more than it being actual boredom.
I agree with you 100% that this is a special mind palace, and it does go a bit out of control. Why, I don’t know; perhaps Sherlock’s feelings are overwhelming him and this is how he’s dealing with it.
John chuckles. He pushes his head into Sherlock’s. “And my blog.”
old post back when I had like 10 followers, so it’s gotten lost in the fray. And now, after seeing the new trailer, it reminded me of this little thing I noticed and I am
WAITWAITWAITWAIT!!! HOOOLLLDD EVERYTHING.  DOES NOONE REMEMBER THE PART WHERE THE PLANE IS LANDING? WHERE SHERLOCK IS CRYING??
Sherlock grips John’s hand in return, relaxing his posture once again and resuming his eating. A thought comes to his mind, though.
is an interesting episode. It’s one I really had a hard time grasping until I read a lot of meta on it
. So do read that. It covers EMP in relation to TJLC and it’s an excellent read. Essentially, EMP is rewriting one conspiracy theory with another, and they contradict each other, given the subtextual nature of TJLC and all the evidence from ALL episodes that support it.
Now, I’m sorry if it seems I got a bit off track from your initial observation, but I thought it important to see how
when Sherlock falls after the Watson domestic. Again, starting EMP from either of these time frames:
“I wasn’t hiding it,” Sherlock huffed trying to reach for the tea upside down.
We won’t see the plane landing, but instead Mary, John, and Mycroft gathered around unconscious Sherlock in a room
unattainable, that he is just as much a man as John. And we need this moment to happen when it’s just the two of them.
“Oh, Sherlock.” John shuffles his arm out from under Sherlock and wraps it around him, his other hand taking Sherlock’s teacup from Sherlock’s shaking hands and putting it on the side table next to John’s. He feels Sherlock shudder a breath as John wraps his other arm around Sherlock, and nosing his face into Sherlock’s hair. “You silly, silly man.”

with him.
I think you are right on the nose about John knowing he is attracted to Sherlock,
I have a theory / headcanon that a huge reason why we haven’t seen Harry yet is because I think she’s going to serve as LITERAL MIRROR for John… I think she might be John’s TWIN sister, and a lot of the reason he stays away from her is because he literally sees himself in her. He needs to face that in order to move forward with his life with Sherlock.
Anyway. The point I’m trying to make is from a narrative stance, it doesn’t make any sense regarding character and world building, and from a financial stance, it’s a HUGE financial risk to the BBC if this was going to all be in Sherlock’s head –
Welcome to Johnlock Hell™.

At the time, I’m sure we thought nothing of it, just Sherlock being Sherlock… but now that we are three seasons in and know so much more about the characters, I believe that not only was this an attempt at Sherlock allowing John to deduce things on his own

It has to be this. Mofftiss is not lazy enough to say: “we want to do a victorian Sherlock, let’s do it without care if it fits in the story.” No, i’m sure they didn’t make it on “it’s own bubble” that’s just no the way this show works. Also there’s this Mark Gatiss’ tweet saying something like: “Don’t worry, it’s episode 10!”  It has to fit in the story, somehow, and this is the theory that makes more sense.
This is all very interesting and very very clever. I wonder how would you
Following this episode, the Battersea incident probably gave Sherlock the courage to chance calling John his friend once again in
Upon disembarking from the Ferris wheel, their hands had found each other as if it was the most natural state of existence for the two of them. Sherlock didn’t even notice until John had pointed out he wanted to
In summation, I’m really honestly not trying to ruffle any feathers; I am trying to show everyone why my brain just can’t get away from the current narrative. For me, EMP does not fit into my reading of the show, and I cannot make logical sense of it. We have already seen the writers’ intention at the end of
“I made you dinner.” Sherlock straightens up to his full height, putting his other hand in his pocket and subtly pushing his rear out just a bit to enhance it. His untameable curl pops out of place and drops in front of his eye. He tries his best to ignore it.
. Remember,
The kissing starts softly, with Sherlock’s upper lip braving at joining in on the action. Sherlock wiggles his hands free from under John’s grip and replaces them back on John’s head, pushing John into his face once again. He becomes slightly more enthusiastic at this point, now insisting on sucking on John’s lips.
As for the graveyard scene, I think this is John and Mary at the graveyard
like he once was, which makes the aching a
ASDASD NUMBER THREEEEEEEE OMG. Sorry, I had to add this to the main post because it was amusing to me. I still hold strong that the special is taking place in his MP during the plane trip. But there have been other theories, presented in this version I’m reblogging of this post, that are also very very plausible and a good alternative to my theories!
I think Sherlock, with good intentions, believes he is doing John a kindness by not needlessly worrying him by revealing that,
“And you don’t deny being a git. You are silly, though. Most people use words, Love.”
,” John stated, emphasizing part of the last word deliberately, lowering his voice, petting at Sherlock’s curls. He bent down to Sherlock’s ear, “off of all kinds of meat sticks.” John pulled back, looked Sherlock right in the eyes, tugged at Sherlock’s hair gently, licked along the length of the corn dog and tongued
“Well, it certainly smells like it is most definitely your area. The flat smells divine.” John pulls back, much to Sherlock’s annoyance. “Why don’t you get us some of your delicious concoction, I’ll cancel Angelo’s and we’ll have a night in, just you and me. A perfect first date night, wouldn’t you say?”
. John’s letting him be himself, and vice versa, because it’s just the two of them against the rest of the world. AHHHHH!!
Damn John to hell, he knew exactly what the hell he was doing. Damn him DAMN HIM, damn –
and a huge chunk of
and John immediately corrects Sherlock that they are colleagues. Now,
“John!” Sherlock called out just as John was making his way to the door. John turned, his eyebrow quirked. Sherlock pointed to his lips.
“Well, you’re doing your best to try to convince me that you’re ill and deserve pampering,” John chuffs as he sips his own tea, holding it steady as Sherlock attempts to turn his torso around to look at John better.
Six months is a HUGE gap, especially when it seems like a lot has happened and we were not privy to it
John giggles. “You hate my jumpers.”
“John.”
Said man sighed heavily to himself, his eye twitching, hidden from Sherlock’s view behind the newspaper John was attempting to read in his chair.
Listen, if John didn’t go through his own character arc the past 3 seasons, wouldn’t it seem REALLY,
But right now, John is content petting Sherlock’s hair, as Sherlock dozes off again, sharing this moment together.
thoughts on. He liked that one the most.
Makes me wonder if John had himself a little internal dialogue while he was in the washroom, like:
. To me, this seems like several people are basically wanting to rewrite
“Sirrrock,” John tries to speak from his squished lips. This seems to make Sherlock suddenly aware of what he’s done, because he lets go of John’s head as if burned, and the deer-in-headlights look on his face breaks John’s heart. John is certain that if Sherlock hadn’t broken his foot – and if John wasn’t holding him so tightly –  Sherlock would have flounced off and hid in his room for days.
. Because I believe that
Then of course John comes back and tells him to shut up and locks up again.
“John, oh god, I don’t know –” Sherlock started, his face beet red and his hands shaking where they hover above his head. John reaches for Sherlock’s hands and tuck them against Sherlock’s chest, under his own where John is hugging Sherlock tightly. Sherlock blinks rapidly, trying to comprehend why John hasn’t shoved Sherlock away.

, I don’t think I can point them out right now with certainty. But the long-short of it is that Sherlock is nearing the end of his character arc
DAMN JOHN.
A disclaimer before I start, since a lot of my followers who I adore and respect and am mutuals with do support EMP:
He scans his surroundings again – perfection. John would definitely want to stay forever now. It was homey and lovely and smelled like happiness.
John ordered one for himself, and asked Sherlock if he wanted one, who nodded. John took the two corn dogs and handed one to Sherlock as John put the tip of the dog in his mouth.
, I think, and that will come to the forefront in S4. I talk a bit more about this point in point #5.
And there they sit muttering sweet nothings and confessions between kisses, tasting the sweetness of “I love you”, the bitterness of revelations and unspoken words, the tang of confessions of love discovered. They share in the glow of love confirmed, and the warmth of hearts once broken now made whole. They fall asleep together, there on the sofa, wrapped up in each other’s hearts.

Haven’t worked out why John thought they wouldn’t be searched again at the house, but I’m thinking it may have something to do with John having his own plan in the works. It’s a big clustereff in my head, to be honest.
? So Sherlock won’t shoot Magnussen? Then whatever Mycroft and John have planned won’t be ruined? I like this.
The look Sherlock gives John can only be described as ‘horrified’, his fork hovering in front of his mouth. A piece of celery falls off and back onto the plate.

in Sherlock’s head, but if she’s been involved since S1, and EMP doesn’t start until S3 then it really can’t work, since I feel like Sherlock can’t just imagine her involvement, wake up and all of it not happening, only then to write a whole new story arc later on. So, as I mentioned in Part 4, this season is not the one to "tie up loose ends”, which the 6-month time jump absolutely is. It will be explained. It has a reason to be there.
In the second set of pics from
. Of course we haven’t met Harry yet, but one would think that’s gonna be a very special confrontation.
Perhaps another phrase can be added on here as well, said by Sherlock himself:
“Well, you git,” John starts, rooting around the cupboard for some peppermint tea and honey, “you wouldn’t have needed one in the first place if you hadn’t jumped three stories into a skip.” John glances back at Sherlock, who has taken up watching John upside down as he hangs his torso off the sofa, “Which is ‘Not Good’, by the way.” Sherlock actually looks mildly chastened by this. “And
Sherlock himself might not be aware of the mp in the first place.
“Oh shush, you idiot,” chuckles John, fondness oozing from his lips. “You love it.” John brings up one of his hands to pet at Sherlock’s curls; the grunt of pleasure Sherlock emits sends a shiver down John’s spine. “Adore it, even. Would have never taken you for a cuddler, though. Thought you hated all this sentiment stuff.”
“You did indeed, Sherlock. But that’s no excuse for hiding a broken foot for almost two hours. You’re lucky it wasn’t anything more serious than a hairline fracture.” The kettle boiled, and John poured Sherlock’s tea, adding extra honey into it. It was a treat he often gave to Sherlock in times when Sherlock’s moods were really black. It was also useful in making an impending dark mood dissipate immediately, for some reason. He poured his own tea and added milk, then grabbed the two mugs and proceeded out into the common room toward the sofa upon which Sherlock was liquefying. Sherlock’s gaze watched him the entire time, John noticing it already losing its irritated gleam now that John was paying him attention.
The only reciprocation we have yet to see are the hug and the knee grope. Granted the latter was under inebriation, the hug was not, and JOHN made the first move. Sherlock is then surely soon to be reciprocating that in a big way.

Those were John Watson’s first thoughts when he began to gain awareness after his deep sleep. He breathed in heavily through his nose; the smell of cinnamon, chemicals, and something utterly
“Mmmm,” John moaned, his eyes hooded and a bit of mustard on the corner of his lip.
John released Sherlock when they arrived at the booth, and reached into his pocket for a tenner. “I know you like seeing me shoot, Sherlock,” John whispered coyly to Sherlock, glancing at him and smirking.
“Is-sow-i-owe-oo-uv-eee,” Sherlock tells John’s cranium.
“No, it’s… it’s good. Very good.” John pulled Sherlock up by his elbow, supporting him to ensure Sherlock could stand okay. He picked up the plush bee and handed it to Sherlock, who held it strategically in front of his wet trousers. He was very thankful that John got it for him. “How about we head back, have some dessert in the room?” John waggled his eyebrows. “I heard from the front desk that the store next door has iced lollies to die for.”
won’t go unappreciated,” Sherlock mumbles, now making sure John sees him take a hearty gulp of tea. He turns back so his spine is now leaning once again into John. John chuckles and sits deeper into the sofa.
Maybe if he pretended Sherlock wasn’t there, Sherlock wouldn’t see him.
Sherlock is a terrible kisser, John thinks with fondness, but he doesn’t mind in the least. It’s endearing, actually, because Sherlock’s enthusiasm is making up for it, turning his head this way and that as best as he can from his reclined position, sometimes missing John’s lips all together and sucks on the corner of John’s mouth at one point. John giggles at this, which causes Sherlock to pull John’s head away so he can look him in the eyes again.
John blinks, looks down at his own bouquet of flowers – carnations – and then back up at Sherlock.
. John trusted, and Sherlock broke his trust by not trusting in return. For all intents and purposes, Sherlock was his brother-at-arms… in battle you can only trust your comrades, and John thought that’s what they were, but from John’s POV, Sherlock’s apparent indifference of the situation

Sherlock snorted, “I most certainly can!” He tried to reach for the retreating teacup, but failed as John put it on his own side table.

So, to answer if it’s weird how you think John feels, not at all, Nonny! It’s how you read the character, and no one person’s reading is correct or incorrect unless proven by canon! If we all read the characters the exact same way, there wouldn’t be all the fandom shipping and whatnot. It’s my belief that we are dab smack in the middle of one large series-long relationship story arc, so we really don’t know what is really in store for our heroes

Love this, and I agree, though I would like to point out that Sherlock also says he’s a sociopath in his conversation with David. And refers to it when he tells Molly that not all the men she falls for have to be sociopaths. Still I agree!
Here are the main reasons I can’t get behind EMP:
I really had to sit down and think to write this, because for the life of me I have a very hard time understanding John Watson. He is one of the most complex characters in the programme. As well, I relate more to Sherlock’s character than I do John’s so I just really have a hard time writing about John.

Sherlock subtly adjusted himself as he stood up and walked over to pick up his iPad on the living room table, opening up the web browser where he tabbed a recipe for vegetarian shepherd’s pie, something John had mentioned once that his sister used to make for him whenever she was sober and he stayed with her on leave from service.

Sherlock grins at this offer, and he nods, helping John out of his coat, then gestures to John’s seat for him to sit.
“I agree!” said John, responding to something Sherlock apparently said out loud. John looped his arm into the crook of Sherlock’s elbow as they began to walk.
. To bring us to your point, Sherlock can’t really understand why John has pushed him away because doesn’t he care about Sherlock? They’re friends right? This was always how they were with each other… and now for some reason John is angry with him, not delighted like he thought. Eventually they make up but their dynamic has changed.
Oy, this boy has it bad. And look at John’s left eye… What is that little wink John gives Sherlock?? Is that a “we’ll talk later” wink? Then look at this:

Just as he is heading to the kitchen, the oven’s timer beeps its completion. The flat smells heavenly – like home and love.

But if John is so terrible at telling lies, how did he convince Mary, who in
He shuts off the oven, leaving the pie in it to keep warm until John arrives home. Still a bit worried about the crispy bit, Sherlock pockets his cube and thumbs over the smooth, concave side of it, which he uses to ‘smooth away intrusive thoughts’.

. We don’t know when Sherlock got out of hospital. John has been established as a BAMF who doesn’t take any shit from anyone anymore, yet he’s seemingly okay with his not-wife killing his best friend. And Christmas is just such a transparent set up for Mary that it’s ridiculous people think it's actually genuine.
So, Sherlock claims, on-screen in canon, “I’m a high functioning sociopath”
Sherlock had been setting the candles around the room when John had texted him that he was on his way to the Tube station. The bubble of anxiety was pushing its way back into Sherlock’s stomach, so he walks to his cube and flicks the switch on and off a couple times. Satisfied, he proceeds to the fridge where the pie is now waiting to be baked. He switches on the stove to the proper setting, and places the pie into the oven. He closes the oven door with a flourish, sets the timer, and nods to himself. John would be home in 45 minutes; that would give the pie plenty of time to aromatize the flat and to bake to perfection.
“Okay,” Sherlock said warily, eyeing the picture of what appeared to be a Twinkie on a stick. Which didn’t make sense because it smelled like hot dogs and corn bread… OHHHHH. ‘
That all being said, why do I think Sherlock tips the scales?
I believe Mrs. Hudson knows what John wants to say to Sherlock, and I’m sure she made her own assumptions on what he said there at the graveyard. But when I think of their first interactions in
Anyway, are you seeing how convoluted this is getting? We’re turning Sherlock’s head into a whole other world, which poses the risk of becoming a reboot. There’s a lot of stipulations that must be taken into account, all of which REALLY destroys the current narrative and over-complicates things.

“Now, please tell me where you put my keys, Sherlock,” John stated softly, stroking his fingers soothingly on the spot behind Sherlock’s left ear that he loved so much. “I know you hide my keys every morning, Love.”

Sherlock in turn tells his own half-truths to help John survive. Unfortunately, Sherlock’s actions upon his return are misinterpreted by John to mean that Sherlock cannot trust him. John sees it like this: John “trust issues” Watson has given all his trust to Sherlock 100%, and the thanks he gets is Sherlock lying to him for two years, making light of the fact John grieved for him, and being forced into forgiving the madman. Suddenly, John needs to question everything their entire relationship has and will ever be.
Just saving her time. Isn’t that kinder?
“I did it because I love you,” Sherlock explains, leaning his forehead into John’s. “I don’t tell you ever, but I really do. Love you. So much that it hurts sometimes, John.” Sherlock tries not to panic.
I know that these gifs are far from compelling evidence of TJLC, but I find that they tie into the Episodic Bible of TJLC rather nicely: Sherlock discovers he’s in love – something a sociopath is apparently not capable of
John can tell a convincing lie if he needed to. The actual truth is not that Sherlock thinks John is a bad actor / liar, but that he KNOWS John is constantly being followed since his association with Sherlock.
, so I think a lot of the “missing time” from a several episodes will be filled in… and it will be because of Mary’s involvement in the narrative and to establish her to the audience that, yes she’s a villain and no, we are not supposed to root for her.

And later still they will share kisses and moans as they make love in Sherlock’s bed, after Sherlock decides that he just isn’t close enough to John sitting practically in his lap, and John will tell Sherlock how beautiful he is.

The smell is so heady to John; he fears he is dreaming, at least until he brings his arms around the man cuddled against his chest. John’s arms grip tightly around Sherlock’s back, pulling the Sherlock-shaped limpet up closer to his own face. Said limpet finds this an agreeable idea, and makes the effort to shuffle up, positioning himself so that his whole body is lying right on top of John, wrapping his own arms under John’s shoulders. Sherlock buries his face in the crease of John’s neck and damaged shoulder, and proceeds to nuzzle it with his nose. Sherlock’s morning stubble is rubbing pleasantly against his own.
John’s no longer dating anymore, just basically accepted that he pines for Sherlock, an unattainable person in his eyes. John has put Sherlock on this ridiculously high, god-like pedestal, which I think John feels is safe for him because that makes Sherlock unattainable and therefore John doesn’t need to fear that he will fall in love with him.

“I know you did, Sherlock. But I see you kept busy today.” John’s hands fall to Sherlock’s chest.
WITH that in mind, let us now look at the diner scene.
Glancing back up at the flat’s entrance, Sherlock furrowed his brow as he heard John descend the stairs. He then heard John call a cheerful goodbye to Mrs Hudson, whom he bumped into as she was coming up the stairs. John didn’t

I think it will be proven that John is, in fact, a great liar, since, you know, it has subtly already happened. No man is a doctor and a soldier AND Sherlock Holmes’ best friend without being able to hide SOME things. Either way, I’m rather enjoying the rather meta way that TPTB feed us their own half-truths and lies to protect what they love and look forward to having the real truths revealed.

wants. Remember, to him, love is a vicious motivator in many of the murders he investigates, so he probably has a very negative view of what true love really is, and probably is refusing to call what he’s feeling love. If you’ll notice, after Sherlock realizes Molly was in love with him at Christmas, he stopped being callous and conniving with her the rest of the series: He was blindsided about the fact that people just may actually like him for being himself. So when Sherlock hears Irene’s declaration of his and John’s coupleness and John’s not-denial of her “look at us both”, Sherlock’s head is in a weird space – for the first time this series, his eyes have been opened to John’s feelings for him.

“Mrs Hudson helped a little.” Sheepish, but not ashamed. “I’ve never cooked a big meal before… I needed a bit of, ah, instruction on how to decipher the recipe. Not my area.” Sherlock rests his nose on John’s head, inhales. Bliss.
The tragic and rather ironic thing about the ENTIRE situation is that
– John may not necessarily be unable to lie, but he has a lot of physical tells that, if anyone were to observe John, they would be able to discern whether or not he is hiding something
. Non-mind palace participants are all there, and the mind palace characters are frozen.

“Date night!” That’s what John had stated this morning after he kissed the top of Sherlock's head on his way past Sherlock hunched over his microscope. Sherlock had glanced up, and took in the morning paper rolled under John’s arm
It could be argued that it’s probably true, again out of context, but
And of course, John had to go and ask, “Oh?” as he searched the area for something that Sherlock possibly would have liked. John was so silly and oblivious sometimes that it hurt Sherlock’s brain.

Mycroft tells Sherlock to find something to calm himself down, he then closes his eyes and is suddenly running down a set of stairs. I believe this is evidence of him entering another mind palace within his mind palace – literally going DOWN STAIRS to a second level of his mind palace

not fully defeated, and John is still in danger, regardless, and therefore Sherlock will not allow himself to initiate a relationship with John.
There is a tendency to make Sherlock and John opposites who fit together perfectly. While Sherlock needs to realise he is *not* Mycroft, but equally good, it makes sense for John to see the ways he *is* like his family, who he has seemed to have written off completely as dysfunctional. Sherlock doesn’t have to subvert huge parts of himself in an effort to be like Mycroft

John’s completely wrong belief is that he was kept out of the loop for the past 2 years because he just wasn’t trustworthy enough for Sherlock. It explains his cautious behaviour towards Sherlock the rest of the season – he forgives Sherlock, that I believe, but the tension is
John smiles widely, turning his nose down into Sherlock’s hair, and inhales.

This is not some random serial done by Hollywood broadcasters to make a quick buck. BBC wouldn’t fund a long-term project that they didn’t feel would be important in the long run. This is the BBC funding 3 feature-length episodes every few years because they feel that the story being told is a good one. Sherlock is a financial and credential gain for them in the end, and you can be sure as shit that

“I just want to impress John,” Sherlock muttered as he returned to the kitchen, showing the recipe he had chosen to Mrs Hudson.
It makes NO SENSE to keep dragging it out when we are at the pinnacle of the story.
John hands Sherlock his teacup, which Sherlock delicately takes and brings around himself to his lips. He hums contentedly, which John feels through his shoulder. A second, bigger sip is heard, and a surprised “oh” escapes Sherlock’s lips. “You added extra honey!” he says, turning his head so he can see John in his peripheral vision.

“Already have.” Sherlock gestured vaguely to his groin area.
John’s eyes twinkle. “Sounds delicious,” he answers, walking into Sherlock’s outstretched arms. “All I had was a reservation at Angelo’s and this bouquet of flowers.” He nods to said flowers lamely, then puts them on the table at Sherlock’s place-setting, only then seeing the sunflowers and card Sherlock had put at John’s. John smiles back up at Sherlock, and Sherlock tugs at John’s hips to move him closer. John reaches one arm over Sherlock’s shoulder, and the other hand up to the stray curl, brushing it back into Sherlock’s other curls.
She patted his arm, a warm smile on her face. “I know, Dear. Now, let’s prep this meal, and all you’ll have to do is pop it into the oven when John lets you know he’s on his way home!”
Here’s what I speculate: Modern bits will bookend the episode. The episode will start with John and Mary at the graveyard, giving us more questions than answers. Mycroft comes to get them. Fade to the airport and Sherlock standing by the plane, watching the car arrive, with the camera then panning to behind Sherlock to help establish that from here, this is in Sherlock’s POV. Literal fast forward to Sherlock sitting in the plane on the runway, and Sherlock’s hand touching his mouth. We then realize the “fast forwarding” was Sherlock storing away the entire tarmac scene within his mind palace. That’s the first 30 seconds or so of the 4 minutes. As he’s taking off, he’s thinking about John, Mary, love, whatever, and somehow we transition into the mind palace. Episode happens, transition out of mind palace, Sherlock realizes the attendant was talking to him. Modern bits of him coming off the plane, returning to Baker Street or whatever, and tie it into S4x01 somehow.
Holy cow, Nonny, I’m so sorry!! This got lost in my drafts before my computer crash and I JUST found it! I put it aside because I have a harder time reading John’s character than Sherlock’s so I wanted to sit on your question for a bit, and then it totally got lost in the kerfuffle. Better late than never, I suppose :)
hit his consciousness and the previous evening’s events flash into his immediate thoughts.
So yeah, I’m still mostly for my main theory presented initially, but I thought about the “unconscious” theory and to me, the only thing that would send Sherlock’s thoughts so oddly out there would be him being on drugs or sleeping.
I think this is spot on, but the larger question for me is is it for show and protective… or do these characters actually believe this faulty self-analysis to be true,
“You don’t understand,” Sherlock pouted, suddenly losing interest in his plans for the day. “John gives me everything, and I give him nothing. I can’t even ask him properly for a kiss.” Sherlock really needed John here, right now; he felt like it was already all over.
Sherlock shakes his head minutely. “Not really. Though in hindsight it is fairly obvious.” Sherlock lifts his head again. “I guess I just didn’t want to hope too much.” Their foreheads touch. “I’ve loved you for too long, John. I couldn’t bear it if I was wrong about this one thing, so I just never let myself hope too much.”
upset that he didn’t verbally return the sentiment. But then again, John was incredibly skilled at hiding a lot from Sherlock – in fact, it took Sherlock seven years to figure out John loved him, and that was only because John
as if it’s a given that whatever John knows, Sherlock knows. It’s just such a casual and random line, like Sherlock always following John is a normal occurrence in their relationship. And John doesn’t even flinch or seem bothered by the fact that Sherlock followed him.
When Sherlock is dying, his “first level” mind palace is starting to fail.
only confirms TO JOHN that yes, Sherlock was following John around for two years and let John think Sherlock was dead. We’re never really told how much of the truth Sherlock let John in on, and I think that this is Sherlock’s own half-truth… Let John only know the barest of facts to protect the people Sherlock loves.

happened during the Hiatus, mainly because it was a short webisode and was mostly played up for comedy value. However, I think it contains an important piece of evidence as to why Sherlock was so taken aback about the reunion: Sherlock thinks/knows all of John’s friends hate him, and he TOLD John that they hate him; He says he wrote an essay based on their suppressed hatred and gave it to John as a gift. Because of this, Sherlock feels he is John’s ONLY true friend
“Well, I wanted to be certain, you see,” John replied, taking the toy from the man, “Sherlock really likes bees.”
I’m going to address instead the thoughts and theories I can expand upon, so here we go.
John thought fondly as he set Sherlock’s tea on the table in front of the sofa, and sat himself into the space currently not occupied by Sherlock’s upper body.
Sherlock did like corn dogs, very much. And so did Sherlock’s cock, apparently, because it absolutely decided that was the perfect time to express its excitement by making a mess in his trousers. “Hnng!” he grunted, dropping his corn dog as John licked the mustard off his lips.

This is the deception that Sherlock has created in his own mind to protect himself and his feelings.

Okay so
“Yuh–Yes, okay,” Sherlock stammered as John lead them towards the games, Sherlock being pulled by John’s very existence, just as he always had been. John insisted Sherlock play a few games with him, and Sherlock was rather proud he had done well on the ball-toss game that won him a silly toy magnifying glass with the name of the town on its handle. It had made John grab for it and lightheartedly mock Sherlock. The two had giggled as they walked away from the stall, John reaching behind Sherlock and tucking the magnifying glass into Sherlock’s back trouser pocket, lightly brushing his fingers across his bum to find the pocket's slit. The move had made Sherlock jolt and stumble.

That didn’t mean he wouldn’t indulge a bit first. “Under the sofa, left hand side, behind the front leg,” Sherlock replied, reaching around John’s waist to give him a light parting hug.
But because Sherlock absorbs everything “John” like a sponge, that first negative reaction put him off and
Now, I know not every EMPer is a TJLCer, and that’s fine.

The sudden thought of John’s morning stubble rubbing against his inner thigh while John is sucking him off slams into the forefront of his mind, and how the feeling made Sherlock go off in less than thirty seconds. Sherlock sniggers to himself – he wants to do that for John, too. With that thought, he decides to put on some lip gloss as well – John had often commented how sinful his lips were, so he figures there is no harm in encouraging that thought in John’s head. The gloss was tinted a soft pink, which made his lips even more prominent. Satisfied, he plucks a couple of his more wayward eyebrow hairs, and proceeds to their bedroom to put on one of his suit ensembles, choosing the aubergine shirt he knows John loves.

Perhaps we should start gathering information about the dates and years we have seen in setlock. We know 1894 and 1895 are confirmed years in the special. Six months in real time could easily equal several years in Sherlock’s mind palace, depending upon how often he is drugged up. I’m going to say maybe 2 months or so. I’m not sure how long a gunshot wound similar to Sherlock’s would take to heal, but it would need lots of meds to keep the pain down at the start, anyway.

Sherlock smiles, and presses his lips into John’s. “Worth it.” They share a tender kiss, then another. Lazy pecks to greet each other on this new day, the first day of the rest of their lives.
After failing to come up with anything on his own, ready to call in a favour to one of his former clients for a seat at a swanky restaurant, he happened to mention to Mrs Hudson yesterday that it was going to be their First Date Night as a Couple, and Mrs Hudson then promptly squealed in excitement, immediately beginning to plan for Sherlock something he can’t believe he never thought of doing.
