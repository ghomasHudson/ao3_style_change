“’Course.” Sherlock watched him hump the blankets up around his feet and settle down with a small sigh. Checking his watch, he noted 9:12 in the notebook. He didn’t turn back to the fire, though; instead, he watched as John fell asleep, his breathing slowing, then taking on that deep soft rhythm it did when he was particularly fatigued. Then, his body went limp under the covers, and Sherlock turned back to the fire.
"What about fish?" Sherlock asked.
John drew away before either he or Sherlock was ready, returning to little, light licks around the soft slick flesh. Sherlock writhed impatiently, but John held his hips immobile and forced him to take his pleasure at John’s rhythm. It was only when John knew that his time had nearly elapsed that he penetrated Sherlock with his tongue once more, and then, as the last few seconds ran out, seized Sherlock’s heavy, aching cock and stroked him until, as the timer rang, Sherlock came, his body stiff, then limp with pleasure.
John scoffed and pushed play. He headed back for the couch, grabbing a blanket on the way, and then settled in next to Sherlock.
Egan punched him solidly in the shoulder. Rhys recoiled, rubbing at his bicep.
“I am so sorry, Jane. Truly. If you need anything, you know I’m right across the hall.” He extended a hand to squeeze her shoulder.
John heard him storming the steps before he breached the flat. Watson tried his best to purse his lips and hold in the laughter traveling up his windpipe. He hid his face behind the paper when the door swung open, smacking against the rubber safety on the wall.
The violin rang out, beautiful and quiet and earnest. Callum’s eyes were drowning already. This was Molly. This composition encompassed everything she was: still, but never stagnant; earnest, but never overeager; kind and gentle and sweet, but never false or pretentious. It filled every crevice of your heart and sank softly in. Callum looked to Sherlock, who was settled next to Irene, and gave him a watery eyed nod. A silent thank you. Sherlock’s chin still against the violin’s rest, he gave a nearly imperceptible bow instead, as if to say
“That I did. And that’s just what I got, isn’t it?”
“I just don’t know what to do with them, B. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Assigned seats, bookwork, simple projects, very involved projects, free choice, no choice. I’m stuck. I’m stuck, and I hate who I’ve become with them.” She picked at her thumb and stared into her glass.
“Well, yeah… he doesn’t have many friends, you see, or family, so he stays quite busy with other things.” John found that hard to believe. Sherlock didn’t seem particularly off-putting. Why didn’t he have friends? “He solves cases for NSY. Sometimes. If he’s available.”
or am I drowning?
He allowed himself the pleasure of resting his eyes on the best man. John stood next to Callum, hands clasped in front of his hips with a resilient posture. Sherlock wondered if he was raised by a military man; so many things about John seemed meticulously in check. Even his hair, mussed about with product, looked perfect.
“I’m sure he was a great man.”
“Do people tell you how delicious you are, Sherlock? When they make love to you? They should. They should praise you and lick every inch of your perfect skin. They should run their nails down your back and keen at your touch.” John’s voice was throaty and dark, flooded with lust. Sherlock moaned and gripped himself a little tighter, his movements picking up speed. He could feel a sweat breaking out across his forehead. How hungry he must look. He found the doctor through half-lidded eyes, holding himself firmly through his trousers. Sherlock allowed a smug smile to cross his lips. John stood and moved toward him. The detective felt his breath hitch in his chest, fantasy after fantasy whipping through his mind. Would John touch him? Would he hit his knees and take Sherlock in his mouth? Would he fold Sherlock in two, allowing eager fingers, or fuck, an eager tongue, access? Would he grab him by the jaw and kiss him tenderly? Any and all options would be heaven, Sherlock knew. The proximity put him at the edge.
“Nothing to worry about, Callum. Just a little tense from the travel. That’s all.” Callum rolled his eyes, knowing John was spouting bullshit. Rhys and Egan entered the restaurant, pulling up chairs to the too small tables and crowding them further with bagels and tiny cups of orange juice.
It was idiotic, but he had no choice. He clenched his eyes shut and focused, furiously, on slowing his breathing.
More to come... For all my amazing readers, thank you for staying kind and staying positive. So much has happened in the course of a year, I'm better for it, but I think it's time we return to our boys. Don't you?
Sherlock was standing resolutely by the window, violin still poised on his shoulder and his chin in the rest. He wasn’t tired, John decided, but he looked worn in. Not in the way John’s chair was, but in a way that would make one think Sherlock was much older than one would believe him to be.
“Sleep alright, boys?” John asked them, raising an eyebrow. Rhys looked a little worse for wear, but Egan looked alert and solid. As always.
“Two Imperials, coming your way.” She turned her back to the boys, pulling two glasses from the shelf, and settling them diagonally near the tap.
“Don’t even start that, Mols.”
*Xenia Hall is a dormitory on the Imperial College Campus, located two miles from Waterloo Station.
at me a certain way and my blood boils.”
“Sherlock.” Her voice mocked his in its depth and firmness. He felt the corner of his mouth pull up in a small smile.
he thought,
The lurch of her stomach brought her to her feet in the nave of the beautiful church. As everyone eyed her rising, Jane stumbled out of the pew and headed as gracefully as she could to the massive doors.
“And what destination is that, exactly?” Sherlock spat. The words were nothing special, but they stung like venom.
“Never apologize to me. You’ve nothing to be sorry for.”
. You are
Sherlock glanced up to John’s face and back to the soldier’s hips, which were conveniently located directly in front of him. “Quite.”
“So when do you intend to tell me where you learned to dance?” Sherlock was curled up on the couch, feet covered in wool socks and a thick knit blanket. John was bent over, head stuck in the fridge, debating his drink choice.
The fullback nodded in understanding and then dug his fingertips into his tired eyes and sighed.
The room then filled with murmuring baritones and tenors, quiet clunks on tables, and Sherlock’s soothing voice whispering, “hear, hear,” encouraging the other gentlemen in the room to do the same. Molly choked back a sob, moved by the ferocity of agreement, and Callum squeezed her into his side, planting a firm kiss on her temple.
Something writhed and burned hot and unkind inside Sherlock’s stomach. “Who is Harry, John?”
“Maybe,” John answered. “They’re no good honestly. Hardly worth your time.”
He took the stairs slowly, hoping to not wake Sherlock. He had no idea what time it was, but gauged it was between three and four. He walked into the living room to find Sherlock sprawled out on the nearly-too-small sofa, telly on and muted. He was sound asleep, his chest moving with deep, heavy breaths. One hand had fallen over the side of the couch, index finger barely grazing the rug. One knee was bent, causing his foot to tuck under the knee of the opposite leg. His head was propped up on the Union Jack pillow.
“May I see you again?” He’d figure out the logistics later. He didn’t care. All he knew was that this, whatever this was, whatever Sherlock was, this was something brand new, an adventure, a sensation and feeling that he had never felt coursing through him. It wasn’t a conquest; it wasn’t something to divulge in merely because it was at present, an opportunity. It was a gift. This man in his foyer was something incredible and John wanted to know him. Every bone, every freckle, every tiny scar, every crescendo he wrote, every grain of rice that left every takeaway box, every laugh and every tear, and every single thing Sherlock felt was important enough to say, God, John wanted to
“Callum.”
“You are not a mess; you are an enigma. One I would gladly invest in solving.”
he want Sherlock to say?
John sat comfortably on the floor in front of the sofa, working with his chopsticks to catch a shrimp in his lo mein. Sherlock was in one of his usual catlike positions on the couch, shouting at the telly.
“I’d rather go out to work.” John said. “No Lestrades will tell me what to do.”
"Unfair," he breathed, and dropped the towel.
“Sally.” He kept his expression neutral. How did one react in such circumstances? Unsure of himself, he advanced his hand. “From Carleton Academy.”
Byron. Certainly when he looked at Sherlock he felt quite like Byron apparently did when he looked at Isa. Sherlock's arse was much nicer, though.
John fumbled with the mother-of-pearl buttons on the fine wool drawers with a sense of trepidation that was almost entirely due to Sherlock’s state. He’d stopped shivering now, and though it was dark as the inside of a black cat, John would bet money that he didn’t have that Sherlock’s lips were blue. He needed to be dry and warm immediately, and a dram of brandy inside him as fast as he could be made to swallow. Otherwise—John did not care to think of the implications.
"Pity. We could have split the fee. Think it through next time." His mouth quirked and John had to laugh again.
“I only have two cups. Therefore, the full one is mine, and you can refill the other one.”
“You call his name when you have nightmares,” Sherlock said, and even the shadows on John’s face couldn’t hide that it wasn’t the first time he’d been told this.
“F—fine.”
“Get off my foot, ye goddamn bastard!” John’s words were heated, but his tone was not.  Sherlock peeked around the door to see Hamish leaning heavily on John as he drank from the pond. John’s hands were outstretched along the beast’s huge roan shoulder, slowly leveraging a ton of ox off his left boot. Each muscle in his forearm stood out, clearly defined; how much force was he exerting, Sherlock wondered, and how was it that his high-fat diet did not leave a single trace on his body? Something to be more closely examined, it was certain. He headed towards the house, his notebooks and tea.
True as it was, it was something that might be harder than medicine, even. John squared his shoulders and nerved himself to enter the cabin.
They jumped apart.
“Very well.” No use but to get it out of the way. He went to his things and pulled out the most stained piece of paper he could find. With his homemade ink (quite good staying power, but did tend to unevenness) he wrote the shortest missive he could manage.
Douglas’s face closed. "Yes, I recall that.  Your mother died very suddenly, and then... I don't think we'll talk about it. The Lestrades all came to her funeral. The Lestrades have certain traditions and they live up to them very strictly.  One of them is that nothing but candles shall be burned for light at New Moon--and another is that no quarrel must be carried past the grave.  They came when she was dead--they would have come when she was ill if they had known, I will say that much for them.  And they behaved very well--oh, very well indeed.  They were not the Lestrades of New Moon for nothing.   And then they offered to take you, and… take you and bring you up.  I refused. Did I do right, John?"
“It is. But you are my own. Aren’t you?” John said, not asking, but rolling over instead to straddle Sherlock’s belly. Sherlock made a half-hearted attempt to push him off, but it was really no true attempt. John’s thighs were warm against his sides, and his weight anchored Sherlock to the ground and also, somehow, to himself. He felt the now-familiar tightness gather at the base of his spine and sighed. The edge of fear he had felt before, the sense of wrongness, was almost completely gone. It was almost like magic, though Sherlock knew it was simple biology. What a fool he had been!
Sherlock approached the bed with enthusiasm, but slowed as he got closer. John sensed his apprehension, and sat up straight.
“You’re welcome to him,” John replied, but he clenched his fist nonetheless at the unexpected spike of jealousy. “He left squirrel entrails on the dishes last week. I nearly shot him.”
John nodded curtly and left the cabin.
My best thanks to Doctornerdington, who betaed the first part of this chapter under significant time pressure. I'm posting it all, because I want it up, but if you see any errors it's my fault. I'll repost the second part of the chapter once she's had a chance to work her magic.
“So you consider us both incompetent. How delightful.”
“Such sweet words.” Sherlock said, “Are you sure you’re not trying to woo me?”
“Sherlock, I am going to do…to make…an external examination. I will have …I’ll have to touch you, all right?”
The sun was low as John turned along Scotch Bush road. Scanning the forest, he shivered a little; things were harder to see at dusk, and each dark shape seemed slightly more sinister than it had that morning.
“I will.” Sherlock replied. Then, as John turned to go, “Thank you for saving my life,” he added.
Suddenly, the crackling sound of a mature tree breaking filled his ears. As if in slow motion, he saw a large spruce fall out of the woods at the side of the road. It was falling directly on to Arthur, who, to his credit, had sped up when he heard the crack. John leaned forward and urged him on faster still, and the back wheels of the wagon cleared the place where the tree fell just as the first branches touched the ground.
When he got back, Sherlock had collapsed to one side on the settle.
“Thanks, mate,” John replied, then frowned. He sipped his tea. It seemed to steady him, and he continued.
“And you didn’t attempt stimulation.” Drat! The doctor was not so easily deterred as the man.
“I…” John tried again. The misery on Sherlock’s face was pure torture. “I am not…averse.  I cannot, for very good reasons that you are entirely aware of—
John looked at Sherlock, rumpled and muddy, and steeled himself.  He was a grown man, with a strong will, and physical contact with this attractive person was not the hardest thing he had ever done.
“Perfect night for a fire,” John said, as he spread a cloth on the ground and set the food down.
“You couldn’t be more wrong.”
John checked his breathing—it was easy and smooth, and when he put his hand on Sherlock’s carotid pulse, at the base of long neck. A month ago, when Sherlock had been just an abstract imposition, he’d have wrung it, cheerfully. Now… he didn’t know what he wanted. No, he did. He wanted to touch. But he wouldn’t—Sherlock was unconscious, for a start, and he was a patient of sorts, and he came with an overprotective older brother who had too much power.
"Please," Sherlock said, and John did, gently, a brush of lips.
"Get inside!" he shouted at Sherlock. A chill shot through him; Sherlock must be terrified. Even the idea of a bear was enough to scare him; a real bear would be even more horrifying. "Bar it!"
“Possibly,” Cousin Mike replied, his brown eyes twinkling, and that was all he would say until Uncle Gregory and Great-Aunt Martha returned.
Sherlock looked at him, eyes clear.
He remembered the last night he had been truly happy.
John woke feeling rumpled, with an ache in his balls again. He felt feverish, almost sick, as if his emotions were poisoning him. He stared at the ceiling for a moment, then blinked and sat up.
John was not aware he had dozed off, but apparently he had, because when Harry’s shrill baaing pierced his consciousness, he leaped straight out of bed, stumbled, and fell like a tree, his whole length laid out on the ground.  He had barely realized what had happened before he sprang up, his wits coming back to him. The piercing wail continued, from closer this time, and Sherlock’s face shot over the edge of the loft.
John had to laugh at Sherlock's open admission of contrariness.
Once the goats were tethered and the animals all led down to drink, he felt better. It was ridiculous perhaps, but he knew Harry or Clara would send up the alarm if anything appeared in the farmyard.
"I'll attempt to test the level of avian intelligence via the humours; old-fashioned, I know, but the current theory is that feathered animals have a less-developed circulatory..."
“That’s what I heard before the tree fell,” John said. The tension in his shoulders was back, and he looked uncomfortable again.
“Christ, Sherlock,” John exclaimed. “We’d better stop.”
“And you did. More than you wanted to.”
Then, more footsteps were heard, and two new women, both large and matronly, came into the kitchen.
“Berk.” John coughed out, surprised by such a ridiculous statement. “You have said”—another cough—“that breathing was boring.”
“I...I should have prepared more thoroughly.” Sherlock admitted.
Sherlock breathed in. He would not tremble. He would not roll his hips. He would fall asleep, and he would fall asleep by counting geese. One
“Now, daylight in the springtime is not a good time to ask a bush farmer anything. I’m going to harness the oxen, and then to the field. Don’t make more work for me.”
Sherlock did so without comment, but he dropped the same knife three times in quick succession.
That night, they gathered bread, cheese, a knife, a bottle of port, and matches, and traipsed down to the south field. The sky was beginning to turn a pale orange, and the air was clear. A few mosquitoes rose up around them, but they were slow and stupid. The heat had subsided; there was no wind.
“They are significantly more intelligent than I imagined. Now, do you suppose you could help me inside? This ground is most uncomfortable.”
John rolled his eyes, but he came over nonetheless to see what Sherlock was dissecting: a dead bee.
He looked up.
“It smells wonderful.”
“Big timber area, eh?” John whispered, and felt Sherlock emit a silent but gratifying giggle. He squeezed Sherlock’s thigh under his coat and felt him tremble.
“Microphones, for a binaural effect.”
“Come here, then.”
Lunch is enjoyable.
“Talk.”
Yeah, okay.”
“Someone came and got him.”
John whispers it, licks his lips again.
John lays a hand atop his head, rubs his fingers into curls threaded through with silver and shorn closer than they had been when they were both younger.
“Yes.
“I never wear ties.
“Forgive me.
“You don’t have to push yourself like that, you know.”
John can feel a grin teasing the corners of his mouth again.
“No Mr. Holmes, I do not.”
Sherlock grins, slides up his body, the whole length of him providing the most delightful friction, and when he lets his weight settle down on top of him, John knows it’s right, because it’s there, that feeling of calm, of safety, of everything aligning and clicking into place.  When Sherlock cups his face in one of his large hands, and dips down to kiss him, slow and sweet, he wants to let go, he wants to come undone, and he does.
John says without hesitation.
He’s sitting on the edge of the bed ignoring everything that comes out of Sherlock’s mouth.
And it seems hardly fair considering John is stuck on the tube.
John wants to kiss him, but he’s afraid if he asks Sherlock to lean down, the angle will become impossible, so instead he just strokes him faster, starts to rock his hips in a rhythm, and hopes he knows, hopes he feels it, feels that John means it:
It appears Sherlock has struck him dumb.
“This is mad,” he finally whispers.
He munches on his toast, and flips open his laptop.
I’m here to ensure it’s the former.”
Sherlock finishes, and pats his hip again, but John can’t bring himself to roll back over.
He reaches up and wipes at his cheeks, and then frowns down at the dampness on his fingertips.
“No apologies.
Incomprehensible.
Sherlock blinks.
It was this long letter, and—there was so much of her in it.
Anything else?
“He okay?”
“You’re getting old.”
“And do you have any suggestions as to where we should start looking, Mr. Holmes?”
The librarian helpfully shows him how to renew his books online and he feels like an idiot.
“Yes, John!
“And cake!”
John shakes his head and sits up.
Sherlock nods and stares back down at the mattress.
- I think this was one of the first ASMR Artists I followed.  Her videos really are a mixed bag, so you can usually always find something you like (and she makes a cameo in this chapter, so watch for it).
Her hand is resting lightly on his forearm, where he has it crossed across his chest, eyes cast up the stairs.
“I did want you.
“Yeah?”
“Hi.”
John lays back down on the pillow, and pulls close, his fingers tracing Sherlock’s ribs, eyes searching his in the dim light of the room.
His bed has been slept in, but he’s been dead long enough for rigor mortis to set in, so a death that likely occurred in the wee hours of the morning.
They’re filming live, and he’s just said…
Perhaps John will deign to continue on with the cases.  That would be something.  Not enough, but better than nothing.
The safety of it.
“Oh yeah?
John just goes on chopping.
He stops, fingers toying with either side of the open placket of Sherlock’s shirt.
How…?
Sherlock huffs and smiles softly.
I can’t help if I don’t know what’s going on.”
What are we going to feed people?!”
“Good.
Muscle memory, bringing it all back.
No one has mentioned the ring on Sherlock’s finger yet, even though he’s been swanning about practically sticking it under Mrs. Hudson’s nose in the hope she’ll notice.
“Ahh, but it hasn’t ended well at all, has it?”
Saw your video.
He wasn’t unliked.”
“And a week before that, where the local police wasted precious time.”
John is too important to him, to ruin it all now.
He smiles.
“You sure the stuff you got was clean?”
“John…”
John seems tickled at the information, and Sherlock can’t tell why.
The whole flat is empty.
Sherlock holds out a hand, and John feels a sort of relief wash over him.
His cock makes contact with Sherlock’s thigh, and that is all it takes for his brain to shut off completely.
“Do you feel I’m wasting your time?”
He’d suggest they go back if not for the fact that Sherlock seems so keen on the case, so much so, that John has begun to suspect that it’s more than meets the eye.
“I guess you just never know about people.”
“When you told me about it this morning, it seemed like you assumed the decision had been made.
Not sure why I even started that.
He aches for him, for all the years of aloneness, and all the people who were idiots, who couldn’t see the miracle he was, and chose to judge, and hate, and abuse him instead—John included.
Sherlock had anticipated the offer of a low dose of paracetamol, but this…
“Have you two had a little bit of a row?
“Should have told me.”
“No.”
Sherlock nods.
John is sitting on the edge of the bed, staring down at him where he’s huddled in the corner.
I’d say so.
John balls his fist beneath the cage of Sherlock’s hand, but he doesn’t pull away.
“Not to my knowledge, no.
“Why not?
“You were unhappy?”
Sherlock finally turns his attention to their other guest, who up until now has been completely silent.
Of course you can.
“My nanna was a bit superstitious.
He snatches a dressing gown from his wardrobe, shrugs it on and leaves it open even though he’s only wearing pants beneath.
John is unlike anyone he’s ever felt attraction to.
John stares down at the wet spots spreading out over the legs of his trousers.
John smiles back.
Sherlock, you agree?”
If you’re feeling better later, you can cook us supper, like you planned.”
Also possible he’s just overlooked it, and is (
“Right. Okay.
“What?” Sherlock pants.
Sherlock spins, just as John comes up behind him, and John manages to hit him twice, once in the shoulder, and once in the thigh, before colliding and knocking him to the ground.
You’re in hospital.
Just what am I looking for?”
He thinks of the night he listened to Sherlock read aloud, and got off to it.
Gunshot wound to the arm, just superficial, the hearing thing.
But things change, and here they all are.
“Excellent.”
You can do it whenever you like.
“It’s okay.”
It isn’t until they are in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital, that Sherlock looks over at John’s hands trembling and clenched into white-knuckled fists, and reaches out.
“The segond drive ub there, on the righd, I think.”
Right.
How does he even know him?”
But it’s kind of—a lot.”
Christ it’s nice, and the pillow stroking, or whatever this
“Mmm.
He longs to be able to see John’s face, to read every tiny nuance of emotion, but at the same time he knows it would probably be too much—for both of them.
Eat your dumplings.
“Exactly.
Not good at all.”
“No Molly!”
And he sinks into the cool, deep, black.
Sherlock assures him, even though he hopes very much he doesn’t.
Sherlock sucks in a sharp breath through his nose, leans down to set his violin on the seat of his chair, and then turns back.
She pulls in again, the minute she catches him looking, and slams the window behind her.
Sherlock pouts.
“I’m sorry, John.”
John shakes his head, rubs his hand down his thigh.
John is utterly exhausted.
What would you like me to do?”
I feel quiet.”
I am.”
“Come home.”
She’s more frank, more open.
Sherlock pulls back a little.
“Sorry.
“Is this…?”
“There was no judgement intended.”
He still owns the Acton flat.
It might be nice to—have company.”
He turns to the headmaster.
“Was it?”
“It’s nice.
Sherlock pants.
So young, finally building the life she’d always wanted, and then the other shoe dropped.
Well, it was too late to un-feel it, I guess.
John loves what they have.
I’m doctor Sawyer.”
Lose yourself in Syria for awhile.
“I’ll just email them to you, then.
John looks up, brows knit.
“You’re officially sick.
He should know better than to expect his ill-timed and impromptu love confession to be met with something equally sentimental and spontaneous.
“I know.
At least half the pounding in his head is probably from that. so he’s been here 24 hours at least.
But not the clean, bright sent of Pear’s shampoo and Palmolive soap, warm wool and fresh brewed tea, no this is the stale, unwashed smell of the sickroom, the unmistakeable reek of alcohol, old newspapers, and unwashed dishes.
“Of course I want it.”
John’s face does the same thing it had done earlier on the road.
Sherlock smiles fondly.
You’re at my flat.
Bit unorthodox isn’t it?
John who is subconsciously rubbing a hand along his thigh, self-soothing the pain, the trauma Sherlock’s words are stirring up.
She didn’t hold and cuddle us.
“Dinner.
"We have wine, don't we?”
John nods against the pillow.
“What?”
He’s going to sleep next to him all night.
“You seem rather tense yourself, Doctor.”
He’s cold, but too lazy to get under the blankets.
“Yes.”
Listen.
Need to know what you need.”
“Sharing a bed with you—half naked.”
Meant it.”
“Sherlock?”
They battle brambles, and thick undergrowth, and John slips once, requiring Sherlock to reach out and grab him by the belt to prevent him from taking what would most assuredly be a very unpleasant tumble.
I mean when we’re…”
Here we go then…
“We were supposed to meet in town.”
“Can’t…”
I’ll be good.”
“Listen, if that, what I just did, was turning you on, it’s fine.
You still haven’t told me what it’s all about, and it must be a ten with the way you’re going on about it.”
Why should he be John’s rock and foundation if someone else will be the one who actually gets to build a life and a future upon it?
It’s not going to take long at all, and he thinks about Sherlock across the city, hard as a rock, touching himself, stroking himself, moaning John’s name.
He’d had this girlfriend in uni who had been into the Kama Sutra, and she’d always been harping on him to try orgasm delay, and deep breathing, and all other manner of odd shit, and he’d been young, and tired, and stressed, and he’d just wanted to get off and be done with it, and he’d probably been a bit of a dick about it all, if he’s honest.
John stills beneath him.
“John?”
“I do like it—for a holiday.
Angelo is his usual enthusiastic self when they arrive at the small, dimly lit Italian restaurant.
He somehow manages.
Always a safe bet for Sherlock.
His brain screams at him, to do the maths, to look at the statistics, to realise that chances are very good that this Moriarty person is somehow behind the whole mess, and that if someone as savvy as Irena Adler is that frightened of him, if Mycroft is telling him to keep out of it, if several people are dead already at the man’s hand, then the chances of John getting out of the whole thing in one piece don’t bear thinking about.
Getting his hopes up, leading him on, making him believe in something just to make money, and not even caring in the least about the effect it might have on his mental health.”
“You need something.
He looks up with a smile.
He’s not really drunk anymore, but he’s still buzzed enough that his defences are down.
John shakes his head, and stares down at his lap, when he looks up again, he holds Sherlock's gaze.
When he turns and looks down at the plate she’s offering him, his mouth waters.
“Why ever not?”
Likely he’s just not minding his phone.
We were at his place, watching telly, no one home, or so we thought.
But you know what I was thinking in that split second before we hit the water?”
John’s stomach flips, like he’s just stepped off a cliff into nothing but air and he’s hanging, suspended, for that microsecond before he starts to plummet.
Well we were just chatting, and then you ran off without telling me much of anything, and then suddenly I was chatting with your brother and you were in hospital, and I didn’t know a thing, now did I.
John smiles a little wider.
His head is spinning, his eyes biting, his cock throbbing.
Okay.
He can hear the quiet chatter of their guests in the room down the hall, but there is no one in sight, and so Sherlock quickly slips next door.
“Mm, little while.”
It’s possible John might not like it, making himself so vulnerable.
“I imagine these things take time.
“Okay. Now go. All of it. I mean it.”
And then she ran.
But none of that mattered now.
How? How could this man sing and yell and destroy and build and narrate the most stunning things John had ever thought to think, without ever saying a word, without ever pausing or stopping or resting or hell, maybe he wasn’t even breathing? All John knew was that this sight was ripping his heart out of his chest and wrapping it in warmth and everything perfectly lovely. He was perfectly lovely. Inhuman was by far the most inaccurate description of Sherlock Holmes he had ever heard.
“What’s Her Face is an idiot.” She pressed her mouth against his and savored the aroma of wine tart on his breath.
It couldn’t continue on that way. He had a fucking job, hopefully, had to heal and recover and keep his life from going tits up yet again. He didn’t have time to be seduced by a medical officer in the sands of Afghanistan. It didn’t support the Work, his plans, or his sexual habits, which prior to this, had been slim to none for a solid four years. Staying clean had been hard. Part of him wanted to blame the drugs and the withdrawals for his lack of self-discipline and control, but he knew that accusation would be three hundred and fifty percent false. No, John Watson could not become a permanent fixture, nor should he be a temporary one. Sherlock had made up his mind when the doctor walked in with a steaming cuppa.
“’ullo?”
John watched as the tears fell against the brittle paper. These were going to wreck him before he ever hit the aisle. Damn that perfect man with his swooning words and indefinite cleverness.
“I play the violin.”
They had turned all the other lights off in the flat, relishing in the light pouring from the fire. It made Sherlock’s eyes a little wider, the hollows of his cheeks a bit more defined, the softness of his lips more desirable than ever. How he would return to a cot, sleeping apart from this divine human, he did not know. He pushed the thought out of his mind. No, not tonight. Tonight was perfect. Warm and kind and gentle.
, smiled at him. Callum sat his bag down in the sitting room, and strolled up to her at the stove. She felt the heat pouring from his body as he bent down to kiss her lovingly where her neck and shoulder met.
He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s bare ones, his t-shirt soaked through with sweat. He clutched the hem of it with one hand, slipped a hand underneath with the other. The warm wetness of Sherlock’s skin was glorious. John felt Sherlock’s hands in his hair, grasping the sides of his face. A soft whimper escaped the pair, from who, John would never know for certain. They were scrabbling, desperately, for purchase in one another: hands fisted in John’s sweater, legs slipping between knees, fingers intertwined in damp, dark hair. John and Sherlock slowly descended into a lazy pace, Sherlock pressed against the height of the stage, arms wrapped comfortably around John’s shoulders.
Oh, she liked Sherlock quite a lot.
Watson climbed on top of Sherlock and straddled him, a moan escaping the detective’s lips at the sudden change in contact. John grabbed the man’s arms and pulled him to a sitting position, causing their hips, and cocks, to line up perfectly. John growled deep in his throat. He buried his hands into Sherlock’s hair, bit that sweet, exposed neck, and began to rut against him. “Goddamnit, Sherlock.
“To you, Sherlock Holmes, for without your friendship, I would surely be lost.”
They burst and the fluid
“Yes, of course. I can always have tea. Thank you.” John plopped heavily onto the sofa and kicked off his trainers. As he was adjusting the pillow behind his neck, he glanced up and saw Sherlock standing next to him, with a mug in his hand. He had no shirt on and the sharp contrast between the deep navy of the dressing gown and the alabaster tint of his skin was distracting. John reached for the cup, breaking his eyes away from Sherlock’s abdomen, and whispered a thank you. Sherlock stood there a few moments more, his hands empty. John searched the icy eyes and concluded the detective looked puzzled, possibly intrigued. Then they went blank, and he turned to retrieve his own mug from the kitchen.
“I had the kettle on, and it began to boil when you arrived. Sorry I didn’t stand and coddle you at the door.” Sherlock’s long arms stretched tall to grab two mugs out of the highest cabinet. “I assumed you’d want tea. You normally drink a great deal of it when you’re nervous. Alcohol was the alternative, but you and I both know I don’t keep a stock of that here.”
“Hm?” John’s mouth was on Sherlock’s neck. He was a bit preoccupied.
go out any more. You need a drink or seven. Lighten up, Holmes. I’ll see you then.” With a turn of her hips, she was walking up the aisle and out the double doors.
"I can't help you unless you explain, John."
(See the end of the chapter for
“’’oly shit, Troy! That’s John Watson!”
“Of course I have milk, Mrs. Hudson. Though I’m not sure how it got there…” He winked at John.
. And then Sherlock watched as John began to mouth the words of the movie, obviously far past knowing it by heart. Sherlock let his eyes shift to the screen, the Enterprise coming into spacedock, and back to John, who was now shedding tears. Silently, at least, but crying nonetheless. Sherlock floundered, completely unsure of what to do.
He felt a hand on his arm. “How are those feeling?”
He dropped one of her hands and caressed her cheek, his vision blurred.
“Go on, then. I know you’re eager, and I’ve been dying to see you.”

“Who is it, Cap?” B asked gently, quietly. John found his eyes and thanked him without a word.
Sherlock swatted at him and then pointed to the telly with his remote.
John leaned forward to Sherlock’s mouth and bit and nipped and licked and moaned into the beautiful cavern that shared Sherlock’s brilliance with the rest of the world. Watson couldn't believe he was the only one his genius deemed worthy of kissing it. John yanked open the drawer to the side table. It only took the click of the cap and Sherlock was propped up on his elbows, watching, recording John as he rubbed the lube between his fingers, warming it before coming into contact with Sherlock’s skin. He knelt again, between those long legs, and ran his tongue against that gorgeous prick as he gently slipped in a solitary finger. Sherlock groaned at the sensation, equal parts discomfort and arousal. John's hand and mouth moved in unison and Sherlock’s breathing pattern spiked. A second finger, and then a third, Sherlock’s cock was hitting the back of John’s throat and Sherlock was quivering and moaning and crying out. John was painfully hard and leaking.
“John?”
Jane snagged the ruler from the middle table and handed it to Kirsten. John watched her as she walked around the room, speaking to each student as she went, tapping a few on their shoulders and working to redirect them to the task at hand.
Sherlock pivoted on his heels to look at John, still in his pyjamas. His hair was ruffled and sticking up a bit in the back, and a sweet glow emanated from his skin.
Sherlock dipped his feet into the cold river water as the sun shone down on his back. He knew this would be the last day he would be able to savor in the upcoming weeks. He hummed and the muscles of his legs flinched as the icy water dipped over his toes. Autumn was here, and soon the water would be much too cool to touch.
“Yes, grumpy. Dinner is ready,” Molly teased. She and Jane set the table as John dished up.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, I had planned to take a break at your arrival. I know you need my assistance, so I will give you my full focus.”
Jane grinned ear to ear. John immediately dropped his hand, fiddling with the hem of his jumper instead. A deep blush spread across his cheeks. Jane raised an eyebrow.
(of lines) tend to meet at a point.
“I’m sorry. For, you know. All this.”
“Thank you. For sharing it.” John nodded, not knowing what else to say. “And you’re wrong, by the way. It’s lovely.”
“Thought you could use some proper tea. I can imagine it’s been a while since you’ve had some. I took a stab at how you like it, two sugars and a bit of milk, but if that doesn’t suffice, I’ll grab another the next time I’m down.”
Silence sat, waiting for someone to erupt and spit out lava, ash, and fire.
Chachi laughed. “Hell yeah, he is! Best London has to offer. We’re so lucky we have him.”
“John. Jane’s opened the door, and you’re too busy fixing my hair to be polite.”
Jane walked to the door and grinned at John standing outside. She opened it wide.
John stirred, rolling over onto his back. He wiped the sleep from his eyes with the heels of his hands and searched.
“Sherlock! What are you doing here? You know I’m not supposed to see you before—“
“Yessir. Who’s this?” The question wasn’t ugly or assaulting; they were genuinely interested. John extended one hand, and as the larger of the two men grabbed it, the other grinned ear to ear.
“Have you met before?” Jane asked, cheekily, John noted. She knew the answer to that.
His brother was seeing someone. Sherlock wasn’t an idiot; he was a Holmes. And the Holmes knew, saw, observed all. He had noticed the sassy saunter of Mycroft’s walk, the way he caressed the handle of his umbrella when he was standing in place, the small, disgusting glint that surfaced in his eyes when he wasn’t focused or talking about The Work. Pathetic. Sherlock knew it was the Detective Inspector. Lestrade. Graham? Gavin? G-something. What did it matter? Mycroft would destroy him soon enough. He always did.
John grinned. “Be careful what you wish for.”
Hello, my loves!
“You talk about me to your landlady?”
John rose, sliding his arms under Sherlock’s thighs. He kissed him firmly as he stood from the bed, hands tightly gripping that perfect backside guilty of parching him entirely the first time he’d ever laid eyes on it. As he rotated, he licked the sweet cords of Sherlock’s throat. “Just to be perfectly clear, I’m no longer asking permission.” He kissed Sherlock again, tongue sliding against his, the taste of wine still lingering in the deeper parts of his flawless mouth. His voice dropped to a gentle whisper as he buried his nose into Sherlock’s hair. “I think you enjoy it better when I don’t.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but didn’t break eye contact from the screen. “Hmmm?”
John glanced up from the pages of his book to see Sherlock typing on his laptop. His tea was propped precariously on a stack of books, steam rising and disappearing. Sherlock’s left leg was tucked up near his chest, the heel of his right foot pushed up off the floor and against the leg of the chair. He was hunched slightly, working intently. John bit his lip to keep from chuckling. He loved stealing tiny bits of Sherlock and storing them away. He knew these would be the thoughts that would get him through the final stretch of hell. Sherlock came to a halt and turned to face John, one eyebrow disappearing into his curls.
(See the end of the chapter for
he smiled at the smell of coffee leaking into the open door of his bedroom.
“Yes.”
“When did it start?”
John read out the cards one by one,
“What about?”
Sherlock leaned forward yet again, and gave John a soft kiss. “Gave” was the perfect word, a small present:
“Shut up. I saw you on that stage, Sherlock. No one can do what you have done and be incapable of feeling. We can debate all evening. You are beautiful and you must feel beautiful and terrifying things, and everything you do is a direct testament to that.”
“Nearly four.”
“Ready, Cap?” Egan and Rhys stood patiently awaiting their captain’s orders.
Holmes turned on his heels to face his friend. He was beautiful on a stage; his height and dark features were a lovely contrast to the openness of the auditorium that surrounded him. His chin rested in the navy holster that joined with his violin. There was something so calming, so submissive about this stance for Sherlock. The expanse of his neck was left vulnerable and unprotected. It was so different from his normal body language. His eyebrows were bowed in curiosity.
John traded in his Bonneville for a Scrambler (motorbike).
“Well…” John dissolved into a million tiny pieces as he studied Sherlock’s eyes, flickering back and forth between his own. His lids were heavy, and Watson couldn’t make out if it was due to sleep or lust. Either way, it made him feel… odd. His eyes dropped to the tip of Sherlock’s nose, sweetly rounded, dipping down to meet the curve between his cupid’s bow. That mouth. God, that mouth. Pinker with the rush of blood waking in the morning, full and pouting and slightly parted. John squeezed his eyes shut, trying to filter through the physical and pinpoint the emotional. What
John’s eyes widened at the use of his name. B rarely ever used a casual greeting when it came to his captain.
Molly and Callum had exchanged a quiet, wordless conversation, one they had so generously excluded Sherlock from, and told him to come here. His stomach twisted in discomfort. Sherlock had no idea what to expect. He dropped his hand, did a small turn on the top step and growled in frustration. Both his hands grappled with his messy head of hair. He reached for the door instead, checking to see if he could open it without unlocking it, because somehow, in his mind, that seemed less invasive.
“Obsessions of this kind are rarely logical.”
“Sleep and food are not an indulgence, nor are they unnecessary, as you daily prove.
“Oh, how nice.
“Huh?”
“Could kiss me again.”
I—I wanted you from the start, you see.”
“It’s been a very trying morning.
There was a long time I couldn’t.
John holds out his hand.
Sherlock nods.
“You’ve had girlfriends, have you not?”
He folds his hands in his lap, and prays Sherlock’s voice close to his ear doesn’t have its usual affect.
Mycroft had caught him touching himself once, when he was barely fifteen, and rushed to tell their mother, who had proceeded to very seriously lecture him on how he was too intelligent for such base things, that it was a common, draining habit he would do best to avoid if he wanted to do well in school and develop his intellect.
John stands up, gives the man a clipped nod of his head, and walks out before he does something stupid.
John laughs softly.
Now out you come.”
You think people are going to want to come all the way out here for cases.
But he doesn’t fall.
“Yes.
Nice to see you anyway.
Sit up for me.”
I’ll hold my breath.”
He must have stolen a little of it then.
John shrugs.
“That wasn’t my place.”
John jumps at Sherlock’s breath on his ear.
What?
Okay.
I’ve told you before—conductor of light.”
Surely…
John’s fingers stir against his abdomen, his thumb tracing over Sherlock’s navel.
“Any in there for me?”
“All of what?”
He puts on his best look of contrition.
“Before, over supper, I was just--I was trying to make a joke.
Hunting down Hope.
He stayed.
“So, it seems.”
His hearing has improved.
“That it helps you think, yeah.
“William would have had more sense, and more aesthetic instinct.
“It’s not an experiment.
Let us both at least try!”
Sherlock wonders if he were to shave off the beard, would John’s cheeks be hollow and gaunt, too.
He nuzzles his nose against John’s scalp, and pushes his thigh between John’s legs, and pulls him close.
“Still contagious, possibly.”
Don’t you dare sto…”
here?”
“What?”
“I guess when I was in school, or with my friends, when we were doing sport, or rough housing and messing about.”
Don’t bother.”
You two will get it sorted.”
“Jesus, Sherlock!”
John turns back to the kettle, shuts it off, pours hot water over their tea.
The same plate he’s been unnecessarily scrubbing since Sherlock entered the kitchen.
John feels untethered.
Sherlock jerks awake, floundering in the sheets, flailing as though warding off blows.
And sometimes John thinks he hears Sherlock, too.
“Mm?”
Sherlock’s eyes flicker away down to his lap.
“Or at least, he will have bought it when the bloody estate agent gets here.”
With a jolt John realises he might as well be talking about sex.
I just—didn’t know how to go about asking.”
It’s been nearly a year since they came back together, since Sherlock invited him home and they started feeling out a life together again.
She nods and takes another sip of tea.
“Give it a little pull for me?”
“‘Cause I’m asking you to.”
Sherlock doesn’t ask.
Hadn’t even seen your face yet, and I was hard as a rock.”
We should—go down and see if we can determine cause of death.”
John huffs again and sighs.
He’s in the kitchen working on something, but he keeps peeking his head in every few minutes to wordlessly check on John’s wellbeing.
Just hums.  “Yeah?  Cause I’ve been thinking about it, thinking about what you tasted like when you came, thinking about how I want to feel you come again, come all over me.”
“It would not be without—fondness, if that is your concern.
“And I made you be my best man.”
They think some sort of drug overdose, maybe.
“And the other person?”
Yeah.
“I’ll let you in on all the secrets, and I’ll stick close during the party, and if you want to invent some case in the middle to duck out, I’m not going to stop you.

John stepped out of the hospital room and began to pace the hall. Sherlock had vanished, his sister had well past a lethal dose of heroin coursing through her body, and it was 5:15 in the morning. “This is fucking absurd,” John muttered. “Why am I always the one? Always fucking taking care of someone else. No one ever fucking takes care of me.” Tears stung his eyes. He hastily ran a hand through his damp hair, shoving his other hand deeper inside his pocket.
So Sherlock stood there with John in his arms. Willing himself very still, he focused all his attention on the curve of shoulder and arm behind the young poplar. The clothes were dark; what was not indistinguishable was undistinguished. This was, almost certainly, the person responsible for the trees and the straw dog. They had come closer and closer and now, for some reason, they were within reach, and Sherlock’s brain trembled with excitement and teemed with theories.
Heaping dirt around potato stems helps increase the number of potatoes you get per plant.
Sherlock watched the still figure. Exemplary control, he thought, and took one step towards her.
“That our mysterious prankster has a tame bear?”
He could write, he supposed. His commanding officer had suggested it when he'd left the force, but John felt stifled by the cyclical mundanity of his life. What was there to write about? Since coming to Canada, he ploughed and planted in the spring, cleared in the summer, harvested in the fall, and cut wood in the winter--when it wasn't blizzarding, that is--and when it was, he sat inside. He knew his journals, such as they were, were useful for future reference, but sometimes he missed practicing medicine, for both the challenge and the money.
“Pelvic massage isn’t a treatment. It’s… a sexual act. It’s something lovers do. I don’t…I can’t, with you. It would be wrong-unethical.”
John’s feet were the first part of his body to make contact. Sherlock’s calves were icy; he twined his feet around them. Then, the midsection; John recited his Hippocratic oath as he made contact with that glorious arse. He threw his arm around Sherlock’s torso and, turning his head, pressed his cheek against Sherlock’s nape. Lord, but the man was inhumanly cold; it was as though he was carved out of marble. John chafed his shoulders and torso, willing him to respond.
Finally, one rainy day, John took pity on him.
Dark had begun to fall before John was ready to go back to the cabin, but he could not in fairness keep the oxen out any longer, and Sherlock would be looking for him, no doubt. He trudged home, exhausted in body and in mind, but still unable to shake the heavy desire that had settled in him.
Sherlock nodded, tossing the last handful of grain to the fowl.
"Do you like it?" It was unclear what Sherlock meant by "it", but John gave up when faced with his determination.
“And geese. Kind of you to spare me the moose jokes. Now, do you suppose you could help me inside? Again?”
“I see.”
“You don’t want me to.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” he said. Sherlock lay like a lump under the blankets, unmoving and uncaring, and John quickened his movements, filling the kettle and piling larger logs around the snapping branches in the hearth. When that was done, he stripped off his own coat and held his hands before the fire.
“Won’t you take a walk, Uncle Gregory? The spruce grove is very fine.”
He scrubbed his face with his hands and stared blankly, head pounding. He was half a world away, but even with the whiskey, dreams haunted him and made the long winter nights a thing to be feared.
“We’re not chasing individual squirrels all over the county, are we?”
You really should leave most animals alone. Geese can be really social and friendly but they aren’t dummies. Lesson: never put a goose in a sack, and definitely don’t climb on old shanty roofs. Any farm kid can corroborate the first, and I can personally corroborate the second (see also: old chicken houses, old barns, old woodhouses, old outhouses…look, we only had two t.v. channels and lived at the end of a 3km dirt road, okay? And I like to climb.)
“The backwoods makes strange bedfellows sometimes,” Greg said. Was he looking at Lyons? John felt bad, suddenly.
“John!” Angelo exclaimed, his roar filling the shop, “Your friend, he is simpatico!”
"Please," Sherlock begged. John didn't tease him this time, just put his hand on Sherlock's cock, stroking gently over ballocks and shaft. He marvelled at the silky texture, the incredible hardness, the absolute responsiveness; Sherlock's ballocks were already drawn up tight. He gripped the shaft and stroked; Sherlock's thighs quivered. "So good, John," he whispered.
By the time they reached the Sudbury Interprovincial PeeWee hockey tournament, three days later, John was sure he would never drink another cup of coffee again. He was starting to sweat a little just looking at the cup, and his shoulder was aching from being jammed into the back seat of the truck to be jerked off or sucked for a frustratingly brief time. His only solace was that Sherlock was starting to look a little frayed around the edges as well; his curls were in disarray, and, this morning at least, his coat was buttoned incorrectly. John had no intention of informing him of this fact .
"Get off me," he growled, but Sherlock, after a brief pause to regain his breath, was already leveraging himself off. His arse lifted off John's thighs, none too soon, and he stood and extended a hand.
“It doesn’t really matter if they don’t bite,” John said, and laughed at Sherlock’s nonplussed expression.
“Because I care for you, you absolute arsehole!”
"Could you have hurt her by accident? Could it have been a simple insult, a simple oversight?"
“Yes!” Sherlock exclaimed. “Quite. In fact, I did this morning, the same time as you, which proves—not that I need to answer your invasive questions—that everything works perfectly well.”
"Very well." John rose, then as he was about to step outside to relieve himself, was reminded that perhaps Sherlock would need to do the same. "There are no indoor conveniences here. The outhouse is twenty feet southeast of the door."
“They’re truly bonded,” Sherlock said, and if his face had not been streaked with numerous excrements too horrible to catalogue, John would have said he looked almost delighted.
“I’ve thought of some rules,” he said, “Just to make it fair?”
“Well?” Sherlock impatient was worse than Sherlock passive; it woke the beast in John’s gut, the beast that demanded submission, that fed on it. The beast that was decidedly non-medical.
Sherlock shook his head. "Absolutely not. She's smart enough, and we have to assume she has the knowledge..."
Predictably, Sherlock was elbow-deep in guts. He'd flipped the liver off to one side and was carefully opening the stomach.
"I will."
“And yet I fear, John, that you have lost your wager.”
Doctornerdington slaved over this chapter and really helped make it better. <3 Marigolds, ellioop, turifer, and girlwhowearsglasses provided a lot of squee and I am grateful. I have been DYING to share this chapter with you.
“That tea in your canister is vile,” Sherlock said, “but I didn’t add anything to it, so I suppose you should thank me.”
"It doesn't," John agreed. "We probably shouldn't let our guard down."
"Fine," Sherlock said, and set down his instruments.
“Ah, don’t worry about it. He meant well. I told him to fuck off and he did. Found a loaf of bread and some onions the next day, so he was properly sorry.”
John’s second snort of disbelief was louder than the first, but he left the cabin without further comment.
“She likes you,” he said to Sherlock.
“That’s how it is.”
"I know. But you're going to get water, so that makes it even."
“Ahh,” Sherlock sighed, licking his long fingers. “Nanny always told me I would come to no good if I did this.”
“Do you really think someone would have followed you from India?” Sherlock peered into his face with intensity; John could not believe he’d found that attractive.
Harry watched him, her yellow-green eyes narrowed. Her hindquarters bunched slightly. Sherlock leaped one more row of potatoes, theorizing that if he could see her hindquarters equally, he would be able to determine which way she would jump. He had not, quite, calculated that his jump would cause her to change direction. He was thus unprepared for the frankly unscientific leap Harry made, jumping over Clara and free of the potato patch. She landed at top speed and disappeared into the woods.
“And will that work?”
"Farming requires a great deal of brainpower. Now, will you help? The horses need watering.” John held Arthur’s lead rope out to Sherlock, but Sherlock did not take it. In fact, neither Arthur nor Sherlock appeared to wish to be any closer together than they already were; Arthur's ears were straight back and Sherlock was wearing an expression of studied nonchalance. John grinned to himself, contrasting Sherlock's fluid physical grace when on foot with his sack-of-potatoes demeanour on horseback.
"Correct," Sherlock said, and pressed his body to John's. John shivered at the feeling Sherlock's spunk against his cock and ballocks. His desire was returning, fiercer than ever. He thrust into the slickness.
"Aren't you going to wash?" he said, straightening up.
“Harry?”
“You don’t have to drink it. But if you want to, you can.”
“John!” he shouted. John stirred under the blankets. “John!”
“Lost.”
“For a scientist you’re the most literal man I’ve ever known.”
His desire grew heavier at the thought. John clenched his fist, and closed his eyes. How was he such a fool?
“Did they say it’d been eating meat, by any chance? A lot of meat?” Bears did eat meat—they were omnivores, like humans—but it was rare that it formed the majority of their diet. It would be unlikely that there would be more than one in the immediate area.
“Sherlock!” John rushed to him and felt his hands, and his face. Had Sherlock been able to move, he would have taken John’s hands and held them; they were the warmest things he had touched in hours.
It hadn’t snowed that day, thank fuck, John thought, as he pushed open his front door that evening. He did, however, feel a little apprehensive about the challenge. Sherlock had appealed to his competitive instincts, but he still wasn’t looking forward to blue balls for the better part of three weeks.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, faintly, his cheeks still flaming.
"Why does your reaction bother you so much?" Sherlock pulled back. "I like it." He gripped John's erection.
Sherlock slowed Idiot Horse to a trot, then a walk, and finally slipped off her altogether, examining every inch of the verge. He could sense John’s impatience, and his own was barely restrained. However, he was determined to do the thing rightly, and so he contained himself.
"Lovely. Come on, then," John said, pulling on his socks, and boots.
Sherlock just grinned. “You can have cold beer inside.” he said.
. It was a woman, he was sure of it. The stance tickled at Sherlock’s brain. He had seen it before, seen that set of shoulders. But where? It couldn’t have been with a bear; he would have remembered.
“We should go before whatever spooked the horse comes back.”
"Mary--she was good, or so I thought."
Stamford arrived just before noon, driving his wagon into the yard to friendly shouts from everyone.
“I can do whatever you can do.”
"Guglielmo" decides he's going to blend so entirely into his surroundings that he'll eventually be able to disappear. (Give Guglielmo a break, he's 18 and hitting a late-puberty angst high.) He sets out to work. He keeps his mouth shut, for the most part.
John shrugged his shoulders.
so much. Were John to lay hands on his body, he felt as though he would meet his crisis immediately; were he to put his own hands on his body, it would be much the same, he feared. And yet he could not. He would not cause John any further pain for this. He rolled to his back, gasping as his cock dragged against the blankets, then lay still.
“Not surgical, I imagine.” Sherlock was equally unflinching.
“Like this?” Sherlock asked, folding part of the cover on the back of the settle and the rest on the bench.
"He's decided that he's shipping his younger brother to me as a sort of glorified exploration expedition--and he got hold of all my credit notes to oblige me to board him."
John stared at him.
“Mycroft is an excuse. You are afraid, nothing more.”
Soon, Sherlock’s world had shrunk to watching John’s feet and imitating his steps, one after the other. He was cold, colder than he thought possible. His ankle had begun to ache, but he squared his shoulders and modulated his breathing. John must not know that he was cold and sore. He would take five more steps. At the end of those five, he would take five more. The rain might not end, but their march would. Five more steps.
Sherlock sat. They were so close, now.
“If I drink one more cup of coffee, Sherlock, I will float away.”
The use of the term “Indian” is only because of the time; I wouldn’t use it today.
Had he ever thought that Sherlock’s mind was an amazing phenomenon, his attention superlative? Watching it deployed on something else was one thing, but that was nothing to having the whole brilliance of the man and his mind focused on oneself. John felt simultaneously miniscule and larger than life. He opened his mouth to answer and shut it again.
"The loft or settle, your choice."
One of the most unrealistic things about this story thus far has been that the goats haven’t escaped. Goats are possibly the hardest things to fence in ever because they are smart and can jump very high. They laugh at barbed wire. They thumb their noses at gates. The first pair we had on the farm once worked together to get out of a six-foot-high board fence reinforced with chicken wire. So in the interests of truthfulness, out the goats had to go.
Sherlock considered Soo-Lin’s reaction to the sight of him. It was not hostile, as Sally’s had been, but fearful. She had no reason, as far as he knew, to fear him, but perhaps she feared men in general. He would watch, at dinnertime.
What he knew unequivocally, however, was that they were all free, here, free to live as they chose.  He, too, would be free if he stayed.
“I thought you’d like it.” Sherlock’s face was smug again.
“She’s sociable,” Sherlock said, “She likes people.”
(Why did Mycroft always do that? It fooled no one.)
Then, in a moment John would remember all his life, a figure shot past him and headed straight for the bear.
“You won’t manipulate me into hurting you.”
After several days, Sherlock became oddly quiet. He ceased tormenting John and devoted himself to the garden and to the goats. In fact, it seemed as though every time John looked at him, he was standing by the goats, watching them nuzzle each other, or talking to them. It gave John a slight sense of unease, but he supposed it was better than Sherlock brooding about romance.
"I suppose your bedding is unspeakable either way?"
“And I’m disloyal.”
Mike snorted.
John had to laugh. “Yes,” he replied, “Let’s.”
“Is he helping us today or is he helping with dinner?” Lestrade asked.
He drew another breath, glancing sidelong at Sherlock. Thankfully, he was glued to Mike’s words.
"John!" Angelo shouted the moment he came in. "You are not dead! Come and have some stew, my friend, and I have a whiskey you will adore!"
John tastes every inch of Guglielmo's skin. Holds him down. Makes him take everything.
Thankfully, the act was brief. After an interminable quarter of an hour, Frank withdrew without ceremony, John, face motionless, led Clara away to the far side of the house and tied her there.
Sherlock was shocked. He watched in silence as Harry pushed her hind end under Frank’s nose. Frank was a little less eager than he had been with Clara, but his piston still rose to the charge, and in moments it was over.
You can come.”
She smiles, and Sherlock smiles back.
The water rises.
Sherlock aches.
Ella urges.
“Ahh.”
“Wait, so—what?
He brews it strong.
Sherlock and John take a seat.
“Request?”
It’s unexpected, this vulnerability.
You run around with that queer detective that’s all over the telly again these days, don’t you?
There’s nothing to see.
I came back because I wanted to come back.
Doctor’s orders, and…”
“Mm, waking alone must be…”
He hops a little, favouring his bad leg when he gets to his feet.
That was fun.”
They’re not even yours.”
“Ahh, here’s Little Brother.”
The worst of it was the drive from Eastbourne to here.
Sherlock squeezes his hand.
Sherlock dips down to kiss him again, slow, deep, and when he finally pulls back his eyes are shining.
John rolls his head to the side.
Always, okay.”
“Well, me too.”
A muscle in John’s jaw twitches.
But he’s trembling.
I haven’t even seen it myself.
It makes a gentle, satisfying scratch.
Ask you daft man.”
“There you go.
It’s slightly awkward, this—John curled under the blankets at his side, hair mussed, blankets tucked under his nose, and Sherlock hovering over him, coffee cup perched precariously on one palm.
“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking.
John scrolls back through the photos while he waits for a reply.
Better to purge it, Sherlock thinks, to let it all out.
Sherlock nods against his neck.
John sniffs.
That’s a good man.”
Nothing.
“Good.
“And you are?”
He’s—he’s…
Can you imagine?
Jesus!
I just like to look.
It’s not that he doesn’t want this.
He’ll be lucky to get the car out of the driveway.
“Whatever you like.”
John crying.
“You.
“Yeah, I—I think so.
It still doesn’t.”
Now it has.
He wanders back down to the bedroom and stands in the doorway, staring down at the
“Don’t think anyone’s told me that before.”
“But you didn’t want it—me?”
“There’s another upstairs if you…”
“Well,” Sherlock smiles, and slides a hand up John’s back and brings it to rest at his nape.
“Would you?”
That was me probably.
“I love you, you know.”
“What?
If he’s shocked at John’s honesty, he doesn’t say.
All he knows is that he doesn’t want John to leave.
I’d been living on borrowed time, and they were about to call in the favour I still owed.”
He has to look away.
Now if you like.”
“Where?”
John feels himself reaching the end, and briefly entertains the idea of slowing down, holding, back, letting Sherlock come first, but then he remembers the way Sherlock chokes, and whines, every time John clenches around him, and he gives up all pretence of waiting.
He texts him and gets no response.
However, if something exceedingly dear to him was used as a lure, it is possible that he would forget common sense.
“Yes, we have.
“And what’s that?”
He lays his hands in John’s outstretched ones.
Sherlock spits out the word
Bandage them up.
Of course, disengaging himself might be a bit…
Sherlock’s lip trembles.
John is leaning against the door jamb.
He hands it back to her and she sits cross-legged on the mattress flipping through the pages.
Yeah.
John’s voice sounds—not right, somehow.
There are only a few other patrons in the pub, all of them eating plates of English breakfast, so John assumes they are probably patrons of the inn upstairs, and haven’t tried to brave the snowy roads like he and Sherlock had been foolish enough to.
“Tea’s boring.”
“It was…”  John stares back up at the ceiling, and then shakes his head after awhile, when he can’t seem to find the words.  He looks back over at Sherlock. “I love you.”
That’s not why I came back.”
Thought I’d try something new, something that would make it last, because I knew you would be equally creative if we were ever to…”
Sherlock smiles softly.
Something lets go inside of him.
I’ll just…”
He grins.
“You.”
Sherlock scowls.
“Of course.”
“This.
Fine.”
Sherlock kisses him, feels John pull in and then let go, and when he kisses back it’s sweet, and slow.  There is no urgency to it, no desperation. It’s confident. It’s content and sure.
“Would you like to lead next time?”
He unclips his seatbelt and lays down on the warm leather, turns his back to his brother, and drifts into a fitful sleep in which he dreams of London—the wet streets, the distant, late night hum of traffic, the thick walls of Baker Street insulating him and John from the dangers of the world outside.
“Tell me you know you’re my best friend.”
Christ knows you’ve done the same for me more times than not.”
Sherlock mouths, as John draws closer.
John doesn’t know what to say, but fortunately, Sherlock takes a deep breath and decides to spare him.
He loved the spontaneity, the way her antics always kept him on his toes, but he’d never quite known how to respond to playfulness.
“List?”
He leans down, rubs a hand over his eyes and then sits back up again, posture military stiff, and turns to stare out the window with a small shake of his head.
Sherlock fights long battles with himself in the wee hours of the morning.
Sherlock says the word like it’s something sour and to be avoided.
He’d imagined it would mean having to look a certain way, perform to a certain standard.
What is it with the bloody country?!”
He’s used to his own phone always being set to vibrate.
“Yes.”
Do what you want.”
“Yes.”
It’s why I sent you away that day.
“But the stuff in the newspapers?”
“You okay?”
And John wants to ask him what he wants, but he wonders if Sherlock even knows.
He had imagined an expanding, thrumming lust between them, like the night in the kitchen, John pushing him against the wall, maybe, pressing his hand between them, maybe.
It’s not sudden, it’s not rough, but it’s firm.
It’s beyond inconvenient.
Yeah.
Sherlock is still whispering like it’s something sacred, and John can’t hear him at all, but he can read his lips—his eyes.
“Why?”
“John.”
“Look at me.
You are remarkable, a man of courage, and loyalty, and conviction.
Bored.
A boy I grew up with.
John is on the floor, sitting with his back pressed against the wall, and his knees tucked up against his chest.
“Oh yeah?”
Not fair.
He couldn’t.
“John.”
Sherlock is happy to let John take over.
“What are you doing?”
“Won’t be back until this evening.”
“Okay.
Does.
I have the tendency to migrate.”
He sounds awed and overcome all at once.
He gets to his feet, and gathers the half-empty containers, and doesn’t ask any more questions.
He takes a deep breath, lets it out slow.
“Is it not?”
“Ok.”
Sure that no one is watching, he turns back to the animal poking it’s nose through the fence at him, and lets it sniff the front of his coat.
He lets his eyes slide shut.
We can walk there.”
There’s another long silence.
When they get back downstairs, John gets him a nasal strip, and gets him tucked in on the sofa with his afghan, and then goes to make tea and hunt down something warm for an early supper.
But John is still John.  Beautiful, fierce and strong—achingly so.  And it seems that Sherlock’s body, once accustomed to his touch, is now missing it.  He has managed alright, of course. He takes care of things, usually in the shower, when the ache becomes intense enough to become distracting.
“You thought I was a danger to him.
Sherlock decides that his forty-sixth birthday is the perfect time to take a case he has no business taking, and to wrap it up by falling into the Thames.
But, still…
He reaches Sherlock in four steps, takes his face in his hands, and kisses him.
“James who?”
“James, let him go!”
I’m saving it up for something special.
Sherlock smiles.
he sits up, and lets Sherlock undress him.
After a moment he looks up, desperate.
Rosie chimes in.
New events can re-trigger them.
“There you are,” John encourages.
Water turns on somewhere, and then off again.
love?”
She’s grinning, and there is the sound of some children’s show echoing into the foyer from the lounge, so it seems all is well.
I need to do laundry, and…”
He likely thought that with his siblings out of the way, their shares would pass to him.
“Oh, John.
He’s just staring.
Doctor’s orders.
He enfolds him.
She tells him how John had come back to the flat like a ghost, and spent an hour vomiting in the loo, before crawling into Sherlock’s bed and sleeping for three days straight.
Sherlock knows he’s in trouble the minute he rounds the corner, oxfords skidding on wet pavement, and comes face-to-face with a large, meaty fist.
He silently curses Sally, while at the same time being grateful that John is being predictable clueless.
“Yes.
And yes, he’s done what he set out to do, he’s eradicated Moriarty’s network, he’s ensured their mutual safety, so why is it that he doesn’t feel safe enough, safe at all.
“Good.
I’m good.
“Order whatever you like.
Sherlock is overwhelmed. Completely and wholly overwhelmed with gratitude at John’s presence, his thoughtfulness, his care.
“Yes.
I just—it gets to me.”
“You really do look off.
“And you’re meant to rest.
He has morning breath, and he’s still uncoordinated with sleep, and Sherlock thinks it’s the best kiss they’ve ever shared.
“Okay.”
Some people are.
Sherlock looks up.
He moans in pain.
John is fairly sure Sherlock isn’t watching.
He breathes against John’s jaw.
John smiles, small and crooked.
He builds it to look like John’s flat, modest and tidy, everything in its place, and anything not fit for human consumption secreted away in hidden drawers and cupboards, just like the desk drawer John’s eyes had constantly drifted to the first day they had met.
Well, anything will do.”
right.
“With certain exceptions, of course.”
“Let him go, or I swear to God.”
“While there, he saw young Lord Saltire climb out of his window, a few yards away, climb down the drain spout, and race off into the night.
“It does, actually!”
“It doesn’t matter, John.
“Exposure therapy.”
Sherlock swallows.
John’s eyes find his again.
John stands up, goes to the kitchen, stares down the hall to the closed door at the end.  His body says
The sex is the best John has ever had. He can’t contain his moans nor his belches as Sherlock fucks him hard, fast, and deep. The detective’s massive belly crashes against his back like waves on a beach, breaking him apart just as much as the cock buried in him. Sherlock’s harsh hot breaths are at his neck, those large hands alternating between rubbing his swollen overfull middle and pumping John’s huge hard cock. John has never felt more complete in his life. He is filled. Stuffed. Surrounded. Utterly his.
John jumped as Sherlock ran past. Then he disappeared with a few bags of takeaway which he hardly paid any mind to. He was too busy trying to hide the crisps.
"Well done," said John, moving closer and rubbing at Sherlock's distended tummy carefully, probing it with his fingers and finding it delightfully springy. "More."
But it was too late.
The detective shakes his head again then manages to speak. "Ok, ok. We we’re kidnapped by Moriarty, made to find one another...and we're in a candy house where we know at least one person has eaten until they’ve exploded." The panic starts to rise again, but I tamp it down.
"Sherlock!" John bellows as the man is wrenched from his grasp, he tries to go after the detective, but is stopped.
John drew his arms around his lover and gave him a squeeze in return, hugging him properly.
"Oi,"  John dashes after the detective as he goes for one of the cakey books.
He rocked his hips, his flab moving in waves, crashing into the human. His mouth found those perfect plush lips. He kissed hard, desperately, moaning at the decadence he tasted on him. The hunger and desire feeding him further.
Sherlock stepped closer, cautiously as if approaching a wild animal. John was certainly eating like one. The man in question paused for a moment, let out a monstrous wet burp and gave his belly a hearty slap before downing the rest of his milk. The detective found himself biting the inside of his cheek. He quickly sat down before John could notice his friend's new interest in the proceedings.
A glance at Sherlock showed him that the other man wasn't fairing much better. Every so often Sherlock's shoulders would hitch or jump as his stomach lurched with another hiccup. Sherlock compensated by gulping down coffee between more bites of the pie. This, naturally, did not help matters. John noticed that Sherlock was saying very little and often brought his fist to his mouth to muffle a burp or belch as the detective's now almost perfectly round stomach gurgled. It was pure torture, both to be unable to touch that perfect plump belly and to keep eating that delicious pie. John had never been more aroused in his life.
Sherlock rolled his hips, cheeks red, "P-Please John, I
He can feel Sherlock chuckling against him, causing his massive soft belly to quake against him. John realizes he has leaked through his pants. And pajama bottoms. He flushes but Sherlock only catches his mouth with his own and ruts into him, practically fucking John with his belly, slowly, rhythmically, brutally.
“You were jealous,” he said simply.
"Hug,” he demands, sniffling, tears still going down his face. Sherlock wraps his arms around the doctor, squeezing him into his soft, fat middle. The crying subsides as they just sit for a moment in silence, the clicking skittering away. Then Sherlock giggles softly in John’s ear.
John lets out a soft gasp, his entire body suddenly quivering in his rush to comply, stuffing more doughnuts into Sherlock’s mouth as quick as he can, peppering the man’s neck, chest, and belly with kisses. He gives a soft whimper as Sherlock arches his back, pushing against his buttons and sends one flying. He dutifully feeds Sherlock more, dipping his head down to kiss, suck, and worship that perfect belly. They are both panting, groaning, and spent in a matter of minutes. John feels Sherlock slip long clean fingers into his short cropped hair and lets out a happy sigh, his own sticky fingers still clinging to Sherlock’s overstuffed middle.
He hadn't drunk a drop of the fine wines, the excellent beers, or the astonishing array of liqueurs from all manner of countries near and far.
Then comes the screaming
John chuckles at that. Okay, it's a bit of a hysterical giggle actually. He finds himself relieved and giddy all at once.  "I-er, Oh, fuck it come here.”
He's finished the cake faster than he thought possible, and suddenly his lips are sucking creamy frosting from John's fingers, moaning as his skeletal, hollow middle swells flat, lines of muscle no longer defined, or even existent, his lower belly smooth and round as the sheet cake the spirit feeds him
Tears run down Sherlock’s face and he curls up into a small ball on the floor, remembering on the tapes what the scary bunnies did to the nice, army man, or what the gummy bears did to Cindy. He feels two of the bunnies pull out and then sit on his legs, another two hold Sherlock’s arms, while one pries open his mouth and sticks its head inside.
Sherlock laughed, gazing back at John as the man smiled.
John tilted his head.
"Well, can't say I mind... would be a shame if I didn't get to talk to a pretty thing like you," he purred.
But he was a gentleman, and attempting to make a good impression and so John Watson did his utter best to swallow any burps that tried to escape him, even as he felt the pressure in his belly building. Then at last, dinner was over and they were to head back to London. John surprised himself by being able to stand afterall. He tugged his shirt down and thanked the Holmeses again and again for a wonderful evening. Then he took Sherlock by the hand and did his best not to waddle as they left. Once the door closed behind them, they walked to the cab they had called. Within two steps of it, Sherlock let out an almighty belch and moaned, almost falling into John, his face burning.
He popped a few painkillers he found in the bedside table, then sat on the side of the bed, stretching upward.
The small part of him whines, but the detective’s will stands firm. One moment of weakness won’t – Sherlock falls to his knees in pain, his stomach feeling as if he has never eaten anything in his life. The tray is replaced with a small table, on top of it perches a plate of cinnamon buns. Sherlock quickly snatches one, shoving it into his mouth without thinking, not even finishing chewing before he stuffs in a second, a third.
"Not wise to threaten a police officer, Watson."
After a short while of stuffing himself silly, barely able to focus on the plan, that happy music echoing louder and louder in Sherlock’s brain, it happens.
Sherlock gasped and moaned as John prepared him, having to bury his face into a pillow as John hefted his massive belly onto him.
"You...you came. This...it doesn't make sense, you came and-" Sherlock looked under the tree, brain nearly imploding as it counter the number of gifts there.
"I've given you precisely twenty so far," came Sherlock's stroppy grumble through the bathroom door.
Then he froze, frowning, crossing his arms.
"I...fuck. Yes. I've almost got it." Sherlock grunted, his Food O Magic popping out a tower of steak kebabs
"I-I...I haven't been with a man since university. And I admit I was less...cushioned then." Sherlock flushed, grabbing his fat tummy, giving it a soft jiggle, the buttons of his waistcoat creaking at the movement.
“Yeah,” huffed Sherlock, eyes falling closed as he pressed himself into John with soft moans. He tugged at John in return until they were both panting and gasping. Their fattened bodies shook and trembled then fell still as they came on their two bulging bellies which were still pressed together sweetly. They succumbed to sleep soon after, still holding one another, dreaming of future feasts to come. They had certainly developed a taste for this sort of thing.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide, and he dug in with gusto, his belly slowing rounding further and further outward, his pants button creaking.
John’s heart stops. That was definitely Sherlock, not the know-it-all detective, but some small frightened little thing that had been coaxed out from inside the man.
At last, Sherlock had to breathe again, he gasped as he lowered the bottle, several burps bubbling up his throat to escape. His belly rounded out further, gurgling as the soda made contact with the ice cream, fizzing up and making Sherlock feel well and heavily bloated. He burped again, panting slightly, as he slumped back against the sofa, his hand rubbing at his belly.
Oh shit... this was good. Hot. Perfect.
He looked over Greg's nude from, his belly spilling forward, hanging slightly onto his chubby cock, love handles pouring out his side. Jesus, did he want to feel that pressure on his he sucked that man's thick member
John follows Sherlock into the next room and slams the door shut, before looking around. A spa wasn't usually where one found bullets, but then this made place didn't seem to run by the rules of  usual rooms.
He whined as John jiggled, trying to focus on the case.
"God, yes! Why didn’t I try them earlier?!" He murmured, taking another massive bite
"Lestrade, case!" He shouted, marching over to the man's desk and dropping the box
“M’ sorry,” Sherlock mumbled, almost too softly for Molly to hear.
Sherlock grinned, giddy with affection
in a back alley like the naughty little pig you are.”
"Oh Jesus I need to fuck you," He breathed, his fingers grabbing soft jiggling flesh harshly. Greg hummed in agreement, shifting himself closer with several puffs and grunts. He kissed Sherlock heatedly.
John smiled as he ate his way through the slice. He huffed softly as Sherlock's hand found his middle.
Sherlock shivered.
He reached out to take it. It looked so innocent.
Sherlock swallowed heavily after turning back toward the table.
He licked his fingers clean, rubbing his overfilled middle as he looked at the clock. He had time for a quick nap, surely. He wiped a bit of the chocolate from his face, leaning back into the sofa, his domed middle pouring into his lap, and felt his eyelids grow heavy, drifting off to his sugary coma.
the story you’re supposed to be in!?" He slams his fists down on the table angrily, but pauses for just a moment as two startlingly blue eyes blink open from the wall, staring at him. They close a moment later. He swallows.
There’s a groan and the sound something being crammed into a mouth, a muffled, wet sort of choking
Sherlock chuckled softly as the joke, leaning his head onto the man's shoulder. It felt so...packed. The man must’ve been working out twice as hard lately. His brows knit together at that, reaching for another slice and chewing.
"Oi. You calling me fat?" John growled, puffing up his belly again and bumping it forcefully into Sherlock.
Sherlock uses his new gut to press John into the doorway lightly, his soft belly enveloping John further.
“Yours,” he belches, breathing shallowly before snatching the pitcher from Sherlock’s fingers and tipping it back greedily for every last drop. “All yours. Your huurp fat hog!”
Moran smirked. "Well, that's the Yard and Sherlock Holmes out of the way." he said, passing Jim the doughnut hed nabbed earlier. "Congratulations."
Sherlock smirks, looking like he could devour the shorter man as easily as a dragon.
John had warned Sherlock that he was an unusual drunk. Upon setting out with Lestrade for the evening for some sort of social event Sherlock hadn't bothered to remember what was, his flatmate had advised him to avoid him upon his return. Sherlock had been dubious, if a bit curious. Was John violent? Or was the man apt to babble and giggle until he vomited? It turned out that the answer was neither. John never failed to surprise him.
John groaned and turned his head to kiss his fattened lover. "Christ, you're getting heavy, Sherlock. But no, we should be precise." He grinned and kissed him again. "It's our experiment."
"Oh god, J-John, Greg, I-Im a...a
"Whacha lookin' at? Hm?" John asked, taking a huge bite of the mince pie he was holding. Mrs. Hudson had brought them up yesterday. Now it appeared that John had eaten- no, demolished the whole half dozen.
"I love you too, so much... so much Sherlock." he panted. He panted and grunted, hugging Sherlock to him with one arm as he pounded into him.
“Yes, God yes!” John moans, rutting up against Sherlock’s thigh, “Want you. So full and fat- ungh!”
Sherlock smiled and stuffed down another large mouthful of the green bean casserole. He passed John another beer, eyes trailing down the man's body fondly, noting that the gorgeous roundness was returning to the doctor's middle. John grunted as he shifted forward to take it, then loaded a third plate to the edges before eating with just as much gusto.
Sherlock's eyes flicked over his flatmate, dangerously close to forgetting to breathe again as he took in just how
He just needed to regain control...and maybe a few biscuits...or a dozen pounds of fried rice. Sherlock shook his head, blushing lightly and hurrying to the kitchen.
Sherlock smiled at the man as he entered the room, seeing John all cuddled up instead of exerting himself on another terrible run.
God in Heaven, does he want to shoot them. John chuckles at the thought. Oh, this is
"Oh Christ, I thought I was going to explode," John chuckled, groaning as his belly jostled with the motions of his laughter.
John chuckled kindly and moved over to rub gently at his lover's hugely distended form. The curve of pale belly was now jutting up proudly under the man's ribs, the mass jostling slightly as Sherlock hiccuped or burped, the whole lot sloshing around.
Alright then - facts.
Sherlock’s heart almost rocketed out of his chest as John's hand rubbed at his flat middle, hiding beneath the blanket as blood surged southward, imaging his fit John waddling home from work, huffing and puffing as his coat strained around his fatty form, kissing Sherlock deeply and sinking into the couch, his wide arse spreading out across its entirety as he begged Sherlock to fetch him dinner.
Sherlock squealed again, moaning as John grabbed at his massive gut, pressing his thick, hard cock against the detective's pillowy, sensitive ass
"Or John before he left for work? People in relationships do tend to give each other gifts." He chuckled, then wet his lips.
John chuckled and reached behind him to pat him softly.
The door shuts between the two of them and locks with a loud click. The childish music blasts again, loudly, and Sherlock feels his brain go fuzzy.
He found John's glowing blue eyes
Sherlock huffed. "Yes, I am
The first few rooms Sherlock was in held no danger, only sweets and a desire for fun.
John waddles to the door, clad in nothing but a jumper that keeps creeping up over his deep wide navel and exposing a huge shelf of belly, complete with a nest ofcurly golden hair, and a pair of severely abused red briefs, his arse cheeks spilling over the top of the waistband. Fortunately, their guests are expected.
Sherlock noted a sudden altered change in John's posture. Perhaps he was finally going to get some data. He gathered himself up to focus, but all he saw was two rather large young men, one with just the beginnings of a pot belly pushing out against his t-shirt, jiggling slightly with his footfalls, the other man was... quite a lot larger. Sherlock looked to John in confusion but the doctor was too busy staring. Oh. He'd miscalculated. Or perhaps John was too drunk to mind his eyes, they were certainly attractive, if unfit. John seemed to suddenly realize he was staring and snapped his attention back to Sherlock.
"Eat a bed, piggy. Go on."
"Hm," said John, chuckling even as he immediately missed the weight of Sherlock on his shoulder. Maybe it was for the best. Easier to hide his weight like this. "Some might call that madness, but no, you've got it too. Something about us is just... right. I guess."
The spa is...well it looks like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, there's two small jets of warm, molten chocolate spilling into a full, Olympic sized swimming pool of gooey, fudgy goodness
Sherlock grinned.
"How could one possibly find a comfortable way to question a romantic interest about taboo kinks or fetishes?"
John is going to have the great Sherlock Holmes as his own personal prize pig, oozing out of his suits, sharp features buried in fat, cold eyes gone warm and demure with thousands of calories and laziness. He digs his fingers into Sherlock’s middle, rubbing it eagerly until Sherlock lets out a long wet belch.
"And four times?" John repeated, eyeing the tape mistrustfully. He bit his lip. The whole thing... "Okay. We can make notes and investigate. Stuff." He wandered to the kitchen and put the kettle on.
Sherlock moaned and groaned. He felt squashed, crushed. John was massive. Everywhere. Flowing around him like the waves of the sea. He threw back his head, exposing more and more of his pristine, soft, pulsing neck, veins bulging as blood rushes southward
"Oh, that precious little prince," he says wickedly. "I apologize, this still might be fun."
The man groans and dips his head down to nuzzle at John’s neck. John simply allows his head to loll, mind blissfully at peace, body utterly boneless.
And started to drink.
"Hm, yeah alright," agreed John, yawning and muffling a burp as he stretched, he let his hands settle on his belly without realizing it, rubbing softly. He felt wonderfully full, even more so because of his new soft belly being pressed flat by tight clothing. He might have to go up a size soon. God...
"And you're not the only one," he added, smirking. He reached behind himself for the zip and undid it, his torso swelling visibly as the tight fabric was given slack.
The curly-haired man brought it to the living room table, setting it down reverently and beginning to undo his corset.
He cheekily stole his own bite of ice cream and winked at Sherlock, then pressed a cool kiss to the detective's belly, teasing him with his tongue.
“Greg! Good to see you. And Mycroft, come on in. Sherlock’s just wrapping things up in the kitchen,” John says, swallowing slightly as he takes them in. Greg is even bigger than the last time they saw each other, his shirt looking ready to pop off him if he breathes too deeply, two massive plump breasts with pert nipples visible through the thinly stretched fabric that only seems to grow tighter as it hugs a huge barrel of a belly. John’s eyes trail down to the indent of the man’s navel which is visible through the material. He longs to slip his tongue into it, to nibble along the lip of fat beneath it and then to bite those plush perfect lovehandles that aren’t even trying to hide where they bloom out from between too tight trousers and shirt.
His blue eyes glowed bright again, then dimmed and darkened to a rich blue. The demon's features became less harsh and otherworldly, though no less handsome or familiar. He belched, and chuckled, his rosy cheeks causing his eyes to crinkle.
John felt himself getting hard.
Sherlock looks at the infamous James Moriarty, at his round, bulbous gut spilling almost to his knees - resting on fat, thick, flabby thighs. His ass, two near-yoga balls of pale flesh, rippling and shaking as he attempts to rolls forward far enough to get off of it, cylindrical, sausage-like arms swinging about him wildly as he throws a slew of curses at not just his usual nemeses, but at that "fucking bitch" who "did this to him."
"That's it, nice to have you back," John says, managing a small smile. His eyes drift to Sherlock’s engorged belly, the curve oddly mesmerizing. Sherlock Holmes can look human after all.
He held out a podgy hand and took Sherlock's slim fingers in his soft ones. He Pulled the other man closer, causing him to crash into his belly.
Sherlock slipped off his compression shorts, a pair of yellow panties the only keeping his hard cock from freedom, his absurdly wide ass flubbing out behind him. Two, perfectly full moons of pure, snowy fat. They spread out beneath him as he settled down onto the sofa, reaching forward and taking a handful of cake, shoveling it down, imagining John was egging him on, imagining himself egging John on, simply swelling fuller and fuller as his gut gurgled and groaned.
Again, they didn’t appear so
"The tie," said Sherlock, plucking it as if it were a string on his violin. "We're having dinner with my parents, not the Queen."
"You saved me."
Sherlock hiccupped around another bite of Pad Thai, having finished more than twice his usual order, still not satisfied, not big enough.
John blinked, then chuckled and drew his arms around Sherlock, rolling them over so that Sherlock was on top of him.
"You must be starving, having not eaten since breakfast," he offered, trying not to sound to aroused by his flatmate...eating. He cleared his throat, trying not to whimper, setting the dish down in front of his friend.
John was hiccuping by the end of it, his stomach clearly outlined by even his loosest jumper, his trousers biting him even with the button undone. John groaned and pressed a hand to his middle, grimacing, his breath coming out rather shallowly.
Sherlock merely hummed in response, leaning over to kiss at Greg's soft hip
John's mouth fell open.
"And they won't be over until the evening of the 25th, so the night of the 24th we can put out cookies and see if Father Christmas shows up," he joked, pouring John another cup of tea, then stuffing a few more cookies into his mouth.
“I don’t really feel like I did anything.”
John nods.
Just the two of us.
Wait!”
“Sit.
Went to live with my first girlfriend, Fran, in a dingy little flat in Edinburgh.
“You rub me up just fine.”
There’s no need.
He reaches out for John’s head, tilts his own, and swipes his lips messily over his cheek, against his temple, nuzzles at the hair over his ear.
“Wasn’t sure you actually wanted to meet me, you know.
“It’s not shadowing my life choices.
John is like a small, barely contained hurricane of desire, and it’s wonderful.
John doesn’t say anything, just turns and heads for the kitchen, in silence, fuming, thinking of all the ways he’s going to…
“Need you to look like you.”
They just are.
“Am I…?”
“What were your plans,” Sherlock finally asks.
Closes his eyes.
It’s nothing of importance, but there is a soothing quality to his voice, and Sherlock is rather tired, now that everything is said and done.
“Hey.”
“I decided to tell you I didn’t think it was a good idea.”
“I don’t see how anything I do is any of your business.”
“Greg.”
Had he been enough?
Then he—I don’t know…
He sucks in a great gasping, gulp of air.
“Come here.
You know how she gets.”
“What if it’s a little of both?”
He pulls back and reaches hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck.
“For god’s sake, John, keep talking.”
Sherlock’s tone is firm and fond, and it has John reaching for the bottle of wine and refilling his glass.
“Indeed, Watson.
You did figure out we didn’t have a case.
Perhaps he has given up the bed upstairs and moved into Sherlock’s bigger room and bigger bed on the main floor.
You still there?
John stops short.
One text from Sherlock’s number.
I forgot to tell you.”
Sherlock sighs in the melodramatic way that is starting to become all too familiar, but he does sit back on his heels, as John sits up, crosses his legs in front of him, and examines the three scarves.
“And if you could be quick aboud it, that’d be…”
I know I’m being a right prat.
There aren’t going to be any wives.
John moans, and pushes up to messily swipe his mouth over Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock’s grip on his arse tightens, a single firm squeeze, before he pulls him close, rolls them over until John is lying atop him, staring down at him, eyes heavy and mouth dry with lust.
Why aren’t you home getting this one her tea?”
“You left me first!”
“It’s alright.”
“Alright.”
Possibly.”
“Three.
Just make sure it doesn’t come back on him.”
“A philosopher, too.”
“You want me to move my stuff out.
That’s bound to stand out in these parts.
But this time he doesn’t.
Sherlock rolls his head in John’s direction.
Sherlock hums, and dutifully nibbles at the cheese as he scoffs at the wholly illogical advice on segregation of the queen.
The day has been pleasant thus far.
John kisses him, relishes in the familiar comfort of the way their lips move together, their hands explore one another’s bodies, the way both of their cocks make rather pathetic attempts at interest, and fail, and the way it doesn’t matter.
“You always forget a torch.”
He dips down and takes John into his mouth again, sucks hard, but not too hard, glides his tongue along the underside of John’s cock as he does.
“An enemy?”
He dresses hurriedly, takes a moment to try and pat his hair into some semblance of order, gives up, and jogs down the stairs, looking for all the world like a tardy uni student.
Anderson announces to the floor of diligently working detectives just outside Lestrade’s office door.
He looks back down in the fire.
How was it?”
Some place you can settle, and calm, and just be.
Sherlock pouts.
“Told ya.
Go to bed for a little while.
His voice is rough with want.
Not my place, I just.
“It is a bit much.”  John leans back in his chair, and stretches with a slight wince, stares out the window at the slate grey nothingness for a moment, and then back over at Sherlock.  “Good day to stay in and do nothing.”
If he could pull him in and under his skin he thinks he would.
He breathes some more.
“Mmm?”
They’ve been on the road for about 15 minutes when John finally speaks again.
There’s a door on the other side of the skip.  It’s old and rusted, clearly locked, and doesn’t look like it’s been opened recently, but the least he can do is try.  He picks the lock and cringes as the hinges squeak loudly in the echoing silence of the building. When he steps inside it’s to what appears to be an old office.  There is a desk thick with dust, a rusted filing cabinet with one drawer hanging out and another missing, an overturned desk chair, but on the floor there is a recent trail in the old dust, three sets of footprints, another set of someone being dragged.
“So,” he hurries to fill in the silence.
He gets in, shopping and all.
John sounds breathless, awed.
“Tired.”
“Yes.  I’ve been thinking about it too.”
“A bungee?
It’s likely they’ve got someone letting it right after us this time of year, and they’re probably city people who just have a service cleaning it between tenants.
“Oh yeah?
“Umm…
“Christ, you can still give me a workout.”
It’s important to me that you know that.
Watched that one where you were stroking the sheepskin.
“Yeah.
Big hero.
“Here, move off.
“It’s really not,” barely a whisper.
You’re a mentally ill ex-soldier, who lies to his therapist, drinks too much when he’s in a bad patch, which is more often than not, and who is already living off of my brother’s overinflated sense of generosity.”
He hears John sniff behind him.
John is staring at him.
Anything with crinkling makes me shiver, and not in a good way.
And dying for me is all fine and good, but I—I need you to
He could be a school teacher, a father from the suburbs, a bored and disillusioned GP.
“You okay?
Sherlock blinks.
Sherlock turns at the sound of his brother’s voice from the other side of the roof.
For the briefest of moments he thinks he’s angry, but then he realises his eyes are burning with an altogether different emotion.
Do you mean to tell me that you don’t know who James Bond is?!”
John reaches down and lifts the tray onto the bed, and the plate onto his lap.
“Why would you do that?”
“Please leave.”
John doesn’t like it, Sherlock has learned.
“Possibly.”
He smiles.
“Well, I promised you Treasure Island, and you ended up getting my sad, sorry life story instead.
Their shirts, side-by-side.
John flips through a few channels until he comes across The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.
“And you won’t complain when I remind you?”
No other casualties is the most worrying.
John grins and leans back in his chair.
He woke up that way, and he has no idea why.
Sherlock sighs.
He’s had to start tightening his belt another notch, and he doesn’t have the money to buy new clothes.
Yeah?
Come and see me at the office in a few days.”
It is the feelings, whatever they are, that are accompanying his obsession du jour, that seem to be stirring his body in ways it normally never does.
“You want to set up another session?”
He’s seeing red.
“Fine.
John just grins.
It could just be a place to come on holiday.
“Listen, Donna was a regular.
But this—this arousal brought on by something other than autonomic response, as the result of sentiment, attachment, and the mental replay of emotional and physical stimuli, this is something he has not experienced in a very long time.
“And yet here we sit, you having rung him twice, and he is nowhere to be found.
John thinks about it for a moment.
But, I’ve been thinking about it—for a long time, and I’d like to know.”
When he looks again, Sherlock is still there.
“And you look like a man who is about to force me into slave labour right at the festive season.
“I won’t be cold.
Off you go.”
“It isn’t.
“I say we go back to the park,” Mike smiles.
“I’ve just—never been with anyone like this before.”
He keeps food in the fridge.
“I always need
“We were so drunk.
“Get into bed. I’ll lock up.”
All safe and dry, and the owner should give us a bloody free day after all the work we just did.”
I mean that.
Sherlock stares down at the top of John’s head as he eases Sherlock’s coat from his shoulders.
His options weighed.
“We promise to stop if the other person gives any indication they’re no longer having a good time.”
The chimney seems clear, and there’s still plenty of wood.”
“No.”
John’s face screws up and Sherlock wonders if he is going to cry again, but he seems to master himself after a couple of deep breaths, and he continues.
He sighs, pulls away, and rolls onto his back to stare up at the ceiling.
There is nothing Mycroft Holmes has just said that isn’t true.
“Jesus, yeah.
Sherlock seems more comfortable.
Sherlock nods.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything.
To thrill in the feeling of John slowly getting as lost to sensation as Sherlock.
It’s ragged and raw, and he drops the terrible secret at Sherlock’s feet like it’s a poison he’s horrified to have carried so long, horrified even more that he’s carrying still.”
“There.
“Yes.”
I’m—I’m sorry.”
“Mmm.”
It’s been years since he’s done anything like this, and it’s becoming rather fun.
Just come back down here.
Sometimes I join in, lay in my own bed, and come listening to them.”
She is wet-eyed, and red cheeked, and she reaches out for him the minute he reaches the bottom.
“Lot to pick from, are there?”
“I know.”
“Makes you think sometimes.
There is a softness to him, that wasn’t there in real life.
John sucks in a breath through his nose, holds it, exhales slowly.
He feels John’s hand close around his fist, and understands.
“Yes.”
Sherlock’s eyes explore every inch of his face, and then he is surging forward, kissing John with a depth and intensity that takes his breath away.
John smiles again.  He can’t help himself.  He wants Sherlock to open his eyes.  He needs to know that whatever last night was, it was wanted, desired—cherished.
Sherlock nods.
He does.
Please.”
“Same as last time, no penetration unless you ask.”
How is that better?!
“Fine.
What might happen.”
Sherlock drops his arm.
The whinging is reaching a fevered pitch.
John shivers.
He could be back at Sherlock’s flat in less than half an hour.
He needs the space, to…
Sherlock’s mouth opens and closes, opens and closes even as he lifts another hand to steady the gun.
“It’s nothing.”
John huffs out another laugh.
Sherlock meets it softly.
“Thing?”
Rosie goes back to watching her film, humming to herself as she colours with the new crayons Mrs. Hudson brought her from the shops.
This is why he doesn’t do relationships, doesn’t do…
John’s head snaps around.
“Should we go home?”
Sherlock shakes his head.
Wake up.”
I imagined waiting until you’d teased yourself almost to the brink, and then walking in.
“We’re just getting caught up,” Sherlock offers without thinking.
Look at me.”
He nods.
It seemed to be helping him.
“John, it is true that gay and bisexual men have historically been subjected to higher than normal levels of prejudice and violence.
“I’ve never let myself…
It’s barely a whisper.
It’s all water under the bridge now.
He slides open the drawer to his desk and pulls out the warrant, handing it across to Sherlock.
“Jesus.”
And I find that several of them lead people to make assumptions, usually incorrect, about my talents, my intelligence, my ability to
A light breakfast is served.
Sleep—no euphemism.
Reaching down, he takes John by the hips, slides him back a little and then hooks his thumbs under the waistband of John’s pants.
Sherlock sighs.
“Did I do that?”
John’s face does something he can’t interpret.  “Yeah.  Of course.  Of course I’ll stay…  I’ll always stay.”
He licks his own before looking back up to his eyes again.
We’re supposed to leave tomorrow.
“Was just teasing you.”
John laughs in disbelief.
“I don’t like being blamed for things that aren’t my fault, either, things I didn’t do.
John falls back in step with Sherlock, skates close enough to be heard without being overheard.
“Yeah, I’m here.
“Come here.”
Sherlock mumbles into the pillow.
“Ridiculous.
“Me?”
Sherlock watches the tears squeeze between John’s fingers and drip down on the legs of his trousers.
A prick.
Let’s go to bed.”
Of course he had said yes.
This declaration is met with nothing but silence.
He should be grateful it’s Sherlock’s voice in his head, he supposes.
“I had hoped to show you the place and get your opinion before I revealed it’s origins.
John steps out into the gallery, and stares down the gaping stretch of room.
John huffs at the jolt to his shoulder.
“We can’t quit, we can’t give up, there’s a boy’s life in danger, I get that.
They were your family.”
“Mmm…
But a few more minutes are not to be, apparently, as Mrs. Hudson’s cheery, “Woo-hoo!”
You…”
Sherlock leans in, hovers for a moment, mouth barely touching John’s, tasting his breath on his tongue, and then he parts his lips and kisses him, the smallest taste, tongue sliding almost imperceptibly along the seam of John’s lips.
“Switch sides, maybe?”
“Yeah.
Sherlock looks back.
I loved you so much.
“What is this to you?”
You were an exception to that rule, and I guess you scared me there for a minute.
John slides his cheek over Sherlock’s skin.
“Yes, that’s right, but he’s on holiday.
John is sleeping, then.
He can feel the muscles there flutter, each time he strokes John’s cock.
Okay…
He can’t look at John.
So, I was just wondering, if…”
John’s eyes flick back and forth between Sherlock and his sister.
“You hungry?
I still have to go to Acton at 3:00 to meet to the estate agent, and if Rosie doesn’t get to see the African exhibit there will be hell to pay.”
Sherlock points.
There was a pallet of broken down boxes just outside the hospital’s loading bay.
“What’s that supposed to mean.”
Such a strange thing to say.
“That’s not true, you…”
“You have done me a great service, and no amount could ever come close to repaying you.
“Then what is this?”
Sherlock closes his eyes, and breathes in slowly, before opening them again.  “I had thought that after what I told you about my experiences at school, and after what we shared yesterday, you would have put two-and two together.  Do keep up.”
John goes quiet for a moment, and then his fingers are weaving between the strands of Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock’s whole body lights up, tingles, comes alive.
No, I’m not saying that.
“Yes.”
He leans in closer.
He feels John smile against his mouth.
“I am interested in men.
“GET OUT!”
Don’t think we’ll be walking anywhere in this rain.”
He pulls back, tilts his chin to look up at Sherlock’s face, suddenly so impossibly young and unsure.
Don’t do anything rash.”
Y'all, I realised this wasn't rated.  I've put a Mature rating on it now, just to be on the safe side where the lovin' is concerned.  If you know my stuff you know that the sexy times, on those rare occasions when they happen, are usually more love-making than porn.  But, anyway, I hope this doesn't make the rest of it unreadable for anyone.  If so, my apologies, and I totally understand.
“You said you had something for me, so out with it.
Your safe.
“She cares about you.
He’s confident he won’t let John down, and by the way John is panting, and fisting his hair as Sherlock sucks at his hip bone, he’s fairly certain he’s proving himself just fine.
You okay?”
“You’ll use the word?”
They sit in silence, both reading while John finishes his third glass of the evening.
John shakes his head.
“John, I have no experience with this.
Perhaps John will find different ways to touch him, ways that make him feel the way he does right now, safe beneath the weight of Johns’ body, with the comfort of John’s breath against his skin, the feather-light brush of John’s hair beneath his chin, and his hand splayed small and warm over his heart.
“Listen,” John tries gently.
It’s hot, and wet, and absolutely filthy, and John has never had a partner who has done this for him before, so it is also a novelty, every sensation a surprise.
He smiles when he finds exactly what he was hoping for, and then returns to the room, trying to ignore Tregennis’ corpse in the corner, which can offer him nothing more until an autopsy.
And so I started to be curious about it—what you do, what you like.”
“I know.
“Can I touch you?”
Why not afterwards?
John’s eyes drift downward, and Sherlock grins.  “No. Quite the contrary. You never cease to surprise me.  That’s novel for me.”
And with that she pushes out of the chair and heads for the door.
“We’re back.
“John.”
It hits him like a speeding lorry, knocks the wind out of him, wracking his body with wave after wave of near unbearable pleasure.
John doesn’t move.
And then there are Sherlock’s lips, hot and dry, pressing against the line of his neck, and John lets out a sound like a sob, twists the sheets around his hands, pants and gasps as Sherlock’s lips move up behind his ear, as he hums, deep and low against the skin there, reaches up to card long fingers through John’s hair, until all of John’s head is sheltered over by Sherlock’s hand, and John can’t think of anything at all, but more, and yes, and oh god, please!
“Okay, then.
Yeah.”
John grins.
John thinks.
Mike holds up his hands in surrender, still smiling, always smiling.  That’s just Mike’s way and John feels a twinge of guilt.
Sherlock watches him.
If he does have a wank it’s usually in the shower, or quick and angry leaning up against the wall or sprawled out on his bed, and he does it dry, so it hurts a little, so it reminds him not to like it too much, not to…
John huffs into the sheets, and then pulls them back down over his nose and grows silent.
Sherlock’s brain is white.
“I’ll get some at the shops tomorrow.”
Don’t know much about her either.
“You haven’t asked.
He sees Sherlock relax.
They laugh, they’re surprised, they even cry a couple of times, and when they get through the last of the letters around lunchtime Sherlock leans back on the sofa and stares over at the flames flickering behind the door of the wood stove.
He’s over halfway through unpacking both bags, when he realises what he’s assumed.
Fine.”
“Do you even know what that means?”
And Sherlock does, and lets John divest him of his trousers and pants too.
Well, take your time.
“You are a millionaire John.
His hands are cold, and it’s so good.
Sherlock nods again.
Sherlock aches, aches to touch him (
But, Sherlock doesn’t wait for any further invitation.
“Yeah, that’s true—isn’t it.”
Yeah.
“I—I use it to…
“I’m not asking you to talk dirty, I’m simply asking you to be as descriptive as possible.”
“Want it.”
safe.
#blow jobs (
am losing him, and I am asking you for your help.
“Just what is it you think you know?”
“Sorry.
“I can feel it, and I want you to try and let it go.”
You weren’t answering your texts.”
John laughs and sets the bag of food on top of the dresser, where he starts unpacking it.
He steps right into John’s space, all the way in, and slides a hand around the back of John’s neck.
Yes, I’m interested in men.
Sherlock pants, and speeds up the rhythm of his strokes.
“You’ve rather ruined the surprise, you know.
John chuckles.
John huffs.
Vows are exchanged with Greg Lestrade standing for Sherlock and Mike Stamford standing for John.
“I don’t know how to do this.
Sherlock fishes inside his coat pocket and pulls out the small vial, holds it up to the light for John to see.
“What?”  There. That’s hit its mark.
It’s a lie, but the truth is nothing John wants to hear, and something Sherlock hardly understands himself:
He reaches down, takes both John’s hands in his, and lifts them up between them.
What I have is a £7500 advance cheque made out to me.
He should be glad, grateful for the peace and quiet, but he isn’t.
Sherlock is on his feet and dashing down the corridor after her in a flash.  When they reach Lestrade’s office, there are already several officers just outside the door, huddled around a computer monitor.
“Mmm.”
“Mm?”
Little specks of dust with no purpose but to distract and mar the clarity of his vision.
Sherlock shakes his head, and John smiles, struggles with his spats and boots, and finally gets out of his trousers and coat, tossing them across the room in frustration.
Sherlock takes his hand, lets himself be hauled to his feet, and then steps closer, and reaches out to cup John’s face in his hands.
Ella smiles.
Nothing more than any child experiences during their school years.”
“I was so alone, and you…”
“You know Reuben Hayes?”
“You’re not okay.
He should stop it.
“Don’t mind the pain.”
“No, I…”
“Jealousy.”
“You’ve been here.”  Sherlock’s voice is rough with misuse.
His face feels hot.
I’ll get her to nursery.”
I invested my money elsewhere.
“I’ll tell you more over lunch.”
“It’s okay,” John reassures softly.
“And if I hadn’t got there on time?!”
“John I—there’s too much to do.
John blinks slowly, and smiles.
Nice for a change, but maybe not—all the time.”
“Fuck!” in echo from Rosie.
“I don’t want your apologies.
Down, down, down…
“Hold your hands out?”
“Get out of all this?”
John’s used to it.
Then measure me out a cup of currants, will you.”
Owes me a favour.
John’s brow knits, and he lifts a hand to pinch at it.
John huffs.
“Then, James Wilder
“Hey?”
“Yeah.
He can’t bring himself to look over at John, but he can see John looking up at him out of the corner of his eye.
